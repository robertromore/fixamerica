### Legislation (Complete)

All domains have `11-legislation.md` files with:

- Draft federal bills
- State model legislation
- Constitutional amendments (where applicable)
- Regulatory frameworks
- Loopholes analysis

### Plans (In Progress)

Constitutional amendment proposals in `plans/constitutional-amendments/`:

**Regional Federalism** (comprehensive restructuring):

- [x] Core design (25 documents)
- [x] Constitutional text (split into 8 focused files)
- [x] Implementation legislation (5 acts)
- [x] Stress testing and analysis (6 documents)

**Standalone Reforms** (can be adopted independently):

- [x] Election Reform (national popular vote, certification)
- [x] Judicial Reform (term limits, mandatory jurisdiction)

- [x] Lobbying Reform (anti-corruption, disclosure)

- [x] Tax Reform (taxation principles)

**Not Yet Developed:**

- [ ] Advocacy strategies
- [ ] Legislative campaign plans
- [ ] Electoral strategies

### Policies (Not Started)

Directory structure exists but content consolidation not yet begun.

**Next Steps:**

- Consolidate key proposals from `11-legislation.md` files
- Prioritize policies by feasibility and impact
- Create cross-domain policy packages

### Implementations (Not Started)

Directory structure exists with three subdirectories:

- `foreign-examples/` - Documentation of existing systems in other countries
- `current-system-simulations/` - Models of how current US systems work
- `alternative-system-simulations/` - Models of proposed alternatives

**Next Steps:**

- Document relevant foreign models (Nordic, European, etc.)
- Build simulations of current system outcomes
- Model alternative system projections

## Strengths

- Comprehensive analytical depth across all domains
- Substantial legislative drafting (57K lines)
- Professional project organization and documentation
- Clear file naming conventions and structure

## Gaps

- Implementation details remain largely theoretical
- Consolidated policy priorities not yet extracted
- Advocacy and campaign strategies not developed
- No simulation or modeling work completed

## Infrastructure Status

- [x] Markdown linting configured
- [x] Citation guide documented
- [x] Legislation guide documented
- [x] Templates created
- [x] Utility scripts functional
- [ ] Initial git commit
