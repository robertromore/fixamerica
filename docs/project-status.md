## Detailed Status

### Analysis (Complete)

All 23 policy domains have complete 11-file analysis:

- [x] Political (+ 27 subtopics)
- [x] Justice (+ 21 subtopics)
- [x] Economic (+ 14 subtopics)
- [x] Aging
- [x] Agriculture
- [x] Defense
- [x] Disability
- [x] Drugs
- [x] Education
- [x] Environment
- [x] Healthcare
- [x] Housing
- [x] Immigration
- [x] Infrastructure
- [x] Labor
- [x] Media
- [x] Mental Health
- [x] Privacy
- [x] Science
- [x] Social
- [x] Technology
- [x] Tribal
- [x] Veterans

### Legislation (Complete)

All domains have `11-legislation.md` files with:

- Draft federal bills
- State model legislation
- Constitutional amendments (where applicable)
- Regulatory frameworks
- Loopholes analysis

### Plans (In Progress)

- [x] Regional Federalism (20 documents, 9,495 lines)
- [ ] Additional implementation plans

### Policies (Not Started)

Directory structure exists but content consolidation not yet begun.

**Next Steps:**

- Consolidate key proposals from `11-legislation.md` files
- Prioritize policies by feasibility and impact
- Create cross-domain policy packages

### Implementations (Not Started)

Directory structure exists with three subdirectories:

- `foreign-examples/` - Documentation of existing systems in other countries
- `current-system-simulations/` - Models of how current US systems work
- `alternative-system-simulations/` - Models of proposed alternatives

**Next Steps:**

- Document relevant foreign models (Nordic, European, etc.)
- Build simulations of current system outcomes
- Model alternative system projections

## Strengths

- Comprehensive analytical depth across all domains
- Substantial legislative drafting (57K lines)
- Professional project organization and documentation
- Clear file naming conventions and structure

## Gaps

- Implementation details remain largely theoretical
- Consolidated policy priorities not yet extracted
- Advocacy and campaign strategies not developed
- No simulation or modeling work completed

## Infrastructure Status

- [x] Markdown linting configured
- [x] Citation guide documented
- [x] Legislation guide documented
- [x] Templates created
- [x] Utility scripts functional
- [ ] Initial git commit
