# Task: Create the [DOMAIN] Domain for FixAmerica Project

## Project Context

  FixAmerica is a policy research project analyzing problems in American society and proposing evidence-based solutions. The project uses a structured markdown format with comprehensive analysis across policy domains.

## Directory Structure

  Create files at: `/path/to/FixAmerica/analysis/[domain]/`

  Each subtopic gets its own subdirectory with 11 files:

- `01-overview.md` - Executive summary, scope, key facts, key questions
- `02-current-state.md` - Present-day conditions and data
- `03-history.md` - Historical context and evolution
- `04-root-causes.md` - Systemic analysis of why problems exist
- `05-stakeholders.md` - Who is affected and who has power
- `06-opposition.md` - Who opposes reform and why
- `07-solutions.md` - Proposed reforms and interventions
- `08-roadmap.md` - Implementation timeline and sequencing
- `09-resources.md` - Further reading and citations
- `10-actions.md` - What citizens can do
- `11-legislation.md` - Model legislation with draft text

## Content Requirements

### For 01-overview.md

- Executive Summary (2-3 paragraphs)
- Scope (bullet list of what's covered)
- Key Facts (6-10 statistics with sources implied)
- Key Questions (5-7 questions the analysis addresses)
- Relationship to Other Subtopics (links within domain)
- Related Topics (cross-domain connections)
- Document Navigation (Next link)

### For 11-legislation.md MUST include

- Overview of legislative approach
- 3-5 model federal bills with draft legislative text
- State model legislation
- **"Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification" section** with:
    - Potential Loopholes table (Loophole | Description | Severity)
    - Shortcomings table (Issue | Impact | Root Cause)
    - Numbered Rectification Procedures
- References to existing law
- Related Topics section
- Document Navigation

### Document Navigation Format (bottom of each file)

  ---
  Document Navigation

- Previous: XX-previous.md
- Next: XX-next.md
- Up: 01-overview.md

## Style Guidelines

- Objective tone without partisan framing
- Evidence-based with specific data points
- Accessible to educated general audience
- No emojis
- Actionable focus
- Use markdown tables for comparisons
- Use ATX-style headers (#, ##, ###)

## Domain: [DOMAIN NAME]

### Scope

  [Describe what this domain covers]

### Suggested Subtopics (10-15)

  Organize into logical categories:

  **Category 1: [Name]**

  1. [subtopic-name] - [brief description]
  2. [subtopic-name] - [brief description]

  **Category 2: [Name]**
  3. [subtopic-name] - [brief description]
  ...

### Key Data Points to Incorporate

- [Statistic 1]
- [Statistic 2]
- [Statistic 3]
  ...

### Cross-Domain Connections

- [Related domain]: [How it connects]
- [Related domain]: [How it connects]

## Output

  1. First, propose the subtopic list for approval OR proceed directly
  2. Create all 11 files for each subtopic
  3. Create the domain 01-overview.md with:
     - Comprehensive executive summary
     - Links to all subtopics organized by category
     - Core tensions section
     - "What Success Looks Like" section
     - Cross-domain relationship section

## Example Subtopic Structure (from Social domain)

  **Subtopic: child-poverty**

- 01-overview.md: Child poverty rate 16.3%, 2021 CTC impact, key questions
- 02-current-state.md: Demographics, deep poverty, international comparison
- 03-history.md: AFDC through CTC expansion/expiration
- 04-root-causes.md: Low wages, policy choices, family structure
- 05-stakeholders.md: Children, families, advocates, opposition
- 06-opposition.md: Fiscal concerns, work incentive arguments
- 07-solutions.md: Expanded CTC, child allowance, comprehensive approach
- 08-roadmap.md: Phased implementation, political strategy
- 09-resources.md: Research orgs, data sources, key publications
- 10-actions.md: Advocacy, voting, volunteering, donating
- 11-legislation.md: American Family Act, Child Allowance Act, with loopholes analysis

## Domain: Environment

### Scope

  Climate change, pollution, conservation, environmental justice, energy transition, and natural resource management.

### Suggested Subtopics

  **Climate & Energy**

  1. climate-change - Emissions, impacts, mitigation, adaptation
  2. energy-transition - Fossil fuels to renewables, grid, storage
  3. carbon-pricing - Carbon tax, cap-and-trade, border adjustments

  **Pollution & Health**
  4. air-quality - Clean Air Act, emissions standards, environmental health
  5. water-quality - Clean Water Act, PFAS, drinking water
  6. toxic-substances - Chemicals, Superfund, environmental contamination
