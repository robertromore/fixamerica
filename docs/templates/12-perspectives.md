# [Subtopic Title]: Political Perspectives Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes [topic] through nine distinct political perspectives, evaluating current state assessments, root cause analyses, proposed solutions, and legislation. Each perspective receives engagement consistency ratings and position scores, culminating in compromise proposals that bridge multiple viewpoints.

## Perspective Definitions

| Perspective | Core Values | Policy Orientation |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Tradition, limited government, individual responsibility | Incremental change, fiscal restraint, market solutions |
| Liberal | Progress, equality, social responsibility | Government as problem-solver, regulation, safety nets |
| Progressive | Systemic change, economic justice, structural reform | Transformative reform, wealth redistribution, worker power |
| Libertarian | Individual liberty, minimal state, free markets | Deregulation, privatization, voluntary association |
| Constitutionalist | Original intent, enumerated powers, federalism | Strict constitutional limits, states' rights |
| Populist | Anti-elite, pro-worker, economic nationalism | Trade protection, anti-monopoly, immigration restriction |
| Centrist | Pragmatism, compromise, incremental progress | Bipartisan solutions, evidence-based policy |
| Religious Right | Faith-based values, traditional morality | Social conservatism, religious liberty |
| Democratic Socialist | Worker ownership, public goods, democratic control | Public investment, labor rights, universal programs |

## Scoring Framework

### Position Scores (1-10)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10 | Full agreement with project analysis |
| 7-9 | Substantial to strong agreement |
| 5-6 | Mixed/moderate agreement |
| 3-4 | Substantial disagreement |
| 1-2 | Strong opposition |

### Engagement Consistency (1-5)

This metric assesses how reliably a perspective's stated positions align with its underlying principles, and how stable those positions are when concerns are addressed. Higher scores indicate more predictable negotiating partners.

| Level | Label | Indicators |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 5 | Highly Consistent | Stated positions reflect underlying principles; positions stable when concerns addressed |
| 4 | Mostly Consistent | Principles generally align with positions; minor strategic flexibility |
| 3 | Mixed Consistency | Some positions principled, others reflect coalition pressures or unstated concerns |
| 2 | Low Consistency | Positions shift frequently; stated concerns differ from underlying priorities |
| 1 | Unpredictable | Positions appear driven primarily by opposition dynamics rather than principles |

**Coalition-Building Considerations:**

- Alignment gap: When stated concerns differ from underlying priorities, addressing stated concerns may not secure support
- Position stability: Perspectives with shifting positions require ongoing negotiation
- Principle consistency: Perspectives that apply principles uniformly are more predictable partners
- Internal diversity: Some perspectives contain factions with different priorities

### Legislation Status Reference (as of [DATE])

| Bill/Amendment | Type | Current Status | Last Action |
|----------------|------|----------------|-------------|
| *[Bill 1]* | *Federal/State/Amendment* | *Pending/Passed/Blocked* | *[Last action]* |
| *[Bill 2]* | *Federal/State/Amendment* | *Pending/Passed/Blocked* | *[Last action]* |

*Note: Status reflects [Congress]. See [11-legislation.md](11-legislation.md) for full bill text.*
