## Relationship to Analysis

Policy proposals originate in the `analysis/` directory, specifically in:
- `07-solutions.md` files (policy ideas)
- `11-legislation.md` files (draft legal text)

This directory extracts and consolidates those proposals for practical implementation.

## Priority Areas

Based on analysis, high-priority policy areas include:

1. **Political Reform** - Foundational to all other reforms
2. **Economic Justice** - Addressing inequality and corporate power
3. **Criminal Justice** - Ending mass incarceration
4. **Climate Action** - Environmental sustainability
5. **Healthcare Access** - Universal coverage

## Status

This section is under development. Current work focuses on completing analysis across all 23 policy domains.
