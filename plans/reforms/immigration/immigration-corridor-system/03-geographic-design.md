## Hub Cities (Tier A)

### Purpose

Initial placement locations with concentrated services and integration infrastructure.

### Selection Criteria

| Criterion | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Housing slack** | Vacancy rates above 5%; available rental stock |
| **Transit access** | Public transportation for work commutes |

---

## Rural and Semi-Rural Placement Strategy

### Honest Assessment

Most rural areas cannot currently meet urban-style service standards. Rather than exclude rural communities entirely or set unrealistic preconditions, ICS creates tiered rural pathways with appropriate support.

| Reality | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| 60+ million rural Americans lack nearby primary care | Mobile/telehealth models required |
| Many rural schools already under capacity | Opportunity, but EL support lacking |
| Rural transit is rare | Employer transport or vehicle support needed |
| Rural employers face acute labor shortages | Strong demand for workers |
| Rural housing is often more affordable | Lower cost, but scattered |

### Rural Community Tiers

| Tier | Population | Service Access | ICS Eligibility |
|------|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Rural Hub** | 10,000-50,000 | Hospital, schools, some transit | Full corridor designation possible |
| **Rural Cluster** | 2,500-10,000 | Clinic access; K-12 schools | Cluster placement with mobile services |
| **Remote Rural** | Under 2,500 | Limited services | Individual sponsor pathway only |

### Placement Preconditions (Tiered)

**Rural Hub (standard requirements):**

- primary care within 30 minutes
- K-12 enrollment capacity verified
- employer commitment or labor market demand documented
- housing availability (vacancy rate above 5%)

**Rural Cluster (modified requirements):**

- primary care within 45 minutes OR mobile clinic commitment
- K-12 capacity with EL support plan
- employer sponsorship required (not just market demand)
- cluster of 10+ placements across 2-3 nearby communities

**Remote Rural (sponsor pathway only):**

- individual sponsor (employer, faith organization, or family)
- sponsor commits to transportation, healthcare navigation, and emergency support
- quarterly check-ins with case manager
- fast relocation pathway if sponsor arrangement fails

### Service Delivery Models

| Service | Urban Model | Rural Adaptation |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| **Primary care** | Clinic access | Telehealth + quarterly mobile clinic |
| **ESL classes** | Daily in-person | Hybrid online + weekly in-person |
| **Legal aid** | Walk-in office | Video consultation + circuit visits |
| **Case management** | Local office | Regional hub with phone/video |
| **Mental health** | Community provider | Telehealth with crisis backup |

### Mobile Service Infrastructure

| Component | Coverage | Frequency |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Mobile health clinic** | Rural cluster circuits | Monthly minimum |
| **Legal aid circuit** | Regional hub coverage | Bi-weekly |
| **ESL instruction van** | Cluster communities | Weekly sessions |
| **Case manager visits** | All rural placements | Quarterly minimum |

### Employer-Sponsored Rural Track

For employers in labor-shortage sectors (agriculture, food processing, healthcare, manufacturing):

| Requirement | Employer Obligation |
|-------------|---------------------|
| **Housing** | Provide or subsidize (not deducted from wages below legal limits) |
| **Transportation** | Provide to work, essential services, and town center |
| **Language support** | On-site or funded ESL access |
| **Emergency contact** | 24/7 point of contact for emergencies |
| **Compliance** | All labor law requirements; enhanced audit frequency |

**Benefits for participating employers:**

- priority access to corridor labor pipeline
- tax credits for rural placement support
- reduced regulatory burden for compliant employers

### Rural Capacity Building Grants

Federal investment to expand rural service capacity:

| Program | Purpose | Funding |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **Rural Health Expansion** | FQHC satellite clinics in corridor-eligible areas | $200M/year |
| **Rural EL Teacher Pipeline** | Loan forgiveness for EL teachers in rural schools | $50M/year |
| **Rural Transit Pilots** | Demand-responsive transit in corridor clusters | $100M/year |
| **Broadband Acceleration** | High-speed internet for telehealth/remote learning | Existing programs prioritized |

### Rural Safeguards

- **Opt-in only:** No mandated rural placement; all rural tracks are voluntary
- **Informed consent:** Clear disclosure of service limitations before placement
- **Minimum standards:** HHS/HUD enforce baseline requirements; violations trigger relocation
- **Fast relocation:** If services deteriorate or sponsor fails, relocation within 30 days
- **No isolation:** Rural placements must be in clusters or have sponsor support
- **Monitoring:** Enhanced check-in frequency for rural placements (monthly vs. quarterly)

### Expected Rural Participation

| Track | Estimated Annual Placements | Share of Total |
|-------|----------------------------|----------------|
| **Rural Hub** | 20,000-40,000 | 4-5% |
| **Rural Cluster** | 10,000-25,000 | 2-3% |
| **Remote Rural (sponsor)** | 5,000-10,000 | 1-2% |
| **Total rural** | 35,000-75,000 | 7-10% |

Rural placement is a meaningful but minority pathway. The system is designed primarily around urban hubs and corridors, with rural options for those who prefer them and communities that want to participate.

## Language Verification Protocol

### Standard Requirement: CEFR B1

| Skill | B1 Standard | Practical Meaning |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Listening** | Understand main points of clear standard speech | Follow workplace instructions; understand public announcements |
| **Reading** | Understand texts with common vocabulary | Read basic contracts, forms, and safety signs |
| **Speaking** | Describe experiences, give reasons, explain plans | Communicate with supervisors, neighbors, officials |
| **Writing** | Write simple connected text on familiar topics | Complete forms; write basic messages |

### Approved Testing Methods

| Test | Administrator | Format | Passing Score |
|------|---------------|--------|---------------|
| **TOEFL iBT** | ETS | Computer-based | 42-71 (B1 range) |
| **IELTS General** | British Council/IDP | In-person | 4.0-5.0 (B1 range) |
| **Duolingo English Test** | Duolingo | Computer-adaptive | 85-105 (B1 range) |
| **CASAS** | CASAS | In-person | 221-235 (B1 equivalent) |
| **ICS Corridor Assessment** | Certified corridor providers | In-person | Pass/fail with rubric |

### Test Administration Safeguards

| Safeguard | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Multiple approved tests** | Prevent monopoly pricing; ensure access |
| **Certified testing centers** | Quality control; prevent fraud |
| **ID verification** | Prevent proxy test-taking |
| **Score reporting to ICS** | Direct reporting; no self-reporting |
| **Random audit re-testing** | 5% of passers re-tested within 6 months |
| **Test prep prohibition** | Tests assess actual ability, not coaching |

### Cost and Access

| Component | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| **Test fee** | Subsidized for corridor participants ($0-50 vs. market rate) |
| **Testing locations** | Required in every hub city; mobile testing for corridors |
| **Retake policy** | Unlimited retakes with 30-day waiting period |
| **Preparation resources** | Free ESL programs in all corridor cities |

### Alternative Pathway (Disability/Elderly)

For participants who cannot meet standard testing requirements due to age (65+) or documented disability:

| Requirement | Verification |
|-------------|--------------|
| **Workplace language** | Employer certification of functional communication for job duties |
| **Safety comprehension** | Demonstrate understanding of emergency procedures, safety signs, 911 usage |
| **Daily living** | Case manager verification of ability to navigate essential services |
| **Medical/disability documentation** | Licensed professional attestation |

**Anti-Abuse Safeguards:**

- alternative pathway is exception, not default
- employer certification reviewed by independent case manager
- random spot-checks of alternative pathway approvals
- employers cannot require alternative pathway use

### Anti-Gaming Measures

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Teaching to the test** | Multiple approved tests with different formats |
| **Proxy test-taking** | Biometric ID verification at testing |
| **Fraudulent scores** | Direct score reporting; no paper certificates |
| **Employer coercion (force alternative)** | Independent verification; worker complaint channel |
| **Employer gatekeeping (block standard)** | Worker can test independently; employer cannot prevent |
| **Fake disability claims** | Licensed professional documentation required |

### Language Support Continuum

| Phase | Support Available |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Phase 0-1** | Intensive ESL (20+ hours/week); workplace language training |
| **Phase 2** | Continued ESL (10-15 hours/week); conversation practice |
| **Pre-Tier C** | Test preparation; practice exams; tutoring |
| **Post-Tier C** | Continued access to community ESL if desired |

### Accountability

- **Program quality metrics:** ESL programs must demonstrate B1 attainment rates above 60% within 24 months
- **Provider certification:** ESL providers must meet curriculum and instructor standards
- **Outcome tracking:** Language progress monitored at 6, 12, and 18 months
- **Support triggers:** If participant not progressing, enhanced support or accommodation review
