# Immigration Corridor System: Emergency Protocols

---

## Overview

ICS must maintain operations during crises while protecting participants and communities. This document details emergency response protocols for natural disasters, public health emergencies, economic crises, political disruptions, and system failures. The system is designed to fail gracefully rather than catastrophically.
