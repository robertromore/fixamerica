# Immigration Corridor System: Fiscal Architecture

---

## Overview

ICS requires substantial federal investment but generates significant revenue offsets through formal employment and reduced emergency spending. The fiscal architecture is designed to be transparent, sustainable, and protective of state/local governments.

---

## Budget Design Principles

### Modeling Structure

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Federal program costs** | Direct federal spending on intake, housing, education |
| **State/local incremental costs** | Additional local service delivery costs |
| **Revenue offsets** | Tax receipts and avoided emergency spending |
| **Incidence split** | How costs and benefits are distributed |

### Design Rules

| Rule | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Conservative assumptions** | Err toward overestimating costs |
| **Scenario bands** | Ranges, not point estimates |
| **Automatic stabilization** | Grants adjust to local need |
| **Federal cost-bearing** | Federal government bears disproportionate upfront cost |

**Key guardrail:** Federal government bears disproportionate upfront cost to avoid unfunded local mandates.

## Lead Agencies and Roles

| Agency | Role |
|--------|------|
| **Department of Homeland Security (DHS)** | Entry processing, biometrics, security screening |
| **Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)** | Health screening, clinic surge planning, behavioral health |
| **Department of Labor (DOL)** | Apprenticeships, credential pipelines, employer compliance |
| **Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)** | Placement standards, housing grants, landlord certification |
| **Department of Education (ED)** | EL surge funding, school-based coordination |
| **Independent Integration Oversight Office** | Appeals, audits, red-team reporting |

## Phased Rollout Timeline

| Phase | Timeline | Activities |
|-------|----------|------------|
| **Year 0-1** | Startup | Federal rulemaking; data system build; pilot hubs (3-5 cities) |
| **Year 1-3** | Expansion | Expand to 10-15 hubs; launch 20-40 corridor cities; refine algorithm |
| **Year 3-5** | National | Full coverage; formalize interstate compact; publish evaluation |

---

## Staffing and Capacity Benchmarks

| Function | Ratio |
|----------|-------|
| **Intake teams** | 1 case manager per 80-120 arrivals/month |
| **Housing placement** | 1 coordinator per 250-400 placements/month |
| **Education integration** | 1 EL coordinator per 1,000 newcomer students |
| **Oversight** | 1 auditor per 200,000 corridor residents/year |
