# Immigration Corridor System: Enforcement

---

## Overview

Credible, humane enforcement is essential to ICS political legitimacy. This section covers removal pathways, surge contingencies, and border processing operations.

---

## Removal and Return Pathways

### Honest Assessment

No immigration system can avoid the question of what happens to people who do not comply or cannot advance. ICS must have credible, humane enforcement mechanisms or it loses political legitimacy.

### Failure Categories and Outcomes

| Category | Definition | Primary Outcome |
|----------|------------|-----------------|
| **Administrative non-compliance** | Missed appointments; paperwork failures | Warning; support intervention; clock pause |
| **Prolonged stagnation** | No progress toward Tier C after 5+ years despite support | Case review; possible status adjustment to limited presence |
| **Minor criminal** | Non-violent misdemeanors | Standard justice system; no automatic removal |
| **Serious criminal** | Violent felony or repeat serious offenses | Criminal justice + removal proceedings |
| **Fraud** | Document fraud, identity fraud, benefit fraud | Benefit termination + removal proceedings |
| **National security** | Terrorism, espionage | Expedited removal with due process |

### Due Process Sequence

| Step | Timeline | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| 1. Notice of adverse action | Day 0 | Written notice in plain language with specific grounds |
| 2. Response period | 30 days | Opportunity to respond, submit evidence |
| 3. Administrative review | 60 days | Initial review by corridor office; decision or escalation |
| 4. Immigration court | Variable | Full hearing before immigration judge if escalated |
| 5. Appeal | 30 days to file | Board of Immigration Appeals review |
| 6. Judicial review | Variable | Federal court review of legal questions |
| 7. Final order | After exhaustion | Removal order or relief |

### Voluntary Departure Incentives

ICS prioritizes voluntary departure over forced removal:

| Incentive | Benefit |
|-----------|---------|
| **Departure assistance** | Travel costs covered; reintegration grant ($1,000-3,000) |
| **No reentry bar** | For administrative failures, no bar to future legal entry |
| **Reduced bar** | For minor violations, 1-3 year bar vs. 5-10 year |
| **Record sealing** | Administrative failures sealed after departure |
| **Return pathway** | Clear reapplication process with timeline |

### Removal Operations

When voluntary departure is refused and final order entered:

| Phase | Agency | Actions |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Custody** | ICE (retained) | Taken into custody for removal |
| **Detention** | ICE | Held in ICE facility pending removal |
| **Travel document** | State/ICE | Coordinate with country of origin |
| **Removal** | ICE | Physical deportation |

**ICS constraints on removal:**

- no family separation except for criminal/safety reasons
- children not detained except in family residential centers
- medical care and legal access during custody
- detention reviews at 90 and 180 days
- release with supervision if removal not imminent

## Countries That Refuse Repatriation

| Scenario | Current Scale | ICS Approach |
|----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Country refuses travel documents** | ~10 countries; ~50,000 individuals | Diplomatic pressure; visa sanctions |
| **Stateless individuals** | ~10,000+ | Cannot be removed; supervised release |
| **Country unstable** | Variable | Temporary protected status; deferred removal |

### For Individuals Who Cannot Be Removed

| Status | Conditions | Duration |
|--------|------------|----------|
| **Supervised release** | Check-ins; geographic restrictions; work authorization | Indefinite pending removal |
| **Order of supervision** | More intensive monitoring | For higher-risk cases |
| **Withholding of removal** | Protection from return to danger | Indefinite; no path to permanent status |

### Avoiding Indefinite Limbo

- After 3 years of supervised release with compliance, case review for status adjustment
- After 5 years, presumptive eligibility for limited lawful presence (not CLP) if removal remains impossible
- Work authorization maintained during supervised release
- Pathway to more permanent status if removal becomes permanently impossible

## Reentry Bars

| Violation | Bar Duration | Waiver Available |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| **Administrative failure** | None (voluntary departure) | N/A |
| **Overstay/presence violation** | 1-3 years | Yes, with showing |
| **Removal order** | 5 years | Yes, with showing |
| **Fraud** | 10 years | Limited |
| **Serious crime** | 10-20 years | Very limited |
| **Multiple removals** | 20 years | Limited |
| **Terrorism/security** | Permanent | No |

### Reentry Process

For those who departed or were removed and now seek reentry:

| Step | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| 1. Bar expiration | Wait required period |
| 2. Waiver application (if applicable) | Show exceptional circumstances or hardship |
| 3. New application | Apply through normal ICS intake |
| 4. Enhanced screening | Additional vetting based on prior history |
| 5. Conditional admission | May have additional monitoring initially |

## Criminal Justice Coordination

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Criminal justice first** | Prosecution and sentencing before immigration consequences |
| **No double punishment** | Immigration consequences are administrative, not punitive |
| **Proportionality** | Minor crimes do not trigger removal |
| **Rehabilitation recognized** | Post-conviction rehabilitation can mitigate consequences |
| **Juvenile protection** | Juvenile adjudications generally do not trigger removal |

---

## Enforcement Capacity

| Component | Current | ICS Target | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|------------|---------|
| **Immigration judges** | ~600 | 1,000+ | Reduce backlog; ensure due process |
| **ICE ERO officers** | ~6,000 | Maintained | Interior enforcement |
| **Detention beds** | ~34,000 | 25,000-30,000 | Reduced need with voluntary departure |
| **Alternatives to detention** | ~300,000 | 400,000+ | Supervision without custody |

---

## Transparency and Accountability

| Mechanism | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Public reporting** | Quarterly statistics on removals, voluntary departures, bars, waivers |
| **Detention conditions** | Independent monitoring of all detention facilities |
| **Enforcement priorities** | Published guidelines on who is prioritized for removal |
| **Complaint process** | Accessible process for reporting abuse or violations |

---

## Surge Mode (Mass Influx Contingency)

### Triggers

- intake exceeds capacity by 15% for 60 consecutive days
- housing vacancy below 3% in hub/corridor regions for 3 consecutive months
- school caps exceeded (≥95% of staffed capacity) for two consecutive months
- clinic overload (primary care wait >30 days or utilization >85%) for two consecutive months

**Capacity baseline:** Defined quarterly using staffed intake slots, verified housing placements, and service availability.

### Surge Actions

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Temporary reception centers** | Max 30-day stay; automatic closure within 120 days unless Congress reauthorizes |
| **Triage placement** | Priority allocation to available capacity |
| **Automatic corridor expansion** | New cities activated |
| **Federal logistics surge** | DHS/FEMA coordination |
| **Pause participation bonuses** | Base RID continues; bonuses paused |

### Surge Safeguards

| Safeguard | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Hard sunset** | Reception centers close automatically |
| **IG review at day 21** | Inspector General oversight |
| **Congressional reauthorization** | Required for extension beyond 120 days |
