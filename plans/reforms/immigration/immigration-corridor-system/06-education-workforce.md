# Immigration Corridor System: Education and Workforce

---

## Overview

ICS employs a two-generation strategy: integrate adults into the workforce while ensuring their children succeed in schools. This creates compounding benefits and builds political support through visible economic contributions.

---

## Education Integration (Two-Generation Strategy)

### Philosophy

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Children first** | School integration is priority; parents follow |
| **Capacity-based** | Placements respect school staffing capacity |
| **Support-intensive** | Surge funding for EL services |
| **Community-building** | Schools as integration hubs |

### School Load Budget

EL placements are capped by staffed capacity:

| Metric | Threshold | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **EL student ratio** | 15-20% of school enrollment | Monitor; trigger capacity review |
| **EL teacher ratio** | 1:20 EL students | Maintain minimum staffing |
| **EL aide ratio** | 1:10 for newcomers | First-year intensive support |

### Federal EL Surge Fund

Automatic funding formula for corridor schools:

| Category | Funding |
|----------|---------|
| **EL teachers** | $80,000/FTE (salary + benefits) |
| **Paraprofessionals** | $45,000/FTE |
| **Translators** | $50,000/FTE |
| **Newcomer intake centers** | $200,000/center startup + operating |

**Trigger:** Funding activates automatically when corridor designation applied.

### School-Based Programs

| Program | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **District welcome centers** | Enrollment, assessment, family orientation |
| **Newcomer pathways (6-12 months)** | Intensive language and academic support |
| **After-school integration commons** | Homework help; social activities; cultural exchange |
| **School-based adult ESL** | Parents learn English at their children's school |

### Citizen Incentives

RID credits for education support activities:

| Activity | Credit Value |
|----------|--------------|
| **Tutoring** | $25-50/hour (verified) |
| **Classroom support** | $20-40/hour |
| **After-school programming** | $25-50/session |
| **Translation support** | $30-60/hour |

## Labor-Market Safeguards

### Wage and Displacement Protections

| Protection | Mechanism |
|------------|-----------|
| **Sector-specific wage floors** | Monitoring with enforcement audits |
| **Temporary sector caps** | If local unemployment spikes |
| **Displacement mitigation funds** | For affected local workers |

### Employer Compliance

| Requirement | Enforcement |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Joint compliance sweeps** | DOL/DHS coordination for high-risk sectors |
| **Violator blacklist** | Repeat violators barred from corridor hiring pipelines |

---

## Employer Engagement and Incentives

### Design Philosophy

The plan cannot succeed through enforcement alone. Employers must see participation as advantageous, not just obligatory.

### Employer Partnership Tiers

| Tier | Requirements | Benefits |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Registered** | E-Verify compliance; no recent violations | Access to corridor hiring pipeline |
| **Certified** | + Language training contribution; + safety training | Priority placement; reduced audit frequency |
