## Evaluation Framework

### Evaluation Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Outcome-focused** | Measure results, not just activities |
| **Multi-dimensional** | Track efficiency, effectiveness, equity, and experience |
| **Transparent** | Public reporting; independent verification |
| **Actionable** | Metrics drive program improvement |
| **Balanced** | Include both quantitative and qualitative measures |

### Evaluation Levels

| Level | Focus | Frequency |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **Process** | Are we doing things right? | Continuous |
| **Output** | Are we producing what we planned? | Monthly |
| **Outcome** | Are we achieving results? | Quarterly |
| **Impact** | Are we making a difference? | Annual |

### Logic Model

```
INPUTS          ACTIVITIES         OUTPUTS           OUTCOMES          IMPACT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Funding    →    Intake         →   CLP issued    →   Integration   →  Economic
Staff           Processing         Tier advances     Employment        contribution
Facilities      Services           Services          Language          Social
Partners        Monitoring         Compliance        Civic             cohesion
                                                     participation     Community
                                                                       stability
