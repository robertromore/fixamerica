# Immigration Corridor System: Unaccompanied Minors Protocol

---

## Overview

Unaccompanied children (UC) represent a distinct population requiring specialized handling under the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA) and Flores Settlement Agreement. ICS maintains and strengthens existing protections while integrating UC into the corridor system.

---

## Scope and Scale

| Metric | Recent Volume | Trend |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| **Annual UC encounters** | 100,000-150,000 | Variable; surge-prone |
| **Average age** | 15-16 years | Younger children increasing |
| **Primary countries of origin** | Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Mexico | Shifting patterns |
| **Family reunification rate** | ~85% | Within 30-60 days |

---

## Legal Framework

The TVPRA and Flores Settlement Agreement govern UC handling:

| Requirement | Current Law | ICS Compliance |
|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Transfer to HHS/ORR** | Within 72 hours of apprehension | Maintained; no change |
| **Licensed care facilities** | Required for all UC | Maintained; capacity expansion |
| **Best-interest determination** | Required before release | Formalized process |
| **Legal representation** | Not guaranteed | ICS provides funding |
| **Removal restrictions** | Special protections for non-contiguous countries | Maintained |

## Intake and Initial Care

## Age-Out Transitions

Youth who turn 18 while in ORR care or pending proceedings:

| **No pending case** | CLP eligibility if meeting residency criteria; transition planning |

| **Suspected trafficking** | Immediate separation from potential trafficker; specialized interview |
| **Confirmed trafficking** | T-visa eligibility; victim services; safe housing |
| **Labor exploitation** | DOL referral; witness protection if needed |
| **Smuggling debt** | Counseling; no enforcement against victim |

---

## Capacity and Staffing

| Component | Current Capacity | ICS Target | Gap |
|-----------|------------------|------------|-----|
| **ORR shelter beds** | ~13,000 | 20,000-25,000 | +7,000-12,000 |
| **Case managers** | ~1,500 | 3,000 | +1,500 |
| **Immigration judges (UC docket)** | ~100 | 250 | +150 |
| **Legal aid attorneys** | ~500 FTE | 1,500 FTE | +1,000 |
| **Child advocates** | ~200 | 500 | +300 |

---

## Funding

| Component | Annual Cost (at scale) |
|-----------|------------------------|
| **ORR shelter operations** | $2.5-4.0B |
| **Post-release services** | $500M-800M |
| **Legal aid for UC** | $300M-500M |
| **Case management expansion** | $200M-400M |
| **Capacity surge reserve** | $500M |
| **Total UC-specific** | **$4.0-6.2B** |

---

## Oversight and Accountability

| Mechanism | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Child welfare standards** | All facilities must meet state licensing requirements |
| **Independent monitoring** | Flores compliance monitoring; ombudsman access |
| **Incident reporting** | Mandatory reporting of abuse, neglect, or safety incidents |
| **Data transparency** | Quarterly public reports on capacity, placement times, and outcomes |
| **Congressional notification** | Required for facility openings/closings and surge activations |

---

## Family Separation Prevention

ICS does not separate families except:

- when required by child safety (abuse, trafficking, exploitation)
- when age determination indicates the minor is actually an adult
- when the accompanying adult is not the legal parent/guardian and consent is absent

**Reunification priority:** Separated families receive expedited reunification processing with legal aid.

## Integration with ICS

### UC-to-CLP Pathway

| Stage | Process |
|-------|---------|
| **Initial** | UC processed under TVPRA; ORR custody |
| **Release** | To qualified sponsor; post-release services |
| **Status** | Eligible for CLP upon meeting criteria |
| **Advancement** | Standard tier progression; priority EL services |

### Special Considerations

| Consideration | Accommodation |
|---------------|---------------|
| **Education continuity** | School stability prioritized over geographic placement |
| **Mental health** | Trauma-informed care required |
| **Legal representation** | Guaranteed funding throughout process |
| **Family unity** | Placement near family when possible |
