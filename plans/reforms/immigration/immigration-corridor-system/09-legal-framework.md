## Legal Scaffolding for Corridor Status

### Federal Status Framework

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Statutory authority** | Create new federal status: Corridor Lawful Presence (CLP) |
| **Provisional lawful presence** | Safe harbor begins at intake initiation |
| **CLP issuance** | Granted upon intake completion and biometrics |
| **Work authorization** | Automatic upon CLP issuance |
| **Preemption baseline** | Federal status preempts state penalties for mere presence |

### Status Pathways

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Entry** | Provisional lawful presence begins at Phase 0; CLP after intake completion |
| **Duration** | CLP lasts through Tier B unless revoked for defined triggers |
| **Advancement** | Tier C eligibility based on published benchmarks |
| **Termination** | CLP ends upon PR, voluntary departure, or removal after due process |

### Due Process and Review

| Protection | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Notice** | Written, plain-language notice for any adverse action |
| **Appeals** | Independent administrative review within 30 days |
| **Automatic stay** | For non-violent cases during appeal |
| **Data protection** | Access limited to integration agencies; law enforcement access requires statutory criteria |

---

## Legacy Resident Adjustment Track

### Purpose

Provide pathway for already-assimilated undocumented residents to regularize status without geographic relocation.

### Eligibility

| Requirement | Standard |
|-------------|----------|
| **Continuous residence** | 5+ years in U.S. with verified address history |
| **Economic participation** | Employment, caregiving, or education engagement |
| **Language baseline** | Comparable to Tier C requirements |
| **Law compliance** | No violent felony; disqualifying misdemeanors limited by statute |

### Process

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Registration** | One-time filing with biometrics and background check |
| **Provisional status** | Lawful presence immediately upon filing |
| **CLP issuance** | After screening completion |
| **Location** | No corridor relocation required; remain in current community |

### Advancement

| Pathway | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Fast-track** | If Tier C benchmarks already met |
| **Individualized plan** | Time-limited milestones if gaps remain |

### Safeguards

| Safeguard | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Data firewall** | Application data not used for enforcement except serious criminal triggers |
| **Tax compliance** | Payment plans available; no punitive back-taxes for low-income |
| **Fixed window** | Application window closes to avoid open-ended channel |

## Legislative Language Outlines

| **Title III - Community Compensation** | RID funding authority, eligibility, anti-fraud |
| **Title IV - Education and Workforce** | EL surge fund, credential reciprocity, apprenticeships |
| **Title V - Oversight and Civil Liberties** | Oversight Office, audits, appeals |

### Required Rulemaking

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Tier C benchmarks** | Define standards, denial criteria, appeal timelines |
| **Algorithmic fairness** | Publish thresholds and audit cadence |
| **RID specifications** | Caps, eligibility verification, fraud penalties |
| **Data governance** | Minimization, retention limits, privacy sharing |

## Legal Pathway Mapping

### Relationship to Existing Categories

| Category | Relationship |
|----------|--------------|
| **Asylum/Refugee** | CLP does not replace asylum; provides presence while claims adjudicated |
| **Family-based visas** | CLP does not confer preference; petitions proceed under existing caps |
| **Employment-based visas** | CLP holders may transition if eligible |
| **TPS/DACA** | CLP eligibility distinct; existing protections remain unless opt-in |

### Transition Rules

| Rule | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **No double counting** | Time in CLP counts toward residency clocks if statutes permit |
| **No penalty for exit** | Voluntary departure ends CLP without future bar unless statutory grounds |
| **Due process** | Transition denial must cite statutory criteria and permit appeal |

## Asylum and Claims Integration

### Adjudication Capacity

| Component | Enhancement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Asylum officers** | Expanded staffing |
| **Immigration judges** | Hiring targets increased |
| **Legal representation** | Funding for vulnerable populations |
| **Case triage** | Priority for credible fear and urgent claims |

### Process Integration

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **No prejudice** | CLP status does not delay or prejudice asylum adjudication |

## Constitutional Considerations

### Federal Authority

|-------|-------------|
| **Plenary power** | Congress has broad authority over immigration |

### State Preemption

| Preempted | Not Preempted |
|-----------|---------------|

| **Work authorization restrictions** | State licensing within federal bounds |
| **Status-based discrimination** | Benefits funded solely by state |

### Due Process Requirements

| Requirement | Application |

| **Notice** | Required for all adverse actions |
| **Hearing** | Before removal of lawful presence |
| **Appeal** | Independent review available |
| **Judicial review** | Federal courts for legal questions |
