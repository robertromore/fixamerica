# Immigration Corridor System: Political Perspectives Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes the Immigration Corridor System through nine distinct political perspectives, evaluating current state assessments, root cause analyses, proposed solutions, and legislation. Each perspective receives engagement consistency ratings and position scores, culminating in compromise proposals that bridge multiple viewpoints.

The ICS represents an unusual policy proposal in that it deliberately incorporates elements designed to appeal across ideological lines: legal status (progressive priority), enforcement (conservative priority), community compensation (local government priority), earned advancement (centrist framing), and geographic distribution (national burden-sharing).

---

## Perspective Definitions

| Perspective | Core Values | Policy Orientation |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Tradition, limited government, individual responsibility | Incremental change, fiscal restraint, market solutions |
| Liberal | Progress, equality, social responsibility | Government as problem-solver, regulation, safety nets |
| Progressive | Systemic change, anti-criminalization, institutional reform | Transformative reform within existing structures; coalitional approach |
| Libertarian | Individual liberty, minimal state, free markets | Deregulation, privatization, voluntary association |
| Constitutionalist | Original intent, enumerated powers, federalism | Strict constitutional limits, states' rights |
| Populist | Anti-elite, pro-worker, economic nationalism | Trade protection, anti-monopoly, immigration restriction |
| Centrist | Pragmatism, compromise, incremental progress | Bipartisan solutions, evidence-based policy |
| Religious Right | Faith-based values, traditional morality | Social conservatism, religious liberty |
| Democratic Socialist | Worker ownership, class solidarity, anti-capitalism | Public ownership, labor rights, rejection of market-based reforms |

**Progressive vs. Democratic Socialist distinction:** Both favor legalization and oppose harsh enforcement, but differ in approach. Progressives work within Democratic Party coalitions, accept incremental reform, and focus on institutional change. Democratic Socialists reject market-based solutions, emphasize class analysis over individual rights framing, and may prioritize worker solidarity over legislative compromise. On ICS specifically, Democratic Socialists are more likely to oppose employer-based mechanisms and conditional advancement as capitalist labor control.

### Scope and Limitations

**What this analysis covers:** Ideological perspectives that shape public discourse and legislative coalitions on immigration reform.

**What this analysis does not cover:** This document focuses on ideological lenses rather than stakeholder interests. A complete political analysis would also include:

| Stakeholder | Primary Interests | Covered Here |
|-------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Immigrant communities** | Legal status, family unity, enforcement relief | Indirectly (via Progressive/Liberal/DemSoc) |
| **Employers** | Labor supply, compliance burden, predictability | Indirectly (via Conservative/Centrist) |
| **State/local implementers** | Funding, capacity, federal mandates | Partially (via Constitutionalist) |
| **Law enforcement** | Enforcement authority, resource allocation | Partially (via Conservative/Constitutionalist) |
| **Receiving communities** | Service capacity, housing, cultural integration | Partially (via Centrist/Populist) |

Stakeholder-specific analysis appears in [Community Integration](05-community-integration.md), [Implementation](15-implementation.md), and [Political Path](13-political-path.md).

### Internal Heterogeneity Note

Several perspective labels encompass significant internal diversity:

| Perspective | Notable Sub-factions | Policy Variance |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Conservative** | Business conservatives vs. populist conservatives | High - business wing favors legal labor; populist wing favors restriction |
| **Populist** | Economic populists vs. cultural/nationalist populists | Moderate - both restrict, but different stated rationales |
| **Religious Right** | Evangelical Immigration Table vs. restrictionist evangelicals | High - genuine split on immigration policy |
| **Progressive** | Pragmatic progressives vs. maximalist "abolish" wing | Moderate - both favor legalization; differ on enforcement |

Scores represent estimated central tendencies; individual organizations or figures within each perspective may diverge significantly.

## Scoring Framework

### Position Scores (1-10)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10 | Full agreement with ICS approach |
| 7-9 | Substantial to strong agreement |
| 5-6 | Mixed/moderate agreement |
| 3-4 | Substantial disagreement |
| 1-2 | Strong opposition |

### Engagement Consistency (1-5)

This metric assesses how reliably a perspective's stated positions align with its underlying principles, and how stable those positions are when concerns are addressed. Higher scores indicate more predictable negotiating partners.

| Level | Label | Indicators |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 5 | Highly Consistent | Stated positions reflect underlying principles; positions stable when concerns addressed |
| 4 | Mostly Consistent | Principles generally align with positions; minor strategic flexibility |
| 3 | Mixed Consistency | Some positions principled, others reflect coalition pressures or unstated concerns |
| 2 | Low Consistency | Positions shift frequently; stated concerns differ from underlying priorities |
| 1 | Unpredictable | Positions appear driven primarily by opposition dynamics rather than principles |

**Coalition-Building Considerations:**

- **Alignment gap:** When stated concerns differ from underlying priorities, addressing stated concerns may not secure support
- **Position stability:** Perspectives with shifting positions require ongoing negotiation
- **Principle consistency:** Perspectives that apply principles uniformly are more predictable partners
- **Internal diversity:** Some perspectives contain factions with different priorities

### Key ICS Components for Evaluation

**Primary components** (scored in matrix):

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **CLP Status** | Corridor Lawful Presence - legal status from day one |
| **Geographic Tiers** | Hub → Corridor → National mobility progression |
| **RID Payments** | Resident Integration Dividend to host communities |
| **Earned Advancement** | Clear benchmarks for tier progression |
| **Legacy Track** | Adjustment path for already-present unauthorized |
| **Enforcement** | Removal pathways with due process |
| **Civic Integration** | Civic education with neutrality safeguards |

**Additional components** (not separately scored but influence perspective positions):

| Component | Description | Primary Perspective Concerns |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------------|
| **Employer compliance** | Registration, verification, sanctions | Conservative (enforcement), Progressive (worker protection), Libertarian (burden) |
| **Asylum integration** | Processing asylum within ICS framework | Liberal (humanitarian), Conservative (abuse prevention) |
| **Housing placement** | Algorithm-based, capacity-matched | Libertarian (government control), Populist (community impact) |
| **International operations** | Origin-country processing | Constitutionalist (executive authority), Progressive (access barriers) |

These additional components are addressed in perspective narratives but not separately quantified to avoid matrix complexity.

### Coalition Label Criteria

Each perspective analysis includes a "Coalition Potential" section using standardized labels:

| Label | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **Natural allies** | Share 3+ high-scoring (7+) components AND similar engagement consistency (±1) |
| **Potential bridges** | Share 1-2 high-scoring components OR addressable concerns through modification |
| **Unlikely partners** | Structural opposition on 2+ core components OR engagement consistency gap ≥2 |

These labels indicate potential for issue-based cooperation, not general political alignment.
Consistency gap overrides component overlap when assigning labels.

### Scoring Methodology

Each perspective receives scores across four dimensions:

| Dimension | Method | Source |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Current State** | Single score (1-10) | Agreement with ICS problem diagnosis |
| **Root Causes** | Single score (1-10) | Agreement with ICS causal analysis |
| **Solutions Avg** | Arithmetic mean | Average of 7 component scores (CLP Status through Civic Integration) |
| **Legislation Avg** | Arithmetic mean | Average of 4 legislative component scores (CLP Status Creation, Interstate Compact, RID Funding, Oversight Office) |

**Calculation rules:**

- All averages are unweighted arithmetic means rounded to nearest integer
- Component scores range 1-10; averages inherit this range
- "Solutions Avg" reflects support for ICS design elements as abstract policy proposals
- "Legislation Avg" reflects willingness to vote for ICS as enacted legislation (may differ from policy support due to political constraints, electoral risk, or coalition dynamics)

**Validation:** Solution component scores appear in the "Solution Support Matrix" table, allowing readers to verify Solutions Avg. Legislation Avg is derived from Legislation Evaluations tables within each perspective section (4 components: CLP Status Creation, Interstate Compact, RID Funding, Oversight Office).

### Methodology Limitations

| Limitation | Impact | Mitigation |
|------------|--------|------------|
| **Single-rater scores** | Subjective; no inter-rater reliability | Transparent reasoning provided for each score |
| **Point estimates vs. ranges** | Overstates precision; masks internal variance | Heterogeneity note above; confidence flags in matrix |
| **Ideological vs. institutional** | Perspective counts ≠ legislative votes | Viability notes reference institutional realities |
| **Static snapshot** | Positions evolve with political context | Freshness metadata; periodic review recommended |

**Interpreting scores:** Scores should be understood as informed estimates reflecting publicly stated positions and observable behavior patterns, not as precise measurements. Readers should treat ±1-2 point variation as within the margin of reasonable disagreement. Where internal splits are significant, the Solution Support Matrix includes confidence flags.

## Perspective Analyses

### Conservative Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual priorities | Mixed - rule-of-law and economic concerns stated; polling shows positions also correlate with cultural change attitudes |
| Principle consistency | Inconsistent - "legal immigration good" rhetoric often paired with opposition to legal pathway expansion |
| Goalpost stability | Moderate - concerns about enforcement have historically shifted when enforcement provisions are offered |
| Zero-sum behavior | Present in some factions - "any legalization = amnesty" framing regardless of conditions |

**Justification:** Conservative immigration positions reflect genuine concerns about rule of law, wage competition, and community stability. However, polling data shows immigration attitudes correlate strongly with cultural attitudes beyond economic factors (Pew, 2020; PRRI, 2021). The wide variance between traditional business conservatives (who favor legal labor supply) and populist conservatives (who favor restriction) complicates assessment.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- 2013 Gang of Eight bill received substantial Republican support in Senate before House leadership blocked vote
- Business groups (Chamber of Commerce) consistently support legal immigration expansion while GOP base opposes
- Shifting objections: "secure the border first" → "chain migration" → "public charge" as each concern addressed

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Strong agreement that current system is chaotic, enforcement is inconsistent, and legal pathways are inadequate |
| Root Cause Agreement | 6/10 | Agree on enforcement gaps and legal pathway bottlenecks; may disagree that legalization is appropriate response |

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| CLP Status (legal from day one) | 3/10 | "Amnesty rewards lawbreakers" | Concern about precedent; future flows; electoral implications |
| Geographic Tiers | 6/10 | Mixed - appreciates structure, concerns about enforcement | Workable if enforcement credible |
| RID Payments | 7/10 | Generally supportive of community compensation | Cost concerns; ensures local buy-in |
| Earned Advancement | 8/10 | Strong support for earned pathway vs automatic | Aligns with merit and responsibility values |
| Legacy Track | 3/10 | "Cannot reward those who broke the law" | Political cost of appearing to support "amnesty" |
| Enforcement Component | 9/10 | Critical priority | Must be credible and well-funded |
| Civic Integration | 7/10 | Generally supportive of civic education | Must avoid partisan indoctrination |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill Component | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| CLP Status Creation | 3/10 | Likely oppose as amnesty | Political toxicity of any legalization |
| Interstate Compact | 6/10 | Federalist structure appealing | States' rights alignment |
| RID Funding | 5/10 | Concern about costs | Fiscal responsibility |
| Oversight Office | 4/10 | Skeptical of new bureaucracy | Government expansion |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Enforcement-first sequencing (full border security before any legalization)
- Merit-based point system for new entries without legalization of current unauthorized
- Mandatory E-Verify with employer sanctions
- Reduced legal immigration overall with skills-based selection

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberal (on RID payments, earned advancement, and civic integration), Religious Right (on RID payments, earned advancement, and civic integration)
- **Potential bridges:** Constitutionalist (on enforcement and earned advancement), Populist (on enforcement)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive, Libertarian, Centrist, Democratic Socialist (structural differences and/or consistency gap)

---

### Liberal Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual priorities | Generally aligned - humanitarian, economic, and practical concerns are genuinely held |
| Principle consistency | Mostly consistent - support for immigration reflects consistent equality and inclusion values |
| Goalpost stability | Stable - have consistently supported comprehensive reform with path to citizenship |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low - willing to accept enforcement as part of comprehensive package |

**Justification:** Liberal immigration positions are generally principled, reflecting humanitarian values, economic analysis, and practical concerns about enforcement-only approaches. Some strategic considerations (demographic assumptions, electoral calculations) exist but are not primary drivers.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Consistent support for comprehensive reform across multiple Congresses
- Willingness to accept significant enforcement provisions in 2013 Gang of Eight bill
- Support for DACA through executive action when legislation blocked

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strong agreement on chaos, humanitarian costs, and enforcement failures |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | Agree on structural causes; may emphasize push factors and US policy role more |

**Source references:**

- Center for American Progress, "A Fair and Welcoming Immigration System" (2024)
- Democratic National Committee, 2024 Platform, Immigration section
- Migration Policy Institute, "U.S. Immigration Policy Program" reports (2022-2024)

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| CLP Status (legal from day one) | 9/10 | Strong support for legal status | Core priority - end criminalization |
| Geographic Tiers | 5/10 | Concerns about mobility restrictions | May view as "second-class status" |
| RID Payments | 8/10 | Supportive of community investment | Addresses local impact concerns |
| Earned Advancement | 7/10 | Acceptable if requirements reasonable | Clear timeline matters |
| Legacy Track | 9/10 | Essential component | Must include current unauthorized |
| Enforcement Component | 5/10 | Acceptable if humane and targeted | Concerns about over-enforcement |
| Civic Integration | 7/10 | Supportive with safeguards | Must avoid cultural conformity |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill Component | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| CLP Status Creation | 9/10 | Strong support | Core priority |
| Interstate Compact | 6/10 | Acceptable | Concern about state variation |
| RID Funding | 8/10 | Support community investment | Adequate funding essential |
| Oversight Office | 8/10 | Support accountability | Civil liberties protections |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Faster path to citizenship with fewer geographic restrictions
- Expanded family reunification categories
- Reduced enforcement footprint
- Higher refugee admissions

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (on RID payments, earned advancement, and civic integration), Centrist (CLP status, RID payments, earned advancement, legacy track, civic integration), Religious Right (on RID payments, earned advancement, and civic integration)
- **Potential bridges:** Progressive (on legalization and legacy), Libertarian (on legalization and legacy), Constitutionalist (on earned advancement), Democratic Socialist (on legalization and legacy)
- **Unlikely partners:** Populist (on legalization and enforcement priorities)

### Progressive Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual priorities | Generally aligned - worker rights, economic justice, and anti-enforcement positions are principled |
| Principle consistency | Consistent - applies worker-first and anti-criminalization values across contexts |
| Goalpost stability | Can be maximalist - sometimes rejects incremental progress as insufficient |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low on immigration itself; some on enforcement |

**Justification:** Progressive immigration positions reflect consistent values around worker rights, decriminalization, and structural analysis. Tendency toward maximalism (rejecting partial victories) is principled rather than strategic, though it can impede coalition-building.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Consistent "abolish ICE" and decriminalization positions
- Support for worker organizing regardless of immigration status
- Criticism of 2013 bill as "too enforcement-heavy" reflects genuine concerns

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strong agreement on chaos and humanitarian crisis |
| Root Cause Agreement | 7/10 | Agree on many causes; may emphasize US foreign policy and economic exploitation more |

**Source references:**

- Congressional Progressive Caucus, "People's Agenda: Immigration" (2023)
- Democratic Socialists of America, "Immigration Justice Platform" (2024)
- United We Dream, "Policy Platform: Communities Not Cages" (2024)

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| CLP Status (legal from day one) | 8/10 | Support legal status | Want faster path to full citizenship |
| Geographic Tiers | 3/10 | Oppose mobility restrictions | View as creating underclass |
| RID Payments | 6/10 | Mixed - support investment, concern about framing | Don't want immigrants portrayed as "burden" |
| Earned Advancement | 4/10 | Oppose conditions on status | Rights should not be "earned" |
| Legacy Track | 9/10 | Essential component | Must be inclusive |
| Enforcement Component | 2/10 | Oppose most enforcement | Decriminalization priority |
| Civic Integration | 5/10 | Concern about coercion | Must be truly voluntary |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill Component | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| CLP Status Creation | 8/10 | Support with reservations | Want unconditional path |
| Interstate Compact | 4/10 | Concern about state variation | Some states hostile |
| RID Funding | 6/10 | Support investment | Framing concerns |
| Oversight Office | 7/10 | Support if strong civil liberties | Accountability essential |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Immediate and unconditional path to citizenship
- Abolish or drastically reduce immigration enforcement
- No geographic or employment restrictions
- Full access to all public benefits from day one

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** None under criteria (overlap with closest perspectives is 2 components)
- **Potential bridges:** Liberal (on legalization and legacy), Libertarian (on legalization and legacy), Centrist (on legalization and legacy), Democratic Socialist (on legalization and legacy)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative, Constitutionalist, Populist, Religious Right (structural opposition on core components)

---

### Libertarian Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual priorities | Highly aligned - free movement and limited government principles consistently applied |
| Principle consistency | Very consistent - applies same principles to immigration as to other policy areas |
| Goalpost stability | Stable - positions have been consistent for decades |
| Zero-sum behavior | None - willing to support partial victories toward more freedom |

**Justification:** Libertarian immigration positions are highly principled and consistent. Support for free movement follows directly from core beliefs about individual liberty and limited government. Unlike other perspectives, libertarians apply the same principles to immigration that they apply elsewhere.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Cato Institute consistent support for expanded immigration
- Libertarian Party platform supporting free movement
- Willingness to ally with left or right on immigration liberalization

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strong agreement that current system is chaotic and harmful |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | Agree restrictions cause most problems; ICS adds more government |

**Source references:**

- Cato Institute, "Cato Handbook for Policymakers: Immigration" (9th ed., 2022)
- Reason Foundation, "Free to Move: Immigration Policy Analysis" (2023)
- Libertarian Party, 2024 Platform, Section 3.4: Free Trade and Migration

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| CLP Status (legal from day one) | 7/10 | Support legal status | Prefer open borders, but this is improvement |
| Geographic Tiers | 3/10 | Oppose mobility restrictions | Government controlling where people live |
| RID Payments | 4/10 | Oppose government spending | Prefer market solutions |
| Earned Advancement | 5/10 | Mixed - prefer no conditions | Less bad than indefinite restrictions |
| Legacy Track | 7/10 | Support legalization | Government should not punish peaceful people |
| Enforcement Component | 4/10 | Oppose most enforcement | Only for genuine criminals |
| Civic Integration | 4/10 | Oppose mandatory elements | Government shouldn't mandate education |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill Component | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| CLP Status Creation | 7/10 | Support as improvement | Less government would be better |
| Interstate Compact | 5/10 | Mixed on federalism | Prefer less government at all levels |
| RID Funding | 3/10 | Oppose tax-funded transfers | Market should allocate |
| Oversight Office | 3/10 | Oppose new bureaucracy | Less government |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Open borders with minimal restrictions
- Private sponsorship replacing government programs
- Market-based work permits
- Elimination of most immigration categories - just let people come

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** None under criteria
- **Potential bridges:** Liberal (on legalization and legacy), Progressive (on legalization and legacy), Centrist (on legalization and legacy), Democratic Socialist (on legalization and legacy)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative, Constitutionalist, Populist, Religious Right (structural opposition and/or consistency gap)

---

### Constitutionalist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual priorities | Generally aligned - genuine concern for constitutional limits |
| Principle consistency | Mostly consistent - applies enumerated powers analysis, though sometimes selectively |
| Goalpost stability | Moderate - concerns about federal overreach are genuine |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low - willing to support constitutionally sound proposals |

**Justification:** Constitutionalist immigration positions reflect genuine concerns about federal power and enumerated authority. ICS's interstate compact structure and state role address some concerns. Occasional selective application (strict on some issues, not others) reduces score slightly.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Consistent concerns about executive overreach (DACA, DAPA)
- Support for state role in immigration enforcement (Arizona v. United States)
- Concern about federal mandates on states

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 7/10 | Agree system is dysfunctional; may emphasize executive overreach more |
| Root Cause Agreement | 6/10 | Agree on some causes; emphasize failure to follow existing law |

**Source references:**

- Federalist Society, "Executive Branch Review: Immigration Authority" (2023)
- Heritage Foundation, "The Constitution and Immigration Enforcement" (2022)
- Texas v. United States, 809 F.3d 134 (5th Cir. 2015) (state sovereignty arguments)

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| CLP Status (legal from day one) | 5/10 | Mixed - concerns about creating new status | Congressional authority questions |
| Geographic Tiers | 6/10 | Appreciate state role | Federalism structure helps |
| RID Payments | 5/10 | Mixed on federal spending | Appropriations Clause concerns |
| Earned Advancement | 7/10 | Support clear statutory framework | Better than executive discretion |
| Legacy Track | 4/10 | Concern about rewarding lawbreaking | Rule of law emphasis |
| Enforcement Component | 8/10 | Support enforcement | Constitutional duty to enforce laws |
| Civic Integration | 6/10 | Support civic education | No ideological mandate |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill Component | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| CLP Status Creation | 5/10 | Acceptable if properly enacted | Congress has plenary power |
| Interstate Compact | 7/10 | Support federalist structure | Aligns with state sovereignty |
| RID Funding | 5/10 | Accept if properly appropriated | Spending Clause compliance |
| Oversight Office | 5/10 | Mixed on new agencies | Separation of powers concerns |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Strict enforcement of existing law first
- State-led initiatives rather than federal expansion
- Clear statutory framework replacing executive discretion
- Interstate compacts with limited federal role

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** None under criteria (overlap with closest perspectives is 2 components)
- **Potential bridges:** Conservative (on enforcement and earned advancement), Liberal (on earned advancement), Centrist (on enforcement and earned advancement), Religious Right (on earned advancement)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive, Libertarian, Populist, Democratic Socialist (structural opposition and/or consistency gap)

---

### Populist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 2/5 - Low Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual priorities | Significant gap - economic concerns stated, but positions persist when economic concerns addressed; polling shows strong correlation with cultural attitudes |
| Principle consistency | Inconsistent - worker protection rhetoric inconsistent with other labor positions |
| Goalpost stability | Unstable - objections shift when concerns addressed ("enforcement first" → "no amnesty ever") |
| Zero-sum behavior | High - oppose any legalization regardless of conditions |

**Justification:** Populist immigration positions cite economic concerns (wage competition, job displacement), but opposition persists even when economic protections are included. Polling consistently shows immigration attitudes in this cohort correlate more strongly with cultural and identity factors than with economic circumstances (Sides et al., 2018; Mutz, 2018).

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Opposition to 2013 bill despite massive enforcement provisions and labor protections
- Worker protection rhetoric not matched by support for other worker protections (e.g., minimum wage, union rights)
- Shifting objections as each stated concern addressed
- Academic research finding cultural threat perception outpredicts economic factors in immigration attitudes

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | Agree on chaos; may overstate immigrant-caused problems |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | Disagree on fundamental causes; blame immigrants rather than system |

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| CLP Status (legal from day one) | 1/10 | Oppose as amnesty | No legalization acceptable |
| Geographic Tiers | 4/10 | Appreciate restrictions | Still creates legal status |
| RID Payments | 5/10 | Mixed - support community compensation | Accepts premise of immigrant presence |
| Earned Advancement | 3/10 | Oppose any path to permanent status | No matter how earned |
| Legacy Track | 1/10 | Strongly oppose | "Reward for lawbreaking" |
| Enforcement Component | 8/10 | Support strong enforcement | Priority, but not sufficient |
| Civic Integration | 6/10 | Support assimilation | Want cultural conformity |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill Component | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| CLP Status Creation | 1/10 | Oppose | Any legalization unacceptable |
| Interstate Compact | 4/10 | Mixed | Creates legal framework they oppose |
| RID Funding | 5/10 | Accept if no legalization | Community compensation acceptable |
| Oversight Office | 4/10 | Mixed | Depends on enforcement focus |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Enforcement-only (no legalization component)
- Reduction in legal immigration levels
- End to family-based immigration ("chain migration")
- Mandatory E-Verify with criminal penalties

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** None on ICS (opposition to any legalization)
- **Potential bridges:** Conservative (on enforcement)
- **Unlikely partners:** Liberal, Progressive, Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Centrist, Religious Right, Democratic Socialist (legalization and/or consistency gap)

---

### Centrist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual priorities | Highly aligned - pragmatic problem-solving is genuine orientation |
| Principle consistency | Consistent - applies pragmatic analysis across issues |
| Goalpost stability | Stable - have consistently sought workable compromise |
| Zero-sum behavior | None - explicitly seeks win-win outcomes |

**Justification:** Centrist immigration positions reflect genuine pragmatism and problem-solving orientation. Willingness to accept elements from across the spectrum, focus on workable implementation, and consistent support for comprehensive approaches demonstrate high engagement consistency.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Bipartisan support for Gang of Eight in Senate
- Think tank focus on implementation feasibility
- Consistent criticism of both maximalist positions

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strong agreement on dysfunction and need for reform |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | Agree on structural causes; ICS analysis aligns well |

| CLP Status (legal from day one) | 8/10 | Support as practical solution | Brings people into system |
| Geographic Tiers | 7/10 | Support structured approach | Workable management |
| RID Payments | 9/10 | Strong support | Addresses local concerns, builds coalition |
| Earned Advancement | 9/10 | Strong support | Clear benchmarks, fair to all |
| Legacy Track | 8/10 | Support | Practical recognition of reality |
| Enforcement Component | 7/10 | Support as part of package | Necessary for coalition |
| Civic Integration | 8/10 | Support with safeguards | Integration promotes success |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill Component | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| CLP Status Creation | 8/10 | Support | Workable solution |
| Interstate Compact | 7/10 | Support federalist approach | State buy-in important |
| RID Funding | 9/10 | Strong support | Key to local buy-in |
| Oversight Office | 8/10 | Support accountability | Essential for public trust |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Would generally support ICS framework with modifications
- Emphasis on pilot testing before full rollout
- Strong metrics and evaluation requirements
- Adjustment mechanisms based on evidence

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberal (CLP status, RID payments, earned advancement, legacy track, civic integration)
- **Potential bridges:** Progressive (on legalization and legacy), Libertarian (on legalization and legacy), Constitutionalist (on enforcement and earned advancement), Democratic Socialist (on legalization and legacy)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative, Populist, Religious Right (consistency gap and/or structural opposition)

### Religious Right Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual priorities | Mixed - genuine humanitarian and family values coexist with political alignment with restrictionists |
| Principle consistency | Inconsistent - "pro-family" values selectively applied to immigration |
| Goalpost stability | Moderate - positions have shifted with political climate |
| Zero-sum behavior | Present in some - alignment with GOP positions regardless of consistency with values |

**Justification:** Religious Right immigration positions reflect genuine tension between humanitarian/family values and political alignment. Evangelical Immigration Table represents principled engagement; other factions prioritize political coalition over consistent values. The internal split is significant.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Evangelical Immigration Table consistent support for reform with family emphasis
- Other evangelical leaders opposing even DACA
- Catholic bishops consistently pro-reform
- Southern Baptist leadership more restrictionist

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 7/10 | Agree system harms families and creates humanitarian crisis |
| Root Cause Agreement | 6/10 | Mixed - some agree on structural causes, others blame individuals |

### Democratic Socialist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual priorities | Aligned - worker solidarity and anti-exploitation positions are genuine |
| Principle consistency | Consistent - applies worker-first lens across contexts |
| Goalpost stability | Somewhat maximalist - may reject incremental progress |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low on immigration; present on enforcement |

**Justification:** Democratic Socialist immigration positions reflect genuine worker solidarity principles. The "no one is illegal" framing follows from class-based analysis. Tendency to oppose any enforcement as inherently oppressive is principled but may impede coalition-building.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- DSA consistent support for worker rights regardless of status
- Opposition to employer-based enforcement as worker-hostile
- Support for union organizing across immigration status

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strong agreement on crisis and structural dysfunction |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | Agree on many causes; emphasize capitalist exploitation |

**Source references:**

- Democratic Socialists of America, "Immigration Justice Committee Platform" (2024)
- Jacobin, "The Case for Open Borders" and immigration coverage (2019-2024)
- Labor Notes, "Immigrant Worker Organizing" reporting series (2022-2024)

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| CLP Status (legal from day one) | 8/10 | Support legal status | Rights should be unconditional |
| Geographic Tiers | 2/10 | Oppose restrictions | Creates worker control mechanism |
| RID Payments | 6/10 | Support investment; concern about framing | Should be universal services |
| Earned Advancement | 3/10 | Oppose conditions | Rights are not earned |
| Legacy Track | 9/10 | Strong support | Essential justice |
| Enforcement Component | 1/10 | Oppose enforcement | Inherently anti-worker |
| Civic Integration | 4/10 | Concern about coercion | Must be purely voluntary |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill Component | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| CLP Status Creation | 8/10 | Support | Less than full rights but improvement |
| Interstate Compact | 4/10 | Concern about variation | Red states will be hostile |
| RID Funding | 6/10 | Support investment | Should be universal |
| Oversight Office | 6/10 | Support | Must protect workers |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Immediate unconditional legalization
- Abolish immigration enforcement
- Universal access to all public services
- Worker-controlled labor standards regardless of status
- Open borders

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** None under criteria (overlap with closest perspectives is 2 components)
- **Potential bridges:** Liberal (on legalization and legacy), Progressive (on legalization and legacy), Libertarian (on legalization and legacy), Centrist (on legalization and legacy)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative, Constitutionalist, Populist, Religious Right (structural opposition and/or consistency gap)

### Engagement Consistency Distribution

| Level | Count | Perspectives |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| 5 - Highly Consistent | 2 | Libertarian, Centrist |
| 4 - Mostly Consistent | 4 | Liberal, Progressive, Constitutionalist, Democratic Socialist |
| 3 - Mixed Consistency | 2 | Conservative, Religious Right |
| 2 - Low Consistency | 1 | Populist |
| 1 - Unpredictable | 0 | None |

**High Consistency Majority:** 6/9 perspectives rated 4 or above

### Common Ground Synthesis

| Reform Element | Broad Support (5+) | Narrow Support (3-4) | Structural Opposition |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Legal status | Lib, Prog, Libt, Cent, DemSoc, RelR (6) | Con, Const (2) | Pop (1) |
| RID community payments | Lib, Cent, Con, RelR (4) | Prog, Pop, Const, DemSoc (4) | Libt (1) |
| Earned advancement | Con, Lib, Cent, RelR, Const (5) | Libt, Prog (2) | Pop, DemSoc (2) |
| Enforcement component | Con, Const, Pop, Cent (4) | Lib, RelR, Libt (3) | Prog, DemSoc (2) |
| Geographic tiers | Con, Cent, Const (3) | Lib, Pop, RelR (3) | Prog, Libt, DemSoc (3) |

**Key insight:** RID payments and earned advancement have broadest support. Geographic tiers are the most divisive element, opposed by both left (as restriction) and libertarian (as government control) perspectives.

## Compromise Proposals

### Interpreting Viability Assessments

**Important caveat:** The "coalition size" metric below counts ideological perspectives, not legislative votes or institutional veto points. Actual enactment requires:

| Factor | Not Captured Here |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Party discipline** | Members vote with leadership regardless of ideological fit |
| **Committee gatekeeping** | Chairs can block floor votes |
| **Filibuster/cloture** | Senate requires 60 votes; ideological support ≠ procedural support |
| **Presidential priorities** | Executive agenda-setting power |
| **Interest group influence** | Organized interests outweigh diffuse ideological sentiment |
| **Electoral timing** | Immigration votes risky in election years |

These assessments indicate potential coalition breadth, not legislative probability. For institutional analysis, see [Political Path](13-political-path.md).

### Compromise 1: Core ICS with Accelerated National Mobility

**Bridges:** Liberal + Centrist + Conservative + Religious Right

**Core Agreement:** Legal status should be immediate; advancement should be earned; communities should be compensated; enforcement should be targeted and humane.

**Policy Description:**

Adopt full ICS framework with modification: reduce Tier B (Corridor) duration from baseline 12-36 months to 6-12 months for participants meeting all benchmarks ahead of schedule. This addresses progressive/liberal concern about prolonged restrictions while maintaining earned advancement that conservatives and centrists support.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | Maintains earned advancement and enforcement; no automatic amnesty |
| Liberal | Legal status from day one; faster path to full mobility |
| Centrist | Structured approach with clear benchmarks |
| Religious Right | Family unity provisions; humanitarian treatment |

**Coalition Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Accept legal status before full "proving period" |
| Liberal | Accept geographic restrictions during initial period |
| Centrist | Accept that some perspectives will not join (imperfect bipartisanship) |
| Religious Right | Accept legalization despite faction opposition |

**Outside Coalition Tradeoffs:**

| Perspective | Why They May Not Join |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Progressive | Must accept that advancement is conditional (not immediate full rights) |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 4/9 perspectives (Constitutionalist is potential 5th if federalism concerns addressed)
- **Consistency Ratio:** 2/4 coalition members rated 4+ consistency (Liberal 4, Centrist 5; Conservative 3, Religious Right 3)
- **Durability:** Moderate - depends on enforcement credibility and community outcomes
- **Implementation Path:** Legislative package with bipartisan Senate support; House requires moderate Republican participation

---

### Compromise 2: ICS Without Geographic Tiers (Service Access Model)

**Bridges:** Progressive + Democratic Socialist + Libertarian + Liberal

**Core Agreement:** Legal status should be immediate and unconditional; mobility should not be restricted; services should be universally accessible.

**Policy Description:**

Adopt CLP status and community compensation without geographic restrictions. Instead of mandatory placement, use service access model: integration services concentrated in hub cities, but participants free to locate anywhere. RID payments to all localities proportional to immigrant population. *(Note: This modifies baseline ICS, which compensates designated host communities for performing integration functions; this compromise extends RID to all localities regardless of corridor participation.)*

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Progressive | No second-class status; full mobility |
| Democratic Socialist | No worker control mechanisms |
| Libertarian | No government-directed placement |
| Liberal | Legal status with robust services |

**Outside Coalition Tradeoffs:**

| Perspective | Why They Cannot Join |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Conservative | No geographic distribution; less community predictability |
| Centrist | Less structured approach; harder to ensure service access |
| Populist | Any legalization remains unacceptable |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 4/9 perspectives
- **Consistency Ratio:** 4/4 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** Low - loses conservative support needed for enactment
- **Implementation Path:** Would require Democratic unified government; unlikely to pass Senate

---

### Compromise 3: Enforcement-First Sequencing with Guaranteed Trigger

**Bridges:** Conservative + Constitutionalist + Centrist + Liberal

**Core Agreement:** Enforcement must be credible; legalization should follow but be guaranteed; the sequence matters for political viability.

**Policy Description:**

Phase implementation: Year 1-2 focuses on enforcement infrastructure, E-Verify, visa tracking. Legalization triggers automatically when enforcement metrics are met. Unlike past "enforcement first" proposals, the trigger is mandatory and non-discretionary, with clear metrics and judicial enforcement.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | Enforcement proves credible before legalization |
| Constitutionalist | Clear statutory framework; limited discretion |
| Centrist | Sequencing makes coalition viable |
| Liberal | Guaranteed pathway - cannot be blocked forever |

**Coalition Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Accept that legalization will eventually happen (trigger is mandatory) |
| Constitutionalist | Accept significant federal role in implementation |
| Centrist | Accept delayed timeline (enforcement-first sequencing) |
| Liberal | Delayed legalization (but guaranteed) |

**Outside Coalition Tradeoffs:**

| Perspective | Why They May Not Join |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Progressive | Must accept enforcement as precondition |
| Democratic Socialist | Must accept that enforcement happens |
| Populist | Must accept that legalization trigger is mandatory |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 4/9 perspectives (Progressive is potential 5th if trigger design trusted)
- **Consistency Ratio:** 3/4 coalition members rated 4+ consistency (Constitutionalist 4, Centrist 5, Liberal 4; Conservative 3)
- **Durability:** Moderate-high if trigger design is robust
- **Implementation Path:** Most likely to achieve 60 Senate votes; requires trust in trigger mechanism

## Strategic Implications

### Most Viable Coalition

The **Liberal-Centrist-Conservative-Religious Right** coalition (Compromise 1) represents the most viable path to enactment:

- 4 perspectives with combined consistency score averaging 3.75/5
- Incorporates elements from each: legal status (L), earned advancement (Con), community compensation (Cent), family unity (RR)
- Has historical precedent in 2013 Gang of Eight (though that failed in House)

### Key Obstacles

1. **Populist opposition** remains structural - no accommodation will satisfy "no legalization ever" position
2. **Progressive opposition to enforcement** may reduce Democratic enthusiasm
3. **Conservative fear of "amnesty" label** requires careful messaging
4. **Geographic tier controversy** divides the coalition that agrees on legal status

### Managing Structural Opposition

Some perspectives have structural opposition to core ICS elements (e.g., any legalization). For these:

- **Identify non-negotiable positions** - distinguish concerns that can be addressed from positions that cannot be accommodated
- **Focus coalition-building elsewhere** - invest negotiating capital where it can yield results
- **Address underlying concerns where possible** - even structurally opposed perspectives may have addressable concerns on specific elements
- **Build sufficient coalition** - design for passage without perspectives whose core requirements contradict ICS fundamentals

### Recommended Approach

1. **Lead with RID payments and earned advancement** - these have broadest support
2. **Modify geographic tiers** - this is the most controversial element; consider compromise of shorter durations or voluntary participation with incentives
3. **Build enforcement credibility** - conservative support requires believing enforcement will actually happen
4. **Protect religious liberty and family unity** - secures Religious Right participation
5. **Accept progressive criticism** - some left opposition is unavoidable; don't dilute enforcement to point of losing conservative support
6. **Pilot first** - builds evidence base and demonstrates workability
7. **Local messengers** - mayors, sheriffs, school superintendents more credible than DC advocates
