### 1. National Overview Map

**Status:** [ ] Not started

**Prompt:** "Clean infographic map of the United States showing the Great Lakes region highlighted in blue, with five hub cities marked as large circles (Buffalo, Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh) and six corridor cities marked as medium circles (Erie, Toledo, Akron, Grand Rapids, Youngstown, Flint). Include a legend showing Hub City, Corridor City, and Future Expansion Zones. Muted colors for non-active regions. Professional policy document style, minimal design, no 3D effects."

### 2. Tiered Progression Flow Diagram

**Status:** [ ] Not started

**Prompt:** "Horizontal flow diagram showing immigration status progression: Phase 0 (Intake) as a small gray box, connecting via arrow to Tier A (Hub City) as a blue circle, connecting to Tier B (Corridor Region) as a larger green oval, connecting to Tier C (National Mobility) represented as a full map outline. Include time indicators: 90 days, 6-12 months, 12-36 months. Clean infographic style with sans-serif labels, white background."

**Target file:** `assets/02-tiered-progression-flow.png`

### 3. Great Lakes Corridor Regional Map

**Status:** [ ] Not started

**Prompt:** "Detailed map of the Great Lakes region (Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, Wisconsin) showing hub cities as large blue pins (Buffalo, Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh) connected by dashed lines to nearby corridor cities as smaller green pins (Erie, Toledo, Akron, Grand Rapids, Youngstown, Flint). Show geographic boundaries as light gray state borders. Include the Great Lakes in light blue. Clean cartographic style suitable for government documents."

### 4. Hub-to-Corridor Expansion Diagram

**Status:** [ ] Not started

**Prompt:** "Concentric zone diagram showing immigration mobility expansion. Center circle labeled 'Hub City' in dark blue, middle ring labeled 'Corridor Region' in medium blue, outer ring labeled 'National Mobility' in light blue. Arrows pointing outward from center through each ring. Include small icons: building for hub, road for corridor, US outline for national. Flat design, policy infographic style."

### 5. Rural Placement Tiers

**Status:** [ ] Not started

**Prompt:** "Three-panel horizontal comparison showing rural settlement types: Left panel shows 'Rural Hub' with small town icon (population 10,000-50,000), center panel shows 'Rural Cluster' with village icon (population 2,500-10,000), right panel shows 'Remote Rural' with single house icon (population under 2,500). Include service availability indicators below each: full services, limited services, mobile services. Simple iconographic style with earth tones."

### 6. Future Corridor Expansion Map

**Status:** [ ] Not started

**Prompt:** "Map of the eastern and central United States showing four future corridor regions as shaded zones: Appalachian Corridor (covering West Virginia, eastern Kentucky, southwestern Virginia) in orange, Upper Midwest Corridor (Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa) in green, Gulf Coast Corridor (Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama coast) in teal, Southern Tier Corridor (upstate New York, northern Pennsylvania) in purple. Great Lakes Corridor shown as established in blue. Clean policy map style with legend."

**Target file:** `assets/06-future-corridor-expansion.png`

### 7. Placement Algorithm Visualization

**Status:** [ ] Not started

**Prompt:** "Flowchart diagram showing placement decision logic: Starting with 'New Participant' box, branching to 'Family Ties?' decision diamond, then to 'Language Match?' and 'Skill Match?' diamonds, each path leading to different hub city assignments shown as endpoint boxes. Include capacity indicators as small bar charts next to each hub. Clean flowchart style with consistent colors, suitable for government documentation."

**Target file:** `assets/07-placement-algorithm.png`

---

### 8. Service Density Gradient

**Status:** [ ] Not started

**Prompt:** "Heat map style visualization of the Great Lakes region showing service density gradient: Hub cities (Buffalo, Cleveland, Detroit, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh) as dark red high-density cores, surrounded by orange medium-density corridor zones, fading to yellow low-density rural areas, and cream-colored remote areas. Include legend showing 'Full Services' to 'Mobile Services Only' gradient. Geographic accuracy for Great Lakes shoreline."

**Target file:** `assets/08-service-density-gradient.png`

---

### 9. Mobility Restriction Comparison

**Status:** [ ] Not started

**Prompt:** "Three-panel comparison showing geographic mobility by tier: Left panel shows Tier A participant restricted to single city (hub city boundary highlighted), center panel shows Tier B participant with access to corridor region (multi-city area highlighted), right panel shows Tier C participant with full US map access. Use consistent figure icon in each panel with movement arrows. Simple flat design, policy document style."

**Target file:** `assets/09-mobility-restriction-comparison.png`

### 10. Integration Timeline Infographic

**Status:** [ ] Not started

**Prompt:** "Horizontal timeline infographic showing ICS progression: Starting point labeled 'Intake (Day 1)', first milestone at '90 days - Hub Placement', second milestone at '6-12 months - Corridor Access', third milestone at '2-3 years - National Mobility', final milestone at '5+ years - Citizenship Eligible'. Use connected dots on timeline with icons above each milestone: intake form, city building, region map, US map, citizenship certificate. Clean modern infographic style."

## Image Generation Notes

### Style Guidelines

- Request "clean," "minimal," or "professional" styling for policy documents
- Avoid photorealistic requests; prefer "infographic," "diagram," or "cartographic" styles
- Specify "no 3D effects" and "white background" for document integration
- Request "sans-serif labels" for readability
- For maps, specify "suitable for government documents" to avoid decorative elements

### File Organization

Images should be saved to an `assets/` subdirectory within the ICS folder once generated.
