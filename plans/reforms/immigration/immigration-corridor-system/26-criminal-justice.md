# Immigration Corridor System: Criminal Justice Interaction

---

## Overview

This document details how CLP holders interact with the criminal justice system, the immigration consequences of criminal conduct, coordination between criminal courts and immigration authorities, and the procedural protections that apply. The system treats CLP holders as subject to the same criminal laws as citizens while imposing additional immigration consequences for serious offenses.
