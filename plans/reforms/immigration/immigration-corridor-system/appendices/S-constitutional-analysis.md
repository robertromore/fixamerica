## Federal Immigration Power

### Constitutional Basis

| Source | Authority |
|--------|-----------|
| **Naturalization Clause** | Art. I, § 8, cl. 4 - Congress can establish "uniform Rule of Naturalization" |
| **Commerce Clause** | Art. I, § 8, cl. 3 - Regulate commerce with foreign nations |
| **Migration Clause** | Art. I, § 9, cl. 1 - Implies federal power over migration |
| **Inherent Sovereignty** | *Chae Chan Ping* (1889) - Immigration as sovereign power |
| **Foreign Affairs** | Art. II - Executive foreign relations power |

### Plenary Power Doctrine

| Principle | Application to ICS |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Broad congressional authority** | Congress can create CLP status and set conditions |
| **Limited judicial review** | Courts defer on substantive immigration policy |
| **Procedural requirements** | Due process still applies to enforcement |
| **Modern limits** | Constitutional rights apply to those within US |

### Key Precedents

| Case | Holding | ICS Implication |
|------|---------|-----------------|
| *Chae Chan Ping v. United States* (1889) | Congress has plenary power over immigration | Supports CLP creation |
| *Kleindienst v. Mandel* (1972) | Limited review of admission decisions | Supports intake criteria |
| *Zadvydas v. Davis* (2001) | Due process limits indefinite detention | ICS avoids prolonged detention |
| *Arizona v. United States* (2012) | Federal preemption of state immigration law | ICS preempts conflicting state law |

## CLP Status Constitutionality

### Congressional Power to Create New Status

## Conclusion

ICS is designed on solid constitutional footing:

1. **Plenary power**: Congress has broad authority over immigration
2. **Due process**: Robust procedural protections throughout
3. **Equal protection**: No classification by race, national origin, or religion
4. **Federalism**: Voluntary state participation; no commandeering
5. **Separation of powers**: Congressional enactment with executive implementation

While legal challenges are inevitable, ICS's statutory basis, procedural protections, and neutral criteria should withstand judicial scrutiny.
