## Overview

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the Immigration Corridor System documentation.

---

## A

**Advance Parole**
Travel authorization allowing Tier C CLP holders to leave and reenter the United States. Does not guarantee reentry.

**Algorithm (Placement)**
The automated system matching CLP participants to hub and corridor cities based on capacity, family connections, language, and employment factors.

**Antifragility**
System design principle where ICS becomes stronger or more adaptive under stress rather than breaking.

---

## B

**Benchmark**
Objective criteria for tier advancement, including language proficiency (CEFR B1), employment/training participation, and law compliance.

**Border Processing Point**
Location at US border where initial ICS intake occurs, including CBP facilities and designated ports of entry.

---

## C

**Capacity Limit**
Maximum number of CLP participants a hub or corridor city can receive, based on housing, school, healthcare, and labor market metrics.

**CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference)**
International standard for language proficiency. ICS requires B1 level (intermediate) for Tier C advancement.

**CLP (Corridor Lawful Presence)**
The new immigration status category created by ICS, providing lawful presence and work authorization with geographic restrictions.

**Compact (Interstate)**
Multi-state agreement for coordinating CLP placement, service delivery, and benefit portability across state lines.

**Corridor City**
Secondary placement location receiving participants after initial hub city stay. Offers continued integration services with broader geographic mobility within the corridor region.

**Credible Fear**
Standard for asylum seekers showing significant possibility of persecution. Positive finding allows full asylum hearing.

---

## D

**Derivative Status**
CLP status granted to spouse and minor children of a principal CLP applicant.

**Due Process**
Constitutional protection ensuring fair procedures before any adverse action, including notice, hearing, and appeal rights.

---

## E

**EL (English Learner)**
School-age children receiving English language instruction. ICS provides surge funding for EL services.

**EMTALA (Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act)**
Federal law requiring emergency rooms to treat all patients regardless of immigration status.

---

## F

**FQHC (Federally Qualified Health Center)**
Community health centers receiving federal funding to serve underserved populations, including CLP participants.

**Fail-Graceful**
Design principle where system failures result in slowdowns rather than collapse or harm to participants.

---

## G

**Go/No-Go Criteria**
Metrics determining whether pilot programs succeed sufficiently to proceed to national rollout.

**Graceful Degradation**
System response to stress that reduces service speed or scope rather than failing entirely.

---

## H

**Hub City**
Initial placement location for CLP participants, offering intensive integration services during Tier A.

**Hold-Harmless**
Federal guarantee that state/local governments won't bear costs exceeding 120% of baseline.

---

## I

**IIOO (Independent Integration Oversight Office)**
Independent agency overseeing ICS implementation, hearing appeals, and publishing accountability reports.

**Intake**
Initial processing phase (Phase 0) lasting up to 90 days, including registration, screening, and placement.

**Interstate Compact**
See "Compact (Interstate)"

---

## L

**Legacy Track**
Pathway for long-term undocumented residents to register for CLP status with modified requirements.

**Load Compensation**
Principle that communities hosting ICS participants receive payment for integration services (see RID).

---

## M

**Mixed-Status Family**
Family unit containing members with different immigration statuses (citizens, LPRs, CLP holders, etc.).

**Modulation**
Adjustment of intake volume based on capacity metrics, slowing arrivals when systems are strained.

---

## O

**Opt-In**
Voluntary participation by cities and states in ICS. No locality is forced to become a hub or corridor.

**Opt-Out**
Process for cities to exit hub or corridor designation with transition support.

---

## P

**Phase 0**
Initial intake period (0-90 days) before hub city placement.

**Placement Algorithm**
See "Algorithm (Placement)"

**Pre-Bunking**
Proactive communication strategy addressing likely misrepresentations before they gain traction.

**Principal**
Primary CLP applicant whose status derivatives (spouse, children) depend upon.

---

## R

**REAL ID**
Federal identification standard. CLP holders may receive REAL ID-compliant documents at state option.

**Red-Team**
Adversarial analysis testing system vulnerabilities and potential failure modes.

**Removal**

**RID (Resident Integration Dividend)**
Payments to eligible residents of hub and corridor cities compensating for hosting integration infrastructure.

---

## S

**Stabilization Grant**
Federal funding to state/local governments for infrastructure expansion (schools, clinics, housing) in corridor areas.

**Surge Mode**
Emergency operating status when intake exceeds normal capacity, activating reserve resources and intake modulation.

**Sunset Review**
Periodic evaluation determining whether hub/corridor designation continues.

---

## T

**Tier A**
Initial CLP status (6-12 months) with mobility limited to hub city metro area.

**Tier B**
Intermediate CLP status (12-24 months) with mobility within corridor region.

**Tier C**
Advanced CLP status with full US geographic mobility and eligibility for permanent residence.

**TVPRA (Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act)**
Federal law providing special protections for unaccompanied minors, including transfer to HHS custody.

---

## U

**UAC/UC (Unaccompanied Child/Minor)**
Minor without parent or legal guardian in the US, subject to special TVPRA protections.
