# Appendix H: Frequently Asked Questions

---

## Overview

This appendix provides official answers to common questions about the Immigration Corridor System.

---

## General Questions

### What is the Immigration Corridor System?

ICS is a comprehensive immigration management system that provides lawful presence to immigrants from day one, structures their integration through designated cities, compensates host communities, and creates a clear path to permanent residence and citizenship.

### Is this amnesty?

No. CLP status is provisional and conditional. Participants must meet benchmarks for language, employment, and law compliance to advance through tiers. Those who fail to meet requirements or commit serious offenses lose status.

### Does ICS create open borders?

No. ICS includes intake caps, capacity limits, and surge modulation. When systems are strained, intake slows. ICS replaces chaos with structure, not enforcement with open entry.

### How is ICS different from current immigration law?

Current law creates binary outcomes (legal or undocumented) with decades-long backlogs. ICS creates immediate lawful status with structured progression and geographic distribution to manage capacity.

## Status and Eligibility

### Who is eligible for CLP status?

Anyone physically present in the United States who:
- Has not been convicted of a felony or three+ misdemeanors
- Is not a security risk
- Registers and agrees to program requirements

### What about people with prior deportation orders?

Those with final removal orders issued after full hearings are generally ineligible. However, individuals may seek reopening if circumstances warrant.

### Can asylum seekers participate?

Yes. CLP provides lawful status while asylum claims are adjudicated separately. Asylum grants lead to asylee status; CLP continues if asylum is denied during appeals.

### What happens to DACA recipients?

DACA recipients can transition to CLP or maintain DACA while it remains in effect. CLP provides a more durable status with a path to permanent residence.

## Geographic Requirements

### Why are there geographic restrictions?

Geographic distribution prevents overconcentration in a few cities, matches capacity to arrivals, and ensures communities can absorb newcomers without strain.

### Can I choose where I live?

The placement algorithm considers preferences, family connections, and skills, but final placement depends on capacity. You can request transfers after initial placement.

### What if I leave my assigned area?

Tier A/B holders who leave their designated area without authorization face tier freezes. Repeated violations can affect advancement. Tier C has no geographic restrictions.

### How do I move from Tier A to Tier B?

Meet benchmarks: maintain residence in hub city, participate in employment or training, make progress on English (toward A2), and avoid legal violations. Advancement is automatic when benchmarks are met.

## Benefits and Services

### Can CLP holders work?

Yes. All CLP holders have work authorization from day one, with no employer-specific restrictions.

### Do CLP holders receive welfare?

Access varies by tier. WIC and school meals are available immediately. Medicaid and SNAP depend on state options. Full federal benefits become available at Tier C and permanent residence.

### What healthcare is available?

All CLP holders have access to ICS-funded community health centers, mental health services, and emergency care. ACA marketplace plans with subsidies are available at Tier A+.

### Can my children attend public school?

Yes. All children have immediate access to public education regardless of status, with additional English learner support through ICS funding.

## Community Impact

### What is the Resident Integration Dividend (RID)?

RID compensates US citizens and permanent residents in hub and corridor cities for hosting integration infrastructure. Payments range from $200-1,500 per household annually.

### Why pay residents? Isn't that a bribe?

RID is load compensation, not persuasion. It recognizes that communities providing national integration services deserve support—similar to payments for military bases or disaster response hosting.

### Will immigrants take jobs from Americans?

ICS includes wage floor protections, sector caps, and displacement mitigation funds. Labor market monitoring ensures immigration complements rather than displaces local workers.

### What about crime?

CLP holders are subject to the same laws as everyone else. Serious offenses result in status revocation and removal. Data shows immigrants generally commit crimes at lower rates than the native-born population.

---

## Path to Citizenship

### How long does it take to become a citizen?

Typical timeline: Tier A (6-12 months) → Tier B (12-24 months) → Tier C (12-24 months) → Permanent Residence (application) → Citizenship (after 5 years as PR). Total: approximately 7-10 years.

### What are the requirements for Tier C?

- Time in Tier B (12-24 months)
- Stable employment or completed training
- CEFR B1 English proficiency
- Completed civic orientation
- No disqualifying conduct

### Can CLP holders sponsor family members?

No. Family sponsorship requires permanent resident or citizen status. However, derivative CLP is available for spouses and minor children present at intake.

### What if I don't want to become a citizen?

Participation is voluntary. CLP holders may remain at any tier indefinitely, though advancement benefits and full mobility require progression.

---

## Enforcement

### Can CLP holders be deported?

Yes, but only after due process. Grounds for removal include serious criminal convictions, fraud, security threats, or persistent non-compliance with program requirements.

### What happens if I lose my job?

Job loss alone doesn't affect CLP status. The benchmark is employment OR training participation. Support services help with job placement.

### What if I can't learn English?

Most participants achieve B1 within 3 years with support. Special accommodations exist for elderly, disabled, or low-literacy learners, including extended timelines.

### Are there immigration raids in corridor cities?

ICS prioritizes integration over enforcement. Worksite enforcement focuses on employer violations, not worker status. Interior enforcement targets serious criminal offenders, not routine CLP holders.

---

## For Employers

### How do I hire CLP workers?

CLP holders have unrestricted work authorization verified through E-Verify. No employer sponsorship or special procedures required.

### Are there incentives for employers?

Yes. Tax credits available for apprenticeships ($2,500-5,000), language training ($1,500), credential recognition ($1,000), and retention bonuses ($500).

### What are employer obligations?

Participating employers must pay living wages, comply with labor laws, not retaliate against workers, and participate in annual compliance certification.

---

## For Local Officials

### How does a city become a hub or corridor?

Cities opt in voluntarily. Federal agencies evaluate capacity (housing, schools, healthcare, jobs) and work with local governments on terms.

### What funding comes with designation?

Hub/corridor cities receive stabilization grants for infrastructure, RID payments flow to residents, and surge funding supports schools and clinics.

### Can a city opt out?

Yes. Opt-out procedures include transition support and infrastructure legacy guarantees. No city is forced to remain in the program.

---

## Technical Questions

### How is the placement algorithm audited?

The Independent Integration Oversight Office audits the algorithm regularly for fairness, disparate impact, and accuracy. Methodology is published for public review.

### What data is collected on participants?

Only data required for placement, eligibility, and compliance. Retention is limited to five years. Participants have access, correction, and dispute rights.

### How are appeals handled?

Appeals go to the Independent Integration Oversight Office, which operates independently from DHS. Decisions can be further appealed to federal court.

---

## Implementation

### When would ICS start?

Full ICS requires legislation. After enactment: Year 1 for rulemaking and pilot launch, Years 2-3 for expansion, Years 3-5 for national coverage.

### What can be done without Congress?

Executive action can implement limited elements (parole authority, enforcement priorities, pilot programs) but cannot create durable CLP status or community compensation.

### How much does ICS cost?

$12-34 billion annually at scale, offset by $9-19 billion in tax revenue and avoided emergency costs. Net federal cost: $3-14 billion depending on intake volume.
