[Date]

The Honorable [Name]
United States Senate / House of Representatives
[Address]

Dear Senator/Representative [Name]:

I write to express my support for [City]'s participation in the Immigration
Corridor System (ICS) and to urge your support for federal ICS legislation.

[City] is well-positioned to serve as a [hub/corridor] city because:

1. CAPACITY: We have [housing availability, school capacity, healthcare
   infrastructure] to accommodate new residents.

2. ECONOMIC NEED: Our community has [labor shortages, population decline,
   economic development needs] that ICS participants could help address.

3. COMMUNITY READINESS: Our residents support orderly immigration through
   the Resident Integration Dividend program.

Federal ICS funding would provide [City] with:
- $[X] in stabilization grants for [infrastructure improvements]
- $[X] in EL surge funding for our schools
- $[X] in RID payments to our residents

I urge you to support ICS legislation and [City]'s designation as a
[hub/corridor] city.

Sincerely,

[Mayor Name]
Mayor, City of [City]

[Organization Letterhead]

[Date]

The Honorable [Name]
[Address]

Dear [Title] [Name]:

On behalf of [Chamber of Commerce / Business Association], representing
[X] businesses and [X] employees in [region], I write to support the
Immigration Corridor System.

Our members face critical workforce shortages in:
- [Sector 1]: [X] unfilled positions
- [Sector 2]: [X] unfilled positions
- [Sector 3]: [X] unfilled positions

ICS would benefit our business community by:

1. LEGAL WORKFORCE: Providing work-authorized employees our members can
   hire without legal uncertainty.

2. SKILLS PIPELINE: Creating apprenticeship pathways in [sectors].

3. REDUCED TURNOVER: Stable immigration status reduces workforce disruption.

4. TAX INCENTIVES: Credits for language training and apprenticeships help
   offset integration costs.

Our members are prepared to participate as registered employers and
contribute to integration success.

We urge your support for ICS legislation.

Sincerely,

[Name]
President/CEO, [Organization]
