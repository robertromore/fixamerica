# Appendix D: Cost Methodology

---

## Overview

This appendix explains the methodology used to estimate ICS costs and revenue offsets. All estimates use conservative assumptions to avoid overstating benefits or understating costs.

---

## Estimation Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Conservative assumptions** | Err toward overestimating costs and underestimating offsets |
| **Scenario bands** | Present ranges, not point estimates |
| **Sensitivity analysis** | Identify which assumptions drive results |
| **Comparable programs** | Use existing program costs as benchmarks |
| **Inflation adjustment** | All figures in current-year dollars |

## Data Sources

| Source | Use |
|--------|-----|
| **CBO immigration reports** | Tax offset estimates |
| **USCIS fee study** | Processing costs |
| **HUD grant data** | Housing program costs |
| **BLS wage data** | Wage assumptions |
| **DOL apprenticeship reports** | Workforce costs |
| **GAO immigration reports** | Current system costs |

## Limitations and Caveats

1. **Behavioral responses** - Estimates assume no major behavioral changes from employers or participants
2. **Economic conditions** - Costs and offsets sensitive to labor market conditions
3. **State variation** - Significant variation expected across states and cities
4. **Dynamic effects** - Long-term economic effects (entrepreneurship, innovation) not included
5. **Political sustainability** - Estimates assume stable funding over planning horizon
