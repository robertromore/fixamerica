# Appendix T: Transition Scenarios

---

## Overview

This appendix analyzes how ICS survives changes in political control, including hostile administration transitions, congressional opposition, and potential program termination. The system is designed for political durability through structural safeguards.

## Political Risk Assessment

### Transition Points

| Transition | Risk Level | Key Vulnerabilities |
|------------|------------|---------------------|
| **Presidential election (same party)** | Low | Policy continuity expected |
| **Presidential election (different party)** | Medium-High | Executive discretion; priorities |
| **Midterm (Congress flips)** | Medium | Appropriations; oversight |
| **Judicial shift** | Medium | Constitutional challenges |
| **State government change** | Variable | Compact participation |

### Historical Precedents

| Program | Political Fate | Lessons |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| **IRCA (1986)** | Survived; employer provisions weakened | Statutory basis matters |
| **DACA** | Rescission attempted; litigation | Executive action vulnerable |
| **TPS** | Repeated termination attempts | Designations can be revoked |
| **ACA** | Survived repeal attempts | Statutory entrenchment works |
| **Welfare reform** | States adapted differently | Block grants allow variation |

## Scenario 1: Hostile Administration

### Scenario Description

New administration opposes ICS but cannot repeal statute (congressional gridlock).

### Executive Actions Available

| Action | Legal Basis | ICS Defense |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| **Reduced enforcement** | Prosecutorial discretion | Statutory mandates limit discretion |
| **Slow-walk implementation** | Administrative delay | Statutory deadlines; court orders |
| **Narrow interpretation** | Regulatory discretion | APA procedural requirements |
| **Deny resources** | Executive management | Congressional appropriations protect |
| **Hostile rulemaking** | Regulatory authority | Notice and comment; judicial review |

### Defensive Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Operation |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Statutory mandates** | "Shall" language compels action |
| **Appropriations** | Dedicated funding; fencing |
| **Consent decrees** | Court oversight of implementation |
| **State partners** | States can continue programs |
| **Private right of action** | Participants can enforce rights |
| **Inspector General** | Independent oversight |

### Likely Battlegrounds

| Area | Attack Vector | Defense |
|------|---------------|---------|
| **Intake volume** | Slow processing | Statutory timelines |
| **Tier advancement** | Deny advancement | Clear criteria; appeals |
| **Legacy track** | Close registration | Statutory window |
| **Benefits** | Reduce access | Statutory minimums |
| **Enforcement** | Aggressive revocation | Due process requirements |

---

## Scenario 2: Congressional Defunding

### Scenario Description

Congress reduces or eliminates ICS appropriations.

### Defunding Options

| Option | Likelihood | Impact |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **Full zeroing** | Low | Program terminates |
| **Significant cuts (50%+)** | Low-Medium | Major reduction in services |
| **Moderate cuts (20-50%)** | Medium | Prioritization required |
| **Targeted cuts** | Medium-High | Specific programs eliminated |
| **Riders** | High | Policy restrictions attached |

### Response by Cut Level

| Cut Level | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **<20%** | Efficiency measures; prioritization |
| **20-40%** | Essential services only; hiring freeze |
| **40-60%** | Major service reductions; hub consolidation |
| **>60%** | Emergency operations only |
| **Full defunding** | Orderly wind-down; status protection |

### Status Protection During Defunding

| Protection | Mechanism |
|------------|-----------|
| **CLP status continues** | Status is statutory, not appropriated |
| **Work authorization** | Inherent in CLP; no additional funding needed |
| **Due process** | Constitutional requirement; courts enforce |
| **No mass removal** | Resource constraints; prioritization |

### Bridge Funding Options

| Source | Potential |
|--------|-----------|
| **State contributions** | States may fund continued services |
| **Philanthropy** | Foundation support for legal services |
| **Fees** | User fees for some services |
| **Court orders** | Litigation may require minimal funding |

---

## Scenario 3: Statutory Repeal

### Scenario Description

Congress passes and President signs ICS repeal.

### Repeal Options

| Option | Difficulty | Effect |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **Full repeal** | High (requires majority + signature) | Program terminates |
| **Prospective only** | Medium | No new CLP; existing protected |
| **With transition** | Medium | Orderly wind-down |
| **With status conversion** | Medium | CLP → other status |

### Participant Protection in Repeal

| Provision | Protection |
|-----------|------------|
| **Grandfather clause** | Existing CLP holders retain status |
| **Transition period** | 2-5 years to complete pathway |
| **Status conversion** | Option to convert to other status |
| **Earned credit** | Time counts toward future status |

### Model Repeal Provisions

```text
TRANSITION UPON REPEAL

Section _. Status Protection.
(a) Any individual holding CLP status on the date of enactment of this
    repeal shall retain such status until—
    (1) the individual achieves permanent resident status;
    (2) the individual's CLP status is revoked under procedures
        in effect prior to repeal; or
    (3) five years after the date of enactment of this repeal.

(b) During the transition period, all services and benefits available
    to CLP holders shall continue.

(c) At the conclusion of the transition period, any CLP holder who
    has not achieved permanent resident status may apply for other
    available relief.
```

|------|----------|--------|
| **Notice** | Day 0 | State provides 180-day notice |
| **Assessment** | Days 1-30 | Federal assessment of affected participants |
| **Options** | Days 30-60 | Participants offered relocation or federal services |
| **Transition** | Days 60-180 | Orderly transition |
| **Effective** | Day 180 | State exits compact |

### Federal Response to State Withdrawal

| If State Withdraws | Federal Action |
|--------------------|----------------|
| **Single state** | Federal direct services; relocation options |
