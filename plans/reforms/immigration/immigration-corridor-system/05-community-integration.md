# Immigration Corridor System: Community Integration

---

## Overview

Successful immigration integration requires both newcomer effort and community support. This section covers how ICS builds host community buy-in through direct compensation and structured engagement opportunities.

---

## Resident Integration Dividend (RID)

### Purpose

Compensate residents for civic load and reward cooperation without demanding belief in immigration policy.

### Formula

```text
RID = Base + Exposure + Participation
```

### Base Component (Automatic)

All residents of designated hub/corridor zones receive base compensation for population impact.

| Factor | Measurement |
|--------|-------------|
| **Population impact** | Per-capita allocation based on corridor participant density |

### Exposure Component

Tied to objective strain metrics:

| Metric | Measurement |
|--------|-------------|
| **Housing pressure** | Vacancy rate changes; rent growth |
| **School enrollment delta** | EL student growth vs. capacity |
| **Transit load** | Ridership increases vs. capacity |
| **Clinic utilization** | Patient volume vs. staffed capacity |

### Participation Component (Optional)

Paid, verified activities that support integration:

| Activity | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Tutoring** | Verified hours with corridor participants |
| **Mentoring** | Structured mentorship programs |
| **Compliant renting** | Certified landlords meeting quality standards |
| **Civic hosting** | Community orientation activities |

### RID Payment Structure

| Component | Annual Value | Eligibility |
|-----------|--------------|-------------|
| **Base payment** | $200-400/household | All residents in designated zones |
| **Exposure adjustment** | $100-300/household | Tied to capacity stress metrics |
| **Participation bonus** | $50-200/activity | Tutoring, mentoring, compliant renting |
| **Maximum per household** | $1,500/year | Anti-concentration cap |

### Delivery Methods

RID is delivered as non-cash benefits only:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Tax credits** | Refundable federal/state tax credits |
| **Utilities** | Direct offset on utility bills |
| **Transit** | Free or subsidized transit passes |

### Anti-Fraud Measures

| Measure | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|

## Host Community Strategy

### Community Engagement Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Transparency** | Public data on placements, costs, and benefits |
| **Reciprocity** | Communities receive measurable benefits for hosting |
| **Voice** | Local input into corridor designation and capacity limits |
| **Accountability** | Clear metrics and consequences for program failures |

### Local Government Partnership

| Level | Role |
|-------|------|
| **Mayors** | Corridor designation decisions; service coordination |
| **County executives** | Social services coordination; health department integration |
| **School boards** | EL capacity planning; school-based services |
| **City councils** | Zoning; landlord certification; local RID implementation |

### Community Capacity Building

| Program | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Community liaison officers** | Bridge between corridor participants and neighborhoods |
| **Welcome centers** | Orientation for both newcomers and longtime residents |
| **Intercultural programming** | Community events; shared activities |

## Assimilation Standards

### Minimum Viable Assimilation

ICS defines assimilation objectively, without cultural or ideological requirements:

| Standard | Measurement |
|----------|-------------|
| **Functional language** | CEFR B1 or equivalent; alternative pathway for disability/elderly |
| **Law compliance** | No violent felony; misdemeanor thresholds defined by statute |
| **Economic participation** | Employment, training, or documented exemption |
| **No violent extremism** | No material support for designated violent groups |

### What Is NOT Required

| Not Required | Reason |
|--------------|--------|
| **Cultural assimilation** | No food, dress, or social customs requirements |
| **Political agreement** | No ideological tests |
| **Religious conformity** | Freedom of religion protected |
| **Intermarriage** | Personal choices not regulated |

### Failure Categories

| Category | Pathway |
|----------|---------|
| **Structural barriers** | Accommodation; enhanced support |
| **Social disengagement** | Structured escalation; case management |
| **Coercive or violent conduct** | Civic boundary enforcement |
| **Criminal harm** | Standard justice + immigration consequences |

### Escalation Model

All failures are handled through a graduated process:

- **Gradual:** Escalation steps are incremental
- **Documented:** All actions are recorded
- **Appealable:** Due process at every stage
- **Reversible:** Return to good standing possible

See [10-enforcement.md](10-enforcement.md) for full failure handling and removal pathways.
