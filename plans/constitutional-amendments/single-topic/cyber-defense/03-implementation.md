---

## Compliance Considerations

### Intelligence Community

**Required Changes**:

- All domestic surveillance activities must have judicial authorization
- Intelligence arrangements with foreign entities must be reported
- Detailed logs of surveillance activities must be maintained
- Cooperation with Board audits is mandatory

**Transition Period**:

- Existing programs reviewed within two years
- Non-compliant programs must be modified or terminated
- No grandfathering of unconstitutional activities

### Private Sector

**Platform Operators**:

- Must implement foreign state media labeling
- Must disclose algorithmic amplification patterns
- Must provide researcher access to specified data
- Must report detected foreign influence operations

**Critical Infrastructure Operators**:

- Must report significant breaches within 72 hours
- Must meet minimum security standards
- Must cooperate with federal coordination
- Protected from liability when complying with federal requirements

### State Governments

**Election Systems**:

- Federal cannot assume control except in declared emergencies
- States retain primary responsibility for election security
- Federal provides technical assistance and threat intelligence
- State-federal coordination required for cross-state threats

## Enforcement Framework

### Board Enforcement

**Available Actions**:

1. Cease-and-desist orders (immediate effect)
2. Referral to DOJ for prosecution
3. Recommendation for discipline/removal
4. Damages awards from agency budgets
5. Required destruction of improperly obtained information

**Appeal Process**:

1. Agency receives cease-and-desist order
2. May appeal to FISA Court within 7 days
3. FISA Court rules within 7 additional days
4. National security claims don't delay investigation
5. Chief Justice resolves access disputes within 48 hours

### Criminal Enforcement

**Violations Subject to Prosecution**:

- Unauthorized domestic surveillance
- Retaliation against whistleblowers
- Obstruction of Board investigations
- False statements to Board
- Failure to report required intelligence arrangements

### Civil Enforcement

**Private Rights of Action**:

- Victims of unlawful surveillance may sue
- Damages awarded from agency budgets
- Attorney's fees for prevailing plaintiffs

---

## Metrics for Success

### Surveillance Oversight

- Number of Board audits conducted annually
- Violations discovered and remediated
- Whistleblower reports processed
- Cease-and-desist orders issued
- Compliance rate with reporting requirements

### Infrastructure Protection

- Breaches reported vs. estimated total
- Response time to incidents
- Federal-state coordination effectiveness
- Private sector compliance rate

### Foreign Operations Transparency

- Platform compliance with labeling requirements
- Foreign advertising disclosures
- Researcher access provided
- Detected influence operations reported

---

## Potential Challenges

### Classification Disputes

**Challenge**: Agencies claim Board cannot access classified materials

**Response**: Amendment explicitly grants access; Chief Justice resolves disputes within 48 hours; pattern of obstruction is itself a violation

### Resource Constraints

**Challenge**: Board lacks capacity for comprehensive oversight

**Response**: Mandatory funding cannot be reduced; random audit approach (5% minimum) provides deterrent effect; complaints prioritize resources

### Platform Resistance

**Challenge**: Platforms claim First Amendment protection against disclosure

**Response**: Requirements are disclosure, not censorship; similar to financial disclosure requirements; platforms remain free to host any content

### International Coordination

**Challenge**: Foreign information operations require international response

**Response**: Amendment addresses domestic transparency; doesn't preclude international coordination; federal foreign policy authority preserved
