# Federal Reserve Reform Plan

## Overview

This plan proposes a constitutional amendment to protect Federal Reserve independence while ensuring appropriate accountability. The reform addresses growing threats to monetary policy independence from political pressure.

## The Problem

The Federal Reserve's independence faces escalating threats:

- **Presidential pressure**: Presidents increasingly demand specific interest rate policies
- **Congressional threats**: Proposals to "audit the Fed" or subject policy to legislative veto
- **Removal threats**: Suggestions that Fed chairs can be fired for policy disagreements
- **Politicization**: Appointments increasingly viewed through partisan lens
- **Credibility erosion**: Markets question whether Fed can resist political pressure

Central bank independence is strongly correlated with low inflation and economic stability. Erosion of independence risks:

- Higher inflation expectations
- More volatile interest rates
- Reduced policy credibility
- Currency instability

## The Solution

This plan proposes a constitutional amendment establishing:

1. **Independence Guarantee**: Constitutional protection for monetary policy independence
2. **Dual Mandate**: Codified objectives (price stability, employment, financial stability)
3. **Governance Protections**: Fourteen-year terms, for-cause removal only
4. **Presidential Prohibitions**: Bars public demands for rate changes
5. **Congressional Limits**: Prevents legislative veto of monetary policy
6. **Fed Prohibitions**: Bars political lending or direct Treasury purchases
7. **Transparency Requirements**: Disclosure mandates without compromising deliberation
8. **Emergency Powers**: Framework for crisis response with accountability
9. **Regional Structure**: Preserves geographic diversity in Reserve Banks

## Why Constitutional?

Statutory protections for Fed independence can be repealed by simple majorities. A constitutional amendment:

- Signals permanent commitment to independence
- Raises the bar for political interference
- Anchors inflation expectations
- Provides legal basis to resist improper pressure
- Protects against erosion during crises

## Standalone vs. Integrated

This reform can work:

- **Standalone**: As a single-subject constitutional amendment
- **With Regional Federalism**: As part of the broader Regional Federal Constitution (where it originated as Article XI)
- **With other reforms**: Combined with fiscal responsibility or economic reforms
