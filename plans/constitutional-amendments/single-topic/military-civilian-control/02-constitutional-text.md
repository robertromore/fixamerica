# Military Civilian Control Constitutional Amendment

## Proposed Amendment Text

---

### Section 1. Civilian Supremacy

(a) The Armed Forces of the United States are under civilian control. The President is Commander-in-Chief.

(b) No member of the Armed Forces on active duty may exercise governmental authority except as authorized by law for military purposes.

(c) Military officers may not be appointed to civilian executive positions requiring Senate confirmation until five years after leaving active duty.

---

### Section 2. Domestic Deployment Limits

(a) The Armed Forces of the United States are organized for external defense. Domestic deployment is exceptional and limited.

(b) Domestic deployment of federal armed forces requires authorization by two independent civilian authorities:

- Key 1: The President of the United States.
- Key 2: A majority of State Governors.

(c) If the President is a party to the constitutional crisis necessitating domestic deployment, the authorization keys shall be:

- Key 1: The Chief Justice of the United States (procedural certification only, not policy approval).
- Key 2: A majority of State Governors.

(d) Each keyholder must act within forty-eight hours of a formal request. If any keyholder fails to act within this period, authority to authorize lapses and a new request must be initiated.

(e) All authorizations must be in writing, must specify the scope, duration, and geographic limits of deployment, and must be made public within seventy-two hours.

(f) Domestic deployment authority expires automatically after thirty days unless reauthorized through the same two-key process.

(g) Legislative Override. If Key 2 fails due to Governor refusal:

- the President may request authorization from Congress,
- authorization requires approval by two-thirds of both chambers,
- this override is available only for deployment requests that specify a limited geographic scope and duration not exceeding fourteen days.

(h) Judicial Emergency Certificate. In cases of imminent constitutional emergency where both Governors and Congress are unavailable or obstructed:

- the Chief Justice may issue an Emergency Authorization Certificate permitting deployment for up to seventy-two hours,
- such certificate requires written findings that: (i) an imminent threat to constitutional order exists, (ii) normal authorization channels are unavailable, and (iii) deployment is the minimum necessary response,
- deployment under such certificate may not be renewed; full two-key authorization must be obtained for any continuation,
- the certificate must be published immediately upon issuance.

### Section 3. Duty to Refuse Unlawful Orders

(a) All service members have a constitutional duty to refuse orders that are manifestly unlawful.

(b) Manifestly unlawful orders include orders to:

- attack, detain, or use force against lawful political activity,
- interfere with elections or prevent transfer of power following certified election results,
- use military force against civilians except in response to armed resistance,
- violate the laws of war or international humanitarian law.

(c) Service members who refuse manifestly unlawful orders in good faith are protected from adverse action.

(d) No service member may be punished for seeking legal review of an order's lawfulness before execution, provided the delay does not cause imminent harm.

---

### Section 4. National Guard

(a) The National Guard of the several States may be called into federal service:

- upon declaration of war by Congress,
- upon authorization for use of military force approved by two-thirds of the House and Senate,
- for domestic deployment pursuant to the two-key authorization of Section 2.

(b) When called into federal service, National Guard units are commanded by the President through the chain of command.

(c) Federalization for domestic purposes may not exceed ninety days without consent of the affected States' Governors.

(d) A Governor may refuse federalization of that State's National Guard if:

- no two-key authorization has been obtained under Section 2, or
- the federalization order directs action against that Governor's own State.

(e) State Defense Forces under exclusive State control may be maintained and are not subject to federalization.

(b) Congress shall receive immediate notification of any domestic deployment.

(c) Within ninety days of conclusion of any domestic deployment, the President shall submit a report to Congress detailing:

- costs incurred,
- assessment of necessity and proportionality.

(d) Congress may by resolution terminate any domestic deployment by majority vote of both chambers.

---

### Section 7. Enforcement

(a) Any person subject to unlawful military action may seek injunctive relief in federal court.

---

### Section 8. Congressional Enforcement

Congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.

## Commentary

### Why Two-Key Authorization?

The core innovation of this amendment is requiring two independent civilian authorities to authorize domestic military deployment. This prevents:

- **Autocratic seizure**: A president cannot use military to seize power alone
- **Single-point failure**: One corrupted official cannot deploy military
- **Partisan abuse**: Broader consensus required for domestic deployment

The Governor majority requirement ensures:

- Geographic representation
- State-level check on federal power
- Multiple independent decisions

### Section-by-Section Analysis

**Section 1 (Civilian Supremacy)**: Codifies the principle that military serves civilian authority. The five-year cooling-off period for appointments to civilian positions prevents military officers from immediately converting military prestige into political power.

**Section 2 (Domestic Deployment)**: The two-key system requires both President and majority of Governors (or alternative authorities in specified circumstances). Automatic thirty-day expiration prevents indefinite deployment.

**Section 3 (Duty to Refuse)**: Constitutionalizes the existing military justice principle that service members must refuse manifestly unlawful orders. Provides explicit protection for those who do. Enumerates specific categories of manifestly unlawful orders.

**Section 4 (National Guard)**: Limits federalization to war, AUMF, or two-key domestic authorization. Ninety-day limit without state consent. Governors can refuse federalization for action against their own states.

**Section 5 (Prohibited Uses)**: Categorical prohibitions on most dangerous uses: election interference, suppressing political activity, preventing power transfer. These apply regardless of authorization.

**Section 6 (Transparency)**: Publication requirements, congressional notification, post-deployment reporting. Congress can terminate deployment by majority vote.

**Section 7 (Enforcement)**: Private right of action, de novo judicial review, personal liability for unlawful deployment.

### Comparison to Current Law

| Feature | Current Law | Proposed Amendment |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Domestic deployment | Presidential discretion + Insurrection Act | Two-key authorization |
| Duration | No limit | Thirty days, renewable |
| Duty to refuse | UCMJ interpretation | Constitutional duty |
| National Guard federalization | Presidential discretion | War/AUMF/two-key only |
| Election interference | Prohibited by norm | Constitutional prohibition |
| Transparency | Limited | Mandatory publication |

### Potential Objections

**"This hampers emergency response"**: The amendment permits rapid response (seventy-two hour emergency certificate). Two-key authorization can be obtained quickly for genuine emergencies.

**"Governors shouldn't control federal military"**: Governors don't command; they authorize or not. This is a check, not a transfer of command.

**"Duty to refuse is dangerous"**: Service members already have this duty under military justice. Constitutional protection reduces the risk that they'll follow unlawful orders out of fear.

**"This prevents legitimate law enforcement"**: The Posse Comitatus Act already limits military law enforcement. This amendment adds procedural requirements, not new prohibitions.

### Relationship to Regional Federalism

This amendment originated as Article XV of the Regional Federal Constitution. The Regional version includes:

- Regional Guard Forces (in addition to National Guard)
- Regional Governors as Key 2 (instead of State Governors)
- More detailed federalization limits

The standalone version uses State Governors and existing National Guard structure. Either version protects civilian control.
