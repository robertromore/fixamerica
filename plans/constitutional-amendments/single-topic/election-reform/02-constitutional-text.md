# Election Reform Constitutional Amendment

## Proposed Amendment Text

---

### Section 1. National Popular Vote

(a) The President shall be elected by national popular vote.

(b) The winning candidate must receive a majority of votes cast. If no candidate achieves a majority in the initial count, Congress shall by statute provide a mechanism to determine a majority winner, which may include but is not limited to ranked-choice voting, runoff elections, or other methods that ensure majority support.

(c) No single state may veto the national outcome. State vote totals shall be aggregated nationally; state allocation or weighting of electoral votes is abolished.

(d) In the event of an exact tie in the national popular vote, the House of Representatives shall elect the President by a vote in which each Representative casts one vote (not one vote per state delegation).

---

### Section 2. Election Administration

(a) Federal elections shall be administered by the States under uniform constitutional standards established by this Article and by statute.

(b) Congress may establish uniform standards for voter registration, ballot access, voting procedures, and vote counting for federal elections.

(c) States shall provide for early voting, absentee voting, and same-day registration for federal elections unless Congress provides otherwise by statute.

---

### Section 3. Rule Stability

Election rules may not be altered within ninety days prior to any federal election. Changes enacted within this blackout period are void and unenforceable.

---

### Section 4. Certification

(a) Election certification authority resides in State institutions.

(b) Each State shall certify its results within fourteen days of the election.

(c) National certification shall occur within twenty-one days of the election.

(d) If a State fails to certify within the required period and no dispute is pending before a court, the results as tabulated by the State election authority shall be deemed certified automatically.

(e) No single jurisdiction may veto national outcomes.

---

### Section 5. Expedited Dispute Resolution

(a) Election disputes affecting presidential or congressional certification shall be resolved as follows:

- State courts shall issue rulings within seven days of dispute filing,
- Appeals to State Supreme Courts shall be decided within seven additional days,
- Final appeals to the Supreme Court shall be decided within seven additional days.

(b) Automatic Interim Certification. If any court misses the deadlines specified in subsection (a):

- the results as tabulated shall be provisionally certified for purposes of national certification,
- the court's eventual ruling, if it changes the outcome, shall take effect prospectively,
- no provisional certification may be reversed after inauguration except through impeachment or subsequent election.

(c) Dispute Deadline. No election dispute may be filed more than fourteen days after the election. Disputes filed after this deadline are void.

---

### Section 6. Caretaker Governance

(a) In the event of unresolved disputes, caretaker governance shall continue with limited authority until lawful resolution. Caretaker authority extends only to routine operations and may not include new policy initiatives, appointments to lifetime positions, or military deployments except in response to imminent threat.

(b) Caretaker authority under this section terminates automatically forty-five days after the scheduled inauguration date. If no lawful successor has been determined by that date, the Speaker of the House shall assume acting executive authority pending resolution, subject to caretaker limitations.

### Section 7. Transition Requirements

(a) Upon certification of election results, the President-elect shall have access to:

- transition funding appropriated by Congress,
- security briefings at the same classification level as the incumbent,
- cooperation from executive agencies regarding transition planning.

(b) The incumbent President may not withhold transition resources or information from a certified President-elect.

(c) Violation of this section is a high crime and misdemeanor.

---

### Section 8. Abolition of Electoral College

(a) The Electoral College established by Article II, Section 1 and the Twelfth Amendment is hereby abolished.

(b) References to "Electors" in the Constitution shall have no further effect with respect to presidential elections.

(c) The Twenty-Third Amendment (D.C. electoral votes) is superseded by this Article; D.C. residents vote directly for President.

---

### Section 9. Congressional Enforcement

Congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.

## Commentary

### Why National Popular Vote?

The Electoral College has failed its original purposes:

- **Original purpose (1787)**: Deliberation by informed electors - now purely ministerial
- **Federalism**: States have equal representation in Senate; presidency should represent national majority
- **Legitimacy**: Five times the popular vote winner lost (1824, 1876, 1888, 2000, 2016)
- **Campaign distortion**: Only "swing states" receive attention

National popular vote ensures:

- Every vote counts equally
- Winner has majority support
- Campaigns address entire nation
- Legitimacy of outcome

### Section-by-Section Analysis

**Section 1 (Popular Vote)**: Direct election with majority requirement. Tie-breaker in House by individual vote (not state delegation). Prevents regional manipulation.

**Section 2 (Administration)**: States administer with federal standards. Congress may establish uniform rules. Voter access requirements.

**Section 3 (Rule Stability)**: Ninety-day blackout prevents last-minute manipulation. Changes during blackout are void.

**Section 4 (Certification)**: Mandatory timelines: fourteen days for states, twenty-one days national. Automatic certification if officials fail to act.

**Section 5 (Disputes)**: Seven-day deadlines at each level (21 days total). Courts that miss deadlines don't control outcome. Fourteen-day filing deadline.

**Section 6 (Caretaker)**: Limited authority during disputes. Clear succession if dispute extends past inauguration. Prevents constitutional crisis.

**Section 7 (Transition)**: Enforceable transition requirements. Withholding cooperation is impeachable.

**Section 8 (Abolition)**: Explicitly abolishes Electoral College. Supersedes relevant portions of Article II and Twelfth Amendment.

### Comparison to Current System

| Feature | Current System | Proposed Amendment |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Selection method | Electoral College | National popular vote |
| Winner determination | 270 electoral votes | Majority of popular vote |
| State certification deadline | Varies by state | 14 days mandatory |
| Dispute timeline | No deadline | 21 days maximum |
| Disputed transition | No rules | Caretaker governance |
| Transition cooperation | Norm-based | Constitutional requirement |

### Potential Objections

**"This abolishes federalism"**: Federalism is preserved in Congress (Senate represents states). Presidency should represent national majority.

**"Small states will be ignored"**: Currently, non-swing states are ignored regardless of size. National popular vote means every voter matters.

**"Courts can't decide in seven days"**: Bush v. Gore was decided in less time. Mandatory deadlines prevent delay tactics.

**"Automatic certification is dangerous"**: The alternative - allowing officials to block certification indefinitely - is more dangerous.

### Relationship to Regional Federalism

This amendment originated as Article VII of the Regional Federal Constitution. The Regional version includes:

- Regional election administration (instead of state)
- Regional courts for disputes
- National Election Court

The standalone version uses existing state/federal court structure. Either version establishes national popular vote and certification timelines.
