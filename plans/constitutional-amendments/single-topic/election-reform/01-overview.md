# Election Reform Plan

## Overview

This plan proposes a constitutional amendment reforming presidential elections, establishing certification timelines, creating expedited dispute resolution, and providing for caretaker governance during disputed transitions.

## The Problem

American elections face structural threats:

- **Electoral College distortions**: Popular vote loser can win presidency
- **Certification manipulation**: 2020 showed officials can delay or refuse certification
- **No dispute deadlines**: Courts can take months to resolve election cases
- **Transition vulnerability**: No clear rules for disputed transitions
- **Rule manipulation**: Last-minute election rule changes create confusion

The 2020-2021 transition crisis revealed:

- State officials may refuse to certify
- Courts lack mandatory timelines
- Congressional certification can be disrupted
- No clear succession if dispute is unresolved

## The Solution

This plan proposes a constitutional amendment establishing:

1. **National Popular Vote**: Direct election of President
2. **Certification Timelines**: Mandatory deadlines for state/national certification
3. **Automatic Certification**: Results certified if officials fail to act
4. **Expedited Courts**: Seven-day deadlines at each judicial level
5. **Dispute Deadline**: Fourteen days to file challenges
6. **Rule Stability**: No election rule changes within ninety days
7. **Caretaker Governance**: Limited authority during disputes
8. **Automatic Succession**: Clear rules if dispute extends past inauguration

## Why Constitutional?

Statutory election reforms are vulnerable:

- State legislatures control their own election laws
- Congress can change election procedures by majority vote
- Courts interpret statutes narrowly
- Norms can be violated without legal consequence

A constitutional amendment:

- Binds state and federal officials
- Creates enforceable deadlines
- Establishes clear succession rules
- Prevents manipulation by any single actor

## Standalone vs. Integrated

This reform can work:

- **Standalone**: As a single-subject constitutional amendment
- **With Regional Federalism**: As part of the broader Regional Federal Constitution (where it originated as Article VII)
- **With voting rights**: Combined with voter access and protection reforms
