# Executive Reform Plan

## Overview

This plan proposes constitutional reforms to executive power addressing presidential authority, accountability, and institutional checks. It can be adopted independently or as part of broader structural reform.

## The Problem

Executive power has expanded dangerously:

- **Unilateral action**: Presidents govern by executive order
- **Signing statements**: Presidents claim authority to ignore laws
- **War powers**: Presidents initiate military action without Congress
- **Removal abuse**: Presidents threaten to fire independent officials
- **Pardon abuse**: Self-serving pardons undermine accountability

## The Solution

This plan proposes constitutional reforms establishing:

1. **Executive Order Limits**: Constraints on unilateral action
2. **Signing Statement Reform**: Limits on non-enforcement claims
3. **Pardon Reform**: Limits on self-interested pardons
4. **Removal Protections**: Independent agency protection
5. **Accountability Requirements**: Transparency and oversight

## Why Constitutional?

Statutory limits on executive power are easily circumvented:

- Presidents claim inherent authority
- Courts defer to executive in national security
- Congress lacks will to enforce limits
- Norms have eroded

Constitutional reform provides enforceable limits.
