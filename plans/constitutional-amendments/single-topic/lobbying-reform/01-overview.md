# Lobbying Reform Plan

## Overview

This plan proposes a comprehensive constitutional amendment to reform lobbying, reduce corruption, and restore public trust in government. The reforms can be adopted independently or as part of broader structural reforms.

## The Problem

Lobbying and influence-peddling have become systemic features of American government:

- **Revolving door**: Former officials monetize their government service by lobbying their former colleagues
- **Pay-to-play**: Campaign contributions create implicit obligations to donors
- **Regulatory capture**: Agencies serve regulated industries rather than the public
- **Foreign influence**: Foreign governments shape U.S. policy through undisclosed agents
- **Disclosure gaps**: Current lobbying disclosure laws are riddled with loopholes

The result is a government that responds more to organized interests than to citizens.

## The Solution

This plan proposes a constitutional amendment establishing:

1. **Public Trust Duty**: Enforceable obligation for all officials to serve the public, not private interests
2. **Lobbying Transparency**: Comprehensive disclosure of who seeks to influence government and how
3. **Revolving Door Restrictions**: Meaningful cooling-off periods before officials can lobby
4. **Pay-to-Play Prohibition**: Bars conditioning contributions on official action
5. **Regulatory Capture Prevention**: Structural requirements for agency independence
6. **Gift Restrictions**: Clear rules on what officials may accept
7. **Financial Disclosure**: Robust conflict-of-interest requirements
8. **Foreign Influence Controls**: Enhanced registration and disclosure for foreign agents
9. **Independent Enforcement**: Office of Public Integrity with real authority
10. **Citizen Standing**: Any citizen can sue to enforce disclosure requirements

## Why Constitutional?

Statutory reforms have repeatedly failed because:

- Congress exempts itself from requirements it imposes on others
- Agencies weaken rules through interpretation
- Courts narrow statutes in ways that undermine their purpose
- Future Congresses repeal or defund enforcement

A constitutional amendment creates durable, enforceable principles that cannot be easily circumvented.

## Standalone vs. Integrated

This reform can work:

- **Standalone**: Adopted as a single-subject constitutional amendment
- **With Regional Federalism**: As part of the broader Regional Federal Constitution (where it originated as Article IX)
- **With other reforms**: Combined with campaign finance, ethics, or transparency reforms
