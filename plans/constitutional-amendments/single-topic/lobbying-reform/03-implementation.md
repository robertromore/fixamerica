## Implementation Timeline

### Year 1 (Post-Ratification)

**Months 1-3**:

- President nominates Director of Office of Public Integrity
- Congress begins markup of enabling legislation package
- Executive branch agencies begin internal compliance reviews

**Months 4-6**:

- Senate confirmation of Director
- Office of Public Integrity established
- Interim disclosure rules promulgated

**Months 7-12**:

- Enabling legislation enacted
- Public database infrastructure developed
- Training programs for covered officials launched
- State notification of compliance requirements

### Year 2

**Months 13-18**:

- Full disclosure requirements take effect
- Office of Public Integrity begins accepting complaints
- First enforcement actions for post-ratification violations

**Months 19-24**:

- All provisions fully effective
- States must have comparable systems in place
- First annual reports issued

### Ongoing

- Biennial review of thresholds and effectiveness
- Annual reports to Congress
- Periodic rulemaking to address evasion techniques

---

## State Compliance

### Model State Legislation

States must enact "comparable" provisions within two years. Model state legislation should include:

1. **State Public Integrity Office**: Independent enforcement body
2. **State Lobbying Disclosure Act**: Registration and disclosure for state-level lobbying
3. **State Revolving Door Act**: Cooling-off periods for state officials
4. **State Ethics Act**: Financial disclosure and conflict-of-interest rules

### Compliance Assessment

Federal courts may assess whether state provisions are "comparable." Factors include:

- Coverage of similar categories of officials
- Similar disclosure requirements
- Meaningful enforcement mechanisms
- Comparable cooling-off periods
- Independent enforcement authority

States may exceed federal requirements but may not fall below them.

## Enforcement Priorities

### High Priority

1. **Unregistered lobbying**: Foreign agents and domestic lobbyists evading registration
2. **Revolving door violations**: Former officials lobbying during cooling-off periods
3. **False disclosures**: Material misstatements in lobbying or financial disclosures

### Medium Priority

1. **Regulatory capture**: Agency officials with undisclosed industry ties
2. **Gift violations**: Acceptance of prohibited gifts
3. **Bundling concealment**: Failure to disclose bundling activities

### Ongoing Monitoring

1. **Disclosure completeness**: Audits of filed disclosures
2. **State compliance**: Assessment of state comparable systems
3. **Emerging evasion**: New techniques to circumvent requirements

---

## Potential Challenges

### Constitutional Challenges

- **First Amendment**: Likely challenges arguing disclosure burdens speech
- **Federalism**: Challenges to state compliance requirements
- **Separation of Powers**: Challenges to Office of Public Integrity independence

**Response**: The amendment itself provides constitutional authority. First Amendment challenges are addressed by the narrow tailoring of disclosure to commercial lobbying, not citizen petitioning.

### Practical Challenges

- **Enforcement resources**: Office must be adequately funded
- **Database infrastructure**: Requires robust technology
- **State capacity**: Smaller states may need assistance
- **Evasion techniques**: Sophisticated actors will seek loopholes

**Response**: Mandatory funding, technical assistance programs, and adaptive rulemaking authority address these concerns.

## Metrics for Success

### Quantitative Metrics

- Number of registered lobbyists (should increase with broader coverage)
- Disclosure filings (should increase)
- Enforcement actions (appropriate level, not too few or too many)
- Time from violation to penalty (should decrease)
- Public database usage (should increase)

### Qualitative Metrics

- Public trust in government (surveys)
- Perceived corruption (international indices)
- Quality of policy outcomes (expert assessment)
- Revolving door employment patterns (tracking)
- Regulatory agency independence (academic review)
