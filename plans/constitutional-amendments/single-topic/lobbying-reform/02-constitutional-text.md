# Lobbying Reform Constitutional Amendment

## Proposed Amendment Text

---

### Section 1. Public Trust Duty

(a) All officers and employees of the United States, of the several States, and of their political subdivisions hold positions of public trust. They shall exercise their authority for the benefit of the public, not for private gain or the benefit of private interests that have sought to influence them.

(b) This duty is enforceable. Violation of the public trust duty may be grounds for removal, civil liability, and criminal prosecution as provided by law.

---

### Section 2. Transparency in Policy Influence

(a) The public has a right to know who seeks to influence their government. All significant contacts between policy advocates and public officials regarding pending legislation, regulations, or official actions shall be disclosed.

(b) Disclosure Requirements. Congress shall by statute establish a lobbying disclosure system that requires:

(1) registration of all persons who, for compensation, make more than incidental contact with public officials to influence policy,

(2) quarterly disclosure of lobbying contacts, including the identity of the client, the official contacted, the subject matter, and the position advocated,

(3) disclosure of compensation received for lobbying activities,

(4) disclosure of prior government service by lobbyists.

(c) State governments shall establish comparable disclosure systems for lobbying of their officials.

(d) Exemptions. The following are exempt from registration requirements (but not from disclosure of specific contacts):

(1) individual citizens contacting their own elected representatives on matters of personal concern,

(3) officials of other governmental entities engaged in intergovernmental relations,

(4) persons responding to official requests for information or testimony,

(5) representatives of Tribal Nations engaged in government-to-government consultation.

(e) Public Access. All lobbying disclosures shall be compiled in searchable public databases, updated within thirty days of filing, and maintained indefinitely.

(1) Members of Congress: for four years after leaving office, lobby any member or employee of Congress or any federal agency on any matter;

(2) Senior Executive Branch Officials (department heads, deputy heads, and officials requiring Senate confirmation): for four years after leaving office, lobby any federal agency or Congress on matters related to their former responsibilities, and for two years on any matter;

(3) Federal Judges: for life, lobby any court, and for four years, lobby any federal official on judicial appointments or court administration;

(4) Senior Congressional Staff (those earning above a threshold set by statute): for two years after leaving employment, lobby any member or employee of Congress;

(5) Senior Agency Officials (those with significant policy authority, as defined by statute): for two years after leaving employment, lobby their former agency, and for one year, lobby any federal agency on matters in which they personally participated.

(b) Current Officials. No person serving in a covered position may negotiate for future lobbying employment with any entity that has matters pending before that official.

(c) State Application. State governments shall establish revolving door restrictions for their officials that are at least as restrictive as those applicable to comparable federal officials.

(d) Penalties. Violation of revolving door restrictions shall result in:

(1) civil penalties of not less than the compensation received for prohibited lobbying,

(2) disgorgement of lobbying fees,

(3) prohibition from future lobbying for a period equal to the original cooling-off period,

(4) for willful violations, criminal penalties as provided by statute.

### Section 4. Pay-to-Play Prohibition

(a) No person may condition, or offer to condition, campaign contributions, political support, or anything of value on the recipient's official actions, and no official may solicit or accept such conditional support.

(b) Bundling Disclosure. Persons who collect and transmit campaign contributions from multiple donors (bundlers) shall be disclosed by recipient campaigns, and bundlers shall be subject to the same restrictions on seeking official action as if they had personally contributed the bundled amount.

(c) Contractor Restrictions. Persons and entities seeking or holding government contracts valued above a threshold set by statute may not make campaign contributions to officials with authority over those contracts. Congress may by statute extend this prohibition to subcontractors and to contributions to political action committees supporting such officials.

(d) Appointment Restrictions. No person may be appointed to any position requiring Senate confirmation within two years of having bundled contributions exceeding a threshold set by statute for the appointing President or confirming Senators, unless the appointment is disclosed and the Senate confirms by a two-thirds vote.

---

### Section 5. Regulatory Capture Prevention

(a) Regulatory agencies shall be structured to resist capture by the industries they regulate. Congress shall by statute require:

(1) diverse membership on regulatory boards, including consumer representatives, labor representatives, and public interest representatives, not only industry representatives,

(2) transparency in agency contacts with regulated entities,

(3) prohibition on agency officials holding financial interests in regulated entities,

(4) rotation of personnel between regulatory functions to prevent relationship capture.

(b) Advisory Committees. Federal advisory committees that include industry representatives shall also include a comparable number of public interest representatives. Advisory committee proceedings shall be public except where classified information is discussed.

(c) Regulatory Review. An independent office within each regulatory agency shall conduct periodic reviews of whether agency actions serve the public interest or primarily benefit regulated entities. These reviews shall be public.

---

### Section 6. Gifts and Benefits

(a) No official may accept gifts, hospitality, travel, or other things of value from persons seeking to influence official action, except as permitted by ethics rules established by statute.

(b) De Minimis Exception. Congress shall by statute establish a de minimis threshold (not to exceed one hundred dollars per source per year, adjusted for inflation) below which gifts need not be reported but may still not be solicited.

(c) Disclosure. All gifts above the de minimis threshold shall be publicly disclosed within thirty days.

(d) Prohibited Sources. No gift of any value may be accepted from:

(1) foreign governments or their agents (except in accordance with the Foreign Gifts Act),

(3) entities with matters pending before the official's agency,

(4) entities seeking contracts with the official's agency.

---

### Section 7. Financial Disclosure and Conflicts

(a) All officials in covered positions shall file annual public financial disclosures listing:

(1) assets and income,

(2) liabilities,

(3) positions held in corporations, partnerships, and organizations,

(b) Recusal Requirements. Officials shall recuse themselves from matters in which they have a financial interest, or in which a recent employer or prospective employer has an interest.

(c) Divestiture. Officials in senior positions shall divest holdings that create ongoing conflicts or place such holdings in qualified blind trusts.

(d) Post-Employment Disclosure. For four years after leaving covered positions, former officials shall file annual disclosures of employment and income from entities that were subject to their authority.

---

### Section 8. Foreign Influence

(a) Agents of foreign governments and foreign political parties shall register and disclose their activities as required by statute.

(c) Former senior officials may not act as agents of foreign governments or foreign political parties for ten years after leaving office.

(d) This section does not apply to diplomatic personnel acting in their official capacity or to representatives of Tribal Nations (which are domestic sovereigns, not foreign entities).

---

### Section 9. Enforcement

(a) Independent Enforcement. Congress shall establish an independent Office of Public Integrity with authority to:

(1) receive and investigate complaints regarding violations of this Article,

(2) conduct audits of lobbying disclosures and financial disclosures,

(3) issue civil penalties for violations,

(4) refer criminal matters to the Department of Justice,

(5) issue advisory opinions on the application of this Article.

(b) The Office shall be headed by a Director appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate for a single seven-year term, removable only for cause.

(c) Whistleblower Protection. Persons who report violations of this Article in good faith shall be protected from retaliation. Retaliation against whistleblowers is itself a violation of the public trust duty.

(d) Private Right of Action. Citizens may bring suit to compel disclosure required by this Article. Prevailing plaintiffs shall be awarded reasonable attorney's fees.

(e) Standing. Any citizen shall have standing to challenge violations of this Article in federal court.

---

### Section 10. Scope and Definitions

(a) "Lobbying" means oral or written communication to a covered official, made on behalf of a client for compensation, for the purpose of influencing legislation, regulation, policy, or official action.

(b) "Covered official" means any elected official, any official requiring Senate confirmation, any official with significant policy authority as defined by statute, and senior legislative staff.

(c) "Covered position" means any position the holder of which is a covered official.

(d) Congress may by statute expand the definitions in this section to cover additional officials or activities, but may not narrow them.

---

### Section 11. Application to State and Local Governments

(a) Federal Application. This Article applies directly to the federal government upon ratification.

(b) State Application. States shall enact provisions comparable to this Article, applicable to their officials, within two years of ratification. Federal courts may enforce the requirement that such provisions be "comparable" to federal requirements.

(c) Territorial Governments. Territories shall be subject to this Article to the same extent as States. Congress may by statute apply federal lobbying rules directly to Territorial officials if a Territory fails to enact comparable provisions.

(d) Tribal Nations. Consistent with the sovereignty of Tribal Nations:

(1) This Article does not directly regulate the internal governance of Tribal Nations.

(2) Federal officials who interact with Tribal Nations remain fully subject to this Article.

(3) Government-to-government consultation between federal officials and Tribal representatives is not lobbying for purposes of this Article.

(4) Tribal Nations are encouraged, but not required, to adopt transparency and anti-corruption measures consistent with their own governance traditions and the principles of this Article.

(5) Nothing in this section diminishes the obligations of non-Tribal lobbyists who seek to influence federal policy affecting Tribal Nations; such lobbying is fully subject to this Article.

---

### Section 12. Congressional Enforcement

Congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.

---

### Section 13. Effective Date

This article shall take effect two years after ratification, except that:

(a) The Office of Public Integrity shall be established within one year of ratification.

(b) Disclosure requirements shall take effect immediately upon ratification for new lobbying contacts.

(c) Revolving door restrictions shall apply to any person who leaves a covered position after ratification.

## Commentary

### Why These Provisions

**Public Trust Duty (Section 1)**: Creates an enforceable constitutional standard, not merely an ethical aspiration. Officials can be held legally accountable for serving private interests over public ones.

**Lobbying Transparency (Section 2)**: Closes loopholes in current law. The Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 exempts most lobbying activity; this provision captures all significant policy influence.

**Revolving Door (Section 3)**: Current one-year and two-year cooling-off periods are too short. Four years for senior officials matches a presidential term and creates meaningful separation.

**Pay-to-Play (Section 4)**: Makes explicit what ethics rules imply: official action cannot be conditioned on contributions. The bundling disclosure requirement addresses the practice of aggregating contributions to magnify influence.

**Regulatory Capture (Section 5)**: Addresses the phenomenon where agencies come to serve regulated industries. Requires structural diversity and transparency.

**Gifts (Section 6)**: Creates a bright-line rule against accepting anything of value from anyone seeking to influence official action. The $100 de minimis exception prevents absurdity while maintaining integrity.

**Financial Disclosure (Section 7)**: Expands current requirements and adds post-employment disclosure to track whether officials receive deferred compensation from entities they regulated.

**Foreign Influence (Section 8)**: Strengthens FARA (Foreign Agents Registration Act) by constitutionalizing disclosure requirements and extending cooling-off periods.

**Enforcement (Section 9)**: Creates an independent office modeled on inspectors general but with constitutional status. The seven-year term and for-cause removal protect independence.

**Standing (Section 9(e))**: Overturns judicial decisions requiring particularized injury. Any citizen can enforce transparency requirements.

### Relationship to Regional Federalism

This amendment originated as Article IX of the Regional Federal Constitution proposal. It has been adapted to work as a standalone amendment by:

- Changing "Regional" to "State" in application provisions
- Removing cross-references to other Regional Federalism articles
- Adding Section 12 (Congressional Enforcement) and Section 13 (Effective Date)

If adopted as part of Regional Federalism, use the Article IX version which integrates with Regional governance structures.

### Potential Objections

**"This restricts First Amendment rights"**: The right to petition government is preserved. What is restricted is the commercialization of access and the concealment of influence. Disclosure is not prohibition.

**"This is too complex for a constitutional amendment"**: Constitutional amendments have historically been brief, but the Fourteenth Amendment's five sections and the Twelfth Amendment's detailed election procedures show that complexity is appropriate when the subject requires it.

**"States should decide their own ethics rules"**: The federal system has demonstrated that a race to the bottom occurs without minimum standards. This amendment sets floors, not ceilings.

**"The Office of Public Integrity creates a new bureaucracy"**: Independent enforcement is essential. Congressional ethics enforcement has failed because members police themselves. The Office provides external accountability.
