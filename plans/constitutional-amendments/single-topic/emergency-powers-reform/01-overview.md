# Emergency Powers Reform Plan

## Overview

This plan proposes a constitutional amendment to reform emergency powers, establishing clear limits, mandatory termination, judicial review, and restoration requirements. It addresses the dangerous expansion of executive emergency authority.

## The Problem

Emergency powers in America have become dangerously expansive:

- **Permanent emergencies**: Some national emergencies have lasted decades
- **Scope creep**: Powers declared for one purpose used for others
- **Executive dominance**: Presidents claim powers without congressional authorization
- **Weak oversight**: Courts defer to executive emergency claims
- **No restoration**: Emergency measures become permanent policy
- **Habeas erosion**: Detention authority expanded without clear limits

The National Emergencies Act of 1976 was intended to limit emergency powers but has failed:

- Over 40 national emergencies currently active
- Some date back to the 1970s
- Congress rarely terminates emergencies
- Courts rarely review emergency necessity

## The Solution

This plan proposes a constitutional amendment establishing:

1. **Declaration Requirements**: Written, specific, time-limited declarations
2. **Emergency Categories**: Five distinct types with corresponding powers
3. **Enumerated Powers**: Specific powers for each emergency type
4. **Absolute Prohibitions**: Rights that cannot be suspended
5. **Time Limits**: Maximum durations with reauthorization requirements
6. **Judicial Review**: Expedited review with burden on government
7. **Restoration Mandate**: Automatic return to normal governance
8. **Habeas Protections**: Narrow suspension authority with procedural safeguards
9. **Anti-Expansion Rule**: Emergencies cannot create new permanent powers

## Why Constitutional?

Statutory emergency reforms have repeatedly failed:

- The National Emergencies Act was circumvented
- FISA courts approved nearly all surveillance requests
- Courts defer to executive emergency claims
- Congress lacks political will to terminate emergencies

A constitutional amendment:

- Creates enforceable limits on all branches
- Mandates automatic termination
- Establishes rights that cannot be waived
- Provides clear judicial review standards

## Standalone vs. Integrated

This reform can work:

- **Standalone**: As a single-subject constitutional amendment
- **With Regional Federalism**: As part of the broader Regional Federal Constitution (where it originated as Article XVII)
- **With other reforms**: Combined with military civilian control, cyber defense
