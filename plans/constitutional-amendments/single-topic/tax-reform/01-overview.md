# Tax Reform Plan

## Overview

This plan proposes constitutional principles for taxation to ensure fairness, transparency, and fiscal responsibility. It can be adopted independently or as part of broader fiscal reform.

## The Problem

The current tax system has structural problems:

- **Complexity**: Tax code exceeds 70,000 pages
- **Loopholes**: Wealthy individuals and corporations exploit preferential treatment
- **Regressive elements**: Payroll taxes and consumption taxes burden lower incomes
- **Hidden taxes**: Deductions and credits obscure true tax burden
- **Gaming**: Tax planning industry exists to minimize rather than comply

## The Solution

This plan proposes constitutional principles establishing:

1. **Progressive Taxation**: Rates increase with income/wealth
2. **Broad Base, Low Rates**: Fewer deductions, lower rates
3. **Transparency**: Citizens understand their tax burden
4. **Anti-Evasion**: Constitutional tools against tax avoidance
5. **Fiscal Responsibility**: Balance requirements with flexibility

## Why Constitutional?

Statutory tax reform is constantly eroded:

- Special interests add loopholes
- Congress creates exceptions for favored constituencies
- Complexity increases over time
- Temporary provisions become permanent

Constitutional principles provide durable framework.
