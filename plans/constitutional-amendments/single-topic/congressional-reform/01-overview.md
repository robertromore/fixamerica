# Congressional Reform Plan

## Overview

This plan proposes constitutional reforms to Congress addressing representation, procedures, and accountability. It can be adopted independently or as part of broader structural reform.

## The Problem

Congress faces structural dysfunction:

- **Malapportionment**: Senate gives Wyoming same representation as California
- **Gerrymandering**: House districts drawn for partisan advantage
- **Minority rule**: Filibuster allows minority to block legislation
- **Committee capture**: Committee chairs hold excessive power
- **Lack of accountability**: Safe seats reduce electoral accountability

## The Solution

This plan proposes constitutional reforms establishing:

1. **Proportional Representation**: Alternative voting systems for House
2. **Senate Reform**: Addressing representation imbalance
3. **Procedural Reform**: Limiting obstruction tactics
4. **Ethics Requirements**: Strengthened ethics enforcement
5. **Term Considerations**: Debate on term limits

## Why Constitutional?

Internal congressional rules can be changed by majority:

- Filibuster could be eliminated by rule change
- Ethics rules are self-enforced
- Gerrymandering requires constitutional intervention

Constitutional reform provides durable structural change.
