# Judicial Reform Constitutional Amendment

## Proposed Amendment Text

---

### Section 1. Mandatory Jurisdiction

(a) Courts shall hear and decide all cases involving:

- elections,
- separation of powers,
- federal-state authority disputes,
- constitutional rights violations,
- emergency powers,
- domestic use of armed force.

(b) Standing and political question doctrines shall not bar such cases. Any person with a concrete interest in the outcome has standing to challenge governmental action in these categories.

---

### Section 2. Time Limits

(a) Decisions in mandatory jurisdiction cases shall be issued within the following timeframes:

- Trial court: thirty days from submission
- Appellate court: thirty days from trial decision
- Supreme Court: thirty days from appellate decision

(b) Extensions may be granted only for cause, in writing, and may not exceed fifteen additional days per level.

(c) Failure to issue a decision within the time limit triggers the self-executing default rules of Section 4.

---

### Section 3. Effective Remedies

(a) Courts shall issue effective remedies. Declaratory relief without enforcement is prohibited.

(b) Where a constitutional violation is found, the court shall order:

- injunctive relief to prevent ongoing violation, or
- specific corrective action, or
- damages where appropriate.

(c) A court may not decline to enforce its own judgment on grounds of institutional comity or deference.

---

### Section 4. Self-Executing Defaults

(a) If courts fail to act within the time limits specified in Section 2 (including any extensions), the following default rules shall apply automatically:

(b) Separation of Powers Disputes. If a court fails to rule on separation of powers challenges:

- the challenged action is stayed pending resolution,
- if no ruling is issued within ninety days, the action is void.

(c) Emergency Powers Disputes. If a court fails to rule on the validity of declared emergencies or emergency measures:

- the emergency declaration expires automatically at the original time limit without renewal,
- measures taken under the expired emergency are void and unenforceable,
- affected parties may seek damages directly from the responsible officials.

(d) Election Disputes. If a court fails to rule on election challenges:

- the results as tabulated shall be provisionally certified,
- the court's eventual ruling, if it changes the outcome, shall take effect prospectively,
- no provisional certification may be reversed after inauguration.

(e) Rights Violations. If a court fails to rule on alleged constitutional rights violations:

- the challenged measure is automatically enjoined pending resolution,
- the Chief Judge of the relevant Circuit shall appoint a special master to issue findings within fifteen days,
- if findings indicate a violation, the injunction becomes permanent until the legislature amends the challenged measure.

(f) Armed Force Authorization Disputes. If a court fails to rule on the validity of domestic deployment authorization:

- deployment authority expires automatically at the end of the initial thirty-day period,
- no reauthorization may be issued until the court rules,
- forces must withdraw to garrison within forty-eight hours of expiration.

(g) Enforcement. Any party may invoke these defaults by filing a notice of default with the court clerk. The clerk shall issue a certificate of default within twenty-four hours if the deadline has passed. Default certificates are self-executing and require no further judicial action.

### Section 5. Supreme Court Term Limits

(a) Justices of the Supreme Court shall serve a single term of eighteen years.

(b) Terms shall be staggered such that one vacancy occurs every two years under ordinary circumstances.

(c) Upon completion of a term, a Justice may not be reappointed to the Supreme Court but may serve on lower federal courts or as senior Justice with reduced duties.

(d) Initial Staggering. Upon ratification, sitting Justices shall be assigned term expiration dates as follows:

(1) Justices shall be ranked by seniority (time on the Court).

(2) The most senior Justice's term expires two years after ratification.

(3) Each subsequent Justice's term expires two years after the previous, in order of seniority.

(4) No Justice serving at ratification shall have a term shorter than two years or longer than eighteen years.

(5) Justices whose calculated term would exceed eighteen years shall have terms of exactly eighteen years from ratification.

(e) Vacancies. If a vacancy occurs other than by term expiration (death, resignation, removal):

(1) The replacement Justice serves only the remainder of the unexpired term.

(2) A Justice who serves less than nine years of a predecessor's term is eligible for appointment to one full term.

(3) A Justice who serves nine years or more of a predecessor's term is not eligible for reappointment.

(a) The Supreme Court of the United States shall consist of nine Justices.

(b) The number of Justices may be changed only by constitutional amendment.

(c) Courts of Appeals and District Courts shall be established by statute.

(d) Judges of lower federal courts shall serve terms as established by statute, subject to good behavior requirements and removal only for cause.

---

### Section 7. Judicial Capacity

(a) Congress shall ensure adequate judicial capacity to meet the time limits specified in Section 2.

(b) Authorized capacity measures include:

- temporary assignment of judges,
- appointment of special masters for overflow cases,
- establishment of emergency judicial panels,
- expedited hiring and training of judicial staff.

(c) Failure to ensure adequate capacity does not excuse judicial delay. Courts shall meet constitutional time limits using available resources.

---

### Section 8. Congressional Enforcement

Congress shall have the power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.

## Commentary

### Why Judicial Reform?

The federal judiciary has become a site of constitutional dysfunction:

- **Stakes too high**: Life tenure means each appointment affects policy for decades
- **Evasion**: Political question doctrine lets courts avoid difficult cases
- **Delay**: Cases can languish for years without resolution
- **Deference**: Courts defer to executive claims of emergency or necessity

### Section-by-Section Analysis

**Section 1 (Mandatory Jurisdiction)**: Courts must hear cases in specified categories. No standing dismissals, no political question doctrine. This ensures courts perform their constitutional role.

**Section 2 (Time Limits)**: Thirty-day deadlines at each level (ninety days total) with limited extensions. Constitutional cases cannot languish indefinitely.

**Section 3 (Effective Remedies)**: Courts must actually enforce their decisions. No more declaratory judgments that executives ignore.

**Section 4 (Self-Executing Defaults)**: The key innovation. If courts fail to act, specified consequences occur automatically. Courts cannot obstruct by delay.

**Section 5 (Term Limits)**: Eighteen years ensures regular turnover. Staggered terms mean each president gets roughly two appointments per term. Reduces stakes of any single appointment.

**Section 6 (Court Structure)**: Locks Supreme Court at nine justices. Prevents court-packing.

**Section 7 (Capacity)**: Congress must provide resources, but lack of resources doesn't excuse delay.

### Why Eighteen Years?

- **Regular turnover**: One vacancy every two years
- **Sufficient tenure**: Long enough for institutional memory
- **Reduced stakes**: Each appointment matters less when turnover is predictable
- **Presidential balance**: Each two-term president gets four appointments

### Comparison to Current System

| Feature | Current System | Proposed Amendment |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Supreme Court tenure | Life | 18 years |
| Mandatory jurisdiction | Limited | Expanded |
| Time limits | None | 30 days per level |
| Standing | Restrictive | Liberalized |
| Political question | Available | Eliminated |
| Court size | Statutory | Constitutional (9) |

### Potential Objections

**"Term limits politicize the Court"**: The Court is already politicized. Regular turnover reduces the stakes of each appointment.

**"Thirty days is too short"**: Most constitutional cases have been briefed extensively before reaching the Supreme Court. Thirty days for decision is feasible.

**"Self-executing defaults are radical"**: The alternative is allowing courts to obstruct constitutional enforcement by delay.

**"This violates judicial independence"**: Courts retain full authority to decide cases. They simply must decide within deadlines.

### Relationship to Regional Federalism

This amendment originated as Article XIV of the Regional Federal Constitution. The Regional version includes:

- Regional courts and specialized federal courts
- Allocation Review Board for federal-regional disputes
- National Election Court and National Water Court

The standalone version focuses on federal courts with state courts continuing as before.
