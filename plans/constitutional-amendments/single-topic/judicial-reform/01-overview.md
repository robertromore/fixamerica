# Judicial Reform Plan

## Overview

This plan proposes a constitutional amendment reforming the federal judiciary to establish term limits for Supreme Court justices, require timely decisions on constitutional cases, and eliminate doctrines that prevent courts from deciding important cases.

## The Problem

The federal judiciary faces structural problems:

- **Life tenure abuses**: Justices serve 30+ years, stakes of each appointment are enormous
- **Political question doctrine**: Courts refuse to decide cases on separation of powers
- **Standing barriers**: Important cases dismissed without reaching the merits
- **Delayed justice**: Constitutional cases can take years to resolve
- **Emergency power deference**: Courts defer to executive emergency claims

The Supreme Court has become:

- Politicized in appointments
- Unpredictable in timing
- Reluctant to enforce structural limits
- Complicit in executive overreach through inaction

## The Solution

This plan proposes a constitutional amendment establishing:

1. **Term Limits**: Eighteen-year terms for Supreme Court justices
2. **Mandatory Jurisdiction**: Courts must hear constitutional cases
3. **Time Limits**: Thirty-day deadlines for constitutional decisions
4. **Self-Executing Defaults**: What happens if courts fail to act
5. **Effective Remedies**: Declaratory relief alone prohibited
6. **Standing Reform**: Political question and standing barriers eliminated

## Why Constitutional?

Statutory judicial reform has severe limits:

- Congress cannot limit Supreme Court tenure without amendment
- Courts define their own jurisdiction
- Political question doctrine is judge-made
- Standing requirements are constitutional

A constitutional amendment:

- Establishes term limits with constitutional force
- Mandates jurisdiction courts cannot decline
- Creates enforceable deadlines
- Eliminates evasive doctrines

## Standalone vs. Integrated

This reform can work:

- **Standalone**: As a single-subject constitutional amendment
- **With Regional Federalism**: As part of the broader Regional Federal Constitution (where it originated as Article XIV)
- **With other reforms**: Combined with emergency powers or election reform
