## Term Limit Implementation

### Staggering Calculation

Example with 9 Justices at ratification:

| Seniority | Justice | Term Expires |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| 1 (most senior) | [Name] | Year 2 |
| 2 | [Name] | Year 4 |
| 3 | [Name] | Year 6 |
| 4 | [Name] | Year 8 |
| 5 | [Name] | Year 10 |
| 6 | [Name] | Year 12 |
| 7 | [Name] | Year 14 |
| 8 | [Name] | Year 16 |
| 9 (most junior) | [Name] | Year 18 |

### Vacancy Handling

**Mid-Term Vacancy**:

1. Replacement serves remainder of term
2. If serving < 9 years, eligible for full term later
3. If serving >= 9 years, not eligible for reappointment

**Regular Appointment**:

1. Vacancy occurs every 2 years
2. President nominates, Senate confirms
3. New Justice serves full 18-year term

### Senior Justice Status

After term expires, former Justices may:

- Serve on lower federal courts
- Sit as senior Justice on certiorari panels
- Serve on specialized courts
- Teach or practice law

### Extension Procedures

**Requirements**:

- Written motion showing cause
- Maximum 15 additional days

- Chief Judge approval required

### Default Procedures

**Day 31 (if no decision)**:

1. Any party may file notice of default
2. Clerk verifies deadline passed
3. Clerk issues certificate of default within 24 hours
4. Default consequences take effect automatically

## Mandatory Jurisdiction Implementation

### Standing Reform

**New Standard**:

- Any person with concrete interest has standing
