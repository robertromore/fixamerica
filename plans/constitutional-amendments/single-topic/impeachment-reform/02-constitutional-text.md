## Commentary

### Why Impeachment Reform?

The impeachment process, while constitutionally established, has proven inadequate for holding officials accountable:

- **Trump impeachments (2019-2021)**: Revealed process is entirely partisan
- **No timeline**: Senate Majority Leader can refuse to hold trial
- **Minimal procedure**: No requirement for witnesses or evidence
- **Unclear standards**: "High crimes and misdemeanors" undefined for 230+ years

### Section-by-Section Analysis

**Section 1 (Officers)**: Clarifies that all civil officers are subject to impeachment, including independent agency heads who might claim independence from presidential control.

**Section 2 (Grounds)**: Defines impeachable offenses with more specificity:

- Adds "abuse of power" and "obstruction of constitutional processes"
- Clarifies that criminal conviction is not required
- "Refusal to comply with lawful court orders" addresses contempt of judicial authority

**Section 3 (House)**: Maintains House impeachment power with clarification that full House must vote (committee cannot impeach alone).

**Section 4 (Senate Trial)**: Maintains Senate trial power. Clarifies presiding officer when Chief Justice is impeached.

**Section 5 (Judgment)**: Maintains existing limits on judgment. Clarifies that disqualification requires separate majority vote (not two-thirds).

**Section 6 (Timing)**: The key reform. Mandatory thirty-day commencement and ninety-day conclusion. One thirty-day extension available. Default rule if Senate fails to act.

**Section 7 (Procedures)**: New section establishing minimum procedural rights for the accused. Senate retains flexibility to establish rules within these limits.

**Section 8 (Judicial Review)**: Clarifies that substance is not reviewable but procedures are. Supreme Court can ensure the accused received required process.

### Comparison to Current Constitution

| Feature | Current Constitution | Proposed Amendment |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Grounds | "Treason, bribery, high crimes and misdemeanors" | Expanded and defined |
| Timeline | None | 30 days to start, 90 days to finish |
| Accused rights | None specified | Notice, counsel, witnesses, cross-examination |
| Judicial review | Disputed | Limited procedural review |
| Default if no action | None | Articles rejected, re-impeachment allowed |

### Potential Objections

**"This constrains Senate discretion"**: The Senate retains full control over conviction. Only procedural minimums and timelines are required.

**"Ninety days may not be enough for complex cases"**: Extension available. Most impeachment trials have been concluded in days or weeks, not months.

**"Defining 'high crimes' invites litigation"**: The definition is illustrative, not exhaustive. Substance remains non-reviewable.

**"Procedural review is a slippery slope"**: Review is explicitly limited to four objective criteria. Courts cannot second-guess Senate's assessment of evidence or guilt.

### Relationship to Regional Federalism

This amendment originated as Article VI of the Regional Federal Constitution. The Regional version includes Section 8 on impeachment of Regional officers. The standalone version applies only to federal officers; states and (under Regional Federalism) Regions would establish their own impeachment procedures.
