# Impeachment Reform Plan

## Overview

This plan proposes a constitutional amendment reforming the impeachment process to clarify grounds, establish timelines, and ensure the process cannot be indefinitely delayed or obstructed.

## The Problem

The current impeachment process has significant weaknesses:

- **Vague standards**: "High crimes and misdemeanors" is undefined
- **No timeline**: Senate can delay trials indefinitely
- **Partisan gridlock**: Process has become entirely partisan
- **No accountability**: Senate can refuse to hold trial at all
- **Unclear judicial role**: Whether courts can review procedures is disputed

Recent impeachments have revealed:

- Senate can conduct minimal trials
- No requirement to hear witnesses
- Partisan loyalty overrides evidence
- Process can be concluded in days or delayed indefinitely

## The Solution

This plan proposes a constitutional amendment establishing:

1. **Defined Grounds**: Clarified bases for impeachment
2. **Timeline Requirements**: Mandatory trial commencement and conclusion
3. **Procedural Safeguards**: Minimum process requirements
4. **Limited Judicial Review**: Court review of procedures (not substance)
5. **Default Rules**: What happens if Senate fails to act

## Why Constitutional?

The impeachment process is already constitutional, but it's incomplete:

- Original Constitution doesn't define "high crimes and misdemeanors"
- No timeline requirements
- No procedural minimums
- Judicial review role unclear

Amendment provides clarity without changing the fundamental House/Senate structure.

## Standalone vs. Integrated

This reform can work:

- **Standalone**: As a single-subject constitutional amendment
- **With Regional Federalism**: As part of the broader Regional Federal Constitution (where it originated as Article VI)
- **With other reforms**: Combined with congressional or ethics reforms
