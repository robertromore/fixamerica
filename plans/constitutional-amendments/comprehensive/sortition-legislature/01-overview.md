# Sortition Legislature

## Status: Concept Stage

This proposal is in early concept stage. The overview below describes the core idea and directions for future development.

---

## The Idea

Replace one or both chambers of Congress with randomly selected citizens who serve fixed terms, similar to jury duty but for legislation.

## The Problem It Solves

Elected legislatures suffer from systemic dysfunction:

- **Money in politics**: Campaigns require fundraising, creating donor dependency
- **Unrepresentative**: Legislators are wealthier, older, more educated than constituents
- **Career politicians**: Incumbency advantage creates a permanent political class
- **Polarization**: Primary elections reward ideological extremes
- **Special interests**: Lobbyists have outsized influence on career politicians
- **Short-term thinking**: Electoral cycles discourage long-term policy

## How Sortition Differs

In a sortition system:

- Citizens are randomly selected from the eligible population
- Selection is statistically representative (like a large jury)
- No campaigns, fundraising, or elections for sortition seats
- Members serve single terms (no incumbency)
- Citizens deliberate with access to expert testimony and research
- Decisions reflect informed public judgment, not donor preferences

## Potential Benefits

- **Eliminates money in politics** for the sortition chamber
- **Statistically representative** of the population by design
- **No career politicians** - citizens serve and return to private life
- **Deliberative**: Members can focus on substance, not reelection
- **Reduces polarization**: Random selection doesn't reward extremism
- **Fresh perspectives**: Regular turnover prevents institutional capture

## Potential Concerns

- **Competence**: Can ordinary citizens handle complex legislation?
- **Manipulation**: Could staff or experts unduly influence amateur legislators?
- **Accountability**: How do voters hold random citizens accountable?
- **Legitimacy**: Will the public accept non-elected lawmakers?
- **Consistency**: Will policy be coherent with constant turnover?

## Models to Study

- **Ancient Athens**: Original sortition democracy (limited to male citizens)
- **Irish Citizens' Assembly**: Randomly selected body that shaped constitutional referendums
- **French Citizens' Convention on Climate**: 150 random citizens developed climate policy
- **British Columbia Citizens' Assembly**: Designed electoral reform proposal
- **Jury systems**: Existing model of random citizen decision-making

## Future Development Directions

LLMs expanding this proposal should focus on:

### Constitutional Design

- Which chamber(s) should use sortition? (Replace Senate? Create third chamber?)
- What is the selection mechanism? (Random from voter rolls? Stratified sampling?)
- What are term lengths? (6 months? 1 year? 2 years?)
- What are eligibility requirements and exemptions?
- How does sortition chamber interact with elected chamber?

### Deliberative Process Design

- How do citizens get up to speed on complex issues?
- What role do expert witnesses and staff play?
- How are deliberations structured?
- What voting procedures ensure thoughtful decisions?
- How is information quality controlled?

### Practical Implementation

- How are citizens compensated? (Salary? Job protection?)
- Where do they serve? (Washington? Regional centers? Remote?)
- What support systems do they need?
- How is the random selection verified as fair?

### Comparative Research

- Deep analysis of citizens' assemblies worldwide
- What makes some deliberative bodies effective and others not?
- How do different selection methods affect outcomes?

### Legitimacy and Accountability

- How do you build public trust in non-elected legislators?
- What transparency requirements?
- What happens if sortition produces unpopular decisions?

### Hybrid Models

- Could sortition be combined with elected representation?
- What powers should sortition chamber have vs. elected chamber?
- How do vetoes and reconciliation work?
