# Consensus Governance

## Status: Concept Stage

This proposal is in early concept stage. The overview below describes the core idea and directions for future development.

---

## The Idea

Replace majoritarian winner-take-all governance with consensus-requiring institutions where multiple parties share executive power and legislation requires broad agreement.

## The Problem It Solves

Majoritarian systems create destructive political dynamics:

- **Winner-take-all**: Slim majorities exercise total power
- **Minority exclusion**: Losing parties have no governing role
- **Policy swings**: Each election reverses the previous administration's work
- **Zero-sum politics**: Compromise is weakness, obstruction is strength
- **Polarization**: No structural incentive for cross-party cooperation
- **Existential stakes**: Elections determine complete control or complete exclusion

## How Consensus Governance Differs

Consensus systems require broad agreement:

- **Power-sharing executives**: Multiple parties hold cabinet positions
- **Supermajority requirements**: Major legislation needs more than 50%+1
- **Proportional representation**: Seats reflect vote shares
- **Coalition formation**: Governing requires negotiating with other parties
- **Opposition rights**: Minority parties have meaningful procedural powers
- **Veto players**: Multiple actors must agree for policy to change

## Potential Benefits

- **Stability**: Policy changes slowly, with broad support
- **Inclusion**: All significant parties share governing responsibility
- **Reduced polarization**: Incentives favor compromise over conflict
- **Minority protection**: Small groups have leverage in coalition negotiations
- **Durable policy**: Changes that survive are more legitimate
- **Lower stakes**: Losing doesn't mean total exclusion

## Potential Concerns

- **Gridlock**: Can consensus systems act decisively?
- **Lowest common denominator**: Does requiring agreement produce weak policy?
- **Diffused accountability**: Who's responsible when everyone governs?
- **Elite cartel**: Do consensus systems become insider clubs?
- **Slow response**: Can consensus governance handle emergencies?
- **Complexity**: Is the system too complicated for voters to understand?

## Models to Study

- **Switzerland**: Federal Council includes all major parties proportionally
- **Netherlands**: Coalition governments are the norm
- **Belgium**: Complex consociational system with linguistic communities
- **European Union**: Consensus requirements for major decisions
- **Northern Ireland**: Power-sharing between communities
- **Lebanon**: Confessional power-sharing (with known problems)

## Future Development Directions

LLMs expanding this proposal should focus on:

### Constitutional Design

- What form does power-sharing executive take?
- How are cabinet positions allocated among parties?
- What supermajority thresholds for different types of legislation?
- How does consensus governance interact with federalism?
- What are emergency decision-making procedures?

### Electoral System Integration

- What proportional representation system? (Party list? MMP? STV?)
- How do you ensure multiple viable parties exist?
- What thresholds for party representation?
- How does presidential election work in consensus system?

### Coalition Formation Rules

- How are coalition negotiations structured?
- What happens if no coalition can form?
- How long can formation negotiations take?
- What role for head of state in coalition formation?

### Opposition and Minority Rights

- What procedural powers do opposition parties retain?
- How are committee chairs allocated?
- What investigation powers does minority have?
- How is oversight distributed?

### Comparative Research

- Why do some consensus democracies work better than others?
- What causes consensus systems to break down?
- How do different countries handle coalition crises?

### American Context

- How does consensus governance interact with existing constitutional structure?
- Is this compatible with presidential system or does it require parliamentary transition?
- How would states adapt to federal consensus requirements?

### Transition Pathway

- Can elements of consensus governance be adopted incrementally?
- What reforms create multi-party competition?
- How do you build cross-party governing culture?
