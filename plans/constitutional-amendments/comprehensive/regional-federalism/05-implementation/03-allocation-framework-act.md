## 1. Overview and Constitutional Basis

### 1.1 Constitutional Mandate

Article XVII, Section 1 requires Congress to enact "an Allocation Framework Act defining jurisdictional boundaries and spillover criteria."

Article XVII, Section 2(a) provides that if Congress fails to act within two years, default rules apply: "the allocation of powers shall be governed by existing federal-state divisions, with Regions exercising authority over matters previously requiring interstate compacts."

### 1.2 Purpose

This Act provides:

- Clear definitions of which powers belong at which level
- Measurable criteria for determining when spillovers trigger regional authority
- Procedures for resolving jurisdictional disputes
- Mechanisms to prevent power creep at any level

### 1.3 Guiding Principles

Per the design documents, allocation follows these principles:

1. **Scale principle**: Powers belong at the level where effects are primarily felt
2. **Spillover principle**: Cross-jurisdictional effects trigger coordination requirements
3. **Subsidiarity with teeth**: Lower levels retain authority unless they cannot exercise it effectively
4. **Non-concurrency by default**: Powers are exclusive to one level unless explicitly shared

---

## 2. Jurisdictional Boundary Definitions

### 2.1 Federal Exclusive Powers

The following powers are exclusively federal and may not be exercised by Regions or States:

| Domain | Scope | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| National defense | Armed forces, military bases, defense procurement | National security requires unity |
| Foreign affairs | Treaties, diplomatic relations, trade negotiations | International standing |
| Currency and monetary policy | Federal Reserve, legal tender, banking regulation | Economic stability |
| Immigration and citizenship | Border control, naturalization, refugee policy | National sovereignty |
| Constitutional rights enforcement | Civil rights litigation, voting rights, equal protection | Uniform dignity |
| Interstate commerce regulation | Anti-trust, securities, consumer protection floors | Market unity |
| National benefits floor | Social Security, Medicare baseline, disability | Mobility without precarity |

### 2.2 Regional Exclusive Powers

The following powers are exclusively regional:

| Professional credentials | Licensing reciprocity, credential portability | Labor mobility |
| Public health coordination | Disease surveillance, hospital capacity planning | Epidemic response |

### 2.3 State Exclusive Powers

The following powers remain exclusively with States:

| Domain | Scope | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Education policy | Curriculum, standards, school governance | Cultural variation |
| Criminal law | Offenses, sentencing, prosecution | Local legitimacy |
| Family law | Marriage, divorce, custody, inheritance | Cultural preferences |
| Civil procedure | Court rules, litigation procedures | State courts |
| Local government law | Municipal structure, annexation, home rule | State-local relationship |
| Land use frameworks | Zoning authority delegation, property law | Proximity |

### 2.4 Local Powers

Local governments retain:

- Zoning implementation within regional and state frameworks
- Service delivery (utilities, waste, local transit)
- Schools administration
- Local policing execution
- Community services and parks

---

## 3. Spillover Criteria and Measurement

### 3.1 Definition of Spillover

A "spillover" occurs when the exercise of a power in one jurisdiction:

- Imposes costs on residents of another jurisdiction who cannot vote on the decision
- Creates benefits that cannot be captured by the acting jurisdiction
- Produces effects that cross jurisdictional boundaries at a material scale

### 3.2 Spillover Thresholds

Spillovers trigger regional coordination requirements when:

| Metric | Threshold | Example |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Population affected** | >15% of affected population is outside acting jurisdiction | Housing policy affecting commuters |
| **Economic impact** | >$100M annual external impact (inflation-adjusted) | Industrial pollution affecting neighbors |
| **Geographic scope** | Effects extend >50 miles beyond jurisdiction | Air quality, watershed impacts |
| **Resource depletion** | Shared resource affected by >10% of sustainable yield | Aquifer drawdown, fishery depletion |
| **Infrastructure dependency** | >25% of system users are from other jurisdictions | Regional transit, grid interconnection |

### 3.3 Spillover Categories

**Category A - Mandatory Regional Authority**

When spillover thresholds are exceeded in:

- Energy grid operations
- Major transportation corridors
- Watershed management
- Air quality management

Regional authority is automatic and exclusive.

**Category B - Coordination Required**

When spillover thresholds are exceeded in:

- Housing supply
- Labor standards
- Public health
- Economic development

Regional coordination is required; States may exceed regional minimums.

**Category C - Compact Encouraged**

When spillover effects are present but below thresholds:

- Regional compacts are encouraged but not mandated
- States may act unilaterally with notice to affected jurisdictions

### 3.4 Data Sources and Certification

**Authoritative Data Sources:**

| Metric | Primary Source | Secondary Source | Update Frequency |
|--------|----------------|------------------|------------------|
| Population affected | Census Bureau, American Community Survey | Regional planning agencies | Annual |
| Economic impact | Bureau of Economic Analysis, Regional Input-Output Models | State economic agencies | Annual |
| Geographic scope | EPA monitoring networks, USGS | State environmental agencies | Continuous/Annual |
| Resource depletion | USGS, state natural resource agencies | Academic studies | Annual |
| Infrastructure dependency | DOT, EIA, state utilities commissions | Regional transit/utility authorities | Annual |

**Data Collection Requirements:**

- Federal statistical agencies shall publish spillover-relevant data in standardized formats
- Regions shall report infrastructure usage, economic flows, and environmental monitoring data to the Allocation Review Board annually
- States shall provide population movement and commuting data derived from administrative records
- All data shall be machine-readable and publicly accessible

**Certification Process:**

1. The Allocation Review Board shall certify spillover data annually
2. Certification requires:
   - Verification of methodology consistency across jurisdictions
   - Cross-validation with independent data sources
   - Publication of uncertainty ranges for each metric
3. Certified data is presumptively valid for spillover scoring
4. Jurisdictions may challenge certified data within 60 days of publication

**Dispute Resolution for Data:**

- Data disputes are heard by a technical panel of the Allocation Review Board
- Panel consists of 3 members with statistical or domain expertise
- Panel may commission independent analysis
- Panel determination is binding for scoring purposes, subject to judicial review for procedural error

**Manipulation Safeguards:**

- Intentional misreporting of data by any jurisdiction:
    - Triggers automatic reversion to federal/third-party data sources
    - Subjects responsible officials to removal for cause
    - May result in adverse inference in spillover scoring
- Data collection methodologies may not be changed within 12 months of a spillover determination

**Third-Party Data Audits:**

To guard against data manipulation and ensure scoring integrity:

| Audit Type | Frequency | Scope | Auditor |
|------------|-----------|-------|---------|
| **Annual methodology audit** | Annually | Data collection protocols, definitions, and calculation methods | GAO or contracted statistical auditor |
| **Jurisdiction data audit** | Rotating (each jurisdiction every 3 years) | Accuracy of data reported by specific jurisdictions | Independent auditor selected by Board |
| **Pre-certification audit** | Before each annual certification | Sample verification of key metrics before scores are published | Board staff + external validator |
| **Triggered audit** | Upon complaint or red flag | Focused investigation of suspected manipulation | GAO or IG |

**Audit Standards and Protocols:**

Each third-party audit shall assess:

1. **Source verification**: Whether reported data derives from documented, authoritative sources
2. **Methodology consistency**: Whether data collection methods match published protocols
3. **Temporal consistency**: Whether data trends are plausible given underlying conditions
4. **Cross-validation**: Whether data is consistent with independent sources (Census, BEA, EPA, etc.)
5. **Outlier analysis**: Whether anomalous values have documented explanations
6. **Documentation adequacy**: Whether metadata and methodology descriptions are sufficient for replication

**Audit Independence Requirements:**

- Auditors may not have financial relationships with jurisdictions whose data they audit
- Auditors may not have participated in data collection for the period being audited
- Audit contracts awarded through competitive process; no auditor may audit same jurisdiction for more than 3 consecutive cycles
- Audit team must include at least one member with no prior relationship to the Board

**Audit Reports:**

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| Publication | All audit reports published within 30 days of completion |
| Findings | Specific findings on data accuracy, methodology compliance, and manipulation indicators |
| Recommendations | Required corrective actions with deadlines |
| Response requirement | Audited jurisdiction must respond in writing within 45 days |
| Board action | Board must address material audit findings before using audited data for scoring |

**Consequences of Adverse Audit Findings:**

| Finding | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| **Minor discrepancy** | Correction required before data used in scoring; no penalty |
| **Material error** | Data excluded from scoring until corrected; jurisdiction loses presumption of validity |
| **Pattern of errors** (3+ material errors in 24 months) | Automatic reversion to federal/third-party data for all metrics; enhanced monitoring |
| **Intentional manipulation** | Data excluded permanently; adverse inference in scoring; official liability (Section 10.3) |

**Pre-Certification Data Freeze:**

To prevent last-minute manipulation:

- All jurisdiction-reported data must be submitted at least 60 days before annual certification
- Data submitted after the freeze date may not be used for that year's certification
- Changes to previously submitted data require written explanation and are flagged for audit
- Certification is delayed (not released) if material data is submitted after freeze

**Data Quality Metrics:**

The Board shall maintain and publish quarterly:

- Completeness rate: Percentage of required data elements received on time
- Correction rate: Frequency of post-submission corrections by jurisdiction
- Audit pass rate: Percentage of audited data passing without material findings
- Reversion rate: Frequency of reversion to federal/third-party sources
- Complaint rate: Number of data-related complaints filed

Jurisdictions with data quality metrics in the bottom quartile are subject to enhanced auditing and may lose self-reporting privileges.

## 4. The Spillover Scoring Matrix

### 4.1 Purpose

The Spillover Scoring Matrix provides a standardized method for evaluating whether a policy area triggers regional authority.

### 4.2 Scoring Dimensions

| Dimension | Weight | Score Range |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Cross-border population impact | 25% | 0-100 |
| Economic externalities | 20% | 0-100 |
| Environmental scope | 20% | 0-100 |
| Infrastructure interdependence | 15% | 0-100 |
| Coordination benefits | 10% | 0-100 |
| Race-to-bottom risk | 10% | 0-100 |

### 4.3 Threshold Scores

| Total Score | Classification | Authority Level |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 0-29 | Local/State matter | State exclusive |
| 30-49 | Coordination beneficial | Compact encouraged |
| 50-69 | Coordination required | Regional minimum + State flexibility |
| 70-100 | Regional exclusive | Regional authority |

### 4.4 Worked Examples

**Example 1: Housing Supply in Metropolitan Area**

- Cross-border population impact: 85 (commuters affected across 3 states)
- Economic externalities: 70 (housing costs affect regional labor market)
- Environmental scope: 40 (land use has limited environmental spillover)
- Infrastructure interdependence: 60 (transit, utilities cross borders)
- Coordination benefits: 80 (regional planning prevents undersupply)
- Race-to-bottom risk: 75 (exclusionary zoning externalizes costs)

**Total: 69.5 → Regional coordination required**

**Example 2: K-12 Curriculum Standards**

- Cross-border population impact: 15 (few students cross state lines)
- Economic externalities: 25 (workforce effects are long-term, diffuse)
- Environmental scope: 0 (no environmental impact)
- Infrastructure interdependence: 10 (school facilities are local)
- Coordination benefits: 30 (some mobility benefits)
- Race-to-bottom risk: 20 (federal floors protect basics)

**Total: 17.5 → State exclusive**

### 4.5 Data Sources for Scoring Dimensions

Each scoring dimension shall be calculated using certified data sources as specified below:

| Dimension | Primary Data Source | Secondary Source | Calculation Method |
|-----------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| Cross-border population impact | Census Bureau ACS commuting data, migration flows | State administrative records | Percentage of affected population residing outside acting jurisdiction |
| Economic externalities | BEA Regional Economic Accounts, Input-Output models | State economic agencies, academic studies | Dollar value of cross-jurisdictional economic effects |
| Environmental scope | EPA monitoring networks, USGS watershed data | State environmental agencies | Geographic extent of effects beyond jurisdiction boundaries |
| Infrastructure interdependence | DOT traffic data, EIA energy flow data | State utilities commissions | Percentage of system users from other jurisdictions |
| Coordination benefits | Board staff analysis using certified baseline data | Academic studies, GAO reports | Estimated efficiency gains from regional coordination |
| Race-to-bottom risk | Historical policy variation data, academic literature | Board staff analysis | Assessment of regulatory arbitrage incentives |

**Data Binding:**

- All scoring inputs shall derive from data certified under Section 3.4
- Uncertified data may not be used as primary scoring input
- Where certified data is unavailable, the Board shall use the best available data with documented uncertainty ranges
- Scoring inputs shall be frozen at the data certification date; subsequent data updates do not affect ongoing scoring proceedings until the next annual certification cycle

### 4.6 Scoring Methodology and Anti-Gaming Provisions

**Standardized Scoring Protocols:**

The Board shall publish scoring protocols specifying:

- Quantitative formulas for converting certified data into dimension scores
- Weighting adjustments for data quality and completeness
- Treatment of missing data and uncertainty
- Procedures for handling outliers and anomalies

**Anti-Gaming Safeguards:**

To prevent manipulation of scores to avoid coordination thresholds:

1. **Mandatory comprehensive assessment**: Scoring must consider all relevant certified data; selective omission of unfavorable data is prohibited
2. **Consistency requirements**: Scoring methodology must be applied uniformly across all policy domains; jurisdiction-specific adjustments are prohibited absent Board finding of material difference
3. **Threshold buffer zone**: Policy domains scoring within 5 points of a threshold (25-34, 45-54, 65-74) require enhanced scrutiny and Board supermajority (6 of 9 members) to classify at the lower authority level
4. **Trend analysis**: The Board shall consider multi-year trends, not single-year snapshots; downward manipulation of current-year data is ineffective if trend indicates higher spillover
5. **Comparator analysis**: Scores for similar policy domains in comparable contexts provide benchmarks; significant deviation requires written justification

**Prohibited Gaming Tactics:**

The following are presumptively invalid bases for scoring:

- Reliance on data from only one jurisdiction when multi-jurisdictional data is available
- Use of outdated data when current certified data exists
- Exclusion of externalities documented in certified data
- Methodological changes made within 12 months of a scoring determination (per Section 3.4)
- Self-reported data from interested jurisdictions without third-party verification

### 4.7 Third-Party Validation

**Independent Validation Requirements:**

- Initial classifications under Section 5.1 shall be validated by an independent third party before final publication
- Reclassification petitions (Section 5.2) scoring within 10 points of a threshold require independent validation
- The Board shall contract with qualified validation entities including:
    - University research centers with expertise in public policy
    - Nonpartisan policy research organizations
    - Federal statistical agencies (on a reimbursable basis)

**Validation Scope:**

Third-party validators shall assess:

- Accuracy of data extraction from certified sources
- Correct application of scoring protocols
- Reasonable exercise of judgment where protocols permit discretion
- Consistency with prior scoring determinations for comparable domains

**Validation Reports:**

- Validators shall submit written reports within 30 days
- Reports are public records
- Board must respond in writing to any validator concerns before finalizing scores
- Persistent disagreement between Board and validator triggers automatic GAO review

**Validator Independence:**

- Validators may not have financial relationships with jurisdictions subject to scoring
- Validators may not have participated in advocacy related to the policy domain being scored
- Validator contracts are awarded through competitive process
- No single validator may validate more than 25% of scoring determinations in any year

### 4.8 Scoring Appeals Process

**Standing to Appeal:**

The following may appeal scoring determinations:

- Any level of government affected by the classification
- Any level of government that would be affected by an alternative classification
- The federal government (through the Attorney General)
- Compact parties if scoring affects compact obligations

**Appeal Grounds:**

Appeals may be filed on the following bases:

| Ground | Standard of Review |
|--------|-------------------|
| Data error | De novo (was certified data correctly applied?) |
| Methodological error | Abuse of discretion (was scoring protocol followed?) |
| Inconsistent treatment | Arbitrary and capricious (was similar domain scored differently without justification?) |
| Gaming finding | Substantial evidence (did Board correctly identify prohibited gaming?) |

**Appeal Procedure:**

| Stage | Timeline | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Filing | 30 days from scoring publication | Submit written appeal with specific grounds and supporting evidence |
| Board response | 30 days from filing | Board files written response defending scoring |
| Panel review | 45 days from Board response | Three-member Board panel (excluding members who participated in original scoring) reviews record |
| Panel determination | 15 days from review completion | Panel issues written decision affirming, reversing, or remanding |
| Judicial review | 60 days from panel determination | Appeal to Regional Courts; limited to record; substantial evidence/arbitrary and capricious standard |

**Effect of Appeal:**

- Scoring remains in effect during appeal unless the Board certifies that the appeal raises substantial questions and grants a stay
- If scoring is reversed on appeal, the Board shall issue corrected classification within 30 days
- Jurisdictions that relied on erroneous scoring in good faith are not penalized for actions taken during appeal period

**Frivolous Appeals:**

- Filing fee: $2,500 (refundable if appeal succeeds or raises substantial questions)
- Repeated frivolous appeals (3+ in 24 months) may result in increased filing requirements

## 5. Power Assignment Procedures

### 5.1 Initial Classification

Within 180 days of enactment, the Allocation Review Board shall:

1. Apply the Spillover Scoring Matrix to all major policy domains
2. Publish preliminary classifications with full supporting documentation
3. Accept public comment for 90 days
4. Issue final classifications with responses to material comments

**Transparency Requirements for Initial Classifications:**

For each policy domain classified, the Board shall publish simultaneously with the classification:

| Required Element | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Scoring worksheet** | Complete scoring for all 6 Matrix dimensions, showing points assigned and total score |
| **Data sources** | Specific certified data sources (Section 4.2) relied upon for each dimension |
| **Dimension rationale** | Written explanation (minimum 250 words per dimension) of how data supports assigned score |
| **Discretionary judgments** | Any judgment calls where protocols permitted discretion, with justification |
| **Threshold analysis** | If score is within 10 points of a threshold, enhanced explanation of classification decision |
| **Alternative scenarios** | Analysis of how classification would change under different reasonable scoring assumptions |
| **Affected jurisdictions** | List of all government levels and jurisdictions affected by the classification |

**Format and Accessibility:**

- All documentation shall be published in machine-readable format (structured data, not just PDF)
- A summary document (maximum 5 pages) shall accompany each classification for public accessibility
- Full scoring data shall be downloadable as spreadsheets with formulas visible
- All certified data sources shall be hyperlinked or attached

**Verification Period:**

During the 90-day public comment period:

- Any government may request source data underlying a specific score
- The Board shall provide requested data within 14 days
- Governments may submit independent scoring analyses using the same data
- The Board shall respond in writing to any independent analysis that produces a different classification

**Final Classification Requirements:**

When issuing final classifications, the Board shall:

1. Publish a response document addressing all material comments received
2. Explain any changes from preliminary to final classification
3. Document any data corrections or methodological refinements made in response to comments
4. Publish dissenting views of any Board members

**Consequences of Inadequate Documentation:**

If a jurisdiction demonstrates that the Board failed to publish required documentation:

- The classification is voidable upon judicial review
- The Board must cure the documentation deficiency within 30 days
- Repeated documentation failures (3+ in 12 months) trigger automatic GAO audit
- Jurisdictions challenging documentation adequacy are entitled to expedited review

### 5.2 Reclassification Petitions

Any level of government may petition for reclassification when:

- Circumstances have materially changed
- New data demonstrates different spillover patterns
- Five years have elapsed since last classification

**Petition Requirements:**

A reclassification petition shall include:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Petitioner identification | Government level, jurisdiction, authorized official |
| Current classification | Existing authority assignment and date of last classification |
| Requested classification | Proposed authority level and scope |
| Grounds for reclassification | Which of the three bases (changed circumstances, new data, 5-year elapsed) applies |
| Supporting evidence | Data, studies, or documentation supporting changed spillover patterns |
| Spillover scoring analysis | Petitioner's proposed re-scoring under the Spillover Scoring Matrix |
| Impact assessment | Effects of reclassification on other jurisdictions |
| Stakeholder consultation | Evidence of notice to and consultation with affected governments |

**Filing and Fees:**

- Filing fee: $5,000 (waived for local governments; refundable if petition granted)
- Electronic filing required through Board portal
- Simultaneous service on all governments that would be affected by reclassification

**Board Response Timeline:**

| Stage | Deadline | Board Action |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Acknowledgment | 14 days from filing | Confirm receipt, assign docket number, identify any deficiencies |
| Completeness review | 30 days from filing | Determine if petition meets requirements; request cure if deficient |
| Preliminary assessment | 90 days from complete filing | Staff analysis of spillover scoring; determination whether full review warranted |
| Public comment | 60 days after preliminary assessment | Notice and comment period for affected parties and public |
| Board hearing | 30 days after close of comment | Oral presentation by petitioner and objectors (optional) |
| Final determination | 60 days after hearing | Board issues reasoned decision granting, denying, or modifying petition |
| **Total maximum timeline** | **270 days from complete filing** | |

**Performance Standards:**

- The Board shall not exceed the timelines above absent extraordinary circumstances
- If the Board fails to issue a final determination within 300 days, the petitioner may seek mandamus in Regional Courts
- The Board shall publish quarterly reports on pending petitions, average processing times, and backlog
- Processing times exceeding 270 days for more than 25% of petitions in any year triggers automatic GAO review

**Burden of Proof:**

- The petitioner bears the burden of demonstrating that reclassification is warranted
- Standard of proof: preponderance of the evidence
- For petitions to shift authority to a higher level: petitioner must demonstrate that spillover effects have materially increased since last classification
- For petitions to shift authority to a lower level: petitioner must demonstrate that spillover effects have materially decreased or that lower-level coordination has proven effective

**Board Decision Standards:**

The Board shall grant a reclassification petition if the petitioner demonstrates:

1. One of the three statutory grounds (changed circumstances, new data, or 5-year elapsed period) applies; AND
2. Re-application of the Spillover Scoring Matrix produces a score warranting different classification; AND
3. Reclassification would not create significant coordination gaps or enforcement difficulties

**Reasoned Decision Requirement:**

All Board determinations shall include:

- Findings of fact based on the evidentiary record
- Analysis of each Spillover Scoring Matrix dimension
- Explanation of how the evidence supports the conclusion
- Response to material objections raised during comment period
- Effective date for any reclassification (minimum 90 days after decision)

**Appeal Rights:**

- Any party to the proceeding may appeal to Regional Courts within 60 days of final determination
- Standard of review: substantial evidence for factual findings; de novo for legal conclusions
- Reclassification is stayed pending appeal unless the Board certifies urgent circumstances

**Status Quo During Petition Pendency:**

- Existing classification remains in full force and effect while a petition is pending
- A pending petition does not excuse compliance with current authority requirements
- Neither petitioner nor any affected jurisdiction may take unilateral action based on anticipated reclassification
- Actions taken in reliance on existing classification during petition pendency are not retroactively invalidated

**Provisional Determinations:**

The Board may issue a provisional determination when:

| Condition | Standard |
|-----------|----------|
| Preliminary assessment indicates likely reclassification | Staff analysis shows spillover score would move to different threshold band |
| Continued existing allocation would cause significant harm | Documented evidence of ongoing spillover costs or coordination failures |
| Petitioner requests provisional relief | Filed concurrently with petition or within 30 days |
| No comparable harm to status quo parties | Balance of equities favors provisional reclassification |

Provisional determination procedures:

1. **Filing**: Motion for provisional determination may accompany petition or be filed within 30 days
2. **Expedited briefing**: Affected parties have 21 days to respond; petitioner has 7 days for reply
3. **Board decision**: Within 90 days of complete petition filing, the Board shall rule on provisional determination requests
4. **Standard**: Provisional determination requires a showing that petitioner is likely to prevail and that provisional relief would not disrupt existing programs
5. **Duration**: Provisional classifications remain in effect until final determination, but no longer than 180 days without Board renewal
6. **Renewal**: The Board may renew provisional determinations in 90-day increments if final determination is delayed for good cause

**Interim Relief Motions:**

Any affected party may seek interim relief during petition pendency:

- **Motion for interim coordination authority**: Where existing classification creates urgent coordination gaps, affected governments may seek temporary authority adjustments
- **Motion for status quo protection**: Where petitioner's actions threaten to disrupt existing arrangements, status quo parties may seek protective orders
- **Motion for expedited review**: Any party may move to shorten deadlines upon showing of exigent circumstances

Interim relief procedures:

1. Motion filed with Board with simultaneous service on all parties
2. Response due within 14 days
3. Board rules within 30 days of response or expiration of response period
4. Interim orders are interlocutory and not separately appealable

**Classification Stability Period:**

To prevent perpetual uncertainty and weaponized re-litigation of allocation decisions:

| Stability Rule | Requirement |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Minimum classification duration** | No reclassification petition may be filed for a policy domain within 36 months of final classification (initial or reclassified) |
| **Post-denial cooling period** | No substantially similar petition may be filed within 24 months of petition denial |
| **Per-domain petition limit** | No more than one reclassification petition per policy domain may be pending at any time |
| **Successive petition bar** | If a domain has been reclassified twice within 10 years, no further reclassification petitions may be filed for 5 years (absent emergency) |

**"Material Change in Circumstances" Exception:**

A petitioner may seek waiver of stability period requirements by demonstrating:

1. **Documented change**: Objective, verifiable change in factual circumstances affecting spillover analysis
2. **Significance**: Change would affect spillover score by at least 15 points (based on certified data)
3. **Unforeseeable**: Change was not reasonably foreseeable at time of prior classification
4. **Not self-created**: Petitioner did not create the changed circumstances to trigger exception

Waiver requests are decided by supermajority (6 of 9) Board vote. Denial is not appealable.

**Anti-Stalling Provisions:**

To prevent abuse of the petition process:

1. **Good faith requirement**: Petitions must be filed in good faith with reasonable factual and legal basis
2. **Frivolous petition sanctions**: The Board may impose sanctions including:
    - Fee forfeiture ($5,000 filing fee non-refundable)
    - Costs and attorney fees to affected parties
    - Bar on future petitions without leave of Board (for pattern of frivolous filings)
3. **Petition withdrawal limits**: A petitioner may withdraw once without prejudice; subsequent withdrawal triggers 24-month bar on re-filing substantially similar petition
4. **Expedited dismissal**: The Board shall dismiss within 60 days any petition that:
    - Fails to state grounds for reclassification
    - Is substantially identical to a petition denied within 24 months
    - Is filed primarily for delay or harassment (determined by pattern of conduct)
    - Violates the Classification Stability Period requirements
5. **Tolling prohibited**: Filing a petition does not toll any compliance deadlines or enforcement actions under existing classification
6. **Parallel enforcement**: Enforcement proceedings under existing classification may continue during petition pendency
7. **No successive petitions**: Once a petition is denied, no substantially similar petition may be filed for 24 months absent material change in circumstances

**Continuation of Contested Activities:**

Where a petition seeks to restrict authority currently exercised by another jurisdiction:

- The jurisdiction exercising authority may continue contested activities during pendency
- Provisional determination may halt contested activities only upon Board finding of imminent, irreparable harm
- Damages or restitution for activities conducted during pendency are available only if:
    - Petition is granted, AND
    - Continuing party acted in bad faith or with knowledge that authority was clearly improper
- Safe harbor: Activities undertaken in good faith reliance on existing classification are not subject to retroactive liability

### 5.3 Emergency Reclassification

**Triggering Emergencies:**

The Board may issue emergency reclassifications only during emergencies declared by:

| Declaring Authority | Scope of Board Response |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| President (national emergency under National Emergencies Act) | Nationwide or multi-Regional reclassification |
| Congress (by joint resolution) | Nationwide or multi-Regional reclassification |
| Regional Governor(s) (state of emergency) | Reclassification within declaring Region(s) only |
| Federal agency head (sector-specific emergency) | Reclassification within agency's subject matter only |

**Conditions for Emergency Reclassification:**

The Board may issue an emergency reclassification only upon written finding that ALL of the following conditions are met:

1. **Active emergency**: A qualifying emergency declaration is currently in effect
2. **Nexus to allocation**: The emergency creates allocation-related coordination needs that cannot be met under existing classification
3. **Immediacy**: Waiting for normal reclassification procedures (270 days) would cause irreparable harm to public health, safety, or welfare
4. **Proportionality**: The temporary authority requested is no broader than necessary to address the emergency
5. **Reversibility**: The reclassification can be unwound without lasting structural damage when the emergency ends

**Proportionality Standard:**

"Proportionate to need" means:

- Geographic scope limited to areas affected by the emergency
- Subject matter limited to functions directly implicated by the emergency
- Duration tied to expected emergency timeline (not maximum allowed)
- Authority level limited to minimum necessary for coordination (not maximum available)
- Existing state and local authority preserved to maximum extent consistent with emergency response

**Board Procedure for Emergency Reclassification:**

| Stage | Timeline | Requirement |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Petition received | Day 0 | Any government or the Board sua sponte |
| Preliminary assessment | 48 hours | Staff assessment of emergency nexus |
| Emergency hearing | 72 hours | Expedited Board consideration (quorum: 5 members) |
| Initial order | 96 hours | Temporary reclassification (if granted) with written justification |
| Public notice | 24 hours after order | Publication of order and justification |

**Written Justification Requirements:**

Every emergency reclassification order shall include:

1. Identification of the triggering emergency declaration
2. Specific findings on each of the five conditions above
3. Description of the reclassified authority and its scope
4. Explanation of why normal procedures are inadequate
5. Duration of the temporary reclassification
6. Conditions for termination or renewal
7. Sunset date (not to exceed 6 months without renewal)
8. Dissenting views of any Board members

**Duration and Renewal:**

- **Initial term**: Maximum 6 months (not 18 months as previously stated)
- **Renewal**: Board may renew for additional 6-month periods upon written finding that:
    - Triggering emergency remains in effect
    - Conditions for emergency reclassification continue to be met
    - Renewal is proportionate to continuing need
- **Maximum duration**: 24 months total; extensions beyond 24 months require Congressional authorization
- **Automatic termination**: Emergency reclassification terminates automatically when:
    - Underlying emergency declaration expires or is rescinded
    - Board finds conditions for reclassification no longer met
    - Sunset date is reached without renewal

**Emergency Reclassification Limits Per Domain:**

To prevent emergency powers from becoming a backdoor to perpetual reclassification:

| Limit Type | Requirement |
|------------|-------------|
| **Per-domain limit** | No more than 2 emergency reclassifications per policy domain per 10-year period |
| **Cooling period** | After emergency reclassification expires, no new emergency reclassification for same domain for 24 months |
| **Aggregate limit** | No more than 5 emergency reclassifications nationwide may be active simultaneously |
| **Duration cap** | Total emergency reclassification time for any domain may not exceed 36 months in any 10-year period |

**Waiver of Emergency Limits:**

Emergency limits may be waived only by:

- Congressional joint resolution (for nationwide emergencies), OR
- Supermajority (6 of 9) Board vote upon certification that:
    - A distinct, unrelated emergency has occurred
    - Prior emergency and current emergency are not a continuing pattern
    - No alternative to emergency reclassification exists

**Emergency Reclassification Registry:**

The Board shall maintain a public registry of all emergency reclassifications showing:

- Domain, scope, and duration
- Triggering emergency declaration
- Renewal history
- Time remaining under per-domain limits
- Whether any limit is approaching exhaustion

The registry shall be updated within 24 hours of any change and be prominently displayed on the Board's website.

**Periodic Review:**

During any emergency reclassification:

- **Monthly reports**: Board shall publish monthly status reports on emergency reclassifications
- **90-day review**: At 90-day intervals, Board shall conduct formal review of whether conditions continue to be met
- **Public comment**: Affected parties may submit comments on renewal requests
- **Congressional notification**: Congress shall receive notice of all emergency reclassifications within 7 days and all renewals within 3 days

**Operational Transparency During Emergency Reclassification:**

The entity exercising emergency authority (whether federal, regional, or designated agent) shall comply with the following transparency requirements throughout the emergency period:

| Requirement | Frequency | Content | Recipient |
|-------------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| Operational log | Weekly | All actions taken under emergency authority | Board, affected jurisdictions |
| Resource deployment | Bi-weekly | Personnel, funding, equipment committed | Board, public website |
| Metrics dashboard | Continuous | Key performance indicators for emergency response | Public website |
| Affected parties notice | Within 48 hours | Any action materially affecting private parties | Affected parties, Board |
| Expenditure report | Monthly | All spending under emergency authority | Board, GAO, public website |

**Monthly Report Contents:**

The Board's monthly status reports shall include, at minimum:

1. **Emergency status**: Current state of underlying emergency declaration
2. **Proportionality assessment**: Whether authority exercised remains proportionate to need
3. **Scope creep analysis**: Any expansion of authority beyond original order and justification
4. **Timeline projection**: Updated estimate of when emergency authority will end
5. **Transition planning**: Steps being taken to return authority to normal allocation
6. **Complaints received**: Summary of complaints from affected jurisdictions or parties
7. **Judicial challenges**: Status of any pending legal challenges
8. **Dissenting views**: Any Board member concerns about continuation

**Public Access Requirements:**

- All Board deliberations on emergency reclassification renewal shall be conducted in public session
- Operational logs (except national security classified information) shall be published within 7 days
- Any affected jurisdiction or party may request expedited Board review of specific actions taken under emergency authority
- The Board shall maintain a public emergency reclassification portal showing all active emergency orders, their status, and operational reports

**Exercising Entity Accountability:**

The entity exercising emergency authority is subject to:

| Accountability Mechanism | Trigger | Consequence |
|-------------------------|---------|-------------|
| Board investigation | Credible complaint of abuse or overreach | Formal findings, public report |
| Emergency authority suspension | Finding of material abuse | Immediate stay, expedited judicial review |
| Cost recovery | Unjustified expenditures | Clawback from exercising entity |
| Personnel removal | Individual official misconduct | Removal from emergency role, referral for discipline |
| Damages liability | Willful or reckless harm to private parties | Civil liability, attorney fees |

**Automatic Review Triggers:**

The Board shall conduct immediate review (within 72 hours) if any of the following occur during emergency reclassification:

- Exercising entity expands operations beyond scope specified in emergency order
- More than 10 complaints filed by affected parties in any 30-day period
- Expenditures exceed projections by more than 25%
- Affected jurisdiction formally objects to continuation
- Media or oversight reports allege abuse of emergency authority
- Exercising entity fails to submit required operational reports

Failure to pass automatic review results in immediate suspension of emergency authority pending full Board hearing.

**Limitations on Emergency Reclassification:**

Emergency reclassification may NOT:

- Transfer authority to a level that lacks capacity to exercise it
- Override explicit constitutional assignments (only statutory allocations)
- Be used to circumvent normal reclassification when no true emergency exists
- Extend beyond the geographic scope of the declared emergency
- Continue after the underlying emergency ends

**Abuse Prevention:**

- **Pattern of abuse**: If the Board issues emergency reclassifications that are subsequently found unwarranted (by court or GAO review) more than twice in 24 months, enhanced procedural requirements apply:
    - Supermajority (6 of 9) required for emergency reclassifications
    - Automatic GAO review of all emergency orders
    - Congressional notification expanded to include committee briefing
- **Judicial review**: Emergency reclassifications may be challenged in Regional Courts
    - Standard of review: Clear error for factual findings; de novo for legal conclusions
    - Expedited review: Decision within 14 days
    - Stay pending review: Available upon showing of substantial likelihood of success

**Transition from Emergency to Permanent:**

If circumstances warrant permanent reclassification:

- Board shall initiate standard reclassification petition (Section 5.2) before emergency order expires
- Emergency reclassification may be extended during pendency of standard petition
- Permanent reclassification requires full Section 5.2 procedures including public comment

### 5.4 Mandatory Periodic Re-Review

**Cycle Requirement:**

To prevent classification calcification as spillover patterns evolve:

| Requirement | Specification |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Universal review cycle** | Every classified policy domain shall be re-reviewed at least once every 5 years |
| **Major domain review** | Category A (mandatory regional authority) and Category B (coordination required) domains shall be re-reviewed at least once every 3 years |
| **Proactive Board responsibility** | The Board shall initiate re-review sua sponte; no petition is required |
| **Rolling schedule** | The Board shall publish a 5-year rolling review schedule showing when each domain will be re-reviewed |

**Re-Review Triggers:**

In addition to the scheduled review cycle, the Board shall initiate re-review when:

1. **Certified data shows significant change**: Annual data certification (Section 3.4) reveals a ≥10-point shift in any scoring dimension
2. **Multiple jurisdictions request**: Three or more affected jurisdictions jointly request re-review (not subject to petition fees)
3. **GAO recommendation**: GAO audit recommends re-review based on changed circumstances
4. **Post-emergency assessment**: Any emergency reclassification has expired within the prior 24 months
5. **Adjacent domain reclassification**: A related policy domain has been reclassified in a manner that may affect spillover patterns

**Re-Review Process:**

| Stage | Timeline | Board Action |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Initiation | Per schedule or trigger | Board publishes notice of re-review with data sources |
| Staff analysis | 60 days | Board staff re-scores domain using current certified data |
| Preliminary finding | 30 days | Board issues preliminary finding: maintain, upgrade, or downgrade |
| Public comment | 60 days | Affected jurisdictions and public may comment |
| Final determination | 60 days after comment close | Board issues final classification with effective date |
| **Total maximum timeline** | **210 days from initiation** | |

**Outcomes of Re-Review:**

| Finding | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Maintain** | Classification unchanged; stability period resets (36 months until next petition eligible) |
| **Upgrade** | Authority moves to higher level (e.g., State → Regional); transition period applies |
| **Downgrade** | Authority moves to lower level (e.g., Regional → State); phase-out period applies |
| **Split** | Domain split into sub-domains with different classifications |

**Transition for Changed Classifications:**

When re-review results in upgrade or downgrade:

- **Upgrade**: Assuming jurisdiction has 12 months to establish administrative capacity; interim coordination required
- **Downgrade**: Surrendering jurisdiction has 18 months to transfer programs; no premature termination of ongoing activities
- **Personnel protections**: Employees in affected programs have priority placement and separation rights (per Section 9.6)

**Failure to Complete Re-Review:**

If the Board fails to complete scheduled re-review within 300 days:

- Current classification remains in force
- Board Chair must report to Congress explaining delay
- Affected jurisdictions may petition for expedited re-review (no filing fee; 180-day decision deadline)
- GAO shall audit Board performance if delays exceed 2 in any 12-month period

**Publication and Accountability:**

The Board shall publish annually:

- **Review schedule**: Complete 5-year rolling schedule with estimated re-review dates for all domains
- **Review status report**: Progress on current-year reviews, including delays and explanations
- **Trend analysis**: Summary of how spillover patterns are evolving across all classified domains
- **Recommendations**: Any legislative or regulatory changes needed to address systemic spillover changes

## 6. Conflict Resolution Mechanisms

### 6.1 Conflict Types

| Type | Description | Resolution Path |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Vertical** | Dispute over which level has authority | Allocation Review Board → Regional Courts |
| **Horizontal** | Dispute between same-level jurisdictions | Regional mediation → Regional Courts |
| **Boundary** | Overlap or gap in assigned powers | Allocation Review Board determination |

### 6.2 Resolution Ladder

**Step 1: Negotiation (30 days)**

- Direct negotiation between affected parties
- No formal proceedings required

**Step 2: Mediation (60 days)**

- Allocation Review Board assigns mediator
- Non-binding recommendations

**Step 3: Board Determination (90 days)**

- Formal hearing before Board panel
- Binding determination subject to judicial review

**Step 4: Judicial Review**

- Appeal to Regional Constitutional Court
- Review limited to legal error, not policy judgment

**Automatic Status-Quo Orders and Default Controls:**

To prevent disputes from stalling through delay tactics:

| Stage | Deadline Missed | Automatic Consequence |
|-------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Negotiation** | 30 days without agreement or written extension | Automatic referral to mediation; status quo frozen as of Day 0 |
| **Mediation commencement** | Responding party fails to appear within 14 days of mediator assignment | Mediator may proceed ex parte; adverse inference against non-appearing party |
| **Mediation participation** | Party fails to provide required submissions within mediation timeline | Submissions deemed waived; mediator recommendation based on available record |
| **Mediation completion** | 60 days without resolution | Automatic referral to Board determination; interim status-quo order issued |
| **Board response** | Responding party fails to file response within 30 days | Allegations deemed admitted for procedural purposes; expedited Board decision |
| **Board determination** | Board fails to issue determination within 90 days | Complainant may seek mandamus; daily monitoring reports required |
| **Compliance** | Party fails to comply with Board determination within 30 days | Automatic enforcement referral (Section 10); daily penalties commence |

**Interim Status-Quo Orders:**

Upon any missed deadline, the following status-quo order is automatically in effect without motion:

1. **Freeze provision**: Neither party may change its position from Day 0 of the dispute (the date the dispute was formally initiated)
2. **Continuation provision**: Activities underway as of Day 0 may continue; new activities in disputed area are prohibited
3. **Reporting provision**: Both parties must file weekly status reports with the Board during pendency
4. **Resource provision**: Neither party may reallocate resources from disputed activities during pendency

**Default Interim Controls for Stalled Disputes:**

If any stage exceeds its deadline by more than 30 days:

| Days Past Deadline | Default Control |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| 31-60 days | Board appoints interim monitor with access to both parties' operations in disputed area |
| 61-90 days | Delaying party loses right to exercise disputed authority until resolution |
| 91-120 days | Complaining party may exercise disputed authority on interim basis pending resolution |
| 121+ days | Board Chair may impose interim allocation binding until final determination |

**Good Cause Extensions:**

Deadlines may be extended upon showing of:

- Mutual agreement of all parties (maximum 30-day extension per stage)
- Extraordinary circumstances beyond party's control (documented)
- Need for additional technical analysis (Board determination only)

Extension requests must be filed before deadline expires. No stage may exceed 2x its original timeline absent Board finding of extraordinary circumstances.

**Anti-Delay Sanctions:**

Parties who engage in dilatory tactics are subject to:

| Conduct | Sanction |
|---------|----------|
| Repeated failure to meet deadlines (3+ in single dispute) | Costs and attorney fees to opposing party |
| Bad faith delay (documented intent to prolong) | Adverse inference on merits; expedited default judgment |
| Frivolous extensions | Filing fee ($5,000) for future extension requests |
| Non-cooperation with monitor | Monitor may recommend default against non-cooperating party |

**Preservation of Rights:**

Automatic status-quo orders and default controls:

- Do not constitute final determination on the merits
- May be modified or dissolved by the Board upon motion for good cause
- Do not prevent parties from settling at any time
- Automatically expire upon final determination (Board or judicial)

### 6.3 Interim Authority

**Default Rule:**

During disputes, absent an interim order:

- Lower level retains authority pending resolution (subsidiarity presumption)
- No jurisdiction may unilaterally expand authority during dispute
- Emergency actions require Board certification

**Interim Relief Motions:**

Any party to an allocation dispute may seek interim relief at any stage of the resolution ladder:

| Motion Type | Purpose | Decision Maker |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| Temporary restraining order | Immediate halt to disputed activity (72 hours) | Board Chair or designee |
| Preliminary injunction | Maintain status quo pending resolution | Board panel (3 members) |
| Monitoring order | Require reporting on disputed activities | Board panel or mediator |
| Interim authority transfer | Temporary shift of authority pending resolution | Full Board (majority vote) |

**Standards for Interim Relief:**

The Board or court shall grant interim relief upon a showing of:

1. **Likelihood of success**: Moving party demonstrates substantial likelihood of prevailing on allocation question
2. **Irreparable harm**: Absent relief, moving party will suffer harm that cannot be remedied by final decision
3. **Balance of equities**: Harm to moving party outweighs harm to responding party from interim order
4. **Public interest**: Interim relief serves the public interest in orderly allocation of powers

For temporary restraining orders (72 hours), only factors 2 and 4 need be shown.

**Expedited Interim Procedures:**

| Stage | Timeline |
|-------|----------|
| Motion filed | Day 0 |
| Response due | 7 days (3 days for TRO) |
| Hearing | 14 days (24 hours for TRO) |
| Decision | 21 days (72 hours for TRO) |

**Scope of Interim Orders:**

Interim orders may:

- Prohibit exercise of disputed authority
- Require maintenance of status quo ante (conditions before dispute arose)
- Impose reporting and monitoring requirements
- Require posting of bond for potential damages
- Temporarily transfer authority to neutral administrator

Interim orders may NOT:

- Permanently resolve the allocation question
- Exceed the scope of relief available in final determination
- Create new powers not authorized by Constitution or statute

**Monitoring During Disputes:**

Upon request or sua sponte, the Board may impose monitoring requirements:

- **Activity reporting**: Responding party must report all actions taken under disputed authority (weekly)
- **Third-party monitor**: Independent monitor observes and reports on disputed activities
- **Document preservation**: All records related to disputed authority must be preserved
- **Stakeholder notice**: Affected parties must be notified that authority is disputed

Failure to comply with monitoring requirements:

- Creates adverse inference in allocation proceeding
- May result in interim authority transfer
- Constitutes contempt subject to daily penalties

**Duration and Modification:**

- Temporary restraining orders: Maximum 72 hours; may be renewed once
- Preliminary injunctions: Remain in effect until final determination or modified
- Monitoring orders: Remain in effect until final determination
- Any party may move to modify or dissolve interim orders upon changed circumstances
- Board shall review interim orders every 90 days during prolonged disputes

**Enforcement:**

- Interim orders are immediately enforceable upon issuance
- Violation of interim order is contempt; subject to daily penalties of up to $100,000
- Willful violation by officials may result in removal for cause
- Courts may enforce Board interim orders through contempt power

**Appeal of Interim Orders:**

- Interim orders may be appealed to Regional Courts within 14 days
- Appeal does not stay interim order unless court finds:
    - Substantial likelihood that interim order was erroneously granted
    - Irreparable harm from continued enforcement
- Expedited appellate review: Decision within 30 days

### 6.4 Inter-Regional Infrastructure Disputes

[Article I, Section 6](../02-design/constitution.md) (Right of Transit and Non-Blockade) provides expedited procedures for disputes involving infrastructure access between Regions:

**Expedited Timeline:**

- Mediation: 14 days (not 60 days)
- Injunctive relief available immediately from Regional Courts
- Federal backup jurisdiction if Regional courts unavailable

**Federal Enforcement Authority:**

In cases of blockade or unreasonable denial of access, the federal government may:

- Order immediate restoration of access
- Withhold equalization transfers from offending Region
- Assume temporary operational control of affected infrastructure

**Applicability:**

This expedited process applies to disputes involving:

- Transportation infrastructure connecting Regions
- Energy transmission systems
- Communication networks
- Any infrastructure necessary for inter-regional commerce

## 8. Compact and Coordination Requirements

### 8.1 Mandatory Compacts

Regions shall establish binding compacts for:

- Energy grid interconnection and reliability
- Major transportation corridor maintenance
- Watershed management for shared water bodies
- Air quality management for non-attainment areas

### 8.2 Compact Standards

All compacts must:

- Include dispute resolution procedures
- Specify cost-sharing formulas
- Provide for public participation
- Be ratified by affected Regional legislatures

### 8.3 Pre-Cleared Compacts

The Board may designate model compacts as "pre-cleared" for:

- Expedited adoption
- Presumption of validity
- Federal technical assistance

### 8.4 Adoption Timeline and Deadlines

**Mandatory Compact Deadlines:**

| Compact Domain | Negotiation Deadline | Adoption Deadline | Full Implementation |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Energy grid interconnection | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 |
| Transportation corridors | Year 2 | Year 3 | Year 4 |
| Watershed management | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |
| Air quality management | Year 3 | Year 4 | Year 5 |

**Negotiation Requirements:**

- Regions sharing mandatory compact domains shall commence negotiations within 180 days of the Phase-In Period
- The Board shall designate a lead Region for each mandatory compact based on:
    - Geographic centrality
    - Administrative capacity
    - Willingness to serve
- Lead Region shall convene initial negotiations and provide secretariat services
- All affected Regions shall participate in good faith

**Extension Requests:**

- Regions may jointly request deadline extensions from the Board
- Extensions require showing of:
    - Good faith negotiation efforts
    - Specific obstacles requiring additional time
    - Proposed timeline for resolution
- Maximum extension: 12 months per compact
- No more than two extensions per compact

**Post-Transition Mandatory Compact Designation:**

When the Board designates a new mandatory compact after the initial transition period:

| Stage | Deadline | Requirement |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Designation notice | Day 0 | Board publishes mandatory compact designation with affected Regions |
| Negotiation commencement | 90 days | Affected Regions must convene initial negotiation session |
| Draft compact submission | 270 days | Participating Regions must submit draft compact to Board for review |
| Board review | 60 days | Board reviews draft for compliance with constitutional requirements |
| Regional ratification | 180 days after Board approval | Each affected Region must ratify the compact |
| Full implementation | 365 days after ratification | Compact must be fully operational |

**Failure to Meet Post-Transition Deadlines:**

| Missed Deadline | Consequence |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Negotiation commencement | Board appoints federal mediator; Region bears mediation costs |
| Draft compact submission | Board may impose interim coordination requirements on non-complying Regions |
| Regional ratification | Board imposes default compact terms (see below) |
| Full implementation | Enforcement under Sections 8.6 and 10 |

**Default Compact Terms:**

If a Region fails to ratify a mandatory compact within 180 days of Board approval:

1. **Automatic imposition**: The Board shall impose default compact terms binding on the non-ratifying Region
2. **Default terms content**: Default terms shall:
    - Require minimum coordination specified by the Board
    - Impose cost-sharing obligations based on population and fiscal capacity
    - Establish dispute resolution through Board arbitration
    - Permit withdrawal only upon adoption of fully negotiated compact
3. **No consent required**: Default terms bind the non-ratifying Region without its consent
4. **Enforcement**: Violation of default terms triggers full enforcement under Sections 8.6 and 10
5. **Incentive to negotiate**: Default terms are designed to be less favorable than negotiated compacts to incentivize good-faith negotiation

**Board Authority to Impose Default Terms:**

The Board's authority to impose default terms is limited to:

- Mandatory compact domains designated by the Board
- Terms necessary and proportionate to address the coordination need that triggered mandatory designation
- Terms consistent with constitutional allocation of powers

Default terms may NOT:

- Transfer authority beyond what the Spillover Matrix classification supports
- Impose fiscal obligations exceeding 0.5% of a Region's annual budget without Regional consent
- Require policy choices beyond minimum coordination (e.g., may require pollution monitoring but not specific emission standards)

### 8.5 Monitoring and Reporting

**Compact Performance Monitoring:**

The Board shall monitor compliance with mandatory compacts through:

| Monitoring Element | Frequency | Responsible Party |
|--------------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Compact adoption status | Quarterly | Board staff |
| Performance metrics | Annual | Compact governing body |
| Financial reporting | Annual | Participating Regions |
| Dispute activity | Quarterly | Compact governing body |
| Public participation | Annual | Compact governing body |

**Required Compact Reporting:**

Each mandatory compact governing body shall submit to the Board:

**Quarterly Reports:**

- Implementation milestones achieved
- Disputes filed and resolved
- Material changes to compact terms
- Financial status of shared programs

**Annual Reports:**

- Performance against compact objectives
- Cost-sharing compliance by each participating Region
- Public participation activities and outcomes
- Recommended amendments or improvements
- Five-year performance projections

**Board Reporting:**

The Board shall publish:

- Annual Compact Compliance Report covering all mandatory compacts
- Identification of Regions failing to meet compact obligations
- Recommendations for enforcement action
- Best practices from high-performing compacts

### 8.6 Non-Compliance Consequences

This section establishes compact-specific enforcement that supplements the general enforcement provisions in Section 10. Compact non-compliance is subject to the specialized procedures below. **Critically, Section 10.4 establishes that any compact violation automatically activates the full enforcement ladder** — a Region may not claim compliance with allocation requirements while refusing compact obligations.

**Failure to Adopt Mandatory Compact:**

If a Region fails to adopt a mandatory compact by the applicable deadline:

| Stage | Timeline | Consequence |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Warning | Deadline +30 days | Formal notice from Board; 90-day cure period |
| Mediation | Deadline +120 days | Mandatory mediation with other affected Regions |
| Escalation | Deadline +180 days | Board determination of non-compliance; referral for enforcement |
| Sanctions | Deadline +210 days | Graduated penalties commence (see below) |

**Graduated Penalty Structure:**

| Months Past Deadline | Penalty |
|---------------------|---------|
| 7-12 months | 2% reduction in equalization transfers |
| 13-18 months | 5% reduction in equalization transfers |
| 19-24 months | 10% reduction in equalization transfers |
| >24 months | Federal backup authority activated (Section 8.7) |

**Failure to Comply with Adopted Compact:**

If a Region violates the terms of an adopted compact:

- Affected Regions may invoke compact dispute resolution procedures
- If dispute resolution fails, affected Regions may petition the Board
- Board may impose remedial orders including:
    - Specific performance requirements
    - Reimbursement to affected Regions
    - Temporary suspension of non-compliant Region's voting rights in compact governance
- Persistent non-compliance (3+ Board remedial orders in 24 months) triggers equalization transfer penalties

**Penalty Proceeds:**

- Equalization transfer penalties are not forfeited but held in escrow
- Escrowed funds are released upon:
    - Adoption of required compact, OR
    - Compliance with compact terms for 12 consecutive months
- If non-compliance persists beyond 36 months, escrowed funds are distributed to compliant Regions in the same compact

### 8.7 Federal Backup Authority

**Activation Conditions:**

Federal backup authority is activated when:

- A Region remains non-compliant with mandatory compact requirements for more than 24 months; OR
- Non-compliance creates imminent risk to public health, safety, or critical infrastructure; OR
- Affected Regions jointly petition for federal intervention

**Federal Backup Powers:**

Upon activation, the federal government may:

1. **Impose interim arrangements**: Establish temporary coordination requirements binding on non-compliant Region
2. **Designate federal coordinator**: Appoint a federal official to manage coordination functions pending compact adoption
3. **Direct resource allocation**: Require non-compliant Region to contribute fair share to coordination costs
4. **Assume operational control**: Take temporary control of infrastructure requiring coordination (last resort)

**Limitations on Federal Backup:**

- Federal backup authority is temporary (maximum 3 years per activation)
- Federal government must operate under terms comparable to model compact
- Non-compliant Region retains right to exit federal backup by adopting qualifying compact
- Federal backup costs are charged to non-compliant Region
- All federal backup actions are subject to judicial review

**Restoration of Regional Authority:**

Federal backup authority terminates when:

- Non-compliant Region adopts qualifying compact with affected Regions; AND
- Board certifies compact meets mandatory standards; AND
- Region demonstrates 6 months of good-faith compliance

### 8.8 Compact Amendment and Withdrawal

**Amendment Procedures:**

- Compacts may be amended by agreement of participating Regions
- Amendments to mandatory compacts require Board review for continued compliance with Section 8.2 standards
- Material amendments require public notice and comment (30 days minimum)

**Withdrawal from Mandatory Compacts:**

- No Region may unilaterally withdraw from a mandatory compact while mandatory compact requirements remain in force
- Withdrawal is permitted only if:
    - The Region is no longer within a mandatory compact domain (e.g., no longer shares watershed); OR
    - All affected Regions consent to withdrawal and alternative arrangements; OR
    - Congress removes the domain from mandatory compact requirements
- Attempted unilateral withdrawal triggers non-compliance procedures

---

## 9. Transition Provisions

### 9.1 Phase-In Period

- **Year 1**: Board established, initial classifications issued
- **Year 2**: Category A powers transfer to Regions
- **Year 3**: Category B coordination requirements take effect
- **Years 4-5**: Full implementation with ongoing adjustment

### 9.2 Existing Programs

Federal programs in regional domains shall be:

- Transferred to Regions with funding
- Administered jointly during transition
- Fully devolved by end of Phase-In Period

### 9.3 Personnel

Federal employees in transferred programs may:

- Transfer to Regional employment with comparable compensation
- Remain federal employees detailed to Regions
- Accept separation packages

### 9.4 Appropriations and Funding Transfer

**Mandatory Spending Classification:**

- All program funding transferred to Regions under this Act is classified as mandatory spending
- Appropriations are automatic upon certification of Regional readiness by the Allocation Review Board
- Funding levels are not subject to annual appropriations discretion during the Phase-In Period

**Baseline Funding Guarantee:**

- Each Region shall receive no less than the sum of federal spending in transferred program areas within its territory for the three fiscal years preceding transfer, adjusted for:
    - Inflation (using CPI-U)
    - Population changes (using Census estimates)
    - Programmatic changes enacted after baseline calculation
- Baseline calculations shall be certified by the Government Accountability Office

**Transfer Mechanics:**

1. **Pre-Transfer (Year 0)**: Treasury establishes Regional Transition Accounts for each Region
2. **Year 1**: 50% of baseline flows to Regional Transition Accounts; Regions begin parallel administration
3. **Year 2**: 75% flows directly to Regions; federal agencies provide technical assistance
4. **Year 3**: 100% flows to Regions; federal oversight limited to compliance monitoring
5. **Years 4-5**: Funding adjusts to standard equalization formula ([Fiscal Equalization Act](04-fiscal-equalization-act.md))

**Appropriations Backstop:**

If Congress fails to enact conforming appropriations legislation:

- The Secretary of the Treasury shall transfer funds automatically per the baseline guarantee
- Such transfers are not subject to sequestration, rescission, or deferral
- Failure to transfer triggers standing for Regions to sue in Regional Courts

### 9.5 Cost Estimates and Baseline Calculations

**Responsible Agencies:**

4. **Ongoing federal costs**: Retained functions (oversight, data collection, appeals)

**Dispute Resolution:**

- Regions may challenge baseline calculations within 60 days of GAO certification
- Challenges heard by a three-member panel: one OMB designee, one Regional designee, one GAO designee
- Panel determination is final and binding for funding purposes

### 9.6 Agency Handoff Protocols

**Memoranda of Understanding:**

Each transferring federal agency shall execute an MOU with each receiving Region specifying:

- Inventory of transferred functions, personnel, assets, and obligations
- Timeline for phased handoff (aligned with Section 9.4)

- **Year 3**: Full Regional operation with federal technical assistance available
- **Years 4-5**: Clean break with exception processing for residual matters

**Accountability During Transition:**

- Federal agencies retain responsibility for program outcomes until formal handoff certification
- Regional governments assume responsibility upon certification
- Joint accountability period for 90 days following certification (both may be audited)
- Inspector Generals of transferring agencies shall audit handoff compliance
- GAO shall conduct government-wide transition audit at Years 2 and 5

**Failure to Execute MOUs:**

If a federal agency fails to execute required MOUs:

- The Allocation Review Board may certify Regional readiness unilaterally
- Funding transfers proceed per Section 9.4
- Agency head is subject to congressional reporting requirements and potential removal for cause
- Regions may sue for specific performance in Regional Courts

---

## 10. Enforcement and Penalties

This section establishes general enforcement mechanisms for allocation violations. For compact-specific enforcement (including graduated equalization transfer penalties, federal backup authority, and escrow provisions), see Section 8.6. **Section 10.4 explicitly provides that compact violations automatically trigger all enforcement mechanisms in this section** — there is no gap between compact obligations and general enforcement.

### 10.1 Unauthorized Exercise of Power

Any level of government that exercises powers not allocated to it:

- Is subject to injunctive relief in Regional Courts
- May not enforce unauthorized actions
- Bears costs of affected parties

### 10.2 Failure to Exercise Required Authority

Any level of government that fails to exercise allocated powers when required:

- Is subject to mandamus in Regional Courts
- May trigger temporary assumption by higher level
- Must reimburse costs of substitute governance

### 10.3 Willful Violations

Officials who willfully violate allocation rules:

- May be removed from office through constitutional processes
- Are personally liable for damages (qualified immunity does not apply)
- May face federal prosecution for constitutional violations

### 10.3A Culpability Standards and Definitions

**Definition of "Willful":**

A violation is "willful" when the actor:

1. **Knew the conduct was unlawful** and proceeded anyway, OR
2. **Acted with reckless disregard** for whether the conduct was lawful, OR
3. **Deliberately avoided learning** the lawful allocation (willful blindness)

"Willful" does NOT require:

- Specific intent to violate the Constitution
- Malicious motive
- Actual harm to any party

**Culpability Tiers:**

| Tier | Standard | Definition | Consequences |
|------|----------|------------|--------------|
| **Willful** | Highest | Knew or should have known conduct was unauthorized; proceeded despite actual or constructive knowledge | Personal liability, removal, criminal referral |
| **Knowing** | High | Aware of facts making conduct unauthorized, even if unaware of legal conclusion | Personal liability, removal for cause |
| **Negligent** | Moderate | Failed to exercise reasonable care to determine lawful allocation | Institutional liability, remedial training |
| **Strict** | No fault | Violation occurred regardless of intent or knowledge | Injunctive relief, cost-shifting |

**Standards of Proof:**

| Claim Type | Standard | Rationale |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| Injunctive relief (Section 10.1) | Preponderance of the evidence | Equity relief requires lower threshold |
| Mandamus (Section 10.2) | Preponderance of the evidence | Ministerial duty clear |
| Institutional damages | Preponderance of the evidence | Compensatory purpose |
| Personal liability (willful/knowing) | Clear and convincing evidence | Protecting officials from frivolous suits |
| Removal from office | Clear and convincing evidence | Due process protection |
| Criminal referral | Probable cause (Board); beyond reasonable doubt (prosecution) | Criminal standards |

**Evidentiary Presumptions:**

The following create rebuttable presumptions of willfulness:

| Circumstance | Presumption | Rebuttal Standard |
|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Prior Board determination on same allocation question | Willful if official acted contrary | Clear and convincing evidence of good-faith legal basis for distinguishing |
| Written legal advice warning of violation | Knowing (minimum) | Evidence that official reasonably relied on contrary advice of equal authority |
| Pattern of similar violations (3+ in 24 months) | Willful | Clear and convincing evidence of intervening change in law or circumstances |
| Violation after cease-and-desist order | Willful | Showing that order was stayed or reversed on appeal |
| Failure to seek Board guidance when available | Negligent (minimum) | Evidence of exigent circumstances preventing inquiry |

**What Constitutes "Good Faith":**

A good-faith defense requires the official to demonstrate:

1. **Reasonable legal basis**: Reliance on a non-frivolous interpretation of allocation rules, supported by:
    - Written legal opinion from qualified counsel
    - Prior Board guidance (even if later overruled)
    - Published judicial precedent
    - Established administrative practice

2. **Procedural diligence**: The official:
    - Sought legal advice before acting
    - Disclosed the allocation question to appropriate oversight
    - Did not suppress contrary legal analysis
    - Documented the basis for the interpretation

3. **Proportionate response**: The action taken was:
    - No broader than necessary under the claimed interpretation
    - Subject to internal review and oversight
    - Capable of reversal if interpretation proved wrong

**What Does NOT Constitute Good Faith:**

The following do not establish good faith and may not be asserted as defenses:

| Claim | Why Insufficient |
|-------|------------------|
| "I believed it was constitutional" | Subjective belief without objective legal basis |
| "My lawyer said it was fine" (verbal, undocumented) | Unverifiable; no evidence of actual analysis |
| "We've always done it this way" | Past practice does not immunize unconstitutional conduct |
| "The other side does it too" | Allocation rules are non-partisan |
| "I was following orders" | Officials have independent duty to comply with allocation |
| "The Board is wrong" | Board determinations are presumptively valid absent judicial reversal |
| "I'll comply after appeal" | Violation continues during appeal absent stay |

**Burden-Shifting:**

1. **Initial burden**: Complaining party must show:
    - Conduct occurred
    - Conduct was outside actor's allocated authority
    - Standard of proof: preponderance of the evidence

2. **Burden shifts to defendant**: Once violation is established, defendant must show:
    - Any affirmative defense (Section 10.4)
    - Good faith (if asserting)
    - Standard: preponderance for affirmative defenses; clear and convincing to overcome willfulness presumption

3. **Damages/removal phase**: If willfulness is in dispute:
    - Complaining party must prove willfulness by clear and convincing evidence
    - OR defendant failed to rebut willfulness presumption

**Special Rule for Allocation Disputes:**

Given the systemic importance of maintaining proper allocation:

- **Lowered threshold for injunctive relief**: Complainant need show only "substantial question" about allocation (not likelihood of success) to obtain preliminary injunction
- **Automatic attorney fees**: Prevailing complainants recover attorney fees; prevailing defendants recover fees only if complaint was frivolous
- **Expedited proceedings**: Allocation disputes receive priority scheduling; decision within 90 days absent extraordinary circumstances
- **No qualified immunity**: Officials may not assert qualified immunity in allocation enforcement proceedings; the allocation framework provides clear notice of duties

### 10.4 Compact Violation as Enforcement Trigger

**Automatic Activation:**

Compact violations automatically trigger this enforcement section. No separate finding of "allocation violation" is required; compact non-compliance is per se an allocation violation subject to all enforcement mechanisms in Sections 10.1-10.3.

**Definition of Compact Violation:**

For purposes of this section, a "compact violation" includes:

| Violation Type | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Failure to ratify | Non-adoption of mandatory compact by deadline (Section 8.4) |
| Breach of terms | Violation of adopted compact provisions |
| Withdrawal violation | Attempted unilateral withdrawal from mandatory compact |
| Bad faith negotiation | Failure to negotiate in good faith as required by Section 8.4 |
| Reporting failure | Non-compliance with compact reporting requirements (Section 8.5) |
| Payment default | Failure to pay cost-share obligations under compact |

**Immediate Board Review:**

Upon credible report of a compact violation:

| Stage | Timeline | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Report received | Day 0 | Any affected Region, compact governing body, or the Board sua sponte may initiate |
| Preliminary review | 14 days | Board staff assesses whether violation is credible and material |
| Violation finding | 30 days | Board determines whether violation occurred |
| Remedial order | 45 days | Board issues specific relief and/or activates penalties |

**Automatic Penalty Activation:**

Upon Board finding of compact violation:

1. **Equalization transfer penalties** (Section 8.6) commence immediately without further action
2. **Injunctive relief** (Section 10.1) is presumptively available to affected Regions
3. **Mandamus** (Section 10.2) is available if violation involves failure to perform compact obligations
4. **Personal liability** (Section 10.3) attaches to officials who willfully cause or continue violation

**Burden of Proof:**

- The complaining party bears the burden of showing a violation occurred
- Standard: preponderance of the evidence
- Once a violation is established, the violating Region bears the burden of showing any affirmative defense

**Affirmative Defenses:**

A Region may avoid or mitigate penalties by showing:

| Defense | Standard | Effect |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Force majeure | Compliance was impossible due to circumstances beyond Region's control | Penalties tolled during force majeure period |
| Good faith dispute | Reasonable legal uncertainty about compact interpretation | Penalties suspended pending interpretation ruling |
| Substantial compliance | Region complied with all material terms; violation is technical | Reduced penalties or warning only |
| Cure | Region cured violation within 30 days of notice | Penalties waived for first violation only |

**Cumulative Remedies:**

- The remedies in this section are cumulative with, not alternative to, Section 8.6 compact-specific enforcement
- Affected Regions may pursue both compact dispute resolution and Section 10 enforcement simultaneously
- Recovery under both sections is permitted, but no double recovery for the same harm
- Federal backup authority (Section 8.7) remains available independent of Section 10 remedies

**No Compliance Claim Without Compact:**

A Region that refuses to adopt a mandatory compact may not claim compliance with allocation requirements on the ground that:

- No compact violation occurred (because no compact was adopted)
- The Region's unilateral actions substitute for compact coordination
- Other Regions failed to negotiate in good faith (absent Board finding to that effect)

Failure to adopt a mandatory compact is itself a continuing violation that triggers all enforcement mechanisms.

### 10.5 Enforcement Standing and Initiation Authority

**Who May Initiate Enforcement:**

To ensure allocation violations cannot persist for lack of a plaintiff:

| Initiating Party | Authority | Scope |
|------------------|-----------|-------|
| **Allocation Review Board** | May initiate enforcement sua sponte upon finding of violation | All allocation violations |
| **Affected jurisdiction** | Any government whose allocated powers are encroached or whose coordination rights are violated | Violations affecting that jurisdiction |
| **Regional government** | May enforce against member States and local governments | Violations within the Region |
| **Federal designated officer** | Attorney General or designee may enforce federal allocations | Federal power encroachment |
| **Compact governing body** | May enforce against member Regions | Compact violations |
| **Private parties** | May enforce when violation directly and concretely harms their rights | Rights floor violations; procedural violations |

**Board Enforcement Authority:**

The Board shall have independent enforcement authority including:

1. **Investigation**: Power to investigate suspected violations including subpoena authority for documents and testimony
2. **Notice of violation**: Power to issue formal notices of violation requiring response within 30 days
3. **Cease-and-desist orders**: Power to order immediate cessation of unauthorized activity pending resolution
4. **Referral**: Power to refer violations to Regional Courts, the Attorney General, or Congress as appropriate
5. **Penalty assessment**: Power to assess civil penalties up to $100,000 per day for continuing violations
6. **Publication**: Power to publish findings of violation, creating public record and evidentiary presumption

**Streamlined Administrative Notice Process:**

To prevent violations from persisting while awaiting litigation:

| Stage | Timeline | Effect |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Complaint received** | Day 0 | Any initiating party files complaint with Board |
| **Preliminary review** | 14 days | Board staff assesses whether complaint states colorable violation |
| **Notice of investigation** | 21 days | If colorable, Board issues formal notice; alleged violator must respond |
| **Response due** | 30 days from notice | Alleged violator must file written response with supporting evidence |
| **Preliminary finding** | 45 days from response | Board issues preliminary finding (violation/no violation) |
| **Interim order** | Same day as preliminary finding | If violation found, Board issues interim cease-and-desist |
| **Hearing request** | 14 days from preliminary finding | Either party may request evidentiary hearing |
| **Evidentiary hearing** | 60 days from request | Full hearing before Board panel |
| **Final order** | 30 days from hearing | Board issues final enforcement order |

**Automatic Enforcement for Flagrant Violations:**

For the following flagrant violations, enforcement is automatic upon Board finding:

| Violation Type | Automatic Consequence |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Continued exercise of authority after Board cease-and-desist | Daily penalties commence automatically; no separate enforcement action required |
| Defiance of judicial order on allocation | Referral to court for contempt; federal marshals may enforce |
| Pattern of violations (3+ in 24 months) | Automatic placement on enhanced monitoring; supermajority Board vote required to remove |
| Compact non-ratification after deadline | Default terms imposed automatically (Section 8.4); equalization penalties begin |
| Failure to respond to notice of violation | Allegations deemed admitted; default judgment |

**Designated Federal Officer:**

The Attorney General shall designate a senior official (Assistant Attorney General level or above) as the Federal Allocation Enforcement Officer with authority to:

- Monitor allocation compliance nationwide
- Coordinate with Board on enforcement priorities
- Initiate enforcement actions in Regional Courts
- Appear as amicus in private enforcement actions
- Report annually to Congress on allocation compliance

**Private Enforcement Rights:**

Private parties may bring enforcement actions when:

1. **Direct harm**: The allocation violation directly and concretely harms the party's legally protected interests
2. **Exhaustion waived**: No requirement to exhaust administrative remedies if:
   - The violation is ongoing and causing continuing harm
   - Administrative remedy would take more than 90 days
   - The Board has declined to investigate
3. **Remedies available**: Private parties may obtain:
   - Declaratory judgment on allocation question
   - Injunctive relief against unauthorized exercise of power
   - Damages for injuries proximately caused by violation
   - Attorney fees if substantially prevailing
4. **No gatekeeping**: Private enforcement supplements, does not replace, public enforcement; private parties need not wait for government action

**Coordination of Enforcement:**

To avoid duplicative proceedings:

- Multiple enforcement actions on the same violation shall be consolidated before a single tribunal
- The Board may intervene as of right in any enforcement proceeding in Regional Courts
- Private parties may intervene in Board enforcement proceedings if they have direct stake in outcome
- Settlement of any enforcement action requires notice to all parties with potential claims
