## 2026-01-20: Constitutional Consistency Review

Comprehensive review addressing conflicts between constitutional text and implementing statutes, internal inconsistencies, and citation drift identified in [review.md](review.md).

### Critical Conflicts Resolved

#### 1. ARB Composition Conflict
- **File:** [03-allocation-framework-act.md](05-implementation/03-allocation-framework-act.md)
- **Change:** Updated Board composition from "state legislative leaders" to "Chief Justice appointees from among retired federal and state appellate judges"
- **Rationale:** Align with Constitution Article II, Section 5(b)

#### 2. Water Resources Board Composition Conflict
- **File:** [water-resources-coordination-act.md](proposals/water-resources-coordination-act.md)
- **Change:** Updated Board composition to match Constitution: one representative per Region, EPA rep, Army Corps rep, two Tribal representatives
- **Rationale:** Align with Constitution Article I, Section 7(e)

#### 3. National Water Court Article Reference
- **File:** [water-resources-coordination-act.md](proposals/water-resources-coordination-act.md)
- **Change:** Changed "Article XIV, Section 7" to "Article I, Section 7(f)"
- **Rationale:** Water Court is established in Article I, not Article XIV

#### 4. ARB Appeal Venue Conflict
- **File:** [03-allocation-framework-act.md](05-implementation/03-allocation-framework-act.md)
- **Change:** Changed appeal venue from "Regional Constitutional Court" to "Supreme Court per Article II, Section 5(f)"
- **Rationale:** Constitution routes appeals to Supreme Court; "Regional Constitutional Court" was undefined

#### 5. Equalization Withholding vs Anti-Coercion Rule
- **Files:**
  - [03-allocation-framework-act.md](05-implementation/03-allocation-framework-act.md)
  - [national-common-market-access-act.md](proposals/national-common-market-access-act.md)
  - [transboundary-environmental-protection-act.md](proposals/transboundary-environmental-protection-act.md)
  - [water-resources-coordination-act.md](proposals/water-resources-coordination-act.md)
- **Change:** Removed all equalization transfer withholding penalties; replaced with civil penalties collectible through federal courts; added explicit notes citing Article X, Section 4 (Anti-Coercion Rule)
- **Rationale:** Constitution prohibits coercive conditional funding including equalization withholding

#### 6. Two-Key Authorization Conflicts
- **Files:**
  - [06-armed-forces.md](02-design/06-armed-forces.md)
  - [de-escalation-procedures-act.md](proposals/de-escalation-procedures-act.md)
- **Changes:**
  - Updated design doc threshold from "supermajority (two-thirds)" to "majority"
  - Removed Guard generals option from De-Escalation Act
  - Added note that two-key authorization may not be delegated to military officers per Article XI, Section 2(g)
- **Rationale:** Align with Constitution Article XI, Section 2(g) which specifies majority threshold and prohibits military officer delegation

#### 7. Transition Act Jurisdiction Timing
- **File:** [02-transition-act.md](05-implementation/02-transition-act.md)
- **Change:** Updated Section 9.2 to clarify mandatory jurisdiction activates "upon ratification, per Article XIX, Section 3" with note that provisions do not wait until Phase III
- **Rationale:** Resolve internal conflict between Sections 9.2 and 9.3

#### 8. Tribal Compacts Mandatory vs Optional
- **File:** [tribal-regional-relations.md](proposals/tribal-regional-relations.md)
- **Change:** Restructured Section 3.4 to distinguish (a) mandatory coordination compacts (constitutionally required) from (b) optional governance participation in broader Regional structures
- **Rationale:** Constitution mandates compacts for coordination; broader participation should remain voluntary

#### 9. D.C./Territory Senate Representation
- **Files:**
  - [06-supremacy.md](02-design/constitution/06-supremacy.md) - Article XX, Sections 1(b) and 2(b)
  - [03-regional-governance.md](02-design/constitution/03-regional-governance.md) - Article IV, Section 3
  - [dc-status-determination-act.md](proposals/dc-status-determination-act.md)
  - [territories-status-act.md](proposals/territories-status-act.md)
- **Changes:**
  - Added constitutional transitional provisions establishing D.C. and territorial Senators as "at-large members of the Senate with full voting rights" until Regional assignment
  - Added "Transitional Exception" note to Senate section
  - Updated implementing statutes to reference constitutional provisions
- **Rationale:** Resolve conflict between "Senate represents Regions equally" and pre-assignment D.C./territory Senators

### Internal Inconsistencies Resolved

#### 10. Tribal Nation Definition Cross-Reference
- **File:** [07-implementation.md](02-design/constitution/07-implementation.md)
- **Change:** Added cross-reference to Article XXII definition: "*See also Article XVIII, Section 3(b) for interpretive conventions regarding tribal sovereignty and the scope of constitutional protections.*"
- **Rationale:** Clarify relationship between inherent sovereignty (all tribes) and constitutional mechanisms (federally recognized tribes)

#### 11. Equalization Cap vs Constitutional Floor
- **File:** [04-fiscal-equalization-act.md](05-implementation/04-fiscal-equalization-act.md)
- **Change:** Added "Constitutional Floor Exception" to Section 4.4: "The 15% cap does not apply to the extent necessary to fund the constitutional minimum floor under Article X, Section 3-A."
- **Rationale:** Ensure 15% cap doesn't undercut constitutionally required minimum floor for small Regions

#### 12. National Election Court Establishment
- **File:** [05-elections-implementation-act.md](05-implementation/05-elections-implementation-act.md)
- **Change:** Added Section 7.5 formally establishing the National Election Court pursuant to Article XIV-RF, Section 2(b), with composition (15 judges), jurisdiction, and panel procedures
- **Rationale:** Constitution only authorizes ("may establish"); statute now actually establishes the court

#### 13. Article Citation Corrections
- **File:** [05-elections-implementation-act.md](05-implementation/05-elections-implementation-act.md)
- **Changes:**
  - Changed "Article VI, Section 4" to "Article VII, Section 4" (elections article)
  - Changed purpose statement from "Article XVII" to "Article XXI"
- **File:** [04-fiscal-equalization-act.md](05-implementation/04-fiscal-equalization-act.md)
- **Change:** Changed purpose statement from "Article XVII" to "Article XXI, Section 1 (implementing Article X, Fiscal System)"

### Citation/Numbering Drift Resolved

#### 14. ARB Article Citations
- **Files:**
  - [interregional-coordination-review-act.md](proposals/interregional-coordination-review-act.md)
  - [interregional-joint-authority-template.md](proposals/interregional-joint-authority-template.md)
- **Change:** Changed "Article XIV" references to "Article II, Section 5"; updated links to powers-and-rights.md
- **Rationale:** ARB is established in Article II, not Article XIV

#### 15. DLRS Citations
- **Files:**
  - [interregional-joint-authority-template.md](proposals/interregional-joint-authority-template.md)
  - [tribal-regional-relations.md](proposals/tribal-regional-relations.md)
  - [interregional-agency-compact-act.md](proposals/interregional-agency-compact-act.md)
  - [digital-ai-governance.md](proposals/digital-ai-governance.md)
- **Change:** Updated all DLRS citations to reference the proposal document: "[DLRS (Dual Legitimacy Rights Floor Statute)](dual-legitimacy-rights-floor-statute.md) - (proposed Article III, Section 4)"
- **Rationale:** DLRS is a proposal, not yet incorporated into Constitution; Article III currently has no Section 4

#### 16. Judiciary Navigation
- **File:** [09-judiciary.md](02-design/constitution/09-judiciary.md)
- **Change:** Changed "Previous: Elections (08-elections.md)" to "Previous: Implementation (07-implementation.md)"
- **Rationale:** 08-elections.md doesn't exist; elections is a standalone amendment

#### 17. Article Crosswalk Document
- **New File:** [article-crosswalk.md](02-design/constitution/article-crosswalk.md)
- **Content:**
  - Complete mapping of all article numbers (I-XXII) to their locations
  - Detailed sections for RF Core articles, standalone amendments, and RF supplements
  - Citation guidance for each article type
  - Common citation errors table
  - Architecture rationale
- **File:** [00-index.md](02-design/constitution/00-index.md)
- **Change:** Added "Article Crosswalk" section with link to crosswalk document and common citation errors
- **Rationale:** Provide canonical reference for modular architecture to prevent future citation errors

### Summary Statistics

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| Critical conflicts resolved | 9 |
| Internal inconsistencies resolved | 4 |
| Citation errors fixed | 4 categories |
| New documents created | 1 (article-crosswalk.md) |

### Additional Fixes

#### 18. Policy Applications TODO List

- **File:** [TODO.md](06-policy-applications/TODO.md)
- **Change:** Complete rewrite to reflect actual file structure:
    - Added file status table listing all 13 actual policy application files (01-healthcare through 13-social-safety-net)
    - Updated priority tiers to reference correct filenames
    - Added content requirements section
- **Rationale:** Old TODO referenced non-existent files (03-environment.md, 04-criminal-justice.md, 05-infrastructure.md, 06-labor.md, 07-education.md)

#### 19. Healthcare/Housing Article Citations

- **Files:**
    - [01-healthcare.md](06-policy-applications/01-healthcare.md)
    - [02-housing.md](06-policy-applications/02-housing.md)
- **Changes:**
    - Changed "Article XIV" to "Article XVII" for emergency coordination (healthcare line 97), with link to standalone emergency-powers-reform
    - Changed "Article VIII, Section 3" to "Article X, Section 3" for fiscal equalization (healthcare line 347, housing line 383), with links to 04-fiscal-system.md
- **Rationale:** Article VIII is Impeachment (standalone); Article X is Fiscal System (RF Core). Article XIV is Judicial Reform (standalone); Article XVII is Emergency Powers (standalone).

### Remaining Items (Not Addressed)

Per [review.md](review.md), the following items remain:

1. **Policy application content completion** - Many files are "Outline Only"
2. **Housing policy placeholders** - X/Y/Z variables need values
3. **Individual standalone article links** - Some documents still link to constitution/00-index.md for standalone articles (VII, XIV, XV, XVI, XVII) rather than single-topic/ directories
