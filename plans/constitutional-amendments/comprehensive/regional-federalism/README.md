# Regional Federalism Plan

A comprehensive constitutional redesign proposal for the United States, introducing a regional layer of government between the federal government and states.

## Overview

This plan addresses democratic dysfunction by distributing power across multiple levels, lowering the stakes of national politics, and creating structural barriers to authoritarian consolidation.

**Core Premise:** Political reform requires structural change, not just policy reform. Regional federalism creates a new constitutional architecture designed to survive polarization, bad faith, and institutional stress.

| 25 | [Housing Policy](06-policy-applications/02-housing.md) | How housing governance works under regional federalism |

## Key Design Principles

1. **Distribute power** - No single institution can dominate
2. **Lower existential stakes** - Losing an election isn't catastrophic
3. **Preserve real self-government** - Meaningful autonomy at each level
4. **Make abuse slow, visible, and reversible** - Structural friction against bad actors
5. **Prefer restoration over punishment** - De-escalation, not escalation

## Companion Plans

The following single-topic reforms can be adopted independently or as part of Regional Federalism:

| Plan | Description |
|------|-------------|
| [Election Reform](../../single-topic/election-reform/) | National popular vote and election administration |
| [Judicial Reform](../../single-topic/judicial-reform/) | Court structure and term limits |
| [Impeachment Reform](../../single-topic/impeachment-reform/) | Impeachment procedures |
| [Lobbying Reform](../../single-topic/lobbying-reform/) | Anti-corruption provisions |
| [Federal Reserve Reform](../../single-topic/federal-reserve-reform/) | Monetary policy independence |
| [Military Civilian Control](../../single-topic/military-civilian-control/) | Armed forces oversight |
| [Cyber Defense](../../single-topic/cyber-defense/) | Digital security framework |
| [Emergency Powers Reform](../../single-topic/emergency-powers-reform/) | Emergency authority limits |
| [Congressional Reform](../../single-topic/congressional-reform/) | Legislative branch reforms |
| [Executive Reform](../../single-topic/executive-reform/) | Executive branch reforms |
| [Tax Reform](../../single-topic/tax-reform/) | Taxation principles |

These plans originated as articles in the Regional Federal Constitution but have been extracted as standalone proposals that can be adopted without the full regional restructuring.
