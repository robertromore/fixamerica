## Relationship to Other Folders

### vs. `/06-policy-applications/`

| `/06-policy-applications/` | This Folder (`proposals/`) |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Conceptual analysis** — "Why and how" | **Statutory drafts** — "What exactly" |
| Essays explaining the framework | Legal text with sections and subsections |
| Strategic vision | Operational implementation |

**These folders are complementary, not duplicative.**

For each statutory proposal here, there may be a corresponding conceptual analysis in `/06-policy-applications/` that explains the underlying rationale.

### vs. `/05-implementation/`

| `/05-implementation/` | This Folder (`proposals/`) |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| **Core implementation acts** required by the Constitution | **Domain-specific proposals** for particular policy areas |
| 5 authoritative acts (Transition, Allocation, Fiscal, Elections, Safeguards) | 80+ domain proposals |
| Constitutional mandate | Supplementary legislation |

**Per the [Document Hierarchy](../DOCUMENT-HIERARCHY.md):** If a proposal here duplicates content in `/05-implementation/`, the `/05-implementation/` version is authoritative.

## Design Philosophy

These proposals reflect the Regional Federalism philosophy:

1. **Subsidiarity** - Decisions made at the lowest effective level
2. **Coordination without coercion** - Voluntary cooperation mechanisms
3. **Externality prevention** - Protections against cross-border harm
4. **Democratic accountability** - Clear lines of authority and oversight
5. **Flexibility with floors** - Regional variation above minimum standards
