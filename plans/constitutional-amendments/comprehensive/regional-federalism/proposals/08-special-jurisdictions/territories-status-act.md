# Territories Status Determination Act

This proposal establishes the statutory framework for the constitutional
territories provisions (Article XX, Section 2), providing detailed procedures
for territory participation in federal elections, Regional assignment, and
paths to defined governance status.

---

## Constitutional Foundation

Article XX, Section 2 of the Regional Federal Constitution establishes that:

> Residents of United States territories shall participate in federal elections.
> Territories shall be assigned to Regions with territorial consent. Congress
> shall provide paths for territories to petition for statehood, Regional
> assignment, or continued territorial status with defined representation.

This Act implements these principles through specific procedures.

---

## Purpose

Establish territory status procedures that:

- ensure territorial residents can participate in federal elections,
- provide fair processes for Regional assignment,
- establish clear paths to defined governance status,
- prevent indefinite territorial limbo,
- protect territorial self-determination.

---

## Part I: Federal Election Participation

### Section 1. Right to Participate

(a) Residents of United States territories shall be entitled to participate in
federal elections.

(b) **Federal Elections.** For purposes of this Act, federal elections include:

- (1) presidential elections,
- (2) congressional elections (House and Senate),
- (3) national referendum votes on constitutional amendments.

(c) **Immediate Effect.** Participation rights take effect immediately upon
ratification; they do not depend on Regional assignment or status determination.

### Section 2. Presidential Elections

(a) **National Popular Vote.** If the national popular vote determines
presidential elections (pursuant to Article VII), territorial residents vote
as part of the national electorate.

(b) **Electoral College.** If the Electoral College remains operative during
transition:

- (1) territories shall be assigned electoral votes based on population using
    the same formula applied to States,
- (2) territories with population below the minimum for one Representative
    shall receive one electoral vote.

(c) **Voting Procedures.** Territorial governments shall establish election
administration procedures consistent with federal election law.

### Section 3. Congressional Elections

(a) **House Representation.** Each territory shall elect at least one
Representative to the House apportioned by population using the same formula
applied to States.

(b) **Senate Representation.** Per Article XX, Section 2(b), until Regional assignment:

- (1) each territory shall elect two Senators,
- (2) territorial Senators shall have full voting rights,
- (3) territorial Senators serve as at-large members of the Senate, not assigned to any Regional delegation.

(c) **Post-Assignment.** Per Article XX, Section 2(b)(4), upon Regional assignment,
territorial Senators join the assigned Region's delegation for purposes of Senate
organization, while continuing to be elected by territorial residents.

---

## Part II: Regional Assignment

### Section 11. Assignment Criteria

(a) Congress shall assign each territory to a Region based on:

- (1) **Geographic Proximity.** Physical location relative to Regional boundaries.
- (2) **Historical Connection.** Historical, cultural, or linguistic ties to
    States within specific Regions.
- (3) **Economic Integration.** Trade flows, transportation links, and economic
    relationships.

(b) **No Arbitrary Assignment.** No territory may be assigned to a Region with
which it shares no geographic proximity, historical connection, or economic
integration.

(c) **Territorial Preferences.** Congress shall consider territorial preferences
as expressed through referendum or territorial legislature resolution.

### Section 12. Assignment Approval Requirements

(a) **Receiving Region Approval.** Regional assignment requires approval by a
two-thirds vote of the receiving Region's legislature.

(b) **Territorial Referendum.** The territory's residents shall have the
opportunity to approve or reject Regional assignment by majority referendum.

(c) **Sequence.** The receiving Region's vote shall occur before the territorial
referendum.

(d) **Rejection Effect.** Rejection by either the receiving Region or the
territory:

- (1) does not prevent federal election participation (which continues
    regardless),
- (2) delays Regional governance integration until a subsequent assignment
    is approved,
- (3) allows Congress to propose alternative Regional assignments.

### Section 13. Election Proximity Restrictions

(a) No territory assignment may be enacted, amended, or take effect within
one year before a federal presidential election.

(b) No territory assignment may take effect within six months after a federal
presidential election.

(c) **Rationale.** These restrictions prevent manipulation of Regional
composition to influence elections and prevent retaliation based on election
results.

### Section 14. Effects of Regional Assignment

(a) Upon Regional assignment:

- (1) the territory becomes subject to Regional governance for matters within
    Regional authority,
- (2) territorial residents vote with the assigned Region in presidential
    elections (if Electoral College applies),
- (3) territorial congressional representatives join the Regional delegation,
- (4) the territory becomes eligible for Regional programs and services.

(b) **Continued Federal Status.** Regional assignment does not alter the
territory's federal status unless accompanied by statehood.

---

## Part III: Paths to Defined Status

### Section 21. Congressional Deadline

(a) **Five-Year Requirement.** Congress shall by statute establish a clear path
for each territory within five years of ratification.

(b) **No Indefinite Status.** No territory may be held indefinitely without a
defined governance status.

(c) **Defined Status Options.** Defined governance status includes:

- (1) statehood with Regional assignment,
- (2) Regional assignment without statehood,
- (3) continued territorial status with defined representation rights,
- (4) independence or free association (for territories choosing to exit U.S.
    sovereignty).

### Section 22. Statehood Path

(a) **Petition.** A territory may petition for statehood through:

- (1) territorial legislature resolution approved by two-thirds vote, or
- (2) territorial referendum approved by majority vote.

(b) **Congressional Action.** Congress shall act on statehood petitions within
two years.

(c) **Regional Assignment.** Upon statehood, the new State shall be assigned to
a Region pursuant to Article I, Section 4 and Part II of this Act.

(d) **Admission Process.** Admission follows standard constitutional process
(Article IV, Section 3) with Regional assignment as an additional requirement.

### Section 23. Regional Assignment Without Statehood

(a) **Petition.** A territory may petition for Regional assignment without
statehood through:

- (1) territorial legislature resolution, or
- (2) territorial referendum.

(b) **Retained Status.** Under this option:

- (1) the territory retains its federal territorial status,
- (2) the territory becomes subject to Regional governance for matters within
    Regional authority,
- (3) the territory retains congressional representation as established in
    Part I,
- (4) the territory remains eligible for federal programs applicable to
    territories.

(c) **Future Options.** Regional assignment without statehood does not preclude
future statehood petition.

### Section 24. Continued Territorial Status

(a) **Election.** A territory may elect to continue territorial status with
defined representation rights through:

- (1) territorial legislature resolution, or
- (2) territorial referendum.

(b) **Defined Rights.** Continued territorial status includes:

- (1) federal election participation (Part I),
- (2) congressional representation,
- (3) access to federal programs,
- (4) local self-governance under territorial organic act.

(c) **No Regional Integration.** Under this option, the territory is not subject
to Regional governance.

(d) **Review.** Territories choosing continued territorial status shall have
opportunity to revisit status every twenty years coinciding with census cycles.

### Section 25. Independence or Free Association

(a) **Availability.** Territories may petition for independence or free
association.

(b) **Process.** Independence or free association requires:

- (1) territorial referendum with majority approval,
- (2) Congressional authorization,
- (3) negotiated transition agreement.

(c) **Transition.** Congress shall provide reasonable transition support for
territories choosing independence.

---

## Part IV: Congressional Action Requirements

### Section 31. Response to Petitions

(a) **Two-Year Deadline.** Congress shall act on any territorial petition
within two years of submission.

(b) **Forms of Action.** Congressional action may include:

- (1) approval of the petition,
- (2) approval with modifications negotiated with the territory,
- (3) denial with written explanation and alternative offer.

(c) **Deemed Approval.** If Congress fails to act within two years, certain
petitions are deemed approved:

- (1) petitions for continued territorial status with defined representation
    are deemed approved,
- (2) petitions for Regional assignment (with receiving Region approval) are
    deemed approved.

(d) **Statehood Exception.** Statehood petitions require affirmative
Congressional action and are not subject to deemed approval.

### Section 32. Five-Year Deadline Enforcement

(a) **Status Determination.** If Congress has not established a clear path for
a territory within five years:

- (1) the territory may hold a self-determination referendum presenting all
    status options,
- (2) the winning option becomes the territory's formal petition,
- (3) Congress shall act on the petition within one year.

(b) **Continued Failure.** If Congress fails to act on the self-determination
petition within one year:

- (1) continued territorial status with defined representation is deemed
    established,
- (2) the territory retains right to petition for alternative status.

### Section 33. Judicial Review

(a) Territories may seek judicial review of:

- (1) Congressional failure to meet deadlines,
- (2) arbitrary denial of petitions,
- (3) violations of territorial self-determination rights.

(b) **Forum.** Actions shall be filed in the United States District Court for
the District of Columbia or the relevant territorial court.

(c) **Remedies.** Courts may order:

- (1) Congress to act within specified time,
- (2) implementation of deemed approval provisions,
- (3) declaration of territorial rights.

### Section 41. Existing Territorial Status

(a) Upon ratification, existing territories retain their current status until
changed pursuant to this Act.

(b) **Immediate Rights.** Federal election participation rights take effect
immediately.

(c) **Gradual Integration.** Regional integration proceeds as Regional
assignments are completed.

### Section 42. Territory-Specific Provisions

(a) **Puerto Rico.** Given Puerto Rico's size and existing institutional
capacity:

- (1) status referendum shall be held within two years of ratification,
- (2) all status options (statehood, Regional assignment, continued status,
    independence) shall be presented,
- (3) Congressional action shall be expedited.

(b) **Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands.**
Each territory shall have opportunity for self-determination within the
five-year deadline.

(c) **Minor Outlying Islands.** Islands with minimal permanent population may
be administered under continued territorial status without separate
representation.

- (2) facilitate election administration,
- (3) assist with Regional assignment processes.

(b) **Transition Support.** Federal agencies shall provide technical and

---

## Part VI: Intergovernmental Council Representation

### Section 51. Representation on Federal-Regional Councils

(a) The elected chief executive of each territory (e.g., Governor), or a designee, shall be granted non-voting, ex officio membership on any federal-regional council established by federal law whose policy domain directly and substantially affects that territory.

---

## Part VII: Integration Incentives Implementation

*This Part implements Article XX, Section 4 of the Regional Federal Constitution (the "Bridge and Cliff" mechanism).*

### Section 61. Integration Bonus Administration

(a) **Bonus Seat Activation.** Upon certification of Regional assignment by the
Independent Boundary Review Commission:

- (1) the receiving Region's Senate delegation shall increase by one seat;
- (2) the bonus seat election shall be conducted within 180 days of assignment;
- (3) the bonus seat term shall be six years, staggered with existing Regional
    Senators.

(b) **Election Administration.** The bonus seat shall be elected:

- (1) exclusively by residents of the integrated Territory;
- (2) using ranked-choice voting;
- (3) administered by the Territory's election authority under federal oversight.

(c) **Bonus Period Tracking.** The Independent Boundary Review Commission shall:

- (1) maintain public records of bonus seat activation dates;
- (2) provide two-year, one-year, and 90-day advance notice before bonus
    expiration;
- (3) certify bonus expiration and transition to standard Regional elections.

### Section 62. Post-Bonus Representation Guarantee

(a) **Population Determination.** The most recent decennial census and House
apportionment shall determine whether a Territory qualifies for the post-bonus
representation guarantee. A Territory qualifies if its population equals or
exceeds twice the national population per House seat.

(b) **Guaranteed Seat Election.** For qualifying Territories:

- (1) one of the Region's three standard Senate seats shall be designated for
    Territory-exclusive election;
- (2) the designation shall rotate among the three seats according to the
    Region's Senate election schedule;
- (3) the designation continues until population falls below the national
    population per House seat for two consecutive censuses.

(c) **Non-Qualifying Territories.** Territories below the population threshold
participate in Region-wide Senate elections without a guaranteed seat.

(d) **Reference Calculation.** For purposes of this Section, "national population
per House seat" means the total United States population divided by the number
of House seats (435), as determined by the most recent decennial census and
apportionment.

### Section 63. Integration Timeline Implementation

(a) **Five-Year Window.** For five years following ratification:

- (1) territorial Senators have full voting rights;
- (2) territorial Representatives have full voting rights;
- (3) no fiscal consequences for non-assignment apply.

(b) **Delegate Status Transition.** If a Territory remains unassigned after
year five:

- (1) the Presiding Officer of the Senate shall certify delegate status within
    30 days;
- (2) territorial Senators retain floor privileges, committee membership, and
    bill introduction rights;
- (3) territorial Senators may not vote on final passage of legislation or
    nominations;
- (4) House representation is unaffected and retains full voting rights.

(c) **Fiscal Consequences.** Unassigned Territories after year five:

- (1) remain eligible for existing federal programs;
- (2) are ineligible for new Regional infrastructure grants established after
    ratification;
- (3) have baseline federal transfers frozen at year-five levels, adjusted
    annually for CPI inflation.

(d) **Restoration.** Upon Regional assignment certification:

- (1) full Senate voting rights are restored immediately;
- (2) Regional program eligibility begins immediately;
- (3) the Integration Bonus provisions of Section 61 activate.

### Section 64. Orphan Safeguard Procedures

(a) **Rejection Review Petition.** A Territory rejected by a receiving Region
may petition the Independent Boundary Review Commission within 90 days.

(b) **Commission Review.** The Commission shall:

- (1) complete review within 180 days;
- (2) hold public hearings in the Territory and the rejecting Region;
- (3) receive submissions from both parties and interested stakeholders.

(c) **Fiscal Discrimination Standard.** The Commission may find Fiscal
Discrimination if:

- (1) financial concerns (debt, fiscal condition, anticipated costs) were a
    substantial factor in the rejection; AND
- (2) no legitimate geographic, cultural, or administrative basis exists for
    rejection; OR
- (3) multiple Regions have rejected the Territory on fiscal grounds.

(d) **Ordered Assignment.** Upon finding Fiscal Discrimination:

- (1) the Commission shall identify the most appropriate Region based on
    geographic proximity, cultural ties, and economic integration;
- (2) the Commission shall issue an assignment order within 30 days of the
    finding;
- (3) the order is subject to Supreme Court appeal within 60 days.

(e) **Federal Debt Assumption.** In ordered assignments:

- (1) the Treasury Department shall calculate the Territory's outstanding public
    debt as of ratification date;
- (2) the debt shall be assumed by the Federal Government within one year of
    assignment;
- (3) post-ratification debt is not assumed and transfers with the Territory.

(f) **Anti-Gaming Enforcement.** The Commission may reduce or deny debt
assumption if:

- (1) the Territory incurred substantial new debt after ratification in
    anticipation of federal assumption;
- (2) the Territory engaged in deliberate fiscal mismanagement; or
- (3) audit reveals debt was structured to exploit the assumption provision.

### Section 65. Good Faith Integration Monitoring

(a) **Commission Oversight.** The Independent Boundary Review Commission shall
monitor integration for 15 years following each assignment.

(b) **Bad Faith Indicators.** The Commission may find bad faith integration if:

- (1) the Territory is denied proportional committee representation in Regional
    legislature;
- (2) the Territory is excluded from fiscal equalization formulas;
- (3) Regional elections are structured to dilute Territory resident voting
    power;
- (4) the Territory is systematically excluded from Regional governance
    decisions.

(c) **Remedy.** Upon finding bad faith integration:

- (1) the bonus seat period is extended until good faith integration is
    certified;
- (2) the Territory may petition for transfer to a different Region under
    expedited review;
- (3) the Commission may order specific remedial measures.

---

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Indefinite Congressional Delay

**Attack:** Congress delays action on territorial petitions indefinitely,
leaving territories in limbo.

**Countermeasure:**

- Five-year deadline (Section 21)
- Two-year petition response deadline (Section 31)
- Deemed approval for certain petitions (Section 31(c))
- Self-determination referendum if Congress fails (Section 32)
- Judicial review available (Section 33)

**Outcome:** Multiple deadlines and deemed approval provisions prevent
indefinite delay; judicial enforcement available.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Partisan Regional Assignment

**Attack:** Congress assigns territories to Regions to maximize partisan
advantage rather than functional criteria.

**Countermeasure:**

- Assignment criteria based on geography, history, economy (Section 11)
- No arbitrary assignment prohibition (Section 11(b))
- Receiving Region two-thirds approval required (Section 12(a))
- Territorial referendum required (Section 12(b))
- Election proximity restrictions (Section 13)

**Outcome:** Partisan assignment requires territorial consent and receiving
Region supermajority; election timing restrictions prevent manipulation.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Forced Status Choice

**Attack:** Congress pressures territories into accepting unfavorable status
options by threatening funding cuts or other punitive measures.

**Countermeasure:**

- Multiple status options available (Section 21(c))
- Territorial self-determination (referendum or legislature)
- No exclusion of options based on Congressional preference
- Judicial review of arbitrary denial (Section 33)
- Continued territorial status always available (Section 24)

**Outcome:** Territories retain genuine choice; coercion is subject to
judicial review; continued status option provides fallback.

---

### Attack Vector 4: Receiving Region Rejection

**Attack:** All potential receiving Regions reject a territory's Regional
assignment to keep it in limbo.

**Countermeasure:**

- Orphan Safeguard provisions (Sections 64-65)
- Fiscal Discrimination review by Commission
- Ordered assignment power for Commission
- Federal debt assumption removes fiscal objection
- Integration Timeline creates urgency for territory to seek assignment

**Outcome:** Regions cannot collude to reject territories on fiscal grounds;
ordered assignment with debt assumption provides path forward.

---

### Attack Vector 5: Minor Territory Neglect

**Attack:** Congress ignores smaller territories while addressing larger ones,
leaving them without defined status.

**Countermeasure:**

- Five-year deadline applies to all territories (Section 21)
- Self-determination referendum available to all (Section 32)
- Judicial review available (Section 33)
- Continued status with representation as default (Section 32(b))

**Outcome:** Same protections apply regardless of territory size; default
status ensures representation.

---

### Attack Vector 6: Permanent At-Large Status Gaming

**Attack:** Territory deliberately remains unassigned to retain dedicated
at-large Senators rather than being diluted in a Region.

**Countermeasure:**

- Five-year voting rights cliff (Section 63(b))
- Fiscal consequences after year five (Section 63(c))
- Integration Bonus makes joining attractive (Section 61)
- Post-bonus representation guarantee for large territories (Section 62)

**Outcome:** Remaining unassigned becomes strictly worse than joining after
year five; territories have positive incentive to integrate.

---

### Attack Vector 7: Region Takes Territory, Then Marginalizes

**Attack:** Region accepts territory for the bonus seat, then systematically
excludes territory from Regional governance.

**Countermeasure:**

- Good Faith Integration monitoring (Section 65)
- Bonus seat extension until good faith certified
- Transfer petition option for mistreated territories
- Commission authority to order remedial measures

**Outcome:** Bad faith integration extends the bonus period and risks losing
the territory entirely; Regions have incentive for genuine integration.

---

### Attack Vector 8: Territory Runs Up Debt Before Integration

**Attack:** Territory incurs massive debt after ratification, expecting federal
assumption upon ordered assignment.

**Countermeasure:**

- Debt assumption capped at ratification-date levels (Section 64(e))
- Post-ratification debt excluded from assumption
- Anti-gaming audit authority (Section 64(f))
- Commission may reduce assumption for deliberate mismanagement

**Outcome:** Only pre-ratification debt is assumed; post-ratification fiscal
irresponsibility remains the Territory's responsibility.

---

### Attack Vector 9: Bonus Seat Manipulation

**Attack:** Territory joins Region, gets bonus seat, then attempts to transfer
to different Region for another bonus period.

**Countermeasure:**

- Non-transferable bonus (Article XX, Section 4(f))
- One bonus per Territory, ever
- Transfer does not reset the 15-year clock

**Outcome:** Serial bonus-shopping is explicitly prohibited; territories get
one bonus regardless of subsequent movements.

---

### Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| Multiple receiving Region rejections | Low | Orphan Safeguard with ordered assignment |
| Territorial politics internal disputes | Low | Multiple petition mechanisms (legislature or referendum) |
| Transition funding shortfalls | Medium | Federal agency coordination; Congressional appropriations |
| Statehood requires affirmative action | Medium | Expedited process; judicial review of arbitrary denial |
| Temporary Senate asymmetry during bonus period | Low | 15-year limit; expiration built into constitutional text |
| Large territory debt assumption costs | Medium | Capped at ratification levels; general federal revenues |
| Small territories diluted post-bonus | Low | Accepted tradeoff; alternative is permanent asymmetry |
