# Territories Status Determination Act

This proposal establishes the statutory framework for the constitutional
territories provisions (Article XX, Section 2), providing detailed procedures
for territory participation in federal elections, Regional assignment, and
paths to defined governance status.

---

## Constitutional Foundation

Article XX, Section 2 of the Regional Federal Constitution establishes that:

> Residents of United States territories shall participate in federal elections.
> Territories shall be assigned to Regions with territorial consent. Congress
> shall provide paths for territories to petition for statehood, Regional
> assignment, or continued territorial status with defined representation.

This Act implements these principles through specific procedures.

---

## Purpose

Establish territory status procedures that:

- ensure territorial residents can participate in federal elections,
- provide fair processes for Regional assignment,
- establish clear paths to defined governance status,
- prevent indefinite territorial limbo,
- protect territorial self-determination.

---

## Part I: Federal Election Participation

### Section 1. Right to Participate

(a) Residents of United States territories shall be entitled to participate in
federal elections.

(b) **Federal Elections.** For purposes of this Act, federal elections include:

- (1) presidential elections,
- (2) congressional elections (House and Senate),
- (3) national referendum votes on constitutional amendments.

(c) **Immediate Effect.** Participation rights take effect immediately upon
ratification; they do not depend on Regional assignment or status determination.

### Section 2. Presidential Elections

(a) **National Popular Vote.** If the national popular vote determines
presidential elections (pursuant to Article VII), territorial residents vote
as part of the national electorate.

(b) **Electoral College.** If the Electoral College remains operative during
transition:

- (1) territories shall be assigned electoral votes based on population using
    the same formula applied to States,
- (2) territories with population below the minimum for one Representative
    shall receive one electoral vote.

(c) **Voting Procedures.** Territorial governments shall establish election
administration procedures consistent with federal election law.

### Section 3. Congressional Elections

(a) **House Representation.** Each territory shall elect at least one
Representative to the House apportioned by population using the same formula
applied to States.

(b) **Senate Representation.** Per Article XX, Section 2(b), until Regional assignment:

- (1) each territory shall elect two Senators,
- (2) territorial Senators shall have full voting rights,
- (3) territorial Senators serve as at-large members of the Senate, not assigned to any Regional delegation.

(c) **Post-Assignment.** Per Article XX, Section 2(b)(4), upon Regional assignment,
territorial Senators join the assigned Region's delegation for purposes of Senate
organization, while continuing to be elected by territorial residents.

---

## Part II: Regional Assignment

### Section 11. Assignment Criteria

(a) Congress shall assign each territory to a Region based on:

- (1) **Geographic Proximity.** Physical location relative to Regional boundaries.
- (2) **Historical Connection.** Historical, cultural, or linguistic ties to
    States within specific Regions.
- (3) **Economic Integration.** Trade flows, transportation links, and economic
    relationships.

(b) **No Arbitrary Assignment.** No territory may be assigned to a Region with
which it shares no geographic proximity, historical connection, or economic
integration.

(c) **Territorial Preferences.** Congress shall consider territorial preferences
as expressed through referendum or territorial legislature resolution.

### Section 12. Assignment Approval Requirements

(a) **Receiving Region Approval.** Regional assignment requires approval by a
two-thirds vote of the receiving Region's legislature.

(b) **Territorial Referendum.** The territory's residents shall have the
opportunity to approve or reject Regional assignment by majority referendum.

(c) **Sequence.** The receiving Region's vote shall occur before the territorial
referendum.

(d) **Rejection Effect.** Rejection by either the receiving Region or the
territory:

- (1) does not prevent federal election participation (which continues
    regardless),
- (2) delays Regional governance integration until a subsequent assignment
    is approved,
- (3) allows Congress to propose alternative Regional assignments.

### Section 13. Election Proximity Restrictions

(a) No territory assignment may be enacted, amended, or take effect within
one year before a federal presidential election.

(b) No territory assignment may take effect within six months after a federal
presidential election.

(c) **Rationale.** These restrictions prevent manipulation of Regional
composition to influence elections and prevent retaliation based on election
results.

### Section 14. Effects of Regional Assignment

(a) Upon Regional assignment:

- (1) the territory becomes subject to Regional governance for matters within
    Regional authority,
- (2) territorial residents vote with the assigned Region in presidential
    elections (if Electoral College applies),
- (3) territorial congressional representatives join the Regional delegation,
- (4) the territory becomes eligible for Regional programs and services.

(b) **Continued Federal Status.** Regional assignment does not alter the
territory's federal status unless accompanied by statehood.

---

## Part III: Paths to Defined Status

### Section 21. Congressional Deadline

(a) **Five-Year Requirement.** Congress shall by statute establish a clear path
for each territory within five years of ratification.

(b) **No Indefinite Status.** No territory may be held indefinitely without a
defined governance status.

(c) **Defined Status Options.** Defined governance status includes:

- (1) statehood with Regional assignment,
- (2) Regional assignment without statehood,
- (3) continued territorial status with defined representation rights,
- (4) independence or free association (for territories choosing to exit U.S.
    sovereignty).

### Section 22. Statehood Path

(a) **Petition.** A territory may petition for statehood through:

- (1) territorial legislature resolution approved by two-thirds vote, or
- (2) territorial referendum approved by majority vote.

(b) **Congressional Action.** Congress shall act on statehood petitions within
two years.

(c) **Regional Assignment.** Upon statehood, the new State shall be assigned to
a Region pursuant to Article I, Section 4 and Part II of this Act.

(d) **Admission Process.** Admission follows standard constitutional process
(Article IV, Section 3) with Regional assignment as an additional requirement.

### Section 23. Regional Assignment Without Statehood

(a) **Petition.** A territory may petition for Regional assignment without
statehood through:

- (1) territorial legislature resolution, or
- (2) territorial referendum.

(b) **Retained Status.** Under this option:

- (1) the territory retains its federal territorial status,
- (2) the territory becomes subject to Regional governance for matters within
    Regional authority,
- (3) the territory retains congressional representation as established in
    Part I,
- (4) the territory remains eligible for federal programs applicable to
    territories.

(c) **Future Options.** Regional assignment without statehood does not preclude
future statehood petition.

### Section 24. Continued Territorial Status

(a) **Election.** A territory may elect to continue territorial status with
defined representation rights through:

- (1) territorial legislature resolution, or
- (2) territorial referendum.

(b) **Defined Rights.** Continued territorial status includes:

- (1) federal election participation (Part I),
- (2) congressional representation,
- (3) access to federal programs,
- (4) local self-governance under territorial organic act.

(c) **No Regional Integration.** Under this option, the territory is not subject
to Regional governance.

(d) **Review.** Territories choosing continued territorial status shall have
opportunity to revisit status every twenty years coinciding with census cycles.

### Section 25. Independence or Free Association

(a) **Availability.** Territories may petition for independence or free
association.

(b) **Process.** Independence or free association requires:

- (1) territorial referendum with majority approval,
- (2) Congressional authorization,
- (3) negotiated transition agreement.

(c) **Transition.** Congress shall provide reasonable transition support for
territories choosing independence.

---

## Part IV: Congressional Action Requirements

### Section 31. Response to Petitions

(a) **Two-Year Deadline.** Congress shall act on any territorial petition
within two years of submission.

(b) **Forms of Action.** Congressional action may include:

- (1) approval of the petition,
- (2) approval with modifications negotiated with the territory,
- (3) denial with written explanation and alternative offer.

(c) **Deemed Approval.** If Congress fails to act within two years, certain
petitions are deemed approved:

- (1) petitions for continued territorial status with defined representation
    are deemed approved,
- (2) petitions for Regional assignment (with receiving Region approval) are
    deemed approved.

(d) **Statehood Exception.** Statehood petitions require affirmative
Congressional action and are not subject to deemed approval.

### Section 32. Five-Year Deadline Enforcement

(a) **Status Determination.** If Congress has not established a clear path for
a territory within five years:

- (1) the territory may hold a self-determination referendum presenting all
    status options,
- (2) the winning option becomes the territory's formal petition,
- (3) Congress shall act on the petition within one year.

(b) **Continued Failure.** If Congress fails to act on the self-determination
petition within one year:

- (1) continued territorial status with defined representation is deemed
    established,
- (2) the territory retains right to petition for alternative status.

### Section 33. Judicial Review

(a) Territories may seek judicial review of:

- (1) Congressional failure to meet deadlines,
- (2) arbitrary denial of petitions,
- (3) violations of territorial self-determination rights.

(b) **Forum.** Actions shall be filed in the United States District Court for
the District of Columbia or the relevant territorial court.

(c) **Remedies.** Courts may order:

- (1) Congress to act within specified time,
- (2) implementation of deemed approval provisions,
- (3) declaration of territorial rights.

## Part V: Transition Provisions

### Section 41. Existing Territorial Status

(a) Upon ratification, existing territories retain their current status until
changed pursuant to this Act.

(b) **Immediate Rights.** Federal election participation rights take effect
immediately.

(c) **Gradual Integration.** Regional integration proceeds as Regional
assignments are completed.

### Section 42. Territory-Specific Provisions

(a) **Puerto Rico.** Given Puerto Rico's size and existing institutional
capacity:

- (1) status referendum shall be held within two years of ratification,
- (2) all status options (statehood, Regional assignment, continued status,
    independence) shall be presented,
- (3) Congressional action shall be expedited.

(b) **Guam, U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Northern Mariana Islands.**
Each territory shall have opportunity for self-determination within the
five-year deadline.

(c) **Minor Outlying Islands.** Islands with minimal permanent population may
be administered under continued territorial status without separate
representation.

- (3) assist with Regional assignment processes.

(b) **Transition Support.** Federal agencies shall provide technical and
financial support for territorial governance transitions.

---

## Part VI: Intergovernmental Council Representation

### Section 51. Representation on Federal-Regional Councils

(a) The elected chief executive of each territory (e.g., Governor), or a designee, shall be granted non-voting, ex officio membership on any federal-regional council established by federal law whose policy domain directly and substantially affects that territory.



---

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Indefinite Congressional Delay

**Attack:** Congress delays action on territorial petitions indefinitely,
leaving territories in limbo.

**Countermeasure:**

- Five-year deadline (Section 21)
- Two-year petition response deadline (Section 31)
- Deemed approval for certain petitions (Section 31(c))
- Self-determination referendum if Congress fails (Section 32)
- Judicial review available (Section 33)

**Outcome:** Multiple deadlines and deemed approval provisions prevent
indefinite delay; judicial enforcement available.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Partisan Regional Assignment

**Attack:** Congress assigns territories to Regions to maximize partisan
advantage rather than functional criteria.

**Countermeasure:**

- Assignment criteria based on geography, history, economy (Section 11)
- No arbitrary assignment prohibition (Section 11(b))
- Receiving Region two-thirds approval required (Section 12(a))
- Territorial referendum required (Section 12(b))
- Election proximity restrictions (Section 13)

**Outcome:** Partisan assignment requires territorial consent and receiving
Region supermajority; election timing restrictions prevent manipulation.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Forced Status Choice

**Attack:** Congress pressures territories into accepting unfavorable status
options by threatening funding cuts or other punitive measures.

**Countermeasure:**

- Multiple status options available (Section 21(c))
- Territorial self-determination (referendum or legislature)
- No exclusion of options based on Congressional preference
- Judicial review of arbitrary denial (Section 33)
- Continued territorial status always available (Section 24)

**Outcome:** Territories retain genuine choice; coercion is subject to
judicial review; continued status option provides fallback.

---

### Attack Vector 4: Receiving Region Rejection

**Attack:** All potential receiving Regions reject a territory's Regional
assignment to keep it in limbo.

**Countermeasure:**

- Continued territorial status with representation (Section 24)
- Federal election participation regardless of assignment (Section 1)
- Congressional authority to establish representation without Regional
    integration
- Multiple potential receiving Regions for most territories

**Outcome:** Regional rejection does not eliminate representation rights;
continued territorial status provides defined governance.

---

### Attack Vector 5: Minor Territory Neglect

**Attack:** Congress ignores smaller territories while addressing larger ones,
leaving them without defined status.

**Countermeasure:**

- Five-year deadline applies to all territories (Section 21)
- Self-determination referendum available to all (Section 32)
- Judicial review available (Section 33)
- Continued status with representation as default (Section 32(b))

**Outcome:** Same protections apply regardless of territory size; default
status ensures representation.

---

### Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| Multiple receiving Region rejections | Low | Continued status option; Congressional alternatives |
| Territorial politics internal disputes | Low | Multiple petition mechanisms (legislature or referendum) |
| Transition funding shortfalls | Medium | Federal agency coordination; Congressional appropriations |
| Statehood requires affirmative action | Medium | Expedited process; judicial review of arbitrary denial |
