# Federal Jurisdictions and Overseas Citizens Act

This proposal clarifies the voting rights and representation of U.S. citizens residing outside the formal boundaries of a Region, and establishes clear coordination protocols for federal enclaves within the new federal structure.

---

## Purpose

Establish a Federal Jurisdictions and Overseas Citizens Act that:

- Ensures the voting rights of U.S. citizens residing overseas or in federal enclaves.
- Clarifies the representation of these citizens in federal elections.
- Establishes clear coordination protocols between federal enclaves and host Regional/local governments.
- Defines the application of Regional law on federal enclaves.

---

## Part I: Overseas and Federal Enclave Voting Rights

### Section 1. Overseas Citizens Voting Rights

(a) **Federal Elections.** U.S. citizens residing overseas shall retain the right to vote in all federal elections (President, Senate, House of Representatives).

(b) **Last Region of Domicile.** For the purposes of federal elections, an overseas citizen shall be considered a resident of the last Region in which they maintained a domicile, as defined by the `Inter-Regional Taxation and Fiscal Coordination Act`.

(c) **Absentee Voting.** The principles of the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA) are hereby reaffirmed and adapted to the Regional Federalism model, ensuring that overseas citizens can register and cast absentee ballots for federal elections through their last Region of domicile.

### Section 2. Federal Enclave Residents

(a) **Definition.** A "federal enclave" is any area of land or water over which the federal government exercises exclusive or concurrent jurisdiction, including military installations, federal reservations, and national parks.

(b) **Voting Rights.** U.S. citizens residing on federal enclaves within the geographic boundaries of a Region shall be considered residents of that host Region for the purposes of federal elections and representation.

(c) **Regional and Local Elections.** Residents of federal enclaves shall be eligible to vote in Regional and local elections of the host Region, provided they meet all other eligibility requirements of that Region.

## Part II: Federal Enclave Coordination

### Section 11. Jurisdictional Inventory and Transparency

(a) The General Services Administration (GSA) shall establish and maintain a public, online inventory of all federal enclaves within the United States.

(b) For each enclave, the inventory shall specify its jurisdictional status (exclusive, concurrent, or proprietary) and the legal basis for that status.

### Section 12. Law Enforcement Coordination

(a) All federal enclaves with their own law enforcement agencies (e.g., military police, federal park rangers) shall enter into Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with the host Regional and local law enforcement agencies.

(b) MOUs shall define:
    - (1) Mutual aid agreements for emergency response.
    - (2) Protocols for hot pursuit across jurisdictional lines.
    - (3) Primary response responsibilities for incidents occurring on or near enclave boundaries.
    - (4) Information sharing protocols, consistent with the `Federal-Regional Intelligence Sharing and Oversight Act`.

### Section 13. Application of Regional Law

(a) Regional health, safety, and environmental regulations shall apply on federal enclaves unless they are:
    - (1) In direct conflict with a specific, documented federal statute or regulation.
    - (2) Found by the Allocation Review Board (ARB) to create an unreasonable burden on the federal mission of the enclave.

(b) The federal government shall consult with host Regional authorities before establishing or modifying federal regulations that would preempt Regional law on an enclave.

---

## Part III: Oversight and Dispute Resolution

### Section 21. Federal Enclave Coordination Council

(a) There is established a "Federal Enclave Coordination Council" (the "Council").

(b) **Composition.** The Council shall be composed of:
    - (1) The Administrator of the GSA (Chair).
    - (2) Representatives from relevant federal agencies (e.g., DoD, Interior, Justice).
    - (3) One representative from each host Regional government, appointed by the Regional Governor.
    - (4) One representative from a national association of local governments.

(c) **Functions.** The Council shall:
    - (1) Facilitate coordination and resolve disputes between federal enclaves and host Regional/local governments.
    - (2) Develop best practices for intergovernmental cooperation on enclaves.
    - (3) Advise on the application of Regional law on federal enclaves.

### Section 22. ARB Jurisdiction

(a) The Allocation Review Board (ARB) shall have jurisdiction to mediate and adjudicate disputes between federal agencies and Regional/local governments regarding the application of Regional law on federal enclaves (Section 13).

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Disenfranchisement of Overseas Citizens

**Attack:** A Region attempts to make it difficult for overseas citizens to vote, citing administrative burden or lack of current residency.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Federal Mandate (Section 1(a)):** The Act explicitly reaffirms the right to vote in federal elections.
- **Last Region of Domicile (Section 1(b)):** Provides a clear, consistent rule for assigning voting jurisdiction.
- **UOCAVA Adaptation (Section 1(c)):** Ensures the administrative mechanisms are in place.
- **Federal Oversight:** The Independent Election Commission (IEC) would oversee compliance with federal voting rights.

**Outcome:** Regions are legally obligated to facilitate voting for overseas citizens from their last domicile, with federal oversight ensuring compliance.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Federal Enclave as "Sovereign Island"

**Attack:** A federal enclave asserts complete autonomy, refusing to cooperate with host Regional law enforcement or claiming exemption from all Regional health and safety regulations.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Mandatory MOUs (Section 12(a)):** Requires formal agreements for law enforcement coordination.
- **Application of Regional Law (Section 13(a)):** Regional regulations apply unless specifically preempted by federal law or mission-critical.
- **ARB Dispute Resolution (Section 22):** Provides a neutral arbiter for disputes over the application of Regional law.
- **Council Oversight (Section 21):** The Federal Enclave Coordination Council facilitates cooperation.

**Outcome:** Federal enclaves cannot operate as completely isolated entities; they are required to coordinate with host Regions and are generally subject to Regional law unless a clear federal conflict exists.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Regional Overreach onto Enclaves

**Attack:** A host Region attempts to impose burdensome regulations or taxes on a federal enclave, interfering with its federal mission.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Federal Mission Preemption (Section 13(a)(2)):** Regional law is preempted if it creates an unreasonable burden on the federal mission.
- **ARB Dispute Resolution (Section 22):** The ARB can adjudicate claims of unreasonable burden.
- **Federal Supremacy:** The federal government retains ultimate authority over its property and operations.

**Outcome:** While Regional law generally applies, the federal mission is protected from undue Regional interference, with the ARB serving as a neutral arbiter.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Defining "unreasonable burden" on federal mission** | Medium | ARB rulemaking with public comment; judicial precedent will refine over time. |
| **Funding for UOCAVA implementation by Regions** | Medium | Federal funding for election administration (e.g., through the IEC) should include specific allocations for overseas voting. |
| **Complexity of tracking domicile for overseas citizens** | Low | Existing UOCAVA mechanisms and federal tax residency rules provide a basis. |
| **Political pressure to close or relocate federal enclaves** | High | This Act clarifies jurisdictional issues but does not prevent political decisions regarding federal property. |
