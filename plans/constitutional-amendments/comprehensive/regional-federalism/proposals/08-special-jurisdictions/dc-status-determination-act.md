# District of Columbia Status Determination Act

This proposal establishes the statutory framework for the constitutional D.C.
provisions (Article XX, Section 1), providing detailed procedures for D.C.
representation, status determination, and Regional assignment.

---

## Constitutional Foundation

Article XX, Section 1 of the Regional Federal Constitution establishes that:

> The District of Columbia shall be entitled to representation in Congress as if
> it were a State. Within five years, Congress shall determine the District's
> status (statehood or Regional assignment). Regional assignment requires approval
> by the receiving Region and by District residents.

This Act implements these principles through specific procedures.

---

## Purpose

Establish D.C. status determination procedures that:

- ensure immediate Congressional representation for District residents,
- provide a clear timeline for status determination,
- establish fair procedures for Regional assignment,
- protect against partisan manipulation of assignment timing,
- maintain District governance during the determination period.

---

## Part I: Congressional Representation

### Section 1. Immediate Representation

(a) **Effective Date.** The District of Columbia's right to Congressional
representation takes effect immediately upon ratification and does not depend
on Regional assignment or status determination.

(b) **House Representation.** The District shall be entitled to one or more
Representatives apportioned by population according to the same formula
applied to States.

(c) **Senate Representation.** The District shall be entitled to two Senators,
elected by District residents.

(d) **Transitional Status.** Per Article XX, Section 1(b), District Senators
serve as at-large members of the Senate with full voting rights until Regional
assignment is completed. Upon Regional assignment, District Senators join the
assigned Region's delegation for purposes of Senate organization.

### Section 2. Initial Senate Elections

(a) **Timing.** Senate elections shall be scheduled within 180 days of
ratification.

(b) **Interim Procedure.** Until Congress establishes permanent election
procedures, Senators shall be elected by plurality vote in a general election,
with the two candidates receiving the most votes being elected.

(c) **Term Staggering.** The Senator receiving the most votes shall serve a
six-year term; the Senator receiving the second-most votes shall serve a
four-year term. Thereafter, all terms shall be six years.

(d) **Permanent Procedures.** Congress may by statute establish alternative
election procedures for District Senators, provided such procedures are
substantially similar to those used by States.

### Section 3. Electoral College Transition

(a) **National Popular Vote.** If the national popular vote determines
presidential elections (pursuant to Article VII), District residents vote
as part of the national electorate.

(b) **Electoral College Interim.** If the Electoral College remains operative
during transition, the District retains its existing three electoral votes
until Regional assignment.

(c) **Post-Assignment.** Upon Regional assignment, District residents vote
as part of the assigned Region for presidential elections.

---

## Part II: Status Determination

### Section 11. Congressional Deadline

(a) **Five-Year Requirement.** Within five years of ratification, Congress
shall by statute either:

- (1) admit the District as a State and assign it to a Region, or
- (2) assign the District to a Region for purposes of Regional governance
    while preserving its unique federal district status.

(b) **Extension.** The deadline may be extended by one year upon:

- (1) finding by Congress that additional time is necessary to complete
    required procedures, and
- (2) approval by a majority of District residents in a referendum on
    extension.

(c) **Failure to Act.** If Congress fails to act within five years (or six
years if extended), the District shall hold a self-determination referendum
pursuant to Section 14.

### Section 12. Congressional Determination Options

(a) **Option A: Statehood.** Congress may admit the District as a State
pursuant to Article IV, Section 3 of the Constitution. Upon admission:

- (1) the new State shall be assigned to a Region pursuant to the criteria
    in Section 13,
- (2) the federal district shall be reduced to the core federal enclave
    (Capitol, White House, Supreme Court, and immediate environs),
- (3) the new State assumes responsibility for all non-federal District
    functions.

(b) **Option B: Regional Assignment Without Statehood.** Congress may assign
the District to a Region while preserving its federal district status. Under
this option:

- (1) the District becomes subject to Regional governance for matters within
    Regional authority,
- (2) the District retains its unique status for matters affecting federal
    operations,
- (3) the District retains its Congressional representation as established
    in Part I,
- (4) Congress retains authority over federal enclave matters.

### Section 13. Regional Assignment Criteria

(a) **Permitted Criteria.** Regional assignment shall be based on:

- (1) geographic proximity,
- (2) economic integration (commuting patterns, trade flows),
- (3) shared infrastructure and transit systems,
- (4) historical connections,
- (5) expressed preferences of District residents.

(b) **Prohibited Criteria.** Regional assignment may not be based on:

- (1) partisan political advantage,
- (2) intent to dilute or concentrate voting power,
- (3) punishment of the District for political positions,
- (4) economic considerations unrelated to functional integration.

(c) **Likely Assignments.** Based on geography and economic integration, the
most likely Regional assignments are:

- Northeast Region (geographic proximity to Maryland, Pennsylvania),
- Southeast Region (geographic proximity to Virginia).

### Section 14. Self-Determination Referendum

(a) **Trigger.** If Congress fails to act within the deadline, the District
Board of Elections shall conduct a self-determination referendum within 180
days.

(b) **Ballot Question.** The referendum shall present the following options:

- (1) Statehood and assignment to the Northeast Region,
- (2) Statehood and assignment to the Southeast Region,
- (3) Regional assignment without statehood (Northeast),
- (4) Regional assignment without statehood (Southeast),
- (5) Continued federal district status without Regional assignment.

(c) **Voting Method.** The referendum shall use ranked-choice voting to
determine the District's preferred option.

(d) **Effect.** The winning option becomes the District's formal petition
to Congress. Congress shall act on the petition within one year. If Congress
again fails to act, the petition is deemed approved.

---

## Part III: Regional Assignment Approval

### Section 21. Receiving Region Approval

(a) **Legislative Vote.** Regional assignment requires approval by a two-thirds
vote of the receiving Region's legislature.

(b) **Timing.** The receiving Region's vote shall occur before the District
resident referendum.

(c) **Rejection.** If the receiving Region rejects assignment:

- (1) the District may petition for assignment to an alternative Region,
- (2) Congress may propose alternative arrangements,
- (3) the District retains its interim status until assignment is approved.

### Section 22. District Resident Referendum

(a) **Requirement.** Regional assignment requires approval by a majority of
District residents voting in a referendum.

(b) **Ballot Language.** The referendum shall clearly describe:

- (1) the specific Regional assignment proposed,
- (2) the governance implications of assignment,
- (3) the preservation or modification of District autonomy.

(c) **Rejection.** If District residents reject assignment:

- (1) the District retains its interim status,
- (2) a new assignment proposal may be submitted after one year,
- (3) residents may petition for self-determination referendum.

### Section 23. Election Proximity Restrictions

(a) **Pre-Election Blackout.** No Regional assignment may be enacted, amended,
or take effect within one year before a federal presidential election.

(b) **Post-Election Blackout.** No Regional assignment may take effect within
six months after a federal presidential election.

(c) **Rationale.** These restrictions prevent manipulation of Regional
composition to influence imminent elections or retaliation based on election
results.

(d) **Calculation.** For purposes of this Part:

- (1) "federal presidential election" means the general election held on
    the Tuesday following the first Monday in November of each presidential
    election year,
- (2) the pre-election blackout begins one year before this date,
- (3) the post-election blackout ends six months after this date.

---

## Part IV: Interim Governance

### Section 31. Interim Status

(a) **Duration.** Until Congress makes a determination under Section 11, the
District operates under interim status as defined in this Part.

(b) **Home Rule.** The District retains its home rule authority for local
governance matters.

(c) **Congressional Authority.** Congress retains its existing authority
over District matters, subject to the immediate provisions of Article XX,
Section 1.

### Section 32. Presidential Elections During Interim

(a) **National Popular Vote.** If the national popular vote determines
presidential elections, District residents vote as part of the national
electorate; their votes are counted nationally, not assigned to any Region.

(b) **Electoral College.** If the Electoral College remains operative,
the District retains its three electoral votes as provided by the Twenty-Third
Amendment until Regional assignment.

### Section 33. Congressional Elections During Interim

(a) **Representation.** The District elects its own Representatives and
Senators as provided in Part I.

(b) **Independence.** District Congressional representation is independent
of Regional assignment.

### Section 34. Regional Governance During Interim

(a) **Inapplicability.** The District is not subject to Regional authority
until Congress makes a determination under Section 11.

(b) **No Regional Obligations.** The District has no obligations to any
Region during the interim period.

(c) **No Regional Benefits.** The District is not entitled to Regional
services or equalization transfers during the interim period (except as
Congress may provide by statute).

## Part V: Federal Enclave

### Section 41. Federal District Core

(a) **Definition.** Regardless of status determination, the federal district
core shall consist of:

- (1) the United States Capitol and grounds,
- (2) the White House and grounds,
- (3) the Supreme Court building and grounds,
- (4) the National Mall,
- (5) such additional federal properties as Congress may designate.

(b) **Exclusive Jurisdiction.** Congress retains exclusive jurisdiction
over the federal district core.

(c) **No Residents.** The federal district core shall have no permanent
residents for purposes of representation or voting.

### Section 42. Statehood Boundary

(a) **If Statehood.** If the District is admitted as a State:

- (1) the new State consists of all District territory except the federal
    district core,
- (2) the boundary between the new State and the federal district core
    shall be established by Congress,
- (3) existing residents remain residents of the new State, not the federal
    district core.

(b) **Federal Workforce.** Federal employees working in the federal district
core are residents of their actual place of residence (whether the new State,
Maryland, Virginia, or elsewhere).

---

## Part VI: Intergovernmental Council Representation

### Section 51. Representation on Federal-Regional Councils

(a) Pending a final status determination under this Act, the Mayor of the District of Columbia, or a designee, shall be granted non-voting, ex officio membership on all federal-regional councils established by federal law to ensure the interests of the District's residents are represented in intergovernmental policy coordination.

---

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Indefinite Delay

**Attack:** Congress refuses to act within the five-year deadline, leaving
the District in permanent limbo without Regional integration.

**Countermeasure:**

- Five-year statutory deadline (Section 11(a))
- One-year extension limit with District approval (Section 11(b))
- Self-determination referendum if Congress fails to act (Section 11(c))
- Deemed approval of petition if Congress fails to act on petition (Section 14(d))

**Outcome:** District residents can force determination through self-determination
referendum; indefinite delay is not possible.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Partisan Assignment

**Attack:** Congress assigns the District to a Region to maximize partisan
advantage rather than functional criteria.

**Countermeasure:**

- Permitted criteria limited to geographic/functional factors (Section 13(a))
- Prohibited criteria explicitly ban partisan advantage (Section 13(b))
- Receiving Region must approve by two-thirds vote (Section 21(a))
- District residents must approve by referendum (Section 22(a))

**Outcome:** Partisan assignment requires complicity of receiving Region
legislature (2/3 vote) and District residents (majority referendum); unlikely
to succeed if assignment is blatantly partisan.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Election Timing Manipulation

**Attack:** Assignment is timed to take effect immediately before an election
to advantage one party.

**Countermeasure:**

- One-year pre-election blackout (Section 23(a))
- Six-month post-election blackout (Section 23(b))
- Applies to enactment, amendment, and taking effect

**Outcome:** Assignment cannot be timed to affect imminent elections; minimum
18-month lead time for any assignment to affect presidential elections.

---

### Attack Vector 4: Receiving Region Extortion

**Attack:** A potential receiving Region demands concessions from the District
or from Congress as a condition of accepting assignment.

**Countermeasure:**

- Multiple potential receiving Regions (Northeast, Southeast)
- Self-determination referendum allows District to choose Region
- Continued interim status is viable alternative
- Congress can propose alternative arrangements

**Outcome:** No single Region has monopoly power; District can pursue
alternatives if one Region attempts extortion.

---

### Attack Vector 5: Voter Suppression in Referendum

**Attack:** District government suppresses turnout in assignment referendum
to achieve preferred outcome.

**Countermeasure:**

- Federal oversight of referendum procedures
- No minimum turnout requirement (preventing abstention as veto)
- Standard election integrity provisions apply
- Challenge available in federal court

**Outcome:** Referendum is subject to standard election integrity requirements;
suppression is subject to federal enforcement.

---

### Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| Congressional inaction despite deadline | Medium | Self-determination referendum with deemed approval |
| Both potential Regions reject assignment | Low | Interim status is stable; District retains representation |
| Federal enclave boundary manipulation | Low | Constitutional minimum requirements; judicial review |
| Post-assignment Regional discrimination | Low | Equal protection floors; freedom of movement |
