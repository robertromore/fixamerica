# Federal Judiciary Modernization Act

This proposal establishes the statutory framework for restructuring the lower federal courts to align with the new Regional Federalism framework, ensuring a coherent and effective judicial system.

---

## Constitutional Foundation

This Act is an implementing statute for the new constitutional structure, exercising Congress's power under Article I and Article III of the U.S. Constitution (and its proposed successor articles) to ordain and establish inferior courts. It is a necessary "machinery of government" bill to make the new federal structure functional.

---

## Purpose

Establish a Federal Judiciary Modernization Act that:

- Realigns the federal judicial circuits with the new Regional boundaries.
- Provides a clear and logical structure for federal district courts within each Region.
- Clarifies appellate pathways from both federal and Regional courts to the Federal Supreme Court.
- Ensures a smooth transition for pending cases and judicial personnel.

## Part I: Circuit Court Realignment

### Section 1. Establishment of Regional Circuits

(a) The existing numbered judicial circuits of the United States are hereby abolished, effective on Activation Day as defined in the `Constitutional Transition Act`.

(b) There are hereby established new United States Courts of Appeals, with one circuit corresponding to the geographic boundaries of each of the established Regions. Each shall be named the "United States Court of Appeals for the [Region Name] Circuit."

(c) The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit shall be retained with their existing jurisdiction.

### Section 2. Composition and Judgeships

(a) The number of authorized judgeships for each new Regional Circuit shall be determined by Congress based on population and projected caseload, with an initial allocation provided in this Act.

(b) Incumbent circuit judges serving in an abolished circuit shall have the option to transfer their commission to the new Regional Circuit in which their duty station is located.

---

## Part II: District Court Organization

### Section 11. District Court Boundaries

(a) Each constituent state within a Region shall contain at least one United States District Court.

(b) Regions may, through their Regional Assembly, propose the creation of additional federal districts or the division of existing districts based on population and caseload. Such proposals shall be submitted to Congress for approval.

(c) In the absence of Regional proposals, the existing federal district boundaries within each state shall remain in effect.

### Section 12. District Court Judgeships

(a) The number of authorized district court judgeships shall be determined by Congress.

(b) Incumbent district judges shall continue to serve in the district in which their duty station is located.

---

## Part III: Appellate Pathways

### Section 21. Appeals from Federal District Courts

(a) Final decisions of the United States District Courts shall be appealable to the United States Court of Appeals for the Regional Circuit in which the district court is located.

### Section 22. Appeals from Regional Supreme Courts

(a) Final decisions of a Regional Supreme Court that involve a substantial question of federal law shall be appealable directly to the Federal Supreme Court.

(b) The Federal Supreme Court shall have certiorari jurisdiction to review such cases.

(c) Decisions of a Regional Supreme Court on matters of Regional or state law are final and not subject to review by any federal court.

### Section 23. Appeals from Regional Circuit Courts

(a) Final decisions of the United States Courts of Appeals for the Regional Circuits shall be appealable to the Federal Supreme Court by writ of certiorari.

## Part IV: Transitional Provisions

### Section 31. Transition of Pending Cases

(a) **District Courts.** All cases pending in a United States District Court on Activation Day shall continue in that court.

(b) **Courts of Appeals.** Any case pending before an abolished Court of Appeals on Activation Day shall be transferred to the new Regional Circuit Court that has jurisdiction over the district from which the appeal originated.

(c) **Precedent.** The decisions of an abolished circuit court shall remain persuasive, but not binding, authority within the territory of the former circuit until the new Regional Circuit Court establishes its own body of precedent.

### Section 32. Judicial Personnel Transition

(a) **Circuit Judges.** As provided in Section 2(b), incumbent circuit judges may elect to transfer to the new corresponding Regional Circuit. Any judge who declines transfer may take senior status or retire.

(b) **Staff.** All court staff, including clerks, law clerks, and administrative personnel, shall be transferred to the corresponding new court.

### Section 33. Implementation Timeline

(a) This Act shall take effect on Activation Day, as defined in the `Constitutional Transition Act`.

(b) The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts shall oversee the logistical transition, including the transfer of records, property, and personnel.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Regional Gerrymandering of Federal Districts

**Attack:** A Regional Assembly proposes new federal district boundaries that are gerrymandered to concentrate ideologically aligned judges or to create favorable venues for litigation.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Congressional Approval (Section 11(b)):** Congress must approve any new district boundaries, providing a federal check on Regional proposals.
- **Statutory Criteria:** This Act can be amended to include neutral criteria for district creation, such as population equality, compactness, and respect for existing political subdivisions.
- **Judicial Challenge:** A gerrymandered district plan could be challenged in federal court as an unconstitutional attempt to manipulate the judiciary.

**Outcome:** While a Region can propose changes, the requirement for Congressional approval and the potential for judicial review provide strong checks against partisan manipulation of federal judicial districts.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Refusal to Realign

**Attack:** Judges or officials from an abolished circuit court refuse to recognize the new structure, claiming the Act is an unconstitutional infringement on judicial independence.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Binding Federal Law:** The Act is a binding federal law passed pursuant to constitutional authority.
- **Automatic Transfer:** Authority transfers automatically on Activation Day. The old circuits cease to legally exist.
- **Supreme Court Jurisdiction:** Any legal challenge to the Act itself would be heard by the Federal Supreme Court, which would provide a definitive ruling.

**Outcome:** Unilateral refusal to realign has no legal basis. The old structures are abolished by statute, and any challenge would be resolved by the Supreme Court.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Caseload Sabotage

**Attack:** During the transition, court clerks or administrators deliberately mis-route cases or delay transfers to create chaos and undermine the new system.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Clear Statutory Rules (Section 31):** The Act provides clear, non-discretionary rules for the transfer of pending cases.
- **Federal Oversight (Section 33(b)):** The Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts is tasked with overseeing the logistical transition, providing a centralized authority to resolve issues.
- **Judicial Orders:** Courts can issue specific orders to compel the transfer of cases and sanction non-compliant officials.

**Outcome:** The transition is governed by clear rules and federal oversight, making deliberate sabotage difficult and subject to legal and administrative sanction.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Political Battles Over New Judgeships** | High | The initial allocation of judgeships will be politically contentious. Mitigation requires a transparent process based on objective caseload data. |
| **Logistical Complexity of Transition** | Medium | The transfer of thousands of cases and personnel is a massive undertaking. Mitigation requires robust planning and funding for the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. |
| **Loss of Established Circuit Precedent** | Medium | The Act acknowledges this by making old precedent persuasive. New circuits will need to prioritize establishing a stable body of law. |
