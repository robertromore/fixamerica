# Guidance on Contested Policy Domains

This document explains the constitutional treatment of three highly contested
policy domains where the Regional Federal Constitution intentionally remains
silent: reproductive rights, firearms policy, and educational standards.

This guidance addresses:

- [Gap 29 — Reproductive Rights Regional Divergence](../../04-meta/02-identified-gaps.md)
- [Gap 30 — Firearms Policy Coordination](../../04-meta/02-identified-gaps.md)
- [Gap 32 — Educational Standards Divergence](../../04-meta/02-identified-gaps.md)

## Why Constitutional Silence?

### The Design Principle

The Regional Federal Constitution is built on the principle that **structural
legitimacy requires genuine policy pluralism on contested questions**. Not
every important issue should be constitutionally resolved.

For domains where:

- reasonable people deeply disagree based on fundamental values,
- no national consensus exists on the correct policy,
- regional variation reflects genuine community differences, and
- constitutional entrenchment would delegitimize the system for one side,

the constitution deliberately leaves policy authority to Regions.

### What Constitutional Silence Means

Constitutional silence on a domain means:

- Regions have primary authority to set policy
- The federal government has no enumerated power to impose uniform policy
- No DLRS floor domain covers the issue (unless amended)
- Divergence is expected, permitted, and intentional

Constitutional silence does **not** mean:

- No constitutional protections apply
- Anything goes
- Related rights are unprotected

## Part I: Reproductive Rights (Gap 29)

### Constitutional Treatment

(a) **No Enumerated Floor.** Reproductive rights are not among the five
enumerated floor domains in the proposed DLRS mechanism (see [DLRS Proposal](dual-legitimacy-rights-floor-statute.md)).

(b) **Regional Authority.** Under Article II, healthcare regulation is
primarily Regional unless involving interstate commerce or federal enumerated
powers.

(c) **Floor Domain Amendment.** If the DLRS proposal is adopted, adding
reproductive rights as a floor domain would require constitutional amendment.

### Existing Protections

Despite constitutional silence on reproductive policy specifically, several
protections apply:

**1. Freedom of Movement (Article I, Section 8)**

- Citizens may travel freely between Regions
- Regions may not impose barriers to interstate travel
- Persons traveling for medical procedures in other Regions cannot be
  prevented from traveling

**2. Anti-Discrimination Floors (If DLRS Adopted)**

- If the DLRS proposal is adopted and establishes anti-discrimination floors,
  these would limit discrimination in access to services generally
- This does not directly address reproductive services but may have
  indirect effects

**3. Due Process Floors (If DLRS Adopted)**

- If DLRS is adopted, procedural due process floors would apply to all
  government actions
- Criminal prosecutions must meet due process standards
- This protects process, not substantive reproductive rights

### What the Constitution Does NOT Resolve

The constitution does not resolve:

- Whether abortion should be legal
- At what gestational age restrictions may apply
- Whether contraception access may be restricted
- Whether fertility treatment may be regulated
- Liability for providers serving out-of-Region patients

These are left to Regional policy determination.

### Why This Choice?

Reproductive rights are among the most contested issues in American politics.
Constitutional entrenchment on either side would:

- delegitimize the entire constitutional project for roughly half the
  population,
- reproduce the current dynamic of attempting to win everything through
  constitutional interpretation,
- undermine the core premise that Regional pluralism is legitimate.

Constitutional silence allows:

- pro-choice Regions to protect abortion access,
- pro-life Regions to restrict abortion,
- citizens to move between Regions based on policy preferences,
- democratic resolution at a level where consensus is possible.

### Paths to Resolution

If national consensus develops, reproductive rights could be addressed through:

1. **Constitutional Amendment** - If the DLRS proposal is adopted, adding
   reproductive rights to DLRS domains, or directly establishing specific
   protections in the constitution
2. **DLRS Under Existing Domains** - If DLRS is adopted and reproductive
   rights are construed as falling within existing domains (unlikely given
   the proposed five-domain structure)
3. **Regional Convergence** - If all Regions voluntarily adopt similar policies

---

## Part II: Firearms Policy (Gap 30)

### Constitutional Treatment

(a) **No Enumerated Floor.** Firearms rights/regulations are not among the
five enumerated floor domains in the proposed DLRS mechanism.

(b) **Second Amendment.** The existing Second Amendment continues to apply,
as interpreted by federal courts. The Regional Federal Constitution does not
alter Second Amendment jurisprudence.

(c) **Regional Authority.** Within Second Amendment constraints, firearms
policy is primarily Regional.

### Existing Protections

**1. Second Amendment (Preserved)**

- Federal constitutional protection for firearms rights continues
- Federal courts interpret Second Amendment limits on Regional regulation
- This provides a floor against total prohibition

**2. Freedom of Movement (Article I, Section 8)**

- Citizens may move between Regions
- Possessing firearms lawfully in one Region does not immunize against
  prosecution in Regions with different rules

**3. Mutual Recognition (Article I, Section 9)**

- Does NOT automatically extend to firearms
- Regions are not required to recognize concealed carry permits from other
  Regions
- Specific firearms recognition would require inter-regional agreement

### What the Constitution Does NOT Resolve

The constitution does not resolve:

- Magazine capacity limits
- Assault weapons definitions and bans
- Concealed carry requirements
- Background check details
- Red flag law provisions
- Open carry rules
- Reciprocity between Regions

### Why This Choice?

Firearms policy is deeply contested, with strong constitutional arguments on
multiple sides. The existing Second Amendment provides a federal floor;
additional constitutional specification would:

- entrench one side's preferred policy as constitutional law,
- generate the same interpretive battles currently surrounding the Second
  Amendment,
- undermine Regional pluralism on a matter where community standards
  legitimately vary.

### Coordination Mechanisms Available

Though the constitution does not resolve firearms policy, Regions may:

1. **Enter Inter-Regional Compacts** - Voluntary reciprocity agreements
2. **Adopt Uniform Standards** - Through voluntary coordination
3. **Create Joint Databases** - For background check coordination

These require Regional agreement, not constitutional mandate.

### Travel Guidance

Citizens traveling between Regions with firearms should:

- Research destination Region's laws before travel
- Comply with transport requirements (e.g., unloaded, locked)
- Not assume home Region permits are valid elsewhere
- Note that federal law provides some protection for transport through
  jurisdictions with stricter rules (existing FOPA safe harbor)

## Part III: Educational Standards (Gap 32)

### Constitutional Treatment

(a) **Regional Authority.** Education is primarily a Regional competency
under Article II.

(b) **No Federal Standards.** The federal government has no general authority
to mandate curriculum content.

(c) **No DLRS Domain.** Education is not among the five enumerated floor
domains in the proposed DLRS mechanism.

### Existing Protections

**1. Freedom of Movement (Article I, Section 8)**

- Students may move between Regions
- Regions may not discriminate against students from other Regions

**2. Mutual Recognition (Article I, Section 9)**

- Regions must recognize educational credentials (diplomas, degrees)
- Students transferring between Regions must have transcripts accepted
- This ensures mobility but not curriculum uniformity

**3. Higher Education Accreditation**

- Existing federal-regional accreditation systems continue
- Accredited institutions are recognized nationwide
- Professional licensing recognizes accredited credentials

### What the Constitution Does NOT Resolve

The constitution does not resolve:

- Science curriculum content (evolution, climate science)
- History curriculum (what events, perspectives)
- Civics education content
- Health education (including sex education)
- Religious content in public schools

### Why This Choice?

Education content is a domain where:

- community values legitimately differ,
- local democratic control is historically important,
- federal mandate would be deeply contested,
- Regional experimentation may produce valuable variation.

The tradeoff is accepting divergence for the benefit of local democratic
control.

### Coordination Mechanisms Available

Though the constitution does not mandate uniform standards, Regions may:

1. **Adopt Common Standards Voluntarily** - Similar to Common Core adoption
   (voluntary in most states)
2. **Recognize Each Other's Assessments** - For college admission, transfer
3. **Coordinate Through Interstate Compacts** - For specific subjects

### Long-Horizon Risks

The identified gap acknowledges that educational divergence creates risks:

- Students may be unprepared for universities in other Regions
- Civics education may produce incompatible constitutional understandings
- Scientific literacy may vary dramatically

These are accepted tradeoffs, mitigated by:

- Freedom of movement (families can relocate)
- Higher education standards (universities set admission requirements)
- Market pressure (employers prefer educated workers)
- Political accountability (voters can change Regional education policy)

## General Guidance for Contested Domains

### For Citizens

When policy domains are constitutionally unresolved:

- Your Region's policy applies while you are in that Region
- Other Regions' policies apply when you travel there
- Freedom of movement allows you to relocate to Regions with preferred policies
- Political participation in your Region can change policy

### For Regional Governments

When exercising authority in contested domains:

- You have broad authority within constitutional constraints
- You may not punish conduct that occurred lawfully in other Regions
- You may not prevent citizens from traveling to other Regions
- You may not discriminate based on Regional origin

### For Inter-Regional Relations

Even without constitutional resolution:

- Regions may enter voluntary coordination agreements
- Best practices may emerge and spread
- Uniform policies may develop through convergence
- Extreme divergence creates political pressure toward resolution

---

## Potential Future Development

Constitutional silence is not permanent. These domains could be addressed
through:

**Constitutional Amendment:**

- Adopting the DLRS proposal and adding domains to its enumeration
- Establishing specific rights or limits directly in the constitution
- Requires Article XIII amendment process

**DLRS Under Existing Domains (if DLRS adopted):**

- Creative interpretation of existing floor domains (unlikely to succeed for
  most contested issues)
- Requires dual consent anyway

**Judicial Interpretation:**

- Federal courts continue to interpret existing constitutional provisions
- New precedents may emerge from Regional experimentation

**Voluntary Convergence:**

- Regions may voluntarily adopt similar policies
- Inter-regional agreements may create de facto uniformity
- Market and mobility pressures may drive convergence
