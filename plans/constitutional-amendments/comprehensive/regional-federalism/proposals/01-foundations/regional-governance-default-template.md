# Regional Governance: Constitutional Default Template

This proposal defines a constitutional default template for the internal governance of Regions. It establishes a "floor" of democratic standards to ensure that Regions are representative, accountable, and protect minority rights, while preserving flexibility for each Region to tailor its specific constitution.

This proposal addresses [Gap 02 — Internal Regional Governance](../../04-meta/02-identified-gaps.md) by providing a ready-made, stress-tested model for Regional constitutions.

---

## Constitutional Placement

This template is proposed for incorporation as **Article I, Section 3A** (Default Regional Governance), immediately following the existing provisions on Regional structure. It serves as a **recommended framework** for internal Regional constitutions, establishing a constitutional floor of democratic standards. All initial Regional constitutions must meet or exceed the standards of representation, accountability, and rights protection established herein, whether by adopting this template or an alternative structure certified by the Federal Supreme Court.

---

## Purpose

The central goal of Regional Federalism is to create more responsive and effective government. This is only possible if the Regions themselves are well-designed. This template aims to:

- **Prevent Intra-Regional Capture:** Ensure no single metropolitan area or political faction can dominate a Region.
- **Guarantee Representation:** Establish principles of proportional and geographic representation.
- **Ensure Democratic Legitimacy:** Provide for fair elections, majority mandates, and accountable executives.
- **Protect Minority Rights:** Safeguard the interests of geographic, political, and demographic minorities within a Region.
- **Provide a Stable Starting Point:** Give new Regions a coherent and functional starting point for their own constitutions.

---

## Draft Constitutional Template (Article I, Section 3A)

### 3A.1 Adoption and Supremacy

(a) Each Region shall adopt a constitution that conforms to the principles of representative, accountable, and rights-protecting government as established by the requirements of this Section.

(b) The provisions of this Section serve as a default template. A Region may adopt an alternative structure, provided it is certified by the Federal Supreme Court as meeting or exceeding the standards of representation, accountability, and rights protection established herein.

(c) The Regional constitution is the supreme law of the Region, subordinate only to the Federal Constitution and federal laws enacted pursuant to it.

---

### 3A.2 The Regional Legislature (Default Model)

(a) **Structure:** The legislative power of the Region shall be vested in a unicameral **Regional Assembly**.

(b) **Composition and Elections:**

- (1) The Assembly shall be elected every four years using a **Mixed-Member Proportional (MMP)** representation system.
- (2) Half of the members shall be elected from single-member geographic districts. The other half shall be party-list members used to ensure the overall composition of the Assembly is proportional to the region-wide party vote.
- (3) No party that receives less than 4% of the region-wide vote shall be entitled to list seats.
- (4) The total number of members in the Assembly shall be determined by a formula established in the Regional constitution. The formula should balance the principles of representation and legislative efficiency. A recommended default is approximately the cube root of the Region's population, but shall be not fewer than 101 members nor more than 401 members.

(c) **Districting:**

- (1) Geographic districts shall be drawn by an **Independent Redistricting Commission**.
- (2) Districts shall be compact, contiguous, and follow geographic and municipal boundaries where practicable.
- (3) The use of partisan data or incumbency protection in drawing districts is prohibited.
- (4) Districts must have near-equal population, with a maximum deviation of 5% between the most and least populous districts.

(d) **Powers:** The Assembly shall have the power to enact laws on all matters not reserved to the federal government, subject to the limitations in this Constitution and the Regional constitution.

---

### 3A.3 The Regional Executive (Default Model)

(a) **Structure:** The executive power of the Region shall be vested in a **Regional Governor**, who shall be the head of government for the Region. A **Lieutenant Governor** shall also be elected.

(b) **Elections:**

- (1) The Governor and Lieutenant Governor shall be elected on a joint ticket every four years by a direct, region-wide popular vote.
- (2) The election shall use a **Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV)** system to ensure the winning ticket has a majority mandate.

(c) **Powers:** The Governor shall:

- (1) Faithfully execute the laws of the Region and the federation.
- (2) Appoint heads of regional departments, subject to confirmation by a majority of the Regional Assembly.
- (3) Propose an annual budget to the Assembly.
- (4) Have a limited veto power over legislation, which may be overridden by a three-fifths (60%) vote of the Assembly.

(d) **Removal:** The Governor may be removed by a two-thirds vote of the Regional Assembly for cause, or by a region-wide recall election initiated by a petition of at least 15% of voters from the previous gubernatorial election.

---

### 3A.4 The Regional Judiciary (Default Model)

(a) **Structure:** The judicial power of the Region shall be vested in a **Regional Supreme Court** and a system of lower regional courts.

(b) **Appointments:**

- (1) All regional judges shall be appointed through a **merit-based commission system**.
- (2) An independent judicial nominating commission shall vet candidates and submit a shortlist of qualified individuals to the Governor.
- (3) The Governor shall appoint judges from the shortlist, subject to confirmation by the Regional Assembly.
- (4) The judicial nominating commission shall be composed of members appointed by the Governor, the Regional Assembly (with representation from non-majority parties), the regional bar association, and deans of accredited law schools within the Region, under rules ensuring no single entity controls a majority of appointments.

(c) **Term and Retention:**

- (1) Judges shall serve a single, non-renewable 14-year term.
- (2) Judges may be removed only for cause by a judicial conduct commission. They are not subject to retention elections.

(d) **Jurisdiction:** The Regional Judiciary shall have jurisdiction over all cases arising under Regional law. This includes serving as the primary venue for resolving disputes between the Region and its constituent states and municipalities, including challenges to Regional laws on the grounds of subsidiarity under Section 3A.5(c).

---

### 3A.5 Democratic and Rights Guardrails

(a) **Universal Suffrage:** Every citizen residing in the Region aged 18 or older shall have the right to vote in all regional elections.

(b) **Bill of Rights:** The Regional constitution shall include a Bill of Rights that meets or exceeds the protections of the Federal Bill of Rights and the DLRS floors.

(c) **Subsidiarity and Local Government:**

- (1) The Regional constitution shall recognize and protect the authority of local governments (municipalities, counties).
- (2) Powers shall be devolved to the most local level practicable. Regional preemption of local ordinances shall be limited to cases where a clear regional interest is at stake.
- (3) A "clear regional interest" shall be presumed to exist only where an issue has significant spillover effects across multiple jurisdictions within the Region or where uniformity is required to meet federal law.

(d) **Transparency:** All legislative sessions, committee meetings, and executive board proceedings shall be open to the public. All laws, regulations, and budgets shall be published in a timely and accessible manner.

---

### 3A.6 Regional Constitutional Amendment

(a) Amendments to the Regional constitution may be proposed by:

- (1) A two-thirds vote of the Regional Assembly, or
- (2) A citizen initiative petition signed by at least 8% of the number of voters in the last gubernatorial election, with no more than half of the required signatures coming from any single constituent state or metropolitan statistical area.

(b) Proposed amendments must be ratified by a majority of voters in a region-wide referendum.

---

### 3A.7 Eternity Clause

(a) **Entrenched Principles.** The following core principles of Regional governance are hereby declared entrenched and may not be altered, abolished, or diminished except as provided in subsection (b):

- (1) The commitment to **Mixed-Member Proportional (MMP)** representation for the Regional Assembly, ensuring both geographic and proportional partisan representation as defined in Section 3A.2(b).
- (2) The **independence of the Regional Judiciary**, including merit-based appointments, fixed non-renewable terms, and removal only for cause, as defined in Section 3A.4.
- (3) **Universal Suffrage**, guaranteeing every citizen residing in the Region aged 18 or older the right to vote in all regional elections, as defined in Section 3A.5(a).
- (4) The **Subsidiarity Clause**, protecting the authority of local governments and limiting Regional preemption, as defined in Section 3A.5(c).
- (5) The requirement for **Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV)** for the election of the Regional Governor, ensuring a majority mandate, as defined in Section 3A.3(b).
- (6) The **Independent Redistricting Commission**, ensuring fair and non-partisan drawing of geographic districts, as defined in Section 3A.2(c).

(b) **Amendment of Entrenched Principles.** Any proposed amendment to the Regional constitution that would alter, abolish, or diminish any of the entrenched principles enumerated in subsection (a) shall require ratification by:

- (1) A three-fourths (75%) vote of the Regional Assembly, AND
- (2) A three-fourths (75%) majority of votes cast in a region-wide popular referendum.

(c) **Judicial Review.** The Regional Supreme Court shall have mandatory jurisdiction to review any proposed amendment to determine if it falls within the scope of subsection (a) and requires the supermajority ratification process of subsection (b). Such review shall be expedited.

---

### 3A.8 Defensive Democracy Judicial Review

(a) **Prohibition of Anti-Constitutional Parties.** The Regional Supreme Court shall have the specific, narrow power to declare a political party unconstitutional if it is proven, through its aims and the actions of its members, to be actively seeking to undermine or eliminate the constitutional order as defined by the entrenched principles in Section 3A.7(a).

(b) **Initiation.** A case to declare a political party unconstitutional may only be brought by:
    - (1) A two-thirds (2/3) vote of the Regional Assembly, OR
    - (2) The Regional Governor, with the concurrence of the Lieutenant Governor.

(c) **Standard of Proof.** A finding that a political party is unconstitutional shall require clear and convincing evidence that the party's aims and the actions of its members are directed at the active subversion or elimination of the entrenched principles of the constitutional order. Mere criticism of the constitutional order or advocacy for its amendment through lawful means shall not be sufficient.

(d) **Consequences.** A finding that a political party is unconstitutional shall result in:
    - (1) The dissolution of the party;
    (2) A ban on its successor organizations;
    - (3) The forfeiture of any public funding or electoral privileges.

(e) **Safeguards.**
    - (1) The Regional Supreme Court shall apply heightened scrutiny to any such case, ensuring due process and freedom of association are protected.
    - (2) Any decision by the Regional Supreme Court under this Section shall be subject to expedited appeal to the Federal Supreme Court.
    - (3) This power shall be exercised as a last resort to protect the democratic constitutional order itself, not to suppress legitimate political dissent.

## Implementation Notes

- Regions are encouraged to adopt this template as a ready-made, stress-tested model for their internal constitutions.
- Deviations from this template are permitted, provided they are explicitly defined in the Regional constitution and are certified by the Federal Supreme Court as meeting or exceeding the democratic standards and protections established in this Section.
- The template is a constitutional default, not a rigid mandate. Regions may supersede specific provisions by unanimous agreement within the Region, provided the alternative structure maintains or enhances the core principles of representation, accountability, and rights protection.

---

## Statutory Recommendations to Mitigate Voter Apathy

While the constitutional template establishes robust structures, "Widespread voter apathy" remains a high-severity risk. The following statutory provisions are recommended for each Region to adopt to lower barriers to participation and increase civic engagement.

### 1. Automatic and Same-Day Voter Registration

- **Provision:** Mandate that each Region implement automatic voter registration (AVR) through government agencies (e.g., motor vehicle departments, social service agencies) and permit same-day registration at polling places on election day.
- **Mechanism:** This dramatically lowers the barrier to participation. Apathy is often a product of inconvenience and bureaucratic hurdles. By making registration an automatic, opt-out process, the state takes on the administrative burden, ensuring that nearly all eligible citizens are registered and ready to vote.
- **Impact:** This has been shown in numerous US states and other countries to significantly increase voter registration rates and, to a lesser but still meaningful extent, voter turnout.

### 2. Make Election Day a Regional Holiday

- **Provision:** Designate the day of any region-wide general election as a public holiday.
- **Mechanism:** This removes one of the most significant practical barriers to voting for working people: the inability to take time off from work or find childcare. It transforms Election Day from a personal chore into a shared civic event.
- **Impact:** This would likely increase turnout by making it easier for a wider range of citizens to participate, reducing the socioeconomic bias often seen in voter turnout.

### 3. Civic Engagement Vouchers

- **Provision:** Establish a program that provides every registered voter with a small number of "democracy vouchers" (e.g., four $25 vouchers) that they can donate to qualified political campaigns for regional office or to registered non-partisan civic news organizations.
- **Mechanism:** This approach combats apathy by empowering small-dollar participation. It gives every voter a tangible stake in funding the political system, reducing the sense that only wealthy donors have influence. It can also help create a healthier and more diverse media environment focused on civic issues.
- **Impact:** By diversifying the funding sources for campaigns and media, this can make the political system more responsive to ordinary citizens, which in turn can foster greater engagement.

## Rationale

| Feature | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Unicameral Legislature** | Simplifies the legislative process, increases accountability, and reduces gridlock. Bicameralism is unnecessary if the legislature is already proportionally representative. |
| **Mixed-Member Proportional** | The "best of both worlds": provides geographic representation and local accountability (district members) while ensuring overall fairness and partisan proportionality (list members). It prevents gerrymandering from distorting the final result. |
| **Independent Redistricting** | Removes the core conflict of interest where legislators choose their voters. This is a fundamental anti-capture mechanism. |
| **RCV for Governor** | Ensures the chief executive has a true majority mandate, which is critical for legitimacy in a diverse region. It avoids spoiler effects and plurality winners who are opposed by most of the electorate. |
| **Merit-Based Judiciary** | Insulates the judiciary from partisan politics and public pressure, allowing judges to rule on the law impartially. It is a crucial check on executive and legislative overreach. |
| **Single 14-Year Judicial Term** | Long enough to ensure independence and develop expertise, but avoids lifetime tenure which can lead to stagnation. Non-renewable to prevent judges from ruling with an eye toward reappointment. |
| **Subsidiarity Clause** | Explicitly protects local governance from regional overreach, ensuring that problems are solved at the most appropriate level. |
| **Eternity Clause** | Protects core democratic principles from transient majorities, ensuring the long-term stability and democratic nature of the Regional government. |
| **Defensive Democracy Judicial Review** | Provides a last-resort mechanism for the democratic system to defend itself against political parties actively seeking to undermine the constitutional order. |

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Metro Dominance

**Attack:** A few large, politically uniform metropolitan areas use their population advantage to consistently dominate regional policy, ignoring the interests of smaller cities and rural areas.

**Countermeasure:**

- **MMP System (Section 3A.2(b)):** While metro areas will have more district representatives, the proportional list seats ensure that minority parties (often concentrated in rural or exurban areas) get their fair share of total seats. A party cannot win 70% of the seats with 51% of the vote.
- **Geographic Districts:** The requirement for 50% of the legislature to come from geographic districts ensures that all parts of the Region have a local representative.
- **Subsidiarity (Section 3A.5(c)):** Protects the ability of local governments to manage their own affairs, limiting the scope of regional control.

**Outcome:** Metro dominance is blunted. While population centers have significant influence, the system guarantees representation and a voice for geographic minorities.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Partisan Entrenchment

**Attack:** A majority party, upon winning control of the Governorship and Assembly, attempts to rewrite election laws and gerrymander districts to lock in its power indefinitely.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Independent Redistricting (Section 3A.2(c)):** The legislature does not control the map-drawing process.
- **Proportional Representation:** Even a gerrymandered map has limited effect, as the list seats correct for any disproportionality created at the district level.
- **Judicial Independence (Section 3A.4):** Merit-based, long-term judges can strike down laws that violate the Regional constitution's democratic guardrails without fear of political reprisal.
- **Amendment Process (Section 3A.6):** Changing the core rules requires a public referendum, not just a legislative vote.

**Outcome:** The most common tools of partisan entrenchment are structurally blocked. Sustained dominance requires sustained popular support, not procedural manipulation.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Executive Overreach

**Attack:** A populist Governor claims a broad mandate from the RCV election and attempts to govern by executive order, bypassing the Assembly.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Legislative Checks:** The Assembly must confirm all department heads and can override vetoes (Section 3A.3(c)). The power of the purse remains firmly with the legislature.
- **Independent Judiciary:** The courts can enjoin executive orders that exceed the Governor's constitutional authority.
- **Impeachment/Recall (Section 3A.3(d)):** Provides a high-bar but essential mechanism for removing a rogue executive.

**Outcome:** While a Governor has a strong mandate, their power is clearly circumscribed by the other branches. Unilateral action is difficult to sustain.

---

### Attack Vector 4: Devolving to Dysfunction

**Attack:** A Region decides to opt out of the default template and adopts a constitution with features known to cause dysfunction (e.g., extreme gerrymandering, plurality-winner elections, partisan judicial elections).

**Countermeasure:**

- **Federal Court Certification (Section 3A.1(b)):** Any alternative constitution must be certified by the Federal Supreme Court as "meeting or exceeding" the standards of the default template.
- **Explicit Standards:** The template's standards (proportionality, majority mandates, judicial independence) provide a clear benchmark for the court to evaluate against. A system designed for minority rule would fail this test.

**Outcome:** Regions have flexibility, but not the flexibility to create unrepresentative or unstable systems. The core principles are locked in as a constitutional floor.

---

### Attack Vector 5: Undermining Entrenched Principles

**Attack:** A transient majority attempts to dismantle core democratic principles (e.g., abolish MMP, politicize judiciary, restrict suffrage) through a simple constitutional amendment.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Eternity Clause (Section 3A.7):** Requires a 75% supermajority in both the Assembly and a popular referendum to alter entrenched principles.
- **Judicial Review:** The Regional Supreme Court has mandatory jurisdiction to determine if an amendment falls under the Eternity Clause, ensuring the higher threshold is applied.

**Outcome:** Core democratic principles are protected from simple majority rule, requiring overwhelming and sustained consensus for fundamental changes to the system's democratic foundations.

---

### Attack Vector 6: Abuse of Defensive Democracy Judicial Review

**Attack:** The Regional Assembly or Governor attempts to use the Defensive Democracy Judicial Review (Section 3A.8) to suppress legitimate political opposition or disfavored parties.

**Countermeasure:**

- **High Threshold for Initiation:** Requires a two-thirds vote of the Assembly or Governor with Lieutenant Governor concurrence (Section 3A.8(b)).
- **Strict Standard of Proof:** Requires clear and convincing evidence of active subversion of entrenched principles, not mere criticism (Section 3A.8(c)).
- **Heightened Scrutiny by Court:** Regional Supreme Court must apply heightened scrutiny, protecting due process and freedom of association (Section 3A.8(e)(1)).
- **Expedited Federal Appeal:** Decisions are subject to expedited appeal to the Federal Supreme Court (Section 3A.8(e)(2)).

**Outcome:** The mechanism is designed with significant procedural and evidentiary hurdles to prevent its abuse for suppressing legitimate dissent, ensuring it acts as a last resort for constitutional self-preservation.

---

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Widespread voter apathy** | High | No structural fix can compel citizen engagement. However, more competitive elections under MMP may increase participation. |
| **Capture of Judicial Nominating Commission** | Medium | Staggered terms for commission members; diversity of appointing authorities (e.g., Governor, Assembly, Regional Bar). |
| **Rise of anti-system parties** | Medium | The Eternity Clause significantly entrenches core democratic principles against formal amendment. The Defensive Democracy Judicial Review provides a last resort against parties actively seeking to undermine the constitutional order. Remaining risks include undermining norms through legal but norm-breaking actions, or targeting non-entrenched provisions. |

---

## Summary

This default template provides a robust, modern, and resilient framework for regional governance. It anticipates and mitigates the most common failure modes of sub-national governments, particularly the tension between majority rule and minority rights, and between urban and rural interests. By making this the constitutional default, the Regional Federalism plan ensures that power is devolved to functional, democratic bodies, not just smaller-scale versions of a dysfunctional system.
