# Allocation Framework Act

This proposal establishes the statutory framework for operationalizing the
constitutional non-concurrency rule and spillover principle (Article II,
Section 3), providing detailed procedures for determining jurisdictional
allocation, resolving disputes, and facilitating inter-regional cooperation.

---

## Constitutional Foundation

Article II, Section 3 of the Regional Federal Constitution establishes the
non-concurrency rule and the spillover principle:

> **Section 3. Non-Concurrency and Spillover Principle.**
> (a) Where a power is enumerated to the federal government, it is exclusively
> federal. Where a power is reserved to the Regions, it is exclusively Regional.
> There shall be no concurrent powers unless explicitly provided by this
> Constitution.
> (b) Powers that, by their nature, substantially affect multiple Regions or
> the national interest shall be allocated to the federal government. Powers
> that primarily affect a single Region shall be allocated to that Region.

This Act implements these principles by defining operational thresholds,
establishing dispute resolution mechanisms, and providing tools for cooperation.

---

## Purpose

Establish an Allocation Framework that:

- Provides clear, objective criteria for determining when a matter
    "substantially affects" multiple Regions or the national interest.
- Establishes a tiered dispute resolution process for jurisdictional conflicts.
- Facilitates inter-regional cooperation through pre-cleared compact templates.
- Minimizes political interference in jurisdictional allocation decisions.
- Ensures the efficient and effective governance of matters with spillover effects.

## Part I: Spillover Determination and Allocation Principles

### Section 1. Spillover Principle Operationalized

(a) A matter "substantially affects" multiple Regions or the national interest
if it meets or exceeds the thresholds defined in Section 2 for any category of
spillover effect.

(b) When a matter is determined to substantially affect multiple Regions or the
national interest, the Allocation Review Board (established in Article II,
Section 5) shall recommend its allocation to the appropriate higher level of
government (federal or inter-regional).

### Section 2. Illustrative Spillover Metrics and Thresholds

(a) **Economic Spillover.** A matter has an economic spillover effect if it:

- (1) affects the GDP of an adjacent Region by more than 0.5% annually;
- (2) impacts employment in an adjacent Region by more than 1% in a specific
    sector;
- (3) creates or significantly alters a market for goods or services that
    crosses at least one Regional boundary and exceeds $1 billion annually.

(b) **Environmental Spillover.** A matter has an environmental spillover effect
if it:

- (1) causes transboundary pollution (air, water, soil) that exceeds federal
    or receiving Region standards (as defined in the Transboundary Environmental
    Harm Prevention Act);
- (2) affects shared natural resources (water, wildlife, ecosystems) across
    Regional boundaries (as defined in the Interstate Water Resources
    Coordination Act);
- (3) contributes to climate change impacts that disproportionately affect
    other Regions (as defined in the Climate Emergency Coordination Framework).

(c) **Infrastructure Spillover.** A matter has an infrastructure spillover effect
if it:

- (1) involves the construction, maintenance, or regulation of transportation,
    energy, or communication infrastructure that physically crosses or directly
    connects two or more Regions (as defined in the National Common Market Access Act);
- (2) affects the reliability or capacity of multi-regional utility grids.

(d) **Social Spillover.** A matter has a social spillover effect if it:

- (1) involves the movement of persons across Regional boundaries that
    materially impacts public services (e.g., healthcare, education) in a
    receiving Region by more than 2% of its annual budget;
- (2) creates or exacerbates a public health crisis that demonstrably spreads
    across Regional boundaries (as defined in the Public Health Emergency
    Coordination Framework);
- (3) affects the rights or legal status of persons who regularly reside or
    work in multiple Regions (as defined in the Interstate Professional
    Licensing Reciprocity Act).

(e) **National Interest Spillover.** A matter affects the national interest if it:

- (1) impacts national security or defense;
- (2) involves foreign relations or treaty obligations;
- (3) affects the stability of the national economy;
- (4) involves the protection of federal rights floors (as defined by DLRS).

### Section 3. Non-Concurrency Rule Operationalized

(a) When a matter is determined to be federal or inter-regional due to spillover
effects, Regions shall not exercise authority over that matter.

(b) When a matter is determined to be Regional, the federal government shall not
exercise authority over that matter, except as necessary to enforce federal
rights floors or other enumerated federal powers.

### Section 4. Data Sources and Methodology

(a) The Allocation Review Board (ARB) shall use the most recent and reliable
data from federal agencies (e.g., Census Bureau, Bureau of Economic Analysis,
EPA) and Regional governments for all spillover determinations.

(b) The ARB shall publish its methodology for calculating spillover effects,
including data sources, models, and assumptions.

---

## Part II: Allocation Review Board (ARB) Role and Dispute Resolution

### Section 11. ARB Jurisdiction

(a) The ARB shall have exclusive original jurisdiction to make initial
determinations regarding the allocation of powers under Article II, Section 3
and this Act.

(b) Any Region, the federal government, or any inter-regional agency may petition
the ARB for a jurisdictional determination.

### Section 12. Tiered Dispute Resolution Process

(a) **Initial Review.** Upon receipt of a petition, ARB staff shall conduct an
initial review and issue a preliminary recommendation within 30 days.

(b) **Regional Mediation.** If the preliminary recommendation is contested, the
ARB shall convene a mediation session with affected parties within 60 days.

(c) **Formal ARB Adjudication.** If mediation fails to resolve the dispute, the
ARB shall hold a formal hearing and issue a binding jurisdictional determination
within 90 days.

(d) **Federal Judicial Review.** ARB determinations are subject to expedited
judicial review in federal court, limited to questions of law and whether the
ARB's findings are supported by substantial evidence.

### Section 13. Interim Measures

(a) Pending a final determination, the ARB may recommend interim measures to
prevent irreversible harm or maintain the status quo.

(b) Federal courts may issue temporary injunctions to enforce ARB interim
recommendations.

---

## Part III: Coordination Mechanisms and Compacts

### Section 21. Pre-Cleared Compact Templates

(a) The ARB shall develop and publish pre-cleared compact templates for common
inter-regional coordination needs, including but not limited to:

- (1) transportation infrastructure maintenance and development;
- (2) energy grid management and resilience;
- (3) environmental monitoring and enforcement;
- (4) professional licensing reciprocity;
- (5) criminal justice information sharing.

(b) Compacts based on pre-cleared templates shall receive expedited review and
approval by the ARB.

### Section 22. Incentives for Cooperation

(a) The federal government may offer financial incentives (e.g., matching grants,
technical assistance) to Regions that enter into inter-regional compacts addressing
matters with significant spillover effects.

(b) The ARB shall publish best practices and model agreements for inter-regional
cooperation.

---

## Part IV: Revision and Review

### Section 31. Periodic Review of Act

(a) The ARB shall conduct a comprehensive review of this Act every ten (10) years,
following the decennial census.

(b) Recommendations for revisions to the spillover metrics, thresholds, or
dispute resolution procedures shall be submitted to Congress.

### Section 32. Revision by Ordinary Legislation

(a) This Act may be revised by ordinary legislation enacted by Congress.

(b) Revisions shall be consistent with the non-concurrency rule and spillover
principle of Article II, Section 3.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: ARB Capture and Bias

**Attack:** A partisan majority attempts to capture the ARB to consistently rule
in favor of federal or specific regional interests.

**Countermeasure:**

- **ARB Composition:** The ARB's composition (Article II, Section 5) is designed
    for independence, with staggered terms and diverse appointing authorities.
- **Expertise:** Members are chosen for expertise, not political affiliation.
- **Transparency:** All methodologies, data, and determinations are public.
- **Judicial Review:** ARB determinations are subject to expedited federal
    judicial review.

**Outcome:** Capture is difficult due to independent composition; biased rulings
are transparent and judicially reviewable.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Data Manipulation

**Attack:** A Region or federal agency attempts to manipulate data inputs to
influence spillover determinations.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Reliable Data Sources:** ARB mandates use of most recent and reliable
    federal and Regional data.
- **Public Methodology:** ARB's methodology is transparent and auditable.
- **Cross-Verification:** ARB can cross-verify data with multiple sources.
- **Judicial Review:** Data manipulation would be a basis for judicial review.

**Outcome:** Data manipulation is detectable and challengeable, making it difficult
to sustain.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Delay Tactics in Dispute Resolution

**Attack:** A party to a jurisdictional dispute attempts to delay the ARB process
to maintain a favorable status quo or exhaust opponents.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Strict Timelines:** The Act sets clear, short deadlines for each stage of
    the dispute resolution process (30, 60, 90 days).
- **Interim Measures:** ARB can recommend interim measures to prevent harm
    during delays.
- **Judicial Enforcement:** Federal courts can enforce ARB interim
    recommendations and compel action.

**Outcome:** Delay tactics are limited by strict timelines and judicial enforcement.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ambiguity in "substantially affects"** | Medium | Illustrative metrics and ARB precedent will clarify over time; judicial review provides ultimate arbiter. |
| **Political pressure on ARB members** | Medium | Independent composition, fixed terms, and judicial review mitigate, but cannot eliminate. |
| **Complexity of data collection** | Low | Federal support for Regional data systems; ARB can recommend data standards. |
| **Reluctance to use pre-cleared compacts** | Low | Incentives for cooperation; ARB can highlight benefits. |
