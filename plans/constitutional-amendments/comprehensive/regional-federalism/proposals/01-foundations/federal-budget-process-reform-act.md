# Federal Budget Process Reform Act

This proposal establishes a stable, predictable, and functional federal budget process designed to prevent government shutdowns, reduce fiscal brinkmanship, and encourage long-term planning.

---

## Purpose

Establish a Federal Budget Process Reform Act that:

-   Shifts the federal government to a two-year (biennial) budget cycle to allow for better long-term planning.
-   Implements an automatic continuing resolution to prevent government shutdowns if a new budget is not passed on time.
-   Integrates the Independent Fiscal Council into the budget process to ground deliberations in objective data.
-   Reduces the frequency and political cost of appropriations battles.

## Part I: Biennial Budgeting

### Section 1. Shift to Biennial Cycle

(a) The federal government shall operate on a two-year budget cycle (a "biennium").

(b) Each biennium shall begin on October 1 of every odd-numbered year.

### Section 2. Biennial Budget Timeline

(a) **President's Budget.** The President shall submit a detailed budget request for the upcoming biennium no later than the first Monday in February of each odd-numbered year.

(b) **Congressional Budget Resolution.** Congress shall complete action on a concurrent budget resolution for the upcoming biennium by April 15 of each odd-numbered year.

(c) **Appropriations.** All regular appropriations bills for the upcoming biennium shall be passed by the House and presented to the President by September 30 of each odd-numbered year.

---

## Part II: Automatic Continuing Resolution

### Section 11. Automatic Trigger

(a) If any regular appropriations bill for a new biennium has not been enacted by the start of the fiscal period on October 1, an automatic continuing resolution (CR) shall immediately take effect for the programs covered by the lapsed appropriation.

(b) This automatic CR prevents any lapse in appropriations or government shutdown.

### Section 12. Funding Level

(a) The automatic CR shall provide funding for covered programs at a rate of **95 percent** of the previous biennium's enacted discretionary funding level.

(b) **Incentive to Legislate.** The 5 percent reduction is designed to create a strong incentive for all parties to negotiate and pass a proper budget, as neither side's priorities are fully met by the automatic CR.

### Section 13. Duration and Termination

(a) The automatic CR shall remain in effect until the relevant regular appropriations bill is enacted.

(b) Upon enactment of the regular appropriation, the CR for those programs is immediately terminated.

---

## Part III: Role of the Independent Fiscal Council

### Section 21. Fiscal State of the Nation Report

(a) The Independent Fiscal Council (IFC), established by the `Fiscal Equalization Act`, shall present a "Fiscal State of the Nation" report to a joint session of Congress no later than January 15 of each odd-numbered year.

(b) The report shall provide an objective, non-partisan analysis of the nation's fiscal health to inform the upcoming biennial budget process.

### Section 22. Report Contents

(a) The Fiscal State of the Nation report shall include:
    - (1) 10-year and 75-year projections for federal revenue, spending, deficits, and debt under current law.
    - (2) An analysis of the long-term solvency of federal trust funds (e.g., Social Security, Medicare).
    - (3) An assessment of the macroeconomic impacts of the current fiscal path.
    - (4) An evaluation of the President's budget request against these baseline projections.

---

## Part IV: Supplemental and Emergency Appropriations

### Section 31. Supplemental Appropriations

(a) Supplemental appropriations outside of the biennial process shall be limited to unforeseen and urgent needs.

(b) Any supplemental appropriation must be accompanied by a formal statement from the President detailing why the funding could not be addressed through the regular biennial process.

(c) To promote fiscal discipline, supplemental appropriations bills shall require a three-fifths supermajority vote for passage in the House.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Deliberate Shutdown via Blocked Budget

**Attack:** A political faction attempts to force a government shutdown by refusing to pass any appropriations bills, believing they can extract concessions.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Automatic CR (Section 11):** A shutdown is impossible. The government continues to operate automatically, albeit at a slightly reduced funding level.
-   **Incentive to Negotiate (Section 12):** The 95% funding level is undesirable for all parties—it cuts programs the majority wants and doesn't cut enough for fiscal hawks—creating pressure to return to the negotiating table and pass a proper budget.

**Outcome:** The primary leverage for fiscal brinkmanship (the threat of a shutdown) is removed. Political battles will focus on the final budget, not on whether the government stays open.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Ignoring the Independent Fiscal Council

**Attack:** Congress completely ignores the IFC's "Fiscal State of the Nation" report and passes a budget with unrealistic economic assumptions or unsustainable long-term debt.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Public Accountability (Section 21):** The IFC's report is public and presented to a joint session, ensuring high media visibility.
-   **Objective Baseline:** The report provides an objective, credible baseline against which partisan budgets can be measured, arming the public and opposition with data to critique fiscally irresponsible proposals.

**Outcome:** While Congress cannot be forced to be fiscally responsible, the IFC's report makes the long-term consequences of its decisions transparent and politically costly.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Gaming the System with Supplemental Spending

**Attack:** Congress passes a fiscally disciplined biennial budget but then uses a simple majority to pass numerous supplemental appropriations bills for non-emergency items, defeating the purpose of the two-year cycle.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Supermajority Requirement (Section 31(c)):** The Act requires a three-fifths supermajority for all supplemental appropriations, making them much harder to pass.
-   **Urgency Justification (Section 31(b)):** The President must formally justify why the spending is urgent and unforeseen, creating a transparency check.

**Outcome:** The high procedural hurdle for supplemental spending reserves it for true emergencies and prevents it from becoming a routine loophole to bypass biennial budget discipline.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Political polarization leading to long-term CRs** | Medium | The 5% cut in the automatic CR creates a strong incentive to avoid this. If it persists, it becomes a major election issue. |
| **Difficulty of accurate two-year forecasting** | Medium | The process allows for supplemental appropriations for true emergencies; budgets can be based on conservative economic forecasts. |
| **Defining "unforeseen and urgent" for supplementals** | Low | The supermajority requirement provides a strong check against abuse, as a broad consensus is needed. |
