# National Archives and Records Modernization Act

This proposal modernizes the framework for preserving government records for historical and accountability purposes, establishing a federal-Regional partnership to ensure the integrity of the nation's historical record in a distributed system.

---

## Purpose

Establish a National Archives and Records Modernization Act that:

-   Strengthens the Presidential Records Act to ensure the complete and timely preservation of presidential records.
-   Establishes a formal partnership between the National Archives (NARA) and new Regional Archives.
-   Mandates common, open-source digital formats for all permanent government records to ensure long-term accessibility.
-   Ensures that in a system with more powerful regional governments, the historical record is preserved in a coordinated and professional manner.

## Part I: Federal Records Modernization

### Section 1. Presidential Records Act Modernization

(a) **Definition of Record.** The definition of "presidential record" is hereby clarified to include all forms of digital communication, including emails, text messages, and social media posts created or received by the President or their staff in the course of their official duties.

(b) **Automatic Archiving.** The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) shall implement systems for the automatic, real-time archiving of digital presidential records.

(c) **Prohibition on Destruction.** The willful destruction, alteration, or concealment of any presidential record shall be a felony punishable by fines and imprisonment.

(d) **Access Timeline.** The period during which a former President may restrict public access to records is reduced from twelve years to five years.

### Section 2. Congressional Records

(a) The official records of Congressional committees, including hearing transcripts, reports, and official correspondence, shall be transferred to NARA upon the conclusion of each Congress.

(b) The personal office files of Members of Congress shall be considered their personal property, but Members shall be encouraged to donate them to NARA or a relevant Regional or university archive upon leaving office.

## Part II: Federal-Regional Archives Partnership

### Section 11. Establishment of Regional Archives

(a) Each Region shall establish a "Regional Archive" responsible for preserving the permanent records of its Regional government, including the Regional Assembly, Governor, and regional agencies.

(b) Regional Archives shall operate under standards consistent with those established by NARA.

### Section 12. NARA Partnership Program

(a) NARA shall establish a "Regional Archives Partnership Program" to provide:
    - (1) **Technical Assistance:** Guidance on best practices for records preservation, management, and access.
    - (2) **Grant Funding:** Competitive grants to help Regional Archives establish their facilities, digitize records, and implement modern archival systems.
    - (3) **Training:** Professional development for Regional archival staff.

(b) Receipt of federal grant funding shall be conditioned on a Regional Archive's compliance with the national standards established under this Act.

## Part III: Digital Records Standards

### Section 21. National Digital Records Standard

(a) NARA shall, within two years of this Act's passage, establish a mandatory, open-source digital format standard for all permanent electronic records created by federal and Regional governments.

(b) The standard shall be designed for long-term preservation, accessibility, and interoperability, and shall be based on existing international best practices.

(c) All federal and Regional agencies shall be required to create or convert permanent records to this standard within five years of its establishment.

### Section 22. Declassification Review

(a) There is established an independent "Public Interest Declassification Board" with authority to review and recommend the declassification of federal records of historical significance.

(b) The Board may review agency classification decisions and may appeal continued classification to the President.

(c) A statutory presumption of declassification shall apply to all federal records after 25 years, unless an agency can demonstrate a specific, ongoing national security risk.

---

## Part IV: Oversight and Coordination

### Section 31. Federal-Regional Archives Council

(a) There is established a "Federal-Regional Archives Council" (the "Council").

(b) **Composition.** The Council shall be composed of:
    - (1) The Archivist of the United States (Chair).
    - (2) The head of each Regional Archive.
    - (3) Two members representing the historical and archival professional communities, appointed by the President.

(c) **Functions.** The Council shall:
    - (1) Advise NARA on the development of national digital records standards.
    - (2) Facilitate inter-regional cooperation on archival matters.
    - (3) Develop best practices for records management and preservation.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Destruction or Concealment of Records

**Attack:** A President or Regional Governor attempts to destroy or hide politically damaging records before leaving office.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Automatic Digital Archiving (Section 1(b)):** Real-time archiving of digital records reduces the opportunity for selective destruction.
-   **Explicit Criminal Penalties (Section 1(c)):** The Act makes willful destruction a felony, a significant deterrent.
-   **Whistleblower Protections:** Federal and Regional whistleblower laws would protect staff who report attempts to destroy records.

**Outcome:** While physical records remain vulnerable, the combination of automatic digital archiving and clear criminal penalties makes it much harder and riskier to conceal or destroy the official record.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Regional Neglect

**Attack:** A Region underfunds its archive, leading to the neglect and potential loss of significant historical records of the Regional government.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Conditional Federal Funding (Section 12(b)):** NARA provides grants to Regional Archives, but this funding is conditioned on compliance with national standards.
-   **NARA Partnership:** The partnership program provides technical assistance and a framework for professional standards, creating pressure for Regions to maintain their archives.
-   **Public Accountability:** The failure of a Region to preserve its own history would become a matter of public record and political accountability.

**Outcome:** While the federal government cannot force a Region to fund its archive, the incentives and professional standards provided by the partnership program make neglect a costly and politically unattractive option.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Politicized Declassification or Over-classification

**Attack:** A federal agency refuses to declassify historically important but politically embarrassing documents, or a President selectively declassifies documents to harm political opponents.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Independent Declassification Board (Section 22(a)):** Creates an independent body to review agency decisions, providing a check on bureaucratic inertia or political bias.
-   **Statutory Presumption of Declassification (Section 22(c)):** Shifts the burden of proof to the agency to justify continued classification after 25 years.

**Outcome:** The process of declassification is made more transparent and less subject to the whims of a single agency or administration, promoting more timely public access to historical records.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Destruction of physical records** | Medium | Automatic digital archiving reduces reliance on physical copies; strict penalties deter. |
| **Technological obsolescence of digital formats** | Medium | Mandating open-source standards and regular review by the Council helps mitigate this long-term risk. |
| **Funding shortfalls for NARA and Regional Archives** | High | Requires sustained Congressional and Regional appropriations; advocacy from historical and transparency groups. |
