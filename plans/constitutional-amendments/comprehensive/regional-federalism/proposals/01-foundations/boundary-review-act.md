# Regional Boundary Review and Revision Act

This proposal establishes the statutory framework for the constitutional boundary
revision process (Article I, Section 4), providing detailed procedures for the
Independent Boundary Review Commission and the referendum process.

---

## Constitutional Foundation

Article I, Section 4 of the Regional Federal Constitution establishes that:

> Regional boundaries may be revised without full constitutional amendment through
> a process requiring an Independent Boundary Review Commission, Regional legislature
> approval, and national popular referendum.

This Act implements these principles through specific procedures.

---

## Purpose

Establish boundary review procedures that:

- create an independent, non-partisan commission for boundary assessment,
- ensure regular review of Regional boundaries following census data,
- provide clear criteria and procedures for boundary revision proposals,
- require dual consent (Regional legislatures and national referendum),
- prevent partisan manipulation of boundary revision timing.

---

## Part I: The Independent Boundary Review Commission

### Section 1. Establishment

(a) There is established an Independent Boundary Review Commission (the
"Commission") to review Regional boundaries and recommend adjustments.

(b) The Commission is an independent agency of the United States, not subject
to direction by the President or any executive department on substantive
matters.

### Section 2. Composition

(a) **Members.** The Commission shall consist of eleven members serving single
six-year staggered terms.

(b) **Removal.** Members may be removed only for cause (malfeasance,
incapacity, or neglect of duty) by a two-thirds vote of the Senate.

(c) **Initial Staggering.** Upon initial appointment:

- (1) three members shall serve two-year terms,
- (2) four members shall serve four-year terms,
- (3) four members shall serve six-year terms.

(d) **Vacancy.** Vacancies shall be filled for the remainder of the unexpired
term using the same appointment procedure as the original appointment.

### Section 3. Appointment Procedure

(a) **Presidential Appointments.** Two members shall be appointed by the
President, with the advice and consent of the Senate.

(b) **Non-Majority Senate Appointments.** Two members shall be appointed by
Senators not affiliated with the party or coalition holding the Senate majority:

- (1) if a single non-majority caucus exists, by its designated leader,
- (2) if multiple non-majority caucuses exist, one each by the two largest
    such caucuses,
- (3) if no formal caucuses exist, by the two Senators with the longest tenure
    who are not affiliated with the majority.

(c) **Gubernatorial Appointments.** Four members shall be appointed by Regional
Governors:

- (1) two appointed by a majority vote of all Regional Governors,
- (2) two appointed by a majority vote of Regional Governors from Regions not
    represented in the first two appointments.

(d) **Judicial Lottery.** Three members shall be selected by lottery from a
pool of retired federal judges who have been retired for at least five years,
maintained by the Administrative Office of the Courts.

(e) **Party Balance Requirement.** No appointing authority may select members
who, together with members selected by other appointing authorities, would
result in more than six members sharing the same party affiliation, recent
partisan employment, or coordinated political association.

### Section 4. Qualifications

(a) **Expertise.** Members must have demonstrated expertise in one or more of
the following:

- (1) demography and population analysis,
- (2) geography and regional planning,
- (3) economics and regional development,
- (4) public administration and governance.

(b) **Independence.** Members shall not, during their term, hold any other
office or employment under the United States or any State.

### Section 5. Disqualifications

(a) No person may serve on the Commission who has, within the ten years
preceding appointment:

- (1) held elected federal or State office,
- (2) served as a national party official,
- (3) been employed as a registered lobbyist,
- (4) been employed by a political campaign.

(b) No member may participate in any matter in which they have a personal
financial interest.

### Section 6. Budget and Resources

(a) **Mandatory Appropriation.** The Commission shall have an independent
budget appropriated as mandatory spending.

(b) **Budget Floor.** The budget may not be reduced below the prior year's
level adjusted for inflation (as measured by the Consumer Price Index).

(c) **Staff.** The Commission may hire staff as necessary for its functions.
Staff shall be subject to the same disqualification criteria as members.

### Section 7. Interim Commission

(a) If Congress fails to establish the Commission within two years of
ratification, the Comptroller General shall convene an interim Commission.

(b) **Interim Composition.** The interim Commission shall consist of nine
retired federal judges selected by lottery, with Regional diversity
requirements ensuring no more than two judges from any single Region.

(c) **Duration.** The interim Commission shall serve until Congress establishes
the permanent Commission.

## Part II: Boundary Review Process

### Section 11. Regular Review Cycle

(a) **Timing.** The Commission shall review Regional boundaries every twenty
years following each decennial census.

(b) **Data.** Within six months of census certification, the Census Bureau
shall provide the Commission with demographic, economic, and geographic data
necessary for boundary analysis.

(c) **Public Process.** The Commission shall:

- (1) hold public hearings in each Region,
- (2) accept public comment for a period of not less than 90 days,
- (3) publish preliminary findings for review before final recommendations.

### Section 12. Criteria for Boundary Revision

(a) **Statutory Criteria.** Congress shall establish criteria for boundary
revision by statute. Criteria may include:

- (1) population balance among Regions,
- (2) economic coherence and integration,
- (3) infrastructure alignment and transportation networks,
- (4) geographic considerations (natural boundaries, metropolitan areas),
- (5) historical and cultural connections,
- (6) administrative efficiency.

(b) **Prohibited Criteria.** Boundary revisions may not be based on:

- (1) partisan political advantage,
- (2) advantage to any racial or ethnic group,
- (3) punishment of any Region for political positions.

(c) **Criteria Updates.** Congress may update criteria by statute. Updated
criteria take effect for the next review cycle, not the current one.

### Section 13. Commission Recommendations

(a) **Deadline.** The Commission shall issue recommendations within 18 months
of receiving census data.

(b) **Content.** Recommendations shall include:

- (1) proposed boundary changes (if any),
- (2) analysis of how each change meets statutory criteria,
- (3) projected impact on affected Regions,
- (4) minority reports from dissenting commissioners.

(c) **Alternatives.** If the Commission identifies multiple viable options,
it may present alternatives for consideration.

---

## Part III: Congressional Action and Referendum

### Section 21. Congressional Action Deadline

(a) **Scheduling.** Within eighteen months of receiving Commission
recommendations, Congress shall schedule a national referendum on any
proposed boundary revision.

(b) **Failure to Act.** If Congress fails to act within eighteen months,
the Commission may directly submit its recommendations to the national
referendum process.

(c) **Congressional Modification.** Congress may modify Commission
recommendations before scheduling a referendum, but may not:

- (1) add Regions not considered by the Commission,
- (2) combine unrelated recommendations into a single referendum question.

### Section 22. Regional Legislature Approval

(a) **Requirement.** Boundary revisions require approval by two-thirds of
the legislature of each affected Region.

(b) **Affected Region.** A Region is "affected" if the proposed revision
would:

- (1) transfer territory to or from the Region,
- (2) change the Region's population by more than 5%,
- (3) create a new Region from part of the existing Region.

(c) **Sequence.** Regional legislature votes shall occur before the national
referendum. If any affected Region rejects the proposal, the referendum shall
not be held on that proposal.

### Section 23. National Referendum

(a) **Requirement.** Boundary revisions require approval by a majority of
votes cast in a national popular referendum.

(b) **Ballot Language.** The Commission shall draft neutral ballot language
describing the proposed revision. Ballot language shall:

- (1) describe the specific boundary changes,
- (2) identify affected Regions and populations,
- (3) not advocate for or against the proposal.

(c) **Timing.** The referendum shall be held on a date specified by Congress,
which may be concurrent with a general election.

### Section 24. Referendum Failure

(a) **Public Report.** If a proposed boundary revision fails to achieve the
required approvals, the Commission shall issue a public report analyzing
the reasons for failure within sixty days.

(b) **Cooling-Off Period.** No substantially similar proposal may be submitted
for referendum within four years.

(c) **Alternative Proposals.** The Commission may propose alternative
revisions addressing identified concerns in the next review cycle.

## Part IV: Election Proximity Restrictions

### Section 31. Pre-Election Blackout

(a) No boundary revision may be proposed, voted upon, or take effect within
one year before a federal presidential election.

(b) "Federal presidential election" means the general election for President,
not primary elections.

### Section 32. Post-Election Blackout

(a) No boundary revision may take effect within six months after a federal
presidential election.

### Section 33. Rationale

(a) The longer pre-election blackout (one year) prevents manipulation of
Regional composition to influence an imminent election.

(b) The shorter post-election blackout (six months) allows transitions to
proceed while preventing immediate post-election retaliation or
gerrymandering based on election results.

### Section 34. Calculation

(a) For purposes of this Part, the "federal presidential election" date is
the Tuesday following the first Monday in November of each presidential
election year.

(b) The pre-election blackout begins one year before this date.

(c) The post-election blackout ends six months after this date.

## Part V: Special Circumstances

### Section 41. Small Region Merger

(a) If a Region's population falls below one-half of one percent of the total
population of the United States, the Commission shall conduct a special review
within one year.

(b) The Commission may recommend:

- (1) merger with an adjacent Region,
- (2) enhanced inter-Regional cooperation agreements,
- (3) federal technical assistance,
- (4) no action (if the Region demonstrates capacity to maintain minimum
    institutional functions).

(c) Any merger recommendation requires the same approval process as other
boundary revisions.

### Section 42. Emergency Review

(a) The Commission may conduct an emergency review outside the regular
20-year cycle if:

- (1) requested by two-thirds of affected Regional legislatures, and
- (2) circumstances have changed substantially since the last review
    (population shifts of 20% or more, natural disasters, economic
    transformation).

(b) Emergency reviews follow the same procedures as regular reviews.

### Section 43. New Region Creation

(a) The Commission may recommend creation of a new Region if:

- (1) the proposed Region would have sufficient population (at least 3 million),
- (2) the proposed Region has geographic and economic coherence,
- (3) the affected existing Regions consent.

(b) New Region creation requires the same approval process as other boundary
revisions.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Commission Capture

**Attack:** A President or Senate majority attempts to pack the Commission
with partisan appointees to manipulate boundary recommendations.

**Countermeasure:**

- Six-member party balance limit (Section 3(e))
- Multiple appointing authorities (President, non-majority Senators, Governors,
  judicial lottery)
- Ten-year disqualification for partisan activity (Section 5(a))
- Six-year staggered terms prevent rapid turnover
- Removal only for cause by two-thirds Senate vote

**Outcome:** Capturing the Commission requires sustained control of multiple
appointing authorities over many years; single-election swings cannot pack
the Commission.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Congressional Obstruction

**Attack:** Congress refuses to schedule referendum on Commission
recommendations to block boundary changes.

**Countermeasure:**

- 18-month deadline for Congressional action (Section 21(a))
- Commission bypass authority if Congress fails to act (Section 21(b))
- Commission submits directly to referendum process

**Outcome:** Congressional inaction does not veto Commission recommendations;
the process continues without Congressional scheduling.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Partisan Gerrymandering

**Attack:** Boundary revisions are designed to advantage one party by
concentrating opposing voters in fewer Regions.

**Countermeasure:**

- Prohibited criteria (Section 12(b)) explicitly ban partisan advantage
- Commission expertise and independence requirements
- Public hearings and comment periods create transparency
- Two-thirds Regional legislature approval creates Regional veto
- National referendum creates popular check

**Outcome:** Partisan gerrymandering requires Commission complicity plus
supermajority Regional approval plus national referendum approval; all three
checks must fail.

---

### Attack Vector 4: Election Timing Manipulation

**Attack:** Boundary changes are timed to take effect immediately before an
election to advantage one party.

**Countermeasure:**

- One-year pre-election blackout (Section 31)
- Six-month post-election blackout (Section 32)
- No proposals, votes, or implementation during blackout periods

**Outcome:** Boundary changes cannot be timed to affect imminent elections;
minimum 18-month lead time for any change.

---

### Attack Vector 5: Interim Commission Abuse

**Attack:** Congress deliberately fails to establish permanent Commission so
that interim Commission (with different composition) handles review.

**Countermeasure:**

- Two-year deadline triggers interim Commission (Section 7(a))
- Interim Commission has same independence (retired judges by lottery)
- Regional diversity requirements for interim Commission
- Interim Commission serves until permanent Commission established (incentive
  for Congress to act)

**Outcome:** Deliberately blocking permanent Commission does not create a
more manipulable interim body; both have independence safeguards.

### Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| Regional legislature capture blocks beneficial changes | Medium | National referendum alone insufficient; Regional veto is intentional feature |
| Long review cycles (20 years) may not adapt to rapid change | Medium | Emergency review provision (Section 42) for significant circumstances |
| Commission gridlock if members cannot agree | Low | Minority reports allow dissent; Commission can present alternatives |
| Criteria manipulation by Congress | Low | Updated criteria apply to next cycle, not current |
