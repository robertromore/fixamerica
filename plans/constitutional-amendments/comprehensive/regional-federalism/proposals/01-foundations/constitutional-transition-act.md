# Constitutional Transition Act

This proposal establishes the statutory framework for managing the multi-year
transition from the current constitutional system to the Regional Federalism
model. It provides a phased implementation plan to ensure legal continuity,
economic stability, and political legitimacy.

---

## Constitutional Foundation

The final article of the proposed Regional Federal Constitution (Article XV)
will state:

> This Constitution shall take effect upon ratification, and its implementation
> shall be governed by the procedures and timelines established in the
> Constitutional Transition Act.

This Act provides the substance of that mandate.

---

## Purpose

Establish a Constitutional Transition Act that:

- provides a clear, predictable, and phased roadmap for implementation,
- ensures legal and economic continuity throughout the transition,
- prevents a "big bang" implementation that could destabilize the nation,
- establishes temporary institutions to manage the transition, and
- mitigates the risks of political resistance, legal challenges, and
    economic disruption.

---

## Guiding Principles

1. **Phased Implementation:** The transition will occur in distinct, sequential
    phases, with clear milestones for advancing to the next phase.
2. **Legal Continuity:** All existing federal, state, and local laws remain in
    effect unless explicitly superseded by the new constitutional order.
3. **Economic Stability:** The transition shall be designed to minimize
    disruption to markets, contracts, and fiscal systems.
4. **Dual Governance:** During the transition, existing institutions (federal,
    state) will continue to operate alongside newly forming provisional
    Regional institutions.
5. **Independent Oversight:** A dedicated, independent body will oversee the
    transition process.

## Part I: The Transitional Commission

### Section 1. Establishment

(a) There is established a Transitional Commission to oversee the implementation
of the new constitutional framework.

(b) The Commission shall have a limited lifespan, dissolving automatically upon
the completion of Phase V.

### Section 2. Composition

(a) The Commission shall consist of 15 members:

- (1) Three appointed by the President.
- (2) Four appointed by congressional leadership (Speaker, Senate Majority
    Leader, House Minority Leader, Senate Minority Leader).
- (3) Three appointed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court.
- (4) Five elected by a council of state governors.

(b) Members shall be chosen for their expertise in constitutional law, public
administration, and logistics, with strict non-partisan qualifications.

### Section 3. Powers and Duties

(a) The Commission shall:

- (1) Certify the completion of each transition phase.
- (2) Mediate disputes between federal, state, and provisional Regional bodies.
- (3) Administer transitional funding.
- (4) Publish a public-facing "Transition Dashboard" tracking progress.

---

## Part II: Phased Implementation

The transition shall proceed through five distinct phases.

### Section 11. Phase I: Pre-Ratification (Duration: Pre-existing)

(a) **Activities:** Public debate, drafting of the new constitution, and the
national ratification campaign.

(b) **Governance:** Existing constitutional system remains fully in effect.

### Section 12. Phase II: Provisional Establishment (Duration: 12 Months)

(a) **Trigger:** Ratification of the new Constitution.

(b) **Activities:**

- (1) Establishment of the Transitional Commission.
- (2) Appointment of members to the new independent federal bodies (IEC,
    ARB, Fiscal Council, Boundary Commission).
- (3) Allocation of transitional funding by Congress.
- (4) States are formally grouped into their provisional Regions.

(c) **Governance:** Existing institutions continue to govern. New federal
commissions begin organizational setup but have no authority yet.

### Section 13. Phase III: Regional Constitution Drafting (Duration: 18 Months)

(a) **Trigger:** Certification of Phase II completion by the Transitional
Commission.

(b) **Activities:**

- (1) Each provisional Region convenes a constitutional convention.
- (2) Regions draft and ratify their own internal constitutions, consistent
    with the federal `regional-governance-default-template.md`.
- (3) The Federal Supreme Court certifies each Regional constitution.

(c) **Governance:** Existing institutions continue to govern. Provisional
Regional bodies have drafting authority only.

### Section 14. Phase IV: First Elections and Activation (Duration: 24 Months)

(a) **Trigger:** Certification of Phase III completion (all Regions have
certified constitutions).

(b) **Activities:**

- (1) The first elections for Regional Assemblies and Governors are held.
- (2) The first elections for the new federal House and Senate are held.
- (3) On "Activation Day" (e.g., Jan 1 of the year following elections), the
    newly elected federal and Regional governments are sworn in.
- (4) The new constitutional articles on legislative, executive, and judicial
    powers take effect.

(c) **Governance:** On Activation Day, formal authority transfers to the new
institutions. State governments continue to operate with powers as defined
under the new federal and Regional constitutions.

### Section 15. Phase V: Full Integration and Normalization (Duration: 36 Months)

(a) **Trigger:** Activation Day.

(b) **Activities:**

- (1) The Fiscal Equalization program begins its first transfers.
- (2) The Allocation Review Board begins hearing its first cases.
- (3) Federal agencies are restructured to align with the new allocation of
    powers.
- (4) A comprehensive review of all existing federal laws is conducted to
    resolve conflicts with the new constitutional order.

(c) **Governance:** The new system is fully operational. The Transitional
Commission oversees the wind-down of old processes and dissolves at the end of
this phase.

## Part III: Key Transitional Components

### Section 21. Legal Continuity

(a) **Presumption of Validity.** All federal and state laws, regulations, court
precedents, contracts, and property rights in effect on Ratification Day remain
in full force unless they are in direct conflict with an explicit provision of
the new Constitution.

(b) **Conflict Resolution.** A joint congressional-judicial task force shall be
established to identify and propose resolutions for statutory conflicts.

### Section 22. Fiscal Continuity

(a) **Transitional Funding.** Congress shall appropriate a one-time, multi-year
budget for all transitional activities, administered by the Transitional
Commission. This includes funding for provisional Regional bodies and the first
Regional elections.

(b) **Taxation.** Existing federal and state tax systems remain in effect until
formally replaced or amended by the new federal and Regional governments after
Activation Day.

### Section 23. Personnel Transition

(a) Federal civil service employees shall be retained.

(b) A process shall be established for transferring federal employees from
agencies whose functions are devolved to the Regions. This process will include
options for relocation, early retirement, or placement in other federal roles.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: State Refusal to Participate

**Attack:** A state government refuses to participate in its provisional Region's
constitutional convention, attempting to veto the entire process.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Federal Mandate:** The Transition Act is a binding federal law.
- **Direct Elections:** If a state legislature obstructs, the Transitional
    Commission can authorize at-large, federally administered elections for
    that state's delegates to the Regional convention.
- **Fiscal Incentives:** Non-participation could jeopardize the state's future
    receipt of federal funds.

**Outcome:** Obstruction by a single state cannot halt the process; federal
authority provides a backstop to ensure representation.

---

### Attack Vector 2: "Lame Duck" Sabotage

**Attack:** The outgoing "old" Congress or President, in the period before
Activation Day, attempts to pass laws, appoint officials, or take other actions
to sabotage the new system.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Transition Period Moratorium:** After the first elections for the new
    government (Phase IV), the old Congress is barred from passing any new
    legislation other than emergency appropriations.
- **Appointment Freezes:** All non-essential executive and judicial appointments
    are frozen during this "lame duck" transition period.

**Outcome:** The power of the outgoing government is strictly curtailed after the
new government has been elected, preventing last-minute sabotage.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Endless Legal Challenges

**Attack:** Opponents file hundreds of lawsuits challenging every step of the
transition to grind the process to a halt.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Exclusive Jurisdiction:** The Act grants the Federal Supreme Court exclusive,
    original jurisdiction over all challenges to the transition process itself.
- **Expedited Review:** All such challenges are subject to a mandatory 30-day
    review and decision timeline.
- **Presumption of Validity:** Actions taken by the Transitional Commission
    consistent with the Act are presumed valid unless shown to be a clear abuse
    of authority.

**Outcome:** Legal challenges are channeled into a single, expedited path,
preventing death-by-a-thousand-cuts litigation in lower courts.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mass Civil Disobedience** | Critical | No legal act can prevent this. The phased approach and long timeline are designed to build legitimacy and reduce the shock that could trigger such a response. |
| **Economic Panic** | High | Clear rules on legal and fiscal continuity are designed to reassure markets. A dedicated economic stabilization task force within the Transitional Commission is essential. |
| **Transitional Commission Capture** | Medium | The diverse appointment structure (executive, legislative, judicial, state) makes capture by a single faction difficult. |
| **Timeline Slippage** | Medium | The Transitional Commission has authority to grant limited extensions for specific phases if good-faith efforts are underway, but cannot indefinitely delay the process. |
