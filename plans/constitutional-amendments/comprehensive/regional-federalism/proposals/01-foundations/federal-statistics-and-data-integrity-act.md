# Federal Statistics and Data Integrity Act

This proposal establishes the statutory independence, funding mechanisms, and data governance standards for the principal federal statistical agencies, ensuring the data underpinning the Regional Federalism framework is reliable and insulated from political interference.

---

## Purpose

Establish a Federal Statistics and Data Integrity Act that:

-   Codifies the scientific and administrative independence of core federal statistical agencies.
-   Protects core statistical programs from political manipulation through mandatory funding floors.
-   Establishes a National Data Governance Council to set standards for data sharing and privacy between federal and Regional governments.
-   Ensures the data required by other foundational acts (e.g., `Fiscal Equalization Act`) is trustworthy and consistently available.

## Part I: Agency Independence and Governance

### Section 1. Covered Agencies

(a) This Act applies to the principal federal statistical agencies, including but not limited to:
    - (1) The Census Bureau.
    - (2) The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).
    - (3) The Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).
    - (4) The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS).
    - (5) The National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).

### Section 2. Director Appointments and Terms

(a) The head of each covered agency shall be a Director, appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.

(b) Directors shall serve single, staggered 10-year terms.

(c) **Qualifications.** Nominees must possess distinguished expertise in statistics, economics, demography, or a related scientific field.

(d) **Removal.** A Director may be removed by the President only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. The President must provide a written justification to Congress for any such removal.

### Section 3. Scientific Integrity

(a) All activities of covered agencies, including data collection, analysis, and dissemination, shall be conducted according to the highest principles of scientific integrity and shall be free from political interference.

(b) It shall be unlawful for any political appointee or elected official to attempt to alter, delay, suppress, or otherwise manipulate the timing or content of any official statistical release.

## Part II: Funding and Integrity

### Section 11. Mandatory Funding Floor

(a) Core programs of the covered agencies shall be funded through mandatory appropriations, not subject to the annual discretionary budget process.

(b) **Core Programs.** Core programs include, at a minimum:
    - (1) The Decennial Census.
    - (2) The Consumer Price Index (CPI).
    - (3) The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) calculation.
    - (4) The monthly employment and unemployment reports.

(c) The mandatory funding level shall be based on the prior fiscal year's appropriation for that program, adjusted for inflation and any new statutory requirements.

### Section 12. Penalties for Interference

(a) Any individual who violates Section 3(b) of this Act shall be subject to civil penalties and, in cases of willful violation, criminal prosecution.

---

## Part III: Data Governance and Coordination

### Section 21. National Data Governance Council

(a) There is established a "National Data Governance Council" (the "Council") to coordinate data policy across federal and Regional governments.

### Section 22. Composition

(a) The Council shall be composed of:
    - (1) The Chief Statistician of the United States (Chair).
    - (2) The Directors of the covered agencies listed in Section 1.
    - (3) The chief data officer (or equivalent) from each Region.

### Section 23. Functions

(a) The Council shall:
    - (1) Establish government-wide standards for data privacy, security, and confidentiality.
    - (2) Develop interoperability standards to facilitate data sharing between federal and Regional agencies.
    - (3) Mediate disputes between agencies or between federal and Regional governments regarding data access or standards.
    - (4) Advise Congress and the President on national data policy.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Appointment of Partisan Directors

**Attack:** A President attempts to appoint a partisan loyalist without relevant expertise to head a statistical agency.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Senate Confirmation (Section 2(a)):** The Senate must confirm all appointments.
-   **Expertise Requirement (Section 2(c)):** The Act mandates distinguished expertise, providing clear grounds for the Senate to reject unqualified nominees.
-   **Single, Long Term (Section 2(b)):** A 10-year term means a President will likely only appoint a Director once, reducing opportunities for politicization.

**Outcome:** While a President can nominate anyone, the statutory expertise requirement and Senate confirmation process provide a strong check against unqualified or purely partisan appointments.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Defunding Core Programs

**Attack:** A hostile Congress or President attempts to defund or cripple a core statistical program (like the Census or CPI) through the annual appropriations process.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Mandatory Funding Floor (Section 11):** Core programs are funded through mandatory appropriations, insulating them from the annual discretionary budget battles.
-   **Inflation Adjustment:** The funding floor automatically adjusts for inflation, preventing slow erosion of capacity.

**Outcome:** Core statistical programs are protected from being used as political leverage in the annual budget process.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Suppression or Manipulation of Data

**Attack:** A federal administration attempts to delay the release of unfavorable economic data until after an election or pressures agency staff to alter methodologies to produce a more favorable result.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Explicit Prohibition (Section 3(b)):** The Act makes it explicitly unlawful for political officials to interfere with statistical releases.
-   **Independent Directors (Section 2):** Directors are insulated from political pressure by their long terms and for-cause removal protection.
-   **Criminal Penalties (Section 12):** Willful violation carries the risk of criminal prosecution, a powerful deterrent.
-   **Whistleblower Protections:** Federal whistleblower laws would protect agency staff who report such interference.

**Outcome:** The combination of statutory prohibition, director independence, and criminal penalties creates a strong firewall against the suppression or manipulation of official statistics.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Defining "core programs" for mandatory funding** | Medium | The Act lists the most critical programs; Congress can amend the list, but this requires a transparent legislative act. |
| **Subtle political pressure on methodologies** | Medium | Scientific integrity principles and peer review processes within agencies provide a professional buffer. |
| **Regional resistance to data sharing standards** | Low | Federal funding for Regional programs can be conditioned on compliance with national data standards set by the Council. |
