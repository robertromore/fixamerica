# Federal Civil Service Modernization Act

This proposal establishes a statutory framework to safeguard the independence, enhance the effectiveness, and modernize the structure of the federal civil service, ensuring a professional, non-partisan bureaucracy capable of implementing the Regional Federalism model.

---

## Purpose

Establish a Federal Civil Service Modernization Act that:

-   Strengthens protections for career civil servants against politically motivated personnel actions.
-   Codifies the independence of agency Inspectors General.
-   Creates a formal program for intergovernmental personnel rotation between federal and Regional governments.
-   Modernizes federal hiring processes to attract and retain critical talent.

## Part I: Civil Service Protections

### Section 1. Reaffirmation of Merit System Principles

(a) It is the policy of the United States that the federal workforce shall be managed in accordance with merit system principles and shall be free from prohibited personnel practices.

(b) **Prohibited Practices Clarified.** For the purposes of this Act, prohibited personnel practices explicitly include any action taken against a career civil servant on the basis of perceived political affiliation, loyalty, or lack thereof.

### Section 2. For-Cause Removal Protections

(a) A career employee in the competitive service or the Senior Executive Service may be removed or demoted only for cause, defined as misconduct, neglect of duty, malfeasance, or performance that is unacceptable after an opportunity to improve.

(b) No new schedule or classification of federal employees may be created that would remove these for-cause protections from career civil servants.

### Section 3. Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) Modernization

(a) **Quorum.** The MSPB shall be empowered to decide cases with a quorum of two members, but a quorum shall not be required for the Board to continue its adjudicatory functions. If a quorum is not present, cases may be heard and decided by an administrative judge, whose decision is final unless appealed to the full Board once a quorum is restored.

(b) **Expedited Review.** The MSPB shall give priority and expedited review to any case involving an allegation of politically motivated retaliation.

## Part II: Inspector General Independence

### Section 11. For-Cause Removal of Inspectors General

(a) An Inspector General (IG) may be removed by the President only for documented cause, such as permanent incapacity, neglect of duty, malfeasance, or a felony conviction.

(b) **Congressional Notification.** The President must provide a detailed written justification to both chambers of Congress at least 30 days prior to the removal of an IG.

### Section 12. Acting Inspectors General

(a) An individual may serve as an Acting Inspector General for no more than 210 days.

(b) If the President fails to nominate a permanent IG within that period, the authority to appoint an Acting IG shall transfer to the Chair of the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE).

---

## Part III: Intergovernmental Service Program

### Section 21. Establishment of Rotation Program

(a) The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) shall establish and administer an "Intergovernmental Professional Rotation Program."

(b) The program shall facilitate temporary assignments of senior federal civil servants to Regional government agencies and senior Regional civil servants to federal agencies.

### Section 22. Program Details

(a) **Duration.** Rotational assignments shall typically last for a term of one to two years.

(b) **Status.** Participants shall remain employees of their home government, retaining their salary, benefits, and seniority.

(c) **Purpose.** The program is designed to build intergovernmental expertise, foster collaborative networks, and share best practices between federal and Regional bureaucracies.

## Part IV: Hiring and Talent Management Modernization

### Section 31. Streamlined Hiring Authority

(a) Federal agencies are granted direct-hire authority for positions designated by OPM as being in critical need, including but not limited to roles in cybersecurity, data science, artificial intelligence, and engineering.

### Section 32. Skills-Based Hiring

(a) OPM shall reform federal job classification and qualification standards to prioritize demonstrated skills, competencies, and experience over rigid educational degree requirements, particularly for technical roles.

### Section 33. Modernized Job Classifications

(a) OPM is directed to conduct a comprehensive review and overhaul of the General Schedule (GS) classification and pay system within five years to better reflect modern job roles and allow for more flexible compensation in high-demand fields.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Mass Firing of "Disloyal" Civil Servants

**Attack:** A President attempts to fire large numbers of career civil servants deemed politically disloyal by creating a new employment schedule (e.g., "Schedule F") that strips them of for-cause removal protections.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Explicit Prohibition (Section 2(b)):** The Act explicitly prohibits the creation of new schedules to remove for-cause protections from career employees.
-   **Statutory Protections (Section 2(a)):** For-cause protections are codified in statute, not just regulation, making them harder to change.
-   **MSPB and Judicial Review:** Any such removal would be appealable to the MSPB and then to federal court.

**Outcome:** The statutory firewall makes it illegal to strip protections from career civil servants, preventing mass politically motivated firings.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Gutting of Independent Oversight

**Attack:** A President fires multiple Inspectors General who are conducting investigations into the administration, replacing them with compliant "acting" officials indefinitely.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **For-Cause Removal for IGs (Section 11):** An IG can only be fired for documented cause, with advance notice to Congress.
-   **Time Limit on Acting IGs (Section 12):** Prevents a President from leaving an "acting" loyalist in place indefinitely. If the President fails to nominate a replacement, appointment authority transfers to an independent body (CIGIE).

**Outcome:** The independence of Inspectors General is significantly strengthened, making it much harder for an administration to neutralize them as an oversight mechanism.

---

### Attack Vector 3: "Burrowing" of Political Appointees

**Attack:** An outgoing administration attempts to convert a large number of political appointees into career civil service positions to embed loyalists within the bureaucracy.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **OPM Oversight:** OPM retains its authority to review and approve or deny conversions from political to career positions.
-   **Probationary Period:** Converted employees are subject to a probationary period where they can be more easily removed.
-   **Transparency:** This Act can be amended to require public reporting of all such conversions to increase scrutiny.

**Outcome:** While not fully eliminated by this Act, the risk of "burrowing" is managed by existing OPM oversight. Further transparency requirements could strengthen this.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Slow pace of cultural change in bureaucracy** | High | The Intergovernmental Rotation Program is designed to cross-pollinate ideas and break down silos. |
| **Complexity of MSPB appeals process** | Medium | Expedited review for political retaliation cases helps, but the system remains complex. |
| **Congressional inaction on OPM reforms** | Medium | The Act directs OPM to act, but Congressional funding and oversight are still required for a full GS system overhaul. |
