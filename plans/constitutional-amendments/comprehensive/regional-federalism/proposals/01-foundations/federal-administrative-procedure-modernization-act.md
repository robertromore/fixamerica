# Federal Administrative Procedure Modernization Act

This proposal modernizes the federal Administrative Procedure Act (APA) to align with the Regional Federalism framework, requiring federal agencies to consult with Regions and analyze regional impacts during the rulemaking process.

---

## Purpose

Establish a Federal Administrative Procedure Modernization Act that:

-   Embeds the principles of federalism directly into the administrative state.
-   Requires federal agencies to formally consult with relevant inter-regional councils during the rulemaking process for major regulations.
-   Mandates the publication of "Regional Impact Statements" to assess a rule's effect on Regional governance and finances.
-   Grants Regions explicit legal standing to challenge federal regulations that overstep federal authority.

## Part I: Rulemaking Process Modernization

### Section 1. Definitions

(a) **Major Rule.** For the purposes of this Act, a "major rule" is any federal rule that the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs determines is likely to result in:
    - (1) An annual effect on the economy of $200 million or more.
    - (2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, industries, or governments.
    - (3) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, or innovation.
    - (4) Significant impacts on the authority or fiscal condition of one or more Regional governments.

(b) **Relevant Inter-Regional Council.** The inter-regional council whose policy domain corresponds to the subject matter of the proposed rule (e.g., the Inter-Regional Healthcare Coordination Council for a health rule).

### Section 2. Mandatory Regional Consultation

(a) Before publishing a notice of proposed rulemaking for any major rule, the proposing federal agency shall consult with the relevant Inter-Regional Council.

(b) **Consultation Requirements.** The agency shall:
    - (1) Provide the Council with the draft text of the proposed rule.
    - (2) Solicit written feedback from the Council on the rule's potential impacts on Regions.
    - (3) Address all substantive feedback received from the Council in the preamble to the final rule, explaining how the feedback was incorporated or why it was not.

### Section 3. Regional Impact Statements

(a) When proposing any major rule, the agency shall prepare and publish a "Regional Impact Statement" (RIS).

(b) The RIS shall analyze the rule's expected impacts on:
    - (1) **Regional Authority:** The extent to which the rule preempts or limits Regional law or decision-making.
    - (2) **Fiscal Impact:** The projected direct costs and administrative burdens imposed on Regional governments.
    - (3) **Inter-Regional Commerce:** Any potential barriers to commerce or mobility between Regions.

(c) The RIS shall be published alongside the notice of proposed rulemaking and be subject to public comment.

## Part II: Judicial Review and Standing

### Section 11. Standing for Regions

(a) Any Regional government shall have standing to bring a civil action in federal court to challenge a final federal rule.

### Section 12. Grounds for Challenge

(a) In addition to other grounds for review under the APA, a Regional government may challenge a final rule on the grounds that:
    - (1) The agency failed to comply with the procedural requirements of this Act, including mandatory consultation (Section 2) and the preparation of an adequate Regional Impact Statement (Section 3).
    - (2) The rule exceeds the federal government's authority under the `Allocation Framework Act` or other constitutional provisions defining the federal-Regional balance of power.

### Section 13. Standard of Review

(a) In reviewing a rule challenged under Section 12(a)(2), courts shall not grant deference to an agency's interpretation of the scope of its own federal authority relative to Regional authority. The court shall determine the question of federal versus Regional power de novo.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Perfunctory Consultation

**Attack:** A federal agency complies with the letter of the law by "consulting" with a Regional council but ignores all substantive feedback, rendering the process meaningless.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Written Response Requirement (Section 2(b)(3)):** The Act requires the agency to address all substantive feedback in the final rule's preamble.
-   **Paper Trail for Judicial Review:** This creates a public record. A failure to meaningfully engage with significant Regional concerns can be used as evidence that the final rule is "arbitrary and capricious" under the APA, providing grounds for a court to remand it.

**Outcome:** While an agency can still ultimately disagree with Regional feedback, it cannot simply ignore it. It must build a public record justifying its decision, which can be challenged in court.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Boilerplate Impact Statements

**Attack:** An agency publishes a generic, boilerplate Regional Impact Statement (RIS) that fails to seriously analyze a rule's impact on the Regions.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Procedural Grounds for Challenge (Section 12(a)(1)):** An inadequate RIS is a procedural failure under this Act, giving Regions a direct basis for a legal challenge.
-   **Public Comment:** Regions and the public can submit comments highlighting the deficiencies of the RIS, strengthening the administrative record for a future lawsuit.

**Outcome:** A court can find that a boilerplate RIS fails to meet the statutory requirement and remand the rule to the agency for a proper analysis, delaying and potentially altering the rule.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Judicial Deference to Federal Agencies

**Attack:** Courts continue to apply strong deference doctrines (like *Chevron* deference), allowing federal agencies to interpret their own statutes broadly and encroach on Regional authority, even when challenged by Regions.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Explicit Standard of Review (Section 13):** The Act explicitly directs courts *not* to grant deference to agencies on questions of federal-Regional power allocation.
-   **De Novo Review:** It requires courts to decide these fundamental structural questions "de novo" (from the new), treating the agency's view as just one argument among others.

**Outcome:** This provision effectively carves out federalism questions from traditional agency deference, forcing courts to independently police the boundary between federal and Regional authority as intended by the Constitution and the `Allocation Framework Act`.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Agency capture by regulated industries** | High | This Act does not directly address industry capture. Mitigation relies on other public integrity laws (e.g., ethics, lobbying). |
| **Defining "significant impacts" for major rules** | Medium | OIRA has established precedent for this, but political pressure can influence determinations. Judicial review provides a backstop. |
| **Complexity and delay in rulemaking** | Medium | The additional steps add time to the rulemaking process. Mitigation involves setting clear deadlines and providing adequate agency resources. |
