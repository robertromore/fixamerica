# Tribal-Regional Relations Framework

This proposal establishes constitutional and statutory provisions clarifying
the relationship between tribal nations and Regional governments, preserving
tribal sovereignty while creating clear governance structures.

This proposal addresses [Gap 27 — Tribal-Regional Relations](../04-meta/02-identified-gaps.md)
by defining Regional-tribal interactions, governance for tribes spanning
multiple Regions, and Regional government obligations to tribes.

---

## Constitutional Placement

This framework would be incorporated as:

- **Article XX, Section 3** (Tribal Nations) - Constitutional provisions
- **Tribal-Regional Relations Act** - Implementing legislation

---

## Foundational Principles

### Sovereignty Preservation

(a) Nothing in this framework diminishes tribal sovereignty, self-governance
rights, or the government-to-government relationship between tribal nations
and the United States.

(b) The federal trust responsibility to tribal nations is unaffected by the
creation of Regional governments.

(c) Tribal nations are not subject to Regional authority unless they consent.

### Federal Primacy

(a) Federal-tribal relations remain exclusively federal.

(b) Regions may not:

- (1) terminate or modify tribal recognition;
- (2) alter treaty rights;
- (3) diminish trust lands without federal and tribal consent;
- (4) tax tribal lands or tribal members on tribal lands.

(c) Federal law governing tribes preempts conflicting Regional law.

---

## Part I: Constitutional Provisions (Article XX, Section 3)

### 3.1 Recognition of Tribal Sovereignty

(a) Federally recognized tribal nations retain all sovereign powers not
expressly limited by federal law or treaty.

(b) Regional governments shall respect and cooperate with tribal governments
as distinct political sovereigns.

(c) The inclusion of tribal lands within Regional boundaries does not extend
Regional jurisdiction to those lands.

### 3.2 Regional Obligations

(a) **Non-Interference.** Regional governments may not:

- (1) exercise civil or criminal jurisdiction on tribal lands without tribal
    consent or federal authorization;
- (2) impose Regional taxes on tribes or tribal members for activities on
    tribal lands;
- (3) regulate activities on tribal lands without tribal or federal authorization;
- (4) impair access to tribal lands through adjacent Regional territory.

(b) **Cooperation.** Regional governments shall:

- (1) negotiate in good faith with tribes on matters of mutual concern;
- (2) provide reasonable access to Regional services for tribal members
    residing off-reservation on the same terms as other residents;
- (3) consult with tribes before taking actions that significantly affect
    tribal interests.
- (4) enter into coordination compacts for shared services, infrastructure,
    and emergency response as required by Article XX, Section 3(d), with
    compacts limited to coordination and not governance.

(c) **Non-Discrimination.** Regional law may not discriminate against tribal
members or treat tribal governments less favorably than other governments.

### 3.3 Tribes Spanning Multiple Regions

(a) **Unified Treatment.** When a tribal nation's territory spans multiple
Regions:

- (1) the tribal nation shall designate a primary Regional contact for
    governmental relations;
- (2) Regions shall coordinate their tribal relations to avoid conflicting
    policies;
- (3) the tribe may participate in inter-regional cooperation mechanisms
    under Article I, Section 5.

(b) **No Division.** Regional boundaries may not divide tribal lands without
tribal consent.

(c) **Boundary Review.** When Article I, Section 4 boundary reviews occur,
the Boundary Review Commission shall consult with affected tribes and avoid
dividing tribal territories unless tribes consent.

### 3.4 Tribal Participation in Regional Governance

Coordination compacts are mandatory for shared services, infrastructure, and
emergency response, but participation in Regional governance remains voluntary.

(a) **Mandatory Coordination Compacts.** Per Article XVIII, Section 3(d),
Regions and Tribal Nations shall enter into compacts for coordination of
shared services, infrastructure, and emergency response. These compacts are
constitutionally required and shall be negotiated in good faith.

(b) **Governance Participation Optional.** Beyond the mandatory coordination
compacts, Tribes are not required to participate in broader Regional
governance structures.

(c) **Optional Consultation.** Regions may establish formal consultation
mechanisms with tribes beyond compact requirements; tribal participation in
such mechanisms is voluntary.

(d) **Optional Representation.** Regional constitutions may provide for
tribal representation in Regional bodies; such representation requires
tribal consent and may be withdrawn.

(e) **DLRS Applicability.** Tribal nations are not subject to DLRS floors
unless they consent by formal action of their governing body.

### 3.5 Dispute Resolution

(a) Disputes between Regional governments and tribal nations shall be resolved
through:

- (1) government-to-government negotiation;
- (2) mediation (if both parties agree);
- (3) federal court adjudication.

(b) Regions may not use fiscal coercion, service denial, or other pressure
to compel tribal action.

(c) Federal courts have jurisdiction over Regional-tribal disputes as a matter
of federal law.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Creeping Jurisdiction

**Attack:** A Region gradually extends de facto jurisdiction over tribal lands
through service provision, infrastructure control, or regulatory pressure.

**Countermeasure:**

- Constitutional prohibition on jurisdiction without consent (Section 3.2(a)(1))
- Tribal lands excluded from Regional jurisdiction by default (Section 3.1(c))
- Federal court jurisdiction over disputes (Section 3.5(c))

**Outcome:** Jurisdictional expansion requires tribal consent; unilateral
extension is unconstitutional.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Fiscal Starvation

**Attack:** A Region withholds services or funding to pressure tribes into
unfavorable agreements.

**Countermeasure:**

- Prohibition on fiscal coercion (Section 3.5(b))
- Non-discrimination requirement (Section 3.2(c))
- Federal program set-asides maintained (Section 203)

**Outcome:** Coercive tactics are prohibited; tribes retain federal funding
pathways.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Boundary Gerrymandering

**Attack:** Boundary reviews divide tribal lands to weaken tribal political
influence or create administrative burdens.

**Countermeasure:**

- No division without tribal consent (Section 3.3(b))
- Boundary Review Commission must consult with tribes (Section 3.3(c))
- Unified treatment for split-Region tribes (Section 3.3(a))

**Outcome:** Tribal consent required for boundary changes affecting tribal lands.

---

### Attack Vector 4: Resource Capture

**Attack:** A Region depletes resources (water, fish, wildlife) that tribes
depend upon through treaty rights.

**Countermeasure:**

- Treaty resource rights not subject to Regional regulation (Section 302(a))
- Water rights preserved (Section 303)
- Environmental review required (Section 301)
- Federal court resolution (Section 302(c))

**Outcome:** Treaty rights trump Regional resource policies.

---

### Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| Federal trust responsibility weakens | Critical | Beyond Regional constitutional design |
| Congress modifies underlying tribal law | High | Constitutional provisions provide some protection |
| Tribes lack resources to enforce rights | Medium | Federal court access; legal assistance programs |
| Regional hostility creates friction | Medium | Federal oversight; consultation requirements |
