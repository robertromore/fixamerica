# De-Escalation Procedures Act

This proposal establishes the statutory framework for the constitutional de-escalation
ladder (Article XII, Section 3), providing detailed procedures for graduated response
to constitutional violations while prioritizing restoration over punishment.

---

## Constitutional Foundation

Article XII, Section 3 of the Regional Federal Constitution mandates:

> The Constitution mandates graduated, restoration-focused responses to constitutional
> breakdown, prioritizing:
>
> 1. judicial enforcement,
> 2. administrative remedies,
> 3. temporary intervention,
> 4. immediate restoration of self-government upon compliance.

This Act implements these principles through specific procedures.

---

## Purpose

Establish de-escalation procedures that:

- provide clear, graduated responses to constitutional violations,
- prioritize judicial resolution and avoid military intervention,
- ensure restoration of self-government is the goal at every level,
- create procedural safeguards against abuse of intervention authority,
- maintain federal-Regional cooperation during constitutional disputes.

---

## Part I: Level 1 - Judicial Enforcement

### Section 1. Primary Reliance on Courts

(a) **Initial Response.** The primary response to any alleged constitutional
violation shall be judicial enforcement through the court system.

(b) **Mandatory Jurisdiction.** Courts may not decline jurisdiction over
constitutional claims on standing or political-question grounds, consistent
with Article XIV, Section 1.

(c) **Expedited Review.** Constitutional enforcement actions shall receive
expedited review:

- (1) preliminary injunction hearing within 14 days of filing,
- (2) trial court decision within 60 days of filing,
- (3) appellate review within 45 days of notice of appeal,
- (4) Supreme Court review (if granted) within 60 days of certiorari.

### Section 2. Available Remedies

(a) Courts may issue:

- (1) declaratory judgments establishing constitutional violations,
- (2) injunctive relief requiring compliance,
- (3) orders specifying compliance steps and timelines,
- (4) appointment of special masters to monitor compliance.

(b) Courts may not impose punitive damages or criminal sanctions as part of
Level 1 enforcement.

### Section 3. Contempt Powers

(a) **Civil Contempt.** If a jurisdiction fails to comply with a court order:

- (1) the court may impose escalating daily fines (beginning at $100,000 per
    day, doubling every 30 days of non-compliance),
- (2) fines shall be deposited in a restoration fund used to remedy the
    constitutional violation,
- (3) responsible officials may be held in civil contempt until compliance.

(b) **Criminal Contempt.** Criminal contempt for willful defiance of court
orders shall be prosecuted by the Department of Justice only upon:

- (1) certification by the court that the jurisdiction has willfully defied
    a clear and specific order,
- (2) opportunity for the jurisdiction to purge contempt within 30 days,
- (3) approval by a three-judge panel of the circuit court.

### Section 4. Exhaustion Requirement

(a) Level 2 remedies may not be invoked until:

- (1) a court has issued a final order finding a constitutional violation, and
- (2) the jurisdiction has failed to comply within 90 days of the order, and
- (3) contempt proceedings have been initiated and the jurisdiction remains
    non-compliant.

(b) The Attorney General may request expedited escalation if:

- (1) the violation involves imminent and irreparable harm to constitutional
    rights, and
- (2) judicial remedies are demonstrably inadequate to prevent the harm.

---

## Part II: Level 2 - Administrative Remedies

### Section 11. Trigger Conditions

(a) Level 2 administrative remedies may be invoked only when:

- (1) Level 1 judicial enforcement has been exhausted,
- (2) the violation persists despite court orders, and
- (3) the Attorney General certifies that administrative remedies are necessary.

(b) Certification shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted
to Congress within 24 hours.

### Section 12. Withholding of Discretionary Federal Funds

(a) **Authority.** The federal government may withhold discretionary federal
funds from a non-compliant jurisdiction.

(b) **Limitations.**

- (1) Withheld funds must be reasonably related to the constitutional violation.
- (2) Funds for essential services (emergency response, healthcare, education)
    may not be withheld.
- (3) Equalization transfers under Article X may not be withheld at Level 2.
- (4) Withholding may not exceed 25% of total discretionary federal funds to
    the jurisdiction.

(c) **Restoration.** Withheld funds shall be restored within 30 days of
verified compliance.

### Section 13. Administrative Penalties

(a) Federal agencies may impose administrative penalties on non-compliant
jurisdictions, including:

- (1) exclusion from discretionary grant programs,
- (2) enhanced reporting requirements,
- (3) suspension of federal-Regional cooperation agreements.

(b) Penalties shall be proportionate to the violation and shall not exceed
the scope necessary to secure compliance.

### Section 14. Federal Assumption of Specific Functions

(a) **Authority.** Where a jurisdiction fails to perform constitutionally
required functions, the federal government may temporarily assume those
specific functions.

(b) **Scope.** Assumption authority is limited to:

- (1) election administration (if the violation involves denial of voting
    rights),
- (2) civil rights enforcement (if the violation involves discrimination),
- (3) environmental protection (if the violation involves transboundary harm),
- (4) other specific functions directly related to the constitutional violation.

(c) **Procedure.**

- (1) The Attorney General shall petition the court for assumption authority.
- (2) The court shall grant the petition if it finds that the jurisdiction
    has willfully refused to perform the function.
- (3) Assumption shall be limited in scope and duration (maximum 2 years).
- (4) The jurisdiction may petition for restoration of function upon
    demonstrating capacity and willingness to comply.

(d) **Costs.** The cost of federal assumption shall be recovered from the
non-compliant jurisdiction.

### Section 15. Escalation to Level 3

(a) Level 3 remedies may be invoked only when:

- (1) Level 2 administrative remedies have been in effect for at least 180 days,
- (2) the violation persists despite administrative remedies, and
- (3) the violation involves imminent threat to persons or fundamental rights.

(b) Escalation requires:

- (1) certification by the Attorney General,
- (2) approval by a three-judge panel,
- (3) notification to Congress (both chambers) with opportunity for
    disapproval resolution within 72 hours.

---

## Part III: Level 3 - Temporary Intervention

### Section 21. Trigger Conditions

(a) Level 3 temporary intervention may be invoked only when:

- (1) Levels 1 and 2 have been exhausted,
- (2) the constitutional violation poses imminent threat to:
    - (i) the physical safety of persons,
    - (ii) the exercise of fundamental constitutional rights, or
    - (iii) the functioning of democratic institutions, and
- (3) the Attorney General, with concurrence of the Secretary of Defense,
    certifies necessity.

(b) Level 3 may not be invoked solely because of policy disagreement,
political opposition, or delay in implementation of non-urgent court orders.

### Section 22. Federal Personnel Deployment

(a) **Authority.** The federal government may deploy civilian federal
personnel (law enforcement, election monitors, civil rights investigators)
to ensure compliance.

(b) **Scope.**

- (1) Deployed personnel shall exercise only the authority necessary to remedy
    the specific violation.
- (2) Personnel shall coordinate with local authorities where possible.
- (3) Personnel shall respect local law except where it conflicts with
    constitutional requirements.

(c) **Duration.** Deployment shall be limited to 90 days, renewable once
upon court approval.

### Section 23. Regional Guard Forces (Two-Key Authorization)

(a) **Two-Key Requirement.** Domestic deployment of Regional Guard forces
requires authorization from both, per Article XI, Section 2(g):

- (1) the President (or, if the President is unavailable or incapacitated,
    the next civilian in the line of succession), and
- (2) the Regional Governor of the Region in which deployment occurs (for
    single-Region deployment), or a majority of Regional Governors (for
    multi-Region deployment).

(b) **Exception.** If the Regional Governor is complicit in the constitutional
violation, the second key shall be provided by:

- (1) a majority vote of the Region's Congressional delegation, or
- (2) the Chief Justice of the Regional Supreme Court.

*Note: Per Article XI, Section 2(g), two-key authorization may not be delegated to military officers.*

(c) **Scope.** Regional Guard deployment under this section is limited to:

- (1) protecting persons whose rights are being violated,
- (2) securing facilities necessary for constitutional compliance,
- (3) maintaining order during federal assumption of functions.

(d) **Duration.** Guard deployment expires automatically after 30 days unless
reauthorized through the same two-key process.

(e) **Prohibited Uses.** Regional Guard forces may not be used to:

- (1) enforce policy preferences beyond constitutional requirements,
- (2) suppress lawful political activity or protest,
- (3) conduct mass arrests or detentions,

    of court orders.

### Section 24. Time and Scope Limits

(a) All Level 3 interventions shall be:

- (1) time-limited (maximum 90 days, renewable once),
- (2) scope-limited (only actions necessary to remedy the specific violation),
- (3) subject to ongoing judicial supervision,

## Part IV: Level 4 - Restoration

### Section 31. Immediate Restoration Upon Compliance

(a) **Compliance Verification.** Upon a jurisdiction's assertion of compliance:

- (1) the Attorney General shall verify compliance within 14 days,
- (2) the court shall hold a compliance hearing within 21 days,
- (3) if compliance is verified, all intervention measures terminate within 7
    days.

(b) **Partial Compliance.** If partial compliance is achieved:

- (1) intervention measures shall be reduced proportionately,
- (2) the court shall issue a modified compliance order,
- (3) the jurisdiction retains incentive to achieve full compliance.

### Section 32. No Ongoing Punishment

(a) Once compliance is achieved, the jurisdiction shall not be subject to:

- (1) continued fund withholding,
- (2) enhanced supervision beyond normal intergovernmental relations,
- (3) political retaliation or discrimination,
- (4) "reconstruction" periods or ongoing federal control.

(b) Normal intergovernmental relations shall resume immediately.

(c) Any official removed during intervention may seek restoration through
the jurisdiction's normal processes.

### Section 33. Post-Intervention Review

(a) Within 180 days of intervention termination, the Inspector General shall
conduct a review of the intervention to assess:

- (1) whether intervention was necessary and proportionate,
- (2) whether procedures were followed,
- (3) whether restoration was appropriately prompt,
- (4) lessons learned for future de-escalation.

(b) The review shall be transmitted to Congress and made public.

(c) The review shall not serve as a basis for punitive action against the
intervened jurisdiction, but may inform policy improvements.

---

## Part V: Procedural Safeguards

### Section 41. Congressional Notification and Oversight

(a) The Attorney General shall notify the leadership of both chambers of
Congress within 24 hours of:

- (1) Level 2 certification,
- (2) Level 3 authorization,
- (3) any extension or escalation.

(b) Congress may disapprove Level 3 intervention by concurrent resolution
of both chambers within 72 hours.

(c) The relevant committees shall receive classified briefings upon request.

### Section 42. Judicial Review

(a) Any intervention measure may be challenged in federal court.

(b) Courts shall review:

- (1) whether procedural requirements were satisfied,
- (2) whether the intervention is necessary and proportionate,
- (3) whether scope and duration limits are respected.

(c) Courts may modify, limit, or terminate intervention measures.

### Section 43. Protection Against Abuse

(a) **Partisan Abuse.** Intervention authority may not be used:

- (1) to gain partisan political advantage,
- (2) to target jurisdictions based on political affiliation,
- (3) to influence federal, Regional, or State elections.

(b) **Personal Liability.** Officials who invoke intervention authority in
bad faith or for prohibited purposes shall be personally liable and subject
to removal from office.

(c) **Inspector General Monitoring.** The Inspector General shall monitor
all de-escalation actions for compliance with this Act and shall report
any irregularities to Congress.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Pretextual Intervention

**Attack:** A President invokes de-escalation authority against a jurisdiction
controlled by the opposing party, citing a minor technical violation as pretext.

**Countermeasure:**

- Exhaustion requirements (Sections 4, 11, 15, 21) force progression through
  judicial and administrative levels before intervention
- Court certification required at each escalation
- Congressional notification with opportunity for disapproval
- Partisan abuse prohibition (Section 43(a))

**Outcome:** Multiple institutional checks make pretextual intervention
difficult; abuse is visible and challengeable.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Intervention Normalization

**Attack:** Frequent invocation of Level 2-3 remedies normalizes federal
intervention, eroding Regional autonomy.

**Countermeasure:**

- Strict exhaustion requirements create high procedural barriers
- Time limits (90 days) prevent open-ended intervention
- Immediate restoration requirement (Section 31) prevents lingering control
- Post-intervention review (Section 33) documents patterns
- No ongoing punishment rule (Section 32) removes incentive for normalized
  control

**Outcome:** Each intervention is temporary by design; normalization requires
sustained constitutional violations, not federal choice.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Complicit Courts

**Attack:** Courts refuse to certify escalation even when constitutional
violations are clear, blocking effective enforcement.

**Countermeasure:**

- Mandatory jurisdiction prevents dismissal (Article XIV, Section 1)
- Expedited review timelines (Section 1(c)) prevent indefinite delay
- Default enforcement clauses (Article XIV, Section 4) trigger automatically
  if courts fail to act

**Outcome:** Court obstruction is addressed through separate constitutional
provisions; de-escalation procedures assume courts function.

---

### Attack Vector 4: Guard Force Abuse

**Attack:** Regional Guard forces deployed under Level 3 are used for
purposes beyond constitutional enforcement.

**Countermeasure:**

- Two-key authorization requirement (Section 23(a-b))
- Enumerated scope limits (Section 23(c))
- Prohibited uses clause (Section 23(e))
- 30-day automatic expiration (Section 23(d))
- Ongoing judicial supervision (Section 24(c))

**Outcome:** Guard deployment has multiple constraints; abuse requires
multiple actors' complicity and is legally challengeable.

### Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| Coordinated federal-judicial capture | High | Beyond scope of this Act; addressed by broader constitutional design |
| Slow escalation in emergencies | Medium | Expedited escalation provision (Section 4(b)) for imminent harm |
| Political pressure against enforcement | Medium | Mandatory jurisdiction; procedural requirements reduce discretion |
| Post-compliance retaliation | Low | No ongoing punishment rule (Section 32); normal relations requirement |
