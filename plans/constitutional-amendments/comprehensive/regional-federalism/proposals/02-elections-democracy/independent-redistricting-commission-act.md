# Independent Redistricting Commission Act

This proposal establishes the statutory framework for the Independent Redistricting
Commission (IRC), a body crucial for drawing fair and non-partisan legislative
districts within each Region.

---

## Constitutional Foundation

The [Regional Governance: Constitutional Default Template](regional-governance-default-template.md)
explicitly mandates an Independent Redistricting Commission in Section 3A.2(c)(1),
stating that "Geographic districts shall be drawn by an Independent Redistricting
Commission." This Act implements this constitutional mandate through specific
procedures for its establishment, composition, appointment, and operational rules.

---

## Purpose

Establish an Independent Redistricting Commission that:

- ensures fair, transparent, and non-partisan drawing of legislative districts;
- prevents partisan gerrymandering and protects voter intent;
- promotes equitable representation for all communities within a Region;
- establishes clear, objective criteria for district boundaries; and
- operates independently from political influence.

---

## Part I: Establishment and Composition

### Section 1. Establishment

(a) There is established within each Region an Independent Redistricting
Commission (the "Commission") to draw the boundaries for the single-member
geographic districts of the Regional Assembly.

(b) The Commission is an independent agency of the Region, not subject to
direction by the Regional Governor, Regional Assembly, or any political party
on substantive matters related to district drawing.

### Section 2. Composition

(a) **Members.** The Commission shall consist of nine (9) members serving
single, non-renewable six-year staggered terms.

(b) **Removal.** Members may be removed only for cause (gross malfeasance,
incapacity, or neglect of duty) by a two-thirds vote of the Regional Supreme
Court, upon petition by the Regional Governor or a majority of the Regional
Assembly.

(c) **Initial Staggering.** Upon initial appointment:

- (1) three members shall serve two-year terms,
- (2) three members shall serve four-year terms,
- (3) three members shall serve six-year terms.

(d) **Vacancy.** Vacancies shall be filled for the remainder of the unexpired
term using the same appointment procedure as the original appointment, within
60 days of the vacancy occurring.

### Section 3. Appointment Procedure

(a) **Applicant Pools.** A non-partisan applicant review panel, composed of the
Chief Justice of the Regional Supreme Court, the Regional Auditor, and the dean
of the Region's largest public university law school, shall create two pools of
qualified applicants. Both pools shall be publicly available.

- (1) **Expert Pool.** The panel shall create a pool of at least 24 applicants
    who meet the expert qualifications in Section 4(a).
- (2) **Lay Citizen Pool.** The panel shall create a pool of at least 12
    applicants who meet the lay citizen qualifications in Section 4(b).

(b) **Selection.** The nine (9) Commissioners shall be selected from the
applicant pools through the following process:

- (1) The Regional Governor shall select two (2) members from the Expert Pool
    and one (1) member from the Lay Citizen Pool.
- (2) The Speaker of the Regional Assembly shall select one (1) member from the
    Expert Pool and one (1) member from the Lay Citizen Pool.
- (3) The leader of the largest non-majority party in the Regional Assembly
    shall select one (1) member from the Expert Pool and one (1) member from
    the Lay Citizen Pool.
- (4) The remaining two (2) members shall be selected by random lottery from
    the remaining applicants in the Expert Pool.

(c) **Party Balance Requirement.** No more than four (4) members of the
Commission shall be affiliated with the same political party. The final
composition of the Commission shall be three (3) members from the largest
political party in the Region, three (3) members from the second-largest
political party, and three (3) members not affiliated with either of the two
largest parties. If a selection would violate this balance, the selecting authority shall choose the next highest-ranked applicant from the pool who maintains the balance.

### Section 4. Qualifications

(a) **Expert Qualifications.** The six (6) members selected from the Expert
Pool must have demonstrated expertise in one or more of the following:

- (1) demography and population analysis,
- (2) geography and spatial analysis,
- (3) statistics and data science,
- (4) election law and administration,
- (5) public policy and community engagement.

(b) **Lay Citizen Qualifications.** The three (3) members selected from the Lay
Citizen Pool must:

- (1) be registered voters in the Region for at least five years preceding their
    application; and
- (2) not meet the expert qualifications in subsection (a).

(c) **General Qualifications.** All members shall not, during their term, hold any other
office or employment under the Region or any of its constituent states or
municipalities, nor be an officer of any political party.

### Section 5. Disqualifications

## Part II: Powers and Duties

### Section 11. Districting Criteria

(a) The Commission shall draw districts for the Regional Assembly based on the
following criteria, in order of priority:

- (1) **Population Equality.** Districts must have near-equal population, with
    a maximum deviation of 5% between the most and least populous districts.
- (2) **Contiguity.** Districts must consist of a single, unbroken area.
- (3) **Compactness.** Districts shall be as compact as practicable, minimizing
    the distance between all parts of the district.
- (4) **Preservation of Communities of Interest.** Districts shall, where
    practicable, preserve communities of interest, defined as contiguous
    populations that share common social, cultural, racial, ethnic, or economic
    interests.
- (5) **Respect for Political Subdivisions.** Districts shall, where practicable,
    respect the boundaries of existing constituent states, counties, and
    municipalities.

(b) **Prohibited Criteria.** The Commission shall not consider:

- (1) the residence of any incumbent or potential candidate,
- (2) the partisan affiliation of registered voters,
- (3) the results of previous elections,
- (4) the intent to favor or disfavor any political party or incumbent.

### Section 12. Redistricting Process

(a) **Timing.** The Commission shall begin the redistricting process within
three months of the official release of the decennial federal census data.

(b) **Public Input.** The Commission shall:

- (1) hold at least five (5) public hearings across the Region before drawing
    any draft maps, to solicit input on communities of interest and local concerns.
- (2) publish at least two (2) draft maps for public review and comment.
- (3) hold at least three (3) public hearings on the draft maps.
- (4) maintain a publicly accessible online portal for submitting comments,
    proposed maps, and data.

of how it meets the criteria in Section 11, shall be published immediately.

### Section 13. Data and Resources

(a) The Commission shall have access to all necessary demographic, geographic,
and election data from Regional and constituent state/municipal agencies.

(b) The Commission may hire staff and consultants with expertise in demography,
geography, and election administration.

## Part III: Budget, Accountability, and Enforcement

### Section 21. Budget and Resources

(a) **Mandatory Appropriation.** The Commission shall have an independent
budget appropriated as mandatory spending by the Regional Assembly.

(b) **Budget Floor.** The budget may not be reduced below the prior redistricting
cycle's level adjusted for inflation (as measured by the Regional Consumer Price
Index).

(c) **Staff.** The Commission may hire staff as necessary for its functions.
Staff shall be subject to the same disqualification criteria as members.

### Section 22. Judicial Review

(a) **Limited Review.** The Regional Supreme Court shall have exclusive
jurisdiction to review the adopted redistricting plan. Review shall be limited
to whether the plan complies with the criteria established in Section 11.

(b) **Standard of Review.** The Court shall give deference to the Commission's
discretion in balancing criteria, but shall overturn a plan if it finds that
the Commission:

- (1) failed to adhere to the population equality requirement,
- (2) violated any of the prohibited criteria, or
- (3) adopted a plan that is arbitrary, capricious, or a clear abuse of discretion.

(c) **Remedy.** If the Court finds the plan unlawful, it shall remand the plan
to the Commission with specific instructions for revision. The Commission shall
adopt a revised plan within 60 days. If the Commission fails to adopt a lawful
plan, the Court may adopt an interim plan.

### Section 23. Transparency and Public Reporting

(a) All Commission meetings shall be open to the public, with at least 7 days
advance notice.

(b) Minutes and voting records shall be published within 5 days of each meeting.

(c) The Commission shall publish a comprehensive report on its activities,
including all data used, methodologies, and a detailed rationale for the final
map.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Partisan Appointments

**Attack:** The Governor and Assembly leadership collude to appoint partisan
members to the Commission, undermining its independence.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Applicant Pool (Section 3(a)):** A non-partisan panel vets and creates the
    initial pool, limiting the choices of political actors.
- **Party Balance Requirement (Section 3(c)):** Explicitly limits the number
    of members from any single party, forcing bipartisan representation.
- **Multiple Appointing Authorities (Section 3(b)):** Governor, Speaker, and
    Minority Leader each make selections, ensuring diverse political perspectives.
- **Random Lottery (Section 3(b)(4)):** Two members are selected randomly,
    further insulating from partisan control.
- **Disqualifications (Section 5):** Strict rules prevent recent political
    operatives from serving.

**Outcome:** While political actors have some influence, the multi-stage,
multi-actor, and party-balanced appointment process makes outright partisan
stacking extremely difficult.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Criteria Manipulation

**Attack:** The Commission draws maps that technically meet population equality
but are highly gerrymandered by subtly prioritizing compactness or communities
of interest in a partisan way.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Prohibited Criteria (Section 11(b)):** Explicitly bans considering partisan
    data or election results.
- **Order of Priority (Section 11(a)):** Population equality is highest, followed
    by contiguity, compactness, communities of interest, and political subdivisions.
    This limits how other criteria can be used to override higher priorities.
- **Transparency (Section 12(c)):** All data and methodologies are public,
    allowing external analysis to detect partisan bias.
- **Judicial Review (Section 22):** Courts can overturn plans that are
    "arbitrary, capricious, or a clear abuse of discretion," providing a check
    against subtle manipulation.

**Outcome:** The combination of explicit prohibitions, prioritized criteria,
transparency, and judicial review makes it difficult to create partisan maps
under the guise of neutral criteria.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Budget Starvation

**Attack:** The Regional Assembly attempts to undermine the Commission by
underfunding its budget, preventing it from hiring staff or conducting proper
analysis.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Mandatory Appropriation (Section 21(a)):** The budget is not subject to
    discretionary annual political fights.
- **Budget Floor (Section 21(b)):** Prevents reductions below prior levels,
    adjusted for inflation, ensuring consistent resources.
- **Judicial Review:** Failure to provide adequate funding could be challenged
    as an obstruction of a constitutionally mandated body.

**Outcome:** The Commission's budget is protected from partisan attacks, ensuring
it has the resources to fulfill its mandate.

---

### Attack Vector 4: Delay Tactics

**Attack:** The Commission delays the adoption of a final map beyond the deadline,
creating uncertainty or forcing the use of an outdated map.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Strict Deadlines (Section 12(a), (d)):** Clear timelines for starting the
    process and adopting a final map.
- **Judicial Review (Section 22(c)):** If the Commission fails to adopt a
    lawful plan, the Court can adopt an interim plan, preventing indefinite delay.

**Outcome:** Delays are time-limited and can be resolved by judicial intervention,
ensuring a map is in place for elections.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Judicial reluctance to intervene** | Medium | Explicit judicial review authority; clear criteria for review. |
| **Subtle partisan bias in applicant pool** | Medium | Diverse composition of the applicant review panel; public transparency of the pool. |
| **Commission gridlock** | Low | Odd number of members (9) reduces tie votes; clear deadlines. |
| **Lack of public engagement** | Low | Extensive public hearing and comment requirements; public education initiatives. |
