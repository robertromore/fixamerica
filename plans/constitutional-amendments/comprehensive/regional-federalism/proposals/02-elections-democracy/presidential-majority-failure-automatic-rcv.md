# Presidential Majority Failure: Automatic RCV/Runoff

This proposal replaces the "Congress provides a mechanism" placeholder with an
automatic, constitutionalized resolution when no presidential candidate
receives a majority of votes cast.

---

## Recommendation (Default)

Use automatic national ranked-choice voting (RCV) as the default presidential
ballot method. This prevents majority-failure outcomes without a second election
and removes a partisan choke point at the highest legitimacy moment.

---

## Draft Constitutional Language (Concept)

When no candidate receives a majority of votes cast in the presidential
contest, the result shall be determined by a national ranked-choice tabulation
conducted automatically under uniform rules established by this Constitution.

If ranked-choice tabulation is unavailable due to certified administrative
failure, a one-time top-two national runoff shall be held within 21 days under
the same certification and caretaker rules.

Congress shall not alter this mechanism by statute.

## Why RCV Over Runoff

- One election avoids turnout drop-off and interregnum risk.
- Fewer opportunities for manipulation or strategic delay.
- Consistent with "law moves automatically" design principle.

---

## Implementation Notes

- Requires ballot format and tabulation rules to be fixed in advance.
- Regional election authorities administer under federal procedural floors.
- Tie-breaking remains as specified for exact national ties.
