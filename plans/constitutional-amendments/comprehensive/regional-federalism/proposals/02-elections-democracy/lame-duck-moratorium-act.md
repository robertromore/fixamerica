# Lame Duck Moratorium Act

This proposal establishes the statutory framework for the "lame duck" moratorium
referenced in the [Constitutional Transition Act](../01-foundations/constitutional-transition-act.md),
providing detailed procedures to prevent the outgoing government from sabotaging
the new constitutional order after the first elections have occurred but before
the new government is activated.

---

## Constitutional Foundation

This Act is an implementing statute for the [Constitutional Transition Act](../01-foundations/constitutional-transition-act.md),
specifically operationalizing the "Lame Duck Sabotage" countermeasure in its
Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test section. It is designed to ensure a stable
and orderly transfer of power during the unique circumstances of the first
constitutional transition.

---

## Purpose

Establish a Lame Duck Moratorium that:

- prevents the outgoing government from making irreversible policy or
    personnel changes after its successors have been elected,
- ensures the incoming government inherits a stable and predictable
    institutional landscape,
- protects the democratic will expressed in the first elections under the
    new constitution, and
- provides clear rules for essential governance during the transition period.

## Part I: General Provisions

### Section 1. Definitions

(b) **Outgoing Government.** The President, Congress, and executive agencies
operating under the pre-transition constitutional framework during the Lame
Duck Period.

(c) **Incoming Government.** The President-elect, Representatives-elect, and
Senators-elect chosen in the first federal elections.

Constitutional Transition Act.

### Section 2. Applicability

(a) During the Lame Duck Period, the outgoing Congress is barred from passing
any new legislation, except as provided in Section 12.

that would have the force of law.

### Section 12. Permitted Legislative Actions

(a) The outgoing Congress may pass:
    - (1) **Continuing Resolutions** necessary to maintain government funding
      at existing levels.
    - (2) **Emergency Appropriations** in response to a natural disaster or
      imminent threat to national security, but only with the written
      concurrence of the President-elect and a majority of the Transitional
      Commission.
    - (3) **Transition-Related Resolutions** necessary to facilitate the
      activation of the new government, upon recommendation of the

---

## Part III: Executive Moratorium

### Section 21. Prohibition on Major Appointments

(a) During the Lame Duck Period, the outgoing President is barred from making,
and the outgoing Senate is barred from confirming, any new appointments to:
    - (1) Any federal judicial position, including the Supreme Court.
    - (2) Any cabinet-level position.
    - (3) Any head of an independent agency.
    - (4) Any position requiring Senate confirmation.
    - (5) Any senior executive service position or other politically appointed
      position not filled through competitive merit-based processes, including
      but not limited to agency general counsels, policy advisors, and bureau heads.

(b) **Exception.** The President may appoint acting officials to fill vacancies
essential for government continuity, but such appointments expire automatically
on Activation Day.

### Section 22. Prohibition on Major Regulations

(a) During the Lame Duck Period, executive agencies are barred from issuing
any "major rule" as defined by the Congressional Review Act (a rule with an
annual economic impact of $100 million or more).

(b) **Exception.** An agency may issue a major rule if the head of the agency
and the Transitional Commission both certify in writing that the rule is
necessary to respond to an imminent threat to health, safety, or national
security. Any such rule shall have an automatic sunset of 180 days.

### Section 23. Prohibition on Pardons and Commutations

(a) During the Lame Duck Period, the outgoing President's power to grant
pardons and commutations for federal offenses is suspended for any offense
related to:
    - (1) The constitutional transition process.
    - (2) Efforts to obstruct or interfere with the 2024 election or its
      certification.
    - (3) Any investigation in which the President is a subject or target.

(b) This limitation is specific to the unique context of the constitutional
transition and does not set a precedent for the pardon power under the new
Constitution.

## Part IV: Enforcement

### Section 31. Void Ab Initio

(a) Any legislative act, appointment, regulation, or pardon issued in violation
of this Act is void ab initio (void from the beginning) and shall have no legal
force or effect.

### Section 32. Oversight

(a) The Transitional Commission shall monitor compliance with this Act.

(b) The Commission shall publicly report any identified violations to the
incoming government and the public within 24 hours.

### Section 33. Judicial Review

(a) The Federal Supreme Court shall have exclusive, original jurisdiction over
any legal challenges concerning compliance with this Act.

(b) The incoming government, any member of the incoming Congress, or any
Regional government shall have standing to bring an action.

(c) The Court shall hear and decide any such action on an expedited basis,
with a final ruling required within 14 days of filing.

---

## Part V: Enforcement Dynamics

### Section 41. Enforcement in Practice

(a) **Integrated Response.** The enforcement mechanisms in Part IV are designed to work in concert, creating a multi-layered response to non-compliance that combines automatic legal consequences with swift political and judicial action.

(b) **Automatic Invalidity.** Per Section 31, any action taken in violation of the moratorium is legally void from the outset. This provides a clear legal basis for the incoming government to immediately disregard or reverse the action without requiring new legislation or a court order.

(c) **Immediate Oversight and Public Pressure.** Per Section 32, the Transitional Commission's duty to publicly report violations within 24 hours ensures that non-compliance cannot be hidden. This public reporting is intended to strip the unlawful action of political legitimacy and provide the incoming government with the standing to publicly reject it.

(d) **Expedited Judicial Backstop.** Per Section 33, the availability of expedited, original jurisdiction in the Federal Supreme Court provides a definitive and rapid backstop. This mechanism is designed to resolve any legal ambiguity created by a non-compliant outgoing government within a 14-day period, preventing prolonged legal battles from destabilizing the transition.

(e) **Combined Effect.** The combined effect of these provisions is to make non-compliance a high-risk, low-reward strategy. An outgoing government attempting to ignore the moratorium would face immediate public exposure, automatic legal invalidity of its actions, and a swift, definitive adverse ruling from the highest court.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Redefining "Emergency"

**Attack:** The outgoing Congress declares a non-critical issue an "emergency"
to pass legislation.

**Countermeasure:**

- Emergency appropriations require written concurrence from the President-elect
    and the Transitional Commission (Section 12(a)(2)).
- This "dual key" requirement prevents unilateral emergency declarations.

**Outcome:** The outgoing government cannot manufacture an emergency pretext
without the consent of the incoming power structure.

---

### Attack Vector 2: "Midnight" Regulations

**Attack:** Agencies rush to finalize major regulations just before the Lame
Duck Period begins.

**Countermeasure:**

- While this Act applies *during* the Lame Duck Period, the Congressional
    Review Act allows the *new* Congress to overturn regulations finalized
    in the last 60 legislative days of the outgoing Congress.
- The incoming government can place a regulatory freeze on its first day.

**Outcome:** This Act, combined with existing tools, provides a strong check
on last-minute regulatory sabotage.

---

### Attack Vector 3: "Acting" Official Abuse

**Attack:** The outgoing President fills key positions with "acting" officials
who are loyalists intended to obstruct the new administration.

**Countermeasure:**

- All acting appointments made during the Lame Duck Period expire automatically
    on Activation Day (Section 21(b)).
- The new President can replace them immediately upon taking office.

**Outcome:** The use of acting officials cannot create permanent obstruction.
