# Elections Implementation Act

This proposal establishes the statutory framework for the constitutional
provisions on federal elections (Article VII), providing detailed procedures
for voter registration, voting access, tabulation, and certification under
Regional administration with federal oversight.

---

## Constitutional Foundation

Article VII of the Regional Federal Constitution establishes that:

> Federal elections shall be administered by Regions pursuant to uniform
> procedural floors established by federal law. The Independent Election
> Commission shall oversee compliance and certify final results.

This Act implements these principles through specific procedures.

---

## Purpose

Establish federal election procedures that:

- create uniform procedural floors for all federal elections,
- clarify Regional administration responsibilities and federal oversight,
- ensure secure, transparent, and accessible voting for all eligible citizens,
- define the role of the Independent Election Commission (IEC) in setting
    standards and certifying results, and
- standardize tabulation, auditing, and recount procedures.

Commission (IEC), shall set binding procedural floors, provide funding, and

## Part V: Oversight and Enforcement

### Section 41. IEC Authority

    federal elections;
- (2) conduct audits of Regional election administration to ensure compliance;
- (3) issue corrective action plans to non-compliant Regions;

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Regional Non-Compliance

**Attack:** A Region refuses to implement federal standards, claiming "Regional
sovereignty" over elections.

**Countermeasure:**

- **IEC Enforcement Authority (Section 41):** The IEC can issue binding orders
    and corrective action plans.
- **Conditional Funding (Section 42):** Federal election funds are tied to
    compliance.
- **Federal Judicial Review (Section 43):** The IEC or aggrieved citizens can
    sue for enforcement in federal court.

**Outcome:** Non-compliance results in loss of funding and federal court orders,
making sustained defiance difficult and costly.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Malicious Compliance

**Attack:** A Region technically complies with standards but implements them in
a way designed to suppress votes (e.g., placing the minimum number of drop boxes
in inconvenient locations).

**Countermeasure:**

- **IEC Rulemaking Authority (Section 41):** The IEC can issue clarifying
    regulations to close loopholes (e.g., requiring equitable distribution of
    drop boxes).
- **Judicial Review for Disparate Impact:** Aggrieved parties can sue, arguing
    the implementation has a discriminatory effect.
- **Public Reporting:** IEC audits and public data expose malicious practices.

**Outcome:** While some gaming is possible, the IEC has authority to adapt, and
courts provide a backstop against discriminatory effects.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Certification Delay

**Attack:** A Region's officials refuse to certify election results by the
deadline to create chaos or allow for political interference.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Strict Deadlines (Section 32):** Regional certification is required within
    14 days.
- **IEC Contingency Authority (Section 32(c)):** If a Region fails to certify,
    the IEC is empowered to certify the federal results for that Region using
    precinct-level data.

**Outcome:** Regional obstruction cannot prevent the finalization of federal
election results.

---

### Attack Vector 4: IEC Capture

**Attack:** A partisan majority captures the IEC and uses its rulemaking authority
to favor one party.

**Countermeasure:**

- **IEC Composition:** The [Independent Election Commission Act](independent-election-commission-act.md)
    establishes an independent appointment process with staggered terms and
    diverse appointing authorities to prevent capture.
- **Judicial Review:** All IEC regulations are subject to judicial review to
    ensure they are consistent with the Act and the Constitution.

**Outcome:** Capture is structurally difficult; biased rules can be challenged
and overturned in court.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Disinformation Campaigns** | High | This Act focuses on procedure, not content. Other mechanisms (e.g., media literacy, platform accountability) are needed. |
| **Physical Security of Election Workers** | Medium | Criminal penalties (Section 44) provide a deterrent, but physical protection requires coordination with law enforcement. |
| **Coordinated Multi-Region Defiance** | Medium | Federal enforcement can address individual Regions, but a coordinated rebellion would pose a systemic crisis requiring de-escalation procedures. |
| **Resource Gaps** | Low | Federal funding is mandated, but appropriations battles could still occur. |
