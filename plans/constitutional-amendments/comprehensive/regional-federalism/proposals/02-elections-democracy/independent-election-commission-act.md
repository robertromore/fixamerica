# Independent Election Commission Act

This proposal establishes the statutory framework for the Independent Election
Commission (IEC), a body crucial for administering federal referendums,
certifying election results, and overseeing programs like the Civic Engagement
Vouchers.

---

## Constitutional Foundation

The Regional Federal Constitution implicitly mandates an Independent Election
Commission through references in:

- [DLRS (Dual Legitimacy Rights Floor Statute)](dual-legitimacy-rights-floor-statute.md)
    (Sections 3.4(a), 3.7(a), 3.12(d), 3.16(e), 3.17(b), 3.24(a), 3.26(a), 3.27(c))
- [Regional Governance: Constitutional Default Template](regional-governance-default-template.md)
    (Section 4.2(a)(2) - for election security)
- [Presidential Majority Failure: Automatic RCV/Runoff](presidential-majority-failure-automatic-rcv.md)
    (for national ranked-choice tabulation)

This Act implements these constitutional mandates through specific procedures.

## Purpose

Establish an Independent Election Commission that:

- ensures fair, transparent, and non-partisan administration of federal
    referendums and related election programs;
- provides objective certification of national election results;
- acts as a neutral arbiter for election-related disputes within its scope;
- protects against partisan manipulation of election processes; and
- administers programs designed to enhance civic engagement.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Commission Capture

**Attack:** A President or congressional majority attempts to pack the Commission
with partisan appointees to manipulate election outcomes or program administration.

**Countermeasure:**

- Seven-member, single seven-year staggered terms (Section 2(a))
- Multiple appointing authorities (President, Speaker, Senate Leaders, Chief Justice) (Section 3)
- Party balance requirement (Section 3(d))
- Ten-year disqualification for partisan activity (Section 5(a))
- Removal only for cause by two-thirds Senate vote (Section 2(b))

**Outcome:** Capturing the Commission requires sustained control of multiple
appointing authorities over many years; single-election swings cannot pack
the Commission.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Administrative Sabotage

**Attack:** A hostile administration attempts to undermine the Commission by
delaying appointments, underfunding its budget, or obstructing its operations.

**Countermeasure:**

- Mandatory budget appropriation with inflation floor (Section 21)
- Clear deadlines for Commission duties (e.g., DLRS certification, voucher issuance)
- Judicial review for failure to act (Section 23)
- Vacancy filling procedures (Section 2(d))

**Outcome:** Administrative sabotage is legally challengeable and difficult to
sustain without violating statutory mandates.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Partisan Bias in Neutrality Determinations

**Attack:** The Commission makes biased determinations on ballot language,
DLRS substantial similarity, or candidate/news organization qualification.

**Countermeasure:**

- Explicit neutrality requirements for ballot language (Section 11(b))
- Objective criteria for DLRS substantial similarity (DLRS Section 3.7(d))
- Strict eligibility criteria for voucher participants (Civic Engagement Vouchers Act Titles III & IV)
- Judicial review of Commission decisions (Section 23)
- Transparency requirements for decisions and findings (Section 22)

**Outcome:** Biased decisions are subject to objective criteria and judicial
oversight, making systematic partisan bias difficult to maintain.

### Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Coordinated capture across all appointing authorities** | Critical | Beyond this Act; general constitutional safeguards apply |
| **Partisan gridlock on appointments** | Medium | Interim appointments by Chief Justice; default rules apply |
| **Judicial reluctance to intervene** | Medium | Mandatory jurisdiction for election challenges |
| **Underfunding by Congress (despite mandatory status)** | Low | Judicial enforcement of mandatory appropriation; public pressure |
