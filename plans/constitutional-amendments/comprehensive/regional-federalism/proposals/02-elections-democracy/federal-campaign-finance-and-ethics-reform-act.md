# Federal Campaign Finance and Ethics Reform Act

This proposal establishes a comprehensive framework to reduce the influence of large donors in federal elections, increase transparency, and establish stricter ethics rules for federal officials to combat corruption and increase public trust.

---

## Purpose

Establish a Federal Campaign Finance and Ethics Reform Act that:

- Creates a voluntary public financing system for federal elections to empower small-dollar donors.
- Mandates the disclosure of major donors to "dark money" groups engaged in electioneering.
- Establishes strict ethics rules for federal officials, including a ban on trading individual stocks.
- Strengthens enforcement mechanisms for campaign finance and ethics laws.

## Part I: Federal Public Financing System

### Section 1. Establishment of the "Fair Elections Fund"

(a) There is established in the Treasury a "Fair Elections Fund" to provide public financing for candidates in federal elections (President, Senate, House).

(b) The Fund shall be administered by the Independent Election Commission (IEC).

### Section 2. Voluntary Participation

(a) Candidates for federal office may voluntarily opt into the public financing system.

(b) As a condition of participation, candidates must agree to:
    - (1) Forgo all private contributions over $200 per individual per election.
    - (2) Adhere to overall spending caps established by the IEC for the primary and general elections.

### Section 3. Small-Dollar Matching

(a) For participating candidates, the Fair Elections Fund shall provide a **6-to-1 match** for all individual contributions up to $200.

(b) A $50 donation from an individual would thus result in $300 in matching funds, for a total of $350 for the campaign.

### Section 4. Eligibility

(a) To qualify for public financing, candidates must first demonstrate broad public support by raising a threshold amount of qualifying small-dollar contributions, as determined by the IEC for each office.

---

## Part II: Transparency and Disclosure

### Section 11. Disclosure of "Dark Money"

(a) Any corporation, union, non-profit organization, or similar group that spends over $10,000 in a calendar year on electioneering communications shall disclose to the IEC all donors who contributed $1,000 or more during that year.

(b) "Electioneering communication" includes any broadcast, cable, satellite, or digital communication that refers to a clearly identified federal candidate and is publicly distributed within 60 days of a general election or 30 days of a primary.

### Section 12. Strengthened Anti-Coordination Rules

(a) The IEC shall establish bright-line rules prohibiting coordination between candidate campaigns and independent expenditure groups.

(b) Prohibited coordination includes, but is not limited to, sharing strategic information, co-mingling staff or vendors, and joint fundraising efforts.

### Section 13. Digital Ad Transparency

(a) Online platforms covered by the `Social Media Platform Accountability Act` must maintain a public, searchable database of all political and issue advertisements, including the identity of the purchaser, cost, targeting criteria, and reach.

---

## Part III: Ethics and Conflicts of Interest

### Section 21. Ban on Individual Stock Trading

(a) Members of Congress, the President, the Vice President, and senior executive branch officials are prohibited from owning or trading individual stocks, bonds, commodities, or other securities.

(b) Covered officials must, within 90 days of taking office, either:
    - (1) Divest such assets.
    - (2) Place such assets into a qualified blind trust approved by the Office of Government Ethics.

(c) This prohibition does not apply to diversified mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, or U.S. Treasury bonds.

### Section 22. Lobbying Ban

(a) A lifetime ban is imposed on former members of Congress and senior executive officials from lobbying their former agency or chamber of Congress.

### Section 23. Strengthening the Office of Government Ethics (OGE)

(a) The Office of Government Ethics (OGE) is granted independent rulemaking and enforcement authority, including the ability to levy fines for ethics violations.

(b) The Director of the OGE shall be appointed for a single 10-year term and may be removed by the President only for cause, consistent with the `Federal Civil Service Modernization Act`.

---

## Part IV: Oversight and Enforcement

### Section 31. Independent Election Commission (IEC) Role

(a) The IEC shall administer the Fair Elections Fund (Part I) and oversee all disclosure and anti-coordination requirements (Part II).

(b) The IEC is authorized to conduct audits and investigations and to levy civil penalties for violations of campaign finance law.

### Section 32. Office of Government Ethics (OGE) Role

(a) The OGE shall oversee and enforce the ethics and conflict of interest rules under Part III of this Act.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Mass Opt-Out of Public Financing

**Attack:** Most incumbent candidates opt-out of the public financing system to maintain their ability to raise large sums from wealthy donors and PACs.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Challenger Competitiveness:** The 6-to-1 small-dollar match makes challengers who opt-in instantly competitive, even against incumbents with large war chests.
- **Disclosure Applies to All:** The "dark money" and digital ad transparency rules in Part II apply to all groups, increasing the political cost of being funded by special interests.
- **Voter Vouchers:** The `Civic Engagement Vouchers Act` provides an additional source of small-dollar funding, further empowering publicly financed candidates.

**Outcome:** While incumbents can opt-out, doing so creates a clear political contrast with challengers running on small-dollar donations, and the system is designed to make those challengers financially viable.

---

### Attack Vector 2: New "Dark Money" Loopholes

**Attack:** Lawyers and political operatives create new, complex corporate structures or non-profit arrangements to obscure the true source of funds for electioneering.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Focus on Spending, Not Structure:** Section 11 focuses on any group *spending* over the threshold, regardless of its tax status or corporate form.
- **IEC Rulemaking Authority:** The IEC is empowered to issue rules to adapt disclosure requirements to new evasion tactics.
- **Severe Penalties:** Willful and complex evasion schemes can be subject to severe financial penalties and potential criminal referral.

**Outcome:** While a cat-and-mouse game is inevitable, the law is structured to be adaptable and focuses on the act of spending, making it much harder to hide large-scale influence operations.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Weak Ethics Enforcement

**Attack:** The Office of Government Ethics is captured or underfunded, leading to lax enforcement of the stock trading and lobbying bans.

**Countermeasure:**

- **OGE Independence (Section 23):** The OGE Director is given a long, single term and for-cause removal protection, insulating the office from political pressure.
- **Bright-Line Rules:** The ban on stock trading is a simple, bright-line rule. Violations are easy to identify through public financial disclosures, making non-enforcement politically costly.
- **Public Scrutiny:** The lobbying ban is also a bright-line rule, and violations would be subject to intense public and media scrutiny.

**Outcome:** The combination of OGE independence and simple, enforceable rules makes it difficult to ignore violations without significant political backlash.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Issue Advocacy vs. Electioneering** | Medium | The line between issue ads and electioneering can be blurry. Requires clear IEC rulemaking and will be refined by judicial precedent. |
| **Candidate-Specific Super PACs** | Medium | The strengthened anti-coordination rules make it riskier, but proving illegal coordination remains challenging. |
| **Constitutional Challenges (Citizens United)** | High | This framework is designed to work within existing jurisprudence by being voluntary (public financing) and focused on disclosure. A future court could still strike down key provisions. |
