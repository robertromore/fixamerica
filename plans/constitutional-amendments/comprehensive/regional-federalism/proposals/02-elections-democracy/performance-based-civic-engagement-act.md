# Performance-Based Civic Engagement Incentives Act

This proposal establishes a framework for non-monetary incentives for voter participation and community engagement, aiming to create a positive feedback loop for civic activity and mitigate widespread voter apathy.

## Purpose

Establish a Performance-Based Civic Engagement Incentives Framework that:

- Creates positive, non-monetary incentives for high voter participation and community engagement.
- Fosters a culture of civic responsibility and collective action.
- Recognizes and rewards communities that demonstrate strong democratic health.
- Mitigates widespread voter apathy by highlighting the tangible benefits of engagement.

## Part I: Community Civic Recognition Program

### Section 1. Establishment

(a) There is established within the Federal Agency for Civic Engagement and Media Literacy (the "Agency") a "Community Civic Recognition Program" (the "Program").

(b) The Program shall annually recognize local government jurisdictions (e.g., municipalities, counties) that demonstrate exceptional levels of voter participation and civic engagement.

### Section 2. Recognition Criteria

(a) Recognition shall be based on objective, publicly available metrics, including:
    - (1) Voter turnout rates in federal and Regional elections (adjusted for demographics).
    - (2) Voter registration rates.
    - (3) Participation rates in local deliberative democracy initiatives (e.g., citizen assemblies, participatory budgeting).
    - (4) Volunteerism rates in public service activities.
    - (5) Engagement with local government processes (e.g., public meetings, comment periods).

(b) The Agency shall establish a transparent methodology for calculating and ranking communities based on these criteria.

### Section 3. Recognition and Benefits

(a) "Civic Engagement Champion" communities shall receive:
    - (1) Public recognition from the President and Congress.
    - (2) Preferential access to federal community development grants and infrastructure funding (e.g., a 5% bonus in grant scoring).
    - (3) Technical assistance from federal agencies for local governance improvements.

## Part II: Regional Civic Engagement Grants

### Section 11. Establishment of Grant Program

(a) The Agency shall administer a "Regional Civic Engagement Grant Program" to provide funding to Regions that implement innovative programs to boost civic participation.

(b) There is authorized to be appropriated $150,000,000 for each fiscal year for this Program.

### Section 12. Grant Criteria

(a) Grants shall be awarded to Regions based on proposals that demonstrate:
    - (1) Innovative strategies to increase voter participation and civic engagement.
    - (2) Measurable objectives and evaluation plans.
    - (3) Focus on underserved populations or communities with historically low engagement.
    - (4) Non-partisanship and adherence to democratic principles.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Bias in Recognition Criteria

**Attack:** Political actors attempt to manipulate recognition criteria to favor communities aligned with their party, or to disadvantage others.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Objective Metrics:** Section 2(a) mandates objective, publicly available metrics, reducing subjective judgment.
- **Transparent Methodology:** Section 2(b) requires a transparent methodology for ranking, allowing public scrutiny.
- **IEC Independence:** The IEC's independent composition (established by the Independent Election Commission Act) protects against partisan capture of the recognition process.
-   **Agency Independence:** The Agency's independent status protects against partisan capture.
-   **Judicial Review:** Agency decisions on recognition and grant awards are subject to federal judicial review for abuse of discretion.

**Outcome:** The reliance on objective metrics, transparent methodology, and independent oversight makes it difficult to systematically inject partisan bias into the recognition process.

---

### Attack Vector 2: "Participation Washing"

**Attack:** Communities engage in superficial or performative civic activities solely to qualify for recognition or grants, without genuine increases in engagement.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Outcome-Based Metrics:** Section 2(a) emphasizes metrics like voter turnout and registration rates, which are difficult to fake.
- **Diverse Criteria:** The combination of multiple criteria (turnout, registration, deliberative participation, volunteerism) makes it harder to game a single metric.
- **Evaluation and Audits:** Grant programs require measurable objectives and evaluation plans, with potential for IEC audits.
-   **Evaluation and Audits:** Grant programs require measurable objectives and evaluation plans, with potential for Agency audits.

**Outcome:** While some performative actions are possible, the focus on measurable outcomes and diverse criteria makes it difficult to achieve recognition without genuine increases in civic engagement.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Funding Cuts and Program Sabotage

**Attack:** A hostile administration or Congress attempts to defund or administratively sabotage the incentive programs.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Mandatory Appropriation:** The Act could specify that Program funding is a mandatory appropriation, insulated from discretionary cuts.
- **IEC Independence:** The IEC's independent status protects it from direct executive interference in program administration.
-   **Agency Independence:** The Agency's independent status protects it from direct executive interference.
- **Broad Public Support:** The Program's focus on rewarding civic excellence can garner broad public support, making defunding politically costly.

**Outcome:** While political pressure is possible, direct defunding or sabotage is made more difficult by the Program's independent administration.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Disparities in community capacity to engage** | Medium | Provide technical assistance and capacity-building grants to underserved communities; adjust metrics for socioeconomic factors. |
| **Focus on quantity over quality of engagement** | Low | Integrate qualitative assessments of deliberative processes and community impact into recognition criteria. |
| **Perception of "buying" civic engagement** | Medium | Emphasize non-monetary recognition and the intrinsic value of civic participation; frame grants as capacity-building. |
