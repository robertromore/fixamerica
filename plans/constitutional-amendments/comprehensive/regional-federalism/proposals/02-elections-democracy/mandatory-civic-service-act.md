# Mandatory Civic Service and Education Act

This proposal establishes a national and regional program of mandatory, non-military civic service or enhanced civic education requirements, designed to foster a stronger sense of civic duty and understanding of democratic processes, thereby mitigating widespread voter apathy.

## Purpose

Establish a Mandatory Civic Service and Education Program that:

- Fosters a stronger sense of civic duty, community engagement, and democratic understanding among young adults.
- Provides valuable public services at local, Regional, and federal levels.
- Integrates civic education with practical experience in democratic processes.
- Mitigates widespread voter apathy by increasing personal investment in the functioning of democracy.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Coercion Claims and Individual Liberty

**Attack:** Opponents claim mandatory civic service infringes on individual liberty and constitutes involuntary servitude.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Non-Military Focus:** Section 2(a) explicitly limits service to non-military options, distinguishing it from conscription.
-   **Choice of Service:** Participants have a range of choices, allowing for personal preference and skill alignment.
-   **Educational Benefits:** The Program is framed as an investment in civic education and personal development, with tangible benefits (stipend, education voucher).
-   **Constitutional Challenge:** The Act would be designed to withstand constitutional challenge by emphasizing its educational and public service nature, similar to jury duty or compulsory education.

**Outcome:** While individual liberty concerns are legitimate, the non-military, choice-based, and benefit-oriented structure of the Program, coupled with its public service mission, provides strong arguments against claims of involuntary servitude.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Program Capture or Partisan Bias

**Attack:** Political actors attempt to capture the Program to indoctrinate participants with partisan ideologies or use service placements for political ends.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Agency Oversight:** The Federal Agency for Civic Engagement and Media Literacy is an independent body that protects against partisan capture of program administration.
-   **Strict Non-Partisanship:** All civic education curricula and service placements are mandated to be strictly non-partisan and objective.
-   **Diverse Service Options:** The wide range of service options (Section 2(a)) makes it difficult to uniformly impose a single partisan agenda.
-   **Public Reporting:** Annual reports to Congress and the public (Section 13(a) of Federal Digital Literacy Act, applicable here) ensure transparency and accountability.

**Outcome:** The independent oversight, non-partisanship mandate, and diversity of service options make it difficult to systematically inject partisan bias or use the Program for political indoctrination.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Funding Cuts and Administrative Sabotage

**Attack:** A hostile administration or Congress attempts to defund or administratively sabotage the Program.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Mandatory Appropriation:** The Act could specify that Program funding is a mandatory appropriation, insulated from discretionary cuts.
-   **Broad Public Support:** The Program's focus on public service and civic development can garner broad public support, making defunding politically costly.
-   **IEC Independence:** The IEC's independent status protects it from direct executive interference in program administration.
-   **Agency Independence:** The Agency's independent status protects it from direct executive interference.

**Outcome:** While political pressure is possible, direct defunding or sabotage is made more difficult by the Program's independent administration.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Logistical complexity of national mandatory service** | High | Phased implementation; pilot programs; robust federal-Regional coordination; leverage existing service organizations. |
| **Ensuring quality and meaningfulness of service placements** | Medium | Strict program standards; regular evaluation of placements; participant feedback mechanisms; diverse advisory board. |
| **Resistance from educational institutions to curriculum mandates** | Medium | Provide ample funding and resources for curriculum development and teacher training; emphasize flexibility in implementation. |
