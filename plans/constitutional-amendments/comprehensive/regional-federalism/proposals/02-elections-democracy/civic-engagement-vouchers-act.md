## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Fraud and Collusion

**Attack:** A candidate's campaign staff pressures or pays voters to "donate" their vouchers, or harvests mail-in vouchers, undermining the principle of voluntary support.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Unique Identifiers (Section 203(b)):** Each voucher is tied to a specific voter.
- **Secure Portal and Affirmation (Section 501):** The online portal requires identity affirmation. Mail-in options would require a signature match.
- **Public Database (Section 601):** Unusual patterns of donation (e.g., hundreds of donations processed from a single IP address) would be detectable through public data and audits.
- **Stiff Penalties (Section 603):** Strong civil and criminal penalties for fraud act as a deterrent.

**Outcome:** While small-scale fraud is possible, large-scale, systematic fraud would be difficult to execute without detection and carries significant legal risk.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Partisan or "Fake" News Organizations

**Attack:** A partisan group creates a "news organization" that is, in reality, a propaganda outlet designed to funnel public funds to a political cause, circumventing campaign finance limits.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Strict Eligibility Criteria (Section 401):** Requires a primary purpose of original news, adherence to a public ethics code, and a prohibition on endorsing candidates.
- **Ineligibility Rules (Section 402):** Explicitly bars organizations controlled by political committees or lobbyists.
- **Commission Certification:** The Independent Election Commission acts as a neutral gatekeeper to vet applicants.
- **One-Year Operating History (Section 401(b)):** Prevents pop-up "news" sites from forming just before an election to exploit the system.

**Outcome:** The qualification criteria are designed to filter out bad-faith actors. While borderline cases will exist, the most flagrant attempts at abuse would be screened out.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Administrative Sabotage

**Attack:** A hostile Regional administration or a captured Commission attempts to undermine the program by delaying voucher issuance, slowing down redemption payments to starve campaigns of funds, or underfunding the Civic Engagement Fund.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Clear Deadlines:** The Act includes specific, non-discretionary deadlines for voucher issuance (Section 203(a)) and redemption (Section 502(b)).
- **Dedicated Fund (Section 202):** The Civic Engagement Fund is a separate, protected fund. The requirement for an appropriation sufficient to cover *all* potential redemptions prevents underfunding.
- **Judicial Review:** Failure to meet statutory deadlines is subject to legal challenge, where a court could issue a writ of mandamus to compel action.

**Outcome:** The program is designed with automatic, time-bound procedures that reduce administrative discretion and make sabotage difficult and legally challengeable.
