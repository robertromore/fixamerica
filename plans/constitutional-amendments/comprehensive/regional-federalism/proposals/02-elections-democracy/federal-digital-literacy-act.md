## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Funding Cuts and Sabotage

**Attack:** A hostile administration or Congress attempts to defund or sabotage the Program to maintain an environment conducive to disinformation.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Mandatory Appropriation:** The Act could specify that Program funding is a mandatory appropriation, insulated from discretionary cuts.
- **IEC Independence:** The IEC's independent status (established by the Independent Election Commission Act) protects it from direct executive interference.
- **Public Reporting:** Annual reports to Congress and the public create transparency and accountability for program effectiveness.

**Outcome:** While political pressure is possible, direct defunding or sabotage is made more difficult by the Program's independent administration and mandatory funding.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Partisan Curriculum or Content

**Attack:** Attempts are made to inject partisan bias or ideological content into digital literacy curricula, turning the Program into a propaganda tool.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Strict Non-Partisanship Mandate:** Section 12(a) explicitly requires strict non-partisanship and objectivity.
- **Advisory Board Diversity:** The Digital Literacy Advisory Board (Section 3(a)) with diverse expertise helps ensure balanced content.
- **Public Review:** Model curricula and educational resources could be subject to public review and comment periods.
- **Judicial Review:** Violations of the non-partisanship mandate could be subject to judicial review.

**Outcome:** The explicit non-partisanship mandate, diverse oversight, and public scrutiny make it difficult to systematically inject partisan bias without detection and challenge.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Program Capture by Tech Companies

**Attack:** Technology companies attempt to influence the Program's direction or content to serve their commercial interests or avoid accountability.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Independent Advisory Board:** The Advisory Board's composition prioritizes academic and civic expertise over industry representation.
- **Conflict of Interest Rules:** Strict conflict of interest rules for Advisory Board members and IEC staff involved in the Program.
- **Transparency in Partnerships:** All collaborations with technology companies are publicly disclosed.
- **Focus on Skills, Not Platforms:** Curricula emphasize general critical thinking skills applicable across platforms, rather than endorsing specific technologies.

**Outcome:** While industry engagement is valuable, safeguards are in place to prevent undue influence or commercial capture of the Program's educational mission.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Low public adoption/engagement** | Medium | Continuous public awareness campaigns; integration into existing educational structures. |
| **Rapid evolution of disinformation tactics** | Medium | Ongoing research and adaptive curriculum development; flexible funding for rapid response. |
| **Difficulty measuring long-term impact** | Low | Robust longitudinal studies and qualitative assessments of civic engagement. |
