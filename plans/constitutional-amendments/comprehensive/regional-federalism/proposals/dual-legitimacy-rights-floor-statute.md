This document defines a dual-legitimacy statutory process for setting and raising
rights floors without requiring a full constitutional amendment. The process
requires both national popular approval and regional consent, and is limited to
enumerated floor domains.

This proposal addresses [Gap 8 — Rights-Floor Content and Enforcement Detail](../04-meta/02-identified-gaps.md)
by providing a sub-constitutional pathway for floor content definition.

## Proposed Constitutional Clause

The following provisions would be incorporated as Article III, Section 4 of the
Regional Federal Constitution if this proposal is adopted.

3.1 Definition. A Dual-Legitimacy Rights-Floor Statute (DLRS) is a federal law
that sets minimum rights or protections within the enumerated floor domains in
Section 3.6. A DLRS may not set ceilings, preempt higher regional or state
standards, or reallocate powers beyond floors.

3.2 Floor and Ceiling Distinction. For purposes of this Section:
(a) A floor establishes a minimum standard that Regions and States must meet or
exceed.
(b) A ceiling restricts the ability of Regions or States to provide greater
protections, broader access, or more stringent standards than the DLRS mandates.
(c) A provision that mandates a specific method, excludes alternatives, or
prohibits stricter standards constitutes a ceiling and is beyond DLRS authority.
(d) A provision that establishes minimum access, minimum protections, or minimum
procedural safeguards while permitting Regions and States to exceed those
minimums constitutes a floor.

3.3 Initiation. A DLRS may be proposed by:
(a) a three-fifths vote of the House of Representatives; or
(b) two-thirds of Regional Legislatures acting jointly.

3.4 Dual Consent. A DLRS takes effect only upon:
(a) approval by a majority of votes cast in a national popular referendum,
administered by Regions pursuant to Article VII, Section 1, with results
certified by the Independent Election Commission; and
(b) ratification by two-thirds of Regions.

3.5 Regional Method (Hybrid). Each Region may ratify by either:
(a) Regional Legislature; or
(b) Regional Referendum.
Each Region must fix its chosen method by public law at least 12 months before
any DLRS proposal; no method changes may occur during an active ratification
window. If a Region has not fixed its ratification method at the time of
proposal, ratification shall require approval by both the Regional Legislature
and a Regional Referendum.

3.6 Ratification Window. Ratification must occur within two years of proposal.
If dual consent is not achieved, the DLRS fails.

3.7 Cooling-Off Period. A DLRS that fails ratification may not be re-proposed
in substantially similar form for 24 months following the close of the failed
ratification window.
(a) The Independent Election Commission shall determine substantial similarity
through a public notice-and-comment process.
(b) Upon receiving a new DLRS proposal, the Commission shall publish the
proposal and invite public comment for 30 days on whether it is substantially
similar to a failed proposal within the cooling-off period.
(c) The Commission shall issue a written determination with findings within 60
days of proposal submission.
(d) A proposal is substantially similar if it:
    (1) addresses the same floor domain;
    (2) for numerical standards: establishes floor standards that differ by less
    than 20 percent from the failed proposal's standards;
    (3) for non-numerical standards: establishes floor standards that are
    functionally equivalent or differ only in minor procedural details without
    changing the substantive protection provided; and
    (4) does not address materially different circumstances or evidence.
(e) The Commission's determination is subject to judicial review for abuse of
discretion within 30 days of publication.
(f) If no challenge is filed within 30 days, the determination is final.

3.8 Enumerated Floor Domains. DLRS authority is limited to:
(a) voting access and election process floors;
(b) due process and basic civil procedure floors;
(c) anti-discrimination and equal protection floors;
(d) labor rights and minimum safety floors; and
(e) public integrity and anti-corruption floors.
Additional domains require constitutional amendment.

3.9 Ratchet. Floors may be raised by DLRS. Floors may be lowered or suspended
only by constitutional amendment.

3.10 Judicial Review. Courts may review DLRS for:
(a) procedural compliance with this Section;
(b) domain scope—whether the DLRS falls within an enumerated floor domain;
(c) single-subject compliance under Section 3.11;
(d) ceiling conversion—whether any provision constitutes a ceiling under
Section 3.2; and
(e) conflict with other constitutional provisions.
All DLRS challenges are subject to mandatory jurisdiction and time-bound review
as defined in Article XIV.

3.11 Single Subject. Each DLRS shall address one floor domain only. A DLRS that
addresses multiple domains is void in its entirety.

3.12 Regional Ratification Duty. Each Region shall conduct its ratification
process within 18 months of proposal.
(a) If a Region fails to complete ratification within this period, the Region is
deemed to have abstained.
(b) Abstention counts neither for nor against the two-thirds threshold; the
threshold is calculated based on Regions that have ratified or rejected.
(c) If fewer than five Regions have ratified or rejected by the 18-month
deadline, the ratification window is extended by 6 months.
(d) The Independent Election Commission shall publish monthly compliance reports
on regional ratification progress beginning 6 months after proposal.

3.13 Emergency Non-Suspension. Rights floors established by DLRS may not be
suspended, waived, or diminished during any emergency declared under Article
XVII.
(a) Any emergency measure that conflicts with a DLRS floor is void to the extent
of the conflict.
(b) This prohibition applies regardless of the nature, scope, or duration of the
emergency.
(c) Courts shall have mandatory jurisdiction to hear claims that emergency
measures violate DLRS floors, with expedited review as provided in Article XIV.

3.14 DLRS Conflicts. Where two or more DLRS provisions conflict:
(a) the provision that provides greater protection to the individual prevails;
(b) if relative protection is indeterminate, the more recently ratified DLRS
prevails;
(c) courts shall construe DLRS provisions to harmonize where possible before
finding conflict;
(d) a finding of conflict does not invalidate either DLRS; it determines which
provision governs in the specific circumstance.

3.15 Pre-Ratification Review.
(a) No court may enjoin or invalidate a DLRS proposal before dual consent is
achieved.
(b) Pre-ratification challenges to DLRS proposals are not justiciable.
(c) Challenges to DLRS validity may be brought only after certification of dual
consent and only within 180 days of the effective date.
(d) A DLRS that has been in effect for more than 180 days without successful
challenge is presumptively valid; subsequent challenges must demonstrate clear
constitutional violation.

3.16 Timing of Dual Consent.
(a) The national referendum and regional ratification may proceed concurrently
or sequentially within the ratification window.
(b) Neither form of consent is contingent on the other being completed first.
(c) If one form of consent is achieved before the other, the achieved consent
remains valid for the duration of the ratification window.
(d) Certification of dual consent occurs when both requirements have been met,
regardless of sequence.
(e) The Independent Election Commission shall certify dual consent within 14
days of the later of the two consent events.

3.17 Proposal Limits.
(a) No more than three DLRS proposals may be placed on a national ballot in any
12-month period.
(b) If more than three proposals are pending, the Independent Election
Commission shall schedule them for successive referendum dates in order of
proposal date.
(c) This limitation does not extend the ratification window for delayed
proposals; proposals that cannot be scheduled within their ratification window
fail.
(d) Congress may by two-thirds vote waive this limitation for a specific
proposal upon finding exceptional circumstances.

3.18 Transition Period.
(a) No DLRS may be proposed until Phase V of the Constitutional Transition Act
is complete and full activation has occurred.
(b) During Phases III and IV, Congress may prepare draft DLRS for consideration
upon full activation; such drafts have no legal effect until formally proposed.
(c) The first DLRS proposals may be submitted beginning 90 days after Phase V
completion.
(d) Draft DLRS prepared during transition are not subject to the cooling-off
period provisions of Section 3.7.

3.19 Territorial Applicability.
(a) DLRS floors apply to the District of Columbia and incorporated territories.
(b) Unincorporated territories may opt in to DLRS coverage by resolution of
their legislature; such opt-in is irrevocable for the duration of the DLRS.
(c) Tribal nations are not subject to DLRS unless they consent by formal action
of their governing body; such consent may be withdrawn with 24 months notice.
(d) For purposes of regional ratification, territories assigned to Regions under
Article XX participate through their Region's ratification process.
(e) Nothing in this Section diminishes tribal sovereignty or self-governance
rights.

3.20 Standing.
(a) Any person subject to a DLRS floor standard has standing to challenge its
validity or seek its enforcement.
(b) Any Region or State has standing to challenge a DLRS on procedural or
domain-scope grounds.
(c) Standing is not limited by the political question doctrine; DLRS challenges
are justiciable.
(d) Organizational standing is permitted where members would have individual
standing.
(e) The responsible federal agency has standing to enforce DLRS against
non-compliant Regions or States.

3.21 DLRS Registry.
(a) The Independent Election Commission shall maintain a public DLRS Registry
containing:
    (1) all proposed, pending, ratified, and failed DLRS;
    (2) full text, ratification history, and effective dates;
    (3) indexed standard values and adjustment history;
    (4) compliance status by Region as certified under each DLRS.
(b) The Registry shall be publicly accessible online at no cost.
(c) Official DLRS text is the version in the Registry; any conflict with other
publications is resolved in favor of the Registry.
(d) The Registry shall be updated within 7 days of any change in status.

3.22 Interpretation.
(a) DLRS provisions shall be construed liberally to effectuate their protective
purpose.
(b) Ambiguities shall be resolved in favor of greater protection for
individuals.
(c) DLRS floors establish minimums, not optimal standards; higher standards are
presumptively valid.
(d) Legislative history and pre-referendum impact statements may be consulted
but are not dispositive.
(e) Subsequent DLRS in the same domain shall be construed to supplement, not
replace, prior DLRS unless explicit repeal language is included.

3.23 Amendment and Replacement.
(a) A DLRS may be amended to raise specific floor standards without replacing
the entire statute; such amendments require full dual consent under Section 3.4.
(b) A DLRS may be replaced by a subsequent DLRS in the same domain; the
replacement must explicitly identify provisions superseded.
(c) Implicit repeal is disfavored; courts shall harmonize overlapping DLRS where
possible under Section 3.14.
(d) Technical corrections (typographical errors, cross-reference updates,
formatting) may be made by concurrent resolution of Congress and two-thirds of
Regional Legislatures without referendum.
(e) Technical corrections may not alter substantive floor standards.

3.24 Turnout Disclosure.
(a) The Independent Election Commission shall publish, alongside referendum
results:
    (1) total votes cast;
    (2) turnout as percentage of registered voters;
    (3) turnout as percentage of voting-eligible population;
    (4) turnout compared to most recent federal election.
(b) Low turnout does not invalidate a DLRS that achieves majority approval under
Section 3.4(a).
(c) Congress may commission studies on turnout patterns but may not impose
retroactive turnout requirements.
(d) If turnout falls below 25 percent of voting-eligible population, the
Independent Election Commission shall include in its certification a notation of
low turnout and a recommendation for civic engagement measures.

3.25 Referendum Administration.
(a) National referendums under Section 3.4(a) shall be administered by Regions
pursuant to Article VII, Section 1.
(b) The federal government shall reimburse Regions for the reasonable costs of
DLRS referendum administration within 90 days of certification.
(c) DLRS referendums shall be scheduled to coincide with regularly scheduled
federal elections when practicable to minimize costs and maximize turnout.
(d) If a DLRS referendum cannot be scheduled with a federal election within the
ratification window, a standalone referendum date may be designated by the
Independent Election Commission.
(e) Referendum administration costs shall be appropriated from general revenues
and may not be charged against DLRS-specific funding.

3.26 Ballot Language.
(a) The Independent Election Commission shall prepare official ballot language
for each DLRS referendum.
(b) Ballot language shall:
    (1) summarize the DLRS in plain language not exceeding 150 words;
    (2) accurately describe the floor standards being established;
    (3) note that higher regional or state standards are permitted;
    (4) identify the floor domain addressed.
(c) Proposed ballot language shall be published for 30-day public comment before
finalization.
(d) Legal challenges to ballot language accuracy must be filed within 14 days of
finalization and resolved within 30 days.

(d) Nothing in this Section limits individual speech about DLRS proposals.
(e) Coordination between referendum campaigns and foreign actors is prohibited
and subject to penalties under federal election law.

3.28 Sunset Provisions.
(a) A DLRS may include a sunset provision specifying that particular floor
standards expire after a defined period.
(b) Sunset provisions must be explicit and specify:
    (1) which floor standards are subject to sunset;
    (2) the sunset date or triggering condition;
    (3) whether the sunset is automatic or requires affirmative action.
(c) When a sunset triggers, the affected floor standards cease to have effect;
this does not constitute lowering floors under Section 3.9.
(d) Floor standards that sunset may be re-established by a new DLRS without
triggering the cooling-off period of Section 3.7.
(e) Sunset provisions shall not exceed 15 years from effective date.
(f) Sunset provisions may not be added by technical correction; they must be
included in the original DLRS or added by amendment under Section 3.23.

3.29 External Standards References.
(a) A DLRS may incorporate external standards by reference only if:
    (1) the external standard is publicly available at no cost or at reasonable
    cost with public library access;
    (2) the reference specifies either a fixed version (static incorporation) or
    permits updates (dynamic incorporation);
    (3) the reference includes a floor fallback if the external standard is
    discontinued or becomes unavailable.
(b) Dynamic incorporation of external standards that would lower floors below
the original DLRS level is void; the prior floor level continues in effect.
(c) The DLRS Registry shall track incorporated external standards and their
current versions.
(d) The responsible federal agency shall notify Congress and Regional
Legislatures within 30 days if an incorporated external standard is materially
revised or discontinued.

3.30 Regional Boundary Changes.
(a) If a Region splits during a DLRS ratification window:
    (1) the original Region's ratification status applies to successor Regions
    until they independently act;
    (2) successor Regions may independently ratify or reject within 6 months of
    formal recognition as separate Regions.
(b) If Regions merge during a DLRS ratification window:
    (1) if both predecessor Regions ratified, the merged Region is deemed to
    have ratified;
    (2) if neither predecessor Region ratified, the merged Region is deemed not
    to have ratified;
    (3) if ratification status differed, the merged Region must affirmatively
    act within 6 months of merger.
(c) Boundary adjustments not affecting Regional identity do not alter
ratification status.
(d) For DLRS already in effect, boundary changes do not affect applicability;
DLRS floors apply to all territory within recognized Regions.

3.31 Minority Rights Protection.
(a) No DLRS floor standard shall be construed or applied to:
    (1) diminish existing constitutional protections for discrete and insular
    minorities;
    (2) authorize discrimination prohibited elsewhere in this Constitution;
    (3) prevent Regions from providing heightened protections to vulnerable
    populations.
(b) Courts reviewing DLRS challenges shall apply heightened scrutiny where a
floor standard is alleged to have disparate impact on constitutionally protected
groups.
(c) The pre-referendum impact statement shall include analysis of potential
disparate impacts on protected groups.
(d) If a court finds that a DLRS provision has unjustified disparate impact, it
may sever that provision while preserving the remainder of the DLRS.

3.32 Treaty Obligations.
(a) DLRS floor standards shall be construed consistently with binding treaty
obligations of the United States where possible.
(b) Where a treaty establishes a higher standard than a DLRS floor, the treaty
standard governs.
(c) Where a DLRS floor establishes a higher standard than a treaty minimum, the
DLRS floor governs domestically.
(d) Nothing in this Section affects the constitutional status of treaties or the
treaty-making power under Article II.
(e) A DLRS may not be used to circumvent treaty obligations or to effectively
withdraw from treaty commitments without following constitutional procedures.

## Domain Selection Rationale

The five enumerated floor domains (Section 3.8) were selected based on shared
characteristics that distinguish them from more contested policy areas.

### Why These Five Domains

**1. Voting Access and Election Process Floors**

- Protects structural democratic functioning
- Broad consensus that minimum access is appropriate
- Floor standards don't dictate electoral outcomes

**2. Due Process and Basic Civil Procedure Floors**

- Foundational to rule of law
- Historically uncontroversial as minimum standards
- Enables other rights to be vindicated

**3. Anti-Discrimination and Equal Protection Floors**

- Core constitutional values
- Floor protections don't prevent additional protections
- Consensus categories (race, religion, national origin) well-established

**4. Labor Rights and Minimum Safety Floors**

- Prevents competitive erosion of standards between Regions
- Protects basic economic dignity
- Long history of federal minimum standards

**5. Public Integrity and Anti-Corruption Floors**

- Essential to democratic legitimacy
- Benefits all political perspectives
- Prevents governance capture

### Why Other Domains Are Excluded

Domains where the floor/ceiling distinction is inherently contested are excluded:

| Domain | Reason for Exclusion |
|--------|---------------------|
| Bodily autonomy | Fundamental disagreement on whether floors restrict or protect |
| Firearms | Rights-based framing conflicts with safety-based framing |
| Privacy | Technology-dependent; rapid evolution makes floors unstable |
| Environmental | Regional variation in conditions makes uniform floors problematic |
| Healthcare access | Cost implications and scope make floor definition contested |

These domains require constitutional amendment to add to DLRS authority,
preserving the higher threshold for structurally contentious areas.

### Design Principle

The DLRS mechanism is designed for domains where:

- Minimum standards are broadly accepted as appropriate
- The floor/ceiling distinction is reasonably clear
- Regional variation above the floor is legitimate and expected
- Political conflict centers on floor content, not floor existence

For domains where the existence of a floor itself is contested, the full
constitutional amendment process (Article XIII) provides the appropriate
deliberation and consent threshold.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

Following the methodology established in
[Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test](../03-analysis/04-hostile-reinterpretation.md),
this section tests how bad-faith actors might attempt to abuse the DLRS
mechanism.

### Attack Vector 1: Strategic Regional Abstention

**Attack:** Regions opposed to a DLRS abstain rather than vote, hoping to
prevent the five-Region minimum threshold (Section 3.12(c)).

**Countermeasure:** Section 3.12 treats abstention as neutral—it doesn't count
against the two-thirds threshold. If fewer than five Regions participate, the
window extends by 6 months, increasing political pressure on abstaining Regions.

**Outcome:** Abstention cannot permanently block; it only delays and creates
political visibility.

---

### Attack Vector 2: IEC Capture to Block Re-Proposals

**Attack:** A captured IEC abuses "substantial similarity" determinations to
block legitimate proposals or allow gaming of the cooling-off period.

**Countermeasure:** Section 3.7 now includes:

- Public notice-and-comment process
- Objective criteria for substantial similarity (20% threshold for numerical standards; functional equivalence test for non-numerical standards)
- Written findings requirement
- Judicial review for abuse of discretion
- 30-day finality rule

**Outcome:** IEC determinations are transparent, bounded, and reviewable.
Capture requires sustained control plus willingness to issue indefensible
rulings.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Floor-as-Ceiling-in-Practice

**Attack:** A DLRS establishes floors so specific and detailed that meaningful
variation above the floor becomes practically impossible.

**Countermeasure:** Section 3.2 provides clear floor/ceiling distinction
criteria. Courts can sever provisions that function as ceilings (Section 3.10(d)).
The single-subject rule (Section 3.11) prevents packaging ceiling-like
provisions with popular floor provisions.

**Outcome:** Over-specification is judicially reviewable and severable.

---

### Attack Vector 4: Emergency Suspension

**Attack:** An executive declares emergency and suspends DLRS floors, claiming
national security or public safety necessity.

**Countermeasure:** Section 3.13 explicitly prohibits suspension regardless of
emergency nature, scope, or duration. Courts have mandatory jurisdiction to
enforce this prohibition.

**Outcome:** Emergency suspension is unconstitutional per se; no balancing test
applies.

---

### Attack Vector 5: Referendum Flooding

**Attack:** A faction proposes numerous DLRS to exhaust voters and create
referendum fatigue, then advances preferred proposals when turnout is low.

**Countermeasure:** Section 3.17 limits proposals to three per 12-month period.
Excess proposals are queued. The two-year ratification window means delayed
proposals may fail procedurally.

**Outcome:** Strategic flooding is constrained; each proposal must be
prioritized.

---

### Attack Vector 6: Pre-Ratification Court Injunction

**Attack:** A hostile court enjoins a popular DLRS proposal before ratification,
preventing the popular vote from occurring.

**Countermeasure:** Section 3.15 makes pre-ratification challenges non-
justiciable. Courts may only review after dual consent is certified.

**Outcome:** Judicial blocking of democratic process is structurally prevented.

---

### Attack Vector 7: Post-Ratification Delayed Challenges

**Attack:** Opponents wait until a DLRS has been implemented and relied upon,
then bring challenges to create disruption and uncertainty.

**Countermeasure:** Section 3.15(c) limits challenges to 180 days after
effective date. Section 3.15(d) creates presumptive validity after 180 days,
requiring demonstration of clear constitutional violation for later challenges.

**Outcome:** Reliance interests are protected; late challenges face heightened
standards.

---

### Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| Coordinated capture of IEC + courts + Regions | Critical | Beyond DLRS design; general constitutional safeguards apply |
| Low referendum turnout undermining legitimacy | Medium | Section 3.4 requires majority of votes cast, not registered voters |
| Domain boundary disputes | Medium | Section 3.10(b) provides judicial review for domain scope |
| Conflict between DLRS and future constitutional amendments | Low | Constitutional amendments supersede; DLRS must adapt |

---

### Summary

The DLRS mechanism has been designed with explicit countermeasures against
foreseeable abuse patterns. The most dangerous failure mode—coordinated
capture across multiple institutions—is not specific to DLRS and is addressed
by the general constitutional framework. The mechanism trades some speed and
simplicity for structural resilience against bad-faith actors.

## Appendix A: Model DLRS Examples

The following abbreviated examples illustrate how the DLRS framework applies to
each enumerated floor domain. These are illustrative only and do not constitute
proposed legislation.

### A.1 Voting Access Rights-Floor Act (Model)

**Domain:** Voting access and election process floors (Section 3.8(a))

**Model Floor Standards:**

- Minimum 10 days of early voting before any federal or regional election
- Same-day voter registration available at all polling locations
- No voter identification requirement more restrictive than signature
  verification or attestation
- Minimum 12 hours of polling place operation on election day
- One polling location per 3,000 registered voters within each jurisdiction

**Indexing:** Early voting days indexed to voting-eligible population; if
population increases 20% from baseline, minimum increases by 2 days.

**Preservation:** Regions may offer more early voting days, additional
registration options, or more polling locations.

---

### A.2 Labor Rights-Floor Act (Model)

**Domain:** Labor rights and minimum safety floors (Section 3.8(d))

**Model Floor Standards:**

- Minimum wage set at 40% of regional median hourly wage, recalculated annually
- Minimum 5 days paid sick leave per year for all employees
- Workplace safety standards at OSHA 2025 baseline or successor federal standard
- Right to organize without employer interference
- Minimum 30-minute unpaid break for shifts exceeding 6 hours

**Indexing:** Minimum wage indexed to regional median wage; safety standards
indexed to current OSHA standards (dynamic incorporation with ratchet).

**Preservation:** Regions may set higher minimum wages, more sick leave, or
stricter safety standards.

---

### A.3 Due Process Rights-Floor Act (Model)

**Domain:** Due process and basic civil procedure floors (Section 3.8(b))

**Model Floor Standards:**

- Right to counsel in any proceeding where incarceration exceeding 30 days is
  possible
- Maximum 48 hours detention before judicial review (excluding weekends/holidays)
- Written notice of charges within 24 hours of arrest
- Right to appeal any criminal conviction to at least one appellate court
- Prohibition on civil asset forfeiture without criminal conviction

**Indexing:** Not applicable (non-numerical standards).

**Preservation:** Regions may provide counsel for additional proceeding types,
shorter detention limits, or broader forfeiture protections.

---

### A.4 Anti-Discrimination Rights-Floor Act (Model)

**Domain:** Anti-discrimination and equal protection floors (Section 3.8(c))

**Model Floor Standards:**

- Prohibition on discrimination in employment based on race, color, religion,
  sex, national origin, age, or disability
- Prohibition on discrimination in housing based on protected categories
- Prohibition on discrimination in public accommodations
- Reasonable accommodation requirement for disabilities in employment
- Equal pay for substantially similar work regardless of sex

**Indexing:** Not applicable (non-numerical standards).

**Preservation:** Regions may add protected categories, extend to additional
contexts, or strengthen remedies.

---

### A.5 Public Integrity Rights-Floor Act (Model)

**Domain:** Public integrity and anti-corruption floors (Section 3.8(e))

**Model Floor Standards:**

- Financial disclosure required for all elected officials and senior appointees
- Cooling-off period of 2 years before former officials may lobby their former
  agency
- Prohibition on gifts exceeding $50 from regulated entities to regulators
- Mandatory recusal for conflicts of interest exceeding $1,000 value
- Whistleblower protection for reports of waste, fraud, or abuse

**Indexing:** Gift and conflict thresholds indexed to CPI; cooling-off period
not indexed.

**Preservation:** Regions may require broader disclosure, longer cooling-off
periods, lower gift limits, or stronger whistleblower protections.

---

### Notes on Model Examples

These models demonstrate:

1. **Specificity:** Each floor standard is concrete and measurable
2. **Preservation clauses:** Each explicitly permits higher regional standards
3. **Indexing:** Numerical standards include indexing where appropriate
4. **Single domain:** Each addresses only one enumerated floor domain
5. **Floor not ceiling:** Standards set minimums without mandating methods

Actual DLRS proposals would include full statutory language following the
template in Title I-VII above.
