# Interregional Agency Compact Act

This proposal establishes a framework for Regions to create optional,
interregional agencies that perform shared administrative functions similar
to federal agencies, but only for Regions that opt in by compact.

These agencies are not federal entities and do not create a new branch of
government. They are joint instruments of the participating Regions,
operating within powers the Regions already possess.

---

## Constitutional Foundation

Article I, Section 5 of the Regional Federal Constitution authorizes
inter-regional cooperation by compact. This Act provides statutory defaults
for creating interregional agencies under that authority and aligns with the
default governance template in [Inter-Regional Joint Authority: Constitutional
Default Template](interregional-joint-authority-template.md).

If Article I, Section 5A (Inter-Regional Joint Authority Defaults) is adopted,
this Act serves as implementation guidance. If not adopted, this Act provides
statutory defaults that Regions may incorporate by reference.

---

## Purpose

Enable Regions to:

- pool administrative capacity for shared problems,
- align rules and standards across participating Regions,
- reduce duplication while preserving Regional sovereignty,
- and provide public services at scale without federalization.

---

## Part I: Authorization and Legal Status

### Section 1. Compact Authorization

(a) Two or more Regions may establish an interregional agency by compact to
exercise specified powers delegated by the participating Regions.

(b) An interregional agency compact takes effect only after public ratification
in each participating Region under that Region's authorized method for
inter-regional agreements.

(c) The compact shall be published in full at least 60 days before any
ratification vote.

(d) No interregional agency may be formed by executive action alone; legislative
or popular ratification is required in each participating Region.

---

### Section 2. Legal Status and Separation

(a) An interregional agency is a public instrumentality of the participating
Regions.

(b) An interregional agency is not a federal agency, does not exercise federal
powers, and does not constitute a new branch of the federal government.

(c) The agency exists only by compact and only within the scope of powers
delegated to it by all participating Regions.

---

### Section 3. Relationship to the Federal Government

(a) An interregional agency may coordinate with federal agencies, but may not
exercise federal powers absent explicit federal statutory delegation consistent
with enumerated federal authority.

(b) No federal delegation may expand the agency's powers beyond what the
participating Regions have delegated.

(c) Federal law remains supreme within its enumerated scope. Interregional
agency actions inconsistent with federal law are void to the extent of
inconsistency.

---

## Part II: Scope, Powers, and Limits

### Section 4. Permissible Functions

An interregional agency may be authorized to:

- set shared administrative standards for participating Regions,
- operate shared service platforms (licensing, procurement, inspection),
- manage shared infrastructure (transportation corridors, grids, waterways),
- administer pooled funds or grants among participating Regions,
- collect and publish regional data needed for compact operations,
- conduct inspections or audits for member Regions, and
- issue non-binding guidance or model rules for voluntary adoption by member
  Regions.

Non-binding guidance issued under this Section does not become binding through
incorporation by reference in Regional rules unless the Region expressly adopts
it through its ordinary rulemaking process.

---

### Section 5. Prohibited Powers

An interregional agency may not:

- impose taxes or fees except as unanimously approved by all participating
  Regions through their legislative processes or the same ratification method
  used to approve the compact,
- create criminal penalties or operate law enforcement agencies,
- exercise coercive police powers independent of member Regions,
- preempt or invalidate laws of non-participating Regions,
- enter treaties or binding international agreements,
- issue currency or assume sovereign debt without explicit Regional approval,
- expand its own powers without amended compact ratification by all
  participating Regions, or
- exercise powers reserved to the federal government.

---

## Part III: Governance and Accountability

### Section 6. Governance Defaults

(a) Unless the compact explicitly provides otherwise, governance shall follow
the default structure in Article I, Section 5A (Inter-Regional Joint Authority
Defaults), including:

- (1) equal representation per Region on the Governing Board (5A.3(a)),
- (2) quorum requirement (majority of total members) and voting rules (5A.3(b)),
- (3) dual concurrence voting for fiscal decisions (5A.3(b)(2)),
- (4) transparency requirements for meetings and votes (5A.3(c)),
- (5) dispute resolution procedures (5A.9),
- (6) withdrawal and dissolution procedures (5A.7, 5A.8),
- (7) emergency authority limits (5A.10),
- (8) personnel protections (5A.12), and
- (9) anti-capture provisions (5A.14).

(b) If Article I, Section 5A has not been adopted, the compact shall specify
governance procedures addressing each element listed in subsection (a). Failure
to specify any element renders the corresponding provisions of the
[Inter-Regional Joint Authority: Constitutional Default Template](interregional-joint-authority-template.md)
applicable to that element as statutory defaults.

(c) A compact may deviate from Section 5A defaults only by explicit provision
with public ratification. Deviations may not weaken transparency, audit, exit,
or anti-capture protections below Section 5A standards.

---

### Section 7. Budget and Finance

(a) Annual budgets require approval by the governing board and ratification by
each participating Region's legislature (or public vote if required).

(b) Cost-sharing formulas must be published in the compact and revalidated at
least every five years. The default allocation, absent agreement, is
population-weighted.

(c) Interregional agencies may not incur debt, issue bonds, or guarantee
obligations without explicit approval by each participating Regional
Legislature. Debt instruments shall specify the proportional liability of each
Region.

(d) Interregional agencies shall use generally accepted governmental accounting
standards.

---

### Section 7A. Audit Requirements

(a) Interregional agencies shall undergo annual financial audit by an
independent auditor selected by unanimous consent of participating Regions. If
unanimous consent cannot be reached within 60 days of the selection deadline,
the Allocation Review Board shall appoint the auditor from a list of qualified
firms.

(b) Auditor selection shall rotate among qualified firms; no firm may serve more
than three consecutive years.

(c) Audit reports shall be published within 120 days of fiscal year end.

(d) Audit reports shall be transmitted to each participating Regional
Legislature and made available to the public.

---

### Section 8. Transparency and Public Reporting

(a) Board meetings must be public with at least 14 days advance notice and
recorded votes. Meeting notices shall include the agenda and any materials to be
considered.

(b) Minutes and voting records shall be published within 14 days of each
meeting.

(c) Executive sessions are permitted only for personnel matters, pending
litigation, or security-sensitive infrastructure; all votes must occur in public
session.

(d) The agency shall publish quarterly performance reports and an annual public
impact report covering outcomes, costs, and compliance.

---

## Part IV: Membership, Opt-In, and Exit

### Section 9. Opt-In Membership

(a) Only Regions that ratify the compact are bound by the agency's rules or
standards.

(b) Non-participating Regions may contract with the agency for services but
shall not be bound by agency rules absent ratification.

---

### Section 10. Withdrawal

(a) A participating Region may withdraw with 18 months written notice to all
other participating Regions and to the Governing Board.

(b) The withdrawing Region shall:

- (1) continue to meet its fiscal obligations through the end of the current
  fiscal year or the notice period, whichever is longer;
- (2) participate in good-faith negotiations regarding transition arrangements;
  and
- (3) not obstruct agency operations during the notice period.

(c) Upon withdrawal, the withdrawing Region is entitled to its proportional
share of liquid assets based on the cost allocation formula.

(d) The withdrawing Region remains liable for its proportional share of
outstanding debt and contractual obligations incurred before notice of
withdrawal.

- (1) may be transferred to the withdrawing Region at appraised value, OR
- (2) may remain under agency control with negotiated access terms.

(f) If the parties cannot agree on asset and liability settlement within 12
months of the notice date, binding arbitration applies under Section 11A.

(g) Withdrawal does not dissolve the agency unless the number of remaining
Regions falls below two.

---

### Section 10A. Dissolution

(a) Voluntary dissolution requires:

- (1) approval by two-thirds of the Governing Board, AND
- (2) ratification by a majority of participating Regions representing at least
  60% of the combined population.

Challenges to discretionary decisions are reviewed for abuse of discretion.

---

### Section 11A. Dispute Resolution

(a) Disputes between participating Regions or between a Region and the agency
shall be resolved through the following tiered process:

- (1) **Negotiation:** 30 days of good-faith direct negotiation.
- (2) **Mediation:** If negotiation fails, 45 days of mediation by a mediator
  jointly selected by the parties or, failing agreement, appointed by the
  Allocation Review Board.
- (3) **Binding Arbitration:** If mediation fails, binding arbitration by a
  three-member panel (one selected by each disputing party, third selected by
  those two).

---

### Section 12. Sunset and Reauthorization

(a) Every interregional agency shall be subject to periodic sunset review at
intervals not exceeding ten years.

(b) Each participating Region shall vote on continuation. Regions that ratify
continuation remain participants; Regions that do not ratify are treated as
having given withdrawal notice effective on the sunset date.

---

## Part VII: Transition for Existing Compacts

### Section 17. Treatment of Existing Interstate Compacts

(a) Interstate compacts in effect at the time of Regional Federalism ratification:

- (1) remain in effect unless inconsistent with the Regional Federal
  Constitution,
- (2) are encouraged but not required to conform to this Act, and
- (3) shall comply with transparency and audit requirements of Sections 7A and 8
  within three years of ratification.

(b) Existing compacts may be converted to interregional agencies under this Act
by agreement of all participating states/Regions and re-ratification under
regional procedures.

(c) Nothing in this Act requires dissolution of existing compacts that do not
conform to this Act, provided they do not violate other constitutional
provisions.

(d) Upon conversion, existing compact employees shall be offered positions with
the interregional agency at equivalent grade and salary, with service credit for
prior compact employment.

---

## Part VIII: Example Use Cases (Non-Binding)

Potential interregional agencies include:

- Regional infrastructure permitting and corridor management,
- Cross-region environmental monitoring and enforcement coordination,
- Joint procurement for health stockpiles or emergency response,
- Regional professional licensing reciprocity clearinghouse,
- Shared data infrastructure for education and workforce mobility.

**Administrative Support:** Interregional agencies may contract with the
[Interregional Shared Services Authority](interregional-shared-services-authority-act.md)
for back-office functions including payroll, procurement, IT, and audit support,
reducing duplication across multiple agencies.

---

## Implementation Note

This Act is designed to be statutory, not constitutional. If the Regional
Federal Constitution already authorizes inter-regional compacts (Article I,
Section 5), no additional amendment is required. If clarity is needed, a short
enabling clause can be added to Article I, Section 5 to reference interregional
agencies explicitly.
