# Criminal Justice Coordination Framework

This proposal establishes mechanisms for criminal justice coordination beyond
the extradition and law enforcement cooperation provisions in Article I,
Section 11, addressing sentence portability, criminal records, supervision
transfer, and registry coordination.

This proposal addresses [Gap 31 — Criminal Justice Coordination Beyond Extradition](../04-meta/02-identified-gaps.md)
by creating federal enabling legislation and model inter-regional compacts.

---

## Constitutional Placement

This framework would be implemented through:

- **Interstate Criminal Justice Coordination Act** - Federal enabling legislation
- **Model Inter-Regional Compact** - Template for Regional adoption
- **Federal Databases** - National systems for coordination

No constitutional amendment is required; Article I, Section 11 provides the
constitutional foundation, and this framework fills implementation gaps.

---

## Purpose

Establish coordination mechanisms that:

- enable appropriate information sharing across Regional boundaries,
- prevent offenders from escaping supervision through relocation,
- protect privacy while enabling public safety,
- maintain Regional sentencing autonomy while allowing cooperation, and
- coordinate registries and notification systems.

---

## Part I: Criminal Records Coordination

### Section 1. National Criminal History System

(a) **Existing System Enhanced.** The FBI's National Crime Information Center
(NCIC) shall be enhanced to:

- (1) include all felony and serious misdemeanor convictions from all Regions;
- (2) standardize record formats across Regions;
- (3) provide authorized access to Regional law enforcement and courts;
- (4) include disposition data (not just arrests).

(b) **Regional Reporting Duty.** Each Region shall:

- (1) report all felony convictions to the national system within 30 days;
- (2) report all misdemeanor convictions involving violence, domestic abuse,
    weapons, or DUI within 30 days;
- (3) report dispositions (acquittals, dismissals) within 30 days;
- (4) update records upon expungement or sealing.

(c) **Standardized Format.** The Attorney General shall establish:

- (1) uniform data elements for criminal records;
- (2) unique identifier systems (not SSN-based);
- (3) data quality standards;
- (4) error correction procedures.

### Section 2. Access and Privacy

(a) **Authorized Access.** Criminal history information shall be available to:

- (1) law enforcement agencies for law enforcement purposes;
- (2) courts for sentencing, bail, and custody determinations;
- (3) corrections agencies for classification and release decisions;
- (4) licensing agencies where authorized by Regional law;
- (5) employers where authorized by Regional law.

(b) **Privacy Protections.** Criminal history information:

- (1) may not be used for purposes unrelated to public safety or authorized
    functions;
- (2) shall be secured against unauthorized access;
- (3) shall be subject to audit for appropriate use;
- (4) shall include procedures for individual challenge and correction.

(c) **Regional Law Governs Use.** Access to criminal history by private parties
(employers, landlords) is governed by the law of the Region where the inquiry
is made, not the Region of conviction.

### Section 3. Expungement and Sealing

(a) **Recognition of Expungement.** When a Region expunges or seals a record:

- (1) the national system shall reflect the sealed status;
- (2) other Regions shall respect the seal for most purposes;
- (3) sealed records may still be available to courts for sentencing in
    subsequent prosecutions.

(b) **No Automatic National Expungement.** Regional expungement does not require
other Regions to treat the offense as if it never occurred for all purposes;
Regions may retain sentencing enhancement authority.

(c) **Notification.** When records are expunged or sealed, the originating
Region shall notify the national system within 30 days.

---

## Part II: Sentence and Supervision Transfer

### Section 11. Interstate Compact for Supervision

(a) **Continuation.** The existing Interstate Compact for Adult Offender
Supervision (ICAOS) continues in effect and transfers to Regions.

(b) **Enhanced Provisions.** The compact shall be updated to address:

- (1) Regional (not state) membership;
- (2) electronic monitoring across boundaries;
- (3) uniform violation standards;
- (4) mandatory transfer for certain categories.

### Section 12. Mandatory Transfer Categories

(a) **Required Acceptance.** A Region must accept transfer of supervision for:

- (1) residents of that Region (domicile established before offense);
- (2) persons whose immediate family resides in that Region;
- (3) persons with verified employment in that Region.

(b) **Discretionary Acceptance.** A Region may accept transfer for:

- (1) other persons seeking to relocate;
- (2) persons with other ties to the Region.

(c) **Mandatory Reporting.** Transferred supervisees must:

- (1) report to the receiving Region within 7 days of arrival;
- (2) comply with receiving Region's supervision conditions;
- (3) remain subject to sending Region's sentence.

### Section 13. Violation Procedures

(a) **Local Violations.** If a supervisee violates conditions in the receiving
Region:

- (1) the receiving Region may arrest and detain;
- (2) the sending Region shall be notified within 48 hours;
- (3) the sending Region determines whether to revoke or modify supervision;
- (4) the receiving Region may return the person to the sending Region.

(b) **New Offenses.** If a supervisee commits a new offense in the receiving
Region:

- (1) the receiving Region prosecutes the new offense;
- (2) the sending Region may revoke supervision;
- (3) sentences may run consecutively or concurrently as determined by courts.

(c) **Absconding.** If a supervisee absconds:

- (1) the receiving Region shall notify the sending Region within 24 hours;
- (2) the sending Region may issue a warrant;
- (3) Article I, Section 11 extradition provisions apply.

### Section 14. Sentence Portability

(a) **No Automatic Sentence Transfer.** A person sentenced in one Region does
not automatically serve their sentence in another Region.

(b) **Transfer Agreements.** Regions may enter agreements for:

- (1) incarceration of prisoners from other Regions;

(c) **Prisoner Requests.** A prisoner may request transfer to a facility in
another Region:

- (1) if the receiving Region agrees;
- (2) if the sending Region consents;
- (3) subject to conditions established by both Regions.

(d) **Credits and Release.** For transferred prisoners:

- (1) the sending Region's sentence controls release date;
- (2) good time credits earned in the receiving Region count toward the
    sending Region's sentence;

across Regions.

(b) **Limited Sharing.** Juvenile records may be shared:

- (1) with juvenile courts in other Regions for pending cases;
- (2) with adult courts where juvenile records are relevant to sentencing;
- (3) consistent with the originating Region's confidentiality rules.

---

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Sanctuary Region

**Attack:** A Region refuses to participate in coordination systems, becoming
a sanctuary for offenders escaping supervision.

**Countermeasure:**

- Mandatory acceptance categories require transfer acceptance (Section 12(a))
- Federal database participation conditioned on funding (Section 51(b))
- Extradition provisions apply regardless (Article I, Section 11)

**Outcome:** Non-participation has costs; basic extradition still applies.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Over-Sharing for Harassment

**Attack:** A Region uses coordination systems to share excessive information
to harass persons with minor records.

**Countermeasure:**

- Access limited to authorized purposes (Section 2(a))
- Regional law governs private party access (Section 2(c))
- Audit requirements (Section 2(b)(3))
- Challenge and correction procedures (Section 2(b)(4))

**Outcome:** Misuse is detectable and actionable; Regional privacy law provides
additional protection.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Registry Evasion

**Attack:** Sex offenders move frequently between Regions to avoid registration.

**Countermeasure:**

- Registration required in all Regions of residence, work, school (Section 22(a))
- Interstate notification within 24 hours (Section 23(a))
- Either Region may prosecute failure to register (Section 23(c)(1))
- National registry flags non-compliance (Section 23(c)(3))

**Outcome:** Multi-Region registration makes evasion difficult; national
tracking catches gaps.

---

### Attack Vector 4: Supervision Dumping

**Attack:** A Region transfers difficult supervisees to other Regions to offload
costs and risks.

**Countermeasure:**

- Receiving Region acceptance required except for mandatory categories
  (Section 12)
- Mandatory categories limited to persons with ties (residence, family,
  employment)
- Sending Region retains sentence authority (Section 13)

**Outcome:** Transfer requires either receiving Region consent or genuine ties;
pure dumping blocked.

---

### Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| Data quality varies by Region | Medium | Federal standards; funding incentives |
| System not fully interoperable | Medium | Federal technical support; transition period |
| Privacy breaches | Medium | Cybersecurity requirements; audits |
| Regional non-compliance | Low | Federal funding conditions; peer pressure |
