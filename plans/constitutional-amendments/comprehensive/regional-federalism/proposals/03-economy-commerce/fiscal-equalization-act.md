# Fiscal Equalization Act

This proposal establishes the statutory framework for the Regional Fiscal Equalization
Program, operationalizing the constitutional mandate for automatic, formula-based
equalization transfers. This Act defines the formula, inputs, and the role of the
Independent Fiscal Council.

---

## Constitutional Foundation

The Regional Federal Constitution, Article I, Section 3.X (to be added, as per
`01-reply_to_regional_federalism_plan_review_2026_01_11.md`), mandates:

- Establishment of an Independent Fiscal Council.
- A public, automatic, and revisable equalization formula.
- Prohibition of suspension of equalization during non-emergency periods.

This Act implements these constitutional mandates through specific procedures.

## Purpose

Establish a Fiscal Equalization Program that:

- Ensures baseline governing capacity across all Regions.
- Promotes fiscal equity and reduces disparities in public service provision.
- Operates automatically and transparently, minimizing political interference.
- Adapts to changing economic conditions through objective indexing.
- Supports the legitimacy and stability of the Regional Federal system.

## Part II: Fiscal Equalization Program

### Section 11. Equalization Principle

(a) The purpose of the Fiscal Equalization Program is to ensure that each Region
has the fiscal capacity to provide a comparable level of public services at
comparable tax rates, regardless of its inherent revenue-generating capacity.

(b) Equalization transfers shall be unconditional and shall not be tied to
specific spending programs.

### Section 12. Equalization Formula

(a) **Target Fiscal Capacity.** The target fiscal capacity for each Region shall
be the national average fiscal capacity per capita.

(b) **Fiscal Capacity Calculation.** A Region's fiscal capacity shall be
calculated annually by the Council based on the following weighted inputs:

- (1) **Tax Capacity (60% weight):** A measure of the revenue a Region could
    generate if it applied national average tax rates to its own tax bases
    (e.g., property, income, sales).
- (2) **Service Cost Index (30% weight):** A measure of the relative cost of
    delivering public services in a Region, accounting for factors such as
    population density, demographic composition (e.g., proportion of elderly,
    children, low-income residents), and geographic dispersion.
- (3) **Resource Revenue (10% weight):** A measure of non-tax revenues derived
    from natural resources (e.g., mineral rights, timber, water rights).

(c) **Equalization Transfer.** Each Region whose calculated fiscal capacity falls
below the target fiscal capacity shall receive an equalization transfer equal to
the difference. Regions above the target shall not receive transfers.

(d) **Data Sources.** The Council shall use the most recent and reliable data
from federal agencies (e.g., Census Bureau, Bureau of Economic Analysis) and
Regional governments for all calculations.

### Section 13. Annual Calculation and Publication

(a) The Council shall calculate and publish the equalization transfers for each
Region no later than September 1st of each year, for the fiscal year beginning
the following January 1st.

(b) The calculations shall be fully transparent, including all data inputs,
weights, and formulas used.

(c) The Council shall provide a detailed report explaining the calculations and
any significant changes from the previous year.

### Section 14. Payment Schedule

(a) Equalization transfers shall be paid to eligible Regions in quarterly
installments, beginning January 1st of the fiscal year for which they are
calculated.

(b) Payments shall be made directly from the Federal Treasury.

### Section 15. Review and Revision of Formula

(a) The Council shall conduct a comprehensive review of the equalization formula
every ten (10) years, following the decennial census.

(b) Recommendations for revisions to the formula (including inputs, weights, or
calculation methods) shall be submitted to Congress and the Regional Assemblies.

(c) Revisions to the formula shall require a three-fifths (3/5) vote of both
chambers of Congress and ratification by a majority of Regional Assemblies.

---

## Part III: Budget, Accountability, and Enforcement

### Section 21. Budget and Resources

(a) **Mandatory Appropriation.** The Council shall have an independent budget
appropriated as mandatory spending.

(b) **Budget Floor.** The budget may not be reduced below the prior year's level
adjusted for inflation (as measured by the Consumer Price Index).

(c) **Staff.** The Council may hire staff as necessary for its functions. Staff
shall be subject to the same disqualification criteria as members.

### Section 22. Transparency and Public Reporting

(a) All Council meetings shall be open to the public, with at least 14 days
advance notice.

(b) Minutes and voting records shall be published within 7 days of each meeting.

(c) The Council shall publish an annual report on the state of fiscal
equalization, including program performance, economic data, and recommendations
for improvement.

### Section 23. Judicial Review

(a) Decisions of the Council regarding formula application and transfer
calculations are subject to judicial review in federal court.

(b) Challenges to Council decisions shall receive expedited review.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Political Manipulation of Formula Inputs

**Attack:** A politically motivated administration attempts to manipulate the
data inputs used in the equalization formula to favor certain Regions or
disadvantage others.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Independent Council (Section 1):** The Council is independent of the
    executive branch.
- **Expert Qualifications (Section 4):** Members are chosen for expertise, not
    political affiliation.
- **Transparent Data Sources (Section 12(d)):** Mandates use of reliable,
    publicly available federal and Regional data.
- **Public Calculations (Section 13(b)):** All calculations are transparent
    and subject to public scrutiny.
- **Judicial Review (Section 23):** Decisions are subject to expedited judicial
    review for adherence to the formula.

**Outcome:** Manipulation of inputs would be immediately detectable and legally
challengeable, making it difficult to sustain.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Budget Starvation of the Council

**Attack:** Congress attempts to undermine the Council by underfunding its
budget, preventing it from performing its calculations or administering payments.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Mandatory Appropriation (Section 21(a)):** The budget is mandatory
    spending, not subject to discretionary political cuts.
- **Budget Floor (Section 21(b)):** Prevents reductions below prior levels,
    adjusted for inflation.
- **Judicial Review:** Failure to provide adequate funding could be challenged
    as an obstruction of a constitutionally mandated body.

**Outcome:** The Council's budget is protected from partisan attacks, ensuring it
has the resources to fulfill its mandate.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Suspension of Payments During Crisis

**Attack:** During an economic downturn or other crisis, Congress or the President
attempts to suspend equalization payments to redirect funds.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Constitutional Prohibition:** The underlying constitutional mandate
    (Article I, Section 3.X) explicitly prohibits suspension during non-emergency
    periods.
- **Automatic Payments (Section 14):** Payments are automatic and directly from
    the Federal Treasury, not requiring annual re-authorization.
- **Judicial Review:** Any attempt to suspend payments would be a direct
    violation of the Constitution and this Act, subject to immediate judicial
    challenge.

**Outcome:** Suspension of payments is constitutionally and statutorily prohibited,
and any attempt would be swiftly overturned by the courts.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Political gridlock on formula revisions** | Medium | High threshold for revision (3/5 Congress + majority Regions) ensures stability but can lead to outdated formula if consensus is lacking. |
| **Subtle bias in Service Cost Index methodology** | Medium | Council expertise, transparency, and judicial review mitigate, but complex indices can be influenced by methodological choices. |
| **Data availability and reliability** | Low | Reliance on federal and Regional data sources; Council can recommend improvements but cannot compel data collection. |
