# Inter-Regional Financial Regulation and Stability Act

This proposal establishes a coordinated federal-Regional framework for financial regulation, supervision, and crisis response, aiming to maintain a stable national economy and prevent regulatory arbitrage.

---

## Purpose

Establish a framework for Inter-Regional Financial Regulation and Stability that:

- Ensures the stability and integrity of the national financial system.
- Prevents regulatory arbitrage and a "race to the bottom" in financial oversight.
- Provides clear roles for federal and Regional authorities in financial supervision.
- Establishes coordinated protocols for crisis response and resolution.
- Sets federal floors for consumer financial protection.

## Part I: Chartering and Supervision Authority

### Section 1. Federal Chartering and Supervision

(a) **National Banks.** The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) shall retain exclusive authority to charter and supervise national banks.

(b) **Federal Credit Unions.** The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) shall retain exclusive authority to charter and supervise federal credit unions.

(c) **Systemically Important Institutions.** The Federal Reserve Board shall have primary supervisory authority over all financial institutions designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), regardless of their chartering authority.

### Section 2. Regional Chartering and Supervision

(a) **Regional Banks and Credit Unions.** Regions shall have authority to charter and supervise Regional banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions operating primarily within their boundaries.

(b) **Regional Regulatory Standards.** Regional financial regulators shall establish and enforce prudential and conduct standards for institutions chartered within their Region, provided such standards meet or exceed federal floors.

(c) **Inter-Regional Operations.** A Regional-chartered institution operating in more than one Region shall be subject to the prudential standards of its chartering Region and the conduct standards of each Region in which it operates.

### Section 3. Federal Deposit Insurance

(a) **FDIC Authority.** The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) shall continue to insure deposits in all federally and Regional-chartered banks and savings associations.

(b) **Supervisory Role.** The FDIC shall have backup supervisory authority over Regional-chartered institutions to ensure deposit insurance fund integrity.

## Part II: Systemic Risk Oversight and Crisis Response

### Section 11. Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC)

(a) **Establishment.** The FSOC shall continue to monitor the stability of the U.S. financial system.

(b) **Composition.** The FSOC shall include the Secretary of the Treasury (Chair), the Chair of the Federal Reserve, the Director of the OCC, the Chair of the FDIC, the Chair of the SEC, the Chair of the NCUA, and two representatives from Regional financial regulatory authorities, appointed by the President with Senate consent.

(c) **Functions.** The FSOC shall:
    - (1) Identify risks to the financial stability of the United States.
    - (2) Designate nonbank financial companies and financial market utilities as systemically important.
    - (3) Make recommendations to primary financial regulatory agencies to enhance financial stability.

### Section 12. Crisis Response Protocol

(a) **Coordination.** During a financial crisis, the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and FSOC shall coordinate with affected Regional financial regulators to ensure a unified response.

(b) **Lender of Last Resort.** The Federal Reserve shall retain its authority as the lender of last resort to all solvent financial institutions, regardless of chartering authority.

(c) **Resolution Authority.** The FDIC shall retain its authority to resolve failing systemically important financial institutions, including those chartered by Regions, to prevent contagion.

(d) **Information Sharing.** Federal and Regional financial regulators shall share information relevant to financial stability and crisis management on an expedited basis.

## Part III: Consumer Financial Protection Floors

### Section 21. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) Authority

(a) **Federal Floors.** The CFPB shall establish and enforce federal minimum standards for consumer financial products and services, including mortgages, credit cards, and consumer loans.

(b) **Regional Authority.** Regions may enact and enforce consumer financial protection laws that provide greater protection to consumers than federal floors, provided they do not conflict with federal law.

(c) **Preemption.** Federal consumer financial protection laws shall preempt Regional laws only where there is an explicit conflict or where the Regional law provides less protection to consumers.

### Section 22. Fair Lending and Access

(a) **Non-Discrimination.** Federal fair lending laws (e.g., Equal Credit Opportunity Act, Fair Housing Act) shall apply uniformly across all Regions.

(b) **Access to Credit.** Regions may not enact laws that unduly restrict access to credit for their residents or discriminate against out-of-region lenders.

---

## Part IV: Securities and Insurance Regulation

### Section 31. Securities Regulation

(a) **Federal Primacy.** The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) shall retain primary authority for regulating securities markets, including exchanges, brokers, dealers, and investment advisors.

### Section 32. Insurance Regulation

(a) **Regional Primacy.** Regions shall retain primary authority for regulating insurance companies and insurance products within their boundaries.

(b) **Federal Backstop for Inter-Regional Insurers.** For insurance companies operating in three or more Regions, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) shall, in coordination with the FSOC, establish federal backstop regulatory standards to address systemic risk and ensure solvency across multiple jurisdictions.

(c) **Inter-Regional Compacts.** Regions are encouraged to form inter-regional compacts to harmonize insurance regulation and facilitate the operation of multi-regional insurers.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Regulatory Arbitrage

**Attack:** Financial institutions choose to charter in Regions with the weakest regulatory standards, creating a "race to the bottom" and undermining national stability.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Federal Floors (Section 2(b), 21(a)):** Regional standards must meet or exceed federal minimums.
- **FDIC Backup Supervision (Section 3(b)):** FDIC can intervene if Regional supervision is inadequate.
- **FSOC Systemic Risk Oversight (Section 11(c)):** FSOC can recommend stricter standards for institutions posing systemic risk, regardless of charter.
- **Inter-Regional Operations (Section 2(c)):** Institutions operating across Regions must meet conduct standards of each Region.

**Outcome:** Federal floors and oversight prevent a complete race to the bottom; institutions cannot entirely escape robust regulation by choosing a lenient chartering Region.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Regional Obstruction of Federal Crisis Response

**Attack:** A Regional government attempts to block federal intervention (e.g., FDIC resolution of a failing Regional bank) during a financial crisis, citing Regional sovereignty.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Federal Reserve Lender of Last Resort (Section 12(b)):** Federal Reserve's authority is national.
- **FDIC Resolution Authority (Section 12(c)):** FDIC's authority to resolve failing institutions is paramount for national stability.
- **FSOC Authority (Section 11):** FSOC's role in identifying and mitigating systemic risk is federal.
- **Federal Supremacy:** Federal authority in crisis response is rooted in enumerated powers (commerce, general welfare) and is supreme.

**Outcome:** While Regional input is valued, federal authority to prevent and mitigate systemic financial crises is supreme and cannot be obstructed by individual Regions.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Federal Overreach into Regional Financial Institutions

**Attack:** The federal government uses its systemic risk authority to impose overly burdensome regulations on all Regional-chartered institutions, stifling Regional innovation or disproportionately affecting smaller institutions.

**Countermeasure:**

- **FSOC Composition (Section 11(b)):** Includes Regional financial regulatory representatives to ensure Regional perspectives are heard.
- **Recommendations, Not Mandates:** FSOC primarily makes recommendations to primary regulators.
- **Judicial Review:** Federal actions must be consistent with the scope of federal enumerated powers and this Act, subject to judicial challenge.
- **Regional Primacy (Section 2(a), 32(a)):** Explicitly preserves Regional authority for institutions operating primarily within their boundaries.

**Outcome:** Federal intervention is limited to systemic risk and federal floors; broad overreach into purely Regional institutions is constrained.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Defining "systemically important" objectively** | Medium | FSOC rulemaking with public comment; judicial precedent will refine over time; international standards. |
| **Political will for tough regulation during boom times** | High | Independent agencies (Fed, FDIC, OCC, NCUA, SEC, CFPB) are designed to be insulated from short-term political pressures. |
| **Global financial interconnectedness** | High | Requires international cooperation and agreements beyond the scope of this domestic act. |
| **Complexity of inter-regional operations for smaller institutions** | Medium | Model compacts for inter-regional operations; federal technical assistance for Regional regulators. |
