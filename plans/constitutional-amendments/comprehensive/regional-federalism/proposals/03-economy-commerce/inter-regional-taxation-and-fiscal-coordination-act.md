# Inter-Regional Taxation and Fiscal Coordination Act

This proposal establishes clear and fair principles for the taxation of inter-regional commerce, creating a uniform framework to prevent double taxation, prohibit tax exportation, and provide mechanisms for resolving tax disputes between Regions.

---

## Purpose

Establish an Inter-Regional Taxation and Fiscal Coordination Act that:

- Creates a uniform federal standard for when a business has sufficient presence ("nexus") in a Region to be subject to its taxes.
- Establishes a standard formula for apportioning corporate income among Regions to prevent double taxation.
- Prohibits taxes designed to export the tax burden to non-residents.
- Defines a uniform standard for determining an individual's residency for tax purposes.
- Grants the Allocation Review Board (ARB) jurisdiction to adjudicate inter-regional tax disputes.

## Part I: Principles of Inter-Regional Taxation

### Section 1. Corporate Income Tax Nexus Standard

(a) A Region may impose a net income tax on a business only if the business has a "substantial nexus" with the Region.

(b) **Physical Presence Required.** For the purposes of this Act, substantial nexus for net income taxes requires a physical presence in the Region for more than a de minimis period. Physical presence includes, but is not limited to:
    - (1) Maintaining an office, warehouse, or other place of business.
    - (2) Having one or more employees or exclusive agents performing duties within the Region.
    - (3) Owning or leasing tangible property within the Region.

(c) An economic nexus, based solely on sales volume into a Region without a physical presence, is insufficient to establish nexus for the purpose of corporate net income taxation.

### Section 2. Uniform Apportionment Formula

(a) All Regions that impose a corporate income tax shall apportion the income of a multi-regional business using an **equally weighted three-factor formula**.

(b) The apportionment percentage shall be the average of the following three ratios:
    - (1) The ratio of the taxpayer's real and tangible personal property in the Region to its total real and tangible personal property everywhere.
    - (2) The ratio of the taxpayer's payroll in the Region to its total payroll everywhere.
    - (3) The ratio of the taxpayer's sales in the Region to its total sales everywhere.

(c) The Independent Fiscal Council shall, by regulation, define the specific components and sourcing rules for the property, payroll, and sales factors to ensure uniform application.

### Section 3. Prohibition on Tax Exportation

(a) No Region may impose a tax where the primary economic incidence of the tax falls on non-residents.

(b) **Prohibited Taxes.** Taxes that are presumptively prohibited under this section include:
    - (1) Taxes on the extraction or severance of natural resources that are structured to apply primarily to resources exported to other Regions.
    - (2) Discriminatory taxes on tourism, such as hotel or rental car taxes that apply at a higher rate to non-residents.
    - (3) Taxes on the transit of goods or energy through infrastructure that are not directly related to the cost of using that infrastructure.

(c) A tax with a disparate impact on non-residents may be upheld only if the Region demonstrates to the ARB that the tax is the only feasible way to recover the specific public costs associated with the taxed activity.

### Section 4. Uniform Residency Standard for Personal Income Tax

(a) For the purposes of personal income taxation, an individual shall be considered a resident of only one Region for any given tax year.

(b) **Domicile Test.** An individual's Region of residence is their "domicile," which is defined as their true, fixed, permanent home and principal establishment, and to which they intend to return whenever they are absent.

(c) **Tie-Breaker Rules.** If an individual's domicile is in dispute between two or more Regions, the following tie-breaker rules shall be applied in order of priority:
    - (1) The Region in which the individual has a permanent home available to them.
    - (2) The Region with which their personal and economic relations are closer (center of vital interests).
    - (3) The Region in which they have a habitual abode.
    - (4) The Region in which they are a citizen, if applicable.

## Part II: Dispute Resolution

### Section 11. Allocation Review Board (ARB) Jurisdiction

(a) The Allocation Review Board (ARB) shall have exclusive original jurisdiction to mediate and adjudicate disputes between Regions concerning nexus, apportionment, tax exportation, and residency.

(b) A Region or an affected taxpayer (after exhausting Regional administrative remedies) may petition the ARB for a binding determination.

### Section 12. Process

(a) The ARB shall use its established tiered dispute resolution process, beginning with expedited mediation.

(b) ARB determinations under this Act are binding on all parties, subject to expedited judicial review in federal court on questions of law.

---

## Part III: Coordination

### Section 21. Inter-Regional Tax Council

(a) There is established an "Inter-Regional Tax Council" (the "Council").

(b) **Composition.** The Council shall be composed of the Secretary of the Treasury (or designee) and the head of each Regional tax authority.

(c) **Functions.** The Council shall meet at least annually to:
    - (1) Develop best practices for tax administration.
    - (2) Create model tax forms to simplify inter-regional filing.
    - (3) Coordinate on enforcement efforts and information sharing to combat tax evasion.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Creative Tax Exportation

**Attack:** A resource-rich Region imposes a high "environmental impact fee" on every ton of coal extracted, knowing that 95% of the coal is exported to power plants in other Regions.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Primary Incidence Test (Section 3):** An affected Region or business would petition the ARB. The ARB would analyze the economic incidence of the fee. If it finds the cost is overwhelmingly passed on to out-of-region consumers, it would rule the fee is a prohibited export tax.
- **Burden of Proof (Section 3(c)):** The burden would be on the taxing Region to prove the fee was the only way to cover specific public costs, a high bar to clear.

**Outcome:** The ARB would invalidate the fee as a prohibited tax on non-residents.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Aggressive Nexus Interpretation

**Attack:** A Region passes a law claiming that having a website accessible to its residents constitutes "substantial nexus," and attempts to tax the income of any online business that makes sales in the Region.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Physical Presence Rule (Section 1(b)):** The Act establishes a clear, bright-line rule requiring physical presence for income tax nexus.
- **ARB Adjudication (Section 11):** An affected business would petition the ARB, which would apply the clear federal standard and rule that the Region lacks nexus to impose the tax.

**Outcome:** The ARB would issue a binding determination that the Region's law is preempted by the federal standard.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Dual Residency Claims

**Attack:** A wealthy individual owns homes in two Regions and spends significant time in both. Both Regions claim the individual as a resident for income tax purposes.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Uniform Standard (Section 4):** The Act provides a single, uniform test for residency.
- **Tie-Breaker Rules (Section 4(c)):** The ARB would apply the clear, hierarchical tie-breaker rules to determine a single Region of residence for tax purposes, resolving the dispute.

**Outcome:** The ARB's binding determination would force one Region to drop its claim, preventing double taxation.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Defining "primary economic incidence"** | Medium | ARB rulemaking and judicial precedent will develop a body of case law; reliance on expert economic analysis. |
| **Taxation of digital goods and services** | High | This Act focuses on income tax. A separate framework may be needed for sales tax nexus for digital goods, which is a rapidly evolving area of law. |
| **Resistance to information sharing** | Low | The Council is cooperative, but federal incentives could be added to encourage participation in joint enforcement programs. |
