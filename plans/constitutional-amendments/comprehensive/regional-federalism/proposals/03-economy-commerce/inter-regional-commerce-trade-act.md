# Inter-Regional Commerce and Trade Act

This proposal establishes a framework for resolving inter-regional trade disputes and preventing economic protectionism, ensuring the United States remains a single, unified common market.

---

## Purpose

Establish a framework for Inter-Regional Commerce and Trade that:

- Prevents economic protectionism and discriminatory practices among Regions.
- Ensures a single, unified common market for goods, services, and capital.
- Provides clear mechanisms for resolving inter-regional trade disputes.
- Promotes fair competition and economic efficiency across the federation.
- Complements the `National Common Market Access Act` by addressing non-physical barriers to trade.

## Part I: Prohibited Actions and Standards

### Section 1. Prohibition on Discriminatory Regulation

(a) **General Prohibition.** No Region may enact or enforce any law, regulation, or administrative practice that discriminates against out-of-region goods, services, capital, or economic actors.

(b) **Discrimination Defined.** Discrimination includes, but is not limited to:
    - (1) **Facial Discrimination:** Laws that explicitly treat out-of-region entities less favorably.
    - (2) **Discriminatory Effect:** Laws that, while facially neutral, have a primary purpose or effect of disadvantaging out-of-region entities without a legitimate, non-protectionist justification.
    - (3) **Undue Burden:** Laws that impose an excessive burden on interstate commerce that is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits.

(c) **Legitimate Justification.** A discriminatory regulation may be upheld only if the Region demonstrates that:
    - (1) It serves a legitimate local public interest (e.g., public health, safety, environmental protection).
    - (2) The interest cannot be served by non-discriminatory alternatives.
    - (3) The burden on interstate commerce is not clearly excessive in relation to the local benefits.

### Section 2. Prohibition on Targeted Subsidies

(a) **General Prohibition.** No Region may provide subsidies, tax incentives, or other economic benefits that are primarily designed to:
    - (1) Lure businesses or industries from other Regions.
    - (2) Create an unfair competitive advantage for in-region businesses over out-of-region competitors.

(b) **Targeted Subsidy Defined.** A subsidy is "primarily designed" for prohibited purposes if:
    - (1) It is explicitly conditioned on relocation from another Region.
    - (2) It is offered to a specific business or industry with a documented history of inter-regional relocation.
    - (3) Its value is disproportionate to any demonstrable in-region economic development benefit beyond the relocation itself.

(c) **Permitted Subsidies.** General economic development programs, workforce training initiatives, or infrastructure investments available to all businesses within a Region (or specific sectors without regard to origin) are permitted.

### Section 3. Licensing and Certification Barriers

(a) **General Prohibition.** No Region may impose licensing, certification, or registration requirements that:
    - (1) Are not genuinely related to public health, safety, or welfare.
    - (2) Disproportionately burden out-of-region applicants or entities compared to in-region ones.
    - (3) Are designed to protect in-region economic interests from competition.

(b) **Reciprocity.** This Section complements the `Interstate Professional Licensing Reciprocity Act` and extends its principles to all commercial licenses and certifications.

## Part II: Oversight and Dispute Resolution

### Section 11. Allocation Review Board (ARB) Authority

(a) **Jurisdiction.** The Allocation Review Board (ARB) shall have exclusive original jurisdiction to mediate and adjudicate disputes arising under this Act.

(b) **Referral.** Any Region, federal agency, or affected economic actor may petition the ARB for review of a potentially discriminatory practice.

### Section 12. Tiered Dispute Resolution Process

(a) **Expedited Mediation.** Upon receipt of a petition, the ARB shall convene expedited mediation between the disputing parties within 30 days.

(b) **Formal Adjudication.** If mediation fails, the ARB shall conduct a formal hearing and issue a binding determination within 90 days. The ARB's determination shall include findings of fact and conclusions of law regarding compliance with this Act.

(c) **Federal Judicial Review.** ARB determinations are subject to expedited judicial review in federal court, limited to questions of law and whether the ARB's findings are supported by substantial evidence.

### Section 13. Interim Measures

(a) Pending a final determination, the ARB may issue interim orders to prevent irreparable harm to interstate commerce or maintain the status quo.

(b) Federal courts may issue temporary injunctions to enforce ARB interim orders.

---

## Part III: Federal Enforcement

### Section 21. Enforcement Authority

(a) In cases of ongoing or imminent violation of this Act, the federal government may:
    - (1) Issue immediate cessation orders.
    - (2) Impose civil penalties up to $1,000,000 per violation, or 0.1% of the affected Region's annual GDP, whichever is greater, collectible through federal courts.
    - (3) Withhold discretionary federal funds from the non-compliant Region, provided the withheld funds are reasonably related to the economic activity in question.

  *Note: Per Article X, Section 4 (Anti-Coercion Rule), equalization transfers may not be withheld as an enforcement mechanism.*

(b) **Triggering Events.** Federal enforcement is authorized when:
    - (1) An ARB determination of violation has been issued and the Region has failed to comply within 60 days.
    - (2) A federal court has issued an order requiring compliance and the Region has failed to comply within 30 days.
    - (3) The violation is causing severe, widespread economic harm across multiple Regions.

### Section 22. Remedies

(a) Federal courts may issue injunctive relief to compel compliance with this Act.
(b) Affected economic actors may seek compensatory damages for documented harm caused by violations of this Act.

## Part IV: Commercial Law Harmonization

### Section 31. Model Commercial Codes

(a) The Department of Commerce, in consultation with the ARB and Regional legal experts, shall develop and publish model commercial codes for optional Regional adoption.

(b) Model codes shall cover areas such as:
    - (1) Sales and contract law.
    - (2) Business formation and registration.
    - (3) Secured transactions.
    - (4) Digital commerce and consumer protection.

(c) Model codes shall aim to reduce inter-regional friction while preserving Regional flexibility for innovation.

### Section 32. Incentives for Adoption

(a) The federal government may offer financial incentives (e.g., matching grants, technical assistance) to Regions that adopt model commercial codes or enter into compacts to harmonize their commercial laws.

(b) The ARB shall publish an annual report on the degree of commercial law harmonization across Regions.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Subtle Discriminatory Effects

**Attack:** A Region enacts complex, facially neutral regulations (e.g., unique packaging standards, specific ingredient sourcing requirements) that disproportionately burden out-of-region producers, claiming legitimate public interest.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Discriminatory Effect Test (Section 1(b)(2)):** The Act explicitly prohibits regulations with a primary *effect* of disadvantaging out-of-region entities, even if the intent is not explicit.
- **Burden of Proof (Section 1(c)):** The burden is on the Region to demonstrate a legitimate, non-protectionist justification and the absence of non-discriminatory alternatives.
- **ARB Adjudication and Judicial Review:** The ARB and federal courts can scrutinize the true purpose and impact of such regulations.

**Outcome:** While subtle discrimination is challenging to detect, the "effects test" and burden of proof on the enacting Region, combined with independent review, provide a strong check.

---

### Attack Vector 2: "Subsidy Wars" and Economic Poaching

**Attack:** Regions engage in aggressive competition, offering large, targeted subsidies to lure major employers from neighboring Regions, leading to a "race to the bottom" and erosion of the national tax base.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Prohibition on Targeted Subsidies (Section 2):** Explicitly prohibits subsidies primarily designed to lure businesses from other Regions or create unfair competitive advantages.
- **ARB Review:** The ARB can investigate and rule on whether a subsidy program violates this prohibition.
- **Federal Enforcement:** Federal sanctions, including withholding of discretionary funds, can be applied for violations.

**Outcome:** While general economic development incentives are permitted, direct "poaching" subsidies are prohibited and subject to federal enforcement, mitigating destructive subsidy wars.

---

### Attack Vector 3: ARB Capture and Bias

**Attack:** A partisan majority attempts to capture the ARB to consistently rule in favor of federal or specific regional economic interests, undermining fair trade.

**Countermeasure:**

- **ARB Composition:** The ARB's independent composition (established in Article II, Section 5 of the Constitution) with staggered terms and diverse appointing authorities protects against partisan capture.
- **Expertise and Transparency:** Members are chosen for expertise, and all methodologies, data, and determinations are public.
- **Federal Judicial Review:** ARB determinations are subject to expedited federal judicial review, ensuring adherence to legal principles.

**Outcome:** Capture is difficult due to independent composition; biased rulings are transparent and judicially reviewable.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Complexity of Proving "Primary Effect" or "Undue Burden"** | Medium | ARB rulemaking with public comment; judicial precedent will refine over time; reliance on economic impact assessments. |
| **Political Pressure on ARB Decisions** | Medium | Independent composition, fixed terms, and judicial review mitigate, but cannot eliminate political pressure. |
| **Resistance to Commercial Law Harmonization** | Low | Adoption of model codes is voluntary; federal incentives can encourage but not mandate. |
| **Enforcement of Sanctions** | Medium | Withholding discretionary funds can be politically contentious; requires strong federal will. |
