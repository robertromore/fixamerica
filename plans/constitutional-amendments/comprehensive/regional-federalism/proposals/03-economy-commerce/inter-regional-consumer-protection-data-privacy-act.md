# Inter-Regional Consumer Protection and Data Privacy Act

This proposal establishes federal floors for consumer protection and data privacy and creates mechanisms for inter-regional coordination and enforcement of consumer rights, ensuring a fair and consistent marketplace across all Regions.

---

## Purpose

Establish an Inter-Regional Consumer Protection and Data Privacy Framework that:

- Sets minimum national standards for data privacy, giving consumers control over their personal information.
- Establishes federal floors for consumer protection, preventing a "race to the bottom" among Regions.
- Creates mechanisms for inter-regional coordination and enforcement of consumer rights.
- Promotes a secure and predictable digital and commercial environment for all citizens.

## Part I: Federal Data Privacy Floors

### Section 1. Data Minimization and Purpose Limitation

(a) **Data Minimization.** Businesses shall collect only personal data that is adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes.

(b) **Purpose Limitation.** Businesses shall not process personal data for any purpose other than those for which it was originally collected, unless the consumer provides explicit consent for a new purpose.

### Section 2. Consumer Data Rights

(a) **Right to Access.** Consumers have the right to access their personal data held by a business, free of charge and in a portable format.

(b) **Right to Correction.** Consumers have the right to correct inaccurate or incomplete personal data.

(c) **Right to Deletion.** Consumers have the right to request deletion of their personal data, subject to certain exceptions (e.g., legal obligations, fraud prevention).

(d) **Right to Opt-Out.** Consumers have the right to opt out of the sale of their personal data and targeted advertising.

### Section 3. Data Security

(a) **Reasonable Security.** Businesses shall implement and maintain reasonable security measures to protect personal data from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.

(b) **Data Breach Notification.** Businesses shall notify affected consumers and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) of any data breach involving personal data within 72 hours of discovery.

## Part II: Federal Consumer Protection Floors

### Section 11. Product Safety Standards

(a) **Minimum Standards.** All products sold in the United States shall meet minimum federal safety standards established by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).

## Part III: Inter-Regional Coordination and Enforcement

### Section 21. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Authority

(a) **Enforcement.** The FTC shall have primary authority to enforce this Act and to investigate and prosecute violations of consumer protection and data privacy laws.

(b) **Rulemaking.** The FTC is authorized to issue rules and regulations to implement this Act.

### Section 22. Inter-Regional Consumer Protection Council

(a) **Establishment.** There is established an "Inter-Regional Consumer Protection Council" (the "Council").

(b) **Composition.** The Council shall be composed of:
    -   (1) The Chair of the Federal Trade Commission (as Chair).
    -   (2) The head of each Regional consumer protection agency.
    -   (3) Three non-voting members representing consumer advocacy groups, appointed by the President.

(c) **Functions.** The Council shall:
    -   (1) Facilitate information sharing and coordination among federal and Regional consumer protection agencies.
    -   (2) Develop best practices for consumer protection and data privacy.
    -   (3) Mediate disputes between Regions regarding consumer protection matters.

### Section 23. Private Right of Action

(a) **Right to Sue.** Consumers harmed by violations of this Act shall have a private right of action to seek damages and injunctive relief in federal court.

---

## Part IV: Anti-Circumvention

### Section 31. Preemption

(a) This Act establishes federal floors for consumer protection and data privacy. Regions may enact laws that provide greater protection to consumers, provided they do not conflict with this Act.

### Section 32. Enforcement Cooperation

(a) Federal and Regional consumer protection agencies are encouraged to cooperate in enforcement efforts, including sharing information and coordinating investigations.

---

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Weak Enforcement by FTC

**Attack:** A hostile administration weakens the FTC, leading to lax enforcement of consumer protection and data privacy laws.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Private Right of Action (Section 23):** Consumers can sue businesses directly for violations, bypassing the need for FTC enforcement.
- **Inter-Regional Consumer Protection Council (Section 22):** Provides a forum for Regional agencies to coordinate enforcement efforts, even if the FTC is weak.

**Outcome:** While a weak FTC would be detrimental, the private right of action and the Inter-Regional Council provide alternative enforcement mechanisms.

---

### Attack Vector 2: "Privacy Washing" by Businesses

**Attack:** Businesses create complex and misleading privacy policies that appear to comply with the law but, in practice, do not protect consumer data.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Data Minimization and Purpose Limitation (Section 1):** Limits the types of data businesses can collect and how they can use it, regardless of what their privacy policies say.
- **Consumer Data Rights (Section 2):** Gives consumers the right to access, correct, and delete their data, allowing them to hold businesses accountable.
- **FTC Rulemaking (Section 21):** The FTC can issue rules to clarify and strengthen the requirements of this Act, preventing businesses from exploiting loopholes.

**Outcome:** The combination of substantive requirements, consumer rights, and FTC rulemaking makes it difficult for businesses to engage in privacy washing.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Regional Protectionism

**Attack:** A Region enacts consumer protection laws that intentionally discriminate against out-of-region businesses.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Prohibition on Discriminatory Practices (Part III):** Prohibits Regions from enacting consumer protection laws that intentionally or effectively discriminate against out-of-region businesses without a legitimate, non-protectionist justification.
- **FTC Oversight (Section 21):** The FTC can investigate and challenge Regional laws that violate this prohibition.

**Outcome:** The prohibition on discriminatory practices and FTC oversight prevent Regions from using consumer protection laws to engage in economic protectionism.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Rapid technological change** | High | FTC rulemaking authority (Section 21) allows for adaptive regulations; periodic review of the Act to incorporate new technologies (e.g., AI, IoT). |
| **Complexity of defining "personal data" or "sale"** | Medium | FTC rulemaking with public comment to provide clear definitions and guidance; judicial precedent will refine over time. |
| **Resource intensity for FTC and Regional agencies** | Medium | Adequate federal and Regional appropriations for enforcement; inter-agency cooperation (Section 32) to share resources and expertise. |
| **Consumer awareness and literacy** | Medium | Public education campaigns by FTC and Council; integration with federal digital literacy programs. |
| **Global nature of data flows** | High | Encourage international cooperation on data privacy standards; focus on domestic impact and data processing within the U.S. |
