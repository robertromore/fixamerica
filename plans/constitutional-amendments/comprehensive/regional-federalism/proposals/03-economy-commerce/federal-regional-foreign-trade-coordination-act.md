# Federal-Regional Foreign Trade Coordination Act

This proposal establishes a formal consultative framework for federal-Regional cooperation on international trade matters, ensuring Regional input into federal trade policy and coordinated trade promotion efforts.

---

## Purpose

Establish a framework for Federal-Regional Foreign Trade Coordination that:

- Creates a formal mechanism for Regions to provide input into federal international trade policy and negotiations.
- Ensures that the impacts of trade agreements on specific Regions are formally considered.
- Coordinates federal and Regional trade promotion and export assistance efforts.
- Provides federal support for Regions and workers affected by trade adjustments.
- Balances exclusive federal authority over foreign trade with the principle of subsidiarity and Regional economic interests.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Federal Disregard of Regional Input

**Attack:** The USTR or a federal administration conducts only perfunctory consultations with the Council, effectively ignoring Regional input on trade negotiations.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Mandatory Consultation (Section 11):** The Act mandates consultation, making perfunctory engagement a violation.
- **Regional Impact Statements (Section 12):** The RIS provides a public record of potential impacts, making federal disregard transparent and politically costly.
- **Council Reporting (Section 3(a)(5)):** The Council's annual report can highlight instances of federal disregard, creating political pressure.
- **Congressional Oversight:** Congress can use the RIS and Council reports to hold the USTR accountable.

**Outcome:** While the federal government retains ultimate authority, the Act creates procedural and transparency requirements that make it difficult to systematically ignore Regional input without political and public scrutiny.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Regional Protectionism via Trade Adjustment

**Attack:** A Region uses its trade adjustment assistance programs or export promotion efforts to subtly favor in-region businesses or discriminate against out-of-region competitors, under the guise of supporting local industry.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Inter-Regional Commerce and Trade Act:** Prohibits discriminatory regulations and targeted subsidies, which would apply to Regional trade programs.
- **Allocation Review Board (ARB):** The ARB has jurisdiction over disputes arising from discriminatory economic practices, including those related to trade adjustment or promotion.
- **Federal TAA Guidelines:** Federal matching funds for TAA programs would come with guidelines preventing discriminatory practices.

**Outcome:** Regional trade programs are subject to existing anti-protectionism frameworks, preventing their misuse for inter-regional economic warfare.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Council Capture or Politicization

**Attack:** A future administration attempts to pack the National Trade Council with partisan appointees to rubber-stamp federal trade policies or to use the Council for political messaging.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Diverse Composition (Section 2(a)):** The Council's composition includes Regional, Presidential, and Congressional appointees, making single-actor capture difficult.
- **Expertise Requirements (Section 2(a)):** Members are chosen for expertise, not solely political affiliation.
- **Transparency:** Council proceedings and reports are public, allowing scrutiny of its advice.

**Outcome:** The diverse and expert composition of the Council, combined with transparency, makes partisan capture difficult and ensures a range of perspectives are represented.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Federal government ignoring Council advice** | Medium | While politically costly, the federal government retains ultimate authority over foreign trade. Mitigation relies on political pressure and transparency. |
| **Defining "major international trade agreement"** | Medium | USTR rulemaking with public comment; Council can advise on criteria; judicial precedent will refine over time. |
| **Funding shortfalls for Trade Adjustment Assistance** | High | Requires sustained Congressional appropriations; advocacy from labor and affected communities. |
| **Complexity of measuring regional impacts of trade** | Medium | Council to develop standardized methodologies; federal agencies to provide technical assistance and data. |
