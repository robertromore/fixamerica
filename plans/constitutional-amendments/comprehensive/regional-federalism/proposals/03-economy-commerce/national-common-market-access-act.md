# National Common Market Access Act

This proposal establishes the statutory framework for the constitutional transit
and non-blockade provisions (Article I, Section 6), providing detailed procedures
for infrastructure access, dispute resolution, and federal enforcement.

---

## Constitutional Foundation

Article I, Section 6 of the Regional Federal Constitution establishes that:

> No Region may deny or unreasonably obstruct access to transportation, energy,
> or communication infrastructure connecting other Regions. All Regions have
> rights of transit through other Regions on reasonable and non-discriminatory
> terms.

This Act implements these principles through specific procedures.

---

## Purpose

Establish common market access procedures that:

- protect transit rights essential to national economic unity,
- prevent infrastructure blockades between Regions,
- provide clear standards for permissible fees and charges,
- establish expedited dispute resolution mechanisms,
- define federal enforcement authority for serious violations.

---

## Part I: Prohibited Actions

### Section 1. Infrastructure Access Prohibition

(a) No Region may deny, obstruct, or unreasonably condition access to:

- (1) **Transportation Infrastructure.** Highways, railroads, airports, ports,
    waterways, and pipelines that connect other Regions to each other or to
    external markets.

- (2) **Energy Transmission.** Electric transmission lines, natural gas
    pipelines, and petroleum pipelines that serve multi-Regional markets.

- (3) **Communication Networks.** Fiber optic cables, wireless spectrum
    infrastructure, and internet exchange points serving multi-Regional
    connectivity.

(b) **Unreasonable Conditions.** Conditions are unreasonable if they:

- (1) discriminate against out-of-Region users,
- (2) impose costs unrelated to actual infrastructure use,
- (3) are designed to advantage in-Region competitors,
- (4) require political or policy concessions unrelated to infrastructure.

### Section 2. Transit Rights

(a) All Regions shall have the right of transit through other Regions for:

- (1) **Goods.** Commercial products, raw materials, agricultural products,
    manufactured goods, and all other lawful commodities.

- (2) **Persons.** Travelers, workers, tourists, and all other persons with
    lawful purpose.

- (3) **Services.** Commercial services, professional services, and digital
    services transmitted through physical infrastructure.

(b) **Non-Discrimination.** Transit traffic shall receive treatment no less
favorable than comparable intra-Regional traffic.

(c) **No New Barriers.** No Region may establish new barriers to transit that
did not exist at ratification, except for genuine public health or safety
reasons narrowly tailored to address specific documented risks.

### Section 3. Fee Standards

(a) Infrastructure user fees, tolls, and charges imposed on transit traffic
shall be:

- (1) **Non-Discriminatory.** No higher than fees for comparable intra-Regional
    traffic using the same infrastructure.

- (2) **Cost-Based.** Related to actual infrastructure costs including
    construction, maintenance, and improvement, but not including general
    revenue generation.

- (3) **Transparent.** Published in advance, applied uniformly, and subject to
    administrative appeal.

(b) **Prohibited Fee Structures.** Regions may not:

- (1) impose fees that vary based on the origin or destination of traffic,
- (2) impose fees designed to discourage transit traffic,
- (3) impose fees substantially exceeding those charged for comparable
    in-Region use,
- (4) impose fees for the primary purpose of generating revenue from
    out-of-Region users.

(c) **Judicial Review.** Fee structures may be challenged in Regional court
with federal backup jurisdiction.

---

## Part II: Dispute Resolution

### Section 11. Expedited Mediation

(a) A Region that believes its transit rights are being violated may request
expedited mediation through the Allocation Review Board.

(b) **Timeline.** The Allocation Review Board shall:

- (1) acknowledge the request within 48 hours,
- (2) convene mediation within seven days,
- (3) issue mediation recommendations within fourteen days.

(c) **Interim Measures.** Pending mediation, the Board may recommend interim
measures to maintain transit access. Regions shall comply with interim
measures in good faith.

(d) **Mediation Failure.** If mediation does not resolve the dispute within
fourteen days, either party may proceed to judicial resolution.

### Section 12. Judicial Resolution

(a) **Regional Courts.** Transit disputes may be filed in the Regional court
of either the complaining Region or the responding Region.

(b) **Federal Backup.** If Regional courts are unavailable, unresponsive, or
biased, the complaining Region may file directly in federal district court.

(c) **Expedited Procedures.** Transit cases shall be expedited:

- (1) hearing within thirty days of filing,
- (2) decision within fourteen days of hearing,
- (3) appeal decided within sixty days.

(d) **Injunctive Relief.** Courts may issue preliminary injunctions to
maintain transit access pending final resolution.

### Section 13. Emergency Relief

(a) In cases of actual or imminent blockade, a Region may seek emergency
injunctive relief without prior mediation.

(b) **Ex Parte Relief.** Ex parte temporary restraining orders may be issued
upon showing of:

- (1) actual or imminent denial of transit access,
- (2) irreparable harm to the complaining Region,
- (3) likelihood of success on the merits.

(c) **Duration.** Ex parte relief expires after seven days unless extended
following a hearing.

## Part III: Federal Enforcement

### Section 21. Enforcement Authority

(a) In cases of imminent or ongoing blockade, the federal government may:

- (1) **Immediate Restoration Order.** Order immediate restoration of transit
    access pending dispute resolution.

- (2) **Sanctions.** Impose civil penalties up to $500,000 per day of
    violation, collectible through federal courts.

    *Note: Per Article X, Section 4 (Anti-Coercion Rule), equalization transfers may not be withheld as an enforcement mechanism.*

- (3) **Operational Control.** Assume temporary operational control of affected
    infrastructure.

(b) **Triggering Events.** Federal enforcement is authorized when:

- (1) a court has issued an order requiring restoration of transit access,
- (2) the Region has failed to comply with the court order within 72 hours, and
- (3) the blockade is causing significant economic harm to other Regions.

### Section 22. Operational Control

(a) **Scope.** Federal operational control is limited to:

- (1) operating the specific infrastructure necessary to restore transit,
- (2) maintaining the infrastructure in safe operating condition,
- (3) collecting cost-based fees to fund operations.

(b) **Duration.** Federal operational control is limited to 180 days,
renewable by court order if the offending Region continues to violate
transit requirements.

(c) **Costs.** The offending Region bears all costs of federal operation,
including administrative overhead.

(d) **Restoration.** Upon compliance with court orders and this Act,
operational control shall be returned immediately.

### Section 23. Sanctions

(a) **Available Sanctions.** For willful violations, sanctions include:

- (1) withholding of discretionary federal infrastructure funds,
- (2) civil penalties up to $50,000 per day of blockade,
- (3) mandatory remediation orders.

*Note: Per Article X, Section 4 (Anti-Coercion Rule), equalization transfers may not be withheld as an enforcement mechanism.*

(b) **Graduated Application.** Sanctions shall be applied in graduated fashion,
beginning with less severe measures and escalating only if compliance is not
achieved.

(c) **Removal.** Sanctions shall be removed immediately upon compliance.

---

## Part IV: Exemptions and Limitations

### Section 31. No Construction Mandate

(a) This Act does not require Regions to build new infrastructure.

(b) This Act requires only that existing infrastructure connecting other
Regions remain accessible.

(c) Regions may decline to expand infrastructure capacity beyond existing
levels, but may not reduce capacity in a manner that effectively denies
transit access.

### Section 32. Legitimate Restrictions

(a) Regions may impose restrictions on transit for legitimate purposes:

- (1) **Public Health.** Quarantine measures during declared health emergencies.
- (2) **Public Safety.** Safety inspections, weight limits, and hazardous
    materials restrictions consistent with national standards.
- (3) **Environmental Protection.** Emissions standards and environmental
    protections consistent with federal floors.

(b) **Non-Pretextual.** Legitimate restrictions must be:

- (1) genuinely motivated by the stated purpose,
- (2) narrowly tailored to achieve the purpose,
- (3) applied uniformly to in-Region and transit traffic.

(c) **Burden of Proof.** The restricting Region bears the burden of proving
that restrictions are legitimate and non-pretextual.

### Section 33. Infrastructure Emergencies

(a) Regions may temporarily restrict transit access during genuine
infrastructure emergencies:

- (1) natural disasters damaging infrastructure,
- (2) accidents requiring emergency repairs,
- (3) security threats to infrastructure.

(b) **Duration.** Emergency restrictions shall be limited to the minimum
duration necessary and shall include reasonable alternative routing if
available.

(c) **Notification.** Affected Regions shall be notified within 24 hours of
emergency restrictions.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Slow-Motion Blockade

**Attack:** A Region allows infrastructure to deteriorate selectively,
making transit practically impossible while claiming no formal blockade.

**Countermeasure:**

- "Unreasonably condition access" includes allowing deterioration (Section 1)
- Capacity reduction prohibition (Section 31(c))
- Federal enforcement available for effective blockade (Section 21)
- Cost-based fee requirement prevents underfunding defense (Section 3)

**Outcome:** Passive deterioration is treated as active blockade; federal
enforcement applies.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Fee Manipulation

**Attack:** A Region imposes nominally cost-based fees that are structured
to effectively price out transit traffic.

**Countermeasure:**

- Non-discrimination requirement (Section 3(a)(1))
- Comparison to in-Region fees (Section 3(b)(3))
- Prohibition on fees designed to discourage transit (Section 3(b)(2))
- Judicial review of fee structures (Section 3(c))

**Outcome:** Manipulative fees are subject to judicial review; discrimination
is prohibited.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Pretextual Safety Restrictions

**Attack:** A Region imposes "safety" restrictions that are actually designed
to block transit from specific Regions.

**Countermeasure:**

- Non-pretextual requirement (Section 32(b))
- Uniform application requirement (Section 32(b)(3))
- Restricting Region bears burden of proof (Section 32(c))
- Expedited judicial review (Section 12(c))

**Outcome:** Pretextual restrictions are prohibited; burden of proof on
restricting Region makes abuse difficult.

---

### Attack Vector 4: Mediation Delay

**Attack:** A Region participates in mediation in bad faith, using the
fourteen-day period to entrench a blockade while appearing cooperative.

**Countermeasure:**

- Fourteen-day limit on mediation (Section 11(b)(3))
- Interim measures maintain access (Section 11(c))
- Emergency relief available without mediation (Section 13)
- Direct judicial filing after mediation failure (Section 11(d))

**Outcome:** Mediation delay is limited; interim measures prevent entrenchment;
emergency relief bypasses mediation for actual blockades.

---

### Attack Vector 5: Federal Enforcement Abuse

**Attack:** The federal government uses enforcement authority to favor
politically aligned Regions or punish opponents.

**Countermeasure:**

- Court finding required before sanctions (Section 21(b))
- Court order required before operational control (Section 21(b)(1))
- 180-day limit with court renewal required (Section 22(b))
- Immediate return upon compliance (Section 22(d))

**Outcome:** Federal enforcement requires judicial authorization; time limits
prevent indefinite occupation; compliance triggers automatic return.

---

### Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| Coordinated multi-Region blockade | Medium | Federal enforcement; national common market power |
| Infrastructure privatization to evade | Low | Constitutional provisions apply regardless of ownership |
| Court delay in emergency | Medium | Ex parte relief; federal backup jurisdiction |
| Political pressure on federal enforcement | Medium | Court-ordered enforcement; mandatory provisions |
