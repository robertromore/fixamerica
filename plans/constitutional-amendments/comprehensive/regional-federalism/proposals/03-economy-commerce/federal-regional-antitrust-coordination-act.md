# Federal-Regional Antitrust Coordination Act

This proposal establishes a clear, coordinated framework for federal and Regional antitrust enforcement to prevent monopolies, promote competition within the national common market, and clarify jurisdictional roles.

---

## Purpose

Establish a Federal-Regional Antitrust Coordination Act that:

- Establishes federal primacy for reviewing mergers and acquisitions with significant inter-regional impact.
- Empowers Regions to enforce their own antitrust laws against conduct that primarily harms consumers or competition within their borders.
- Creates a coordinated framework for investigating and litigating cases against national monopolies.
- Prevents conflicting judicial outcomes and provides legal certainty for businesses operating in the national market.

## Part I: Jurisdictional Allocation

### Section 1. Federal Primacy on Mergers and Acquisitions

(a) The federal government, through the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), shall have primary and exclusive authority to review, approve, or challenge mergers and acquisitions that meet the reporting thresholds of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act or have a significant effect on inter-regional commerce.

(b) A final decision by the DOJ or FTC to approve a merger (or to approve it with conditions) shall preempt any Regional law that would treat the merger itself as illegal.

(c) This section does not preempt a Region's authority to challenge post-merger anticompetitive *conduct* by the newly formed entity that harms consumers within that Region.

### Section 2. Regional Enforcement Authority

(a) Regions may enact and enforce their own antitrust laws regarding anticompetitive conduct, provided such laws are not inconsistent with federal antitrust statutes. Regions may prohibit conduct not prohibited by federal law.

(b) Regional Attorneys General shall have authority to bring enforcement actions under their own laws or federal laws against anticompetitive conduct that primarily harms the residents or market of their Region.

### Section 3. Federal Backstop Authority

(a) The DOJ and FTC retain full authority to enforce federal antitrust laws against any anticompetitive conduct, regardless of its geographic scope.

(b) Federal agencies may intervene in a Regional enforcement action if the proposed remedy or settlement would have significant negative effects on the national market or other Regions.

## Part II: Coordinated Investigations and Enforcement

### Section 11. Federal-Regional Antitrust Task Force

(a) The DOJ and FTC shall establish a permanent "Federal-Regional Antitrust Task Force" to coordinate investigations and litigation against monopolies, cartels, and other anticompetitive conduct with a national scope.

(b) The Task Force shall be co-chaired by the Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division and a Regional Attorney General selected on a rotating basis.

(c) The Task Force shall establish protocols for:
    - (1) Joint investigations and evidence sharing.
    - (2) Allocation of investigative resources.
    - (3) Coordinated litigation or settlement strategies.

### Section 12. Centralized Litigation for National Cases

(a) For antitrust cases involving conduct with a nationwide impact, all related federal and Regional lawsuits may be consolidated into a single federal district court through the multidistrict litigation (MDL) process to ensure consistent rulings.

---

## Part III: Oversight and Dispute Resolution

### Section 21. Antitrust Coordination Council

(a) There is established an "Antitrust Coordination Council" (the "Council").

(b) **Composition.** The Council shall be composed of:
    - (1) The Assistant Attorney General for the Antitrust Division (Co-Chair).
    - (2) The Chair of the FTC (Co-Chair).
    - (3) The Attorney General of each Region.

(c) **Functions.** The Council shall meet at least twice per year to:
    - (1) Discuss enforcement priorities and emerging antitrust issues.
    - (2) Develop best practices for federal-Regional cooperation.
    - (3) Mediate disputes between Regions regarding enforcement actions or settlements that may have cross-border effects.

### Section 22. ARB Jurisdiction for Inter-Regional Disputes

(a) The Allocation Review Board (ARB) shall have jurisdiction to mediate and adjudicate disputes where one Region alleges that another Region's antitrust enforcement action (or lack thereof) is causing direct and significant economic harm to its market, in violation of the `Inter-Regional Commerce and Trade Act`.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Conflicting Enforcement on Mergers

**Attack:** A Region attempts to block a federally-approved merger under its own stricter antitrust laws, creating legal uncertainty and undermining the national market for corporate control.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Federal Primacy (Section 1(b)):** The Act explicitly states that a federal decision to approve a merger preempts Regional laws that would block the merger itself.
- **Federal Court Injunction:** The merged entity or the DOJ could seek an injunction in federal court to block the Region's action based on federal preemption.

**Outcome:** Federal primacy on mergers ensures a single, national standard for such transactions, providing legal certainty. Regions must focus on post-merger conduct.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Regional "Race to the Bottom"

**Attack:** A Region deliberately weakens its own antitrust enforcement to attract large corporations, hoping to become a "haven" for monopolies.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Federal Backstop Authority (Section 3):** The DOJ and FTC retain full authority to enforce federal antitrust laws within that Region, even if the Regional government declines to act.
- **Other Regions' Authority:** Other Regions harmed by the anticompetitive conduct of a company based in the "haven" Region can still bring their own enforcement actions.

**Outcome:** A Region cannot effectively shield a company from antitrust enforcement, as both federal authorities and other affected Regions can still take action.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Federal Negligence

**Attack:** A captured or ideologically motivated federal administration refuses to challenge anticompetitive mergers or conduct, allowing national monopolies to grow unchecked.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Regional Enforcement Authority (Section 2):** Regional Attorneys General are empowered to enforce *federal* antitrust laws, allowing them to step in and act even if federal agencies do not.
- **Private Right of Action:** Existing federal law allowing private parties to sue for antitrust damages remains in effect.

**Outcome:** Federal inaction does not paralyze antitrust enforcement. Regions have the power to act as a crucial check on federal negligence, initiating their own challenges to protect consumers.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Defining "significant effect on inter-regional commerce"** | Medium | DOJ/FTC rulemaking with public comment; judicial precedent will refine over time. |
| **Resource disparities between federal and Regional agencies** | Medium | The Task Force can help coordinate and pool resources for major national cases. |
| **Political pressure on federal merger review** | High | This is a persistent challenge. The ability of Regions to challenge post-merger conduct provides a post-hoc check. |
| **Conflicting remedies in multi-party litigation** | Medium | The MDL process (Section 12) is designed to centralize and coordinate litigation to avoid conflicting outcomes. |
