# National K-12 Education Standards and Mobility Act

This proposal establishes federal floors for K-12 educational standards in core subjects, facilitates student mobility and credit transfer between Regions, and promotes inter-regional collaboration in curriculum development, while respecting Regional autonomy.

---

## Purpose

Establish a framework for National K-12 Education Standards and Mobility that:

- Ensures a baseline of educational attainment for all K-12 students across the nation.
- Facilitates seamless academic transitions for students relocating between Regions.
- Promotes inter-regional collaboration in educational best practices and curriculum development.
- Supports national workforce readiness by addressing inconsistencies in foundational skill sets.
- Balances federal interests in educational quality with Regional autonomy in educational policy.

## Part I: Federal Core Subject Floors and Assessment

### Section 1. Federal Core Subject Floors

(a) The United States Department of Education (USDE) shall, in consultation with Regional education authorities and educational experts, establish minimum national learning standards for core subjects, including:
    - (1) English Language Arts (Reading, Writing, Communication).
    - (2) Mathematics.
    - (3) Science.
    - (4) History and Civics (consistent with the `Federal Digital Literacy and Media Education Program Act`).

(b) These federal core subject floors shall define the knowledge and skills all K-12 public school students are expected to attain at key grade levels.

(c) Regions shall be free to establish and implement educational standards that exceed these federal floors.

### Section 2. National Student Assessment Framework

(a) The USDE shall develop a national assessment framework to measure student proficiency against the federal core subject floors.

(b) This framework shall provide comparable data across Regions on student achievement without mandating a single, uniform curriculum or assessment instrument.

(c) Regions shall administer assessments consistent with this framework and report results to the USDE.

## Part II: Student and Teacher Mobility

### Section 11. Inter-Regional Credit Transfer System

(a) The USDE shall establish a standardized system for the transfer of academic credits and student records between K-12 public schools in different Regions.

(b) Regional education authorities and individual school districts shall accept academic credits and course placements from accredited schools in other Regions, provided the student's prior coursework aligns with the receiving school's curriculum and federal core subject floors.

(c) Disputes regarding credit transfer or placement shall be mediated by the Regional K-12 Education Coordination Council (established in Part III).

### Section 12. Teacher Certification Reciprocity

(a) The USDE shall promote and incentivize inter-regional reciprocity for K-12 teacher certifications.

(b) Regions are encouraged to enter into compacts to recognize teacher certifications from other Regions, provided the certifying Region's standards meet or exceed federal minimums for teacher qualifications.

(c) The USDE may provide grants to Regions that implement full teacher certification reciprocity.

---

## Part III: Coordination and Collaboration

### Section 21. Regional K-12 Education Coordination Council

(a) There is established an "Regional K-12 Education Coordination Council" (the "Council").

(b) **Composition.** The Council shall be composed of:
    - (1) The Secretary of Education (Chair).
    - (2) One representative from each Regional education authority, appointed by the respective Regional Governor.
    - (3) Two members appointed by the President with expertise in K-12 curriculum and assessment.

(c) **Functions.** The Council shall:
    - (1) Share best practices in K-12 education, curriculum development, and instructional strategies.
    - (2) Coordinate on research into effective educational interventions.
    - (3) Mediate disputes between Regions related to K-12 education standards or mobility.
    - (4) Publish an annual report on the state of K-12 education across Regions.

### Section 22. Federal Support for Regional Innovation

(a) The USDE shall provide grants and technical assistance to Regions for:
    - (1) Developing innovative educational programs that exceed federal floors.
    - (2) Implementing evidence-based practices to improve student outcomes.
    - (3) Addressing educational disparities and supporting underserved student populations.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Federal Curriculum Mandate

**Attack:** A federal administration attempts to use the federal core subject floors or assessment framework to impose a national curriculum, undermining Regional autonomy.

**Countermeasure:**

- **"Minimum Standards" (Section 1(a)):** The Act explicitly establishes *minimum* standards, allowing Regions to exceed them and develop their own curricula.
- **"Without Mandating a Single Curriculum" (Section 2(b)):** The assessment framework is designed for comparable data, not curriculum dictation.
- **Regional Autonomy (Purpose Statement):** The Act explicitly balances federal interests with Regional autonomy.
- **Council Composition (Section 21(b)):** Regional representatives on the Council provide a check against federal overreach.

**Outcome:** The Act is carefully worded to prevent federal curriculum mandates, preserving Regional control over educational content above the established floors.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Obstruction of Student Mobility

**Attack:** A Region or school district creates arbitrary barriers to credit transfer or student placement, making it difficult for students relocating from other Regions to integrate academically.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Standardized System (Section 11(a)):** The USDE establishes a clear, binding system for credit transfer.
- **Mandatory Acceptance (Section 11(b)):** Accredited schools are legally required to accept applicable credits.
- **Council Mediation (Section 11(c)):** The Regional K-12 Education Coordination Council mediates disputes.
- **Judicial Review:** Families could challenge arbitrary denials in federal court.

**Outcome:** Arbitrary obstruction is prohibited and subject to federal oversight and judicial challenge, ensuring student mobility.

---

### Attack Vector 3: "Race to the Bottom" on Teacher Qualifications

**Attack:** A Region lowers its teacher certification standards significantly to address shortages, potentially allowing unqualified teachers to practice, and then demands reciprocity from other Regions.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Federal Minimums for Certification (Section 12(b)):** Reciprocity is conditioned on the certifying Region's standards meeting or exceeding federal minimums.
- **USDE Oversight:** The USDE can review and challenge Regional certification standards that fall below federal minimums.
- **Professional Licensing Bodies:** Independent professional bodies may also exert pressure for quality.

**Outcome:** While Regions have flexibility, federal minimums prevent a complete race to the bottom on teacher qualifications, ensuring a baseline of quality for the teaching profession.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Defining "core subjects" and "minimum standards" objectively** | Medium | USDE rulemaking with public comment; expert panels; periodic review and updates. |
| **Funding disparities impacting Regional ability to meet floors** | High | Federal grants (Section 22); Fiscal Equalization Act provides broader support for Regional capacity. |
| **Political resistance to national assessment framework** | Medium | Focus on data for improvement, not punitive measures; emphasize comparability over competition. |
| **Teacher shortages in specific subjects or Regions** | High | Federal incentives for teacher training and retention; targeted grants for high-need areas. |
