# National Disability Rights and Accessibility Act

This proposal establishes comprehensive federal floors for disability rights, accessibility standards, and coordinated services, ensuring full and equitable participation for people with disabilities across all Regions.

---

## Purpose

Establish a framework for National Disability Rights and Accessibility that:

-   Sets federal minimum standards for physical, digital, and programmatic accessibility.
-   Coordinates essential services for people with disabilities across Regional boundaries.
-   Ensures consistent and robust protections and access across the entire federation.
-   Fosters inclusion and prevents disparities based on Regional residence.
-   Builds upon and adapts existing federal disability laws (e.g., ADA) to the Regional Federalism model.

## Part I: Federal Accessibility Standards

### Section 1. Federal Accessibility Floors

(a) The Department of Justice (DOJ), in coordination with the U.S. Access Board, shall establish and enforce federal minimum accessibility standards for:
    - (1) **Physical Infrastructure:** Public accommodations, commercial facilities, and transportation, consistent with and expanding upon the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
    - (2) **Digital Platforms:** Websites and mobile applications of federal, Regional, and local governments, and of public accommodations, must conform to the latest Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), Level AA.
    - (3) **Programmatic Access:** Public services and programs must be accessible to people with disabilities, including provision of reasonable accommodations and modifications.

(b) **Regional Authority.** Regions may establish and enforce accessibility standards that exceed these federal floors.

### Section 2. Enforcement

(a) The DOJ shall retain primary authority to enforce these federal floors.

(b) Individuals shall retain a private right of action to sue for violations of these standards in federal court.

## Part II: Inter-Regional Service Coordination

### Section 11. Portability of Services and Eligibility

(a) **Eligibility Transfer.** A determination of eligibility for federal or federally-funded disability services (e.g., vocational rehabilitation, certain Medicaid waivers) made in one Region shall be recognized in all other Regions, subject to any Region-specific income or resource limits.

(b) **Continuity of Care.** Regions shall establish procedures to ensure continuity of services for individuals with disabilities relocating from another Region, preventing gaps in essential support.

### Section 12. Specialized Service Coordination

(a) Regions are encouraged to form "Disability Service Compacts" to coordinate the provision of highly specialized services that may be geographically concentrated (e.g., centers for rare disabilities, specialized rehabilitation hospitals).

(b) These compacts shall facilitate inter-regional referrals and payment for services, ensuring access for residents of Regions without such specialized centers.

### Section 13. Assistive Technology Coordination

(a) The federal government shall support a national network of assistive technology resource centers.

(b) Regions shall coordinate on bulk purchasing and lending library programs for assistive technology to reduce costs and improve access.

---

## Part III: Employment and Economic Opportunity

### Section 21. Vocational Rehabilitation Floors

(a) The Department of Education shall establish federal floors for vocational rehabilitation (VR) services provided by Regions.

(b) These floors shall include minimum standards for assessment, counseling, training, and job placement services.

### Section 22. Employment Incentives

(a) The federal government shall provide tax incentives and grants to employers who meet or exceed federal goals for hiring, retaining, and promoting employees with disabilities.

(b) This shall be coordinated with the `Inter-Regional Workforce Development and Labor Mobility Act` to ensure alignment with national workforce strategy.

---

## Part IV: Data and Oversight

### Section 31. National Disability Data System

(a) The federal government shall establish a "National Disability Data System" to collect and analyze anonymized data on:
    - (1) Disability prevalence and demographics.
    - (2) Service utilization and unmet needs.
    - (3) Employment rates and economic status.
    - (4) Accessibility compliance and barriers.

(b) Data shall be used to inform policy, allocate resources, and monitor equity across Regions.

### Section 32. National Disability Rights Council

(a) There is established a "National Disability Rights Council" (the "Council").

(b) **Composition.** The Council shall be composed of:
    - (1) The Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights (Chair).
    - (2) Representatives from HHS, HUD, and the Department of Labor.
    - (3) One representative from each Regional disability rights agency.
    - (4) A majority of members from the disability community, representing diverse disabilities, appointed by the President.

(c) **Functions.** The Council shall:
    - (1) Advise on the implementation and enforcement of this Act.
    - (2) Mediate disputes between Regions regarding service coordination.
    - (3) Publish an annual report on the state of disability rights and access across the nation.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Regional "Race to the Bottom"

**Attack:** A Region attempts to attract businesses by offering lax enforcement of accessibility standards or by providing minimal disability services, creating a "race to the bottom."

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Federal Floors (Section 1):** The Act establishes binding federal minimum standards for accessibility, preventing Regions from falling below a national baseline.
-   **Federal Enforcement (Section 2):** The DOJ retains primary enforcement authority, ensuring a consistent backstop against Regional non-compliance.
-   **Private Right of Action (Section 2(b)):** Individuals can sue for non-compliance in federal court, bypassing Regional inaction.

**Outcome:** Federal floors and enforcement mechanisms prevent Regions from competing by eroding fundamental disability rights and accessibility.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Federal Overreach

**Attack:** A federal administration uses its authority to establish standards that are overly prescriptive, creating a "ceiling" that stifles Regional innovation in disability services or accessibility.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Explicit "Floors, Not Ceilings" Language (Section 1(b)):** The Act explicitly preserves the right of Regions to enact stricter standards.
-   **Council Composition (Section 32(b)):** The Council, with strong Regional and community representation, provides a check on federal overreach in policymaking.
-   **Judicial Review:** Federal regulations are subject to judicial review to ensure they are consistent with the Act's "floor" principle.

**Outcome:** The statutory language and council structure are designed to ensure the federal role is focused on establishing a baseline, not dictating all aspects of disability policy.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Gaps in Service Portability

**Attack:** An individual with disabilities moves to a new Region and loses access to essential services due to bureaucratic hurdles, differing eligibility criteria, or lack of provider networks.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Mandatory Eligibility Transfer (Section 11(a)):** A determination of eligibility for federal programs in one Region must be recognized by others.
-   **Continuity of Care Mandate (Section 11(b)):** Regions are required to have procedures to prevent gaps in service.
-   **Disability Service Compacts (Section 12):** Encourages formal agreements to streamline inter-regional care.
-   **Council Mediation (Section 32(c)):** The Council can mediate disputes between Regions over service coordination.

**Outcome:** The Act creates multiple mechanisms to ensure that essential services and eligibility are portable, reducing the risk of individuals falling through the cracks when they move.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Funding for services and enforcement** | High | Requires sustained federal and Regional appropriations; linking federal funds to compliance. |
| **Defining "reasonable accommodation"** | Medium | Continued reliance on judicial precedent; guidance from the Council and DOJ. |
| **Access to specialized services in rural areas** | Medium | Telehealth expansion; funding for regional centers of excellence through compacts. |
| **Digital accessibility for emerging technologies** | High | Regular updates to WCAG standards; proactive rulemaking by DOJ. |
