# Inter-Regional Child Welfare Coordination Act

This proposal establishes a federal-Regional framework to ensure the safety, permanency, and well-being of children in the child welfare system as they or their families move across Regional boundaries.

---

## Purpose

Establish a framework for Inter-Regional Child Welfare Coordination that:

- Ensures the safety, permanency, and well-being of children across Regional lines.
- Modernizes and strengthens the process for placing children with families in other Regions.
- Establishes federal minimum standards (floors) for child welfare services.
- Facilitates seamless data sharing and case management for children and families moving between Regions.
- Provides federal funding to support inter-regional placements and coordination.

## Part I: National Child Welfare Data System

### Section 1. Establishment of National Child Welfare Data System (NCWDS)

(a) The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) shall establish and maintain a secure, interoperable "National Child Welfare Data System" (NCWDS).

(b) The NCWDS shall serve as a central repository for de-identified data on children in foster care, adoptions, and child protective services investigations across all Regions.

### Section 2. Data Elements and Interoperability

(a) The NCWDS shall include, but not be limited to, data on:
    - (1) Child demographics, placement history, and permanency outcomes.
    - (2) Case management information, including service plans and court orders.
    - (3) Background check results for prospective caregivers.

(b) HHS shall establish data standards and interoperability requirements for Regional child welfare information systems.

(c) Federal funding for Regional child welfare programs shall be conditioned on compliance with NCWDS data reporting and interoperability standards.

### Section 3. Privacy and Security

(a) All data in the NCWDS shall be de-identified to the greatest extent possible.

(b) Data shall be used solely for child welfare case management, oversight, research, and policy development.

(c) The system shall adhere to robust privacy and security safeguards, consistent with the `Inter-Regional Consumer Protection and Data Privacy Act`.

## Part II: Inter-Regional Placement and Case Management

### Section 11. Modernization of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC)

(a) The Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children (ICPC) is hereby modernized and strengthened to establish binding, enforceable timelines for approving inter-regional placements of children.

(b) **Timelines.** Regional ICPC offices shall approve or deny placement requests within 30 days for relative placements and 60 days for non-relative foster or adoptive placements.

(c) **Dispute Resolution.** Disputes regarding ICPC compliance or delays shall be mediated by the Inter-Regional Child Welfare Council (established in Part IV).

### Section 12. Background Check Portability

(a) Background checks (including criminal history, child abuse and neglect registries) for prospective foster, adoptive, or kinship caregivers conducted in one Region shall be recognized and accepted by all other Regions, provided they meet federal minimum standards.

(b) HHS shall establish federal minimum standards for background checks, including requirements for fingerprint-based FBI checks and searches of all available state and Regional child abuse and neglect registries.

### Section 13. Case Transfer and Continuity

(a) When a child or family receiving child welfare services relocates to another Region, the sending and receiving Regions shall coordinate a seamless transfer of the case, ensuring continuity of services and legal oversight.

(b) The NCWDS shall facilitate the electronic transfer of case files and relevant court orders.

## Part III: Federal Floors and Funding

### Section 21. Federal Child Welfare Floors

(a) HHS shall establish federal minimum standards ("floors") for child welfare services in each Region.

(b) These floors shall include, but not be limited to:
    - (1) Minimum training requirements for child welfare caseworkers.
    - (2) Maximum caseload limits for caseworkers.
    - (3) Protocols for child safety assessments and ongoing monitoring.
    - (4) Standards for foster care licensing and placement quality.

(c) **Regional Flexibility.** Regions may establish and enforce child welfare standards that exceed these federal floors.

### Section 22. Federal Funding for Inter-Regional Placements

(a) There is established a "Federal Inter-Regional Placement Fund" within HHS.

(b) The Fund shall provide dedicated federal matching funds to Regions to cover the administrative and travel costs associated with:
    - (1) Conducting home studies and post-placement supervision for children placed across Regional lines.
    - (2) Facilitating travel for children to visit prospective placements or maintain family connections across Regions.

(c) This funding is intended to remove financial barriers to placing children with suitable family members or in appropriate homes in other Regions.

---

## Part IV: Oversight and Coordination

### Section 31. Inter-Regional Child Welfare Council

(a) There is established an "Inter-Regional Child Welfare Council" (the "Council").

(b) **Composition.** The Council shall be composed of:
    - (1) The Assistant Secretary for Children and Families (Chair).
    - (2) One representative from each Regional child welfare agency.
    - (3) Two members representing national child advocacy organizations, appointed by the President.
    - (4) Two members representing foster and adoptive parent associations, appointed by Congress.

(c) **Functions.** The Council shall:
    - (1) Advise HHS on the development and implementation of federal child welfare floors and NCWDS standards.
    - (2) Facilitate inter-regional collaboration and share best practices.
    - (3) Mediate disputes between Regions regarding child welfare matters, including ICPC compliance.
    - (4) Publish an annual report on the state of child welfare across the nation.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Regional "Race to the Bottom" on Child Safety

**Attack:** A Region lowers its child welfare standards (e.g., increasing caseworker caseloads, reducing training) to cut costs, potentially endangering children.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Federal Child Welfare Floors (Section 21):** Establishes binding federal minimum standards for caseworker training, caseloads, and safety protocols.
- **Conditional Federal Funding (Section 2(c)):** Federal funding for Regional child welfare programs is conditioned on compliance with these floors.
- **Council Oversight (Section 31(c)):** The Council monitors and reports on Regional compliance, creating public pressure.

**Outcome:** Regions cannot legally fall below federal minimum standards for child safety and well-being without risking federal funding and public scrutiny.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Obstruction of Inter-Regional Placements

**Attack:** A Regional ICPC office deliberately delays or denies placement requests from other Regions, citing minor administrative issues, to keep children within its own system or avoid costs.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Binding Timelines (Section 11(b)):** The modernized ICPC establishes strict, enforceable timelines for placement decisions.
- **Council Mediation (Section 11(c)):** The Inter-Regional Child Welfare Council can mediate and resolve disputes over delays.
- **Federal Funding (Section 22):** Dedicated federal funding removes financial disincentives for inter-regional placements.
- **Judicial Review:** Persistent, unjustified delays could be challenged in federal court.

**Outcome:** The Act creates strong incentives and mechanisms to prevent arbitrary obstruction of inter-regional child placements, prioritizing the child's best interest.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Data Sharing Failures

**Attack:** A Region refuses to share critical child welfare data with the NCWDS, citing privacy concerns, thereby hindering effective case management and oversight for mobile children.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Mandatory Reporting (Section 2(c)):** Federal funding for Regional child welfare programs is conditioned on compliance with NCWDS data reporting standards.
- **Purpose Limitation and Privacy (Section 3):** The Act explicitly limits data use to child welfare purposes and mandates robust privacy protections, addressing legitimate concerns.
- **Interoperability Requirements (Section 2(b)):** Ensures technical compatibility for data exchange.

**Outcome:** While privacy is paramount, the Act balances it with the need for data sharing for child protection, making non-compliance costly and difficult to justify.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Funding shortfalls for child welfare services** | High | Requires sustained federal and Regional appropriations; advocacy from child welfare organizations. |
| **Complexity of harmonizing diverse Regional legal frameworks** | Medium | The Council can develop model laws and best practices; federal technical assistance. |
| **Shortage of qualified child welfare professionals** | High | Federal and Regional workforce development programs; loan forgiveness for public service. |
| **Defining "best interest of the child" consistently** | Medium | Council guidance; judicial precedent; emphasis on evidence-based practices. |
