# Inter-Regional Healthcare Coordination Act

This proposal establishes a framework for coordinating healthcare policy, insurance markets, and patient care across Regional boundaries, ensuring a balance between Regional innovation and national standards for access, quality, and data portability.

---

## Purpose

Establish a framework for Inter-Regional Healthcare Coordination that:

- Ensures a balance between Regional innovation in healthcare delivery and minimum national standards for access and quality.
- Guarantees patient data portability and the right of citizens to access care, regardless of their location or movement between Regions.
- Prevents economic protectionism in healthcare services and insurance markets.
- Provides clear rules for the interaction of federal healthcare programs with diverse Regional systems.

## Part I: National Healthcare Floors and Interoperability

### Section 1. Patient Data Portability

(a) **National Standard.** The Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) shall, within two years of this Act's passage, establish and enforce a national standard for Electronic Health Record (EHR) interoperability, utilizing open standards and APIs.

(b) **Mandatory Adoption.** All healthcare providers, provider networks, and health insurers operating within the United States shall adopt this standard.

(c) **Patient Right of Access.** Every citizen has the right to access their complete health record in a machine-readable, portable format at no cost and to direct its transmission to any provider or entity of their choosing.

(d) **Enforcement.** HHS is authorized to levy significant financial penalties for "data blocking" or any practice that unreasonably limits the availability, exchange, or use of electronic health information.

### Section 2. Telehealth Federal Floor

(a) **Authorization.** Consistent with the `Interstate Professional Licensing Reciprocity Act`, a healthcare provider holding a valid license in any Region is authorized to provide telehealth services to a patient located in any other Region.

(b) **Standard of Care.** The provider shall be subject to the laws and regulations regarding the professional standard of care of the Region where the *patient* is located at the time of service.

(c) **Reimbursement.** No health plan or federal program may deny or diminish payment for a covered service based solely on the geographic location of the provider, provided the service meets the applicable standard of care.

### Section 3. Cross-Regional Care Protocols

(a) **Emergency Care.** All Regional health insurance plans (public and private) and federal health programs must cover medically necessary emergency care received in any Region at the in-network rate, without requiring prior authorization. The definition of "emergency" shall be based on a prudent layperson standard.

(b) **Specialized Care.** A framework shall be established for the pre-authorization and coordination of payment for non-emergency specialized care sought in another Region. Such authorization may not be denied if the proposed care is medically necessary and is either unavailable or of a demonstrably lower clinical standard in the patient's home Region.

## Part II: Inter-Regional Insurance and Federal Programs

### Section 11. Inter-Regional Health Insurance

(a) **Compacts.** Regions are authorized to form "Healthcare Compacts" to create unified health insurance markets. Insurers licensed in one member Region of a compact may sell plans in any other member Region.

(b) **Federal Floors.** Any such compact must ensure that all participating plans meet minimum federal consumer protection floors (e.g., prohibitions on pre-existing condition exclusions, essential health benefit requirements). The federal HHS Secretary must certify that any compact meets these minimum standards.

### Section 12. Federal Program Interface

(a) **Uniformity.** Federal healthcare programs, including Medicare, VA, and TRICARE, shall ensure that beneficiaries can access covered services in any Region without penalty or disparate coverage.

(b) **Rate Adjustments.** The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) shall establish uniform methodologies for adjusting reimbursement rates based on Regional cost-of-living and service cost indices, developed in consultation with the Independent Fiscal Council.

---

## Part III: Oversight and Coordination

### Section 21. Inter-Regional Healthcare Coordination Council

(a) **Establishment.** There is established an "Inter-Regional Healthcare Coordination Council" (the "Council").

(b) **Composition.** The Council shall be composed of:
    - (1) The federal Secretary of Health and Human Services (as Chair).
    - (2) The head of each Regional health authority.
    - (3) Three non-voting members representing patient advocacy groups, appointed by the President.
    - (4) Three non-voting members representing healthcare provider organizations, appointed by Congress.

(c) **Functions.** The Council shall mediate disputes between Regions, oversee the implementation of this Act, publish data on inter-regional healthcare costs and quality, and make recommendations to Congress and Regions on improving coordination.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Regional Protectionism

**Attack:** A Region enacts subtle, facially neutral regulations (e.g., unique administrative reporting requirements, specific IT platform mandates) designed to make it prohibitively expensive or complex for out-of-region telehealth providers or insurers to operate.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Effects Test:** The Act prohibits regulations whose primary *effect* is to discriminate against out-of-region economic actors, even if the intent is not explicit.
- **Council Mediation:** The Inter-Regional Healthcare Coordination Council is empowered to investigate such claims and issue binding mediation orders.
- **Judicial Review:** Council decisions and Regional regulations can be challenged in federal court for violating the principles of this Act.

**Outcome:** While nuisance regulations are possible, the effects test and the availability of mediation and judicial review provide a strong check against systemic protectionism.

---

### Attack Vector 2: "Race to the Bottom" in Insurance Standards

**Attack:** A Healthcare Compact is formed with very low consumer protection standards to attract insurers, who then offer inadequate, "junk" plans that are sold across multiple Regions.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Federal Floors:** Section 11(b) requires all compacts to adhere to minimum federal consumer protection floors, preventing a race to the bottom on core standards.
- **HHS Certification:** The federal HHS Secretary must certify that any compact meets these minimum standards before it can take effect, providing a federal backstop.

**Outcome:** Regional innovation is permitted, but only above a federally guaranteed baseline of quality and consumer protection.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Data Blocking via "Privacy" Pretext

**Attack:** Large hospital systems or EHR vendors resist implementing open data standards, citing proprietary concerns or an overly strict interpretation of privacy laws as a pretext to block the seamless transfer of patient data, thereby locking in patients and providers.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Mandated Open Standards:** Section 1(a) mandates the use of open standards and APIs, making proprietary lock-in difficult.
- **Clear Patient Ownership:** Section 1(c) clarifies that the patient owns the data and has the right to direct its transmission, overriding provider or vendor preference.
- **Financial Penalties:** Section 1(d) authorizes significant, targeted fines specifically for data blocking, creating a strong financial disincentive.

**Outcome:** The combination of mandated open standards, clear patient rights, and stiff penalties for non-compliance makes data blocking a high-risk, low-reward strategy.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Complexity of Payment Rate Coordination** | Medium | The Council can publish best practices and data to facilitate negotiations between private insurers and providers across Regions. |
| **Defining "Medically Necessary" Specialized Care** | Medium | Council can develop advisory guidelines and best practices; disputes ultimately resolved through an appeals process and, if necessary, courts. |
| **Power of Incumbent Insurers/Providers** | High | Strong federal antitrust enforcement; transparency requirements on pricing and ownership; support for new market entrants via compacts. |
