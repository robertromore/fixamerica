## Part I: Inter-Regional Housing Compacts and Planning

### Section 1. Authorization of Housing Compacts

(a) Regions are authorized to form "Inter-Regional Housing Compacts" (IRHCs) under the `Interregional Agency Compact Act` to coordinate housing strategies and urban development in shared metropolitan areas or economically integrated corridors.

(b) IRHCs shall be governed by a board with representation from participating Regions and federal housing agencies.

### Section 2. Scope of Compacts

(a) IRHCs may address, but are not limited to, the following areas:
    - (1) **Affordable Housing Targets:** Setting inter-regional goals for affordable housing production and preservation.
    - (2) **Zoning and Land Use:** Developing model zoning ordinances or regional planning guidelines to promote housing diversity and density.
    - (3) **Infrastructure Planning:** Coordinating housing development with transportation, water, and other essential infrastructure.
    - (4) **Housing Data Sharing:** Harmonizing data collection and sharing on housing needs, supply, and affordability.

### Section 3. Federal Support for Compacts

(a) The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) shall provide grants and technical assistance to Regions and IRHCs for the planning, development, and implementation of inter-regional housing and urban development initiatives.

(b) Federal funding shall prioritize compacts that demonstrate:
    - (1) Clear strategies to increase affordable housing supply.
    - (2) Coordinated planning across jurisdictional boundaries.
    - (3) Measurable outcomes in reducing housing insecurity and promoting equitable development.

## Part II: Federal Affordable Housing Floors

### Section 11. Establishment of Federal Floors

(a) HUD shall establish minimum federal standards for affordable housing provision, ensuring a baseline of housing access across the nation.

(b) These federal floors shall include:
    - (1) Minimum percentage of new development designated as affordable.
    - (2) Protections against source-of-income discrimination.
    - (3) Basic habitability standards for all rental housing.

(c) **Regional Flexibility.** Regions may establish and enforce affordable housing standards that exceed these federal floors.

### Section 12. Funding Linkage

(a) Compliance with federal affordable housing floors shall be a condition for Regions to receive federal housing and urban development funds.

(b) HUD shall provide technical assistance and capacity-building grants to Regions to assist them in meeting these federal floors.

---

## Part III: Homelessness Coordination

### Section 21. Inter-Regional Homelessness Council

(a) There is established an "Inter-Regional Homelessness Council" (IRHC-H) within HUD, composed of federal and Regional representatives.

(b) The IRHC-H shall facilitate coordination of strategies to address homelessness, particularly for mobile populations that frequently cross Regional boundaries.

### Section 22. Data Sharing and Best Practices

(a) HUD shall establish a national system for collecting and sharing anonymized data on homelessness, including demographics, service utilization, and housing outcomes.

(b) Regions shall report standardized data to this system and shall collaborate on identifying and disseminating best practices for homelessness prevention and intervention.

### Section 23. Prevention and Service Provision

(a) Regions shall coordinate efforts to provide services and housing solutions for individuals experiencing homelessness, ensuring continuity of care and access to resources regardless of Regional origin.

(b) Federal grants shall prioritize inter-regional initiatives that address the unique challenges of mobile homeless populations.

---

## Part IV: Federal Housing Data System

### Section 31. National Housing Data System

(a) HUD shall establish and maintain a "National Housing Data System" (NHDS) to collect, analyze, and disseminate comprehensive data on housing needs, affordability, and development across all Regions.

(b) Data elements shall include, but not be limited to:
    - (1) Housing stock inventory and vacancy rates.
    - (2) Rental and homeownership affordability metrics.
    - (3) Housing production and permitting data.
    - (4) Demographics of housing-insecure populations.

### Section 32. Regional Data Reporting and Interoperability

(a) Regional housing authorities shall report standardized housing data to the NHDS on a quarterly basis.

(b) HUD shall establish data standards and interoperability requirements for Regional housing information systems.

---

## Part V: Oversight and Coordination

### Section 41. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Role

(a) HUD shall be the lead federal agency responsible for implementing this Act, including:
    - (1) Promulgating regulations to establish federal floors and data standards.
    - (2) Administering federal grants and technical assistance programs.
    - (3) Providing oversight and ensuring compliance with this Act.

### Section 42. Dispute Resolution

(a) Disputes between Regions regarding inter-regional housing compacts or compliance with this Act shall be mediated by the Allocation Review Board (ARB).

(b) ARB determinations are subject to expedited judicial review in federal court.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Regional Resistance to Federal Floors

**Attack:** A Region claims federal affordable housing floors infringe on local zoning authority and refuses to comply, citing "local control."

**Countermeasure:**

- **Conditional Federal Funding (Section 12(a)):** Federal housing and urban development funds are conditioned on compliance, creating a strong financial incentive.
- **Federal Supremacy:** Federal floors are established under federal enumerated powers (e.g., general welfare, commerce clause) and are supreme.
- **ARB Mediation (Section 42(a)):** Disputes can be mediated by the ARB, with judicial review as a backstop.

**Outcome:** While Regions retain flexibility to exceed floors, non-compliance with federal minimums carries significant financial and legal consequences.

---

### Attack Vector 2: "Not In My Backyard" (NIMBY) Obstruction

**Attack:** Local governments within a Region use restrictive zoning, excessive permitting delays, or other tactics to block affordable housing projects, undermining inter-regional compacts or federal floors.

**Countermeasure:**

- **IRHC Authority (Section 1(a)):** Inter-Regional Housing Compacts can develop regional planning guidelines that supersede local obstruction for projects meeting regional needs.
- **Federal Floors (Section 11(b)(1)):** Minimum percentages for affordable housing production can be enforced at the Regional level, requiring Regions to address local obstruction.
- **Urban Planning Coordination (Part I):** Supports inter-regional planning organizations that can override local obstruction for projects of regional significance.

**Outcome:** While local input is respected, systematic NIMBY obstruction can be overridden by regional compacts or federal requirements when addressing inter-regional housing needs.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Data Manipulation/Underreporting

**Attack:** A Region underreports housing needs or overreports affordable housing production to avoid federal requirements or hide persistent issues.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Standardized Data (Section 31(a)):** The NHDS establishes national standards for data collection, making manipulation more difficult.
- **Interoperability Requirements (Section 32(b)):** Ensures data systems can be cross-referenced and audited.
- **Federal Audits:** HUD can conduct audits of Regional data reporting for accuracy and completeness.
- **Conditional Funding (Section 12(a)):** Federal funding can be withheld for non-compliance with data reporting standards.

**Outcome:** While some data manipulation is always possible, standardized reporting, interoperability, and federal audits create strong disincentives for systematic underreporting.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Political will for sustained federal funding** | High | Requires sustained Congressional appropriations; advocacy from housing and urban development groups. |
| **Complexity of harmonizing diverse Regional zoning and land use laws** | Medium | Federal model ordinances; technical assistance; phased implementation; focus on incentives over mandates. |
| **Resistance from local governments to regional planning** | Medium | Federal grants conditioned on participation in IRHCs; demonstration of benefits of coordinated planning. |
| **Defining "affordable" and "homelessness" consistently across Regions** | Medium | HUD rulemaking with public comment; expert panels; periodic review and updates. |
