# Social Safety Net Coordination Act

This proposal establishes a coordinated federal-Regional framework for the administration of social safety net programs, defining the allocation of responsibility and ensuring benefit portability and federal minimum standards.

---

## Purpose

Establish a framework for Social Safety Net Coordination that:

- Defines clear allocation of responsibility for core social insurance and welfare programs between federal and Regional governments.
- Ensures benefit portability for citizens who move between Regions, preventing loss of critical support.
- Establishes federal minimum standards (floors) for eligibility, benefit levels, and duration for devolved programs.
- Clarifies funding mechanisms, distinguishing between federally-funded, Regionally-funded, and shared-cost programs.
- Creates a secure framework for data sharing between federal and Regional agencies to verify eligibility and prevent fraud.

## Part I: Program Allocation and Federal Floors

### Section 1. Exclusively Federal Programs

(a) The following social safety net programs shall be exclusively federal, administered and funded by the federal government:
    - (1) **Social Security:** Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI).
    - (2) **Medicare:** Federal health insurance for the elderly and disabled.
    - (3) **Federal Employee Retirement Systems:** Retirement and health benefits for federal employees.

(b) These programs shall operate uniformly across all Regions, with eligibility and benefits determined solely by federal law.

### Section 2. Regional Programs with Federal Floors

(a) The following social safety net programs shall be primarily administered by Regions, subject to federal minimum standards (floors):
    - (1) **Unemployment Insurance (UI):** Benefits for unemployed workers.
    - (2) **Food Assistance:** Programs such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
    - (3) **Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF):** Cash assistance and work support.
    - (4) **Medicaid:** Health insurance for low-income individuals and families.
    - (5) **Child Care Assistance:** Subsidies and support for child care.

(b) **Federal Floors.** For programs listed in subsection(a), the federal government shall establish minimum standards for:
    - (1) **Eligibility:** Basic criteria for program access.
    - (2) **Benefit Levels:** Minimum benefit amounts (e.g., as a percentage of the federal poverty line or Regional median income).
    - (3) **Duration:** Minimum periods for which benefits must be available.

(c) **Regional Authority.** Regions may establish eligibility criteria, benefit levels, and durations that exceed federal floors, but may not fall below them.

### Section 3. Federal Poverty Line and Cost-of-Living Adjustments

(a) The federal poverty line shall be adjusted annually for Regional cost-of-living differences, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in consultation with the Independent Fiscal Council.

(b) Federal floors for benefit levels shall be based on these Regionally-adjusted poverty lines.

---

## Part II: Benefit Portability

### Section 11. Unemployment Insurance Portability

(a) **National System.** The Department of Labor shall establish a national system to ensure that UI benefits and eligibility are fully portable for citizens who move between Regions.

(b) **Inter-Regional Claims.** An individual who has earned UI eligibility in one Region shall be able to file for and receive benefits in any other Region, subject to the federal floors and the receiving Region's higher standards.

(c) **Benefit Calculation.** Benefits shall be calculated based on the individual's earnings history across all Regions, and paid by the Region where the claim is filed, with inter-regional reimbursement as established by federal regulation.

### Section 12. Food Assistance Portability

(a) **Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT).** EBT cards for food assistance shall be interoperable across all Regions, allowing beneficiaries to use their benefits in any Region.

(b) **Eligibility Transfer.** When a beneficiary moves to a new Region, their eligibility shall transfer seamlessly, with the receiving Region assuming administrative responsibility and applying its own (or federal floor) benefit levels.

### Section 13. Medicaid Portability

(a) **Seamless Enrollment.** The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) shall establish a system for seamless enrollment and transfer of Medicaid eligibility for beneficiaries moving between Regions.

(b) **Coverage Continuity.** Beneficiaries shall maintain continuous coverage during inter-regional transfers, with no gaps in access to medically necessary services.

---

## Part III: Funding Mechanisms

### Section 21. Federal Funding for Exclusively Federal Programs

(a) Exclusively federal programs (Social Security, Medicare) shall be funded entirely by federal taxes and contributions.

### Section 22. Shared-Cost Programs with Federal Matching

(a) For Regional programs with federal floors (UI, SNAP, TANF, Medicaid, Child Care Assistance), the federal government shall provide matching funds to Regions.

(b) **Matching Formulas.** Federal matching formulas shall:
    - (1) Be designed to incentivize Regions to meet and exceed federal floors.
    - (2) Include an enhanced federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) for Medicaid, with higher matching rates for Regions with lower fiscal capacity (consistent with the `Fiscal Equalization Act`).

(c) **Anti-Coercion.** Federal matching funds may not be conditioned on Regional adoption of policies unrelated to the specific program's federal floors, consistent with Article X, Section 4 (Anti-Coercion Rule).

### Section 23. Regional Funding

(a) Regions shall be responsible for funding their share of shared-cost programs and for any benefits or services provided above federal floors.

---

## Part IV: Data Sharing and Administration

### Section 31. Secure Data Sharing Framework

(a) The federal government shall establish a secure, interoperable data sharing framework to facilitate the exchange of information between federal and Regional agencies for the administration of social safety net programs.

(b) **Purpose Limitation.** Data shared through this framework shall be used solely for verifying eligibility, calculating benefits, preventing fraud, and program evaluation.

(c) **Privacy Protections.** The framework shall incorporate robust privacy protections, including:
    - (1) Data minimization.
    - (2) Encryption in transit and at rest.
    - (3) Access controls and audit trails.
    - (4) Strict penalties for unauthorized access or misuse.

### Section 32. Inter-Regional Data Exchange

(a) Regional agencies shall participate in the federal data sharing framework to ensure seamless benefit portability and accurate program administration.

(b) The federal government shall provide technical assistance and funding to Regions to upgrade their data systems to meet interoperability and security standards.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Regional "Race to the Bottom" on Benefits

**Attack:** Regions reduce benefits or tighten eligibility to attract businesses or reduce costs, undermining the national safety net.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Federal Floors (Section 2(b)):** Explicit federal minimums for eligibility, benefit levels, and duration prevent any Region from falling below a basic standard.
- **Regionally-Adjusted Poverty Line (Section 3(a)):** Ensures federal floors are meaningful and responsive to local economic realities.
- **Anti-Coercion Rule (Section 22(c)):** Prevents federal government from forcing Regions to lower standards.

**Outcome:** Regions retain flexibility to innovate and provide higher benefits, but cannot undermine the basic safety net for their residents.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Benefit Inportability

**Attack:** Citizens lose access to critical benefits when moving between Regions due to administrative hurdles, differing eligibility rules, or data silos.

**Countermeasure:**

- **National Portability Standards (Part II):** Explicitly mandates portability for UI, SNAP, and Medicaid.
- **Secure Data Sharing Framework (Part IV):** Ensures seamless transfer of eligibility and benefit information between agencies.
- **Seamless Enrollment (Section 13(a)):** Requires continuous coverage during inter-regional transfers.

**Outcome:** Administrative barriers to mobility are minimized, ensuring citizens maintain access to essential support regardless of their Region of residence.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Federal Underfunding/Unfunded Mandates

**Attack:** The federal government imposes new or expanded federal floors without providing adequate matching funds, burdening Regional budgets.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Federal Matching Funds (Section 22(a)):** Mandates federal financial contributions for shared-cost programs.
- **Enhanced FMAP (Section 22(b)(2)):** Provides higher federal support for less fiscally capable Regions.
- **Anti-Coercion Rule (Section 22(c)):** Prevents federal government from conditioning unrelated funding on compliance with unfunded mandates.

**Outcome:** Federal floors are accompanied by federal financial support, preventing unfunded mandates from disproportionately burdening Regions.

---

### Attack Vector 4: Data Sharing Abuse

**Attack:** Federal or Regional agencies misuse shared data for surveillance, political targeting, or other unauthorized purposes, violating citizen privacy.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Purpose Limitation (Section 31(b)):** Data can only be used for specific, authorized program administration purposes.
- **Robust Privacy Protections (Section 31(c)):** Mandates data minimization, encryption, access controls, and audit trails.
- **Strict Penalties:** Includes strict penalties for unauthorized access or misuse.
- **Judicial Review:** Citizens have a right to judicial review for privacy violations.

**Outcome:** Data sharing is strictly limited to program administration, with strong privacy safeguards and accountability for misuse.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Political will for adequate federal funding** | High | Requires sustained Congressional appropriations; advocacy from citizen groups. |
| **Complexity of harmonizing diverse Regional administrative systems** | Medium | Federal technical assistance and funding for system upgrades; phased implementation. |
| **Defining "comparable benefits" and "poverty line" across Regions** | Medium | Independent Fiscal Council consultation; transparent methodology; periodic review. |
| **Regional resistance to data sharing** | Low | Federal funding conditions; federal enforcement for non-compliance. |
