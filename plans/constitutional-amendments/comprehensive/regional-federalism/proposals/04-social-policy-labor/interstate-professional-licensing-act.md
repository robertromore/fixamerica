# Interstate Professional Licensing Reciprocity Act

This proposal establishes the statutory framework for the constitutional mutual
recognition provisions (Article I, Section 9), providing detailed procedures for
professional credential portability, supplementary requirements, and dispute
resolution.

---

## Constitutional Foundation

Article I, Section 9 of the Regional Federal Constitution establishes that:

> Professional licenses and credentials issued by any Region, State, Territory,
> or Tribal Nation shall be recognized for practice in all other jurisdictions,
> subject only to registration, reasonable fees, and verification that the
> credential remains in good standing.

This Act implements these principles through specific procedures.

---

## Purpose

Establish professional licensing reciprocity that:

- ensures credential portability across jurisdictional boundaries,
- prevents economic protectionism through licensing barriers,
- provides clear standards for permissible supplementary requirements,
- establishes expedited dispute resolution for licensing denials,
- protects public safety through appropriate verification procedures.

## Part I: Credential Recognition

### Section 1. General Recognition Requirement

(a) Professional licenses and credentials issued by any Region, State, Territory,
or Tribal Nation shall be recognized for practice in all other Regions, States,
Territories, and Tribal Nations.

(b) Recognition is automatic upon:

- (1) registration with the receiving jurisdiction's licensing authority,
- (2) payment of administrative fees as specified in Section 3,
- (3) verification that the credential remains in good standing.

(c) **Good Standing.** A credential is in good standing if:

- (1) it is currently valid and not expired,
- (2) it is not subject to suspension, revocation, or disciplinary action,
- (3) the holder has met continuing education requirements (if any) in the
    issuing jurisdiction.

### Section 2. Covered Professions

(a) This Act applies to all professions requiring licensure, certification, or
registration, including but not limited to:

- (1) healthcare professions (physicians, nurses, pharmacists, therapists),

- (3) positions requiring specific government appointments.

### Section 3. Administrative Fees

(a) **Fee Limit.** Administrative fees for registration under this Act shall
not exceed $100 (adjusted for inflation from the date of ratification).

(b) **Inflation Adjustment.** The fee limit shall be adjusted annually based
on the Consumer Price Index, rounded to the nearest $5.

(c) **Cost Basis.** Fees shall be limited to actual processing costs, including:

- (1) verification of credential status,
- (2) administrative processing,
- (3) issuance of registration documentation.

(d) **Prohibited Fees.** Fees may not include:

- (1) general revenue generation,
- (2) costs of administering examinations not required under this Act,
- (3) punitive or deterrent charges.

### Section 4. Processing Timeline

(a) **Standard Processing.** Licensing authorities shall complete registration
processing within fourteen days of receiving a complete application.

(b) **Expedited Processing.** Upon request and payment of an additional fee not
exceeding $50, processing shall be completed within five business days.

(c) **Deemed Approval.** If processing is not completed within the applicable
timeline, the application is deemed approved pending completion of verification.

## Part II: Supplementary Requirements

### Section 11. General Limitation

(a) Receiving jurisdictions may impose supplementary requirements only where
the criteria in Section 12 are satisfied.

(b) Supplementary requirements are the exception, not the rule. The default is
automatic recognition upon registration.

### Section 12. Permissible Supplementary Requirements

(a) **Standards Differential.** A receiving jurisdiction may impose supplementary
requirements only where:

- (1) the receiving jurisdiction's licensing standards demonstrably and
    substantially exceed those of the issuing jurisdiction,
- (2) the differential relates to specific, identified competencies,
- (3) the differential creates a genuine public safety concern.

(b) **Narrow Tailoring.** Supplementary requirements must be:

- (1) narrowly tailored to address the identified competency gap,
- (2) the minimum necessary to address the public safety concern,
- (3) proportionate to the identified risk.

(c) **Pre-Existing Requirement.** Supplementary requirements must have been
in effect for at least two years prior to the credential holder's application.

(d) **Burden of Proof.** The receiving jurisdiction bears the burden of proving
that supplementary requirements meet all criteria in this Section.

### Section 13. Prohibited Supplementary Requirements

(a) **Re-Examination.** Receiving jurisdictions may not require re-examination
in areas where the issuing jurisdiction's examination is substantially equivalent.

(b) **Duplicative Training.** Receiving jurisdictions may not require training
duplicative of training already completed for the original credential.

(c) **Unrelated Requirements.** Receiving jurisdictions may not impose requirements
unrelated to identified competency differentials.

(d) **Origin-Based Requirements.** Receiving jurisdictions may not apply
supplementary requirements selectively based on the applicant's jurisdiction of
origin.

### Section 14. Grandfather Clause

(a) Licensing standards in effect at ratification are presumed valid for purposes
of this Act.

(b) Standards adopted or modified after ratification that have the effect of
reducing credential portability shall be reviewed under heightened scrutiny.

(c) **Heightened Scrutiny.** Under heightened scrutiny, the receiving jurisdiction
must demonstrate:

- (1) the new standard addresses a genuine public safety concern,
- (2) the concern was not adequately addressed by prior standards,
- (3) the new standard is not pretextual.

---

## Part III: Anti-Circumvention

### Section 21. Prohibited Intent

(a) No jurisdiction may adopt, modify, or apply licensing standards with the
intent of excluding practitioners licensed in other jurisdictions.

(b) **Evidence of Intent.** Intent may be inferred from:

- (1) timing of adoption (shortly after influx of out-of-jurisdiction applicants),
- (2) legislative or regulatory history,
- (3) disparate impact on out-of-jurisdiction applicants,
- (4) absence of documented public safety justification.

### Section 22. Prohibited Effects

(a) Licensing standards that have the primary effect of excluding practitioners
licensed in other jurisdictions violate this Act regardless of stated intent.

(b) **Primary Effect Test.** A standard has the primary effect of exclusion if:

- (1) it results in denial of more than 20% of out-of-jurisdiction applications
    while denying fewer than 5% of in-jurisdiction applications, or
- (2) it imposes costs (time, money, or burden) on out-of-jurisdiction
    applicants exceeding three times those imposed on in-jurisdiction applicants.

### Section 23. Economic Protectionism

(a) No jurisdiction may use licensing requirements for the purpose of protecting
in-jurisdiction practitioners from competition.

(b) Standards that have no demonstrable public safety benefit but reduce
competition are presumptively protectionist.

---

## Part IV: Dispute Resolution

### Section 31. Expedited Challenge

(a) A credential holder who believes supplementary requirements or application
denial violates this Act may seek expedited review in Regional court.

(b) **Timeline.** Expedited review shall be completed within fourteen days of
filing.

(c) **Burden.** The receiving jurisdiction bears the burden of proving that
any supplementary requirements or denial complies with this Act.

### Section 32. Remedies

(a) **Injunctive Relief.** Courts may order immediate recognition of the
credential pending final resolution.

(b) **Declaratory Relief.** Courts may declare that specific supplementary
requirements violate this Act.

(c) **Attorney's Fees.** If the credential holder prevails, the receiving
jurisdiction shall pay reasonable attorney's fees.

(d) **Damages.** Courts may award damages for economic harm caused by wrongful
denial, including lost wages and business opportunities.

### Section 33. Federal Backup

(a) If Regional courts are unavailable or unresponsive, credential holders may
file directly in federal district court.

(b) Federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction over claims under this Act.

---

## Part V: Uniform Licensing Standards

### Section 41. Congressional Authority

(a) Congress may establish uniform licensing standards for professions affecting
public health and safety.

(b) Uniform standards, once established, supersede conflicting Regional or State
requirements.

(c) Uniform standards ensure full portability without supplementary requirements.

### Section 42. Standard-Setting Process

(a) Before establishing uniform standards, Congress shall:

- (1) consult with relevant professional associations,
- (2) review licensing standards across all jurisdictions,
- (3) identify minimum competencies necessary for public safety,
- (4) provide notice and opportunity for public comment.

(b) Uniform standards shall be established at the level necessary to protect
public safety, not at the highest level among existing jurisdictions.

### Section 43. Profession-Specific Compacts

(a) Regions and States may enter into profession-specific interstate compacts
providing for mutual recognition.

(b) Such compacts are encouraged and shall be construed liberally to promote
credential portability.

(c) Compacts may not impose requirements more restrictive than this Act.

## Part VI: Academic Credentials

### Section 51. Degree Recognition

(a) Educational degrees issued by accredited institutions shall be recognized
throughout the United States without requiring revalidation.

(b) "Accredited institution" means an institution accredited by an agency
recognized by the United States Department of Education or by the relevant
Regional education authority.

### Section 52. Transcript Recognition

(a) Academic transcripts from accredited institutions shall be accepted for:

- (1) admission to further education,
- (2) professional licensing applications,
- (3) employment verification.

(b) No jurisdiction may require re-evaluation of transcripts from accredited
institutions.

### Section 53. Professional Certification

(a) Professional certifications issued by nationally recognized certifying
bodies shall be recognized throughout the United States.

(b) "Nationally recognized" means the certifying body operates in at least
three Regions and maintains standards consistent with industry best practices.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Competency Gap Pretext

**Attack:** A jurisdiction creates "competency gap" claims for virtually all
out-of-jurisdiction applicants to impose burdensome supplementary requirements.

**Countermeasure:**

- Demonstrable and substantial differential required (Section 12(a)(1))
- Specific, identified competencies (Section 12(a)(2))
- Burden of proof on receiving jurisdiction (Section 12(d))
- Primary effect test catches systematic exclusion (Section 22(b))
- Expedited judicial review (Section 31)

**Outcome:** Pretextual competency claims are caught by burden of proof,
effect test, and judicial review.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Fee Inflation

**Attack:** A jurisdiction imposes numerous small fees that cumulatively exceed
the $100 limit.

**Countermeasure:**

- $100 total limit (Section 3(a))
- Cost basis required (Section 3(c))
- Prohibited fee categories (Section 3(d))
- Fee structure subject to challenge (Section 31)

**Outcome:** Cumulative fees exceeding $100 violate the Act; cost basis
requirement prevents padding.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Processing Delay

**Attack:** A jurisdiction accepts applications but delays processing
indefinitely, effectively denying recognition.

**Countermeasure:**

- Fourteen-day processing deadline (Section 4(a))
- Expedited five-day option (Section 4(b))
- Deemed approval upon deadline failure (Section 4(c))

**Outcome:** Delay tactics fail; deemed approval ensures recognition proceeds.

---

### Attack Vector 4: Retroactive Standards

**Attack:** A jurisdiction adopts new, more restrictive standards and applies
them to existing out-of-jurisdiction credential holders.

**Countermeasure:**

- Two-year pre-existing requirement (Section 12(c))
- Grandfather clause for ratification-era standards (Section 14(a))
- Heightened scrutiny for new restrictive standards (Section 14(b))

**Outcome:** Retroactive application is prohibited; new standards face
heightened scrutiny.

---

### Attack Vector 5: Origin-Based Discrimination

**Attack:** A jurisdiction imposes supplementary requirements only on applicants
from specific jurisdictions it views as having "inferior" training.

**Countermeasure:**

- Origin-based application prohibited (Section 13(d))
- Disparate impact as evidence of intent (Section 21(b)(3))
- Primary effect test (Section 22)
- Economic protectionism prohibition (Section 23)

**Outcome:** Origin-based discrimination is explicitly prohibited and subject
to challenge.

### Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| Legitimate competency differentials | Low | Permitted under Section 12 with narrow tailoring |
| Verification delays from issuing jurisdiction | Medium | Deemed approval after deadline; good faith cooperation expected |
| Court capacity for expedited review | Medium | Federal backup jurisdiction; simple burden of proof |
| Profession-specific lobbying | Low | Congressional uniform standards can override |
