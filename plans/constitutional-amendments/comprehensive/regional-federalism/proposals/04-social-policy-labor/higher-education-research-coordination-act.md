# Higher Education and Research Coordination Act

This proposal establishes a framework for coordinating higher education accreditation, research funding, and academic credit transfer to support a national ecosystem for innovation and learning.

---

## Purpose

Establish a framework for Higher Education and Research Coordination that:

- Ensures the portability and recognition of academic credentials across all Regions.
- Facilitates student mobility and access to diverse educational opportunities.
- Supports a robust national research ecosystem by coordinating federal and Regional efforts.
- Promotes inter-regional collaboration among public university systems.
- Balances Regional autonomy in educational policy with national interests in innovation and workforce development.

## Part I: Academic Credential Recognition and Transfer

### Section 1. National Accreditation Framework

(a) **Recognition.** Educational degrees, certificates, and other academic credentials issued by institutions accredited by an agency recognized by the United States Department of Education (USDE) or by the relevant Regional education authority shall be recognized as valid throughout the United States.

(b) **Accreditation Standards.** The USDE shall establish minimum standards for the recognition of accrediting agencies, ensuring rigor, transparency, and independence.

(c) **No Revalidation.** No Region or institution may require revalidation or re-evaluation of credentials from an accredited institution solely due to the credential's origin in another Region.

### Section 2. Inter-Regional Credit Transfer System

(a) **Standardization.** The USDE shall, in consultation with Regional education authorities and higher education institutions, establish a national system or set of standards for the transfer of academic credits between accredited institutions across Regions.

(b) **Mandatory Acceptance.** Accredited institutions shall accept academic credits earned at other accredited institutions in any Region, provided the credits are applicable to the student's program of study and meet the receiving institution's academic standards.

(c) **Transparency.** Institutions shall publicly disclose their credit transfer policies, including any limitations or requirements.

### Section 3. Student Mobility

(a) **Non-Discrimination.** No public institution of higher education may discriminate against applicants or students based on their Region of origin.

(b) **Tuition Reciprocity.** Regions are encouraged to enter into tuition reciprocity agreements to reduce financial barriers for students studying in other Regions. The USDE may provide incentives for such agreements.

## Part II: Federal Research Grant Coordination

### Section 11. National Research Priorities

(a) **Coordination.** Federal research funding bodies (e.g., NIH, NSF, DOE, NASA) shall coordinate their grant-making processes to align with national research priorities, ensuring that research remains a national and global endeavor.

(b) **Regional Input.** Federal agencies shall solicit input from Regional governments and Regional university systems when establishing national research priorities.

### Section 12. Grant Distribution and Oversight

(a) **Equitable Access.** Federal research grants shall be distributed through a competitive, merit-based process that ensures equitable access for researchers and institutions across all Regions.

(b) **Regional Capacity Building.** Federal agencies may establish programs to support research capacity building in Regions with historically lower levels of federal research funding.

(c) **Oversight.** Federal agencies shall maintain robust oversight mechanisms for grant expenditures, ensuring accountability and compliance with federal regulations, regardless of the recipient institution's Region.

### Section 13. Research Infrastructure

(a) **Shared Resources.** Federal agencies shall promote the development and sharing of national research infrastructure (e.g., supercomputing facilities, specialized laboratories) that can be accessed by researchers from all Regions.

(b) **Inter-Regional Collaboration.** Federal grants may prioritize inter-regional collaborative research projects that leverage the unique strengths of institutions in different Regions.

## Part III: Coordination of Regional University Systems

### Section 21. Inter-Regional University Compacts

(a) **Authorization.** Regions may form "Inter-Regional University Compacts" under Article I, Section 5, to coordinate their public university systems.

(b) **Purpose.** Such compacts may aim to:
    - (1) Share academic programs and faculty resources.
    - (2) Coordinate research initiatives and facilities.
    - (3) Harmonize credit transfer policies.
    - (4) Develop joint degree programs.
    - (5) Optimize resource allocation and avoid unnecessary duplication.

(c) **Governance.** Compacts shall adhere to the principles and default template of the `Inter-Regional Joint Authority: Constitutional Default Template`.

### Section 22. Federal Support for Coordination

(a) **Technical Assistance.** The USDE shall establish a "Higher Education Coordination Office" to provide technical assistance and best practices to Regions forming Inter-Regional University Compacts.

(b) **Incentive Grants.** Federal grants may be awarded to Compacts that demonstrate effective collaboration, particularly in areas of national priority (e.g., STEM education, critical research).

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Accreditation Manipulation

**Attack:** A Region attempts to establish a lax accrediting body to certify low-quality institutions, whose degrees would then be recognized nationwide, undermining academic standards.

**Countermeasure:**

- **USDE Minimum Standards (Section 1(b)):** The USDE sets minimum standards for recognizing accrediting agencies, ensuring rigor and preventing "accreditation mills."
- **Accreditation Body Independence:** The standards would require accrediting bodies to be independent of political influence.
- **Professional Licensing:** The `Interstate Professional Licensing Reciprocity Act` provides a backstop, as professional licenses still require demonstrated competency, regardless of degree origin.

**Outcome:** While a Region might attempt this, the federal oversight of accreditation standards and the independent requirements for professional practice would prevent widespread undermining of academic quality.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Credit Transfer Obstruction

**Attack:** Institutions or Regions create arbitrary barriers to credit transfer (e.g., refusing to accept certain types of courses, imposing excessive review processes) to protect their enrollment or revenue.

**Countermeasure:**

- **National Standards (Section 2(a)):** The USDE establishes clear, binding standards for credit transfer.
- **Mandatory Acceptance (Section 2(b)):** Accredited institutions are legally required to accept applicable credits.
- **Transparency (Section 2(c)):** Public disclosure of policies allows scrutiny and challenge.
- **Judicial Review:** Institutions or students could challenge arbitrary denials in federal court.

**Outcome:** Arbitrary obstruction is prohibited and subject to federal oversight and judicial challenge, ensuring student mobility.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Research Funding Politicization

**Attack:** A federal administration attempts to direct research grants based on political alignment rather than scientific merit, or a Region attempts to block federal research within its borders.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Merit-Based Distribution (Section 12(a)):** Federal grants are distributed competitively based on merit.
- **Coordination with Regional Input (Section 11(b)):** National priorities are set with input from diverse stakeholders, not unilaterally.
- **Federal Supremacy:** Federal research funding is an enumerated power; Regions cannot block federally authorized research.
- **Oversight (Section 12(c)):** Robust oversight ensures funds are used appropriately.

**Outcome:** While political influence is always a risk, the merit-based system and federal supremacy over research funding provide strong checks against overt politicization or Regional obstruction.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Regional resistance to federal standards** | Medium | Federal incentives for compliance; judicial enforcement for non-compliance with mandatory standards. |
| **Funding shortfalls for research/coordination** | Medium | Requires sustained congressional appropriation; advocacy from research and education communities. |
| **Disparities in educational quality across Regions** | High | This Act ensures recognition and transfer, but does not directly address underlying quality gaps, which remain a Regional responsibility. |
| **Brain drain from less resourced Regions** | Medium | Federal capacity-building grants (Section 12(b)); incentives for faculty to remain in or move to underserved Regions. |
