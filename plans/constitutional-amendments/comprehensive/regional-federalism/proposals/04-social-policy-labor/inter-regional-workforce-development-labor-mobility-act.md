# Inter-Regional Workforce Development and Labor Mobility Act

This proposal establishes a framework for coordinating workforce development programs, facilitating labor mobility, and harmonizing labor market information across Regional boundaries, ensuring a dynamic and responsive national labor market.

---

## Purpose

Establish a framework for Inter-Regional Workforce Development and Labor Mobility that:

- Ensures a dynamic and responsive national labor market.
- Facilitates the seamless movement of workers and skills across Regional boundaries.
- Coordinates workforce development programs to address national and inter-regional skill gaps.
- Harmonizes labor market information to support informed decision-making by workers, businesses, and policymakers.
- Supports economic resilience and individual opportunity regardless of Regional residence.

## Part I: National Workforce Data and Information

### Section 1. National Labor Market Information System

(a) The Department of Labor (DOL) shall establish and maintain a "National Labor Market Information System" (NLMIS) to collect, analyze, and disseminate comprehensive labor market data across all Regions.

(b) The NLMIS shall integrate data from federal agencies (e.g., BLS, Census), Regional labor departments, and other relevant sources.

(c) Data elements shall include, but not be limited to:
    - (1) Employment and unemployment rates by sector and occupation.
    - (2) Wage and salary data, adjusted for Regional cost-of-living.
    - (3) Skill gaps and labor surpluses by occupation and Region.
    - (4) Educational and training program enrollment and completion rates.
    - (5) Projections of future labor demand and supply.

### Section 2. Regional Data Reporting and Interoperability

(a) Regional labor departments shall report standardized labor market data to the NLMIS on a quarterly basis.

(b) The DOL shall establish data standards and interoperability requirements for Regional labor market information systems.

(c) Federal funding for Regional workforce development programs shall be conditioned on compliance with NLMIS data reporting and interoperability standards.

## Part II: Workforce Development and Training Coordination

### Section 11. Inter-Regional Training Standards and Apprenticeships

(a) The DOL shall develop model standards for vocational training programs, industry-recognized certifications, and apprenticeship programs to promote portability of skills across Regions.

(b) Regions are encouraged to adopt these model standards. Federal grants for workforce development may prioritize Regions that adopt or exceed these standards.

(c) The DOL shall facilitate the creation of inter-regional apprenticeship programs, allowing apprentices to gain experience and credentials recognized across multiple Regions.

### Section 12. Skill Gap and Labor Surplus Coordination

(a) The Inter-Regional Workforce Development Council (established in Part IV of this Act) shall identify critical national and inter-regional skill gaps and labor surpluses based on NLMIS data.

(b) The DOL shall provide grants to Regions to develop and implement targeted training programs to address identified skill gaps, particularly those with inter-regional significance.

(c) Regions experiencing labor surpluses in specific sectors are encouraged to collaborate with Regions experiencing shortages to facilitate worker relocation and retraining.

## Part III: Labor Mobility Support

### Section 21. Labor Mobility Assistance Program

(a) The DOL shall establish a "Labor Mobility Assistance Program" to provide financial and logistical support to workers relocating for employment across Regional boundaries.

(b) Assistance may include:
    - (1) Relocation stipends for eligible workers.
    - (2) Job placement services in the new Region.
    - (3) Temporary housing assistance.
    - (4) Information on recognition of non-licensed certifications and credentials.

### Section 22. Unemployment Insurance Coordination

(a) Beyond the portability provisions in the `Social Safety Net Coordination Act`, the DOL shall establish mechanisms for inter-regional coordination of Unemployment Insurance (UI) programs.

(b) This coordination shall include:
    - (1) Data sharing on UI claims and eligibility across Regions.
    - (2) Model compacts for shared funding or risk pooling for UI in inter-regional economic downturns or for industries with high inter-regional mobility.
    - (3) Streamlined processes for workers who have earned UI eligibility in multiple Regions.

---

## Part IV: Oversight and Coordination

### Section 31. Inter-Regional Workforce Development Council

(a) There is established an "Inter-Regional Workforce Development Council" (the "Council").

(b) **Composition.** The Council shall be composed of:
    - (1) The Secretary of Labor (Chair).
    - (2) One representative from each Regional labor department or workforce authority, appointed by the respective Regional Governor.
    - (3) Two members appointed by the President with expertise in labor economics and workforce development.

(c) **Functions.** The Council shall:
    - (1) Advise on the development and implementation of the NLMIS.
    - (2) Facilitate inter-regional collaboration on workforce development initiatives.
    - (3) Mediate disputes between Regions regarding labor mobility or training standards.
    - (4) Publish an annual report on the state of the national labor market and inter-regional mobility.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Regional Data Hoarding

**Attack:** A Region refuses to share comprehensive labor market data with the NLMIS, citing proprietary concerns or a desire to protect its local labor market.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Conditional Federal Funding (Section 2(c)):** Federal funding for Regional workforce development programs is conditioned on compliance with NLMIS data reporting standards.
- **NLMIS Integration (Section 1(b)):** The NLMIS integrates data from multiple federal sources, reducing reliance on a single Regional source.
- **Council Mediation (Section 31(c)(3)):** The Inter-Regional Workforce Development Council can mediate data sharing disputes.

**Outcome:** Financial incentives and federal data integration make it difficult for a Region to completely hoard data without significant cost.

---

### Attack Vector 2: "Brain Drain" Concerns

**Attack:** Regions with lower fiscal capacity or less robust economies fear that facilitating labor mobility will lead to a "brain drain" of their skilled workforce to more prosperous Regions.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Labor Mobility Assistance Program (Section 21):** Provides support for workers, but also helps match skills to needs, potentially attracting workers to underserved areas.
- **Inter-Regional Training Grants (Section 12(b)):** Federal grants can target training in less prosperous Regions to build local capacity.
- **Fiscal Equalization Act:** Provides unconditional transfers to less prosperous Regions, enhancing their ability to retain and attract talent.
- **NLMIS Data (Section 1(c)(3)):** Identifies skill gaps and surpluses, allowing for targeted interventions to balance labor markets.

**Outcome:** While brain drain is a persistent economic challenge, the Act provides tools and incentives to mitigate its negative effects and promote a more balanced distribution of talent.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Undermining Training Standards

**Attack:** A Region adopts lax training standards to quickly fill labor shortages, potentially leading to a devaluation of credentials and skills across the federation.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Model Standards (Section 11(a)):** DOL develops model standards, providing a benchmark for quality.
- **Federal Grant Prioritization (Section 11(b)):** Federal grants for workforce development prioritize Regions that adopt or exceed these model standards.
- **Interstate Professional Licensing Reciprocity Act:** For licensed professions, this Act already ensures a baseline of quality.

**Outcome:** Financial incentives and the existence of model standards encourage Regions to maintain quality, preventing a race to the bottom in training.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Political will for sustained federal funding** | High | Requires sustained Congressional appropriations; advocacy from labor and business groups. |
| **Complexity of harmonizing diverse Regional training systems** | Medium | Federal technical assistance and funding for system upgrades; phased implementation; focus on model standards rather than mandates. |
| **Resistance from specific industries to standardized training** | Medium | Industry engagement in model standard development; demonstration of benefits (e.g., reduced recruitment costs). |
| **Defining "critical labor shortage" objectively** | Medium | NLMIS data and Council recommendations will provide objective criteria; subject to public comment. |
