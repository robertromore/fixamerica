# National Public Health and Health Equity Act

This proposal establishes a comprehensive framework for federal-Regional coordination on ongoing public health initiatives, disease prevention, and health equity, distinct from emergency response.

---

## Purpose

Establish a framework for National Public Health and Health Equity that:

- Creates a proactive and equitable approach to public health across the federation.
- Coordinates federal and Regional efforts in chronic disease prevention, health promotion, and addressing health disparities.
- Establishes a national public health data system for surveillance and research.
- Sets federal floors for health equity to ensure a baseline of protection for all citizens.
- Supports the development of a robust and skilled public health workforce.

## Part I: National Public Health Data and Surveillance

### Section 1. National Public Health Data System (NPHDS)

(a) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shall establish and maintain a "National Public Health Data System" (NPHDS) to aggregate, analyze, and disseminate de-identified public health data from all Regions.

(b) The NPHDS shall be distinct from emergency reporting systems and focus on long-term trends.

### Section 2. Data Elements

(a) The NPHDS shall include data on, but not limited to:
    - (1) Prevalence and incidence of major chronic diseases (e.g., heart disease, diabetes, cancer).
    - (2) Key health risk factors (e.g., smoking rates, obesity, physical inactivity).
    - (3) Health disparities by socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, and geography.
    - (4) Environmental health indicators (e.g., air and water quality, lead exposure).
    - (5) Vaccination rates for non-emergency immunizations.

### Section 3. Regional Reporting and Interoperability

(a) Regional health authorities shall report standardized, de-identified public health data to the NPHDS on an annual basis.

(b) The CDC shall establish data standards and interoperability requirements for Regional public health information systems.

(c) Federal funding for public health programs shall be conditioned on compliance with NPHDS reporting standards.

### Section 4. Privacy and Security

(a) All data in the NPHDS shall be de-identified to the greatest extent possible.

(b) Data shall be used solely for public health surveillance, research, and policy development. It shall not be used for law enforcement or commercial purposes.

(c) The system shall adhere to the highest federal cybersecurity and privacy standards.

## Part II: Disease Prevention and Health Promotion

### Section 11. National Health Promotion Strategy

(a) The CDC, in consultation with the National Health Policy Council (established in the `Inter-Regional Healthcare Coordination Act`), shall develop and update a 10-year National Health Promotion Strategy.

(b) The Strategy shall identify national priorities for chronic disease prevention and health promotion and provide evidence-based recommendations for federal and Regional action.

### Section 12. Inter-Regional Prevention Initiatives

(a) Regions are authorized to form "Inter-Regional Health Compacts" to coordinate on disease prevention initiatives, such as:
    - (1) Joint public awareness campaigns (e.g., anti-smoking, nutrition).
    - (2) Coordinated vaccination programs.
    - (3) Shared strategies for addressing inter-regional health challenges like the opioid crisis.

### Section 13. Federal Prevention Grants

(a) The federal government shall provide grants to Regions and local health departments to implement evidence-based prevention programs aligned with the National Health Promotion Strategy.

(b) Priority shall be given to programs that address leading causes of death and disability and reduce health disparities.

---

## Part III: Health Equity

### Section 21. Federal Health Equity Floors

(a) The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) shall establish federal minimum standards ("floors") for health equity.

(b) These floors shall ensure a baseline of access to essential preventive services and public health protections for all citizens, regardless of Region.

(c) Floors shall include, but not be limited to:
    - (1) Minimum access standards for prenatal care, cancer screenings, and childhood immunizations.
    - (2) Requirements for targeted interventions in communities with documented health disparities.
    - (3) Basic protections against environmental health hazards.

(d) **Regional Flexibility.** Regions may establish and enforce health equity standards that exceed these federal floors.

### Section 22. Health Equity Impact Assessments

(a) All major federal and Regional legislation or regulations affecting health must include a "Health Equity Impact Assessment."

(b) The assessment shall analyze the potential differential impacts of the policy on various demographic and socioeconomic groups and identify mitigation strategies for any negative impacts.

### Section 23. Funding for Health Equity Programs

(a) HHS shall administer a grant program to support Regional and local initiatives aimed at reducing health disparities and addressing the social determinants of health.

---

## Part IV: Public Health Workforce Development

### Section 31. National Public Health Workforce Strategy

(a) The federal government shall develop a national strategy to recruit, train, and retain a diverse and skilled public health workforce.

### Section 32. Workforce Development Programs

(a) HHS shall establish and fund:
    - (1) A loan repayment program for public health professionals who commit to working in underserved areas.
    - (2) A national scholarship program for students pursuing degrees in public health (e.g., epidemiology, biostatistics, community health).
    - (3) Grants to universities and community colleges to expand public health training programs.

### Section 33. Community Health Workers

(a) The federal government shall provide funding and technical assistance to Regions to support the integration of community health workers into public health and healthcare delivery systems.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Federal Overreach via Data

**Attack:** A federal administration attempts to use the NPHDS for purposes beyond public health, such as law enforcement surveillance or immigration enforcement.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Purpose Limitation (Section 4(b)):** The Act explicitly limits data use to public health, research, and policy, and prohibits law enforcement or commercial use.
- **De-identification Requirement (Section 1(a)):** Data must be de-identified, making it less useful for individual surveillance.
- **Privacy and Security Standards (Section 4(c)):** Mandates robust privacy protections and cybersecurity.
- **Judicial Review:** Any attempt to misuse the data would be subject to legal challenge.

**Outcome:** The Act's strong privacy and purpose-limitation provisions make it difficult to repurpose the data system for surveillance without clear legal violations.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Regional Negligence

**Attack:** A Region fails to report data to the NPHDS or neglects to enforce federal health equity floors, creating a "race to the bottom" on public health.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Conditional Federal Funding (Section 3(c)):** Federal public health funding is conditioned on compliance with data reporting standards.
- **Federal Floors (Section 21):** Establishes a binding minimum standard for health equity, preventing a complete race to the bottom.
- **Council Oversight:** The National Health Policy Council will publicly report on Regional performance, creating political pressure.
- **Federal Enforcement:** HHS can bring enforcement actions against non-compliant Regions.

**Outcome:** Non-compliance carries significant financial and political costs, creating strong incentives for Regions to meet federal floors and reporting requirements.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Politicization of Health Equity

**Attack:** Political actors claim that health equity floors or impact assessments are a form of social engineering or partisan overreach, and refuse to comply.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Focus on Measurable Outcomes:** Health equity floors are based on measurable health outcomes (e.g., access to screenings, infant mortality rates), not ideological goals.
- **Evidence-Based Strategy:** The National Health Promotion Strategy is required to be evidence-based, grounding it in science.
- **Regional Flexibility (Section 21(d)):** Regions have flexibility in how they meet federal floors, preserving their autonomy.

**Outcome:** By grounding health equity in measurable outcomes and preserving Regional flexibility, the Act can counter claims of partisan overreach.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Political will for sustained public health funding** | High | Requires sustained Congressional appropriations; advocacy from public health and community groups. |
| **Complexity of measuring and addressing health disparities** | Medium | Phased implementation; focus on a limited set of high-impact metrics initially; robust technical assistance to Regions. |
| **Data privacy concerns, even with de-identification** | Medium | Continuous review of privacy protocols; strong penalties for data misuse; public transparency about data use. |
| **Resistance to federal floors in some Regions** | Medium | Federal incentives for compliance; focus on floors with broad public support (e.g., cancer screenings). |
