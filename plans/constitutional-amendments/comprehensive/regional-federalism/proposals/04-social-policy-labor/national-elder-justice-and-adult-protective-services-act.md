# National Elder Justice and Adult Protective Services Act

This proposal establishes a federal-regional partnership to prevent, detect, and respond to elder abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation, ensuring a baseline of protection for vulnerable adults across the nation.

---

## Purpose

Establish a framework for Elder Justice and Adult Protective Services that:

- Establishes federal minimum standards (floors) for Adult Protective Services (APS) in each Region.
- Creates a national, confidential system for reporting and tracking adult maltreatment.
- Establishes binding protocols for joint investigations of abuse cases that span multiple Regions.
- Strengthens coordination between APS, law enforcement, and financial institutions to combat financial exploitation.

## Part I: Federal Standards and National Reporting

### Section 1. Federal Adult Protective Services (APS) Floors

(a) The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) shall establish and enforce federal minimum standards ("floors") for APS programs in each Region.

(b) These floors shall include, but not be limited to:
    - (1) Minimum training and qualification standards for APS caseworkers.
    - (2) Statewide standards for receiving and investigating reports of adult maltreatment.
    - (3) Protocols for risk assessment and safety planning for vulnerable adults.
    - (4) Requirements for data collection and reporting to the national system.

(c) **Regional Authority.** Regions may establish and enforce APS standards that exceed these federal floors.

### Section 2. National Adult Maltreatment Reporting System (NAMRS)

(a) HHS shall establish and maintain a "National Adult Maltreatment Reporting System" (NAMRS).

(b) The NAMRS shall include:
    - (1) A national, toll-free hotline for the public to report suspected cases of elder abuse, neglect, or exploitation.
    - (2) A secure national database to collect and analyze de-identified data on adult maltreatment cases from all Regional APS agencies.

(c) Data shall be used to identify national trends, facilitate inter-regional investigations, and inform research and policy.

### Section 3. Data Privacy and Security

(a) All personally identifiable information within NAMRS shall be confidential and protected by robust security measures, consistent with the `Inter-Regional Consumer Protection and Data Privacy Act`.

(b) Data may be shared with law enforcement or financial institutions only for the purpose of investigating or prosecuting a specific case of adult maltreatment.

---

## Part II: Inter-Regional Coordination

### Section 11. Inter-Regional Investigation Protocols

(a) HHS shall, in coordination with the Department of Justice (DOJ), establish binding protocols for joint investigations of elder abuse, neglect, or exploitation cases that span multiple Regions.

(b) These protocols shall define roles and responsibilities for the lead investigating agency and ensure seamless cooperation between the APS agencies and law enforcement of the involved Regions.

### Section 12. Enforcement of Protection Orders

(a) A protection order issued by a court in any Region for the benefit of a vulnerable adult shall be recognized and enforced in all other Regions, consistent with the `Inter-Regional Family Law and Personal Status Act`.

---

## Part III: Financial Exploitation Prevention

### Section 21. Financial Institution Safe Harbor

(a) Financial institutions are granted a "safe harbor" from liability for reporting suspected financial exploitation of a vulnerable adult to APS or law enforcement in good faith.

(b) Upon reporting, a financial institution is authorized to place a temporary hold of up to 10 business days on any suspicious transaction to allow for an investigation by APS or law enforcement.

### Section 22. Coordinated Asset Recovery

(a) The National Elder Justice Council (established in Part IV) shall develop model protocols to enhance coordination between APS, law enforcement, and financial institutions for the purpose of freezing and recovering assets stolen from vulnerable adults.

---

## Part IV: Oversight and Funding

### Section 31. National Elder Justice Council

(a) There is established a "National Elder Justice Council" (the "Council").

(b) **Composition.** The Council shall be composed of:
    - (1) The Secretary of HHS (or designee, as Chair).
    - (2) Representatives from the DOJ and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).
    - (3) The head of each Regional APS agency.
    - (4) Non-voting members representing elder justice advocacy groups and financial industry associations.

(c) **Functions.** The Council shall:
    - (1) Advise HHS on the development and implementation of federal APS floors.
    - (2) Mediate disputes between Regions regarding inter-regional investigations.
    - (3) Publish an annual report on the state of elder justice in the nation.

### Section 32. Federal Funding

(a) The federal government shall provide grants to Regions to assist them in meeting federal APS floors, upgrading data systems, and implementing innovative prevention programs.

(b) Receipt of such funding shall be conditioned on compliance with the requirements of this Act, including data reporting to NAMRS.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Regional "Race to the Bottom"

**Attack:** A Region underfunds its APS program and lowers standards for investigation and training to cut costs, creating a dangerous environment for vulnerable adults.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Federal APS Floors (Section 1):** Establishes binding federal minimum standards for training, investigation protocols, and data collection.
- **Conditional Federal Funding (Section 32(b)):** Federal funding for APS programs is conditioned on compliance with federal floors.
- **Public Reporting (Section 31(c)):** The Council's annual report will highlight Regional non-compliance, creating political pressure.

**Outcome:** Regions cannot legally fall below federal minimum standards for adult protection without risking federal funding and public exposure.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Failure to Coordinate on Cross-Border Cases

**Attack:** An investigation into a financial exploitation scheme stalls because the victim is in one Region, the perpetrator is in another, and the bank is in a third, and the agencies refuse to cooperate.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Binding Investigation Protocols (Section 11):** The Act mandates binding protocols for joint investigations, defining roles and responsibilities.
- **Council Mediation (Section 31(c)):** The National Elder Justice Council is empowered to mediate and resolve such disputes.
- **NAMRS Data Sharing:** The national database helps connect the dots in multi-jurisdictional cases.

**Outcome:** The Act provides a clear legal framework and coordinating body to overcome inter-regional friction in complex cases.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Financial Industry Non-Cooperation

**Attack:** Financial institutions refuse to report suspected exploitation or place holds on transactions, citing customer privacy and liability concerns.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Safe Harbor Provision (Section 21):** The Act provides explicit legal protection (safe harbor) for financial institutions that report suspected exploitation in good faith, removing the primary disincentive to act.
- **Clear Authorization for Holds:** The Act provides clear legal authority for temporary transaction holds, giving institutions confidence to act.

**Outcome:** By addressing liability concerns directly, the Act encourages proactive cooperation from the financial sector in preventing exploitation.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Funding shortfalls for APS programs** | High | Requires sustained federal and Regional appropriations; advocacy from elder justice organizations. |
| **Defining "vulnerable adult" and "exploitation"** | Medium | HHS rulemaking with public comment; Council to develop model definitions; judicial precedent. |
| **Inter-agency friction between APS and law enforcement** | Medium | The Council and joint investigation protocols are designed to reduce friction, but cultural differences remain a challenge. |
| **Shortage of trained APS professionals** | High | Federal funding for training programs; loan forgiveness incentives; coordination with the `Inter-Regional Workforce Development and Labor Mobility Act`. |
