# National Veterans Affairs Coordination Act

This proposal defines the federal-Regional relationship for the provision of veterans' benefits and services, ensuring the VA's national system operates effectively within the Regional Federalism model.

---

## Purpose

Establish a framework for National Veterans Affairs Coordination that:

- Affirms the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) as a national system for healthcare and benefits.
- Ensures uniform federal standards for VA services across all Regions.
- Establishes clear protocols for the VA's interaction with Regional healthcare, education, and workforce systems.
- Creates a framework for coordinating community-based care purchased from non-VA providers.

## Part I: VA Healthcare System

### Section 1. National Healthcare System

(a) **Federal System.** The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) shall be affirmed as an exclusively federal healthcare system, with uniform federal standards for care, quality, and access applicable in all Regions.

(b) **Provider Licensing.** VHA healthcare providers shall be licensed by a national VA licensing board, and such license shall authorize practice at any VHA facility in any Region, superseding Regional licensing requirements for practice within the VHA system.

(c) **Coordination with Regional Health Systems.** VHA facilities shall coordinate with Regional public health authorities on matters of mutual concern, including disease surveillance and emergency preparedness, consistent with the `National Public Health and Health Equity Act`.

### Section 2. Community Care Coordination

(a) **Framework.** The VA shall maintain a Community Care Program to purchase care for eligible veterans from non-VA providers.

(b) **Provider Agreements.** The VA shall establish national standards for community care providers. To be eligible for payment, community care providers must:
    - (1) Meet VA quality and credentialing standards.
    - (2) Be licensed in the Region where the care is provided, consistent with the `Interstate Professional Licensing Reciprocity Act`.
    - (3) Adhere to VA standards for medical documentation and billing.

(c) **Payment Rates.** The VA shall establish a national fee schedule for community care, with adjustments for Regional variations in cost of living and service costs, developed in consultation with the Independent Fiscal Council.

---

## Part II: Benefits Administration

### Section 11. Exclusively Federal Benefits

(a) All benefits administered by the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA)—including disability compensation, pensions, and survivor benefits—are exclusively federal.

(b) Eligibility criteria and payment rates for these benefits shall be uniform across all Regions, subject only to federal cost-of-living adjustments where applicable.

### Section 12. Education and Workforce Coordination

(a) **GI Bill and Education Benefits.** The VA shall coordinate with Regional education authorities and accredited institutions to ensure the seamless application of GI Bill and other educational benefits, consistent with the `Higher Education and Research Coordination Act`.

(b) **Workforce Programs.** The VA shall coordinate with Regional workforce development agencies to connect veterans with training and employment opportunities, consistent with the `Inter-Regional Workforce Development and Labor Mobility Act`.

---

## Part III: National Cemetery Administration

### Section 21. Exclusively Federal System

(a) The National Cemetery Administration shall be affirmed as an exclusively federal system.

(b) The establishment, maintenance, and operation of national cemeteries shall be a federal responsibility, with uniform eligibility standards for burial.

---

## Part IV: Federal-Regional Veterans Council

### Section 31. Establishment

(a) There is established a "Federal-Regional Veterans Council" (the "Council").

(b) **Composition.** The Council shall be composed of:
    - (1) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs (Chair).
    - (2) One representative from each Regional government, appointed by the Governor, with expertise in veterans' issues.
    - (3) Representatives from major national Veterans Service Organizations (VSOs).

(c) **Functions.** The Council shall meet quarterly to:
    - (1) Coordinate federal and Regional efforts on cross-cutting issues, including veteran homelessness, mental health, and suicide prevention.
    - (2) Share best practices for serving veterans.
    - (3) Mediate disputes between the VA and Regional governments regarding service delivery or coordination.
    - (4) Publish an annual report on the state of veterans' services across the nation.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Regional Interference with VA Operations

**Attack:** A Region attempts to impose its own healthcare regulations, licensing requirements, or land use rules on a VA hospital, obstructing its operation.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Exclusive Federal Authority (Section 1(a)):** The Act affirms the VHA as an exclusively federal system.
- **Federal Supremacy:** Federal law governing the VA preempts conflicting Regional regulations.
- **National Licensing (Section 1(b)):** VA providers operate under a national license, bypassing Regional requirements for practice within the VA.

**Outcome:** Regions cannot legally interfere with the internal operations of the VA healthcare system.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Disparities in Community Care

**Attack:** Due to varying Regional provider networks and costs, veterans in some Regions have significantly better or faster access to community care than in others, undermining the principle of a uniform national benefit.

**Countermeasure:**

- **National Standards (Section 2(b)):** The VA establishes national quality and credentialing standards for all community care providers.
- **National Fee Schedule with Regional Adjustments (Section 2(c)):** Ensures that payment is adequate to build provider networks even in high-cost Regions.
- **Council Oversight (Section 31(c)):** The Federal-Regional Veterans Council can identify and address disparities in community care access.

**Outcome:** While some variation is inevitable, the Act provides tools to ensure a baseline of access to community care across all Regions.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Failure to Coordinate on Social Services

**Attack:** The VA and Regional governments fail to coordinate on veteran homelessness or mental health, leading to gaps in service where veterans are passed back and forth between federal and Regional systems.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Federal-Regional Veterans Council (Section 31):** Creates a dedicated forum for coordinating on these specific cross-cutting issues.
- **Joint Programs:** The Council is empowered to facilitate joint federal-Regional programs for issues like homelessness.
- **Data Sharing:** The Council can establish protocols for sharing data (with privacy protections) to better track and serve at-risk veterans.

**Outcome:** The Act creates a formal structure to prevent veterans from falling through the cracks between federal and Regional service systems.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **VA funding shortfalls** | High | Requires sustained Congressional appropriations; advocacy from VSOs and the public. |
| **Bureaucratic friction between VA and Regional agencies** | Medium | The Council is designed to reduce friction, but intergovernmental coordination is always challenging. |
| **Shortage of community care providers in rural areas** | Medium | VA can use enhanced payment rates and telehealth to expand access in underserved areas. |
| **Complexity of coordinating benefits with diverse Regional programs** | Medium | The Council and dedicated VA liaisons can work to harmonize processes. |
