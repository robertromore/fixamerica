# Federal-Regional Intelligence Sharing and Oversight Act

This proposal establishes the architecture, rules, and oversight for intelligence sharing between federal agencies and Regional security and law enforcement bodies, balancing national security needs with the protection of civil liberties.

---

## Purpose

Establish a framework for Federal-Regional Intelligence Sharing and Oversight that:

-   Ensures effective and secure sharing of intelligence between federal and Regional entities.
-   Protects civil liberties and privacy rights during intelligence collection and dissemination.
-   Establishes clear rules and oversight mechanisms to prevent abuse and politicization of intelligence.
-   Facilitates coordinated responses to national security threats and serious criminal activity.
-   Fosters trust and cooperation between federal and Regional security partners.

## Part I: Intelligence Sharing Architecture

### Section 1. National Intelligence Sharing Network

(a) The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) shall establish and maintain a secure, interoperable "National Intelligence Sharing Network" (the "Network").

(b) The Network shall facilitate the exchange of intelligence and law enforcement information between federal intelligence agencies (e.g., FBI, NSA, CIA), federal law enforcement agencies, and authorized Regional entities.

(c) All federal agencies participating in the Network shall adhere to common technical standards, security protocols, and data classification guidelines established by the DNI.

### Section 2. Regional Intelligence Fusion Centers

(a) Each Region shall establish and maintain a "Regional Intelligence Fusion Center" (the "Fusion Center") as the primary conduit for receiving and disseminating intelligence from the Network to Regional and local law enforcement.

(b) Fusion Centers shall be governed by a board with representation from the Regional Governor's office, Regional law enforcement, and the Regional Civil Liberties and Privacy Board (established in Part II).

(c) The DNI shall establish minimum standards for Fusion Center operations, including:
    - (1) Physical and cybersecurity.
    - (2) Personnel vetting and training.
    - (3) Data handling and retention policies.
    - (4) Reporting requirements to the DNI.

### Section 3. Security Clearances

(a) The DNI shall establish a standardized and reciprocal system for granting and recognizing security clearances for Regional personnel requiring access to classified intelligence.

(b) Security clearances granted under this system shall be valid across all federal and Regional entities, subject to periodic review.

## Part II: Rules for Sharing and Civil Liberties Protection

### Section 11. Permissible Information Sharing

(a) Intelligence and law enforcement information may be shared through the Network only for the purposes of:
    - (1) Counterterrorism.
    - (2) Counterintelligence.
    - (3) Preventing serious violent crime.
    - (4) Protecting critical infrastructure.
    - (5) Responding to major disasters or public health emergencies.

(b) Information shared must be relevant and necessary to the authorized purpose.

### Section 12. Protection of U.S. Persons Information

(a) Information concerning U.S. persons collected by federal intelligence agencies shall be shared with Regional entities only when:
    - (1) It is directly relevant to an authorized purpose under Section 11(a).
    - (2) It is collected pursuant to a warrant or other lawful authority.
    - (3) It is necessary to prevent an imminent threat to life or property.

(b) All shared information concerning U.S. persons shall be handled in accordance with federal privacy laws and the `Inter-Regional Consumer Protection and Data Privacy Act`.

### Section 13. Prohibition on Political Use

(a) No intelligence or law enforcement information shared through the Network may be used to:
    - (1) Monitor, investigate, or target individuals or groups based on their political beliefs, affiliations, or lawful activities.
    - (2) Influence elections or political campaigns.
    - (3) Suppress dissent or lawful protest.

(b) Any use of the Network for such prohibited purposes shall be subject to severe civil and criminal penalties.

### Section 14. Regional Civil Liberties and Privacy Boards

(a) Each Region shall establish an independent "Regional Civil Liberties and Privacy Board" (the "RCLPB").

(b) The RCLPB shall:
    - (1) Oversee the Fusion Center's compliance with privacy and civil liberties protections.
    - (2) Review Fusion Center activities and audit information access logs.
    - (3) Investigate complaints of misuse of intelligence information.
    - (4) Report annually to the Regional Legislature and the federal Intelligence Oversight Board.

---

## Part III: Oversight and Accountability

### Section 21. Federal Intelligence Oversight Board

(a) The existing federal Intelligence Oversight Board (IOB) shall be expanded to include two (2) non-voting members representing Regional Civil Liberties and Privacy Boards, selected by a council of RCLPB chairs.

(b) The IOB shall:
    - (1) Oversee the entire National Intelligence Sharing Network.
    - (2) Conduct regular audits of federal and Regional compliance with this Act.
    - (3) Investigate allegations of misuse of intelligence information.
    - (4) Report annually to Congress and the DNI on the Network's operations and compliance.

### Section 22. Congressional Oversight

(a) The House and Senate Intelligence Committees shall have oversight authority over the National Intelligence Sharing Network and federal agencies' participation.

(b) The Committees shall receive regular briefings from the DNI and IOB on Network operations, compliance, and any identified abuses.

### Section 23. Judicial Review

(a) Federal courts shall have jurisdiction to hear claims alleging violations of this Act, including misuse of intelligence information or breaches of privacy.

(b) Individuals whose civil liberties or privacy rights have been violated by actions taken under this Act shall have a private right of action for damages and injunctive relief.

### Section 24. Whistleblower Protection

(a) Federal and Regional employees who report waste, fraud, abuse, or violations of this Act shall be protected from retaliation under federal whistleblower protection laws.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Intelligence Politicization

**Attack:** A federal administration or Regional government attempts to use intelligence sharing mechanisms to target political opponents or suppress dissent.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Prohibition on Political Use (Section 13):** Explicitly bans such activities with severe penalties.
-   **RCLPB and IOB Oversight (Sections 14, 21):** Independent boards monitor for abuses and investigate complaints.
-   **Whistleblower Protection (Section 24):** Encourages internal reporting of misuse.
-   **Judicial Review (Section 23):** Provides legal recourse for affected individuals.

**Outcome:** Politicization is explicitly prohibited, subject to multiple layers of independent oversight, and carries significant legal risks for perpetrators.

---

### Attack Vector 2: "Data Creep" and Mass Surveillance

**Attack:** The Network evolves into a de facto mass surveillance system by collecting and aggregating vast amounts of data on U.S. persons without specific suspicion.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Purpose Limitation (Section 11(a)):** Information sharing is limited to specific, authorized purposes (e.g., counterterrorism, serious crime).
-   **Protection of U.S. Persons Information (Section 12):** Requires relevance to an authorized purpose and lawful collection authority.
-   **Data Minimization and Privacy Protections (Section 12(b), Fusion Center standards):** Mandates adherence to privacy principles.
-   **Prohibition on Social Scoring (Digital and AI Governance Framework):** Prevents aggregation for social control.

**Outcome:** The Act aims to prevent mission creep and mass surveillance by strictly limiting the purposes and scope of data sharing, with robust privacy safeguards.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Regional Non-Compliance or Obstruction

**Attack:** A Region refuses to establish a Fusion Center, or obstructs federal oversight, citing Regional sovereignty.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Federal Funding Conditions:** Participation in the Network and adherence to standards can be a condition for receiving federal security or law enforcement grants.
-   **DNI Minimum Standards (Section 2(c)):** Federal standards for Fusion Center operations are binding.
-   **Federal Supremacy:** Federal authority in national security and intelligence sharing is supreme.
-   **Federal Enforcement:** The DNI or DOJ can take enforcement action against non-compliant Regions.

**Outcome:** While Regional autonomy is respected, non-compliance with national security intelligence sharing requirements can lead to loss of federal support and potential federal enforcement.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Defining "relevance" and "necessity" in practice** | Medium | IOB and RCLPB oversight; judicial precedent will refine over time. |
| **Resource constraints for Regional Fusion Centers** | Medium | Federal funding and technical assistance programs for Fusion Centers. |
| **Balancing speed of intelligence sharing with oversight** | High | Real-time audit trails; post-hoc review by oversight boards; expedited judicial review for urgent cases. |
| **Human error or rogue actors within the system** | Medium | Robust training, strict access controls, whistleblower protections, and regular audits. |
