# Public Health Emergency Coordination Framework

This proposal establishes a constitutional and statutory framework for
coordinated multi-regional response to public health emergencies, addressing
the tension between the multi-key authorization safeguards of Article XVII
and the need for rapid pandemic response.

This proposal addresses [Gap 24 — Public Health Emergency Coordination](../04-meta/02-identified-gaps.md)
by creating a specialized emergency pathway that preserves accountability
while enabling faster response to disease outbreaks.

---

## Constitutional Placement

This framework would be incorporated as:

- **Article XVII, Section 5** (Public Health Emergency Provisions) - Constitutional
  provisions creating the specialized emergency pathway
- **Public Health Emergency Coordination Act** - Implementing legislation
  establishing the coordination mechanisms

---

## Purpose

Create a framework that:

- enables rapid, coordinated response to multi-regional disease outbreaks,
- preserves democratic accountability and sunset requirements,
- prevents permanent emergency normalization,
- provides for medical supply coordination and health data sharing, and
- balances regional autonomy with collective action capacity.

---

## Part I: Constitutional Provisions (Article XVII, Section 5)

### 5.1 Public Health Emergency Declaration

(a) **Federal Declaration.** The President may declare a Public Health Emergency
upon:

- (1) certification by the Surgeon General or Director of CDC that a
    communicable disease outbreak poses a substantial threat to public health
    across two or more Regions; and
- (2) documented evidence of active transmission or imminent risk of transmission.

(b) **Regional Trigger.** A Public Health Emergency is automatically triggered
when three or more Regions have independently declared health emergencies for
the same disease within a 30-day period.

(c) **Expedited Authorization.** Unlike general emergencies under Article XVII,
Section 2, initial Public Health Emergency measures may take effect immediately
upon declaration, subject to subsequent review.

(d) **Relationship to Disaster Declarations.** A declaration of a Public Health
Emergency under this section may serve as a qualifying event for a Presidential
Major Disaster Declaration under the `National Disaster Response and Recovery
Coordination Act`, allowing for the activation of federal disaster assistance
and recovery resources to run concurrently with the public health response.

---

### 5.2 Scope of Public Health Emergency Powers

(a) **Authorized Measures.** During a declared Public Health Emergency, federal
authorities may:

- (1) coordinate medical supply distribution across Regions;
- (2) deploy federal medical personnel and resources;
- (3) establish uniform data reporting requirements for disease surveillance;
- (4) invoke Defense Production Act authorities for medical countermeasures;
- (5) issue non-binding public health guidance.

(b) **Regional Authority Preserved.** Public Health Emergencies do not authorize
federal authorities to:

- (1) impose quarantine, isolation, or movement restrictions (these remain
    Regional authorities);
- (2) mandate medical treatment or vaccination (these remain Regional or
    individual decisions);
- (3) override Regional healthcare regulations beyond data reporting;
- (4) deploy military forces for enforcement (subject to Article XV).

(c) **Coordination, Not Coercion.** Federal Public Health Emergency authority
is coordinative; Regions retain authority over healthcare delivery, public
health measures, and enforcement within their boundaries.

---

### 5.3 Accelerated Sunset

(a) **Initial Duration.** A Public Health Emergency expires 60 days after
declaration unless renewed.

(b) **Renewal Requirements.** Renewal requires:

- (1) updated certification of ongoing threat; and
- (2) Congressional approval by majority vote within 45 days of the renewal
    request.

(c) **Regional Opt-Out.** After the initial 60-day period, any Region may
opt out of specific federal coordination measures (except data reporting) with
30 days notice, while remaining subject to the general emergency declaration.

(d) **Maximum Duration.** No Public Health Emergency may extend beyond two years
without Congressional reauthorization by two-thirds vote and approval by a
majority of Regional Governors.

---

### 5.4 Public Health Emergency Limitations

(a) **No DLRS Suspension.** Rights floors established by DLRS may not be
suspended during Public Health Emergencies, consistent with Article III,
Section 4.13.

(b) **No Fiscal Coercion.** Federal Public Health Emergency authority may not
be used to condition non-emergency funding on Regional compliance with emergency
measures.

(c) **Judicial Review.** All Public Health Emergency measures are subject to
expedited judicial review; courts shall decide challenges within 14 days.

(d) **Data Protection.** Health data collected during emergencies:

- (1) may be used only for public health purposes;
- (2) may not be shared with law enforcement without court order;
- (3) shall be de-identified when possible;
- (4) shall be subject to breach notification requirements.

---

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Perpetual Emergency

**Attack:** An administration maintains a Public Health Emergency indefinitely
to retain enhanced powers.

**Countermeasure:**

- 60-day automatic sunset (Section 5.3(a))
- Congressional renewal required (Section 5.3(b))
- Two-year maximum without two-thirds vote and Regional approval (Section 5.3(d))
- Regional opt-out after initial period (Section 5.3(c))

**Outcome:** Emergency extension requires ongoing democratic consent at multiple
levels; perpetual declaration structurally blocked.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Coercive Uniformity

**Attack:** Federal government uses emergency authority to force uniform policies
on Regions.

**Countermeasure:**

- Regional authority over quarantine, treatment, vaccination preserved
  (Section 5.2(b))
- Federal authority explicitly coordinative, not coercive (Section 5.2(c))
- No fiscal coercion (Section 5.4(b))
- Regional opt-out available (Section 5.3(c))

**Outcome:** Regions retain policy autonomy; federal role is coordination and
resource provision, not mandate.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Surveillance Expansion

**Attack:** Health data collection becomes permanent surveillance infrastructure.

**Countermeasure:**

- Data limited to public health purposes (Section 5.4(d)(1))
- No law enforcement sharing without court order (Section 5.4(d)(2))
- Emergency data authorities expire with emergency (Section 303(b))
- Two-year destruction requirement (Section 303(c))

**Outcome:** Health data cannot be repurposed; collection authorities are
time-limited.

---

### Attack Vector 4: PHCC Capture

**Attack:** A hostile administration captures the PHCC to sabotage coordination.

**Countermeasure:**

- Regional representatives are majority of voting members (Section 101(c))
- Regional opt-out available if coordination fails (Section 5.3(c))
- Judicial review of all measures (Section 5.4(c))

**Outcome:** No single actor controls PHCC; Regions can exit failed coordination.

---

### Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| Genuine need for faster response than 60-day cycle | Medium | Initial measures immediate; cycle applies to renewal |
| Regions defect from cooperation during emergency | High | No structural remedy; political accountability |
| Courts slow to rule on 14-day timeline | Medium | Mandamus available; political pressure |
| Supply chain disruption defeats coordination | Critical | Reserves, production authority provide buffer |
