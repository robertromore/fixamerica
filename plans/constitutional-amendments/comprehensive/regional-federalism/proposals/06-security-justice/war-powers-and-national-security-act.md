# War Powers and National Security Act

This proposal re-establishes and clarifies the constitutional balance of power between the President and Congress in decisions regarding the use of military force abroad, and integrates the new Regional structure into national security decision-making.

---

## Purpose

Establish a War Powers and National Security Act that:

- Reforms the process for authorizing the use of military force (AUMF).
- Provides clear definitions for "hostilities" and "imminent threat" to limit unilateral presidential action.
- Establishes a National Security Advisory Council to ensure consultation with Regional governments on matters of war and peace.
- Strengthens congressional oversight and public transparency regarding the use of military force.

## Part I: Congressional War Powers and AUMF Reform

### Section 1. Declaration of War and Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF)

(a) The constitutional power of Congress to declare war is reaffirmed.

(b) The use of the United States Armed Forces in hostilities against any foreign nation shall be lawful only when directed by:
    - (1) A declaration of war by Congress.
    - (2) A specific statutory Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) that meets the requirements of this Act.
    - (3) A national emergency created by attack upon the United States, its territories, or its armed forces, subject to the limitations in Part II.

### Section 2. Requirements for Authorizations for Use of Military Force (AUMFs)

(a) Any new AUMF passed by Congress shall include:
    - (1) **Clear Objectives:** A clear and specific statement of the political and military objectives.
    - (2) **Named Adversaries:** A specific identification of the nations, organizations, or persons against whom the use of force is authorized.
    - (3) **Geographic Scope:** A clearly defined geographic scope for the authorized military operations.
    - (4) **Sunset Clause:** An automatic expiration date for the authorization, not to exceed two years from the date of enactment.

(b) Any extension of an AUMF shall require a new vote by Congress and must meet all the requirements of a new AUMF.

### Section 3. Repeal of Outdated AUMFs

(a) The following statutes are hereby repealed:
    - (1) The Authorization for Use of Military Force of 2001 (Public Law 107-40).
    - (2) The Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 (Public Law 107-243).

## Part II: Presidential Authority and Limitations

### Section 11. Definitions

(a) **Hostilities:** For the purposes of this Act, "hostilities" includes any situation involving the use of lethal or potentially lethal force by or against U.S. Armed Forces, whether or not there is a state of war. This does not include routine training, humanitarian aid, or non-combat deployments for security cooperation.

(b) **Imminent Threat:** A threat is "imminent" only if it is specific, credible, and immediate, such that the window for effective self-defense would be lost if delayed to seek congressional authorization.

### Section 12. Presidential Authority in Case of Attack

(a) The President, as Commander in Chief, has the authority to repel a sudden attack or imminent threat of attack upon the United States, its territories, or its armed forces.

(b) The President shall, within 48 hours of using such authority, report to Congress and the National Security Advisory Council the circumstances, necessity, and scope of the military action.

### Section 13. Limitation on Unauthorized Hostilities

(a) In the absence of a declaration of war or a specific AUMF, the President shall terminate any use of U.S. Armed Forces in hostilities within 60 calendar days.

(b) This 60-day period may be extended by no more than 30 days if the President certifies to Congress that the extension is necessary for the safe withdrawal of U.S. forces.

(c) Authority to use force under this section shall cease immediately if Congress directs the removal of forces by concurrent resolution.

---

## Part III: National Security Advisory Council

### Section 21. Establishment

(a) There is established a "National Security Advisory Council" (the "Council") to serve as a consultative body for the President and Congress on matters of national security.

### Section 22. Composition

(a) The Council shall be composed of:
    - (1) The President (Chair).
    - (2) The Vice President.
    - (3) The Speaker of the House and the House Minority Leader.
    - (4) The Senate Majority Leader and the Senate Minority Leader.
    - (5) One Regional Governor from each of the seven Regions, selected by the Governors of that Region.

### Section 23. Functions

(a) The President shall consult with the Council, when feasible, before:
    - (1) Introducing U.S. Armed Forces into hostilities.
    - (2) Submitting a request for an AUMF to Congress.
    - (3) Making major strategic decisions regarding ongoing conflicts.

(b) The Council's role is strictly advisory. It provides a forum for ensuring that the domestic implications of national security decisions, including impacts on Regional economies and populations, are considered at the highest level.

---

## Part IV: Reporting and Transparency

### Section 31. Enhanced Reporting

(a) The President shall provide regular and comprehensive reports to Congress and the National Security Advisory Council on the status, scope, and duration of all ongoing uses of U.S. Armed Forces.

(b) These reports shall include information on all uses of force, including covert actions and drone strikes, subject to classification constraints. A classified annex shall be provided to relevant congressional committees and the Council.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: "Imminent Threat" Abuse

**Attack:** A President uses an overly broad interpretation of "imminent threat" to justify prolonged, unilateral military action without congressional approval.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Strict Definition (Section 11(b)):** The Act provides a clear, narrow definition of "imminent threat" requiring specificity, credibility, and immediacy.
- **60-Day Limit (Section 13):** Even if the initial action is justified, it cannot continue beyond 60 days without congressional authorization, regardless of the threat.
- **Reporting Requirements (Section 12(b)):** The President must publicly justify the action to Congress and the Council within 48 hours.

**Outcome:** The strict definition and hard time limit prevent a president from using a vague threat to wage an open-ended, unauthorized war.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Mission Creep Under an AUMF

**Attack:** An administration expands military operations against new groups or in new countries, claiming they are covered under an existing, broadly worded AUMF.

**Countermeasure:**

- **AUMF Specificity (Section 2):** All new AUMFs must name the specific adversaries and geographic scope.
- **Sunset Clause (Section 2):** All new AUMFs automatically expire after two years, forcing a public debate and re-authorization for any continued conflict.
- **Repeal of Old AUMFs (Section 3):** Eliminates the old, overly broad AUMFs that have been used for this purpose.

**Outcome:** The structure of new AUMFs makes it impossible to legally expand a conflict beyond its original, congressionally approved scope and duration.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Ignoring the Advisory Council

**Attack:** The President fulfills the letter of the law by convening the National Security Advisory Council but ignores all input from congressional and Regional leaders.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Political Costs:** The Council includes the leadership of both parties in Congress and representatives from all Regions. Ignoring their collective advice on a matter of war creates significant political risk and undermines public support.
- **Transparency:** While consultations may be classified, the fact that they occurred is public. Regional Governors and congressional leaders can publicly signal their opposition, even if they cannot reveal details.

**Outcome:** The Council's power is political, not legal. It forces a President to confront opposition from the entire country's leadership structure before taking military action, raising the political threshold for war.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Defining "hostilities" for low-level conflicts** | Medium | The definition is broad, but gray areas (e.g., "advise and assist" missions) will require oversight and judicial precedent. |
| **A compliant Congress abdicating its role** | High | The Act empowers Congress but cannot force it to act. The sunset clause is the strongest mitigation, forcing a vote. |
| **Actions in extreme emergencies** | High | In a true, catastrophic national emergency, a President may act beyond these limits, relying on necessity. This is an inherent tension in any constitutional system. |
