# Regional Guard Force Accountability: Constitutional Floor Provisions

This proposal defines constitutional floor requirements for Regional Guard force
accountability to prevent security forces from becoming instruments of regional
authoritarianism.

This proposal addresses [Gap 23 — Regional Guard Force Accountability](../../04-meta/02-identified-gaps.md)
by establishing minimum civilian oversight, accountability, and use restrictions
that all Regions must meet.

---

## Constitutional Placement

This template would be incorporated as **Article XI, Section 4** (Regional Guard
Accountability Floors), immediately following the existing armed forces provisions.
Alternatively, these floors could be established through DLRS under the "public
integrity and anti-corruption floors" domain if that domain is construed to include
security force accountability.

---

## Purpose

Establish constitutional floor protections ensuring that:

- Regional Guards remain under genuine civilian control,
- Guard forces cannot be used for political intimidation,
- Accountability mechanisms exist for misconduct, and
- Guards remain subject to rights-protecting constraints.

---

## Draft Constitutional Provisions (Article XI, Section 4)

### 4.1 Civilian Control Floor

(a) **Civilian Command.** Each Regional Guard shall be under the command of the
Regional Governor or an appointed civilian official confirmed by the Regional
Legislature.

(b) **Legislative Oversight.** Each Regional Legislature shall have:

- (1) authority to appropriate Guard funding annually;
- (2) subpoena power over Guard operations, personnel, and records;
- (3) authority to confirm or reject appointment of Guard commanding officers
    at the rank of colonel or above.

(c) **No Self-Appointment.** No active-duty Guard officer may simultaneously hold
the position of civilian commander or the office of Regional Governor.

(d) **Inspector General.** Each Region shall maintain an independent Inspector
General for the Regional Guard with:

- (1) appointment by the Regional Legislature (not the executive);
- (2) fixed term of at least four years, not coterminous with the Governor;
- (3) removal only for cause, with documented findings;
- (4) authority to investigate complaints, access records, and publish reports.

---

### 4.2 Prohibited Uses

(a) **Political Activity Prohibition.** Regional Guards may not be used to:

- (1) suppress, disperse, or intimidate lawful political activity, protests, or
    assemblies, except when specific unlawful violence has occurred and civilian
    law enforcement has requested assistance;
- (2) enforce election laws or provide election security except upon invitation
    of the Independent Election Commission;
- (3) conduct surveillance of political organizations, candidates, or campaigns;
- (4) enforce immigration laws except pursuant to formal federal request under
    Article II.

(b) **Domestic Deployment Constraints.** Before deploying Regional Guards for
domestic law enforcement:

- (1) civilian law enforcement must have formally requested assistance;
- (2) the specific mission, duration, and rules of engagement must be documented
    in writing;
- (3) the deployment must be reported to the Regional Legislature within 24 hours;
- (4) deployments exceeding 72 hours require Legislative approval.

(c) **Posse Comitatus Floor.** Regional Guards operating under Regional authority
may not exercise federal law enforcement powers except when federalized pursuant
to Article XI, Section 2.

---

### 4.3 Accountability Mechanisms

(a) **Misconduct Investigation.**

- (1) All complaints of Guard misconduct against civilians shall be investigated
    by an entity independent of the Guard chain of command.
- (2) Investigation findings shall be documented in writing.
- (3) Complainants shall be notified of investigation outcomes within 90 days.
- (4) Sustained misconduct findings shall be reported to the Regional Legislature
    annually.

(b) **Qualified Immunity Floor.** Regional law may not provide Guard members with
immunity from civil liability broader than that available to civilian law
enforcement officers in that Region.

(c) **Criminal Accountability.** Guard members who commit crimes against civilians
while on duty are subject to:

- (1) prosecution in civilian courts;
- (2) Regional criminal law (not solely military justice);
- (3) venue in the jurisdiction where the offense occurred.

(d) **Whistleblower Protection.** Guard members who report waste, fraud, abuse,
unlawful orders, or constitutional violations are protected from retaliation under
the same standards as federal whistleblower protections.

---

### 4.4 Training and Standards

(a) **Constitutional Training.** All Guard members shall receive annual training
on:

- (1) constitutional rights of civilians;
- (2) lawful and unlawful orders;
- (3) prohibited uses under Section 4.2;
- (4) duty to refuse unlawful orders.

(b) **Use of Force Standards.** Regional Guards shall operate under use-of-force
policies that:

- (1) are publicly available;
- (2) require de-escalation when feasible;
- (3) prohibit deadly force except when necessary to prevent imminent death or
    serious bodily injury;
- (4) require reporting of all use-of-force incidents.

(c) **Federal Minimum Standards.** Congress may establish minimum training
standards for all Regional Guards; Regions may exceed but not fall below these
standards.

---

### 4.5 Duty to Refuse Unlawful Orders

(a) **Individual Duty.** Guard members shall refuse to execute orders that:

- (1) violate the Constitution or DLRS floors;
- (2) direct action against lawful political activity absent documented unlawful
    violence;
- (3) direct suppression of free speech, press, or assembly rights;
- (4) constitute crimes under civilian law.

(b) **Good Faith Defense.** A Guard member who refuses an order in good faith
belief that the order is unlawful may not be disciplined for such refusal unless
a court or independent tribunal subsequently determines the order was lawful.

(c) **No Superior Orders Defense.** Compliance with an order is not a defense to
criminal prosecution for constitutional violations or crimes against civilians.

---

### 4.6 Transparency

(a) **Annual Reporting.** Each Region shall publish an annual report on Guard
activities including:

- (1) total personnel and budget;
- (2) domestic deployments (number, duration, purpose);
- (3) use-of-force incidents and outcomes;
- (4) misconduct complaints, investigations, and findings;
- (5) training activities completed.

(b) **Public Records.** Guard policies, training materials, and use-of-force
guidelines shall be public records, subject only to limited redactions for
security-sensitive tactical information.

(c) **No Secret Detention.** Regional Guards may not operate detention facilities
or hold persons without disclosure to civilian courts.

---

### 4.7 Inter-Regional Mutual Aid

(a) **Consent Required.** A Regional Guard may operate in another Region only upon:

- (1) formal request from the receiving Region's Governor;
- (2) written agreement specifying mission, duration, command structure, and
    applicable law.

(b) **Host Region Law Applies.** Guard members operating in another Region are
subject to that Region's civilian criminal law.

(c) **No Federal Override.** Federal authorities may not direct Regional Guards
to operate in other Regions without consent of both the sending and receiving
Regions, except when federalized pursuant to Article XI, Section 2.

---

### 4.8 Regional Flexibility Above Floors

(a) Regions may establish accountability standards, oversight mechanisms, and
use restrictions exceeding these floors.

(b) Regions may create additional independent oversight bodies, civilian review
boards, or reporting requirements.

(c) Nothing in this Section prevents Regions from maintaining Guards under
stricter constraints than required by these floors.

---

### 4.9 Enforcement

(a) **Standing.** Any person whose rights have been violated by Guard action has
standing to seek judicial relief.

(b) **Injunctive Relief.** Courts may issue preliminary injunctions against Guard
deployments that violate Section 4.2.

(c) **Damages.** Violations of this Section give rise to civil liability;
successful plaintiffs may recover actual damages, reasonable attorney's fees,
and (for willful violations) punitive damages.

(d) **Legislative Enforcement.** Congress may enforce this Section by appropriate
legislation establishing remedies and procedures.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

Following the methodology established in
[Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test](../../03-analysis/04-hostile-reinterpretation.md),
this section tests how bad-faith actors might attempt to abuse these provisions.

### Attack Vector 1: Captured Inspector General

**Attack:** A Regional executive appoints loyalists to the Legislature who then
appoint a compliant Inspector General.

**Countermeasure:**

- IG appointed by Legislature, not executive (Section 4.1(d)(1))
- Fixed term not coterminous with Governor (Section 4.1(d)(2))
- Removal only for cause (Section 4.1(d)(3))
- Whistleblower protection provides alternative reporting channels (Section 4.3(d))

**Outcome:** Capture requires sustained control of Legislature; even captured IG
cannot prevent civilian court enforcement.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Pretextual Deployment

**Attack:** A Governor deploys Guards against political opposition under pretext
of responding to "unlawful violence."

**Countermeasure:**

- Deployment requires specific documented unlawful violence (Section 4.2(a)(1))
- Civilian law enforcement must formally request assistance (Section 4.2(b)(1))
- Written mission and rules of engagement required (Section 4.2(b)(2))
- Legislative reporting within 24 hours (Section 4.2(b)(3))
- Injunctive relief available (Section 4.9(b))

**Outcome:** Pretextual deployment requires falsified documentation subject to
judicial review; creates evidentiary record for subsequent accountability.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Immunity Shield

**Attack:** A Region grants Guard members absolute immunity, preventing civilian
accountability.

**Countermeasure:**

- Qualified immunity floor prevents immunity broader than civilian police
  (Section 4.3(b))
- Criminal prosecution in civilian courts required (Section 4.3(c))
- No superior orders defense (Section 4.5(c))

**Outcome:** Region cannot create immunity shield exceeding civilian law
enforcement norms.

---

### Attack Vector 4: Training Neglect

**Attack:** A Region provides minimal or no constitutional rights training,
creating Guards unaware of limits on their authority.

**Countermeasure:**

- Annual constitutional training required (Section 4.4(a))
- Federal minimum standards authorized (Section 4.4(c))
- Individual duty to refuse unlawful orders exists regardless of training
  (Section 4.5)
- Good faith defense only for refusal, not compliance (Section 4.5(b)-(c))

**Outcome:** Training neglect does not excuse constitutional violations;
individual accountability remains.

---

### Attack Vector 5: Secret Operations

**Attack:** A Region conducts Guard operations in secret, preventing oversight.

**Countermeasure:**

- Annual public reporting required (Section 4.6(a))
- Policies and guidelines are public records (Section 4.6(b))
- No secret detention permitted (Section 4.6(c))
- Legislative subpoena power (Section 4.1(b)(2))

**Outcome:** Secrecy violates constitutional requirements; creates additional
grounds for judicial relief.

---

### Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| Coordinated Legislature-Executive capture | High | Federal enforcement, judicial review |
| Courts unwilling to enjoin deployments | Medium | Damages remedy, political accountability |
| Mass refusal of Guard to follow limits | Critical | Beyond constitutional design |
| Federal government complicit in abuse | Critical | Requires multi-level capture |
