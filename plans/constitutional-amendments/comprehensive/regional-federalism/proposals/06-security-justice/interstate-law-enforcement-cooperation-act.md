# Interstate Law Enforcement Cooperation Act

This proposal establishes the statutory framework for the constitutional
cross-jurisdictional law enforcement provisions (Article I, Section 11),
providing detailed procedures for extradition, hot pursuit, mutual legal
assistance, and information sharing.

---

## Constitutional Foundation

Article I, Section 11 of the Regional Federal Constitution establishes that:

> Jurisdictions shall cooperate in criminal law enforcement through extradition,
> hot pursuit, and mutual legal assistance, while respecting federal rights
> floors and tribal sovereignty.

This Act implements these principles through specific procedures.

---

## Purpose

Establish law enforcement cooperation that:

- ensures extradition for serious crimes,
- provides clear procedures for cross-jurisdictional pursuit,
- facilitates evidence sharing and witness cooperation,
- prevents safe harbors for violent criminals,
- protects federal rights floors and tribal sovereignty.

---

## Part I: Extradition

### Section 1. General Requirement

(a) A person charged with a crime in one jurisdiction who flees to another
jurisdiction shall, upon proper demand, be delivered to the jurisdiction
having jurisdiction over the crime.

(b) **Demand.** Demand shall be made by the executive authority of the
requesting jurisdiction (Governor, Regional executive, or Tribal executive).

(c) **Delivery.** Delivery shall be made by the executive authority of the
receiving jurisdiction within the timelines specified in this Part.

### Section 2. Mandatory Extradition Categories

(a) Extradition shall be mandatory for:

- (1) all crimes punishable by imprisonment of one year or more in the
    requesting jurisdiction,
- (2) all crimes involving violence against persons (assault, battery, murder,
    manslaughter, robbery, kidnapping, domestic violence),
- (3) all crimes involving minors as victims (child abuse, child exploitation,
    child endangerment),
- (4) all crimes involving fraud or financial exploitation exceeding $5,000,
- (5) all crimes involving public corruption or abuse of office.

(b) **Lower Threshold.** For crimes involving violence against persons or
minors, there is no minimum sentence threshold.

### Section 3. Discretionary Extradition

(a) For crimes not in mandatory categories, the receiving jurisdiction may
exercise discretion in granting or denying extradition based on:

- (1) severity of the alleged offense,
- (2) strength of the evidence,
- (3) connection of the accused to the receiving jurisdiction,
- (4) humanitarian considerations.

(b) **Presumption.** There is a presumption in favor of extradition.
Discretion to deny should be exercised sparingly.

### Section 4. Grounds for Declining Extradition

(a) A jurisdiction may decline extradition only where:

- (1) **Rights Floor Violation.** The requesting jurisdiction seeks to impose
    a sentence that would violate federal rights floors (e.g., death penalty
    where constitutionally prohibited for the offense type).

- (2) **Persecution Risk.** There is substantial evidence that the person will
    face persecution unrelated to the alleged crime (political persecution,
    religious persecution, persecution based on protected characteristics).

- (3) **Non-Criminal Conduct.** The alleged conduct is not criminal in the
    receiving jurisdiction AND does not involve violence, fraud, or harm to
    minors.

(b) **Burden of Proof.** The person resisting extradition bears the burden
of proving grounds for refusal.

### Section 5. Extradition Timeline

(a) **Sixty-Day Limit.** Extradition proceedings shall be completed within
sixty days of demand.

(b) **Process.** The sixty-day period includes:

- (1) initial hearing within 10 days,
- (2) opportunity for the accused to contest extradition,
- (3) judicial determination of legal sufficiency,
- (4) appeal (if any) within 30 days,
- (5) physical transfer.

(c) **Failure to Complete.** If proceedings are not completed within sixty
days, custody shall be transferred to federal authorities (U.S. Marshals)
for completion of extradition.

(d) **Waiver.** The accused may waive full proceedings and consent to
immediate extradition.

### Section 6. Sentence Assurances

(a) If the receiving jurisdiction declines extradition based on rights floor
concerns, the requesting jurisdiction may provide assurances that:

- (1) the specific sentence type of concern will not be imposed, or
- (2) the prosecution will be limited to charges that do not carry the
    concerning sentence.

(b) **Effect of Assurances.** Valid assurances remove the ground for refusal.
Violation of assurances by the requesting jurisdiction creates grounds for
federal intervention and sanctions.

---

## Part II: Hot Pursuit

### Section 11. General Authorization

(a) Law enforcement officers in fresh pursuit of a person for a felony offense
may continue pursuit across jurisdictional boundaries without interruption.

(b) **Felony Offense.** Hot pursuit authority applies only to felony offenses,
not misdemeanors (except where the misdemeanor involves violence or threat
of violence).

(c) **Fresh Pursuit.** Pursuit is "fresh" if it is continuous or substantially
continuous from the commission of the offense or from the initiation of
lawful arrest.

### Section 12. Notification Requirements

(a) Officers engaged in hot pursuit shall:

- (1) notify the law enforcement authorities of the jurisdiction entered as
    soon as practicable (by radio, telephone, or dispatch),
- (2) identify themselves and their agency,
- (3) describe the nature of the offense and the suspect.

(b) **Practicability.** Notification is not required before entry; it shall
be made as soon as safely practicable during pursuit.

### Section 13. Authority and Limitations

(a) **Authority.** During hot pursuit, officers may:

- (1) continue pursuit,
- (2) apprehend the suspect,
- (3) use reasonable force (subject to subsection (b)),
- (4) secure the scene pending arrival of local authorities.

(b) **Use of Force Standards.** Officers in hot pursuit shall comply with the
use-of-force standards of the jurisdiction in which they are operating.

(c) **Deference.** Upon arrival of local law enforcement:

- (1) pursuing officers shall defer to local authorities unless immediate
    action is necessary to prevent harm,
- (2) local authorities may assume primary responsibility for the arrest
    and custody.

### Section 14. Custody Transfer

(a) Following apprehension during hot pursuit, the suspect shall be:

- (1) held in custody by the jurisdiction where apprehended,
- (2) extradited to the requesting jurisdiction pursuant to Part I.

(b) **Expedited Extradition.** Hot pursuit cases shall receive expedited
extradition processing (thirty days rather than sixty days).

## Part III: Mutual Legal Assistance

### Section 21. Cooperation Requirements

(a) Jurisdictions shall cooperate in criminal investigations by:

- (1) honoring lawfully issued subpoenas and warrants from other jurisdictions,
- (2) sharing evidence and records upon proper request,
- (3) facilitating witness testimony across jurisdictional boundaries.

(b) **Lawfully Issued.** A subpoena or warrant is "lawfully issued" if it:

- (1) was issued by a court of competent jurisdiction,
- (2) meets the legal requirements of the issuing jurisdiction,
- (3) does not require conduct that would violate federal rights floors.

### Section 22. Subpoena and Warrant Recognition

(a) **Document Subpoenas.** Subpoenas for documents issued by one jurisdiction
shall be honored by record custodians in other jurisdictions.

(b) **Witness Subpoenas.** Subpoenas for witness testimony shall be honored
subject to:

- (1) reasonable notice (at least 14 days),
- (2) payment of witness fees and travel expenses by the requesting
    jurisdiction,
- (3) accommodation of the witness's employment and personal obligations.

(c) **Search Warrants.** Search warrants issued by one jurisdiction shall be
executed by law enforcement in other jurisdictions upon request.

### Section 23. Evidence Sharing

(a) Upon proper request, jurisdictions shall share:

- (1) physical evidence,
- (2) documentary evidence,
- (3) forensic analysis results,
- (4) witness statements,
- (5) investigative reports.

(b) **Chain of Custody.** Evidence sharing shall maintain proper chain of
custody documentation.

(c) **Cost Allocation.** Costs of evidence collection and transmission shall
be borne by the requesting jurisdiction.

### Section 24. Witness Facilitation

(a) Jurisdictions shall facilitate witness testimony by:

- (1) allowing testimony by video conference where appropriate,
- (2) arranging secure transportation for witnesses in protective custody,
- (3) coordinating scheduling to minimize witness burden.

(b) **Witness Protection.** Where witnesses face risk of retaliation, the
requesting jurisdiction shall provide protection arrangements.

- (2) political targeting,
- (3) discrimination based on protected characteristics,
- (4) purposes unrelated to law enforcement.

### Section 33. Oversight

(a) The Department of Justice shall establish oversight mechanisms for
information sharing systems.

(b) **Annual Reports.** DOJ shall report annually to Congress on:

- (1) system usage patterns,
- (2) privacy incidents,
- (3) system effectiveness,
- (4) recommended improvements.

## Part V: Safe Harbor Prohibition

### Section 41. General Prohibition

(a) No jurisdiction may adopt policies designed to shield individuals from
lawful prosecution in other jurisdictions for crimes of violence, fraud, or
harm to minors.

(b) **Designed to Shield.** A policy is "designed to shield" if its purpose
or primary effect is to prevent extradition or prosecution of persons
accused of serious crimes.

### Section 42. Scope

(a) **Covered Crimes.** The safe harbor prohibition applies to:

- (1) crimes of violence against persons,
- (2) crimes involving fraud exceeding $5,000,
- (3) crimes involving harm to minors,
- (4) crimes involving public corruption.

(b) **Excluded.** The safe harbor prohibition does not apply to:

- (1) refusal to enforce laws that would violate federal rights floors,
- (2) refusal to participate in enforcement actions determined to be
    pretextual or politically motivated,
- (3) general policies regarding cooperation with federal immigration
    enforcement (which are governed by separate constitutional provisions).

### Section 43. Enforcement

(a) If a jurisdiction maintains safe harbor policies in violation of this
section:

enforcement of laws that would violate federal rights floors.

(b) **Examples.** Rights floors include:

- (1) prohibitions on cruel and unusual punishment,
- (2) due process requirements,
- (3) equal protection guarantees,
- (4) prohibitions on discrimination.

### Section 52. Pretext and Political Motivation

(a) Jurisdictions may decline to cooperate in enforcement actions that the
receiving jurisdiction determines are pretextual or politically motivated.

(b) **Pretext.** An action is pretextual if the stated criminal charge is not
the genuine motivation for the prosecution.

(c) **Political Motivation.** An action is politically motivated if it
targets individuals based on political activity or affiliation rather than
criminal conduct.

(d) **Determination.** The receiving jurisdiction makes this determination
through its executive or judicial process. Determinations are subject to
review if challenged.

### Section 53. Tribal Sovereignty

(a) Nothing in this Act shall be construed to diminish the sovereign authority
of Tribal Nations over criminal matters within their jurisdiction.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Extradition Delay

**Attack:** A jurisdiction delays extradition proceedings to effectively
protect the accused from prosecution.

**Countermeasure:**

- Sixty-day deadline with automatic federal takeover (Section 5)
- Specific process timeline requirements (Section 5(b))
- Waiver option for accused (Section 5(d))

**Outcome:** Delay tactics fail; federal takeover ensures extradition proceeds.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Pretextual Prosecution Claim

**Attack:** A jurisdiction refuses extradition for all cases, claiming all
are pretextual or politically motivated.

**Countermeasure:**

- Burden on person resisting extradition (Section 4(b))
- Determination subject to review (Section 52(d))
- Pattern of refusal creates grounds for federal intervention
- Mandatory categories with limited exceptions (Section 2)

**Outcome:** Systematic abuse of pretext exception is reviewable; pattern
creates enforcement authority.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Hot Pursuit Abuse

**Attack:** Officers use hot pursuit authority to conduct operations in
other jurisdictions for non-pursuit purposes.

**Countermeasure:**

- Felony offense requirement (Section 11(b))
- Fresh pursuit requirement (Section 11(c))
- Local authority deference (Section 13(c))
- Use-of-force standards of entry jurisdiction (Section 13(b))

**Outcome:** Hot pursuit is narrowly defined; abuse subjects officers to
local jurisdiction's standards and authority.

---

### Attack Vector 4: Information Weaponization

**Attack:** A jurisdiction uses shared information systems to target political
opponents or conduct unauthorized surveillance.

**Countermeasure:**

- Access controls (Section 32(a)(1))
- Audit trails (Section 32(a)(2))
- Prohibited uses (Section 32(b))
- DOJ oversight (Section 33)
- Criminal liability for abuse

**Outcome:** Surveillance abuse is prohibited, auditable, and subject to
criminal penalties.

---

### Attack Vector 5: Safe Harbor by Another Name

**Attack:** A jurisdiction creates effective safe harbor through procedural
obstacles, resource allocation decisions, or non-enforcement policies.

**Countermeasure:**

- "Purpose or primary effect" standard (Section 41(b))
- Federal enforcement authority (Section 43)
- Injunctive relief available (Section 43(a)(1))
- Pattern analysis reveals intentional non-cooperation

**Outcome:** Effective safe harbor is caught by effect standard; systematic
non-cooperation is actionable.

### Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| Resource constraints on extradition | Medium | Federal takeover after deadline |
| Legitimate pretext determinations | Low | Review mechanism; pattern analysis |
| Tribal jurisdiction complexity | Medium | Good faith agreements; respect for sovereignty |
| Political pressure on enforcement | Medium | Federal court jurisdiction; expedited review |
