# Inter-Regional Family Law and Personal Status Act

This proposal establishes a framework for the recognition and enforcement of family law matters—including marriage, divorce, child custody, and adoption—across Regional boundaries to ensure legal certainty and stability for families.

---

## Purpose

Establish a framework for Inter-Regional Family Law and Personal Status that:

-   Mandates full faith and credit for personal status judgments (marriage, divorce, adoption) across all Regions.
-   Streamlines the inter-regional enforcement of child custody and support orders.
-   Facilitates inter-regional adoptions and recognition of guardianship.
-   Creates a secure data-sharing framework for enforcing family law orders.
-   Establishes a council to mediate disputes and harmonize family law practices.

## Part I: Full Faith and Credit for Personal Status

### Section 1. Mandatory Recognition of Final Judgments

(a) A final judgment, decree, or order regarding personal status—including marriage, divorce, annulment, legal separation, domestic partnership, adoption, or parentage—issued by a court of competent jurisdiction in any Region shall be recognized as valid and given full faith and credit in all other Regions.

(b) No Region may require the re-litigation of a personal status determination that has been finally adjudicated in another Region.

### Section 2. Marriage and Domestic Partnership Recognition

(a) A marriage or domestic partnership validly entered into in one Region shall be recognized as valid in all other Regions.

(b) This section does not prohibit a Region from allowing marriages or partnerships under different terms than other Regions, but it mandates recognition of those legally established elsewhere.

---

## Part II: Child Custody and Support Enforcement

### Section 11. Uniform Enforcement Framework

(a) The principles of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA) and the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA) are hereby adopted as the federal floor for resolving inter-regional custody and support disputes.

(b) **Continuing, Exclusive Jurisdiction.** The court that makes an initial child custody or support determination shall retain continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the matter, preventing conflicting orders from other Regions.

(c) A Region may modify an order from another Region only if it finds that the original Region no longer has exclusive, continuing jurisdiction or has declined to exercise it.

### Section 12. National Child Support and Custody Registry

(a) The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) shall establish and maintain a "National Child Support and Custody Registry."

(b) The Registry shall serve as a central database for all child support and custody orders, facilitating inter-regional enforcement.

(c) Regional courts and child support enforcement agencies shall report all new orders and modifications to the Registry within 30 days.

---

## Part III: Inter-Regional Adoption and Guardianship

### Section 21. Inter-Regional Adoption Compacts

(a) Regions are authorized and encouraged to form "Inter-Regional Adoption Compacts" to streamline the process for adopting children across Regional boundaries.

(b) Compacts shall aim to harmonize requirements for home studies, post-placement supervision, and finalization procedures.

### Section 22. Recognition of Adoption and Guardianship

(a) A final order of adoption or guardianship over a minor or incapacitated adult issued by a court of competent jurisdiction in any Region shall be recognized as valid and given full effect in all other Regions.

(b) Upon relocation, a guardian appointed in one Region shall not be required to be re-appointed in a new Region to exercise their legal authority.

---

## Part IV: Data Sharing and Coordination

### Section 31. Federal Family Law Data System

(a) HHS, in coordination with the Department of Justice, shall establish a secure, interoperable "Federal Family Law Data System."

(b) The system shall facilitate the exchange of information necessary for the enforcement of family law orders, including:
    - (1) The National Child Support and Custody Registry (Part II, Section 12).
    - (2) A national registry for protection orders related to domestic violence.

(c) **Privacy Protections.** The system shall incorporate robust privacy and security safeguards, including purpose limitation, data minimization, and access controls, consistent with the `Inter-Regional Consumer Protection and Data Privacy Act`.

---

## Part V: Oversight and Dispute Resolution

### Section 41. Inter-Regional Family Law Council

(a) There is established an "Inter-Regional Family Law Council" (the "Council").

(b) **Composition.** The Council shall be composed of:
    - (1) A representative from the federal HHS.
    - (2) One judicial officer specializing in family law from each Region, appointed by the Regional Supreme Court.
    - (3) One administrator from each Regional child support enforcement agency.

(c) **Functions.** The Council shall:
    - (1) Mediate disputes between Regions regarding the interpretation or enforcement of this Act.
    - (2) Develop model laws and best practices for inter-regional family law matters.
    - (3) Issue advisory opinions on complex or novel inter-regional family law issues.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Regional Refusal to Recognize Status

**Attack:** A Region with strong public policy against a certain type of marriage or adoption refuses to recognize a valid decree from another Region, citing its own "public policy exception."

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Explicit Mandate (Section 1(a)):** The Act explicitly mandates recognition of final judgments, superseding any regional public policy objections.
-   **Constitutional Backing:** This Act codifies the Full Faith and Credit Clause for the regional system, giving it constitutional weight.
-   **Federal Court Enforcement:** Aggrieved parties can seek enforcement orders in federal court, which have supremacy over Regional court refusals.

**Outcome:** A Region's public policy preferences cannot override a final, valid judgment from another Region regarding personal status.

---

### Attack Vector 2: "Forum Shopping" for Favorable Rulings

**Attack:** A parent moves to a Region with more favorable custody or support laws and attempts to get a new, conflicting court order.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Continuing, Exclusive Jurisdiction (Section 11(b)):** The Act codifies the UCCJEA/UIFSA principle that only the court that issued the *initial* order can modify it, unless it formally relinquishes jurisdiction.
-   **National Registry (Section 12):** The national registry allows a court in the new Region to quickly verify that another court has exclusive jurisdiction, compelling it to dismiss the case.

**Outcome:** "Forum shopping" is rendered ineffective, as the original court retains control over the case, ensuring stability and preventing conflicting orders.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Data System Abuse

**Attack:** Federal or Regional agencies attempt to use the Federal Family Law Data System for purposes unrelated to family law enforcement, such as immigration enforcement or general surveillance.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Strict Purpose Limitation (Section 31(c)):** The Act, referencing the broader data privacy framework, strictly limits the use of data to its intended purpose.
-   **Data Minimization:** The system is designed to share only the data necessary for enforcement (e.g., the existence of an order), not the entire case file.
-   **Penalties and Oversight:** The framework includes strict civil and criminal penalties for misuse and provides for independent oversight.

**Outcome:** The data system is firewalled to prevent its use for purposes other than family law enforcement, protecting the privacy of individuals involved.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Conflicting international family law orders** | Medium | Requires coordination with international treaties (e.g., Hague Convention) and federal foreign policy. |
| **Complexity of harmonizing diverse Regional procedures** | Medium | The Council can develop model procedures; federal technical assistance can support harmonization. |
| **Funding for data system and enforcement** | High | Requires sustained federal appropriations; linking funding to compliance can incentivize participation. |
| **Determining "competent jurisdiction" in novel cases** | Low | The Council can issue advisory opinions; federal courts will ultimately establish precedent. |
