## Purpose

Establish a framework for Immigration and Border Security that:

- Clarifies the division of labor between federal and Regional authorities on immigration matters.
- Reaffirms exclusive federal authority over admissions, naturalization, and border control.
- Establishes a cooperative framework for enforcement and humanitarian response.
- Empowers and funds Regions to manage the integration of lawfully present immigrants.
- Sets humane federal standards for the civil detention of non-citizens.

## Part I: Jurisdictional Allocation

### Section 1. Exclusive Federal Authority

(a) The federal government shall retain exclusive authority to:
    - (1) Determine who may enter, remain in, or be removed from the United States.
    - (2) Issue visas and other travel documents.
    - (3) Establish standards and processes for naturalization.
    - (4) Set annual levels and categories for immigration.

### Section 2. Regional Authority

(a) Regions shall have primary authority over the integration of lawfully present immigrants residing within their boundaries, including the provision of language education, workforce training, and access to Regional social services, consistent with federal law.

(b) No Region may create its own immigration status, independently grant a right of residence, or enact laws that either prohibit or compel cooperation with federal immigration authorities.

---

## Part II: Enforcement and Border Security Coordination

### Section 11. Coordinated Enforcement

(a) **Federal Role.** Federal agencies, including a reformed Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), are the lead agencies for federal immigration and customs law enforcement.

(b) **Regional Role.** The primary role of Regional and local law enforcement is the enforcement of Regional and local criminal law, regardless of an individual's immigration status.

(c) **No Compulsion.** Regional and local law enforcement agencies shall not be compelled to perform the duties of federal immigration officers.

(d) **Voluntary Agreements.** Regions may voluntarily enter into agreements with the federal government to assist in immigration enforcement. Any such agreement must be approved by the Regional legislature, be publicly transparent, and include strict oversight and civil rights protections.

### Section 12. Information Sharing and Detainers

(a) Federal immigration authorities may request criminal history information from Regional law enforcement agencies, consistent with the `Interstate Law Enforcement Cooperation Act`.

(b) An administrative detainer request issued by a federal immigration agency to a Regional or local jail shall be considered a non-mandatory request for notification. A Region may only detain an individual beyond their scheduled release date on the basis of such a request if it is accompanied by a judicial warrant.

### Section 13. Border Security Councils

(a) For each Region bordering an international boundary, there is established a "Border Security Council."

(b) **Composition.** The Council shall include representatives from:
    - (1) Relevant federal agencies (e.g., CBP, Coast Guard).
    - (2) The Regional Governor's office and Regional law enforcement.
    - (3) Affected local and Tribal governments.

(c) **Functions.** The Council shall coordinate on security operations, infrastructure needs, and humanitarian response protocols at the border.

### Section 14. Federal Detention Standards

(a) The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in consultation with civil rights experts, shall establish and enforce binding federal standards for all facilities used for the civil detention of non-citizens.

(b) These standards shall govern medical and mental healthcare, sanitation, access to legal counsel, family unity, and conditions of confinement, and shall be based on principles of civil, not criminal, detention.

(c) Regional public health and safety inspectors shall have the right to conduct unannounced inspections of any such facility within their borders to ensure compliance with both federal and Regional standards.

---

## Part III: Immigrant Integration

### Section 21. Regional Integration Programs

(a) Regions are authorized to establish and manage comprehensive "Immigrant Integration Programs" for lawfully present immigrants.

(b) These programs may include language instruction, workforce development, civics education, and assistance with the naturalization process.

### Section 22. Federal Immigrant Integration Fund

(a) There is established in the Treasury a "Federal Immigrant Integration Fund."

(b) The Fund shall be financed by:
    - (1) A 10% surcharge on all immigration and visa application fees.
    - (2) Annual appropriations from Congress.

(c) Funds shall be distributed to Regions via a formula based on the population of foreign-born residents and recent immigrant arrivals.

---

## Part IV: Oversight and Accountability

### Section 31. Immigration and Border Oversight Board

(a) There is established an independent "Immigration and Border Oversight Board" (the "Board").

(b) The Board shall be composed of members with expertise in immigration law, civil rights, and law enforcement, appointed to staggered terms by diverse authorities (federal, Regional, judicial).

(c) The Board shall review enforcement actions, detention conditions, and the functioning of Border Security Councils, and shall issue public reports and recommendations.

### Section 32. Data Transparency

(a) Federal immigration agencies shall publish quarterly, disaggregated data on enforcement actions (arrests, detentions, removals), detention populations, and asylum processing.

(b) This data shall be made available to the public in a machine-readable format.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Federal Coercion of Regional Enforcement

**Attack:** A federal administration attempts to force Regional and local police to act as federal immigration agents by threatening to withhold unrelated federal funds (e.g., transportation, justice grants).

**Countermeasure:**

- **No Compulsion Clause (Section 11(c)):** The Act explicitly states Regions cannot be compelled to perform federal immigration duties.
- **Anti-Coercion Rule:** The constitutional Anti-Coercion Rule (from the `Fiscal Equalization Act`) prohibits the federal government from conditioning funds on actions unrelated to the purpose of the funds.
- **Judicial Review:** Regions would have clear standing to challenge such coercion in federal court.

**Outcome:** The combination of statutory prohibition and constitutional safeguards makes it extremely difficult for the federal government to commandeer Regional law enforcement for immigration purposes.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Regional Obstructionism

**Attack:** A Region refuses all forms of cooperation, such as sharing criminal conviction data or participating in a Border Security Council, creating security and operational gaps.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Federal Supremacy at the Border:** Federal authority to control the border is exclusive and supreme. While cooperation is ideal, federal agencies can operate independently if necessary.
- **Information Sharing Mandates:** The `Interstate Law Enforcement Cooperation Act` already provides a framework for sharing criminal data, which this Act references.
- **Political and Financial Incentives:** Federal funding for integration and other programs provides an incentive for good-faith cooperation.

**Outcome:** While a Region can adopt a non-cooperative stance, it cannot legally obstruct core federal functions. This would likely result in a loss of federal support and increased unilateral federal action within the Region.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Neglect of Integration Funding

**Attack:** A nativist Congress or administration refuses to appropriate money for the Federal Immigrant Integration Fund, leaving Regions with the unfunded burden of integration.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Dedicated Funding Stream (Section 22(b)(1)):** A portion of the Fund is financed by a dedicated surcharge on visa fees, creating a revenue stream independent of annual appropriations.
- **Formula-Based Distribution (Section 22(c)):** The distribution formula creates a legal entitlement for Regions to their share of collected funds.
- **Legal Standing:** Regions would have standing to sue the federal government to compel the disbursement of funds collected through the visa surcharge.

**Outcome:** While Congress could still refuse to provide supplemental appropriations, the dedicated fee-based funding provides a stable floor for integration programs that is insulated from the annual political budget process.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Defining "cooperation" vs. "compulsion" in practice** | Medium | Oversight Board and judicial precedent will be required to draw clear lines. |
| **Political volatility of immigration policy** | High | The Act aims to create stable, de-politicized processes, but immigration remains a deeply partisan issue that will test the framework. |
| **Humanitarian crises at the border overwhelming capacity** | High | Border Security Councils are designed for proactive planning, but catastrophic events may still strain resources beyond planned capacity. |
| **Inadequate funding for detention standards** | Medium | Linking standards to HHS, a health agency, and allowing Regional inspections creates pressure for adequate funding and conditions. |
