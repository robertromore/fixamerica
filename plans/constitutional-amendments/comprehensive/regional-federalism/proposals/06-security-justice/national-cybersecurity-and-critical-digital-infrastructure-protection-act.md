### Section 12. Federal-Regional Cyber Coordination Centers (FR-CCCs)

(a) CISA shall establish and co-fund a network of "Federal-Regional Cyber Coordination Centers," with at least one center in each Region.

(b) Each FR-CCC shall serve as the primary hub for:
    - (1) Real-time threat intelligence sharing between federal agencies, the Region, and private sector partners.
    - (2) Coordinating incident response activities within the Region.
    - (3) Providing technical assistance and training to Regional entities.

---

## Part III: Cyber Incident Response

### Section 21. National Cyber Incident Response Protocol

(a) CISA shall develop and maintain a National Cyber Incident Response Protocol that defines the roles, responsibilities, and coordination mechanisms for federal, Regional, and private sector entities during a significant cyber incident.

(b) The Protocol shall establish a clear "Cyber-Triage" system for classifying the severity of incidents and triggering appropriate levels of federal and Regional response.

### Section 22. Mandatory Incident Reporting

(a) Operators of designated Critical Digital Infrastructure shall report any significant cyber incident to CISA and their respective FR-CCC within 24 hours of discovery.

(b) "Significant cyber incident" shall be defined by CISA regulation but includes any incident that results in a substantial loss of service, a major data breach, or unauthorized access to critical control systems.

(c) Reports made under this section shall be protected from public disclosure to encourage timely and transparent reporting.

### Section 23. Cybersecurity Emergency Declaration

(a) The President may declare a "Cybersecurity Emergency" upon a finding by the Director of CISA and the National Cyber Director that a major cyber incident poses an imminent threat to national security, economic stability, or public health and safety across multiple Regions.

(b) A Cybersecurity Emergency declaration authorizes the federal government to:
    - (1) Direct the response and recovery efforts of affected critical infrastructure operators.
    - (2) Deploy federal cybersecurity response teams to assist Regional and private entities.
    - (3) Waive certain regulations to expedite recovery, subject to congressional oversight.

(c) A Cybersecurity Emergency declaration shall expire after 30 days unless extended by Congress.

---

## Part IV: Workforce Development and Funding

### Section 31. National Cybersecurity Workforce Development Program

(a) The federal government shall establish a grant program, administered by CISA and the Department of Labor, to fund and coordinate federal-Regional programs to develop a skilled cybersecurity workforce.

(b) Programs shall include scholarships, apprenticeships, and curriculum development for higher education and vocational training institutions.

### Section 32. Federal Funding for Regional Cybersecurity

(a) The federal government shall provide grants to Regions to assist them in meeting federal cybersecurity standards, establishing FR-CCCs, and building their incident response capacity.

(b) Receipt of such funding shall be conditioned on compliance with the requirements of this Act.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Federal Overreach

**Attack:** A federal administration uses its authority to establish minimum standards and declare emergencies to micromanage Regional cyber defenses and private sector operations for political or economic advantage.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Council Composition (Section 2(b)):** The National Cybersecurity Coordination Council has strong Regional representation to provide a check on federal unilateralism.
- **Public Rulemaking (Section 3(a)):** Designation of critical infrastructure and establishment of standards require a public rulemaking process with judicial review.
- **Federal Floors, Not Ceilings (Section 11(c)):** The Act explicitly preserves Regional authority to enact stricter protections.
- **Emergency Declaration Limits (Section 23(c)):** Emergency powers are time-limited and require Congressional extension.

**Outcome:** Federal authority is balanced by Regional input, public process, and clear statutory limits, making sustained overreach difficult.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Regional Negligence or Non-Compliance

**Attack:** A Region fails to enforce federal cybersecurity standards on its critical infrastructure, creating a weak link in the national defense that could be exploited by adversaries.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Conditional Funding (Section 32(b)):** Federal cybersecurity grants are conditioned on compliance with federal standards.
- **CISA Audits:** CISA has authority to audit compliance of critical infrastructure operators, regardless of Region.
- **Federal Enforcement:** The Department of Justice can bring enforcement actions against non-compliant operators or Regions that fail to enforce.
- **Mandatory Incident Reporting (Section 22):** Failures in security that lead to incidents will be reported, exposing negligence.

**Outcome:** Non-compliance carries significant financial and legal risks, creating strong incentives for Regions to enforce federal floors.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Industry Capture and Resistance

**Attack:** Powerful critical infrastructure operators lobby to weaken cybersecurity standards, under-report incidents, or resist federal oversight, claiming proprietary concerns or excessive cost.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Public Rulemaking Process (Section 3(a), 11(a)):** Standards are set through a transparent process with public input, not backroom deals.
- **Mandatory Reporting with Penalties (Section 22):** Failure to report incidents carries significant fines.
- **Protected Reporting (Section 22(c)):** Reports are protected from public disclosure, reducing industry reluctance to share sensitive information.
- **National Security Imperative:** The national security justification for standards provides a strong counter-argument to industry cost concerns.

**Outcome:** While industry influence is a constant factor, the transparent and public nature of the standard-setting process, combined with clear enforcement mechanisms, provides a strong check against capture.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Rapidly Evolving Threats** | High | Biennial strategy updates; CISA's authority to update standards through regulation allows for adaptation. |
| **Shortage of Skilled Cybersecurity Personnel** | High | National workforce development programs (Section 31) are designed to address this, but it remains a long-term challenge. |
| **Global Nature of Cyber Threats** | High | This Act focuses on domestic defense; requires coordination with international treaties and foreign policy. |
| **Complexity of Public-Private Coordination** | Medium | FR-CCCs (Section 12) are designed to be the primary forum for building trust and coordinating between government and private sector. |
