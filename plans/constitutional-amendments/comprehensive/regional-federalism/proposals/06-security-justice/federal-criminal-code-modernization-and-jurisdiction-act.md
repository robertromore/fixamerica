# Federal Criminal Code Modernization and Jurisdiction Act

This proposal defines a clear, limited, and principled scope for federal criminal law, focusing on genuinely inter-regional and national issues, and prevents federal overreach into matters best handled by Regional justice systems.

---

## Purpose

Establish a Federal Criminal Code Modernization and Jurisdiction Act that:

- Establishes a clear "federal nexus" principle to limit the scope of federal criminal law.
- Mandates a comprehensive review and re-codification of the U.S. Criminal Code to eliminate federal overreach.
- Creates clear protocols for managing concurrent federal-Regional jurisdiction.
- Limits the mandate of federal law enforcement agencies to investigating crimes with a clear federal nexus.

## Part I: Principles of Federal Criminal Jurisdiction

### Section 1. Guiding Principle

(a) Federal criminal law shall be limited to offenses with a clear and substantial federal nexus, reserving the general police power to the Regions.

### Section 2. Definition of Federal Nexus

(a) A "federal nexus" exists for offenses that involve:
    - (1) **Crimes Against the Federal Government:** Offenses targeting federal officials, property, or the administration of federal programs (e.g., treason, espionage, assassination of a federal official, theft from a federal facility).
    - (2) **Inter-Regional Crimes:** Crimes where a core element of the offense involves crossing Regional boundaries (e.g., kidnapping across Regional lines, complex wire fraud schemes spanning multiple Regions).
    - (3) **National Security Offenses:** Crimes related to terrorism, counterintelligence, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
    - (4) **Complex Economic Crimes:** Crimes that threaten the stability of the national financial market or involve sophisticated, multi-regional criminal organizations (e.g., major securities fraud, racketeering).
    - (5) **Violations of National Rights Floors:** Offenses involving the violation of fundamental civil rights as established by the Constitution or federal statutes enacted under the `Dual-Legitimacy Rights-Floor Statute`.
    - (6) **Exclusive Federal Jurisdictions:** Crimes committed within areas of exclusive federal jurisdiction (e.g., the District of Columbia, military installations, certain federal territories).

## Part II: Federal Criminal Code Review and Recodification

### Section 11. Federal Criminal Code Review Commission

(a) There is established an independent "Federal Criminal Code Review Commission" (the "Commission").

(b) **Composition.** The Commission shall be composed of 11 members, including retired federal and Regional judges, federal and Regional prosecutors, public defenders, and legal scholars, appointed by diverse authorities (President, Congress, Chief Justice).

### Section 12. Mandate of the Commission

(a) The Commission shall conduct a comprehensive review of Title 18 of the U.S. Code and other federal criminal statutes.

(b) For each statute, the Commission shall assess whether it has a clear federal nexus as defined in Part I of this Act.

### Section 13. Recommendations and Congressional Action

(a) The Commission shall, within three years, submit a report to Congress recommending the repeal or amendment of statutes that lack a clear federal nexus.

(b) Congress shall vote on the Commission's legislative recommendations package, without amendment, within one year of its submission.

## Part III: Concurrent Jurisdiction Protocols

### Section 21. "Most Significant Interest" Test

(a) In cases where both federal and Regional authorities have jurisdiction over an offense, prosecution should be handled by the jurisdiction with the most significant interest in the case.

(b) Factors for determining significant interest include:
    - (1) The location where the primary harm occurred.
    - (2) The residence of the victim(s) and defendant(s).
    - (3) The location of the majority of the evidence.
    - (4) The relative strength of the federal versus Regional interest in the specific conduct.

### Section 22. Federal-Regional Prosecutorial Council

(a) There is established a "Federal-Regional Prosecutorial Council" (the "Council").

(b) **Composition.** The Council shall be composed of the U.S. Attorney General and the chief prosecuting officer of each Region.

(c) **Functions.** The Council shall:
    - (1) Mediate jurisdictional disputes between federal and Regional prosecutors.
    - (2) Establish best practices and model agreements for declination, referral, and joint prosecution.

### Section 23. Prohibition on Dual Prosecution

(a) An individual who has been prosecuted and either convicted or acquitted of an offense in a federal or Regional court may not be subsequently prosecuted for the same offense in the other jurisdiction based on the same underlying conduct.

(b) This provision codifies a prohibition on separate sovereigns prosecuting for the same offense, superseding previous judicial doctrines that allowed such dual prosecutions.

---

## Part IV: Federal Law Enforcement Mandate

### Section 31. Limitation of Mandate

(a) The investigative mandate of federal law enforcement agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), is limited to crimes with a federal nexus as defined in this Act.

(b) Federal law enforcement agencies are prohibited from unilaterally investigating crimes that are properly within Regional jurisdiction, unless:
    - (1) Requested by the relevant Regional authority.
    - (2) As part of a joint task force operating under a formal agreement.
    - (3) The investigation of a federal crime uncovers evidence of a related Regional crime.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Federal Overreach into Local Crime

**Attack:** Federal prosecutors use a minor or incidental inter-regional element (e.g., a car used in a robbery was once driven across a Regional line) to "federalize" a common street crime.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Clear Nexus Definition (Section 2(a)(2)):** The Act requires the inter-regional element to be a *core* part of the offense, not an incidental one.
- **"Most Significant Interest" Test (Section 21):** A court could find that the Region has the most significant interest in a local robbery, regardless of the car's history.
- **Council Mediation (Section 22):** The Prosecutorial Council provides a forum for a Regional prosecutor to challenge federal overreach.

**Outcome:** The clear nexus definition and jurisdictional test provide strong grounds for courts and the Council to push back against federal overreach into local crime.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Federal Neglect of National-Level Crime

**Attack:** A captured or ideologically motivated federal administration refuses to prosecute complex financial crimes or civil rights violations that have a clear federal nexus.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Regional Authority:** Regions are not preempted from prosecuting such conduct under their own laws if applicable (e.g., a Regional law against financial fraud).
- **Congressional Oversight:** Congress can hold hearings and exert pressure on the Department of Justice for its failure to enforce federal law.
- **Private Right of Action:** In some cases (particularly civil rights), a private right of action may exist, allowing individuals to sue even if the government does not prosecute.

**Outcome:** While federal inaction is a risk, Regional authority and private rights of action provide alternative enforcement paths.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Politicization of Prosecution Decisions

**Attack:** The federal government uses its prosecutorial discretion to target individuals in one Region for political reasons, while declining to prosecute similar conduct in a politically aligned Region.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Clear Jurisdictional Rules:** The "most significant interest" test provides objective factors that can be used to challenge selective prosecution.
- **Council Transparency:** The Prosecutorial Council can be a forum where a Regional prosecutor can publicly highlight disparate treatment, creating political costs.
- **Prohibition on Dual Prosecution (Section 23):** Prevents the federal government from "re-trying" a case where a Regional prosecution resulted in an outcome it disliked.

**Outcome:** While prosecutorial discretion is broad, the Act's clear rules and coordinating council create transparency that makes politically motivated selective prosecution harder to conceal.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Defining "complex" or "core element"** | Medium | The Review Commission (Part II) is tasked with clarifying these terms; judicial precedent will refine over time. |
| **Resource disparities between federal and Regional prosecutors** | Medium | Joint task forces can help pool resources; federal grants for specific enforcement areas. |
| **Congressional inaction on Commission recommendations** | High | The requirement for an up-or-down vote creates pressure, but Congress can still vote "no." |
