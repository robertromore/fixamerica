# Interregional Coordination Legislative Review Act

This proposal establishes the statutory framework for the constitutional Senate
review provisions (Article IV, Section 5), providing detailed procedures for
determining when legislation requires Senate coordination review and how that
review process operates.

---

## Constitutional Foundation

Article IV, Section 5 of the Regional Federal Constitution establishes that:

> The Senate shall not have veto power over ordinary legislation. For bills
> affecting interregional coordination (shared natural resources, equalization
> formulas, Regional mandates, boundary procedures), the Senate may delay
> presentation to the President to propose amendments, but cannot permanently
> block legislation.

This Act implements these principles through specific procedures.

---

## Purpose

Establish Senate review procedures that:

- clearly define when Senate coordination review applies,
- provide a fair process for determining applicability,
- establish reasonable timelines for review,
- prevent abuse of review authority to block legislation,
- preserve the core principle of House primacy in ordinary legislation.

---

## Part I: Scope of Senate Review

### Section 1. General Principle

(a) **No Routine Legislative Veto.** The Senate shall not function as a
routine legislative veto. Most legislation passes from House to President
without Senate concurrence.

(b) **Limited Review Categories.** Senate review applies only to legislation
meeting the criteria in Section 2.

(c) **Narrow Construction.** Review categories shall be construed narrowly.
If doubt exists whether a bill meets review criteria, the bill proceeds
without Senate review.

### Section 2. Interregional Coordination Criteria

(a) **Enumerated Categories.** A bill is subject to Senate coordination review
only if it directly:

- (1) **Shared Natural Resources.** Regulates the allocation of shared natural
    resources among Regions, including:
    - water allocation from interstate rivers, lakes, or aquifers,
    - allocation of fishing or hunting rights in shared waters,
    - allocation of mineral or energy extraction rights in federal lands
        affecting multiple Regions.

- (2) **Equalization Formulas.** Establishes or modifies equalization transfer
    formulas, including:
    - the equalization formula in Article X, Section 3,
    - any federal revenue-sharing formula with Regional beneficiaries,
    - any formula for allocating federal grants among Regions.

- (3) **Regional Mandates.** Creates federal mandates requiring Regional
    implementation, including:
    - requirements that Regions establish specific programs,
    - requirements that Regions meet specific standards,
    - requirements that Regions provide specific reports or data.

- (4) **Boundary Procedures.** Modifies Regional boundary revision procedures
    established in Article I, Section 4.

(b) **Exclusions.** The following do not trigger Senate review even if they
incidentally affect Regions:

- (1) legislation operating uniformly across all Regions,
- (2) legislation affecting individuals rather than Regional governments,
- (3) legislation establishing federal programs administered federally,
- (4) appropriations legislation (other than formula changes),
- (5) legislation implementing constitutional provisions directly.

(c) **No Expansion.** The categories in subsection (a) may not be expanded
except by constitutional amendment.

## Part II: Determination Procedures

### Section 11. Speaker Certification

(a) **Timing.** Upon passage of any bill by the House of Representatives, the
Speaker shall certify whether the bill meets the criteria in Section 2.

(b) **Form.** The certification shall:

- (1) identify the specific subsection of Section 2 that applies (if any),
- (2) identify the specific provisions of the bill triggering review,
- (3) state the basis for the determination.

(c) **Default.** If the Speaker does not certify within 48 hours of passage,
the bill is presumed not to meet review criteria and proceeds to the President.

(d) **Good Faith.** The Speaker shall make certifications in good faith based
on the text of the bill and the criteria in Section 2. Partisan considerations
are not relevant.

### Section 12. Senate Challenge

(a) **Right to Challenge.** The Senate may challenge the Speaker's certification
(whether positive or negative) by a vote of three-fifths of Senators present
and voting.

(b) **Timing.** A challenge must be filed within five days of the Speaker's
certification (or the 48-hour default).

(c) **Form.** The challenge shall:

- (1) identify the specific certification being challenged,
- (2) state the grounds for challenge,
- (3) explain why the certification is allegedly incorrect.

(d) **Effect of No Challenge.** If no challenge is filed within five days,
the Speaker's certification is final.

### Section 13. Parliamentarian Determination

(a) **Referral.** If the Senate challenges the Speaker's certification, the
matter is referred to the Parliamentarian of the House.

(b) **Independence.** For purposes of determinations under this Act, the
Parliamentarian acts independently and is not subject to direction by the
Speaker, Majority Leader, or any member of Congress.

(c) **Determination.** Within five days of referral, the Parliamentarian
shall issue a written determination stating:

- (1) whether the bill meets the criteria in Section 2,
- (2) the specific reasoning supporting the determination,
- (3) if the determination differs from the Speaker's certification, the
    basis for disagreement.

(d) **Binding Effect.** The Parliamentarian's determination is binding unless
appealed to the Allocation Review Board.

### Section 14. Allocation Review Board Appeal

(a) **Right to Appeal.** Either the Speaker or the Senate (by majority vote)
may appeal the Parliamentarian's determination to the Allocation Review Board.

(b) **Timing.** An appeal must be filed within three days of the Parliamentarian's
determination.

(c) **Expedited Review.** The Allocation Review Board shall rule on the appeal
within ten days.

(d) **Standard of Review.** The Board shall affirm the Parliamentarian's
determination unless it is clearly erroneous.

(e) **Final Determination.** The Board's ruling is final and not subject to
further appeal.

(f) **Effect Pending Appeal.** Pending the Board's determination, the bill
does not proceed to the President.

## Part III: Senate Review Process

### Section 21. Review Period

(a) **Duration.** For bills certified (or determined) to meet review criteria,
the Senate may delay presentation to the President for up to sixty days.

(b) **Commencement.** The sixty-day period begins on:

- (1) the date of Speaker certification, if not challenged,
- (2) the date of Parliamentarian determination, if challenged but not appealed,
- (3) the date of Board determination, if appealed.

(c) **Automatic Presentation.** If the Senate does not act within sixty days,
the bill is automatically presented to the President.

### Section 22. Senate Actions During Review

(a) **Permitted Actions.** During the review period, the Senate may:

- (1) debate the bill,
- (2) propose amendments,
- (3) vote on proposed amendments,
- (4) request technical briefings from the Congressional Budget Office,
    Government Accountability Office, or relevant agencies.

(b) **Prohibited Actions.** The Senate may not:

- (1) table or indefinitely postpone the bill,
- (2) refuse to consider the bill,
- (3) amend the bill in ways unrelated to interregional coordination concerns,
- (4) hold the bill hostage to unrelated legislative demands.

### Section 23. Amendment Proposals

(a) **Germaneness.** Senate amendments must be germane to the interregional
coordination concerns that triggered review.

(b) **Transmission.** Proposed Senate amendments shall be transmitted to the
House within the sixty-day period.

(c) **House Consideration.** The House may:

- (1) accept Senate amendments (in whole or in part),
- (2) reject Senate amendments,
- (3) propose modifications to Senate amendments.

(d) **Acceptance.** If the House accepts Senate amendments, the amended bill
proceeds to the President.

(e) **Rejection.** If the House rejects Senate amendments (or the sixty-day
period expires without House acceptance), the original House bill proceeds
to the President.

### Section 24. No Filibuster

(a) **Debate Limits.** Debate on bills subject to Senate review shall be
limited to thirty hours, equally divided between proponents and opponents.

(b) **No Extended Debate.** Extended debate (filibuster) is not permitted
for bills subject to this Act.

(c) **Simple Majority.** All procedural votes related to bills under this
Act require only a simple majority.

---

## Part IV: Expedited Review

### Section 31. Emergency Designation

(a) **Availability.** The Speaker may designate a bill as requiring expedited
review if delay would cause significant harm to interregional coordination.

(b) **Effect.** For bills with expedited designation:

- (1) the Senate challenge period is reduced to two days,
- (2) the Parliamentarian determination period is reduced to three days,
- (3) the Board appeal period is reduced to two days,
- (4) the Board determination period is reduced to five days,
- (5) the Senate review period is reduced to thirty days.

(c) **Challenge.** The Senate may challenge expedited designation by a
two-thirds vote. If challenged, the Parliamentarian determines whether
expedited review is appropriate within two days.

### Section 32. Recess Tolling

(a) **Congressional Recess.** The sixty-day review period (or thirty-day
expedited period) is tolled during any Congressional recess exceeding three
days.

(b) **Maximum Extension.** Tolling may not extend the total review period
beyond ninety days (or forty-five days for expedited bills).

---

## Part V: Enforcement

### Section 41. Judicial Review

(a) **Availability.** Determinations under this Act are not subject to
judicial review except:

- (1) claims that a bill was presented to the President without completing
    required procedures,
- (2) claims that the Senate exceeded its authority under this Act.

(b) **Forum.** Such claims shall be filed in the United States District Court
for the District of Columbia within thirty days of the alleged violation.

(c) **Expedited Review.** Courts shall expedite cases under this section.

### Section 42. Remedy

(a) **Procedural Violation.** If a court finds that a bill was presented to
the President without completing required procedures, the court may:

- (1) enjoin the President from signing the bill pending completion of
    procedures, or
- (2) if the bill has been signed, declare the procedures incomplete and
    require the Senate to complete its review (though the bill remains law
    unless subsequently modified).

(b) **Senate Overreach.** If a court finds that the Senate exceeded its
authority under this Act, the court may order the bill presented to the
President immediately.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Category Creep

**Attack:** The Senate claims review authority over broad categories of
legislation by expansively interpreting Section 2 criteria.

**Countermeasure:**

- Narrow construction requirement (Section 1(c))
- Specific enumerated categories with explicit exclusions (Section 2)
- No expansion without constitutional amendment (Section 2(c))
- Speaker certification creates presumption (Section 11)
- Parliamentarian independent determination (Section 13)
- Board review with deference to Parliamentarian (Section 14(d))

**Outcome:** Multiple layers of review constrain expansive interpretation;
each body has incentive to constrain the others.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Procedural Delay

**Attack:** The Senate uses procedural tactics to delay legislation beyond
the sixty-day period.

**Countermeasure:**

- Automatic presentation after sixty days (Section 21(c))
- No tabling or indefinite postponement (Section 22(b))
- Recess tolling capped at ninety days total (Section 32(b))
- Expedited review available for urgent matters (Section 31)

**Outcome:** Senate cannot delay indefinitely; automatic presentation
ensures legislation proceeds.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Filibuster by Amendment

**Attack:** Senators propose hundreds of amendments to consume the sixty-day
period without productive review.

**Countermeasure:**

- Germaneness requirement for amendments (Section 23(a))
- Thirty-hour debate limit (Section 24(a))
- No filibuster (Section 24(b))
- Simple majority for all procedural votes (Section 24(c))

**Outcome:** Dilatory tactics are constrained; productive review is possible
within time limits.

---

### Attack Vector 4: Speaker Manipulation

**Attack:** The Speaker certifies all legislation as meeting review criteria
to give political allies in the Senate influence, or certifies nothing to
exclude political opponents.

**Countermeasure:**

- Good faith requirement (Section 11(d))
- Senate challenge by three-fifths vote (Section 12)
- Independent Parliamentarian review (Section 13)
- Board appeal as final check (Section 14)

**Outcome:** Speaker certification is subject to multiple checks; systematic
manipulation would be overturned.

---

### Attack Vector 5: Board Capture

**Attack:** The Allocation Review Board is captured by one party and
consistently rules to favor that party's legislative agenda.

**Countermeasure:**

- Board composition established separately (Article XIV, Section 7)
- Board applies clear statutory criteria
- Deference standard limits Board discretion (Section 14(d))
- Judicial review available for procedural violations (Section 41)

**Outcome:** Board discretion is limited; systematic bias would be apparent
and subject to political/judicial correction.

---

### Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| Coordinated Speaker-Senate manipulation | Medium | Parliamentarian independence; Board review |
| Expedited review overuse | Low | Senate two-thirds challenge; Parliamentarian determination |
| Amendment flooding (within limits) | Low | Germaneness requirement; House can reject |
| Judicial reluctance to intervene | Low | Political accountability; automatic presentation |
