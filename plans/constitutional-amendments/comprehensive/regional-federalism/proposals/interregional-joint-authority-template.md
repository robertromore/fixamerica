# Inter-Regional Joint Authority: Constitutional Default Template

This proposal defines a constitutional default template for inter-regional joint
authorities to avoid ad hoc, opaque bodies while preserving flexibility for
regional cooperation.

This proposal addresses [Gap 16 — Inter-Regional Cooperation Mechanisms](../04-meta/02-identified-gaps.md)
by providing standardized governance structures for multi-regional institutions
authorized under [Article I, Section 5](../02-design/constitution/01-regional-structure.md).

---

## Constitutional Placement

This template would be incorporated as **Article I, Section 5A** (Inter-Regional
Joint Authority Defaults), immediately following the existing inter-regional
cooperation provisions. Alternatively, it could be implemented as statutory
defaults under the Constitutional Transition Act.

---

## Purpose

Create a default governance framework for multi-region institutions that:
- preserves democratic accountability,
- prevents dominance by a single region,
- standardizes fiscal and audit rules,
- and provides clear dispute resolution and exit procedures.

---

## Draft Constitutional Template (Article I, Section 5A)

### 5A.1 Authorization and Formation

(a) Two or more Regions may form a joint authority by compact to exercise
specified powers delegated by the participating Regions.

(b) A joint authority compact takes effect only upon public ratification in each
participating Region under the Region's chosen ratification method for
inter-regional agreements.

(c) The compact shall be published in full at least 60 days before any
ratification vote.

(d) No joint authority may be formed by executive action alone; legislative or
popular ratification is required in each participating Region.

---

### 5A.2 Scope and Limits

(a) A joint authority may exercise only the powers expressly delegated to it by
all participating Regions.

(b) No joint authority may:

- (1) impose ceilings on regional or state law,
- (2) create internal trade barriers prohibited by Article I, Section 6,
- (3) exercise coercive police powers,
- (4) enter into treaties or binding international agreements,
- (5) issue currency or assume sovereign debt obligations, or
- (6) exercise powers reserved to the federal government.

(c) Powers not expressly delegated to the joint authority remain with the
participating Regions.

(d) A joint authority may not expand its delegated powers without amended
compact ratification by all participating Regions.

---

### 5A.3 Governance Structure (Default)

(a) **Governing Board Composition.**

- (1) Each participating Region appoints an equal number of members to the
  Governing Board.
- (2) No Region may appoint more than three members unless all Regions agree.
- (3) Board members serve staggered terms not to exceed four years.
- (4) Vacancies shall be filled within 60 days by the appointing Region.

(b) **Voting Rules.**

- (1) Ordinary decisions require a simple majority of board members present,
  provided a quorum (majority of total members) exists.
- (2) Decisions affecting per-capita fiscal burdens require dual concurrence:
    - (i) majority of Regions (each Region's delegation votes as a bloc), AND
    - (ii) weighted majority representing at least 55% of the combined population
      of participating Regions.
- (3) Population for weighted voting is determined by the most recent federal
  census; interim adjustments use Census Bureau estimates.

(c) **Transparency.**

- (1) All board meetings shall be open to the public.
- (2) Meeting notices shall be published at least 14 days in advance.
- (3) Minutes and voting records shall be published within 14 days of each
  meeting.
- (4) Executive sessions are permitted only for personnel matters, pending
  litigation, or security-sensitive infrastructure; all votes must occur in
  public session.

---

### 5A.4 Budget and Finance

(a) **Budget Approval.**

- (1) The annual budget requires approval by two-thirds of the Governing Board.
- (2) Each Regional Legislature (or referendum, if the Region so provides) must
  approve its share of the budget within 90 days of board adoption.
- (3) If a Region fails to approve its share, the joint authority may operate on
  a continuing resolution at the prior year's level until approval is obtained.

(b) **No Off-Balance-Sheet Debt.**

- (1) Joint authorities may not incur debt, issue bonds, or guarantee
  obligations without explicit approval by each participating Regional
  Legislature.
- (2) Debt instruments shall specify the proportional liability of each Region.

(c) **Cost Sharing Formula.**

- (1) The cost allocation formula shall be published in the original compact.
- (2) The formula shall be reviewed and reaffirmed every five years.
- (3) Formula changes require ratification by all participating Regions.
- (4) Default allocation, absent agreement, is population-weighted.

(d) **Financial Controls.**

- (1) Joint authorities shall use generally accepted governmental accounting
  standards.
- (2) No expenditure may exceed appropriated amounts without emergency
  authorization under Section 5A.10.

---

### 5A.5 Accountability and Audit

(a) **Independent Audit.**

- (1) Joint authorities shall undergo annual financial audit by an independent
  auditor selected by unanimous consent of participating Regions.
- (2) Auditor selection rotates among qualified firms; no firm may serve more
  than three consecutive years.
- (3) Audit reports shall be published within 120 days of fiscal year end.

(b) **Performance Reporting.**

- (1) Joint authorities shall publish quarterly performance reports including
  operational metrics, expenditures, and progress toward stated objectives.
- (2) Annual reports shall include comparison to performance targets established
  in the compact.

(c) **Sunset Review.**

- (1) Every ten years, the joint authority shall undergo comprehensive review.
- (2) Continuation requires renewed ratification by each participating Region.
- (3) Failure to achieve renewed ratification triggers dissolution under
  Section 5A.8.

---

### 5A.6 Standing and Judicial Review

(a) **Standing to Challenge.**

- (1) Any participating Region may challenge joint authority actions that exceed
  delegated powers.
- (2) Any non-participating Region demonstrably affected by spillover effects
  may challenge actions that violate Article I, Section 6 (transit and
  non-blockade).
- (3) Any person subject to joint authority decisions affecting their rights
  has standing to seek judicial review.
- (4) Organizational standing is permitted where members would have individual
  standing.

(b) **Judicial Review.**

- (1) Challenges to joint authority actions shall be heard by the Regional
  courts of any participating Region or, upon agreement, by a designated
  inter-regional panel.
- (2) Appeals lie to the federal courts on questions of federal law or
  constitutional interpretation.

(c) **Standard of Review.**

- (1) Challenges alleging excess of delegated authority are reviewed de novo.
- (2) Challenges to discretionary decisions within delegated authority are
  reviewed for abuse of discretion.

---

### 5A.7 Withdrawal

(a) **Notice Period.** A Region may withdraw from a joint authority with 18
months written notice to all other participating Regions and to the Governing
Board.

(b) **Obligations During Notice Period.** The withdrawing Region shall:

- (1) continue to meet its fiscal obligations through the end of the current
  fiscal year or the notice period, whichever is longer;
- (2) participate in good-faith negotiations regarding transition arrangements;
- (3) not obstruct joint authority operations during the notice period.

(c) **Asset and Liability Settlement.**

- (1) Upon withdrawal, the withdrawing Region is entitled to its proportional
  share of liquid assets based on the cost allocation formula.
- (2) The withdrawing Region remains liable for its proportional share of
  outstanding debt and contractual obligations incurred before notice of
  withdrawal.
- (3) Physical infrastructure located in the withdrawing Region:
    - (i) may be transferred to the withdrawing Region at appraised value, OR
    - (ii) may remain under joint authority control with negotiated access terms.
- (4) If the parties cannot agree on asset/liability settlement within 12
  months of the notice date, binding arbitration applies under Section 5A.9.

(d) **Personnel.** Employees residing in the withdrawing Region:

- (1) may transfer to the withdrawing Region's employment at equivalent grade
  and salary,
- (2) may remain with the joint authority if positions exist elsewhere, OR
- (3) shall receive severance equal to six months salary plus one month per
  year of service.

(e) **Effect on Remaining Parties.** Withdrawal does not dissolve the joint
authority unless the number of remaining Regions falls below two.

---

### 5A.8 Dissolution

(a) **Voluntary Dissolution.** Dissolution requires:

- (1) approval by two-thirds of the Governing Board, AND
- (2) ratification by a majority of participating Regions representing at least
  60% of the combined population.

(b) **Mandatory Dissolution.** The joint authority dissolves automatically if:

- (1) fewer than two Regions remain after withdrawals,
- (2) the compact expires and is not renewed, OR
- (3) sunset review fails to achieve renewed ratification.

(c) **Dissolution Process.**

- (1) Upon dissolution, the Governing Board shall appoint a dissolution
  administrator.
- (2) The administrator shall:
    - (i) wind down operations within 24 months,
    - (ii) liquidate assets and distribute proceeds proportionally,
    - (iii) settle outstanding obligations,
    - (iv) provide severance to employees, and
    - (v) transfer records to an appropriate archive.
- (3) Participating Regions remain jointly liable for obligations that cannot
  be satisfied from joint authority assets.

---

### 5A.9 Dispute Resolution

(a) **Internal Disputes.** Disputes between participating Regions or between a
Region and the joint authority shall be resolved through:

- (1) **Negotiation:** 30 days of good-faith direct negotiation.
- (2) **Mediation:** If negotiation fails, 45 days of mediation by a mediator
  jointly selected by the parties or, failing agreement, appointed by the
  Allocation Review Board.
- (3) **Binding Arbitration:** If mediation fails, binding arbitration by a
  three-member panel (one selected by each disputing party, third selected by
  those two).
- (4) **Judicial Review:** Arbitration awards may be reviewed only for manifest
  error of law or fraud.

(b) **Timeline.** The entire dispute resolution process shall conclude within
180 days unless extended by mutual consent.

(c) **Costs.** Dispute resolution costs are shared equally unless the
arbitration panel allocates costs based on the parties' conduct.

---

### 5A.10 Emergency Action

(a) **Emergency Authorization.** In genuine emergencies requiring immediate
action between regular budget cycles, the Governing Board may:

- (1) authorize emergency expenditures not exceeding 10% of the annual budget,
- (2) by two-thirds vote of members present, AND
- (3) with immediate written notice to all Regional Legislatures.

(b) **Ratification.** Emergency expenditures must be ratified by a majority of
participating Regional Legislatures within 60 days or the joint authority must
reverse or fund the expenditure from the next regular budget.

(c) **Limitations.** Emergency authority may not be used to:

- (1) expand delegated powers,
- (2) incur long-term debt,
- (3) acquire major assets, OR
- (4) modify the cost allocation formula.

(d) **Reporting.** Emergency actions shall be documented in detail and included
in the next quarterly report.

---

### 5A.11 Conflict of Laws

(a) **Regional Law.** Where joint authority decisions conflict with the law of
a participating Region:

- (1) the compact governs matters within delegated authority,
- (2) regional law governs matters outside delegated authority,
- (3) ambiguities are resolved in favor of regional sovereignty.

(b) **Federal Law.** Joint authority actions may not conflict with federal law
enacted pursuant to enumerated federal powers. Conflicting actions are void.

(c) **DLRS Floors.** Joint authority actions may not establish standards below
DLRS floors established under Article III, Section 4. Joint authorities may
adopt standards exceeding DLRS floors.

(d) **Non-Participating Regions.** Joint authority actions may not bind or
impose obligations on non-participating Regions except as authorized by this
Constitution.

---

### 5A.12 Personnel Protections

(a) **Employment Status.** Joint authority employees are employees of the joint
authority, not of any individual Region.

(b) **Civil Service Protections.** Joint authority employees shall have:

- (1) merit-based hiring and promotion,
- (2) protection from political retaliation,
- (3) due process before termination, and
- (4) portability of pension credits to participating Regions.

(c) **Patronage Prohibition.** Positions may not be allocated based on
political affiliation or as patronage appointments.

(d) **Whistleblower Protection.** Employees who report waste, fraud, abuse, or
violations of law are protected from retaliation under the same standards as
federal whistleblower protections.

---

### 5A.13 Transition for Existing Compacts

(a) **Existing Interstate Compacts.** Interstate compacts in effect at
ratification of this Constitution:

- (1) remain in effect unless inconsistent with this Constitution,
- (2) are encouraged but not required to conform to this template,
- (3) shall comply with transparency and audit requirements of Section 5A.5
  within three years of ratification.

(b) **Conversion Option.** Existing compacts may be converted to joint
authorities under this Section by agreement of all participating states/Regions
and re-ratification under regional procedures.

(c) **No Forced Dissolution.** Nothing in this Section requires dissolution of
existing compacts that do not conform to this template, provided they do not
violate other constitutional provisions.

---

### 5A.14 Anti-Capture Provisions

(a) **Conflict of Interest.** Governing Board members may not:

- (1) have financial interests in entities contracting with the joint authority,
- (2) be employed by or receive compensation from such entities,
- (3) vote on matters in which they have a personal financial interest.

(b) **Lobbying Restrictions.** Governing Board members and senior staff may not
lobby the joint authority for 24 months after leaving their positions.

(c) **Campaign Finance.** Joint authority funds may not be used for political
contributions, issue advocacy, or lobbying.

(d) **Side Payment Prohibition.** Regions may not make payments to other
Regions outside the cost allocation formula to influence joint authority
decisions.

---

## Implementation Notes

- Regions may adopt a tailored governance model, but deviations must be explicit
  and published, and may not weaken transparency, audit, or exit protections.
- The template is a constitutional default, not a mandate. Regions may supersede
  it by unanimous agreement with public ratification.

---

## Rationale

This template reduces the risk of unaccountable multi-region bodies, preserves
regional sovereignty, and provides predictable cooperation mechanics without
requiring a full constitutional amendment for each joint project.

---

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

Following the methodology established in
[Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test](../03-analysis/04-hostile-reinterpretation.md),
this section tests how bad-faith actors might attempt to abuse joint authority
mechanisms.

### Attack Vector 1: Governing Board Capture

**Attack:** A wealthy or populous Region captures the Governing Board by
appointing compliant members and using procedural advantages.

**Countermeasure:**

- Equal representation per Region (Section 5A.3(a))
- Population-weighted dual concurrence for fiscal decisions (Section 5A.3(b)(2))
- Anti-capture provisions including conflict of interest rules (Section 5A.14)
- Side payment prohibition (Section 5A.14(d))

**Outcome:** Capture requires coordination across multiple Regions; single-Region
dominance is structurally blocked.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Withdrawal Obstruction

**Attack:** Remaining Regions obstruct a withdrawing Region by delaying asset
settlement, refusing to negotiate, or imposing punitive terms.

**Countermeasure:**

- Fixed 18-month notice period with clear obligations (Section 5A.7(a)-(b))
- Binding arbitration if settlement fails within 12 months (Section 5A.7(c)(4))
- 180-day dispute resolution timeline (Section 5A.9(b))

**Outcome:** Withdrawal cannot be indefinitely blocked; arbitration provides
final resolution.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Scope Creep

**Attack:** A joint authority gradually expands its powers beyond the original
delegation, citing efficiency or necessity.

**Countermeasure:**

- Powers limited to express delegation (Section 5A.2(a))
- Expansion requires amended compact ratification by ALL Regions (Section 5A.2(d))
- De novo judicial review for excess of authority (Section 5A.6(c)(1))
- 10-year sunset review requiring renewed ratification (Section 5A.5(c))

**Outcome:** Scope creep is judicially reviewable and periodically checked by
mandatory reauthorization.

---

### Attack Vector 4: Emergency Abuse

**Attack:** The Governing Board uses emergency authority to bypass normal budget
processes or expand powers.

**Countermeasure:**

- Emergency expenditures capped at 10% of annual budget (Section 5A.10(a)(1))
- Two-thirds board vote required (Section 5A.10(a)(2))
- 60-day ratification by Regional Legislatures (Section 5A.10(b))
- Explicit prohibition on power expansion via emergency (Section 5A.10(c))

**Outcome:** Emergency authority is narrowly constrained and subject to rapid
legislative review.

---

### Attack Vector 5: Opacity and Corruption

**Attack:** Joint authority operations become opaque, enabling corruption,
patronage, or waste.

**Countermeasure:**

- All meetings public; executive sessions limited (Section 5A.3(c))
- Independent annual audit with auditor rotation (Section 5A.5(a))
- Quarterly performance reporting (Section 5A.5(b))
- Whistleblower protection (Section 5A.12(d))
- Patronage prohibition (Section 5A.12(c))

**Outcome:** Transparency is structurally mandated; corruption must occur in
public view.

---

### Attack Vector 6: Debt Entrapment

**Attack:** A joint authority accumulates debt, creating obligations that bind
Regions even after they wish to withdraw.

**Countermeasure:**

- No off-balance-sheet debt (Section 5A.4(b))
- Debt requires explicit approval by each Regional Legislature (Section 5A.4(b)(1))
- Debt instruments must specify proportional liability (Section 5A.4(b)(2))
- Withdrawing Regions liable only for pre-notice obligations (Section 5A.7(c)(2))

**Outcome:** Debt cannot accumulate without democratic consent; withdrawal
liability is capped.

---

### Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| All participating Regions captured simultaneously | Critical | Beyond template design; general constitutional safeguards apply |
| Audit firms captured | Medium | Auditor rotation (3-year limit); public reports |
| Gradual erosion of transparency norms | Medium | Sunset review forces periodic reauthorization |
| Dispute resolution delays | Low | 180-day timeline; binding arbitration |

---

### Summary

The joint authority template has been designed with explicit countermeasures
against foreseeable abuse patterns. The most dangerous failure mode—simultaneous
capture of all participating Regions—is not specific to joint authorities and is
addressed by the general constitutional framework.
