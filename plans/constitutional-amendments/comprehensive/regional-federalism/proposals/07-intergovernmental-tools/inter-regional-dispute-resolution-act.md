# Inter-Regional Dispute Resolution Act

This proposal establishes a clear, predictable, and enforceable process for resolving disputes arising *within* inter-regional compacts and their associated joint authorities, ensuring that cooperative bodies remain functional and accountable.

---

## Purpose

Establish an Inter-Regional Dispute Resolution Act that:

-   Mandates a default binding arbitration process for internal governance disputes within inter-regional bodies.
-   Establishes clear "choice of law" rules to determine which jurisdiction's laws apply to a compact's internal operations.
-   Creates a streamlined federal process for enforcing arbitration awards and court judgments against joint authorities or member Regions.
-   Designates the Allocation Review Board (ARB) as the final appellate body for disputes raising fundamental constitutional questions.

## Part I: Default Dispute Resolution Process

### Section 1. Applicability

(a) This Act applies to all inter-regional compacts and the joint authorities they create, as authorized by the `Interregional Agency Compact Act`.

### Section 2. Mandatory Dispute Resolution Clause

(a) Every inter-regional compact shall include a clause providing for a binding dispute resolution process for internal governance disputes.

(b) **Default Provision.** If a compact does not include such a clause, or if the clause is found to be unenforceable, the default arbitration process outlined in Section 3 of this Act shall apply.

(c) Any provision in a compact that purports to waive binding dispute resolution for internal governance disputes is void.

### Section 3. Default Arbitration Process

(a) **Initiation.** Any member Region of a compact may initiate arbitration by providing written notice to all other member Regions and the joint authority.

(b) **Panel.** The dispute shall be heard by a three-member arbitration panel.
    - (1) Each party to the dispute (or each side, if there are multiple parties) shall select one arbitrator.
    - (2) The two party-selected arbitrators shall then select a third, neutral arbitrator to serve as chair.
    - (3) If the parties cannot agree on arbitrators, they shall be appointed by the American Arbitration Association (AAA).

(c) **Rules.** The arbitration shall be conducted according to the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules, unless the compact specifies an alternative set of established rules.

(d) **Binding Award.** The panel's decision shall be final and binding on all parties.

## Part II: Choice of Law and Enforcement

### Section 11. Choice of Law

(a) The law governing the internal operations and disputes of a joint authority shall be determined according to the following hierarchy:
    - (1) The law explicitly designated in the text of the inter-regional compact.
    - (2) If not specified, the law of the Region where the joint authority is headquartered.
    - (3) If not specified and there is no physical headquarters, the law of the Region with the largest financial contribution to the joint authority's budget in the most recent fiscal year.

### Section 12. Enforcement of Awards and Judgments

(a) A final arbitration award or a final judgment from a Regional court concerning a dispute under this Act may be registered by any party in any federal district court.

(b) Upon registration, the award or judgment shall be treated and enforced in all respects as a final judgment of the federal court.

---

## Part III: Appellate Jurisdiction

### Section 21. Allocation Review Board (ARB) Appellate Jurisdiction

(a) The Allocation Review Board (ARB) shall have exclusive appellate jurisdiction over arbitration awards or court judgments that involve a fundamental question of:
    - (1) A compact's consistency with the federal Constitution or a Regional constitution.
    - (2) A joint authority's compliance with the `Allocation Framework Act`.

(b) Appeals to the ARB must be filed within 60 days of the final award or judgment.

### Section 22. Standard of Review

(a) The ARB shall review all questions of constitutional or statutory law de novo.

(b) The ARB shall accept the factual findings of the lower tribunal unless they are found to be clearly erroneous.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Refusal to Comply with Arbitration

**Attack:** A powerful member Region of a compact loses an arbitration decision regarding its obligations to a joint transit authority and simply refuses to comply, claiming the arbitration is non-binding.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Mandatory Binding Process (Section 2):** The Act makes binding dispute resolution mandatory and voids any attempt to opt-out.
-   **Federal Enforcement Mechanism (Section 12):** The winning party (the joint authority or another member Region) can register the arbitration award in federal court, converting it into an enforceable federal judgment. Federal marshals could then be used to enforce the judgment.

**Outcome:** A Region cannot ignore a valid arbitration award. The Act provides a clear, non-political pathway to federal enforcement, ensuring that compact obligations are honored.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Deadlock over Applicable Law

**Attack:** The board of an inter-regional water authority is deadlocked. The members cannot agree on which Region's administrative procedure law governs their internal rulemaking process, paralyzing the authority.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Clear Choice of Law Hierarchy (Section 11):** The Act provides a clear, non-discretionary hierarchy to resolve this question. If the compact is silent, the law of the headquarters Region applies. This removes the issue from debate and provides a certain answer.

**Outcome:** The default choice of law rule breaks the deadlock and allows the authority to proceed, preventing paralysis.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Compact Authority Overreach

**Attack:** A joint authority, created by compact, begins exercising powers not granted to it, encroaching on the sovereign authority of its member Regions. The authority's internal arbitration process, dominated by its own appointees, rubber-stamps the action.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **ARB Appellate Jurisdiction (Section 21):** A member Region can appeal the arbitration award to the ARB on the grounds that the joint authority's action violates the `Allocation Framework Act` or the Regional constitution.
-   **De Novo Review (Section 22):** The ARB would review this fundamental question of law "de novo," without deference to the arbitrators' decision, providing a true independent check.

**Outcome:** The ARB serves as the ultimate guardian of the constitutional order, ensuring that joint authorities cannot overstep their mandates, even if their internal dispute mechanisms fail.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Cost of arbitration** | Medium | Compacts can include "loser pays" provisions for legal fees; federal grants could support dispute resolution costs for under-resourced Regions. |
| **Difficulty finding neutral arbitrators** | Low | The AAA and other professional organizations maintain rosters of qualified, neutral arbitrators. |
| **Complex, multi-party disputes** | Medium | The default rules are designed for two-sided disputes; complex cases may require more tailored rules within the compact itself. |
