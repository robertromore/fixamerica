# Pre-Cleared Compact Templates Act

This proposal establishes the statutory framework for the development,
maintenance, and use of pre-cleared inter-regional compact templates, as
authorized by the [Allocation Framework Act](allocation-framework-act.md).

---

## Constitutional Foundation

This Act implements Section 21 of the [Allocation Framework Act](allocation-framework-act.md),
which itself operationalizes the inter-regional cooperation provisions of
Article I, Section 5 of the Regional Federal Constitution. It provides a
standardized, low-friction pathway for Regions to form compacts.

---

## Purpose

Establish a system of pre-cleared compact templates that:

- lowers the transaction costs for inter-regional cooperation,
- standardizes governance, transparency, and accountability for common issues,
- provides legal certainty and predictability for participating Regions,
- enables expedited review and approval of cooperative agreements, and
- promotes voluntary, bottom-up solutions to shared challenges.

---

## Part I: Template Development and Maintenance

### Section 1. ARB Authority

(a) The Allocation Review Board (ARB) is authorized to develop, publish, and
maintain a library of pre-cleared compact templates for common inter-regional
coordination needs.

(b) **Initial Domains.** The ARB shall develop initial templates for the domains
listed in Section 21 of the Allocation Framework Act:
    - (1) transportation infrastructure maintenance and development;
    - (2) energy grid management and resilience;
    - (3) environmental monitoring and enforcement;
    - (4) professional licensing reciprocity;
    - (5) criminal justice information sharing.

(c) **New Domains.** The ARB may develop templates for new domains upon petition
by two or more Regions or by direction of Congress.

### Section 2. Development Process

(a) For each new template, the ARB shall:
    - (1) convene a working group of experts from interested Regions;
    - (2) publish a draft template for public comment for at least 90 days;
    - (3) consult with relevant federal agencies and professional associations;
    - (4) publish the final template with a detailed explanation of its provisions.

(b) **Review Cycle.** All templates shall be reviewed and updated every ten
years to reflect best practices and changing needs.

### Section 3. Legal Effect of Using a Template

(a) **Expedited Review.** Compacts that adopt a pre-cleared template without
substantive modification shall receive expedited review and approval by the ARB
within 30 days of submission.

(b) **Presumption of Validity.** Such compacts are presumed to be consistent
with the Constitution and federal law. This presumption may be rebutted only by
clear and convincing evidence.

(c) **Modification.** Regions may modify templates to suit specific needs, but
substantive modifications remove the compact from the expedited review process.
The ARB shall determine whether a modification is substantive.

## Part II: Master Compact Template

### Section 11. Core Structure

All pre-cleared compact templates shall follow this master structure, with
domain-specific details added in each article.

```text
INTER-REGIONAL COMPACT ON [DOMAIN]

Article I: Purpose and Scope
  - Defines the specific problem the compact addresses.
  - Defines the scope of cooperation.

Article II: Governance
  - Establishes a joint commission with equal representation.
  - Defines voting rules (simple majority for operations, supermajority for standards).

Article III: Powers and Duties
  - Lists specific powers delegated by participating Regions.
  - Lists specific duties of the joint commission.

Article IV: Standards and Procedures
  - [Domain-specific standards, e.g., maintenance schedules, data formats].

Article V: Finance and Cost Sharing
  - Defines the cost allocation formula.
  - Establishes budget approval process.

Article VI: Data Sharing and Transparency
  - Specifies data to be shared and privacy protections.
  - Mandates public meetings and reporting.

Article VII: Dispute Resolution
  - Establishes a tiered process: negotiation, mediation, binding arbitration.

Article VIII: Membership, Withdrawal, and Dissolution
  - Defines process for joining, leaving, and winding down the compact.

Article IX: General Provisions
  - Severability, effective date, relationship to other laws.
```

## Part III: Model Compact Examples

### Section 21. Model Template: Inter-Regional Transportation Corridor Compact

(a) **Purpose:** To coordinate maintenance, investment, and operational rules
for a specific shared transportation corridor (e.g., a highway or rail line).

(b) **Domain-Specific Provisions (Article IV):**
    - (1) Establishes a 5-year capital improvement plan for the corridor.
    - (2) Sets uniform standards for signage, weight limits, and emergency response.
    - (3) Creates a joint fund for maintenance, with contributions based on
      mileage within each Region.

(c) **Governance:** The joint commission makes recommendations; implementation
is carried out by each Region's transportation agency.

### Section 22. Model Template: Inter-Regional Energy Grid Resilience Compact

(a) **Purpose:** To coordinate planning, investment, and emergency response to
ensure the resilience of the electric grid across participating Regions.

(b) **Domain-Specific Provisions (Article IV):**
    - (1) Requires adoption of compatible cybersecurity standards for grid operators.
    - (2) Establishes a mutual aid protocol for restoring power after a major outage.
    - (3) Creates a joint process for siting and approving new inter-regional
      transmission lines.

(c) **Governance:** The joint commission coordinates with federal energy
regulators and regional transmission organizations.

### Section 23. Model Template: Inter-Regional Professional Licensing Compact

(a) **Purpose:** To establish full license portability for a specific profession
(e.g., nursing, engineering) among participating Regions.

(b) **Domain-Specific Provisions (Article IV):**
    - (1) Creates a shared database of licensed professionals in good standing.
    - (2) Establishes that a license issued by any participating Region is valid
      for practice in all other participating Regions.
    - (3) Creates a coordinated process for investigating complaints and taking
      disciplinary action, with recognition of actions across all member Regions.

(c) **Governance:** The joint commission is composed of representatives from
each Region's licensing board for that profession.

---

## Part IV: Adoption and Implementation

### Section 31. Regional Adoption

(a) To join a compact based on a pre-cleared template, a Region must:
    - (1) Pass legislation adopting the compact text.
    - (2) Appoint its representative(s) to the joint commission.
    - (3) Notify the ARB and all other participating Regions.

(b) A compact becomes active once two or more Regions have completed the
adoption process.

### Section 32. Federal Role

(a) The ARB shall maintain a public registry of all active inter-regional
compacts and their membership.

(b) The federal government may provide technical assistance and incentive
funding to support the formation and operation of compacts based on pre-cleared
templates.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Template Rigidity

**Attack:** A Region argues that a template is too rigid and cannot be used for
a specific local need, using this as a pretext to avoid cooperation.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Modification is permitted (Section 3(c)):** Regions can modify templates.
- **Loss of Expedited Review:** The only "penalty" for modification is the
    loss of expedited review, which is a reasonable trade-off for customization.
- **ARB can create new templates (Section 1(c)):** If a need is common, a new
    template can be developed.

**Outcome:** The system allows for flexibility; templates are a tool, not a
straitjacket.

---

### Attack Vector 2: "Boilerplate" Capture

**Attack:** A powerful Region pressures smaller Regions to adopt a template
that, while pre-cleared, contains default provisions that favor the larger Region
(e.g., a population-weighted funding formula).

**Countermeasure:**

- **Voluntary Adoption:** No Region can be forced to join a compact.
- **Template Transparency:** All templates and their rationales are public.
- **Modification is Possible:** A smaller Region can propose modifications to
    the funding formula or other terms as a condition of joining.
- **Equal Representation:** The default governance model gives each Region an
    equal vote on the commission, regardless of size.

**Outcome:** The opt-in nature and equal representation provide smaller Regions
with significant leverage to resist unfavorable terms.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Scope Creep

**Attack:** A joint commission established under a narrow template gradually
expands its authority into policy areas not originally intended.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Limited Delegation:** The master template (Section 11) requires the compact
    to define the specific scope and delegated powers.
- **Judicial Review:** Actions exceeding delegated authority can be challenged
    in court.
- **Sunset Review:** The [Inter-Regional Joint Authority Template](interregional-joint-authority-template.md)
    (which these templates can incorporate) requires periodic re-ratification,
    providing a check on scope creep.

**Outcome:** Scope creep is constrained by the compact's text and subject to
both judicial and political review.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| **Lack of Adoption** | High | If Regions choose not to cooperate, templates are useless. Mitigation relies on federal incentives and the inherent benefits of cooperation. |
| **Dispute Resolution Failure** | Medium | Binding arbitration is a strong backstop, but a Region could refuse to comply, escalating the dispute to federal courts. |
| **Free Rider Problem** | Medium | Non-participating Regions may benefit from infrastructure or environmental improvements without contributing. Mitigation requires designing compacts with excludable benefits where possible. |
