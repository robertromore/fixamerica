# Digital and AI Governance Framework

This proposal establishes baseline protections for algorithmic accountability
in government, digital identity coordination, and emerging technology governance
while preserving Regional flexibility to experiment with different approaches.

This proposal addresses [Gap 26 — Digital/AI Governance Framework](../04-meta/02-identified-gaps.md)
by creating minimum standards for AI use in government and coordination
mechanisms for digital systems.

---

## Constitutional Placement

This framework would be implemented through:

- **DLRS floor extension** - Adding "algorithmic accountability in government
  decisions" to the enumerated floor domains (requires constitutional amendment)
- **Article XVI extension** - Adding provisions on AI governance to the existing
  cyber defense article
- **Implementing legislation** - Federal AI Accountability Act

The framework is modular; different components can be adopted independently.

---

## Purpose

Create a framework that:

- establishes minimum transparency and accountability for AI used in government,
- protects individuals from algorithmic harm without adequate recourse,
- coordinates digital identity systems across Regions,
- enables Regional experimentation while preventing a race to the bottom, and
- prepares governance structures for emerging AI capabilities.

---

## Part I: Constitutional Floor Provisions

### Option A: DLRS Domain Extension (Constitutional Amendment Required)

Amend Article III, Section 4.8 to add:

> (f) algorithmic accountability floors for government decision-making.

This would enable DLRS to set floors for AI governance without requiring
full constitutional amendment for each standard.

### Option B: Article XVI Extension

Add to Article XVI (Cyber and Digital Defense):

**Section 8. Algorithmic Accountability in Government**

(a) **Transparency Requirement.** No federal, Regional, or State government may
use an algorithmic system to make or substantially influence decisions affecting
individual rights, benefits, or obligations unless:

- (1) the use of such system is publicly disclosed;
- (2) the general logic, factors considered, and data inputs are documented;
- (3) affected individuals are notified when such systems influence their cases.

(b) **Human Review.** Decisions affecting individual liberty, benefits eligibility,
or significant legal rights shall be subject to meaningful human review upon
request. Automated systems may inform but not determine such decisions without
human review.

(c) **Right to Explanation.** Any person subject to an algorithmic government
decision has the right to:

- (1) know that an algorithmic system was used;
- (2) receive a plain-language explanation of the factors that influenced the
    decision;
- (3) contest the decision through existing administrative and judicial processes.

(d) **Non-Discrimination.** Algorithmic systems used in government shall be:

- (1) audited for disparate impact on protected classes;
- (2) documented with bias assessments;
- (3) subject to correction if disparate impact is identified.

(e) **Prohibition on Social Scoring.** No government may establish a
comprehensive social credit or social scoring system that aggregates individual
behavior across domains to determine access to government services, benefits,
or rights.

(f) **Floor Status.** These requirements are floors; Regions and States may
impose stricter requirements.

## Part II: Federal AI Accountability Act

### Title I: Definitions

**Section 101. Definitions.**

For purposes of this Act:

    substantially informs government decisions affecting individuals.
- (c) "High-risk application" means use of automated decision systems in:
    - (1) criminal justice (sentencing, bail, parole, risk assessment);
    - (2) benefits eligibility (healthcare, housing, income support);
    - (3) child welfare (removal, placement decisions);
    - (4) employment (hiring, termination for government positions);
    - (5) education (admissions, discipline, resource allocation).

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Algorithmic Opacity

**Attack:** Agencies claim algorithmic systems are proprietary trade secrets and
refuse transparency.

**Countermeasure:**

- Proprietary systems ineligible for government contracts (Section 204(b))
- Government must document logic and factors (Constitutional Section 8(a))
- Impact assessments required before deployment (Section 202)

**Outcome:** Transparency is prerequisite for government use; opacity disqualifies
systems.

---

### Attack Vector 2: "Advisory Only" Circumvention

**Attack:** Agencies claim algorithmic systems are merely "advisory" and human
decision-makers routinely rubber-stamp recommendations.

**Countermeasure:**

- "Substantially influences" standard covers advisory systems (Section 101(b))
- Human review must be "meaningful," not pro forma (Constitutional Section 8(b))
- Audit requirements apply regardless of formal decision-maker (Section 203)

**Outcome:** Functional influence triggers requirements regardless of formal
characterization.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Social Scoring Through Aggregation

**Attack:** Government creates de facto social scoring by aggregating data across
agencies without formally calling it "social credit."

**Countermeasure:**

- Prohibition on comprehensive social scoring systems (Constitutional Section 8(e))
- Purpose limitation for digital identity data (Section 503(a)(2))
- Data sharing restrictions (Section 503(b))

**Outcome:** Aggregation that functions as social scoring is prohibited regardless
of label.

---

### Attack Vector 4: Regional Race to Bottom

**Attack:** Regions compete by reducing AI accountability to attract tech
companies.

**Countermeasure:**

- Constitutional floors cannot be undercut (Constitutional Section 8(f))
- Federal procurement standards apply to federal funding recipients (Section 201(c))
- Regional experimentation is upward only (Section 701)

**Outcome:** Floors prevent race to bottom; competition is for higher standards.

---

### Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| Rapid AI capability advancement outpaces governance | High | Framework adaptable through regulation |
| Audit capacity insufficient for all systems | Medium | Risk-based prioritization; high-risk focus |
| International AI development unconstrained | Critical | Beyond domestic governance; treaty needed |
| Explanation requirements technically infeasible | Medium | "Best available" standard; evolves with technology |
