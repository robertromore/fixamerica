## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Federal Overreach

A hostile executive could use the Act to seize control of disaster response, sidelining Regional authorities.

**Countermeasures:**
    -Guaranteed Regional representation on the Coordination Council.
    -Emphasis on a Regional-led, Federal-supported approach in the Act's language.

### Attack Vector 2: Inadequate Funding

A Congress hostile to disaster relief could underfund the Disaster Relief Fund, rendering the Act ineffective.

**Countermeasures:**
    -Mandatory appropriations language to ensure a minimum fund balance.
    -Automatic supplemental appropriations requirement if the fund is depleted.

### Attack Vector 3: Discriminatory Assistance

A politically-motivated administration could direct federal assistance to favored Regions, neglecting others.

**Countermeasures:**
    -Objective criteria for federal disaster declarations.
    -Requirement for equitable access to federal resources for all Regions.
