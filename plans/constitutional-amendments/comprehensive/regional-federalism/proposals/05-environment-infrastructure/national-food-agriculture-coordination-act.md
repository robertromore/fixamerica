# National Food and Agriculture Coordination Act

This proposal establishes a framework to define the federal and Regional roles in agricultural policy, food safety, and the national food supply chain, ensuring a stable and safe food system across the Regional Federalism model.

---

## Purpose

Establish a framework for National Food and Agriculture Coordination that:

- Defines clear federal and Regional roles in agricultural policy and food safety.
- Ensures a stable and secure national food supply chain.
- Coordinates food safety standards and outbreak response across Regions.
- Addresses inter-regional impacts of agricultural practices, particularly water use.
- Balances federal oversight with Regional flexibility in agricultural development.

## Part I: Federal-Regional Roles in Agricultural Policy

### Section 1. Farm Subsidy Framework

(a) **Federal Subsidies.** The federal government shall retain primary responsibility for national agricultural subsidies designed to:
    - (1) Provide a national safety net for farmers (e.g., crop insurance, disaster assistance).
    - (2) Support national conservation programs (e.g., Conservation Reserve Program).
    - (3) Fund agricultural research and extension services of national benefit.

(b) **Regional Subsidies.** Regions may provide additional subsidies or support programs for agricultural producers within their boundaries, provided such programs do not:
    - (1) Undermine federal subsidy programs.
    - (2) Discriminate against out-of-region agricultural products or producers.
    - (3) Create an unfair competitive advantage in inter-regional commerce (subject to the `Inter-Regional Commerce and Trade Act`).

### Section 2. Food Safety Coordination

(a) **Federal Oversight.** Federal agencies (e.g., FDA, USDA) shall retain primary authority for:
    - (1) Establishing national food safety standards for products entering inter-regional commerce.
    - (2) Inspecting facilities producing food for inter-regional distribution.
    - (3) Coordinating national foodborne illness outbreak investigations.

(b) **Regional Authority.** Regions shall have authority for:
    - (1) Enforcing federal food safety standards within their borders.
    - (2) Establishing and enforcing stricter food safety standards for products produced and consumed solely within their Region.
    - (3) Inspecting facilities producing food for intra-regional distribution.
    - (4) Responding to local foodborne illness outbreaks.

(c) **Coordination.** Federal and Regional food safety authorities shall establish protocols for information sharing, joint investigations, and coordinated recalls for products distributed inter-regionally.

### Section 3. Strategic Food Reserve

(a) **National Reserve.** The federal government shall maintain a Strategic National Food Reserve to ensure food security during national emergencies, major disasters, or significant disruptions to the food supply chain.

(b) **Supply Chain Plan.** The federal government shall develop and maintain a National Food Supply Chain Resilience Plan, in consultation with Regions, to identify vulnerabilities and coordinate responses to disruptions.

(c) **Regional Distribution.** Regions shall develop plans for the distribution of food from the Strategic National Food Reserve to their populations during emergencies.

### Section 4. Inter-Regional Water Use in Agriculture

(a) **Equitable Apportionment.** Agricultural water use from shared inter-regional sources shall be subject to the principles of equitable apportionment as defined in the `Interstate Water Resources Coordination Act`.

(b) **"Virtual Water" Trade.** The National Resilience and Infrastructure Council (NRIC) shall, in consultation with the Water Resources Coordination Board, study and report on the implications of "virtual water" trade (water embedded in agricultural products) for inter-regional water security and make recommendations for sustainable practices.

### Section 5. Land Use and Conservation

(a) **Federal Conservation Programs.** Federal agricultural conservation programs (e.g., Conservation Reserve Program, Environmental Quality Incentives Program) shall continue to operate nationwide.

(b) **Regional Coordination.** Federal agencies administering conservation programs shall coordinate with Regional land use planning authorities to maximize environmental benefits and avoid conflicts.

---

## Part II: Food Supply Chain Resilience and Traceability

### Section 11. Food Traceability System

(a) **National Standard.** The FDA and USDA shall establish a national, interoperable food traceability system for certain high-risk foods, from farm to consumer.

(b) **Regional Participation.** Regions shall ensure that food producers and distributors within their jurisdiction comply with federal traceability standards.

(c) **Outbreak Response.** The traceability system shall facilitate rapid identification of contamination sources during foodborne illness outbreaks.

### Section 12. Supply Chain Vulnerability Assessment

(a) The Department of Agriculture, in coordination with the NRIC and Regional agricultural authorities, shall conduct biennial assessments of national and Regional food supply chain vulnerabilities.

(b) Assessments shall identify critical infrastructure, single points of failure, and potential impacts of climate change or other disasters.

### Section 13. Incentives for Local and Regional Food Systems

(a) The federal government shall provide grants and technical assistance to Regions to support the development of robust local and regional food systems, enhancing resilience and reducing reliance on long supply chains.

---

## Part III: Agricultural Research and Innovation

### Section 21. Federal Agricultural Research

(a) Federal agricultural research institutions (e.g., USDA Agricultural Research Service) shall continue to conduct research on national priorities, including sustainable agriculture, climate-resilient crops, and pest management.

(b) Federal research shall be made publicly available and accessible to all Regions.

### Section 22. Regional Research Collaboration

(a) Regions are encouraged to form inter-regional compacts for collaborative agricultural research and extension services, leveraging shared expertise and resources.

(b) Federal grants may prioritize inter-regional research projects addressing shared challenges (e.g., drought-resistant crops for arid Regions).

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Regional Food Protectionism

**Attack:** A Region enacts regulations (e.g., unique labeling requirements, specific production methods) designed to favor in-region food producers and disadvantage out-of-region competitors.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Inter-Regional Commerce and Trade Act:** Prohibits discriminatory regulations and targeted subsidies.
- **Federal Food Safety Standards:** Establishes national standards for inter-regional commerce, preempting conflicting Regional rules.
- **Allocation Review Board (ARB):** Has jurisdiction over disputes arising from discriminatory practices.

**Outcome:** Regional protectionism is explicitly prohibited and subject to federal oversight and enforcement, ensuring a unified national food market.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Food Safety Negligence

**Attack:** A Region neglects its food safety enforcement duties, leading to outbreaks that spread to other Regions, or allows unsafe practices to gain a competitive advantage.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Federal Food Safety Oversight (Section 2(a)):** Federal agencies retain primary authority for national standards and inter-regional products.
- **Coordination Protocols (Section 2(c)):** Mandates information sharing and joint investigations.
- **Traceability System (Section 11):** Enables rapid identification of contamination sources, holding negligent parties accountable.
- **Transboundary Environmental Harm Prevention Act:** Applies to pollution from agricultural practices affecting other Regions.

**Outcome:** Federal oversight and inter-regional coordination prevent a race to the bottom on food safety, with mechanisms to address negligence.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Water-Intensive Agriculture in Arid Regions

**Attack:** An arid Region continues to support water-intensive agriculture for export, exacerbating water scarcity for neighboring Regions or for its own long-term sustainability.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Interstate Water Resources Coordination Act:** Governs equitable apportionment of shared water resources.
- **"Virtual Water" Reporting (Section 4(b)):** The NRIC and Water Resources Coordination Board will highlight unsustainable practices.
- **Federal Conservation Programs (Section 5(a)):** Can incentivize less water-intensive crops or practices.

**Outcome:** While Regions have autonomy, water use is subject to inter-regional equitable apportionment, and unsustainable practices will be publicly identified and potentially subject to federal incentives/disincentives.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Political will for federal subsidy reform** | High | Requires sustained Congressional action; this Act clarifies roles but doesn't mandate specific subsidy levels. |
| **Regional resistance to federal food safety standards** | Medium | Federal enforcement authority; potential for withholding federal funds related to food safety. |
| **Impact of climate change on agricultural productivity** | High | This Act provides coordination mechanisms, but fundamental solutions require broader climate action. |
| **Balancing local food system development with national market efficiency** | Medium | Federal incentives for local systems; continued oversight by ARB for discriminatory practices. |
