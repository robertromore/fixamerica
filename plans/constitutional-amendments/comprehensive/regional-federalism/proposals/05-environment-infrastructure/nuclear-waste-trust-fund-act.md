# Nuclear Waste Trust Fund and Accountability Act

This proposal establishes a constitutionally protected, independently managed trust fund for nuclear waste management, ensuring long-term federal responsibility and providing recourse for host communities.

---

## Purpose

Establish a Nuclear Waste Trust Fund and Accountability Framework that:

- Ensures long-term federal responsibility for the safe storage and disposal of nuclear waste.
- Provides a stable, independent funding mechanism insulated from political interference.
- Guarantees resources for host communities and environmental remediation.
- Mitigates the risk of federal abandonment of nuclear waste responsibilities.

## Part I: Nuclear Waste Trust Fund

### Section 1. Establishment of Trust Fund

(a) There is established in the Treasury of the United States a permanent, independently managed "Nuclear Waste Trust Fund" (the "Fund").

(b) The Fund shall be a constitutionally protected, non-lapsable, and off-budget account, dedicated exclusively to the purposes outlined in this Act.

### Section 2. Funding Mechanism

(a) The Fund shall be financed by:
    - (1) A dedicated federal tax on nuclear energy generation, calculated per kilowatt-hour, sufficient to cover the projected long-term costs of waste management.
    - (2) A federal tax on the production of new nuclear materials requiring long-term disposal.
    - (3) Any civil penalties collected under the Nuclear Hazardous Materials Governance Act or related federal statutes.
    - (4) Interest earned on Fund investments.

(b) The Secretary of the Treasury shall invest Fund assets in interest-bearing federal securities.

### Section 3. Independent Oversight Board

(a) There is established an "Independent Nuclear Waste Fund Board" (the "Board") to manage and oversee the Fund.

(b) The Board shall consist of seven (7) members with staggered, non-renewable 10-year terms, appointed by diverse authorities (e.g., President, Congressional leadership, Chief Justice, National Academy of Sciences), with strict non-partisan and expertise-based qualifications.

(c) The Board shall:
    - (1) Develop and update long-term financial projections for nuclear waste management costs.
    - (2) Oversee the investment of Fund assets.
    - (3) Authorize disbursements from the Fund for approved activities.
    - (4) Report annually to Congress and the public on the Fund's solvency and activities.

## Part II: Host Community Protections and Recourse

### Section 11. Host Community First Principle

(a) Any federal action or inaction regarding nuclear waste management shall prioritize the safety, economic well-being, and consent of host communities.

(b) "Host community" includes any local government jurisdiction where nuclear waste is stored, processed, or disposed of, or through which it is routinely transported.

### Section 12. Legal Recourse for Abandonment

(a) If the federal government abandons its responsibility for nuclear waste management (e.g., by failing to maintain facilities, ceasing monitoring, or diverting funds from the Fund), any affected host community shall have standing to bring an action in federal court.

(b) Federal courts shall have mandatory, expedited jurisdiction over such claims.

(c) Remedies for abandonment may include:
    - (1) Injunctive relief to compel federal action.
    - (2) Automatic, substantial federal payments to affected host communities from the Fund, to cover costs of local management and remediation.
    - (3) Damages for economic harm and diminished property values.

### Section 13. Guaranteed Benefits

(a) Host communities shall receive guaranteed impact payments and economic development support from the Fund, as negotiated during the siting process and adjusted for inflation.

(b) These benefits shall be legally binding and continue for the duration of the facility's operation and post-closure monitoring period.

---

## Part III: Enforcement and Oversight

### Section 21. Federal Accountability

(a) The federal government's responsibility for nuclear waste management, including funding and oversight, is legally non-delegable to Regions or private entities without explicit Congressional authorization and host community consent.

(b) Any attempt to unilaterally transfer or abandon federal responsibility shall be void ab initio.

### Section 22. Transparency

(a) All financial records of the Fund and operational reports on nuclear waste facilities shall be publicly accessible.

(b) The Independent Nuclear Waste Fund Board shall conduct regular public hearings in host communities.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Fund Raiding or Diversion

**Attack:** A future Congress or administration attempts to raid the Fund for other purposes or divert its revenue streams.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Constitutional Protection:** Section 1(b) establishes the Fund as constitutionally protected, making it extremely difficult to raid without a constitutional amendment.
- **Independent Board:** The Independent Nuclear Waste Fund Board (Section 3) is insulated from direct political control, overseeing disbursements.
- **Dedicated Revenue:** The specified funding mechanisms (Section 2) ensure a continuous, non-lapsable revenue stream.
- **Legal Recourse:** Host communities have standing to sue if funds are diverted, triggering automatic payments.

**Outcome:** The multi-layered protection (constitutional, independent oversight, dedicated revenue, legal recourse) makes raiding or diverting the Fund exceptionally difficult.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Board Capture or Politicization

**Attack:** Political actors attempt to capture the Independent Nuclear Waste Fund Board to influence its decisions or favor certain interests.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Diverse Appointments:** Section 3(b) specifies staggered, non-renewable 10-year terms and appointments by diverse authorities, preventing single-actor capture.
- **Expertise-Based Qualifications:** Strict qualifications ensure members are chosen for expertise, not political affiliation.
- **Transparency:** Board meetings and financial reports are public, allowing scrutiny.
- **Judicial Review:** Board decisions are subject to judicial review for adherence to its mandate.

**Outcome:** The independent, diverse, and expert composition of the Board, combined with transparency and judicial oversight, makes partisan capture difficult.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Federal Abandonment of Responsibility

**Attack:** The federal government attempts to unilaterally abandon its long-term responsibility for nuclear waste management, leaving the burden to host communities.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Legal Recourse for Host Communities:** Section 12(a) grants host communities direct standing to sue for abandonment, triggering automatic payments and injunctive relief.
- **Non-Delegable Responsibility:** Section 21(a) explicitly states federal responsibility is non-delegable without specific authorization and consent.
- **Guaranteed Benefits:** Section 13 ensures legally binding benefits, creating a strong incentive for federal adherence.

**Outcome:** The Act provides strong legal and financial mechanisms for host communities to compel federal adherence to its responsibilities, making unilateral abandonment legally and financially costly.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Host community consent process manipulation** | Medium | Strengthen independent oversight of consent processes; ensure robust public participation and transparency. |
| **Long-term cost projection inaccuracies** | Medium | Regular, independent actuarial reviews of the Fund's solvency; flexible tax mechanisms to adjust to new projections. |
| **Political pressure to site waste in vulnerable communities** | High | Explicit constitutional or statutory prohibition on siting in communities without robust consent mechanisms and demonstrated capacity. |
