# Inter-Regional Communications and Broadband Act

This proposal defines federal and Regional roles in regulating communications infrastructure, ensuring equitable access to broadband, and managing national spectrum resources.

---

## Purpose

Establish a framework for Inter-Regional Communications and Broadband that:

-   Clarifies federal and Regional roles in regulating communications infrastructure.
-   Establishes a national strategy and funding mechanisms to achieve universal broadband access.
-   Sets a federal floor for net neutrality to ensure a level playing field for internet traffic.
-   Streamlines the deployment of next-generation communications infrastructure while preserving Regional authority over local siting.

---

## Part I: Federal Authority and National Strategy

### Section 1. Federal Spectrum Authority

(a) The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) shall retain exclusive authority to manage and auction the nation's electromagnetic spectrum for commercial and public use.

(b) The FCC shall coordinate with Regional authorities on spectrum allocation decisions that may impact Regional public safety or infrastructure networks.

### Section 2. National Broadband Strategy

(a) The federal government shall establish a National Broadband Strategy with the goal of ensuring universal access to affordable, high-speed broadband for all citizens.

(b) The Strategy shall include:
    - (1) Minimum speed and quality standards for broadband service.
    - (2) Federal funding mechanisms, administered through the National Infrastructure Bank, to support broadband deployment in unserved and underserved areas.
    - (3) Programs to promote digital equity and adoption.

### Section 3. Federal Net Neutrality Floor

(a) All internet service providers (ISPs) operating within the United States shall adhere to a federal floor for net neutrality.

(b) This floor shall prohibit:
    - (1) **Blocking:** The blocking of lawful content, applications, services, or non-harmful devices.
    - (2) **Throttling:** The impairing or degrading of lawful internet traffic on the basis of content, applications, services, or use of non-harmful devices.
    - (3) **Paid Prioritization:** The favoring of some internet traffic over other traffic in exchange for consideration, or to benefit an affiliate.

(c) **Regional Authority.** Regions may enact and enforce stricter net neutrality rules that are not in conflict with this federal floor.

## Part II: Regional Authority and Implementation

### Section 11. Regional Siting and Franchising Authority

(a) Regions shall have primary authority over:
    - (1) The siting of communications infrastructure, including cell towers, small cells, and fiber optic lines, within their boundaries.
    - (2) The franchising of cable and internet service providers operating within their jurisdiction.

(b) **Prevention of Unreasonable Barriers.** Regional siting and franchising decisions shall not create unreasonable barriers to market entry or discriminate against out-of-region providers, subject to review by the Allocation Review Board (ARB).

### Section 12. Regional Broadband Deployment Plans

(a) Each Region shall develop a comprehensive "Regional Broadband Deployment Plan" to achieve the goals of the National Broadband Strategy.

(b) These plans shall identify unserved and underserved areas, outline strategies for deployment, and coordinate with local governments and private providers.

(c) Regional plans that align with the National Broadband Strategy shall be eligible for priority funding from the National Infrastructure Bank.

---

## Part III: Inter-Regional Coordination and Infrastructure

### Section 21. Inter-Regional Communications Council

(a) There is established an "Inter-Regional Communications Council" (the "Council").

(b) **Composition.** The Council shall be composed of:
    - (1) The Chair of the FCC (as Chair).
    - (2) One representative from each Regional communications or utility authority.
    - (3) The Administrator of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).

(c) **Functions.** The Council shall:
    - (1) Facilitate coordination on inter-regional communications policy.
    - (2) Develop best practices for broadband deployment and digital equity.
    - (3) Mediate disputes between Regions regarding infrastructure siting or service provision near borders.

### Section 22. Inter-Regional Fiber Backbones

(a) The National Infrastructure Planning Council shall identify and prioritize the development of inter-regional fiber optic backbones and other shared communications infrastructure.

(b) Projects identified as national priorities shall be eligible for financing from the National Infrastructure Bank.

(c) Regions are encouraged to form compacts for the joint ownership and operation of shared communications infrastructure.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Regional Protectionism

**Attack:** A Region uses its siting and franchising authority to block out-of-region providers or impose discriminatory requirements, under the guise of local control.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Prevention of Unreasonable Barriers (Section 11(b)):** The Act explicitly prohibits unreasonable barriers to entry and discrimination.
-   **ARB Review:** The Allocation Review Board (ARB) has jurisdiction to review and adjudicate claims of discriminatory practices.
-   **Inter-Regional Commerce and Trade Act:** Provides a broader framework for preventing economic protectionism.

**Outcome:** While Regions have local control, they cannot use it to create protectionist barriers; such actions are subject to review and reversal by the ARB.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Federal Overreach

**Attack:** The FCC attempts to use its authority to preempt all Regional siting and franchising rules, centralizing control over broadband deployment.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Explicit Regional Authority (Section 11(a)):** The Act explicitly reserves primary authority over siting and franchising to the Regions.
-   **Federal Floors, Not Ceilings (Section 3(c)):** The Act establishes federal floors, preserving Regional authority to enact stricter rules.
-   **Judicial Review:** Federal preemption actions would be subject to judicial review for consistency with this Act.

**Outcome:** The Act creates a clear division of labor, limiting federal authority to spectrum management and national standards, while preserving Regional control over local implementation.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Net Neutrality Loopholes

**Attack:** ISPs develop new business practices (e.g., "zero-rating" certain applications, creating "fast lanes" for specific types of content) that technically comply with the letter of the net neutrality floor but violate its spirit.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **FCC Rulemaking Authority:** The FCC retains authority to issue regulations to clarify and enforce the net neutrality floor, closing loopholes as they emerge.
-   **Regional Authority to Exceed Floors (Section 3(c)):** Regions can enact stricter net neutrality rules to address new practices not covered by the federal floor.
-   **Council for Coordination (Section 21):** The Inter-Regional Communications Council can identify and develop best practices for addressing new ISP practices.

**Outcome:** The combination of federal rulemaking authority and Regional flexibility allows the regulatory framework to adapt to new technologies and business practices, preventing the erosion of net neutrality principles.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Funding shortfalls for universal broadband** | High | The National Infrastructure Bank provides a dedicated funding source, but large-scale deployment will require sustained political will and appropriations. |
| **Rapidly evolving technology** | High | The Act focuses on principles (e.g., net neutrality) rather than specific technologies; FCC and Regional rulemaking can adapt to new developments. |
| **Digital divide (adoption and literacy)** | Medium | The National Broadband Strategy includes programs to promote digital equity and adoption, but this remains a significant social challenge. |
| **Defining "unreasonable barriers" to entry** | Medium | ARB and judicial precedent will be required to develop a clear body of case law. |
