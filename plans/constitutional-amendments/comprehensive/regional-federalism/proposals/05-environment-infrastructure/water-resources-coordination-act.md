# Interstate Water Resources Coordination Act

This proposal establishes the statutory framework for the constitutional water
rights provisions (Article I, Section 7), providing detailed procedures for
the Water Resources Coordination Board, equitable apportionment, and dispute
resolution.

---

## Constitutional Foundation

Article I, Section 7 of the Regional Federal Constitution establishes that:

> Interstate rivers, lakes, aquifers, and watersheds that cross or border
> Regional boundaries are shared resources. Water allocation among Regions
> shall be governed by principles of equitable apportionment. Disputes shall
> be resolved through a Water Resources Coordination Board and National
> Water Court.

This Act implements these principles through specific procedures.

---

## Purpose

Establish water resources coordination that:

- protects shared water resources from unilateral harm,
- provides clear criteria for equitable water apportionment,
- creates an expert board to facilitate water-sharing agreements,
- establishes dispute resolution procedures with defined timelines,
- preserves existing interstate water compacts and tribal water rights.

## Part I: Prohibited Actions

### Section 1. Unilateral Harm Prohibition

(a) No Region may unilaterally:

- (1) divert, dam, or appropriate water in a manner that substantially
    diminishes the quantity or quality of water available to downstream
    or adjacent Regions,
- (2) discharge pollutants that render water unusable by other Regions,
- (3) destroy wetlands, flood plains, or natural water management systems
    upon which other Regions depend.

(b) **Substantial Diminishment.** For purposes of subsection (a)(1),
"substantial diminishment" means:

- (1) reduction of average annual flow by more than 10% without consent,
- (2) reduction of minimum seasonal flows below historical minimums,
- (3) degradation of water quality below applicable federal or receiving
    Region standards,
- (4) interference with navigation rights of other Regions.

(c) **Exception for Emergency.** Actions otherwise prohibited may be taken
in genuine emergency (fire suppression, public health crisis) for the
minimum duration necessary, with immediate notification to affected Regions.

### Section 2. Pollution Discharge

(a) No Region may discharge pollutants into interstate waters that:

- (1) exceed federal water quality standards,
- (2) exceed the receiving Region's water quality standards (if more
    stringent), or
- (3) cause measurable harm to downstream water users.

(b) **Source Tracing.** The Environmental Protection Agency shall maintain
monitoring systems capable of tracing pollution sources across Regional
boundaries.

(c) **Strict Liability.** A Region that discharges pollutants causing
harm to another Region's water supply is strictly liable for cleanup costs
and damages, regardless of intent or negligence.

- (2) apply equitable apportionment criteria,
- (3) issue written recommendations for allocation,
- (4) submit recommendations to the National Water Court if not accepted.

### Section 14. Budget and Staff

(a) The Board shall have an independent budget appropriated as mandatory
spending.

(b) The Board may hire technical staff, including hydrologists, engineers,
and water law specialists.

(c) Regional contributions to Board funding shall be proportional to water
usage from interstate sources.

---

## Part III: Equitable Apportionment

### Section 21. Principles

(a) Water allocation among Regions shall be governed by equitable
apportionment, not prior appropriation or riparian rights alone.

(b) No Region has absolute ownership of water passing through or bordering
its territory.

(c) All affected Regions have legitimate interests in shared water resources.

### Section 22. Allocation Criteria

(a) Equitable apportionment shall consider:

- (1) **Historical usage patterns** - existing uses and reasonable reliance,
- (2) **Population and projected needs** - current population, growth
    trends, and reasonably foreseeable demands,
- (3) **Environmental sustainability** - minimum flows for ecosystem health,
    fish and wildlife needs, recreational uses,
- (4) **Economic dependency** - industries and communities dependent on
    water access,
- (5) **Efficiency of use** - conservation efforts, wasteful vs. efficient
    uses, return flows,
- (6) **Alternative sources** - availability of groundwater, desalination,
    water recycling, or inter-basin transfers.

(b) **Weighting.** No single criterion is dispositive. The Board and courts
shall weigh all factors based on the specific circumstances.

(c) **Harm Avoidance.** Allocations shall minimize harm to existing users
while accommodating legitimate new needs.

### Section 23. Allocation Procedures

(a) **Voluntary Agreements.** Regions may negotiate water-sharing agreements
at any time. Agreements filed with the Board become enforceable.

(b) **Board-Facilitated Agreements.** Upon request of any affected Region,
the Board shall facilitate negotiations, including:

- (1) providing technical data,
- (2) identifying areas of agreement and dispute,
- (3) proposing compromise positions,
- (4) drafting agreement language.

(c) **Board Recommendations.** If facilitated negotiations fail after 180
days, the Board shall issue allocation recommendations within 90 days.

(d) **Judicial Review.** Board recommendations may be appealed to the
National Water Court within 60 days.

## Part IV: Dispute Resolution

### Section 31. Expedited Mediation

(a) A Region that believes its water rights are being violated may request
expedited mediation through the Board.

(b) **Timeline.** The Board shall:

- (1) acknowledge the request within 48 hours,
- (2) convene mediation within 7 days,
- (3) conclude mediation or issue recommendations within 21 days.

(c) **Interim Measures.** Pending mediation, the Board may recommend interim
measures to prevent irreversible harm. Regions shall comply with interim
measures in good faith.

### Section 32. National Water Court

(a) **Jurisdiction.** The National Water Court (established in Article I,
Section 7(f)) shall have exclusive original jurisdiction over:

- (1) disputes over water allocation among Regions,
- (2) enforcement of water-sharing agreements,
- (3) appeals from Board recommendations,
- (4) emergency injunctive relief for water-related harm.

(b) **Expedited Procedures.** Water cases shall be expedited, with trial
within 180 days of filing and decision within 90 days of trial.

(c) **Special Masters.** The Court may appoint special masters with water
expertise for complex technical disputes.

### Section 33. Emergency Injunctive Relief

(a) Any Region may seek emergency injunctive relief to prevent irreversible
harm to shared water resources.

(b) **Ex Parte Relief.** Ex parte temporary restraining orders may be issued
upon showing of:

## Part V: Federal Enforcement

### Section 41. Enforcement Authority

(a) In cases of ongoing or imminent harm to shared water resources, the
federal government may:

- (1) order immediate cessation of harmful activities pending dispute
    resolution,
- (2) impose sanctions on the offending Region,
- (3) implement emergency conservation measures,
- (4) assume temporary operational control of water infrastructure causing
    harm.

(b) **Sanctions.** Available sanctions include:

- (1) withholding of discretionary federal funds related to water projects,
- (2) civil penalties up to $100,000 per day of violation,
- (3) mandatory remediation orders,
- (4) federal assumption of operational control (Section 42).

*Note: Per Article X, Section 4 (Anti-Coercion Rule), equalization transfers may not be withheld as an enforcement mechanism.*

### Section 42. Operational Control

(a) Federal assumption of operational control is a last resort, authorized
only when:

- (1) a court has found willful violation of water rights,
- (2) the Region has failed to comply with court orders,
- (3) ongoing harm requires immediate operational intervention.

(b) **Duration.** Federal operational control is limited to 180 days,
renewable by court order.

(c) **Costs.** The offending Region bears all costs of federal operation.

(d) **Restoration.** Upon compliance, operational control shall be returned
immediately.

## Part VI: Preservation and Transition

### Section 51. Existing Compacts

(a) All interstate water compacts in effect at ratification remain in force.

(b) Existing compacts may be:

- (1) continued under their original terms,
- (2) modified by agreement of all parties,
- (3) superseded by Regional agreement among all affected Regions,
- (4) superseded by federal law enacted pursuant to this section.

under existing governance unless modified by the parties.

### Section 52. Tribal Water Rights

(a) Nothing in this Act diminishes treaty obligations to Tribal Nations
regarding water rights.

(b) Tribal reserved water rights are not subject to equitable apportionment
among Regions; they are prior obligations.

(c) The Board shall include tribal representatives (non-voting) when
considering allocations affecting tribal water rights.

(d) Disputes involving tribal water rights shall be resolved consistent with
federal trust responsibilities.

### Section 53. Just Compensation

(a) No taking of water rights without just compensation.

(b) If equitable apportionment reduces a Region's historical allocation,
compensation mechanisms shall be established through federal legislation
or inter-Regional agreement.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Upstream Domination

**Attack:** An upstream Region diverts most of a river's flow, claiming
economic necessity, leaving downstream Regions with insufficient water.

**Countermeasure:**

- Unilateral harm prohibition (Section 1)
- Equitable apportionment criteria consider all affected Regions (Section 22)
- Board monitoring provides early warning (Section 13(a))
- Expedited mediation and court jurisdiction (Sections 31-32)
- Federal enforcement authority including operational control (Section 41-42)

**Outcome:** Unilateral diversion is prohibited; allocation must be equitable;
federal enforcement provides backstop.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Pollution Export

**Attack:** A Region sites polluting industries near water sources flowing
to other Regions, exporting environmental costs.

**Countermeasure:**

- Pollution discharge prohibition (Section 2)
- Strict liability for cleanup and damages (Section 2(c))
- Source tracing by EPA (Section 2(b))
- Emergency injunctive relief available (Section 33)

**Outcome:** Pollution export creates strict liability; source tracing
prevents denial; courts can enjoin.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Board Capture

**Attack:** Appointing authorities coordinate to pack the Board with
members favoring certain Regions.

**Countermeasure:**

- Multiple appointing authorities (President, Governors, Chief Justice)
- Regional Governor appointments distributed across Regions
- Judicial appointees provide neutral expertise
- Six-year terms prevent rapid turnover
- Court appeal of Board recommendations provides check

**Outcome:** Capture requires coordination across multiple appointing
authorities; court review limits captured Board's damage.

---

### Attack Vector 4: Compact Manipulation

**Attack:** A Region attempts to use this Act to escape obligations under
pre-existing water compacts.

**Countermeasure:**

- Existing compacts remain in force (Section 51(a))
- Compacts can only be modified by agreement of all parties
- Federal supersession requires explicit Congressional action
- Compact agencies continue under existing governance

**Outcome:** Pre-existing compacts protected; unilateral escape not permitted.

---

### Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| Climate change alters water availability | High | Board monitoring; flexible criteria; periodic reassessment |
| Groundwater (harder to monitor) | Medium | Include aquifers in monitoring; develop tracking technology |
| Slow court processes | Medium | Expedited procedures; emergency relief; interim measures |
| Federal enforcement political pressure | Medium | Court-ordered enforcement; mandatory provisions |
