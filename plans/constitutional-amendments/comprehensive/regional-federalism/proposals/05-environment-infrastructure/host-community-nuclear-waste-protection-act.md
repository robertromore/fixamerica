# Host Community Nuclear Waste Protection Act

This proposal legally entrenches a "Host Community First" principle for nuclear waste management, ensuring that federal actions prioritize the safety, economic well-being, and consent of communities hosting nuclear waste facilities, with clear legal recourse for neglect.

---

## Purpose

Establish a Host Community Nuclear Waste Protection Framework that:

- Legally entrenches the principle that host communities' safety, economic well-being, and consent are paramount in nuclear waste management.
- Provides clear legal recourse and automatic financial compensation for host communities if federal responsibilities are neglected or abandoned.
- Ensures robust engagement and negotiation of benefits for communities hosting nuclear waste facilities.
- Strengthens public trust and legitimacy in the federal nuclear waste management program.

## Part I: Host Community First Principle

### Section 1. Host Community First Principle

(a) The federal government shall, in all aspects of nuclear waste management, prioritize the safety, economic well-being, and informed consent of host communities.

(b) "Host community" includes any local government jurisdiction where nuclear waste is stored, processed, or disposed of, or through which it is routinely transported, as well as any Tribal Nation whose lands or resources are directly affected.

### Section 2. Informed Consent Requirement

(a) No new nuclear waste storage or disposal facility shall be sited without the informed consent of the affected host community(ies), as expressed through a local referendum or a formal resolution by the local governing body.

(b) The consent process shall be transparent, provide for independent technical review, and ensure full access to information for host communities.

## Part II: Legal Recourse and Automatic Payments

### Section 11. Legal Recourse for Neglect or Abandonment

(a) If the federal government neglects its responsibility for nuclear waste management (e.g., by failing to maintain facilities, ceasing monitoring, or failing to implement agreed-upon safety measures), any affected host community shall have standing to bring an action in federal court.

(b) Federal courts shall have mandatory, expedited jurisdiction over such claims.

(c) Neglect or abandonment shall be presumed if the federal government fails to meet its statutory or contractual obligations for nuclear waste management for more than 90 days without a court-approved remediation plan.

### Section 12. Automatic Federal Payments

(a) Upon a judicial finding of federal neglect or abandonment, the affected host community shall be entitled to automatic, substantial federal payments from the Nuclear Waste Trust Fund.

(b) These payments shall be calculated to cover:
    - (1) The full costs of local monitoring, maintenance, and emergency response related to the nuclear waste facility.
    - (2) Compensation for diminished property values and economic harm caused by federal neglect.
    - (3) A punitive component of 10% of the annual federal budget allocated to nuclear waste management, to deter future neglect.

(c) Payments shall continue until the federal government demonstrates full compliance with its obligations, as certified by a federal court.

## Part III: Guaranteed Benefits and Engagement

### Section 21. Binding Benefit Agreements

(a) All agreements between the federal government and host communities regarding impact payments, economic development support, and enhanced safety measures shall be legally binding contracts.

(b) These agreements shall be funded from the Nuclear Waste Trust Fund and shall be enforceable in federal court.

### Section 22. Enhanced Engagement

(a) The federal government shall establish a permanent "Host Community Advisory Council" for each nuclear waste facility, composed of local residents and officials.

(b) The Advisory Council shall have regular access to federal officials, technical data, and independent experts, and its recommendations shall be formally considered in federal decision-making.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Federal Non-Compliance with Agreements

**Attack:** The federal government attempts to renege on benefit agreements or neglect safety measures, claiming budget constraints or changed priorities.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Legally Binding Agreements:** Section 21(a) makes benefit agreements legally binding contracts, enforceable in federal court.
-   **Automatic Payments:** Section 12(a) triggers automatic, substantial payments from the Nuclear Waste Trust Fund upon a judicial finding of neglect, creating a strong financial deterrent.
-   **Presumption of Neglect:** Section 11(c) establishes a clear threshold for presumed neglect, expediting legal action.

**Outcome:** The Act provides robust legal and financial mechanisms for host communities to enforce federal compliance, making it costly and difficult for the federal government to renege on its commitments.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Manipulation of Consent Process

**Attack:** The federal government attempts to manipulate the informed consent process to coerce communities into accepting nuclear waste facilities.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Informed Consent Requirement:** Section 2(a) mandates informed consent through local referendum or formal resolution, ensuring democratic legitimacy.
-   **Transparency and Independent Review:** Section 2(b) requires transparency and independent technical review, preventing information asymmetry.
-   **Host Community Advisory Council:** Section 22(a) provides a permanent forum for community input and oversight.

**Outcome:** The Act establishes a high bar for genuine, informed consent, making manipulation of the process difficult and challengeable.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Legal Challenges to "Host Community First"

**Attack:** The federal government or other entities challenge the "Host Community First" principle, arguing it unduly restricts national interests or federal authority.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Statutory Entrenchment:** The principle is legally entrenched in this Act, requiring legislative action to overturn.
-   **Clear Prioritization:** Section 1(a) explicitly prioritizes host community interests, providing a clear legal standard.
-   **Balancing National Interest:** The Act acknowledges the national interest in waste management but balances it with specific community protections, rather than absolute veto power.

**Outcome:** While legal challenges are always possible, the statutory entrenchment and clear prioritization of host community interests provide a strong legal basis for defending the principle.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Defining "economic well-being" and "diminished property values"** | Medium | IEC rulemaking with public comment; judicial precedent will refine over time; use of independent economic impact assessments. |
| **Host community capacity to litigate against federal government** | Medium | Federal funding for legal aid to host communities; establishment of a dedicated ombudsman office. |
| **Political pressure to override local consent in "national interest"** | High | Require supermajority Congressional vote and judicial review for any override of local consent. |
