# National Science and Technology Policy Coordination Act

This proposal defines the federal and Regional roles in setting national science policy, managing federal scientific institutions, and coordinating on major technological standards and infrastructure.

---

## Purpose

Establish a framework for National Science and Technology Policy Coordination that:

- Clarifies the governance of national laboratories and federal scientific agencies.
- Establishes a consultative process for setting national standards for emerging technologies.
- Coordinates the funding and governance of major, single-site scientific infrastructure.
- Ensures the nation maintains a coherent and world-class scientific and technological enterprise.

## Part I: Federal Scientific Institutions

### Section 1. National Laboratories Governance

(a) **National Assets.** The system of National Laboratories (e.g., Los Alamos, Oak Ridge, Lawrence Livermore) shall be affirmed as national assets under exclusive federal governance.

(b) **Host Region Consultation.** The Department of Energy (or other managing federal agency) shall establish a formal consultation process with the host Region for each National Laboratory regarding:
    - (1) Off-site environmental, safety, and health impacts.
    - (2) Land use planning adjacent to the facility.
    - (3) Emergency response coordination.
    - (4) Workforce development and local economic impact.

(c) **No Regional Veto.** Regional consultation shall not constitute a veto over the national security or scientific missions of the laboratories.

### Section 2. Federal Scientific Agencies

(a) **National Role.** Federal scientific agencies, including the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), shall serve as national providers of data, standards, and scientific services available to all Regions.

(b) **Data Accessibility.** All non-classified data produced by these agencies shall be made publicly available in open, machine-readable formats.

## Part II: National Standards and Major Infrastructure

### Section 11. National Standards Setting

(a) **Federal Authority.** The federal government, through NIST and other relevant agencies, shall retain exclusive authority over fundamental standards of weights, measures, and time.

(b) **Emerging Technologies.** For new and emerging technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotechnology), the federal government shall establish national standards through a consultative process involving:
    - (1) The National Science and Technology Council (established in Part III).
    - (2) Public notice and comment.
    - (3) Engagement with industry and academic experts.

(c) **Regional Flexibility.** Regions may establish stricter standards for technology use within their borders, provided they do not conflict with federal floors or create barriers to inter-regional commerce.

### Section 12. Major Scientific Infrastructure

(a) **Definition.** "Major Scientific Infrastructure" includes unique, large-scale scientific facilities that serve the entire nation but are located in a single Region (e.g., particle accelerators, supercomputing centers, large telescopes).

(b) **Coordination.** The funding, siting, and governance of such infrastructure shall be coordinated by the National Resilience and Infrastructure Council, as established in the `National Infrastructure Investment and Coordination Act`.

(c) **Host Region Benefits.** Host Regions for new Major Scientific Infrastructure shall be eligible for federal grants to support related educational programs, local infrastructure upgrades, and workforce development.

## Part III: Oversight and Coordination

### Section 21. National Science and Technology Council (NSTC)

(a) **Reaffirmation.** The National Science and Technology Council, chaired by the President, is reaffirmed as the principal means for coordinating science and technology policy across the federal government.

(b) **Regional Advisory Committee.** There is established a "Regional Science and Technology Advisory Committee" to the NSTC.

(c) **Composition.** The Advisory Committee shall consist of:
    - (1) The chief science advisor (or equivalent) from each Region.
    - (2) Four members from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.

(d) **Functions.** The Advisory Committee shall meet quarterly to advise the NSTC on:
    - (1) Long-term national science and technology priorities.
    - (2) Federal-Regional collaboration in research and development.
    - (3) The regional impacts of federal science policy.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Regional Obstruction of National Labs

**Attack:** A host Region attempts to use its local regulatory power (e.g., environmental permits, zoning) to obstruct the mission of a National Laboratory, citing safety or environmental concerns.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Exclusive Federal Governance (Section 1(a)):** The Act affirms that National Labs are under exclusive federal control.
- **Federal Supremacy:** Federal law and national security missions preempt conflicting Regional regulations.
- **Consultation, Not Veto (Section 1(c)):** The Act clarifies that the Regional role is consultative and does not provide veto power.

**Outcome:** While a Region can raise legitimate concerns through the consultation process, it cannot unilaterally halt the core functions of a national security or scientific asset.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Federal Imposition of Standards

**Attack:** The federal government uses its authority over emerging technology standards to impose rules that stifle Regional innovation or favor specific industries, without meaningful consultation.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Consultative Process (Section 11(b)):** The Act mandates a consultative process involving the Regional Advisory Committee and public comment.
- **Regional Flexibility (Section 11(c)):** Regions are explicitly permitted to enact stricter standards.
- **Judicial Review:** Federal standard-setting is subject to judicial review under the Administrative Procedure Act for being "arbitrary and capricious."

**Outcome:** The federal government cannot unilaterally impose standards without a transparent and consultative process. Regions retain the ability to regulate more strictly.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Politicization of Advisory Bodies

**Attack:** A federal administration or group of Regions attempts to stack the Regional Science and Technology Advisory Committee with partisan actors to steer national policy.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Diverse Composition (Section 21(c)):** The committee includes representatives from every Region and the independent National Academies, making capture by a single faction difficult.
- **Advisory Role:** The committee's role is advisory to the NSTC; it does not have direct policy-making power.
- **Transparency:** The NSTC's reports and priorities are public, allowing for scrutiny of the advice it receives and the decisions it makes.

**Outcome:** The diverse and expert-driven composition of the advisory body, combined with its public and advisory nature, mitigates the risk of partisan capture.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Funding shortfalls for science and technology** | High | Requires sustained Congressional appropriations; advocacy from scientific and business communities. |
| **"Brain Drain" from less-resourced Regions** | Medium | Federal capacity-building grants for research; incentives for researchers to work in underserved Regions. |
| **Rapid pace of technological change** | High | The Act establishes flexible, consultative processes rather than rigid, technology-specific rules. |
| **Defining "national security mission" broadly** | Medium | Congressional oversight and judicial review can provide checks on overly broad interpretations of federal authority. |
