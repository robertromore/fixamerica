# Inter-Regional Transportation and Mobility Act

This proposal establishes a framework for coordinating inter-regional transportation policies, facilitating the seamless movement of people and goods, and harmonizing regulations related to mobility across Regions.

---

## Purpose

Establish a framework for Inter-Regional Transportation and Mobility that:

-   Facilitates the seamless movement of people and goods across Regional boundaries.
-   Harmonizes transportation regulations and standards to reduce friction and enhance safety.
-   Coordinates inter-regional public transit and freight logistics.
-   Addresses challenges faced by cross-border commuters and travelers.
-   Complements infrastructure development by ensuring operational efficiency and regulatory consistency.

## Part I: Inter-Regional Public Transit Coordination

### Section 1. Inter-Regional Public Transit Authority

(a) Regions are authorized to form "Inter-Regional Public Transit Authorities" (IRPTAs) under the `Interregional Agency Compact Act` to plan, develop, and operate public transportation networks that cross Regional boundaries.

(b) IRPTAs shall be governed by a board with representation from participating Regions and federal transportation agencies.

### Section 2. Fare Integration and Schedule Synchronization

(a) IRPTAs shall implement integrated fare systems that allow seamless travel across participating Regional transit networks.

(b) IRPTAs shall coordinate schedules and transfer points to optimize efficiency and convenience for inter-regional commuters.

### Section 3. Federal Support for Inter-Regional Transit

(a) The Department of Transportation (DOT) shall provide grants and technical assistance to Regions and IRPTAs for the planning, development, and operation of inter-regional public transit projects.

(b) Federal funding shall prioritize projects that demonstrate significant reductions in traffic congestion, environmental benefits, and enhanced access to employment and services across Regions.

## Part II: Standardized Driving Regulations and Vehicle Registration

### Section 11. Driver's License Reciprocity

(a) A valid driver's license issued by any Regional authority shall be recognized as valid for operating a motor vehicle in all other Regions.

(b) The DOT shall establish minimum federal standards for driver's license testing and issuance, which all Regions must meet.

### Section 12. Vehicle Registration and Emissions Standards

(a) Vehicle registration from any Region shall be recognized as valid in all other Regions.

(b) The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shall establish national minimum emissions standards for motor vehicles, which all Regions must enforce. Regions may adopt stricter standards.

### Section 13. Harmonized Driving Laws

(a) The DOT shall develop model traffic laws and regulations for adoption by Regions, aiming to harmonize rules of the road, signage, and enforcement practices across inter-regional corridors.

(b) Regions are encouraged to adopt these model laws to reduce confusion and enhance safety for inter-regional travelers.

---

## Part III: Freight and Logistics Harmonization

### Section 21. Inter-Regional Freight Corridors

(a) The DOT, in consultation with the National Infrastructure Planning Council, shall designate "Inter-Regional Freight Corridors" for efficient movement of goods across multiple Regions.

(b) Regions shall cooperate in planning and maintaining infrastructure within these corridors, including truck parking facilities, intermodal hubs, and digital logistics platforms.

### Section 22. Trucking Regulations

(a) Federal regulations shall govern maximum truck weight limits, hours of service for drivers, and vehicle safety standards for inter-regional freight transport.

(b) Regions may not impose additional or conflicting regulations that unduly burden inter-regional freight movement, subject to review by the Allocation Review Board (ARB).

### Section 23. Digital Logistics Platforms

(a) The DOT shall promote the development and adoption of interoperable digital logistics platforms to enhance efficiency, transparency, and security in the national freight network.

---

## Part IV: Oversight and Coordination

### Section 31. Inter-Regional Transportation Planning Council

(a) There is established an "Inter-Regional Transportation Planning Council" (the "ITPC").

(b) **Composition.** The ITPC shall be composed of:
    - (1) The Secretary of Transportation (Chair).
    - (2) One representative from each Regional transportation authority, appointed by the respective Regional Governor.
    - (3) Two members appointed by the President with expertise in logistics and urban planning.

(c) **Functions.** The ITPC shall:
    - (1) Identify inter-regional mobility bottlenecks and future transportation needs.
    - (2) Plan for the integration of various transportation modes across Regions.
    - (3) Mediate disputes between Regions regarding transportation policy or projects.
    - (4) Publish an annual report on the state of inter-regional mobility.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Regional Regulatory Fragmentation

**Attack:** Regions enact highly divergent or conflicting driving laws, vehicle standards, or public transit rules, creating confusion and inefficiency for inter-regional travel and commerce.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Federal Floors (Section 11(b), 12(b)):** Establishes minimum national standards for licenses and emissions, preventing a race to the bottom.
-   **Model Laws (Section 13(a)):** DOT develops harmonized models, encouraging voluntary adoption.
-   **ITPC Mediation (Section 31(c)(3)):** The ITPC mediates disputes arising from conflicting Regional regulations.
-   **ARB Review (Section 22(b)):** Regulations unduly burdening inter-regional freight are subject to ARB review.

**Outcome:** While Regions retain some autonomy, federal floors, model laws, and dispute resolution mechanisms mitigate severe regulatory fragmentation.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Obstruction of Inter-Regional Transit Projects

**Attack:** A Region refuses to cooperate with an IRPTA or blocks a critical inter-regional public transit project due to local opposition or political reasons.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Federal Funding Incentives (Section 3(a)):** Federal grants prioritize cooperative projects, making non-cooperation costly.
-   **ITPC Mediation (Section 31(c)(3)):** The ITPC mediates disputes and can highlight non-cooperation.
-   **National Infrastructure Investment and Coordination Act:** For projects of national significance, federal eminent domain and streamlined permitting can be invoked.

**Outcome:** While local concerns are considered, federal incentives and the potential for federal intervention for projects of national importance can overcome regional obstruction.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Discriminatory Freight Regulations

**Attack:** A Region imposes unique or excessive fees, inspections, or routing restrictions on out-of-region freight carriers, claiming safety or environmental concerns, but primarily aiming to protect local trucking industries.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Federal Primacy for Inter-Regional Freight (Section 22(a)):** Federal regulations govern key aspects of inter-regional trucking.
-   **ARB Review (Section 22(b)):** Regulations unduly burdening inter-regional freight are subject to review by the Allocation Review Board.
-   **Inter-Regional Commerce and Trade Act:** Prohibits discriminatory regulations.

**Outcome:** Federal regulations and ARB oversight prevent Regions from using freight regulations as a form of economic protectionism.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Funding shortfalls for inter-regional public transit** | High | Requires sustained federal and Regional appropriations; innovative financing models (e.g., land value capture). |
| **Regional resistance to harmonizing driving laws** | Medium | Federal incentives for adoption of model laws; public awareness campaigns on benefits of harmonization. |
| **Complexity of coordinating multiple transportation modes** | Medium | ITPC to develop integrated planning tools; pilot programs for multimodal integration. |
| **Impact of new transportation technologies (e.g., autonomous vehicles)** | High | ITPC to continuously monitor and recommend adaptive regulations; federal research into policy implications. |
