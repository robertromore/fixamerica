# Federal Lands and Cultural Heritage Management Act

This proposal establishes a cooperative federal-Regional framework for the management of federal lands and cultural heritage sites, aiming to reduce conflict and give Regions a formal voice and economic stake in the stewardship of lands within their borders.

---

## Purpose

Establish a framework for Federal Lands and Cultural Heritage Management that:

-   Clarifies federal, Regional, and Tribal jurisdiction over federal lands.
-   Creates Co-Management Councils to foster collaborative planning and decision-making.
-   Establishes a fair and transparent revenue-sharing formula for activities on federal lands.
-   Formalizes law enforcement coordination between federal and Regional agencies.
-   Integrates Regional and Tribal authorities into the protection of national historic and cultural sites.

## Part I: Jurisdictional Framework

### Section 1. Federal Exclusive Jurisdiction

(a) The federal government shall retain exclusive jurisdiction over:
    - (1) Core areas of National Parks, as defined by Congress.
    - (2) Designated Wilderness Areas.
    - (3) National security installations and military reservations.
    - (4) Other sites of critical national importance as designated by federal law.

(b) In these areas, federal law and federal agency management are supreme.

### Section 2. Co-Management Jurisdiction

(a) The following federal lands shall be subject to co-management as defined in this Act:
    - (1) National Forests managed by the U.S. Forest Service.
    - (2) Public lands managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).
    - (3) National Monuments, unless designated as exclusively federal.
    - (4) National Wildlife Refuges.

(b) In these areas, management decisions shall be made through the Co-Management Councils established in Part II.

### Section 3. Regional Authority Limitations

(a) No Region may sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of federal lands within its boundaries.

(b) Regional laws may apply on co-managed federal lands only to the extent they do not conflict with federal law or approved management plans.

---

## Part II: Regional Federal Lands Councils

### Section 11. Establishment

(a) There is established within each Region containing co-managed federal lands a "Regional Federal Lands Council" (the "Council").

### Section 12. Composition

(a) Each Council shall be composed of:
    - (1) The senior federal official for each major federal land management agency within the Region (e.g., Regional Forester, BLM State Director).
    - (2) An equal number of representatives appointed by the Regional Governor, with expertise in land use, conservation, and economic development.
    - (3) At least two representatives from Tribal Nations with historical or treaty-based connections to the lands, selected by a council of affected Tribes.

(b) The Council shall be co-chaired by a federal and a Regional representative.

### Section 13. Functions

(a) The Council shall:
    - (1) Develop and approve a comprehensive 10-year management plan for all co-managed federal lands within the Region.
    - (2) Review and provide recommendations on major projects, including energy development, timber sales, and large-scale recreational uses.
    - (3) Mediate disputes between federal, Regional, and local stakeholders regarding land use.
    - (4) Publish an annual report on the status of federal lands within the Region.

(b) **Decision-Making.** Council decisions shall be made by consensus where possible. If consensus cannot be reached, decisions require a majority vote that includes at least one federal and one Regional representative.

(c) **Federal Supremacy.** Federal land management agencies retain ultimate authority but must provide a written justification for any decision that contradicts a formal recommendation of the Council. Such justifications are subject to judicial review.

---

## Part III: Revenue Sharing

### Section 21. Federal Lands Revenue Sharing Fund

(a) There is established in the Treasury a "Federal Lands Revenue Sharing Fund" for each Region.

(b) All gross revenues generated from activities on co-managed federal lands within a Region—including from resource extraction, grazing fees, timber sales, and recreation fees—shall be deposited into that Region's Fund.

### Section 22. Revenue Distribution Formula

(a) Funds from each Regional Fund shall be distributed annually according to the following formula:
    - (1) **50%** to the Federal Treasury to cover the costs of federal land management and for general revenue.
    - (2) **40%** to the host Regional government for use in conservation, infrastructure, and public services.
    - (3) **10%** to the affected local governments (counties or municipalities) where the revenue-generating activity occurred, as compensation for local impacts.

(b) This formula replaces previous federal payment programs such as Payments in Lieu of Taxes (PILT).

### Section 23. Transparency

(a) The Department of the Interior shall publish an annual public report detailing all revenues collected and distributed under this Act for each Region.

---

## Part IV: Law Enforcement Coordination

### Section 31. Mutual Aid and Cross-Deputization

(a) Federal land management agencies (e.g., Park Police, Forest Service Law Enforcement, BLM Rangers) and Regional law enforcement shall negotiate and enter into binding mutual aid and cross-deputization agreements.

(b) These agreements shall define jurisdictional priorities, command structures for joint operations, and communication protocols.

### Section 32. Jurisdictional Priority

(a) Federal law enforcement shall have primary jurisdiction over crimes occurring on federal lands.

(b) Regional law enforcement may exercise jurisdiction on federal lands pursuant to cross-deputization agreements or in cases of hot pursuit.

### Section 33. Joint Training

(a) Federal and Regional law enforcement agencies shall conduct regular joint training exercises for scenarios on or near federal lands.

---

## Part V: Cultural Heritage Protection

### Section 41. Integration with National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA)

(a) The review process under Section 106 of the NHPA for federal undertakings on co-managed lands shall be conducted in direct consultation with the relevant Regional Federal Lands Council.

(b) The Regional Historic Preservation Officer (RHPO) shall be a mandatory consulting party for all Section 106 reviews within their Region.

### Section 42. Tribal Heritage Protection

(a) Federal agencies shall conduct government-to-government consultation with any Tribal Nation that attaches religious or cultural significance to a historic property, regardless of its location.

(b) Tribal Historic Preservation Officers (THPOs) shall have a primary role in identifying and evaluating cultural resources on federal lands.

(c) Access to sacred sites on federal lands shall be protected and managed in consultation with affected Tribes.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Federal Overreach

**Attack:** Federal agencies consistently ignore the recommendations of a Regional Federal Lands Council, rendering it powerless.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Written Justification Requirement (Section 13(c)):** Federal agencies must create a public, written record justifying their decision to overrule the Council.
-   **Judicial Review:** This written justification can be challenged in federal court as "arbitrary and capricious," providing a legal check on federal overreach.
-   **Political Accountability:** Regional representatives on the Council can raise the political cost of federal unilateralism.

**Outcome:** While the federal government retains ultimate authority, the procedural hurdles and threat of judicial review make it difficult to systematically ignore the Council.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Regional Obstruction

**Attack:** A Region uses its position on the Council to block all new projects or resource management activities on federal lands, creating gridlock.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Majority Vote Decision-Making (Section 13(b)):** The Council does not require unanimity. A single Region cannot veto a decision if federal and Tribal representatives agree.
-   **Federal Supremacy (Section 13(c)):** In cases of true gridlock, the federal agency can still act after providing justification, preventing total paralysis.

**Outcome:** A Region can raise objections and force deliberation but cannot unilaterally veto all activities on federal lands.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Revenue Diversion

**Attack:** Congress or a federal agency attempts to divert revenues from the Federal Lands Revenue Sharing Fund for other purposes, or fails to make the required payments to Regions and localities.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Statutory Formula (Section 22):** The revenue sharing formula is established by law, not administrative discretion.
-   **Mandatory Distribution:** The Act mandates annual distribution from the Fund.
-   **Legal Standing:** Regions and local governments would have standing to sue in federal court to compel payment based on the statutory formula.

**Outcome:** Revenue sharing is a legal entitlement, not a discretionary payment, and is enforceable in court.

---

### Attack Vector 4: Neglect of Cultural Heritage

**Attack:** A Council, dominated by economic interests, approves management plans that prioritize resource extraction at the expense of cultural or historic sites.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Mandatory Consultation (Sections 41, 42):** The NHPA and tribal consultation processes are mandatory and operate independently of the Council's general management plan.
-   **Tribal Representation:** Tribal representatives on the Council have a direct voice to raise concerns.
-   **Legal Challenges:** Violations of the NHPA or other preservation laws can be challenged in court by Tribes, preservation groups, and other stakeholders.

**Outcome:** Cultural heritage protection is not merely a discretionary part of the management plan but a separate, legally mandated requirement that cannot be easily overridden by the Council.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Defining "core areas" of National Parks** | Medium | Requires specific Congressional legislation for each park, which could be contentious. |
| **Disputes between Regions and Tribes on Councils** | Medium | Federal co-chair can mediate; ultimate disputes resolved through federal courts. |
| **Insufficient federal funding for land management** | High | Revenue sharing provides some funds, but Congressional appropriations are still critical for overall agency budgets. |
| **Political will to enforce against powerful economic interests** | Medium | Transparency and public reporting requirements create political pressure; citizen lawsuits provide an alternative enforcement path. |
