## Purpose

Establish a framework for National Environmental Quality Standards that:

-   Ensures a consistent baseline of environmental and public health protection across the nation.
-   Prevents a "race to the bottom" on environmental standards among Regions.
-   Creates a coordinated federal-Regional framework for environmental permitting and enforcement.
-   Preserves Regional authority to enact stricter environmental protections.

## Part I: Federal Environmental Quality Floors

### Section 1. Establishment of Federal Floors

(a) The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) shall establish and enforce binding federal minimum standards ("floors") for:
    - (1) **Ambient Air Quality:** National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for criteria pollutants (e.g., ozone, particulate matter, lead).
    - (2) **Water Quality:** National minimum water quality criteria for surface waters (lakes, rivers) and groundwater, including standards for drinking water.
    - (3) **Waste Disposal:** Minimum standards for the safe disposal of non-nuclear solid and hazardous waste.

(b) These floors shall be based on the best available science to protect public health and the environment, with a margin of safety.

(c) **Regional Authority.** Regions may establish and enforce environmental quality standards that are stricter than these federal floors.

---

## Part II: Coordinated Permitting and Enforcement

### Section 11. Coordinated Permitting

(a) **Primary Regional Authority.** Regions shall be the primary permitting authority for projects within their boundaries, responsible for ensuring compliance with both federal floors and any stricter Regional standards.

(b) **Coordinated Review for Inter-Regional Projects.** For major projects with significant environmental impacts that cross Regional boundaries (e.g., pipelines, transmission lines), a joint federal-Regional environmental review process shall be established.
    - (1) A lead agency (either federal or Regional, by mutual agreement) shall coordinate a single environmental impact review.
    - (2) The review shall assess compliance with the standards of all affected Regions.

### Section 12. Federal Enforcement Authority

(a) **Backstop Enforcement.** The EPA shall have authority to enforce federal environmental floors if a Region fails to do so ("backstop enforcement").

(b) Federal backstop enforcement is triggered if:
    - (1) A Region demonstrates a pattern of non-enforcement against major violators.
    - (2) A Region fails to submit or implement an adequate plan to meet federal floors.
    - (3) A Region requests federal assistance in enforcement.

(c) Federal enforcement may include issuing compliance orders, levying penalties, and bringing civil or criminal actions.

### Section 13. Citizen Suits

(a) Any person or organization shall have the right to bring a civil action in federal court against:
    - (1) Any entity alleged to be in violation of a federal environmental floor.
    - (2) The EPA or a Regional agency for an alleged failure to perform any non-discretionary act or duty under this Act.

## Part III: Monitoring and Data

### Section 21. National Environmental Monitoring System

(a) The EPA, in coordination with the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), shall establish and maintain a national network for monitoring environmental quality.

(b) The network shall provide real-time, publicly accessible data on air quality, water quality, and other key environmental indicators across all Regions.

### Section 22. Regional Reporting

(a) Regions shall report annually to the EPA on their compliance with federal environmental floors.

(b) Reports shall include data on pollutant levels, enforcement actions, and progress toward meeting quality standards.

---

## Part IV: Oversight and Coordination

### Section 31. Inter-Regional Environmental Council

(a) There is established an "Inter-Regional Environmental Council" (the "Council").

(b) **Composition.** The Council shall be composed of:
    - (1) The Administrator of the EPA (Chair).
    - (2) The head of each Regional environmental protection agency.

(c) **Functions.** The Council shall:
    - (1) Facilitate coordination and share best practices on environmental protection.
    - (2) Mediate disputes between Regions regarding environmental policy (distinct from transboundary harm, which is covered by a separate Act).
    - (3) Advise the EPA on the review and updating of federal environmental floors.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Regional "Race to the Bottom"

**Attack:** A Region attempts to attract industry by offering lax enforcement of environmental standards or by refusing to adopt plans to meet federal floors.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Binding Federal Floors (Section 1):** The Act establishes binding federal minimum standards, preventing Regions from legally weakening protections.
-   **Federal Backstop Enforcement (Section 12):** The EPA has the authority to step in and enforce federal law if a Region fails to do so.
-   **Citizen Suits (Section 13):** Allows individuals and organizations to sue for non-compliance, creating an additional layer of enforcement that bypasses Regional inaction.

**Outcome:** A Region cannot legally compete by lowering standards. While lax enforcement is possible, it triggers federal backstop authority and legal challenges.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Federal Overreach

**Attack:** A federal administration uses its authority to set federal floors to create de facto "ceilings," making it difficult for Regions to enact stricter protections.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Explicit Regional Authority (Section 1(c)):** The Act explicitly preserves the right of Regions to establish stricter standards.
-   **Judicial Review:** Federal regulations that effectively function as ceilings by preempting stricter Regional laws would be subject to judicial review.
-   **Council Input (Section 31(c)):** The Inter-Regional Environmental Council provides a formal channel for Regions to push back against federal overreach in the standard-setting process.

**Outcome:** The statutory language and council structure are designed to ensure the federal role is focused on establishing a baseline, not dictating all aspects of environmental policy.

---

### Attack Vector 3: "Permit Shopping"

**Attack:** An industry with a major project (e.g., a large factory) "shops" for a permit in the Region with the weakest (though still federally compliant) environmental standards, even if the project's impacts will be felt across multiple Regions.

**Countermeasure:**

-   **Coordinated Inter-Regional Review (Section 11(b)):** Major projects with inter-regional impacts are subject to a joint review process that considers the standards of all affected Regions.
-   **Transboundary Environmental Harm Prevention Act:** This separate but related Act provides a direct legal mechanism for a downwind or downstream Region to challenge pollution that crosses its borders, regardless of the permitting Region's standards.

**Outcome:** While a project may be sited in a more lenient Region, it cannot legally export its pollution to neighboring Regions, and the joint review process ensures that inter-regional impacts are considered.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Funding for enforcement and monitoring** | High | Requires sustained federal and Regional appropriations; citizen suits provide a non-governmental enforcement mechanism. |
| **Defining "major project" for joint review** | Medium | EPA rulemaking with public comment; Council to develop clear thresholds based on potential impact. |
| **Political pressure to weaken federal floors** | High | The standard-setting process must be transparent and science-based; strong public advocacy is required to defend protective standards. |
| **Complexity of attributing pollution sources** | Medium | Enhanced national monitoring network; advanced modeling; scientific peer review. |
