# Climate Emergency Coordination Framework

This proposal establishes a framework for coordinated multi-regional response
to climate change, including carbon policy coordination, climate migration
management, and shared adaptation infrastructure governance.

This proposal addresses [Gap 25 — Climate Emergency Coordination](../04-meta/02-identified-gaps.md)
by creating coordination mechanisms that respect regional autonomy while
enabling collective action on climate challenges.

---

## Constitutional Placement

This framework would be implemented as:

- Enabling legislation under existing federal commerce and treaty powers
- Inter-regional cooperation mechanisms under Article I, Section 5
- Joint authority templates under Article I, Section 5A

Constitutional amendment is not required; the framework uses existing
constitutional authorities.

---

## Purpose

Create a framework that:

- enables voluntary carbon policy coordination among willing Regions,
- prevents free-rider problems while respecting regional autonomy,
- manages climate-driven internal migration humanely,
- governs shared adaptation infrastructure across Regional boundaries, and
- positions the United States to meet international climate commitments.

## Part II: Voluntary Carbon Policy Coordination

### Section 11. Regional Carbon Pricing Compact

(a) **Authorization.** Regions may form a Regional Carbon Pricing Compact under
Article I, Section 5.

(b) **Model Framework.** The National Resilience and Infrastructure Council (the "Council"), established by the `National Infrastructure Investment and Coordination Act`, shall develop a model compact framework
including:

- (1) carbon pricing mechanisms (tax, cap-and-trade, or hybrid);
- (2) emission reporting standards;
- (3) border adjustment mechanisms for inter-regional trade;
- (4) revenue distribution formulas;
- (5) linkage with international carbon markets.

(c) **Minimum Standards for Linkage.** Regions participating in linked carbon
markets shall maintain:

- (1) comparable monitoring and verification standards;
- (2) transparent price disclosure;
- (3) no direct subsidies that effectively negate carbon pricing.

### Section 12. Border Carbon Adjustments

(a) **Interstate Commerce.** Regions with carbon pricing may impose border
adjustments on goods from Regions without equivalent pricing, subject to:

- (1) non-discrimination (same adjustment applies to domestic and imported goods
    with equivalent carbon content);
- (2) transparent methodology published in advance;
- (3) credit for carbon costs paid in originating Region.

(b) **Federal Coordination.** If five or more Regions adopt carbon pricing, the
Council shall propose a harmonized border adjustment methodology.

(c) **Commerce Clause Compliance.** Border adjustments must not discriminate
against interstate commerce; adjustments based solely on carbon content, not
Regional origin, are presumptively valid.

### Section 13. Non-Participating Regions

(a) Regions not participating in carbon pricing compacts retain full authority
over their energy and environmental policies.

(b) Non-participating Regions may not:

- (1) impose retaliatory trade barriers against participating Regions;
- (2) subsidize carbon-intensive production specifically to undercut
    participating Regions.

(c) The Council shall publish annual reports comparing emissions trajectories
across all Regions.

## Part III: Climate Migration Management

### Section 21. Definitions

For purposes of this Part:

- (a) "Climate migrant" means a person who relocates primarily due to:
    - (1) sea level rise rendering prior residence uninhabitable;
    - (2) wildfire, flood, or storm damage destroying prior residence;
    - (3) water scarcity affecting agricultural viability;
    - (4) extreme heat rendering prior location dangerous for health.
- (b) "Receiving Region" means a Region experiencing net in-migration of
    climate migrants.
- (c) "Origin Region" means a Region experiencing net out-migration of
    climate migrants.

### Section 22. Freedom of Movement Preserved

(a) Climate migrants retain all rights under Article I, Section 8 (Freedom of
Movement).

(b) No Region may impose waiting periods, residency requirements, or other
barriers to climate migrants exceeding those permitted under Article I,
Section 8.

(c) Climate migrant status does not create additional rights beyond those
available to all persons relocating between Regions.

### Section 23. Federal Climate Migration Assistance

(a) **Assistance Fund.** There is established the Climate Migration Assistance
Fund.

(b) **Receiving Region Grants.** Receiving Regions may apply for grants to:

- (1) expand housing capacity;
- (2) increase school and healthcare capacity;
- (3) improve transportation infrastructure;
- (4) provide transitional assistance to migrants.

(c) **Origin Region Assistance.** Origin Regions may apply for grants to:

- (1) support managed retreat from vulnerable areas;
- (2) provide relocation assistance to departing residents;
- (3) fund infrastructure decommissioning;
- (4) develop remaining viable areas.

(d) **Allocation Formula.** Grant allocation shall consider:

- (1) net migration volume;
- (2) regional fiscal capacity;
- (3) climate vulnerability assessments;
- (4) demonstrated need.

### Section 24. Planned Retreat Coordination

(a) **Federal Buyout Program.** The federal government may offer voluntary
property buyouts in areas certified as:

- (1) subject to repetitive flood loss;
- (2) within projected sea level rise zones;
- (3) in wildfire-urban interface zones with extreme risk;
- (4) experiencing aquifer depletion below sustainable levels.

(b) **Buyout Terms.** Properties purchased under this program:

- (1) shall be compensated at pre-disaster fair market value;
- (2) shall be permanently retired from development;
- (3) may be transferred to conservation or public use.

(c) **Regional Coordination.** Federal buyout programs shall be coordinated
with Regional land use planning.

## Part IV: Shared Adaptation Infrastructure

### Section 31. Cross-Boundary Infrastructure Definition

(a) "Shared adaptation infrastructure" includes:

- (1) coastal protection systems spanning Regional boundaries;
- (2) water management systems (reservoirs, aqueducts, desalination) serving
    multiple Regions;
- (3) wildfire prevention and response systems in boundary zones;
- (4) regional electric grid resilience improvements;
- (5) multi-regional early warning systems.

### Section 32. Joint Authority Model

(a) Regions may establish joint authorities for shared adaptation infrastructure
under Article I, Section 5A.

(b) Climate adaptation joint authorities shall comply with the Inter-Regional
Joint Authority Template, with the following modifications:

- (1) the Council may provide technical assistance;
- (2) federal matching grants are available for qualifying projects;
- (3) long-term maintenance commitments may be required as grant conditions.

### Section 33. Federal Adaptation Infrastructure

(a) The federal government may directly fund and construct adaptation
infrastructure that:

- (1) serves three or more Regions;
- (2) addresses federal land or facilities;
- (3) supports international obligations;
- (4) is requested by affected Regions.

(b) Federal adaptation infrastructure shall be:

- (1) designed in consultation with affected Regions;

- (3) priority projects for federal investment;
- (4) cost-sharing formulas for joint projects.

(b) **No Mandated Retreat.** Federal authorities may not mandate managed retreat;
buyout programs are voluntary.

(c) **Insurance Coordination.** The Council shall coordinate with the National Flood
Insurance Program to align incentives with adaptation planning.

## Part V: Carbon Leakage Prevention

### Section 41. Leakage Definition

(a) "Carbon leakage" means the relocation of carbon-intensive production from
Regions with climate policies to Regions without equivalent policies.

(b) Leakage undermines the environmental effectiveness of Regional climate
policies.

### Section 42. Anti-Leakage Measures

(a) **Border Adjustments.** Regions may impose border carbon adjustments
consistent with Section 12.

(b) **Subsidy Transparency.** The Council shall publish annual reports identifying:

- (1) energy subsidies by Region;
- (2) effective carbon prices by Region;
- (3) evidence of leakage patterns.

(c) **No Protectionism.** Anti-leakage measures must be:

- (1) based on carbon content, not Regional origin;
- (2) proportionate to the carbon price differential;
- (3) transparent in methodology.

### Section 43. Federal Backstop

(a) If carbon leakage demonstrably undermines climate commitments, Congress may:

- (1) establish a federal carbon floor price;
- (2) condition federal infrastructure funding on carbon pricing adoption;
- (3) impose federal border adjustments on international trade.

(b) Federal action under this Section requires:

- (1) finding of significant leakage by the Council;
- (2) Congressional authorization;
- (3) two-year implementation delay to allow Regional response.

---

## Part VI: International Coordination

### Section 51. Treaty Compliance

(a) Federal authorities retain exclusive power over international climate
treaties.

(b) Regions may not enter binding international climate agreements.

(c) Regions may participate in subnational climate networks (e.g., Under2
Coalition) that do not create binding legal obligations.

### Section 52. Regional Implementation

(a) When international climate commitments require domestic implementation,
Congress may:

- (1) establish minimum standards applicable nationwide;
- (2) authorize Regions to exceed federal minimums;
- (3) allocate implementation responsibilities to Regions.

(b) Implementation shall respect Regional autonomy to the maximum extent
consistent with treaty obligations.

### Section 53. International Carbon Market Linkage

(a) Linkage of Regional carbon markets to international markets requires
federal approval.

(b) Federal approval shall be granted if the international market meets:

- (1) comparable environmental integrity standards;
- (2) transparent verification;
- (3) reciprocal access for U.S. participants.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Coercive Coordination

**Attack:** Federal government uses climate coordination to force policies on
unwilling Regions.

**Countermeasure:**

- The Council's role is primarily advisory and coordinative; it has no direct mandate authority.
- Regional participation in compacts is voluntary (Section 11(a))
- Federal backstop requires Congressional authorization and delay (Section 43)

**Outcome:** Climate policy remains Regional unless Congress acts; coordination
cannot become coercion without legislative action.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Free Rider Problem

**Attack:** Regions refuse to adopt climate policies while benefiting from
others' efforts.

**Countermeasure:**

- Border carbon adjustments permitted (Section 12)
- Transparency reporting on emissions (Section 13(c))
- Federal backstop available if leakage significant (Section 43)

**Outcome:** Non-participating Regions face economic consequences; free riding
has costs.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Anti-Migrant Discrimination

**Attack:** Receiving Regions discriminate against climate migrants.

**Countermeasure:**

- Freedom of movement preserved (Section 22)
- Climate migrants have same rights as all interstate movers
- No special barriers permitted

**Outcome:** Constitutional freedom of movement protections apply; discrimination
is unconstitutional.

---

### Attack Vector 4: Adaptation Infrastructure Capture

**Attack:** Joint authorities for adaptation infrastructure are captured by
narrow interests.

**Countermeasure:**

- Joint authority template requirements apply (Section 32(b)).
- Transparency, audit, and sunset provisions
- Federal matching grants provide oversight leverage

**Outcome:** Standard anti-capture provisions apply to climate infrastructure.

---

### Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| No Region adopts carbon pricing | High | Market and international pressure; no constitutional remedy |
| Climate migration overwhelms receiving Regions | Medium | Federal assistance fund; no guarantee of adequacy |
| Adaptation investment insufficient | High | Political question; budget appropriation required |
| International commitments unmet | Medium | Treaty power remains federal; can act if needed |
