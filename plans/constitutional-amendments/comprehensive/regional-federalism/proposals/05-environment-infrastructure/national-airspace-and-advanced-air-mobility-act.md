# National Airspace and Advanced Air Mobility Act

This proposal modernizes the governance of the national airspace to safely integrate drones and advanced air mobility (AAM), while clarifying federal and Regional roles and responsibilities.

---

## Purpose

Establish a framework for National Airspace and Advanced Air Mobility that:

- Reaffirms exclusive federal authority over high-altitude navigable airspace.
- Authorizes Regions to manage low-altitude airspace, subject to federal standards.
- Directs the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to develop a comprehensive national plan for AAM integration.
- Clarifies Regional authority over the siting and zoning of AAM ground infrastructure.
- Ensures the safe, efficient, and equitable integration of new aviation technologies.

## Part I: Federal Airspace Authority and National Strategy

### Section 1. Federal Airspace Authority

(a) The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) shall retain primary and exclusive authority over all navigable airspace of the United States above 400 feet Above Ground Level (AGL).

(b) This authority includes, but is not limited to, air traffic control, certification of aircraft and airmen, and the establishment of national safety and operational standards for all operations within this airspace.

### Section 2. National Advanced Air Mobility Integration Plan

(a) The FAA shall, in consultation with the National Airspace and AAM Advisory Council (established in Part III), develop and maintain a comprehensive "National Advanced Air Mobility Integration Plan."

(b) The Plan shall include:
    - (1) Standards for the certification of AAM aircraft and related technologies.
    - (2) Requirements for AAM pilot and operator licensing and training.
    - (3) Protocols for the safe and efficient integration of AAM operations into the national air traffic management system.
    - (4) Cybersecurity standards for AAM systems and infrastructure.
    - (5) National noise and environmental standards for AAM operations.

## Part II: Regional Low-Altitude Management and Ground Infrastructure

### Section 11. Regional Low-Altitude Airspace Management

(a) Regions shall have primary authority to manage airspace below 400 feet AGL within their boundaries.

(b) Regional low-altitude airspace management shall be subject to federal safety and interoperability standards established by the FAA.

(c) Regions may establish local rules and regulations for drone operations, package delivery, and other low-altitude AAM activities, provided they do not conflict with federal standards or create unreasonable barriers to inter-regional AAM operations.

### Section 12. Vertiport Siting and Zoning

(a) Regions shall have primary authority over the siting and zoning of AAM ground infrastructure, including vertiports, charging stations, and maintenance facilities.

(b) Regional siting and zoning decisions must comply with federal safety standards for vertiport design and operation established by the FAA.

(c) Regional decisions shall not create unreasonable barriers to the development of AAM infrastructure necessary for inter-regional AAM operations, subject to review by the Allocation Review Board (ARB).

### Section 13. Inter-Regional Airspace Compacts

(a) Regions are authorized and encouraged to form "Inter-Regional Airspace Compacts" under the `Interregional Agency Compact Act` for the coordinated management of low-altitude airspace in shared metropolitan areas or economically integrated corridors.

(b) Such compacts may address:
    - (1) Harmonized low-altitude operational rules.
    - (2) Coordinated vertiport network planning.
    - (3) Joint emergency response protocols for AAM incidents.

## Part III: Oversight and Coordination

### Section 21. National Airspace and AAM Advisory Council

(a) There is established a "National Airspace and AAM Advisory Council" (the "Council").

(b) **Composition.** The Council shall be composed of:
    - (1) The FAA Administrator (Chair).
    - (2) The Secretary of Transportation.
    - (3) One representative from each Regional transportation or aviation authority.
    - (4) Four members appointed by the President with expertise in AAM technology, urban planning, and environmental science.
    - (5) Two non-voting members representing the AAM industry and consumer advocacy groups.

(c) **Functions.** The Council shall:
    - (1) Advise the FAA on the development and implementation of the National AAM Integration Plan.
    - (2) Facilitate coordination and information sharing between federal and Regional authorities on airspace management.
    - (3) Mediate disputes between Regions regarding low-altitude airspace management or vertiport siting.
    - (4) Publish an annual report on the state of AAM integration and airspace safety.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Federal Overreach into Low-Altitude Airspace

**Attack:** The FAA attempts to assert control over all airspace, including low-altitude operations, stifling Regional innovation and local control.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Explicit Regional Authority (Section 11(a)):** The Act explicitly grants Regions primary authority over airspace below 400 feet AGL.
- **Federal Standards as Floors:** Federal safety and interoperability standards are designed as minimums, allowing Regions to innovate above them.
- **Council as Check:** The National Airspace and AAM Advisory Council, with strong Regional representation, provides a forum to challenge federal overreach.

**Outcome:** The Act creates a clear division of authority, preventing the FAA from unilaterally seizing control of low-altitude airspace without legislative change.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Regional Fragmentation of Low-Altitude Rules

**Attack:** Regions establish highly divergent or conflicting rules for low-altitude AAM operations, creating a patchwork of regulations that makes inter-regional AAM impractical.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Federal Interoperability Standards (Section 11(b)):** FAA sets binding standards to ensure seamless operation across Regional boundaries.
- **Inter-Regional Airspace Compacts (Section 13):** Encourages and facilitates voluntary harmonization of rules.
- **Council Mediation (Section 21(c)(3)):** The Council can mediate disputes and promote best practices for harmonized regulations.
- **Unreasonable Barriers (Section 12(c)):** Regional vertiport siting decisions cannot create unreasonable barriers to inter-regional AAM.

**Outcome:** While Regions retain flexibility, federal standards and coordination mechanisms aim to prevent regulatory fragmentation from hindering the development of a national AAM ecosystem.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Compromise of Safety Standards

**Attack:** A Region, eager to attract AAM investment, approves vertiports or low-altitude operations that do not meet adequate safety standards, potentially endangering the public.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Federal Safety Standards (Section 2(b), 12(b)):** The FAA establishes binding national safety standards for AAM aircraft, operations, and vertiport design.
- **Federal Oversight:** The FAA retains authority to investigate AAM incidents and enforce federal safety regulations, regardless of Regional approval.
- **Council Oversight (Section 21(c)(4)):** The Council monitors and reports on airspace safety, highlighting any Regional deficiencies.

**Outcome:** Federal safety standards act as a critical floor, and federal oversight ensures that Regional economic development efforts do not compromise public safety.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Funding shortfalls for AAM infrastructure** | High | Requires sustained federal and Regional appropriations; integration with `National Infrastructure Investment and Coordination Act`. |
| **Public acceptance and noise concerns** | Medium | National noise standards; Regional siting authority allows for local input; public education campaigns. |
| **Rapid pace of technological change** | High | The Act focuses on principles and adaptive planning; FAA rulemaking authority allows for updates to standards. |
| **Defining "unreasonable barriers" for Regional siting** | Medium | ARB and judicial precedent will be required to develop a clear body of case law. |
