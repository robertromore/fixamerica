# Inter-Regional Biodiversity and Endangered Species Act

This proposal establishes a cooperative federal-Regional framework for the conservation of biodiversity and the recovery of endangered species, adapting the landmark Endangered Species Act to the Regional Federalism model.

---

## Purpose

Establish a framework for Inter-Regional Biodiversity and Endangered Species Management that:

- Clarifies federal, Regional, and Tribal roles in species conservation.
- Ensures effective protection and recovery of endangered and threatened species across jurisdictional boundaries.
- Fosters collaborative planning and decision-making for species and habitat management.
- Provides mechanisms for resolving inter-regional disputes over conservation strategies.
- Balances conservation needs with Regional economic development and land use.

## Part I: Federal Authority and Listing

### Section 1. Federal Listing Authority

(a) The federal government, through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), shall retain exclusive authority to list species as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).

(b) The criteria for listing species shall be based solely on the best available scientific and commercial data, without regard to political or economic considerations.

### Section 2. Federal Protection and Recovery

(a) The federal government shall retain primary responsibility for:
    - (1) Developing and implementing recovery plans for listed species.
    - (2) Designating critical habitat for listed species.
    - (3) Prohibiting the "take" of listed species (harass, harm, pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect, or attempt to engage in any such conduct).

(b) Federal agencies shall consult with the FWS/NMFS to ensure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out by them is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any endangered or threatened species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.

## Part II: Inter-Regional Coordination and Planning

### Section 11. Inter-Regional Recovery Teams

(a) For any listed species whose habitat spans two or more Regions, the FWS/NMFS shall establish an "Inter-Regional Recovery Team."

(b) **Composition.** Each Team shall include:
    - (1) Federal FWS/NMFS experts.
    - (2) Representatives from each affected Regional wildlife or natural resource agency.
    - (3) Representatives from Tribal Nations with historical or treaty-based connections to the species or its habitat.
    - (4) Independent scientific experts.

(c) **Functions.** The Team shall:
    - (1) Develop and update inter-regional recovery plans.
    - (2) Coordinate habitat management and restoration efforts.
    - (3) Facilitate data sharing and joint monitoring programs.
    - (4) Mediate disputes between Regions regarding species management.

### Section 12. Habitat Conservation Planning (HCPs)

(a) Regions are encouraged to develop "Habitat Conservation Plans" (HCPs) for listed species within their boundaries.

(b) HCPs shall:
    - (1) Identify impacts of proposed development on listed species.
    - (2) Specify measures to minimize and mitigate those impacts.
    - (3) Ensure that the plan will not appreciably reduce the likelihood of the survival and recovery of the species in the wild.

(c) Federal approval of an HCP shall provide assurances to the Region and private landowners that no additional mitigation will be required for the covered species.

### Section 13. Data Sharing and Monitoring

(a) The FWS/NMFS shall establish a national biodiversity data system to track species populations, habitat health, and conservation efforts across Regional boundaries.

(b) Regional wildlife agencies shall provide standardized data to this system on an annual basis.

---

## Part III: Conflict Resolution and Enforcement

### Section 21. Dispute Resolution

(a) Disputes between Regions over species conservation strategies, habitat management, or land use decisions affecting listed species shall first be mediated by the Inter-Regional Recovery Team.

(b) If mediation fails, the dispute shall be referred to the Allocation Review Board (ARB) for binding adjudication.

(c) ARB determinations are subject to expedited judicial review in federal court.

### Section 22. Federal Enforcement

(a) The federal government shall retain authority to enforce the ESA, including prohibitions on "take" and critical habitat protections, regardless of Regional law.

(b) Federal enforcement actions shall prioritize cases where:
    - (1) A species is in imminent danger of extinction.
    - (2) Regional actions are demonstrably undermining a federal recovery plan.
    - (3) Inter-regional disputes remain unresolved and threaten species survival.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Regional Obstruction of Recovery Efforts

**Attack:** A Region, citing economic development or local control, refuses to cooperate with an Inter-Regional Recovery Team or actively undermines federal recovery plans for a listed species.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Federal Enforcement (Section 22(a)):** The federal government retains authority to enforce the ESA directly, overriding Regional obstruction.
- **Dispute Resolution (Section 21(b)):** The ARB can issue binding adjudications, compelling Regional compliance.
- **Federal Supremacy:** Federal law (ESA) is supreme in species listing and "take" prohibitions.

**Outcome:** While cooperation is preferred, Regional obstruction cannot legally halt federal conservation efforts for listed species; federal enforcement and ARB adjudication provide backstops.

---

### Attack Vector 2: "Paper Parks" and Ineffective HCPs

**Attack:** A Region develops a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) that is weak or ineffective, primarily serving to permit development rather than genuinely conserve species, and seeks federal approval.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Strict HCP Requirements (Section 12(b)):** HCPs must ensure no appreciable reduction in species survival/recovery.
- **Federal Approval (Section 12(c)):** Federal agencies (FWS/NMFS) must approve HCPs, ensuring they meet federal standards.
- **Scientific Basis:** Listing and recovery decisions are based solely on scientific data (Section 1(b)).

**Outcome:** HCPs must meet rigorous federal scientific and conservation standards; federal agencies are not compelled to approve ineffective plans.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Data Withholding

**Attack:** A Region withholds critical species data from the national biodiversity data system, hindering effective inter-regional conservation planning.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Mandatory Data Provision (Section 13(b)):** Regional agencies are required to provide standardized data.
- **Conditional Federal Funding:** Federal grants for wildlife management or related environmental programs can be conditioned on data sharing compliance.
- **Dispute Resolution (Section 21(b)):** The ARB can adjudicate disputes over data sharing.

**Outcome:** Data withholding can lead to loss of federal funding and be subject to ARB adjudication, incentivizing compliance.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Political pressure to delist species** | Medium | Listing criteria are science-based (Section 1(b)); judicial review of listing decisions. |
| **Funding shortfalls for recovery efforts** | High | Requires sustained federal and Regional appropriations; private conservation partnerships. |
| **Complexity of managing highly mobile species** | Medium | Inter-Regional Recovery Teams are designed for this; robust data sharing. |
| **Impact of climate change on species habitats** | High | Requires integration with `Climate Emergency Coordination Framework` and adaptive management strategies. |
