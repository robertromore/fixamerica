# Nuclear Facilities and Hazardous Materials Governance

This proposal clarifies federal and Regional authority over nuclear facilities,
hazardous materials transport, and radioactive waste management to prevent
regulatory gaps and ensure coordinated safety oversight.

This proposal addresses [Gap 28 — Nuclear Facilities and Hazardous Materials Governance](../../04-meta/02-identified-gaps.md)
by establishing clear jurisdictional boundaries and coordination mechanisms
for safety-critical materials.

---

## Constitutional Placement

This framework confirms and clarifies that nuclear and hazardous materials
governance falls under federal enumerated powers for:

- interstate commerce regulation
- national defense
- treaty obligations (nuclear nonproliferation)

Implementation would be through:

- **Allocation Framework Act** clarification confirming federal authority
- **Nuclear and Hazardous Materials Coordination Act** - Implementing legislation

Constitutional amendment is not required; this proposal clarifies application
of existing federal powers under Article II.

---

## Purpose

Establish clear governance that:

- confirms federal authority over nuclear facilities and hazardous materials,
- prevents Regions from blocking essential safety infrastructure,
- ensures coordination for emergency planning across Regional boundaries,
- provides mechanisms for Regional input without Regional veto,
- addresses waste storage siting through fair allocation processes.

## Part II: Siting and Coordination

### Section 11. Nuclear Facility Siting

(a) **Federal Licensing.** Nuclear facilities require federal NRC license.

(b) **Regional Notification.** Before filing a license application for a new
nuclear facility, applicants shall:

- (1) notify the Regional government of the proposed site;
- (2) provide opportunity for Regional comment on non-safety aspects;
- (3) participate in Regional land use processes for non-nuclear site features.

(c) **Regional Input.** Regions may submit comments to NRC on:

- (1) local environmental conditions;
- (2) emergency response capability;
- (3) infrastructure adequacy;
- (4) community impacts.

(d) **No Regional Veto.** Regional opposition does not preclude federal
licensing if safety requirements are met.

(e) **Boundary Proximity.** Facilities proposed within 50 miles of a Regional
boundary shall also notify adjacent Regions.

### Section 12. Emergency Planning Zones

(a) **EPZ Definition.** Emergency Planning Zones (EPZs) for nuclear facilities
shall be determined by NRC based on safety analysis.

- (2) NRC shall coordinate inter-regional planning;
- (3) federal funding shall support multi-regional emergency preparedness.

(c) **Coordination Requirement.** Facilities with cross-boundary EPZs shall:

- (1) conduct joint exercises with all affected Regions;
- (2) maintain mutual aid agreements for emergency response;
- (3) harmonize notification and evacuation procedures.

(d) **Federal Backup.** If Regions fail to coordinate emergency planning,
FEMA may establish and fund unified planning.

### Section 13. Adjacent Region Rights

(a) Regions adjacent to (within 50 miles of) a nuclear facility have standing
to:

- (1) participate in NRC licensing proceedings;
- (2) receive emergency planning support;
- (3) access monitoring data.

(b) Adjacent Region concerns about safety are addressed through federal
licensing process, not Regional veto.

    Regional support;
- (3) consent-based siting shall be pursued for a reasonable period (minimum
    5 years).

(b) **Backup Siting.** If consent-based siting does not produce adequate
capacity:

- (1) DOE may propose sites based on technical suitability;
- (2) affected Regions may object through formal process;
- (3) objections shall be addressed through enhanced benefits or site
    modification;
- (4) final siting authority rests with federal government.

(c) **No Permanent Blockade.** Regions may not permanently prevent siting of
federally necessary waste facilities, but shall receive fair process and
compensation.

### Section 23. Host Community Benefits

(a) Communities hosting nuclear waste facilities shall receive:

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Regional NIMBY Blockade

**Attack:** A Region uses every available mechanism to prevent nuclear facility
or waste siting, effectively vetoing federal policy.

**Countermeasure:**

- Federal exclusive authority over licensing (Section 1(a))
- No Regional veto (Sections 11(d), 22(c))
- Backup siting authority (Section 22(b))

**Outcome:** Regions can participate and influence but not permanently block.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Federal Dumping

**Attack:** Federal government sites all nuclear facilities and waste in one
Region over its objection.

**Countermeasure:**

- Consent-based siting preference (Section 22(a))
- Enhanced process for non-consent sites (Section 22(b)(3))
- Host community benefits required (Section 23)
- Environmental border protection applies (Section 33(b))

**Outcome:** Federal authority is real but constrained by process and
compensation requirements.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Emergency Planning Failure

**Attack:** Regions refuse to cooperate on emergency planning, leaving gaps
in safety coverage.

**Countermeasure:**

- Federal backup authority for unified planning (Section 12(d))
- Cross-boundary coordination requirement (Section 12(c))
- Federal funding for multi-regional preparedness (Section 12(b)(3))

**Outcome:** Federal government can ensure emergency planning even without
Regional cooperation.

---

### Attack Vector 4: Transport Obstruction

**Attack:** A Region imposes routing requirements that make hazardous
materials transport impractical.

**Countermeasure:**

- Prohibition on impractical routing requirements (Section 3(c)(2))
- Federal route designation authority (Section 24(a))
- Preemption of conflicting Regional requirements (Section 32(c))

**Outcome:** Reasonable Regional preferences accommodated; obstruction
preempted.

---

### Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| Federal government abandons waste responsibility | Critical | Statutory requirement; political accountability |
| Consent-based siting fails nationwide | High | Backup authority exists but politically costly |
| Emergency response inadequate despite planning | Medium | Federal backup; mutual aid; exercises |
| NIMBY dynamics create perpetual conflict | Medium | Process and compensation reduce conflict |
