# National Infrastructure Investment and Coordination Act

This proposal establishes a national strategy and funding mechanisms for identifying, prioritizing, and developing multi-regional infrastructure projects, ensuring proactive planning and federal-Regional collaboration.

---

## Purpose

Establish a framework for National Infrastructure Investment and Coordination that:

- Proactively plans and funds multi-regional infrastructure projects of national significance.
- Ensures federal-Regional collaboration in infrastructure development and governance.
- Provides stable, long-term financing for critical infrastructure.
- Streamlines permitting processes while maintaining environmental and safety standards.
- Prevents individual Regions from blocking projects of national interest.

## Part II: National Infrastructure Bank

### Section 11. Establishment

(a) There is established a "National Infrastructure Bank" (the "Bank") as a wholly-owned government corporation.

(b) The Bank shall be capitalized by a one-time federal appropriation of $500 billion, with authority to issue bonds backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.

### Section 12. Governance

    - (2) Equity investments in public-private partnerships.
    - (3) Technical assistance grants for project development.

(b) Projects recommended by the National Resilience and Infrastructure Council shall receive priority consideration for funding.

(b) The Bank shall be capitalized by a one-time federal appropriation of $500 billion, with authority to issue bonds backed by the full faith and credit of the United States.

### Section 12. Governance

## Part III: Project Development and Implementation

### Section 21. Federal-Regional Cost-Sharing Framework

(a) The Council shall establish clear guidelines and formulas for federal and Regional contributions to multi-regional infrastructure projects.

(b) Federal contributions shall prioritize projects with significant national interest or spillover benefits, as determined by the Council.

(c) Regional contributions may include direct funding, land acquisition, or in-kind services.

### Section 22. Streamlined Permitting

(a) For projects designated as national priorities by the Council, a coordinated federal-Regional permitting process shall be established.

(b) Federal agencies shall establish a "one-stop shop" for environmental reviews and permitting, with clear timelines and inter-agency coordination.

(c) Regions shall cooperate in streamlining their permitting processes for national priority projects, provided federal environmental and safety standards are met or exceeded.

### Section 23. Inter-Regional Infrastructure Compacts

(a) Regions are encouraged to form "Inter-Regional Infrastructure Compacts" under the `Interregional Agency Compact Act` for the joint governance, maintenance, and operation of shared infrastructure assets.

(b) The Council shall develop model compact templates for various types of infrastructure.

(c) Federal funding from the Bank may prioritize projects developed under such compacts.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Political Obstruction of Projects

**Attack:** A Region or political faction attempts to block a nationally significant infrastructure project due to local opposition or partisan reasons, even if it has broad multi-regional benefits.

**Countermeasure:**

- **National Priority Designation:** The Council's designation of a project as a national priority (Section 3(a)(1)) provides a strong federal interest.
- **Streamlined Permitting (Section 22):** Reduces opportunities for local obstruction through bureaucratic delays.
- **Federal Eminent Domain:** Federal authority to acquire land for national projects, with just compensation, can override local resistance.
- **Mediation by Council (Section 3(a)(4)):** Provides a forum to resolve inter-regional disputes.

**Outcome:** While local opposition is expected, the federal framework provides mechanisms to ensure projects of national significance can proceed.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Funding Diversion or Politicization

**Attack:** A future administration attempts to divert funds from the National Infrastructure Bank for unrelated purposes or to politicize its lending decisions.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Independent Governance (Section 12(b)):** The Bank's Board of Directors operates independently of political interference.
- **Dedicated Capitalization (Section 11(b)):** Initial capitalization and bond authority are dedicated to infrastructure.
- **Council Recommendations (Section 13(b)):** Funding priority is given to projects recommended by the independent Council, based on objective criteria.
- **Transparency:** All lending decisions and project evaluations are publicly disclosed.

**Outcome:** The independent governance and objective criteria for funding make it difficult to divert funds or politicize lending without public scrutiny and potential legal challenge.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Regional Non-Cooperation

**Attack:** Regions refuse to cooperate on multi-regional projects, leading to fragmentation or project failure.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Council Mediation (Section 3(a)(4)):** The Council mediates disputes to foster cooperation.
- **Incentives for Compacts (Section 23(c)):** Federal funding prioritizes projects developed under inter-regional compacts.
- **Federal Backstop:** For projects of critical national interest, the federal government may proceed with direct implementation if regional cooperation fails, leveraging its eminent domain and regulatory authority.

**Outcome:** While cooperation is preferred, mechanisms exist to overcome regional non-cooperation for projects deemed essential to the national interest.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Long-term political will for sustained investment** | High | The Bank's bond authority provides some insulation, but ultimate political will for replenishment and new projects is always a factor. |
| **Environmental justice concerns in siting** | Medium | Council must explicitly incorporate environmental justice criteria into project selection and siting guidelines. |
| **Complexity of coordinating multiple federal and Regional agencies** | Medium | Continuous refinement of streamlined permitting processes; dedicated inter-agency task forces for large projects. |
| **Defining "national priority" objectively** | Medium | Council's criteria and transparent methodology are key; subject to public comment and judicial review. |
