# Transboundary Environmental Harm Prevention Act

This proposal establishes the statutory framework for the constitutional
environmental border protection provisions (Article I, Section 10), providing
detailed procedures for preventing pollution export, monitoring, enforcement,
and remediation.

---

## Constitutional Foundation

Article I, Section 10 of the Regional Federal Constitution establishes that:

> No jurisdiction may externalize environmental harms to other jurisdictions
> through pollution siting, emissions, discharges, or land use practices that
> cause harm across jurisdictional boundaries.

This Act implements these principles through specific procedures.

---

## Purpose

Establish environmental border protection that:

- prevents jurisdictions from exporting pollution to neighbors,
- provides clear standards for prohibited conduct,
- establishes monitoring and early warning systems,
- creates expedited enforcement mechanisms,
- ensures remediation and compensation for harm.

---

## Part I: Prohibited Actions

### Section 1. General Prohibition

(a) No Region, State, Territory, or Tribal Nation may externalize environmental
harms to other jurisdictions.

(b) **Externalize.** To externalize means to cause pollution, contamination,
or environmental damage that crosses jurisdictional boundaries or affects
resources shared with other jurisdictions.

### Section 2. Specific Prohibitions

(a) **Pollution Siting.** No jurisdiction may site polluting facilities within
fifty miles of a jurisdictional boundary with the intent or effect of exporting
pollution to neighboring jurisdictions.

(b) **Emissions and Discharges.** No jurisdiction may permit emissions,
discharges, or waste disposal that cause measurable harm to air quality, water
quality, or public health in other jurisdictions.

(c) **Hazardous Materials.** No jurisdiction may dispose of hazardous materials
in a manner that creates risk of migration to other jurisdictions.

(d) **Land Use Practices.** No jurisdiction may engage in land use practices
that cause significant flooding, erosion, or ecological damage in other
jurisdictions.

### Section 3. Buffer Zone

(a) **Default Distance.** The fifty-mile buffer zone in Section 2(a) applies
unless modified pursuant to this Section.

(b) **Mutual Agreement.** Affected jurisdictions may by mutual agreement
adjust the buffer zone distance for specific types of facilities or specific
locations.

(c) **Federal Regulation.** The Environmental Protection Agency may by
regulation adjust buffer zone distances based on scientific evidence of actual
pollution dispersion patterns for specific pollutants or facility types.

(d) **Expansion.** Buffer zones may be expanded beyond fifty miles where
scientific evidence demonstrates that pollution effects extend further.

(e) **Reduction.** Buffer zones may be reduced below fifty miles only where
scientific evidence demonstrates that pollution effects do not extend to the
reduced distance, and only for specific facility types with documented
containment capabilities.

### Section 4. Intent and Effect

(a) **Intent.** A jurisdiction acts with prohibited intent if it sites, permits,
or approves activities with knowledge that pollution will likely cross
boundaries.

(b) **Effect.** A jurisdiction causes prohibited effect if its activities
actually cause measurable transboundary pollution, regardless of intent.

(c) **Either Sufficient.** Either intent or effect is sufficient to establish
a violation; both are not required.

## Part II: Monitoring and Early Warning

### Section 11. EPA Monitoring Authority

(a) The Environmental Protection Agency shall maintain monitoring capacity at
jurisdictional boundaries for:

- (1) air quality (criteria pollutants, hazardous air pollutants),
- (2) water quality (surface water, groundwater where technologically feasible),
- (3) soil contamination migration,
- (4) noise and light pollution where significant.

(b) **Monitoring Stations.** EPA shall establish monitoring stations at
sufficient density to detect transboundary pollution and trace sources.

(c) **Real-Time Data.** Monitoring data shall be available in real-time to:

- (1) all affected jurisdictions,
- (2) the public through online portals,
- (3) researchers and scientists.

### Section 12. Investigation Authority

(a) Upon receiving a complaint or detecting potential transboundary pollution,
EPA shall have independent authority to:

- (1) investigate the source and extent of pollution,
- (2) enter facilities suspected of causing transboundary pollution
    (with appropriate legal process),
- (3) require production of records and testimony,
- (4) engage technical experts.

(b) **Timeline.** EPA shall initiate investigation within 72 hours of receiving
a credible complaint and shall issue preliminary findings within 30 days.

### Section 13. Early Warning

(a) EPA shall maintain an early warning system to alert potentially affected
jurisdictions of:

- (1) proposed facility sitings that may cause transboundary pollution,
- (2) permit applications for activities that may cause transboundary pollution,
- (3) detected increases in pollution that may indicate new transboundary
    sources.

(b) **Comment Opportunity.** Affected jurisdictions shall have opportunity to
comment on proposed activities that may cause transboundary pollution before
permits are issued.

---

## Part III: Enforcement

### Section 21. EPA Administrative Enforcement

(a) EPA shall have independent authority to:

- (1) issue citations for violations of this Act,
- (2) impose administrative penalties up to $50,000 per day of violation,
- (3) issue cease-and-desist orders for ongoing violations,
- (4) refer cases to the Department of Justice for civil or criminal
    prosecution.

(b) **Civil Penalties.** Civil penalties shall be sufficient to:

- (1) deter violations,
- (2) remove economic benefit of violation,
- (3) fund remediation and monitoring.

(c) **Criminal Penalties.** Willful or knowing violations that cause significant
harm may be prosecuted criminally under existing environmental statutes.

### Section 22. Affected Jurisdiction Remedies

(a) An affected jurisdiction may seek:

- (1) **Injunctive Relief.** Court orders halting harmful activities.
- (2) **Compensatory Damages.** Monetary compensation for documented harm,
    including costs of remediation, health impacts, and economic losses.
- (3) **Remediation Orders.** Court orders requiring cleanup or restoration.

(b) **Forum.** Actions may be filed in:

- (1) Regional courts of the affected jurisdiction,
- (2) Regional courts of the offending jurisdiction,
- (3) federal district court if jurisdictions are in different Regions.

(c) **Expedited Review.** Transboundary environmental cases shall be expedited,
with preliminary injunction hearings within 14 days and trial within 120 days.

### Section 23. Federal Enforcement

(a) In cases of ongoing or imminent transboundary environmental harm, the
federal government may:

- (1) order immediate cessation of harmful activities,
- (2) impose civil penalties up to $250,000 per day of violation,
    collectible through federal courts,

    *Note: Per Article X, Section 4 (Anti-Coercion Rule), equalization transfers may not be withheld as an enforcement mechanism.*
- (3) undertake emergency remediation with cost recovery from the responsible
    jurisdiction.

(b) **Emergency Remediation.** Federal emergency remediation is authorized
when:

- (1) transboundary harm is ongoing or imminent,
- (2) the responsible jurisdiction has failed to act, and
- (3) delay would cause irreversible harm.

(c) **Cost Recovery.** All costs of federal enforcement and remediation shall
be recovered from the responsible jurisdiction, including:

- (1) direct remediation costs,
- (2) monitoring costs,
- (3) administrative costs,
- (4) legal costs.

## Part IV: Remediation Standards

### Section 31. Cleanup Standards

(a) Remediation of transboundary pollution shall restore affected areas to:

- (1) pre-contamination conditions, or
- (2) applicable federal environmental standards,

whichever is more protective.

(b) **Natural Resource Damages.** In addition to cleanup, the responsible
jurisdiction shall compensate for:

- (1) lost use of natural resources during contamination period,
- (2) permanent impairment of natural resources,
- (3) ecological restoration costs.

### Section 32. Long-Term Monitoring

(a) Following remediation, the responsible jurisdiction shall fund long-term
monitoring to ensure:

- (1) contamination does not recur,
- (2) remediation measures remain effective,
- (3) affected communities remain informed.

(b) **Duration.** Long-term monitoring shall continue for at least 30 years or
until EPA certifies that monitoring is no longer necessary.

### Section 33. Compensation Fund

(a) There is established a Transboundary Environmental Harm Compensation Fund
to provide immediate relief to affected communities while enforcement
proceedings continue.

(b) **Funding.** The Fund shall be capitalized from:

- (1) civil penalties collected under this Act,
- (2) cost recovery from responsible jurisdictions,
- (3) congressional appropriation.

(c) **Reimbursement.** Fund disbursements shall be reimbursed from judgments
and settlements obtained from responsible jurisdictions.

---

## Part V: Relationship to Federal Law

### Section 41. Supplement, Not Displacement

(a) This Act supplements, and does not displace, federal environmental laws
establishing national minimum standards.

(b) **Applicable Laws.** Federal laws that continue to apply include:

- (1) Clean Air Act,
- (2) Clean Water Act,
- (3) Resource Conservation and Recovery Act,
- (4) Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
    (CERCLA/Superfund),
- (5) other applicable federal environmental statutes.

### Section 42. More Protective Standards

(a) Nothing in this Act shall prevent jurisdictions from establishing
environmental standards more protective than federal floors.

(b) **Limitation.** More protective standards may not discriminate against
interstate commerce or be applied pretextually to favor in-jurisdiction
economic interests.

### Section 43. Federal Preemption

(a) This Act does not preempt state or Regional environmental laws that provide
equal or greater protection.

(b) **Conflict.** In case of conflict between this Act and federal environmental
law, the more protective standard applies.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Border-Adjacent Siting

**Attack:** A jurisdiction sites a polluting facility at 51 miles from the
border, technically outside the buffer zone while still causing transboundary
pollution.

**Countermeasure:**

- Effect test catches actual transboundary pollution regardless of distance
    (Section 4(b))
- Buffer zone can be expanded based on scientific evidence (Section 3(d))
- EPA monitoring detects actual pollution regardless of source location
    (Section 11)

**Outcome:** Buffer zone is a presumption, not a safe harbor; actual pollution
effects trigger enforcement regardless of distance.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Permit Laundering

**Attack:** A jurisdiction grants permits to private entities for polluting
activities, then claims the jurisdiction itself is not responsible for private
conduct.

**Countermeasure:**

- "Permit emissions, discharges, or waste disposal" includes permitting private
    activities (Section 2(b))
- Jurisdiction responsibility for permitted activities
- Injunctive relief available against both jurisdiction and permittees

**Outcome:** Permitting polluting activities creates jurisdiction liability;
permits cannot launder responsibility.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Monitoring Evasion

**Attack:** A jurisdiction conducts polluting activities during periods when
monitoring is reduced or during conditions that disperse pollution beyond
monitoring stations.

**Countermeasure:**

- EPA monitoring is continuous, not periodic (Section 11(c))
- Source tracing capability (Section 11(b))
- Investigation authority upon complaint (Section 12)
- Affected jurisdiction monitoring supplements EPA

**Outcome:** Comprehensive monitoring and investigation authority make
systematic evasion difficult; intermittent violations still detectable.

---

### Attack Vector 4: Economic Retaliation Defense

**Attack:** A jurisdiction argues that enforcement would cause economic harm
to its industries and workers, and seeks to delay or reduce penalties.

**Countermeasure:**

- Economic benefit removal is explicit penalty criterion (Section 21(b)(2))
- Expedited review timelines prevent indefinite delay (Section 22(c))
- Emergency federal enforcement available (Section 23)
- Civil penalties create economic pressure (Section 23(a)(2))

**Outcome:** Economic arguments do not excuse violations; expedited enforcement
prevents delay tactics.

---

### Attack Vector 5: Dispute Over Scientific Evidence

**Attack:** A jurisdiction disputes EPA findings, claiming that transboundary
effects are not scientifically established or that its activities are not the
source.

**Countermeasure:**

- EPA monitoring provides baseline evidence (Section 11)
- Source tracing technology (Section 11(b))
- Burden of proof considerations in litigation
- Independent expert authority (Section 12(a)(4))

**Outcome:** Scientific disputes are resolved through evidence; source tracing
provides attribution; disputes do not suspend enforcement.

### Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|--------------|----------|------------|
| Groundwater monitoring limitations | Medium | Develop technology; surface water monitoring as proxy |
| Delayed detection of slow-onset harms | Medium | Long-term monitoring; epidemiological studies |
| Interstate air pollution complexity | Medium | EPA modeling; source tracing; regional cooperation |
| Cumulative effects from multiple sources | Medium | Comprehensive monitoring; joint enforcement |
