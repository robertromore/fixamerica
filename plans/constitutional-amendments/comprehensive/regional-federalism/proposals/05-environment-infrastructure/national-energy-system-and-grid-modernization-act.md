# National Energy System and Grid Modernization Act

This proposal establishes a federal-regional framework for managing the national energy grid, coordinating the transition to new energy sources, and ensuring energy reliability and affordability across all Regions.

---

## Purpose

Establish a framework for National Energy System and Grid Modernization that:

- Grants clear federal authority to set binding reliability and cybersecurity standards for the national electric grid.
- Creates a formal process for planning and siting inter-regional transmission infrastructure necessary for a modern energy system.
- Establishes a framework for coordinating the transition away from fossil fuels while supporting affected communities and workers.
- Ensures a reliable, affordable, and clean energy system for the entire nation.

---

## Part I: Grid Reliability and Operations

### Section 1. Federal Authority for Grid Reliability

(a) The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) shall have primary and exclusive authority to establish and enforce binding standards for the reliability and security of the bulk power system across all Regions.

(b) These standards shall apply to all owners, operators, and users of the bulk power system.

### Section 2. Scope of Federal Standards

(a) Federal standards shall include, but not be limited to:
    - (1) **Resource Adequacy:** Minimum requirements for generation capacity and energy reserves to meet projected demand.
    - (2) **Cybersecurity:** Mandatory cybersecurity protocols for all grid control systems, consistent with the `National Cybersecurity and Critical Digital Infrastructure Protection Act`.
    - (3) **Interoperability:** Technical standards to ensure seamless operation and energy transfer between Regional grids.
    - (4) **Weatherization:** Minimum standards for the weatherization of generation and transmission facilities against extreme weather events.

### Section 3. Regional Compliance and Enforcement

(a) Regional utility commissions and grid operators are responsible for implementing and enforcing federal reliability standards within their boundaries.

(b) FERC shall have authority to conduct audits and impose penalties on any entity, including Regional operators, for non-compliance with federal standards.

## Part II: Inter-Regional Transmission Planning and Siting

### Section 11. National Transmission Plan

(a) The National Resilience and Infrastructure Council, established by the `National Infrastructure Investment and Coordination Act`, shall, in consultation with FERC, develop and update a biennial National Transmission Plan.

(b) The Plan shall identify high-priority national transmission corridors required to:
    - (1) Connect renewable energy generation zones to population centers.
    - (2) Enhance grid resilience and reduce congestion.
    - (3) Support the national energy transition goals.

### Section 12. Coordinated Siting Process

(a) For transmission projects within a high-priority national corridor, FERC shall convene a joint federal-regional process to review project siting.

(b) This process shall provide a single, consolidated environmental review and permitting timeline.

### Section 13. Federal Backstop Siting Authority

(a) If a Regional authority denies a permit for a transmission project within a high-priority national corridor, the project sponsor may appeal to FERC.

(b) FERC may override the Regional denial and issue a federal permit if it finds that:
    - (1) The project is necessary to fulfill the goals of the National Transmission Plan; and
    - (2) The Regional denial was not based on substantial evidence of a significant, unmitigable threat to local public health or safety.

(c) This backstop authority shall be used as a last resort to prevent individual Regions from blocking infrastructure of critical national importance.

---

## Part III: Energy Transition Coordination

### Section 21. Coordinated Transition Planning

(a) The National Resilience and Infrastructure Council shall develop a framework to coordinate the planned retirement of fossil fuel generation facilities with the deployment of new clean energy, storage, and transmission capacity.

(b) The framework shall aim to ensure grid reliability is maintained at all stages of the transition.

### Section 22. Just Transition Fund

(a) There is established in the Treasury a "Just Transition Fund" to support communities and workers affected by the closure of fossil fuel facilities.

(b) The Fund shall be financed by a portion of revenues from any federal carbon pricing mechanism, or by direct appropriation.

(c) **Eligible Uses.** Grants from the Fund shall be provided to affected communities for:
    - (1) Workforce retraining and placement services.
    - (2) Economic diversification and development initiatives.
    - (3) Environmental remediation of retired facility sites.
    - (4) Support for local government budgets impacted by lost tax revenue.

---

## Part IV: Governance

### Section 31. Energy Systems Council

(a) There is established an "Energy Systems Council" as a permanent subcommittee of the National Resilience and Infrastructure Council.

(b) **Composition.** The Council shall be composed of:
    - (1) The Secretary of Energy (Chair).
    - (2) The Chair of FERC.
    - (3) One representative from each Regional utility commission or equivalent body.
    - (4) Non-voting members from the utility industry, renewable energy sector, and consumer advocacy groups.

(c) **Functions.** The Council shall advise the National Resilience and Infrastructure Council on the National Transmission Plan, coordinate on transition planning, and mediate disputes between Regions on energy matters.

## Hostile Reinterpretation Stress Test

### Attack Vector 1: Regional Blockade of Transmission

**Attack:** A Region, citing "not in my backyard" (NIMBY) opposition, refuses to permit a critical national transmission line needed to move renewable energy from another Region.

**Countermeasure:**

- **National Transmission Plan (Section 11):** Establishes the national importance of the project.
- **Federal Backstop Siting Authority (Section 13):** Allows FERC to override a Regional denial that is not based on legitimate, unmitigable health or safety grounds.

**Outcome:** While Regions have the first say on siting, they cannot unilaterally veto infrastructure that is critical for the entire nation's energy security and transition.

---

### Attack Vector 2: Federal Negligence on Reliability

**Attack:** A captured or ideologically motivated FERC sets weak reliability or cybersecurity standards, exposing the national grid to risk.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Regional Authority to Exceed Floors:** The framework allows Regions to implement stricter standards for infrastructure within their own borders.
- **Council Oversight:** The Energy Systems Council, with its strong Regional representation, can publicly challenge weak federal standards and advocate for stronger ones.
- **Judicial Review:** FERC rulemaking is subject to judicial review to ensure it is not "arbitrary and capricious."

**Outcome:** While federal negligence is a risk, Regions are not powerless. They can implement stronger local standards and use the Council and courts to challenge inadequate federal oversight.

---

### Attack Vector 3: Underfunding of "Just Transition"

**Attack:** Congress fails to appropriate funds for the Just Transition Fund, leaving communities affected by plant closures without support and creating intense political opposition to the energy transition.

**Countermeasure:**

- **Dedicated Funding Stream (Section 22(b)):** The proposal links the Fund to potential carbon pricing revenues, which would create a dedicated funding stream independent of annual appropriations.
- **Political Coalition:** The framework creates a political coalition of labor unions, environmental groups, and local governments in affected communities with a strong incentive to advocate for robust funding.

**Outcome:** While direct appropriations are always subject to political winds, linking the fund to a dedicated revenue source provides greater stability.

## Residual Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Severity | Mitigation |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Defining "significant, unmitigable threat" for siting override** | Medium | FERC rulemaking with public comment; judicial precedent will refine over time. |
| **Cost allocation for inter-regional transmission lines** | High | Requires clear and fair cost allocation formulas developed by FERC, which will be highly contentious. |
| **Pace of technological change (e.g., storage, fusion)** | High | The Act focuses on grid management principles, not specific technologies, allowing for adaptation. |
| **Local opposition to all forms of energy infrastructure** | High | The framework provides procedural tools, but cannot eliminate deep-seated local opposition. |
