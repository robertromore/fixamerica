# Interregional Shared Services Authority Act

This proposal creates an optional, opt-in shared services authority to provide
administrative functions for interregional agencies and participating Regions.
It is a back-office compact, not a policy-making body, and does not create a
new branch of government.

---

## Constitutional Foundation

Article I, Section 5 of the Regional Federal Constitution authorizes
inter-regional compacts. This Act operates under that authority and is designed
to be used alongside the [Interregional Agency Compact Act](interregional-agency-compact-act.md)
and the [Inter-Regional Joint Authority: Constitutional Default Template](interregional-joint-authority-template.md).

---

## Purpose

Enable participating Regions to:

- reduce administrative duplication across interregional agencies,
- achieve scale efficiencies in procurement, finance, and IT,
- improve audit, security, and compliance standards,
- and preserve Regional sovereignty through opt-in governance.

---

## Part I: Authorization and Scope

### Section 1. Formation and Participation

(a) Two or more Regions may form an Interregional Shared Services Authority
(the "Authority") by compact.

(b) The compact takes effect only after public ratification in each
participating Region under that Region's authorized method for inter-regional
agreements.

(c) Interregional agencies and Regional departments may opt in to Authority
services by executing service-level agreements consistent with the compact.

---

### Section 2. Permissible Services

The Authority may provide administrative services including:

- human resources, payroll, and benefits administration,
- procurement and contract management support,
- financial accounting, budgeting tools, and reporting systems,
- audit preparation and compliance support,
- records management and archival services,
- shared IT infrastructure, hosting, and cybersecurity services,
- training, certification, and operational standards,
- risk management, insurance pooling, and continuity planning.

---

### Section 3. Prohibited Functions

The Authority may not:

- issue binding regulations or policy directives,
- adjudicate disputes or exercise judicial authority,
- conduct law enforcement or coercive inspections,
- impose taxes or fees beyond agreed service charges,
- override or preempt participating Region law,
- expand its own powers without amended compact ratification by all
  participating Regions.

---

## Part II: Governance and Accountability

### Section 4. Governance Defaults

(a) The Authority shall be governed by a board with equal representation per
participating Region.

(b) Each participating Region may appoint one voting member and one alternate.

(c) Participating interregional agencies may form a non-voting advisory council
to propose service priorities and evaluate performance.

(d) Voting rules, quorum, and transparency requirements follow Article I,
Section 5A defaults unless the compact explicitly provides otherwise.

(e) If Article I, Section 5A has not been adopted, the compact shall specify
governance procedures addressing voting rules, quorum, and transparency. Failure
to specify any element renders the corresponding provisions of the
[Inter-Regional Joint Authority: Constitutional Default Template](interregional-joint-authority-template.md)
applicable to that element as statutory defaults.

(f) A compact may deviate from Section 5A defaults only by explicit provision
with public ratification. Deviations may not weaken transparency, audit, exit,
or anti-capture protections below Section 5A standards or the standards set in
this Act.

---

### Section 5. Service Boundaries and Firewalls

(a) The Authority shall maintain organizational separation from policy-making
agencies to prevent administrative control from influencing policy decisions.

(b) No Authority officer may serve simultaneously in a leadership role within
an interregional agency receiving services, except as a non-voting liaison.

---

### Section 5A. Personnel Protections

(a) Authority employees are employees of the Authority, not of any individual
Region or client agency.

(b) Authority employees shall have:

- (1) merit-based hiring and promotion,
- (2) protection from political retaliation,
- (3) due process before termination, and
- (4) portability of pension credits to participating Regions.

(c) Positions may not be allocated based on political affiliation or as
patronage appointments.

(d) Employees who report waste, fraud, abuse, or violations of law are protected
from retaliation under the same standards as federal whistleblower protections.

(e) The protections in subsections (b) through (d) are mandatory minimums. The
compact may provide additional procedural protections or implementation details
consistent with Section 13 of the
[Interregional Agency Compact Act](interregional-agency-compact-act.md), but may
not weaken protections below the standards set in this Section.

---

## Part III: Finance and Cost Allocation

### Section 6. Fee-for-Service Model

(a) The Authority shall operate on a fee-for-service basis, charging only for
services actually used.

(b) Fees must be approved by the governing board and ratified by participating
Regions through their legislative processes or the same ratification method
used to approve the compact.

(c) The compact shall set an administrative overhead cap; absent agreement, the
default cap is 12% of annual operating costs.

---

### Section 7. Procurement Integrity

(a) The Authority must follow transparent procurement rules with competitive
bidding for contracts exceeding thresholds set in the compact.

(b) Conflicts of interest are prohibited for board members and senior staff.

---

### Section 7A. Anti-Capture Provisions

(a) Governing Board members may not:

- (1) have financial interests in entities contracting with the Authority,
- (2) be employed by or receive compensation from such entities, or
- (3) vote on matters in which they have a personal financial interest.

(b) Governing Board members and senior staff may not lobby the Authority for 24
months after leaving their positions.

(c) Authority funds may not be used for political contributions, issue advocacy,
or lobbying.

(d) Regions may not make payments to other Regions outside the fee structure to
influence Authority decisions.

(e) Anti-capture provisions follow Section 16 of the
[Interregional Agency Compact Act](interregional-agency-compact-act.md). The
compact may strengthen but not weaken these protections.

---

## Part IV: Data Governance and Security

### Section 8. Data Controls

(a) Participating Regions and agencies retain ownership of their data.

(b) The Authority may access data only to the extent necessary to deliver
contracted services.

(c) Data must be encrypted in transit and at rest; access logs and audit trails
are mandatory.

(d) Upon withdrawal, data must be returned or destroyed under mutually agreed
procedures.

---

## Part V: Membership, Exit, and Transition

### Section 9. Opt-In and Service Levels

(a) Participation is voluntary and may be limited to specific service modules.

(b) Service-level agreements must define scope, cost, performance standards,
and termination procedures.

---

### Section 10. Withdrawal

(a) Any participating Region may withdraw with 12 months written notice. This
shorter notice period (compared to 18 months for policy-making interregional
agencies under the [Interregional Agency Compact Act](interregional-agency-compact-act.md))
reflects the administrative, non-policy nature of Authority services.

(b) Withdrawal does not terminate service-level agreements already executed
unless those agreements provide otherwise.

(c) The Authority may not use withdrawal to deny access to data or records
needed for continuity of operations.

---

## Part VI: Oversight and Review

### Section 11. Audit and Reporting

(a) The Authority shall undergo annual financial audit by an independent auditor
selected by unanimous consent of participating Regions. If unanimous consent
cannot be reached within 60 days of the selection deadline, the Allocation
Review Board shall appoint the auditor from a list of qualified firms.

(b) Audit reports shall be published within 120 days of fiscal year end.

(c) Auditor selection shall rotate among qualified firms; no firm may serve more
than three consecutive years.

(d) Audit reports shall be transmitted to each participating Regional
Legislature and made available to the public.

(e) The Authority shall publish quarterly performance reports and an annual
impact report covering cost savings, service quality, and compliance.

---

### Section 12. Sunset and Reauthorization

(a) The Authority shall be subject to periodic sunset review at intervals not
exceeding ten years.

(b) Each participating Region shall vote on continuation. Regions that ratify
continuation remain participants; Regions that do not ratify are treated as
having given withdrawal notice effective on the sunset date.

(c) The Authority continues with the Regions that ratify continuation, provided
at least two Regions ratify.

(d) If fewer than two Regions ratify continuation, dissolution procedures under
Section 10A of the [Interregional Agency Compact Act](interregional-agency-compact-act.md)
apply by analogy.

---

### Section 13. Dispute Resolution

Disputes are resolved under the dispute resolution process in the
[Interregional Agency Compact Act](interregional-agency-compact-act.md),
Section 11A.

---

## Part VII: Example Use Cases (Non-Binding)

- Shared payroll and benefits administration for interregional agencies
- Unified procurement for emergency supplies and infrastructure
- Standardized cybersecurity operations and incident response
- Shared licensing and credential verification systems

---

## Implementation Note

This Act is designed to be statutory, not constitutional. It creates an
optional administrative layer to reduce duplication without consolidating
policy authority or limiting Regional autonomy.
