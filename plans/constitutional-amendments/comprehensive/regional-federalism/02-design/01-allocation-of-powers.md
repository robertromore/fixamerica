# Allocation of Powers Across Levels

## A Comprehensive Design Document for a Regional Federal System

> **Purpose of this document:**
> To define, justify, and operationalize the allocation of governmental powers across **federal, regional, state, and local** levels in a regional federal system. This document explains *why* powers are assigned where they are, *how* conflicts are resolved, and *how power creep is structurally prevented*.

This is the **second core pillar** of the regional federal system (the first being the [regional structure itself](../01-foundation/01-core-idea.md)).
If regions answer *where governance happens*, allocation of powers answers *what happens where-and why*.

## 1. Executive Overview

The allocation of powers is the **most failure-prone element** of any federal system.

Most democratic breakdowns do not occur because powers are *misallocated once*, but because:

- allocation is ambiguous,
- enforcement is discretionary,
- and power migrates silently upward during crises.

This system allocates powers across four levels with three objectives:

1. **Match authority to scale**
2. **Prevent silent power creep**
3. **Preserve democratic legitimacy at every level**

The guiding idea is simple but strict:

> **Each power must live at the lowest level capable of exercising it effectively,
> and must not be exercised elsewhere without explicit constitutional authorization.**

---

## 2. The Allocation Problem in the Current System

The existing U.S. allocation model fails in predictable ways:

### 2.1 Federal overreach through necessity

When states cannot coordinate:

- housing shortages
- labor standards
- infrastructure
- public health

...the federal government fills the vacuum, often via:

- conditional funding
- administrative rulemaking
- emergency powers
- judicial interpretation

This creates *de facto* national governance without *de jure* authorization.

---

### 2.2 State undercapacity

States are often:

- too small to plan infrastructure rationally
- too competitive to cooperate voluntarily
- too fiscally constrained to absorb shocks

This leads to:

- race-to-the-bottom incentives
- fragmented regulation
- symbolic autonomy without real power

---

### 2.3 Courts as allocators of last resort

When allocation is unclear, courts become:

- policy harmonizers
- national standard-setters
- arbiters of disputes they were never meant to decide

This undermines both democracy and judicial legitimacy.

---

## 3. First Principles for Power Allocation

Any coherent allocation system must satisfy the following principles:

### 3.1 Scale principle

A power belongs at the level where:

- its effects are primarily felt
- coordination costs are minimized
- accountability is intelligible

---

### 3.2 Spillover principle

If exercising a power in one jurisdiction:

- substantially affects others,
- the power must be exercised at a higher level *or* coordinated through binding compacts.

---

### 3.3 Subsidiarity with teeth

Subsidiarity is meaningless without enforcement.

Lower levels retain authority **unless**:

- they cannot realistically exercise it,
- or they violate constitutional floors.

---

### 3.4 Non-concurrency by default

Concurrent powers are dangerous.

Unless explicitly authorized:

- powers are exclusive to one level,
- not shared ambiguously.

---

## 4. The Four-Level Governance Model

| Level | Core Function |
|-------|---------------|
| Federal | Unity, defense, rights floors, national systems |
| Regional | Coordination, spillovers, shared infrastructure |
| State | Cultural variation, civil law, education, policing |
| Local | Service delivery, land use, community needs |

Each level is **constitutionally necessary**, but none is supreme in all domains.

---

## 5. Federal Powers: Narrow, Strong, and Enumerated

### 5.1 Core federal domains

Federal authority is limited to powers that require:

- uniformity,
- national legitimacy,
- or international standing.

**Enumerated federal powers include** ([Article II, Section 1](constitution/00-index.md)):

- national defense and armed forces
- foreign affairs and treaties
- currency and monetary policy
- immigration and citizenship
- maintenance of a national common market
- enforcement of constitutional rights floors
- national benefits floor
- emergency powers (strictly limited)

---

### 5.2 Federal powers as *floors*

Federal authority sets **minimum standards**, not comprehensive regimes.

Examples:

- labor rights minimums
- environmental baselines
- voting access protections
- civil liberties guarantees

Federal law should be interpreted as:

> "No jurisdiction may fall below this,"

not

> "No jurisdiction may go beyond this."

---

### 5.3 What the federal government explicitly does *not* do

Absent explicit authorization, the federal government does **not**:

- micromanage housing policy
- harmonize zoning
- impose uniform healthcare systems
- dictate education curricula
- regulate local land use

These are **regional or state matters**.

---

## 6. Regional Powers: Coordination, Scale, and Spillovers

Regions are the **workhorses** of modern governance.

### 6.1 Core regional competencies

Regions govern domains that:

- cross state borders,
- require harmonized standards,
- but do not require national uniformity.

**Key regional powers include** ([Article II, Section 2](constitution/00-index.md)):

- inter-state infrastructure and transportation corridors
- housing coordination and supply targets
- regional labor standards above federal floors
- energy generation and transmission planning
- public health coordination
- environmental regulation above federal floors
- regional economic development (with anti-dumping rules)

---

### 6.2 Why these powers do not belong federally

National uniformity in these domains would:

- ignore cost-of-living variation
- provoke legitimacy crises
- force courts to arbitrate policy
- increase backlash and noncompliance

Regions can tailor policy while preserving market unity.

---

### 6.3 Why these powers cannot remain at the state level

States acting alone create:

- underbuilt housing
- infrastructure misalignment
- grid fragility
- labor arbitrage
- public health chaos

Regions replace *voluntary cooperation* with **democratic coordination**.

---

## 7. State Powers: Proximity, Culture, and Local Legitimacy

States retain powers where:

- cultural preferences legitimately diverge,
- proximity matters,
- and spillovers are limited.

### 7.1 Core state domains

States retain authority over ([Article II, Section 3](constitution/00-index.md)):

- education
- criminal and civil law
- policing structure
- land use frameworks
- local government law

---

### 7.2 States as democratic buffers

States:

- reflect local identity
- experiment culturally
- provide political voice closer to the citizen

They remain essential for legitimacy-even if they are no longer isolated sovereigns.

---

## 8. Local Powers: Immediacy and Service Delivery

Local governments handle:

- zoning implementation
- utilities
- schools administration
- policing execution
- community services

Local authority is protected **within** state and regional frameworks.

Regions coordinate; locals implement.

---

## 9. Floors vs Ceilings: The Central Interpretive Rule

This is the most important rule in the entire allocation system ([Article III](constitution/00-index.md); [Article XV, Section 2](constitution/00-index.md)).

### 9.1 Floors

A floor:

- establishes a minimum protection
- prevents abuse
- preserves dignity

### 9.2 Ceilings

A ceiling:

- freezes policy
- centralizes authority
- eliminates experimentation

### 9.3 Interpretive mandate

Courts must presume:

- federal standards are floors,
- regional standards may exceed them,
- states may exceed both unless prohibited.

Any interpretation that converts a floor into a ceiling must be explicitly justified.

---

## 10. Preventing Power Creep at Every Level

### 10.1 Federal creep prevention

- enumerated powers supremacy
- no unfunded mandates
- automatic sunset of emergency powers
- no conditional funding coercion
- judicial enforcement of boundaries

---

### 10.2 Regional creep prevention

- enumerated regional powers
- prohibition on internal trade barriers
- democracy-floor enforcement
- internal minority protections
- judicial review limited to process

---

### 10.3 State creep prevention

- regional coordination supremacy in spillover domains
- federal rights enforcement
- non-nullification rule

---

## 11. Resolving Conflicts Between Levels

### 11.1 Decision hierarchy

1. Constitution
2. Federal floors
3. Regional standards
4. State law
5. Local law

---

### 11.2 Types of conflicts

| Conflict Type | Resolution |
|---------------|------------|
| Federal vs Region | Floor test + enumerated powers |
| Region vs State | Spillover test |
| State vs Local | State constitutional law |
| Region vs Region | Federal common market enforcement |

---

### 11.3 Judicial role

Courts:

- enforce boundaries
- protect democratic process
- prevent coercion

Courts do *not*:

- select optimal policy
- harmonize outcomes
- impose uniformity

---

## 12. Fiscal Authority and Power Alignment

### 12.1 Independent taxation

Each level must have:

- its own revenue sources
- aligned with its responsibilities

### 12.2 No unfunded mandates

Authority without revenue is domination.

Mandates without funding are unconstitutional by default.

---

## 13. Emergency Powers and Temporary Centralization

### 13.1 Emergency principle

Emergencies justify:

- temporary centralization
- limited suspension of normal allocation

They do *not* justify:

- permanent power shifts
- executive unilateralism

### 13.2 Structural safeguards

- automatic expiration
- multi-level reauthorization
- procedural judicial review
- restoration mandate

---

## 14. Common Objections and Design Responses

### "This is too complex."

Modern governance already is.
This system **clarifies complexity** instead of hiding it.

---

### "This weakens the federal government."

It narrows it-but strengthens legitimacy and compliance.

---

### "Regions will dominate states."

Only if states lack enumerated protections.
This design preserves state authority where proximity matters.

---

## 15. Minimal vs Maximal Allocation Models

### Minimal model

- regions coordinate infrastructure, energy, public health
- federal retains strong floor-setting role
- states retain broad discretion

### Maximal model

- regions govern labor markets, housing coordination, climate adaptation
- federal strictly limited to floors and national systems
- states focus on culture, law, and implementation

---

## 16. Summary: What Proper Allocation Achieves

A well-allocated system:

- reduces national overload
- improves coordination
- limits judicial policymaking
- restores democratic legitimacy
- slows authoritarian capture
- keeps disagreement survivable

### Final principle

> **Power should live where it can be exercised responsibly,
> removed where it becomes coercive,
> and constrained wherever it accumulates silently.**

That is the logic of allocation in a regional federal system.
