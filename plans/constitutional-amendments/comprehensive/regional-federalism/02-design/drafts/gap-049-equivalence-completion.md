## Status: FINAL (v3)

**Resolves:** Gap 49 (House Majoritarianism and the Consensus Floor Problem) — completion of partially integrated proposal

**Severity:** Medium

**Date:** 2026-02-02

**Revision:** v3 — incorporates findings from two rounds of external review. See [Round 1 Convergence](#3-convergence-analysis-v1--v2) and [Round 2 Convergence](#10-round-2-review-and-v2--v3-changes) for change logs.

## 1. Problem Statement

Gap 49 proposed a three-part solution to prevent mega-Region tyranny through the House: (1) 60% consensus rule for domain-affecting legislation, (2) outcome-based equivalence shield, and (3) mandatory pre-legislative ARB certification. Parts 1 and 3 are fully integrated (Art II §5(c) and §5(d)(1)-(12)). Part 2 is partially integrated (Art II §6(a)-(c)) but missing three subsections:

| Proposed | Purpose | Status |
|----------|---------|--------|
| §6(a) Equivalence Petition | Filing mechanism | Integrated |
| §6(b) Outcome Metrics | Measurement standards | Integrated |
| §6(c) Provisional Compliance | Interim implementation | Integrated |
| §6(d) Determination Timeline | ARB decision deadline | **Missing** |
| §6(e) Renewal and Review | Periodic re-verification | **Missing** |
| §6(f) No Race to Bottom | Anti-deregulation safeguard | **Missing** |

### Why These Omissions Matter

**Without §6(d) — Determination Timeline:**
The ARB has no deadline to rule on equivalence petitions. Under §6(c), Regions implement alternatives provisionally during pendency. Without a deadline, a petition can remain "pending" indefinitely — the Region operates its alternative permanently with no final determination. A captured ARB could also rush to deny petitions without adequate review. Both failure modes undermine the equivalence mechanism.

**Without §6(e) — Renewal and Review:**
Granted exemptions persist permanently without re-verification. A Region could demonstrate equivalent outcomes in Year 1, then degrade its alternative policy for years with no accountability. The exemption persists even as actual outcomes diverge materially from National Floor standards.

**Without §6(f) — No Race to Bottom:**
The equivalence mechanism could be weaponized as a deregulation loophole. Regions could claim "alternative means" while actually providing lesser protections, arguing their approach achieves a "different but valid" interpretation of outcomes. Without explicit guardrails, "equivalence" becomes a euphemism for non-compliance.

---

## 2. What Already Exists

### Article II, Section 6(a)-(c)

- **(a)** Equivalence petition mechanism with "clear and convincing evidence" standard
- **(b)** Outcome metrics: Congress specifies; ARB fills gaps based on legislative purpose
- **(c)** Provisional compliance: implementation during pendency with good-faith bond/escrow/monitoring

### Related Provisions

- **Art II §5(d)** — Pre-legislative domain certification with 30-day deadline, anti-bottleneck provisions, mandatory spending for certification staff
- **Art II §5(c)** — 60% supermajority for domain-affecting legislation
- **Art II §4** — Concurrent authority framework with spillover certification and 10-year sunset
- **Art II §4(h)-(k)** — Constitutional labor and safety minimums (exempt from variance/sunset per §4(k)(1))
- **Art II §7** — ARB composition, authority, independence

## 3. Convergence Analysis (v1 → v2)

### Review Summary

| Finding | R1 | R2 | v2 Resolution |
|---------|----|----|---------------|
| Auto-approval on timeout | HIGH: gameable via deliberate delay; converts inaction to 5-year final exemption | Endorses as correct bias against federal obstruction | Accept R1: timeout yields provisional status + judicial mandamus, not final exemption |
| Asymmetry with §5(d)(7) | HIGH: inconsistent that §6 timeout = approval but §5(d) timeout = no domain impact | Not addressed | Partially resolved: removing auto-final reduces asymmetry; remaining difference justified by distinct contexts (pre-legislative screening vs. post-petition adjudication) |
| Timeline gaming (data drag) | MEDIUM: no tolling for Region non-cooperation; Region can withhold data until day 270 | Not addressed | Accept R1: add tolling for Region non-cooperation + penalty for deliberate delay |
| 90% threshold too blunt | MEDIUM: health/environment/labor may need different thresholds | Not addressed | Accept R1: domain-sensitive standard with Board discretion bounded 85-95%, default 90% |
| Exogenous cause exception | MEDIUM: too broad without Board certification; potential blanket excuse | Not addressed | Accept R1: require Board certification + 2-year time limit on exclusion |
| Private enforcement standing | MEDIUM: no standing limits or exhaustion requirement; litigation flooding risk | Not addressed | Accept R1: enumerate standing categories + require administrative exhaustion |
| §4(k)(1) cross-reference | LOW: should cite permanence provision explicitly | Notes §6(f)(6) "particularly vital" | Accept R1: fix cross-ref to cite §4(k)(1) |

### Additional Items Accepted from R1

- **Good-cause extension**: Bounded 90-day extension for complex petitions (new §6(d)(6))
- **Non-cooperation penalty**: Disqualification from expedited track + additional bond (new §6(d)(7))
- **Initial-grant stacking assessment**: Cumulative impact assessed at grant, not only renewal (revised §6(f)(5))

### Disagreement Resolution: Auto-Approval Default

R2 endorsed the v1 auto-approval as "correctly bias[ing] the system against federal obstruction." R1 flagged it as gameable — a deliberately understaffed or captured ARB could convert inaction into 5-year final exemptions. Both concerns are valid:

- **R2's principle** (protect Regions from institutional obstruction) is sound and consistent with the equivalence mechanism's purpose.
- **R1's gaming vector** (inaction → final exemption without any substantive review) is real and exploitable.

**v2 resolution**: Preserve the pro-Region default by keeping provisional approval on timeout (Region continues operating its alternative), but remove the auto-finalization. Instead, provide judicial mandamus as the enforcement mechanism to compel Board action. This preserves Region protection without creating a path to unreviewed final exemptions.

### R1 Additional Design Questions

| Question | v2 Disposition |
|----------|----------------|
| Should ARB get a good-cause extension? | Yes: §6(d)(6) adds 90-day bounded extension, one per petition, published rationale |
| Renewal require all 5 years or recent 2-year window? | Retained as review question; v2 keeps "five years of outcome data" but reviewers should weigh whether recent-window weighting is better |
| Stacking assessed at initial grant too? | Yes: §6(f)(5)(i) now covers initial grant and renewal |

### R1 Additional Gaming Vectors (G14-G16)

All three vectors identified by R1 are addressed in v2 (see Section 6 below).

---

## 4. Proposed Constitutional Text

The following subsections complete Article II, Section 6. They are inserted after §6(c)(4) and before §6-A.

---

**(d) Board Determination Timeline.**

- (1) The Allocation Review Board shall issue a final determination on any Equivalence Petition within two hundred seventy (270) days of filing.
- (2) The Board shall publish a preliminary assessment within one hundred twenty (120) days, including:
    - (i) identification of the outcome metrics under subsection (b) to be applied;
    - (ii) the data sources and measurement methodology to be used;
    - (iii) any additional information required from the petitioning Region.
- (3) The petitioning Region shall have sixty (60) days from the preliminary assessment to submit supplemental evidence. If the Region fails to submit information identified as required under paragraph (2)(iii) within this period:
    - (i) the two hundred seventy (270) day determination deadline is tolled until the Region provides the required information;
    - (ii) the Board shall notify the Region that the deadline has been tolled and specify the outstanding information;
    - (iii) tolling under this paragraph does not affect the Region's provisional compliance status under subsection (c).
- (4) If the Board fails to issue a final determination within two hundred seventy (270) days (as adjusted by any tolling under paragraph (3) or extension under paragraph (6)):
    - (i) the petition shall be deemed provisionally approved;
    - (ii) provisional approval continues until the Board issues a final determination;
    - (iii) the Board shall issue a final determination within one hundred eighty (180) additional days of provisional approval; if the Board fails to do so, the petitioning Region or any party with standing under subsection (f)(7)(i) may seek a writ of mandamus in federal court to compel a determination within sixty (60) days of the court's order;
    - (iv) if no party seeks mandamus within ninety (90) days after expiration of the one hundred eighty (180) day period under clause (iii), provisional approval is suspended and the Region shall achieve compliance with the National Floor within one hundred eighty (180) days;
    - (v) a pattern of failing to meet the two hundred seventy (270) day deadline on three or more petitions within any twelve-month period triggers the staffing and capacity requirements of Section 5(d)(9)-(10), applied to equivalence determination staff.
- (5) **Expedited Determinations.** The Board shall complete determinations within ninety (90) days for:
    - (i) renewal petitions under subsection (e) where the Region's prior performance data demonstrates sustained equivalence;
    - (ii) petitions substantially similar to previously approved exemptions in other Regions;
    - (iii) petitions during the provisional compliance period of a National Floor's first year of implementation, where compliance costs are most acute.
- (6) **Good Cause Extension.** The Board may extend the two hundred seventy (270) day deadline by up to ninety (90) additional days upon a published finding that the petition presents novel policy questions, requires data collection not reasonably available within the standard timeline, or involves technical complexity warranting additional expert review. The Board may grant only one extension per petition.
- (7) **Non-Cooperation Consequences.** If the Board determines that a Region's failure to provide timely information or data under paragraph (3) was not justified by good cause:
    - (i) the Region shall not be eligible for expedited determinations under paragraph (5) for a period of three (3) years;
    - (ii) the Board may require the Region to post additional bond under subsection (c)(2) for any pending or future petitions;
    - (iii) the period of non-cooperation shall not count toward the determination deadline under paragraph (1).

---

**(e) Renewal and Review.**

- (1) **Duration.** Equivalence Exemptions shall be valid for five (5) years from the date of final determination.
- (2) **Renewal.** A Region may petition for renewal no earlier than twelve (12) months and no later than six (6) months before expiration. The renewal petition shall include five years of outcome data demonstrating continued equivalent or superior outcomes. The Board shall apply the same "clear and convincing evidence" standard as for initial petitions.
- (3) **Continuous Monitoring.** During the exemption period:
    - (i) the Region shall submit annual outcome reports to the Board using the metrics established under subsection (b);
    - (ii) the Board shall publish an annual equivalence assessment comparing Regional outcomes to National Floor benchmarks;
    - (iii) annual reports and assessments shall be publicly available.
- (4) **Mid-Term Review.** If annual outcome data indicates that a Region's alternative policy has produced outcomes materially below National Floor standards for two (2) consecutive years:
    - (i) the Board shall initiate a formal mid-term review within sixty (60) days;
    - (ii) the Region shall have one hundred twenty (120) days to demonstrate remediation or explain the divergence;
    - (iii) if the Board finds continued material divergence without adequate justification, the exemption shall be revoked;
    - (iv) upon revocation, the Region shall have one hundred eighty (180) days to achieve full compliance with the National Floor under subsection (c)(4).
- (5) **Material Divergence Standard.** For purposes of this subsection:
    - (i) the Board shall specify a domain-appropriate divergence threshold for each outcome metric in the preliminary assessment under subsection (d)(2), within a range of no less than eighty-five percent (85%) and no more than ninety-five percent (95%) of the National Floor benchmark, and shall designate the polarity of each metric (whether higher or lower values represent superior outcomes);
    - (ii) in the absence of a Board-specified threshold, the default is ninety percent (90%);
    - (iii) "materially below" means outcomes that are worse than the applicable threshold in the direction designated under clause (i), as measured by the metrics established under subsection (b);
    - (iv) a Region may petition the Board to exclude a measurement period affected by exogenous causes (economic recession, natural disaster, pandemic, or other force majeure), subject to:
        - (A) the Board shall certify or deny the exogenous cause claim within sixty (60) days of the petition; if the Board fails to act within sixty (60) days, the claim is deemed denied without prejudice to re-petition upon submission of additional evidence;
        - (B) if certified, the affected measurement period is excluded from divergence calculations for up to two (2) consecutive annual reporting periods;
        - (C) after two (2) years of certified exclusion, the Region must demonstrate remediation or the full divergence record applies regardless of continued exogenous conditions;
        - (D) the Board's certification, including underlying data and analysis, shall be publicly available.
- (6) **Lapse and Transition.** If a Region fails to file a timely renewal petition:
    - (i) the exemption expires at the end of the five-year term;
    - (ii) the Region shall have one hundred eighty (180) days to achieve full compliance with the National Floor;
    - (iii) a late renewal petition filed within ninety (90) days of expiration may be accepted at the Board's discretion if the Region demonstrates good cause for the delay.

---

**(f) Anti-Circumvention and Integrity.**

- (1) **No Race to Bottom.** This section does not authorize Regional policies that fail to achieve the substantive outcomes intended by National Floors. "Equivalence" requires equal or superior outcomes as measured by the metrics established under subsection (b), not mere formal compliance, lesser protections, or alternative definitions of the protected interest.
- (2) **Serial Refiling Prohibition.** A Region whose Equivalence Petition has been denied may not refile a petition addressing the same National Floor within twelve (12) months of denial unless:
    - (i) the Region's alternative policy has been materially redesigned; and
    - (ii) the Board certifies that the redesigned policy is sufficiently distinct to warrant de novo review.
- (3) **Provisional Abuse Prevention.** If a Region's Equivalence Petition is denied and the Region subsequently refiles within the one hundred eighty (180) day compliance period under subsection (c)(4):
    - (i) the Region may not implement the alternative policy on a provisional basis during the second petition;
    - (ii) the compliance clock under subsection (c)(4) continues to run during the second petition;
    - (iii) the Board may consolidate the second petition with compliance monitoring.
- (4) **Outcome Measurement Integrity.** Regions may not manipulate the timing, methodology, or data sources of outcome measurement to inflate equivalence claims:
    - (i) the Board shall specify measurement periods and data sources in the preliminary assessment under subsection (d)(2);
    - (ii) Regions shall provide access to raw data underlying outcome reports;
    - (iii) the Board may commission independent verification of Regional outcome data;
    - (iv) knowing submission of materially false outcome data constitutes fraud upon the Board and grounds for immediate exemption revocation plus five-year disqualification from filing new petitions.
- (5) **Exemption Stacking.** Where a Region holds or seeks multiple Equivalence Exemptions whose combined effect may produce outcomes below the aggregate intent of the applicable National Floors:
    - (i) the Board shall assess the cumulative impact of stacked exemptions at initial grant and at each renewal;
    - (ii) the Board may condition approval or renewal of any exemption on the Region demonstrating that cumulative outcomes remain equivalent;
    - (iii) this assessment does not apply to exemptions covering unrelated policy domains.
- (6) **Relationship to Constitutional Minimums.** Equivalence Exemptions may not be sought for:
    - (i) constitutional minimums established under Section 4(h) (labor and safety minimums), which are permanent and exempt from variance and sunset under Section 4(k)(1);
    - (ii) rights protections established under Article III-RF;
    - (iii) obligations under Article I (Regional structure, mutual recognition, migration).
- (7) **Enforcement.**
    - (i) **Standing.** The following persons may bring an action in federal court challenging a Region's failure to achieve equivalent outcomes under a granted exemption:
        - (A) residents of the Region directly affected by the policy subject to the exemption;
        - (B) regulated entities operating within the Region subject to obligations under the applicable National Floor;
        - (C) other Regions that demonstrate direct harm from competitive disadvantage or spillover effects attributable to the exemption.
    - (ii) **Administrative Exhaustion.** Before filing suit, a plaintiff must first petition the Board to initiate a mid-term review under subsection (e)(4). The plaintiff may proceed to federal court only after the Board acts on the petition or fails to act within one hundred twenty (120) days.
    - (iii) **Remedies.** If the court finds the Region's alternative policy has not achieved equivalent outcomes, the court may:
        - (A) order compliance with the National Floor within a specified period;
        - (B) revoke the exemption prospectively;
        - (C) award compensatory damages to residents who have standing under clause (i)(A); injunctive relief under subclauses (A) and (B) is available to all parties with standing under clause (i).

## 6. Gaming Vectors Identified

| # | Vector | Mechanism | Mitigation |
|---|--------|-----------|------------|
| G1 | Permanent Provisional | File petition, implement alternative, ARB never rules; Region content with indefinite provisional | §6(d)(4): 270-day deadline + provisional on timeout + mandamus (any standing party) + provisional suspension backstop at 90 days |
| G2 | Outcome Degradation | Win exemption Year 1, degrade policy Years 2-5 | §6(e)(3)-(4): annual monitoring + mid-term review at 2yr divergence |
| G3 | Serial Refiling | Denied → comply 180 days → refile same petition | §6(f)(2): 12-month refiling prohibition unless materially redesigned |
| G4 | Provisional Loop | File → provisional implementation → denied → refile during compliance period | §6(f)(3): no provisional status on refiling; compliance clock continues |
| G5 | Data Manipulation | Game measurement timing/methodology to inflate outcomes | §6(f)(4): Board specifies measurement; raw data access; independent verification |
| G6 | Metric Cherry-Pick | Congress specifies vague metrics; Region picks favorable interpretation | §6(d)(2)(i)-(ii): Board specifies metrics and methodology in preliminary assessment |
| G7 | Exemption Stacking | Multiple exemptions produce cumulative sub-Floor outcomes | §6(f)(5): cumulative impact assessment at initial grant and renewal |
| G8 | Constitutional Minimum Bypass | Use equivalence to evade §4(h) labor/safety minimums | §6(f)(6): constitutional minimums excluded, citing §4(k)(1) permanence |
| G9 | Bond Minimization | Post minimal bond, default on compliance | Existing §6(c)(2): Board determines bond amount; "adequate" standard |
| G10 | Sunset Gaming | Degrade Years 2-4, ramp up for Year 5 renewal | §6(e)(4): mid-term review triggered by 2 consecutive years of material divergence |
| G11 | Late Filing Trap | "Forget" to renew, extend 180-day compliance window | §6(e)(6): clear expiration; limited late-filing grace at Board discretion |
| G12 | Rush Denial | Captured ARB denies petition without adequate review | §6(d)(2): mandatory preliminary assessment at 120 days with specified content |
| G13 | Staffing Starvation | Defund ARB equivalence staff to prevent timely determinations | §6(d)(4)(v): triggers mandatory staffing provisions of §5(d)(9)-(10) |
| G14 | Data Drag | Withhold required data until day 270 to trigger provisional approval without substantive review | §6(d)(3): tolling on non-cooperation; §6(d)(7): 3-year expedited disqualification + additional bond |
| G15 | Benchmark Gaming | Pressure Congress for weak metrics in enabling legislation; exploit vague standards | §6(b): ARB fills metric gaps; §6(d)(2): Board specifies methodology; §6(f)(1): outcome equivalence not formal compliance |
| G16 | Litigation Shield | Flood federal courts with private enforcement suits to create judicial backlog or harassment | §6(f)(7)(ii): administrative exhaustion required; §6(f)(7)(i): standing limited to directly affected parties |
| G17 | Exogenous Stall | Board fails to act on exogenous cause claim within 60 days, creating indefinite measurement exclusion | §6(e)(5)(iv)(A): deemed denied after 60 days without prejudice to re-petition |
| G18 | Metric Inversion | Exploit directionality ambiguity to claim sub-Floor performance is actually superior | §6(e)(5)(i): Board designates polarity; §6(e)(5)(iii): "worse than" in designated direction |

## 8. Review Questions

### Resolved in v2

1. ~~**90% threshold for material divergence**~~ — Replaced with domain-sensitive standard: Board specifies per-metric threshold bounded 85-95%, default 90%. (R1 finding, accepted)

2. ~~**270-day determination timeline**~~ — Added 90-day good-cause extension for complex petitions; renewals already expedited at 90 days. (R1 question, accepted)

3. ~~**Auto-approval on ARB timeout**~~ — Changed from auto-finalization to provisional + judicial mandamus. Preserves Region protection without creating unreviewed final exemptions. (R1 finding, accepted; R2 principle preserved via continued provisional status)

4. ~~**Private enforcement standing**~~ — Standing enumerated (Region residents, regulated entities, affected Regions); administrative exhaustion required. (R1 finding, accepted)

5. ~~**Exogenous cause exception**~~ — Now requires Board certification within 60 days; limited to 2-year exclusion; publicly reported. (R1 finding, accepted)

### Resolved in v3

1. ~~**Indefinite provisional status**~~ — Mandamus broadened to any standing party; provisional suspension backstop at 90 days after 180-day post-timeout period. (R2-R1 HIGH finding, accepted)

2. ~~**Metric directionality**~~ — Board designates polarity; "materially below" redefined as "worse than in the designated direction." (R2-R1 MEDIUM finding, accepted)

3. ~~**Exogenous cause stall**~~ — Board failure to act within 60 days = deemed denied without prejudice. (R2-R1 MEDIUM finding, accepted)

4. ~~**Damages standing scope**~~ — Explicitly limited to residents under (i)(A); injunctive relief available to all standing parties. (R2-R1 LOW finding, accepted as intentional policy)

### Retained

1. **12-month refiling prohibition** — Is 12 months the right cooling period? Shorter (6 months) allows faster iteration; longer (24 months) prevents refiling abuse more completely.

2. **Bond adequacy** — Existing §6(c)(2) gives the Board discretion on bond amounts. Should §6(f) add minimum bond standards or a formula (e.g., estimated remediation costs)?

3. **Renewal data window** (from R1) — Should renewal require all 5 years of outcome data, or should recent performance (e.g., final 2 years) be weighted more heavily? Current text requires "five years of outcome data" without specifying weighting.

## 10. Round 2 Review and v2 → v3 Changes

### Round 2 Review Summary

| Finding | R1 | R2 | v3 Resolution |
|---------|----|----|---------------|
| Indefinite provisional status | HIGH: mandamus optional and Region-only; Region happy with provisional = ARB stalls forever | Approves v2; calls mandamus compromise "elegant" | Accept R1: broaden mandamus to any standing party + provisional suspension backstop |
| Metric directionality | MEDIUM: percent-of-benchmark test inverts for harm-reduction metrics | Not addressed | Accept R1: add polarity designation; redefine "materially below" as directional |
| Exogenous cause stall | MEDIUM: no default if Board fails to act on certification within 60 days | Not addressed | Accept R1: deemed denied after 60 days without prejudice |
| Damages standing scope | LOW: §6(f)(7)(iii)(C) limits damages to (i)(A) only; is this intentional? | Not addressed | Accept R1: make explicit as policy choice; injunctive relief available to all |

### Disagreement Resolution: Indefinite Provisional

R2 approved the v2 mandamus approach as "elegant." R1 identified a residual gap: mandamus is optional and only available to the petitioning Region. If the Region is content operating under provisional status (no final review, no accountability), it has no incentive to seek mandamus. The ARB has no incentive to act. Result: permanent provisional.

**v3 resolution**: Two-pronged fix. (1) Broaden mandamus standing to any party under §6(f)(7)(i) — affected residents, regulated entities, and other Regions can compel a determination even if the petitioning Region is content with indefinite provisional. (2) Add hard backstop: if no party seeks mandamus within 90 days after the 180-day post-timeout period, provisional approval is suspended and the Region must comply with the National Floor. This creates a natural deadline that forces either mandamus or compliance — no path to permanent unreviewed provisional status.

### v2 → v3 Change Summary
