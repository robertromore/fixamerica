# Gap 104 Resolution: Article I, Section 9 Expansion

## Status: FINAL (v3)

**Resolves:** Gap 104 (Predatory "Infrastructure Licensing" — Labor Chokepoints)

**Severity:** Medium

**Date:** 2026-02-03

**Revision:** v3 FINAL — incorporates Round 2 fixes (2 reviewers, 5 findings on v2)

**Target:** Article I-RF, Section 9 — new subsections (bb) through (dd), appended after existing (aa)

**Placement Rationale:** Gap 104 proposes infrastructure-specific labor protections as a complement to the general credential recognition framework in Art I §9. The existing §9(a)-(aa) provides comprehensive credential portability covering presumption of competency (§9(g)), Essential for Public Safety standard (§9(h)), ARB pre-approval for supplementary requirements (§9(j)-(l)), anti-protectionism with strict scrutiny for facially neutral discrimination (§9(m)-(n)), anti-retaliation (§9(t)), and federal backstop credentials (§9(u)). The new subsections address the narrow residual gap: infrastructure-specific workforce composition rules for federally-funded projects, a proactive national infrastructure credential, and infrastructure funds consequences — mechanisms not covered by the general credential framework.

## Pre-Existing Coverage Analysis

Before drafting new text, each gaming vector from the Gap 104 proposal was assessed against existing Art I §9 provisions:

### Gaming Vector 1: "Regional Safety Certification"

| Proposed Fix | Existing Coverage | Status |
|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| Infrastructure workers deemed qualified across Regions | §9(g): Rebuttable presumption of competency for ALL credentials | **Covered** |
| No additional Regional certifications required | §9(h)-(i): Essential for Public Safety standard; prohibited justifications | **Covered** |
| Supplementary requirements voided if discriminatory | §9(j)-(l): ARB pre-approval required; automatic recognition on ARB silence | **Covered** |

### Gaming Vector 2: "Expedited Local Track"

| Proposed Fix | Existing Coverage | Status |
|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| No expedited process for residents only | §9(m): Facially neutral discrimination → strict scrutiny | **Covered** |
| No higher fees for out-of-Region applicants | §9(c): Fee cap at lesser of processing costs or in-Region renewal fee | **Covered** |
| No in-person requirements excluding non-residents | §9(n)(1)-(2): Prohibited Region-only continuing education and Region-specific knowledge requirements | **Covered** |

### Gaming Vector 3: "Continuous Renewal"

| Proposed Fix | Existing Coverage | Status |
|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| Certification obtainable remotely | §9(n)(1): Region-only continuing education prohibited | **Covered** |
| Renewal accessible to non-residents | §9(q): 30-day processing with automatic recognition | **Covered** |
| Minimum 3-year validity | §9(s): 90-day supervised practice cap | **Partially covered** — minimum validity period not specified |

### Gaming Vector 4: "Federal Funds Capture"

| Proposed Fix | Existing Coverage | Status |
|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| Workers from any Region employed on federal projects | §9(u): Federal Practice Credential on systematic non-compliance | **Partially covered** — reactive, not proactive |
| Project labor achievable by nationwide workers | Not addressed | **NOT COVERED** |
| Local preference cap (20%) | Not addressed | **NOT COVERED** |
| Federal funds withholding/repayment | Not addressed | **NOT COVERED** |

### Summary

| Gaming Vector | Status | Residual Risk |
|---------------|--------|---------------|
| Regional Safety Certification | Closed | None — §9(g)-(l) provides comprehensive protection |
| Expedited Local Track | Closed | None — §9(c), (m), (n) close all pathways |
| Continuous Renewal | Substantially closed | Minor — no minimum validity period specified |
| Federal Funds Capture | Open | Significant — no federal project workforce rules |

**Conclusion:** 3 of 4 gaming vectors are already closed by existing Art I §9 provisions. The residual gap is narrow but significant: a Region could comply with general credential requirements while manipulating workforce composition on federally-funded infrastructure projects through cumulative micro-barriers, project-specific "safety orientations," informal contractor preferences, or leveraging the gap between credential recognition (covered) and actual project hiring (not covered).

## Round 1 Convergence Analysis

### Reviewer Summary

| ID | Severity | Finding | R1 | R2 | Resolution |
|----|----------|---------|----|----|-----------|
| C1 | HIGH | Infrastructure definition scope — "as defined in Section 6" too narrow, may exclude water systems, energy grid | HIGH — "infrastructure as defined in Section 6" points to Non-Blockade/critical corridors, narrower than intended | F4 MEDIUM — DOE/FCC needed for grid and telecom credentials | **Complementary** — both point to broader infrastructure coverage; adopt Art II §4(m) critical infrastructure definition (6 categories + NIST expandable) and add DOE + FCC to agency coordination |
| C2 | HIGH | Complaint-based presumption gaming — (dd)(3) triggers presumption on complaints, not findings, inviting abusive filings | HIGH — "substantiated complaints," "ARB findings," or "court determinations" | Not addressed | **Single-reviewer** — valid concern; change to "substantiated complaints as determined by the Allocation Review Board" |
| C3 | HIGH | NIC vs. safety standards conflict — (bb)(4) "no supplementary requirements" vs. (bb)(5) Regional safety standards | MEDIUM — clarify that safety standards are not "supplementary requirements" when not framed as credentials | Q4 — retain 4 hours but add OSHA certification exception | **Complementary** — both want safety standard scoping; clarify that (bb)(5) safety standards are operational measures (not credentials) and add OSHA-certified exception for specialized hazards |
| C4 | CRITICAL | Local preference cap too high — 20% enables protectionism on federal projects | Not addressed | F1 CRITICAL — reduce to 5% or 0%; 20% is a quota system | **Single-reviewer** — persuasive; reduce to 5% to balance anti-protectionism with legitimate local training programs |
| C5 | CRITICAL | Contractor evaluation weight — 10% residency handicap is insurmountable in competitive bidding | Not addressed | F2 CRITICAL — reduce to 0%; federal money = federal market | **Single-reviewer** — persuasive; prohibit residency/credential-holding as weighted evaluation factors |
| C6 | HIGH | Anti-coercion conflict — (dd) conditions funds on labor policies without addressing Art X §4 | Not addressed | F3 HIGH — explicit "Notwithstanding Art X §4" required | **Single-reviewer** — strong argument; add explicit override clause |
| C7 | MEDIUM | Tribal hiring preferences — (cc)(3) local preference cap conflicts with tribal employment preferences on tribal land | MEDIUM — add explicit carve-out or harmonization | Not addressed | **Single-reviewer** — valid; add carve-out for Art XX §3 tribal preferences |
| C8 | MEDIUM | Repayment proportionality — (dd)(1)(B) "from date of first violation" could trigger full-project repayment for a single violation | MEDIUM — tie to share of labor costs affected or defined look-back | Not addressed | **Single-reviewer** — valid; change to proportional calculation |
| C9 | MEDIUM | Penalty scaling — $5,000 fixed penalty insufficient for large-scale discrimination | Not addressed | F5 MEDIUM — "greater of $5,000 or 3x lost wages" | **Single-reviewer** — adopt treble damages floor |
| C10 | LOW | On-site safety briefing ambiguity — (cc)(2) "in person at Regional facility" vs. on-site project briefings | LOW — carve-out for on-site safety briefings at project location | Q4 — add OSHA exception | **Complementary** — both want on-site briefing clarification; add explicit on-site carve-out |
| C11 | — | Additional R2 recommendations on remaining open questions | — | Q2 (optional NIC), Q7 (3yr validity), Q10 (no transition) | **Adopted** — see Open Questions Resolved below |

**Convergence statistics:** 0 convergent, 5 complementary, 0 contradictions, 6 single-reviewer (all adopted)

### Open Questions Resolved

| # | Question | R1 | R2 | v2 Resolution |
|---|----------|----|----|---------------|
| 1 | 3 subsections sufficient? | Not addressed | Q1: Sufficient | Sufficient — residual gap analysis correctly scoped; retained at 3 subsections |
| 2 | NIC mandatory or optional? | Not addressed | Q2: Optional but sufficient | Optional — workers may hold NIC as alternative to Regional credentials; NIC is sufficient on its own |
| 3 | 20% local preference cap? | Not directly | F1: 5% or 0% | **5%** — 20% enables protectionism; 5% allows legitimate local training programs |
| 4 | 4-hour orientation cap? | LOW — on-site carve-out | Q4: Retain, add OSHA exception | Retained with on-site project-location carve-out + OSHA-certified specialized hazard exception |
| 5 | Anti-coercion interaction? | Not addressed | F3: Explicit override | Explicit "Notwithstanding Art X §4" clause added |
| 6 | $5,000 penalty sufficient? | Not addressed | F5: Treble damages | Changed to "greater of $5,000 or three times lost wages" |
| 7 | Minimum credential validity? | Not addressed | Q7: 3-year minimum | 3-year minimum added at §9(bb)(6) |
| 8 | Which agencies for NIC? | HIGH — broader definition needed | F4: Add DOE, FCC | DOT + DOL + DOE + FCC + relevant federal safety agencies |
| 9 | 10% contractor evaluation cap? | Not addressed | F2: Zero weight | Prohibition on residency/credential-holding as evaluation factors |
| 10 | Transition period? | Not addressed | Q10: No transition | No transition — anti-discrimination rules apply immediately |

## Round 2 Convergence Analysis

### Reviewer Summary

| ID | Severity | Finding | R2-1 | R2-2 | Resolution |
|----|----------|---------|------|------|-----------|
| D1 | HIGH | Internal conflict: (cc)(1) forbids "any" orientation while (cc)(2) permits limited ones | HIGH — add "except as provided in (cc)(2)" | Not addressed | **Single-reviewer** — clear internal inconsistency; add exception cross-reference to (cc)(1) |
| D2 | HIGH | §9(bb)(5)(C) >4hr safety measures bypass ARB certification | HIGH — add explicit ARB certification for >4hr measures | Not addressed | **Single-reviewer** — correct; (bb)(5)(C) invokes EPS standard but omits the ARB certification that normally accompanies it under §9(j); add ARB requirement |
| D3 | MEDIUM | OSHA off-site training blocked by (cc)(2)(C) | MEDIUM — narrow carve-out for accredited off-site OSHA training | Not addressed | **Single-reviewer** — valid; (cc)(2)(C) bans completion at non-project facilities, but some OSHA-certified hazard training requires specialized accredited facilities; add carve-out |
| D4 | MEDIUM | §9(cc)(4) business registration ban vs. lawful tax registration | MEDIUM — clarify prerequisite vs. scored factor | Not addressed | **Single-reviewer** — important distinction; registration for tax compliance is a ministerial prerequisite, not a scored evaluation factor; clarify |
| D5 | LOW | §9(dd)(1)(C) direct federal admin doesn't preserve tribal carve-out | LOW — add tribal preservation sentence | Confirmed Gap 104 CLOSED | **Single-reviewer** — (cc)(3) tribal carve-out must survive transition to direct federal administration; add preservation clause |

**Convergence statistics:** 0 convergent, 0 complementary, 0 contradictions, 5 single-reviewer (all adopted)

**R2-2 executive summary:** Gap 104 CLOSED. Safety MANAGED. Gaming MITIGATED. Enforcement SECURED. All 5 D-findings are surgical refinements, not structural concerns.

## Proposed Constitutional Text (v3 FINAL)

Three new subsections appended to Article I-RF, Section 9, after existing subsection (aa):

### Infrastructure Labor Protection

> **(bb) Infrastructure Labor Reciprocity.**
>
> (1) In addition to the general credential recognition requirements of this Section, all credentials qualifying a worker for construction, operation, maintenance, inspection, or repair of critical infrastructure as defined in Article II, Section 4(m) shall be recognized across all Regions without infrastructure-specific supplementary requirements of any kind.
>
> (2) No Region may require any credential, certification, endorsement, orientation, safety course, or qualification for infrastructure work that is separate from or additional to the professional credentials recognized under subsections (c) through (u), unless the requirement:
>
> - (A) Has been certified by the Allocation Review Board under subsection (j) as Essential for Public Safety under subsection (h);
>
> - (B) Applies equally to Regional residents and out-of-Region workers in identical form, timeline, and cost;
>
> - (C) Does not require in-person attendance at a Regional facility, Regional residency, or Regional domicile. On-site safety briefings conducted at the project location are not "in-person attendance at a Regional facility" for purposes of this clause.
>
> (3) The Department of Transportation, acting in coordination with the Department of Labor, Department of Energy, Federal Communications Commission, and relevant federal safety agencies, shall establish National Infrastructure Worker Credentials for common infrastructure roles including but not limited to: heavy equipment operation, electrical systems, structural construction, pipeline operation, telecommunications infrastructure, energy grid operation, and transportation corridor maintenance.
>
> (4) A National Infrastructure Worker Credential is optional. Workers may hold it as an alternative to Regional credentials. A National Infrastructure Worker Credential shall be recognized in all Regions without supplementary requirements of any kind and without the ARB certification process of subsection (j).
>
> (5) Regions retain authority to establish operational safety measures for infrastructure work within their borders — including site-specific protocols, personal protective equipment requirements, and hazard-specific procedures — provided such measures:
>
> - (A) Apply equally to holders of Regional and National credentials;
>
> - (B) Do not constitute separate credentials, certifications, or endorsements;
>
> - (C) Meet the Essential for Public Safety standard of subsection (h) and have been certified by the Allocation Review Board under subsection (j) if they exceed four (4) hours of training or orientation, unless the specific hazard requires specialized training certified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
>
> (6) Infrastructure credentials recognized under this Section, whether Regional or National, shall have a validity period of not less than three (3) years. A Region may not circumvent this requirement through rolling renewal schedules, mandatory refresher certifications, or periodic re-examinations at intervals of less than three (3) years, unless justified by documented changes in safety standards certified by the ARB under subsection (j).
>
> **(cc) Federal Project Labor Mobility.**
>
> (1) For any infrastructure project receiving federal funds in whole or in part, workers from any Region holding valid infrastructure credentials — whether Regional credentials recognized under this Section or National Infrastructure Worker Credentials under subsection (bb)(3) — may be employed without additional Regional certification, endorsement, orientation, or qualification of any kind, except as provided in paragraph (2).
>
> (2) No Region may impose project-specific safety orientations, site certifications, or local familiarization requirements on federally-funded infrastructure projects that:
>
> - (A) Exceed four (4) hours in duration, unless the specific hazard requires specialized training certified by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration;
>
> - (B) Are not equally required of Regional residents performing equivalent work on the same project;
>
> - (C) Must be completed at a Regional facility other than the project site itself, except that training at an accredited facility as required by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration is not subject to this limitation.
>
> (3) No Region may require, by law, regulation, contract condition, or administrative practice, that more than five percent (5%) of the workforce on a federally-funded infrastructure project consist of Regional residents or holders of Regional-specific credentials. This limitation does not apply to tribal employment preferences established under Article XX, Section 3, or applicable federal law, for projects located on tribal land.
>
> (4) Contractor selection criteria for federally-funded infrastructure projects may not include Regional residency, Regional credential holding, or Regional business registration as scored evaluation factors. This prohibition does not apply to lawful requirements for business registration for tax compliance purposes, provided such registration is a ministerial prerequisite available to all applicants without discretionary approval. Demonstrated experience in comparable infrastructure conditions is a permissible evaluation criterion regardless of the Region in which the experience was obtained.
>
> (5) Notwithstanding the Non-Coercion Standard of Article X, Section 4, compliance with this subsection is a condition of receiving federal infrastructure funds. The federal agency administering the funds shall:
>
> - (A) Monitor workforce composition on projects exceeding ten million dollars ($10,000,000);
>
> - (B) Investigate complaints of discriminatory hiring practices;
>
> - (C) Withhold remaining disbursements upon finding of non-compliance, pending corrective action.
>
> **(dd) Infrastructure Funds Enforcement.**
>
> (1) Notwithstanding the Non-Coercion Standard of Article X, Section 4, if the Allocation Review Board or a federal court finds that a Region has maintained discriminatory infrastructure certification requirements in violation of this Section:
>
> - (A) Federal infrastructure funds allocated to the Region may be suspended pending compliance;
>
> - (B) The Region shall repay the proportion of federal funds attributable to labor costs on positions filled through discriminatory practices, calculated from the date of first violation. Repayment shall not exceed the total labor cost share of affected projects;
>
> - (C) Future federal infrastructure projects within the non-compliant Region may be administered directly by the relevant federal agency, bypassing Regional procurement and labor requirements. Direct federal administration under this paragraph shall preserve tribal employment preferences established under Article XX, Section 3 for projects located on tribal land.
>
> (2) Workers denied employment on federally-funded infrastructure projects due to discriminatory Regional certification requirements may:
>
> - (A) Recover lost wages, consequential damages, and a penalty of not less than the greater of five thousand dollars ($5,000) or three times the worker's documented lost wages, from the Region;
>
> - (B) Obtain injunctive relief requiring immediate credential recognition and project access;
>
> - (C) Recover attorney fees and costs if they prevail.
>
> (3) The Department of Justice shall have authority to bring enforcement actions against Regions that systematically discriminate against out-of-Region infrastructure workers. A pattern of three (3) or more substantiated complaints as determined by the Allocation Review Board within twelve (12) months creates a rebuttable presumption of systematic discrimination.

## Key Design Decisions (Cumulative v1 + v2 + v3)

1. **Narrow scope** (v1) — 3 new subsections covering residual gap only. R2 confirmed sufficiency.

2. **Art II §4(m) critical infrastructure definition** (v2, C1) — Replaced "infrastructure as defined in Section 6" with explicit Art II §4(m) reference (6 categories: power, rail, highways, digital identity, telecom, pipeline + NIST expandable). Broader than Art I §6 corridors; consistent with Gap 92/116 infrastructure interoperability framework.

3. **DOT + DOL + DOE + FCC coordination** (v2, C1/C3) — Expanded agency list for NIC establishment. DOE covers energy grid; FCC covers telecommunications. Retains "relevant federal safety agencies" catch-all for OSHA and sector-specific agencies.

4. **5% local preference cap** (v2, C4) — Reduced from 20%. R2 argued persuasively that 20% enables protectionism. 5% allows legitimate local workforce development programs without distorting the federal project labor market. R1 did not address but R1's tribal preference concern (C7) led to the tribal carve-out at (cc)(3).

5. **Zero residency weight in contractor evaluation** (v2, C5) — Replaced 10% cap with outright prohibition on residency/credential-holding as evaluation factors. "Demonstrated experience in comparable infrastructure conditions" is permissible regardless of Region — separates relevant competency from geographic protectionism.

6. **Explicit "Notwithstanding Art X §4" clause** (v2, C6) — Added to both §9(cc)(5) and §9(dd)(1). Anti-discrimination in federal project hiring is a legitimate funding condition, but leaving the Art X §4 interaction to judicial interpretation creates litigation risk and delay.

7. **On-site briefing carve-out** (v2, C3/C10) — Clarified that on-site safety briefings at the project location are not "in-person attendance at a Regional facility." Separates legitimate site-specific safety from pretext for Regional facility requirements.

8. **OSHA-certified hazard exception** (v2, C3/C10) — 4-hour orientation cap includes exception for specialized hazards requiring OSHA-certified training. Prevents the cap from compromising genuine safety while maintaining the anti-circumvention function.

9. **(bb)(4)/(5) conflict resolved** (v2, C3) — Safety standards under (bb)(5) are explicitly "operational safety measures" (site-specific protocols, PPE, hazard procedures) that do not constitute "credentials, certifications, or endorsements." This eliminates the tension between "no supplementary requirements" and "Regional safety authority."

10. **Tribal hiring carve-out** (v2, C7) — 5% cap explicitly does not apply to tribal employment preferences under Art XX §3 for projects on tribal land. Harmonizes with Gap 99 sovereignty protections.

11. **Proportional repayment** (v2, C8) — Changed from open-ended "from date of first violation" to "proportion of federal funds attributable to labor costs on positions filled through discriminatory practices." Capped at total labor cost share. Prevents a single early violation from triggering full-project repayment.

12. **Treble damages floor** (v2, C9) — Changed from fixed $5,000 to "greater of $5,000 or three times lost wages." Scales deterrence to actual harm while maintaining minimum floor for low-wage workers.

13. **Substantiated complaints** (v2, C2) — Changed DOJ presumption trigger from "complaints" to "substantiated complaints as determined by the ARB." Prevents abusive filing to flip the presumption without merits.

14. **3-year minimum credential validity** (v2, C11/Q7) — Added at §9(bb)(6). Closes the "continuous renewal" gaming vector with explicit anti-circumvention language (rolling renewal, mandatory refresher, periodic re-examination at <3yr intervals prohibited absent ARB-certified safety standard changes).

15. **(cc)(1)/(cc)(2) cross-reference** (v3, D1) — Added "except as provided in paragraph (2)" to (cc)(1). Resolves internal conflict where (cc)(1) forbade "any" orientation while (cc)(2) implicitly permitted limited ones. The cross-reference makes the relationship explicit: no orientations at all except those meeting (cc)(2)'s constraints.

16. **ARB certification for >4hr safety measures** (v3, D2) — Added "and have been certified by the Allocation Review Board under subsection (j)" to (bb)(5)(C). The v2 text invoked the Essential for Public Safety standard but omitted the ARB certification process that normally accompanies it. This closes the bypass where a Region could self-certify >4hr safety measures without ARB review.

17. **OSHA off-site training carve-out** (v3, D3) — Added exception to (cc)(2)(C) for training at accredited OSHA facilities. The (cc)(2)(C) ban on completion at non-project Regional facilities would inadvertently block legitimate OSHA-certified hazard training that requires specialized accredited facilities (e.g., confined space rescue training, high-voltage electrical safety). The carve-out is limited to OSHA-required training at accredited facilities, not general Regional facilities.

18. **Business registration: prerequisite vs. scored factor** (v3, D4) — Clarified (cc)(4) that the prohibition applies to Regional business registration as a *scored evaluation factor*, not to lawful ministerial requirements for tax compliance registration. A Region may require any contractor to register for tax purposes, but cannot score that registration in competitive bidding. The registration must be available to all applicants without discretionary approval.

19. **Tribal carve-out in direct federal administration** (v3, D5) — Added sentence to (dd)(1)(C) preserving Art XX §3 tribal employment preferences when a non-compliant Region's projects are placed under direct federal administration. Without this clause, the "bypassing Regional procurement and labor requirements" language could inadvertently sweep away tribal preferences that are federal, not Regional, in origin.
