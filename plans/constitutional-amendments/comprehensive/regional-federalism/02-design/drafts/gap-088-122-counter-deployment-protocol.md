## Status: FINAL (v3)

**Resolves:** Gap 88 (Two-Key Bypass via Military Officer Corps Purge) and Gap 122 (duplicate)

**Severity:** Critical

**Date:** 2026-02-02

**Revision:** v3 — incorporates findings from two rounds of external review. See [Convergence Analysis](#7-convergence-analysis) for change log.

## 1. Problem Statement

The Two-Key rule (Article XI, Section 3) requires both the President and a majority of Regional Governors to authorize domestic military deployment. Article XI, Section 15 establishes officer corps independence protections: loyalty prohibition, protected refusal, mass removal trigger, purge consequences, counter-deployment authority, commander accountability, pardon limitation, and Joint Chiefs independence.

However, Section 15 addresses *who can refuse* and *who can respond* without specifying *how* the response operates. If a president purges constitutionalist officers and loyalists deploy federal forces without Two-Key authorization, Section 15(e) authorizes Regional Guard activation but does not specify:

- What actions counter-deployment forces may take
- Who determines that deployment is unauthorized (activation trigger)
- What rules of engagement apply to prevent escalation
- How federal personnel caught in the middle are treated
- How the crisis is adjudicated after the fact
- How courts intervene on an emergency timeline

This creates the "frozen standoff" vulnerability: federal forces illegally deployed occupy territory, Regional Guard mobilizes but lacks clear operational authority, and the status quo favors the side holding the field.

## 2. What Already Exists

### Article XI, Section 15 (standalone Military Civilian Control Amendment)

| Subsection | Provision | Coverage |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| (a) | Prohibited loyalty requirements | Complete |
| (b) | Protected refusal | Complete |
| (c) | Mass removal trigger (>5 generals / 60 days) | Complete |
| (d) | Purge finding consequences (reinstatement, appointment suspension) | Complete |
| (e) | Counter-deployment authority | **Principle only; lacks operational detail** |
| (f) | Commander accountability | Complete |
| (g) | Pardon limitation | Complete |
| (h) | Joint Chiefs independence | Complete |

### Article XI, Section 9 (Counter-Key Authority)

Allows Speaker, President pro tempore, majority of Governors, or Chief Justice to suspend deployment pending 7-day Supreme Court review. This is the pre-deployment challenge mechanism but does not address forces already in the field.

### Article XI-RF, Section 2 (Federalization of Regional Guard)

Subsections (a)-(q) cover federalization, two-key authorization, emergency response acceleration, compliance enforcement, and congressional key override. No counter-deployment operational provisions.

---

## 3. Proposed Constitutional Text

### 3A. New Article XI, Section 16 — Counter-Deployment Operations Protocol

*This section operationalizes the counter-deployment authority established in Section 15(e), providing the procedural framework for Regional Guard or State National Guard activation when federal forces are deployed domestically without Two-Key authorization.*

---

**(a) Definitions and Authorization Status.** For purposes of this section:

- (1) **"Unauthorized deployment"** means any domestic deployment of federal armed forces that:
    - (i) lacks valid Two-Key authorization under Section 3;
    - (ii) is subject to a counter-key suspension under Section 9 that has not been lifted;
    - (iii) is subject to a judicial stay or temporary restraining order under subsection (h);
    - (iv) has failed to produce Two-Key documentation within the timeline required by subsection (g), giving rise to a rebuttable presumption that the deployment is unauthorized; or
    - (v) exceeds the geographic scope, temporal duration, or stated mission of the Two-Key authorization obtained.
- (2) **"Domestic deployment"** has the meaning established in Section 11(a) of this Article, including cyber-kinetic operations meeting the force-equivalence threshold.
- (3) The authorization status of a deployment shall be determined by its functional characteristics and legal documentation, not by the label assigned to the deployment by the executive branch. A deployment designated as "humanitarian assistance," "disaster relief," "training exercise," or any other non-combat label is subject to this section if it results in the positioning of armed federal forces in proximity to Regional or State government facilities, election administration sites, or critical civilian infrastructure without Governor consent.

---

**(b) Activation Determination.** Counter-deployment authority under Section 15(e) activates upon a determination that a domestic deployment of federal armed forces is unauthorized as defined in subsection (a). Such determination may be made by any of the following:

- (1) the Allocation Review Board, by majority vote, or such equivalent oversight body as Congress may establish;
- (2) three or more Regional Governors acting jointly, of whom at least one must be the Governor of a Region in which unauthorized forces are deployed or toward which unauthorized forces are moving, or a majority of State Governors if Regional Federalism is not adopted, of whom at least one must be the Governor of an affected State;
- (3) the Supreme Court, upon emergency petition under subsection (h);
- (4) the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate acting jointly, but only if the ARB is unable to convene within twenty-four (24) hours of a request for activation determination.

A determination under this subsection need not be final or judicially confirmed to authorize defensive activation. Counter-deployment authority continues unless and until a court of competent jurisdiction rules that the original deployment was constitutionally authorized, at which point counter-deployment forces shall stand down within twenty-four hours.

---

**(c) Authorized Actions.** Forces operating under counter-deployment authority may:

- (1) establish interdiction positions, including checkpoints and roadblocks, to halt unauthorized federal military movement within the activating jurisdiction. Interdiction positions shall be configured to minimize incidental restriction of civilian movement; where restriction of civilian transit is unavoidable due to proximity to military interdiction, counter-deployment forces shall establish clearly marked civilian bypass routes and shall restore civilian passage as soon as practicable;
- (2) secure Regional or State government facilities, election administration sites, and designated critical infrastructure against seizure by unauthorized forces;
- (3) use proportional, minimum-necessary force to prevent the seizure of Regional or State government assets, communications systems, and records;
- (4) receive into custody federal military personnel who voluntarily surrender, defect, or stand down under Section 15(e) or subsection (e)(2) of this section. Personnel received into custody shall be presented to a federal magistrate judge, or to the nearest available Article III judge if no federal magistrate is accessible, within twenty-four (24) hours. If no federal judicial officer is accessible within forty-eight (48) hours due to the emergency, personnel shall be transferred to a designated federal custody facility or released with recorded identity and notice to appear. The writ of habeas corpus applies without exception to all persons held under this subsection;
- (5) interdict federal military personnel who are actively obstructing the functioning of Regional or State government institutions, including courts, legislatures, and executive offices, using the minimum force necessary to restore governmental operations.

Counter-deployment forces may not:

- (6) initiate offensive operations against federal military installations, bases, or facilities;
- (7) obstruct federal forces engaged in operations authorized by valid Two-Key authorization, declaration of war, or court order;
- (8) seize federal property or weapons systems;
- (9) extend operations beyond the geographic jurisdiction of the activating Governor(s) without that jurisdiction's Governor's consent;
- (10) approach, enter, secure, or interfere with any declared nuclear weapons facility, strategic missile site, strategic bomber base, or nuclear weapons storage facility. Security of nuclear and strategic assets remains exclusively federal regardless of the authorization status of the deployment that occasioned counter-deployment activation.

---

**(d) Rules of Engagement.** All counter-deployment operations shall adhere to the following:

- (1) **De-escalation priority.** Counter-deployment forces shall prioritize de-escalation, negotiation, and avoidance of casualties at every stage. Lethal force is authorized only in self-defense or defense of civilians under imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm;
- (2) **Proportionality.** Force used shall be proportional to the threat presented. Escalation beyond the minimum necessary to halt unauthorized movement is prohibited;
- (3) **Documentation.** All counter-deployment operations shall be documented through audio-visual recording. Recordings shall be securely stored and uploaded within twenty-four (24) hours, when operationally safe, to the custody of the Inspector General of the Department of Defense and an independent custodian designated by the Chief Justice. If upload is not operationally safe, recordings shall be preserved in tamper-evident storage and uploaded at the earliest safe opportunity, but no later than seventy-two (72) hours after creation;
- (4) **Communication.** Counter-deployment commanders shall maintain open communication channels with opposing federal commanders and shall issue standing invitations to negotiate withdrawal;
- (5) **Civilian protection.** Counter-deployment authority extends only to unauthorized federal military forces. Counter-deployment operations may not impose curfews, exercise law enforcement authority over civilians, or restrict civilian movement except as incidental to military interdiction under subsection (c)(1).

---

**(e) Federal Personnel Status.** Federal military personnel operating under unauthorized deployment orders:

- (1) are not combatants and retain all constitutional rights, including rights under the Fifth and Sixth Amendments;
- (2) may individually stand down, refuse further orders, or surrender to counter-deployment forces without penalty under military or civilian law, provided the deployment is subsequently found unauthorized or the individual reasonably relied on an activation determination under subsection (b);
- (3) shall be treated as materially misled rather than criminally culpable, absent evidence of individual misconduct, war crimes, or knowing participation in the planning of unauthorized deployment;
- (4) may not be harmed, mistreated, or subjected to coercion while in counter-deployment custody;
- (5) shall be presented to a federal magistrate judge or released within twenty-four (24) hours of being received into custody under subsection (c)(4). If no federal judicial officer is accessible within forty-eight (48) hours, subsection (c)(4) governs.

**Duty to Inquire.** Commissioned officers at the grade of O-6 (Colonel / Captain) and above have an affirmative duty to independently verify that valid Two-Key authorization exists before executing any domestic deployment order. An O-6 or above officer who executes a domestic deployment order without independently verifying Two-Key authorization may not invoke the "materially misled" presumption of paragraph (3) and is subject to personal accountability under Section 15(f).

Nothing in this subsection relieves commanding officers of personal accountability under Section 15(f) or immunizes officers who planned or ordered unauthorized deployment.

---

**(f) Interim Operational Restrictions.** During the period between activation of counter-deployment authority and judicial resolution:

- (1) federal forces that are already deployed may secure positions held at the time of activation but may not seize additional territory, facilities, or infrastructure. For purposes of this paragraph, "positions held" means the physical perimeter of installations, facilities, checkpoints, and occupied structures controlled by federal forces at the moment counter-deployment authority was activated. Expansion beyond that perimeter, including establishment of new checkpoints, occupation of additional buildings, or extension of patrol areas, constitutes seizure;
- (2) federal forces may not arrest, detain, or exercise law enforcement authority over civilians;
- (3) federal forces may not interfere with the operations of Regional, State, or local government, including courts, legislatures, and election administration;
- (4) federal forces may not obstruct communications between government officials, between officials and the public, or between counter-deployment forces and courts;
- (5) violations of this subsection by federal personnel constitute independent grounds for court-martial under Section 15(f).

---

**(g) Expedited Congressional Notification.** Notwithstanding Section 7(a) of this Article:

- (1) any domestic deployment of federal armed forces shall be reported to the Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate within six (6) hours of the deployment order, or within two (2) hours of counter-deployment activation, whichever is earlier;
- (2) the notification shall include copies of Two-Key authorization documentation, or an explicit statement that Two-Key authorization was not obtained, with the reasons therefor;
- (3) failure to provide Two-Key documentation within six hours constitutes prima facie evidence that the deployment is unauthorized under subsection (a)(1)(iv), and authorizes the Speaker or President pro tempore to invoke counter-key authority under Section 9 and counter-deployment activation under subsection (b)(4);
- (4) production of Two-Key documentation that is materially false, forged, or fabricated constitutes a federal crime punishable by imprisonment, and does not satisfy the documentation requirement of this subsection. The Allocation Review Board or the Supreme Court may independently verify the authenticity of Two-Key documentation.

---

**(h) Two-Stage Judicial Review.** Any Governor may petition the Supreme Court for emergency review of the constitutional authorization for any domestic deployment of federal armed forces. Review proceeds in two stages:

**Stage 1: Automatic Freeze and Preliminary Order.**

- (1) upon the filing of a petition by any Governor of a jurisdiction in which federal forces are deployed or toward which federal forces are moving, a Temporary Restraining Order automatically issues, freezing all federal and counter-deployment forces in their current positions and prohibiting the seizure of new territory, facilities, or infrastructure by either side. The interim operational restrictions of subsection (f) apply with full force upon issuance. A Governor who files a petition under this subsection without reasonable basis to believe federal forces are deployed in or moving toward the petitioner's jurisdiction is subject to the sanctions of subsection (j);
- (2) the Supreme Court shall convene and issue a Preliminary Order within seventy-two (72) hours of petition. The Preliminary Order shall determine whether the deployment is "likely authorized" or "likely unauthorized" based on the documentation and arguments presented;
- (3) if the Court determines the deployment is "likely unauthorized," the Preliminary Order shall direct the commencement of withdrawal within twelve (12) hours and substantial completion of withdrawal within forty-eight (48) hours;
- (4) if the Court determines the deployment is "likely authorized," the Preliminary Order shall direct counter-deployment forces to begin standing down within twenty-four (24) hours, pending the full ruling;
- (5) if the Supreme Court cannot convene within seventy-two (72) hours due to procedural obstruction, recusal, or quorum failure, the Allocation Review Board or five or more Regional Governors acting jointly shall reconfirm the activation determination every seventy-two (72) hours until the Court convenes. Failure to reconfirm terminates counter-deployment authority.

**Stage 2: Full Merits Ruling.**

- (6) the Supreme Court shall issue a full ruling on the merits within fourteen (14) days of the Preliminary Order;
- (7) a finding of unauthorized deployment on the merits requires immediate and complete withdrawal. Failure to commence withdrawal within twelve (12) hours of the full ruling:
    - (i) authorizes counter-deployment activation under subsection (b)(3) if not already activated;
    - (ii) constitutes contempt of the Supreme Court and grounds for Systemic Executive Breach certification under Section 10;
    - (iii) triggers the Judicial Key Override pathway under Section 10;
- (8) a finding of authorized deployment on the merits requires counter-deployment forces to stand down within twenty-four (24) hours. Failure to stand down constitutes abuse of counter-deployment authority subject to review under subsection (i)(4);
- (9) this two-stage review supplements and does not replace counter-key authority under Section 9 or the standard judicial review provisions of this Article.

---

**(i) Post-Crisis Adjudication.** Following the resolution of any counter-deployment activation:

- (1) a Special Civil-Military Review Tribunal shall be convened within thirty (30) days, consisting of:
    - (i) three retired federal judges, at least one of whom shall have served on the Supreme Court or a federal Court of Appeals, selected by lot from a standing roster maintained by the Judicial Conference. Roster eligibility requires a minimum of ten (10) years of federal judicial service, departure from the bench under non-adverse circumstances, and retirement within the preceding fifteen (15) years;
    - (ii) two retired general officers who have served as combatant commanders or members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, selected by lot from a standing roster maintained by the Department of Defense Inspector General. Roster eligibility requires a minimum of five (5) years of general officer service, departure under non-adverse circumstances, and retirement within the preceding fifteen (15) years;
    - (iii) no member of the Tribunal may have served in any governmental capacity within the preceding five years, have been appointed to any position by the President whose deployment is under review, or have any personal or financial connection to the parties involved;
- (2) the Tribunal shall conclude its review within one hundred eighty (180) days and shall publish interim findings at ninety (90) days. The review shall determine:
    - (i) whether the original federal deployment was constitutionally authorized;
    - (ii) whether the counter-deployment activation was justified;
    - (iii) whether either side exceeded authorized force or violated rules of engagement;
    - (iv) whether federal personnel were treated in accordance with subsection (e);
- (3) **If the deployment was unauthorized:** the commanding officer of the deployed forces shall be referred for mandatory court-martial under Section 15(f), and officials who ordered the deployment shall be referred to Congress for impeachment proceedings or to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution;
- (4) **If the deployment was authorized:** Regional or State officials who activated counter-deployment shall be reviewed for abuse of authority. Officials who activated counter-deployment in bad faith or without reasonable basis shall be removed from office and permanently disqualified from holding any federal, Regional, or State office;
- (5) **Mutual fault.** If both the deployment and the counter-deployment response involved unauthorized actions, the Tribunal shall make independent findings as to each and recommend proportional accountability;
- (6) the review findings shall be published in full and transmitted to Congress, the President, and all Regional Governors within thirty (30) days of conclusion.

---

**(j) Frivolous Activation and Abuse.** To prevent misuse of counter-deployment authority as a tool of political obstruction:

- (1) any Governor who activates counter-deployment authority without reasonable basis to believe a deployment is unauthorized as defined in subsection (a) shall be subject to removal from office and permanent disqualification from federal, Regional, or State office;
- (2) if the Special Tribunal under subsection (i) finds that counter-deployment was activated in bad faith — including activation for the purpose of obstructing lawful federal operations, extracting political concessions, or interfering with court-ordered enforcement — the activating officials shall be referred for criminal prosecution;
- (3) a Governor who participated in a frivolous activation may not participate in future activation determinations under subsection (b)(2) for a period of five (5) years;
- (4) the existence of penalties under this subsection does not alter the presumption that activation was lawful pending judicial review. Penalties apply only upon a final finding by the Special Tribunal or a court of competent jurisdiction.

---

**(k) Anti-Gaming Provisions.** To prevent circumvention of this section:

- (1) **Documentation fraud.** Production of Two-Key authorization documentation that is materially false, forged, or fabricated constitutes a federal crime. The ARB or Supreme Court may independently verify the authenticity of Two-Key documentation through direct communication with key holders. A Governor whose signature appears on Two-Key documentation may disavow the signature, triggering immediate activation authority under subsection (b)(2);
- (2) **Selective compliance.** A withdrawal order under subsection (h)(3) or (h)(7) requires withdrawal of all deployed forces within the specified timeline. Partial withdrawal designed to maintain de facto control while nominally complying shall be treated as non-compliance for purposes of contempt and Systemic Executive Breach certification;
- (3) **Court obstruction.** Procedural tactics designed to prevent the Supreme Court from convening — including coordinated recusals, manufactured quorum failures, or interference with Justices' ability to travel or communicate — constitute obstruction of justice and grounds for impeachment. If the Court cannot convene within seventy-two (72) hours, the reconfirmation mechanism of subsection (h)(5) ensures continuity of counter-deployment authority;
- (4) **Mission creep.** A deployment authorized for a specific purpose under valid Two-Key authorization that subsequently expands beyond the authorized scope, mission, or geographic area constitutes an unauthorized deployment under subsection (a)(1)(v) as to the excess. Counter-deployment authority may be activated against the unauthorized component without affecting the authorized component, provided counter-deployment forces can operationally distinguish the two;
- (5) **Cross-reference to digital force.** The prohibitions and procedures of this section apply to cyber-kinetic operations meeting the domestic force threshold under Section 11 of this Article. A cyber-kinetic operation that would constitute unauthorized domestic force under Section 11 may trigger counter-deployment authority through the activation mechanisms of subsection (b).

---

### 3B. Additions to Article XI, Section 15

The following subsections are added to Section 15 (Officer Corps Independence):

---

**(i) Chain of Command Integrity.** To prevent the creation of parallel command structures that bypass officer independence protections, the following restrictions apply to domestic deployments and to command decisions affecting domestic deployment:

- (1) no officer may be inserted into the chain of command for domestic operations outside normal succession procedures established by law and regulation;
- (2) no officer may be given direct operational authority over units assigned to domestic operations that are not formally assigned to their command;
- (3) no officer may issue orders to units assigned to domestic operations bypassing the established chain of command, and subordinates receiving such orders have no duty to obey them;
- (4) acting or temporary command designations for domestic operations that circumvent Senate-confirmed appointments are void unless made during the temporary absence of the designated commander for a period not exceeding fourteen (14) days due to medical incapacitation, approved leave, or operational assignment elsewhere. Command vacancies exceeding fourteen days shall be filled through Senate confirmation or through the normal statutory succession;
- (5) the creation of "special task forces," "advisory groups," or other organizational units reporting directly to the President or White House staff that exercise operational command authority over armed forces personnel in domestic operations is prohibited. No civilian official other than the President or the Senate-confirmed Secretary of Defense may exercise operational command authority over armed forces, and delegation of such authority to National Security Advisors, Special Envoys, White House Counsel, or other staff positions is void;
- (6) this subsection does not restrict the creation of joint task forces, combined commands, or advisory structures for foreign military operations conducted under valid authorization from Congress.

---

**(j) Court of Military Appeals Review.** Any officer removed from command, reassigned, or subjected to adverse action under circumstances suggesting loyalty-based motivation:

- (1) may petition the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces for expedited review;
- (2) the Court shall rule within thirty (30) days of petition;
- (3) if the Court finds the removal or adverse action was motivated by the officer's refusal to pledge personal loyalty, refusal of an unlawful order, or exercise of constitutional duty, the officer shall be reinstated immediately;
- (4) any removal found to be loyalty-based under this subsection shall count toward the mass removal trigger under subsection (c) and the cumulative threshold under subsection (k), regardless of whether the officer held general rank;
- (5) the Inspector General of the Department of Defense shall investigate any pattern of loyalty-based removals and report findings to the Senate Armed Services Committee within sixty (60) days.

---

**(k) Cumulative Mass Removal Threshold.** In addition to the fixed trigger under subsection (c), a mass removal review is triggered if:

- (1) cumulative removals or reassignments of general officers exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the general officer corps during a single presidential term, excluding routine retirements, voluntary resignations, and end-of-tour rotations certified as non-adverse by the service branch Chief of Staff;
- (2) cumulative removals or reassignments exceed twenty percent (20%) of officers in any single combatant command during any twelve-month period, excluding routine rotations certified as non-adverse;
- (3) the Senate Armed Services Committee, by a two-thirds vote of its membership, and confirmed by the Allocation Review Board (or equivalent oversight body), determines that a pattern of removals, though individually below threshold, constitutes a coordinated effort to reshape command loyalty.

---

### 3C. Article XI-RF Compatibility Clause Update

The Compatibility Clause of Article XI-RF (Regional Guard Forces) shall be updated to add:

- counter-deployment operations protocol (Section 16) uses Regional Governors for activation and Regional Guard for counter-deployment

And the following adaptation note shall be added:

> If the Military Civilian Control Amendment is adopted alongside Regional Federalism:
>
> - Counter-Deployment Operations Protocol (Section 16) activation under subsection (b)(2) uses "three or more Regional Governors" rather than "majority of State Governors"
> - Counter-deployment forces are Regional Guard Forces under Article XI-RF, Section 1, supplemented by State National Guard units at State Governor request
> - Post-crisis adjudication under Section 16(i) is conducted by the Special Civil-Military Review Tribunal as specified in that subsection
> - The Allocation Review Board participates in activation determinations (Section 16(b)(1)), documentation verification (Section 16(k)(1)), and cumulative removal review confirmation (Section 15(k)(3))

---

## 4. Design Rationale

| New Provision | Problem Addressed | Gaming Vector Closed |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Authorization status definition (16(a)) | Ambiguity about what "unauthorized" means | Documentation spoof; mission-label evasion |
| Activation determination (16(b)) | No clear trigger for response | Frozen standoff: no one authorizes response |
| Affected-jurisdiction requirement (16(b)(2)) | Distant governors triggering frivolous activation | Political obstruction via counter-deployment |
| Authorized actions with nuclear exclusion (16(c)) | Unclear scope; nuclear escalation risk | Guard hesitation; accidental nuclear incident |
| Rules of engagement (16(d)) | Risk of escalation to civil conflict | Fait accompli: either side escalates |
| Federal personnel status with O-6+ duty (16(e)) | Misled troops; senior officer accountability gap | Disciplinary cascade; willful blindness defense |
| Interim restrictions with position definition (16(f)) | Deployed forces expand during delay | Territory seizure during legal process |
| Expedited notification with fraud penalty (16(g)) | Consolidation before Congress informed | Documentation forgery; delay exploitation |
| Two-stage judicial review (16(h)) | Courts too slow; merits sacrificed for speed | Fait accompli outlasting legal process |
| Automatic freeze on filing (16(h)(1)) | Forces advance while petition pending | 18-hour deployment vs. 48-hour ruling gap |
| Reconfirmation mechanism (16(h)(5)) | Court obstruction defeats protocol | Coordinated recusals; quorum sabotage |
| Special Tribunal (16(i)) | ARB lacks military expertise | Post-crisis review lacks credibility |
| Frivolous activation penalties (16(j)) | Counter-deployment as political weapon | Secessionist or obstructionist misuse |
| Anti-gaming provisions (16(k)) | Multiple evasion vectors | Doc fraud; selective stand-down; mission creep |
| Chain of command integrity (15(i)) | Parallel command bypasses protections | Shadow commanders; civilian advisor orders |
| Domestic scoping (15(i)(6)) | Overly broad rules disrupt foreign JTFs | Lawful foreign operations impaired |
| Court of Military Appeals review (15(j)) | Removed officers lack expedited recourse | Slow appeal allows purge to consolidate |
| Cumulative mass removal (15(k)) | Fixed threshold gamed by slow-roll purge | 5-per-61-day cycle; 9.9% per year |
| Senate committee + ARB confirmation (15(k)(3)) | Partisan misuse of committee trigger | Politicized mass removal review |

---

## 5. Integration Notes

### Placement

- **Section 16** follows Section 15 (Officer Corps Independence) in Article XI. This maintains logical flow: Section 15 establishes the protections; Section 16 establishes what happens when they fail.
- **Section 15(i)-(k)** extend the existing officer independence provisions in Section 15.
- **Article XI-RF Compatibility Clause** receives a minor update; no changes to Article XI-RF body text.

### Cross-References Created

- Section 16(a)(2) references Section 11 (digital force equivalence)
- Section 16(a)(3) references Section 3 (Two-Key authorization)
- Section 16(b)(1) references the ARB (Article X-RF or equivalent)
- Section 16(b)(3) references Section 16(h) (two-stage judicial review)
- Section 16(b)(4) references Section 9 (counter-key authority)
- Section 16(g)(3) references Section 9 (counter-key authority)
- Section 16(g)(3) references Section 16(b)(4) (activation determination)
- Section 16(g)(4) parallels Section 16(k)(1) (documentation fraud)
- Section 16(h)(7)(ii) references Section 10 (Judicial Key Override)
- Section 16(i)(3) references Section 15(f) (commander accountability)
- Section 16(k)(5) references Section 11 (digital force equivalence)
- Section 15(j)(4) references Section 15(c) and 15(k) (mass removal triggers)
- Section 15(k)(3) references ARB confirmation

### Relationship to Existing Provisions

| Existing Provision | Relationship |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Section 3 (Two-Key) | Foundation: Section 16 enforces Section 3's authorization requirement |
| Section 9 (Counter-Key) | Sequential: Section 9 suspends orders pre-deployment; Section 16 addresses forces already deployed |
| Section 10 (Judicial Key Override) | Escalation: Section 16(h)(7)(ii) feeds into Section 10 if withdrawal order is defied |
| Section 11 (Digital Force) | Parallel: Section 16(k)(5) extends protocol to cyber-kinetic operations meeting Section 11 threshold |
| Section 14 (Congressional Key Override) | Parallel: Congressional override addresses collusion; Section 16 addresses unilateral action |
| Section 15 (Officer Independence) | Foundation: Section 15 establishes protections; Section 16 operationalizes response when protections fail |
| Art XI-RF, Section 2(d)-(e) | Complements: Section 2 addresses Governor refusal of federalization; Section 16 addresses Governor-initiated counter-deployment |

### What This Does NOT Address

- **Congressional complicity**: If Congress is itself captured, the Congressional notification and override provisions are moot; this is a recognized systemic limit (Gap 1)
- **Nuclear command authority**: This protocol does not extend to nuclear weapons command, which remains solely federal (and nuclear assets are explicitly excluded from counter-deployment operations)
- **Foreign military intervention**: This protocol applies only to domestic deployment of US armed forces, not to foreign military operations

---

## 6. Open Questions (Resolved)

The v1 draft posed 8 review questions. Both external reviews responded. Disposition:

| # | Question | Resolution |
|---|----------|------------|
| Q1 | Threshold calibration (3 governors) | **Split decision.** R1: too low. R2: appropriate. Resolved by requiring affected-jurisdiction governor + keeping 3-governor minimum. Added frivolous activation penalties. |
| Q2 | Authorized actions scope (detention) | **Consensus: narrow.** Both reviews flagged detention risk. Revised to limit custody to surrendered/defecting personnel and those actively obstructing government. Added nuclear exclusion per R2. |
| Q3 | 48-hour judicial review | **Consensus: two-stage.** R1 proposed 48h preliminary + 7d merits. R2 proposed auto-freeze + 72h preliminary + 14d merits. Adopted R2's auto-freeze + 72h preliminary + 14d full ruling. |
| Q4 | Post-crisis adjudication body | **Consensus: not ARB.** R1 suggested judicial body or independent commission. R2 proposed Special Tribunal (retired justices + retired Joint Chiefs). Adopted Special Tribunal with selection by lot. |
| Q5 | Slow-roll purge threshold | **Consensus: gameable.** R1 proposed routine-rotation filter. R2 proposed cumulative per term at 15%. Adopted both: cumulative 15%/term with routine-rotation exclusion. |
| Q6 | Federal personnel treatment | **Consensus: appropriate.** Both accepted "materially misled" presumption. Added O-6+ duty-to-inquire per R1 question and R2 implicit support. |
| Q7 | Interaction with Section 9 | **Consensus: clear.** R2 confirmed sequential relationship. R1 agreed no conflict. No change needed. |
| Q8 | Missing gaming vectors | **Identified 4 new vectors.** R1: documentation spoof, court delay capture, selective stand-down. R2: human shield deployment. All addressed in new subsections (g)(4), (h)(5), (k)(1)-(5). |

## 7. Convergence Analysis

### Changes from v1 to v2

**New subsections:**

| Provision | Source | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| 16(a) Definitions | R1 (HIGH) | "Unauthorized deployment" was undefined; invites escalation |
| 16(a)(3) Mission-label test | R2 (gaming vector) | "Human shield" deployment via humanitarian label |
| 16(c)(10) Nuclear exclusion | R2 (HIGH) | Counter-deployment near nuclear sites risks catastrophic escalation |
| 16(e) Duty to inquire (O-6+) | R1/R2 (review question) | Senior officers should not benefit from willful blindness |
| 16(g)(4) Documentation fraud | R1 (gaming vector) | "Documentation spoof" closes forged Two-Key papers |
| 16(h) Two-stage review | R1+R2 (MEDIUM+MEDIUM) | Replaces unrealistic 48-hour merits ruling |
| 16(h)(1) Automatic freeze | R2 (MEDIUM) | Prevents 18-hour fait accompli before Court rules |

| 16(j) Frivolous activation | R1 (recommendation) | Bad-faith penalty balances low activation threshold |
| 16(k) Anti-gaming | R1+R2 (gaming vectors) | Addresses documentation fraud, selective stand-down, court obstruction, mission creep, cyber bypass |

**Revised subsections:**

| Provision | Change | Source |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| 16(b)(2) Activation | Added affected-jurisdiction requirement | R1 (HIGH) |
| 16(b)(4) Speaker/PPT | Relegated to backup when ARB cannot convene | R1 (HIGH) |
| 16(c)(1) Checkpoints | Added civilian bypass route requirement | R1 (HIGH: civilian movement contradiction) |
| 16(c)(4)-(5) Detention | Narrowed to surrendered/defecting + obstructing government | R2 (CRITICAL) |
| 16(d)(3) Documentation | Replaced "continuous to Chief Justice" with secure recording + 24h upload to DoD IG | R1 (MEDIUM) |
| 16(d)(5) Civilian protection | Added "except as incidental to military interdiction" | R1 (HIGH: contradiction fix) |
| 16(e)(5) Habeas | Added federal magistrate + 24-hour presentment | R1 (MEDIUM) |
| 16(f)(1) Position definition | Added explicit definition of "positions held" | R1 (MEDIUM) |
| 16(h)(3)/(7) Withdrawal | Changed to "commence 12h, substantial completion 48h" | R1 (recommendation) |
| 15(i) Chain of command | Scoped to domestic; extended acting limit to 14 days; closed civilian advisor loophole | R1 (MEDIUM) + R2 (HIGH) |
| 15(k) Mass removal | Changed to cumulative per term; added routine-rotation exclusion; required 2/3 committee + ARB | R2 (MEDIUM) + R1 (MEDIUM) |

### Disagreements Adjudicated

| Issue | R1 Position | R2 Position | Resolution |
|-------|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Activation threshold | Too low; raise to 5-governor supermajority | 3 governors appropriate | Keep 3 but require affected jurisdiction + add penalties |
| Detention authority | Needs clearer judicial handoff | Must eliminate for active forces | Narrowed to surrendered/obstructing only + 24h magistrate |
| Judicial timeline | 48h preliminary + 7d merits | Auto-freeze + 72h preliminary + 14d merits | Adopted R2 structure (more operationally realistic) |
| Post-crisis body | Judicial body or independent commission | Special Tribunal (retired justices + Joint Chiefs) | Adopted R2's structure (combines both) |
| Mass removal metric | "Not in routine rotation cycle" | Cumulative 15% per presidential term | Combined both approaches |
| Chain of command scope | Narrow to domestic deployments | Close civilian advisor loophole | Applied both fixes |
| Acting command duration | Keep 72 hours | Not addressed | Extended to 14 days per R1 (medical/operational realism) |
