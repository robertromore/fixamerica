# Gap 70 — Administrative Attrition via Civil Service Purge

## Draft Constitutional Text: Article V, Section 6

**Version:** v3 FINAL
**Date:** 2026-02-04
**Status:** Final — Ready for Integration

---

## Gap Description

Many Federal, Regional, and State agencies share civil service talent or use inter-level liaisons. The framework does not prevent one level of government from weaponizing personnel rules to drain experienced administrators from another level — effectively "lobotomizing" governance through talent extraction rather than direct confrontation.

The core vulnerability is asymmetric: a level with greater resources (typically Federal) can systematically degrade another level's administrative capacity by:

1. **Poaching campaigns:** Targeted salary increases to recruit experienced Regional/State administrators, hollowing out coordination functions.
2. **Security clearance weaponization:** Revoking or denying clearances for employees who serve at another level, cutting off inter-level cooperation.
3. **Loyalty test exclusion:** Requiring attestations or conditions that preclude serving at another level of government.
4. **Seniority reset trap:** Imposing loss of all accumulated service credit upon inter-level transfer, creating a one-way talent flow.

Existing provisions address pension portability (Art I §8), professional licensing (Art I §9, §14), and federal merit system protection (Art II §11). What remains unaddressed is the **inter-level dimension** — protections for government employees who move between federal, Regional, and State service, and accountability for coordinated talent extraction campaigns.

## Pre-Existing Coverage Analysis

| Document | Provision | What It Covers | What Remains Uncovered |
|----------|-----------|----------------|------------------------|
| Art II, §11 | Merit System Protection | Federal civil service: for-cause removal, 4,000 political appointment ceiling, anti-circumvention (no reclassification, loyalty oaths, hiring freezes), transition protection, MSPB enforcement | Federal only; no inter-level mobility framework; no Regional/State equivalent mandate |
| Art I, §8(q)-(u) | Benefit Portability | Pensions, health trusts, educational accounts, deferred compensation fully portable across Regions/States; 5-year max vesting; anti-retention gaming; treble damages | Pension/benefit portability covered; non-pension service credits (seniority, leave accrual, tenure) NOT portable across levels |
| Art I, §9 | Professional Licensing Portability | Credential recognition across jurisdictions; fee parity; 30-day processing; interim practice; anti-retaliation; federal practice credential fallback | Licensing portability covered; security clearance reciprocity NOT addressed |
| Art I, §14 | Professional Credential Protection | No license suspension/revocation based on federal service; anti-retaliation; personal liability; federal preemption for pattern violations | Protects against licensing weaponization; does NOT protect against clearance weaponization or inter-level employment retaliation beyond licensing |
| Art X, §20 | Pension Discipline | Actuarial funding requirements; ensures pension systems remain solvent | Supports pension portability; no provisions for inter-level service credit recognition |
| Art IX, §6(d)(3) | Lobbying Reform | Denial of security clearances as prohibited retaliation in lobbying context | Narrow; does not extend to inter-level employment context |

**Bottom line:** Pension/benefit portability and professional licensing are well-covered by existing provisions. The gap is specifically in: (1) non-pension service credit portability across government levels, (2) security clearance reciprocity and protection against weaponized revocation, (3) inter-level transfer rights and return guarantees, (4) anti-poaching protections against systematic talent extraction campaigns, and (5) intergovernmental personnel exchange framework.

## Proposed Constitutional Text

### Section 6. Inter-Level Civil Service Mobility and Protection

*Addresses Gap 70: Administrative Attrition via Civil Service Purge. Establishes inter-level service credit portability, security clearance reciprocity, inter-level transfer rights, anti-poaching protections, and intergovernmental personnel exchange to prevent talent weaponization between levels of government.*

**(a) Service Credit Portability.**

- (1) All years of public service at any level of government — federal, Regional, or State — shall count toward seniority, leave accrual, tenure eligibility, and retirement eligibility at every other level. Service credits shall transfer automatically upon inter-level appointment. Retirement eligibility credit shall operate through the pension portability mechanics of Article I, Section 8; this paragraph does not create pension obligations independent of that section. `[v3: S11 — retirement eligibility aligned with Art I §8]` Tenure eligibility based on transferred service credits does not exempt the employee from any probationary evaluation or performance review required by the receiving level for newly appointed employees at equivalent grade. `[v2: S3 — local probation preserved]`
- (2) The Independent Fiscal Council shall publish and maintain equivalence tables for grade, rank, step, and seniority across federal, Regional, and State civil service systems. No level of government may impose grade or step reductions upon an employee transferring from another level who held an equivalent position as determined by the IFC equivalence tables.
- (3) An employee transferring between levels shall not experience a gap in health, disability, or life insurance coverage exceeding thirty (30) calendar days. The receiving level shall provide interim coverage during any administrative processing period. The cost of interim coverage shall be borne by the receiving level.
- (4) Non-pension service credits — including accrued leave, sabbatical eligibility, professional development entitlements, and tenure-clock credit — shall transfer on the same basis as pension credits under Article I, Section 8. Upon transfer, the originating level shall remit to the receiving level the actuarial value of all transferred non-pension service credits, as calculated by the Independent Fiscal Council. The IFC shall publish standard actuarial tables for this purpose. `[v2: S6 — actuarial liability transfer]`

**(b) Inter-Level Transfer Rights.**

- (1) No level of government may penalize, retaliate against, or impose adverse employment consequences upon an employee for applying to, accepting, or performing service at another level of government.
- (2) An employee who transfers to another level of government shall have the right to return to the originating level within twenty-four (24) months with restored seniority, grade, and step. If no position at equivalent grade is immediately available, the originating level shall reinstate the employee in a supernumerary capacity at equivalent grade for up to twelve (12) months while a permanent position is identified. Simultaneous supernumerary positions at any single agency shall not exceed two percent (2%) of the agency's authorized permanent positions; employees whose return would exceed this cap shall be placed directly on a priority reemployment list. `[v3: S12 — 2% supernumerary cap]` If no permanent position materializes within twelve (12) months, the employee shall be placed on a priority reemployment list with preference over external candidates at equivalent grade. `[v2: S7 — supernumerary reinstatement]`
- (3) No level of government may impose non-compete clauses, mandatory waiting periods, or "cooling off" periods that restrict inter-level employment mobility.
- (4) No level of government may require, as a condition of employment or continued employment, any attestation, oath, or agreement — other than the constitutional oath of office — that would preclude the employee from simultaneously holding credentials for service at another level or from applying for positions at another level. This prohibition does not preclude role-specific conflict-of-interest restrictions for employees with active operational access to classified intelligence sources and methods, employees exercising judicial authority, or employees with active procurement contracting authority, provided that such restrictions are limited to the duration of the specific role assignment and do not extend to general inter-level mobility upon reassignment or departure from the role. `[v2: S2 — narrow conflict-of-interest carve-out]`

**(c) Security Clearance Reciprocity.**

- (1) Security clearances issued by one level of government shall be recognized at all other levels for access to information at the same or lower classification level, provided that the issuing level adjudicates clearances under standards no less stringent than the corresponding federal standard. A receiving agency may require supplemental briefing for program-specific access but may not require re-investigation or new adjudication based solely on the employee's level of government employment. Disputes regarding clearance-standard equivalence shall be resolved by the National Constitutional Court. `[v3: S9 — federal-standard floor with NCC equivalence disputes]`
- (2) No security clearance may be revoked, suspended, or downgraded based on the employee's current or prior level of government employment, or on the employee's application for or acceptance of a position at another level.
- (3) Inter-level clearance transfer processing shall be completed within thirty (30) calendar days of the employee's transfer. If the receiving level has not completed processing within thirty (30) days, the employee shall be granted interim access at the previously cleared level pending completion, unless the receiving level has documented, specific, and articulable grounds to believe that granting access would pose an immediate risk to national security or the safety of intelligence sources and methods. In such cases, the receiving level shall file a sealed statement with the National Constitutional Court within five (5) business days, and the Court shall review the hold within fifteen (15) calendar days. If the Court does not sustain the hold within fifteen (15) days, interim access shall be granted automatically. `[v2: S1 — security risk hold exception with NCC review]`
- (4) Classified information sharing agreements between levels of government shall not impose conditions that restrict inter-level employment mobility. Any such condition is void and unenforceable.

**(d) Anti-Poaching and Administrative Capacity Protection.**

- (1) The Independent Fiscal Council shall publish annual salary and total compensation benchmarks for equivalent positions across federal, Regional, and State civil service systems.
- (2) Targeted recruitment by one level of government of employees from another level's defined agency or functional area is presumptively an act of administrative warfare if, within any twelve (12) month period, the recruiting level extends formal written offers of employment to more than ten percent (10%) of the target agency's or functional area's career workforce, and the recruitment is concentrated rather than incidental. For purposes of this paragraph: "career workforce" means full-time, non-political-appointment employees who have completed probationary service; "concentrated" means that the offers are directed at employees within the same agency, bureau, division, or functional specialty rather than distributed across the target level's civil service generally; and "incidental" means resulting from routine, publicly posted vacancy announcements without targeted outreach to the specific agency or functional area. `[v2: S4 — defined terms]`
- (3) The Allocation Review Board may investigate and adopt an "Administrative Warfare" finding where one level of government engages in a coordinated pattern of actions — including but not limited to targeted recruitment, clearance manipulation, funding conditions that require personnel restructuring, or regulatory actions targeting another level's employees — intended to or having the effect of materially degrading another level's administrative capacity.
- (4) The ARB shall adopt an Administrative Warfare finding by majority vote of its non-vacant members, provided that no fewer than three (3) members participate in the vote.
- (5) Upon an Administrative Warfare finding:
    - (i) the ARB shall order the offending level to cease the identified conduct;
    - (ii) the offending level shall compensate the affected level for documented recruitment and training costs incurred to replace lost personnel, calculated by the IFC;
    - (iii) officials who knowingly directed or authorized the coordinated campaign shall be personally liable for damages and subject to referral for disciplinary proceedings at their level; an official is not personally liable under this clause for routine, non-coordinated hiring decisions made in the ordinary course of filling vacancies; `[v2: S5 — mens rea standard + safe harbor]`
    - (iv) the finding shall be published and reported to the relevant legislatures.
- (6) An Administrative Warfare finding is subject to expedited judicial review before the National Constitutional Court, limited to procedural regularity and whether the factual predicates of paragraphs (2) and (3) were satisfied. The Court shall render its decision within thirty (30) calendar days of the petition for review.

**(e) Intergovernmental Personnel Exchange.**

- (1) Congress shall establish by law a voluntary Intergovernmental Personnel Exchange Program enabling temporary details of career employees between federal, Regional, and State agencies. Exchange details shall not exceed three (3) years unless renewed by mutual agreement.
- (2) An employee on inter-level exchange shall retain home-level benefits, seniority accrual, retirement contributions, and all protections of this section. The exchange employee shall be subject to the workplace rules and supervision of the host agency for operational purposes.
- (3) Exchange service shall count toward career advancement, professional development requirements, and tenure at the home level on the same basis as home-level service.
- (4) In a declared emergency under Article XVII or equivalent Regional/State authority, any level of government may request personnel assistance from other levels. Responding employees retain all protections of this section and shall not be deemed to have transferred for purposes of subsection (b)(2).

**(f) Coordination.**

- (1) This section supplements the merit system protections of Article II, Section 11. Where both sections apply to the same employee, the more protective provision governs.
- (2) The pension and benefit portability provisions of Article I, Section 8 apply independently of this section. This section extends portability to non-pension service credits not covered by Article I, Section 8.
- (3) The professional licensing protections of Article I, Sections 9 and 14 apply independently of this section. This section extends reciprocity to security clearances, which are not covered by Article I, Sections 9 or 14.
- (4) No provision of this section shall be construed to override the political appointment ceiling of Article II, Section 11(b) at the federal level. Regional and State governments shall establish by their constitutions or by law a ceiling on political appointments that ensures a merit-protected career civil service. The maximum ratio of political appointments to total civilian government positions at each Regional or State level shall not exceed the ratio that Article II, Section 11(b) establishes at the federal level, as calculated by the Independent Fiscal Council based on the federal ceiling and total federal civilian workforce. `[v3: S10 — IFC-calculated ratio]` Regions and States may structure their political appointments differently from the federal model provided they meet this minimum merit-protection floor. `[v2: S8 — structural autonomy]`

## Gaming Vector Analysis

| # | Vector | Mechanism | How §6 Addresses |
|---|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| 1 | Pension Hostage Purge | Federal rule prevents persons with Federal pensions from working for Regions | Pre-existing: Art I §8(q)-(u) pension portability. §6(a) extends to non-pension service credits. |
| 2 | Security Clearance Revocation | Clearances revoked for employees who serve Regional projects | §6(c)(2): no revocation based on level of employment; §6(c)(1): reciprocity across levels |
| 3 | Professional Licensing Squeeze | Licenses threatened for working at another level | Pre-existing: Art I §14 professional credential protection. §6(f)(3): clearance reciprocity complements. |
| 4 | Poaching Campaign | Systematic salary increases targeting Regional/State personnel to hollow out capacity | §6(d)(1)-(2): IFC salary benchmarks + 10% presumption of administrative warfare |
| 5 | Loyalty Test Exclusion | Requires attestation precluding simultaneous service credentials | §6(b)(4): prohibits attestations/oaths beyond constitutional oath that restrict inter-level mobility |
| 6 | Seniority Reset Trap | Transfer between levels results in loss of all accumulated service credit | §6(a)(1)-(2): automatic service credit transfer + IFC equivalence tables; no grade/step reductions |
| 7 | Benefits Gap Exclusion | Transition period between levels leaves employee uninsured | §6(a)(3): max 30-day gap; receiving level provides interim coverage |
| 8 | Non-Compete Lock-in | One level imposes non-compete clauses preventing movement | §6(b)(3): non-compete clauses, waiting periods, and cooling-off periods prohibited |
| 9 | Coordinated Administrative Warfare | Multiple tactics combined to systematically degrade another level's capacity | §6(d)(3)-(6): ARB Administrative Warfare finding with cessation, compensation, personal liability, NCC review |
| 10 | Clearance Information Blockade | Classified sharing agreements include conditions restricting employment mobility | §6(c)(4): mobility-restricting conditions in sharing agreements void and unenforceable |
| 11 | Return Right Frustration | Originating level eliminates returning employee's position during absence | §6(b)(2): supernumerary reinstatement for up to 12 months; priority reemployment list thereafter |
| 12 | Actuarial Dumping | Transferring employees with large accrued liabilities to smaller jurisdictions without fiscal offset | §6(a)(4): originating level remits actuarial value of transferred non-pension credits to receiving level |
| 13 | Supernumerary Abuse | Employees cycling transfers to create unfunded supernumerary positions | §6(b)(2): supernumerary limited to 12 months; 2% per-agency cap; 24-month window prevents cycling `[v3: cap added]` |
| 14 | Sensitive Role Pretext | Claiming conflict-of-interest for broad employee categories to block mobility | §6(b)(4): carve-out limited to 3 specific role types; duration-limited to role assignment; does not extend post-departure |
| 15 | Security Hold Abuse | Filing frivolous security holds to block interim access indefinitely | §6(c)(3): sealed statement within 5 business days; NCC review within 15 days; auto-grant if not sustained |
| 16 | Definition Gaming | Structuring recruitment to avoid "concentrated" trigger or dispute "career workforce" | §6(d)(2): defined terms — career workforce (full-time, non-political, post-probationary); concentrated (same agency/specialty); incidental (routine public postings) |
| 17 | Clearance Standard Dilution | Region/State creates weak classification system to bypass federal clearance requirements via reciprocity | §6(c)(1): federal-standard floor — reciprocity requires issuing level adjudicates under standards no less stringent than federal; NCC resolves disputes `[v3: new]` |
| 18 | Supernumerary Fiscal Shock | Mass simultaneous returns creating unbudgeted headcount spike at originating agency | §6(b)(2): 2% per-agency cap on simultaneous supernumerary positions; excess to priority reemployment list `[v3: new]` |

## Design Decisions

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|----------|-----------|
| DD-1 | Placed as Art V §6 (after Political Institutional Failure) | Art V covers executive branch structure. Civil service mobility is structural. Follows logically after §5 (receivership). Original proposal targeted §8; §6 is next available. |
| DD-2 | Narrowed scope from original 4-part proposal to 6 subsections | Pre-existing coverage (Art I §8 pensions, Art I §9/§14 licensing, Art II §11 merit system) eliminates redundancy. Focus on what's actually missing. |
| DD-3 | IFC equivalence tables rather than statutory mandate | Grade/rank/step structures will differ across levels. IFC expertise in fiscal/administrative benchmarking. Tables updated annually avoid constitutional rigidity. |
| DD-4 | 10% threshold for poaching presumption | Rebuttable presumption, not automatic finding. Bright-line trigger provides clarity; defined terms (v2) prevent gaming. |
| DD-5 | 24-month return right with supernumerary reinstatement | Long enough for meaningful service at receiving level; short enough to provide genuine safety net. Supernumerary (v2) ensures return right is substantive, not hollow promise. 12-month supernumerary cap prevents indefinite unfunded positions. 2% per-agency cap (v3) prevents fiscal shock from mass returns. |
| DD-6 | ARB rather than courts for Administrative Warfare finding | ARB has inter-level governance expertise and standing. NCC judicial review limited to procedural regularity — mirrors §4-D(e)(5), §4-E(d)(7), §4-F(d)(5) pattern. |
| DD-7 | Personal liability with mens rea standard for directing officials | Creates individual deterrent. "Knowingly directed or authorized" (v2) prevents chilling routine hiring while maintaining accountability for coordinated campaigns. Safe harbor for non-coordinated decisions. |
| DD-8 | "Shall establish by law" for personnel exchange program | Constitutional text establishes the mandate; implementation details left to legislation. Avoids overspecifying exchange procedures in constitutional text. |
| DD-9 | 30-day clearance transfer processing deadline with security risk hold | Mirrors Art I §9 30-day licensing recognition deadline. Security risk exception (v2) addresses legitimate concerns; NCC sealed review within 15 days prevents pretext holds. Auto-grant if not sustained preserves mobility default. |
| DD-10 | Regional/State merit-protection floor with IFC-calculated ratio | Art II §11 caps federal political appointments at 4,000 (absolute number). IFC calculates the ratio (v3) to make it applicable to different-sized jurisdictions. Regions must not exceed this ratio but may structure political appointments differently, preserving federalism while mandating minimum career civil service. |
| DD-11 | Emergency personnel assistance distinct from transfer | §6(e)(4): emergency responders are NOT deemed to have transferred, so 24-month return clock doesn't start. Prevents emergency service from triggering unintended mobility consequences. |
| DD-12 | Security clearance reciprocity with supplemental briefing exception and federal-standard floor | Reciprocity prevents weaponization; supplemental briefing allows program-specific orientation without re-investigation. Federal-standard floor (v3) prevents clearance dilution — Regions/States must adjudicate under standards no less stringent than federal. NCC resolves equivalence disputes. |
| DD-13 | Local probation preserved despite service credit transfer | Service credits accelerate eligibility but don't bypass local competence evaluation (v2). Prevents "credential laundering" where transfers are used to skip jurisdiction-specific vetting. |
| DD-14 | Actuarial liability transfer with IFC tables | Prevents fiscal dumping (v2); originating level bears cost of accrued credits. Without this, smaller jurisdictions absorb disproportionate liabilities when receiving transferred employees with large accrued leave balances. |
| DD-15 | Narrow conflict-of-interest carve-out (3 role types) | Intelligence sources/methods, judicial authority, procurement authority are genuine operational conflicts (v2). Duration-limited to role assignment — does not extend to career-wide exclusivity or post-departure restrictions. |
| DD-16 | Defined terms for anti-poaching threshold | "Career workforce" (full-time, non-political, post-probationary), "concentrated" (same agency/specialty), "incidental" (routine public postings) remove ambiguity (v2) that would enable litigation gaming or threshold evasion. "Formal written offers" rather than mere outreach or accepted transfers — documented and trackable. |
| DD-17 | NCC sealed review for security holds | Sealed statement prevents fishing expeditions (v2). 15-day deadline prevents indefinite holds. Court review limited to whether documented grounds are specific and articulable — not de novo security adjudication. |
| DD-18 | Retirement eligibility through Art I §8 pension portability mechanics | §6(a)(1) credits service toward "retirement eligibility" at all levels, but explicitly operates through Art I §8 (v3). Prevents creating unfunded pension obligations separate from the existing portable pension framework. |
| DD-19 | 2% per-agency supernumerary cap | Prevents fiscal shock from mass simultaneous returns (v3). 2% is large enough to accommodate normal return flows but small enough to prevent unbudgeted headcount spikes. Employees beyond cap go directly to priority reemployment list — return right preserved but fiscally bounded. |
| DD-20 | Federal-standard floor for clearance reciprocity rather than IFC equivalence table | Clearances are binary security determinations, not administrative rankings like grade/step (v3). Federal standards are the established baseline. IFC equivalence tables appropriate for grade/rank/step; NCC appropriate for clearance-standard disputes (legal/constitutional question, not fiscal/administrative). |

## Open Questions

All open questions resolved:

| Q# | Question | v1 Status | Resolution |
|----|----------|-----------|------------|
| Q1 | Rebuttable presumption vs. hard trigger for 10% threshold | Open (recommended A) | **Resolved v2: A confirmed.** Rebuttable presumption with defined terms. |
| Q2 | Return right period: 24, 36, or indefinite months | Open (recommended A) | **Resolved v2: A confirmed with enhancement.** 24 months + supernumerary + 2% cap (v3). |
| Q3 | Regional/State political appointment ceiling: same ratio, floor, or free choice | Open (recommended A) | **Resolved v2/v3: A modified.** IFC-calculated ratio (v3) with structural autonomy. |
| Q4 | National Public Administration Academy provision | Open (recommended A) | **Resolved v2: A confirmed.** Personnel exchange only; academy for legislation. |

No new open questions.

## Relationship to Other Gaps

| Gap | Relationship |
|-----|-------------|
| Gap 59 (State-Regional Preemption) | Proposal Available. Personnel obstruction as implementation sabotage — if one level can drain talent, it can sabotage another level's regulatory implementation. §6 addresses the personnel dimension. |
| Gap 62 (Fiscal Hollow-Out) | Resolved. Tax administration requires experienced personnel; §6 prevents talent extraction that would undermine fiscal capacity. Actuarial liability transfer prevents fiscal dumping. |
| Gap 66 (Regulatory Dumping) | Resolved. Administrative capacity needed for Regional enforcement; §6 prevents capacity degradation through personnel manipulation. |
| Gap 87 (Civil Service Protection) | Partially Mitigated. Art II §11 covers federal merit system; Gap 87 addresses broader political interference. §6 focuses on the inter-level dimension. §6(f)(4) extends merit-protection floor concept to Regional/State with IFC-calculated ratio. |
| Gap 106 (Quorum Trap) | Resolved. §4-E addresses institutional paralysis through absence; §6 addresses institutional degradation through talent loss. Different mechanism, parallel threat. |
