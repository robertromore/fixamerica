# Gap 109 Resolution: Article I, Section 11 Expansion

## Status: FINAL (v3)

**Resolves:** Gap 109 (Resource Hoarding via Regional Environmental Protection)

**Severity:** Medium

**Date:** 2026-02-03

**Revision:** v3 FINAL — incorporates Round 2 fixes (1 reviewer, 5 findings on v2)

**Target:** Article I-RF, Section 11 — new subsections (k) through (m), appended after existing (j)

**Note on Proposal Section Reference:** The Gap 109 proposal targets "Article I-RF, Section 10(g-o)." However, Section 10 in the current constitutional text is Data Sovereignty and Critical Governance Data. The correct target is Section 11 (Environmental Border Protection), which covers environmental standards, transboundary harm, and shared ecosystem protection. Existing subsections (a)-(j) address direct environmental harm (a)-(d) and cumulative harm/shared ecosystems (e)-(j). The new subsections address the reverse problem: pretextual use of environmental authority to hoard resources.

**Placement Rationale:** Gap 109 addresses a specific gaming vector within Art I §11's "Floors Not Ceilings" environmental framework: §11(c) permits Regions to "establish more protective standards provided they do not discriminate against interstate commerce," but provides no mechanism to detect or remedy pretextual environmental standards designed to hoard shared natural resources rather than protect the environment. The existing §11(e)-(j) framework addresses cumulative environmental *harm* (pollution flowing outward); Gap 109 addresses the mirror problem of pretextual environmental *protection* (resources blocked from flowing outward). The new subsections complete Art I §11 as a three-layer framework: direct harm prevention (a)-(d), cumulative harm management (e)-(j), and pretextual regulation prevention (k)-(m).

## Pre-Existing Coverage Analysis

Before drafting new text, each gaming vector from the Gap 109 proposal was assessed against existing constitutional provisions:

### Gaming Vector 1: "Purity Standard Embargo"

| Proposed Fix | Existing Coverage | Status |
|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| Water designated as shared resource | §7(a): Interstate waters are "shared resources" with equitable apportionment | **Covered** (water only) |
| No unilateral resource capture | §7(b): No unilateral diversion/appropriation that substantially diminishes availability | **Covered** (water only) |
| Environmental standards can't discriminate | §11(c): More protective standards allowed if they don't discriminate against interstate commerce | **Partially covered** — anti-discrimination exists but no pretext-finding mechanism |
| Energy, minerals as shared resources | Not addressed | **NOT COVERED** |

### Gaming Vector 2: "Environmental Assessment Delay"

| Proposed Fix | Existing Coverage | Status |
|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| Assessment timelines | No existing provision addresses pretextual assessment delays | **NOT COVERED** |
| Primary environmental benefit test | No existing proportionality test for resource-restrictive standards | **NOT COVERED** |

### Gaming Vector 3: "Habitat Protection Lock"

| Proposed Fix | Existing Coverage | Status |
|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| Shared ecosystem identification | §11(f): Shared Ecosystem Designation by EPA (water systems, airsheds, wildlife corridors, coastal zones, aquifers) | **Partially covered** — designates ecosystems for pollution management, not for preventing pretextual habitat locks |
| Pretext finding authority | Not addressed | **NOT COVERED** |

### Gaming Vector 4: "Cumulative Impact Doctrine"

| Proposed Fix | Existing Coverage | Status |
|-------------|-------------------|--------|
| Cumulative impact framework | §11(e)-(g): Cumulative Impact Standard + Ecosystem Carrying Capacity + allocation formulas | **Reverse concern** — §11 prevents cumulative pollution harm; Gap 109 prevents using cumulative impact *claims* to block resource access |
| Proportionality analysis | Not addressed for resource-restrictive standards | **NOT COVERED** |

### Summary

| Gaming Vector | Status | Residual Risk |
|---------------|--------|---------------|
| Purity Standard Embargo | Partially closed (water via §7; anti-discrimination via §11(c)) | Significant — no pretext-finding; energy/minerals not covered |
| Environmental Assessment Delay | Open | Significant — no timeline limits or proportionality test |
| Habitat Protection Lock | Partially closed (ecosystem designation via §11(f)) | Significant — no mechanism to prevent pretextual habitat designation for resource hoarding |
| Cumulative Impact Doctrine | Open (reverse concern) | Significant — cumulative impact claims can be used to block any resource transfer |

**Conclusion:** Unlike Gap 104 where 3/4 gaming vectors were already closed, Gap 109 has substantive residual risk across all 4 vectors. The existing framework addresses the *outward* environmental problem (pollution, harm) but not the *inward* environmental problem (pretextual standards to hoard resources). Three elements are needed: (1) extension of shared resource designation beyond water to energy and minerals, (2) a pretext-finding and proportionality certification mechanism for resource-restrictive environmental standards, and (3) emergency resource access and allocation authority.

However, significant coverage does exist:

- §7(a)-(f) provides a comprehensive water-specific framework (shared resource, equitable apportionment, Water Resources Coordination Board, National Water Court) that should be cross-referenced, not duplicated
- §11(c) establishes the anti-discrimination principle that Gap 109's mechanisms enforce
- §11(f)-(g) establishes the shared ecosystem designation and carrying capacity framework that Gap 109's certification mechanism complements

The v1 draft therefore covers 3 subsections: resource-restrictive standard certification (pretext-finding), shared national resource extension, and emergency resource access.

## Round 1 Convergence Analysis

### Reviewer Summary

- **R1:** 5 findings (2 HIGH, 2 MEDIUM, 1 LOW)
- **R2:** 5 findings (2 CRITICAL, 1 HIGH, 2 MEDIUM) + 8 question recommendations + draft text improvements

### Finding Convergence

| Topic | R1 | R2 | Type | v2 Resolution |
|-------|----|----|------|---------------|
| "Resource-restrictive" definition overbroad | R1-5 (LOW) | F2 (CRITICAL) | **Convergent** | Adopt R2's "substantially limiting... material reduction in interstate availability" language. Both reviewers independently identified the same overbreadth problem; R2's formulation is more precise. |
| Federal law assessment exemption too narrow | R1-1 (HIGH) | — | Single-reviewer | Valid — broaden to "assessments required by federal law" regardless of land status. NEPA applies beyond federal land. |
| Silence=denial creates reverse admin veto | R1-2 (HIGH) | Q1 (retain deemed-denial + add emergency exception) | **Complementary** | Retain deemed-denial (R2 concurs). Add mandamus remedy so Regions can compel action from captured/negligent certifying bodies (R1-2). Also mitigated by new Emergency Environmental Exception (R2-F1). |
| No emergency environmental exception | — | F1 (CRITICAL) | Single-reviewer (R2) | Adopt — critical gap. v1 creates a "Suicide Pact" scenario: Region can't restrict resource flow during genuine environmental disaster without 90-day certification. New §11(k)(6) Emergency Environmental Exception: 60-day safe harbor, 7-day submission deadline. |
| Emergency access doesn't defer to §7/WRCB for water | R1-3 (MEDIUM) | — | Single-reviewer (R1) | Valid — add explicit deferral clause. §7/WRCB framework governs water emergencies; §11(m) should supplement, not override. |
| "National Constitutional Court" dangling reference | R1-4 (MEDIUM) | — | Single-reviewer (R1) | **INVALID** — NCC exists at Art I §9(s)(1), Art I §9(cc)(1), Art XIV-RF §3(e)(1)-(2), Art II §3(e)(3). Reference is correct; no change needed. |
| Transferring Region priority ambiguity | — | F3 (HIGH) | Single-reviewer (R2) | Adopt — quantify with "baseline requirement for individual survival, sanitation, and critical infrastructure operation, as determined by applicable federal standards." Avoids specific numbers (liters/kWh) that would need amendment to update. |
| Unilateral mineral designation by DOI | — | F4 (MEDIUM) | Single-reviewer (R2) | Adopt — require ARB concurrence. Prevents DOI from unilaterally nationalizing mineral resources. |
| DOE conflict of interest | — | F5 (MEDIUM) | Single-reviewer (R2) | Adopt — require EPA consultation for energy certification. DOE mission (energy production) conflicts with environmental assessment role. |

**Convergent findings:** 1 (definition overbreadth — R1-5 + F2)
**Complementary findings:** 1 (deemed-denial mitigation — R1-2 + Q1)
**Single-reviewer accepted:** 6 (R1-1, F1, R1-3, F3, F4, F5)
**Single-reviewer rejected:** 1 (R1-4 — NCC exists)

### Open Question Resolution

| Q# | Question | Resolution | Basis |
|----|----------|------------|-------|
| Q1 | 90-day certification timeline | Retain 90 days with deemed-denial. Add mandamus remedy (R1-2) + emergency environmental exception (R2-F1) to address capture/inaction risk. | R1-2, R2-Q1 |
| Q2 | 12-month assessment cap scope | Narrow to assessments specifically conditioning interstate resource transfers (R2-Q2). Broaden federal exemption to "assessments required by federal law" regardless of land status (R1-1). | R1-1, R2-Q2 |
| Q3 | National Resource Doctrine vs Exclusive Regional Domains tension | Add deconfliction clause: environmental regulation remains an Exclusive Regional Domain; National Resource Doctrine prohibits only regulatory capture for resource hoarding, not genuine environmental regulation. | R2-Q3 |
| Q4 | Pattern presumption threshold (2 in 5 years) | Retain — both reviewers find appropriate. | R2-Q4 |
| Q5 | Emergency authorization — congressional authorization required? | Coordination body sufficient for initial declaration (R2-Q5). No congressional requirement. | R2-Q5 |
| Q6 | DOE/NIST conflict with Art II §4(m) | No conflict. DOE with EPA consultation handles energy certification (R2-F5). NIST handles interoperability standards under Art II §4(m). Different functions. | R2-F5, R2-Q6 |
| Q7 | DOI mineral designation bounds | Require ARB concurrence (R2-F4, R2-Q7). Bounded designation process prevents unilateral nationalization. | R2-F4, R2-Q7 |
| Q8 | Quantified minimum for transferring Region priority | Adopt functional standard: "baseline requirement for individual survival, sanitation, and critical infrastructure operation, as determined by applicable federal standards." Not a fixed percentage — too rigid; reference to federal standards allows update without constitutional amendment. | R2-F3, R2-Q8 |

### v2 Modification Summary

Ten modifications applied to constitutional text:

1. **Narrow "resource-restrictive" definition** — §11(k)(1): add "substantially limiting" + "resulting in a material reduction in interstate availability of that resource" (R1-5 + F2 convergent)
2. **Add EPA consultation for DOE certification** — §11(k)(2): DOE "in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency" (F5)
3. **Add mandamus remedy for deemed-denial** — §11(k)(3): Region may petition the National Constitutional Court for mandamus compelling action (R1-2)
4. **Narrow assessment cap scope and broaden federal exemption** — §11(k)(5): "required as a precondition for approval of an interstate resource transfer" + "assessments required by federal law" (R1-1 + R2-Q2)
5. **Add Emergency Environmental Exception** — new §11(k)(6): 60-day safe harbor for genuine environmental emergencies, 7-day submission deadline, automatic vacatur if not submitted (F1)
6. **Require ARB concurrence for mineral designation** — §11(l)(1)(B): DOI "with concurrence of the Allocation Review Board" (F4)
7. **Add deconfliction clause** — §11(l)(2): National Resource Doctrine does not reclassify environmental regulation from Exclusive Regional Domain (Q3)
8. **Quantify transferring Region priority** — §11(m)(1)(C): "baseline requirement for individual survival, sanitation, and critical infrastructure operation, as determined by applicable federal standards" (F3)
9. **Add water emergency deferral** — §11(m)(4): water emergencies subject to §7 framework, with WRCB as coordinating authority (R1-3)
10. **Retain NCC reference** — R1-4 invalid; NCC exists throughout the constitution

## Round 2 Convergence Analysis

### Reviewer Summary

- **R2:** 5 findings (1 HIGH, 3 MEDIUM, 1 LOW) — all surgical refinements

Reviewer confirms: Gap 109 CLOSED. Environmental risk PROTECTED. Sovereignty risk BALANCED. Implementation risk SECURED.

### Finding Resolution

| ID | Severity | Finding | Resolution |
|----|----------|---------|------------|
| D1 | HIGH | Emergency-vs-emergency collision: §11(k)(6) environmental emergency vs §11(m)(1)(A) resource emergency suspension — a presidential energy shortage could force reopening during a toxic spill | Add §11(m)(1)(E) deconfliction: resource emergency suspension does not override environmental emergency restrictions under §11(k)(6); when both overlap, certifying body determines priority based on comparative irreversible harm assessment |
| D2 | MEDIUM | §11(k)(6) 60-day safe harbor lapses with no rule for pending certification — restriction lapses even if emergency persists | Add §11(k)(6)(E) extension mechanism: certifying body may extend in 30-day increments while review proceeds; if certifying body fails to act, emergency standard remains in effect until certification determination, subject to mandamus under §11(k)(3) |
| D3 | MEDIUM | §11(k)(5) interim conditions administrative veto — no remedy if certifying body fails to set conditions after 12-month assessment cap | Add fallback: if certifying body fails to establish interim conditions within 30 days of assessment deadline, transfer proceeds under conditions most recently applicable to comparable transfers; mandamus available under §11(k)(3) |
| D4 | MEDIUM | §11(l)(1)(C) ARB additional resource designation unbounded — can nationalize purely local resources | Add criteria: resource must have cross-Regional or interstate significance; 60-day notice to affected Regions before finalization |
| D5 | LOW | §11(m)(2)(C) "expedited review" with no timeline — emergency allocations stuck in litigation | Add 21-day decision deadline for reviewing court |

**All 5 findings adopted** — surgical fixes, no structural changes.

### v2 Open Question Resolution

| Q# | Question | Resolution | Basis |
|----|----------|------------|-------|
| Q1 | Emergency Environmental Exception extension cap | Add 30-day extension mechanism with certifying body authority; default continuation pending mandamus if certifying body fails to act | D2 |
| Q2 | Mandamus sanctions for repeated 90-day failures | Not adopted — mandamus sufficient; adding sanctions introduces complexity without clear benefit at constitutional level; can be addressed by implementing legislation | — |
| Q3 | Deconfliction clause adequacy | Adequate — reviewer did not flag; the deconfliction clause plus the new emergency collision rule (D1) together fully resolve the tension | D1 |
| Q4 | Federal baseline standards existence | Adequate — federal standards exist for water (EPA drinking water standards, USGS water use data) and energy (DOE baseline consumption data); minerals can use strategic reserve baseline. Reference to "applicable federal standards" provides sufficient anchor without requiring constitutional enumeration | — |

### v3 Modification Summary

Five modifications applied to constitutional text:

1. **Emergency collision deconfliction** — new §11(m)(1)(E): resource emergency suspension does not override §11(k)(6) environmental emergency restrictions; certifying body determines priority based on comparative irreversible harm (D1)
2. **Safe harbor extension mechanism** — new §11(k)(6)(E): certifying body may extend emergency standard in 30-day increments; default continuation pending mandamus if certifying body fails to act (D2)
3. **Interim conditions fallback** — §11(k)(5) expanded: if certifying body fails to set conditions within 30 days, transfer proceeds under most recently applicable conditions; mandamus available (D3)
4. **ARB designation criteria** — §11(l)(1)(C) expanded: cross-Regional or interstate significance required; 60-day notice to affected Regions (D4)
5. **Expedited review timeline** — §11(m)(2)(C) expanded: 21-day decision deadline for reviewing court (D5)

## Proposed Constitutional Text (v3 FINAL)

Three new subsections appended to Article I-RF, Section 11, after existing subsection (j):

### Pretextual Resource Regulation Prevention

> **(k) Resource-Restrictive Environmental Standard Certification.**
>
> (1) An environmental standard is "resource-restrictive" if it has the purpose or effect of substantially limiting the extraction, processing, transfer, or interstate flow of a Shared National Resource designated under subsection (l), resulting in a material reduction in interstate availability of that resource.
>
> (2) Before enforcing a resource-restrictive environmental standard against interstate resource flows, a Region must obtain certification from the relevant coordination body — the Water Resources Coordination Board for water resources under Section 7, the Department of Energy in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency for energy resources, or the Allocation Review Board for all other resources. Certification requires a finding that:
>
> - (A) The standard addresses a genuine, documented environmental threat specific to the Region;
>
> - (B) The environmental benefit of the standard outweighs the harm to equitable resource access by other Regions;
>
> - (C) Less restrictive alternatives cannot achieve the environmental objective;
>
> - (D) The standard does not exceed what is necessary to address the identified environmental threat.
>
> (3) The certifying body shall issue its determination within ninety (90) days. Failure to rule within ninety (90) days constitutes denial of certification. A Region whose certification is deemed denied by inaction may petition the National Constitutional Court for a writ of mandamus compelling the certifying body to issue a determination within thirty (30) additional days.
>
> (4) **Pretext Finding.** If the certifying body finds that a resource-restrictive standard is pretextual — adopted or maintained primarily for the purpose of resource hoarding, competitive advantage, or economic leverage rather than genuine environmental protection:
>
> - (A) The standard is void as applied to interstate resource flows;
>
> - (B) The Region may maintain the standard for intra-Regional purposes only;
>
> - (C) The Region shall compensate other Regions for economic losses incurred during the period the pretextual standard was enforced;
>
> - (D) A pattern of two (2) or more pretext findings within five (5) years creates a rebuttable presumption that subsequent resource-restrictive standards by that Region are pretextual.
>
> (5) **Assessment Timeline Limitation.** No environmental assessment, review, or study required as a precondition for approval of an interstate resource transfer may exceed twelve (12) months in duration. If the assessment is not completed within twelve (12) months, the transfer shall proceed under interim conditions established by the certifying body. If the certifying body fails to establish interim conditions within thirty (30) days of the assessment deadline, the transfer shall proceed under conditions most recently applicable to comparable transfers of the same resource, subject to mandamus under subsection (3). This limitation does not apply to assessments required by federal law.
>
> (6) **Emergency Environmental Exception.** A Region may enforce a resource-restrictive environmental standard without prior certification under subsection (2) when the Regional Governor certifies that an imminent environmental emergency — including but not limited to a toxic spill, pipeline rupture, aquifer contamination event, or ecological disaster — requires immediate restriction of resource flows to prevent irreversible environmental harm:
>
> - (A) The emergency standard may remain in effect for up to sixty (60) days without certification;
>
> - (B) Within seven (7) days of invoking this exception, the Region shall submit a certification application to the relevant coordination body under subsection (2);
>
> - (C) If the Region does not submit the certification application within seven (7) days, the emergency standard is automatically vacated;
>
> - (D) If certification is denied upon review, the emergency standard is vacated immediately upon denial, and the Region is not liable for damages incurred during the bona fide emergency period prior to denial;
>
> - (E) If the certification review is not completed within sixty (60) days, the certifying body may extend the emergency standard in thirty (30) day increments while the review proceeds, provided the environmental emergency persists. If the certifying body fails to act on the extension within the sixty-day period, the emergency standard remains in effect until the certification determination is issued, subject to mandamus under subsection (3).
>
> **(l) Shared National Resource Designation.**
>
> (1) In addition to interstate water resources designated under Section 7(a), the following are Shared National Resources subject to this subsection and the certification requirements of subsection (k):
>
> - (A) Energy resources crossing Regional boundaries, including petroleum, natural gas, renewable energy potential transmitted via interstate grid, and geothermal resources underlying multiple Regions;
>
> - (B) Mineral resources designated by the Department of the Interior, with concurrence of the Allocation Review Board, as having national strategic significance;
>
> - (C) Additional resources designated by the Allocation Review Board upon petition by any Region or by Congress, provided the resource has cross-Regional or interstate significance. The Board shall provide sixty (60) days' notice to affected Regions before finalizing any designation under this subparagraph.
>
> (2) **National Resource Doctrine.** Shared National Resources are held in trust for the benefit of all Americans. No Region may capture a Shared National Resource through regulatory action — including environmental, health, safety, or land use regulation — that has the purpose or effect of denying equitable access to other Regions. This Doctrine prohibits pretextual regulatory capture of shared resources; it does not reclassify environmental regulation from an Exclusive Regional Domain under Article II, Section 1(e), and does not diminish Regional authority over genuine environmental protection that satisfies the certification requirements of subsection (k).
>
> (3) **Environmental Authority Preservation.** Nothing in this subsection diminishes a Region's authority to:
>
> - (A) Protect environmental quality within its boundaries through standards that satisfy the certification requirements of subsection (k);
>
> - (B) Regulate resource extraction within its territory for genuine environmental purposes;
>
> - (C) Exceed federal environmental floors where the higher standard has primary environmental benefit as certified under subsection (k)(2).
>
> (4) **Cross-Reference.** Water resources remain subject to the specific provisions of Section 7, including equitable apportionment under Section 7(a), the Water Resources Coordination Board under Section 7(e), and the National Water Court under Section 7(f). The certification requirements of subsection (k) apply to water-related environmental standards that restrict interstate water flow, with the Water Resources Coordination Board serving as the certifying body.
>
> **(m) Emergency Resource Access.**
>
> (1) During a resource emergency — including drought, energy shortage, or critical mineral supply disruption — as declared by the President or certified by the relevant coordination body:
>
> - (A) Environmental standards that restrict interstate resource transfers are suspended to the extent necessary to address the emergency;
>
> - (B) Emergency resource transfers shall be compensated at fair market value;
>
> - (C) The transferring Region retains priority for its own population's baseline requirement for individual survival, sanitation, and critical infrastructure operation, as determined by applicable federal standards — no emergency transfer may reduce the transferring Region's resource availability below this baseline;
>
> - (D) Environmental standards are automatically restored when the emergency declaration expires;
>
> - (E) The suspension under subparagraph (A) does not override an emergency environmental restriction in effect under subsection (k)(6). When a declared resource emergency and an environmental emergency under subsection (k)(6) affect the same resource corridor, the certifying body shall determine whether the environmental restriction should be maintained, modified, or suspended, based on comparative assessment of irreversible harm. The environmental restriction shall be maintained unless the certifying body finds that the resource emergency poses greater risk of irreversible harm than the environmental emergency.
>
> (2) **Coordination Body Allocation.** When multiple Regions require emergency access to the same Shared National Resource:
>
> - (A) The relevant coordination body shall establish allocation among requesting Regions based on severity of need, population affected, and availability of alternatives;
>
> - (B) No Region may receive allocation below the minimum necessary for public health and safety;
>
> - (C) The allocating body's determination is subject to expedited review by the National Water Court for water resources or by the National Constitutional Court for all other resources. The reviewing court shall issue its determination within twenty-one (21) days of the challenge filing.
>
> (3) **Anti-Hoarding During Emergency.** During a declared resource emergency, a Region that maintains resource-restrictive environmental standards not certified under subsection (k):
>
> - (A) Is presumed to be engaged in resource hoarding;
>
> - (B) Shall have the uncertified standards suspended immediately by order of the certifying body;
>
> - (C) Is liable for treble damages to Regions harmed by the resource restriction during the emergency period.
>
> (4) **Water Emergency Coordination.** For resource emergencies involving water, the provisions of Section 7 — including the Water Resources Coordination Board under Section 7(e) and the National Water Court under Section 7(f) — govern emergency allocation and dispute resolution. This subsection supplements but does not override the water-specific framework of Section 7.

## Key Design Decisions (Cumulative v1 + v2 + v3)

1. **Art I §11 placement, not §10** — The proposal targeted §10, but §10 is Data Sovereignty. §11 (Environmental Border Protection) is the correct location. The new subsections form the third layer of §11's framework: direct harm (a)-(d), cumulative harm (e)-(j), pretextual regulation (k)-(m).

2. **Cross-reference to §7, not duplication** — §7 already provides comprehensive water resource management (shared resource designation, equitable apportionment, Water Resources Coordination Board, National Water Court). §11(l)(4) explicitly cross-references §7 rather than duplicating its framework. The WRCB serves as certifying body for water-related resource-restrictive standards. v2 adds §11(m)(4) to ensure water emergency coordination also defers to §7.

3. **Multi-body certification with EPA consultation** — WRCB for water (leveraging §7(e) expertise), DOE in consultation with EPA for energy (leveraging sector expertise while mitigating DOE's production-oriented mission bias), ARB for all other resources (leveraging general regulatory review authority). This avoids creating new institutions while matching certifying expertise to resource type. (v2: DOE+EPA consultation addresses R2-F5 conflict-of-interest concern.)

4. **90-day certification with deemed-denial + mandamus** — Mirrors the ARB certification pattern at §9(j)-(k). Deemed-denial (not deemed-approval) prevents certification-by-silence. v2 adds mandamus remedy: a Region whose certification is deemed denied by inaction can petition the NCC to compel the certifying body to rule within 30 additional days. This addresses R1-2's concern about captured agencies blocking legitimate environmental standards through strategic inaction.

5. **12-month assessment cap — narrowed scope + interim conditions fallback** — Directly closes Gaming Vector 2 (environmental assessment delay). v2 narrows scope to assessments "required as a precondition for approval of an interstate resource transfer" (not all environmental assessments). Federal exemption broadened to "assessments required by federal law" regardless of land status (R1-1). v3 adds fallback: if certifying body fails to establish interim conditions within 30 days, transfer proceeds under most recently applicable conditions, with mandamus available (D3).

6. **4-part proportionality test** — Genuine threat + proportionality + less restrictive alternatives + necessity. More rigorous than §11(c)'s simple anti-discrimination principle. This is the enforcement mechanism for §11(c)'s promise that higher standards may not "discriminate against interstate commerce."

7. **Pattern presumption (2 in 5 years)** — After 2 pretext findings, subsequent resource-restrictive standards are presumed pretextual. Mirrors the DOJ pattern presumption at §9(dd)(3) (3 complaints in 12 months) but with a longer window and higher threshold because environmental regulation is a core Regional authority. Both reviewers confirmed this threshold is appropriate.

8. **Transferring Region priority — quantified** — v2 replaces "minimum necessary for health and safety" with "baseline requirement for individual survival, sanitation, and critical infrastructure operation, as determined by applicable federal standards." This provides a concrete, measurable floor without embedding specific quantities (liters/capita, kWh/household) that would require constitutional amendment to update. Federal standards provide the baseline; constitutional text provides the guarantee.

9. **Anti-hoarding during emergency with treble damages** — During declared emergencies, uncertified resource-restrictive standards create a presumption of resource hoarding. Treble damages provide deterrence proportional to the emergency harm.

10. **Emergency Environmental Exception with extension mechanism (v2 + v3)** — Closes the "Suicide Pact" gap identified by R2-F1. The 60-day/7-day safe harbor allows immediate response while requiring prompt certification submission. Automatic vacatur after 7 days without submission prevents abuse. No damages for bona fide emergency period prior to denial. v3 adds extension mechanism: certifying body may extend in 30-day increments while review proceeds; if certifying body fails to act, emergency standard remains in effect pending mandamus (D2).

11. **"Resource-restrictive" narrowed (v2)** — v1's definition triggered on any standard "limiting the extraction, processing, transfer, or interstate flow" — virtually any environmental regulation would qualify. v2 requires "substantially limiting" + "material reduction in interstate availability," ensuring only regulations with significant interstate resource impact trigger the certification requirement. This was the sole convergent finding across both Round 1 reviewers (R1-5 + F2).

12. **Deconfliction with Exclusive Regional Domains (v2)** — The National Resource Doctrine at §11(l)(2) could be read to override Art II §1(e)'s designation of environmental regulation as an Exclusive Regional Domain. v2 adds explicit deconfliction: the Doctrine prohibits pretextual regulatory capture but does not reclassify environmental regulation from an Exclusive Regional Domain.

13. **ARB concurrence for mineral designation (v2) + designation criteria (v3)** — v1 allowed DOI to unilaterally designate minerals as having "national strategic significance." v2 requires ARB concurrence, providing an institutional check. v3 further bounds the ARB's own expansion authority under §11(l)(1)(C): additional resource designations require cross-Regional or interstate significance and 60-day notice to affected Regions (D4). Prevents nationalization of purely local resources.

14. **Emergency collision deconfliction (v3 new)** — v2 created an emergency environmental exception at §11(k)(6) and an emergency resource access provision at §11(m)(1)(A) but no rule for when both apply simultaneously. v3 adds §11(m)(1)(E): resource emergency suspension does not override environmental emergency restrictions; when both overlap, the certifying body determines priority based on comparative assessment of irreversible harm. The environmental restriction is maintained unless the resource emergency poses greater irreversible harm (D1). This prevents a presidential energy shortage declaration from forcing reopening of a corridor during a toxic spill.

15. **21-day expedited review deadline (v3 new)** — v2's "expedited review" at §11(m)(2)(C) had no timeline. v3 adds a 21-day clock for the reviewing court (NCC or National Water Court) to issue its determination on emergency allocation challenges. Prevents emergency allocations from being stuck in litigation (D5).
