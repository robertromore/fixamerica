## Pre-Existing Coverage Analysis

### Already Covered

| Gap 56 Component | Existing Location | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| Disqualified Caretaker Rule (6 categories) | Art VII §8(a)(1)-(6) | Full — incumbent, same-party, federal appointees, judicial appointees all excluded |
| Caretaker Selection Hierarchy (4-tier) | Art VII §8(b)(1)-(4) | Full — Chief Justice, senior judge, retired executive, adjacent Governor panel |
| Declining Authority (3 phases) | Art VII §8(c)(1)-(3) | Full — Days 1-30 full, 31-60 reduced, 61-90 minimal |
| Day 91 Automatic Termination | Art VII §8(c)(4) | Partial — triggers special election but no bipartisan committee fallback |
| General Certification Timeline | Art VII §7(k) | Partial — Day 0-56 general timeline but no caretaker-specific acceleration |
| Default Resolution | Art VII §7(l) | Partial — results become final, but no NEC audit or Failure of Choice mechanism |
| Certification Subversion Penalties | Art VII §7(o) | Partial — covers refusal to certify but not broader obstruction tactics |
| Ministerial Certification | Art VII §7(m) | Full — certification is ministerial, auto-certification on deadline miss |
| Appointment Restriction | Art VII §8(c)(2)(i) | Partial — "no permanent appointments" after Day 30 only; Days 1-30 unrestricted |

### Not Covered (Delta — This Draft)

| Gap 56 Component | Proposed Location | Description |
|---|---|---|
| External Confirmation | New §8(d) | Adjacent Governor confirmation of caretaker with 72-hour deadline |
| Temporary Executive Committee | New §8(e) | Bipartisan committee composition, supermajority requirement, limited authority, anti-abuse |
| Anti-Obstruction Framework | New §8(f) | Obstruction definition, NEC finding, sanctions, candidate disqualification, federal obstruction |
| Caretaker Resolution Timeline | New §8(g) | Caretaker-specific accelerated timeline supplementing §7(k), 66-day maximum |
| NEC Audit Default and Special Election | New §8(h) | NEC reliability determination, default certification, Failure of Choice, 30-day special election, terminal fallback |
| Modified Day 91 Termination | Modified §8(c)(4) | Replace direct special election with committee fallback + coordination |

### Cross-Reference Considerations

| Provision | Relationship |
|---|---|
| Art VII §7(d) NEC review (48-hour panel) | §8(g) timeline supplements, does not replace |
| Art VII §7(f)-(g) preemptive federal jurisdiction | §8(f) anti-obstruction coordinates with NEC jurisdiction |
| Art VII §7(k) general timeline | §8(g) controls for caretaker situations via "Notwithstanding" |
| Art VII §7(l) default resolution | §8(h) provides enhanced NEC audit default for caretaker situations |
| Art VII §7(n)-(o) certification subversion | §8(f) anti-obstruction covers broader tactics beyond certification manipulation |
| Gap 79 (Caretaker Perpetualism) | Adjacent gap — addresses hard termination, anti-manufactured dispute, emergency limits; future draft |
| Gap 118 (Caretaker Cabinet) | Adjacent gap — addresses appointment freeze from Day 1; future draft |

## Round 1 Convergence Analysis

### Reviewer Summary

| ID | R1 | R2 | Convergence | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | F1 HIGH: Unicameral/nonpartisan legislature — committee assumes bicameral with minority leaders | -- | Single-reviewer | **ACCEPT** — add unicameral/nonpartisan fallback at §8(e)(2) |
| 2 | F2 HIGH: "All federal involvement terminates" in §8(f)(4)(i) conflicts with NEC/SC/DOJ/observer roles | -- | Single-reviewer | **ACCEPT** — narrow to "executive and administrative involvement"; carve out judicial and election-security |
| 3 | F3 MEDIUM: §8(g)(3) automatic transfer has no terminal step if SC misses deadline | -- | Single-reviewer | **ACCEPT** — add explicit fallback to §8(h) NEC audit default |
| 4 | F4 MEDIUM: Contract cap blocks emergency/election logistics | F2 CRITICAL: $100k hard-coded, needs FPU | **Complementary** | **ACCEPT BOTH** — convert to 1,000 FPU + add court-certified emergency and election administration exception |
| 5 | F5 MEDIUM: Circuit judge backstop may conflict with §8(a)(4) | Q3 recommendation: Retain | Single-reviewer + R2 | **ACCEPT** — retain with explicit "Notwithstanding subsection (a)(4)" carve-out |
| 6 | -- | F1 CRITICAL: Timeline mismatch — 66-day vs 56-day ambiguity | Single-reviewer | **PARTIAL** — keep 66 days (includes SC appeal not in §7); add "Notwithstanding Section 7(k)" to resolve ambiguity |
| 7 | -- | F3 HIGH: Confirmation gridlock with even Governor split | Single-reviewer | **ACCEPT** — add longest-tenure tie-breaker |
| 8 | -- | F4 MEDIUM: Terminal fallback full-term committee is anti-democratic | Single-reviewer | **ACCEPT** — limit to next general election cycle, max 1 year |
| 9 | -- | F5 MEDIUM: "Public incitement" too broad, weaponizable against protest | Single-reviewer | **ACCEPT** — narrow to Brandenburg standard (imminent lawless action) |
| 10 | -- | Q4: Obstruction should trigger strict scrutiny in related cases | Single-reviewer | **ACCEPT** — add cross-case trigger at §8(f)(2)(v) |

**Convergence statistics:** 0 convergent, 1 complementary pair, 0 contradictions, 8 single-reviewer accepted

### Open Question Resolutions

| Q | v1 Question | Resolution | Basis |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 | 66 vs 56 days? | Keep 66 + "Notwithstanding §7(k)" | §8(g) includes SC appeal (Days 52-66) absent from §7(k); "Notwithstanding" eliminates ambiguity without compressing judicial deliberation |
| Q2 | Terminal fallback full term? | 1-year max / next general election | R2 recommendation — unelected committee serving full term is anti-democratic; 1-year bridge is proportionate |
| Q3 | Circuit judge backstop? | Retain with §8(a)(4) carve-out | R2 retains; R1's conflict resolved via explicit "Notwithstanding" override |
| Q4 | Obstruction → strict scrutiny? | Automatic trigger | R2 recommendation — obstruction finding triggers heightened review in all related cases |
| Q5 | $100k → FPU? | Convert to 1,000 FPU | R2 recommendation + R1-F4 complementary; 1,000 FPU aligns with Art V §4-A's 10,000 FPU governor threshold at 10x lower for committee's reduced authority |

## Round 2 Convergence Analysis

### Reviewer Summary

| ID | Severity | Finding | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | HIGH | Nonpartisan bicameral composition underspecified — §8(e)(3)(ii) uses singular "presiding officer" for bicameral legislature | **ACCEPT** — specify "presiding officers of both chambers" with cross-chamber diversity requirement |
| D2 | MEDIUM | Terminal fallback lacks election trigger if next general election is >1 year away | **ACCEPT** — add mandatory special election within 1 year if next general election is later |
| D3 | MEDIUM | Circuit judge carve-out only overrides §8(a)(4), not §8(a)(6) — circuit judge may have been appointed by incumbent | **ACCEPT** — expand carve-out to "Notwithstanding subsections (a)(4) and (a)(6)" |
| D4 | LOW | Equal-tenure tie-breaker lacks secondary rule for identical tenure | **ACCEPT** — add oldest-by-age secondary tie-breaker |
| D5 | LOW | "Strict scrutiny of standing" is doctrinally awkward — strict scrutiny is a standard of review, not a standing doctrine | **ACCEPT** — replace with "heightened scrutiny" and "rigorous enforcement of standing, timeliness, and factual basis requirements" |

**Convergence statistics (single reviewer):** 5 findings accepted, 0 rejected

### New Subsections

#### External Confirmation

(d) **External Confirmation of Caretaker.**

(1) Any Caretaker selected under subsection (b)(1) through (b)(3) shall require confirmation by majority vote of the Governors of adjacent States or Regions. For purposes of this subsection, "adjacent" means sharing a land border or, for non-contiguous States or Regions, the two nearest by geographic center.

(2) Adjacent Governors shall vote on confirmation within seventy-two (72) hours of the Caretaker selection. If a Governor fails to cast a vote within seventy-two hours, that Governor is deemed to have voted in favor of confirmation. If the adjacent Governors are evenly divided, the Governor with the longest continuous tenure in office shall cast the deciding vote; if two or more Governors share the longest continuous tenure, the oldest by age among them shall cast the deciding vote.

(3) If confirmation is not obtained:

- (i) The next person in the hierarchy established by subsection (b) shall be offered the position;
- (ii) If the entire hierarchy is exhausted without confirmation, the adjacent Governors shall select the Caretaker directly by majority vote within forty-eight (48) hours;
- (iii) Notwithstanding subsections (a)(4) and (a)(6), if the adjacent Governors fail to select a Caretaker within forty-eight hours, the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit encompassing the State or Region shall serve as Caretaker.

(4) The confirmation vote shall be public and recorded. No Governor may condition a confirmation vote on policy commitments, personnel decisions, or other concessions from the Caretaker.

#### Temporary Executive Committee

(e) **Temporary Executive Committee.**

(1) **Activation.** Upon termination of Caretaker authority under subsection (c)(4), executive functions shall be exercised by a Temporary Executive Committee until certification of an election winner or inauguration following a special election.

(2) **Composition.** The Temporary Executive Committee shall consist of:

- (i) The presiding officers of both chambers of the State/Regional legislature;
- (ii) The minority leaders of both chambers of the State/Regional legislature;
- (iii) The former Caretaker, in an advisory and non-voting capacity.

(3) **Unicameral and Nonpartisan Legislatures.** Where the State/Regional legislature consists of a single chamber or does not organize by political party:

- (i) In a unicameral legislature, the committee shall consist of the presiding officer, the deputy presiding officer, the minority leader, and one additional member selected by the minority caucus, with the former Caretaker in an advisory and non-voting capacity;
- (ii) In a nonpartisan legislature with two chambers, the committee shall consist of the presiding officers of both chambers and the two members with the longest continuous service who are not from the same chamber or electoral district as either presiding officer, with the former Caretaker in an advisory and non-voting capacity;
- (iii) If both conditions apply (unicameral and nonpartisan), the committee shall consist of the presiding officer and the three members with the longest continuous service who are not from the same electoral district as the presiding officer, with the former Caretaker in an advisory and non-voting capacity.

(4) **Supermajority Requirement.** If the State/Regional legislature is controlled by a political party affiliated with any candidate in the disputed election:

- (i) All executive actions by the Committee shall require a two-thirds (2/3) supermajority of voting members;
- (ii) Any action receiving less than a two-thirds vote shall be void;
- (iii) For purposes of this paragraph, "control" means a party holds the majority of seats in either chamber (or, in a unicameral legislature, the single chamber).

(5) **Limited Authority.** The Temporary Executive Committee may only:

- (i) Maintain essential government services as defined by standing appropriations;
- (ii) Respond to genuine emergencies certified by the State/Regional Supreme Court;
- (iii) Cooperate with certification resolution or special election preparation.

(6) **Anti-Abuse Provisions.** The Temporary Executive Committee may not:

- (i) Take any action designed to advantage any candidate in the disputed election or potential special election;
- (ii) Modify election procedures, voter rolls, polling locations, or certification requirements;
- (iii) Appoint officials with authority over the disputed election or special election;
- (iv) Enter into contracts, grants, or agreements exceeding thirty (30) days in duration or one thousand (1,000) Federal Penalty Units in value, except for expenditures necessary for court-certified emergency response under paragraph (5)(ii) or special election administration under paragraph (5)(iii), which shall be publicly reported within seventy-two (72) hours.

#### Anti-Obstruction Mechanisms

(f) **Anti-Obstruction Mechanisms.**

(1) **Obstruction Defined.** For purposes of this section, "obstruction" includes any action primarily intended to delay or prevent certification rather than resolve a legitimate dispute, including but not limited to:

- (i) Filing legal challenges that lack a good-faith factual or legal basis;
- (ii) Refusing to cooperate with audit, recount, or certification procedures;
- (iii) Withholding evidence, data, or records necessary for certification;
- (iv) Coordinating with the Caretaker or Temporary Executive Committee to extend the deadlock;
- (v) Physical disruption or intimidation of counting, auditing, or certification processes;
- (vi) Cyber attacks, unauthorized access, or interference with election systems;
- (vii) Incitement to imminent lawless action intended to physically prevent or disrupt the counting, auditing, or certification of lawful ballots.

(2) **Finding of Obstruction.** The National Election Court may find, by preponderance of the evidence, that a candidate, political party, or their agents engaged in obstruction. Upon such finding:

- (i) The obstructing party shall be assessed all costs, including attorney fees, for all other parties to the dispute;
- (ii) All pending and future legal challenges by the obstructing party in the same dispute shall be subject to a clear and convincing evidence standard;
- (iii) If the obstruction is egregious, repeated, or outcome-determinative, the Court may certify the election for the non-obstructing candidate;
- (iv) The finding shall be a matter of public record and may not be sealed or expunged;
- (v) All pending matters brought by the obstructing party before the National Election Court, including matters arising under Section 7, shall be subject to heightened scrutiny, including rigorous enforcement of standing, timeliness, and factual basis requirements.

(3) **Candidate Disqualification for Obstruction.** A candidate found by the National Election Court to have personally directed or authorized obstruction:

- (i) In one certification proceeding: shall be ineligible to hold the contested office for four (4) years from the date of the finding;
- (ii) In two or more certification proceedings: shall be permanently disqualified from holding State or Regional executive office;
- (iii) Disqualification under this paragraph is separate from and in addition to penalties under Section 7(o).

(4) **Federal Obstruction.** If the federal government or its agents are found by the National Election Court to have obstructed State or Regional certification:

- (i) All federal executive and administrative involvement in the affected State or Region's governance shall terminate immediately, except that judicial functions of the National Election Court and Supreme Court, law enforcement referrals, and election-security functions under subsection (h)(4)(iv) shall continue;
- (ii) The State or Region shall select its own Caretaker under subsection (b) without federal executive input;
- (iii) The responsible federal officials shall be referred to the Department of Justice for investigation and prosecution;
- (iv) The finding shall be reported to Congress for potential impeachment proceedings against responsible officials.

(5) **Frivolous Challenge Deterrence.** Election challenges that are dismissed for lack of evidence, standing, or merit, or that are substantially similar to previously dismissed challenges:

- (i) Shall result in an assessment of costs and attorney fees against the filing party;
- (ii) Shall be considered in any subsequent obstruction finding under paragraph (2);
- (iii) May result in a requirement that future challenges by the same party in the same dispute receive pre-approval from the National Election Court before filing.

#### Caretaker-Specific Resolution Timeline

(g) **Accelerated Resolution During Caretaker Governance.**

(1) **Application.** Notwithstanding Section 7(k), when a certification dispute has triggered Caretaker Governance under this section, the following accelerated deadlines shall govern the dispute resolution timeline:

| Stage | Deadline | Cumulative Days from Election Day |
|---|---|---|
| State/Regional certification or refusal | 21 days (per §7(a)) | 21 |
| Challenge filing | 7 days after certification or refusal | 28 |
| NEC evidentiary hearing | 14 days after challenge filing | 42 |
| NEC ruling | 7 days after hearing | 49 |
| Appeal to Supreme Court | 3 days after NEC ruling | 52 |
| Supreme Court ruling | 14 days after appeal | 66 |

(2) **Maximum Deadlock Period.** The total period from Election Day to final resolution of a certification dispute that has triggered Caretaker Governance shall not exceed sixty-six (66) days. If no judicial ruling has been issued by Day 66, the provisions of subsection (h) apply.

(3) **Timeline Enforcement.** If any court or tribunal fails to meet a deadline specified in this subsection:

- (i) The matter is automatically transferred to the next body in the hierarchy (from State/Regional court to NEC, or from NEC to Supreme Court);
- (ii) The receiving body shall rule within seven (7) days of automatic transfer;
- (iii) The deadline for the next stage begins from the date of automatic transfer, not from the missed deadline;
- (iv) If the Supreme Court fails to meet its deadline under this subsection, the matter shall proceed directly to the NEC audit determination under subsection (h)(1).

(4) **Coordination with Section 7.** The deadlines in this subsection do not modify the general certification provisions of Section 7 for elections that do not trigger Caretaker Governance. Where Section 7 deadlines are shorter than those specified here, the shorter deadline applies.

#### NEC Audit Default and Special Election

(h) **Default Resolution and Special Election.**

(1) **NEC Audit Determination.** If no final judicial ruling has been issued by Day 66 from Election Day, the National Election Court shall determine, within seven (7) days:

- (i) Whether the most recent completed count is reliable and materially free from obstruction, fraud, or systematic error;
- (ii) The identity of the candidate with the most votes in the most recent reliable count.

(2) **Default Certification.** If the National Election Court determines the count is reliable:

- (i) The candidate with the most votes shall be certified;
- (ii) This certification is final and not subject to further challenge, except for fraud discovered post-certification that is sufficient to change the outcome;
- (iii) The certified candidate shall take office within seven (7) days of certification.

(3) **Failure of Choice.** The National Election Court shall issue a "Failure of Choice" declaration if it determines that:

- (i) The most recent count is unreliable due to obstruction, fraud, or systematic error affecting the integrity of the result; or
- (ii) The margin between the leading candidates is smaller than the number of ballots that are unresolvable due to dispute, destruction, or tampering.

(4) **Special Election.** Upon a Failure of Choice declaration:

- (i) A special election shall be held within thirty (30) days of the declaration;
- (ii) The Caretaker (or Temporary Executive Committee, if Caretaker authority has terminated) shall continue with minimal authority during the special election period;
- (iii) The same candidates shall appear on the ballot unless a candidate voluntarily withdraws or has been disqualified under subsection (f)(3);
- (iv) Enhanced election security measures, including federal observers, shall be implemented for the special election;
- (v) Any party found to have caused the Failure of Choice through obstruction shall bear the costs of the special election.

(5) **Terminal Fallback.** If the special election also results in a Failure of Choice:

- (i) The State/Regional legislature shall elect the executive by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of a joint session;
- (ii) If no candidate receives two-thirds support within fourteen (14) days, the Temporary Executive Committee shall serve until a special election can be held during the next general election cycle; if the next general election is more than one (1) year from the date the Committee assumed authority under subsection (c)(4), a mandatory special election shall be held within one (1) year of that date;
- (iii) This terminal fallback is final and not subject to further extension or modification.

| Part 1: Selection Hierarchy | Existing §8(b) | Already integrated — no change |
| Part 1: External Confirmation | New §8(d) | Adjacent Governor confirmation with 72-hour deadline, longest-tenure + oldest-by-age tie-breaker (v3), fallback chain with "Notwithstanding §8(a)(4)/(a)(6)" circuit judge backstop (v3) |

| Part 2: Automatic Termination | Modified §8(c)(4) | Changed from direct special election to committee fallback with coordination to new (e) and (h) |
| Part 3: Temporary Executive Committee | New §8(e) | Committee composition with unicameral/nonpartisan fallback including bicameral-specific nonpartisan rules (v3), supermajority requirement, limited authority, anti-abuse with FPU and emergency exception |
| Part 4: Anti-Obstruction | New §8(f) | Obstruction definition with Brandenburg narrowing, NEC finding with cross-case heightened scrutiny trigger (v3), candidate disqualification, federal obstruction narrowed to executive/administrative, frivolous challenge deterrence |
| Part 5: Accelerated Timeline | New §8(g) | "Notwithstanding §7(k)", caretaker-specific timeline (Day 0-66), automatic transfer with SC terminal step to §8(h) |
| Part 5: NEC Audit Default | New §8(h)(1)-(2) | NEC reliability determination and default certification |
| Part 5: Failure of Choice | New §8(h)(3)-(5) | Failure of Choice mechanism, 30-day special election, terminal fallback with mandatory special election at 1-year cap (v3) |

## Key Design Decisions

1. **External confirmation backstop uses federal circuit judge with explicit §8(a)(4) and §8(a)(6) override.** The proposal's hierarchy exhaustion leads to adjacent Governor selection. v1 added a circuit judge backstop. v2 added "Notwithstanding subsection (a)(4)" to resolve the conflict with the disqualification of federal appointees. v3 expanded the carve-out to also override §8(a)(6), since a circuit judge may have been appointed to a judicial office by the incumbent within the preceding four years.

2. **Confirmation vote silence = affirmation.** If an adjacent Governor fails to vote within 72 hours, they are deemed to have voted for confirmation. This prevents obstruction through strategic non-participation.

3. **Longest-tenure tie-breaker with oldest-by-age secondary.** If adjacent Governors split evenly, the Governor with the longest continuous tenure casts the deciding vote. v3 added: if two or more Governors share the longest continuous tenure, the oldest by age among them casts the deciding vote — providing a fully deterministic chain without randomness or external arbitration.

4. **Anti-conditioning on confirmation.** Governors may not extract policy commitments as a condition of confirming the caretaker.

5. **Unicameral, nonpartisan, and nonpartisan bicameral legislature fallbacks.** §8(e)(3) provides three alternative committee compositions. v3 clarified the nonpartisan bicameral variant (ii) to specify presiding officers of both chambers with cross-chamber diversity for longest-serving members.

6. **Contract threshold in FPU with emergency/election exception.** Converted $100,000 to 1,000 FPU (aligning with Art V §4-A's 10,000 FPU governor threshold at 10x lower). Added exception for court-certified emergencies and special election administration, with 72-hour public reporting requirement.

7. **Obstruction definition narrowed to Brandenburg standard.** "Public incitement" replaced with "incitement to imminent lawless action intended to physically prevent or disrupt" — aligns with First Amendment doctrine and prevents weaponization against legitimate protest.

8. **Cross-case heightened scrutiny trigger.** An obstruction finding automatically subjects all pending matters by the obstructing party before the NEC — including §7 matters — to heightened scrutiny, including rigorous enforcement of standing, timeliness, and factual basis requirements. v3 corrected "strict scrutiny of standing" to the doctrinally precise "heightened scrutiny" formulation.

9. **Federal obstruction narrowed to executive/administrative.** "All federal involvement terminates" replaced with "all federal executive and administrative involvement terminates" with explicit carve-outs for NEC judicial functions, Supreme Court jurisdiction, DOJ referrals, and election-security/observer functions under §8(h)(4)(iv). This prevents the remedy from nullifying the enforcement mechanisms.

10. **"Notwithstanding Section 7(k)" for caretaker timeline.** Explicit override language resolves ambiguity between the 56-day general timeline and the 66-day caretaker timeline. The 66-day period is retained because it includes the Supreme Court appeal (Days 52-66) that §7(k) does not timeline.

11. **SC deadline miss → NEC audit default.** §8(g)(3)(iv) adds terminal step: if the Supreme Court itself misses its deadline, the matter proceeds directly to NEC audit determination under §8(h)(1). This closes the gap where the automatic transfer hierarchy had no endpoint.

12. **Terminal fallback with mandatory special election at 1-year cap.** Changed from "full term" to "next general election cycle" with mandatory special election within 1 year if the next general election is further away. This ensures an unelected committee cannot serve indefinitely regardless of general election timing.

13. **Frivolous challenge deterrence as separate paragraph.** The proposal's sanctions for frivolous challenges are embedded in the broader obstruction framework. Separated into §8(f)(5) for clarity, with graduated response.

14. **Caretaker-specific timeline supplements §7 rather than replacing it.** The 66-day deadline governs caretaker situations; §7(k) governs non-caretaker certification disputes. Where §7 deadlines are shorter, they apply.

15. **Day 66 NEC audit uses "reliable and materially free" standard.** Gives NEC flexibility to certify despite minor irregularities while requiring rejection if obstruction or fraud materially tainted the count.

16. **"State/Regional" language maintained throughout.** The standalone Article VII works with or without Regional Federalism.

17. **Coordination with Gap 79 and Gap 118.** This draft focuses exclusively on Gap 56's scope. Gap 79 (caretaker perpetualism) and Gap 118 (caretaker cabinet) remain as separate PA gaps.
