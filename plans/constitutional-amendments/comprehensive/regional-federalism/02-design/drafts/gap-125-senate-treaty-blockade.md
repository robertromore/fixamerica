# Gap 125 — Senate Treaty Blockade (Minority Veto)

## Draft Constitutional Text: Article IV, Section 4-F

**Version:** v3
**Date:** 2026-02-04
**Status:** FINAL

---

## Gap Description

The Senate has 21 Senators (3 per Region). Treaty ratification requires a two-thirds supermajority (14 of 21). A coalition of 8 Senators voting no — as few as 3 Regions — can block any treaty. Because Regions have equal representation regardless of population, Regions representing a small fraction of the national population can exercise a population-disproportionate veto over international commitments that bind the entire nation.

This creates three distinct vulnerabilities:

1. **Ransom demand:** Regions hold treaty ratification hostage to extract unrelated domestic concessions.
2. **Strategic sabotage:** Anti-internationalist Regions systematically block all treaties, making the United States an unreliable treaty partner.
3. **Leveraged negotiation:** Minority Regions force treaty modifications favoring their interests, distorting negotiations.

The Emergency Powers Reform auto-expiration and §4-E Coordinated Absence provisions address procedural manipulation of treaty votes (quorum gaming, scheduling delays). What remains unaddressed is **substantive vote-blocking** — the Senate simply voting no and killing treaties that have broad national support.

## Pre-Existing Coverage Analysis

| Document | Provision | What It Covers | What Remains Uncovered |
|----------|-----------|----------------|------------------------|
| Art IV, §4 | Senate enumerated powers | Treaty ratification as one of four exclusive Senate functions; two-thirds threshold (per Art II §19) | No override mechanism if Senate substantively rejects; no mandatory consideration timeline |
| Art IV, §4-E(c)-(d) | Coordinated Absence | Quorum manipulation during treaty votes; supermajority computed from total seated Senators | Only addresses quorum/absence gaming, not substantive vote-blocking |
| Art IV, §4-E(e)-(f) | Emergency oversight vote guarantees | Mandatory timelines and default outcomes for emergency/deployment/override votes | Treaty votes not covered; no mandatory timeline for treaty consideration |
| Art IV, §5(e) | Senate Review of Interregional Matters | Review-but-not-veto model: 60-day auto-presentment for ordinary legislation | Structural precedent exists for limiting Senate blocking power, but applies only to ordinary legislation |
| Art II, §19 | Treaty Withdrawal | Senate consent for withdrawal (majority); emergency suspension; transition freeze; three-tier framework | Covers withdrawal procedures, not ratification blockade; establishes 2/3 threshold for treaty entry |
| Art II, §19(d)(1) | Three-Tier Framework | Treaties require two-thirds Senate supermajority for entry | Confirms threshold but provides no alternative pathway if Senate blocks |
| Art VI, §4 | One Voice Doctrine | Federal exclusivity in foreign relations; Regions cannot make independent treaties | Prevents Regional freelancing but does not help if Senate blocks federal treaty ratification |
| Art XXIII, §3-4 | Indigenous Treaty Protection | Treaty supremacy for indigenous treaties; tribal consent required for modification | Separate track; must be explicitly excluded from any override mechanism |

**Bottom line:** The constitution comprehensively addresses treaty withdrawal (Art II §19), quorum manipulation (§4-E), and Regional foreign policy freelancing (Art VI §4). The structural precedent of "review but not veto" exists for ordinary legislation (§5(e)). What's missing is: (1) a mandatory timeline for Senate consideration of treaties, (2) any mechanism to address substantive Senate rejection when treaties have broad national support, and (3) accountability for serial treaty rejection.

## Proposed Constitutional Text

### Section 4-F. Treaty Ratification Accountability

*Addresses Gap 125: The Senate Treaty Blockade (Minority Veto). Establishes mandatory consideration timelines, a population-weighted House override for treaties rejected by the Senate, pre-negotiation consultation requirements, and a Treaty Blockade finding for serial rejection.*

**(a) Standard Ratification and Mandatory Consideration.**

- (1) Except as provided in subsection (b), treaty ratification requires approval by two-thirds of seated Senators, by recorded roll-call vote. *(v2 — S1: "except as provided" removes internal inconsistency with override pathway)*
- (2) The President shall transmit any signed treaty to the Senate for ratification consideration, together with a certification that the treaty text is final and the administrative record complete. The Senate shall hold a recorded vote on ratification within one hundred twenty (120) days of such certification. If the President has not transmitted certification within one hundred eighty (180) days of treaty signature, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, or its equivalent, may by majority vote deem the treaty certified for purposes of this paragraph, commencing the one hundred twenty (120) day period. *(v2 — Q5: presidential certification triggers clock; v3 — S6: Senate committee backstop at 180 days prevents indefinite delay)*
- (3) If the Senate neither ratifies nor rejects the treaty by recorded vote within one hundred twenty (120) days, the treaty shall be deemed rejected for purposes of subsections (b) and (d). Deemed rejection does not constitute affirmative Senate action, and the treaty does not take effect unless the House override under subsection (b) is achieved. *(v2 — C1: deemed rejection counts toward Blockade trigger)*
- (4) Each Senator voting to reject a treaty shall submit a written statement of reasons within fourteen (14) days, which shall be published in the official Senate record. Failure to submit a statement does not invalidate the vote, but the absence of a statement shall create a rebuttable presumption for purposes of subsection (d)(2) that the Senator's rejection lacked specific objection to the treaty text, negotiation process, or compliance mechanism. A Senator may rebut this presumption by providing a written statement to the Allocation Review Board during any Treaty Blockade investigation. *(v3 — S7: missing statement creates rebuttable presumption for Blockade analysis)*

**(b) House Proportional Override.**

- (1) Following Senate rejection or deemed rejection under subsection (a), the President may transmit the rejected treaty to the House of Representatives for override consideration.
- (2) The House may ratify a treaty rejected by the Senate upon the concurrence of:
    - (i) two-thirds of the seated membership of the House of Representatives, by recorded roll-call vote. For purposes of this subsection, "seated membership" means Members who have been certified and are currently serving; vacant seats are excluded; and *(v2 — S2: membership threshold, not present-and-voting; v3 — S5: "seated membership" defined; vacancy exclusion aligns with (ii))*
    - (ii) the affirmative votes of Representatives whose districts collectively contain at least sixty percent (60%) of the national population as determined by the official apportionment data from the most recent decennial census. The Clerk of the House shall certify population totals for override votes; vacant seats shall be excluded from the calculation. If a court of competent jurisdiction has ordered reapportionment based on revised population data subsequent to the most recent decennial census, the Clerk shall use the court-ordered apportionment figures for affected districts. *(v2 — C2: decennial census apportionment data; Clerk certification; v3 — S9: court-ordered reapportionment fallback)*
- (3) The House shall hold a recorded vote within ninety (90) days of presidential transmission. If the House does not achieve the override threshold within ninety (90) days, the override process terminates and the treaty is not ratified.
- (4) Following a House override vote that achieves the threshold of paragraph (2), the Senate may reconsider and ratify the treaty by the standard two-thirds vote within thirty (30) days. If the Senate ratifies on reconsideration, the treaty is ratified through standard Senate action and the House override is mooted. If the Senate does not ratify on reconsideration within thirty (30) days, the treaty shall be deemed ratified by House override. *(v2 — Q3: 30-day reconsideration retained)*
- (5) A treaty ratified by House override has the same force and effect as a treaty ratified by Senate vote under international law. However, a treaty ratified by House override shall be non-self-executing for purposes of domestic law and shall not create judicially enforceable rights or obligations within the United States absent implementing legislation enacted by Congress through the standard legislative process. *(v2 — S4: non-self-executing mandate prevents unicameral domestic legislation backdoor)*
- (6) The House override mechanism under this subsection may be invoked only once per treaty. If the House fails to achieve the override threshold, the President may resubmit the treaty to the Senate but may not invoke a second House override for the same treaty text.

**(c) Pre-Negotiation Consultation.**

- (1) The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, or its equivalent, shall receive regular briefings on treaties under active negotiation.
- (2) The Committee may provide advisory input to the President's negotiators on potential ratification concerns. Advisory input does not bind the negotiators or the Senate's ratification decision.
- (3) For treaties that would materially affect Regional interests — including trade, environmental regulation, border management, and defense basing — the President shall consult with affected Regional Governors before finalizing treaty text.
- (4) Failure to consult under this subsection does not invalidate a treaty but may be raised as a factor in Senate debate.

**(d) Treaty Blockade Finding.**

- (1) The Allocation Review Board may investigate for "Treaty Blockade" if the Senate rejects or is deemed to have rejected under subsection (a)(3) three (3) or more consecutive treaties within any four (4) year period. *(v2 — C1: time-based trigger; deemed rejections explicitly included)*
- (2) "Treaty Blockade" means a pattern of serial treaty rejection in which the rejecting Senators' stated reasons fail to articulate specific objections to the treaty text, negotiation process, or compliance mechanism of each rejected treaty. The ARB shall consider: *(v2 — C3: objective standard replacing motive-laden criteria)*
    - (i) whether the written rejection statements under subsection (a)(4) identify specific provisions, terms, or negotiation deficiencies in each treaty, or instead reflect generalized opposition unrelated to the content of the particular treaties rejected. A statement satisfies the specificity requirement of this clause if it identifies at least one specific provision, article, clause, or term of the treaty, or a specific aspect of the negotiation process or compliance mechanism, to which the Senator objects. General statements of opposition to the treaty's subject matter, policy area, or negotiating partner, without reference to specific treaty content, do not satisfy this standard; *(v3 — S8: bright-line minimum specificity standard)*
    - (ii) whether the same Senators or Regional delegations voted to reject each treaty regardless of subject matter;
    - (iii) whether conditions were attached to ratification that are unrelated to the treaty's terms.
- (3) The ARB shall adopt a Treaty Blockade finding by majority vote of its non-vacant members, provided that no fewer than three (3) members participate in the vote.
- (4) Upon a Treaty Blockade finding:
    - (i) the population threshold for House override under subsection (b)(2)(ii) is reduced from sixty percent (60%) to fifty-five percent (55%) for a period of two (2) years from the date of the finding;
    - (ii) the House vote threshold under subsection (b)(2)(i) remains two-thirds of seated membership;
    - (iii) the reduced threshold applies to all treaties submitted during the two-year period, not only to the treaties that triggered the finding.
- (5) A Treaty Blockade finding is subject to expedited judicial review before the National Constitutional Court, limited to procedural regularity and whether the factual predicates of paragraphs (1) and (2) were facially satisfied. The Court shall render its decision within thirty (30) calendar days of the petition for review. Substantive review of whether the Senate's rejections constituted a blockade is not available under this paragraph.

**(e) Transparency and Accountability.**

- (1) The Senate shall publish, within thirty (30) days of each treaty vote:
    - (i) the full text of the treaty as submitted;
    - (ii) the recorded vote of each Senator;
    - (iii) written statements of reasons from Senators voting to reject.
- (2) The ARB shall maintain a public registry of treaty submissions, Senate votes, and outcomes, including deemed rejections, House override proceedings, and Treaty Blockade findings.

**(f) Coordination.**

- (1) This section does not modify the treaty withdrawal procedures of Article II, Section 19. Senate consent requirements for treaty withdrawal are independent of this section.
- (2) The House override mechanism under subsection (b) applies only to treaty ratification. It does not extend to Senate confirmation of officers, participation in constitutional amendments, or adjudication of intergovernmental disputes.
- (3) The quorum and Coordinated Absence protections of Section 4-E apply to treaty ratification votes under this section. The supermajority threshold for standard ratification under subsection (a)(1) shall be calculated from the total number of seated Senators in accordance with Section 4-E(d)(3).
- (4) Treaties between the United States and Indigenous Nations, governed by Article XXIII (Indigenous Sovereignty Preservation), are not subject to the House override mechanism under subsection (b). The free, prior, and informed consent requirements of Article XXIII, Section 4 apply independently of this section.
- (5) **Transition Freeze.** The House override mechanism under subsection (b) shall not be initiated or concluded during the Presidential Transition Period defined in Article II, Section 19(f). The procedural deadlines established in subsections (a)(2), (a)(3), (b)(3), (b)(4), and (d)(4)(i) are tolled during such period. The four-year lookback period in subsection (d)(1) is a calendar measurement that runs continuously and is not subject to tolling under this paragraph. Override proceedings pending at the commencement of the Transition Period are suspended and resume upon its conclusion. The Transition Freeze is not subject to waiver. Upon inauguration, the newly inaugurated President may re-certify any pending treaty under subsection (a)(2) to resume or initiate proceedings. *(v2 — S3: prevents lame-duck override; v3 — C4: 4-year lookback is calendar measurement, not subject to tolling; freeze is absolute; new President re-certifies)*

## Gaming Vector Analysis

| # | Vector | Mechanism | How §4-F Addresses |
|---|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| 1 | Population-Disproportionate Veto | 2-3 small-population Regions vote no, killing treaty with broad national support | §4-F(b): House override with 2/3 seated membership + 60% population threshold |
| 2 | Ransom Demand | Regions demand domestic concessions unrelated to treaty content in exchange for ratification votes | §4-F(a)(4): written rejection reasons create accountability; §4-F(d): serial ransom demands trigger Blockade finding |
| 3 | Strategic Sabotage | Anti-internationalist Regions systematically block all treaties regardless of content | §4-F(d): Treaty Blockade finding after 3+ consecutive rejections within 4 years; reduced override threshold |
| 4 | Leveraged Negotiation | Minority Regions force treaty modifications favoring their interests | §4-F(c): pre-negotiation consultation addresses legitimate concerns; §4-F(b): override exists if modification demands are pretextual |
| 5 | Scheduling Game | Senate leadership never schedules treaty vote | §4-F(a)(2)-(3): 120-day mandatory timeline from presidential certification; deemed rejection triggers override eligibility; Senate committee backstop at 180 days *(v3 — S6)* |
| 6 | Override Threshold Manipulation | House gerrymandering or malapportionment inflates override votes relative to population | §4-F(b)(2)(ii): separate population check based on decennial census apportionment data; Clerk certification; court-ordered reapportionment fallback *(v3 — S9)* |
| 7 | Treaty Flooding for Blockade Finding | President submits frivolous treaties to manufacture serial rejection and trigger Blockade finding | §4-F(d)(2): objective standard requires articulated objections to each treaty; §4-F(a)(2): presidential certification of final text prevents shell submissions; bright-line specificity standard *(v3 — S8)* |
| 8 | Blockade Finding Abuse | ARB manufactures finding for political reasons | §4-F(d)(5): NCC judicial review limited to procedural regularity; §4-F(d)(3): 3-member minimum; §4-F(d)(4): 2-year duration limit; bright-line specificity standard limits ARB discretion *(v3 — S8)* |
| 9 | Senate Reconsideration Gaming | Senate uses 30-day reconsideration to delay, then rejects again | §4-F(b)(4): only ratification moots override; failure to ratify within 30 days = override takes effect |
| 10 | Override Re-Submission | President resubmits same treaty to House repeatedly until override achieved | §4-F(b)(6): override invoked only once per treaty text; resubmission goes to Senate only |
| 11 | Indigenous Treaty Override | House override used to modify indigenous treaty protections or bypass tribal consent | §4-F(f)(4): explicit exclusion of Art XXIII indigenous treaties from override mechanism |
| 12 | Lame Duck Override | Defeated President/House ratify controversial treaty during Nov-Jan transition | §4-F(f)(5): Transition Freeze — override not initiated or concluded during Art II §19(f) period; deadlines tolled; freeze is absolute *(v3 — C4)* |
| 13 | Self-Executing Domestic Backdoor | House override treaty drafted to function as domestic law, bypassing Senate's role in domestic legislation | §4-F(b)(5): non-self-executing mandate — override-ratified treaties require implementing legislation for domestic law effect |
| 14 | Low-Attendance Override | House meets with minimal members to pass override using high-population districts | §4-F(b)(2)(i): "seated membership" threshold requires 2/3 of all certified-and-serving Members, not just those present *(v3 — S5)* |
| 15 | Deemed-Rejection Blockade Dodge | Senate leadership runs out 120-day clock to avoid Blockade count (inaction vs. affirmative rejection) | §4-F(a)(3) + §4-F(d)(1): deemed rejection explicitly counts toward Blockade trigger |
| 16 | Vacancy Gaming for Override Block | Regions resign House members to raise seated-membership threshold beyond reach, or create vacancies to lower it | §4-F(b)(2)(i): "seated membership" excludes vacant seats — threshold scales with actual serving Members; consistent with (b)(2)(ii) vacancy exclusion *(v3 — S5)* |
| 17 | Presidential Certification Delay | President delays certifying treaty to Senate to manipulate timing or effectively kill treaty without formal withdrawal | §4-F(a)(2): Senate Foreign Relations Committee may deem certified after 180 days from signature *(v3 — S6)* |
| 18 | Silent Rejection for Blockade Evasion | Senators reject treaties without submitting written statements to avoid Blockade analysis under (d)(2) | §4-F(a)(4): missing statement creates rebuttable presumption of unspecified objection; §4-F(d)(2)(i): bright-line minimum specificity standard *(v3 — S7, S8)* |

## Design Decisions

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|----------|-----------|
| DD-1 | Placed as §4-F (continuing Senate procedural protection pattern) | §4-B through §4-E address different Senate gaming vectors. §4-F addresses treaty-specific substantive blockade. Consistent structural pattern. |
| DD-2 | 120-day mandatory consideration timeline with deemed rejection | Parallels §4-B's anti-silent-veto approach for confirmations. Deemed rejection (not deemed ratification) is appropriate because treaties should require affirmative consent; but deemed rejection triggers override eligibility. |
| DD-3 | Two-thirds House + 60% population dual threshold for override | Very high bar ensures override is reserved for treaties with genuine broad national support. Population threshold provides constitutional insurance against malapportionment/rotten-borough dynamics. |
| DD-4 | Post-rejection presidential submission to House (not automatic) | The President — not the House — decides whether to pursue override. Preserves executive discretion in foreign policy; President may prefer to renegotiate rather than override. |
| DD-5 | 30-day Senate reconsideration window after House override | Preserves Senate dignity; gives Senate opportunity to ratify through standard process. If Senate ratifies, override is mooted and bicameral dynamics are maintained. No gaming vector: Senate can only ratify (mooting override), not kill. |
| DD-6 | ~~Different Presidents required for Blockade finding~~ **Superseded v2: Time-based trigger (4-year window)** | Different-Presidents requirement immunized single-term obstruction (4-8 years). Time-based trigger: 3 consecutive within 4 years provides accountability. Treaty flooding addressed by presidential certification requirement (DD-17) and objective Blockade standard (DD-19) instead. |
| DD-7 | 2-year reduced threshold duration | Long enough to address accumulated backlog; short enough to prevent permanent circumvention of Senate treaty power. |
| DD-8 | Written rejection reasons required but not validity-determinative | Transparency measure; creates political accountability and provides evidence for Blockade investigation. Not making validity conditional avoids justiciability problems. Missing statement now creates rebuttable presumption (DD-23). |
| DD-9 | NCC review limited to procedural regularity | Prevents courts from substituting judgment on whether rejections constitute a "blockade" — a political question. Mirrors §4-D(e)(5) and §4-E(d)(7) patterns. |
| DD-10 | Indigenous treaty exclusion | Art XXIII establishes separate, more protective track for indigenous treaties. House override could undermine tribal consent requirements. |
| DD-11 | One override attempt per treaty text | Prevents House from repeatedly voting until conditions change. If override fails, treaty goes back to Senate or is renegotiated. |
| DD-12 | Override applies to treaty ratification only | Explicitly does not extend to Senate confirmation, amendment, or adjudication powers. Each Senate function has its own protection regime. |
| DD-13 | Transition Freeze on House override | Irreversible foreign policy commitments should not be made by officials voters have replaced. Aligns with Art II §19(f) treaty withdrawal freeze. Tolling preserves deadlines without penalizing pending proceedings. Freeze is absolute — new President re-certifies upon inauguration (DD-26). |
| DD-14 | Non-self-executing mandate for override-ratified treaties | Self-executing treaty via House override = unicameral domestic legislation bypassing the Senate. Non-self-executing mandate preserves Senate's indirect role: implementing legislation must pass through normal legislative process. International obligations are unaffected. |
| DD-15 | ~~Total~~ **Seated** House membership (not present-and-voting) for override threshold | "Present and voting" allows low-attendance override gaming. "Seated membership" (certified and serving, excluding vacancies) ensures genuine broad support. Combined with 60% population threshold, override requires overwhelming democratic mandate. Vacancy exclusion aligns both thresholds (DD-21). |
| DD-16 | Time-based Blockade trigger: 3 consecutive within 4 years | Removes different-Presidents requirement that immunized single-term obstruction. 4-year window aligns with presidential term. Treaty flooding addressed by certification requirement (DD-17) and objective Blockade standard (DD-19). |
| DD-17 | Presidential certification triggers 120-day clock | Prevents "starting the clock" with shell documents. Requires final treaty text and complete administrative record. Senate committee backstop at 180 days prevents indefinite delay (DD-22). |
| DD-18 | Official decennial census apportionment data for population threshold | Removes ambiguity about mid-decade population estimates. Clerk of the House certifies totals. Vacant seats excluded from calculation. Uses same data that determines apportionment — authoritative and non-manipulable. Court-ordered reapportionment fallback for affected districts (DD-27). |
| DD-19 | Objective Blockade standard: articulated objections to treaty text | Replaces "demonstrably unrelated" motive-laden criteria with objective test: did rejection statements identify specific provisions, terms, or negotiation deficiencies? Bright-line minimum specificity standard (DD-24) limits ARB discretion. Consistent with judicial review limited to procedural regularity. |
| DD-20 | Deemed rejections count toward Blockade trigger | Prevents Blockade dodge via deliberate inaction. Senate running out the 120-day clock should have the same consequences as affirmative rejection for accountability purposes. |
| DD-21 | "Seated membership" = certified and serving, excluding vacancies *(v3 — S5)* | "Total membership" was ambiguous — could include authorized-but-vacant seats. If vacant seats count toward denominator, vacancy-gaming can block overrides. "Seated membership" scales with actual serving Members. Consistent vacancy treatment across (b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii). |
| DD-22 | Senate committee certification backstop at 180 days *(v3 — S6)* | Presidential certification requirement (DD-17) prevents shell-document gaming but creates reverse risk: President delays certification indefinitely to effectively kill treaty without formal withdrawal. 180-day backstop preserves presidential discretion while ensuring Senate can force consideration. Senate Foreign Relations Committee has context from briefings under (c)(1). |
| DD-23 | Missing rejection statement = rebuttable presumption for Blockade *(v3 — S7)* | Without explicit consequence, Senators could submit no statement and argue there are no "stated reasons" to evaluate under (d)(2). Rebuttable presumption shifts burden: default is "unspecified objection" but Senator can still provide reasons to the ARB during investigation. Preserves fairness while closing the evasion. |
| DD-24 | Bright-line minimum specificity standard for rejection statements *(v3 — S8)* | Limits ARB discretion in judging "specific" reasons. Must reference at least one specific treaty provision, article, clause, term, or aspect of negotiation/compliance. General opposition to subject matter or policy area does not qualify. Provides clear ex ante guidance to Senators. |
| DD-25 | 4-year Blockade lookback runs continuously, not subject to tolling *(v3 — C4)* | The 4-year window in (d)(1) is a calendar measurement for determining whether rejections are serial. Tolling procedural deadlines during transition is appropriate; tolling the lookback window would weaken accountability by creating gaps in the measurement period. |
| DD-26 | Transition Freeze is absolute; new President re-certifies *(v3 — C4)* | The President-Elect has no constitutional authority before inauguration. Allowing waiver would create a mechanism for a non-officeholder to affect constitutional procedures. New President can re-certify any pending treaty upon inauguration, ensuring no foreign policy commitment is permanently lost — only appropriately delayed. |
| DD-27 | Court-ordered reapportionment fallback for population data *(v3 — S9)* | Decennial census data is the primary source, but court-ordered reapportionment based on revised population data may occur mid-decade. Fallback ensures Clerk uses most current authoritative figures. Narrow exception — applies only to "affected districts" and only when a court has ordered reapportionment, not when estimates are simply updated. |

## Open Questions Resolved

All five open questions from v1 were resolved by reviewer consensus in Round 1:

| Q# | Question | Resolution | Rationale |
|----|----------|------------|-----------|
| Q1 | Population threshold redundancy | A — Keep both thresholds | Belt-and-suspenders against malapportionment/rotten-borough dynamics. Both reviewers endorsed. |
| Q2 | Blockade trigger | C (modified) — 3 consecutive within 4 years, including deemed rejections | Different-Presidents requirement immunized single-term obstruction. R1-1 and R1-2 converged on need for faster accountability. |
| Q3 | Senate reconsideration | A — 30-day window retained | Preserves bicameral comity. No gaming vector: Senate can only ratify (mooting override), not kill. R1-2 endorsed. |
| Q4 | Transition Period freeze | B — Freeze required | Irreversible foreign policy commitments shouldn't be made by replaced officials. R1-2 F1 (CRITICAL). |
| Q5 | Submission completeness | B — Presidential certification triggers clock | Prevents shell-document gaming. Provides definitive trigger. R1-2 endorsed. |

---

## Relationship to Other Gaps

| Gap | Relationship |
|-----|-------------|
| Gap 90 (Blue-Slipping) | Resolved. §4-D addresses confirmation obstruction; §4-F addresses treaty ratification obstruction. Parallel Senate gaming vectors on different enumerated powers. |
| Gap 106 (Quorum Trap) | Resolved. §4-E addresses quorum manipulation; §4-F addresses substantive vote-blocking. §4-F(f)(3) explicitly invokes §4-E protections for treaty votes. |
| Gap 49 (House Majoritarianism) | Partially Mitigated. §4-F creates a new House role in treaties, but the 2/3 seated membership + 60% population threshold is much higher than ordinary legislation. Override is only available after Senate rejection. Non-self-executing mandate (DD-14) prevents domestic law backdoor. |
| Gap 168 (Acting Officials) | Resolved. §4-C addresses acting official exploitation. Different Senate power, same institutional framework. |
| Gap 222 (Confirmation Blockade) | Resolved. §4-B addresses confirmation blockade with deemed confirmation. §4-F addresses treaty blockade with House override — different mechanism because treaties should not be "deemed ratified" by silence. |
