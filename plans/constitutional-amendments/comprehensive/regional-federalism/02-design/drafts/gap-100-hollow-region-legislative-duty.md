### Source Gap Summary

Article I, Section 3 requires Regions to adopt a republican constitution but does not explicitly mandate that a Regional Legislature must meet, pass laws, or exercise the coordination powers assigned to it under Article II, Section 2. A faction philosophically opposed to regional governance could win Regional elections and then refuse to convene, creating a "Hollow Region" — a constitutional structure with no legislative function.

Without Regional legislation implementing coordination powers (inter-state infrastructure, labor standards, housing coordination, energy planning, public health, environmental regulation, economic development), the coordination spine collapses. The non-concurrency rules in Article II, Section 1(g) prevent the federal government from substituting, creating a governance vacuum by design.

Four primary attack vectors: (1) philosophical boycott — legislature never meets, (2) perpetual recess — convenes briefly then recesses indefinitely, (3) minimum compliance — meets session requirements but passes nothing substantive, (4) delegation void — passes framework laws but refuses to fund or staff implementing agencies.

## Annotated Draft Text

### Section 3-B. Legislative Duty to Act

*Resolves Gap 100 — Hollow Region via Legislative Absence. Establishes minimum legislative function requirements for Regional Legislatures, creates ARB-certified failure triggers with cure periods, authorizes constituent State assumption of failed coordination powers, and provides a narrow federal backstop for public safety emergencies arising from coordination collapse.*

[v1] (a) **Definitions.** For purposes of this Section:

- [v1] (1) "Coordination power" means any power assigned to Regions as exclusive Regional authority under Article II, Section 2, including inter-state infrastructure and transportation corridors, Regional labor standards, housing coordination, energy planning, public health coordination, environmental regulation, and Regional economic development;
- [v1] (2) "Legislative cycle" means two consecutive calendar years beginning with the first year following a Regional general election;
- [v1] (3) "Session failure" means the failure of a Regional Legislature to meet the minimum session requirements of subsection (b) in any calendar year;
- [v1] (4) "Coordination failure" means the failure of a Regional Legislature to exercise a specific coordination power, as defined in subsection (c)(3), for two consecutive legislative cycles.

[v1] (b) **Minimum Session Requirements.**

- [v1] (1) Regional Legislatures shall convene in regular session for not less than ninety (90) calendar days in each calendar year;
- [v1] (2) a quorum of the Regional Legislature shall be present for not less than sixty (60) of those days;
- [v1] (3) calendar days under paragraphs (1) and (2) need not be consecutive;
- [v1] (4) the Regional Legislature may satisfy the requirements of this subsection through a single regular session or multiple sessions within the calendar year;
- [v2: pro forma session defined with objective criteria] (5) a session day is pro forma and shall not count toward the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) if: (A) the session lasts less than thirty (30) minutes; (B) no committee hearings, floor deliberations on pending legislation, or recorded votes occur during the session; or (C) the only actions taken are ceremonial proceedings, adjournment motions, or quorum calls; a session day that includes at least one committee hearing, floor debate on pending legislation, or recorded vote is not pro forma regardless of duration; [v3: session day vs. coordination exercise clarification] qualification of a session day under this paragraph satisfies the session requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) but does not alone establish exercise of a coordination power under subsection (c).

[v1] (c) **Coordination Power Exercise.**

- [v1] (1) within each legislative cycle, the Regional Legislature shall enact or reaffirm legislation addressing each coordination power under Article II, Section 2;
- [v2: IFC as primary cost estimator with conflict-of-interest bar] [v3: IFC 120-day deadline + ARB challenge of unreasonable fallback estimates] (2) for each enacted coordination law, the Regional Legislature shall appropriate funds sufficient to implement the law's requirements; an appropriation shall be deemed insufficient if it is less than fifty percent (50%) of the independently estimated cost of implementation, as determined by the Independent Fiscal Council using published cost estimation standards updated at least once per legislative cycle; the IFC shall issue a cost determination within one hundred twenty (120) days of a request by any party; if no IFC determination is available within this period, the Regional fiscal office estimate shall apply, provided that the ARB may, during certification proceedings under subsection (d), challenge a Regional fiscal office estimate it finds manifestly unreasonable by submitting the estimate to the IFC for expedited review; the ARB may not serve as cost estimator for coordination powers it may subsequently certify as failed;
- [v1] (3) a coordination power is "exercised" within the meaning of this subsection only if the Regional Legislature has:
    - [v1] (A) enacted or reaffirmed substantive legislation establishing standards, procedures, or requirements for that coordination domain; AND
    - [v1] (B) appropriated funds meeting the threshold of paragraph (2);
- [v1] (4) a floor vote that considers and rejects coordination legislation satisfies this subsection only if the legislature enacts alternative legislation addressing the same coordination domain within the same legislative cycle;
- [v1] (5) delegation of coordination powers to a Regional agency satisfies this subsection provided the agency is funded and staffed at the level specified in paragraph (2);
- [v2: reaffirmation defined + deregulatory frameworks allowed] (6) "reaffirmation" under paragraph (1) means a recorded floor vote, preceded by committee review of the existing coordination legislation's implementation and effectiveness, confirming the continued effect of that legislation; a deregulatory framework that establishes minimum standards, procedures, or requirements for a coordination domain — even if those standards are less prescriptive than prior legislation — constitutes substantive legislation under paragraph (3)(A) if it addresses the coordination domain and does not eliminate all regulation of that domain.

[v1] (d) **Legislative Failure Certification.**

- [v1] (1) the Allocation Review Board may certify "Regional Legislative Failure" upon documented finding that a Region has experienced:
    - [v1] (A) session failure in two consecutive calendar years; OR
    - [v1] (B) coordination failure with respect to one or more specific coordination powers;
- [v1] (2) the ARB certification shall:
    - [v1] (A) identify the specific failures with particularity;
    - [v1] (B) for coordination failure, identify the specific coordination powers not exercised;
    - [v1] (C) set forth the factual basis for the finding;
    - [v1] (D) be adopted by majority vote of the ARB following opportunity for the Region to respond;
- [v1] (3) following certification, the Region shall have one hundred eighty (180) days to cure the identified failures;
- [v1] (4) the cure period requires substantive action — the Regional Legislature must both convene and enact legislation satisfying subsection (c) for the identified coordination powers; mere convening without legislative action does not constitute cure;
- [v1] (5) if the Region cures the failure within the cure period, the ARB shall vacate the certification and no further action shall be taken;
- [v1] (6) a Region may seek expedited judicial review of an ARB certification in the Constitutional Court within thirty (30) days of certification; the court shall apply a substantial evidence standard.

[v1] (e) **State Assumption Authority.**

- [v1] (1) upon ARB certification of Regional Legislative Failure and expiration of the cure period without cure:
    - [v1] (A) the constituent State Legislatures within the Region may, by joint resolution approved by a majority of State Legislatures, exercise temporary Regional legislative authority;
    - [v1] (B) State assumption authority is limited to the specific coordination powers identified in the ARB certification;
    - [v1] (C) State assumption may not extend to amending the Regional constitution, exercising non-failed coordination powers, or modifying Regional electoral law;
- [v1] (2) **Joint State Legislative Council.** When States assume Regional authority under this subsection:
    - [v2: apportionment formula + minimum seat + cap] [v3: Huntington-Hill apportionment] (A) a Joint State Legislative Council shall be formed with membership apportioned among the constituent States using the method of equal proportions (Huntington-Hill) based on each State's share of the Region's total population as measured by the most recent federal decennial census or intercensal estimate; each State shall have at least one (1) seat regardless of population; total Council membership shall not exceed fifty (50) members;
    - [v1] (B) the Council shall exercise Regional legislative authority only for the assumed coordination powers;
    - [v1] (C) the Council shall adopt its own procedural rules by majority vote;
    - [v1] (D) legislation enacted by the Council has the same force as Regional legislation for the assumed coordination powers;
- [v1] (3) **Restoration.** State assumption terminates when:
    - [v1] (A) the Regional Legislature resumes function and enacts legislation satisfying subsection (c) for the previously failed coordination powers;
    - [v1] (B) the ARB certifies restoration of Regional legislative function;
    - [v1] (C) legislation enacted during State assumption remains in effect until superseded by subsequent Regional legislation;
    - [v2: 90-day restoration deadline with automatic termination] [v3: cure evidence required before clock starts] (D) the ARB shall act on a restoration request within ninety (90) days of the Regional Legislature's formal notification of resumed function; such notification shall include certified copies of enacted coordination legislation and appropriation records for the previously failed coordination powers; the ninety-day period begins only upon the ARB's acknowledgment of receipt of complete documentation; if the ARB fails to act within this period, restoration is presumed and State assumption terminates automatically upon expiration of the ninety-day period;
- [v1] (4) **Anti-Restoration Gaming.** If a Regional Legislature triggers a second certification under subsection (d) within four (4) years of a restoration under paragraph (3):
    - [v1] (A) the cure period under subsection (d)(3) is reduced to ninety (90) days;
    - [v1] (B) a third or subsequent certification within the same eight-year period eliminates the cure period entirely, and State assumption authority activates immediately upon certification.

[v1] (f) **Anti-Circumvention.**

- [v1] (1) Regional Legislatures may not:
    - [v1] (A) convene solely to satisfy session requirements while refusing substantive legislative action on coordination powers;
    - [v1] (B) enact coordination legislation without appropriating funds meeting the threshold of subsection (c)(2);
    - [v1] (C) delegate coordination powers to entities that lack the capacity, authority, or funding to exercise them;
    - [v1] (D) repeal coordination legislation solely to prevent State assumption from taking effect;
- [v1] (2) the ARB may, in its certification under subsection (d), consider patterns of evasion including:
    - [v1] (A) repeated session convening and immediate adjournment;
    - [v1] (B) token appropriations manifestly insufficient for implementation;
    - [v1] (C) delegation to entities with no staff, budget, or legal authority;
    - [v3: illusory regulation as non-exercise] (D) enactment of legislation that purports to address a coordination domain but establishes no operative coordination mechanisms, standards, or requirements; such legislation may be deemed non-exercise of the coordination power under subsection (c)(3);
- [v1] (3) Regional legislators who participate in coordinated refusal to exercise constitutionally mandated legislative duties may be recalled by their constituents under the recall procedures established by the Regional constitution; nothing in this paragraph creates a cause of action against individual legislators for their votes or legislative decisions.

[v1] (g) **Federal Backstop.**

- [v1] (1) if State assumption cannot be activated — because fewer than a majority of constituent State Legislatures approve the joint resolution — and coordination failure persists for an additional one hundred eighty (180) days beyond the cure period:
    - [v1] (A) the ARB may authorize federal administrative agencies to perform essential coordination functions for the affected coordination powers;
    - [v1] (B) federal exercise under this paragraph is limited to preventing imminent harm to public safety arising from coordination collapse;
    - [v1] (C) federal exercise terminates immediately upon activation of State assumption or restoration of Regional legislative function;
    - [v1] (D) federal agencies exercising authority under this paragraph shall apply the least restrictive measures necessary and shall defer to Regional administrative structures where they exist and are functional;
- [v1] (2) federal exercise under this subsection is not a precedent for expanding federal authority into exclusive Regional domains under other circumstances; it operates only as an emergency gap-filler for certification-triggered coordination failure.

### Section 3-B. Legislative Duty to Act

*Resolves Gap 100 — Hollow Region via Legislative Absence.

## Design Rationale

| Mechanism | Problem Addressed | Design Principle |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|
| Minimum session requirements (90d/60q) | Perpetual recess and philosophical boycott | Axiom 7 (Law Moves Faster): structural minimums prevent procedural nullification |
| Coordination power exercise mandate | Selective nullification of Regional powers | Axiom 1 (Assume Bad Faith): mandatory exercise prevents strategic inaction |
| ARB failure certification | Need for objective, non-partisan trigger | Axiom 5 (Remove Ambiguity): independent body makes factual determination |
| 180-day cure period | Good faith vs. bad faith distinction | Axiom 4 (Reversibility): allows correction before consequences |
| State assumption authority | Federal non-concurrency prevents federal substitution | Axiom 2 (Distribute Power): fallback stays at sub-federal level |
| Joint State Legislative Council | Need for legitimate alternative governance | Axiom 6 (Redundancy): parallel governance structure prevents vacuum |
| Anti-circumvention provisions | Minimum compliance gaming | Axiom 1 (Assume Bad Faith): closes known evasion vectors |
| Federal backstop (public safety only) | Complete failure of both Regional and State levels | Axiom 3 (Authority to Scale): narrow federal role as last resort |
| Anti-restoration gaming | Cycle of brief compliance followed by renewed failure | Axiom 7 (Law Moves Faster): accelerating consequences for repeat failure |
| Recall eligibility (not disqualification) | Accountability without weaponization | Axiom 8 (Proportionality): consequences match the violation |
| 50% appropriation floor | Token appropriation gaming | Axiom 5 (Remove Ambiguity): objective threshold prevents $1 appropriation |
| Judicial review of certification | Protecting against ARB overreach | Axiom 2 (Distribute Power): judicial check on administrative determination |

---

## Gaming Vectors

### G1: Philosophical Boycott (Legislature Never Convenes)

**Attack:** Anti-regionalist faction wins Regional elections and never convenes the legislature.

**Countermeasure:** Subsection (b) minimum session requirements (90 days, 60 quorum days) create a clear, measurable standard. Subsection (d)(1)(A) allows ARB to certify session failure after two consecutive years.

**Status:** Closed.

---

### G2: Perpetual Recess

**Attack:** Legislature convenes for a day, then enters indefinite recess.

**Countermeasure:** Subsection (b)(1)-(2) requires 90 calendar days with 60 quorum days. Subsection (b)(5) excludes pro forma sessions. One day of convening does not satisfy the requirement.

**Status:** Closed.

---

### G3: Minimum Compliance (Sessions Without Substance)

**Attack:** Legislature meets all session requirements but refuses to enact coordination legislation, instead debating symbolic resolutions and naming post offices.

**Countermeasure:** Subsection (c) requires enactment or reaffirmation of coordination legislation for each Article II, Section 2 power. Subsection (c)(3) defines "exercised" to require substantive legislation AND sufficient appropriation. Merely meeting session requirements does not satisfy the coordination mandate.

**Status:** Closed.

---

### G4: Delegation Void (Laws Without Implementation)

**Attack:** Legislature passes coordination framework laws but refuses to fund them, or delegates to phantom agencies with no staff or budget.

**Countermeasure:** Subsection (c)(2) requires appropriations of at least 50% of independently estimated implementation cost. Subsection (c)(5) requires funded/staffed agencies for delegation. Subsection (f)(1)(C) prohibits delegation to incapable entities.

**Status:** Closed.

---

### G5: ARB Capture or Manipulation

**Attack:** Political allies capture the ARB and either (a) refuse to certify obvious failures to protect an allied Region, or (b) manufacture failure findings against a disfavored Region.

**Countermeasure:** Subsection (d)(2)(D) requires majority vote with opportunity for Region to respond. Subsection (d)(6) provides judicial review under substantial evidence standard. ARB composition is independently established elsewhere in the constitution.

**Residual risk:** ARB capture remains a system-wide vulnerability. If the ARB itself is compromised, many constitutional safeguards — not just this one — fail. This is a cross-cutting concern beyond the scope of this gap resolution.

**Status:** Open (cross-cutting ARB integrity issue).

---

### G6: Quorum Manipulation

**Attack:** Members boycott sessions to prevent quorum, but the legislature "convenes" — blame falls on individual absentees, not the institution.

**Countermeasure:** Subsection (b)(2) requires quorum on 60 days. The certification trigger in subsection (d)(1)(A) examines institutional output, not individual blame. If the legislature lacks quorum for the required 60 days, session failure is certified regardless of why individual members were absent.

**Status:** Closed.

---

### G7: State Assumption Blocking

**Attack:** The constituent States within a Region also refuse to act — the joint resolution never passes, and the federal backstop is too narrow to substitute for full coordination.

**Countermeasure:** Subsection (g) federal backstop authorizes federal agencies for public safety functions. However, this is deliberately narrow — covering only imminent harm to public safety, not full coordination power exercise.

**Residual risk:** If both Regional and State levels refuse to govern, and the coordination failure does not create a public safety emergency, the constitutional design accepts partial non-function as the cost of distributed power. The political remedy is electoral replacement at both Regional and State levels.

**Status:** Open (deliberate design choice — partial non-function accepted over centralization).

---

### G8: Restoration Gaming

**Attack:** Regional Legislature briefly resumes function to trigger ARB restoration certification, then immediately stops governing again.

**Countermeasure:** Subsection (e)(4) imposes escalating consequences: second failure within 4 years reduces cure to 90 days; third failure within 8 years eliminates cure entirely. Subsection (d)(4) requires substantive action (enact legislation + appropriate funds), not just convening.

**Status:** Closed.

---

### G9: Recall Weaponization

**Attack:** Accountability provisions in subsection (f)(3) are used to threaten recall against minority legislators who dissent from coordination legislation, chilling legitimate political opposition.

**Countermeasure:** Subsection (f)(3) explicitly states "nothing in this paragraph creates a cause of action against individual legislators for their votes or legislative decisions." The recall provision applies to "coordinated refusal to exercise constitutionally mandated legislative duties" — a collective institutional failure, not individual legislative disagreement.

**Residual risk:** In practice, distinguishing "coordinated refusal" from legitimate political opposition may be difficult, particularly where a majority opposes specific coordination legislation on policy grounds. The recall provision could be weaponized in highly polarized environments.

**Status:** Open (line-drawing difficulty between coordinated refusal and legitimate opposition).

---

### G10: Appropriation Minimalism (Token Funding)

**Attack:** Legislature appropriates technically non-zero but manifestly insufficient funding ($100 for a public health coordination program).

**Countermeasure:** Subsection (c)(2) sets a 50% floor relative to independently estimated implementation cost. Subsection (f)(2)(B) identifies "token appropriations manifestly insufficient for implementation" as a pattern of evasion the ARB may consider.

**Status:** Closed.

---

## Design Decisions

| DD# | Decision | Rationale |
|-----|----------|-----------|
| DD-1 | Section numbering: 3-B (not 3(t)-(bb)) | Matches existing pattern of Section 3-A for Electoral Standards Enforcement; avoids assuming nonexistent lettered subsections in Section 3 |
| DD-2 | 90-day annual session minimum, 60-day quorum minimum | Consistent with gap proposal; sufficient for substantive legislation; not so high as to burden small Regions |
| DD-3 | Two-year legislative cycle for coordination exercise | Aligns with standard legislative cycles; provides adequate time for legislative process |
| DD-4 | ARB certification as trigger (not judicial or federal) | ARB already has certification roles (Art II §1(e)(4), Art III §3-A); maintains institutional consistency |
| DD-5 | 180-day cure period | Balances urgency against good-faith opportunity; long enough for full legislative session |
| DD-6 | State assumption via majority of constituent State legislatures | Democratic legitimacy within the Region; prevents single-State capture of Regional powers |
| DD-7 | Joint State Legislative Council with proportional representation | Ensures population-proportional governance during assumption; prevents small-State domination |
| DD-8 | Scope limitation: assumed powers only | Prevents State assumption from becoming de facto Regional government displacement |
| DD-9 | Anti-evasion provisions including appropriation sufficiency | Closes minimum compliance and delegation void vectors identified in gap analysis |
| DD-10 | Federal backstop limited to public safety | Narrow scope prevents federal encroachment on exclusive Regional domains; accepts partial non-function over centralization |
| DD-11 | Recall eligibility (not 5-year disqualification) | Gap proposal's disqualification is disproportionate and weaponizable; recall preserves democratic choice |
| DD-12 | Escalating consequences for repeat failure (4yr/8yr windows) | Prevents indefinite cycling between failure and restoration; creates increasing urgency |
| DD-13 | 50% of independently estimated cost as appropriation floor | Objective threshold prevents token funding; 50% allows legitimate budget constraints while ensuring minimal viability |
| DD-14 | [v2] IFC as primary cost estimator; ARB conflict-of-interest bar (resolves S1) | v1 allowed ARB to serve as both cost estimator (when no Regional fiscal office exists) and failure certifier — creating a dual-role conflict vulnerable to capture or cost inflation/deflation disputes. IFC is the neutral fiscal body; published methodology + per-cycle updates create transparency. Regional fiscal office serves as fallback. ARB is explicitly barred from estimating costs for powers it may certify as failed. |
| DD-15 | [v2] Pro forma session defined with objective criteria (resolves S2) | v1's "no substantive business" was subjective and litigable. Three objective indicators: (A) <30 minutes duration, (B) no committee/floor action or recorded votes, (C) only ceremonial/adjournment/quorum actions. Any session including at least one committee hearing, floor debate, or recorded vote is non-pro-forma regardless of duration. Closes token-session gaming while avoiding over-prescription. |
| DD-16 | [v2] Reaffirmation defined + deregulatory frameworks count as substantive (resolves S3 + Q4) | v1's undefined "reaffirm" invited one-line rubber-stamp votes. Committee review + recorded floor vote ensures genuine assessment of existing legislation. Explicitly allowing deregulatory frameworks (provided they still address the domain and don't eliminate all regulation) prevents the system from forcing affirmative regulation when the policy choice is lighter-touch governance. Resolves Q4: a deregulatory framework IS exercising a coordination power if it establishes at least minimum standards. |
| DD-17 | [v2] JSLC apportionment: census-based, minimum 1 seat, 50-member cap (resolves S4) | v1's "proportional to State populations" lacked a formula, risking disputes that stall assumption. Tying to most recent census/intercensal estimate provides an objective, readily available baseline. Minimum 1 seat prevents small-State exclusion. 50-member cap prevents unwieldy bodies while accommodating large Regions with many States. |
| DD-18 | [v2] 90-day ARB restoration deadline with automatic termination (resolves S5) | v1 had no deadline for ARB to act on restoration, allowing slow or captured ARB to indefinitely prolong State assumption even after the Regional Legislature resumes function. 90-day deadline with automatic restoration on expiration ensures State assumption cannot become permanent through bureaucratic delay. Regional Legislature triggers the clock by formal notification. |
| DD-19 | [v3] IFC 120-day determination deadline + ARB challenge authority (resolves S1) | v2's IFC-as-primary-estimator could be stalled by IFC non-response, leaving the Region to self-certify low cost via its own fiscal office. 120-day deadline creates a clear trigger. ARB can challenge manifestly unreasonable fiscal office estimates by submitting them back to IFC for expedited review — preventing cost manipulation without returning to the prohibited dual-role. |
| DD-20 | [v3] Cure evidence required before restoration clock starts (resolves S2) | v2's auto-termination let a Region run out the 90-day clock by notifying "resumed function" without proof. Now notification must include certified copies of enacted coordination legislation and appropriation records. The 90-day clock starts only upon ARB acknowledgment of complete documentation — preventing clock gaming while preserving the automatic termination safeguard against ARB delay. |
| DD-21 | [v3] Illusory regulation as anti-circumvention pattern (resolves S3) | v2 allowed deregulatory frameworks but didn't address legislation that technically addresses a domain while establishing no operative mechanisms. New (f)(2)(D) adds "illusory regulation" — legislation with no operative coordination mechanisms, standards, or requirements — as an evasion pattern the ARB may consider. ARB may deem such legislation non-exercise under (c)(3), closing the minimal-standards-to-zero loophole. |
| DD-22 | [v3] Session day vs. coordination exercise clarification (resolves S4) | v2 defined pro forma sessions but a 31-minute session with one ceremonial vote could technically avoid pro forma classification under (b)(5) while adding nothing to coordination. New clarification in (b)(5) states qualification under that paragraph satisfies session requirements only — not coordination exercise under (c). Prevents token sessions from bootstrapping into compliance credit. |
| DD-23 | [v3] Huntington-Hill apportionment for JSLC (resolves S5) | v2 used "proportional" without specifying rounding. Huntington-Hill (method of equal proportions) is the constitutionally established method for U.S. House apportionment since 1941, providing a well-understood, judicially tested baseline. Eliminates ambiguity about fractional-seat allocation. |

## Open Questions

| Q# | Question | Options | Leaning |
|----|----------|---------|---------|
| Q1 | Should session failure require two consecutive years, or should a single year of failure suffice for certification? | Two years (current draft) vs. single year with immediate cure period | Resolved: two consecutive years (DD-3) — avoids penalizing genuine one-year disruptions |
| Q2 | Should individual legislative immunity be waived for participation in coordinated refusal to legislate? | Yes (gap proposal) vs. No (current draft preserves immunity, relies on recall only) | Resolved: no waiver (DD-11) — recall preserves democratic choice without chilling legislative independence |
| Q3 | Should the federal backstop extend beyond public safety to include economic coordination functions? | Narrow (current: public safety only) vs. Broader (economic coordination, infrastructure) | Resolved: narrow backstop (DD-10) — broader scope invites federal encroachment |
| Q4 | What constitutes "addressing" a coordination power when the legislature has a genuine policy disagreement about the appropriate level of regulation? | Deregulatory frameworks count as substantive legislation under §3-B(c)(6) if they address the coordination domain and do not eliminate all regulation; total non-regulation does not constitute "exercise" | DD-16 |
