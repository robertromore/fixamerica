# Gap 27 — Tribal-Regional Relations (Operational Framework)

## Status: DRAFT v3 FINAL

## Changelog

- **v3 FINAL** (2026-02-04): R2 convergence. 5 findings accepted (0 contradictions, 0 complementary, 5 single-reviewer). §9(c)(6) adds emergency exception for adjacent-area actions — 72-hour notice + 30-day post-action consultation + federal court review (S1-R2/DD-14). §9(c)(2) adds concurrent satisfaction with §8, longer period governs (S2-R2/DD-15). §12(b)(4) adds NCC review of ARB certification — legal standard + substantial evidence (S3-R2/DD-16, resolves Q3). §11(c)(4) adds automatic mediation trigger + bad-faith presumption for gaming compact non-response (S4-R2/DD-17). §12(a)(2) adds national-scope body fallback — majority of all federally recognized Tribal Nations nationwide (S5-R2/DD-18). 9 gaming vectors, 18 design decisions, 2 open questions (-1).
- **v2** (2026-02-04): R1 convergence. 5 findings accepted (0 contradictions, 0 complementary, 5 single-reviewer). §9(c) replaces consent veto with heightened-scrutiny standard — compelling public necessity + judicial review + defined "material degradation" with monitoring anchor + 90-day extended consultation (S1/DD-9). §11(c)(3) replaces statutory cross-reference with self-contained good-faith standard (S2/DD-10). §11(b)(3) changes from unilateral renegotiation to request-with-mediation (S3/DD-11). §9(b)(2) narrows to "similarly situated governments" with treaty/sovereign exceptions (S4/DD-12). §12(a)(2) adds fallback appointment via Regional tribal consensus if NCAI contested (S5/DD-13). Q2 resolved via S1/DD-9. 8 gaming vectors, 13 design decisions, 3 open questions (-1).
- **v1** (2026-02-04): Initial draft. Pre-existing coverage analysis identified Art XXIII (Gap 253) as resolving sovereignty, treaty supremacy, consent, and cross-boundary issues. Remaining gaps: mandatory consultation, off-reservation protections, compact negotiation standards, DLRS applicability, transition provisions, adjacent-impact safeguards, IGC representation. Proposes Art XXIII §§8-12 targeting operational gaps.

---

## Problem Statement

The constitution establishes tribal sovereignty protections (Art XXIII §§1-7) and Regional-Tribal coordination requirements (Art XX §3), but leaves operational mechanics under-specified:

1. **Consultation is aspirational, not mandatory**: Art XXIII §6 says Regions "are encouraged" to enter compacts — no duty to consult before actions affecting tribes.

2. **Off-reservation tribal members unprotected**: Nothing guarantees service access or non-discrimination for tribal members living off-reservation within Regions.

3. **Compact negotiations lack safeguards**: Art XX §3(d) requires "good faith" but provides no anti-coercion provisions, timeline, or default mechanisms when negotiations fail.

4. **DLRS applicability undefined**: Tribal nations' relationship to Dual Legitimacy Rights Floors is unspecified — could be construed to impose external governance standards on sovereign nations.

5. **Transition provisions absent**: No mechanism transfers existing state-tribal agreements (gaming compacts, tax agreements) to successor Regions.

6. **Adjacent-impact loophole**: Regions can degrade resources, water, or environment *near* tribal lands without triggering protections.

7. **No IGC representation**: Tribal nations have no voice on Intergovernmental Council bodies whose decisions affect tribal interests.

## Proposed Resolution: Tribal-Regional Operational Framework

### Placement

**Article XXIII, Sections 8-12** (following existing §§1-7)

---

### Section 8. Mandatory Consultation [v1]

> (a) **Duty to Consult.** Before taking any action that may significantly affect tribal interests, Regional governments shall: [v1]
>
> - (1) identify Tribal Nations that may be affected; [v1]
> - (2) notify those Tribal Nations of the proposed action with sufficient detail to enable meaningful response; [v1]
> - (3) provide not less than sixty (60) days for tribal comment; [v1]
> - (4) meet with tribal representatives upon request at times and locations reasonably convenient for tribal participation; [v1]
> - (5) document consultation in writing and include the record in any administrative proceeding. [v1]
>
> (b) **Triggering Actions.** "Significantly affect tribal interests" includes actions that: [v1]
>
> - (1) affect tribal lands or waters, or areas adjacent thereto; [v1]
> - (2) affect treaty-protected resources including hunting, fishing, and gathering rights; [v1]
> - (3) affect tribal cultural resources, sacred sites, or ancestral remains; [v1]
> - (4) affect transportation or infrastructure providing access to tribal lands; [v1]
> - (5) affect environmental quality of areas where tribal members exercise treaty rights. [v1]
>
> (c) **Genuine Consideration.** Consultation requires good-faith consideration of tribal views. Regions need not obtain tribal consent except where required by other provisions, but shall provide written explanation when declining to adopt tribal recommendations. [v1]
>
> (d) **Emergency Exception.** In genuine emergencies requiring immediate action to protect public safety, Regions may act without prior consultation. Post-action consultation shall occur within thirty (30) days. If the Tribal Nation objects, the Region shall consider modifying or reversing the action. [v1]
>
> (e) **Failure to Consult.** Actions taken without required consultation: [v1]
>
> - (1) are voidable upon challenge by an affected Tribal Nation; [v1]
> - (2) may be enjoined pending completion of consultation; [v1]
> - (3) the Region bears all costs of delay resulting from its failure to consult. [v1]

---

### Section 9. Off-Reservation Protections [v1]

> (a) **Service Access.** Tribal members residing off-reservation within a Region are entitled to: [v1]
>
> - (1) Regional public services on the same terms as other residents; [v1]
> - (2) recognition of tribal identification for purposes of Regional services; [v1]
> - (3) non-discrimination based on tribal membership or affiliation. [v1]
>
> (b) **Prohibited Discrimination.** Regional law may not: [v1]
>
> - (1) discriminate against tribal members in employment, housing, or public accommodations; [v1]
> - (2) treat tribal governments less favorably than similarly situated governments in the same program or service context, excluding differences required by treaty obligations or sovereign-specific procedures; [v2: narrowed to similarly situated + treaty/sovereign exceptions]
> - (3) impose special burdens on businesses owned by tribal members or Tribal Nations operating off-reservation. [v1]
>
> (c) **Adjacent-Area Protections.** [v2: heightened scrutiny replaces consent veto]
>
> - (1) For purposes of this subsection, "material degradation" means a measurable decline in environmental quality — including air quality, water quality, soil integrity, or ecological function — as documented by federal, tribal, or independent environmental monitoring, that adversely affects tribal lands, treaty-protected resources, or areas where tribal members exercise treaty-protected rights; [v2: defined term with monitoring anchor]
> - (2) Before taking any action that would cause material degradation of areas adjacent to tribal lands, a Region shall provide the affected Tribal Nation with notice and a ninety (90) day consultation period; where the action also triggers Section 8 consultation, the Region may satisfy both requirements concurrently by designating the consultation as addressing both Section 8 and Section 9(c) obligations, provided the ninety (90) day period of this subsection governs; [v2: extended notice] [v3: concurrent satisfaction with §8 — longer period governs]
> - (3) If the affected Tribal Nation objects, the Region may proceed only upon a federal court finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that: (i) the action serves a compelling public necessity; (ii) no feasible alternative exists that avoids or substantially reduces the adverse impact; and (iii) the Region has implemented all practicable mitigation measures; [v2: compelling-necessity judicial standard replaces consent veto]
> - (4) Regions may not materially impair access to tribal lands through adjacent Regional territory; [v1]
> - (5) Regions may not materially reduce water flow or water quality affecting tribal lands or treaty-protected fisheries; [v1]
> - (6) In genuine emergencies requiring immediate action to protect public safety, a Region may take actions that may cause material degradation of adjacent areas without prior compliance with subsections (c)(2) and (c)(3); the Region shall provide written notice to the affected Tribal Nation within seventy-two (72) hours and complete post-action consultation within thirty (30) days; upon tribal objection, the Region shall seek federal court review within sixty (60) days, during which the court may order restoration or mitigation. [v3: emergency exception for adjacent-area heightened scrutiny]
>
> (d) **Enforcement.** Violations of this Section are actionable in federal court with the remedies of Section 5. [v1]

---

### Section 10. Coordination Compact Framework [v1]

> (a) **Mandatory Compacts.** Pursuant to Article XX, Section 3(d), Regions and Tribal Nations shall negotiate compacts addressing: [v1]
>
> - (1) shared services and infrastructure coordination; [v1]
> - (2) emergency response and mutual aid; [v1]
> - (3) law enforcement cooperation and jurisdictional boundaries; [v1]
> - (4) environmental monitoring and resource management. [v1]
>
> (b) **Anti-Coercion.** Regions may not: [v1]
>
> - (1) condition Regional services to tribal members on compact terms; [v1]
> - (2) withhold cooperation on one compact matter to gain leverage on another; [v1]
> - (3) threaten fiscal, regulatory, or administrative retaliation for tribal negotiating positions. [v1]
>
> (c) **Negotiation Timeline.** [v1]
>
> - (1) Initial compacts shall be negotiated within two (2) years of Regional activation; [v1]
> - (2) either party may request mediation through the Department of Interior after one (1) year; [v1]
> - (3) mediation shall conclude within one hundred eighty (180) days. [v1]
>
> (d) **Default Provisions.** If no compact is reached: [v1]
>
> - (1) existing agreements between predecessor States and the Tribal Nation remain in effect; [v1]
> - (2) the Region may not exercise any authority on tribal lands; [v1]
> - (3) federal agencies shall provide services and coordination functions until compact is reached. [v1]
>
> (e) **Compact Modification.** Compacts may be modified by mutual consent. Either party may request renegotiation after five (5) years. [v1]

---

### Section 11. DLRS and Transition [v1]

> (a) **DLRS Applicability.** [v1]
>
> - (1) Tribal Nations are not subject to Dual Legitimacy Rights Floor requirements except by consent through formal action of their governing body; [v1]
> - (2) consent may be revoked by the same process; [v1]
> - (3) partial consent (specific DLRS provisions only) is permitted; [v1]
> - (4) DLRS applicability has no effect on other aspects of the Tribal Nation's relationship with the United States or Regions. [v1]
>
> (b) **Successor Agreements.** Agreements between predecessor States and Tribal Nations: [v1]
>
> - (1) transfer to successor Regions upon Regional activation; [v1]
> - (2) remain in full force until modified by mutual consent or expiration; [v1]
> - (3) either party may request renegotiation within three (3) years of Regional activation; if the other party declines, the requesting party may invoke mediation under Section 10(c). [v2: request-with-mediation replaces unilateral renegotiation right]
>
> (c) **Gaming Compacts.** Gaming compacts under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act: [v1]
>
> - (1) transfer to successor Regions; [v1]
> - (2) Regions shall negotiate renewals in good faith; [v1]
> - (3) good-faith negotiation requires Regions to respond to tribal proposals within sixty (60) days, provide substantive counterproposals rather than blanket refusals, and refrain from conditioning renewal on concessions unrelated to gaming operations; [v2: self-contained standard replaces statutory cross-reference]
> - (4) if a Region fails to respond to a tribal gaming compact proposal within the sixty (60) day period of subsection (c)(3), the Tribal Nation may invoke mediation under Section 10(c); the Region's non-response creates a rebuttable presumption of bad faith in mediation proceedings. [v3: automatic mediation trigger for non-response]
>
> (d) **Federal Program Continuity.** When federal programs are block-granted to Regions: [v1]
>
> - (1) tribal set-asides shall be maintained at pre-transition levels, adjusted for population; [v1]
> - (2) Tribal Nations may elect direct federal funding where available; [v1]
> - (3) Regions may not impose conditions on tribal use of federal funds beyond those in federal law. [v1]

---

### Section 12. Intergovernmental Council Representation [v1]

> (a) **IGC Tribal Seat.** For any federal-Regional council, board, or commission established under this Constitution or by federal law whose policy domain directly and substantially affects tribal lands, resources, or treaty rights: [v1]
>
> - (1) at least one voting seat shall be reserved for a representative of Tribal Nations; [v1]
> - (2) the President shall appoint such representative in consultation with the National Congress of American Indians or successor organization representing federally recognized tribes; if no single representative organization is recognized, the President shall appoint from among candidates nominated by a majority of federally recognized Tribal Nations within the affected Region(s), or, for bodies of national scope, by a majority of all federally recognized Tribal Nations nationwide; [v2: fallback via Regional tribal consensus] [v3: national-scope body fallback]
> - (3) the tribal representative shall have full participation rights including voting, committee membership, and access to information. [v1]
>
> (b) **Domain Determination.** The ARB shall certify which federal-Regional bodies "directly and substantially affect" tribal interests. This certification: [v1]
>
> - (1) shall be issued within ninety (90) days of a request by any Tribal Nation or the body in question; [v1]
> - (2) is binding absent clear error; [v1]
> - (3) shall be reconsidered if the body's jurisdiction materially changes; [v1]
> - (4) may be reviewed by the NCC upon petition by any Tribal Nation; review is limited to whether the ARB applied the correct legal standard and whether the certification is supported by substantial evidence. [v3: NCC review of ARB certification — resolves Q3]
>
> (c) **Non-Voting Observers.** Federal-Regional bodies not certified under subsection (b) shall nonetheless permit non-voting tribal observers when: [v1]
>
> - (1) a Tribal Nation demonstrates substantial interest in the body's proceedings; [v1]
> - (2) the observation does not compromise national security or law enforcement operations. [v1]

## Gaming Vectors Identified

| # | Vector | Mechanism | Countermeasure |
|---|--------|-----------|----------------|
| G1 | Consultation theater | Region holds perfunctory meetings, ignores input | §8(c) requires written explanation when declining tribal recommendations; §8(e) makes non-consultation voidable |
| G2 | Adjacent-area exploitation | Region pollutes or develops *near* tribal land | §9(c) defines "material degradation" with monitoring anchor; requires 90-day consultation + compelling-necessity judicial review before proceeding over tribal objection [v2] |
| G3 | Compact coercion | Region conditions unrelated services on compact terms | §10(b) anti-coercion provisions explicitly prohibit conditioning, linkage, or retaliation |
| G4 | Stall tactics | Region delays compact negotiation indefinitely | §10(c) timeline with mediation trigger; §10(d) defaults preserve existing agreements |
| G5 | DLRS imposition | Future interpretation extends DLRS to tribes | §11(a) explicit exclusion with formal consent requirement |
| G6 | Gaming compact hostage | Region refuses good-faith renewal | §11(c)(3) self-contained good-faith standard: 60-day response, substantive counterproposals, no unrelated conditioning [v2] |
| G7 | Block grant diversion | Region redirects tribal set-asides | §11(d) maintains set-asides and allows direct federal funding election |
| G8 | IGC exclusion | Tribal interests affected but no voice | §12 mandatory tribal seat on bodies affecting tribal interests |
| G9 | Emergency pretext | Region invokes §9(c)(6) emergency exception to bypass heightened scrutiny for non-emergency actions | §9(c)(6) requires "genuine emergencies" + 72-hour notice + 30-day post-action consultation + federal court review on tribal objection; pattern of pretextual emergency claims itself actionable [v3] |

---

## Design Decisions

| # | Decision | Rationale | Alternative Considered |
|---|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| D1 | 60-day consultation window | Balance between meaningful time and administrative efficiency | 30 days (too short for tribal council processes); 90 days (delays legitimate projects) |
| D2 | Adjacent-area heightened scrutiny for degradation [v2: upgraded from consent — see DD-9] | Treaty rights often extend beyond reservation boundaries; consent veto was overreach per R1 review | Consent veto (overreach); notification only (insufficient protection) |
| D3 | Two-year compact deadline | Allows negotiation while creating urgency | Immediate default (unrealistic); open-ended (enables stalling) |
| D4 | Federal backstop when no compact | Prevents service gap without forcing unfavorable agreement | Regional unilateral authority (coercive); permanent federal takeover (undermines regionalism) |
| D5 | DLRS opt-in only | Respects tribal sovereignty over internal governance | Automatic application (violates sovereignty); no provision (ambiguity) |
| D6 | Tribal set-aside preservation | Block grants shouldn't dilute tribal funding | Proportional Regional allocation (disadvantages small tribes); tribal veto (impractical) |
| D7 | NCAI consultation for IGC appointment | Established representative organization | Direct tribal election (complex); pure executive discretion (potential capture) |
| D8 | ARB certification of IGC scope | Neutral determination prevents gaming | Self-certification by bodies (fox guarding henhouse); automatic inclusion of all bodies (dilutes voice) |
| D9 | [v2] Adjacent-area: heightened scrutiny replaces consent veto (resolves S1 + OQ + Q2) | Consent created extra-territorial veto power without defined thresholds, risking litigation for ordinary projects. Heightened scrutiny — compelling public necessity + no feasible alternative + practicable mitigation — balances tribal protection with Regional governance. "Material degradation" defined with monitoring anchor. 90-day extended consultation provides meaningful tribal input without permanent veto. Clear-and-convincing evidence standard calibrates burden appropriately. | Hard consent veto (overreach per reviewer); notification only (insufficient protection) |
| D10 | [v2] IGRA standard paraphrased as self-contained definition (resolves S2) | Constitutional provisions should not auto-update when referenced statutes change. 25 U.S.C. §2710(d)(3) could be weakened by future Congress, automatically weakening the constitutional standard. Self-contained definition (60-day response, substantive counterproposals, no unrelated conditioning) captures the core obligation. | Lock to "as in effect on ratification" (creates interpretation disputes about historical text) |
| D11 | [v2] Request-to-renegotiate with mediation fallback (resolves S3) | Unilateral renegotiation right could destabilize long-term compacts. Request-with-mediation preserves renegotiation access while protecting negotiated stability. Mediation through existing §10(c) mechanism avoids institutional proliferation. | Renegotiation by mutual consent only (locks out disadvantaged party); unilateral right (original — destabilizing) |
| D12 | [v2] Anti-discrimination narrowed to "similarly situated" with exceptions (resolves S4) | "Less favorably than other governments" was ambiguous — could bar treaty-based allocations or sovereign-specific procedures that legitimately differentiate. "Similarly situated" limits comparison to same program context. Treaty and sovereign exceptions preserve legitimate differentiation. | Original broad standard (overbroad); enumerated program list (under-inclusive) |
| D13 | [v2] NCAI appointment fallback via Regional tribal consensus (resolves S5) | NCAI is currently the primary representative body, but institutional landscapes change. If NCAI dissolves or multiple organizations claim representative status, a fallback prevents appointment paralysis. Majority of federally recognized Tribal Nations within affected Region(s) provides democratic legitimacy. | Rotation among organizations (complex scheduling); presidential discretion only (capture risk) |
| D14 | [v3] Emergency exception for adjacent-area actions (resolves S1-R2 + OQ-R2) | Time-critical situations (e.g., industrial accident, flood response) may require actions near tribal lands without 90-day consultation. 72-hour post-action notice + 30-day consultation + federal court review on objection balances emergency response with tribal protection. Court may order restoration. | No exception (blocks genuine emergencies); broader exception (enables pretext) |
| D15 | [v3] Concurrent satisfaction of §8 and §9(c) consultation (resolves S2-R2) | Separate 60-day (§8) and 90-day (§9(c)) consultations for the same action create 150-day sequential obligation. Concurrent satisfaction eliminates redundancy while preserving the longer 90-day period when both apply. Region must designate dual-purpose consultation explicitly. | Sequential consultations (150 days excessive); single 60-day period only (insufficient for environmental impacts) |
| D16 | [v3] NCC review of ARB certification decisions (resolves Q3 + S3-R2) | "Binding absent clear error" with no appeal path denies tribal recourse. NCC review on petition provides meaningful check while limiting to legal-standard and substantial-evidence review prevents de novo re-litigation. | No appeal (original — denies recourse); full de novo NCC review (undermines ARB expertise and creates delay) |
| D17 | [v3] Automatic mediation trigger for gaming compact non-response (resolves S4-R2) | 60-day response duty without remedy for non-compliance is toothless. Automatic mediation invocation + rebuttable bad-faith presumption creates meaningful consequences for stonewalling while allowing Regions to rebut if non-response was justified. | No remedy (toothless obligation); automatic favorable ruling for tribe (disproportionate) |
| D18 | [v3] National-scope body fallback for IGC representation (resolves S5-R2) | Regional-tribal consensus fallback doesn't work for bodies of national scope where no single Region is "affected." Majority of all federally recognized Tribal Nations nationwide provides democratic legitimacy for national bodies. Keeps Regional fallback for Regional-scope bodies. | Regional fallback only (unworkable for national bodies); population-weighted voting (disadvantages small tribes) |

## Open Questions for Review

| # | Question | Resolution | Design Decision |
|---|----------|------------|-----------------|
| Q1 | Should the consultation window be longer for certain action types (e.g., environmental reviews)? | *Open* | — |
| Q2 | Is "material degradation" sufficiently defined for adjacent-area protections? | Yes — defined with monitoring anchor in §9(c)(1) + 90-day extended consultation in §9(c)(2) | DD-9 |
| Q3 | Should there be an appeals mechanism for ARB IGC certification decisions? | Yes — NCC review on petition, limited to legal standard and substantial evidence | DD-16 |
| Q4 | Does the anti-coercion provision in §10(b) have sufficient enforcement mechanisms? | *Open* | — |

## Relationship to Other Gaps

| Gap | Relationship |
|-----|--------------|
| **Gap 99 (Tribal Veto via Infrastructure Entrapment)** | Resolved via Art XX §3(g-t); Gap 27 addresses non-infrastructure operational issues |
| **Gap 253 (Indigenous/Treaty Sovereignty)** | Resolved via Art XXIII §§1-7; Gap 27 adds operational mechanics to existing sovereignty framework |
| **Gap 59 (State-Regional Preemption)** | Related — Regional preemption explicitly excludes tribal lands |
| **Gap 60 (Para-Diplomacy)** | Related — Tribal nations have distinct foreign engagement rights under treaty obligations |

## Constitutional Text (Clean)

*For integration — version annotations stripped.*

### Section 8. Mandatory Consultation

(a) **Duty to Consult.** Before taking any action that may significantly affect tribal interests, Regional governments shall:

- (1) identify Tribal Nations that may be affected;
- (2) notify those Tribal Nations of the proposed action with sufficient detail to enable meaningful response;
- (3) provide not less than sixty (60) days for tribal comment;
- (4) meet with tribal representatives upon request at times and locations reasonably convenient for tribal participation;
- (5) document consultation in writing and include the record in any administrative proceeding.

(b) **Triggering Actions.** "Significantly affect tribal interests" includes actions that:

- (1) affect tribal lands or waters, or areas adjacent thereto;
- (2) affect treaty-protected resources including hunting, fishing, and gathering rights;
- (3) affect tribal cultural resources, sacred sites, or ancestral remains;
- (4) affect transportation or infrastructure providing access to tribal lands;
- (5) affect environmental quality of areas where tribal members exercise treaty rights.

(c) **Genuine Consideration.** Consultation requires good-faith consideration of tribal views. Regions need not obtain tribal consent except where required by other provisions, but shall provide written explanation when declining to adopt tribal recommendations.

(d) **Emergency Exception.** In genuine emergencies requiring immediate action to protect public safety, Regions may act without prior consultation. Post-action consultation shall occur within thirty (30) days. If the Tribal Nation objects, the Region shall consider modifying or reversing the action.

(e) **Failure to Consult.** Actions taken without required consultation:

- (1) are voidable upon challenge by an affected Tribal Nation;
- (2) may be enjoined pending completion of consultation;
- (3) the Region bears all costs of delay resulting from its failure to consult.

---

### Section 9. Off-Reservation Protections

(a) **Service Access.** Tribal members residing off-reservation within a Region are entitled to:

- (1) Regional public services on the same terms as other residents;
- (2) recognition of tribal identification for purposes of Regional services;
- (3) non-discrimination based on tribal membership or affiliation.

(b) **Prohibited Discrimination.** Regional law may not:

- (1) discriminate against tribal members in employment, housing, or public accommodations;
- (2) treat tribal governments less favorably than similarly situated governments in the same program or service context, excluding differences required by treaty obligations or sovereign-specific procedures;
- (3) impose special burdens on businesses owned by tribal members or Tribal Nations operating off-reservation.

(c) **Adjacent-Area Protections.**

- (1) For purposes of this subsection, "material degradation" means a measurable decline in environmental quality — including air quality, water quality, soil integrity, or ecological function — as documented by federal, tribal, or independent environmental monitoring, that adversely affects tribal lands, treaty-protected resources, or areas where tribal members exercise treaty-protected rights;
- (2) Before taking any action that would cause material degradation of areas adjacent to tribal lands, a Region shall provide the affected Tribal Nation with notice and a ninety (90) day consultation period; where the action also triggers Section 8 consultation, the Region may satisfy both requirements concurrently by designating the consultation as addressing both Section 8 and Section 9(c) obligations, provided the ninety (90) day period of this subsection governs;
- (3) If the affected Tribal Nation objects, the Region may proceed only upon a federal court finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that: (i) the action serves a compelling public necessity; (ii) no feasible alternative exists that avoids or substantially reduces the adverse impact; and (iii) the Region has implemented all practicable mitigation measures;
- (4) Regions may not materially impair access to tribal lands through adjacent Regional territory;
- (5) Regions may not materially reduce water flow or water quality affecting tribal lands or treaty-protected fisheries;
- (6) In genuine emergencies requiring immediate action to protect public safety, a Region may take actions that may cause material degradation of adjacent areas without prior compliance with subsections (c)(2) and (c)(3); the Region shall provide written notice to the affected Tribal Nation within seventy-two (72) hours and complete post-action consultation within thirty (30) days; upon tribal objection, the Region shall seek federal court review within sixty (60) days, during which the court may order restoration or mitigation.

(d) **Enforcement.** Violations of this Section are actionable in federal court with the remedies of Section 5.

---

### Section 10. Coordination Compact Framework

(a) **Mandatory Compacts.** Pursuant to Article XX, Section 3(d), Regions and Tribal Nations shall negotiate compacts addressing:

- (1) shared services and infrastructure coordination;
- (2) emergency response and mutual aid;
- (3) law enforcement cooperation and jurisdictional boundaries;
- (4) environmental monitoring and resource management.

(b) **Anti-Coercion.** Regions may not:

- (1) condition Regional services to tribal members on compact terms;
- (2) withhold cooperation on one compact matter to gain leverage on another;
- (3) threaten fiscal, regulatory, or administrative retaliation for tribal negotiating positions.

(c) **Negotiation Timeline.**

- (1) Initial compacts shall be negotiated within two (2) years of Regional activation;
- (2) either party may request mediation through the Department of Interior after one (1) year;
- (3) mediation shall conclude within one hundred eighty (180) days.

(d) **Default Provisions.** If no compact is reached:

- (1) existing agreements between predecessor States and the Tribal Nation remain in effect;
- (2) the Region may not exercise any authority on tribal lands;
- (3) federal agencies shall provide services and coordination functions until compact is reached.

(e) **Compact Modification.** Compacts may be modified by mutual consent. Either party may request renegotiation after five (5) years.

---

### Section 11. DLRS and Transition

(a) **DLRS Applicability.**

- (1) Tribal Nations are not subject to Dual Legitimacy Rights Floor requirements except by consent through formal action of their governing body;
- (2) consent may be revoked by the same process;
- (3) partial consent (specific DLRS provisions only) is permitted;
- (4) DLRS applicability has no effect on other aspects of the Tribal Nation's relationship with the United States or Regions.

(b) **Successor Agreements.** Agreements between predecessor States and Tribal Nations:

- (1) transfer to successor Regions upon Regional activation;
- (2) remain in full force until modified by mutual consent or expiration;
- (3) either party may request renegotiation within three (3) years of Regional activation; if the other party declines, the requesting party may invoke mediation under Section 10(c).

(c) **Gaming Compacts.** Gaming compacts under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act:

- (1) transfer to successor Regions;
- (2) Regions shall negotiate renewals in good faith;
- (3) good-faith negotiation requires Regions to respond to tribal proposals within sixty (60) days, provide substantive counterproposals rather than blanket refusals, and refrain from conditioning renewal on concessions unrelated to gaming operations;
- (4) if a Region fails to respond to a tribal gaming compact proposal within the sixty (60) day period of subsection (c)(3), the Tribal Nation may invoke mediation under Section 10(c); the Region's non-response creates a rebuttable presumption of bad faith in mediation proceedings.

(d) **Federal Program Continuity.** When federal programs are block-granted to Regions:

- (1) tribal set-asides shall be maintained at pre-transition levels, adjusted for population;
- (2) Tribal Nations may elect direct federal funding where available;
- (3) Regions may not impose conditions on tribal use of federal funds beyond those in federal law.

---

### Section 12. Intergovernmental Council Representation

(a) **IGC Tribal Seat.** For any federal-Regional council, board, or commission established under this Constitution or by federal law whose policy domain directly and substantially affects tribal lands, resources, or treaty rights:

- (1) at least one voting seat shall be reserved for a representative of Tribal Nations;
- (2) the President shall appoint such representative in consultation with the National Congress of American Indians or successor organization representing federally recognized tribes; if no single representative organization is recognized, the President shall appoint from among candidates nominated by a majority of federally recognized Tribal Nations within the affected Region(s), or, for bodies of national scope, by a majority of all federally recognized Tribal Nations nationwide;
- (3) the tribal representative shall have full participation rights including voting, committee membership, and access to information.

(b) **Domain Determination.** The ARB shall certify which federal-Regional bodies "directly and substantially affect" tribal interests. This certification:

- (1) shall be issued within ninety (90) days of a request by any Tribal Nation or the body in question;
- (2) is binding absent clear error;
- (3) shall be reconsidered if the body's jurisdiction materially changes;
- (4) may be reviewed by the NCC upon petition by any Tribal Nation; review is limited to whether the ARB applied the correct legal standard and whether the certification is supported by substantial evidence.

(c) **Non-Voting Observers.** Federal-Regional bodies not certified under subsection (b) shall nonetheless permit non-voting tribal observers when:

- (1) a Tribal Nation demonstrates substantial interest in the body's proceedings;
- (2) the observation does not compromise national security or law enforcement operations.
