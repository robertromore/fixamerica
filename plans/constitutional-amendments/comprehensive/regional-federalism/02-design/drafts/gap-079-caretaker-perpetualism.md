## Pre-Existing Coverage Analysis

### Already Covered

| Gap 79 Component | Existing Location | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| Hard Termination (Day 91) | Art VII §8(c)(4) | Full — Day 91 automatic termination with committee fallback (Gap 56) |
| Committee Succession | Art VII §8(e) | Full — Temporary Executive Committee with bipartisan composition, supermajority, limited authority (Gap 56) |
| Candidate Disqualification from Caretaker | Art VII §8(a)(1)-(3) | Full — candidates, incumbents, same-party members all excluded from caretaker role |
| Frivolous Challenge Penalties | Art VII §8(f)(5) | Full — costs, attorney fees, obstruction finding, pre-approval requirement (Gap 56) |
| Regional Certification Deadline | Art VII §7(a), §7(m) | Full — 21-day deadline (stricter than Gap 79's 30 days) with auto-certification on deadline miss |
| Obstruction Finding + Sanctions | Art VII §8(f)(1)-(4) | Full — obstruction definition, heightened scrutiny, candidate disqualification, federal obstruction (Gap 56) |
| Accelerated Timeline | Art VII §8(g) | Full — 66-day maximum with automatic transfer and SC terminal step (Gap 56) |
| NEC Default Certification | Art VII §8(h)(1)-(2) | Full — NEC audit with "reliable and materially free" standard (Gap 56) |
| Court-Certified Emergency Requirement | Art VII §8(c)(2)(iv), §8(c)(3)(ii) | Partial — emergency measures require State/Regional Supreme Court certification, but no legislative concurrence |
| Terminal Fallback Cap | Art VII §8(h)(5)(ii) | Full — committee limited to next general election or 1 year max with mandatory special election (Gap 56) |

### Not Covered (Delta — This Draft)

| Gap 79 Component | Proposed Location | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Non-Extension Clause | Modified §8(c)(4)(v) | Explicit prohibition on extending termination date by any authority |
| Serial Litigation Consolidation | New §8(f)(6) | NEC consolidation of coordinated serial challenges with 7-day decision |
| Caretaker Emergency Limitations | New §8(i) | Legislative concurrence for emergencies, election-admin prohibition, investigation limitation |
| Transition Protection | New §8(j) | Apparent Winner designation, briefings, facilities, anti-impairment |
| Accountability for Caretaker Abuse | New §8(k) | Criminal accountability for refusal to vacate, void orders, subordinate redirection, non-stayable termination |

### Cross-Reference Considerations

| Provision | Relationship |
|---|---|
| Art VII §7(o) certification subversion penalties | §8(k)(1) parallels structure (removal + permanent bar + criminal) but targets refusal to vacate |
| Art VII §7(n) void alternate certifications | §8(k)(2) uses same "void ab initio" language for post-termination orders |
| Art VII §8(f)(5) frivolous challenge pre-approval | §8(f)(6) serial litigation finding extends pre-approval to all pending challenges |
| Art VII §8(e) Temporary Executive Committee | §8(i)(1) emergency concurrence requires presiding officers who also serve on committee |
| Art VII §8(g) accelerated timeline | §8(i)(2)(iii) explicitly prohibits emergency extension of §8(g) deadlines |
| Gap 56 (Zombie Executive) | Gap 56 addresses caretaker obstruction before succession; Gap 79 addresses incumbents refusing to leave |
| Gap 118 (Caretaker Cabinet) | Adjacent gap — addresses appointment freeze from Day 1; future draft |

|----|----------|---------|------|------|-----------|
| C1 | HIGH | §8(k)(3) subordinate obligations: priority hierarchy + safe harbor | MEDIUM — three direction sources with no priority rule | CRITICAL — no safe harbor for subordinates defying terminated incumbent | **Complementary** — both target §8(k)(3); add priority hierarchy (R1-1) + safe harbor (R1-2) |
| S1 | HIGH | §8(f)(6) jurisdictional trigger for consolidation | HIGH — NEC may lack authority over State/Regional court challenges; consolidation risks conflicting orders | Not addressed | **Single-reviewer** — valid; add jurisdictional transfer to NEC upon Serial Litigation finding |
| S2 | MEDIUM | §8(i) scope to include Temporary Executive Committee | MEDIUM — §8(e)(5)(ii) lets Committee act on emergencies; §8(i) prohibitions unclear post-Day-91 | Not addressed | **Single-reviewer** — correct; expand §8(i) to explicitly bind Committee throughout |
| S3 | HIGH | 48-hour emergency grace period for kinetic crises | Not addressed | HIGH — legislative concurrence could take hours/days during genuine emergency; 48-hour immediate response needed | **Single-reviewer** — valid; add immediate response exception before concurrence attaches |
| S4 | HIGH | NEC sole arbiter of Apparent Winner on conflicting canvasses | Not addressed | HIGH — competing canvasses from Executive and Legislative branches stall transition | **Single-reviewer** — valid; add NEC 24-hour designation on conflicting canvasses |
| S5 | MEDIUM | Re-litigation as per se serial litigation indicator | Not addressed | MEDIUM — "coordinated pattern" too subjective; re-filing rejected theories should be prima facie evidence | **Single-reviewer** — valid; add prima facie clause to §8(f)(6) |

**Convergence statistics:** 0 convergent, 1 complementary, 0 contradictions, 7 single-reviewer (all adopted)

### Design Question Resolutions

| Question | R1-1 | R1-2 | Resolution |
|----------|------|------|-----------|
| Q1: Emergency concurrence scope (all phases vs. Days 31-90 only) | Not addressed directly; raised Committee scope issue (S2) | 48-hour grace period resolves bottleneck (S3) | **Resolved by S2 + S3** — apply to all phases but with 48-hour immediate response exception; Committee explicitly bound |
| Q2: Transition protection timing (immediate vs. after Day 21) | Not addressed | Immediate upon designation — transition is logistics, not power | **Resolved** — immediate upon designation; no text change needed (v1 already implements this) |
| Q3: Serial litigation threshold (discretionary vs. mandatory) | Not addressed | Hybrid — leave discretionary but add re-filing as prima facie evidence (S5) | **Resolved by S5** — discretionary finding with prima facie evidentiary trigger |
| Q4: Non-stayable termination scope (any court vs. SC exception) | Not addressed | Absolute — Constitution sets the timeline; no court has equitable power to extend | **Resolved** — absolute scope retained; no text change needed |
| Q5: Apparent Winner briefing scope (full vs. reduced) | Not addressed | Full equivalence — information asymmetry is a weapon for incumbent manipulation | **Resolved** — add explicit classified briefing equivalence language to §8(j)(2)(i) |

## Round 2 Convergence Analysis

### Reviewer Summary

| ID | Severity | Finding | R2-1 | R2-2 | Resolution |
|----|----------|---------|------|------|-----------|
| D1 | HIGH | §8(k)(3)(i) priority order omits Committee — AW can sideline active Committee post-Day-91 | HIGH — subordinates follow AW instead of governing Committee; need certified winner > committee during its authority > AW for transition only | Not addressed | **Single-reviewer** — valid structural conflict; insert Committee into hierarchy, clarify AW directs transition only during Committee governance |
| D2 | MEDIUM | Emergency concurrence/court certification interaction ambiguous | MEDIUM — unclear if §8(i)(1) concurrence and §8(c)(2)(iv)/§8(c)(3)(ii) court certification are both required; 48-hour exception relationship undefined | Not addressed | **Single-reviewer** — valid; add coordination clause: concurrence is additional to court certification; 48-hour grace applies only to concurrence requirement |
| D3 | MEDIUM | §8(f)(6)(i) transfer could sweep SC cases | MEDIUM — "all pending challenges" transfer could recall matters already before Supreme Court, creating hierarchy clash | Not addressed | **Single-reviewer** — valid; add carve-out excluding matters already pending before Supreme Court |
| D4 | MEDIUM | Serial re-declaration to avoid concurrence | MEDIUM — 48-hour exception can be re-declared for same event; renewal cap doesn't bind serial re-declarations | Not addressed | **Single-reviewer** — valid gaming vector; add rule that re-declarations for same underlying event count as renewals under §8(i)(3) |

**Convergence statistics:** 0 convergent, 0 complementary, 0 contradictions, 4 single-reviewer (all adopted)

**R2-2 executive summary:** Gap 79 CLOSED. Transition SECURED. Emergency Abuse CHECKED. Bureaucratic Risk PROTECTED. All 4 D-findings are surgical refinements, not structural concerns.

## Proposed Constitutional Text (v3 FINAL)

### Modification to Existing §8(c)(4)

**ADD** new subparagraph (v) to Art VII §8(c)(4):

> - (v) This termination date may not be extended, stayed, or modified by any authority, including emergency declaration, judicial order, or executive action.

---

### Modification to Existing §8(f)

**ADD** new paragraph (6) to Art VII §8(f):

> (6) **Serial Litigation Finding.** If the National Election Court determines that election challenges by a candidate, political party, or their agents constitute a coordinated pattern designed to delay certification rather than pursue legitimate legal claims:
>
> - (i) All pending challenges in the same dispute shall be transferred to the National Election Court, including any matters pending before State or Regional courts or tribunals, but excluding matters already pending before the Supreme Court, and consolidated for decision within seven (7) days;
> - (ii) No further challenges by that party may be filed without pre-approval under paragraph (5)(iii);
> - (iii) The finding shall be a matter of public record and shall be considered in any future disputes involving the same parties;
> - (iv) A Serial Litigation finding constitutes obstruction for purposes of paragraph (2);
> - (v) The filing of claims relying on facts or legal theories substantially identical to those previously rejected by a court of competent jurisdiction in the same election dispute constitutes prima facie evidence of a coordinated pattern under this paragraph.

### New Subsections

#### Caretaker and Committee Emergency Limitations

(i) **Caretaker and Committee Emergency Limitations.**

(1) **Legislative Concurrence Required.** During caretaker governance or Temporary Executive Committee governance under this section, emergency declarations by the Caretaker Executive or Temporary Executive Committee shall require the written concurrence of the presiding officer of the State/Regional legislature. Where the legislature has two chambers, concurrence of both presiding officers is required. This requirement is in addition to, and does not replace, any court certification requirement under subsection (c). Where both court certification and legislative concurrence are required, the forty-eight (48) hour exception under subparagraph (A) applies only to the legislative concurrence requirement.

(A) **Immediate Response Exception.** The Caretaker Executive or Temporary Executive Committee may declare an emergency and exercise emergency powers for a period not to exceed forty-eight (48) hours without legislative concurrence, provided the declaration is immediately transmitted to the presiding officers of the State/Regional legislature. Continuation beyond forty-eight (48) hours requires written concurrence under this paragraph.

(2) **Prohibited Emergency Uses.** Emergency powers exercised during caretaker or Temporary Executive Committee governance may not be used to:

- (i) Affect election administration, counting, auditing, certification, or transition procedures;
- (ii) Restrict the movement, assembly, or communication of candidates, election officials, or voters in connection with the disputed election or any special election;
- (iii) Extend or modify the termination date under subsection (c)(4) or any deadline under subsection (g);
- (iv) Authorize surveillance of or interference with transition activities under subsection (j).

(3) **Emergency Duration.** Emergency declarations during caretaker or Temporary Executive Committee governance expire automatically after fourteen (14) days unless renewed with legislative concurrence under paragraph (1). No single emergency may be renewed more than twice during the caretaker or Committee governance period. A subsequent emergency declaration addressing substantially the same underlying event or circumstances as a prior declaration, regardless of whether the prior declaration has expired or been rescinded, counts as a renewal of that emergency for purposes of this paragraph.

(4) **Investigation Limitation.** Investigations ordered by the Caretaker Executive or Temporary Executive Committee regarding the disputed election:

- (i) Do not affect certification deadlines under this section or Section 7;
- (ii) May not be used as a basis for withholding, delaying, or conditioning certification;
- (iii) Continue under the successor if unresolved at the time of termination under subsection (c)(4) or expiration of Temporary Executive Committee authority under subsection (h)(5)(ii); provided that the successor may review and terminate any investigation initiated during the caretaker or Committee governance period.

#### Transition Protection

(j) **Transition Protection.**

(1) **Apparent Winner Designation.** The candidate leading in the most recent official canvass or, if no canvass has been completed, the candidate identified by the National Election Court as the likely winner based on available returns, shall be designated the "Apparent Winner" for purposes of transition preparation. If conflicting canvasses are issued or the identity of the leading candidate is disputed, the National Election Court shall designate the Apparent Winner within twenty-four (24) hours. This designation does not prejudice the outcome of any pending certification dispute.

(2) **Transition Entitlements.** Upon designation, the Apparent Winner shall be entitled to:

- (i) Security briefings, including classified briefings at the same classification level, and protective detail equivalent to those provided to the Caretaker Executive;
- (ii) Access to government transition facilities and office space;
- (iii) Transition funding at the rate established by law for incoming executives;
- (iv) Briefings from department and agency heads on ongoing operations and pending matters.

(3) **Anti-Impairment.** The Caretaker Executive and Temporary Executive Committee may not:

- (i) Impede, delay, or condition transition activities;
- (ii) Withhold information relevant to the Apparent Winner's preparation for office;
- (iii) Reassign, terminate, or discipline government employees for cooperating with transition activities;
- (iv) Destroy, alter, or remove records that would be transferred to the successor upon taking office.

(4) **Change of Apparent Winner.** If the identity of the Apparent Winner changes due to a recount, court order, or National Election Court determination, transition entitlements shall transfer to the newly designated Apparent Winner within twenty-four (24) hours. Upon transfer, the prior Apparent Winner's access to security briefings, classified materials, and government facilities under paragraph (2) shall terminate immediately. All classified materials in the prior Apparent Winner's possession shall be returned within twenty-four (24) hours.

#### Accountability for Caretaker Abuse

(k) **Accountability for Caretaker Abuse.**

(1) **Refusal to Vacate.** A Caretaker Executive or member of the Temporary Executive Committee who refuses to vacate office or relinquish authority upon the termination or expiration of their authority under this section:

- (i) Is guilty of a high crime against the constitutional order;
- (ii) Shall be subject to immediate removal by the State/Regional Supreme Court upon petition by the Apparent Winner, the State/Regional legislature, or the National Election Court;
- (iii) Shall be permanently barred from holding any office of profit or trust under the United States or any State or Region thereof;
- (iv) Shall be subject to such criminal penalties as Congress shall provide by law, which shall include penalties classified as felonies.

(2) **Void Orders.** Any order, directive, appointment, or official act issued by a Caretaker Executive or Temporary Executive Committee member after the termination or expiration of their authority under this section is void ab initio and of no legal force or effect.

(3) **Subordinate Official Obligations.** Upon termination of Caretaker authority under subsection (c)(4), and thereafter:

- (i) All subordinate officials shall take direction from the certified winner; if no winner has been certified, from the Temporary Executive Committee if it retains authority under subsection (e); if Committee authority has also expired, from the Apparent Winner pending certification; and if none is available, from the successor entity established under this section. During any period of Temporary Executive Committee governance, transition activities under subsection (j) shall be directed by the Apparent Winner;
- (ii) Security services shall protect the successor and facilitate the transition of authority;
- (iii) A subordinate official who knowingly continues to take direction from a person whose authority has terminated under this section is subject to removal and such penalties as Congress shall provide by law;
- (iv) **Safe Harbor.** No civil or criminal penalty, administrative discipline, or employment retaliation may be imposed on any subordinate official for refusing a direction from a Caretaker Executive or Temporary Executive Committee member whose authority has terminated under this section, or for taking direction from the successor designated under paragraph (i).

(4) **Non-Stayable Termination.** The termination of authority under subsection (c)(4) and the expiration of Temporary Executive Committee authority under subsection (h)(5)(ii):

- (i) Are self-executing and require no judicial order or certification;
- (ii) May not be stayed, enjoined, or suspended by any court pending judicial review;
- (iii) Any challenge to the termination shall be decided by the National Election Court within seventy-two (72) hours;
- (iv) The successor assumes authority immediately upon termination, regardless of any pending challenge.

## Key Design Decisions (Cumulative v1 + v2 + v3)

1. **Day 91 retained as primary termination trigger.** Gap 79 proposes 60 days from "scheduled inauguration date." The existing Day 91 from Gap 56 (measured from election day) is approximately 91 days post-election. For a typical November election with January inauguration (~75 days), Day 91 is roughly 16 days post-inauguration — significantly tighter than Gap 79's 60-day-from-inauguration proposal (~135 days post-election). Gap 79's contribution is the "no extension" clause, not its timeline. Non-stayable termination scope confirmed absolute (v2, Q4 resolved) — no Supreme Court exception; the Constitution sets the timeline.

2. **Legislative presiding officer concurrence for emergencies.** Gap 79 proposes "the relevant legislature's presiding officer." The draft specifies both presiding officers for bicameral legislatures, consistent with §8(e)(2) committee composition. This prevents a single presiding officer from unilaterally authorizing emergency power during a caretaker period.

3. **14-day emergency expiration with 2 renewals.** Not in Gap 79 proposal but necessary to prevent indefinite emergency. Without a limit, legislative concurrence could be granted once for an open-ended emergency. Maximum emergency duration during caretaker period: 42 days (14 days x 3), which aligns with the reduced authority phase (Days 31-60) and minimal authority phase (Days 61-90).

4. **"Apparent Winner" designation by operation of law.** Defined as the candidate leading in the official canvass or, failing that, the NEC-identified likely winner. This avoids requiring a discretionary designation that could be contested or withheld. The designation "does not prejudice the outcome" — it is purely for transition logistics. Transition entitlements begin immediately upon designation (v2, Q2 resolved) — transition is logistics, not power; earlier start means safer handover.

5. **Serial Litigation finding linked to obstruction.** Gap 79 treats serial litigation as a standalone mechanism. The draft integrates it into the existing §8(f) obstruction framework, making a Serial Litigation finding automatically constitute obstruction under paragraph (2). This triggers all existing obstruction consequences: cost shifting, heightened scrutiny, candidate disqualification, and federal obstruction remedies.

6. **Non-stayable termination.** Gap 79 proposes the termination date "is not stayed pending judicial review." The draft implements this comprehensively: self-executing termination, no court may stay or enjoin, 72-hour NEC review as rapid but post-facto challenge mechanism, and successor assumes authority immediately. This closes the "interim stay" gaming vector where a friendly court issues a stay to extend authority.

7. **Void ab initio for post-termination orders.** Explicit "void ab initio" language mirrors §7(n)'s treatment of alternate certifications. Provides absolute legal certainty that no post-termination act has legal effect, eliminating the "fait accompli" gaming vector where a departing caretaker issues last-minute orders hoping they become irreversible.

8. **Criminal accountability parallels §7(o) structure.** Gap 79 proposes "high crime subject to immediate removal and prosecution." The draft parallels §7(o)'s penalty structure (immediate removal + permanent bar + felony) for consistency, but adds immediate removal by State/Regional Supreme Court upon petition. Standing to petition is broad: Apparent Winner, legislature, or NEC.

9. **Subordinate redirection with penalty.** Gap 79 proposes subordinates "shall take direction from the successor." The draft adds a penalty for subordinates who knowingly continue to comply with a terminated authority — necessary to deter the "parallel government" scenario where bureaucrats remain loyal to the former caretaker.

10. **Investigation limitation applies to both Caretaker and Committee.** Gap 79's proposal addresses only caretaker-ordered investigations. The draft extends the limitation to Temporary Executive Committee investigations, closing the gaming vector where the committee (which may include legislative allies) uses investigation authority to block certification.

11. **Transition entitlements transfer within 24 hours on change of Apparent Winner.** If a recount or court order changes who is leading, transition access shifts rapidly. This prevents the gaming scenario where the initial canvass leader uses transition access to entrench while the true winner emerges later.

12. **Jurisdictional transfer for serial litigation consolidation** (v2, S1). V1 ordered consolidation of "all pending challenges" without a jurisdictional trigger. If challenges were still in State/Regional courts, NEC might lack authority to consolidate, risking conflicting orders and due-process defects. V2 adds explicit transfer to NEC, including matters pending before State or Regional courts, upon a Serial Litigation finding. This ensures NEC has jurisdiction over everything it consolidates.

13. **Emergency limitations explicitly bind Temporary Executive Committee** (v2, S2, resolves Q1). V1 §8(i)(1) concurrence applied only to the "Caretaker Executive," but §8(e)(5)(ii) lets the Committee act on court-certified emergencies. V2 expands §8(i) scope throughout: title, concurrence requirement, prohibited uses, duration limits, and investigation limitation all apply to Committee governance. This closes the post-Day-91 workaround where the Committee could exercise emergency powers without legislative oversight.

14. **48-hour immediate response exception** (v2, S3, resolves Q1). V1 required legislative concurrence for all emergency declarations, creating a bottleneck during kinetic crises (cyberattack, natural disaster). V2 adds §8(i)(1)(A): Caretaker or Committee may act for up to 48 hours without concurrence, provided the declaration is immediately transmitted to presiding officers. Continuation beyond 48 hours requires written concurrence. This balances genuine crisis response with anti-abuse oversight.

15. **NEC sole arbiter of Apparent Winner on conflicting canvasses** (v2, S4). V1 relied on "official canvass" without addressing competing canvasses. If Executive and Legislative branches issue conflicting canvasses (a known coup tactic), the transition stalls. V2 adds NEC 24-hour designation authority when canvasses conflict or the leading candidate is disputed. Full classified briefing equivalence also confirmed (v2, Q5 resolved) — information asymmetry is a weapon for incumbent manipulation; "same classification level" language added to §8(j)(2)(i).

16. **Re-litigation as prima facie serial litigation indicator** (v2, S5, resolves Q3). V1's "coordinated pattern" standard was purely discretionary and potentially subjective. V2 adds §8(f)(6)(v): filing claims on facts or theories substantially identical to those previously rejected constitutes prima facie evidence of a coordinated pattern. This provides an objective evidentiary trigger while preserving NEC discretion for the ultimate finding.

17. **Successor authority to terminate caretaker-period investigations** (v2, S6). V1 provided that investigations "continue under the successor" but gave the successor no authority to terminate them. A malicious caretaker could launch a "poison pill" investigation against the successor just before leaving. V2 adds successor review and termination authority for any investigation initiated during the caretaker or Committee governance period.

18. **Access revocation and material return on Apparent Winner change** (v2, S7). V1 provided for 24-hour transfer of transition entitlements but did not address revocation of prior access. V2 adds explicit provisions: prior Apparent Winner's access terminates immediately upon transfer, and all classified materials must be returned within 24 hours. This prevents the lingering access gaming vector.

19. **Subordinate direction priority hierarchy with safe harbor** (v2, C1). V1 listed three potential direction sources (certified winner, Apparent Winner, successor entity) without priority, creating potential for conflicting instructions. V2 establishes explicit priority and adds a safe harbor (§8(k)(3)(iv)) protecting subordinates from retaliation for refusing directions from a terminated authority and following the constitutional successor — closing the "dual loyalty trap" where civil servants fear retaliation from the lingering incumbent.

20. **Subordinate priority includes Committee during active governance** (v3, D1). V2's priority hierarchy (certified winner > Apparent Winner > successor entity) omitted the Temporary Executive Committee, creating a conflict where subordinates might follow the Apparent Winner instead of the Committee during the Committee's active governance period (post-Day 91). V3 inserts the Committee: certified winner > Committee (during active governance) > Apparent Winner (after Committee terminates) > successor entity. During Committee governance, the Apparent Winner directs transition activities under §8(j) only, not governance functions. Trigger also refined from "Upon termination of Caretaker or Temporary Executive Committee authority" to "Upon termination of Caretaker authority under subsection (c)(4), and thereafter" to make the standing obligation clear.

21. **Emergency coordination clause with court certification** (v3, D2). V2 added legislative concurrence and 48-hour grace but didn't clarify interaction with existing court certification requirements in §8(c)(2)(iv) and §8(c)(3)(ii). V3 adds explicit coordination: legislative concurrence is additional to (not replacing) court certification; the 48-hour grace applies only to the concurrence requirement. During Days 31-90 and Committee governance, both court certification and legislative concurrence are required for emergency continuation. During Days 1-30 (full authority), only legislative concurrence (after 48 hours) applies.

22. **Supreme Court carve-out for serial litigation transfer** (v3, D3). V2's jurisdictional transfer swept "all pending challenges" to NEC, potentially including matters already before the Supreme Court. V3 excludes matters already pending before the Supreme Court from mandatory transfer. This preserves the judicial hierarchy: NEC can consolidate State/Regional court matters, but cannot recall cases from the Supreme Court.

23. **Serial re-declaration treated as renewal** (v3, D4). V2's 48-hour grace period could be exploited through serial re-declarations of "new" emergencies for the same underlying event. V3 provides that subsequent declarations addressing substantially the same event count as renewals under §8(i)(3), requiring legislative concurrence from inception. Combined with the two-renewal cap, this prevents indefinite serial declaration.
