# Gap 118 Resolution: Article VII, Section 8 Expansion

## Status: FINAL (v3)

**Resolves:** Gap 118 (Caretaker Cabinet — Constitutional Shadow-Government)

**Severity:** Medium

**Date:** 2026-02-03

**Revision:** v3 FINAL — incorporates Round 2 fixes (2 reviewers, 3 findings on v2)

**Target:** Article VII (Elections and Democratic Legitimacy), Section 8 (Caretaker Governance) — modification of existing subsection (c)(1) + new subsection (l), appended after existing (k)

**Placement Rationale:** Gap 118 proposes an appointment and removal freeze during Caretaker and Temporary Executive Committee governance to prevent institutional capture via "midnight appointments" or loyalty-driven removals. The existing Section 8 already provides declining authority (§8(c)) with a prohibition on permanent appointments starting at Day 31, but Days 1-30 grant "full executive authority" without appointment restrictions. Gap 118 closes this 30-day window and adds removal protections, acting official protocols, void provisions, and anti-circumvention measures not present in the current text. This completes the caretaker cluster (Gaps 56, 79, 118).

## Pre-Existing Coverage Analysis

| # | Proposal Component | Existing Coverage | Delta? |
|---|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| 1 | (g)(i) Appointment power suspended | §8(c)(2)(i) prohibits permanent appointments Days 31-60; §8(c)(3) limits to essential services Days 61-90 | **YES** — Days 1-30 gap: "full executive authority" includes appointments |
| 2 | (g)(ii) Removal power suspended | Not addressed anywhere in §8 | **YES** — no removal restriction at any phase |
| 3 | (g)(iii) Scope: oversight bodies, judiciary, senior agency | §8(c)(2)(i) "any position" — broader scope but only Days 31+ | **PARTIAL** — timeframe gap |
| 4 | (h)(i) Acting officials via succession/seniority | Not addressed | **YES** — no vacancy management protocol |
| 5 | (h)(ii) Acting officials: full authority, no permanent policy | Not addressed | **YES** — no acting authority scope |
| 6 | (h)(iii) Acting appointments terminate on certification | Not addressed | **YES** — no termination trigger |
| 7 | (i)(i-iii) Freeze scope enumeration | §8(c)(2)(i) — Days 31+ only | **PARTIAL** — timeframe gap |
| 8 | (j)(i-iii) Void appointments during period | §8(k)(2) voids post-termination acts only | **YES** — no during-period void provision |
| 9 | (k)(i-iii) Post-certification authority | §8(k)(3) subordinate obligations; §8(j) transition protection | **MOSTLY COVERED** — merge with acting termination |
| 10 | (l)(i-iii) Transition cooperation | §8(j)(3) anti-impairment; §8(k)(1) refusal to vacate | **FULLY COVERED** — not duplicated |

**Pre-existing coverage:** 7 of 10 components have some coverage (3 partial, 1 mostly, 1 fully covered, 2 broad but time-limited)

**True delta:** 6 components need new constitutional text: Day 1 appointment freeze, removal power suspension, delegation prohibition, acting official protocol, during-period void provision, inducement prohibition

## Cross-References to Existing Section 8

| Provision | Relevance to Gap 118 |
|-----------|---------------------|
| §8(a) Disqualified Caretaker Rule | Excludes candidates, incumbents, party members — reduces but does not eliminate capture risk |
| §8(c)(1) Days 1-30 "full executive authority" | **Primary gap** — includes unrestricted appointment power |
| §8(c)(2)(i) Days 31-60 "no permanent appointments" | Partial coverage — but only permanent, not acting/interim; and only Days 31+ |
| §8(c)(3) Days 61-90 minimal authority | Implicitly excludes appointments but not explicit |
| §8(e)(5) Committee limited authority | "May only" maintain essential services — arguably excludes appointments but not explicit |
| §8(e)(6)(iii) Committee cannot appoint election officials | Narrow scope — covers only election-authority appointments |
| §8(k)(2) Void ab initio for post-termination acts | Covers post-termination only; Gap 118 needs during-period void provision |
| §8(k)(3) Subordinate obligations | Priority hierarchy addresses post-termination loyalty; does not address during-period appointment capture |

## Round 1 Convergence Analysis

### Reviewer Summary

| ID | Category | R1-1 | R1-2 | Resolution |
|----|----------|------|------|-----------|
| C1 | **Convergent** | MEDIUM — 30-day ratification window has no default rule | F3 MEDIUM — ratification ambiguity, silence could imply ratification | Both identify same gap; adopt R1-2's "deemed rescinded" — void acts remain void unless affirmatively ratified by written instrument |
| C2 | **Complementary** | HIGH — NEC/judicial vacancy unfillable under freeze + party bar | F5 MEDIUM — emergency vacancy scope "critical government services" too broad | Both target §8(l)(3) from opposite angles; narrow general scope per R1-2 + add adjudicatory body carve-out per R1-1 |
| S1 | **Single-reviewer** | — | F1 CRITICAL — proxy appointment via subordinate officials' statutory hiring power | Adopt — clear loophole; add system-wide suspension language to §8(l)(1)(i) |
| S2 | **Single-reviewer** | — | F2 HIGH — shadow staff / kitchen cabinet with de facto authority | Adopt — functional ban: prohibit delegating authority or granting records access to non-officeholders; new §8(l)(1)(iv) |
| S3 | **Single-reviewer** | MEDIUM — no removal for misconduct discovered during caretaker period | — | Adopt — add court-certified emergency removal exception to §8(l)(1)(ii) |
| S4 | **Single-reviewer** | — | F4 MEDIUM — hostile legislature could refuse to appropriate back pay | Adopt — sovereign obligation payable from treasury without further appropriation |
| S5 | **Single-reviewer** | LOW — "permanent policy changes" undefined | — | Adopt — replace with temporal scope: "directives, regulations, or policies with binding effect beyond the Caretaker or Committee governance period" |

**Convergence statistics:** 1 convergent (C1), 1 complementary (C2), 0 contradictions, 5 single-reviewer (S1-S5; all adopted)

### Design Question Resolutions

| # | Question | R1-1 | R1-2 | Resolution |
|---|----------|------|------|-----------|
| 1 | Subordinate appointments by existing officials? | Not addressed | Q1: Freeze all — systemic, not personal to the Caretaker | **Freeze all** — per F1/S1, all appointment authority suspended system-wide regardless of source |
| 2 | Informal advisory appointments? | Not addressed | Q2: Functional ban — ban authority delegation/access, not talking | **Functional ban** — new §8(l)(1)(iv) shadow staff prohibition; Caretaker can consult anyone but cannot delegate authority or grant records access |
| 3 | 30-day ratification default? | Suggests both options | Q3: Deemed rescinded — void acts remain void | **Deemed rescinded** — silence = rescission; affirmative ratification by written instrument required (convergent C1) |
| 4 | Pre-dispute appointment rush? | Not addressed | Q4: Address in Art V §4-A, not here | **Not addressed here** — correct scoping; Art V §4-A (Regional Executive Transition Integrity) covers pre-transition period |

## Proposed Constitutional Text (v3 FINAL)

### Modification to §8(c)(1)

**Current text:**

> (1) **Initial Period (Days 1-30).** The Caretaker Executive shall exercise full executive authority necessary for continuity of government operations.

**Modified text:**

> (1) **Initial Period (Days 1-30).** The Caretaker Executive shall exercise full executive authority necessary for continuity of government operations, except that the appointment and removal restrictions of subsection (l) apply from the commencement of Caretaker Governance.

### New Subsection: Appointment and Removal Freeze

> #### Appointment and Removal Freeze
>
> (l) **Appointment and Removal Freeze.**
>
> (1) **General Rule.** From the commencement of Caretaker Governance under this section and continuing through the conclusion of Temporary Executive Committee governance, if any:
>
> - (i) No permanent, acting, interim, or temporary appointment may be made to any position in the State/Regional executive branch, judiciary, or Constitutional Oversight Bodies, including but not limited to the Allocation Review Board, the Independent Fiscal Council, and the National Election Court, regardless of whether the appointment authority is vested in the Caretaker Executive, a department head, a board, a commission, or any other executive branch official;
> - (ii) No officer or employee holding any such position may be removed, suspended without pay, demoted, involuntarily reassigned, or involuntarily transferred, except through pre-existing disciplinary proceedings for cause that were initiated before the commencement of Caretaker Governance, or through an emergency removal petition to the State/Regional Supreme Court for misconduct discovered during Caretaker or Committee governance that poses an immediate threat to public safety, the integrity of the disputed election, or the security of government operations;
> - (iii) No appointment or removal authority may be delegated by the Caretaker Executive or Temporary Executive Committee to any person;
> - (iv) The Caretaker Executive and Temporary Executive Committee may not delegate executive authority, decision-making power, or grant access to non-public government records to any person not holding a lawfully appointed office or position of employment within the State/Regional government prior to the commencement of Caretaker Governance. This paragraph does not restrict access to non-public government records by the Apparent Winner or the Apparent Winner's authorized transition personnel exercising entitlements under subsection (j), by acting officials serving under paragraph (2), or by temporary appointees or designees authorized under paragraph (3).
>
> (2) **Vacancy Management.** Vacancies arising in positions covered by paragraph (1) during Caretaker or Committee governance:
>
> - (i) Shall be filled by the official next in the statutory or regulatory line of succession for that position;
> - (ii) Where no statutory succession exists, by the most senior career official in the same office or agency, determined by length of continuous service in that office or agency;
> - (iii) Acting officials serving under this paragraph have full operational authority to perform the duties of the vacant position, but may not issue directives, regulations, or policies with binding effect beyond the Caretaker or Committee governance period, and may not make subordinate appointments;
> - (iv) Acting service under this paragraph terminates upon the certified winner taking office or, if no winner is certified, upon the conclusion of Temporary Executive Committee governance.
>
> (3) **Emergency Vacancy.** If a vacancy in a position essential to the immediate protection of life, property, public order, or the conduct of the disputed election cannot be filled through the succession procedures of paragraph (2):
>
> - (i) The State/Regional Supreme Court may authorize a temporary appointment upon petition by the Caretaker Executive, the Temporary Executive Committee, or the presiding officer of the State/Regional legislature;
> - (ii) The appointee must meet all statutory qualifications for the position and may not be affiliated with any political party having a candidate in the disputed election;
> - (iii) The authorization shall specify the scope and duration of the temporary appointment, which shall not extend beyond the Caretaker or Committee governance period;
> - (iv) Any party to the disputed election may petition the National Election Court for review of the emergency appointment within seven (7) days;
> - (v) If the vacancy is on the National Election Court or a State/Regional court exercising jurisdiction under this section, and the vacancy impairs the body's ability to maintain a quorum or exercise jurisdiction under Sections 7 or 8, the Chief Justice of the court in which the vacancy occurs, or the Chief Justice of the next higher court if the vacancy is in the Chief Justice's own position, shall designate a temporary replacement from among active or senior-status judges of equivalent or higher courts who do not meet the criteria of subsection (a)(1), (a)(3), or (a)(5). Such designation is a judicial administrative act, does not constitute an appointment under paragraph (1), and terminates upon the conclusion of Caretaker and Committee governance;
> - (vi) If a Constitutional Oversight Body exercising functions relevant to the disputed election or to the enforcement of rights under this section or Section 7 loses a quorum during Caretaker or Committee governance, the presiding officer of that body may designate a temporary member from among former members of the same body who have completed their terms, subject to approval by the State/Regional Supreme Court. The designee must meet the statutory qualifications for membership and may not meet the criteria of subsection (a)(1), (a)(3), or (a)(5). Such designation does not constitute an appointment under paragraph (1) and terminates upon the conclusion of Caretaker and Committee governance.
>
> (4) **Void Acts.** Any appointment, removal, suspension, demotion, reassignment, or transfer in violation of this subsection:
>
> - (i) Is void ab initio and of no legal force or effect;
> - (ii) Any person appointed in violation of this subsection has no lawful authority, and any official act taken by that person is void unless affirmatively ratified by the certified winner by written instrument within thirty (30) days of taking office; failure to ratify within thirty (30) days constitutes rescission, and the act remains void ab initio;
> - (iii) Any officer or employee removed, suspended, demoted, reassigned, or transferred in violation of this subsection is deemed to have continued in their position without interruption, and shall be entitled to back pay and restoration of all benefits for the period of the violation; such payments constitute a sovereign obligation of the State or Region and shall be paid from the general treasury without requirement for further legislative appropriation;
> - (iv) A knowing violation of this subsection constitutes obstruction under subsection (f)(1).
>
> (5) **Pending Nominations.** Nominations for permanent positions submitted to the State/Regional legislature or any confirmation body before the commencement of Caretaker Governance:
>
> - (i) Are suspended for the duration of Caretaker and Committee governance;
> - (ii) The confirmation body may not hold hearings on, vote on, or act upon suspended nominations during the Caretaker or Committee governance period;
> - (iii) The certified winner may withdraw, resubmit, or allow suspended nominations to proceed upon taking office.
>
> (6) **Inducement Prohibition.** The Caretaker Executive, members of the Temporary Executive Committee, and their agents may not:
>
> - (i) Induce, incentivize, or pressure any officer or employee to resign, retire, or vacate a position, whether through promises of future appointment, financial incentive, threat of adverse action, or other means;
> - (ii) Create new positions, restructure existing positions, or reclassify positions for the purpose of circumventing the restrictions of this subsection;
> - (iii) A finding by the National Election Court that the Caretaker, Committee, or their agents violated this paragraph constitutes obstruction under subsection (f)(1).

## Design Decisions

1. **Complete freeze from Day 1** — Unlike the declining authority timeline which phases restrictions (Days 1-30 full, 31-60 reduced, 61-90 minimal), the appointment/removal freeze applies immediately upon Caretaker Governance commencement. Rationale: The Disqualified Caretaker Rule (§8(a)) ensures the Caretaker is not a candidate or party member, but institutional capture risk exists even from neutral actors under pressure. A 30-day window for unrestricted appointments is exploitable.

2. **All appointment types frozen** — The freeze covers permanent, acting, interim, and temporary appointments. The existing §8(c)(2)(i) only restricts "permanent appointments." A Caretaker could circumvent by making "acting" or "interim" appointments that function as permanent placements. The comprehensive freeze closes this gap.

3. **Removal power explicitly included** — The original proposal correctly identifies removal as a gaming vector. A Caretaker who cannot appoint but can remove could fire existing officials, creating vacancies filled by compliant succession officials. The removal freeze prevents this purge strategy.

4. **Pre-existing cause exception** — Disciplinary proceedings initiated before Caretaker Governance may continue. This prevents a Caretaker from being unable to remove an official who committed serious misconduct but also prevents manufacturing disciplinary proceedings during the caretaker period as a removal pretext.

5. **Delegation prohibition** — Prevents the Caretaker from delegating appointment authority to a subordinate before the freeze takes effect, or from arguing that a subordinate's appointment power is independent of the Caretaker's frozen authority.

6. **Emergency vacancy via Supreme Court** — Addresses the genuine operational concern: what if a critical position (e.g., emergency management director) becomes vacant during a natural disaster? The State/Regional Supreme Court (not the Caretaker) authorizes the temporary appointment, with party affiliation restrictions and NEC review. This prevents manufactured emergencies from becoming appointment opportunities.

7. **Void ab initio with obstruction linkage** — Violations are void and constitute obstruction under §8(f)(1), triggering the full anti-obstruction framework including cost-shifting, heightened scrutiny, potential candidate disqualification (§8(f)(3)), and serial litigation findings (§8(f)(6)). This creates a deterrence chain beyond the void provision alone.

8. **Pending nomination suspension** — Prevents a confirmation body from rushing through nominations submitted by a pre-caretaker executive. Even if the nominations were submitted in good faith, acting on them during a certification dispute creates institutional capture risk. The certified winner may allow them to proceed if appropriate.

9. **Inducement prohibition** — Closes the "voluntary resignation" gaming vector where a Caretaker pressures officials to resign so succession officials (potentially more compliant or aligned) take over. Also prevents position restructuring as a circumvention mechanism.

10. **Committee coverage** — The freeze explicitly applies to "Temporary Executive Committee governance" in §8(l)(1), closing the interpretive gap where §8(e)(5) "may only" maintain essential services might be argued to permit appointments necessary for service maintenance.

11. **30-day ratification window** — The certified winner has 30 days to ratify or rescind acts taken by void appointees (§8(l)(4)(ii)). This addresses continuity: if a void appointee made decisions during the caretaker period, some may need to be preserved for operational continuity. The winner's ratification power prevents automatic disruption.

12. **System-wide appointment freeze** (v2, S1) — The freeze explicitly applies "regardless of whether the appointment authority is vested in the Caretaker Executive, a department head, a board, a commission, or any other executive branch official." This closes the proxy appointment loophole where a Caretaker pressures subordinate officials with statutory hiring power to fill positions on the Caretaker's behalf. The freeze is systemic — it attaches to the institution during a legitimacy crisis, not personally to the Caretaker.

13. **Shadow staff prohibition** (v2, S2) — §8(l)(1)(iv) prohibits delegating executive authority, decision-making power, or granting access to non-public government records to any person not holding a lawful position prior to Caretaker Governance. This is a functional ban: the Caretaker can consult anyone privately, but cannot give non-officeholders the tools of governance (authority, decision-making power, or records access). Prevents the "kitchen cabinet" vector.

14. **During-period misconduct exception** (v2, S3) — §8(l)(1)(ii) permits emergency removal for misconduct discovered during Caretaker Governance via State/Regional Supreme Court petition, limited to immediate threats to public safety, election integrity, or government security. Balances the removal freeze against genuine safety concerns while keeping the exception narrow and judicially supervised.

15. **Narrowed emergency vacancy scope** (v2, C2) — Changed from "essential to public safety or continuity of critical government services" to "essential to the immediate protection of life, property, public order, or the conduct of the disputed election." Prevents misuse of the emergency vacancy mechanism for political policy roles.

16. **Adjudicatory body vacancy carve-out** (v2, C2) — §8(l)(3)(v) allows chief justices to designate temporary judicial replacements when NEC or court vacancies threaten quorum or jurisdiction under §§7-8. The designation is explicitly characterized as a "judicial administrative act" — not an executive appointment — and is therefore not blocked by the freeze.

17. **Default rescission rule** (v2, C1) — Void appointees' acts are void unless affirmatively ratified by the certified winner by written instrument within 30 days. Silence constitutes rescission and the act remains void ab initio. Acts that were legally void should not become valid through inaction.

18. **Sovereign obligation for back pay** (v2, S4) — Back pay for wrongfully removed officials is a sovereign obligation payable from the general treasury without further legislative appropriation. Prevents a hostile legislature from weaponizing the appropriations process to nullify the removal freeze's remedy.

19. **Temporal scope for acting authority** (v2, S5) — Replaced vague "permanent policy changes" with "directives, regulations, or policies with binding effect beyond the Caretaker or Committee governance period." Ties the prohibition to a clear temporal boundary rather than a subjective permanence judgment.

20. **Shadow staff transition/acting/emergency carve-outs** (v3, D1) — Added explicit exemptions to §8(l)(1)(iv) for Apparent Winner transition access under §8(j), acting officials under §8(l)(2), and emergency appointees/designees under §8(l)(3). Without this, the shadow staff prohibition would inadvertently block the Apparent Winner's classified briefings and prevent emergency appointees from accessing records needed to perform their authorized duties. The carve-outs are limited to persons with lawful authorization under other provisions of §8.

21. **Narrowed disqualification reference for judicial designees** (v3, D2) — Changed §8(l)(3)(v) from "not subject to disqualification under subsection (a)" to "who do not meet the criteria of subsection (a)(1), (a)(3), or (a)(5)" — i.e., only candidate, party affiliation, and financial/familial relationship disqualifications. The full §8(a) was designed for Caretaker Executive eligibility: (a)(4) disqualifies federal executive appointees, which includes all federal judges; (a)(6) disqualifies judges appointed by the incumbent within 4 years, which could severely reduce the pool. For temporary judicial designees, political neutrality (no candidate/party/financial ties) is the essential requirement, not the broader Caretaker eligibility criteria.

22. **Oversight body quorum preservation** (v3, D3) — New §8(l)(3)(vi) allows the presiding officer of a Constitutional Oversight Body to designate a temporary member from among former members who have completed their terms, subject to State/Regional Supreme Court approval. Addresses the scenario where ARB or IFC loses quorum during a caretaker period, potentially stalling enforcement functions under §§7-8. The former-member requirement ensures institutional knowledge while the court approval maintains neutrality. Uses the same narrowed disqualification criteria as judicial designees — (a)(1), (a)(3), (a)(5).
