# Gap 111 — The "Shadow Stay" via Regional Administrative Law

## Status: DRAFT v3 FINAL

## Original Gap

A Region seeking to block a Federal "Rights Floor" (national minimum wage, voting access) could pass Regional law that is 99% compliant but contains one "procedural" conflict with Federal law. The Regional court could issue an "administrative stay" on the Federal standard within that Region while it "clarifies" Regional law. This allows the Region to ignore Federal law for months or years through "Shadow Stays" that never officially challenge the Federal government.

## Pre-Existing Coverage Analysis

| Provision | What It Covers | What It Misses |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Art XIV-RF, §3(a)-(d) — Mandatory Federal Certification | Regional court rulings interpreting Federal Floors don't take effect until SCOTUS review; status quo preserved during certification | Covers *rulings*, not administrative stays or agency-level interpretive guidance |
| Art XIV-RF, §3(e) — Trial Court Injection Prevention | Any judicial order staying/enjoining/suspending Federal Floor enforcement must be transmitted to NCC within 48 hours; NCC reviews within 15 days | Covers *judicial orders* from *Regional courts*; silent on Regional *agencies* issuing administrative holds, guidance, or interpretive rulings with equivalent effect |
| Art XIV-RF, §3(f)-(h) — Anti-Reliance Rule | No vested rights, reliance claims, or equitable defenses during contested interpretation periods | Does not address non-enforcement itself — only prevents reliance-based defenses after the fact |
| Art XIV-RF, §4 — Provisional Relief and Remedy Preservation | Expedited review, anti-delay sanctions, status quo preservation orders | Addresses delay in *litigation*; does not address *pre-litigation* administrative obstruction or legislative pattern-making |
| Art XIV-RF, §5 — Standing to Enforce the Constitution | Broad citizen standing to challenge constitutional violations in federal court | Provides standing but no specific damages mechanism for losses caused by sustained Federal Floor non-enforcement |

**Gap:** Existing provisions address individual judicial stays through NCC review but leave three attack vectors open: (1) Regional *agencies* — not courts — can issue administrative interpretive rulings, guidance documents, or implementation holds that achieve the same non-enforcement result without triggering Section 3(e)'s judicial order transmission requirement; (2) a Region can enact *sequential legislation* creating new procedural conflicts after each stay is vacated, maintaining continuous non-enforcement through a *pattern* the NCC reviews only individually; (3) no mechanism exists for systemic detection of sustained obstruction or for prohibiting a Region from obtaining further stays after a pattern finding.

## Target Location

**Article XIV-RF, Section 6** — Shadow Stay Prevention (09-judiciary.md)

New section after existing Section 5 (Standing to Enforce the Constitution), before the Article III-RF heading.

**Rationale:** The vulnerability arises from the intersection of Regional court/agency authority and Federal Floor enforcement. The existing Section 3 addresses judicial interpretations; Section 4 addresses remedy timing; Section 5 addresses standing. A new Section 6 addressing *systematic administrative obstruction patterns* logically extends the enforcement architecture. The proposal's original target of "Section 10" is renumbered because Art XIV-RF currently uses Sections 1-5.

## Proposed Constitutional Text

### Article XIV-RF, Section 6 (new section)

#### Shadow Stay Prevention

*Resolves Gap 111 — The "Shadow Stay" via Regional Administrative Law. Closes loopholes in Section 3's judicial stay protections by extending coverage to administrative-level obstruction, detecting rolling stay patterns, and providing systemic enforcement with citizen remedies.*

(a) **Administrative Suspension Prohibition.** No Regional agency, administrative body, or executive officer may issue any administrative stay, interpretive guidance, implementation hold, enforcement moratorium, or other directive that has the effect of suspending, delaying, or materially narrowing the enforcement of a Federal Floor or Federal Framework within the Region. For purposes of this section:

- (1) "materially narrowing" means interpreting a Federal Floor to apply to fewer persons, circumstances, or geographic areas than its terms require;
- (2) an administrative action has the "effect of suspending" if Federal Floor enforcement within the Region falls below ninety percent (90%) of the higher of (i) the pre-action Regional enforcement rate, or (ii) the national average enforcement rate for the same Federal Floor as published by the relevant federal enforcement agency. The relevant federal enforcement agency shall publish annual enforcement data for each Federal Floor, including the methodology for calculating enforcement rates. If no enforcement data has been published within twelve (12) months following the Federal Floor's effective date, the national average enforcement rate shall be deemed to be one hundred percent (100%) for purposes of this subsection. For Federal Floors in effect for less than one (1) year, the relevant federal enforcement agency shall establish a provisional enforcement baseline within ninety (90) days of the Floor's effective date; if no provisional baseline is established, the baseline shall be one hundred percent (100%); [v2: dual baseline — prevents zero-baseline gaming] [v3: publication mandate with 100% fallback + provisional baseline for new Floors]
- (3) this prohibition applies regardless of whether the administrative action is denominated as "guidance," "interpretation," "clarification," "implementation plan," "enforcement priority," or any other characterization.

(b) **Rolling Stay Prohibition.** No Region may enact legislation, adopt regulations, or issue executive orders that create new procedural conflicts with a Federal Floor for the purpose of obtaining judicial stays after prior stays on the same Federal Floor have been vacated under Section 3 of this Article. Whether legislation was enacted "for the purpose of obtaining judicial stays" shall be determined by the totality of circumstances, including:

- (1) temporal proximity between the vacatur of a prior stay and the enactment of the new legislation;
- (2) whether the new legislation addresses the same Federal Floor previously subject to a stay;
- (3) whether the "procedural conflict" in the new legislation is minor relative to the substantive policy enacted;
- (4) whether the Region has engaged in a pattern of sequential stays on the same or related Federal Floors.

Legislation creating a procedural conflict with a Federal Floor enacted within one hundred twenty (120) days of the vacatur of a prior stay on the same Federal Floor creates a rebuttable presumption of obstructive purpose. The Region may rebut this presumption by demonstrating, by clear and convincing evidence, that the legislation serves a substantial independent policy objective unrelated to the procedural conflict. [v2: objective presumption — reduces intent-proof burden while preserving legitimate legislative responses via rebuttal]

(c) **Shadow Stay Finding.** The Allocation Review Board may issue a "Shadow Stay Finding" upon determining, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a Region has engaged in sustained obstruction of Federal Floor enforcement. Sustained obstruction exists if:

- (1) a Federal Floor has been effectively non-enforced within the Region for more than sixty (60) cumulative days within any twelve (12) month period, through any combination of judicial stays, administrative suspensions, or legislative modifications;
- (2) the Region has obtained two (2) or more sequential judicial stays on the same Federal Floor within twenty-four (24) months, where each stay was preceded by new legislation creating a fresh procedural conflict;
- (3) a Regional agency has issued an administrative action meeting the criteria of subsection (a) and has failed to rescind it within thirty (30) days of notification by the relevant federal enforcement agency.

The ARB may initiate an investigation upon petition by the Attorney General, by any citizen with standing under Section 5, or upon its own motion when publicly available enforcement data reveals patterns consistent with sustained obstruction.

(d) **Consequences of Shadow Stay Finding.**

- (1) Upon issuance of a Shadow Stay Finding, the ARB shall transmit the Finding to the National Constitutional Court. The NCC shall, within five (5) business days, review the Finding for procedural regularity and, if valid, vacate all pending judicial stays and administrative suspensions affecting the Federal Floor identified in the Finding. The NCC's review is limited to: (i) whether the ARB had jurisdiction over the Region and Federal Floor identified in the Finding, (ii) whether the ARB observed procedural regularity, including quorum, notice to the Region, and opportunity to respond, and (iii) whether the Finding identifies a specific Federal Floor. The NCC may not review the merits of the ARB's preponderance determination or the same-subject-matter classification under subsection (d)(2). If the NCC identifies a procedural defect, it shall return the Finding to the ARB for correction within ten (10) business days rather than deny vacatur; [v2: ARB-triggers-NCC vacatur] [v3: narrow procedural regularity review — adds judicial check without merits-review delay]
- (2) the Region shall be prohibited from obtaining new judicial stays on the same Federal Floor, and on any Federal Floor addressing the same subject matter, for a period of two (2) years from the date of the Finding. For purposes of this subsection, Federal Floors address the "same subject matter" if they share one or more of the following characteristics as determined by the ARB at the time of the Finding: (i) derivation from the same constitutional provision or implementing legislation, (ii) regulation of the same category of conduct, (iii) protection of the same class of persons, or (iv) administration by the same federal enforcement agency; [v2: same-subject scope] [v3: enumerated factors for same-subject determination]
- (3) during the prohibition period, the relevant federal enforcement agency may operate directly within the Region to enforce the Federal Floor, with costs borne by the Region;
- (4) the Region shall reimburse the federal government for documented enforcement costs incurred during the period of non-enforcement;
- (5) Regional officials who designed, directed, or coordinated the sustained obstruction are personally liable in civil actions brought by affected persons or by the Attorney General. Personal liability requires proof by clear and convincing evidence that the official (i) held decision-making authority over the obstructive action, (ii) acted with knowledge that the action would suspend or materially narrow Federal Floor enforcement, and (iii) continued the action after notice from a federal enforcement agency or the ARB. Officials found liable may be subject to disqualification from public office under the same standards applicable to other constitutional violations. Nothing in this subsection creates criminal liability; criminal referrals remain within the Attorney General's prosecutorial discretion. [v2: personal civil liability — replaces AG-referral-only with direct citizen remedy; clear-and-convincing standard + knowledge requirement protect legitimate advocacy]

(e) **Citizen Enforcement and Damages.** In addition to the standing provided by Section 5 of this Article:

- (1) any person who suffered concrete harm from the non-enforcement of a Federal Floor during a period of sustained obstruction may bring suit in federal court against the Region;
- (2) recoverable damages include: lost wages, benefits, or entitlements attributable to non-enforcement; costs of alternative arrangements necessitated by non-enforcement; and consequential damages proximately caused by non-enforcement;
- (3) prevailing plaintiffs shall recover reasonable attorney fees and litigation costs from the Region;
- (4) class actions are authorized where the non-enforcement affected a class of similarly situated persons;
- (5) the two-year prohibition period under subsection (d)(2) creates a rebuttable presumption that non-enforcement during the preceding period was caused by the Region's sustained obstruction.

(f) **Coordination with Existing Provisions.**

- (1) This Section supplements Section 3 of this Article. Section 3's requirements for judicial order transmission, NCC review, and anti-reliance protections continue to apply independently;
- (2) the forty-eight (48) hour transmission requirement of Section 3(e) applies to administrative actions meeting the criteria of subsection (a) of this Section, in addition to judicial orders. Regional agencies issuing such actions shall transmit them to the National Constitutional Court within forty-eight (48) hours of the earliest of: (i) the date the administrative action is formally issued, (ii) the date the action is first implemented or applied, or (iii) the date the action first produces measurable impact on Federal Floor enforcement within the Region; [v2: clock start defined] [v3: triple-trigger captures formal orders and informal guidance]
- (3) the expedited review provisions of Section 4 apply to challenges brought under this Section;
- (4) a Shadow Stay Finding does not require a prior finding of non-compliance under Section 3. The ARB may issue a Finding based on administrative obstruction alone, judicial obstruction alone, or any combination;
- (5) nothing in this Section limits the authority of federal courts to vacate individual stays under Section 3(e) or to award remedies under Section 4(f). This Section provides additional, systemic enforcement mechanisms.

## Gaming Vectors

| # | Vector | Description | Addressed By |
|---|--------|-------------|-------------|
| GV-1 | Procedural Conflict Pretext | Region passes law 99% matching Federal Floor with one procedural difference; Regional court stays Federal Floor pending "clarification" | §3(e) existing: 48-hour transmission, NCC 15-day review; §6(b) rolling stay prohibition catches sequential pretexts; §6(c)(2) pattern detection for two or more sequential stays |
| GV-2 | Rolling Stay | First stay vacated; Region passes new "clarifying" law creating new conflict; new stay issued; cycle repeats | §6(b) rolling stay prohibition with totality-of-circumstances test + 120-day rebuttable presumption; §6(c)(2) explicit trigger for two sequential stays within 24 months; §6(d)(2) two-year same-subject prohibition after Finding |
| GV-3 | Administrative Deference | Regional agency interprets Federal Floor restrictively; Regional court defers to agency interpretation | §6(a) administrative suspension prohibition; §6(a)(1) "materially narrowing" defined; §6(a)(3) covers all characterizations; §6(f)(2) extends 48-hour NCC transmission to administrative actions |
| GV-4 | "Working On It" Administrative Delay | Regional agency claims ongoing review of Federal Floor implementation; enforcement suspended indefinitely | §6(a) prohibits implementation holds regardless of characterization; §6(c)(3) thirty-day cure period after federal notification; §6(c)(1) sixty-day non-enforcement trigger |
| GV-5 | Local Government Delegation | Region delegates Federal Floor implementation to local governments that refuse compliance; Region claims no control | §6(c)(1) measures non-enforcement across the Region regardless of cause; ARB Finding based on *result* (non-enforcement), not *mechanism*; Region bears costs under §6(d)(3)-(4) |
| GV-6 | Legislative Churn | Region enacts and repeals legislation rapidly, each version creating a different procedural conflict, preventing any single stay from being reviewed | §6(b) temporal proximity factor + 120-day rebuttable presumption; §6(c)(1) cumulative sixty-day trigger counts across all stays; §6(c)(2) catches sequential stays regardless of legislative vehicle |
| GV-7 | Enforcement Priority Manipulation | Regional agency claims it is "enforcing" the Federal Floor but assigns it lowest priority, resulting in de facto non-enforcement | §6(a)(2) ninety-percent enforcement rate benchmark with dual baseline (prevents zero-baseline gaming); measurement by federal enforcement agency provides independent verification |
| GV-8 | "Interpretation" vs. "Stay" Labeling | Region claims its administrative action is merely an "interpretation" of the Federal Floor, not a "stay" or "suspension" | §6(a)(3) applies regardless of characterization; §6(a)(1) "materially narrowing" definition captures restrictive interpretations |
| GV-9 | Zero-Baseline Gaming | Region with historically low or zero enforcement of a Federal Floor issues administrative suspension; claims no decline because pre-action rate was already near zero | §6(a)(2) dual baseline: enforcement measured against higher of pre-action rate or national average; publication mandate ensures national average data exists; provisional baseline for new Floors prevents race-to-obstruct window; 100% fallback if data unpublished |
| GV-10 | New Floor Race-to-Obstruct | Region suspends enforcement of newly enacted Federal Floor before any baseline can be established, arguing no national average exists yet | §6(a)(2) provisional baseline: agency must establish baseline within 90 days of new Floor's effective date; if not established, baseline is 100%; Region cannot exploit data vacuum |
| GV-11 | Informal Guidance Evasion | Region issues "informal" guidance without formal legal effect, arguing 48-hour clock never starts | §6(f)(2) triple-trigger: clock starts on earliest of formal issuance, first implementation, or first measurable enforcement impact — captures informal guidance by its operational effect |

## Design Decisions

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|----------|-----------|
| DD-1 | Placed as Art XIV-RF, §6 (after Standing to Enforce) rather than a new article | The vulnerability arises from gaps in the existing judicial enforcement architecture (§3-§5). Section 6 logically extends the enforcement sequence: §3 (interpretation uniformity) → §4 (provisional relief) → §5 (standing) → §6 (systemic obstruction). |
| DD-2 | Renumbered from proposal's "Section 10" to Section 6 | Art XIV-RF currently uses Sections 1-5. The proposal's original "Section 10" target was based on the file's overall section numbering (which includes Art III-RF), not Art XIV-RF's internal numbering. |
| DD-3 | Extended §3(e) transmission requirement to administrative actions | The 48-hour NCC transmission requirement is the most effective existing safeguard, but it only applies to "judicial orders." Administrative actions with equivalent effect should receive equivalent scrutiny. |
| DD-4 | 90% enforcement rate benchmark for "effect of suspending" | Bright-line threshold provides objective measurement. Set at 90% (not 100%) to avoid triggering on de minimis enforcement variation. Measured by federal enforcement agency to prevent Regional self-reporting manipulation. |
| DD-5 | ARB as systemic finder rather than NCC | The NCC reviews individual stays under §3(e) within 15 days — case-by-case adjudication. The ARB is better positioned for *pattern* detection across stays, administrative actions, and legislative modifications. Institutional alignment: NCC handles individual stays, ARB handles systemic findings. |
| DD-6 | 60-day cumulative / 24-month window for pattern detection | 60-day cumulative non-enforcement threshold distinguishes sustained obstruction from temporary procedural delays. 24-month window for sequential stays captures rolling obstruction while allowing sufficient observation period. |
| DD-7 | Two-year prohibition on new stays after Finding | Creates meaningful consequence without permanently stripping Regional court authority. Two years is sufficient to break a rolling stay cycle and allow full Federal Floor enforcement. Region retains litigation rights on the merits — prohibition covers only *stays*, not *challenges*. |
| DD-8 | Direct federal enforcement authority during prohibition | Without direct enforcement, a prohibition on stays is toothless if Regional agencies continue to obstruct administratively. Federal enforcement within the Region ensures the Federal Floor is actually enforced, not merely "unstayed." |
| DD-9 | Citizen enforcement with damages (not just standing) | §5 provides standing but not specific damages for Federal Floor non-enforcement. Citizens harmed by shadow stays — e.g., workers denied minimum wage protections — need a monetary remedy, not just declaratory relief. Class actions authorized because shadow stays typically affect entire classes of persons within the Region. |
| DD-10 | Totality-of-circumstances test for rolling stay intent | A bright-line rule (e.g., "no new legislation within 6 months of stay vacatur") would be both over-inclusive (catching legitimate legislative responses to NCC guidance) and under-inclusive (missing carefully timed obstruction). Four enumerated factors provide guidance without rigidity. |
| DD-11 | Constitutional 90% benchmark with dual baseline (resolves OQ-1) | [v2] 90% threshold remains constitutional (self-executing, no statutory delegation) for certainty and tamper-resistance. Dual baseline (higher of pre-action rate or national average) addresses the zero-baseline vulnerability without requiring statutory methodology changes. The federal enforcement agency measurement requirement prevents Regional self-reporting manipulation. |
| DD-12 | Same-subject Federal Floor prohibition scope (resolves OQ-2) | [v2] Two-year prohibition extends to Federal Floors addressing the "same subject matter," not just the specific Floor or all Floors. Prevents shifting obstruction to adjacent Floors (e.g., from minimum wage to overtime protections) while remaining proportionate — a Region obstructing one labor Floor is not prohibited from seeking stays on environmental Floors. ARB determines subject-matter grouping at time of Finding. |
| DD-13 | Personal civil liability for officials at clear-and-convincing standard (resolves OQ-3) | [v2] Replaces AG-referral-only with direct citizen civil actions against officials. Clear-and-convincing evidence standard (not preponderance) protects legitimate advocacy. Three-element test (decision-making authority + knowledge + post-notice continuation) limits liability to officials who knowingly persisted. Criminal liability excluded — preserves AG prosecutorial discretion. Due-process protections prevent chilling effect on Regional governance. |
| DD-14 | NCC procedural regularity review of ARB Findings (resolves R2 OQ) | [v3] Mandatory vacatur without any judicial check creates risk if ARB makes procedurally defective Finding (wrong Region, no quorum, no notice). NCC reviews three elements: jurisdiction, procedural regularity, and specificity of Federal Floor identification. NCC may NOT review merits (preponderance assessment) or same-subject-matter classification — preventing a merits-review delay loop. Defective Findings returned to ARB for correction within 10 business days rather than denied outright. |
| DD-15 | Publication mandate with 100% fallback for enforcement data | [v3] The dual baseline depends on "national average enforcement rate as published," but nothing required publication. Federal enforcement agencies must publish annual data with methodology. If unpublished within 12 months, national average deemed 100% — incentivizes publication rather than creating a gap. The 100% fallback is conservative (favors enforcement) because the failure to publish is the agency's, not the Region's. |
| DD-16 | Provisional baseline for new Federal Floors (90-day establishment window) | [v3] Newly enacted Federal Floors have no enforcement history, creating a race-to-obstruct window. Agency must establish provisional baseline within 90 days. Default is 100% if not established. Complements DD-15 publication mandate by covering the specific edge case of the first year of a new Floor's existence. |
| DD-17 | Triple-trigger for 48-hour transmission clock | [v3] v2's "takes legal effect" remained ambiguous for informal guidance and phased rollouts. Triple-trigger (earliest of formal issuance, first implementation, first measurable impact) captures both formal orders and informal guidance by operational effect. Prevents Regions from arguing informal guidance has no "legal effect" to delay NCC notification. |
| DD-18 | Enumerated factors for same-subject-matter determination | [v3] v2 left "same policy domain" to unbounded ARB discretion. Four enumerated factors (shared constitutional/statutory authority, same category of conduct, same protected class, same enforcement agency) provide structure while preserving ARB flexibility. Factors are disjunctive (one or more) to prevent narrow construction. NCC review of classification explicitly excluded (DD-14) to avoid creating parallel merits pathway. |

## Open Questions

*All open questions resolved in v2.*

| # | Question | Resolution | Design Decision |
|---|----------|------------|-----------------|
| OQ-1 | Should the 90% enforcement rate benchmark be constitutional or statutory? | Option A modified: Constitutional with dual baseline | DD-11 |
| OQ-2 | Should the two-year prohibition apply to all Federal Floors or only the specific one subject to the Finding? | Option C: Same-subject Federal Floors | DD-12 |
| OQ-3 | Should Regional officials face personal liability for shadow stay abuse? | Option A: Personal civil liability at clear and convincing standard | DD-13 |

## Relationship to Other Gaps

| Gap | Relationship |
|-----|-------------|
| Gap 95 (Certification Deadlock) | Resolved. Gap 95 addressed Regional judiciary blocking federal officer certification. Gap 111 addresses Regional courts/agencies blocking Federal Floor *enforcement*. Different targets (officer certification vs. substantive law enforcement). |
| Gap 103 (Administrative Exhaustion) | Resolved. Gap 103 addressed delay through mandatory exhaustion of administrative remedies. Gap 111 addresses delay through stays and administrative suspensions. Different mechanisms but same temporal harm (non-enforcement during delay). |
| Gap 78 (Rights Floor Arbitrage) | Resolved. Gap 78 addressed exploiting differences between Federal Floor definitions to find the weakest interpretation. Gap 111 addresses obstructing enforcement of Federal Floors regardless of interpretation. Gap 78 games *interpretation*; Gap 111 games *enforcement*. |
| Gap 59 (State-Regional Preemption Deadlock) | Proposal Available. Gap 59 addresses State obstruction of Regional authority through administrative non-compliance. Gap 111 addresses Regional obstruction of Federal authority through judicial/administrative stays. Same obstruction pattern, different vertical relationship (State vs. Federal vs. Region). |
