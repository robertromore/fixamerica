# Gap 90 Resolution: Article IV, Section 4-D Expansion

## Status: Draft (v3 FINAL)

**Resolves:** Gap 90 (Senate "Blue-Slipping" of Constitutional Officers)

**Severity:** Medium

**Date:** 2026-02-03

**Revision:** v3 FINAL — Round 2 convergence fixes applied (S5, S6, S7, S8 noted)

**Target:** Article IV (Federal Governance Procedures), Section 4 (Senate Powers) — new Section 4-D appended after existing Section 4-C

**Placement Rationale:** Gap 90 proposes protections against Senate confirmation obstruction via serial rejection, blue-slipping, and institutional depopulation. The existing Section 4-B (Mandatory Confirmation Procedures, Gap 222 resolution) closes the "silent veto" — inaction triggers deemed confirmation after 90 days. Section 4-C (Acting Official Limitations, Gap 168 resolution) provides time-limited acting official coverage and quorum emergency mechanisms. However, neither addresses: (1) serial active rejection as an indefinite blocking strategy, (2) term-expiration holdover for constitutional body members, (3) qualification standards preventing pretextual rejection, or (4) pattern-based obstruction detection and consequences. Section 4-D fills these residual gaps.

## Pre-Existing Coverage Analysis

| # | Proposal Component | Existing Coverage | Delta? |
|---|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| 1 | Mandatory 60/90-day confirmation timeline | §4-B(b)-(c): 60-day committee, 90-day total | **NO** — fully covered |
| 2 | Automatic/deemed confirmation on inaction | §4-B(b)(ii): deemed confirmed by operation of law | **NO** — fully covered |
| 3 | 2/3 removal safety valve | §4-B(f): 180-day, 2/3 removal window | **NO** — fully covered |
| 4 | Blue-slip/hold limitation | §4-B(b)(iv): supermajority cloture superseded; §4-B(c)(iv): no procedural delay | **PARTIAL** — functionally blocked but not explicitly named; "blue-slip" and "anonymous hold" traditions could be recharacterized |
| 5 | Expedited quorum emergency confirmation | §4-C(e)(4): 30-day fill via Chief Justice | **PARTIAL** — different mechanism (Chief Justice appointment vs. expedited Senate confirmation); no shortened Senate timeline |
| 6 | Qualification standards for nominees | Not addressed | **YES** — no minimum competency criteria or professional certification |
| 7 | Professional bar/association certification | Not addressed | **YES** — no external qualification validation |
| 8 | Different-nominee requirement on rejection | Not addressed | **YES** — President can resubmit same nominee indefinitely |
| 9 | Multiple rejections don't extend subsequent timelines | §4-B(h)(i): covers withdrawal, not rejection | **YES** — Senate rejection resets 90-day clock for each new nominee |
| 10 | Holdover authority for expiring terms | Not addressed anywhere | **YES** — term expiration creates vacancy with only 120-day acting coverage (§4-C) |
| 11 | Acting CJ appointments for multi-member bodies | §4-C(e)(2): Chief Justice temporary appointment | **NO** — fully covered |
| 12 | Quorum preservation (50% + reduced operation) | §4-C(e)(4): quorum emergency with 30-day fill | **NO** — fully covered |
| 13 | ARB/NEC confirmation obstruction finding | Not addressed | **YES** — no pattern-detection mechanism |
| 14 | Obstruction consequences (reduced timeline, procedure suspension) | Not addressed | **YES** — no consequence for serial rejection pattern |
| 15 | Regional accountability for obstruction | Not addressed | **YES** — no identification or disclosure of obstructing Regions |

**Pre-existing coverage:** 6 of 15 components fully covered (§4-B + §4-C), 2 partially covered, 7 need new constitutional text

**True delta:** 5 components need new constitutional text: holdover authority, qualification standards, serial rejection anti-gaming, obstruction finding with consequences, regional accountability

## Cross-References to Existing Sections 4-B and 4-C

| Provision | Relevance to Gap 90 |
|-----------|---------------------|
| §4-B(b)(ii) deemed confirmation | Closes silent veto; does NOT close active rejection veto |
| §4-B(b)(iv) simple majority | Supersedes cloture; does NOT address pretextual rejection basis |
| §4-B(c)(iv) no procedural delay | Blocks calendar manipulation; does NOT block blue-slip tradition by name |
| §4-B(f) 180-day, 2/3 removal | Safety valve for malicious nominations; 2/3 bar is high but exploitable by 5/7 Region coalition |
| §4-B(h)(i) no clock reset on withdrawal | Covers withdrawal gaming; does NOT cover rejection gaming (fresh clock on each rejection) |
| §4-C(b)(1) 120-day acting limit | Acting officials expire; serial rejection + expired terms → rotating temporaries with no institutional continuity |
| §4-C(e)(2) Chief Justice temporary | Backup mechanism; but temporaries limited to 120 days, creating revolving door |
| §4-C(e)(4) quorum emergency | 30-day fill; does NOT address underlying cause (serial rejection preventing permanent membership) |

## Round 1 Convergence (v1 → v2)

| ID | Category | Finding | Resolution |
|----|----------|---------|-----------|
| C1 | Convergent | "Qualified" has no independent determination mechanism (both reviewers) | Add cross-body qualification certification — ARB certifies NEC nominees, NEC certifies ARB nominees. Advisory, but rejection of certified-qualified nominee counts as unreasoned. → §4-D(b)(3) |
| S1 | Single-reviewer | HIGH — §4-D(c)(2)-(3) cross-references §4-B(b)(ii) 90-day clock, undermining 45-day cap | Make 45-day deemed confirmation self-contained in §4-D(c), independent of §4-B timing. → §4-D(c)(2)-(3) |
| S2 | Single-reviewer | MEDIUM — Voice votes evade roll-call for regional accountability | Require recorded roll-call vote for all rejection votes on constitutional body nominees. → §4-D(d)(3) |
| S3 | Single-reviewer | LOW — Single-member finding body can trigger full consequences | Minimum 3 members for obstruction finding; if below 3, Chief Justice makes finding on petition. → §4-D(e)(4) |
| S4 | Single-reviewer | 30-day presidential nomination deadline during holdover/vacancy (symmetry principle) | Mandatory 30-day nomination deadline with public reporting. → §4-D(a)(6) |

**Open Question Resolutions (v2):**

| # | Resolution | Basis |
|---|-----------|-------|
| Q1 | Oversight bodies only (Option A) | No reviewer input; judges serve during good behavior |
| Q2 | Limited expedited procedural review (Option C) | Relates to S3; 30-day review of procedural regularity only. → §4-D(e)(5) |
| Q3 | Oversight bodies only (Option A) | No reviewer input; judicial independence warrants separate treatment |
| Q4 | Enhanced via C1 independent certification | Cross-body certification makes boilerplate rejection harder to sustain |
| Q5 | Adopted — 30-day nomination deadline (Option A) | Via S4 (symmetry principle). → §4-D(a)(6) |

---

## Round 2 Convergence (v2 → v3)

| ID | Category | Finding | Resolution |
|----|----------|---------|-----------|
| S5 | Single-reviewer | HIGH — §4-D(b)(3) certification has no deadline or deemed-certified default; certifying body delay/incapacity creates new silent-veto point | Add 21-day certification deadline from nomination date + deemed-certified-as-qualified default on inaction or quorum failure. → §4-D(b)(3) |
| S6 | Single-reviewer | MEDIUM — No default certifier for "other Constitutional Oversight Bodies" absent statutory designation; certification requirement unsatisfiable | Add ARB as constitutional default certifier for bodies without statutory designation. → §4-D(b)(3) |
| S7 | Single-reviewer | MEDIUM — "Federal Constitutional Court" not used in existing constitution; should be "National Constitutional Court" or "Constitutional Court" | Align to "National Constitutional Court" (per Art XIV-RF §3(e), Art I §7, Art II §6). → §4-D(e)(4)-(5) |
| S8 | Single-reviewer | LOW — Scope mismatch: §4-D(d) covers judicial positions but §4-D(b)-(c) apply only to oversight bodies | No text change — intentional design. (d) is content-neutral procedural protection; (b)-(c) are substantive overrides. Different scope documented in Q1/Q3 resolutions. → Design Decision 17 |

## Proposed Constitutional Text (v3 FINAL)

### New Section 4-D: Confirmation Integrity and Institutional Continuity

> ### Section 4-D. Confirmation Integrity and Institutional Continuity
>
> *Addresses Gap 90: The Senate "Blue-Slipping" of Constitutional Officers. Establishes holdover authority, qualification standards, serial rejection anti-gaming, and confirmation obstruction detection to prevent depopulation of constitutional institutions through strategic confirmation blocking.*
>
> (a) **Holdover Authority.** Members of Constitutional Oversight Bodies established by this Constitution, including the Allocation Review Board and the Independent Fiscal Council:
>
> - (1) May continue to serve beyond the expiration of their term until a successor has been confirmed or deemed confirmed under Section 4-B, provided holdover service does not exceed one (1) year beyond term expiration;
> - (2) During holdover service, the member retains full authority to participate in deliberations, vote, and exercise all powers of the position;
> - (3) Holdover service counts toward quorum calculations as if the member's term had not expired;
> - (4) Holdover authority terminates upon the earlier of: (i) a successor taking office; (ii) the expiration of one year beyond term expiration; or (iii) the member's death, resignation, removal for cause, or incapacity;
> - (5) If holdover authority expires without a successor in place, the vacancy provisions of Section 4-C apply, including temporary appointment by the Chief Justice under Section 4-C(e)(2);
> - (6) When a vacancy exists or holdover service commences under this subsection, the appointing authority shall submit a nomination within thirty (30) calendar days. Failure to nominate within this period does not extend or terminate holdover authority but shall be publicly reported by the Clerk of the Senate and transmitted to each Regional legislature. *(v2 — S4)*
>
> (b) **Qualification Standards.** Nominees to Constitutional Oversight Bodies established by this Constitution:
>
> - (1) Must meet objective qualification criteria established by law for the specific position, which shall include minimum standards of professional experience, educational attainment, and demonstrated expertise relevant to the body's constitutional functions;
> - (2) Must not have a disqualifying conflict of interest, as defined by law, with the constitutional functions of the body to which they are nominated;
> - (3) Prior to committee hearings, a Constitutional Oversight Body other than the one to which the nominee is designated shall certify whether the nominee meets the objective qualification criteria established under paragraph (1). The certifying body shall be: for nominations to the Allocation Review Board, the National Election Court; for nominations to the National Election Court, the Allocation Review Board; and for other Constitutional Oversight Bodies, as designated by law or, absent statutory designation, the Allocation Review Board. The certifying body shall issue its certification within twenty-one (21) calendar days of the date of nomination. If the certifying body fails to act within twenty-one days or lacks a quorum to act, the nominee is deemed certified as meeting the qualification criteria. This certification is advisory and does not bind the Senate, but a Senate rejection of a certified-qualified nominee — including a nominee deemed certified under this paragraph — counts as an unreasoned rejection for purposes of subsection (c) unless the rejection statement under paragraph (4) identifies specific qualification deficiencies not addressed by or not considered in the certification; *(v2 — C1; v3 — S5: 21-day deadline with deemed-certified default; S6: ARB as constitutional default certifier)*
> - (4) The Senate may reject a nominee for failure to meet qualification standards under paragraph (1), documented ethical violations, or disqualifying conflicts of interest under paragraph (2). The Senate's vote to reject shall be accompanied by a public written statement specifying the basis for rejection from among these categories;
> - (5) The written statement requirement under paragraph (4) is a transparency obligation. Failure to issue a written statement does not invalidate a rejection vote, but an unreasoned rejection counts toward the serial rejection threshold under subsection (c).
>
> (c) **Serial Rejection Anti-Gaming.** If the Senate rejects two or more consecutive nominees for the same position on a Constitutional Oversight Body:
>
> - (1) Upon the second consecutive rejection, the confirmation period under Section 4-B(b) for the next nominee for that position reduces from ninety (90) to sixty (60) calendar days;
> - (2) Upon the third consecutive rejection, the confirmation period for the next nominee for that position is forty-five (45) calendar days from the date of nomination. If the Senate does not vote to reject within this period, the nominee is deemed confirmed by operation of this subsection without reference to the timelines of Section 4-B(b). A rejection vote within the forty-five-day period is valid only if the rejection statement under subsection (b)(4) cites specific qualification deficiencies, documented ethical violations, or disqualifying conflicts of interest — a rejection without such specification is void; *(v2 — S1)*
> - (3) A rejection vote that fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (2) does not interrupt deemed confirmation under this subsection, and the nominee takes office on the forty-sixth (46th) calendar day; *(v2 — S1)*
> - (4) For purposes of this subsection, "consecutive rejections" means rejections of different nominees for the same position. Renomination of a previously rejected individual does not reset the consecutive rejection count;
> - (5) The consecutive rejection count resets upon: (i) a nominee being confirmed or deemed confirmed for the position; (ii) a change in the office of President or, for positions appointed by other authorities, a change in the appointing authority; or (iii) the commencement of a new Congress.
>
> (d) **Named Procedural Prohibitions.** In addition to the procedural protections established in Section 4-B(b)(iv) and (c)(iv):
>
> - (1) No Senate rule, tradition, custom, or practice — including "blue-slip" objections, "courtesy holds," anonymous holds, or any procedure by which a single Senator or group of Senators from the nominee's home Region may prevent or delay committee hearings — may be applied to delay, prevent, or condition committee hearings or floor votes on nominations to Constitutional Oversight Bodies or judicial positions created by this Constitution;
> - (2) Paragraph (1) does not restrict individual Senators from voting against a nominee or from publicly stating objections to a nominee. The prohibition applies to procedural mechanisms that prevent a vote from occurring, not to the exercise of voting rights;
> - (3) All votes to reject nominees to Constitutional Oversight Bodies or judicial positions created by this Constitution shall be by recorded roll-call vote. Voice votes, division votes, or any other voting method that does not produce a public record of each Senator's individual vote are not valid for rejection of such nominees; *(v2 — S2)*
> - (4) This subsection is self-executing. Any Senate rule inconsistent with this subsection is void ab initio as applied to nominations covered by this section.
>
> (e) **Confirmation Obstruction Finding.** The Allocation Review Board, or the National Election Court for nominations to its own membership, may find confirmation obstruction if:
>
> - (1) The Senate has rejected three or more consecutive qualified nominees for the same position and the rejection statements under subsection (b)(4) do not cite specific qualification deficiencies, documented ethical violations, or disqualifying conflicts of interest;
> - (2) Vacancies on a Constitutional Oversight Body have exceeded the body's quorum threshold for more than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive calendar days due to Senate inaction or serial rejection;
> - (3) A pattern of confirmation delay or rejection demonstrates that the purpose is to prevent the constitutional body from functioning rather than to exercise the Senate's legitimate qualitative check on nominees;
> - (4) The obstruction finding shall be adopted by a majority vote of the non-vacant members of the finding body, provided that no fewer than three (3) members participate in the vote. If the finding body has fewer than three non-vacant members, the Chief Justice of the National Constitutional Court may make the obstruction finding upon petition by any non-vacant member of the affected body, the President, or any Regional legislature. The finding shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the President, the Senate, and the public; *(v2 — S3; v3 — S7: court name aligned)*
> - (5) An obstruction finding under this subsection is subject to expedited judicial review before the National Constitutional Court, limited to procedural regularity — including whether the finding body met the quorum requirement of paragraph (4) and whether the factual predicates of paragraphs (1) through (3) were facially satisfied. The Court shall render its decision within thirty (30) calendar days of the petition for review. Substantive review of whether the Senate's rejections constituted obstruction is not available under this paragraph. *(v2 — Q2 resolution; v3 — S7: court name aligned)*
>
> (f) **Obstruction Consequences.** Upon a finding of confirmation obstruction under subsection (e):
>
> - (1) The confirmation period under Section 4-B(b) reduces to sixty (60) calendar days for all pending and future nominees to the affected body, until the body has reached full authorized membership or until two years have elapsed from the finding, whichever is earlier;
> - (2) The named procedural prohibitions of subsection (d) extend to all Senate proceedings related to nominations to the affected body, including committee scheduling, witness selection, and document production;
> - (3) The Senate may not invoke the removal safety valve of Section 4-B(f) against any nominee deemed confirmed during the obstruction period;
> - (4) The finding shall be transmitted to each Regional legislature whose Senators voted to reject the nominees identified in the obstruction finding, and shall be a matter of public record that may not be sealed, expunged, or classified.
>
> (g) **Regional Accountability.** When a confirmation obstruction finding under subsection (e) identifies Senators whose votes constituted the majority of rejection votes:
>
> - (1) The finding shall identify the Regions represented by those Senators;
> - (2) The identified Regions' delegations shall be publicly noted in the finding, and the finding shall be transmitted to each identified Region's legislature and chief executive;
> - (3) This subsection imposes no legal penalty on the identified Senators or Regions beyond disclosure. Regional electorates and legislatures may exercise their own accountability mechanisms.
>
> (h) **Coordination.** This section complements and shall be construed in coordination with:
>
> - (1) Section 4-B (Mandatory Confirmation Procedures) — the timelines established in this section modify the default timelines of Section 4-B where this section provides shorter deadlines. Where a specific provision of this Constitution establishes a confirmation timeline shorter than those in this section, that provision controls;
> - (2) Section 4-C (Acting Official Limitations) — holdover authority under subsection (a) does not extend or modify the time limits on acting officials under Section 4-C. Holdover and acting service are separate mechanisms: holdover applies to members whose terms have expired, while acting service applies to persons serving in an acting capacity for a vacant position;
> - (3) Article VII, Section 8(l) (Appointment and Removal Freeze) — during Caretaker Governance, the restrictions of Article VII, Section 8(l) apply in addition to this section. Holdover authority under subsection (a) continues during Caretaker Governance but does not permit new appointments or confirmations that are frozen under Section 8(l).

## Design Decisions

1. **Holdover limited to 1 year** — Prevents indefinite holdover that would undermine term limits while providing sufficient buffer for confirmation procedures. Combined with §4-B's 90-day deemed confirmation, this creates a 1-year + 90-day maximum gap between term expiration and successor confirmation. If the Senate actively rejects and the serial rejection anti-gaming provisions trigger, the effective gap is shorter.

2. **Qualification standards delegated to statute** — The Constitution establishes that objective qualification criteria must exist, but delegates the specific requirements (years of experience, education, expertise areas) to implementing legislation. This allows criteria to evolve with professional standards while constitutionally mandating their existence.

3. **Written rejection statement** — Transparency obligation, not a validity requirement. A rejection without a written statement still stands, but counts toward the serial rejection threshold. This creates incentive for reasoned rejection without judicially entangling the Senate's core confirmation power. The "transparency not validity" distinction avoids justiciability problems.

4. **Escalating serial rejection consequences** — 2 rejections → 60-day clock. 3 rejections → 45-day clock with mandatory qualification-based justification for further rejection. This graduated approach preserves the Senate's legitimate check for the first two nominees while progressively limiting pretextual blocking. The key insight: if the Senate has rejected 3 qualified nominees, the inference that rejection serves institutional depopulation rather than quality control becomes strong.

5. **Deemed confirmation override on 3rd rejection** — After 3 consecutive rejections, the Senate can still reject, but only with specific qualification-based justification. A generic "philosophy" objection or unreasoned rejection is void and does not prevent deemed confirmation. This is the core anti-gaming mechanism: it makes serial rejection progressively harder by requiring the Senate to articulate specific, verifiable objections.

6. **Named procedural prohibitions** — §4-B(b)(iv) and (c)(iv) provide functional protection against procedural delay, but do not name specific Senate traditions (blue-slip, courtesy holds, anonymous holds). Constitutional text naming these traditions explicitly prevents courts from distinguishing between "procedural rules" (covered) and "customs/traditions" (potentially not covered). The self-executing provision ensures immediate effect.

7. **ARB/NEC as obstruction finders** — The ARB and NEC are the constitutional bodies most directly affected by confirmation obstruction, making them appropriate finding bodies. The potential conflict of interest (body finding obstruction affecting its own membership) is mitigated by: (a) the finding triggers consequences but does not itself confirm anyone; (b) the finding is published and publicly reviewable; (c) the finding body's interest in full membership is aligned with the constitutional system's interest in functional institutions.

8. **Obstruction consequences: safety valve suspension** — §4-B(f) allows the Senate to remove deemed-confirmed officers by 2/3 vote within 180 days. During an obstruction finding, this safety valve is suspended. Without this suspension, a 5/7-Region Senate coalition could create a doom loop: deemed confirmation triggers → 2/3 removal → new vacancy → deemed confirmation → 2/3 removal → indefinitely. The suspension breaks the cycle by ensuring deemed-confirmed officers during obstruction cannot be immediately removed.

9. **Regional accountability as disclosure only** — The obstruction finding identifies responsible Regions publicly but imposes no legal penalty on Senators or Regions. Constitutional authority to reject remains intact; the remedy is informational, enabling democratic accountability. This avoids punishing Senators for votes — which would raise core legislative immunity concerns — while ensuring the electorate has the information needed to evaluate their Senators' conduct.

10. **Consecutive rejection count reset** — Resets on: (a) confirmation/deemed confirmation, (b) change of appointing authority, (c) new Congress. This prevents a count from carrying across administrations or political contexts where the rejection basis may legitimately differ.

11. **Coordination with Art VII §8(l)** — Holdover authority continues during Caretaker Governance (the member keeps serving), but the Caretaker cannot initiate new nominations or confirmations that are frozen under the appointment freeze. This deconfliction ensures both Gap 90 and Gap 118 operate without interference.

12. **S1: Self-contained deemed confirmation (v2)** — The 45-day deemed confirmation in §4-D(c)(2) is self-contained rather than cross-referencing §4-B(b)(ii). v1 referenced §4-B(b)(ii)'s deemed confirmation mechanism, creating ambiguity about whether the longer §4-B 90-day period might supersede the shorter §4-D 45-day period. v2 establishes deemed confirmation "by operation of this subsection without reference to the timelines of Section 4-B(b)," making the shorter deadline unambiguously controlling.

13. **C1: Independent cross-body qualification certification (v2)** — v2 adds cross-body qualification certification: ARB certifies NEC nominees, NEC certifies ARB nominees. This addresses the convergent finding from both reviewers that "qualified" lacked an independent determination mechanism. The certification is advisory (preserving Senate power) but rejection of a certified-qualified nominee counts as "unreasoned" for serial rejection purposes unless the rejection statement identifies specific deficiencies not addressed by the certification. This makes pretextual blocking visible without overriding Senate authority.

14. **S2: Recorded roll-call vote requirement (v2)** — v2 requires recorded roll-call votes for all rejection votes on constitutional body nominees. Without this, Senators could reject nominees via voice vote, evading the regional accountability provisions of §4-D(g). The recorded vote also strengthens the "unreasoned rejection" determination — rejection with no written statement AND an anonymous vote would maximally indicate pretextual blocking. This requirement parallels existing practice for significant Senate votes and does not meaningfully burden the Senate's operations.

15. **S3: Minimum finding body quorum (v2)** — v2 requires at least 3 members of the finding body to participate in an obstruction finding vote. v1 allowed any majority of non-vacant members, meaning a single remaining member could trigger far-reaching consequences. The 3-member minimum ensures that the finding has deliberative weight. When fewer than 3 members remain (itself evidence of severe obstruction), the Chief Justice steps in — consistent with the Chief Justice's existing role in §4-C for quorum emergencies. This also connects to the expedited judicial review provision in §4-D(e)(5).

16. **S4: Mandatory nomination deadline (v2)** — v2 adds a 30-day nomination deadline for the appointing authority when holdover or vacancy begins. This symmetry principle ensures obstruction cannot be blamed on Senate delay when the President has failed to nominate. The deadline is disclosure-enforced (public reporting by Clerk of the Senate, transmitted to Regional legislatures) rather than legally penalized, paralleling the transparency approach of §4-D(b)(4-5). This resolves Open Question 5, which both leaned toward symmetry but was left open for reviewer input.

17. **S8: Intentional scope difference between (b)-(c) and (d) (v3)** — Subsection (d) applies procedural prohibitions to both Constitutional Oversight Bodies and judicial positions, while subsections (b)-(c) apply qualification standards and serial rejection consequences only to oversight bodies. This is intentional. The procedural prohibitions in (d) are content-neutral — they prevent a vote from being blocked, not what grounds the Senate uses for voting. The qualification standards and serial rejection provisions in (b)-(c) constrain the substance of Senate judgment and ultimately override Senate refusal through deemed confirmation. Applying substantive override to judicial nominations would raise different separation-of-powers concerns. Judicial nominees already have §4-B deemed confirmation for inaction; the additional serial-rejection override is reserved for oversight bodies where institutional depopulation is the primary threat vector. This scope difference is documented in the resolutions of Open Questions 1 and 3.

18. **S5: Certification deadline with deemed-certified default (v3)** — v2 required cross-body certification "prior to committee hearings" without a deadline or default. This created a potential new silent-veto: a certifying body (or a body lacking quorum) could delay certification indefinitely, preventing committee hearings from proceeding. v3 adds a 21-day deadline from nomination date with deemed-certified-as-qualified default. The 21-day window allows meaningful review while completing well before the 60-day committee hearing deadline under §4-B(c)(ii). The deemed-certified default ensures that certifying body incapacity or delay cannot be weaponized. A deemed-certified nominee who is subsequently rejected by the Senate receives the same "unreasoned rejection" treatment as an affirmatively certified nominee.

19. **S6: ARB as constitutional default certifier (v3)** — v2 designated "as designated by law" for bodies other than ARB/NEC, but provided no fallback if no statute existed. v3 adds the ARB as the constitutional default certifier for bodies without statutory designation. The ARB is appropriate because: (a) it is the broadest-scoped constitutional oversight body; (b) it has expertise across allocation and governance domains; (c) its composition (retired appellate judges under Art II §7(f)) gives it credibility for qualification assessment. Statutory designation can override this default for specialized bodies where a different certifier would be more appropriate.

## Open Questions (All Resolved)

| # | Question | v1 Leaning | v2 Resolution | Basis |
|---|----------|-----------|---------------|-------|
| 1 | Should holdover apply to judicial positions or only constitutional oversight bodies? | A — oversight bodies only | **Oversight bodies only (A)** | No reviewer input. Art XIV §2(a) judicial tenure is by good behavior; fixed-term judicial positions are unusual in this constitution. |
| 2 | Should the obstruction finding be subject to judicial review? | C — limited expedited review | **Limited expedited procedural review (C)** | Relates to S3. New §4-D(e)(5) provides 30-day expedited review limited to procedural regularity (quorum met, factual predicates facially satisfied). Substantive review excluded. |
| 3 | Should the serial rejection count apply to judicial positions or only to constitutional oversight bodies? | A — oversight bodies only | **Oversight bodies only (A)** | No reviewer input. §4-B already provides deemed confirmation for judicial nominees. Serial rejection consequences for judiciary raise separation-of-powers concerns beyond Gap 90's scope. |
| 4 | Is the "written statement" requirement too easily satisfied by boilerplate? | B — transparency purpose sufficient | **Enhanced via C1 certification** | Cross-body certification provides independent baseline. Senate can still reject, but rejecting a certified-qualified nominee without identifying specific deficiencies beyond the certification counts as unreasoned — making boilerplate harder to sustain. |
| 5 | Should the obstruction finding also trigger expedited presidential nomination deadlines? | A — yes, symmetry | **Adopted via S4** | New §4-D(a)(6) imposes 30-day nomination deadline independently of obstruction finding, applying whenever holdover or vacancy begins. Broader than the original question (applies always, not just during obstruction). |

---

## Gaming Vector Coverage

| Gaming Vector | Constitutional Response |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Perpetual blue-slip (single-Senator blockade) | §4-D(d)(1) — named procedural prohibitions; blue-slip, courtesy holds, anonymous holds explicitly voided for constitutional body nominees |
| Philosophy veto (pretextual rejection) | §4-D(b)(4) — rejection must cite qualification, ethical, or conflict basis; §4-D(c)(2) — unreasoned 3rd rejection is void; §4-D(b)(3) — cross-body certification makes pretextual rejection visible *(v2 — C1; v3 — S5/S6 close certification delay vector)* |
| Serial rejection loop (active rejection veto) | §4-D(c) — escalating consequences: 2nd rejection → 60 days, 3rd → 45 days with self-contained deemed confirmation *(v2 — S1: independent of §4-B timing)* |
| Referee elimination (quorum depopulation) | §4-D(a) — holdover authority prevents term-expiration vacancies; §4-D(e)(2) — 180-day quorum vacancy triggers obstruction finding; §4-D(a)(6) — 30-day nomination deadline prevents presidential delay *(v2 — S4)* |
| Election Court vacancy during election | §4-D(a) holdover + §4-C(e)(4) quorum emergency + §4-D(c) serial rejection anti-gaming — layered protections |
| Doom loop (deemed confirmation + 2/3 removal) | §4-D(f)(3) — safety valve suspended during obstruction finding period |
| Qualification-free rejection | §4-D(b)(4-5) — unreasoned rejection counts toward serial threshold; §4-D(b)(3) — cross-body certification with 21-day deadline and deemed-certified default *(v2 — C1; v3 — S5/S6)* |
| Clock reset via rejection | §4-D(c)(1-2) — shortened clock on consecutive rejections; §4-D(c)(2) self-contained deemed confirmation *(v2 — S1)*; §4-B(h)(i) covers withdrawal |
| Term-expiration vacancy | §4-D(a) — up to 1 year holdover with full authority; §4-D(a)(6) — 30-day nomination deadline *(v2 — S4)* |
| Rotating temporaries (no institutional continuity) | §4-D(a) holdover + §4-D(c) anti-gaming → permanent members maintained; temporaries are backup only |
| Voice vote evasion (evading regional accountability) | §4-D(d)(3) — recorded roll-call vote required; voice/division votes invalid for rejection of constitutional body nominees *(v2 — S2)* |
| Certification delay (new silent-veto via certifying body) | §4-D(b)(3) — 21-day deadline; failure to act → deemed certified; ARB as default certifier absent statutory designation *(v3 — S5/S6)* |
