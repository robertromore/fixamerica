# Regional Federal Constitution

## Regional Federalism Constitutional Text

*This document contains the Regional Federalism amendment package. It is designed as a **modular** constitutional framework that works in conjunction with companion national reforms.*

### Modular Architecture

This constitution includes:

- **Articles I-V**: Regional structure, allocation of powers, rights, legislative and executive branches
- **Article X**: Fiscal architecture
- **Article XII-XIII**: Secession/de-escalation and amendment process
- **Articles XIV-RF, XI-RF, XVII-RF**: Region-specific provisions for judiciary, armed forces, and emergency powers (these supplement companion national amendments)
- **Articles XVIII-XXII**: Supremacy, transition, non-state entities, implementation, definitions

**Companion National Amendments** (in `single-topic/`): The following articles are reserved for standalone national reforms that work with or without Regional Federalism:

- **Article VII**: Elections Reform Amendment (national popular vote, certification procedures)
- **Article VIII**: Impeachment Reform Amendment (procedures, standards)
- **Article IX**: Lobbying and Anti-Corruption Amendment (ethics, lobbying rules)
- **Article XI**: Military Civilian Control Amendment (two-key authorization, deployment limits)
- **Article XIV**: Judicial Reform Amendment (term limits, mandatory jurisdiction, appointment reform)
- **Article XV**: Federal Reserve Reform Amendment (independence, transparency)
- **Article XVI**: Cyber and Digital Defense Amendment (digital security framework)
- **Article XVII**: Emergency Powers Reform Amendment (categories, time limits, judicial review)

The RF-suffixed articles (XIV-RF, XI-RF, XVII-RF) contain **only** the region-specific provisions that supplement these national amendments.

## Preamble

We, the People of the United States, in order to preserve the Union, restore democratic legitimacy, secure liberty against concentration of power, and ensure that self-government remains possible in a large and diverse republic, do hereby amend the Constitution to establish a system of **Regional Federalism**.

This amendment package is adopted to:

- align governance with modern economic and social reality,
- reduce existential political conflict,
- prevent authoritarian consolidation,
- preserve national unity without coercive uniformity,
- and ensure that no single institution may dominate the constitutional order.

---

## ARTICLE I - REGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES

### Section 1. Establishment of Regions

The United States shall be composed of multiple **Regions**, each consisting of a grouping of States, established by this Constitution and alterable only by constitutional amendment or the boundary revision process specified herein.

Regions are permanent constitutional entities and are not administrative subdivisions of the federal government.

---

### Section 2. Legal Status

Regions possess inherent governing authority within their enumerated powers, derived from the People of the Region and recognized by this Constitution.

No Region is sovereign. Sovereignty resides in the People of the United States.

---

### Section 3. Regional Constitutions

Each Region shall adopt a republican constitution consistent with:

- this Constitution,
- federal rights floors,
- democratic process guarantees.

Regional constitutions shall provide for:

- universal suffrage,
- independent redistricting processes,
- proportionality and competitiveness standards for elections,
- explicit protection against domination by any single metropolitan area or rural bloc.

The structural form of Regional government (unicameral or bicameral legislature, electoral system) shall be determined by each Region, subject to the foregoing requirements.

---

### Section 4. Regional Boundary Revision

(a) Regional boundaries may be revised without full constitutional amendment through a process requiring:

- an Independent Boundary Review Commission to assess and recommend changes,
- approval by two-thirds of the legislature of each affected Region,
- approval by national popular referendum.

(b) The Commission shall be structured to ensure independence from partisan control, with members drawn from multiple appointing authorities and subject to disqualification for recent partisan activity.

(c) Congress shall establish by statute the criteria for boundary revision, Commission procedures, and referendum processes.

(d) No boundary revision may be proposed, voted upon, or take effect within one year before or six months after a federal presidential election.

(e) Implementation procedures are established by statute.

#### State Transfer Mechanism

(f) **Tiered Transfer Approval.** A State may transfer from one Region to another pursuant to the following procedures:

| Transfer Type | Threshold | Requirements |
|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Bilateral Agreement** | Supermajority (2/3) of both Regional legislatures + State referendum (55%) | Consent from all affected parties |
| **Unilateral Departure** | State referendum (60%) + ARB certification + 3-year waiting period | Higher bar for non-consensual departure |
| **Contested Transfer** | Supreme Court determination | Prevents hostage-taking by blocking Region |

(g) **Fundamental Misalignment Standard.** The ARB shall certify "Fundamental Misalignment" based on objective criteria. Certification is **automatic** if the State demonstrates any two of the following for two consecutive years:

(1) The State's primary economic trading partners are greater than sixty percent (60%) outside its current Region, as measured by interstate commerce data published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis; OR

(2) The State's labor market integration (cross-border commuting, migration) is greater than fifty percent (50%) with an adjacent Region, as measured by Census Bureau commuting data; OR

(3) The State's median voter policy preferences diverge from the Regional median by more than 1.5 standard deviations on three or more major policy domains, as measured by the biennial National Policy Preference Survey administered by the Federal Election Commission; OR

(4) The State shares a contiguous border with the destination Region and does not share a contiguous border with any other State in its current Region.

(h) **Waiting Period.** A State initiating Unilateral Departure shall complete a three (3) year waiting period during which:

(1) The State remains subject to all origin-Region obligations;

(2) The ARB shall verify continued Fundamental Misalignment at Year 2;

(3) The State may withdraw its transfer application at any time;

(4) Business investment decisions made during the waiting period shall not be subject to retroactive regulatory changes by either Region.

(i) **Policy Continuity Rule.** A transferring State shall remain subject to its former Region's regulatory and tax floors for a period of three (3) years following transfer, with floors declining by one-third (33%) annually toward the new Region's standards. During this period:

(1) Businesses may elect to be governed by either the origin Region's or destination Region's standards, provided they declare their election at the beginning of each fiscal year;

(2) This election does not affect individual rights protections, which remain subject to the higher floor;

(3) The destination Region may not impose requirements exceeding those of the origin Region during the transition period.

#### Anti-Region-Shopping Provisions

(j) **Anti-Arbitrage Certification.** No transfer shall be approved if the ARB determines, based on objective evidence, that arbitrage is the dominant purpose. Arbitrage shall be presumed if:

(1) The destination Region's effective corporate tax rate is more than five (5) percentage points lower than the origin Region's, AND the State cannot demonstrate Fundamental Misalignment under subsection (g); OR

(2) The destination Region's environmental compliance costs are more than thirty percent (30%) lower than the origin Region's, AND the State cannot demonstrate Fundamental Misalignment under subsection (g); OR

(3) The State government or its officials have publicly stated regulatory or tax avoidance as a primary motivation.

(k) **Burden of Proof.**

(1) Where the destination Region maintains lower floors in any domain enumerated in subsection (j), the transferring State bears the burden of demonstrating non-arbitrage purpose by a preponderance of evidence (not clear and convincing evidence).

(2) If the State establishes Fundamental Misalignment under subsection (g), the burden shifts to any objecting party to prove arbitrage as the dominant purpose by clear and convincing evidence.

(l) **Expedited ARB Review.** The ARB shall resolve transfer disputes within ninety (90) days of filing, not the general 180-day timeline. The ARB shall issue preliminary certification or denial within forty-five (45) days, with the remaining period for any appeals or supplemental submissions.

(m) **Regional Membership Permanence.** Once assigned, Regional membership is irrevocable until the next decennial review; selective coordination withdrawal does not exempt a State from Regional authority.

#### Regional Infrastructure Supremacy for Trans-State Projects

(n) **Superior Use Certification.** When a Regional Government determines that inter-state infrastructure (including but not limited to transportation corridors, energy transmission lines, pipelines, and communications networks) requires passage through State territory, the Regional Government may petition the ARB for "Superior Use Certification."

(o) **Certification Standard.** The ARB shall grant Superior Use Certification upon finding that:

- (1) the project serves a legitimate inter-state infrastructure purpose within Regional Domain authority;
- (2) the Regional Government has made good-faith efforts to negotiate voluntary easements with affected States;
- (3) the proposed route minimizes disruption to existing State land uses where feasible;
- (4) the Regional Government commits to fair market compensation for affected landowners.

(p) **Effect of Certification.** Upon Superior Use Certification:

- (1) State and local zoning, permitting, and land-use regulations may not be applied to block, delay, or impose conditions inconsistent with the certified project;
- (2) the Regional Government may exercise eminent domain authority for the certified corridor, subject to just compensation under the Fifth Amendment;
- (3) States retain authority over ancillary matters (environmental mitigation, construction timing, aesthetic requirements) that do not materially impede project completion.

(q) **Expedited Review.** ARB shall render Superior Use Certification decisions within ninety (90) days. Failure to render a decision shall constitute denial, appealable to the Supreme Court.

(r) **Anti-Abuse Limitation.** Superior Use Certification may not be used for projects whose primary purpose is intra-state, nor to circumvent legitimate State environmental protections unrelated to the inter-state function.

---

### Section 5. Inter-Regional Cooperation

(a) Two or more Regions may enter into agreements for cooperative action on any matter within their respective powers.

(b) Such agreements require no federal approval unless they:

- affect federal enumerated powers,
- create binding obligations on non-participating Regions,
- or conflict with federal law enacted pursuant to enumerated powers.

(c) Regions may establish joint institutions, shared programs, cooperative purchasing arrangements, and coordinated policy frameworks.

(d) Inter-Regional agreements shall specify:

- governance structure and decision-making procedures,
- cost-sharing and fiscal responsibilities,
- dispute resolution mechanisms,
- withdrawal procedures and transition provisions.

(e) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize Regions to jointly exercise powers reserved to the federal government or to create obligations binding on the United States.

#### Prohibition on Foreign Regulatory Integration

(f) **Federal Exclusivity over Foreign Relations.** The federal government's exclusive authority over "foreign affairs and treaties" under Article II, Section 1 includes exclusive authority over regulatory alignments, standards harmonization, and economic integration agreements with foreign sovereign entities.

(g) **Prohibited Regional Actions.** No Region or State may, without federal approval:

- (1) enter into "technical cooperation agreements," "regulatory memoranda," "standards harmonization agreements," or similar arrangements with foreign governments, foreign governmental agencies, or foreign-controlled entities;
- (2) adopt regulations specifically designed to align with foreign standards in a manner that creates incompatibility with other Regions or with federal policy;
- (3) participate in foreign-led regulatory bodies, standard-setting organizations, or trade blocs in an official governmental capacity;
- (4) commit to exclusive infrastructure interconnections with foreign systems (energy grids, transportation networks, communications systems) that would preclude domestic integration.

(h) **Functional Test for Foreign Integration.** A Regional regulatory action shall be deemed prohibited foreign integration if:

- (1) it creates regulatory compatibility with a foreign jurisdiction while creating incompatibility with other U.S. Regions;
- (2) it was adopted following consultation with foreign governmental entities without corresponding federal consultation;
- (3) it references or incorporates foreign standards that differ materially from federal or inter-Regional standards;
- (4) its practical effect is to orient the Region's economy toward foreign markets at the expense of domestic economic integration.

(i) **Permitted Activities.** This section does not prohibit:

- (1) private commercial transactions with foreign entities;
- (2) educational, cultural, or scientific exchanges;
- (3) adoption of international standards that are also adopted federally or by a majority of Regions;
- (4) border-region cooperation on matters of purely local concern (e.g., cross-border emergency services, local environmental issues) with adjacent foreign jurisdictions, provided such cooperation does not affect national policy;
- (5) participation in non-governmental international organizations.

(j) **Federal Approval Process.** A Region seeking to engage in activities that might otherwise be prohibited may petition the State Department for approval:

- (1) The State Department shall review the proposed activity for consistency with national foreign policy;
- (2) Approval may be granted with conditions ensuring national policy coherence;
- (3) Denial must be accompanied by written explanation and is subject to judicial review for abuse of discretion;
- (4) The State Department shall respond within ninety (90) days; failure to respond constitutes denial.

(k) **Enforcement.** Violations of this section shall result in:

- (1) federal preemption of the offending Regional regulation;
- (2) injunctive relief in federal court;
- (3) withholding of federal funds related to the subject matter of the violation;
- (4) personal liability for Regional officials who knowingly entered prohibited arrangements.

(l) **Geopolitical Fragmentation Finding.** If the State Department determines that a Region's cumulative regulatory actions constitute "Geopolitical Fragmentation"—defined as economic or regulatory integration with foreign powers that materially impairs national foreign policy coordination—the President may:

- (1) declare the finding and transmit it to Congress;
- (2) suspend the Region's authority to regulate in the affected domain pending Congressional action;
- (3) Congress shall hold hearings within sixty (60) days and may ratify, modify, or reject the suspension.

---

### Section 6. Right of Transit and Non-Blockade

(a) No Region may deny, obstruct, or unreasonably condition access to transportation, energy, or communication infrastructure connecting other Regions. All Regions have rights of transit through other Regions on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.

(b) Infrastructure fees shall be non-discriminatory, cost-based, and transparent.

(c) This section does not require Regions to build new infrastructure, only to maintain reasonable access to existing infrastructure connecting other Regions.

#### Infrastructure Closure Review

(d) **Emergency Shutdown Expedited Review.** When any Region declares an emergency shutdown, initiates unscheduled maintenance, or imposes capacity restrictions on inter-Regional infrastructure:

(1) The declaration shall automatically trigger an expedited review by the Allocation Review Board within seventy-two hours;

(2) The declaring Region bears the burden of demonstrating genuine safety necessity by clear and convincing evidence;

(3) Failure to demonstrate necessity results in mandatory reopening within forty-eight hours.

(e) **Genuine Safety Necessity Standard.** To satisfy the "genuine safety necessity" requirement:

(1) The Region must identify a specific, documented hazard;

(2) The closure must be proportionate to the hazard (full closure only if partial measures insufficient);

(3) The estimated repair timeline must be technically justified;

(4) Economic impact on affected Regions must be considered as a factor, though not dispositive.

(f) **Prolonged Closure Presumption.** Any infrastructure closure or restriction exceeding seven days creates a rebuttable presumption of unreasonableness:

(1) The Region must file detailed justification with the ARB every seven days;

(2) Each seven-day extension requires renewed demonstration of necessity;

(3) Failure to file creates automatic referral for federal operational assumption.

(g) **Cumulative Obstruction Assessment.** The ARB shall assess patterns of infrastructure restriction:

(1) Three or more closures affecting the same corridor within twelve months triggers cumulative review;

(2) "Rolling maintenance" schedules that cumulatively exceed thirty days annually create presumption of strategic obstruction;

(3) Pattern finding shifts burden to Region for all future closures.

(h) **Alternative Route Requirements.** During any closure or restriction:

(1) The Region shall provide functional alternative routing at equivalent or lower cost;

(2) Increased costs for alternative routing borne by the closing Region;

(3) Failure to provide alternatives constitutes per se violation.

(i) **Processing Time Standards.** For infrastructure subject to inspection, certification, or processing requirements:

(1) Processing times shall not exceed national median for comparable facilities;

(2) Deviation exceeding fifty percent from median creates presumption of obstruction;

(3) ARB may mandate processing timeline improvements.

(j) **Rate Regulation for Constrained Corridors.** Rates for transit through partially closed or capacity-restricted infrastructure:

(1) Shall not exceed rates in effect prior to the restriction;

(2) No "scarcity premium" or "congestion pricing" permitted during capacity emergencies;

(3) Any rate increase during restriction period is void.

(k) **Cost-Based Rate Requirement.** Infrastructure user fees shall be based solely on:

(1) Documented maintenance and operational costs;

(2) Capital recovery for improvements directly benefiting users;

(3) Reasonable administrative overhead not exceeding fifteen percent of direct costs.

(l) **Rate Dispute Freeze.** When a fee is challenged:

(1) The pre-dispute rate remains in effect until ARB resolution;

(2) No retroactive collection permitted for disputed amounts;

(3) Resolution within sixty days required.

#### Remedies and Enforcement

(m) **Full Damages for Unreasonable Restrictions.** When the ARB finds an infrastructure restriction was not supported by genuine safety necessity:

(1) Affected Regions and private parties may recover full economic damages;

(2) Damages include direct losses, consequential damages, and litigation costs;

(3) No sovereign immunity defense available for infrastructure violations.

(n) **Treble Damages for Bad Faith.** When the ARB finds a restriction was imposed in bad faith--for purposes of economic coercion rather than safety:

(1) Treble damages are mandatory;

(2) Regional officials responsible for the decision are personally liable;

(3) Pattern bad faith triggers federal operational assumption.

(o) **Federal Operational Assumption.** When a Region refuses to comply with ARB order to reopen or de-restrict infrastructure:

(1) Federal agencies may assume operational control;

(2) Federal operation continues until the Region demonstrates compliance;

(3) Costs of federal operation are charged to the non-compliant Region.

(p) **Repeat Offender Designation.** Regions found to have engaged in unreasonable infrastructure conditioning three or more times within ten years:

(1) Lose unilateral authority over inter-Regional infrastructure;

(2) All future maintenance, closures, and rate changes require ARB pre-approval;

(3) Designation continues for ten years or until the Region demonstrates reformed practices.

#### National Infrastructure Transparency System

(q) **National Infrastructure Transparency System Established.** The Department of Transportation, in coordination with the Department of Energy, the Independent Fiscal Council, and the Allocation Review Board, shall maintain a publicly accessible National Infrastructure Transparency System (NITS) containing:

(1) Real-time operational status of all inter-Regional transit corridors, energy transmission lines, and pipeline infrastructure;

(2) All emergency declarations, maintenance schedules, and capacity restrictions affecting inter-Regional infrastructure;

(3) Complete technical justifications for any closure, restriction, or capacity reduction;

(4) Historical data on infrastructure availability, maintenance frequency, and processing times by corridor and Region;

(5) All inter-Regional transit fee schedules with cost justification summaries;

(6) Fee challenge status, pending disputes, and resolution outcomes.

(r) **Mandatory Real-Time Disclosure.** When a Region declares an emergency shutdown, initiates maintenance, imposes capacity restrictions, or changes fee schedules:

(1) The Region shall upload complete technical or cost justification to NITS within four hours for emergencies, thirty days for fee changes;

(2) Justification must include specific hazard identification, engineering assessments, estimated duration, or audited cost documentation;

(3) Supporting data (inspection reports, sensor readings, engineering analyses, financial records) must be made publicly available;

(4) Updates shall be filed every twenty-four hours during ongoing closures.

(s) **No Classified Infrastructure Justifications.** Regions may not invoke national security, proprietary information, or any confidentiality doctrine to withhold infrastructure closure or fee justifications:

(1) All safety, maintenance, and cost justifications are inherently public information;

(2) If a closure involves genuinely classified federal security matters, only the federal government (not the Region) may invoke classification, and must assume operational responsibility for the closure;

(3) Regional invocation of "classified" or "proprietary" justification creates irrebuttable presumption of bad faith and triggers immediate federal review.

(t) **Public Accountability Metrics.** NITS shall publish monthly:

(1) "Infrastructure Reliability Scores" for each Region based on closure frequency, duration, and justification adequacy;

(2) "Fee Reasonableness Scores" for each Region comparing fees to cost-plus standards;

(3) Comparison of stated maintenance needs to industry benchmarks;

(4) Economic impact estimates of closures and fees on affected Regions;

(5) Identification of patterns suggesting strategic rather than safety-motivated closures;

(6) Historical fee trends and comparisons across Regions.

(u) **Cost-Plus Fee Ceiling.** Inter-Regional transit fees shall not exceed one hundred ten percent of documented costs:

(1) "Documented costs" means actual operating costs plus capital recovery plus reasonable administrative overhead;

(2) The IFC shall establish uniform accounting standards for cost calculation;

(3) Costs shall be audited annually and published in NITS.

(v) **Aggregate Fee Limitation.** The aggregate of all fees, charges, and assessments imposed on inter-Regional transit shall not exceed the one hundred ten percent cost-plus ceiling:

(1) Regions may not circumvent the ceiling through multiple fee categories;

(2) "Environmental," "climate adaptation," "safety," and "modernization" charges count toward the aggregate;

(3) The IFC shall monitor for fee multiplication strategies.

(w) **Summary Suspension Authority.** The ARB may summarily suspend fee collection when:

(1) Prima facie evidence suggests the fee exceeds the one hundred ten percent ceiling;

(2) Suspension remains in effect pending full review;

(3) The charging Region bears the burden of proving cost compliance;

(4) Failure to provide audited cost documentation creates rebuttable presumption of violation;

(5) The ARB may access Regional financial records for verification.

#### Anti-Retaliation

(x) **Non-Retaliation.** Regions may not:

(1) Increase fees in response to fee challenges by specific users;

(2) Impose selective enforcement of ancillary requirements against challengers;

(3) Delay processing of challengers' transit relative to non-challengers;

(4) Impose new requirements targeting entities that filed ARB complaints.

(y) **Challenger Protection.** Entities filing infrastructure or fee challenges:

(1) Shall have access to expedited ARB review;

(2) May recover attorney fees and costs if challenge is successful;

(3) Are protected from any adverse action by the challenged Region.

(z) **Whistleblower Provisions.** Regional employees who report infrastructure abuse:

(1) Are protected from termination, demotion, or adverse action;

(2) May file directly with ARB under seal;

(3) May receive a portion of any damages recovered.

#### Minimum Maintenance Standards for Inter-Regional Infrastructure

(aa) **Maintenance Obligation.** Every Region and State maintaining infrastructure that serves inter-Regional commerce or movement shall:

- (1) maintain such infrastructure in a condition that permits safe and efficient operation at designed capacity;
- (2) conduct regular inspections and preventive maintenance according to industry standards;
- (3) promptly repair deficiencies that impair safety or capacity;
- (4) maintain adequate funding reserves for foreseeable maintenance needs.

(bb) **Critical Inter-Regional Corridors.** The ARB, in consultation with the Department of Transportation and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, shall designate "Critical Inter-Regional Corridors" including:

- (1) interstate highways and bridges carrying more than 10,000 vehicles per day in inter-Regional traffic;
- (2) rail lines carrying more than 5 million tons of inter-Regional freight annually;
- (3) pipelines carrying petroleum, natural gas, or other essential commodities across Regional boundaries;
- (4) electrical transmission lines of 230 kV or greater serving inter-Regional load;
- (5) fiber-optic trunk lines and data centers serving inter-Regional communications.

(cc) **Maintenance Reporting.** Jurisdictions maintaining Critical Inter-Regional Corridors shall:

- (1) submit annual maintenance reports to the ARB detailing inspection results, repair activities, and funding allocations;
- (2) immediately report any condition that reduces capacity below 80% of design specification;
- (3) provide five-year maintenance plans demonstrating adequate funding for continued operation.

(dd) **Manufactured Safety Necessity Doctrine.** A jurisdiction may not invoke "Genuine Safety Necessity" under subsection (e) to close or restrict infrastructure if:

- (1) the safety condition resulted from the jurisdiction's failure to perform maintenance required by this section;
- (2) the jurisdiction failed to seek available federal or inter-Regional funding for maintenance;
- (3) the jurisdiction diverted maintenance funds to other purposes within the preceding five years;
- (4) a pattern of under-maintenance suggests strategic intent to create closure justifications.

(ee) **Burden of Proof for Decay-Based Closures.** When a jurisdiction invokes safety necessity for infrastructure that has received below-average maintenance funding relative to comparable facilities:

- (1) the burden shifts to the closing jurisdiction to prove the safety condition was not the result of deliberate or negligent under-maintenance;
- (2) the ARB may appoint an independent engineering assessment at the closing jurisdiction's expense;
- (3) findings of manufactured necessity shall trigger the treble damages and bad-faith penalties applicable to pretextual closures.

(ff) **Federal Maintenance Backstop.** If a jurisdiction fails to maintain Critical Inter-Regional Corridor infrastructure:

- (1) the ARB may order the jurisdiction to cure the maintenance deficiency within 180 days;
- (2) if not cured, the federal government may perform necessary maintenance and recover costs from the jurisdiction's federal transfer allocations;
- (3) persistent maintenance failures (three or more ARB orders within five years) shall result in mandatory federal assumption of maintenance responsibility, funded by withholding from the jurisdiction's highway and infrastructure allocations.

(gg) **Private Right of Action for Manufactured Decay.** Any person or entity suffering economic harm from infrastructure closure or restriction resulting from manufactured safety necessity may recover:

- (1) actual damages including business interruption, increased transportation costs, and consequential losses;
- (2) treble damages upon proof of deliberate under-maintenance;
- (3) attorney's fees and costs.

(hh) Implementation procedures are established by statute.

### Section 7. Water Rights and Shared Waterways

(a) Interstate rivers, lakes, aquifers, and watersheds that cross or border Regional boundaries are shared resources. Water allocation among Regions shall be governed by principles of equitable apportionment.

(b) No Region may unilaterally divert, dam, or appropriate water in a manner that substantially diminishes the quantity or quality of water available to other Regions, or discharge pollutants that render water unusable by other Regions.

(c) Existing interstate water compacts shall remain in force unless superseded by Regional agreement or federal law.

(d) Nothing in this section shall diminish treaty obligations to Tribal Nations regarding water rights or authorize taking of water rights without just compensation.

(e) **Water Resources Coordination Board.** There is hereby established a Water Resources Coordination Board consisting of:

- one representative appointed by each Region,
- one representative of the Environmental Protection Agency,
- one representative of the Army Corps of Engineers,
- two representatives of Tribal Nations with water rights in affected watersheds (selected by a council of affected Tribes).

The Board shall coordinate water allocation, establish monitoring standards, and facilitate dispute resolution through mediation before adjudication.

(f) **National Water Court.** There is hereby established a National Water Court with exclusive original jurisdiction over interstate water disputes. The Court shall consist of five judges appointed by the President with Senate confirmation for twelve-year non-renewable terms, drawn from persons with expertise in water law, hydrology, or environmental science. At least two judges shall have experience representing Western states with prior appropriation systems, and at least two shall have experience representing Eastern states with riparian rights systems. The Court's decisions may be appealed to the Supreme Court on questions of constitutional interpretation.

(g) Implementation procedures are established by statute.

---

### Section 8. Freedom of Movement

(a) All citizens of the United States shall have the right to:

- travel freely between and within Regions,
- establish residence in any Region,
- seek employment in any Region,
- access public services on equal terms with residents after establishing residence.

(b) No Region may:

- impose border controls, checkpoints, or travel documentation requirements for movement between Regions,
- require waiting periods exceeding ninety days for access to public services for new residents (excluding residency requirements for voting, which shall not exceed thirty days),
- discriminate in employment, housing, or public accommodations based on Region of origin,
- condition professional licensure or credentialing on Region of prior residence.

(c) Durational residency requirements are permissible only for:

- voting registration (not exceeding thirty days),
- in-state tuition eligibility at public institutions (not exceeding twelve months),
- candidacy for elected office (as established by statute, not exceeding the term length of the office sought).

(d) This section shall not be construed to:

- require Regions to subsidize relocation,
- prevent reasonable transition periods for benefit eligibility where portability is ensured,
- override legitimate public health quarantine measures during declared emergencies.

(e) A person whose freedom of movement has been impaired may seek injunctive relief in any Regional court, with expedited review (seven days).

#### Migration Surge Stabilization

(f) **Migration Surge Defined.** A "Migration Surge" occurs when a Region experiences net in-migration exceeding three percent (3%) of its population within any twelve-month period, as certified by the Census Bureau.

(g) **Surge Early Warning.** The Census Bureau shall:

- (1) monitor inter-Regional migration patterns quarterly;
- (2) issue "Surge Warnings" when a Region's net in-migration rate exceeds two percent (2%) annually;
- (3) provide detailed demographic and geographic data to affected Regions and the IFC.

(h) **Automatic Fiscal Stabilization.** Upon certification of a Migration Surge:

- (1) the affected Region shall receive emergency equalization transfers within thirty (30) days, calculated based on projected service costs for the incoming population;
- (2) transfers shall be funded from the Asymmetric Shock Stabilization Fund under Article X, Section 9;
- (3) the IFC shall adjust permanent equalization formulas within one (1) year to reflect the new population baseline.

(i) **Service Capacity Assistance.** The federal government shall provide:

- (1) emergency infrastructure grants for healthcare, education, and housing capacity expansion;
- (2) technical assistance for rapid service scaling;
- (3) temporary federal personnel to supplement Regional administrative capacity.

(j) **Anti-Degradation Mandate.** No Region may:

- (1) intentionally maintain services below the Region's fiscal capacity for the purpose of deterring in-migration;
- (2) impose waiting periods for service access exceeding those permitted under this section;
- (3) discriminate in service provision based on duration of residency beyond constitutionally permitted periods;
- (4) adopt "defensive degradation" strategies designed to make the Region less attractive to migrants.

(k) **Degradation Finding.** If the IFC determines that a Region is engaged in "Defensive Service Degradation":

- (1) the finding shall be published and transmitted to Congress;
- (2) the Region shall be ineligible for discretionary federal grants until the finding is reversed;
- (3) affected residents may bring civil rights claims for denial of services.

(l) **Origin Region Contribution.** When a Migration Surge results primarily from policy failures or service deficiencies in an origin Region:

- (1) the IFC may require the origin Region to contribute to surge stabilization costs;
- (2) contribution shall be proportional to the origin Region's share of the migrating population;
- (3) this provision creates incentives for all Regions to maintain adequate service levels.

(m) **Surge Stabilization Fund.** There is established within the Treasury a Migration Surge Stabilization Fund:

- (1) funded by annual appropriations of 0.1% of federal revenue;
- (2) accumulating during non-surge periods to ensure availability during surges;
- (3) administered by the IFC with expedited disbursement authority.

(n) **Preservation of Freedom of Movement.** Nothing in this section authorizes any restriction on the constitutional right of citizens to travel freely and establish residence in any Region. This section provides fiscal stabilization mechanisms only.

---

### Section 9. Mutual Recognition

(a) Full Faith and Credit. Each jurisdiction shall give full faith and credit to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other jurisdiction.

(b) Legal Status Recognition. Marriages, divorces, adoptions, name changes, powers of attorney, corporate registrations, and property titles established under any jurisdiction's law shall be recognized in all other jurisdictions.

(c) Professional Credentials. Professional licenses shall be recognized for practice in all jurisdictions, subject only to registration, reasonable fees, and verification of good standing. Supplementary requirements may be imposed only where the receiving jurisdiction's standards demonstrably exceed those of the issuing jurisdiction.

(d) Academic Credentials. Educational degrees from accredited institutions shall be recognized throughout the United States.

(e) No jurisdiction may refuse recognition based on religious or moral objection, political disagreement, economic protectionism, or retaliation.

(f) Implementation procedures are established by statute.

#### Rebuttable Presumption of Competency

(g) **Presumption of Competency.** A credential validly issued by any Region creates a rebuttable presumption of competency to practice in all Regions:

(1) The receiving Region bears the burden of demonstrating that supplementary requirements are necessary;

(2) The standard for supplementary requirements is "Essential for Public Safety" (not merely "demonstrably exceed");

(3) Convenience, preference, or economic protection do not constitute public safety necessity.

(h) **Essential for Public Safety Standard.** A supplementary requirement is "Essential for Public Safety" only if:

(1) It addresses a specific, documented risk to public health, safety, or welfare;

(2) The risk is unique to the receiving Region and not adequately addressed by the issuing Region's standards;

(3) The requirement is narrowly tailored to address only that specific risk;

(4) Less restrictive alternatives are inadequate.

(i) **Prohibited Justifications.** The following do not constitute public safety necessity:

(1) General assertions that Regional standards are "higher" or "more rigorous";

(2) Economic impact on existing Regional practitioners;

(3) Differences in educational institution accreditation;

(4) Requirements for Region-specific knowledge not directly related to professional competency.

#### ARB Pre-Approval for Supplementary Requirements

(j) **ARB Certification Required.** Before imposing any supplementary credential requirement on out-of-Region professionals, a Region must:

(1) Submit the proposed requirement to the Allocation Review Board;

(2) Demonstrate that the requirement meets the "Essential for Public Safety" standard;

(3) Receive ARB certification within ninety (90) days.

(1) The supplementary requirement is deemed not certified;

(2) The out-of-Region credential must be recognized without supplement;

(3) The Region may resubmit with additional justification.

(l) **Grandfathering.** Supplementary requirements in effect at ratification:

(1) Remain valid for two (2) years;

(2) Must be submitted for ARB certification within one (1) year;

(3) Uncertified requirements become void after the two-year transition period.

#### Anti-Protectionism Provisions

(m) **Facially Neutral Discrimination.** A credential requirement that is facially neutral but has disparate impact on out-of-Region professionals:

(1) Is subject to strict scrutiny;

(2) Must be justified by compelling public safety interest;

(3) Creates rebuttable presumption of protectionist intent if adopted within twenty-four (24) months of significant credential migration.

(n) **Prohibited Practices.** Regions may not:

(1) Require continuing education obtainable only within the Region;

(2) Impose "cultural competency" or "regional knowledge" requirements beyond those directly necessary for professional practice;

(3) Condition reciprocity on political, economic, or policy concessions;

(4) Revoke reciprocity for reasons unrelated to credential standards.

(o) **Expedited Judicial Review.** Professionals denied credential recognition may:

(1) Appeal directly to the National Constitutional Court;

(2) Receive expedited ruling within sixty (60) days;

(3) Practice under provisional recognition pending appeal if they demonstrate valid out-of-Region credential.

### Section 10. Data Sovereignty and Critical Governance Data

#### Critical Governance Data Classification

(a) **Critical Governance Data Defined.** The following categories constitute "Critical Governance Data" subject to this section:

(1) **Electoral Data:** Voter registration, election results, redistricting data, campaign finance records;

(2) **Fiscal Data:** Tax assessments, collections, expenditures, and audit records at all levels;

(3) **Infrastructure Data:** Energy grid telemetry, water system monitoring, transportation network status, communications infrastructure;

(4) **Identity Data:** Citizenship records, vital statistics (birth, death, marriage), professional licensing;

(5) **Public Safety Data:** Law enforcement records, emergency response data, public health surveillance.

(b) **Shared Constitutional Utility.** Critical Governance Data is hereby declared a "Shared Constitutional Utility":

(1) No single level of government has exclusive ownership;

(2) All levels with constitutional functions requiring the data have access rights;

(3) The physical location of servers or infrastructure does not determine ownership or control.

(c) **Interoperability Mandate.** All Critical Governance Data systems shall:

(1) Use standardized formats enabling cross-level access;

(2) Maintain real-time or near-real-time synchronization where technically feasible;

(3) Provide API access to authorized government entities at all levels.

(d) **IFC Data Standards Authority.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall establish and maintain:

(1) Technical standards for Critical Governance Data interoperability;

(2) Security protocols for data access and transmission;

(3) Audit procedures for data integrity verification.

#### Prohibition on Digital Blockade

(e) **Prohibition on Data Denial.** No Federal, Regional, or State government may:

(1) Deny, restrict, or condition another level's access to Critical Governance Data necessary for that level's constitutional functions;

(2) Encrypt, silo, or technically obstruct access to shared data systems;

(3) Require approval, licensing, or payment for access to data necessary for constitutional functions;

(4) Provide data in formats designed to impede practical use.

(f) **Constitutional Function Nexus.** Access rights attach when:

(1) The requesting level has an enumerated constitutional power;

(2) Exercise of that power requires the specific data requested;

(3) The nexus between data and function is not pretextual.

(g) **Presumption of Access.** Requests for Critical Governance Data:

(1) Are presumptively valid when made by an authorized government entity;

(2) Must be fulfilled within seventy-two hours absent legitimate technical constraints;

(3) May be denied only upon specific, written justification subject to ARB review.

(h) **Technical Obstruction as Violation.** Providing data in deliberately unusable formats, imposing unreasonable technical requirements, or maintaining "legacy systems" that prevent interoperability without documented modernization plans:

(1) Constitutes constructive denial;

(2) Is subject to the same penalties as outright refusal;

(3) Creates rebuttable presumption of bad faith if the obstructing level has opposed the requesting level's exercise of constitutional authority.

#### Data Integrity and Reconciliation

(i) **Single Source of Truth.** For each category of Critical Governance Data, the IFC shall designate:

(1) A "Primary Custodian" responsible for maintaining the authoritative record;

(2) Reconciliation procedures when multiple sources conflict;

(3) Appeals process for disputed data.

(j) **Primary Custodian Assignment.**

(1) **Electoral Data:** State governments, subject to Federal and Regional audit rights;

(2) **Citizenship/Identity Data:** Federal government;

(3) **Infrastructure Data:** Level operating the infrastructure, subject to oversight access by regulators;

(4) **Tax Data:** Collecting level, with mandatory sharing to other levels with tax authority over same base.

(k) **Mandatory Reconciliation.** When data from different levels conflicts:

(1) The levels shall conduct reconciliation within thirty days;

(2) If reconciliation fails, the IFC shall determine the authoritative record;

(3) Levels refusing to participate in reconciliation forfeit their position in any dispute.

(l) **Audit Rights.** Any level of government may:

(1) Audit Critical Governance Data maintained by another level for accuracy;

(2) Request independent verification by the IFC;

(3) Publish audit findings (excluding personally identifiable information).

#### Privacy and Security Protections

(m) **Privacy Preservation.** Data access under this section:

(1) Is limited to data necessary for constitutional functions;

(2) Does not authorize disclosure to private parties without independent legal authority;

(3) Requires compliance with applicable privacy laws and the National Rights Floor;

(4) Prohibits use of accessed data for purposes beyond the stated constitutional function.

(n) **Security Requirements.** All Critical Governance Data systems shall:

(1) Meet cybersecurity standards established by the IFC in consultation with federal cybersecurity agencies;

(2) Maintain access logs subject to audit;

(3) Implement role-based access controls limiting data exposure to authorized personnel.

(o) **Breach Notification.** Any breach of Critical Governance Data:

(1) Must be reported to all affected levels within twenty-four hours;

(2) Must be reported to the public within seventy-two hours;

(3) Triggers mandatory security review by the IFC.

(p) **No Privacy Shield for Obstruction.** Privacy concerns may not be invoked to:

(1) Deny government-to-government data sharing for constitutional functions;

(2) Justify encryption or access controls that exclude other government levels;

(3) The privacy of individuals is protected by limiting downstream use, not by blocking intergovernmental access.

#### Enforcement and Remedies

(q) **Digital Blockade as Constitutional Violation.** Denial of Critical Governance Data access:

(1) Constitutes a violation of this Constitution equivalent to physical obstruction of federal officers;

(2) May be enjoined by the National Constitutional Court;

(3) Officials responsible for denial are personally liable and may be removed from office.

(r) **Emergency Access Orders.** If a level claims urgent need for data access:

(1) The ARB may issue an Emergency Access Order within twenty-four hours;

(2) The order requires immediate compliance pending full adjudication;

(3) Failure to comply with an Emergency Access Order constitutes contempt.

(s) **Federal Data Backup Authority.** If a State or Region persistently denies data access:

(1) The Federal government may establish parallel data collection systems;

(2) The obstructing level bears the cost of duplicate systems;

(3) Federal data becomes authoritative for federal functions regardless of State/Regional objection.

(t) **Integration with Infrastructure Protections.** Data and telemetry shall be treated as "transit-protected assets" under Section 6:

(1) Digital blockade is subject to the same review and penalties as physical infrastructure obstruction;

(2) The National Infrastructure Transparency System shall include data system availability;

(3) "Data Reliability Scores" shall be published alongside infrastructure reliability scores.

(u) **Specialized Data Access Provisions.** Nothing in this section limits:

(1) Federal Data Supremacy for rights enforcement under Article II, Section 1;

(2) Forensic audit authority under Article X, Section 3;

(3) Algorithmic transparency requirements established by statute pursuant to this section;

(4) Transition data requirements under the Transition Framework.

(v) **Hierarchy of Access.** When specialized provisions conflict with general provisions:

(1) Rights enforcement access takes precedence for individual rights data;

(2) Forensic audit authority takes precedence for fiscal data;

(3) General provisions of this section apply as default for all other data categories.

(w) **Privacy Reconciliation.** The privacy protections of subsection (m) are reconciled with specialized access as follows:

(1) Minimization requirements of subsection (m) apply to all specialized access;

(2) Use restrictions of subsection (m)(4) apply regardless of access authority;

(3) Specialized provisions may expand access scope but not diminish privacy safeguards.

#### Neutral Use Mandate and Anti-Profiling Protections

(w-1) **Neutral Use Mandate.** Critical Governance Data accessed under this section shall be used only for neutral, non-partisan governmental functions:

- (1) No jurisdiction may use shared data to target, profile, or disadvantage residents based on political affiliation, voting history, Region of origin, or ideological beliefs;
- (2) No jurisdiction may use shared data to influence election outcomes, voter turnout, or political participation in other jurisdictions;
- (3) No jurisdiction may use shared data to identify or target political opponents, activists, journalists, or members of disfavored groups.

(w-2) **Prohibited Uses.** The following uses of Critical Governance Data are absolutely prohibited:

- (1) constructing political profiles of individuals or demographic groups;
- (2) predictive modeling of voting behavior or political activity;
- (3) selective enforcement of laws or regulations based on political characteristics;
- (4) sharing data with political campaigns, parties, or partisan organizations;
- (5) using Electoral Data for any purpose other than election administration;
- (6) using Public Safety Data to monitor lawful political activity.

(w-3) **Enhanced Protections for Sensitive Categories.** The following data categories require additional safeguards:

- (1) **Electoral Data:** Access limited to election administration purposes; no cross-referencing with law enforcement data except for specific voter fraud investigations with judicial authorization;
- (2) **Public Safety Data:** No access for immigration enforcement purposes; no sharing with federal agencies for political surveillance;
- (3) **Identity Data:** No use for tracking inter-Regional migration patterns for political purposes.

(w-4) **Data Use Audits.** Each jurisdiction accessing Critical Governance Data shall:

- (1) maintain detailed logs of all data queries, including purpose, requestor, and data accessed;
- (2) submit to annual audits by the Federal Data Coordination Agency for compliance with this section;
- (3) publish anonymized summaries of data access patterns.

(w-5) **Enforcement and Penalties.** Violations of this section shall result in:

- (1) immediate termination of data access privileges for the violating jurisdiction;
- (2) civil penalties of up to $1,000,000 per violation;
- (3) personal liability for officials who authorized or conducted prohibited uses;
- (4) criminal referral for willful violations constituting civil rights violations.

(w-6) **Private Right of Action.** Any individual who is targeted, profiled, or disadvantaged through prohibited use of Critical Governance Data may:

- (1) bring a civil action against the responsible jurisdiction and officials;
- (2) recover actual damages, statutory damages of $10,000 per violation, and attorney fees;
- (3) obtain injunctive relief including data deletion and access termination.

(x) **Federal Data Coordination Agency.** There is hereby established a Federal Data Coordination Agency with the following responsibilities:

(1) **Technical Standards Development.** The Agency shall develop and maintain binding technical standards for Critical Governance Data interoperability, including:

- (i) data format specifications and schema requirements;
- (ii) API protocols and authentication standards;
- (iii) encryption and security requirements;
- (iv) synchronization frequency and latency requirements by data category.

(2) **Legacy System Transition.** The Agency shall:

- (i) inventory all existing government data systems within two years of ratification;
- (ii) establish a ten-year transition timeline for legacy system compliance;
- (iii) provide technical assistance and funding to jurisdictions for system modernization;
- (iv) grant compliance extensions for demonstrated hardship, not to exceed five additional years.

(3) **Security Coordination.** The Agency shall maintain a unified security operations center for Critical Governance Data that:

- (i) monitors for unauthorized access attempts across all jurisdictions;
- (ii) coordinates incident response for data breaches affecting multiple jurisdictions;
- (iii) conducts annual security audits of all connected systems;
- (iv) maintains backup and disaster recovery capabilities for Critical Governance Data.

(4) **Composition.** The Agency shall be governed by a board consisting of:

- (i) one representative appointed by each Regional Governor;
- (ii) two representatives appointed by the President;
- (iii) one representative appointed by the Chief Justice;
- (iv) one non-voting technical advisor selected by the board from the private sector.

(5) **Funding.** The Agency shall be funded through mandatory appropriations not subject to annual discretion, apportioned among the federal government and Regions based on data system usage.

(y) **Liability for Interoperability Failures.** A jurisdiction that fails to maintain interoperability as required by this section and thereby causes demonstrable harm to another jurisdiction's constitutional functions shall be liable for:

(1) actual damages incurred by the affected jurisdiction;

(2) costs of alternative data access arrangements;

(3) civil penalties not to exceed $100,000 per day of non-compliance following notice and a ninety-day cure period.

(z) **Data Hygiene and Quality Certification.**

(1) **Annual Data Quality Audit.** Each jurisdiction maintaining Critical Governance Data shall undergo an annual data quality audit by the Federal Data Coordination Agency assessing:

- (i) accuracy rates (percentage of records verified against source documents);
- (ii) synchronization latency (time between source updates and API availability);
- (iii) completeness (percentage of required fields populated);
- (iv) system stability (uptime and error rates).

(2) **Certification Grades.** The Agency shall assign each jurisdiction a Data Quality Grade:

- (i) Grade A: Meets all standards; full data sharing privileges;
- (ii) Grade B: Minor deficiencies; must submit remediation plan within 90 days;
- (iii) Grade C: Significant deficiencies; data access restricted to read-only by other jurisdictions until remediation;
- (iv) Grade F: Critical failures; data deemed unreliable and may not be used for constitutional functions until remediation verified.

(3) **Phantom Data Prohibition.** Jurisdictions may not represent data as current or accurate when:

- (i) source systems have not been updated within required synchronization windows;
- (ii) known data quality issues have not been disclosed;
- (iii) legacy system limitations prevent verification.

(4) **Consequences for Persistent Failure.** A jurisdiction receiving Grade C or below for three consecutive years:

- (i) shall have data system operations placed under Federal Data Coordination Agency supervision;
- (ii) shall receive mandatory technical assistance funded by federal appropriation;
- (iii) may not cite data system limitations as a defense in any proceeding requiring that data.

#### Conceptual Uniformity and Semantic Integrity

(5) **Standardized Federal Definitions (SFD).** To prevent "Epistemic Sabotage"—the manipulation of internal legal definitions to game federal formulas—the Independent Fiscal Council (IFC) and the Federal Data Coordination Agency (FDCA) shall maintain a "Compendium of Standardized Federal Definitions" for all terms used in constitutional formulas, including but not limited to:

- (i) "Poverty Level" and "Fiscal Capacity";
- (ii) "Unemployment" and "Labor Force Participation";
- (iii) "Infrastructure Health" and "Deferred Maintenance";
- (iv) "Educational Outcome" and "Service Adequacy";
- (v) any other term whose measurement affects equalization transfers, fiscal allocations, or constitutional thresholds.

(6) **Anti-Semantic Fraud Rule.** No Region or State may use idiosyncratic or "shadow" definitions of constitutional terms in their reports to the FDCA or IFC:

- (i) Any data submission using non-standard definitions shall be assigned a "Grade F" for Data Quality regardless of technical accuracy;
- (ii) If a Region changes an internal definition in a way that results in a greater than five percent (5%) change in their Equalization Transfer eligibility, the change is presumptively fraudulent and shall be stayed pending a "Semantic Audit";
- (iii) Regions found to have engaged in deliberate semantic manipulation shall forfeit the excess transfers received plus a twenty percent (20%) penalty.

(7) **Definition Change Notification.** Any Region intending to modify an internal definition that affects constitutional formula inputs shall:

- (i) notify the IFC at least ninety (90) days before the change takes effect;
- (ii) provide detailed justification for the definitional change;
- (iii) await IFC pre-certification that the change is "Semantically Neutral" or accept flagging for Semantic Audit before implementation;
- (iv) failure to provide advance notification creates an irrebuttable presumption of bad faith.

(8) **Semantic Audit Authority.** The IFC shall have the power to "pierce the definition" of any Regional data point to ensure it reflects the underlying economic or social reality, regardless of the label used by the Region:

- (i) Semantic Audits may be triggered by the five percent threshold, inter-Regional complaint, or IFC initiative;
- (ii) The audit shall compare Regional definitions to federal standards and assess whether deviations materially affect formula outcomes;
- (iii) Audit findings are binding and may require restatement of prior submissions.

(9) **Transparency of Conceptual Logic.** The Plain-Language Explanations required under Article VI, Section 7-A must explicitly state the conceptual logic used to categorize data:

- (i) "Black-box" categorizations where the meaning of the input is hidden by the algorithm are prohibited;
- (ii) All definitional assumptions must be disclosed and subject to challenge;
- (iii) The IFC shall publish an annual "Semantic Integrity Report" identifying any Regions whose definitions deviate materially from federal standards.

#### Digital Portability and Privacy Harmonization

(aa) **Prohibition on Data-Localization Barriers.** No Region may enact data residency, data localization, or data sovereignty requirements that:

- (1) require physical storage of data exclusively within Regional boundaries as a condition of doing business;
- (2) prohibit the transfer of data to other Regions for legitimate business operations;
- (3) create compliance obligations that are mutually exclusive with the data regulations of other Regions.

(bb) **Federal Privacy Floor.** Congress shall establish, within three years of ratification, a Federal Digital Privacy Floor providing:

- (1) minimum data protection standards applicable in all Regions;
- (2) mutual recognition of Regional privacy certifications meeting or exceeding the Floor;
- (3) a single point of compliance for multi-Regional enterprises.

(cc) **Privacy Portability Certification.** The Federal Data Coordination Agency shall maintain a "Privacy Portability Certification" process whereby:

- (1) Regional privacy regimes that meet the Federal Floor are deemed mutually compatible;
- (2) enterprises certified under any Floor-compliant Regional regime may operate in all Regions without additional privacy compliance burdens;
- (3) Regions may exceed the Floor for intra-Regional operations but may not impose above-Floor requirements on inter-Regional data flows.

(dd) **Conflict Resolution.** When Regional data regulations conflict:

- (1) the ARB shall determine which Regional requirement governs for inter-Regional transactions;
- (2) the default rule shall be that the data subject's Region of residence governs privacy rights, while the enterprise's Region of principal operation governs operational requirements;
- (3) Regions may not apply their regulations extraterritorially to data transactions with no substantial nexus to the Region.

(ee) **Anti-Fragmentation Review.** Every five years, the Federal Data Coordination Agency shall report to Congress on whether Regional data regulations are creating "Digital Regulatory Walls" that impede the Common Market. If fragmentation is found, Congress may establish additional harmonization requirements by ordinary legislation.

#### Tax Residency and Economic Nexus

(ff) **Primary Tax Residency Determination.** For purposes of individual income taxation, a natural person's primary tax residency shall be the Region where the person maintains their principal place of abode, determined by:

- (1) physical presence exceeding one hundred eighty-three days in a calendar year; or
- (2) if no single Region meets the physical presence test, the Region where the person maintains their primary dwelling, family residence, voter registration, and principal community ties.

(gg) **Prohibition on Tax Residency Arbitrage.** No person may claim tax residency in a Region other than their primary tax residency Region for the purpose of avoiding income tax obligations. Specifically:

- (1) "digital residency," "e-residency," or similar status shall not constitute tax residency unless accompanied by genuine physical presence meeting the standards of subsection (ff);
- (2) no Region may offer tax residency status to individuals who do not meet the physical presence or primary dwelling requirements;
- (3) shell residencies, nominal addresses, or residency-for-purchase arrangements shall be void for tax purposes.

(hh) **Economic Nexus for Services.** A person who is tax-resident in one Region but performs substantial remote work for employers or clients located in another Region shall:

- (1) owe income tax to their Region of tax residency on all income;
- (2) be entitled to a credit against their home Region tax for any withholding or income tax paid to the work-source Region, up to the amount of home Region tax on that income; and
- (3) not be subject to double taxation through cumulative Regional income taxes exceeding the higher of the two Regions' rates.

(ii) **Apportionment for Multi-Regional Activity.** The Inter-Regional Fiscal Court shall promulgate uniform rules for apportioning income among Regions when an individual:

- (1) maintains genuine residences in multiple Regions;
- (2) earns income from sources in multiple Regions; or
- (3) operates a business with substantial activities in multiple Regions.
These rules shall prevent both double taxation and tax avoidance through artificial arrangements.

(jj) **Regional Benefit Arbitrage.** No person may claim public benefits, subsidies, or services from a Region in which they are not tax-resident except:

- (1) emergency services available to all persons regardless of residency;
- (2) services explicitly extended to non-residents by Regional law;
- (3) reciprocal services under inter-Regional compacts; or
- (4) services for which the non-resident pays full cost.
A Region may require proof of tax residency as a condition of receiving resident-only benefits.

### Section 11. Environmental Border Protection

(a) No jurisdiction may externalize environmental harms to other jurisdictions through pollution siting, emissions, discharges, hazardous waste disposal, or land use practices that cause transboundary harm.

(b) Affected jurisdictions may seek injunctive relief, compensatory damages, and remediation orders. The Environmental Protection Agency shall maintain monitoring capacity and enforcement authority.

(c) This section supplements federal environmental laws establishing national minimum standards. Jurisdictions may establish more protective standards provided they do not discriminate against interstate commerce.

(d) Implementation procedures are established by statute.

#### Cumulative Harm and Shared Ecosystem Protection

(e) **Cumulative Impact Standard.** In addition to bilateral harm under subsection (a), no combination of jurisdictions may collectively cause cumulative environmental harm to shared ecosystems, even if each jurisdiction's individual contribution would be lawful in isolation.

(f) **Shared Ecosystem Designation.** The Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the Water Resources Coordination Board, shall designate "Shared Ecosystems" including but not limited to:

- (1) major river systems and their watersheds (Mississippi, Colorado, Columbia, etc.);
- (2) shared airsheds crossing Regional boundaries;
- (3) migratory wildlife corridors;
- (4) coastal zones and estuaries receiving multi-Regional drainage;
- (5) aquifers underlying multiple Regions.

(g) **Aggregate Impact Limits.** For each Shared Ecosystem, the EPA shall establish:

- (1) science-based "Ecosystem Carrying Capacity" limits for pollutants, withdrawals, and other stressors;
- (2) allocation formulas apportioning the carrying capacity among contributing jurisdictions;
- (3) monitoring protocols to track cumulative impacts in real time.

(h) **Proportional Liability.** When cumulative harm exceeds Ecosystem Carrying Capacity:

- (1) each contributing jurisdiction shall be jointly and severally liable for remediation costs;
- (2) liability shall be apportioned based on each jurisdiction's share of the cumulative impact;
- (3) jurisdictions exceeding their allocated share bear enhanced liability;
- (4) jurisdictions operating below their allocated share may recover contribution from over-polluters.

(i) **Mandatory Remediation Fund.** All jurisdictions contributing to a Shared Ecosystem shall participate in a Shared Ecosystem Remediation Fund:

- (1) contributions shall be proportional to each jurisdiction's use of ecosystem carrying capacity;
- (2) the Fund shall finance remediation when cumulative harm occurs;
- (3) jurisdictions that fail to contribute shall have federal transfers reduced by the unpaid amount plus twenty percent penalty.

(j) **Preemptive Intervention.** When monitoring indicates that a Shared Ecosystem is approaching eighty percent of its Carrying Capacity:

- (1) the EPA shall convene affected jurisdictions for mandatory planning;
- (2) jurisdictions shall submit reduction plans within ninety days;
- (3) failure to submit or implement plans authorizes EPA to impose allocations directly.

---

### Section 12. Cross-Jurisdictional Law Enforcement Cooperation

(a) Jurisdictions shall cooperate in criminal law enforcement through extradition, hot pursuit, and mutual legal assistance.

(b) Extradition shall be mandatory for serious crimes including violence, harm to minors, fraud, and public corruption. A jurisdiction may decline extradition only where the requesting jurisdiction seeks sentences violating federal rights floors or where the person faces persecution unrelated to the alleged crime.

(c) No jurisdiction may adopt policies designed to shield individuals from lawful prosecution for crimes of violence, fraud, or harm to minors.

(d) Nothing in this section shall require cooperation in enforcement of laws violating federal rights floors, participation in pretextual or politically motivated actions, or diminishment of Tribal sovereignty over criminal matters.

(e) Implementation procedures are established by statute.

#### Transboundary Legal Comity

(f) **Prohibition on Non-Cooperation Acts.** No Region or State may enact legislation, executive orders, or policies that:

- (1) prohibit Regional or State officials from cooperating with lawful legal process from other jurisdictions;
- (2) create "sanctuary" status shielding individuals or entities from civil or regulatory enforcement by other Regions;
- (3) refuse recognition of judgments, orders, or legal proceedings from other Regions except as provided in subsection (b).

(g) **Civil Judgment Enforcement.** Civil judgments validly entered by courts of one Region shall be enforceable in all other Regions:

- (1) The enforcing Region may not reexamine the merits of the underlying dispute;
- (2) Enforcement may be denied only if the rendering court lacked jurisdiction or the judgment was obtained by fraud;
- (3) A Region may not refuse enforcement based on disagreement with the substantive law applied.

(h) **Regulatory Cooperation Floor.** Regions shall maintain minimum cooperation in regulatory enforcement:

- (1) Subpoenas and document requests from other Regions' regulatory agencies shall be honored within thirty (30) days;
- (2) Witness testimony may be compelled for proceedings in other Regions pursuant to uniform interstate procedures;
- (3) Regulatory cease-and-desist orders shall be given interim recognition pending judicial review.

(i) **Anti-Evasion Provision.** No person or entity may escape civil or regulatory liability by relocating to another Region:

- (1) Liability that accrued in the originating Region remains enforceable regardless of subsequent relocation;
- (2) A Region may not offer "liability haven" status to attract businesses fleeing enforcement in other Regions;
- (3) Patterns of evasion-motivated relocation may be considered evidence of bad faith in subsequent proceedings.

(j) **Limitations on Non-Cooperation.** Notwithstanding subsection (f), a Region may decline cooperation when:

- (1) the requesting Region's law or enforcement action violates Federal Rights Floors;
- (2) cooperation would require violation of the non-cooperating Region's own constitutional protections that exceed federal floors;
- (3) the request is pretextual or politically motivated, as determined by federal court;
- (4) the underlying law criminalizes conduct that is constitutionally protected in the non-cooperating Region.

(k) **Federal Mediation.** When Regions dispute cooperation obligations under this section:

- (1) Either Region may request ARB mediation;
- (2) The ARB shall issue a binding determination within sixty (60) days;
- (3) Persistent non-cooperation after ARB ruling constitutes grounds for fiscal penalties under Article X.

#### Choice of Law for Inter-Regional Conduct

(l) **Lex Loci Delicti Principle.** The legality of conduct shall be determined by the law of the Region where the conduct occurred. Specifically:

- (1) no Region may impose civil liability, penalties, or sanctions on any person for conduct that was lawful in the Region where it was performed;
- (2) no Region may enforce a judgment, order, or award against a person based on conduct that was lawful where performed, except as provided in subsection (n);
- (3) the mere fact that effects of lawful conduct are felt in another Region does not subject the actor to liability under that Region's law.

(m) **Protected Conduct Categories.** This protection applies with particular force to:

- (1) medical procedures lawful where performed;
- (2) commercial transactions lawful where executed;
- (3) speech and expression lawful where uttered or published;
- (4) personal conduct lawful where engaged in; and
- (5) professional services lawful where rendered.

(n) **Exceptions to Lex Loci Protection.** Notwithstanding subsection (l), a Region may regulate or impose liability for conduct performed elsewhere when:

- (1) the conduct constitutes a violation of federal law or federal constitutional rights;
- (2) the conduct was specifically directed at causing harm within the regulating Region and such targeting was the primary purpose of the conduct;
- (3) the actor was domiciled in the regulating Region at the time of conduct and traveled elsewhere specifically to evade that Region's laws, provided such evasion was the primary purpose of travel; or
- (4) the conduct involves contractual obligations with a choice-of-law clause selecting the regulating Region's law.

(o) **Anti-Extraterritorial Enforcement.** No Region may:

- (1) penalize, sanction, or impose liability on persons who assist, facilitate, or provide information about lawful conduct in other Regions;
- (2) require reporting of lawful conduct performed in other Regions;
- (3) condition licenses, permits, or benefits on abstention from conduct that is lawful where performed; or
- (4) create causes of action enabling private enforcement against conduct lawful where performed.

(p) **Judgment Non-Recognition.** A judgment, order, or award based on conduct protected under this section shall not be entitled to full faith and credit and shall not be enforceable in any Region other than the issuing Region. Courts shall refuse recognition of such judgments upon motion of any party.

(q) **Savings Clause.** Nothing in this section shall:

- (1) prevent a Region from regulating the in-Region conduct of its own residents;
- (2) limit federal authority to regulate conduct with interstate effects;
- (3) affect enforcement of judgments for conduct that was unlawful where performed; or
- (4) prevent enforcement of valid contractual choice-of-law provisions.

---

### Section 13. Interstate Compacts

(a) Existing Compacts. All interstate compacts in effect at ratification continue in force unless:

- superseded by Regional agreement among all affected Regions,
- terminated according to their own terms,
- or found to conflict with this Constitution.

(b) State-Level Compacts. Compacts between States within the same Region become matters of Regional law. The Regional legislature may modify or terminate such compacts by statute.

(c) Cross-Regional Compacts. Compacts between States in different Regions continue as interstate compacts. Such compacts may be:

- assumed by the relevant Regions by mutual agreement,
- renegotiated as inter-Regional agreements under Section 5,
- or continued under existing State administration.

(d) Federal-State Compacts. Compacts between the federal government and one or more States continue as federal-Regional compacts, with the relevant Region(s) assuming State obligations.

(e) Compact Agencies. Agencies created by interstate compact (such as port authorities, transit authorities, and river commissions) continue in existence under their existing governance structures unless:

- modified by agreement of all participating jurisdictions,
- or reorganized pursuant to Regional law for agencies operating wholly within one Region.

(f) Compact Review. Within five years of ratification, the Allocation Review Board shall review all existing interstate compacts and issue guidance on their status under this Constitution. This review is advisory; compacts remain in force pending legislative action.

---

### Section 14. Professional Credential Protection

#### Professional Immunity for Federal Officers

(a) **Professional Immunity for Constitutional Service.**

(1) No Region or State may suspend, revoke, condition, or investigate the professional license or standing of any individual based on actions taken in the performance of duties for the Federal government, the Allocation Review Board, or any Constitutional Oversight Body;

(2) Any such attempt constitutes a per se violation of federal supremacy;

(3) This immunity applies to all federal officers, employees, contractors, and appointees during and after their service;

(4) The immunity extends to all professional licenses including but not limited to: legal, medical, engineering, accounting, and educational credentials.

(b) **Protected Actions.**

(1) "Actions taken in performance of duties" includes:

- (A) Official decisions, rulings, votes, and opinions;
- (B) Testimony before federal bodies;
- (C) Enforcement activities within federal jurisdiction;
- (D) Public statements regarding federal policy;

(2) Regional professional boards may not use federal service as evidence of unfitness;

(3) "Ethics violations" based on federal policy disagreements are void;

(4) Continuing education requirements may not require disavowal of federal service.

(c) **Enforcement and Remedy.**

(1) Federal officers subject to retaliatory licensing action may seek immediate injunctive relief in federal court;

(2) Upon finding of retaliation, the federal court shall:

- (A) Restore the professional license immediately;
- (B) Award compensatory damages for career harm;

(2) Population disparity is an intentional feature of this Constitution, not a defect. Regions are defined by geographic, economic, and cultural coherence, not population equality.

(3) Small-population Regions are protected by:

- equal representation in the Senate,
- equalization transfers ensuring baseline fiscal capacity (Article X, Section 3),
- the boundary revision process, which allows but does not compel merger (Article I, Section 4),
- inter-Regional cooperation agreements permitting shared institutions (Article I, Section 5).

(4) Small Regions may petition for boundary revision to join an adjacent Region, but may not be compelled to merge.

(f) Minimum Regional Capacity.

(1) Each Region must maintain minimum institutional capacity to:

- administer elections,
- operate Regional courts,
- maintain Regional Guard Forces,
- participate in Senate representation.

(2) If a Region's population falls below one-half of one percent of the total population of the United States, or if a Region demonstrates inability to maintain minimum institutional capacity, the Independent Boundary Review Commission shall conduct a special review within one year and may recommend:

- merger with an adjacent Region,
- enhanced inter-Regional cooperation agreements,
- federal technical assistance.

(3) Any merger recommendation under this subsection requires the same approval process as other boundary revisions under Article I, Section 4.

---

### Section 4. Non-Concurrency Rule

Powers shall be exclusive to the level to which they are assigned unless this Constitution explicitly authorizes shared jurisdiction.

---

### Section 5. Regional Exclusive Domains

(a) **Enumeration.** Regional Exclusive Domains are those areas where Regions have primary authority subject only to Federal Floors and Frameworks.

(b) **ARB Certification.** The Allocation Review Board shall certify whether legislation impacts Regional Exclusive Domains.

(c) **Supermajority Requirement.** Any bill establishing a "National Floor" or "National Framework" that the ARB has certified as impacting a Regional Exclusive Domain requires three-fifths (60%) majority of the House of Representatives for passage. This requirement may not be waived, suspended, or circumvented by House rules, and applies regardless of procedural posture (including conference reports, amendments, and reconciliation).

(d) **Pre-Legislative Domain Certification.**

(1) Before any bill establishing a National Floor or National Framework may be introduced in the House of Representatives, the bill's sponsor shall submit the proposed legislation to the Allocation Review Board for Domain Certification.

(2) Within thirty days of submission, the Board shall certify whether the proposed legislation impacts a Regional Exclusive Domain under this section.

(3) If the Board certifies that the legislation impacts a Regional Exclusive Domain:

- (i) the bill shall be subject to the supermajority requirement of subsection (c);
- (ii) this certification shall be noted in the bill's official text and cannot be removed by amendment; and
- (iii) any attempt to pass the bill by simple majority shall be void.

(4) If the Board certifies that the legislation does not impact a Regional Exclusive Domain, the bill may proceed under normal House procedures.

(5) The Board's Domain Certification is subject to judicial review only for abuse of discretion or clear legal error. Courts shall give substantial deference to the Board's determination of domain boundaries.

(6) Congress may not:

- (i) define its own jurisdiction over Regional Exclusive Domains;
- (ii) amend the definition of Regional Exclusive Domain except by constitutional amendment; or
- (iii) circumvent Domain Certification through creative bill drafting, omnibus legislation, or procedural manipulation.

(7) If the Board fails to issue certification within thirty days, the bill shall be presumptively certified as NOT impacting a Regional Exclusive Domain, and the bill may proceed under normal House procedures. This default prevents certification delay from being used to obstruct legislation.

#### Anti-Bottleneck Provisions

(8) **Expedited Certification Track.** The Board shall establish an expedited certification track for:

- (i) bills addressing declared emergencies;
- (ii) bills with bipartisan House sponsorship exceeding sixty percent;
- (iii) bills that are substantially similar to previously certified legislation.
Expedited certifications shall be completed within ten days.

(9) **Staffing and Capacity Requirements.** The Board shall maintain sufficient staff to process certification requests without backlog:

- (i) If average certification time exceeds twenty days for three consecutive months, the Board shall hire additional staff within sixty days;
- (ii) Certification staff funding is mandatory spending, not subject to annual appropriation;
- (iii) The Board shall publish monthly certification statistics including filing volume, average processing time, and pending requests.

(10) **Backlog Remediation.** If pending certification requests exceed fifty at any time:

- (i) The Board shall implement emergency processing procedures;
- (ii) New requests shall be processed in order of filing date;
- (iii) Requests pending more than twenty days shall be automatically approved for normal House procedures unless the Board affirmatively certifies Regional Exclusive Domain impact within five additional days.

(11) **Anti-Strategic-Delay.** No party may file certification requests for the purpose of creating backlog or delaying unrelated legislation:

- (i) Frivolous or duplicative requests may be summarily dismissed;
- (ii) A pattern of filing requests subsequently withdrawn may result in filing restrictions;
- (iii) The Board may consolidate substantially similar requests.

(12) **Congressional Bypass for Obstruction.** If the Board fails to process certifications due to quorum failure, member vacancies, or other institutional dysfunction for more than sixty consecutive days:

- (i) The House may proceed with legislation without certification by a three-fifths vote;
- (ii) Such legislation shall be subject to expedited judicial review within ninety days of enactment;
- (iii) This bypass may not be used if the Board is functioning normally but simply has a backlog.

---

### Section 6. Regional Equivalence Exemptions

(a) **Equivalence Petition.** A Region may petition the Allocation Review Board for an "Equivalence Exemption" from a specific National Floor. The Board shall grant the exemption if the Region demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence, that its alternative policy achieves the same or superior outcome as intended by the National Floor while better suiting regional economic, geographic, or demographic conditions.

(b) **Outcome Metrics.** For each National Floor, Congress shall specify measurable outcome metrics by which equivalence may be assessed. If Congress fails to specify metrics, the Allocation Review Board shall determine appropriate metrics based on the stated legislative purpose.

(c) **Provisional Compliance.** Pending Allocation Review Board determination on an Equivalence Petition:

(1) The Region may implement its alternative policy on a provisional basis;

(2) The Region shall demonstrate a good-faith compliance mechanism, which may include:

- (i) posting a compliance bond in an amount determined by the Board,
- (ii) establishing an escrow fund for potential remediation costs,
- (iii) implementing enhanced monitoring and reporting, or
- (iv) other assurance mechanisms the Board deems adequate;

(3) Provisional implementation shall not constitute a violation of the National Floor during the pendency of the petition;

(4) If the petition is denied, the Region shall have one hundred eighty days to achieve full compliance with the National Floor.

---

### Section 7. Allocation Review Board

#### Establishment and Composition

(a) **Establishment.** There is hereby established an Allocation Review Board (ARB) to resolve disputes regarding the allocation of powers among federal, Regional, and State governments.

(b) **Composition.** The ARB shall consist of nine members appointed as follows:

(1) Three members appointed by the President with Senate confirmation;

(2) Two members appointed by the Judicial Conference of the United States from among retired federal and state appellate judges who have never held partisan elected office;

(3) Two members elected by the Regional Governors, with each Region casting one vote and no Region voting for a resident of its own Region;

(4) Two members appointed by agreement of the minority leadership of both houses of Congress.

(c) **Party Balance.** No more than four members may be affiliated with the same political party. For purposes of this subsection, "independent" members count toward the party with which they most recently affiliated or, if never affiliated, are assigned by the Chief Justice to maintain balance.

(d) **Experience Diversity.** At least two members must have primary professional experience in state or local government (not federal service), and at least one member must have primary experience in private sector or academic roles.

(e) **Terms and Removal.** Members serve staggered seven-year terms, may serve only one term, and may not be removed except for cause (misconduct, incapacity, or conviction of a felony). Removal requires two-thirds vote of the Senate.

(f) **Vacancy Filling.** Vacancies shall be filled by the original appointing authority within ninety days. If not filled within ninety days, the Chief Justice shall make a temporary appointment from among retired appellate judges until the original authority acts.

#### Jurisdiction and Standards

(g) **Jurisdiction.** The ARB shall have original jurisdiction over:

(1) Disputes between Regions concerning allocation of powers;

(2) Challenges to federal exercise of authority as exceeding enumerated powers;

(3) Challenges to Regional exercise of authority as exceeding enumerated powers;

(4) Disputes regarding spillover effects and non-concurrency;

(5) Certification of legislation as within appropriate governmental authority.

(h) **Standards.** The ARB shall apply the allocation framework established by Congress, or in its absence, the default rules of Article XXI. The ARB shall interpret this Constitution to preserve the balance of power among federal, Regional, and State governments.

#### Appeals and Binding Effect

(i) **Immediate Binding Effect.** In all matters of power allocation:

(1) The ARB's ruling is immediately binding upon issuance;

(2) The ruling shall not be stayed pending appeal to the Supreme Court except as provided in subsection (l);

(3) Parties must comply with ARB rulings during any appeal period.

(j) **Supreme Court Review Scope.** The Supreme Court may review ARB decisions only for:

(1) Errors of constitutional interpretation;

(2) Violation of due process in ARB proceedings;

(3) The Supreme Court may not reweigh factual evidence or substitute its judgment on factual matters.

(k) **Appeals.** ARB decisions are final on factual matters. Questions of constitutional interpretation may be appealed to the Supreme Court.

(l) **Limited Stay Authority.** The Supreme Court may stay an ARB ruling only upon finding:

(1) Substantial likelihood that the ARB committed clear constitutional error;

(2) Irreparable harm to the appellant absent stay;

(3) The stay would not substantially harm other parties or the public interest;

(4) Stay requests must be decided within seven days.

#### Anti-Remand Provisions

(m) **No Factual Remand.** The Supreme Court may not remand a power-allocation dispute to the ARB for:

(1) Further factual findings;

(2) Reconsideration of evidence;

(3) Application of a "new" factual standard.

(n) **Reversal or Affirmance Only.** Upon review of an ARB power-allocation decision:

(1) The Supreme Court shall affirm or reverse;

(2) If reversed, the Supreme Court shall specify the correct constitutional interpretation;

(3) The ARB shall apply the Court's interpretation to the existing factual record without further proceedings.

(o) **One Appeal Limit.** Each party may appeal an ARB power-allocation ruling to the Supreme Court only once:

(1) Subsequent appeals on the same matter are barred;

(2) ARB application of Supreme Court interpretation is not separately appealable;

(3) The ARB's post-reversal ruling is final.

#### Parallel Filing Prevention

(p) **Exclusive Initial Jurisdiction.** Power-allocation disputes shall be filed first with the ARB:

(1) The Supreme Court shall not accept original jurisdiction over power-allocation matters;

(2) Filings that characterize power-allocation as "pure constitutional interpretation" shall be transferred to the ARB;

(3) The ARB shall determine whether a matter involves power allocation.

(q) **Sequential Proceeding Requirement.** Parties may not:

(1) File parallel proceedings in the ARB and Supreme Court on related matters;

(2) Seek Supreme Court review until ARB proceedings are complete;

(3) Raise arguments in Supreme Court that were not presented to the ARB.

(r) **Expedited Timeline Enforcement.** The combined timeline for ARB ruling and Supreme Court review shall not exceed:

(1) One hundred twenty days from initial filing to final resolution;

(2) Failure of either body to rule within its allotted time results in automatic ruling for the non-moving party;

(3) Extensions only for extraordinary circumstances certified by the Chief Justice.

#### Adversarial Review Office

(s) **Establishment of ARO.** There is established within the ARB an Adversarial Review Office ("ARO"), structurally independent from the ARB's certification and determination functions.

(t) **ARO Composition.** The ARO shall consist of:

(1) A Chief Adversarial Officer appointed by the minority party leadership of both houses of Congress (by agreement) for a non-renewable five-year term;

(2) Deputy Adversarial Officers and staff sufficient to review all major determinations, with staffing levels set by formula (not annual appropriation);

(3) Independent legal counsel with authority to file court actions.

(u) **ARO Function.** The ARO shall:

(1) Review every Domain Certification, Equivalence Determination, Preemption Certification, and other major determination;

(2) Issue a public "Adversarial Report" identifying potential errors, alternative interpretations, methodological concerns, and evidence of bias;

(3) Have standing to challenge determinations in federal court on behalf of affected parties or the public interest;

(4) Refer evidence of misconduct to the Department of Justice Inspector General.

(v) **Review Completion Trigger.** No determination shall take effect until:

(1) The ARO has issued its Adversarial Report; OR

(2) The ARO has certified in writing that it has completed its review and declines to issue a report; OR

(3) The ARO has petitioned the National Constitutional Court for a time extension due to data volume or complexity, and such extension has expired.

#### Regional Override

(w) **Regional Override of Determinations.** If five of the seven Regional Governors jointly certify that a determination by the ARB:

(1) Exceeds the ARB's statutory or constitutional authority;

(2) Reflects systematic bias toward federal expansion or centralization; or

(3) Fundamentally misapplies the criteria established by law;

the determination shall be suspended pending expedited judicial review.

(x) **Expedited Override Review.** Upon Regional Override certification:

(1) The Supreme Court shall grant expedited review within thirty days;

(2) Oral argument shall be held within sixty days of granting review;

(3) Decision shall be issued within ninety days of oral argument.

(y) **Override Limitations.**

(1) This section may not be invoked more than twice per calendar year;

(2) A Region that participates in a frivolous override (as determined by the Court) shall be barred from participating in the next override petition;

(3) Override may not be used to challenge individual case determinations; only determinations of general applicability or systematic patterns.

#### Systematic Bias Detection

(z) **Statistical Monitoring.** The Government Accountability Office shall annually analyze all ARB determinations for systematic patterns, including:

(1) Certification and determination outcomes correlated with presidential administration;

(2) Regional win/loss rates in contested proceedings;

(3) Correlation between outcomes and the appointing authority of deciding members;

(4) Deviation from historical baseline patterns;

(5) ARO challenge success rates over time.

(aa) **Bias Finding.** If GAO analysis demonstrates statistically significant correlation (p < 0.05) between determination outcomes and political factors over any rolling three-year period:

(1) The finding shall be publicly reported to Congress, all Regional Governors, and the Chief Justice;

(2) All determinations during the affected period shall be subject to expedited judicial review upon petition by any affected party, with de novo standard of review;

(3) Congress shall hold public hearings within sixty days;

(4) The ARB shall submit a remediation plan within ninety days.

(bb) **Structural Response.** If bias findings persist for two consecutive three-year periods (six years total):

(1) All current members' terms shall automatically expire;

(2) Replacement members shall be appointed by lottery from a pool consisting of retired federal appellate judges, retired state supreme court justices, and former deans of ABA-accredited law schools who have never held partisan elected office;

(3) Lottery appointments shall serve three-year terms, after which normal appointment procedures resume;

(4) Members removed under this subsection are permanently ineligible for reappointment to any technocratic body.

#### Budgetary Independence

(cc) **Automatic Funding Formula.** The operating budget of the ARB and the ARO shall be:

(1) Set as a fixed percentage of federal revenue (0.002% for the ARB; 0.0005% for the ARO);

(2) Automatically appropriated without annual congressional action;

(3) Adjusted annually for inflation using the Consumer Price Index.

(dd) **Prohibition on Budgetary Manipulation.** Congress may not:

(1) Reduce funding below the formula amount;

(2) Impose conditions on the use of formula funds;

(3) Transfer formula funds to other purposes;

(4) Delay disbursement of formula funds beyond thirty days after the start of each fiscal year.

(ee) **Enforcement.** Any member of the ARB, or the ARO, may petition the Supreme Court for a writ of mandamus to compel disbursement of formula funds. Such petitions shall be heard on an expedited basis.

#### Anti-Consolidation Safeguards

(ff) **Cross-Partisan Appointment Mandate.** To prevent a single political movement from bypassing constitutional checks through unified control of the Federal and Regional governments:

(ff-1) **Council of Governors Approval.** Appointments to the ARB, IFC, and FDCA require a three-fifths (60%) vote of the Council of Governors, ensuring that a simple partisan alignment between the President and a majority of Governors cannot capture these bodies.

(ff-2) **Adversarial Minority Key.** The minority party in the House of Representatives shall appoint a "Transparency Observer" to each Constitutional Oversight Body with full access to deliberations and data, but no vote. The Observer may:

- (1) attend all meetings, including closed sessions;
- (2) access all documents, data, and communications;
- (3) publish dissenting reports and minority analyses;
- (4) refer concerns directly to Congress and the public.

(ff-3) **Unified Control Supermajority.** If at any time a single political party controls the Presidency and four or more Regional Governorships, the threshold for the ARB to certify a federal bill as "Non-Exclusive" shall automatically rise to a three-quarters (75%) vote of the Board.

(ff-4) **Party Alignment Determination.** For purposes of subsection (ff-3), the IFC shall determine party alignment based on:

- (1) formal party registration of the officeholder;
- (2) caucus affiliation in the case of legislators;
- (3) endorsement patterns and voting alignment for independents.
An officeholder who formally declares non-alignment with any party shall not be counted toward the unified control threshold.

### Section 7-A. Algorithmic Governance Transparency

(a) **Mandatory Algorithmic Transparency.** All algorithms, data models, formulas, and computational methods used by the Allocation Review Board, Independent Fiscal Council, Federal Data Coordination Agency, or any other Constitutional Oversight Body to make determinations affecting Regional rights, obligations, or resources shall be:

- (1) fully documented in plain language accessible to non-technical readers;
- (2) published in complete technical detail, including source code where applicable;
- (3) accompanied by explanations of all assumptions, weightings, and data inputs;
- (4) subject to public comment before initial adoption and before any material modification.

- (4) testable by any interested party using publicly available data.

(c) **Independent Algorithmic Audit.** Each Constitutional Oversight Body shall undergo annual algorithmic audit by an independent panel:

- (1) The panel shall be appointed by the National Academy of Sciences;
- (2) The audit shall assess accuracy, bias, and methodological soundness;
- (3) Audit findings shall be published within sixty (60) days of completion;
- (4) The audited body shall respond to findings within ninety (90) days.

(d) **Bias Testing Requirements.** Before any algorithm may be used for constitutional determinations:

- (1) it shall be tested for systematic bias against any Region, demographic group, or economic sector;
- (2) bias testing results shall be published;
- (3) algorithms showing statistically significant bias (p < 0.05) may not be used until corrected;
- (4) ongoing bias monitoring shall continue throughout the algorithm's use.

(e) **Data Input Transparency.** All data used as inputs to algorithmic determinations shall be:

- (1) publicly disclosed, with appropriate privacy protections for individual-level data;
- (2) sourced from publicly verifiable sources;
- (3) accompanied by metadata describing collection methodology, limitations, and potential biases;
- (4) subject to challenge by affected parties who may submit alternative data.

(f) **Methodological Challenge Right.** Any Region or affected party may challenge the methodology of an algorithmic determination:

- (1) challenges shall be heard by a Special Master appointed by the Chief Justice with relevant technical expertise;
- (2) the challenger may present expert testimony on methodological flaws;
- (3) the Constitutional Oversight Body bears the burden of demonstrating methodological soundness;
- (4) if the challenge is sustained, the determination shall be vacated pending methodological correction.

(g) **Factual Finding Limitation.** The principle that factual findings of Constitutional Oversight Bodies are "final" under Section 7 applies only to:

- (1) factual determinations based on disclosed data and transparent methodology;
- (2) findings that have survived methodological challenge or for which the challenge period has expired;
- (3) this principle does not immunize algorithmic methodology from review.

(h) **Anti-Black-Box Provision.** No Constitutional Oversight Body may:

- (1) use proprietary algorithms whose methodology cannot be publicly disclosed;
- (2) rely on machine learning models that cannot be explained in human-interpretable terms;
- (3) treat algorithmic outputs as conclusive without human review and approval;
- (4) refuse to explain the basis for any specific determination to affected parties.

(i) **Algorithmic Impact Statements.** Before adopting any new algorithm or materially modifying an existing algorithm, Constitutional Oversight Bodies shall publish an Algorithmic Impact Statement assessing:

- (3) comparison with alternative methodological approaches;
- (4) mechanisms for ongoing monitoring and correction.

(j) **Whistleblower Protection.** Employees of Constitutional Oversight Bodies who report algorithmic bias, methodological flaws, or data manipulation shall be protected under federal whistleblower statutes and may not be terminated, demoted, or subjected to adverse action for such reporting.

#### Technocratic Integrity and Anti-Capture Provisions

(k) **Revolving Door Restrictions.** To prevent the emergence of an insular technocratic class cycling between oversight bodies:

(k-1) **Cooling-Off Periods.** No individual may serve as a member, senior staff, or consultant to more than one Constitutional Oversight Body (including the ARB, IFC, FARB, ETRB, FDCA, and any successor bodies) within a five-year period. Specifically:

- (1) former members of any such body may not be appointed to another such body until five years after the end of their prior service;
- (2) former senior staff (defined as employees at GS-15 equivalent or above) may not be appointed as members or senior staff of another such body until three years after separation;
- (3) consultants who provided more than 500 hours of service to any such body within a three-year period are subject to the same restrictions as senior staff.

(k-2) **Prohibition on Double-Hatting.** No individual may simultaneously:

- (1) serve as a member of any Constitutional Oversight Body while serving as a member, employee, or consultant to any other such body;
- (2) serve on any Constitutional Oversight Body while employed by or consulting for any party with matters pending before that body or any related body;
- (3) provide expert testimony, advisory opinions, or consulting services to parties in disputes before any body on which they have served within the preceding five years.

- (3) must disclose, for five years after separation, any compensation received from entities subject to the jurisdiction of their former body.

(k-4) **Personnel Diversity Requirements.** To prevent homogeneous technocracy:

- (1) no more than two members of any Constitutional Oversight Body may have previously served together on any other such body;
- (2) no more than one-third of members may have prior employment with the same institution (university, think tank, consulting firm, or government agency);
- (3) appointing authorities shall consider geographic, institutional, and methodological diversity in making appointments.

(k-5) **Disclosure and Transparency.** All members and senior staff shall:

- (1) file annual financial disclosure statements including all sources of income, investments, and institutional affiliations;
- (2) publicly disclose all prior service on Constitutional Oversight Bodies, related advisory committees, and relevant private sector positions;
- (3) recuse themselves from matters involving former employers, clients, or co-panelists for three years after the relevant relationship ended.

---

### Section 8. National Security Operations Override

(a) **Certification of National Security Necessity.** When Regional exclusive-domain regulations (including but not limited to labor standards, energy planning, environmental rules, or operational requirements) materially impede the operation of federal defense facilities, defense manufacturing, or critical national security infrastructure, the President may certify a "National Security Necessity."

(b) **Certification Requirements.** A National Security Necessity certification shall:

- (1) identify the specific federal defense operation or facility affected;
- (2) identify the specific Regional regulation creating the impediment;
- (3) demonstrate that the impediment is material (not merely inconvenient) to national defense;
- (4) be transmitted to Congress and the affected Regional Government within 48 hours.

(c) **Effect of Certification.** Upon certification:

- (1) the identified Regional regulation shall be suspended as applied to the identified federal operation for a period not exceeding one hundred eighty (180) days;
- (2) the federal government shall negotiate in good faith with the Regional Government for a permanent accommodation;
- (3) affected workers and communities shall receive federal mitigation assistance for any adverse impacts.

(d) **Congressional Review.** Congress may disapprove a National Security Necessity certification by joint resolution within sixty (60) days, which shall terminate the suspension.

(e) **Judicial Review.** Regional Governments may challenge certifications in federal court on grounds that:

- (1) the impediment is not material to national defense; or
- (2) the certification is pretextual (i.e., the true purpose is economic rather than security-related).

(f) **Anti-Abuse Limitation.** This override may not be used to:

- (1) exempt federal contractors from generally applicable workplace safety requirements;
- (2) circumvent Regional environmental protections except where directly incompatible with defense operations;
- (3) impose federal labor standards on non-defense Regional employers.

---

### Section 9. Emerging Technology Domain Assignment

(a) **Emerging Technology Defined.** An "Emerging Technology" is any technology, practice, or capability that:

- (1) does not fit clearly within existing enumerated Federal, Regional, or State domains;
- (2) poses potential systemic risks crossing jurisdictional boundaries; and
- (3) is not adequately regulated by any existing jurisdictional framework.

(b) **Emerging Technology Review Board.** There is hereby established an Emerging Technology Review Board (ETRB) consisting of:

- (1) three members appointed by the President with scientific or technical expertise;
- (2) two members appointed by the Regional Governors (collectively);
- (3) two members appointed by the National Academy of Sciences;
- (4) two members appointed by the Judicial Conference from among judges with technology law experience.

(c) **Petition for Domain Assignment.** Any federal agency, Regional Government, or State Government may petition the ETRB to assign jurisdiction over an Emerging Technology. Private parties with demonstrated interest may file amicus submissions.

(d) **Provisional Federal Jurisdiction.** Upon a finding that an Emerging Technology poses systemic risks that cannot be adequately managed at the Regional or State level, the ETRB may assign provisional federal jurisdiction for a period not exceeding five years.

(e) **Criteria for Federal Assignment.** Provisional federal jurisdiction is appropriate when:

- (1) the technology poses risks of catastrophic or irreversible harm;
- (2) regulatory arbitrage among Regions or States would create "race to the bottom" dynamics;
- (3) effective regulation requires uniform national standards;
- (4) the technology implicates national security or foreign policy concerns.

(f) **Provisional Regional Jurisdiction.** When an Emerging Technology primarily affects inter-state coordination within Regions but does not meet the criteria for federal assignment, the ETRB may assign provisional Regional jurisdiction.

(g) **Transition to Permanent Assignment.** Before provisional jurisdiction expires:

- (1) the ETRB shall recommend permanent domain assignment to Congress;
- (2) Congress shall codify the assignment by statute, which may include shared jurisdiction frameworks;
- (3) if Congress fails to act, provisional jurisdiction extends for two additional years, after which the technology defaults to State jurisdiction unless renewed.

(h) **Anti-Haven Provision.** No State or Region may offer "regulatory haven" status for Emerging Technologies under provisional federal jurisdiction:

- (1) attempts to attract Emerging Technology development through regulatory exemption are void;
- (2) federal enforcement authority extends to such technologies regardless of State or Regional non-cooperation;
- (3) jurisdictions that actively obstruct federal Emerging Technology regulation shall be ineligible for federal research and development funding for five years.

(i) **Sunset and Review.** Each provisional assignment shall include:

- (1) specific regulatory objectives to be achieved;
- (2) metrics for evaluating regulatory effectiveness;
- (3) mandatory review at the midpoint of the provisional period.

### Section 10. Vital Federal Operations Protection

(a) **Vital Federal Operations Defined.** In addition to national defense facilities protected under Section 8, the following constitute "Vital Federal Operations" entitled to protection from Regional regulatory interference:

- (1) Social Security Administration processing centers and data facilities;
- (2) Internal Revenue Service processing centers, data facilities, and regional offices;
- (3) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention facilities and laboratories;
- (4) Federal Emergency Management Agency regional headquarters and logistics centers;
- (5) Medicare and Medicaid Services processing facilities;
- (6) Federal court facilities and administrative offices;
- (7) United States Postal Service distribution centers;
- (8) Any other federal facility designated by Congress as "Vital" by statute.

(b) **Minimum Operating Guarantee.** Regions may not use exclusive-domain regulatory authority to:

- (1) deny, restrict, or condition utility services (water, electricity, natural gas, telecommunications) to Vital Federal Operations;
- (2) impose labor standards that would require reduction of operating hours or staffing below levels necessary for continuous operation;
- (3) apply zoning, permitting, or land-use restrictions that would require relocation or closure of existing Vital Federal Operations;
- (4) impose environmental or health regulations specifically targeting federal facilities without generally applicable justification.

(c) **Certification of Vital Operations Necessity.** When Regional regulations materially impede Vital Federal Operations, the head of the affected federal agency may certify a "Vital Operations Necessity":

- (1) The certification shall identify the specific regulation and specific operational impact;
- (2) The certification shall be transmitted to the Regional Government and Congress within 48 hours;
- (3) Upon certification, the identified regulation shall be suspended as applied to the federal facility for ninety (90) days pending negotiation.

(d) **Negotiated Accommodation.** During the suspension period:

- (1) The federal agency and Regional Government shall negotiate in good faith for permanent accommodation;
- (2) The federal government shall offer reasonable mitigation for Regional concerns (e.g., environmental offsets, community benefits);
- (3) If accommodation is reached, it shall be binding on both parties.

(e) **Arbitration for Unresolved Disputes.** If negotiation fails:

- (1) Either party may request binding arbitration before a three-member panel (one selected by each party, third selected by the Chief Justice);
- (2) The panel shall issue a decision within sixty (60) days balancing federal operational needs against Regional regulatory interests;
- (3) The panel may impose conditions on either party to achieve accommodation.

(f) **Anti-Hostage Provision.** A Region may not:

- (1) threaten or impose regulatory burdens on Vital Federal Operations as leverage in unrelated disputes;
- (2) coordinate with other Regions to simultaneously burden federal operations across multiple locations;
- (3) time regulatory actions to coincide with federal budget negotiations, elections, or other politically sensitive periods.

(g) **Emergency Federal Authority.** If a Region takes action that would cause imminent shutdown of a Vital Federal Operation:

- (1) The President may declare an emergency and assume temporary operational control of necessary Regional infrastructure (utilities, transportation);
- (2) Federal operation shall continue only so long as necessary to prevent shutdown;
- (3) The federal government shall compensate the Region for costs of federal operation.

(h) **Distinction from National Security Override.** This section provides protection for civilian administrative operations; Section 8 provides protection for defense operations. The standards and procedures differ because civilian operations do not implicate the same national security concerns, and Regional interests are given greater weight in balancing.

---

## ARTICLE III - RIGHTS FLOORS AND SUBSIDIARITY

### Section 1. Floors, Not Ceilings

Federal rights and standards establish minimum protections only.

No federal law shall be interpreted to prohibit a Region or State from exceeding such protections unless explicitly stated.

---

### Section 2. Subsidiarity with Enforcement

Authority resides at the lowest level capable of exercising it effectively, subject to judicial enforcement of constitutional boundaries.

---

### Section 3. Hierarchy of Law

(a) This Constitution is the supreme law of the United States.

(b) Within their respective spheres:

- Federal law enacted pursuant to enumerated federal powers is supreme over conflicting Regional, State, or local law.
- Regional law enacted pursuant to enumerated Regional powers is supreme over conflicting State or local law within the Region.
- State law is supreme over conflicting local law within the State.

(c) State Constitutions.

(1) State constitutions may not conflict with this Constitution or with the Regional constitution of the Region in which the State is located.

(2) State constitutions may establish protections exceeding those in the Regional or federal constitutions (floors, not ceilings).

(3) In case of conflict between a State constitution and a Regional constitution:

- the Regional constitution prevails on matters within enumerated Regional powers,
- the State constitution prevails on matters within reserved State powers,
- disputes shall be resolved by the Allocation Review Board, with appeal to the Supreme Court.

(d) Local Charters. Local government charters and ordinances are subordinate to State law and may not conflict with State, Regional, or federal law.

(e) Pre-Ratification State Law. State law in effect at ratification continues in force unless:

- inconsistent with this Constitution,
- superseded by Regional law on matters transferred to Regional authority,
- or repealed by the State.

---

## ARTICLE IV - THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH

### Section 1. Congress

Congress shall remain bicameral, consisting of a House of Representatives and a Senate.

---

### Section 2. The House of Representatives

The House shall be elected by the People according to population and shall initiate national legislation within enumerated federal powers.

---

### Section 3. The Senate

(a) The Senate shall represent the Regions equally.

(b) Each Region shall be represented by three Senators, elected at-large within the Region by ranked-choice voting for staggered six-year terms.

(c) The total membership of the Senate shall be three times the number of Regions, plus any at-large members serving under subsection (d).

(d) Each Region shall select Senators according to Regional law, provided such law provides for direct popular election.

(e) **Transitional Exception.** Senators representing the District of Columbia and United States territories prior to Regional assignment serve as at-large members with full voting rights pursuant to Article XX, Sections 1(b) and 2(b). Upon Regional assignment, such Senators join the assigned Region's delegation.

---

### Section 4. Senate Powers

The Senate's powers are limited to:

- ratification of treaties,
- confirmation of judicial and constitutional officers,
- participation in constitutional amendments,
- adjudication of intergovernmental disputes.

The Senate shall not function as a routine legislative veto.

**Adjudication Procedures.** When adjudicating intergovernmental disputes:

- (a) The Senate shall establish standing rules for dispute adjudication, including discovery procedures, hearing requirements, and decision standards.
- (b) Disputes must be resolved within 180 days of filing unless all parties consent to extension.
- (c) Senate adjudication is limited to disputes between Regions, or between Regions and the federal government, regarding interpretation of this Constitution or federal law.
- (d) The Senate may not adjudicate disputes involving individual rights (which belong to the courts) or disputes already pending in the Allocation Review Board or federal courts.
- (e) Senate adjudication decisions may be appealed to the Supreme Court on questions of constitutional interpretation within 60 days.

**Conflict of Interest Provisions.** To ensure impartial adjudication:

- (f) **Mandatory Recusal.** Senators from any Region that is a party to a dispute shall be recused from voting on the adjudication. If both parties are Regions, Senators from both Regions are recused.
- (g) **Quorum with Recusals.** When Senators are recused under subsection (f):
    - (1) The quorum for adjudication shall be a majority of non-recused Senators;
    - (2) Decisions require a majority of non-recused Senators voting;
    - (3) If recusals reduce participating Senators below eight, the dispute shall be transferred to the Supreme Court for original jurisdiction.
- (h) **Anti-Bloc Voting Safeguards.**
    - (1) No adjudication may proceed if Senators from three or fewer Regions would constitute a majority of voting Senators;
    - (2) If a pattern emerges where the same Regional coalition decides three consecutive disputes against the same Region or group of Regions, any affected Region may demand transfer to the Supreme Court;
    - (3) The Chief Justice shall review Senate adjudication patterns annually and may certify "systematic regional bias" if statistical analysis demonstrates non-random voting patterns correlated with Regional identity rather than legal merit. Such certification triggers automatic Supreme Court review of pending and future disputes for two years.
- (i) **Independent Adjudication Panel Option.** For disputes involving allegations of Regional discrimination or systematic bias:
    - (1) Any party may request adjudication by an Independent Panel instead of the full Senate;
    - (2) The Panel shall consist of the Chief Justice (presiding), two retired federal appellate judges selected by lot, and two Senators selected by lot from non-party Regions;
    - (3) Panel decisions have the same force as Senate adjudication and are appealable under the same terms.
- (j) **Anti-Strategic Filing.** To prevent deliberate overload of adjudication systems:
    - (1) No party may have more than three disputes pending before the Senate or Supreme Court simultaneously;
    - (2) Disputes that are substantially similar or arise from coordinated filing strategies may be consolidated;
    - (3) The Chief Justice may impose filing restrictions on parties who demonstrate a pattern of filing disputes primarily to create procedural burden;
    - (4) If Supreme Court transfer requests exceed the Court's capacity, the Court may designate a Special Master panel of retired federal judges to hear overflow cases with the same binding authority;
    - (5) Filing fees, set by the Judicial Conference and waivable for hardship, shall apply to deter frivolous or strategic filings.

**Senate Adjudicative Ethics Code.** When exercising quasi-judicial functions:

- (k) **Applicability.** When the Senate or any Senator exercises adjudicative functions under this Article, including dispute resolution, treaty interpretation, and constitutional interpretation, the following ethics rules shall apply with the same force as judicial conduct rules apply to federal judges.

- (l) **Ex Parte Communication Prohibition.** During the pendency of any adjudicative matter:
    - (1) no Senator participating in the adjudication may communicate about the substance of the matter with any party, party representative, or interested person outside of official proceedings;
    - (2) all substantive communications must be on the record and with notice to all parties;
    - (3) inadvertent ex parte contacts must be immediately disclosed and made part of the record;
    - (4) violations shall result in mandatory recusal of the affected Senator and, for willful violations, referral to the Senate Ethics Committee.

- (m) **Gift and Hospitality Restrictions.** From the time a matter is filed until final disposition:
    - (1) no Senator participating in the adjudication may accept gifts, hospitality, travel, or other things of value from any party or interested person exceeding $50 in aggregate value;
    - (2) no Senator may accept speaking fees, honoraria, or consulting compensation from entities with interests in pending matters;
    - (3) this prohibition extends to gifts to immediate family members and staff;
    - (4) pre-existing relationships requiring ongoing financial transactions (such as book royalties from a publisher that is a party) must be disclosed but need not be terminated.

- (n) **Campaign Contribution Restrictions.** During the pendency of adjudicative matters:
    - (1) no Senator may solicit or accept campaign contributions from any party to the adjudication, their officers, directors, or registered lobbyists;
    - (2) contributions received before the matter was filed need not be returned but must be disclosed;
    - (3) contributions received in violation of this subsection must be returned within 30 days or donated to the U.S. Treasury;
    - (4) Senators who receive contributions exceeding $10,000 in aggregate from parties to a matter within the two years preceding filing shall disclose such contributions and may be subject to recusal motions.

- (o) **Independent Expenditure Disclosure.** If a Senator becomes aware that independent expenditures exceeding $100,000 have been made supporting or opposing their candidacy by a party to a pending adjudication or their affiliates:
    - (1) the Senator shall immediately disclose this information to all parties and the presiding officer;
    - (2) any party may move for recusal based on appearance of impropriety;
    - (3) the motion shall be decided by the non-conflicted Senators, with ties resolved in favor of recusal.

- (p) **Adjudicative Impartiality Standard.** Senators exercising adjudicative functions shall:
    - (1) decide matters based solely on the record, applicable law, and constitutional principles;
    - (2) avoid public statements prejudging matters before them;
    - (3) disqualify themselves when their impartiality might reasonably be questioned;
    - (4) not allow political, partisan, or Regional loyalty considerations to influence their adjudicative judgment.

- (q) **Ethics Enforcement.** The Senate Ethics Committee shall:
    - (1) promulgate detailed rules implementing this section within one year of ratification;
    - (2) receive and investigate complaints of adjudicative ethics violations;
    - (3) impose sanctions ranging from private reprimand to public censure to exclusion from adjudicative functions;
    - (4) refer willful or repeated violations to the Department of Justice for potential criminal prosecution under applicable federal ethics statutes.

- (r) **Party Remedies.** A party to an adjudication who demonstrates that ethics violations materially affected the outcome may:
    - (1) move for reconsideration by a panel excluding the violating Senator(s);
    - (2) appeal directly to the Supreme Court for de novo review;
    - (3) seek civil damages from Senators who engaged in willful violations, with qualified immunity waived for adjudicative ethics violations.

**Senate Adjudicative Tie-Break.** To prevent procedural deadlock during the Senate's judicial functions:

- (s) **Presiding Officer.** The Chief Justice of the United States shall preside over the Senate when it sits as an adjudicative body for inter-Regional or constitutional disputes. The Chief Justice shall:
    - (1) maintain order and enforce procedural rules;
    - (2) rule on evidentiary and procedural motions;
    - (3) ensure compliance with the Senate Adjudicative Ethics Code.

- (t) **Casting Vote.** The Chief Justice shall remain non-voting during deliberations but shall cast a single vote to break an absolute tie among the non-recused Senators:
    - (1) a "tie" exists when the votes for and against a disposition are exactly equal;
    - (2) the Chief Justice may not cast a vote unless a tie exists;
    - (3) the Chief Justice shall explain the reasoning for the casting vote in writing.

- (u) **Limited Precedent for Tie-Broken Decisions.** A decision reached by the Chief Justice's casting vote shall be:
    - (1) subject to mandatory, expedited review by the Supreme Court within sixty (60) days;
    - (2) stayed pending Supreme Court review if any party so requests;
    - (3) not binding as precedent on future Senate adjudications until affirmed by the Supreme Court;
    - (4) this provision ensures that narrowly decided matters receive full judicial scrutiny and carry the weight of a clear legal majority.

---

### Section 4-A. Senate Concurrence for Constitutional Safeguards (Proposed)

> **Note:** This section is a proposed optional enhancement.

Senate concurrence by majority vote may be required for legislation affecting constitutional safeguards, including emergency powers, domestic armed force deployment, election administration, judicial structure, de-escalation procedures, and allocation of powers.

If adopted, this section would create targeted Senate involvement in safeguard legislation while preserving House majority rule for ordinary policy.

---

### Section 5. Federal Lawmaking

(a) Bills within enumerated federal powers may be introduced in the House of Representatives.

(b) Upon passage by the House, bills shall be presented to the President for signature.

(c) The President may sign or veto the bill. A presidential veto may be overridden by a two-thirds vote of the House of Representatives.

(d) The Senate shall not have veto power over ordinary legislation. Senate concurrence is required only for matters specified in Section 4.

(e) Senate Review of Interregional Coordination Matters. For bills affecting interregional coordination (shared natural resources, equalization formulas, Regional mandates, boundary procedures), the Senate may delay presentation to the President to propose amendments, but cannot permanently block legislation.

- (1) The Senate must complete review within 60 days of receiving a bill from the House. If no action is taken within 60 days, the bill shall be automatically presented to the President.
- (2) If the Senate proposes amendments, the House may accept, reject, or modify them within 30 days. The House's final action is conclusive.
- (3) The Senate may invoke review by majority vote within 10 days of House passage. Failure to invoke review waives the delay authority.
- (4) During Senate review, the bill's sponsors in the House may request expedited review (30 days) upon showing urgent circumstances.

(f) The categories triggering Senate review may not be expanded except by constitutional amendment.

(g) Implementation procedures are established by statute.

---

### Section 6. Senate Legitimacy and Population Rebalancing

(a) **Decennial Population Review.** Following each decennial census, the Independent Boundary Review Commission shall assess whether population disparities among Regions have reached levels that threaten the legitimacy of Senate adjudication functions.

(b) **Legitimacy Threshold.** A "Legitimacy Imbalance" exists when:

- (1) the most populous Region exceeds the least populous Region by a ratio greater than 50:1; or
- (2) Regions containing less than five percent of the national population collectively hold more than thirty percent of Senate seats; or
- (3) a majority of Senate seats are held by Regions containing less than twenty percent of the national population.

(c) **Mandatory Response.** Upon finding a Legitimacy Imbalance, the Commission shall:

- (1) recommend boundary adjustments that would reduce the imbalance while respecting geographic and cultural coherence;
- (2) recommend merger options for Regions below a minimum population threshold (one percent of national population);
- (3) submit recommendations to Congress and all Regional Governors within one year of census certification.

(d) **Weighted Adjudication Alternative.** If boundary adjustment is not feasible or is rejected, the following weighted adjudication system shall apply to Senate dispute resolution functions:

- (1) For disputes under Section 4 (inter-Regional disputes), each Region's vote shall be weighted by the square root of its population relative to other Regions;
- (2) Population weighting shall not apply to ordinary legislative functions of the Senate;
- (3) The weighting formula shall be recalculated following each census.

(e) **Super-Minority Protection.** Notwithstanding subsection (d), small-population Regions retain:

- (1) absolute veto over boundary changes affecting their Region;
- (2) equal standing to bring disputes before the Senate;
- (3) guaranteed minimum representation in all federal institutions.

(f) **Legitimacy Review Trigger.** If three or more Regions formally declare that Senate adjudication lacks democratic legitimacy due to population imbalance:

- (1) The declaration shall trigger expedited constitutional review by the Supreme Court;
- (2) The Court may order temporary modifications to adjudication procedures pending structural reform;
- (3) Congress shall hold hearings within ninety days on constitutional amendments to address the imbalance.

(g) **Periodic Reauthorization of Parity Rule.** The equal-representation principle for the Senate shall be subject to reauthorization:

- (1) Every twenty years following ratification, the principle shall be submitted to national referendum;
- (2) Reauthorization requires approval by majority of voters and by voters in at least four of seven Regions;
- (3) If reauthorization fails, Congress shall propose alternative representation formulas within two years.

(h) **Anti-Manipulation.** Population figures for purposes of this section shall be:

- (1) based solely on the decennial census conducted by the Census Bureau;
- (2) unadjusted for citizenship status, incarceration, or other factors that might be manipulated;
- (3) certified by the Census Bureau Director, whose certification is final and non-reviewable.

## ARTICLE V - THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH

### Section 1. The Presidency

The President remains the Chief Executive and Commander-in-Chief of the Federal Armed Forces.

---

### Section 2. Scope of Executive Authority

The President shall:

- execute federal law,
- conduct foreign affairs,
- enforce constitutional floors.

The President shall not exercise general domestic governance over Regional or State domains.

---

### Section 3. Regional Government Structure

Each Region shall establish a republican form of government with separate legislative, executive, and judicial branches, as provided in Article I, Section 3.

---

### Section 4. Regional Executive

Each Region shall have a Regional Governor elected by the people of the Region. The method of election and term of office shall be established by Regional constitution, provided terms do not exceed six years.

---

### Section 5. Political Institutional Failure and Federal Receivership

(a) **Political Institutional Failure Defined.** A Region is in "Political Institutional Failure" when:

- (1) the Regional legislature has been unable to achieve quorum for more than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days;
- (2) no Regional Governor or acting Governor is able to exercise executive authority for more than ninety (90) consecutive days;
- (3) the Regional judiciary cannot seat sufficient judges to adjudicate cases for more than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days;
- (4) the Region has failed to conduct scheduled elections for more than twelve (12) months past the constitutional deadline; or
- (5) the Region has been unable to perform two or more "Minimum Institutional Capacity" functions under Article I, Schedule A(f) for more than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days.

(b) **Certification of Political Institutional Failure.** Political Institutional Failure shall be certified by:

- (1) joint declaration of the Chief Justice of the United States and the Comptroller General; or
- (2) concurrent resolution of both houses of Congress; or
- (3) petition of four of the remaining six Regional Governors, confirmed by the Supreme Court within thirty (30) days.

(c) **Federal Political Receivership.** Upon certification, the President shall appoint a Federal Political Receiver for the Region, subject to Senate confirmation within thirty (30) days (or deemed confirmed if the Senate fails to act):

- (1) The Receiver shall be a person of recognized competence in public administration who has not held partisan elected office within the preceding ten (10) years;
- (2) The Receiver shall exercise only those governmental powers necessary to restore functioning institutions;
- (3) The Receiver may not exercise policy discretion beyond maintaining existing Regional law and essential services.

(d) **Receiver Powers and Limitations.** The Federal Political Receiver may:

- (1) convene and preside over the Regional legislature for purposes of achieving quorum and conducting essential business;
- (2) appoint acting executive officials to maintain essential governmental functions;
- (3) appoint temporary judges to hear pending cases, subject to federal judicial qualifications;
- (4) order and administer emergency elections to fill vacant offices;
- (5) maintain existing Regional law and regulations without modification except for emergency measures.

The Receiver may NOT:

- (1) enact new substantive legislation or regulations;
- (2) modify Regional tax rates or fiscal policy beyond maintaining current operations;
- (3) enter into long-term contracts or obligations binding the Region beyond the receivership period;
- (4) modify the Regional constitution;
- (5) exercise any power not strictly necessary for institutional restoration.

(e) **Restoration Timeline.** The Receiver shall:

- (1) within sixty (60) days, submit a Restoration Plan to Congress identifying the causes of failure and proposed remedies;
- (2) within one hundred eighty (180) days, conduct emergency elections for all vacant elected offices;
- (3) within one (1) year, certify that functioning institutions have been restored or explain why extension is necessary.

(f) **Termination of Receivership.** Federal Political Receivership terminates upon:

- (1) certification by the Receiver that functioning institutions have been restored, confirmed by the Chief Justice;
- (2) expiration of two (2) years from initial certification, unless extended by Congress;
- (3) Congressional resolution terminating the receivership.

(g) **Anti-Abuse Provisions.** Federal Political Receivership may NOT be used:

- (1) to address policy disagreements between the Region and federal government;
- (2) to overturn lawful election results;
- (3) to impose federal policy preferences on Regional exclusive domains;
- (4) as punishment for Regional non-compliance with federal directives.

(h) **Judicial Review.** The certification of Political Institutional Failure and the actions of the Federal Political Receiver are subject to expedited judicial review by the Supreme Court, which shall hear challenges within thirty (30) days.

(i) **Costs.** The costs of Federal Political Receivership shall be:

- (1) initially borne by the federal government;
- (2) recoverable from the Region over ten (10) years following restoration, unless Congress waives recovery upon finding that the failure was caused by circumstances beyond Regional control.

#### Mandatory Path to Restoration

(j) **Restoration Benchmarks.** The Federal Political Receiver's authority is strictly limited to achieving "Restoration Benchmarks" defined by the Supreme Court at the time of certification. These shall include:

- (1) certification of valid voter rolls sufficient for elections;
- (2) seating of a quorum-capable Regional legislature;
- (3) appointment of a functioning Regional Supreme Court;
- (4) establishment of executive capacity to perform Minimum Institutional Capacity functions.
The Court shall apply consistent standards across receiverships, and precedent from prior receivership certifications shall be binding.

(k) **Non-Extension Presumption.** There is a rebuttable presumption against extending a receivership beyond two years. To obtain an extension:

- (1) the President must prove by clear and convincing evidence that "Active Sabotage" by local actors—not merely political instability or policy disagreement—makes restoration impossible;
- (2) Congress must approve the extension by a two-thirds vote of both Houses;
- (3) the Supreme Court must certify that the extension is consistent with constitutional principles and not pretextual.

(l) **Absolute Maximum Duration.** No Federal Political Receivership may exceed five (5) years total duration, regardless of circumstances. Upon reaching the five-year limit:

- (1) the receivership terminates automatically;
- (2) the most recent lawfully constituted Regional government is restored to authority;
- (3) if no such government exists, emergency elections shall be conducted under federal supervision within ninety (90) days, after which federal authority terminates.

(m) **Adversarial Restoration Review.** During the receivership, the Adversarial Review Office (ARO) shall:

- (1) issue quarterly reports on whether the Receiver is exceeding the "Minimum Necessary Power" standard;
- (2) have standing to petition for immediate termination if the Receiver engages in substantive policymaking beyond maintaining existing law;
- (3) monitor for "Mission Creep" where the Receiver attempts to resolve underlying political disagreements rather than institutional failures;
- (4) report directly to the Supreme Court and Congress, bypassing the Executive Branch.

(n) **Voter Re-Entry Trigger.** If the Receiver fails to conduct a certified election within eighteen (18) months:

- (1) the Region's residents may trigger a "Direct Restoration Referendum" by petition signed by five percent (5%) of registered voters from the most recent valid voter roll;
- (2) the referendum shall be administered by the Federal Election Commission, not the Receiver;
- (3) if the referendum passes by majority vote, the receivership terminates within sixty (60) days and the prior legal status quo is restored;
- (4) the Receiver may not campaign against or interfere with the referendum process.

---

## ARTICLE X - FISCAL ARCHITECTURE

### Section 1. Independent Taxing Authority

Each level of government--federal, Regional, State, local--shall possess independent taxing authority sufficient to fulfill its enumerated responsibilities.

#### Regional Revenue Protection

(a) **Prohibition on Targeted Fiscal Nullification.** No State shall enact any law, credit, rebate, deduction, or exemption that:

(1) Specifically targets, offsets, or neutralizes Regional tax liabilities;

(2) Provides tax benefits conditioned on payment of Regional taxes;

(3) Creates priority schemes that systematically subordinate Regional tax collection to State collection;

(4) Offers location-based incentives designed to erode the Regional tax base within the State.

(b) **Rebuttable Presumption.** A State tax provision shall be presumed to violate subsection (a) if:

(1) It was enacted within twenty-four (24) months of a Regional tax increase or new Regional tax;

(2) Its fiscal impact falls disproportionately (greater than 75%) on Regional revenue rather than Federal or general State revenue;

(3) Legislative history or public statements by sponsors reference Regional tax policy.

(c) **Permitted State Tax Policy.** Nothing in this section shall prevent States from:

(1) Establishing general tax credits, deductions, or exemptions that apply regardless of Regional tax status;

(2) Setting State tax rates at any level, including zero;

(3) Competing for business through general economic development incentives not targeted at Regional tax avoidance.

#### Regional Tax Collection Priority

(d) **Concurrent Collection Authority.** Regions shall have independent authority to:

(1) Assess and collect Regional taxes directly from taxpayers without State intermediation;

(2) Establish Regional tax administration agencies with full enforcement powers;

(3) File liens, levy assets, and pursue collection remedies independently of State tax authorities.

(e) **Lien Parity.** Regional tax liens shall have equal priority with State tax liens:

(1) When Regional and State liens attach to the same property on the same date, they share pro rata;

(2) When liens attach on different dates, priority follows standard first-in-time rules regardless of governmental level;

(3) No State may establish categorical priority for State liens over Regional liens.

(f) **Anti-Subordination Clause.** No State bankruptcy, receivership, or fiscal emergency proceeding may subordinate Regional tax claims to State claims or general creditors.

---

### Section 2. No Unfunded Mandates

Mandates imposed on subordinate governments without adequate funding are unenforceable.

---

### Section 3. Equalization

Automatic, formula-based equalization transfers shall ensure baseline governing capacity across Regions.

#### National Benefits Spine Fiscal Alignment

(a) **Co-Payment Requirement.** For any program funded through the National Benefits Spine, the administering Region shall contribute a co-payment from Regional own-source revenue according to the following schedule:

(1) Regions with fiscal capacity above 110% of national median: 20% co-payment;

(2) Regions with fiscal capacity between 90-110% of national median: 15% co-payment;

(3) Regions with fiscal capacity below 90% of national median: 10% co-payment;

(4) Small Regions receiving equalization transfers under Section 3-A: 5% co-payment (minimum).

(b) **Effect on Incentives.** The co-payment requirement ensures that Regional governments bear marginal fiscal consequences for program expansion decisions, aligning authority over administration with responsibility for costs.

#### Efficiency-Indexed Federal Contributions

(c) **Outcome-Based Funding.** The federal government shall provide National Benefits Spine funding sufficient to achieve specified outcome floors at the National Median cost-per-outcome, adjusted for Regional Purchasing Power Parity.

(d) **Purchasing Power Parity Adjustment.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall annually calculate a Regional Cost Index reflecting differences in labor costs, real estate costs, and input prices across Regions. All efficiency comparisons shall use PPP-adjusted figures.

(e) **Funding Adjustment Based on Efficiency.**

(1) **Efficient Regions:** If a Region achieves outcome floors at below-median PPP-adjusted cost, the Region retains 50% of the savings as unrestricted Regional revenue;

(2) **Inefficient Regions:** If a Region exceeds median PPP-adjusted cost while achieving outcome floors, federal funding covers only the median cost; the Region must fund the excess from own-source revenue;

(3) **Underperforming Regions:** If a Region fails to achieve outcome floors regardless of spending, the Region enters Performance Improvement Status.

#### Subsidy-Neutrality Adjustment

(f) **Subsidy-Neutrality Adjustment.** Equalization formulas shall account for Regional tax expenditures:

(1) "Tax expenditures" include tax credits, exemptions, abatements, and other preferential treatments that reduce tax liability for specific industries or firms;

(2) Tax expenditures exceeding two percent (2%) of Regional GDP shall be added back to calculated tax capacity for equalization purposes;

(3) This adjustment treats the Region as if it had collected the forgone revenue.

(g) **Tax Expenditure Reporting.** Each Region shall report annually:

(1) All tax expenditures by category and amount;

(2) The industries or firms benefiting from each expenditure;

(3) The stated policy rationale for each expenditure.

(h) **IFC Verification.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall:

(1) Verify Regional tax expenditure reports;

(2) Apply the subsidy-neutrality adjustment to equalization calculations;

(3) Publish comparative tax expenditure analyses across Regions.

#### Predatory Subsidy Prohibition

(i) **Predatory Subsidy Prohibition.** Regions may not offer subsidies:

(1) Explicitly conditioned on relocation from another Region;

(2) Available only to firms relocating from specific other Regions;

(3) Structured to match or exceed subsidies offered by other Regions in bidding wars.

(1) The subsidy agreement references the firm's current location;

(2) The subsidy is available only to firms not currently operating in the Region;

(3) The subsidy amount varies based on the firm's origin Region.

(k) **Total Subsidy Ceiling.** Regional tax expenditures and direct subsidies combined:

(1) May not exceed five percent (5%) of Regional GDP in any fiscal year;

### Section 3-A. Small Region Support

(a) Equalization transfers under Section 3 shall include a minimum floor for each Region, regardless of formula calculations, sufficient to fund:

- basic Regional administrative functions,
- Regional court operations,
- Regional Guard minimum readiness requirements,
- participation in inter-Regional coordination bodies.

(b) This floor shall be established by statute and may not be reduced below the level necessary to maintain functioning Regional governance.

(c) Small Regions may pool resources through inter-Regional agreements for:

- specialized court functions,
- technical expertise,
- infrastructure management,
- higher education coordination.

(d) Pooling agreements under this section require no federal approval and do not constitute merger.

(e) **Federal Institutional Capacity Support.** For any Region with population below two percent of the total population of the United States:

- (1) The federal government shall provide supplemental funding for Regional court operations, including judicial salaries, court facilities, and administrative staff, sufficient to ensure access to justice equivalent to that available in larger Regions;
- (2) The federal government shall provide technical assistance and shared personnel for specialized regulatory functions that require expertise not economically sustainable at small-region scale;
- (3) Regional Guard forces may be supplemented by federal reserve components under Regional Governor command for non-federalized operations, pursuant to agreement between the Region and the Department of Defense;
- (4) This support is an entitlement, not subject to annual appropriation discretion, and shall be funded through mandatory spending.

- (1) appellate court operations (trial courts may remain independent),
- (2) specialized law enforcement functions (forensics, cybercrime),
- (3) emergency management coordination.

Such pooling shall preserve each Region's sovereignty and independent governance; pooled functions operate under joint authority with equal Regional representation regardless of population.

(g) For purposes of this section, a "Small Region" is one that meets either:

- (1) population below five percent of the total population of the United States, or
- (2) fiscal capacity below the median fiscal capacity of all Regions.

(h) Fiscal capacity shall be measured by the Independent Fiscal Council using a formula that accounts for tax base, cost of living, and geographic factors. The formula shall be established by statute and reviewed every ten years.

---

### Section 4. Anti-Coercion Rule

Conditional funding that effectively compels unrelated policy compliance is unconstitutional.

---

### Section 10. Fiscal Intervention Hierarchy

The IFC fiscal intervention authorities established in this Article proceed in escalating stages. Each stage requires a finding that lesser interventions are insufficient before proceeding to more intensive measures.

(a) **Intervention Stages.**

(1) **Stage 1: Capacity-Based Equalization Adjustment.** The IFC may adjust equalization calculations under Section 3 to account for self-inflicted fiscal weakness, including:

- (A) Capacity-based calculations that treat forgone tax revenue as if collected (subsidy-neutrality adjustment);
- (B) Predatory subsidy prohibition enforcement;
- (C) Tax expenditure reporting requirements.

(2) **Stage 2: Negligence Finding and Clawback.** If capacity adjustment proves insufficient, the IFC may issue a negligence finding upon determining that Regional fiscal distress results from deliberate policy choices rather than external circumstances:

- (A) Strategic incompetence or deliberate under-collection triggers enhanced reporting;
- (B) Equalization transfers reduced to prevent subsidizing self-inflicted harm;
- (C) Clawback of prior transfers if premised on materially misleading fiscal reporting.

(3) **Stage 3: Solvency Certification Suspension.** If negligence finding proves insufficient:

- (A) The IFC may suspend the Region's solvency certification;
- (B) Suspended certification triggers market disclosure requirements;
- (C) Asset quality floors for Regional Development Banks may be imposed;
- (D) Contagion firewalls activated to protect other Regions.

(4) **Stage 4: Financial Conservatorship.** Only if Stages 1-3 prove insufficient may the IFC impose Financial Conservatorship under Section 7, assuming control over Regional borrowing and major fiscal decisions.

(5) **Stage 5: Administrative Receivership.** If the objective trigger in Section 8(a) is met, Administrative Receivership provides the most intensive intervention.

(b) **Escalation Documentation.** Before proceeding to a higher intervention stage, the IFC shall:

(1) Document why lesser interventions have proven insufficient;

(2) Provide the Region thirty (30) days notice and opportunity to respond;

(3) Issue a public finding justifying escalation.

(c) **De-escalation Path.** The IFC shall reduce intervention intensity when the Region demonstrates sustained compliance:

(1) Each stage requires two consecutive quarters of compliance before de-escalation;

(2) De-escalation proceeds one stage at a time;

(3) The Region may not be re-escalated for the same conduct within twelve (12) months of de-escalation.

---

### Section 11. Fiscal Subsidiarity Protection

#### Tax Base Preservation

(a) **Fiscal Subsidiarity Principle.** Regional and Federal taxation shall not collectively render States unable to fund their enumerated duties through reasonable local taxation.

(b) **IFC Tax Burden Certification.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall certify annually:

(1) The combined Federal-Regional-State effective tax rate for each major tax base (income, payroll, property, sales, corporate);

(2) The proportion of each tax base consumed by Federal and Regional taxation;

(3) Whether the remaining tax capacity is sufficient for States to fund enumerated duties.

(c) **Tax Capacity Floor.** States shall retain access to tax capacity sufficient to fund:

(1) K-12 education at the national average per-pupil expenditure;

(2) Local road maintenance at levels sufficient for public safety;

(3) Essential State administrative functions;

(4) The IFC shall calculate a "Minimum State Tax Capacity" for each State.

(d) **Crowding-Out Prohibition.** If Federal and Regional taxation would reduce State access below the Minimum State Tax Capacity:

(1) The IFC shall notify the offending level(s);

(2) The offending level shall reduce rates or provide compensating transfers within one hundred eighty (180) days;

(3) Failure to comply results in automatic transfer from the offending level to affected States.

---

### Section 11-A. Prohibition on Predatory Tax Exportation

(a) **Tax Exportation Defined.** Tax exportation occurs when the economic burden of a Regional or State tax, fee, or assessment falls primarily (greater than sixty percent) on persons or entities residing outside the taxing jurisdiction.

(b) **Tax Exportation Ceiling.** No Region may derive more than twenty-five percent (25%) of its total annual revenue from exported taxes. This ceiling applies to:

- (1) transit fees on inter-Regional energy, data, or transportation corridors;
- (2) severance taxes on resources where the primary consumption occurs outside the Region;
- (3) consumption or sales taxes specifically targeting industries or activities with primarily non-resident participation;
- (4) any other fiscal instrument where the Independent Fiscal Council (IFC) determines the ultimate economic incidence is shifted to non-residents.

(c) **Monopoly Rents Finding.** If a Region possesses a geographic or economic monopoly over a vital national utility (e.g., a primary deep-water port, a national fiber-optic hub, or a trans-continental energy corridor), the IFC shall:

- (1) establish a "Neutral Service Rate" for that utility based on cost-plus-reasonable-margin;
- (2) any revenue collected above this rate shall be deemed "Monopoly Rent" and credited against the Region's equalization transfers.

(d) **Enforcement and Remediation.** If a Region exceeds the Tax Exportation Ceiling:

- (1) the excess revenue shall be placed in an escrow fund administered by the IFC;
- (2) the fund shall be redistributed as "Exportation Rebates" to the Regions whose residents bore the economic burden;
- (3) persistent violations (three consecutive years) shall result in the IFC assuming authority over the Region's tax-rate setting for the offending categories.

(e) **Incidence Determination.** The IFC shall determine economic incidence using standard public finance methodology, considering price elasticities, market structure, and pass-through rates. The IFC's incidence determination is subject to methodological challenge under Article VI, Section 7-A(f).

---

### Section 12. Democratic Accountability for Fiscal Institutions

#### Political Override for Systemic Disputes

(a) **Legitimacy Review Trigger.** If three or more Regions formally declare non-compliance with IFC or ARB determinations within a twelve-month period:

(1) The declarations shall automatically trigger a "Legitimacy Review" requiring Congress to:

- (i) hold public hearings within sixty (60) days on the disputed determinations;
- (ii) vote within one hundred twenty (120) days on whether to affirm, modify, or vacate the disputed determinations;
- (iii) consider structural reforms to the IFC or ARB.

(2) During Legitimacy Review:

- (i) enforcement of disputed determinations is stayed;
- (ii) affected Regions remain subject to baseline constitutional requirements (debt ceilings, no-bailout rule);
- (iii) the IFC and ARB shall participate in hearings and defend their determinations publicly.

(b) **Periodic Reauthorization.** The statutory authorities of the IFC and ARB shall sunset every twelve (12) years unless reauthorized by Congress. Reauthorization shall include:

(1) review of institutional performance;

(2) opportunity for structural reforms;

(3) public comment period.

(c) **Regional Representation in Determinations.** No determination materially adverse to a Region may be made by a panel where no member was appointed by Regional Governors. If such a panel composition occurs due to vacancies or recusals, the determination shall require unanimous agreement of remaining members.

#### Transparency Requirements

(d) **Public Accountability.** The IFC and ARB shall:

(1) publish all deliberations and vote records;

(2) issue plain-language explanations of determinations accessible to non-experts;

(3) maintain public dashboards showing Regional fiscal status and pending matters;

(4) hold annual public meetings in each Region.

#### Non-Compliance Response Ladder

(e) **Graduated Enforcement.** Before any coercive enforcement against a non-compliant Region:

(1) **Stage 1 - Explanation:** The IFC/ARB shall issue a formal explanation and offer technical assistance (30 days);

(2) **Stage 2 - Mediation:** Mediation by a panel including Regional Governor representatives (60 days);

(3) **Stage 3 - Congressional Review:** Congressional review and vote on whether enforcement is appropriate (90 days);

(4) **Stage 4 - Enforcement:** Only after Congressional authorization may coercive measures (conservatorship, receivership) proceed.

(f) **Emergency Exception.** Subsection (e) does not apply when:

(1) the Region's actions pose imminent risk of contagion to other Regions' fiscal stability;

(2) the Region has deliberately structured transactions to evade constitutional limits;

(3) certified by the Chief Justice as requiring immediate intervention.

---

### Section 13. Prohibition on Shadow Currencies and Quasi-Monetary Instruments

(a) **Federal Monetary Exclusivity.** The federal government's exclusive authority over "currency and monetary policy" under Article II, Section 1 includes exclusive authority over all instruments that function as money, regardless of their formal designation.

(b) **Prohibited Regional Instruments.** No Region or State may issue, authorize, or permit the circulation of:

- (1) "Regional credits," "energy credits," "tax-anticipation tokens," or similar instruments that are transferable and accepted for payment of taxes, fees, or utility charges;
- (2) digital tokens, blockchain-based currencies, or other electronic instruments that function as a medium of exchange within Regional commerce;
- (3) scrip, vouchers, or certificates that are designed to circulate as a substitute for federal currency;
- (4) any instrument that, regardless of its formal designation, functions as a store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account within the Regional economy.

(c) **Functional Test.** An instrument shall be deemed a prohibited quasi-currency if it meets any two of the following criteria:

- (1) it is accepted for payment of Regional or State taxes, fees, or charges;
- (2) it is traded on secondary markets or exchanges;
- (3) its aggregate value in circulation exceeds $100 million;
- (4) it is used by more than 10,000 distinct parties in commercial transactions within a twelve-month period;

- (3) refer suspected violations to the Department of Justice for enforcement.

(f) **Enforcement.** Issuance of a prohibited quasi-currency shall result in:

- (1) immediate injunction by federal court;
- (2) mandatory redemption of all outstanding instruments at face value in federal currency;
- (3) civil penalties of up to $10 million per day of continued circulation;
- (4) personal liability for Regional officials who authorized the issuance.

(g) **Federal Reserve Coordination.** The Federal Reserve shall have authority to:

- (1) determine whether an instrument constitutes a prohibited quasi-currency;
- (2) require reporting from Regions on fiscal instruments that approach the thresholds in subsection (c);
- (3) issue cease-and-desist orders for instruments that threaten monetary policy effectiveness.

---

### Section 14. Fiscal Adequacy Determinations

(a) **Definition of Adequate Funding.** A mandate is adequately funded when the resources provided are reasonably sufficient to achieve substantial compliance with the mandate's requirements without requiring the subordinate government to:

- (1) reduce existing services below minimum standards established by law;
- (2) impose taxes or fees exceeding one hundred ten percent of the regional median for comparable jurisdictions; or
- (3) defer essential infrastructure maintenance or capital replacement.

(b) **Fiscal Adequacy Review Board.** The Inter-Regional Fiscal Court shall establish a Fiscal Adequacy Review Board ("FARB") consisting of:

- (1) three economists appointed by the IFC for staggered six-year terms;
- (2) two former State or Regional budget directors appointed by the Council of Governors; and
- (3) two representatives of municipal governments appointed by the National League of Cities.

(c) **Pre-Enactment Fiscal Adequacy Certification.** Before any Federal or Regional mandate takes effect:

- (1) the enacting authority shall submit a Fiscal Adequacy Statement to the FARB estimating compliance costs and identifying funding sources;
- (2) the FARB shall issue a Fiscal Adequacy Determination within sixty days certifying whether proposed funding is adequate;
- (3) if the FARB certifies funding as inadequate, the mandate shall not take effect until funding is increased to adequate levels or the enacting authority demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the FARB's determination was erroneous.

(d) **Post-Enactment Adequacy Challenges.** Any subordinate government subject to a mandate may petition the FARB for a determination that funding has become inadequate due to:

- (1) increased compliance costs exceeding original estimates by more than twenty percent;
- (2) inflation or economic changes materially affecting compliance costs;
- (3) unforeseen implementation requirements; or
- (4) cumulative burden of multiple mandates affecting the same revenue sources.

(e) **Remedies for Inadequate Funding.** Upon determination that a mandate is inadequately funded:

- (1) the subordinate government may suspend compliance with the underfunded portions until adequate funding is provided;
- (2) the enacting authority shall have one hundred eighty days to cure the funding deficiency;
- (3) if not cured, the mandate becomes unenforceable against the petitioning government;
- (4) no penalty, sanction, or loss of other funding may be imposed for non-compliance with an inadequately funded mandate.

(f) **Anti-Circumvention.** No enacting authority may:

- (1) condition unrelated funding on compliance with inadequately funded mandates;
- (2) impose mandates through guidance, interpretation, or enforcement discretion to avoid fiscal adequacy review;
- (3) fragment mandates into smaller components to avoid cumulative burden analysis.

### Section 15. Pre-Ratification Legacy Liabilities

(a) **Legacy Liability Defined.** A "Legacy Liability" is a fiscal or environmental obligation incurred prior to the ratification of this Constitution, specifically including:

- (1) unfunded pension obligations for state and local employees accrued before ratification;
- (2) remediation costs for pre-existing toxic waste or "Superfund" sites designated before ratification;
- (3) decommissioning costs for aging nuclear or industrial facilities constructed before ratification;
- (4) infrastructure debt and deferred maintenance obligations incurred before ratification.

(b) **National Legacy Trust.** There is hereby established a National Legacy Trust ("NLT"), managed by the IFC, to assist Regions burdened by disproportionate industrial or administrative history:

(b-1) **Legacy Burden Factor.** The IFC shall include a "Legacy Burden Factor" in the equalization formula, ensuring that Regions with older infrastructure, higher pension loads, and greater environmental remediation obligations are not fiscally penalized relative to Regions without such historical burdens. The Factor shall be calculated based on:

- (1) per-capita unfunded pension obligations attributable to pre-ratification service;
- (2) per-capita environmental remediation costs for pre-ratification contamination;
- (3) per-capita deferred maintenance on infrastructure constructed before ratification;
- (4) other quantifiable legacy burdens as determined by the IFC.

(b-2) **Federal Backstop for Catastrophic Legacy Harms.** For legacy harms that exceed a Region's fiscal capacity (defined as remediation costs exceeding five percent of Regional GDP), the NLT shall provide direct grants funded by:

- (1) a 0.05% national corporate carbon fee on emissions exceeding sector baselines;
- (2) a 0.05% financial transaction fee on securities trades exceeding $1 million in daily volume;
- (3) appropriations as Congress may provide.

(b-3) **Trust Administration.** The NLT shall:

- (1) receive applications from Regions documenting legacy liabilities;
- (2) verify claims through independent audit;
- (3) prioritize funding based on fiscal impact and public health urgency;
- (4) publish annual reports on legacy liability status nationwide.

(c) **Legacy Liability Sunset.** The Legacy Burden Factor shall be recalculated every ten years and shall phase out over fifty (50) years following ratification:

- (1) the Factor shall remain at full value for the first ten years following ratification;
- (2) beginning in year eleven, the Factor shall decline by two percent (2%) of its initial value annually;
- (3) by year sixty following ratification, the Legacy Burden Factor shall be zero;
- (4) this sunset ensures that legacy equity adjustments address historical burdens without creating permanent entitlements.

(d) **Anti-Manipulation.** No Region may:

- (1) incur new obligations and retroactively classify them as "legacy" liabilities;
- (2) defer maintenance or remediation to increase legacy burden claims;
- (3) manipulate pension assumptions to inflate unfunded liability calculations.
Violations shall result in forfeiture of NLT assistance and clawback of prior disbursements.

## ARTICLE XII - SECESSION, NULLIFICATION, AND DE-ESCALATION

### Section 1. No Secession

No State or Region may secede from the United States.

---

### Section 2. No Nullification

No jurisdiction may nullify constitutional law.

---

### Section 3. De-Escalation

Constitutional conflicts shall be resolved through graduated de-escalation procedures established by statute, prioritizing judicial resolution and avoiding military intervention except as a last resort with multi-key authorization.

The de-escalation sequence shall prioritize:

1. judicial enforcement,
2. administrative remedies,
3. temporary intervention,
4. immediate restoration of self-government upon compliance.

Implementation procedures are established by statute.

#### Imminent Harm Bypass

(a) **Imminent Harm Certification.** The de-escalation sequence may be bypassed if:

(1) The Allocation Review Board certifies imminent harm; or

(2) The Supreme Court certifies imminent harm; or

(3) Both the President and a majority of Regional Governors certify imminent harm.

(b) **Imminent Harm Standards.** Certification requires finding that continued delay poses imminent threat to:

(1) Life or physical safety of persons;

(2) National security or territorial integrity;

(3) The integrity of the National Common Market;

(4) Critical infrastructure necessary for public welfare.

(c) **Expedited Certification.** Imminent harm certification:

(1) Shall be issued within forty-eight (48) hours of request;

(2) May be issued ex parte if exigent circumstances require;

(3) Is not subject to appeal until after federal action concludes.

(d) **Post-Bypass Review.** After imminent harm bypass:

(1) The bypassed de-escalation steps shall be completed retroactively;

(2) If the certification was erroneous, affected parties may recover damages;

(3) Pattern of improper certifications triggers enhanced scrutiny.

#### Stage Time Limits

(e) **Stage Time Limits.** Each stage of the de-escalation sequence has maximum duration:

(1) Initial notification and demand: seventy-two (72) hours;

(2) Administrative mediation: fourteen (14) days;

(3) Judicial review (trial level): thirty (30) days;

(4) Appellate review: fourteen (14) days per level;

(5) Total de-escalation sequence: not to exceed ninety (90) days.

(f) **Automatic Escalation.** Upon expiration of any stage time limit:

(1) The sequence advances automatically to the next stage;

(2) Pending motions or appeals are deemed denied;

(3) No extension may be granted except by unanimous consent of all parties.

(g) **Final Stage Consequence.** Upon expiration of the ninety (90) day total:

(1) All judicial and administrative remedies are deemed exhausted;

(2) Military intervention authority activates automatically;

(3) The Two-Key requirement is satisfied by the exhaustion of alternatives.

#### Bad Faith Participation Finding

(h) **Bad Faith Indicators.** The following constitute evidence of bad faith participation in de-escalation:

(1) Demands that exceed pre-crisis status quo by more than de minimis adjustments;

(2) Failure to attend scheduled mediation sessions without valid excuse;

(3) Continued physical consolidation of contested position during negotiations;

(4) Communication with foreign powers regarding disputed matter during mediation.

(i) **Bad Faith Finding.** Upon finding of bad faith:

(1) The de-escalation sequence terminates immediately;

(2) All pending time limits are deemed expired;

(3) The bad faith actor forfeits the right to further judicial review before federal action.

(j) **Bad Faith Consequences.** The bad faith actor:

(1) Bears all costs of subsequent federal action;

(2) Is estopped from claiming procedural defects;

(3) Responsible officials are personally liable.

#### Anti-Consolidation Measures

(k) **Freeze Order.** Upon initiation of de-escalation sequence:

(1) All parties must maintain positions as of the date of initiation;

(2) Physical fortification, troop movement, or asset seizure is prohibited;

(3) Violation of the freeze order constitutes bad faith.

(l) **Foreign Contact Prohibition.** During de-escalation:

(1) No party may seek foreign recognition, support, or intervention;

(2) No party may negotiate with foreign powers regarding the disputed matter;

(3) Violation of the foreign contact prohibition constitutes bad faith.

(m) **Asset Preservation.** Contested federal assets:

(1) Shall be placed under neutral custodianship (U.S. Marshals or agreed third party);

(2) May not be damaged, sold, or transferred during de-escalation;

(3) Damage or transfer constitutes grounds for immediate federal intervention.

## ARTICLE XIII - CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS

### Section 1. Proposal

Amendments may be proposed by:

- two-thirds of each chamber of Congress, or
- two-thirds of Regional legislatures.

---

### Section 2. Ratification

Amendments require:

- ratification by three-fourths of Regions, and
- approval by a majority of votes cast in a national popular referendum.

No minimum turnout threshold shall be required for the national referendum.

---

### Section 3. Ratification Window

Proposed amendments must be ratified within seven years of proposal. Amendments not ratified within this period expire and must be reproposed to be considered again.

---

### Section 5. Uniform Application

No amendment may apply asymmetrically among Regions.

---

### Section 6. Commentary on Ratification Threshold

(a) The three-fourths Regional ratification requirement combined with national popular referendum creates a dual legitimacy requirement: both geographic diversity (through Regions) and popular support (through referendum).

(b) The high threshold is intentional. Constitutional amendments should require broad consensus across the federated structure. Regional minority protection is a core value of this Constitution.

(c) The number of Regions may change pursuant to Article I, Section 4. Any boundary revision that would change the number of Regions shall include analysis of the effect on amendment thresholds.

(d) The three-fourths requirement applies to Regions as constituted at the time of ratification vote, not at the time of proposal.

---

### Section 3. Federal Floor Interpretation Uniformity

#### Mandatory Federal Certification

(a) **Certification Requirement.** When a Regional court of any level issues a ruling interpreting, applying, or effectively exempting any person, entity, or geographic area from a Federal Floor or Federal Framework, the ruling shall not take effect until:

(1) The Federal Supreme Court declines to review the ruling; or

(2) Ninety (90) days pass without the Federal Supreme Court granting certiorari; or

(3) The Federal Supreme Court affirms the Regional interpretation.

(b) **Expanded Trigger.** For purposes of this Section, a ruling "effectively exempts" if it:

(1) Interprets the scope, applicability, or meaning of a Federal Floor or Framework;

(2) Makes a factual finding that a Federal Floor does not apply to specific conditions, actors, or geographic areas;

(3) Determines that local circumstances render a Federal Floor's specific metrics inapplicable; or

(4) Has the practical effect of suspending Federal Floor enforcement for a class of actors, regardless of doctrinal label.

(c) **Automatic Certiorari for Circuit Splits.** If two or more Regional courts have issued conflicting rulings on the same Federal Floor or Framework provision, the Federal Supreme Court shall grant certiorari within thirty (30) days of the second conflicting ruling. The ninety-day automatic effect provision does not apply to circuit split cases; the ruling remains stayed until federal resolution.

(d) **Status Quo Preservation.** During the certification period:

(1) The pre-ruling legal status quo shall remain in effect;

(2) No permits, licenses, or authorizations may be issued based on the contested interpretation;

(3) Parties may not claim reliance on the Regional interpretation for purposes of grandfather provisions, vested rights, or detrimental reliance.

#### Trial Court Injection Prevention

(e) **Trial Court Injection Prevention.**

(1) Any judicial order by any Regional court at any level that stays, enjoins, or suspends the enforcement of a Federal Floor or Framework shall be immediately transmitted to the National Constitutional Court.

(2) Within fifteen (15) days of transmission, the National Constitutional Court shall conduct a Summary Review and either:

- (i) affirm the stay pending full litigation;
- (ii) vacate the stay and require immediate enforcement; or
- (iii) modify the stay with conditions.

(3) Failure to transmit a stay order within forty-eight (48) hours renders the stay void.

(4) This subsection applies regardless of the stage of litigation; trial court injunctions receive the same immediate federal review as appellate rulings.

#### Anti-Reliance Rule

(f) **Reliance Prohibited.** No party may claim vested rights, grandfather status, detrimental reliance, or equitable estoppel based on a Regional court interpretation of a Federal Floor or Framework if:

(1) The interpretation is subject to pending certification under subsection (a);

(2) The interpretation conflicts with interpretations issued by other Regional courts;

(3) A petition for Federal Supreme Court review is pending or has been filed; or

(4) The Federal Supreme Court has granted certiorari.

(g) **Investment Risk Notice.** Permits, licenses, and authorizations issued during contested interpretation periods shall bear a "Contested Interpretation Notice" warning that:

(1) The underlying legal interpretation is subject to federal review;

(2) The permit holder bears the risk of interpretation reversal;

(3) No grandfather rights, reliance claims, or equitable defenses will apply.

(h) **Remediation Liability.** Parties who proceed under a contested interpretation bear full remediation costs if the interpretation is subsequently overturned, including:

(1) Costs of achieving compliance with the correct interpretation;

(2) Environmental remediation or cleanup costs;

(3) Back wages or benefits owed under the correct interpretation;

(4) Civil penalties for the period of non-compliance;

without offset for investments made during the uncertainty period, and without defense of good faith reliance on the Regional interpretation.

---

## ARTICLE XI-RF - REGIONAL GUARD FORCES

### Section 1. Establishment of Regional Guard Forces

(a) Each Region may maintain Regional Guard Forces for:

- disaster response within the Region,
- support of civil authorities at Regional Governor request,
- defense of Regional territory in coordination with federal forces.

(b) Regional Guard Forces are under the command of the Regional Governor except when called into federal service.

---

### Section 2. Federalization of Regional Guard

(a) Regional Guard Forces may be called into federal service:

- upon declaration of war by Congress,
- upon authorization for use of military force approved by two-thirds of the House and Senate,
- for domestic deployment pursuant to two-key authorization (as defined by the Military Civilian Control Amendment if adopted, or by subsection (g) of this section).

(b) When called into federal service, Regional Guard units are commanded by the President through the chain of command.

(c) Federalization for domestic purposes may not exceed ninety days without consent of the affected Region's Governor.

(d) A Regional Governor may refuse federalization of that Region's Guard Forces if:

- no two-key authorization has been obtained, or
- the federalization order directs action against that Governor's own Region.

(e) If the Regional Governor position is vacant or if the Governor has been removed by federal action, the refusal authority under subsection (d) shall be exercised by the acting Governor under Regional succession law, or if none, by the presiding officer of the Regional legislature.

(f) Federalization of a Region's Guard is prohibited for 180 days following removal of that Region's Governor by federal action, unless:

- (1) approved by two-thirds of the Regional legislature, or
- (2) approved by a majority of all other Regional Governors, or
- (3) authorized by the Supreme Court upon finding genuine emergency unrelated to the removal.

(g) **Default Two-Key Authorization.** If the Military Civilian Control Amendment is not adopted, "two-key authorization" for purposes of this article means authorization for domestic deployment of armed forces that requires approval from both:

- (1) **Key 1:** The President (or, if the President is unavailable or incapacitated, the next civilian in the line of succession), and
- (2) **Key 2:** A majority of Regional Governors, or if deployment is limited to a single Region, the Governor of that Region.

Two-key authorization may not be waived, delegated to military officers, or satisfied by implied consent. Deployment without two-key authorization is unlawful and may be refused by commanders without penalty.

(h) **Emergency Response Acceleration.** Notwithstanding subsection (g), the following expedited procedures apply to time-sensitive emergencies:

- (1) **Automatic Approval for Infrastructure Attacks.** When the President certifies that a cyber-physical attack on critical infrastructure (energy grid, water systems, communications networks, transportation systems) requires immediate military response, Regional Governors shall have forty-eight (48) hours to respond to a two-key authorization request. Failure to respond within forty-eight hours shall be deemed consent for the specific deployment requested, limited to defending the affected infrastructure.

- (2) **Supermajority Override.** If five of seven Regional Governors affirmatively authorize deployment, the authorization is valid even if the remaining Governors actively refuse, provided the deployment does not target the refusing Governors' Regions.

- (3) **Judicial Emergency Key.** If a majority of Regional Governors cannot be reached or fail to respond within forty-eight hours during a verified emergency, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court may, upon petition by the President and certification by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that delay poses imminent risk of mass casualties, authorize deployment for up to seventy-two (72) hours pending Governor response. This judicial authorization:
    - (i) requires the Chief Justice to find clear and convincing evidence of imminent threat;
    - (ii) may not be used for any deployment targeting domestic political activity, protests, or civil disturbances;
    - (iii) automatically terminates after seventy-two hours unless Governor majority consent is obtained;
    - (iv) shall be reported to Congress within twenty-four hours.

- (4) **Anti-Brinkmanship Provision.** A Regional Governor who withholds two-key consent while simultaneously demanding unrelated policy concessions from the President shall be deemed to have waived the consent requirement for that authorization request. The Allocation Review Board shall determine whether such conditioning has occurred, with expedited seventy-two-hour review.

#### Constitutional Compliance Enforcement

(i) **Constitutional Compliance Enforcement Exception.** Notwithstanding subsection (d), a Regional Governor may not invoke the refusal authority to shield the Region from enforcement of:

- (1) final, non-appealable rulings of the Allocation Review Board;
- (2) final, non-appealable rulings of the Supreme Court;
- (3) federal court orders enforcing constitutional provisions of this Constitution.

(j) **Alternative Enforcement Mechanisms.** When Guard federalization is unavailable or refused under subsection (d), the federal government retains authority to enforce constitutional compliance through:

- (1) fiscal measures authorized under Article X, including withholding of federal transfers and equalization payments;
- (2) federal marshals and civilian law enforcement agencies;
- (3) assumption of operational control over specific infrastructure under Article I, Section 6(o);
- (4) judicial contempt proceedings against responsible officials, including personal fines and incarceration;
- (5) disqualification of non-compliant Regional officials from future federal office.

(k) **Escalation Ladder.** Before any enforcement action under subsection (j), the federal government shall:

- (1) provide written notice specifying the violation and required remediation;
- (2) allow thirty (30) days for voluntary compliance;
- (3) offer mediation through the ARB;
- (4) obtain judicial certification that non-compliance is willful.

(l) **Anti-Militarization Principle.** The limitations on Guard federalization in subsection (d) reflect the constitutional preference for civilian, fiscal, and judicial enforcement mechanisms over military force in resolving intergovernmental disputes. Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize military action against civilian populations.

---

### Section 3. Integration with State National Guard

(a) State National Guard units continue in existence within the Regional structure.

(b) State National Guard units may be placed under Regional command by agreement between the State and Regional governments.

(c) The Governor of each State retains authority over State National Guard units for State emergencies unless such units have been federalized or placed under Regional command.

(d) State Defense Forces under exclusive State control may be maintained and are not subject to federalization.

(e) Coordination Requirements. State National Guard and Regional Guard Forces shall maintain:

- (1) interoperable communications and command systems,
- (2) joint training exercises at least annually,
- (3) mutual aid agreements specifying support protocols,
- (4) clear precedence rules when operating in same theater.

(f) During concurrent operations, the senior Regional Guard commander shall coordinate overall response unless the emergency is confined to a single State and the Regional Governor has not declared a Regional emergency.

(g) Nothing in this section shall be construed to subordinate State National Guard units to Regional command without agreement under subsection (b), except during federalization or declared Regional emergency requiring unified command.

---

## ARTICLE XVII-RF - REGIONAL EMERGENCY AUTHORITY

### Section 1. Regional Governor Declaration Authority

(a) Regional Governors may declare emergencies for matters within Regional constitutional authority.

(b) Regional emergency declarations are subject to the same requirements as federal declarations under the Emergency Powers Reform Amendment:

- written declaration specifying nature, geographic scope, powers to be exercised, duration, and termination conditions,
- publication and transmission to Regional legislature within twenty-four hours,
- category-specific powers only,
- time limits and reauthorization requirements.

(c) Regional emergencies may not exceed the jurisdiction of the declaring Region. Multi-Regional emergencies require either:

- coordinated declarations by affected Regional Governors, or
- federal declaration by the President.

---

### Section 2. Regional Legislature Reauthorization

(a) Regional emergencies may be extended by majority vote of the Regional legislature for thirty-day periods, up to the maximum duration specified in the Emergency Powers Reform Amendment.

(b) After reaching maximum duration, a Regional emergency may only be renewed by:

- a two-thirds vote of the Regional legislature, and
- approval by the Regional Supreme Court.

(c) Any Regional emergency not reauthorized before expiration terminates automatically. All Regional emergency powers cease immediately.

#### Anti-Ratcheting and Cooling-Off Requirements

(e) **Prohibition on Sequential Category Switching.** No Governor may declare an emergency under a different category within thirty days of the termination or expiration of a prior emergency if:

- (1) the new declaration addresses substantially the same underlying conditions as the prior emergency;
- (2) the primary purpose of the new declaration is to obtain powers unavailable under the prior category; or
- (3) the cumulative duration of sequential emergency declarations addressing the same conditions would exceed the maximum renewal limits established for the original category.

(f) **Cooling-Off Period.** Following termination of any Regional emergency that reached its maximum renewal limit under subsection (d), no new emergency of the same category addressing substantially similar conditions may be declared for a period of one hundred eighty days, unless:

- (1) a genuinely new triggering event occurs that is independent of the prior emergency conditions; and
- (2) the Regional Assembly certifies by two-thirds vote that the new declaration is not an attempt to circumvent renewal limits.

(g) **Cumulative Duration Tracking.** The Regional Arbiter shall maintain a public registry of all emergency declarations, their categories, stated justifications, and cumulative durations. Any pattern of declarations that cumulatively exceeds twice the single-emergency maximum duration for a category within any five-year period shall trigger mandatory review by the Regional Assembly, which must affirmatively vote to permit any further declarations of that category.

(h) **Judicial Review of Successive Declarations.** Any resident of the Region may challenge a successive emergency declaration as violating this section. Courts shall apply strict scrutiny, requiring the Governor to demonstrate that the new declaration addresses genuinely distinct conditions and is not designed to evade the limitations of this Article.

---

### Section 3. Coordination with Federal Emergency Powers

(a) Federal emergencies supersede conflicting Regional emergencies within the geographic scope of the federal declaration.

(b) Regional Governors may request federal emergency assistance. Such requests do not require Regional emergency declaration.

(c) Regional Guard Forces may be deployed under Regional emergency authority without federal approval, subject to the limitations in Article XI-RF.

---

## ARTICLE XVIII - SUPREMACY AND CONSTRUCTION

### Section 1. Enumerated Powers Supremacy

Only powers expressly granted to the federal government by this Constitution are valid exercises of federal authority. This section reinforces Article II, Section 1; powers not enumerated to the federal government are reserved to the Regions, States, or the People.

---

### Section 2. Floor Presumption

Rights and standards shall be construed as floors unless explicitly stated otherwise.

---

### Section 3. Interpretive Conventions

(a) Capitalized terms "Region," "State," "Tribal Nation," and "Territory" refer to constitutional entities established or recognized by this Constitution.

(b) "Tribal Nation" means a federally recognized Tribal Nation unless otherwise specified. The inherent sovereignty acknowledged in Article XX, Section 3 is not limited to federally recognized Tribal Nations, but constitutional protections and coordination requirements under this Constitution apply to federally recognized Tribal Nations as a matter of practical administration. See Article XXII, Section 1(d).

(c) References to "Regional" institutions (Regional Governor, Regional legislature, Regional courts) use initial capitalization to denote constitutional status.

(d) "Federal" refers to the national government of the United States.

---

## ARTICLE XIX - RATIFICATION AND TRANSITION

### Section 1. Effect Upon Ratification

This amendment package shall take effect upon ratification pursuant to its own terms.

---

### Section 2. Transition Authority

(b) **Transitional Senate Representation.** Until Regional assignment is completed, District Senators serve as at-large members of the Senate with full voting rights. Upon Regional assignment, District Senators join the assigned Region's delegation for purposes of Senate organization, while continuing to be elected by District residents.

(c) Within five years, Congress shall determine the District's permanent status: admission as a State with Regional assignment, or Regional assignment while preserving federal district status.

(d) Regional assignment requires approval by two-thirds of the receiving Region's legislature and by majority referendum of District residents. No assignment may take effect within one year before or six months after a federal presidential election.

(e) Implementation procedures are established by statute.

---

### Section 2. Territories

(a) Residents of United States territories shall be entitled to participate in federal elections and to Congressional representation. Congress shall assign each territory to a Region based on geographic proximity, historical connection, or economic integration.

(b) **Transitional Congressional Representation.** Until Regional assignment is completed:

(d) Congress shall establish a clear path for each territory to petition for statehood, Regional assignment without statehood, or continued territorial status with defined representation. No territory may be held indefinitely without a defined governance status.

(e) Implementation procedures are established by statute.

---

### Section 3. Tribal Nations

(a) The inherent sovereignty of federally recognized Tribal Nations is hereby reaffirmed. Tribal Nations possess original sovereignty that predates this Constitution and exists independent of federal recognition.

(b) Tribal Nations are not subordinate political subdivisions of the federal government, Regions, States, or territories. The relationship between the United States and Tribal Nations is government-to-government, nation-to-nation.

(c) Tribal lands remain under tribal jurisdiction. Federal authority over tribal lands is limited to that arising from treaties, trust responsibilities, and powers expressly consented to by Tribal Nations. Regional and State authority does not extend to tribal lands except by consent of the affected Tribal Nation.

(d) Regions and Tribal Nations shall enter into compacts for coordination of shared services, infrastructure, and emergency response. Such compacts shall be negotiated in good faith and shall respect tribal sovereignty.

(e) Tribal Nations may, at their option, designate representatives to participate in Regional assemblies. The nature of such participation (voting, non-voting, observer) shall be determined by agreement between each Tribal Nation and the relevant Region.

(f) Nothing in this Constitution diminishes any treaty rights, trust responsibilities, or obligations of the United States to Tribal Nations.

---

## ARTICLE XXI - IMPLEMENTATION AND DEFAULT RULES

### Section 1. Congressional Implementation Duty

Congress shall enact enabling legislation to implement this Constitution, including but not limited to:

- an Allocation Framework Act defining jurisdictional boundaries and spillover criteria,
- a Fiscal Equalization Act establishing transfer formulas and the Independent Fiscal Council,
- an Elections Implementation Act specifying procedures for federal elections under Regional administration.

---

### Section 2. Default Rules Upon Congressional Failure

(a) If Congress fails to enact the Allocation Framework Act within two years of ratification, the allocation of powers shall be governed by existing federal-state divisions, with Regions exercising authority over matters previously requiring interstate compacts.

(b) If Congress fails to enact the Fiscal Equalization Act within three years of ratification, equalization transfers shall be calculated as flat per-capita grants at a baseline level equal to five percent of federal revenues, distributed to Regions with below-median fiscal capacity.

(b-1) **IFC Adjustment Authority.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall have authority to adjust the default formula annually to maximize regional fiscal capacity equalization, subject to the following:

(1) The five percent rate is a ceiling for default transfers; Congress may enact higher rates by statute;

(2) The default rate does not decline over time absent Congressional action;

(3) Congressional inaction costs Donor Regions (higher automatic transfers) rather than Recipient Regions (declining transfers), inverting the incentive structure to encourage legislative engagement.

(b-2) **Annual Capacity Assessment.** The IFC shall publish annually:

(1) Regional fiscal capacity indices;

(2) Equalization transfer recommendations;

(3) Assessment of whether current transfers achieve constitutional equalization goals.

(b-3) **Emergency Adjustment Trigger.** If the IFC determines that:

(1) Regional fiscal capacity divergence exceeds twenty-five percent (25%) from baseline; OR

(2) Any Region cannot meet basic governmental functions due to fiscal constraints; OR

(3) Economic shocks have rendered existing formulas inadequate;

the IFC may adjust the default transfer formula within the five percent ceiling.

(b-4) **Emergency Adjustment Limitations.** IFC emergency adjustments:

(1) May not exceed twenty percent (20%) change from prior year formula;

(2) Require published justification;

(3) Are subject to Congressional override by simple majority within ninety (90) days.

(b-5) **Anti-Obstruction Provisions.** Fiscal Equalization Acts shall receive expedited consideration:

(1) Privileged motion status in both chambers;

(2) Limited debate time (twenty hours per chamber);

(3) No amendments not germane to fiscal equalization;

(4) Guaranteed floor vote within sixty (60) days of committee reporting.

(b-6) **Poison Pill Prohibition.** Provisions in a Fiscal Equalization Act that:

(1) Address matters unrelated to fiscal equalization;

(2) Would require supermajority approval under other constitutional provisions;

(3) Are designed to make the Act unacceptable to Recipient Regions;

are severable and may be struck by the ARB without invalidating the remainder.

(c) If Congress fails to enact the Elections Implementation Act within two years of ratification, the following default rules apply:

- The national popular vote requirement of Article VII, Section 2 remains in full force.
- Administrative procedures (voter registration, ballot design, counting methods) shall follow prior federal law as adapted for Regional administration.
- Regions assume the administrative role previously held by States.
- Any provisions of prior federal law inconsistent with the national popular vote requirement (including the Electoral College) are superseded and inapplicable.
- If no candidate receives a majority of votes cast, a runoff election between the two candidates receiving the most votes shall be held within twenty-one days. If Congress has enacted a different majority mechanism (such as ranked-choice voting or instant runoff), that mechanism supersedes this default.

(d) If Congress fails to enact appropriations for any fiscal year by the start of that fiscal year, the following automatic fiscal continuation shall apply:

- Spending shall continue at the prior fiscal year's enacted levels for all previously authorized programs.
- Prior-year levels shall be adjusted by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or by a successor index designated by statute.
- No new programs, expansions of existing programs, or new spending initiatives may be funded under automatic continuation.
- Automatic continuation terminates upon enactment of appropriations for the affected fiscal year.

(e) Default rules remain in effect until Congress enacts superseding legislation.
