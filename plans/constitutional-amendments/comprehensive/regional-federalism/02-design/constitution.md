## Preamble

We, the People of the United States, in order to preserve the Union, restore democratic legitimacy, secure liberty against concentration of power, and ensure that self-government remains possible in a large and diverse republic, do hereby amend the Constitution to establish a system of **Regional Federalism**.

This amendment package is adopted to:

- preserve national unity without coercive uniformity,
- and ensure that no single institution may dominate the constitutional order.

## ARTICLE III - RIGHTS FLOORS AND SUBSIDIARITY

### Section 1. Floors, Not Ceilings

Federal rights and standards establish minimum protections only.

No federal law shall be interpreted to prohibit a Region or State from exceeding such protections unless explicitly stated.

---

### Section 2. Subsidiarity with Enforcement

Authority resides at the lowest level capable of exercising it effectively, subject to judicial enforcement of constitutional boundaries.

---

### Section 3. Hierarchy of Law

(a) This Constitution is the supreme law of the United States.

(b) Within their respective spheres:

- Federal law enacted pursuant to enumerated federal powers is supreme over conflicting Regional, State, or local law.
- Regional law enacted pursuant to enumerated Regional powers is supreme over conflicting State or local law within the Region.

(c) State Constitutions.

(1) State constitutions may not conflict with this Constitution or with the Regional constitution of the Region in which the State is located.

### Section 4-A. Senate Concurrence for Constitutional Safeguards (Proposed)

> **Note:** This section is a proposed optional enhancement. See the [Senate Safeguard Concurrence Amendment](proposals/senate-safeguard-concurrence-act.md) for full text and analysis.

Senate concurrence by majority vote may be required for legislation affecting constitutional safeguards, including emergency powers, domestic armed force deployment, election administration, judicial structure, de-escalation procedures, and allocation of powers.

### Section 5. Federal Lawmaking

(a) Bills within enumerated federal powers may be introduced in the House of Representatives.

For bills affecting interregional coordination (shared natural resources, equalization formulas, Regional mandates, boundary procedures), the Senate may delay presentation to the President to propose amendments, but cannot permanently block legislation.

- (1) The Senate must complete review within 60 days of receiving a bill from the House. If no action is taken within 60 days, the bill shall be automatically presented to the President.
- (2) If the Senate proposes amendments, the House may accept, reject, or modify them within 30 days. The House's final action is conclusive.
- (3) The Senate may invoke review by majority vote within 10 days of House passage. Failure to invoke review waives the delay authority.

## ARTICLE XIII - CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS

### Section 1. Proposal

Amendments may be proposed by:

- ratification by three-fourths of Regions, and
- approval by a majority of votes cast in a national popular referendum.

---

### Section 5. Uniform Application

No amendment may apply asymmetrically among Regions.

---

### Section 6. Commentary on Ratification Threshold

(a) The three-fourths Regional ratification requirement combined with national popular referendum creates a dual legitimacy requirement: both geographic diversity (through Regions) and popular support (through referendum).

(b) The high threshold is intentional. Constitutional amendments should require broad consensus across the federated structure. Regional minority protection is a core value of this Constitution.

(c) The number of Regions may change pursuant to Article I, Section 4. Any boundary revision that would change the number of Regions shall include analysis of the effect on amendment thresholds.

(d) The three-fourths requirement applies to Regions as constituted at the time of ratification vote, not at the time of proposal.

(e) If the Regional Governor position is vacant or if the Governor has been removed by federal action, the refusal authority under subsection (d) shall be exercised by the acting Governor under Regional succession law, or if none, by the presiding officer of the Regional legislature.

(f) Federalization of a Region's Guard is prohibited for 180 days following removal of that Region's Governor by federal action, unless:

- (1) approved by two-thirds of the Regional legislature, or
- (2) approved by a majority of all other Regional Governors, or
- (3) authorized by the Supreme Court upon finding genuine emergency unrelated to the removal.

(g) **Default Two-Key Authorization.** If the Military Civilian Control Amendment is not adopted, "two-key authorization" for purposes of this article means authorization for domestic deployment of armed forces that requires approval from both:

- (1) **Key 1:** The President (or, if the President is unavailable or incapacitated, the next civilian in the line of succession), and
- (2) **Key 2:** A majority of Regional Governors, or if deployment is limited to a single Region, the Governor of that Region.

## ARTICLE XVII-RF - REGIONAL EMERGENCY AUTHORITY

*This article presumes adoption of the Emergency Powers Reform Amendment or an equivalent provision establishing categorized emergency powers (natural disaster, public health, economic, security, constitutional crisis), enumerated powers by category, time limits and reauthorization requirements, judicial review standards, restoration mandate, habeas corpus protections, prohibition on emergency expansion of power, and constitutional crisis definition.*

---

### Section 3. Interpretive Conventions

(a) Capitalized terms "Region," "State," "Tribal Nation," and "Territory" refer to constitutional entities established or recognized by this Constitution.

## ARTICLE XX - NON-STATE ENTITIES

### Section 1. District of Columbia

(a) The District of Columbia shall be entitled to representation in Congress as if it were a State, including Representatives apportioned by population and two Senators. This representation is immediate upon ratification.

(b) Within five years, Congress shall determine the District's permanent status: admission as a State with Regional assignment, or Regional assignment while preserving federal district status.

(c) Regional assignment requires approval by two-thirds of the receiving Region's legislature and by majority referendum of District residents. No assignment may take effect within one year before or six months after a federal presidential election.

(d) Implementation procedures are established by statute.

---

### Section 2. Territories

(a) Residents of United States territories shall be entitled to participate in federal elections. Congress shall assign each territory to a Region based on geographic proximity, historical connection, or economic integration.

(b) Regional assignment requires approval by two-thirds of the receiving Region's legislature and may be rejected by territorial referendum. No assignment may take effect within one year before or six months after a federal presidential election.

(c) Congress shall establish a clear path for each territory to petition for statehood, Regional assignment without statehood, or continued territorial status with defined representation. No territory may be held indefinitely without a defined governance status.

(d) Implementation procedures are established by statute.

---

### Section 3. Tribal Nations

(a) The inherent sovereignty of federally recognized Tribal Nations is hereby reaffirmed. Tribal Nations possess original sovereignty that predates this Constitution and exists independent of federal recognition.

(b) Tribal Nations are not subordinate political subdivisions of the federal government, Regions, States, or territories. The relationship between the United States and Tribal Nations is government-to-government, nation-to-nation.

(c) Tribal lands remain under tribal jurisdiction. Federal authority over tribal lands is limited to that arising from treaties, trust responsibilities, and powers expressly consented to by Tribal Nations. Regional and State authority does not extend to tribal lands except by consent of the affected Tribal Nation.

(d) Regions and Tribal Nations shall enter into compacts for coordination of shared services, infrastructure, and emergency response. Such compacts shall be negotiated in good faith and shall respect tribal sovereignty.

(e) Tribal Nations may, at their option, designate representatives to participate in Regional assemblies. The nature of such participation (voting, non-voting, observer) shall be determined by agreement between each Tribal Nation and the relevant Region.

(f) Nothing in this Constitution diminishes any treaty rights, trust responsibilities, or obligations of the United States to Tribal Nations.

## ARTICLE XXI - IMPLEMENTATION AND DEFAULT RULES

### Section 1. Congressional Implementation Duty

Congress shall enact enabling legislation to implement this Constitution, including but not limited to:

- an Allocation Framework Act defining jurisdictional boundaries and spillover criteria,
- a Fiscal Equalization Act establishing transfer formulas and the Independent Fiscal Council,
- an Elections Implementation Act specifying procedures for federal elections under Regional administration.

---

### Section 2. Default Rules Upon Congressional Failure

(a) If Congress fails to enact the Allocation Framework Act within two years of ratification, the allocation of powers shall be governed by existing federal-state divisions, with Regions exercising authority over matters previously requiring interstate compacts.

(b) If Congress fails to enact the Fiscal Equalization Act within three years of ratification, equalization transfers shall be calculated as flat per-capita grants at a baseline level equal to five percent of federal revenues, distributed to Regions with below-median fiscal capacity. This default rate shall decline by one percentage point per year beginning in year six, reaching a floor of two percent, to incentivize congressional action rather than reward inaction.

(c) If Congress fails to enact the Elections Implementation Act within two years of ratification, the following default rules apply:

- The national popular vote requirement of Article VII, Section 2 remains in full force.
- Administrative procedures (voter registration, ballot design, counting methods) shall follow prior federal law as adapted for Regional administration.
- Regions assume the administrative role previously held by States.
- Any provisions of prior federal law inconsistent with the national popular vote requirement (including the Electoral College) are superseded and inapplicable.
- If no candidate receives a majority of votes cast, a runoff election between the two candidates receiving the most votes shall be held within twenty-one days. If Congress has enacted a different majority mechanism (such as ranked-choice voting or instant runoff), that mechanism supersedes this default.

(d) If Congress fails to enact appropriations for any fiscal year by the start of that fiscal year, the following automatic fiscal continuation shall apply:

- Spending shall continue at the prior fiscal year's enacted levels for all previously authorized programs.
- Prior-year levels shall be adjusted by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or by a successor index designated by statute.
- No new programs, expansions of existing programs, or new spending initiatives may be funded under automatic continuation.
- Automatic continuation terminates upon enactment of appropriations for the affected fiscal year.

(e) Default rules remain in effect until Congress enacts superseding legislation.

---

### Section 3. Purpose

These default rules exist to prevent deliberate nonimplementation from becoming a method of constitutional sabotage. The Constitution shall operate even if Congress fails to act.

---

### Schedule Notes

(a) The District of Columbia is not assigned to any Region upon ratification. Its Regional assignment shall be determined pursuant to Article XX, Section 1(b).

(b) United States territories are not assigned to any Region upon ratification. Their Regional assignment shall be determined pursuant to Article XX, Section 2(a).

(c) Tribal lands within State boundaries remain under tribal and federal jurisdiction as provided in Article XX, Section 3.

(d) These initial boundaries are based on geographic, economic, and demographic considerations as of ratification. Future boundary revisions shall follow the process established in Article I, Section 4.

(e) Population and Fiscal Capacity Considerations.

(1) Regions vary substantially in population. As of ratification, approximate populations are:

- Northeast: 60 million
- Southeast: 75 million
- Midwest: 52 million
- Great Plains: 14 million
- Southwest: 52 million
- Pacific: 55 million
- Mountain: 3 million

(2) Population disparity is an intentional feature of this Constitution, not a defect. Regions are defined by geographic, economic, and cultural coherence, not population equality.

(3) Small-population Regions are protected by:

- equal representation in the Senate,
- equalization transfers ensuring baseline fiscal capacity (Article X, Section 3),
- the boundary revision process, which allows but does not compel merger (Article I, Section 4),
- inter-Regional cooperation agreements permitting shared institutions (Article I, Section 5).

(4) Small Regions may petition for boundary revision to join an adjacent Region, but may not be compelled to merge.

(f) Minimum Regional Capacity.

(1) Each Region must maintain minimum institutional capacity to:

- administer elections,
- operate Regional courts,
- maintain Regional Guard Forces,
- participate in Senate representation.

(2) If a Region's population falls below one-half of one percent of the total population of the United States, or if a Region demonstrates inability to maintain minimum institutional capacity, the Independent Boundary Review Commission shall conduct a special review within one year and may recommend:

- merger with an adjacent Region,
- enhanced inter-Regional cooperation agreements,
- federal technical assistance.

(3) Any merger recommendation under this subsection requires the same approval process as other boundary revisions under Article I, Section 4.

## OFFICIAL COMMENTARY (NON-BINDING)

### Purpose

This Constitution is designed not for consensus, but for survival.

It assumes:

- polarization,
- bad faith,
- institutional stress,
- and periodic crisis.

It rejects:

- exit politics,
- domination through centralization,
- governance by emergency,
- judicial policymaking,
- and militarized politics.

---

### Core Design Philosophy

1. **Distribute power**
2. **Lower existential stakes**
3. **Preserve real self-government**
4. **Make abuse slow, visible, and reversible**
5. **Prefer restoration over punishment**

---

### Interpretive Directive

Where ambiguity exists, interpreters shall prefer:

- decentralization over concentration,
- process enforcement over outcome imposition,
- restoration over escalation,
- democratic legitimacy over efficiency.

---

### Final Statement

This Constitution does not promise harmony.

It promises something more realistic:

> **That disagreement will not destroy the Republic.**
