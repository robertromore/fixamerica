# Regional Federal Constitution

## Regional Federalism Constitutional Text

*This document contains the Regional Federalism amendment package. It is designed as a **modular** constitutional framework that works in conjunction with companion national reforms.*

### Modular Architecture

This constitution includes:

- **Articles I-V**: Regional structure, allocation of powers, rights, legislative and executive branches
- **Article X**: Fiscal architecture
- **Article XII-XIII**: Secession/de-escalation and amendment process
- **Articles XIV-RF, XI-RF, XVII-RF**: Region-specific provisions for judiciary, armed forces, and emergency powers (these supplement companion national amendments)
- **Articles XVIII-XXII**: Supremacy, transition, non-state entities, implementation, definitions

**Companion National Amendments** (in `single-topic/`): The following articles are reserved for standalone national reforms that work with or without Regional Federalism:

- **Article VII**: Elections Reform Amendment (national popular vote, certification procedures)
- **Article VIII**: Impeachment Reform Amendment (procedures, standards)
- **Article IX**: Lobbying and Anti-Corruption Amendment (ethics, lobbying rules)
- **Article XI**: Military Civilian Control Amendment (two-key authorization, deployment limits)

## Preamble

We, the People of the United States, in order to preserve the Union, restore democratic legitimacy, secure liberty against concentration of power, and ensure that self-government remains possible in a large and diverse republic, do hereby amend the Constitution to establish a system of **Regional Federalism**.

This amendment package is adopted to:

- align governance with modern economic and social reality,
- reduce existential political conflict,
- prevent authoritarian consolidation,
- preserve national unity without coercive uniformity,
- and ensure that no single institution may dominate the constitutional order.

## ARTICLE I - REGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES

### Section 1. Establishment of Regions

The United States shall be composed of multiple **Regions**, each consisting of a grouping of States, established by this Constitution and alterable only by constitutional amendment or the boundary revision process specified herein.

Regions are permanent constitutional entities and are not administrative subdivisions of the federal government.

---

### Section 2. Legal Status

Regions possess inherent governing authority within their enumerated powers, derived from the People of the Region and recognized by this Constitution.

No Region is sovereign. Sovereignty resides in the People of the United States.

---

### Section 3. Regional Constitutions

Each Region shall adopt a republican constitution consistent with:

- this Constitution,
- federal rights floors,
- democratic process guarantees.

Regional constitutions shall provide for:

- universal suffrage,
- independent redistricting processes,
- proportionality and competitiveness standards for elections,
- explicit protection against domination by any single metropolitan area or rural bloc.

The structural form of Regional government (unicameral or bicameral legislature, electoral system) shall be determined by each Region, subject to the foregoing requirements.

---

### Section 4. Regional Boundary Revision

(a) Regional boundaries may be revised without full constitutional amendment through a process requiring:

- an Independent Boundary Review Commission to assess and recommend changes,
- approval by two-thirds of the legislature of each affected Region,
- approval by national popular referendum.

(b) The Commission shall be structured to ensure independence from partisan control, with members drawn from multiple appointing authorities and subject to disqualification for recent partisan activity.

(c) Congress shall establish by statute the criteria for boundary revision, Commission procedures, and referendum processes.

(d) No boundary revision may be proposed, voted upon, or take effect within one year before or six months after a federal presidential election.

(e) Implementation procedures are established by statute.

#### State Transfer Mechanism

(f) **Tiered Transfer Approval.** A State may transfer from one Region to another pursuant to the following procedures:

| Transfer Type | Threshold | Requirements |
|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Bilateral Agreement** | Supermajority (2/3) of both Regional legislatures + State referendum (55%) | Consent from all affected parties |
| **Unilateral Departure** | State referendum (60%) + ARB certification + 3-year waiting period | Higher bar for non-consensual departure |
| **Contested Transfer** | Supreme Court determination | Prevents hostage-taking by blocking Region |

(g) **Fundamental Misalignment Standard.** The ARB shall certify "Fundamental Misalignment" based on objective criteria. Certification is **automatic** if the State demonstrates any two of the following for two consecutive years:

(1) The State's primary economic trading partners are greater than sixty percent (60%) outside its current Region, as measured by interstate commerce data published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis; OR

(2) The State's labor market integration (cross-border commuting, migration) is greater than fifty percent (50%) with an adjacent Region, as measured by Census Bureau commuting data; OR

(3) The State's median voter policy preferences diverge from the Regional median by more than 1.5 standard deviations on three or more major policy domains, as measured by the biennial National Policy Preference Survey administered by the Federal Election Commission; OR

(4) The State shares a contiguous border with the destination Region and does not share a contiguous border with any other State in its current Region.

(h) **Waiting Period.** A State initiating Unilateral Departure shall complete a three (3) year waiting period during which:

(1) The State remains subject to all origin-Region obligations;

(2) The ARB shall verify continued Fundamental Misalignment at Year 2;

(3) The State may withdraw its transfer application at any time;

(4) Business investment decisions made during the waiting period shall not be subject to retroactive regulatory changes by either Region.

(i) **Policy Continuity Rule.** A transferring State shall remain subject to its former Region's regulatory and tax floors for a period of three (3) years following transfer, with floors declining by one-third (33%) annually toward the new Region's standards. During this period:

(1) Businesses may elect to be governed by either the origin Region's or destination Region's standards, provided they declare their election at the beginning of each fiscal year;

(2) This election does not affect individual rights protections, which remain subject to the higher floor;

(3) The destination Region may not impose requirements exceeding those of the origin Region during the transition period.

#### Anti-Region-Shopping Provisions

(j) **Anti-Arbitrage Certification.** No transfer shall be approved if the ARB determines, based on objective evidence, that arbitrage is the dominant purpose. Arbitrage shall be presumed if:

(1) The destination Region's effective corporate tax rate is more than five (5) percentage points lower than the origin Region's, AND the State cannot demonstrate Fundamental Misalignment under subsection (g); OR

(2) The destination Region's environmental compliance costs are more than thirty percent (30%) lower than the origin Region's, AND the State cannot demonstrate Fundamental Misalignment under subsection (g); OR

(3) The State government or its officials have publicly stated regulatory or tax avoidance as a primary motivation.

(k) **Burden of Proof.**

(1) Where the destination Region maintains lower floors in any domain enumerated in subsection (j), the transferring State bears the burden of demonstrating non-arbitrage purpose by a preponderance of evidence (not clear and convincing evidence).

(2) If the State establishes Fundamental Misalignment under subsection (g), the burden shifts to any objecting party to prove arbitrage as the dominant purpose by clear and convincing evidence.

(l) **Expedited ARB Review.** The ARB shall resolve transfer disputes within ninety (90) days of filing, not the general 180-day timeline. The ARB shall issue preliminary certification or denial within forty-five (45) days, with the remaining period for any appeals or supplemental submissions.

(m) **Regional Membership Permanence.** Once assigned, Regional membership is irrevocable until the next decennial review; selective coordination withdrawal does not exempt a State from Regional authority.

---

### Section 5. Inter-Regional Cooperation

(a) Two or more Regions may enter into agreements for cooperative action on any matter within their respective powers.

(b) Such agreements require no federal approval unless they:

- affect federal enumerated powers,
- create binding obligations on non-participating Regions,
- or conflict with federal law enacted pursuant to enumerated powers.

(c) Regions may establish joint institutions, shared programs, cooperative purchasing arrangements, and coordinated policy frameworks.

(d) Inter-Regional agreements shall specify:

- governance structure and decision-making procedures,
- cost-sharing and fiscal responsibilities,
- dispute resolution mechanisms,
- withdrawal procedures and transition provisions.

(e) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize Regions to jointly exercise powers reserved to the federal government or to create obligations binding on the United States.

---

### Section 6. Right of Transit and Non-Blockade

(a) No Region may deny, obstruct, or unreasonably condition access to transportation, energy, or communication infrastructure connecting other Regions. All Regions have rights of transit through other Regions on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.

(b) Infrastructure fees shall be non-discriminatory, cost-based, and transparent.

(c) This section does not require Regions to build new infrastructure, only to maintain reasonable access to existing infrastructure connecting other Regions.

#### Infrastructure Closure Review

(d) **Emergency Shutdown Expedited Review.** When any Region declares an emergency shutdown, initiates unscheduled maintenance, or imposes capacity restrictions on inter-Regional infrastructure:

(1) The declaration shall automatically trigger an expedited review by the Allocation Review Board within seventy-two hours;

(2) The declaring Region bears the burden of demonstrating genuine safety necessity by clear and convincing evidence;

(3) Failure to demonstrate necessity results in mandatory reopening within forty-eight hours.

(e) **Genuine Safety Necessity Standard.** To satisfy the "genuine safety necessity" requirement:

(1) The Region must identify a specific, documented hazard;

(2) The closure must be proportionate to the hazard (full closure only if partial measures insufficient);

(3) The estimated repair timeline must be technically justified;

(4) Economic impact on affected Regions must be considered as a factor, though not dispositive.

(f) **Prolonged Closure Presumption.** Any infrastructure closure or restriction exceeding seven days creates a rebuttable presumption of unreasonableness:

(1) The Region must file detailed justification with the ARB every seven days;

(2) Each seven-day extension requires renewed demonstration of necessity;

(3) Failure to file creates automatic referral for federal operational assumption.

(g) **Cumulative Obstruction Assessment.** The ARB shall assess patterns of infrastructure restriction:

(1) Three or more closures affecting the same corridor within twelve months triggers cumulative review;

(2) "Rolling maintenance" schedules that cumulatively exceed thirty days annually create presumption of strategic obstruction;

(3) Pattern finding shifts burden to Region for all future closures.

(h) **Alternative Route Requirements.** During any closure or restriction:

(1) The Region shall provide functional alternative routing at equivalent or lower cost;

(2) Increased costs for alternative routing borne by the closing Region;

(3) Failure to provide alternatives constitutes per se violation.

(i) **Processing Time Standards.** For infrastructure subject to inspection, certification, or processing requirements:

(1) Processing times shall not exceed national median for comparable facilities;

(2) Deviation exceeding fifty percent from median creates presumption of obstruction;

(3) ARB may mandate processing timeline improvements.

(j) **Rate Regulation for Constrained Corridors.** Rates for transit through partially closed or capacity-restricted infrastructure:

(1) Shall not exceed rates in effect prior to the restriction;

(2) No "scarcity premium" or "congestion pricing" permitted during capacity emergencies;

(3) Any rate increase during restriction period is void.

(k) **Cost-Based Rate Requirement.** Infrastructure user fees shall be based solely on:

(1) Documented maintenance and operational costs;

(2) Capital recovery for improvements directly benefiting users;

(3) Reasonable administrative overhead not exceeding fifteen percent of direct costs.

(l) **Rate Dispute Freeze.** When a fee is challenged:

(1) The pre-dispute rate remains in effect until ARB resolution;

(2) No retroactive collection permitted for disputed amounts;

(3) Resolution within sixty days required.

#### Remedies and Enforcement

(m) **Full Damages for Unreasonable Restrictions.** When the ARB finds an infrastructure restriction was not supported by genuine safety necessity:

(1) Affected Regions and private parties may recover full economic damages;

(2) Damages include direct losses, consequential damages, and litigation costs;

(3) No sovereign immunity defense available for infrastructure violations.

(n) **Treble Damages for Bad Faith.** When the ARB finds a restriction was imposed in bad faith--for purposes of economic coercion rather than safety:

(1) Treble damages are mandatory;

(2) Regional officials responsible for the decision are personally liable;

(3) Pattern bad faith triggers federal operational assumption.

(o) **Federal Operational Assumption.** When a Region refuses to comply with ARB order to reopen or de-restrict infrastructure:

(1) Federal agencies may assume operational control;

(2) Federal operation continues until the Region demonstrates compliance;

(3) Costs of federal operation are charged to the non-compliant Region.

(p) **Repeat Offender Designation.** Regions found to have engaged in unreasonable infrastructure conditioning three or more times within ten years:

(1) Lose unilateral authority over inter-Regional infrastructure;

(2) All future maintenance, closures, and rate changes require ARB pre-approval;

(3) Designation continues for ten years or until the Region demonstrates reformed practices.

#### National Infrastructure Transparency System

(q) **National Infrastructure Transparency System Established.** The Department of Transportation, in coordination with the Department of Energy, the Independent Fiscal Council, and the Allocation Review Board, shall maintain a publicly accessible National Infrastructure Transparency System (NITS) containing:

(1) Real-time operational status of all inter-Regional transit corridors, energy transmission lines, and pipeline infrastructure;

(2) All emergency declarations, maintenance schedules, and capacity restrictions affecting inter-Regional infrastructure;

(3) Complete technical justifications for any closure, restriction, or capacity reduction;

(4) Historical data on infrastructure availability, maintenance frequency, and processing times by corridor and Region;

(5) All inter-Regional transit fee schedules with cost justification summaries;

(6) Fee challenge status, pending disputes, and resolution outcomes.

(r) **Mandatory Real-Time Disclosure.** When a Region declares an emergency shutdown, initiates maintenance, imposes capacity restrictions, or changes fee schedules:

(1) The Region shall upload complete technical or cost justification to NITS within four hours for emergencies, thirty days for fee changes;

(2) Justification must include specific hazard identification, engineering assessments, estimated duration, or audited cost documentation;

(3) Supporting data (inspection reports, sensor readings, engineering analyses, financial records) must be made publicly available;

(4) Updates shall be filed every twenty-four hours during ongoing closures.

(s) **No Classified Infrastructure Justifications.** Regions may not invoke national security, proprietary information, or any confidentiality doctrine to withhold infrastructure closure or fee justifications:

(1) All safety, maintenance, and cost justifications are inherently public information;

(2) If a closure involves genuinely classified federal security matters, only the federal government (not the Region) may invoke classification, and must assume operational responsibility for the closure;

(3) Regional invocation of "classified" or "proprietary" justification creates irrebuttable presumption of bad faith and triggers immediate federal review.

(t) **Public Accountability Metrics.** NITS shall publish monthly:

(1) "Infrastructure Reliability Scores" for each Region based on closure frequency, duration, and justification adequacy;

(2) "Fee Reasonableness Scores" for each Region comparing fees to cost-plus standards;

(3) Comparison of stated maintenance needs to industry benchmarks;

(4) Economic impact estimates of closures and fees on affected Regions;

(5) Identification of patterns suggesting strategic rather than safety-motivated closures;

(6) Historical fee trends and comparisons across Regions.

(u) **Cost-Plus Fee Ceiling.** Inter-Regional transit fees shall not exceed one hundred ten percent of documented costs:

(1) "Documented costs" means actual operating costs plus capital recovery plus reasonable administrative overhead;

(2) The IFC shall establish uniform accounting standards for cost calculation;

(3) Costs shall be audited annually and published in NITS.

(v) **Aggregate Fee Limitation.** The aggregate of all fees, charges, and assessments imposed on inter-Regional transit shall not exceed the one hundred ten percent cost-plus ceiling:

(1) Regions may not circumvent the ceiling through multiple fee categories;

(2) "Environmental," "climate adaptation," "safety," and "modernization" charges count toward the aggregate;

(3) The IFC shall monitor for fee multiplication strategies.

(w) **Summary Suspension Authority.** The ARB may summarily suspend fee collection when:

(1) Prima facie evidence suggests the fee exceeds the one hundred ten percent ceiling;

(2) Suspension remains in effect pending full review;

(3) The charging Region bears the burden of proving cost compliance;

(4) Failure to provide audited cost documentation creates rebuttable presumption of violation;

(5) The ARB may access Regional financial records for verification.

#### Anti-Retaliation

(x) **Non-Retaliation.** Regions may not:

(1) Increase fees in response to fee challenges by specific users;

(2) Impose selective enforcement of ancillary requirements against challengers;

(3) Delay processing of challengers' transit relative to non-challengers;

(4) Impose new requirements targeting entities that filed ARB complaints.

(y) **Challenger Protection.** Entities filing infrastructure or fee challenges:

(1) Shall have access to expedited ARB review;

(2) May recover attorney fees and costs if challenge is successful;

(3) Are protected from any adverse action by the challenged Region.

(z) **Whistleblower Provisions.** Regional employees who report infrastructure abuse:

(1) Are protected from termination, demotion, or adverse action;

(2) May file directly with ARB under seal;

(3) May receive a portion of any damages recovered.

(aa) Implementation procedures are established by statute.

### Section 7. Water Rights and Shared Waterways

(a) Interstate rivers, lakes, aquifers, and watersheds that cross or border Regional boundaries are shared resources. Water allocation among Regions shall be governed by principles of equitable apportionment.

(b) No Region may unilaterally divert, dam, or appropriate water in a manner that substantially diminishes the quantity or quality of water available to other Regions, or discharge pollutants that render water unusable by other Regions.

(c) Existing interstate water compacts shall remain in force unless superseded by Regional agreement or federal law.

(d) Nothing in this section shall diminish treaty obligations to Tribal Nations regarding water rights or authorize taking of water rights without just compensation.

(e) **Water Resources Coordination Board.** There is hereby established a Water Resources Coordination Board consisting of:

- one representative appointed by each Region,
- one representative of the Environmental Protection Agency,
- one representative of the Army Corps of Engineers,
- two representatives of Tribal Nations with water rights in affected watersheds (selected by a council of affected Tribes).

The Board shall coordinate water allocation, establish monitoring standards, and facilitate dispute resolution through mediation before adjudication.

(f) **National Water Court.** There is hereby established a National Water Court with exclusive original jurisdiction over interstate water disputes. The Court shall consist of five judges appointed by the President with Senate confirmation for twelve-year non-renewable terms, drawn from persons with expertise in water law, hydrology, or environmental science. At least two judges shall have experience representing Western states with prior appropriation systems, and at least two shall have experience representing Eastern states with riparian rights systems. The Court's decisions may be appealed to the Supreme Court on questions of constitutional interpretation.

(g) Implementation procedures are established by statute.

---

### Section 8. Freedom of Movement

(a) All citizens of the United States shall have the right to:

- travel freely between and within Regions,
- establish residence in any Region,
- seek employment in any Region,
- access public services on equal terms with residents after establishing residence.

(b) No Region may:

- impose border controls, checkpoints, or travel documentation requirements for movement between Regions,
- require waiting periods exceeding ninety days for access to public services for new residents (excluding residency requirements for voting, which shall not exceed thirty days),
- discriminate in employment, housing, or public accommodations based on Region of origin,
- condition professional licensure or credentialing on Region of prior residence.

(c) Durational residency requirements are permissible only for:

- voting registration (not exceeding thirty days),
- in-state tuition eligibility at public institutions (not exceeding twelve months),
- candidacy for elected office (as established by statute, not exceeding the term length of the office sought).

(d) This section shall not be construed to:

- require Regions to subsidize relocation,
- prevent reasonable transition periods for benefit eligibility where portability is ensured,
- override legitimate public health quarantine measures during declared emergencies.

(e) A person whose freedom of movement has been impaired may seek injunctive relief in any Regional court, with expedited review (seven days).

---

### Section 9. Mutual Recognition

(a) Full Faith and Credit. Each jurisdiction shall give full faith and credit to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other jurisdiction.

(b) Legal Status Recognition. Marriages, divorces, adoptions, name changes, powers of attorney, corporate registrations, and property titles established under any jurisdiction's law shall be recognized in all other jurisdictions.

(c) Professional Credentials. Professional licenses shall be recognized for practice in all jurisdictions, subject only to registration, reasonable fees, and verification of good standing. Supplementary requirements may be imposed only where the receiving jurisdiction's standards demonstrably exceed those of the issuing jurisdiction.

(d) Academic Credentials. Educational degrees from accredited institutions shall be recognized throughout the United States.

(e) No jurisdiction may refuse recognition based on religious or moral objection, political disagreement, economic protectionism, or retaliation.

(f) Implementation procedures are established by statute.

#### Rebuttable Presumption of Competency

(g) **Presumption of Competency.** A credential validly issued by any Region creates a rebuttable presumption of competency to practice in all Regions:

(1) The receiving Region bears the burden of demonstrating that supplementary requirements are necessary;

(2) The standard for supplementary requirements is "Essential for Public Safety" (not merely "demonstrably exceed");

(3) Convenience, preference, or economic protection do not constitute public safety necessity.

(h) **Essential for Public Safety Standard.** A supplementary requirement is "Essential for Public Safety" only if:

(1) It addresses a specific, documented risk to public health, safety, or welfare;

(2) The risk is unique to the receiving Region and not adequately addressed by the issuing Region's standards;

(3) The requirement is narrowly tailored to address only that specific risk;

(4) Less restrictive alternatives are inadequate.

(i) **Prohibited Justifications.** The following do not constitute public safety necessity:

(1) General assertions that Regional standards are "higher" or "more rigorous";

(2) Economic impact on existing Regional practitioners;

(3) Differences in educational institution accreditation;

(4) Requirements for Region-specific knowledge not directly related to professional competency.

#### ARB Pre-Approval for Supplementary Requirements

(j) **ARB Certification Required.** Before imposing any supplementary credential requirement on out-of-Region professionals, a Region must:

(1) Submit the proposed requirement to the Allocation Review Board;

(2) Demonstrate that the requirement meets the "Essential for Public Safety" standard;

(3) Receive ARB certification within ninety (90) days.

(k) **Automatic Recognition.** If the ARB fails to rule within ninety (90) days:

(1) The supplementary requirement is deemed not certified;

(2) The out-of-Region credential must be recognized without supplement;

(3) The Region may resubmit with additional justification.

(l) **Grandfathering.** Supplementary requirements in effect at ratification:

(1) Remain valid for two (2) years;

(2) Must be submitted for ARB certification within one (1) year;

(3) Uncertified requirements become void after the two-year transition period.

#### Anti-Protectionism Provisions

(m) **Facially Neutral Discrimination.** A credential requirement that is facially neutral but has disparate impact on out-of-Region professionals:

(1) Is subject to strict scrutiny;

(2) Must be justified by compelling public safety interest;

(3) Creates rebuttable presumption of protectionist intent if adopted within twenty-four (24) months of significant credential migration.

(n) **Prohibited Practices.** Regions may not:

(1) Require continuing education obtainable only within the Region;

(2) Impose "cultural competency" or "regional knowledge" requirements beyond those directly necessary for professional practice;

(3) Condition reciprocity on political, economic, or policy concessions;

(4) Revoke reciprocity for reasons unrelated to credential standards.

(o) **Expedited Judicial Review.** Professionals denied credential recognition may:

(1) Appeal directly to the National Constitutional Court;

(2) Receive expedited ruling within sixty (60) days;

(3) Practice under provisional recognition pending appeal if they demonstrate valid out-of-Region credential.

---

### Section 10. Data Sovereignty and Critical Governance Data

#### Critical Governance Data Classification

(a) **Critical Governance Data Defined.** The following categories constitute "Critical Governance Data" subject to this section:

(1) **Electoral Data:** Voter registration, election results, redistricting data, campaign finance records;

(2) **Fiscal Data:** Tax assessments, collections, expenditures, and audit records at all levels;

(3) **Infrastructure Data:** Energy grid telemetry, water system monitoring, transportation network status, communications infrastructure;

(4) **Identity Data:** Citizenship records, vital statistics (birth, death, marriage), professional licensing;

(5) **Public Safety Data:** Law enforcement records, emergency response data, public health surveillance.

(b) **Shared Constitutional Utility.** Critical Governance Data is hereby declared a "Shared Constitutional Utility":

(1) No single level of government has exclusive ownership;

(2) All levels with constitutional functions requiring the data have access rights;

(3) The physical location of servers or infrastructure does not determine ownership or control.

(c) **Interoperability Mandate.** All Critical Governance Data systems shall:

(1) Use standardized formats enabling cross-level access;

(2) Maintain real-time or near-real-time synchronization where technically feasible;

(3) Provide API access to authorized government entities at all levels.

(d) **IFC Data Standards Authority.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall establish and maintain:

(1) Technical standards for Critical Governance Data interoperability;

(2) Security protocols for data access and transmission;

(3) Audit procedures for data integrity verification.

#### Prohibition on Digital Blockade

(e) **Prohibition on Data Denial.** No Federal, Regional, or State government may:

(1) Deny, restrict, or condition another level's access to Critical Governance Data necessary for that level's constitutional functions;

(2) Encrypt, silo, or technically obstruct access to shared data systems;

(3) Require approval, licensing, or payment for access to data necessary for constitutional functions;

(4) Provide data in formats designed to impede practical use.

(f) **Constitutional Function Nexus.** Access rights attach when:

(1) The requesting level has an enumerated constitutional power;

(2) Exercise of that power requires the specific data requested;

(3) The nexus between data and function is not pretextual.

(g) **Presumption of Access.** Requests for Critical Governance Data:

(1) Are presumptively valid when made by an authorized government entity;

(2) Must be fulfilled within seventy-two hours absent legitimate technical constraints;

(3) May be denied only upon specific, written justification subject to ARB review.

(h) **Technical Obstruction as Violation.** Providing data in deliberately unusable formats, imposing unreasonable technical requirements, or maintaining "legacy systems" that prevent interoperability without documented modernization plans:

(1) Constitutes constructive denial;

(2) Is subject to the same penalties as outright refusal;

(3) Creates rebuttable presumption of bad faith if the obstructing level has opposed the requesting level's exercise of constitutional authority.

#### Data Integrity and Reconciliation

(i) **Single Source of Truth.** For each category of Critical Governance Data, the IFC shall designate:

(1) A "Primary Custodian" responsible for maintaining the authoritative record;

(2) Reconciliation procedures when multiple sources conflict;

(3) Appeals process for disputed data.

(j) **Primary Custodian Assignment.**

(1) **Electoral Data:** State governments, subject to Federal and Regional audit rights;

(2) **Citizenship/Identity Data:** Federal government;

(3) **Infrastructure Data:** Level operating the infrastructure, subject to oversight access by regulators;

(4) **Tax Data:** Collecting level, with mandatory sharing to other levels with tax authority over same base.

(k) **Mandatory Reconciliation.** When data from different levels conflicts:

(1) The levels shall conduct reconciliation within thirty days;

(2) If reconciliation fails, the IFC shall determine the authoritative record;

(3) Levels refusing to participate in reconciliation forfeit their position in any dispute.

(l) **Audit Rights.** Any level of government may:

(1) Audit Critical Governance Data maintained by another level for accuracy;

(2) Request independent verification by the IFC;

(3) Publish audit findings (excluding personally identifiable information).

#### Privacy and Security Protections

(m) **Privacy Preservation.** Data access under this section:

(1) Is limited to data necessary for constitutional functions;

(2) Does not authorize disclosure to private parties without independent legal authority;

(3) Requires compliance with applicable privacy laws and the National Rights Floor;

(4) Prohibits use of accessed data for purposes beyond the stated constitutional function.

(n) **Security Requirements.** All Critical Governance Data systems shall:

(1) Meet cybersecurity standards established by the IFC in consultation with federal cybersecurity agencies;

(2) Maintain access logs subject to audit;

(3) Implement role-based access controls limiting data exposure to authorized personnel.

(o) **Breach Notification.** Any breach of Critical Governance Data:

(1) Must be reported to all affected levels within twenty-four hours;

(2) Must be reported to the public within seventy-two hours;

(3) Triggers mandatory security review by the IFC.

(p) **No Privacy Shield for Obstruction.** Privacy concerns may not be invoked to:

(1) Deny government-to-government data sharing for constitutional functions;

(2) Justify encryption or access controls that exclude other government levels;

(3) The privacy of individuals is protected by limiting downstream use, not by blocking intergovernmental access.

#### Enforcement and Remedies

(q) **Digital Blockade as Constitutional Violation.** Denial of Critical Governance Data access:

(1) Constitutes a violation of this Constitution equivalent to physical obstruction of federal officers;

(2) May be enjoined by the National Constitutional Court;

(3) Officials responsible for denial are personally liable and may be removed from office.

(r) **Emergency Access Orders.** If a level claims urgent need for data access:

(1) The ARB may issue an Emergency Access Order within twenty-four hours;

(2) The order requires immediate compliance pending full adjudication;

(3) Failure to comply with an Emergency Access Order constitutes contempt.

(s) **Federal Data Backup Authority.** If a State or Region persistently denies data access:

(1) The Federal government may establish parallel data collection systems;

(2) The obstructing level bears the cost of duplicate systems;

(3) Federal data becomes authoritative for federal functions regardless of State/Regional objection.

(t) **Integration with Infrastructure Protections.** Data and telemetry shall be treated as "transit-protected assets" under Section 6:

(1) Digital blockade is subject to the same review and penalties as physical infrastructure obstruction;

(2) The National Infrastructure Transparency System shall include data system availability;

(3) "Data Reliability Scores" shall be published alongside infrastructure reliability scores.

(u) **Specialized Data Access Provisions.** Nothing in this section limits:

(1) Federal Data Supremacy for rights enforcement under Article II, Section 1;

(2) Forensic audit authority under Article X, Section 3;

(3) Algorithmic transparency requirements established by statute pursuant to this section;

(4) Transition data requirements under the Transition Framework.

(v) **Hierarchy of Access.** When specialized provisions conflict with general provisions:

(1) Rights enforcement access takes precedence for individual rights data;

(2) Forensic audit authority takes precedence for fiscal data;

(3) General provisions of this section apply as default for all other data categories.

(w) **Privacy Reconciliation.** The privacy protections of subsection (m) are reconciled with specialized access as follows:

(1) Minimization requirements of subsection (m) apply to all specialized access;

(2) Use restrictions of subsection (m)(4) apply regardless of access authority;

(3) Specialized provisions may expand access scope but not diminish privacy safeguards.

(x) **Federal Data Coordination Agency.** There is hereby established a Federal Data Coordination Agency with the following responsibilities:

(1) **Technical Standards Development.** The Agency shall develop and maintain binding technical standards for Critical Governance Data interoperability, including:

- (i) data format specifications and schema requirements;
- (ii) API protocols and authentication standards;
- (iii) encryption and security requirements;
- (iv) synchronization frequency and latency requirements by data category.

(2) **Legacy System Transition.** The Agency shall:

- (i) inventory all existing government data systems within two years of ratification;
- (ii) establish a ten-year transition timeline for legacy system compliance;
- (iii) provide technical assistance and funding to jurisdictions for system modernization;
- (iv) grant compliance extensions for demonstrated hardship, not to exceed five additional years.

(3) **Security Coordination.** The Agency shall maintain a unified security operations center for Critical Governance Data that:

- (i) monitors for unauthorized access attempts across all jurisdictions;
- (ii) coordinates incident response for data breaches affecting multiple jurisdictions;
- (iii) conducts annual security audits of all connected systems;
- (iv) maintains backup and disaster recovery capabilities for Critical Governance Data.

(4) **Composition.** The Agency shall be governed by a board consisting of:

- (i) one representative appointed by each Regional Governor;
- (ii) two representatives appointed by the President;
- (iii) one representative appointed by the Chief Justice;

- modified by agreement of all participating jurisdictions,
- or reorganized pursuant to Regional law for agencies operating wholly within one Region.

(f) Compact Review. Within five years of ratification, the Allocation Review Board shall review all existing interstate compacts and issue guidance on their status under this Constitution. This review is advisory; compacts remain in force pending legislative action.

### Section 5. Regional Exclusive Domains

(a) **Enumeration.** Regional Exclusive Domains are those areas where Regions have primary authority subject only to Federal Floors and Frameworks.

(b) **ARB Certification.** The Allocation Review Board shall certify whether legislation impacts Regional Exclusive Domains.

(c) **Supermajority Requirement.** Any bill establishing a "National Floor" or "National Framework" that the ARB has certified as impacting a Regional Exclusive Domain requires three-fifths (60%) majority of the House of Representatives for passage. This requirement may not be waived, suspended, or circumvented by House rules, and applies regardless of procedural posture (including conference reports, amendments, and reconciliation).

(d) **Pre-Legislative Domain Certification.**

(1) Before any bill establishing a National Floor or National Framework may be introduced in the House of Representatives, the bill's sponsor shall submit the proposed legislation to the Allocation Review Board for Domain Certification.

(2) Within thirty days of submission, the Board shall certify whether the proposed legislation impacts a Regional Exclusive Domain under this section.

(3) If the Board certifies that the legislation impacts a Regional Exclusive Domain:

- (i) the bill shall be subject to the supermajority requirement of subsection (c);
- (ii) this certification shall be noted in the bill's official text and cannot be removed by amendment; and
- (iii) any attempt to pass the bill by simple majority shall be void.

(4) If the Board certifies that the legislation does not impact a Regional Exclusive Domain, the bill may proceed under normal House procedures.

(5) The Board's Domain Certification is subject to judicial review only for abuse of discretion or clear legal error. Courts shall give substantial deference to the Board's determination of domain boundaries.

(6) Congress may not:

- (i) define its own jurisdiction over Regional Exclusive Domains;
- (ii) amend the definition of Regional Exclusive Domain except by constitutional amendment; or
- (iii) circumvent Domain Certification through creative bill drafting, omnibus legislation, or procedural manipulation.

(7) If the Board fails to issue certification within thirty days, the bill shall be presumptively certified as NOT impacting a Regional Exclusive Domain, and the bill may proceed under normal House procedures. This default prevents certification delay from being used to obstruct legislation.

#### Anti-Bottleneck Provisions

(8) **Expedited Certification Track.** The Board shall establish an expedited certification track for:

- (i) bills addressing declared emergencies;
- (ii) bills with bipartisan House sponsorship exceeding sixty percent;
- (iii) bills that are substantially similar to previously certified legislation.
Expedited certifications shall be completed within ten days.

(9) **Staffing and Capacity Requirements.** The Board shall maintain sufficient staff to process certification requests without backlog:

- (i) If average certification time exceeds twenty days for three consecutive months, the Board shall hire additional staff within sixty days;
- (ii) Certification staff funding is mandatory spending, not subject to annual appropriation;
- (iii) The Board shall publish monthly certification statistics including filing volume, average processing time, and pending requests.

(10) **Backlog Remediation.** If pending certification requests exceed fifty at any time:

- (i) The Board shall implement emergency processing procedures;
- (ii) New requests shall be processed in order of filing date;
- (iii) Requests pending more than twenty days shall be automatically approved for normal House procedures unless the Board affirmatively certifies Regional Exclusive Domain impact within five additional days.

(11) **Anti-Strategic-Delay.** No party may file certification requests for the purpose of creating backlog or delaying unrelated legislation:

- (i) Frivolous or duplicative requests may be summarily dismissed;
- (ii) A pattern of filing requests subsequently withdrawn may result in filing restrictions;
- (iii) The Board may consolidate substantially similar requests.

(12) **Congressional Bypass for Obstruction.** If the Board fails to process certifications due to quorum failure, member vacancies, or other institutional dysfunction for more than sixty consecutive days:

- (i) The House may proceed with legislation without certification by a three-fifths vote;
- (ii) Such legislation shall be subject to expedited judicial review within ninety days of enactment;
- (iii) This bypass may not be used if the Board is functioning normally but simply has a backlog.

---

### Section 6. Regional Equivalence Exemptions

(a) **Equivalence Petition.** A Region may petition the Allocation Review Board for an "Equivalence Exemption" from a specific National Floor. The Board shall grant the exemption if the Region demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence, that its alternative policy achieves the same or superior outcome as intended by the National Floor while better suiting regional economic, geographic, or demographic conditions.

(b) **Outcome Metrics.** For each National Floor, Congress shall specify measurable outcome metrics by which equivalence may be assessed. If Congress fails to specify metrics, the Allocation Review Board shall determine appropriate metrics based on the stated legislative purpose.

(c) **Provisional Compliance.** Pending Allocation Review Board determination on an Equivalence Petition:

(1) The Region may implement its alternative policy on a provisional basis;

(2) The Region shall demonstrate a good-faith compliance mechanism, which may include:

- (i) posting a compliance bond in an amount determined by the Board,
- (ii) establishing an escrow fund for potential remediation costs,
- (iii) implementing enhanced monitoring and reporting, or
- (iv) other assurance mechanisms the Board deems adequate;

(3) Provisional implementation shall not constitute a violation of the National Floor during the pendency of the petition;

(4) If the petition is denied, the Region shall have one hundred eighty days to achieve full compliance with the National Floor.

No federal law shall be interpreted to prohibit a Region or State from exceeding such protections unless explicitly stated.

---

### Section 2. Subsidiarity with Enforcement

Authority resides at the lowest level capable of exercising it effectively, subject to judicial enforcement of constitutional boundaries.

---

### Section 3. Hierarchy of Law

(a) This Constitution is the supreme law of the United States.

(b) Within their respective spheres:

- Federal law enacted pursuant to enumerated federal powers is supreme over conflicting Regional, State, or local law.
- Regional law enacted pursuant to enumerated Regional powers is supreme over conflicting State or local law within the Region.
- State law is supreme over conflicting local law within the State.

(c) State Constitutions.

(1) State constitutions may not conflict with this Constitution or with the Regional constitution of the Region in which the State is located.

(2) State constitutions may establish protections exceeding those in the Regional or federal constitutions (floors, not ceilings).

(3) In case of conflict between a State constitution and a Regional constitution:

- the Regional constitution prevails on matters within enumerated Regional powers,
- the State constitution prevails on matters within reserved State powers,
- disputes shall be resolved by the Allocation Review Board, with appeal to the Supreme Court.

(d) Local Charters. Local government charters and ordinances are subordinate to State law and may not conflict with State, Regional, or federal law.

(e) Pre-Ratification State Law. State law in effect at ratification continues in force unless:

- inconsistent with this Constitution,
- superseded by Regional law on matters transferred to Regional authority,
- or repealed by the State.

---

## ARTICLE IV - THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH

### Section 1. Congress

Congress shall remain bicameral, consisting of a House of Representatives and a Senate.

---

### Section 2. The House of Representatives

The House shall be elected by the People according to population and shall initiate national legislation within enumerated federal powers.

---

### Section 3. The Senate

(a) The Senate shall represent the Regions equally.

(b) Each Region shall be represented by three Senators, elected at-large within the Region by ranked-choice voting for staggered six-year terms.

(c) The total membership of the Senate shall be three times the number of Regions, plus any at-large members serving under subsection (d).

(d) Each Region shall select Senators according to Regional law, provided such law provides for direct popular election.

(e) **Transitional Exception.** Senators representing the District of Columbia and United States territories prior to Regional assignment serve as at-large members with full voting rights pursuant to Article XX, Sections 1(b) and 2(b). Upon Regional assignment, such Senators join the assigned Region's delegation.

---

### Section 4. Senate Powers

The Senate's powers are limited to:

- ratification of treaties,
- confirmation of judicial and constitutional officers,
- participation in constitutional amendments,
- adjudication of intergovernmental disputes.

The Senate shall not function as a routine legislative veto.

**Adjudication Procedures.** When adjudicating intergovernmental disputes:

- (a) The Senate shall establish standing rules for dispute adjudication, including discovery procedures, hearing requirements, and decision standards.
- (b) Disputes must be resolved within 180 days of filing unless all parties consent to extension.
- (c) Senate adjudication is limited to disputes between Regions, or between Regions and the federal government, regarding interpretation of this Constitution or federal law.
- (d) The Senate may not adjudicate disputes involving individual rights (which belong to the courts) or disputes already pending in the Allocation Review Board or federal courts.
- (e) Senate adjudication decisions may be appealed to the Supreme Court on questions of constitutional interpretation within 60 days.

**Conflict of Interest Provisions.** To ensure impartial adjudication:

- (f) **Mandatory Recusal.** Senators from any Region that is a party to a dispute shall be recused from voting on the adjudication. If both parties are Regions, Senators from both Regions are recused.
- (g) **Quorum with Recusals.** When Senators are recused under subsection (f):
    - (1) The quorum for adjudication shall be a majority of non-recused Senators;
    - (2) Decisions require a majority of non-recused Senators voting;
    - (3) If recusals reduce participating Senators below eight, the dispute shall be transferred to the Supreme Court for original jurisdiction.
- (h) **Anti-Bloc Voting Safeguards.**
    - (1) No adjudication may proceed if Senators from three or fewer Regions would constitute a majority of voting Senators;
    - (2) If a pattern emerges where the same Regional coalition decides three consecutive disputes against the same Region or group of Regions, any affected Region may demand transfer to the Supreme Court;
    - (3) The Chief Justice shall review Senate adjudication patterns annually and may certify "systematic regional bias" if statistical analysis demonstrates non-random voting patterns correlated with Regional identity rather than legal merit. Such certification triggers automatic Supreme Court review of pending and future disputes for two years.
- (i) **Independent Adjudication Panel Option.** For disputes involving allegations of Regional discrimination or systematic bias:
    - (1) Any party may request adjudication by an Independent Panel instead of the full Senate;
    - (2) The Panel shall consist of the Chief Justice (presiding), two retired federal appellate judges selected by lot, and two Senators selected by lot from non-party Regions;
    - (3) Panel decisions have the same force as Senate adjudication and are appealable under the same terms.

---

### Section 4-A. Senate Concurrence for Constitutional Safeguards (Proposed)

> **Note:** This section is a proposed optional enhancement.

Senate concurrence by majority vote may be required for legislation affecting constitutional safeguards, including emergency powers, domestic armed force deployment, election administration, judicial structure, de-escalation procedures, and allocation of powers.

If adopted, this section would create targeted Senate involvement in safeguard legislation while preserving House majority rule for ordinary policy.

### Section 5. Federal Lawmaking

(a) Bills within enumerated federal powers may be introduced in the House of Representatives.

(b) Upon passage by the House, bills shall be presented to the President for signature.

(c) The President may sign or veto the bill. A presidential veto may be overridden by a two-thirds vote of the House of Representatives.

(d) The Senate shall not have veto power over ordinary legislation. Senate concurrence is required only for matters specified in Section 4.

(e) Senate Review of Interregional Coordination Matters. For bills affecting interregional coordination (shared natural resources, equalization formulas, Regional mandates, boundary procedures), the Senate may delay presentation to the President to propose amendments, but cannot permanently block legislation.

- (1) The Senate must complete review within 60 days of receiving a bill from the House. If no action is taken within 60 days, the bill shall be automatically presented to the President.
- (2) If the Senate proposes amendments, the House may accept, reject, or modify them within 30 days. The House's final action is conclusive.
- (3) The Senate may invoke review by majority vote within 10 days of House passage. Failure to invoke review waives the delay authority.
- (4) During Senate review, the bill's sponsors in the House may request expedited review (30 days) upon showing urgent circumstances.

(f) The categories triggering Senate review may not be expanded except by constitutional amendment.

(g) Implementation procedures are established by statute.

## ARTICLE V - THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH

### Section 1. The Presidency

The President remains the Chief Executive and Commander-in-Chief of the Federal Armed Forces.

---

### Section 2. Scope of Executive Authority

The President shall:

- execute federal law,
- conduct foreign affairs,
- enforce constitutional floors.

The President shall not exercise general domestic governance over Regional or State domains.

---

## ARTICLE X - FISCAL ARCHITECTURE

### Section 1. Independent Taxing Authority

Each level of government--federal, Regional, State, local--shall possess independent taxing authority sufficient to fulfill its enumerated responsibilities.

#### Regional Revenue Protection

(a) **Prohibition on Targeted Fiscal Nullification.** No State shall enact any law, credit, rebate, deduction, or exemption that:

(1) Specifically targets, offsets, or neutralizes Regional tax liabilities;

(2) Provides tax benefits conditioned on payment of Regional taxes;

(3) Creates priority schemes that systematically subordinate Regional tax collection to State collection;

(4) Offers location-based incentives designed to erode the Regional tax base within the State.

(b) **Rebuttable Presumption.** A State tax provision shall be presumed to violate subsection (a) if:

(1) It was enacted within twenty-four (24) months of a Regional tax increase or new Regional tax;

(2) Its fiscal impact falls disproportionately (greater than 75%) on Regional revenue rather than Federal or general State revenue;

(3) Legislative history or public statements by sponsors reference Regional tax policy.

(c) **Permitted State Tax Policy.** Nothing in this section shall prevent States from:

(1) Establishing general tax credits, deductions, or exemptions that apply regardless of Regional tax status;

(2) Setting State tax rates at any level, including zero;

(3) Competing for business through general economic development incentives not targeted at Regional tax avoidance.

#### Regional Tax Collection Priority

(d) **Concurrent Collection Authority.** Regions shall have independent authority to:

(1) Assess and collect Regional taxes directly from taxpayers without State intermediation;

(2) Establish Regional tax administration agencies with full enforcement powers;

(3) File liens, levy assets, and pursue collection remedies independently of State tax authorities.

(e) **Lien Parity.** Regional tax liens shall have equal priority with State tax liens:

(1) When Regional and State liens attach to the same property on the same date, they share pro rata;

(2) When liens attach on different dates, priority follows standard first-in-time rules regardless of governmental level;

(3) No State may establish categorical priority for State liens over Regional liens.

(f) **Anti-Subordination Clause.** No State bankruptcy, receivership, or fiscal emergency proceeding may subordinate Regional tax claims to State claims or general creditors.

---

### Section 2. No Unfunded Mandates

Mandates imposed on subordinate governments without adequate funding are unenforceable.

---

### Section 3. Equalization

Automatic, formula-based equalization transfers shall ensure baseline governing capacity across Regions.

#### National Benefits Spine Fiscal Alignment

(a) **Co-Payment Requirement.** For any program funded through the National Benefits Spine, the administering Region shall contribute a co-payment from Regional own-source revenue according to the following schedule:

(1) Regions with fiscal capacity above 110% of national median: 20% co-payment;

(2) Regions with fiscal capacity between 90-110% of national median: 15% co-payment;

(3) Regions with fiscal capacity below 90% of national median: 10% co-payment;

(4) Small Regions receiving equalization transfers under Section 3-A: 5% co-payment (minimum).

(b) **Effect on Incentives.** The co-payment requirement ensures that Regional governments bear marginal fiscal consequences for program expansion decisions, aligning authority over administration with responsibility for costs.

#### Efficiency-Indexed Federal Contributions

(c) **Outcome-Based Funding.** The federal government shall provide National Benefits Spine funding sufficient to achieve specified outcome floors at the National Median cost-per-outcome, adjusted for Regional Purchasing Power Parity.

(d) **Purchasing Power Parity Adjustment.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall annually calculate a Regional Cost Index reflecting differences in labor costs, real estate costs, and input prices across Regions. All efficiency comparisons shall use PPP-adjusted figures.

(e) **Funding Adjustment Based on Efficiency.**

(1) **Efficient Regions:** If a Region achieves outcome floors at below-median PPP-adjusted cost, the Region retains 50% of the savings as unrestricted Regional revenue;

(2) **Inefficient Regions:** If a Region exceeds median PPP-adjusted cost while achieving outcome floors, federal funding covers only the median cost; the Region must fund the excess from own-source revenue;

(3) **Underperforming Regions:** If a Region fails to achieve outcome floors regardless of spending, the Region enters Performance Improvement Status.

#### Subsidy-Neutrality Adjustment

(f) **Subsidy-Neutrality Adjustment.** Equalization formulas shall account for Regional tax expenditures:

(1) "Tax expenditures" include tax credits, exemptions, abatements, and other preferential treatments that reduce tax liability for specific industries or firms;

(2) Tax expenditures exceeding two percent (2%) of Regional GDP shall be added back to calculated tax capacity for equalization purposes;

(3) This adjustment treats the Region as if it had collected the forgone revenue.

(g) **Tax Expenditure Reporting.** Each Region shall report annually:

(1) All tax expenditures by category and amount;

(2) The industries or firms benefiting from each expenditure;

(3) The stated policy rationale for each expenditure.

(h) **IFC Verification.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall:

(1) Verify Regional tax expenditure reports;

(2) Apply the subsidy-neutrality adjustment to equalization calculations;

(3) Publish comparative tax expenditure analyses across Regions.

#### Predatory Subsidy Prohibition

(i) **Predatory Subsidy Prohibition.** Regions may not offer subsidies:

(1) Explicitly conditioned on relocation from another Region;

(2) Available only to firms relocating from specific other Regions;

(3) Structured to match or exceed subsidies offered by other Regions in bidding wars.

(j) **Relocation Subsidy Definition.** A subsidy is "conditioned on relocation" if:

(1) The subsidy agreement references the firm's current location;

(2) The subsidy is available only to firms not currently operating in the Region;

(3) The subsidy amount varies based on the firm's origin Region.

(k) **Total Subsidy Ceiling.** Regional tax expenditures and direct subsidies combined:

(1) May not exceed five percent (5%) of Regional GDP in any fiscal year;

(2) May not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of Regional tax revenue;

(3) The lower of the two limits applies.

---

### Section 3-A. Small Region Support

(a) Equalization transfers under Section 3 shall include a minimum floor for each Region, regardless of formula calculations, sufficient to fund:

- basic Regional administrative functions,
- Regional court operations,
- Regional Guard minimum readiness requirements,
- participation in inter-Regional coordination bodies.

(b) This floor shall be established by statute and may not be reduced below the level necessary to maintain functioning Regional governance.

(c) Small Regions may pool resources through inter-Regional agreements for:

- specialized court functions,
- technical expertise,
- infrastructure management,
- higher education coordination.

(d) Pooling agreements under this section require no federal approval and do not constitute merger.

(e) **Federal Institutional Capacity Support.** For any Region with population below two percent of the total population of the United States:

- (1) The federal government shall provide supplemental funding for Regional court operations, including judicial salaries, court facilities, and administrative staff, sufficient to ensure access to justice equivalent to that available in larger Regions;
- (2) The federal government shall provide technical assistance and shared personnel for specialized regulatory functions that require expertise not economically sustainable at small-region scale;
- (3) Regional Guard forces may be supplemented by federal reserve components under Regional Governor command for non-federalized operations, pursuant to agreement between the Region and the Department of Defense;
- (4) This support is an entitlement, not subject to annual appropriation discretion, and shall be funded through mandatory spending.

(f) **Mandatory Pooling for Critical Functions.** Regions with population below two percent of the total population shall enter into pooling agreements with at least one adjacent Region for:

- (1) appellate court operations (trial courts may remain independent),
- (2) specialized law enforcement functions (forensics, cybercrime),
- (3) emergency management coordination.

Such pooling shall preserve each Region's sovereignty and independent governance; pooled functions operate under joint authority with equal Regional representation regardless of population.

(g) For purposes of this section, a "Small Region" is one that meets either:

- (1) population below five percent of the total population of the United States, or
- (2) fiscal capacity below the median fiscal capacity of all Regions.

(h) Fiscal capacity shall be measured by the Independent Fiscal Council using a formula that accounts for tax base, cost of living, and geographic factors. The formula shall be established by statute and reviewed every ten years.

---

### Section 4. Anti-Coercion Rule

Conditional funding that effectively compels unrelated policy compliance is unconstitutional.

---

### Section 5. Independent Fiscal Council

(a) There is hereby established an Independent Fiscal Council (IFC) consisting of seven members appointed as follows:

- (1) two members appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate,
- (2) two members appointed by the Speaker of the House,
- (3) two members appointed by a majority vote of all Regional Governors, and
- (4) one member selected by unanimous agreement of the other six members, who shall serve as Chair.

(b) Members shall serve staggered seven-year terms and may be removed only for cause by a two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress.

(c) The Council shall:

- (3) determine Small Region qualification under Section 3-A(e),
- (4) advise Congress on fiscal federalism matters,
- (5) publish annual reports on the fiscal status of each Region and the effectiveness of equalization transfers.

(d) Council determinations under subsections (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) shall be final and not subject to political override, but may be challenged in federal court for procedural error or constitutional violation.

(e) The Council shall operate with full budgetary independence and shall receive automatic appropriations equal to 0.01% of equalization transfers or $50 million (indexed to inflation), whichever is greater.

(1) All direct obligations of the Regional government;

(2) All obligations of any Regional authority, agency, corporation, or instrumentality created by or on behalf of the Region, regardless of formal legal separation;

(3) All revenue bonds issued by entities in which the Region has an ownership interest, exercises control, or for which Regional action was required for creation;

(4) All public-private partnership obligations where the Region bears contingent liability, guarantees revenue, or provides availability payments;

(2) Regional Development Banks shall maintain leverage ratios not exceeding those applicable to federally-chartered banks;

(3) Regions must submit annual fiscal sustainability reports to the IFC demonstrating compliance;

(4) The IFC may adjust ratios based on economic conditions but may not waive limits entirely.

#### Automatic Conservatorship

(b) **Financial Conservatorship Trigger.**

(1) Exceeding the debt-to-GDP ratio by ten percent or more triggers automatic "Financial Conservatorship" status;

(2) During Conservatorship, the IFC assumes authority over:

- (A) All new Regional borrowing and bond issuance;
- (B) Regional Development Bank operations and lending policies;
- (C) Budget approval for expenditures exceeding operational minimums;

(3) Conservatorship continues until the Region returns to compliance for two consecutive fiscal years;

#### Anti-Extortion Provisions

(c) **Contagion Risk Limitation.**

(1) No Region may condition fiscal responsibility on federal policy concessions;

(2) Threats of "disorderly default" to extract transfers or exemptions constitute grounds for immediate Conservatorship;

(3) The IFC may pre-emptively impose Conservatorship upon finding evidence of deliberate over-leveraging for coercive purposes;

(4) Equalization transfers shall not be increased to remedy self-inflicted fiscal crises caused by deliberate over-borrowing.

#### Orderly Resolution

(d) **Structured Resolution.**

(1) If a Region in Conservatorship cannot achieve fiscal sustainability, the IFC may implement orderly resolution including:

(b) **Receivership Powers.** During Administrative Receivership, the Independent Fiscal Council shall have authority to:

(1) Conduct comprehensive audits of Regional finances, including all revenue sources, expenditures, and obligations;

(2) Require the Region to submit quarterly fiscal reports in a form prescribed by the Council;

(3) Mandate specific revenue reforms, including but not limited to minimum tax rates, broadening of tax bases, elimination of fiscally irresponsible exemptions, and improved collection enforcement;

(4) Require the Region to submit a Fiscal Recovery Plan within one hundred eighty (180) days, subject to Council approval;

(5) Disapprove Regional budgets that the Council determines will perpetuate dependency; and

(6) Require the Region to engage independent fiscal advisors at Regional expense.

(1) Reduce, condition, or otherwise affect the Region's representation in the Senate or any other legislative body;

(2) Reduce, condition, or otherwise affect the voting rights of the Region's citizens in federal elections;

(3) Assume direct control of Regional government operations beyond fiscal matters;

(4) Mandate specific spending cuts to particular programs (the Region retains discretion over expenditure priorities within approved budget levels); or

(5) Impose receivership for reasons other than the objective fiscal trigger in subsection (a).

(d) **Exit from Receivership.** Administrative Receivership terminates automatically when the Region's own-source revenue exceeds fifty percent (50%) of its total expenditures for two consecutive fiscal years.

(e) **Democratic Representation Preserved.** For the avoidance of doubt, a Region in Administrative Receivership retains full and equal representation in the Senate, full participation in all constitutional processes, and all rights of self-governance except as specifically limited by this section. Fiscal dependency shall never be grounds for reducing a Region's democratic voice in the Union.

---

### Section 9. Asymmetric Shock Stabilization

#### Automatic Cyclical Stabilizers

(2) **Capitalization.** The Fund shall be capitalized through:

- (A) A base contribution of 0.5% of national GDP annually during non-crisis periods;
- (B) Countercyclical contributions: Regions experiencing above-average growth contribute an additional 0.25% of Regional GDP;
- (C) Federal Reserve remittances during periods of monetary expansion.

(3) **Target Reserve.** The Fund shall maintain a target reserve of 3% of national GDP, with contributions suspended when target is exceeded.

(d) **Fund Disbursement.** Upon Asymmetric Shock designation:

(1) Automatic transfers commence within thirty (30) days;

(2) Transfer amounts are calculated by formula based on shock severity;

(3) No Congressional appropriation or executive action is required.

---

### Section 10. Fiscal Intervention Hierarchy

The IFC fiscal intervention authorities established in this Article proceed in escalating stages. Each stage requires a finding that lesser interventions are insufficient before proceeding to more intensive measures.

(a) **Intervention Stages.**

(1) **Stage 1: Capacity-Based Equalization Adjustment.** The IFC may adjust equalization calculations under Section 3 to account for self-inflicted fiscal weakness, including:

- (A) Capacity-based calculations that treat forgone tax revenue as if collected (subsidy-neutrality adjustment);
- (B) Predatory subsidy prohibition enforcement;
- (C) Tax expenditure reporting requirements.

(2) **Stage 2: Negligence Finding and Clawback.** If capacity adjustment proves insufficient, the IFC may issue a negligence finding upon determining that Regional fiscal distress results from deliberate policy choices rather than external circumstances:

- (A) Strategic incompetence or deliberate under-collection triggers enhanced reporting;
- (B) Equalization transfers reduced to prevent subsidizing self-inflicted harm;
- (C) Clawback of prior transfers if premised on materially misleading fiscal reporting.

(3) **Stage 3: Solvency Certification Suspension.** If negligence finding proves insufficient:

- (A) The IFC may suspend the Region's solvency certification;
- (B) Suspended certification triggers market disclosure requirements;
- (C) Asset quality floors for Regional Development Banks may be imposed;
- (D) Contagion firewalls activated to protect other Regions.

(4) **Stage 4: Financial Conservatorship.** Only if Stages 1-3 prove insufficient may the IFC impose Financial Conservatorship under Section 7, assuming control over Regional borrowing and major fiscal decisions.

(5) **Stage 5: Administrative Receivership.** If the objective trigger in Section 8(a) is met, Administrative Receivership provides the most intensive intervention.

(b) **Escalation Documentation.** Before proceeding to a higher intervention stage, the IFC shall:

(1) Document why lesser interventions have proven insufficient;

(2) Provide the Region thirty (30) days notice and opportunity to respond;

(3) Issue a public finding justifying escalation.

(c) **De-escalation Path.** The IFC shall reduce intervention intensity when the Region demonstrates sustained compliance:

(1) Each stage requires two consecutive quarters of compliance before de-escalation;

(2) De-escalation proceeds one stage at a time;

(3) The Region may not be re-escalated for the same conduct within twelve (12) months of de-escalation.

---

### Section 11. Fiscal Subsidiarity Protection

#### Tax Base Preservation

(a) **Fiscal Subsidiarity Principle.** Regional and Federal taxation shall not collectively render States unable to fund their enumerated duties through reasonable local taxation.

(b) **IFC Tax Burden Certification.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall certify annually:

(1) The combined Federal-Regional-State effective tax rate for each major tax base (income, payroll, property, sales, corporate);

(2) The proportion of each tax base consumed by Federal and Regional taxation;

(3) Whether the remaining tax capacity is sufficient for States to fund enumerated duties.

(c) **Tax Capacity Floor.** States shall retain access to tax capacity sufficient to fund:

(1) K-12 education at the national average per-pupil expenditure;

(2) Local road maintenance at levels sufficient for public safety;

(3) Essential State administrative functions;

(4) The IFC shall calculate a "Minimum State Tax Capacity" for each State.

(d) **Crowding-Out Prohibition.** If Federal and Regional taxation would reduce State access below the Minimum State Tax Capacity:

(1) The IFC shall notify the offending level(s);

(2) The offending level shall reduce rates or provide compensating transfers within one hundred eighty (180) days;

(3) Failure to comply results in automatic transfer from the offending level to affected States.

## ARTICLE XII - SECESSION, NULLIFICATION, AND DE-ESCALATION

### Section 1. No Secession

No State or Region may secede from the United States.

---

### Section 2. No Nullification

No jurisdiction may nullify constitutional law.

---

### Section 3. De-Escalation

Constitutional conflicts shall be resolved through graduated de-escalation procedures established by statute, prioritizing judicial resolution and avoiding military intervention except as a last resort with multi-key authorization.

The de-escalation sequence shall prioritize:

1. judicial enforcement,
2. administrative remedies,
3. temporary intervention,
4. immediate restoration of self-government upon compliance.

Implementation procedures are established by statute.

#### Imminent Harm Bypass

(a) **Imminent Harm Certification.** The de-escalation sequence may be bypassed if:

(1) The Allocation Review Board certifies imminent harm; or

(2) The Supreme Court certifies imminent harm; or

(3) Both the President and a majority of Regional Governors certify imminent harm.

(b) **Imminent Harm Standards.** Certification requires finding that continued delay poses imminent threat to:

(1) Life or physical safety of persons;

(2) National security or territorial integrity;

(3) The integrity of the National Common Market;

(4) Critical infrastructure necessary for public welfare.

(c) **Expedited Certification.** Imminent harm certification:

(1) Shall be issued within forty-eight (48) hours of request;

(2) May be issued ex parte if exigent circumstances require;

(3) Is not subject to appeal until after federal action concludes.

(d) **Post-Bypass Review.** After imminent harm bypass:

(1) The bypassed de-escalation steps shall be completed retroactively;

(2) If the certification was erroneous, affected parties may recover damages;

(3) Pattern of improper certifications triggers enhanced scrutiny.

#### Stage Time Limits

(e) **Stage Time Limits.** Each stage of the de-escalation sequence has maximum duration:

(1) Initial notification and demand: seventy-two (72) hours;

(2) Administrative mediation: fourteen (14) days;

(3) Judicial review (trial level): thirty (30) days;

(4) Appellate review: fourteen (14) days per level;

(5) Total de-escalation sequence: not to exceed ninety (90) days.

(f) **Automatic Escalation.** Upon expiration of any stage time limit:

(1) The sequence advances automatically to the next stage;

(2) Pending motions or appeals are deemed denied;

(3) No extension may be granted except by unanimous consent of all parties.

(g) **Final Stage Consequence.** Upon expiration of the ninety (90) day total:

(1) All judicial and administrative remedies are deemed exhausted;

(2) Military intervention authority activates automatically;

(3) The Two-Key requirement is satisfied by the exhaustion of alternatives.

#### Bad Faith Participation Finding

(h) **Bad Faith Indicators.** The following constitute evidence of bad faith participation in de-escalation:

(1) Demands that exceed pre-crisis status quo by more than de minimis adjustments;

(2) Failure to attend scheduled mediation sessions without valid excuse;

(3) Continued physical consolidation of contested position during negotiations;

(4) Communication with foreign powers regarding disputed matter during mediation.

(i) **Bad Faith Finding.** Upon finding of bad faith:

(1) The de-escalation sequence terminates immediately;

(2) All pending time limits are deemed expired;

(3) The bad faith actor forfeits the right to further judicial review before federal action.

(j) **Bad Faith Consequences.** The bad faith actor:

(1) Bears all costs of subsequent federal action;

(2) Is estopped from claiming procedural defects;

(3) Responsible officials are personally liable.

#### Anti-Consolidation Measures

(k) **Freeze Order.** Upon initiation of de-escalation sequence:

(1) All parties must maintain positions as of the date of initiation;

(2) Physical fortification, troop movement, or asset seizure is prohibited;

(3) Violation of the freeze order constitutes bad faith.

(l) **Foreign Contact Prohibition.** During de-escalation:

(1) No party may seek foreign recognition, support, or intervention;

(2) No party may negotiate with foreign powers regarding the disputed matter;

(3) Violation of the foreign contact prohibition constitutes bad faith.

(m) **Asset Preservation.** Contested federal assets:

(1) Shall be placed under neutral custodianship (U.S. Marshals or agreed third party);

(2) May not be damaged, sold, or transferred during de-escalation;

(3) Damage or transfer constitutes grounds for immediate federal intervention.

## ARTICLE XIII - CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS

### Section 1. Proposal

Amendments may be proposed by:

- two-thirds of each chamber of Congress, or
- two-thirds of Regional legislatures.

---

### Section 2. Ratification

Amendments require:

- ratification by three-fourths of Regions, and
- approval by a majority of votes cast in a national popular referendum.

No minimum turnout threshold shall be required for the national referendum.

---

### Section 3. Ratification Window

Proposed amendments must be ratified within seven years of proposal. Amendments not ratified within this period expire and must be reproposed to be considered again.

---

### Section 4. No Partial Ratification

No Region may conditionally ratify an amendment or ratify only portions thereof. Ratification must be complete and unconditional.

---

### Section 5. Uniform Application

No amendment may apply asymmetrically among Regions.

---

### Section 6. Commentary on Ratification Threshold

(a) The three-fourths Regional ratification requirement combined with national popular referendum creates a dual legitimacy requirement: both geographic diversity (through Regions) and popular support (through referendum).

(b) The high threshold is intentional. Constitutional amendments should require broad consensus across the federated structure. Regional minority protection is a core value of this Constitution.

(c) The number of Regions may change pursuant to Article I, Section 4. Any boundary revision that would change the number of Regions shall include analysis of the effect on amendment thresholds.

(d) The three-fourths requirement applies to Regions as constituted at the time of ratification vote, not at the time of proposal.

---

### Section 7. Referendum Immunity Protocol

#### Referendum Period Immunity

(a) **Referendum Immunity Period.** A "Referendum Immunity Period" shall begin thirty (30) days before any National Popular Referendum and continue until certification of results:

(1) During this period, special protections apply to ensure democratic participation;

(2) No authority may take action with the purpose or effect of suppressing referendum participation;

(3) The National Electoral Commission shall monitor and enforce Referendum Immunity.

(b) **Emergency Power Limitations.** During the Referendum Immunity Period:

### Section 3. Federal Floor Interpretation Uniformity

#### Mandatory Federal Certification

(a) **Certification Requirement.** When a Regional court of any level issues a ruling interpreting, applying, or effectively exempting any person, entity, or geographic area from a Federal Floor or Federal Framework, the ruling shall not take effect until:

(1) The Federal Supreme Court declines to review the ruling; or

(2) Ninety (90) days pass without the Federal Supreme Court granting certiorari; or

(3) The Federal Supreme Court affirms the Regional interpretation.

(b) **Expanded Trigger.** For purposes of this Section, a ruling "effectively exempts" if it:

(1) Interprets the scope, applicability, or meaning of a Federal Floor or Framework;

(2) Makes a factual finding that a Federal Floor does not apply to specific conditions, actors, or geographic areas;

(3) Determines that local circumstances render a Federal Floor's specific metrics inapplicable; or

(4) Has the practical effect of suspending Federal Floor enforcement for a class of actors, regardless of doctrinal label.

(c) **Automatic Certiorari for Circuit Splits.** If two or more Regional courts have issued conflicting rulings on the same Federal Floor or Framework provision, the Federal Supreme Court shall grant certiorari within thirty (30) days of the second conflicting ruling. The ninety-day automatic effect provision does not apply to circuit split cases; the ruling remains stayed until federal resolution.

(d) **Status Quo Preservation.** During the certification period:

(1) The pre-ruling legal status quo shall remain in effect;

(2) No permits, licenses, or authorizations may be issued based on the contested interpretation;

(3) Parties may not claim reliance on the Regional interpretation for purposes of grandfather provisions, vested rights, or detrimental reliance.

#### Trial Court Injection Prevention

(e) **Trial Court Injection Prevention.**

(1) Any judicial order by any Regional court at any level that stays, enjoins, or suspends the enforcement of a Federal Floor or Framework shall be immediately transmitted to the National Constitutional Court.

(2) Within fifteen (15) days of transmission, the National Constitutional Court shall conduct a Summary Review and either:

- (i) affirm the stay pending full litigation;
- (ii) vacate the stay and require immediate enforcement; or
- (iii) modify the stay with conditions.

(3) Failure to transmit a stay order within forty-eight (48) hours renders the stay void.

(4) This subsection applies regardless of the stage of litigation; trial court injunctions receive the same immediate federal review as appellate rulings.

#### Anti-Reliance Rule

(f) **Reliance Prohibited.** No party may claim vested rights, grandfather status, detrimental reliance, or equitable estoppel based on a Regional court interpretation of a Federal Floor or Framework if:

(1) The interpretation is subject to pending certification under subsection (a);

(2) The interpretation conflicts with interpretations issued by other Regional courts;

(3) A petition for Federal Supreme Court review is pending or has been filed; or

(4) The Federal Supreme Court has granted certiorari.

(g) **Investment Risk Notice.** Permits, licenses, and authorizations issued during contested interpretation periods shall bear a "Contested Interpretation Notice" warning that:

(1) The underlying legal interpretation is subject to federal review;

(2) The permit holder bears the risk of interpretation reversal;

(3) No grandfather rights, reliance claims, or equitable defenses will apply.

(h) **Remediation Liability.** Parties who proceed under a contested interpretation bear full remediation costs if the interpretation is subsequently overturned, including:

(1) Costs of achieving compliance with the correct interpretation;

(2) Environmental remediation or cleanup costs;

(3) Back wages or benefits owed under the correct interpretation;

(4) Civil penalties for the period of non-compliance;

without offset for investments made during the uncertainty period, and without defense of good faith reliance on the Regional interpretation.

---

## ARTICLE XI-RF - REGIONAL GUARD FORCES

### Section 1. Establishment of Regional Guard Forces

(a) Each Region may maintain Regional Guard Forces for:

- disaster response within the Region,
- support of civil authorities at Regional Governor request,
- defense of Regional territory in coordination with federal forces.

(b) Regional Guard Forces are under the command of the Regional Governor except when called into federal service.

---

### Section 2. Federalization of Regional Guard

(a) Regional Guard Forces may be called into federal service:

- upon declaration of war by Congress,
- upon authorization for use of military force approved by two-thirds of the House and Senate,
- for domestic deployment pursuant to two-key authorization (as defined by the Military Civilian Control Amendment if adopted, or by subsection (g) of this section).

(b) When called into federal service, Regional Guard units are commanded by the President through the chain of command.

(c) Federalization for domestic purposes may not exceed ninety days without consent of the affected Region's Governor.

(d) A Regional Governor may refuse federalization of that Region's Guard Forces if:

- no two-key authorization has been obtained, or
- the federalization order directs action against that Governor's own Region.

(e) If the Regional Governor position is vacant or if the Governor has been removed by federal action, the refusal authority under subsection (d) shall be exercised by the acting Governor under Regional succession law, or if none, by the presiding officer of the Regional legislature.

(f) Federalization of a Region's Guard is prohibited for 180 days following removal of that Region's Governor by federal action, unless:

- (1) approved by two-thirds of the Regional legislature, or
- (2) approved by a majority of all other Regional Governors, or
- (3) authorized by the Supreme Court upon finding genuine emergency unrelated to the removal.

(g) **Default Two-Key Authorization.** If the Military Civilian Control Amendment is not adopted, "two-key authorization" for purposes of this article means authorization for domestic deployment of armed forces that requires approval from both:

- (1) **Key 1:** The President (or, if the President is unavailable or incapacitated, the next civilian in the line of succession), and
- (2) **Key 2:** A majority of Regional Governors, or if deployment is limited to a single Region, the Governor of that Region.

Two-key authorization may not be waived, delegated to military officers, or satisfied by implied consent. Deployment without two-key authorization is unlawful and may be refused by commanders without penalty.

(h) **Emergency Response Acceleration.** Notwithstanding subsection (g), the following expedited procedures apply to time-sensitive emergencies:

- (1) **Automatic Approval for Infrastructure Attacks.** When the President certifies that a cyber-physical attack on critical infrastructure (energy grid, water systems, communications networks, transportation systems) requires immediate military response, Regional Governors shall have forty-eight (48) hours to respond to a two-key authorization request. Failure to respond within forty-eight hours shall be deemed consent for the specific deployment requested, limited to defending the affected infrastructure.

- (2) **Supermajority Override.** If five of seven Regional Governors affirmatively authorize deployment, the authorization is valid even if the remaining Governors actively refuse, provided the deployment does not target the refusing Governors' Regions.

- (3) **Judicial Emergency Key.** If a majority of Regional Governors cannot be reached or fail to respond within forty-eight hours during a verified emergency, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court may, upon petition by the President and certification by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that delay poses imminent risk of mass casualties, authorize deployment for up to seventy-two (72) hours pending Governor response. This judicial authorization:
    - (i) requires the Chief Justice to find clear and convincing evidence of imminent threat;
    - (ii) may not be used for any deployment targeting domestic political activity, protests, or civil disturbances;
    - (iii) automatically terminates after seventy-two hours unless Governor majority consent is obtained;
    - (iv) shall be reported to Congress within twenty-four hours.

- (4) **Anti-Brinkmanship Provision.** A Regional Governor who withholds two-key consent while simultaneously demanding unrelated policy concessions from the President shall be deemed to have waived the consent requirement for that authorization request. The Allocation Review Board shall determine whether such conditioning has occurred, with expedited seventy-two-hour review.

---

### Section 3. Integration with State National Guard

(a) State National Guard units continue in existence within the Regional structure.

(b) State National Guard units may be placed under Regional command by agreement between the State and Regional governments.

(c) The Governor of each State retains authority over State National Guard units for State emergencies unless such units have been federalized or placed under Regional command.

(d) State Defense Forces under exclusive State control may be maintained and are not subject to federalization.

(e) Coordination Requirements. State National Guard and Regional Guard Forces shall maintain:

- (1) interoperable communications and command systems,
- (2) joint training exercises at least annually,
- (3) mutual aid agreements specifying support protocols,
- (4) clear precedence rules when operating in same theater.

(f) During concurrent operations, the senior Regional Guard commander shall coordinate overall response unless the emergency is confined to a single State and the Regional Governor has not declared a Regional emergency.

(g) Nothing in this section shall be construed to subordinate State National Guard units to Regional command without agreement under subsection (b), except during federalization or declared Regional emergency requiring unified command.

---

## ARTICLE XVII-RF - REGIONAL EMERGENCY AUTHORITY

### Section 1. Regional Governor Declaration Authority

(a) Regional Governors may declare emergencies for matters within Regional constitutional authority.

- publication and transmission to Regional legislature within twenty-four hours,
- category-specific powers only,
- time limits and reauthorization requirements.

(c) Regional emergencies may not exceed the jurisdiction of the declaring Region. Multi-Regional emergencies require either:

(b) After reaching maximum duration, a Regional emergency may only be renewed by:

- a two-thirds vote of the Regional legislature, and
- approval by the Regional Supreme Court.

(c) Any Regional emergency not reauthorized before expiration terminates automatically. All Regional emergency powers cease immediately.

---

### Section 3. Coordination with Federal Emergency Powers

(b) Regional Governors may request federal emergency assistance. Such requests do not require Regional emergency declaration.

(c) Regional Guard Forces may be deployed under Regional emergency authority without federal approval, subject to the limitations in Article XI-RF.

---

## ARTICLE XVIII - SUPREMACY AND CONSTRUCTION

### Section 2. Floor Presumption

Rights and standards shall be construed as floors unless explicitly stated otherwise.

---

### Section 3. Interpretive Conventions

(a) Capitalized terms "Region," "State," "Tribal Nation," and "Territory" refer to constitutional entities established or recognized by this Constitution.

(b) "Tribal Nation" means a federally recognized Tribal Nation unless otherwise specified.

See Article XXII, Section 1(d).

(c) References to "Regional" institutions (Regional Governor, Regional legislature, Regional courts) use initial capitalization to denote constitutional status.

(d) "Federal" refers to the national government of the United States.

(a) The inherent sovereignty of federally recognized Tribal Nations is hereby reaffirmed. Tribal Nations possess original sovereignty that predates this Constitution and exists independent of federal recognition.

(b) Tribal Nations are not subordinate political subdivisions of the federal government, Regions, States, or territories. The relationship between the United States and Tribal Nations is government-to-government, nation-to-nation.

Federal authority over tribal lands is limited to that arising from treaties, trust responsibilities, and powers expressly consented to by Tribal Nations. Regional and State authority does not extend to tribal lands except by consent of the affected Tribal Nation.

## ARTICLE XXI - IMPLEMENTATION AND DEFAULT RULES

### Section 1. Congressional Implementation Duty

Congress shall enact enabling legislation to implement this Constitution, including but not limited to:

- an Allocation Framework Act defining jurisdictional boundaries and spillover criteria,
- a Fiscal Equalization Act establishing transfer formulas and the Independent Fiscal Council,
- an Elections Implementation Act specifying procedures for federal elections under Regional administration.

---

### Section 2. Default Rules Upon Congressional Failure

(a) If Congress fails to enact the Allocation Framework Act within two years of ratification, the allocation of powers shall be governed by existing federal-state divisions, with Regions exercising authority over matters previously requiring interstate compacts.

(b) If Congress fails to enact the Fiscal Equalization Act within three years of ratification, equalization transfers shall be calculated as flat per-capita grants at a baseline level equal to five percent of federal revenues, distributed to Regions with below-median fiscal capacity.

(b-1) **IFC Adjustment Authority.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall have authority to adjust the default formula annually to maximize regional fiscal capacity equalization, subject to the following:

(1) The five percent rate is a ceiling for default transfers; Congress may enact higher rates by statute;

(2) The default rate does not decline over time absent Congressional action;

(3) Congressional inaction costs Donor Regions (higher automatic transfers) rather than Recipient Regions (declining transfers), inverting the incentive structure to encourage legislative engagement.

(b-2) **Annual Capacity Assessment.** The IFC shall publish annually:

(1) Regional fiscal capacity indices;

(2) Equalization transfer recommendations;

(3) Assessment of whether current transfers achieve constitutional equalization goals.

(b-3) **Emergency Adjustment Trigger.** If the IFC determines that:

(1) Regional fiscal capacity divergence exceeds twenty-five percent (25%) from baseline; OR

(2) Any Region cannot meet basic governmental functions due to fiscal constraints; OR

(3) Economic shocks have rendered existing formulas inadequate;

the IFC may adjust the default transfer formula within the five percent ceiling.

(b-4) **Emergency Adjustment Limitations.** IFC emergency adjustments:

(1) May not exceed twenty percent (20%) change from prior year formula;

(2) Require published justification;

(3) Are subject to Congressional override by simple majority within ninety (90) days.

(b-5) **Anti-Obstruction Provisions.** Fiscal Equalization Acts shall receive expedited consideration:

(1) Privileged motion status in both chambers;

(2) Limited debate time (twenty hours per chamber);

(3) No amendments not germane to fiscal equalization;

(4) Guaranteed floor vote within sixty (60) days of committee reporting.

(b-6) **Poison Pill Prohibition.** Provisions in a Fiscal Equalization Act that:

(1) Address matters unrelated to fiscal equalization;

(2) Would require supermajority approval under other constitutional provisions;

(3) Are designed to make the Act unacceptable to Recipient Regions;

are severable and may be struck by the ARB without invalidating the remainder.

(c) If Congress fails to enact the Elections Implementation Act within two years of ratification, the following default rules apply:

- The national popular vote requirement of Article VII, Section 2 remains in full force.
- Administrative procedures (voter registration, ballot design, counting methods) shall follow prior federal law as adapted for Regional administration.
- Regions assume the administrative role previously held by States.
- Any provisions of prior federal law inconsistent with the national popular vote requirement (including the Electoral College) are superseded and inapplicable.
- If no candidate receives a majority of votes cast, a runoff election between the two candidates receiving the most votes shall be held within twenty-one days. If Congress has enacted a different majority mechanism (such as ranked-choice voting or instant runoff), that mechanism supersedes this default.

(d) If Congress fails to enact appropriations for any fiscal year by the start of that fiscal year, the following automatic fiscal continuation shall apply:

- Spending shall continue at the prior fiscal year's enacted levels for all previously authorized programs.
- Prior-year levels shall be adjusted by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or by a successor index designated by statute.
- No new programs, expansions of existing programs, or new spending initiatives may be funded under automatic continuation.
- Automatic continuation terminates upon enactment of appropriations for the affected fiscal year.

(e) Default rules remain in effect until Congress enacts superseding legislation.

---

### Section 3. Purpose

These default rules exist to prevent deliberate nonimplementation from becoming a method of constitutional sabotage. The Constitution shall operate even if Congress fails to act.
