# Regional Structure

## Part I: Article I - Regions of the United States

*This document contains the core regional structure provisions of the Regional Federal Constitution.*

---

## Preamble

We, the People of the United States, in order to preserve the Union, restore democratic legitimacy, secure liberty against concentration of power, and ensure that self-government remains possible in a large and diverse republic, do hereby amend the Constitution to establish a system of **Regional Federalism**.

This amendment package is adopted to:

- align governance with modern economic and social reality,
- reduce existential political conflict,
- prevent authoritarian consolidation,
- preserve national unity without coercive uniformity,
- and ensure that no single institution may dominate the constitutional order.

---

## ARTICLE I - REGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES

### Section 1. Establishment of Regions

The United States shall be composed of multiple **Regions**, each consisting of a grouping of States, established by this Constitution and alterable only by constitutional amendment or the boundary revision process specified herein.

Regions are permanent constitutional entities and are not administrative subdivisions of the federal government.

---

### Section 2. Legal Status

Regions possess inherent governing authority within their enumerated powers, derived from the People of the Region and recognized by this Constitution.

No Region is sovereign. Sovereignty resides in the People of the United States.

---

### Section 3. Regional Constitutions

Each Region shall adopt a republican constitution consistent with:

- this Constitution,
- federal rights floors,
- democratic process guarantees.

Regional constitutions shall provide for:

- universal suffrage,
- independent redistricting processes,
- proportionality and competitiveness standards for elections,
- explicit protection against domination by any single metropolitan area or rural bloc.

The structural form of Regional government (unicameral or bicameral legislature, electoral system) shall be determined by each Region, subject to the foregoing requirements.

---

### Section 4. Regional Boundary Revision

(a) Regional boundaries may be revised without full constitutional amendment through a process requiring:

- an Independent Boundary Review Commission to assess and recommend changes,
- approval by two-thirds of the legislature of each affected Region,
- approval by national popular referendum.

(b) The Commission shall be structured to ensure independence from partisan control, with members drawn from multiple appointing authorities and subject to disqualification for recent partisan activity.

(c) Congress shall establish by statute the criteria for boundary revision, Commission procedures, and referendum processes.

(d) No boundary revision may be proposed, voted upon, or take effect within one year before or six months after a federal presidential election.

(e) Implementation procedures are established by statute. See the [Regional Boundary Review and Revision Act](../../proposals/01-foundations/boundary-review-act.md) for the proposed implementing legislation.

#### State Transfer Mechanism

(f) **Tiered Transfer Approval.** A State may transfer from one Region to another pursuant to the following procedures:

| Transfer Type | Threshold | Requirements |
|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Bilateral Agreement** | Supermajority (2/3) of both Regional legislatures + State referendum (55%) | Consent from all affected parties |
| **Unilateral Departure** | State referendum (60%) + ARB certification + 3-year waiting period | Higher bar for non-consensual departure |
| **Contested Transfer** | Supreme Court determination | Prevents hostage-taking by blocking Region |

(g) **Fundamental Misalignment Standard.** The ARB shall certify "Fundamental Misalignment" based on objective criteria. Certification is **automatic** if the State demonstrates any two of the following for two consecutive years:

(1) The State's primary economic trading partners are greater than sixty percent (60%) outside its current Region, as measured by interstate commerce data published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis; OR

(2) The State's labor market integration (cross-border commuting, migration) is greater than fifty percent (50%) with an adjacent Region, as measured by Census Bureau commuting data; OR

(3) The State's median voter policy preferences diverge from the Regional median by more than 1.5 standard deviations on three or more major policy domains, as measured by the biennial National Policy Preference Survey administered by the Federal Election Commission; OR

(4) The State shares a contiguous border with the destination Region and does not share a contiguous border with any other State in its current Region.

(h) **Waiting Period.** A State initiating Unilateral Departure shall complete a three (3) year waiting period during which:

(1) The State remains subject to all origin-Region obligations;

(2) The ARB shall verify continued Fundamental Misalignment at Year 2;

(3) The State may withdraw its transfer application at any time;

(4) Business investment decisions made during the waiting period shall not be subject to retroactive regulatory changes by either Region.

(i) **Policy Continuity Rule.** A transferring State shall remain subject to its former Region's regulatory and tax floors for a period of three (3) years following transfer, with floors declining by one-third (33%) annually toward the new Region's standards. During this period:

(1) Businesses may elect to be governed by either the origin Region's or destination Region's standards, provided they declare their election at the beginning of each fiscal year;

(2) This election does not affect individual rights protections, which remain subject to the higher floor;

(3) The destination Region may not impose requirements exceeding those of the origin Region during the transition period.

#### Anti-Region-Shopping Provisions

(j) **Anti-Arbitrage Certification.** No transfer shall be approved if the ARB determines, based on objective evidence, that arbitrage is the dominant purpose. Arbitrage shall be presumed if:

(1) The destination Region's effective corporate tax rate is more than five (5) percentage points lower than the origin Region's, AND the State cannot demonstrate Fundamental Misalignment under subsection (g); OR

(2) The destination Region's environmental compliance costs are more than thirty percent (30%) lower than the origin Region's, AND the State cannot demonstrate Fundamental Misalignment under subsection (g); OR

(3) The State government or its officials have publicly stated regulatory or tax avoidance as a primary motivation.

(k) **Burden of Proof.**

(1) Where the destination Region maintains lower floors in any domain enumerated in subsection (j), the transferring State bears the burden of demonstrating non-arbitrage purpose by a preponderance of evidence (not clear and convincing evidence).

(2) If the State establishes Fundamental Misalignment under subsection (g), the burden shifts to any objecting party to prove arbitrage as the dominant purpose by clear and convincing evidence.

(l) **Expedited ARB Review.** The ARB shall resolve transfer disputes within ninety (90) days of filing, not the general 180-day timeline. The ARB shall issue preliminary certification or denial within forty-five (45) days, with the remaining period for any appeals or supplemental submissions.

(m) **Regional Membership Permanence.** Once assigned, Regional membership is irrevocable until the next decennial review; selective coordination withdrawal does not exempt a State from Regional authority.

---

### Section 5. Inter-Regional Cooperation

(a) Two or more Regions may enter into agreements for cooperative action on any matter within their respective powers.

(b) Such agreements require no federal approval unless they:

- affect federal enumerated powers,
- create binding obligations on non-participating Regions,
- or conflict with federal law enacted pursuant to enumerated powers.

(c) Regions may establish joint institutions, shared programs, cooperative purchasing arrangements, and coordinated policy frameworks.

(d) Inter-Regional agreements shall specify:

- governance structure and decision-making procedures,
- cost-sharing and fiscal responsibilities,
- dispute resolution mechanisms,
- withdrawal procedures and transition provisions.

(e) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize Regions to jointly exercise powers reserved to the federal government or to create obligations binding on the United States.

---

### Section 6. Right of Transit and Non-Blockade

(a) No Region may deny, obstruct, or unreasonably condition access to transportation, energy, or communication infrastructure connecting other Regions. All Regions have rights of transit through other Regions on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.

(b) Infrastructure fees shall be non-discriminatory, cost-based, and transparent.

(c) This section does not require Regions to build new infrastructure, only to maintain reasonable access to existing infrastructure connecting other Regions.

#### Infrastructure Closure Review

(d) **Emergency Shutdown Expedited Review.** When any Region declares an emergency shutdown, initiates unscheduled maintenance, or imposes capacity restrictions on inter-Regional infrastructure:

(1) The declaration shall automatically trigger an expedited review by the Allocation Review Board within seventy-two hours;

(2) The declaring Region bears the burden of demonstrating genuine safety necessity by clear and convincing evidence;

(3) Failure to demonstrate necessity results in mandatory reopening within forty-eight hours.

(e) **Genuine Safety Necessity Standard.** To satisfy the "genuine safety necessity" requirement:

(1) The Region must identify a specific, documented hazard;

(2) The closure must be proportionate to the hazard (full closure only if partial measures insufficient);

(3) The estimated repair timeline must be technically justified;

(4) Economic impact on affected Regions must be considered as a factor, though not dispositive.

(f) **Prolonged Closure Presumption.** Any infrastructure closure or restriction exceeding seven days creates a rebuttable presumption of unreasonableness:

(1) The Region must file detailed justification with the ARB every seven days;

(2) Each seven-day extension requires renewed demonstration of necessity;

(3) Failure to file creates automatic referral for federal operational assumption.

(g) **Cumulative Obstruction Assessment.** The ARB shall assess patterns of infrastructure restriction:

(1) Three or more closures affecting the same corridor within twelve months triggers cumulative review;

(2) "Rolling maintenance" schedules that cumulatively exceed thirty days annually create presumption of strategic obstruction;

(3) Pattern finding shifts burden to Region for all future closures.

(h) **Alternative Route Requirements.** During any closure or restriction:

(1) The Region shall provide functional alternative routing at equivalent or lower cost;

(2) Increased costs for alternative routing borne by the closing Region;

(3) Failure to provide alternatives constitutes per se violation.

(i) **Processing Time Standards.** For infrastructure subject to inspection, certification, or processing requirements:

(1) Processing times shall not exceed national median for comparable facilities;

(2) Deviation exceeding fifty percent from median creates presumption of obstruction;

(3) ARB may mandate processing timeline improvements.

(j) **Rate Regulation for Constrained Corridors.** Rates for transit through partially closed or capacity-restricted infrastructure:

(1) Shall not exceed rates in effect prior to the restriction;

(2) No "scarcity premium" or "congestion pricing" permitted during capacity emergencies;

(3) Any rate increase during restriction period is void.

(k) **Cost-Based Rate Requirement.** Infrastructure user fees shall be based solely on:

(1) Documented maintenance and operational costs;

(2) Capital recovery for improvements directly benefiting users;

(3) Reasonable administrative overhead not exceeding fifteen percent of direct costs.

(l) **Rate Dispute Freeze.** When a fee is challenged:

(1) The pre-dispute rate remains in effect until ARB resolution;

(2) No retroactive collection permitted for disputed amounts;

(3) Resolution within sixty days required.

#### Remedies and Enforcement

(m) **Full Damages for Unreasonable Restrictions.** When the ARB finds an infrastructure restriction was not supported by genuine safety necessity:

(1) Affected Regions and private parties may recover full economic damages;

(2) Damages include direct losses, consequential damages, and litigation costs;

(3) No sovereign immunity defense available for infrastructure violations.

(n) **Treble Damages for Bad Faith.** When the ARB finds a restriction was imposed in bad faith—for purposes of economic coercion rather than safety:

(1) Treble damages are mandatory;

(2) Regional officials responsible for the decision are personally liable;

(3) Pattern bad faith triggers federal operational assumption.

(o) **Federal Operational Assumption.** When a Region refuses to comply with ARB order to reopen or de-restrict infrastructure:

(1) Federal agencies may assume operational control;

(2) Federal operation continues until the Region demonstrates compliance;

(3) Costs of federal operation are charged to the non-compliant Region.

(p) **Repeat Offender Designation.** Regions found to have engaged in unreasonable infrastructure conditioning three or more times within ten years:

(1) Lose unilateral authority over inter-Regional infrastructure;

(2) All future maintenance, closures, and rate changes require ARB pre-approval;

(3) Designation continues for ten years or until the Region demonstrates reformed practices.

#### National Infrastructure Transparency System

(q) **National Infrastructure Transparency System Established.** The Department of Transportation, in coordination with the Department of Energy, the Independent Fiscal Council, and the Allocation Review Board, shall maintain a publicly accessible National Infrastructure Transparency System (NITS) containing:

(1) Real-time operational status of all inter-Regional transit corridors, energy transmission lines, and pipeline infrastructure;

(2) All emergency declarations, maintenance schedules, and capacity restrictions affecting inter-Regional infrastructure;

(3) Complete technical justifications for any closure, restriction, or capacity reduction;

(4) Historical data on infrastructure availability, maintenance frequency, and processing times by corridor and Region;

(5) All inter-Regional transit fee schedules with cost justification summaries;

(6) Fee challenge status, pending disputes, and resolution outcomes.

(r) **Mandatory Real-Time Disclosure.** When a Region declares an emergency shutdown, initiates maintenance, imposes capacity restrictions, or changes fee schedules:

(1) The Region shall upload complete technical or cost justification to NITS within four hours for emergencies, thirty days for fee changes;

(2) Justification must include specific hazard identification, engineering assessments, estimated duration, or audited cost documentation;

(3) Supporting data (inspection reports, sensor readings, engineering analyses, financial records) must be made publicly available;

(4) Updates shall be filed every twenty-four hours during ongoing closures.

(s) **No Classified Infrastructure Justifications.** Regions may not invoke national security, proprietary information, or any confidentiality doctrine to withhold infrastructure closure or fee justifications:

(1) All safety, maintenance, and cost justifications are inherently public information;

(2) If a closure involves genuinely classified federal security matters, only the federal government (not the Region) may invoke classification, and must assume operational responsibility for the closure;

(3) Regional invocation of "classified" or "proprietary" justification creates irrebuttable presumption of bad faith and triggers immediate federal review.

(t) **Public Accountability Metrics.** NITS shall publish monthly:

(1) "Infrastructure Reliability Scores" for each Region based on closure frequency, duration, and justification adequacy;

(2) "Fee Reasonableness Scores" for each Region comparing fees to cost-plus standards;

(3) Comparison of stated maintenance needs to industry benchmarks;

(4) Economic impact estimates of closures and fees on affected Regions;

(5) Identification of patterns suggesting strategic rather than safety-motivated closures;

(6) Historical fee trends and comparisons across Regions.

(u) **Cost-Plus Fee Ceiling.** Inter-Regional transit fees shall not exceed one hundred ten percent of documented costs:

(1) "Documented costs" means actual operating costs plus capital recovery plus reasonable administrative overhead;

(2) The IFC shall establish uniform accounting standards for cost calculation;

(3) Costs shall be audited annually and published in NITS.

(v) **Aggregate Fee Limitation.** The aggregate of all fees, charges, and assessments imposed on inter-Regional transit shall not exceed the one hundred ten percent cost-plus ceiling:

(1) Regions may not circumvent the ceiling through multiple fee categories;

(2) "Environmental," "climate adaptation," "safety," and "modernization" charges count toward the aggregate;

(3) The IFC shall monitor for fee multiplication strategies.

(w) **Summary Suspension Authority.** The ARB may summarily suspend fee collection when:

(1) Prima facie evidence suggests the fee exceeds the one hundred ten percent ceiling;

(2) Suspension remains in effect pending full review;

(3) The charging Region bears the burden of proving cost compliance;

(4) Failure to provide audited cost documentation creates rebuttable presumption of violation;

(5) The ARB may access Regional financial records for verification.

#### Anti-Retaliation

(x) **Non-Retaliation.** Regions may not:

(1) Increase fees in response to fee challenges by specific users;

(2) Impose selective enforcement of ancillary requirements against challengers;

(3) Delay processing of challengers' transit relative to non-challengers;

(4) Impose new requirements targeting entities that filed ARB complaints.

(y) **Challenger Protection.** Entities filing infrastructure or fee challenges:

(1) Shall have access to expedited ARB review;

(2) May recover attorney fees and costs if challenge is successful;

(3) Are protected from any adverse action by the challenged Region.

(z) **Whistleblower Provisions.** Regional employees who report infrastructure abuse:

(1) Are protected from termination, demotion, or adverse action;

(2) May file directly with ARB under seal;

(3) May receive a portion of any damages recovered.

(aa) Implementation procedures are established by statute. See the [National Common Market Access Act](../../proposals/03-economy-commerce/national-common-market-access-act.md) for the proposed implementing legislation.

### Section 7. Water Rights and Shared Waterways

(a) Interstate rivers, lakes, aquifers, and watersheds that cross or border Regional boundaries are shared resources. Water allocation among Regions shall be governed by principles of equitable apportionment.

(b) No Region may unilaterally divert, dam, or appropriate water in a manner that substantially diminishes the quantity or quality of water available to other Regions, or discharge pollutants that render water unusable by other Regions.

(c) Existing interstate water compacts shall remain in force unless superseded by Regional agreement or federal law.

(d) Nothing in this section shall diminish treaty obligations to Tribal Nations regarding water rights or authorize taking of water rights without just compensation.

(e) **Water Resources Coordination Board.** There is hereby established a Water Resources Coordination Board consisting of:

- one representative appointed by each Region,
- one representative of the Environmental Protection Agency,
- one representative of the Army Corps of Engineers,
- two representatives of Tribal Nations with water rights in affected watersheds (selected by a council of affected Tribes).

The Board shall coordinate water allocation, establish monitoring standards, and facilitate dispute resolution through mediation before adjudication.

(f) **National Water Court.** There is hereby established a National Water Court with exclusive original jurisdiction over interstate water disputes. The Court shall consist of five judges appointed by the President with Senate confirmation for twelve-year non-renewable terms, drawn from persons with expertise in water law, hydrology, or environmental science. At least two judges shall have experience representing Western states with prior appropriation systems, and at least two shall have experience representing Eastern states with riparian rights systems. The Court's decisions may be appealed to the Supreme Court on questions of constitutional interpretation.

(g) Implementation procedures are established by statute. See the [Interstate Water Resources Coordination Act](../../proposals/05-environment-infrastructure/water-resources-coordination-act.md) for the proposed implementing legislation.

---

### Section 8. Freedom of Movement

(a) All citizens of the United States shall have the right to:

- travel freely between and within Regions,
- establish residence in any Region,
- seek employment in any Region,
- access public services on equal terms with residents after establishing residence.

(b) No Region may:

- impose border controls, checkpoints, or travel documentation requirements for movement between Regions,
- require waiting periods exceeding ninety days for access to public services for new residents (excluding residency requirements for voting, which shall not exceed thirty days),
- discriminate in employment, housing, or public accommodations based on Region of origin,
- condition professional licensure or credentialing on Region of prior residence.

(c) Durational residency requirements are permissible only for:

- voting registration (not exceeding thirty days),
- in-state tuition eligibility at public institutions (not exceeding twelve months),
- candidacy for elected office (as established by statute, not exceeding the term length of the office sought).

(d) This section shall not be construed to:

- require Regions to subsidize relocation,
- prevent reasonable transition periods for benefit eligibility where portability is ensured,
- override legitimate public health quarantine measures during declared emergencies.

(e) A person whose freedom of movement has been impaired may seek injunctive relief in any Regional court, with expedited review (seven days).

---

### Section 9. Mutual Recognition

(a) Full Faith and Credit. Each jurisdiction shall give full faith and credit to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other jurisdiction.

(b) Legal Status Recognition. Marriages, divorces, adoptions, name changes, powers of attorney, corporate registrations, and property titles established under any jurisdiction's law shall be recognized in all other jurisdictions.

(c) Professional Credentials. Professional licenses shall be recognized for practice in all jurisdictions, subject only to registration, reasonable fees, and verification of good standing. Supplementary requirements may be imposed only where the receiving jurisdiction's standards demonstrably exceed those of the issuing jurisdiction.

(d) Academic Credentials. Educational degrees from accredited institutions shall be recognized throughout the United States.

(e) No jurisdiction may refuse recognition based on religious or moral objection, political disagreement, economic protectionism, or retaliation.

(f) Implementation procedures are established by statute. See the [Interstate Professional Licensing Reciprocity Act](../../proposals/04-social-policy-labor/interstate-professional-licensing-act.md) for the proposed implementing legislation.

#### Rebuttable Presumption of Competency

(g) **Presumption of Competency.** A credential validly issued by any Region creates a rebuttable presumption of competency to practice in all Regions:

(1) The receiving Region bears the burden of demonstrating that supplementary requirements are necessary;

(2) The standard for supplementary requirements is "Essential for Public Safety" (not merely "demonstrably exceed");

(3) Convenience, preference, or economic protection do not constitute public safety necessity.

(h) **Essential for Public Safety Standard.** A supplementary requirement is "Essential for Public Safety" only if:

(1) It addresses a specific, documented risk to public health, safety, or welfare;

(2) The risk is unique to the receiving Region and not adequately addressed by the issuing Region's standards;

(3) The requirement is narrowly tailored to address only that specific risk;

(4) Less restrictive alternatives are inadequate.

(i) **Prohibited Justifications.** The following do not constitute public safety necessity:

(1) General assertions that Regional standards are "higher" or "more rigorous";

(2) Economic impact on existing Regional practitioners;

(3) Differences in educational institution accreditation;

(4) Requirements for Region-specific knowledge not directly related to professional competency.

#### ARB Pre-Approval for Supplementary Requirements

(j) **ARB Certification Required.** Before imposing any supplementary credential requirement on out-of-Region professionals, a Region must:

(1) Submit the proposed requirement to the Allocation Review Board;

(2) Demonstrate that the requirement meets the "Essential for Public Safety" standard;

(3) Receive ARB certification within ninety (90) days.

(k) **Automatic Recognition.** If the ARB fails to rule within ninety (90) days:

(1) The supplementary requirement is deemed not certified;

(2) The out-of-Region credential must be recognized without supplement;

(3) The Region may resubmit with additional justification.

(l) **Grandfathering.** Supplementary requirements in effect at ratification:

(1) Remain valid for two (2) years;

(2) Must be submitted for ARB certification within one (1) year;

(3) Uncertified requirements become void after the two-year transition period.

#### Anti-Protectionism Provisions

(m) **Facially Neutral Discrimination.** A credential requirement that is facially neutral but has disparate impact on out-of-Region professionals:

(1) Is subject to strict scrutiny;

(2) Must be justified by compelling public safety interest;

(3) Creates rebuttable presumption of protectionist intent if adopted within twenty-four (24) months of significant credential migration.

(n) **Prohibited Practices.** Regions may not:

(1) Require continuing education obtainable only within the Region;

(2) Impose "cultural competency" or "regional knowledge" requirements beyond those directly necessary for professional practice;

(3) Condition reciprocity on political, economic, or policy concessions;

(4) Revoke reciprocity for reasons unrelated to credential standards.

(o) **Expedited Judicial Review.** Professionals denied credential recognition may:

(1) Appeal directly to the National Constitutional Court;

(2) Receive expedited ruling within sixty (60) days;

(3) Practice under provisional recognition pending appeal if they demonstrate valid out-of-Region credential.

---

### Section 10. Data Sovereignty and Critical Governance Data

#### Critical Governance Data Classification

(a) **Critical Governance Data Defined.** The following categories constitute "Critical Governance Data" subject to this section:

(1) **Electoral Data:** Voter registration, election results, redistricting data, campaign finance records;

(2) **Fiscal Data:** Tax assessments, collections, expenditures, and audit records at all levels;

(3) **Infrastructure Data:** Energy grid telemetry, water system monitoring, transportation network status, communications infrastructure;

(4) **Identity Data:** Citizenship records, vital statistics (birth, death, marriage), professional licensing;

(5) **Public Safety Data:** Law enforcement records, emergency response data, public health surveillance.

(b) **Shared Constitutional Utility.** Critical Governance Data is hereby declared a "Shared Constitutional Utility":

(1) No single level of government has exclusive ownership;

(2) All levels with constitutional functions requiring the data have access rights;

(3) The physical location of servers or infrastructure does not determine ownership or control.

(c) **Interoperability Mandate.** All Critical Governance Data systems shall:

(1) Use standardized formats enabling cross-level access;

(2) Maintain real-time or near-real-time synchronization where technically feasible;

(3) Provide API access to authorized government entities at all levels.

(d) **IFC Data Standards Authority.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall establish and maintain:

(1) Technical standards for Critical Governance Data interoperability;

(2) Security protocols for data access and transmission;

(3) Audit procedures for data integrity verification.

#### Prohibition on Digital Blockade

(e) **Prohibition on Data Denial.** No Federal, Regional, or State government may:

(1) Deny, restrict, or condition another level's access to Critical Governance Data necessary for that level's constitutional functions;

(2) Encrypt, silo, or technically obstruct access to shared data systems;

(3) Require approval, licensing, or payment for access to data necessary for constitutional functions;

(4) Provide data in formats designed to impede practical use.

(f) **Constitutional Function Nexus.** Access rights attach when:

(1) The requesting level has an enumerated constitutional power;

(2) Exercise of that power requires the specific data requested;

(3) The nexus between data and function is not pretextual.

(g) **Presumption of Access.** Requests for Critical Governance Data:

(1) Are presumptively valid when made by an authorized government entity;

(2) Must be fulfilled within seventy-two hours absent legitimate technical constraints;

(3) May be denied only upon specific, written justification subject to ARB review.

(h) **Technical Obstruction as Violation.** Providing data in deliberately unusable formats, imposing unreasonable technical requirements, or maintaining "legacy systems" that prevent interoperability without documented modernization plans:

(1) Constitutes constructive denial;

(2) Is subject to the same penalties as outright refusal;

(3) Creates rebuttable presumption of bad faith if the obstructing level has opposed the requesting level's exercise of constitutional authority.

#### Data Integrity and Reconciliation

(i) **Single Source of Truth.** For each category of Critical Governance Data, the IFC shall designate:

(1) A "Primary Custodian" responsible for maintaining the authoritative record;

(2) Reconciliation procedures when multiple sources conflict;

(3) Appeals process for disputed data.

(j) **Primary Custodian Assignment.**

(1) **Electoral Data:** State governments, subject to Federal and Regional audit rights;

(2) **Citizenship/Identity Data:** Federal government;

(3) **Infrastructure Data:** Level operating the infrastructure, subject to oversight access by regulators;

(4) **Tax Data:** Collecting level, with mandatory sharing to other levels with tax authority over same base.

(k) **Mandatory Reconciliation.** When data from different levels conflicts:

(1) The levels shall conduct reconciliation within thirty days;

(2) If reconciliation fails, the IFC shall determine the authoritative record;

(3) Levels refusing to participate in reconciliation forfeit their position in any dispute.

(l) **Audit Rights.** Any level of government may:

(1) Audit Critical Governance Data maintained by another level for accuracy;

(2) Request independent verification by the IFC;

(3) Publish audit findings (excluding personally identifiable information).

#### Privacy and Security Protections

(m) **Privacy Preservation.** Data access under this section:

(1) Is limited to data necessary for constitutional functions;

(2) Does not authorize disclosure to private parties without independent legal authority;

(3) Requires compliance with applicable privacy laws and the National Rights Floor;

(4) Prohibits use of accessed data for purposes beyond the stated constitutional function.

(n) **Security Requirements.** All Critical Governance Data systems shall:

(1) Meet cybersecurity standards established by the IFC in consultation with federal cybersecurity agencies;

(2) Maintain access logs subject to audit;

(3) Implement role-based access controls limiting data exposure to authorized personnel.

(o) **Breach Notification.** Any breach of Critical Governance Data:

(1) Must be reported to all affected levels within twenty-four hours;

(2) Must be reported to the public within seventy-two hours;

(3) Triggers mandatory security review by the IFC.

(p) **No Privacy Shield for Obstruction.** Privacy concerns may not be invoked to:

(1) Deny government-to-government data sharing for constitutional functions;

(2) Justify encryption or access controls that exclude other government levels;

(3) The privacy of individuals is protected by limiting downstream use, not by blocking intergovernmental access.

#### Enforcement and Remedies

(q) **Digital Blockade as Constitutional Violation.** Denial of Critical Governance Data access:

(1) Constitutes a violation of this Constitution equivalent to physical obstruction of federal officers;

(2) May be enjoined by the National Constitutional Court;

(3) Officials responsible for denial are personally liable and may be removed from office.

(r) **Emergency Access Orders.** If a level claims urgent need for data access:

(1) The ARB may issue an Emergency Access Order within twenty-four hours;

(2) The order requires immediate compliance pending full adjudication;

(3) Failure to comply with an Emergency Access Order constitutes contempt.

(s) **Federal Data Backup Authority.** If a State or Region persistently denies data access:

(1) The Federal government may establish parallel data collection systems;

(2) The obstructing level bears the cost of duplicate systems;

(3) Federal data becomes authoritative for federal functions regardless of State/Regional objection.

(t) **Integration with Infrastructure Protections.** Data and telemetry shall be treated as "transit-protected assets" under Section 6:

(1) Digital blockade is subject to the same review and penalties as physical infrastructure obstruction;

(2) The National Infrastructure Transparency System shall include data system availability;

(3) "Data Reliability Scores" shall be published alongside infrastructure reliability scores.

(u) **Specialized Data Access Provisions.** Nothing in this section limits:

(1) Federal Data Supremacy for rights enforcement under Article II, Section 1;

(2) Forensic audit authority under Article X, Section 3;

(3) Algorithmic transparency requirements established by statute pursuant to this section;

(4) Transition data requirements under the Transition Framework.

(v) **Hierarchy of Access.** When specialized provisions conflict with general provisions:

(1) Rights enforcement access takes precedence for individual rights data;

(2) Forensic audit authority takes precedence for fiscal data;

(3) General provisions of this section apply as default for all other data categories.

(w) **Privacy Reconciliation.** The privacy protections of subsection (m) are reconciled with specialized access as follows:

(1) Minimization requirements of subsection (m) apply to all specialized access;

(2) Use restrictions of subsection (m)(4) apply regardless of access authority;

(3) Specialized provisions may expand access scope but not diminish privacy safeguards.

(x) **Federal Data Coordination Agency.** There is hereby established a Federal Data Coordination Agency with the following responsibilities:

(1) **Technical Standards Development.** The Agency shall develop and maintain binding technical standards for Critical Governance Data interoperability, including:
- (i) data format specifications and schema requirements;
- (ii) API protocols and authentication standards;
- (iii) encryption and security requirements;
- (iv) synchronization frequency and latency requirements by data category.

(2) **Legacy System Transition.** The Agency shall:
- (i) inventory all existing government data systems within two years of ratification;
- (ii) establish a ten-year transition timeline for legacy system compliance;
- (iii) provide technical assistance and funding to jurisdictions for system modernization;
- (iv) grant compliance extensions for demonstrated hardship, not to exceed five additional years.

(3) **Security Coordination.** The Agency shall maintain a unified security operations center for Critical Governance Data that:
- (i) monitors for unauthorized access attempts across all jurisdictions;
- (ii) coordinates incident response for data breaches affecting multiple jurisdictions;
- (iii) conducts annual security audits of all connected systems;
- (iv) maintains backup and disaster recovery capabilities for Critical Governance Data.

(4) **Composition.** The Agency shall be governed by a board consisting of:
- (i) one representative appointed by each Regional Governor;
- (ii) two representatives appointed by the President;
- (iii) one representative appointed by the Chief Justice;
- (iv) one non-voting technical advisor selected by the board from the private sector.

(5) **Funding.** The Agency shall be funded through mandatory appropriations not subject to annual discretion, apportioned among the federal government and Regions based on data system usage.

(y) **Liability for Interoperability Failures.** A jurisdiction that fails to maintain interoperability as required by this section and thereby causes demonstrable harm to another jurisdiction's constitutional functions shall be liable for:

(1) actual damages incurred by the affected jurisdiction;

(2) costs of alternative data access arrangements;

(3) civil penalties not to exceed $100,000 per day of non-compliance following notice and a ninety-day cure period.

### Section 11. Environmental Border Protection

(a) No jurisdiction may externalize environmental harms to other jurisdictions through pollution siting, emissions, discharges, hazardous waste disposal, or land use practices that cause transboundary harm.

(b) Affected jurisdictions may seek injunctive relief, compensatory damages, and remediation orders. The Environmental Protection Agency shall maintain monitoring capacity and enforcement authority.

### Section 12. Cross-Jurisdictional Law Enforcement Cooperation

(a) Jurisdictions shall cooperate in criminal law enforcement through extradition, hot pursuit, and mutual legal assistance.

(c) No jurisdiction may adopt policies designed to shield individuals from lawful prosecution for crimes of violence, fraud, or harm to minors.

(d) Nothing in this section shall require cooperation in enforcement of laws violating federal rights floors, participation in pretextual or politically motivated actions, or diminishment of Tribal sovereignty over criminal matters.

(e) Implementation procedures are established by statute. See the [Interstate Law Enforcement Cooperation Act](../../proposals/06-security-justice/interstate-law-enforcement-cooperation-act.md) for the proposed implementing legislation.

### Section 13. Interstate Compacts

(a) Existing Compacts. All interstate compacts in effect at ratification continue in force unless:

- superseded by Regional agreement among all affected Regions,
- terminated according to their own terms,
- or found to conflict with this Constitution.

(b) State-Level Compacts. Compacts between States within the same Region become matters of Regional law. The Regional legislature may modify or terminate such compacts by statute.

(c) Cross-Regional Compacts. Compacts between States in different Regions continue as interstate compacts. Such compacts may be:

- assumed by the relevant Regions by mutual agreement,
- renegotiated as inter-Regional agreements under Section 5,
- or continued under existing State administration.

(d) Federal-State Compacts. Compacts between the federal government and one or more States continue as federal-Regional compacts, with the relevant Region(s) assuming State obligations.

(e) Compact Agencies. Agencies created by interstate compact (such as port authorities, transit authorities, and river commissions) continue in existence under their existing governance structures unless:

- modified by agreement of all participating jurisdictions,
- or reorganized pursuant to Regional law for agencies operating wholly within one Region.

(f) Compact Review. Within five years of ratification, the Allocation Review Board shall review all existing interstate compacts and issue guidance on their status under this Constitution. This review is advisory; compacts remain in force pending legislative action.

### Schedule Notes

(a) The District of Columbia is not assigned to any Region upon ratification. Its Regional assignment shall be determined pursuant to Article XX, Section 1(b).

(b) United States territories are not assigned to any Region upon ratification. Their Regional assignment shall be determined pursuant to Article XX, Section 2(a).

(c) Tribal lands within State boundaries remain under tribal and federal jurisdiction as provided in Article XX, Section 3.

(d) These initial boundaries are based on geographic, economic, and demographic considerations as of ratification. Future boundary revisions shall follow the process established in Article I, Section 4.

(e) Population and Fiscal Capacity Considerations.

(1) Regions vary substantially in population. As of ratification, approximate populations are:

- Northeast: 60 million
- Southeast: 75 million
- Midwest: 52 million
- Great Plains: 14 million
- Southwest: 52 million
- Pacific: 55 million
- Mountain: 3 million

(2) Population disparity is an intentional feature of this Constitution, not a defect. Regions are defined by geographic, economic, and cultural coherence, not population equality.

(3) Small-population Regions are protected by:

- equal representation in the Senate,
- equalization transfers ensuring baseline fiscal capacity (Article X, Section 3),
- the boundary revision process, which allows but does not compel merger (Article I, Section 4),
- inter-Regional cooperation agreements permitting shared institutions (Article I, Section 5).

(4) Small Regions may petition for boundary revision to join an adjacent Region, but may not be compelled to merge.

(f) Minimum Regional Capacity.

(1) Each Region must maintain minimum institutional capacity to:

- administer elections,
- operate Regional courts,
- maintain Regional Guard Forces,
- participate in Senate representation.

(2) If a Region's population falls below one-half of one percent of the total population of the United States, or if a Region demonstrates inability to maintain minimum institutional capacity, the Independent Boundary Review Commission shall conduct a special review within one year and may recommend:

- merger with an adjacent Region,
- enhanced inter-Regional cooperation agreements,
- federal technical assistance.

(3) Any merger recommendation under this subsection requires the same approval process as other boundary revisions under Article I, Section 4.
