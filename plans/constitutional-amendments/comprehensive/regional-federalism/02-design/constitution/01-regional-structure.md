# Regional Structure

## Part I: Article I - Regions of the United States

*This document contains the core regional structure provisions of the Regional Federal Constitution.*

---

## Preamble

We, the People of the United States, in order to preserve the Union, restore democratic legitimacy, secure liberty against concentration of power, and ensure that self-government remains possible in a large and diverse republic, do hereby amend the Constitution to establish a system of **Regional Federalism**.

This amendment package is adopted to:

- align governance with modern economic and social reality,
- reduce existential political conflict,
- prevent authoritarian consolidation,
- preserve national unity without coercive uniformity,
- and ensure that no single institution may dominate the constitutional order.

---

## ARTICLE I - REGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES

### Section 1. Establishment of Regions

The United States shall be composed of multiple **Regions**, each consisting of a grouping of States, established by this Constitution and alterable only by constitutional amendment or the boundary revision process specified herein.

Regions are permanent constitutional entities and are not administrative subdivisions of the federal government.

---

### Section 2. Legal Status

Regions possess inherent governing authority within their enumerated powers, derived from the People of the Region and recognized by this Constitution.

No Region is sovereign. Sovereignty resides in the People of the United States.

---

### Section 3. Regional Constitutions

Each Region shall adopt a republican constitution consistent with:

- this Constitution,
- federal rights floors,
- democratic process guarantees.

Regional constitutions shall provide for:

- universal suffrage,
- independent redistricting processes,
- proportionality and competitiveness standards for elections,
- explicit protection against domination by any single metropolitan area or rural bloc.

The structural form of Regional government (unicameral or bicameral legislature, electoral system) shall be determined by each Region, subject to the foregoing requirements.

---

### Section 4. Regional Boundary Revision

(a) Regional boundaries may be revised without full constitutional amendment through a process requiring:

- an Independent Boundary Review Commission to assess and recommend changes,
- approval by two-thirds of the legislature of each affected Region,
- approval by national popular referendum.

(b) The Commission shall be structured to ensure independence from partisan control, with members drawn from multiple appointing authorities and subject to disqualification for recent partisan activity.

(c) Congress shall establish by statute the criteria for boundary revision, Commission procedures, and referendum processes.

(d) No boundary revision may be proposed, voted upon, or take effect within one year before or six months after a federal presidential election.

(e) Implementation procedures are established by statute. See the [Regional Boundary Review and Revision Act](../../proposals/boundary-review-act.md) for the proposed implementing legislation.

---

### Section 5. Inter-Regional Cooperation

(a) Two or more Regions may enter into agreements for cooperative action on any matter within their respective powers.

(b) Such agreements require no federal approval unless they:

- affect federal enumerated powers,
- create binding obligations on non-participating Regions,
- or conflict with federal law enacted pursuant to enumerated powers.

(c) Regions may establish joint institutions, shared programs, cooperative purchasing arrangements, and coordinated policy frameworks.

(d) Inter-Regional agreements shall specify:

- governance structure and decision-making procedures,
- cost-sharing and fiscal responsibilities,
- dispute resolution mechanisms,
- withdrawal procedures and transition provisions.

(e) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize Regions to jointly exercise powers reserved to the federal government or to create obligations binding on the United States.

---

### Section 6. Right of Transit and Non-Blockade

(a) No Region may deny, obstruct, or unreasonably condition access to transportation, energy, or communication infrastructure connecting other Regions. All Regions have rights of transit through other Regions on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.

(b) Infrastructure fees shall be non-discriminatory, cost-based, and transparent.

(c) This section does not require Regions to build new infrastructure, only to maintain reasonable access to existing infrastructure connecting other Regions.

(d) Implementation procedures are established by statute. See the [National Common Market Access Act](../../proposals/national-common-market-access-act.md) for the proposed implementing legislation.

---

### Section 7. Water Rights and Shared Waterways

(a) Interstate rivers, lakes, aquifers, and watersheds that cross or border Regional boundaries are shared resources. Water allocation among Regions shall be governed by principles of equitable apportionment.

(b) No Region may unilaterally divert, dam, or appropriate water in a manner that substantially diminishes the quantity or quality of water available to other Regions, or discharge pollutants that render water unusable by other Regions.

(c) Existing interstate water compacts shall remain in force unless superseded by Regional agreement or federal law.

(d) Nothing in this section shall diminish treaty obligations to Tribal Nations regarding water rights or authorize taking of water rights without just compensation.

(e) **Water Resources Coordination Board.** There is hereby established a Water Resources Coordination Board consisting of:

- one representative appointed by each Region,
- one representative of the Environmental Protection Agency,
- one representative of the Army Corps of Engineers,
- two representatives of Tribal Nations with water rights in affected watersheds (selected by a council of affected Tribes).

The Board shall coordinate water allocation, establish monitoring standards, and facilitate dispute resolution through mediation before adjudication.

(f) **National Water Court.** There is hereby established a National Water Court with exclusive original jurisdiction over interstate water disputes. The Court shall consist of five judges appointed by the President with Senate confirmation for twelve-year non-renewable terms, drawn from persons with expertise in water law, hydrology, or environmental science. At least two judges shall have experience representing Western states with prior appropriation systems, and at least two shall have experience representing Eastern states with riparian rights systems. The Court's decisions may be appealed to the Supreme Court on questions of constitutional interpretation.

(g) Implementation procedures are established by statute. See the [Interstate Water Resources Coordination Act](../../proposals/water-resources-coordination-act.md) for the proposed implementing legislation.

(b) State-Level Compacts. Compacts between States within the same Region become matters of Regional law. The Regional legislature may modify or terminate such compacts by statute.

(c) Cross-Regional Compacts. Compacts between States in different Regions continue as interstate compacts. Such compacts may be:

- assumed by the relevant Regions by mutual agreement,
- renegotiated as inter-Regional agreements under Section 5,

- modified by agreement of all participating jurisdictions,
- or reorganized pursuant to Regional law for agencies operating wholly within one Region.

### Schedule Notes

(a) The District of Columbia is not assigned to any Region upon ratification. Its Regional assignment shall be determined pursuant to Article XX, Section 1(b).

(b) United States territories are not assigned to any Region upon ratification. Their Regional assignment shall be determined pursuant to Article XX, Section 2(a).

(c) Tribal lands within State boundaries remain under tribal and federal jurisdiction as provided in Article XX, Section 3.

(d) These initial boundaries are based on geographic, economic, and demographic considerations as of ratification. Future boundary revisions shall follow the process established in Article I, Section 4.

(e) Population and Fiscal Capacity Considerations.

(1) Regions vary substantially in population. As of ratification, approximate populations are:

- Northeast: 60 million
- Southeast: 75 million
- Midwest: 52 million
- Great Plains: 14 million
- Southwest: 52 million
- Pacific: 55 million
- Mountain: 3 million

(2) Population disparity is an intentional feature of this Constitution, not a defect. Regions are defined by geographic, economic, and cultural coherence, not population equality.

(3) Small-population Regions are protected by:

- equal representation in the Senate,
- equalization transfers ensuring baseline fiscal capacity (Article X, Section 3),
- the boundary revision process, which allows but does not compel merger (Article I, Section 4),
- inter-Regional cooperation agreements permitting shared institutions (Article I, Section 5).

(4) Small Regions may petition for boundary revision to join an adjacent Region, but may not be compelled to merge.

(f) Minimum Regional Capacity.

(1) Each Region must maintain minimum institutional capacity to:

- administer elections,
- operate Regional courts,
- maintain Regional Guard Forces,
- participate in Senate representation.

(2) If a Region's population falls below one-half of one percent of the total population of the United States, or if a Region demonstrates inability to maintain minimum institutional capacity, the Independent Boundary Review Commission shall conduct a special review within one year and may recommend:

- merger with an adjacent Region,
- enhanced inter-Regional cooperation agreements,
- federal technical assistance.

(3) Any merger recommendation under this subsection requires the same approval process as other boundary revisions under Article I, Section 4.
