# Regional Structure

## Part I: Article I - Regions of the United States

*This document contains the core regional structure provisions of the Regional Federal Constitution.*

---

## Preamble

We, the People of the United States, in order to preserve the Union, restore democratic legitimacy, secure liberty against concentration of power, and ensure that self-government remains possible in a large and diverse republic, do hereby amend the Constitution to establish a system of **Regional Federalism**.

This amendment package is adopted to:

- align governance with modern economic and social reality,
- reduce existential political conflict,
- prevent authoritarian consolidation,
- preserve national unity without coercive uniformity,
- and ensure that no single institution may dominate the constitutional order.

---

## ARTICLE I - REGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES

### Section 1. Establishment of Regions

The United States shall be composed of multiple **Regions**, each consisting of a grouping of States, established by this Constitution and alterable only by constitutional amendment or the boundary revision process specified herein.

Regions are permanent constitutional entities and are not administrative subdivisions of the federal government.

---

### Section 2. Legal Status

Regions possess inherent governing authority within their enumerated powers, derived from the People of the Region and recognized by this Constitution.

No Region is sovereign. Sovereignty resides in the People of the United States.

---

### Section 3. Regional Constitutions

Each Region shall adopt a republican constitution consistent with:

- this Constitution,
- federal rights floors,
- democratic process guarantees.

Regional constitutions shall provide for:

- universal suffrage,
- independent redistricting processes,
- proportionality and competitiveness standards for elections,
- explicit protection against domination by any single metropolitan area or rural bloc.

The structural form of Regional government (unicameral or bicameral legislature, electoral system) shall be determined by each Region, subject to the foregoing requirements.

### Section 3-A. Regional Electoral Standards Enforcement

(a) **Proportionality Standard.** Regional constitutions shall adopt electoral systems for Regional legislative elections that produce seat distributions reasonably reflecting vote distributions. A system satisfies this requirement if, over two consecutive election cycles, the average disparity between any party's regionwide vote share and its seat share does not exceed five (5) percentage points, as measured by the Gallagher Index of Disproportionality or a successor metric designated by the National Election Court, absent a demonstrated compelling structural justification — arising from geographic, demographic, or party-system constraints rather than electoral system design choices — documented in the Compliance Review.

(b) **Competitiveness Standard.** Regional constitutions shall ensure that electoral systems produce meaningful voter choice. A system satisfies this requirement if at least thirty percent (30%) of legislative seats are contested with winning margins of fifteen (15) percentage points or less, as measured by post-election margin analysis. Where historical election data is unavailable due to newly created districts or first implementation of a new electoral system, pre-election margin projections by the National Election Court may be used as interim evidence for the first two election cycles, after which post-election data shall govern.

(c) **Anti-Domination Standard.** Regional constitutions shall include structural protections against legislative domination by any single metropolitan area or rural bloc. A system satisfies this requirement if:

(1) no single metropolitan statistical area controls a majority of legislative seats unless it contains a majority of the Region's population AND the electoral system satisfies subsection (a);

(2) legislative representation is geographically distributed such that no contiguous geographic area containing less than forty percent (40%) of the Region's population holds more than fifty percent (50%) of legislative seats;

(3) the Regional constitution includes at least one structural mechanism (such as a geographic chamber, weighted committee representation, or supermajority requirements for geographically concentrated impact) to ensure non-dominant areas have meaningful input on legislation disproportionately affecting them.

(d) **Compliance Review.** The National Election Court (or, if not yet established, the Allocation Review Board) shall conduct Regional Electoral Compliance Reviews:

(1) following each decennial census;

(2) upon petition by twenty percent (20%) of a Region's legislative members;

(3) upon petition by citizens representing at least two percent (2%) of the Region's registered voters.

(e) **Review Process.** Compliance Reviews shall:

(1) evaluate Regional electoral systems against the standards in subsections (a) through (c) using publicly available election data;

(2) issue findings within one hundred eighty (180) days of initiation;

(3) provide a two-year remediation period for Regions found non-compliant;

(4) publish all findings, data, and methodology for public review.

(f) **Automatic Remedies.** If a Region fails to achieve compliance within the remediation period:

(1) the National Election Court shall prescribe minimum electoral system reforms necessary for compliance;

(2) the Region may adopt the prescribed reforms or propose alternatives that demonstrably meet the standards;

(3) if the Region takes no action within one additional year, the prescribed reforms take effect by operation of law for the next election cycle;

(4) affected elections conducted under non-compliant systems remain valid, but the results may be considered by courts in evaluating remedies.

(g) **Metric Updating.** The specific metric thresholds in subsections (a) and (b) may be adjusted by two-thirds vote of Congress upon recommendation of the National Election Court, provided that:

(1) adjusted thresholds may not be less protective of proportionality or competitiveness than those specified herein;

(2) the National Election Court publishes a public justification for the adjustment;

(3) adjustments take effect no earlier than the second election cycle following adoption.

(h) **Relationship to Redistricting.** This section governs the overall electoral system design and outcome standards. Independent redistricting commissions required by Article VII, Section 10 address the specific mechanism of district boundary drawing. Both provisions apply simultaneously; compliance with redistricting requirements does not satisfy this section if the electoral system as a whole fails to meet the standards in subsections (a) through (c).

---

### Section 4. Regional Boundary Revision

(a) Regional boundaries may be revised without full constitutional amendment through a process requiring:

- an Independent Boundary Review Commission to assess and recommend changes,
- approval by two-thirds of the legislature of each affected Region,
- approval by national popular referendum.

(b) The Commission shall be structured to ensure independence from partisan control, with members drawn from multiple appointing authorities and subject to disqualification for recent partisan activity.

(c) Congress shall establish by statute the criteria for boundary revision, Commission procedures, and referendum processes.

(d) No boundary revision may be proposed, voted upon, or take effect within one year before or six months after a federal presidential election.

(e) Implementation procedures are established by statute. See the [Regional Boundary Review and Revision Act](../../proposals/01-foundations/boundary-review-act.md) for the proposed implementing legislation.

#### State Transfer Mechanism

(f) **Tiered Transfer Approval.** A State may transfer from one Region to another pursuant to the following procedures:

| Transfer Type | Threshold | Requirements |
|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Bilateral Agreement** | Supermajority (2/3) of both Regional legislatures + State referendum (55%) | Consent from all affected parties |
| **Unilateral Departure** | State referendum (60%) + ARB certification + 3-year waiting period | Higher bar for non-consensual departure |
| **Contested Transfer** | Supreme Court determination | Prevents hostage-taking by blocking Region |

(g) **Fundamental Misalignment Standard.** The ARB shall certify "Fundamental Misalignment" based on objective criteria. Certification is **automatic** if the State demonstrates any two of the following for two consecutive years:

(1) The State's primary economic trading partners are greater than sixty percent (60%) outside its current Region, as measured by interstate commerce data published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis; OR

(2) The State's labor market integration (cross-border commuting, migration) is greater than fifty percent (50%) with an adjacent Region, as measured by Census Bureau commuting data; OR

(3) The State's median voter policy preferences diverge from the Regional median by more than 1.5 standard deviations on three or more major policy domains, as measured by the biennial National Policy Preference Survey. The Survey shall be:

(A) administered by the Federal Data Coordination Agency or successor independent statistical agency — not by any agency with electoral, prosecutorial, or enforcement responsibilities;

(B) designed and validated pursuant to methodology standards established by Congress, including minimum sample sizes, confidence intervals, pre-registered question frameworks, and defined policy domains; question wording shall remain constant across administrations absent two-thirds approval of the methodology standards body;

(C) subject to independent statistical audit by a panel of three non-governmental experts selected by the Judicial Conference from among members of accredited professional statistical associations;

(D) published in full (anonymized individual responses, methodology documentation, weighting procedures, and audit findings) no later than ninety (90) days after administration;

(E) cross-validated against at least two independent, nationally representative, methodologically transparent surveys not funded or controlled by any governmental entity; divergence scores that differ by more than 0.5 standard deviations from cross-validation sources shall trigger mandatory methodological review before certification.

OR

(4) The State shares a contiguous border with the destination Region and does not share a contiguous border with any other State in its current Region.

(g-1) **Major Policy Domains Defined.** For purposes of subsection (g)(3), "major policy domains" shall include, at minimum:

(1) fiscal policy (taxation and spending priorities);

(2) environmental and energy regulation;

(3) healthcare and social welfare;

(4) criminal justice and public safety;

(5) education and workforce policy;

(6) immigration and border policy;

(7) economic regulation and labor standards.

Congress may add domains by statute but may not remove enumerated domains. The Survey shall measure preferences on all enumerated domains in every administration.

(g-2) **Survey Validity Challenge.** Any State or Region may challenge the validity of Survey results before the ARB within sixty (60) days of publication. The ARB shall:

(1) convene the independent audit panel referenced in subsection (g)(3)(C) for expedited review;

(2) issue findings within ninety (90) days of challenge;

(3) invalidate Survey results and require re-administration if the panel finds material methodological deficiencies, sampling bias, or evidence of political interference;

(4) toll the two-year persistence period (subsection (g)) during pendency of a validity challenge.

No Fundamental Misalignment certification based on subsection (g)(3) shall issue while a Survey validity challenge is pending.

(h) **Waiting Period.** A State initiating Unilateral Departure shall complete a three (3) year waiting period during which:

(1) The State remains subject to all origin-Region obligations;

(2) The ARB shall verify continued Fundamental Misalignment at Year 2;

(3) The State may withdraw its transfer application at any time;

(4) Business investment decisions made during the waiting period shall not be subject to retroactive regulatory changes by either Region.

(i) **Policy Continuity Rule.** A transferring State shall remain subject to its former Region's regulatory and tax floors for a period of three (3) years following transfer, with floors declining by one-third (33%) annually toward the new Region's standards. During this period:

(1) Businesses may elect to be governed by either the origin Region's or destination Region's standards, provided they declare their election at the beginning of each fiscal year;

(2) This election does not affect individual rights protections, which remain subject to the higher floor;

(3) The destination Region may not impose requirements exceeding those of the origin Region during the transition period.

#### Anti-Region-Shopping Provisions

(j) **Anti-Arbitrage Certification.** No transfer shall be approved if the ARB determines, based on objective evidence, that arbitrage is the dominant purpose. Arbitrage shall be presumed if:

(1) The destination Region's effective corporate tax rate is more than five (5) percentage points lower than the origin Region's, AND the State cannot demonstrate Fundamental Misalignment under subsection (g); OR

(2) The destination Region's environmental compliance costs are more than thirty percent (30%) lower than the origin Region's, AND the State cannot demonstrate Fundamental Misalignment under subsection (g); OR

(3) The State government or its officials have publicly stated regulatory or tax avoidance as a primary motivation.

(k) **Burden of Proof.**

(1) Where the destination Region maintains lower floors in any domain enumerated in subsection (j), the transferring State bears the burden of demonstrating non-arbitrage purpose by a preponderance of evidence (not clear and convincing evidence).

(2) If the State establishes Fundamental Misalignment under subsection (g), the burden shifts to any objecting party to prove arbitrage as the dominant purpose by clear and convincing evidence.

(l) **Expedited ARB Review.** The ARB shall resolve transfer disputes within ninety (90) days of filing, not the general 180-day timeline. The ARB shall issue preliminary certification or denial within forty-five (45) days, with the remaining period for any appeals or supplemental submissions.

(m) **Regional Membership Permanence.** Once assigned, Regional membership is irrevocable until the next decennial review; selective coordination withdrawal does not exempt a State from Regional authority.

#### Regional Infrastructure Supremacy for Trans-State Projects

(n) **Superior Use Certification.** When a Regional Government determines that inter-state infrastructure (including but not limited to transportation corridors, energy transmission lines, pipelines, and communications networks) requires passage through State territory, the Regional Government may petition the ARB for "Superior Use Certification."

(o) **Certification Standard.** The ARB shall grant Superior Use Certification upon finding that:

- (1) the project serves a legitimate inter-state infrastructure purpose within Regional Domain authority;
- (2) the Regional Government has made good-faith efforts to negotiate voluntary easements with affected States;
- (3) the proposed route minimizes disruption to existing State land uses where feasible;
- (4) the Regional Government commits to fair market compensation for affected landowners.

(p) **Effect of Certification.** Upon Superior Use Certification:

- (1) State and local zoning, permitting, and land-use regulations may not be applied to block, delay, or impose conditions inconsistent with the certified project;
- (2) the Regional Government may exercise eminent domain authority for the certified corridor, subject to just compensation under the Fifth Amendment;
- (3) States retain authority over ancillary matters (environmental mitigation, construction timing, aesthetic requirements) that do not materially impede project completion.

(q) **Expedited Review.** ARB shall render Superior Use Certification decisions within ninety (90) days. Failure to render a decision shall constitute denial, appealable to the Supreme Court.

(r) **Anti-Abuse Limitation.** Superior Use Certification may not be used for projects whose primary purpose is intra-state, nor to circumvent legitimate State environmental protections unrelated to the inter-state function.

---

### Section 5. Inter-Regional Cooperation

(a) Two or more Regions may enter into agreements for cooperative action on any matter within their respective powers.

(b) Such agreements require no federal approval unless they:

- affect federal enumerated powers,
- create binding obligations on non-participating Regions,
- or conflict with federal law enacted pursuant to enumerated powers.

(c) Regions may establish joint institutions, shared programs, cooperative purchasing arrangements, and coordinated policy frameworks.

(d) Inter-Regional agreements shall specify:

- governance structure and decision-making procedures,
- cost-sharing and fiscal responsibilities,
- dispute resolution mechanisms,
- withdrawal procedures and transition provisions.

(e) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize Regions to jointly exercise powers reserved to the federal government or to create obligations binding on the United States.

#### Prohibition on Foreign Regulatory Integration

(f) **Federal Exclusivity over Foreign Relations.** The federal government's exclusive authority over "foreign affairs and treaties" under Article II, Section 1 includes exclusive authority over regulatory alignments, standards harmonization, and economic integration agreements with foreign sovereign entities.

(g) **Prohibited Regional Actions.** No Region or State may, without federal approval:

- (1) enter into "technical cooperation agreements," "regulatory memoranda," "standards harmonization agreements," or similar arrangements with foreign governments, foreign governmental agencies, or foreign-controlled entities;
- (2) adopt regulations specifically designed to align with foreign standards in a manner that creates incompatibility with other Regions or with federal policy;
- (3) participate in foreign-led regulatory bodies, standard-setting organizations, or trade blocs in an official governmental capacity;
- (4) commit to exclusive infrastructure interconnections with foreign systems (energy grids, transportation networks, communications systems, port facilities, water treatment or distribution systems) that would preclude domestic integration, or grant foreign state-owned or state-influenced entities ownership, lease, or operational control of such infrastructure.

(h) **Functional Test for Foreign Integration.** A Regional regulatory action shall be deemed prohibited foreign integration if:

- (1) it creates regulatory compatibility with a foreign jurisdiction while creating incompatibility with other U.S. Regions;
- (2) it was adopted following consultation with foreign governmental entities without corresponding federal consultation;
- (3) it references or incorporates foreign standards that differ materially from federal or inter-Regional standards;
- (4) its practical effect is to orient the Region's economy toward foreign markets at the expense of domestic economic integration.

(i) **Permitted Activities.** This section does not prohibit:

- (1) private commercial transactions with foreign entities;
- (2) educational, cultural, or scientific exchanges;
- (3) adoption of international standards that are also adopted federally or by a majority of Regions;
- (4) border-region cooperation on matters of purely local concern (e.g., cross-border emergency services, local environmental issues) with adjacent foreign jurisdictions, provided such cooperation does not affect national policy;
- (5) participation in non-governmental international organizations.

(j) **Federal Approval Process.** A Region seeking to engage in activities that might otherwise be prohibited may petition the State Department for approval:

- (1) The State Department shall review the proposed activity for consistency with national foreign policy;
- (2) Approval may be granted with conditions ensuring national policy coherence;
- (3) Denial must be accompanied by written explanation and is subject to judicial review for abuse of discretion;
- (4) The State Department shall respond within ninety (90) days; failure to respond constitutes denial.

(k) **Enforcement.** Violations of this section shall result in:

- (1) federal preemption of the offending Regional regulation;
- (2) injunctive relief in federal court;
- (3) withholding of federal funds related to the subject matter of the violation;
- (4) personal liability for Regional officials who knowingly entered prohibited arrangements.

(l) **Geopolitical Fragmentation Finding.** If the State Department determines that a Region's cumulative regulatory actions constitute "Geopolitical Fragmentation"—defined as economic or regulatory integration with foreign powers that materially impairs national foreign policy coordination—the President may:

- (1) declare the finding and transmit it to Congress;
- (2) suspend the Region's authority to regulate in the affected domain pending Congressional action;
- (3) Congress shall hold hearings within sixty (60) days and may ratify, modify, or reject the suspension.

---

### Section 6. Right of Transit and Non-Blockade

(a) No Region may deny, obstruct, or unreasonably condition access to transportation, energy, or communication infrastructure connecting other Regions. All Regions have rights of transit through other Regions on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.

(b) Infrastructure fees shall be non-discriminatory, cost-based, and transparent.

(c) This section does not require Regions to build new infrastructure, only to maintain reasonable access to existing infrastructure connecting other Regions.

#### Infrastructure Closure Review

(d) **Emergency Shutdown Expedited Review.** When any Region declares an emergency shutdown, initiates unscheduled maintenance, or imposes capacity restrictions on inter-Regional infrastructure:

(1) The declaration shall automatically trigger an expedited review by the Allocation Review Board within seventy-two hours;

(2) The declaring Region bears the burden of demonstrating genuine safety necessity by clear and convincing evidence;

(3) Failure to demonstrate necessity results in mandatory reopening within forty-eight hours.

(e) **Genuine Safety Necessity Standard.** To satisfy the "genuine safety necessity" requirement:

(1) The Region must identify a specific, documented hazard;

(2) The closure must be proportionate to the hazard (full closure only if partial measures insufficient);

(3) The estimated repair timeline must be technically justified;

(4) Economic impact on affected Regions must be considered as a factor, though not dispositive.

(f) **Prolonged Closure Presumption.** Any infrastructure closure or restriction exceeding seven days creates a rebuttable presumption of unreasonableness:

(1) The Region must file detailed justification with the ARB every seven days;

(2) Each seven-day extension requires renewed demonstration of necessity;

(3) Failure to file creates automatic referral for federal operational assumption.

(g) **Cumulative Obstruction Assessment.** The ARB shall assess patterns of infrastructure restriction:

(1) Three or more closures affecting the same corridor within twelve months triggers cumulative review;

(2) "Rolling maintenance" schedules that cumulatively exceed thirty days annually create presumption of strategic obstruction;

(3) Pattern finding shifts burden to Region for all future closures.

(h) **Alternative Route Requirements.** During any closure or restriction:

(1) The Region shall provide functional alternative routing at equivalent or lower cost;

(2) Increased costs for alternative routing borne by the closing Region;

(3) Failure to provide alternatives constitutes per se violation.

(i) **Processing Time Standards.** For infrastructure subject to inspection, certification, or processing requirements:

(1) Processing times shall not exceed national median for comparable facilities;

(2) Deviation exceeding fifty percent from median creates presumption of obstruction;

(3) ARB may mandate processing timeline improvements.

(j) **Rate Regulation for Constrained Corridors.** Rates for transit through partially closed or capacity-restricted infrastructure:

(1) Shall not exceed rates in effect prior to the restriction;

(2) No "scarcity premium" or "congestion pricing" permitted during capacity emergencies;

(3) Any rate increase during restriction period is void.

(k) **Cost-Based Rate Requirement.** Infrastructure user fees shall be based solely on:

(1) Documented maintenance and operational costs;

(2) Capital recovery for improvements directly benefiting users;

(3) Reasonable administrative overhead not exceeding fifteen percent of direct costs.

(l) **Rate Dispute Freeze.** When a fee is challenged:

(1) The pre-dispute rate remains in effect until ARB resolution;

(2) No retroactive collection permitted for disputed amounts;

(3) Resolution within sixty days required.

#### Remedies and Enforcement

(m) **Full Damages for Unreasonable Restrictions.** When the ARB finds an infrastructure restriction was not supported by genuine safety necessity:

(1) Affected Regions and private parties may recover full economic damages;

(2) Damages include direct losses, consequential damages, and litigation costs;

(3) No sovereign immunity defense available for infrastructure violations.

(n) **Treble Damages for Bad Faith.** When the ARB finds a restriction was imposed in bad faith—for purposes of economic coercion rather than safety:

(1) Treble damages are mandatory;

(2) Regional officials responsible for the decision are personally liable;

(3) Pattern bad faith triggers federal operational assumption.

(o) **Federal Operational Assumption.** When a Region refuses to comply with ARB order to reopen or de-restrict infrastructure:

(1) Federal agencies may assume operational control;

(2) Federal operation continues until the Region demonstrates compliance;

(3) Costs of federal operation are charged to the non-compliant Region.

(p) **Repeat Offender Designation.** Regions found to have engaged in unreasonable infrastructure conditioning three or more times within ten years:

(1) Lose unilateral authority over inter-Regional infrastructure;

(2) All future maintenance, closures, and rate changes require ARB pre-approval;

(3) Designation continues for ten years or until the Region demonstrates reformed practices.

#### National Infrastructure Transparency System

(q) **National Infrastructure Transparency System Established.** The Department of Transportation, in coordination with the Department of Energy, the Independent Fiscal Council, and the Allocation Review Board, shall maintain a publicly accessible National Infrastructure Transparency System (NITS) containing:

(1) Real-time operational status of all inter-Regional transit corridors, energy transmission lines, and pipeline infrastructure;

(2) All emergency declarations, maintenance schedules, and capacity restrictions affecting inter-Regional infrastructure;

(3) Complete technical justifications for any closure, restriction, or capacity reduction;

(4) Historical data on infrastructure availability, maintenance frequency, and processing times by corridor and Region;

(5) All inter-Regional transit fee schedules with cost justification summaries;

(6) Fee challenge status, pending disputes, and resolution outcomes.

(r) **Mandatory Real-Time Disclosure.** When a Region declares an emergency shutdown, initiates maintenance, imposes capacity restrictions, or changes fee schedules:

(1) The Region shall upload complete technical or cost justification to NITS within four hours for emergencies, thirty days for fee changes;

(2) Justification must include specific hazard identification, engineering assessments, estimated duration, or audited cost documentation;

(3) Supporting data (inspection reports, sensor readings, engineering analyses, financial records) must be made publicly available;

(4) Updates shall be filed every twenty-four hours during ongoing closures.

(s) **No Classified Infrastructure Justifications.** Regions may not invoke national security, proprietary information, or any confidentiality doctrine to withhold infrastructure closure or fee justifications:

(1) All safety, maintenance, and cost justifications are inherently public information;

(2) If a closure involves genuinely classified federal security matters, only the federal government (not the Region) may invoke classification, and must assume operational responsibility for the closure;

(3) Regional invocation of "classified" or "proprietary" justification creates irrebuttable presumption of bad faith and triggers immediate federal review.

(t) **Public Accountability Metrics.** NITS shall publish monthly:

(1) "Infrastructure Reliability Scores" for each Region based on closure frequency, duration, and justification adequacy;

(2) "Fee Reasonableness Scores" for each Region comparing fees to cost-plus standards;

(3) Comparison of stated maintenance needs to industry benchmarks;

(4) Economic impact estimates of closures and fees on affected Regions;

(5) Identification of patterns suggesting strategic rather than safety-motivated closures;

(6) Historical fee trends and comparisons across Regions.

(u) **Cost-Plus Fee Ceiling.** Inter-Regional transit fees shall not exceed one hundred ten percent of documented costs:

(1) "Documented costs" means actual operating costs plus capital recovery plus reasonable administrative overhead;

(2) The IFC shall establish uniform accounting standards for cost calculation;

(3) Costs shall be audited annually and published in NITS.

(v) **Aggregate Fee Limitation.** The aggregate of all fees, charges, and assessments imposed on inter-Regional transit shall not exceed the one hundred ten percent cost-plus ceiling:

(1) Regions may not circumvent the ceiling through multiple fee categories;

(2) "Environmental," "climate adaptation," "safety," and "modernization" charges count toward the aggregate;

(3) The IFC shall monitor for fee multiplication strategies.

(w) **Summary Suspension Authority.** The ARB may summarily suspend fee collection when:

(1) Prima facie evidence suggests the fee exceeds the one hundred ten percent ceiling;

(2) Suspension remains in effect pending full review;

(3) The charging Region bears the burden of proving cost compliance;

(4) Failure to provide audited cost documentation creates rebuttable presumption of violation;

(5) The ARB may access Regional financial records for verification.

#### Anti-Retaliation

(x) **Non-Retaliation.** Regions may not:

(1) Increase fees in response to fee challenges by specific users;

(2) Impose selective enforcement of ancillary requirements against challengers;

(3) Delay processing of challengers' transit relative to non-challengers;

(4) Impose new requirements targeting entities that filed ARB complaints.

(y) **Challenger Protection.** Entities filing infrastructure or fee challenges:

(1) Shall have access to expedited ARB review;

(2) May recover attorney fees and costs if challenge is successful;

(3) Are protected from any adverse action by the challenged Region.

(z) **Whistleblower Provisions.** Regional employees who report infrastructure abuse:

(1) Are protected from termination, demotion, or adverse action;

(2) May file directly with ARB under seal;

(3) May receive a portion of any damages recovered.

#### Minimum Maintenance Standards for Inter-Regional Infrastructure

(aa) **Maintenance Obligation.** Every Region and State maintaining infrastructure that serves inter-Regional commerce or movement shall:

- (1) maintain such infrastructure in a condition that permits safe and efficient operation at designed capacity;
- (2) conduct regular inspections and preventive maintenance according to industry standards;
- (3) promptly repair deficiencies that impair safety or capacity;
- (4) maintain adequate funding reserves for foreseeable maintenance needs.

(bb) **Critical Inter-Regional Corridors.** The ARB, in consultation with the Department of Transportation and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, shall designate "Critical Inter-Regional Corridors" including:

- (1) interstate highways and bridges carrying more than 10,000 vehicles per day in inter-Regional traffic;
- (2) rail lines carrying more than 5 million tons of inter-Regional freight annually;
- (3) pipelines carrying petroleum, natural gas, or other essential commodities across Regional boundaries;
- (4) electrical transmission lines of 230 kV or greater serving inter-Regional load;
- (5) fiber-optic trunk lines and data centers serving inter-Regional communications.

(cc) **Maintenance Reporting.** Jurisdictions maintaining Critical Inter-Regional Corridors shall:

- (1) submit annual maintenance reports to the ARB detailing inspection results, repair activities, and funding allocations;
- (2) immediately report any condition that reduces capacity below 80% of design specification;
- (3) provide five-year maintenance plans demonstrating adequate funding for continued operation.

(dd) **Manufactured Safety Necessity Doctrine.** A jurisdiction may not invoke "Genuine Safety Necessity" under subsection (e) to close or restrict infrastructure if:

- (1) the safety condition resulted from the jurisdiction's failure to perform maintenance required by this section;
- (2) the jurisdiction failed to seek available federal or inter-Regional funding for maintenance;
- (3) the jurisdiction diverted maintenance funds to other purposes within the preceding five years;
- (4) a pattern of under-maintenance suggests strategic intent to create closure justifications.

(ee) **Burden of Proof for Decay-Based Closures.** When a jurisdiction invokes safety necessity for infrastructure that has received below-average maintenance funding relative to comparable facilities:

- (1) the burden shifts to the closing jurisdiction to prove the safety condition was not the result of deliberate or negligent under-maintenance;
- (2) the ARB may appoint an independent engineering assessment at the closing jurisdiction's expense;
- (3) findings of manufactured necessity shall trigger the treble damages and bad-faith penalties applicable to pretextual closures.

(ff) **Federal Maintenance Backstop.** If a jurisdiction fails to maintain Critical Inter-Regional Corridor infrastructure:

- (1) the ARB may order the jurisdiction to cure the maintenance deficiency within 180 days;
- (2) if not cured, the federal government may perform necessary maintenance and recover costs from the jurisdiction's federal transfer allocations;
- (3) persistent maintenance failures (three or more ARB orders within five years) shall result in mandatory federal assumption of maintenance responsibility, funded by withholding from the jurisdiction's highway and infrastructure allocations.

(gg) **Private Right of Action for Manufactured Decay.** Any person or entity suffering economic harm from infrastructure closure or restriction resulting from manufactured safety necessity may recover:

- (1) actual damages including business interruption, increased transportation costs, and consequential losses;
- (2) treble damages upon proof of deliberate under-maintenance;
- (3) attorney's fees and costs.

#### Proxy Blockade Prevention

(ii) **Regional Attribution for Private Actor Restrictions.** Regions are responsible for the actions of private entities that have the effect of restricting inter-Regional transit or commerce:

(1) Any entity that receives material financial support from a Region, operates under a contract or delegation of governmental functions from a Region, or holds special regulatory privileges beyond standard licensing granted by a Region, and whose conduct has the effect of restricting inter-Regional transit, shall be deemed to act on behalf of the Region for purposes of this Section;

(2) "Effect of restricting" means any pattern of conduct that: (A) delays inter-Regional transit by an average of more than two hours per affected shipment over any thirty-day period; or (B) reduces inter-Regional commerce volume through an affected corridor by more than five percent relative to the same period in the prior year, after accounting for seasonal and economic variation; cumulative delays imposed at multiple checkpoints, inspection stations, or processing facilities along a single corridor shall be aggregated for purposes of this threshold;

(3) Attribution under this subsection creates strict liability for the Region; the Region bears the burden of proving by clear and convincing evidence that the restriction resulted from factors genuinely beyond its influence or control;

(4) The ARB shall publish attribution findings in the National Infrastructure Transparency System established under subsection (q);

(5) The ARB, in coordination with the National Infrastructure Transparency System, shall establish and publish standardized methodology for measuring transit delays and commerce volume changes, including baseline calculations for new, expanding, and seasonal corridors, and shall update such methodology at least every five years.

(jj) **Proxy Entity Designation.** The Allocation Review Board may designate any private entity as a "Regional Proxy" and attribute its conduct to the Region:

(1) Designation requires a finding that: (A) the entity receives material financial support, contracted operations, delegated governmental functions, or special regulatory privileges from the Region; (B) the entity's actions have the effect of restricting inter-Regional commerce as defined in subsection (ii)(2); and (C) the Region has failed to take reasonable steps to prevent such restriction; (D) alternatively, the ARB may designate an entity as a Regional Proxy upon finding constructive coordination: evidence that the entity's restrictive conduct was undertaken in concert with, at the direction or encouragement of, or for the direct benefit of Regional officials or agencies, regardless of formal funding, contractual, or licensing ties;

(2) Upon designation, the entity's actions within the specific corridor(s), infrastructure type(s), or activity class(es) identified in the designation order are attributed to the Region for purposes of enforcement under this Section, including the remedies and penalties of subsections (m) through (p); the ARB shall define the scope of attribution in each designation order;

(3) Within thirty days of designation, the Region must either terminate the relationship giving rise to attribution or ensure the entity ceases all restrictive conduct within the scope of the designation; failure to comply within thirty days triggers automatic referral for initiation of federal enforcement proceedings under subsection (o), which shall proceed according to the certification and procedural requirements of that subsection;

(4) A Region that receives three or more proxy designations within ten years is subject to repeat offender designation under subsection (p);

(5) The ARB shall maintain a public registry of all proxy designations, including the basis for designation, the scope of attribution, the Region's response, and current status, published through the National Infrastructure Transparency System;

(6) When a designated Regional Proxy is also a foreign entity as defined in subsection (ll)(2), the thirty-day cure period under paragraph (3) does not apply: (A) if the foreign proxy entity controls or operates Critical Inter-Regional Corridor infrastructure as designated under subsection (bb), the ARB may immediately invoke the emergency federal operation authority under subsection (oo) and, upon certification that non-compliance is persistent, the divestment remedy under subsection (oo)(3); (B) if the foreign proxy entity does not control or operate Critical Inter-Regional Corridor infrastructure, the Department of Justice may seek immediate injunctive relief under subsection (kk) without the pattern-of-conduct requirement of subsection (kk)(1), and civil penalties under subsection (kk)(2) shall be doubled.

(kk) **Federal Injunction Authority Against Private Blockade.** The Department of Justice may seek injunctive relief against any private entity whose conduct has the effect of blockading inter-Regional commerce:

(1) Injunctions may issue upon a showing that the entity has engaged in a pattern of restrictive conduct as defined in subsection (ii)(2), regardless of whether Regional attribution has been established;

(2) Private actors who knowingly participate in coordinated schemes to restrict inter-Regional commerce are subject to federal civil penalties not to exceed the greater of ten million dollars or three times the documented economic damages caused by the restrictive conduct, per violation;

(3) Any person or entity suffering economic harm from a private blockade may bring a private action for treble damages against both the proxy entity and any coordinating Region, consistent with the damages framework of subsections (m) and (n);

(4) No immunity, whether sovereign, charitable, or otherwise, may shield a private entity from liability under this subsection when its conduct has the effect of restricting inter-Regional commerce.

#### Critical Infrastructure Ownership Protection

(ll) **Critical Infrastructure Divestment Approval.** No Region or constituent State may transfer ownership or operational control of infrastructure designated as "Critical Inter-Regional Corridor" under subsection (bb), or infrastructure otherwise designated "Shared Benefit Infrastructure" under federal statute, to any foreign entity:

(1) Unless the transfer receives the advice and consent of the Federal Senate by a majority vote within ninety days of submission; if the Senate fails to act within ninety days, the transfer is deemed denied;

(2) "Foreign entity" means any corporation, partnership, trust, fund, or government in which foreign persons, foreign governments, or entities controlled by foreign governments hold, directly or indirectly: (A) more than twenty-five percent of ownership interest, voting rights, or operational control; or (B) more than ten percent of ownership interest, voting rights, or operational control, if the foreign interest is held by or on behalf of a foreign government, state-owned enterprise, or entity in which a foreign government holds a controlling interest;

(3) Senate review shall consider: (A) the impact on national security and defense logistics; (B) the impact on inter-Regional infrastructure interoperability and the enforceability of mandates under this Section; (C) whether the acquiring entity is subject to the jurisdiction or direction of a foreign government; and (D) the adequacy of domestic regulatory and enforcement mechanisms over the proposed foreign owner;

(4) Transfers completed without Senate consent are void ab initio, and federal courts shall order disgorgement and restoration of prior ownership;

(5) Any agreement or contract purporting to transfer Critical Inter-Regional Corridor infrastructure to a foreign entity, whether styled as a sale, lease, concession, management agreement, or otherwise, is subject to this subsection if the practical effect is transfer of operational control;

(6) Ownership interests in Critical Inter-Regional Corridor infrastructure held by foreign entities at the time of ratification of this Section are subject to retroactive review: (A) the ARB shall identify and submit to the Senate a comprehensive inventory of all such interests within three years of ratification; (B) upon inclusion in the ARB inventory, each foreign entity shall receive formal notice and a ninety-day period to submit written materials to the Senate committee of jurisdiction, including evidence bearing on the criteria of paragraph (3); the Senate committee shall provide an opportunity for oral testimony upon request by the foreign entity; (C) the Senate shall review each identified interest under the criteria of paragraph (3) and vote to affirm or deny within one year of submission; (D) any interest not affirmatively approved by the Senate within the one-year review period is subject to mandatory divestment under subsection (oo)(3) and (4); (E) foreign entities subject to retroactive review shall cooperate with the ARB inventory process; failure to cooperate creates a rebuttable presumption that the interest was acquired for the purpose of shielding infrastructure from domestic constitutional enforcement.

(mm) **Domestic Constitutional Supremacy Over Treaty Claims.** Constitutional requirements for inter-Regional infrastructure established under this Section are not subject to international override:

(1) No treaty, bilateral investment agreement, international arbitration ruling, or investor-state dispute settlement mechanism may supersede, limit, or modify the requirements of this Section as applied to infrastructure within the territory of the United States;

(2) Foreign owners of Critical Inter-Regional Corridor infrastructure consent, as a condition of ownership, to the exclusive jurisdiction of domestic courts for all disputes arising under this Constitution, and waive any right to invoke international arbitration for claims that federal infrastructure mandates constitute expropriation or unfair treatment;

(3) Claims that federal safety, interoperability, or maintenance mandates under this Section constitute "expropriation," "indirect expropriation," or "measures tantamount to expropriation" under international law are not cognizable in any domestic or international forum, provided the mandate applies equally to domestic and foreign owners;

(4) The United States shall not enter into any treaty or agreement that would permit international arbitration of disputes arising from the enforcement of this Section against infrastructure owners within the United States;

(5) Nothing in this subsection or subsection (oo) eliminates the obligation of just compensation for the permanent physical taking of infrastructure assets. Emergency federal operation under subsection (oo) is a regulatory enforcement action, not a taking, and does not require compensation beyond the operational cost reimbursement specified in subsection (oo)(2)(B). Mandatory divestment under subsection (oo)(3) is compensated at fair market value as specified in subsection (oo)(4). Owners subject to emergency operation or mandatory divestment retain the right to a hearing before the ARB and judicial review in domestic courts, but may not invoke international arbitration.

(nn) **Beneficial Ownership Disclosure for Critical Infrastructure.** All persons and entities holding ownership interests in Critical Inter-Regional Corridor infrastructure shall disclose beneficial ownership:

(1) Complete beneficial ownership information, traced to natural persons or ultimate controlling entities, shall be filed with the Department of Commerce annually and updated within thirty days of any material change;

(2) Shell corporations, trusts, nominees, and layered ownership structures must be traced through all intermediate entities to the natural person or government exercising ultimate control;

(3) Failure to file or update beneficial ownership information creates a rebuttable presumption that the entity is a "foreign entity" as defined in subsection (ll)(2), triggering the divestment approval requirement;

(4) Knowingly filing false or materially incomplete beneficial ownership information is a federal felony, and upon conviction, the court shall order mandatory divestment of the infrastructure interest;

(5) Beneficial ownership filings shall be published in the National Infrastructure Transparency System established under subsection (q), with limited redaction of personal identifying information as Congress may provide by statute;

(6) Successor owners are bound by all obligations, orders, and enforcement actions applicable to their predecessors; transfer of ownership does not extinguish, suspend, or reset any pending compliance proceeding, ARB order, or remedial obligation under this Section.

(oo) **Emergency Federal Operation of Foreign-Owned Infrastructure.** When foreign-owned Critical Inter-Regional Corridor infrastructure fails to comply with mandates under this Section:

(1) The ARB may certify that non-compliance by a foreign-owned infrastructure operator threatens the continuity of inter-Regional commerce, triggering emergency federal operation authority under subsection (o);

(2) Emergency federal operation of foreign-owned infrastructure requires the same ARB certification and follows the same procedures as federal operational assumption under subsection (o), with the following additions: (A) the foreign owner's consent is not required; (B) compensation to the foreign owner during the period of emergency operation is limited to documented, audited operational costs, excluding lost profits, speculative damages, and opportunity costs; and (C) no treaty-based arbitration claim may arise from emergency operation conducted under this subsection;

(3) If emergency operation continues for more than one year due to the foreign owner's persistent non-compliance, or if mandatory divestment is required under subsection (ll)(6)(D), the ARB may recommend mandatory divestment to the Federal Senate, which may order divestment by majority vote;

(4) Compensation for mandatory divestment shall be fair market value as determined by domestic appraisal, not subject to international arbitration, and reduced by any damages or costs incurred by the federal government during emergency operation.

#### Informational Trade Barrier Prohibition

(pp) **Prohibition on Stigmatizing Regional Origin Labels.** No Region may mandate consumer disclosures on goods or services from other Regions that characterize the political, legal, regulatory, or social conditions of the originating Region:

(1) "Characterization" includes any mandatory label, disclosure, point-of-sale notice, or advertising requirement that: (A) describes or evaluates the originating Region's policies, enforcement practices, regulatory standards, political orientation, or social values; (B) compares the originating Region's standards to the labeling Region's own standards; or (C) uses language designed to discourage purchase or use based on the originating Region's governance characteristics;

(2) This prohibition applies to all mandatory disclosures including product labels, point-of-sale materials, advertising requirements, and digital platform disclosures required by Regional law;

(3) Violations of this subsection constitute per se violations of subsection (a), and are subject to the full remedies and enforcement mechanisms of subsections (m) through (p);

(4) Voluntary, private-sector labeling schemes are not subject to this prohibition unless a Region mandates participation, provides preferential treatment to participants — including tax incentives, procurement preferences, regulatory fast-tracking, or other official benefits — or penalizes non-participants.

(qq) **Permissible Consumer Disclosures.** This Section does not prohibit legitimate, product-specific consumer safety disclosures:

(1) Permissible mandatory disclosures are limited to: (A) ingredient lists and material composition; (B) nutritional information; (C) safety warnings based on objective, federally-verified product testing and standards; (D) geographic origin labeling limited to place of manufacture, with no evaluative language; and (E) disclosures required by federal statute or regulation;

(2) Regions may not impose mandatory disclosure requirements for inter-Regional goods that are stricter than applicable federal standards unless the Region can demonstrate a product-specific safety justification, supported by clear and convincing evidence, that is distinct from any characterization of the originating Region's governance;

(3) The ARB shall review contested labeling requirements upon petition by any affected Region, producer, or trade association. The ARB may grant emergency injunctive relief within fourteen days of petition if the petitioner demonstrates a prima facie case that the contested disclosure constitutes a characterization prohibited by subsection (pp). The ARB shall issue a final determination on the merits within sixty days of petition; if the ARB finds the disclosure requirement lacks product-specific safety justification, it shall permanently enjoin the requirement; if the ARB fails to issue a final determination within sixty days, the petitioner may seek injunctive relief directly in federal court;

(4) The burden of proving that a contested disclosure is a permissible consumer safety measure, rather than a stigmatizing characterization, rests on the Region imposing the requirement.

(rr) **Stigma Barrier Enforcement.** The ARB shall enforce the prohibition on informational trade barriers:

(1) Any Region, producer, or trade association whose goods or services are subject to labeling requirements that may violate subsection (pp) may petition the ARB for review under subsection (qq)(3), including emergency injunctive relief;

(2) Upon finding a violation, the ARB shall: (A) immediately enjoin the labeling requirement; (B) order the violating Region to remove all stigmatizing disclosures from commerce within thirty days; and (C) publish the finding and order in the National Infrastructure Transparency System;

(3) The affected Region may recover full economic damages, including lost sales, reputational harm, and consequential damages, from the violating Region; treble damages are available upon a finding of bad faith under subsection (n);

(4) A Region found to have imposed stigmatizing labels on three or more occasions within ten years is subject to: (A) suspension of its authority to impose mandatory consumer disclosure requirements on inter-Regional goods for five years, except for disclosures required by federal statute or regulation; (B) repeat offender designation under subsection (p) if the pattern constitutes a broader strategy of Non-Blockade violation; (C) during any suspension period, the ARB may authorize temporary emergency disclosures on a case-by-case basis if a public health or product safety hazard, verified by the relevant federal agency with product safety jurisdiction (including the Food and Drug Administration, Consumer Product Safety Commission, or Environmental Protection Agency), requires immediate consumer notification, provided such disclosures are limited to the specific hazard and duration of the emergency;

(5) Labeling challenges and outcomes shall be published in the National Infrastructure Transparency System, including the text of the challenged disclosure, the ARB's analysis, and any damages awarded.

#### Implementation Reference

(ss) Implementation procedures are established by statute. See the [National Common Market Access Act](../../proposals/03-economy-commerce/national-common-market-access-act.md) for the proposed implementing legislation.

### Section 7. Water Rights and Shared Waterways

(a) Interstate rivers, lakes, aquifers, and watersheds that cross or border Regional boundaries are shared resources. Water allocation among Regions shall be governed by principles of equitable apportionment.

(b) No Region may unilaterally divert, dam, or appropriate water in a manner that substantially diminishes the quantity or quality of water available to other Regions, or discharge pollutants that render water unusable by other Regions.

(c) Existing interstate water compacts shall remain in force unless superseded by Regional agreement or federal law.

(d) Nothing in this section shall diminish treaty obligations to Tribal Nations regarding water rights or authorize taking of water rights without just compensation.

(e) **Water Resources Coordination Board.** There is hereby established a Water Resources Coordination Board consisting of:

- one representative appointed by each Region,
- one representative of the Environmental Protection Agency,
- one representative of the Army Corps of Engineers,
- two representatives of Tribal Nations with water rights in affected watersheds (selected by a council of affected Tribes).

The Board shall coordinate water allocation, establish monitoring standards, and facilitate dispute resolution through mediation before adjudication.

(f) **National Water Court.** There is hereby established a National Water Court with exclusive original jurisdiction over interstate water disputes. The Court shall consist of five judges appointed by the President with Senate confirmation for twelve-year non-renewable terms, drawn from persons with expertise in water law, hydrology, or environmental science. At least two judges shall have experience representing Western states with prior appropriation systems, and at least two shall have experience representing Eastern states with riparian rights systems. The Court's decisions may be appealed to the Supreme Court on questions of constitutional interpretation.

(g) Implementation procedures are established by statute. See the [Interstate Water Resources Coordination Act](../../proposals/05-environment-infrastructure/water-resources-coordination-act.md) for the proposed implementing legislation.

---

### Section 8. Freedom of Movement

(a) All citizens of the United States shall have the right to:

- travel freely between and within Regions,
- establish residence in any Region,
- seek employment in any Region,
- access public services on equal terms with residents after establishing residence.

(b) No Region may:

- impose border controls, checkpoints, or travel documentation requirements for movement between Regions,
- require waiting periods exceeding ninety days for access to public services for new residents (excluding residency requirements for voting, which shall not exceed thirty days),
- discriminate in employment, housing, or public accommodations based on Region of origin,
- condition professional licensure or credentialing on Region of prior residence.

(c) Durational residency requirements are permissible only for:

- voting registration (not exceeding thirty days),
- in-state tuition eligibility at public institutions (not exceeding twelve months),
- candidacy for elected office (as established by statute, not exceeding the term length of the office sought).

(d) This section shall not be construed to:

- require Regions to subsidize relocation,
- prevent reasonable transition periods for benefit eligibility where portability is ensured,
- override legitimate public health quarantine measures during declared emergencies.

(e) A person whose freedom of movement has been impaired may seek injunctive relief in any Regional court, with expedited review (seven days).

#### Migration Surge Stabilization

(f) **Migration Surge Defined.** A "Migration Surge" occurs when a Region experiences net in-migration exceeding three percent (3%) of its population within any twelve-month period, as certified by the Census Bureau.

(g) **Surge Early Warning.** The Census Bureau shall:

- (1) monitor inter-Regional migration patterns quarterly;
- (2) issue "Surge Warnings" when a Region's net in-migration rate exceeds two percent (2%) annually;
- (3) provide detailed demographic and geographic data to affected Regions and the IFC.

(h) **Automatic Fiscal Stabilization.** Upon certification of a Migration Surge:

- (1) the affected Region shall receive emergency equalization transfers within thirty (30) days, calculated based on projected service costs for the incoming population;
- (2) transfers shall be funded from the Asymmetric Shock Stabilization Fund under Article X, Section 9;
- (3) the IFC shall adjust permanent equalization formulas within one (1) year to reflect the new population baseline.

(i) **Service Capacity Assistance.** The federal government shall provide:

- (1) emergency infrastructure grants for healthcare, education, and housing capacity expansion;
- (2) technical assistance for rapid service scaling;
- (3) temporary federal personnel to supplement Regional administrative capacity.

(j) **Anti-Degradation Mandate.** No Region may:

- (1) intentionally maintain services below the Region's fiscal capacity for the purpose of deterring in-migration;
- (2) impose waiting periods for service access exceeding those permitted under this section;
- (3) discriminate in service provision based on duration of residency beyond constitutionally permitted periods;
- (4) adopt "defensive degradation" strategies designed to make the Region less attractive to migrants.

(k) **Degradation Finding.** If the IFC determines that a Region is engaged in "Defensive Service Degradation":

- (1) the finding shall be published and transmitted to Congress;
- (2) the Region shall be ineligible for discretionary federal grants until the finding is reversed;
- (3) affected residents may bring civil rights claims for denial of services.

(l) **Origin Region Contribution.** When a Migration Surge results primarily from policy failures or service deficiencies in an origin Region:

- (1) the IFC may require the origin Region to contribute to surge stabilization costs;
- (2) contribution shall be proportional to the origin Region's share of the migrating population;
- (3) this provision creates incentives for all Regions to maintain adequate service levels.

(m) **Surge Stabilization Fund.** There is established within the Treasury a Migration Surge Stabilization Fund:

- (1) funded by annual appropriations of 0.1% of federal revenue;
- (2) accumulating during non-surge periods to ensure availability during surges;
- (3) administered by the IFC with expedited disbursement authority.

(n) **Preservation of Freedom of Movement.** Nothing in this section authorizes any restriction on the constitutional right of citizens to travel freely and establish residence in any Region. This section provides fiscal stabilization mechanisms only.

(o) **Prohibition on Exit Penalties.** *Resolves Gap 203 — The "Indentured Student" (Brain Drain Tax). Amended by Gap 181 — The "Benefit Serfdom" (Fiscal Berlin Wall).* No Region or State may impose any tax, fee, debt obligation, forfeiture or reduction of vested or accrued benefits, or financial penalty conditioned upon a person's decision to leave the jurisdiction or establish residence elsewhere. Any contract provision, including student loan forgiveness or tuition assistance, that imposes a financial penalty for relocation exceeding the actual principal and interest of the benefit received is void as an unconstitutional restriction on the freedom of movement.

(p) **Catastrophic Displacement Escalation.** When displacement resulting from natural disaster, climate event, or environmental catastrophe exceeds the capacity of the Migration Surge Stabilization mechanisms in this section, the President may declare a Displacement Emergency under Article XVII-RF, Section 5, activating enhanced federal coordination authority, fiscal indemnification, and displaced citizen protections. The Migration Surge Stabilization mechanisms of this section continue to operate concurrently with any Displacement Emergency declaration.

#### Benefit Portability

*Resolves Gap 181 — The "Benefit Serfdom" (Fiscal Berlin Wall). Prevents Regions from using benefit forfeiture to nullify the Right to Travel through economic coercion.*

(q) **Benefit Portability Mandate.** The right to travel includes the right to retain earned wealth. Any pension, health trust, educational account, deferred compensation arrangement, or other benefit accrued through contributions or service under the laws, regulations, or programs of a Region, State, or local government is the property of the beneficiary and shall be fully portable upon relocation:

(1) **Vesting.** No public benefit plan or Regionally-regulated private benefit plan may require more than five (5) years of contributions or service for full vesting. Vesting must accrue continuously on a graded basis — at minimum, twenty percent (20%) per year of qualifying service — and may not vest solely upon reaching a specific date or completing an indivisible period. Departure from the jurisdiction may not reset, suspend, or reduce vesting progress.

(2) **Portability Mechanism.** Upon relocation, the beneficiary may elect to:

- (A) maintain the account or benefit in the originating jurisdiction with equal access to distributions, communications, and account management regardless of residence; or
- (B) transfer the full actuarial value of the vested benefit to a qualified plan in the destination jurisdiction, a federally qualified retirement account, or a Federal Portability Account administered by the Independent Fiscal Council.

The originating jurisdiction may not impose conditions, penalties, or differential terms based on the beneficiary's choice.

(3) **Nominal Value Preservation.** The value of any benefit subject to this section shall be determined and transferred at its nominal accrued value. No jurisdiction may reduce, adjust, or recalculate a vested benefit based on:

- (A) cost-of-living differentials between the originating and destination jurisdictions;
- (B) tax rates, benefit levels, or fiscal conditions in the destination jurisdiction;
- (C) any "destination adjustment," "purchasing power parity," or "regional equivalency" formula; or
- (D) the beneficiary's reason for relocating.

(4) **Cash-Out for In-Kind Benefits.** For benefits provided as services rather than monetary payments — including retiree healthcare access, subsidized housing, or institutional care — the originating jurisdiction must offer a cash-out option equal to the actuarial present value of the service, calculated using IFC-promulgated standards under Article X, Section 20. The beneficiary may use the cash-out value to obtain equivalent services in the destination jurisdiction.

(5) **Partial Vesting.** A beneficiary who departs before full vesting retains all vested portions on a pro-rata basis. No minimum-vesting threshold may deny a partially vested beneficiary their accrued share.

(r) **Anti-Retention Gaming.** *No jurisdiction may use benefit design to create de facto barriers to the exercise of the Right to Travel:*

(1) **Residency-Differential Benefits.** No accrued or vested benefit may be conditioned on continued residency after it has vested. Supplemental payments, bonuses, or enhancements that increase the value of a vested benefit based on continued residency are prohibited. Residency-based incentives are permissible only for prospective, non-vested perquisites that do not affect the value of accrued benefits.

(2) **Employer Contributions.** Both employee contributions and employer contributions (including matching contributions) to any benefit plan subject to this section are the property of the beneficiary upon vesting and are equally portable. No jurisdiction may permit forfeiture of employer-contributed portions upon relocation while preserving employee-contributed portions.

(3) **Administrative Barriers.** Transfer requests must be processed within sixty (60) days of filing. Failure to process within this period results in:

- (A) automatic deemed approval of the transfer request;
- (B) interest accruing on the transfer value at the Federal Funds Rate plus five hundred (500) basis points from the date of filing; and
- (C) the originating jurisdiction's obligation to continue full benefit payments to the beneficiary during any processing period.

(4) **Spousal and Household Rights.** A spouse, domestic partner, or dependent's benefit rights are independently portable. No jurisdiction may:

- (A) condition one person's benefits on another household member's continued residency;
- (B) require both spouses to relocate for either to exercise portability; or
- (C) reduce survivor or dependent benefits based on the primary beneficiary's relocation.

(5) **Retroactive Reclassification Prohibited.** No jurisdiction may retroactively reclassify a beneficiary's plan membership, service category, or benefit tier after the beneficiary files notice of relocation or transfer. Any reclassification occurring within twelve (12) months of a relocation filing is presumptively void unless the jurisdiction demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the reclassification was initiated before any relocation decision.

(6) **Remote Verification.** Any eligibility verification, recertification, or compliance requirement for portable benefits must be available through remote means. No jurisdiction may require in-person appearance within the originating jurisdiction as a condition of continued benefit receipt.

(7) **Service Credit Portability.** Accrued service credits shall transfer at full value. No jurisdiction may freeze, reduce, or refuse to recognize service credits earned in the originating jurisdiction for purposes of benefit calculation in the destination jurisdiction's system.

(s) **Scope and Application.**

(1) **Public Benefits.** This section applies to all pension, retirement, health trust, educational savings, deferred compensation, and other accrued benefit programs operated directly by Regional, State, or local governments.

(2) **Regionally-Regulated Private Plans.** This section extends to any private benefit plan that is:

- (A) mandated by Regional or State law as a condition of employment;
- (B) subsidized by Regional or State funds, tax credits, or matching contributions;
- (C) operated under a charter, license, or regulatory framework established by the Region or State as a substitute for or supplement to public benefit programs; or
- (D) designed or structured pursuant to Regional or State legislation that prescribes the plan's material terms, including vesting schedules, forfeiture provisions, or portability conditions.

(3) **Safe Harbor.** Plans regulated exclusively under federal law, including plans governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act or its successor statute, are not subject to this section to the extent that federal portability requirements apply. This safe harbor does not extend to state-chartered or Region-chartered plans that adopt federal plan structures solely to claim exemption from this section.

(4) **No De Minimis Exception.** This section applies regardless of the monetary value of the benefit. No jurisdiction may evade portability requirements by dividing a benefit program into multiple smaller programs, each below a threshold.

(t) **Actuarial Procedures.**

(1) **Valuation Methodology.** The Pension Actuarial Division of the Independent Fiscal Council shall promulgate standardized valuation methodologies for calculating the actuarial present value of benefits subject to transfer under this section, consistent with the actuarial standards established under Article X, Section 20.

(2) **Dispute Resolution.** Where the originating and destination jurisdictions, or a beneficiary and a jurisdiction, dispute the actuarial value of a benefit:

- (A) the dispute shall be submitted to the Allocation Review Board;
- (B) the ARB shall render a binding determination within sixty (60) days using IFC-promulgated valuation methodology;
- (C) the beneficiary shall continue receiving full benefits from the originating jurisdiction during the dispute period; and
- (D) interest shall accrue on any underpayment at the Federal Funds Rate from the date of the transfer request.

(3) **Portability as Distinct from Arbitrage.** Portability under this section preserves the value of benefits already earned through past contributions and service. It does not entitle a beneficiary to enhancements, higher benefit formulas, or improved terms available in the destination jurisdiction that the beneficiary has not earned through contributions or service in that jurisdiction. The benefit arbitrage prohibition under subsection (jj) of Section 10 of this Article applies to attempts to claim unearned benefits through strategic relocation.

(u) **Enforcement.**

(1) **Private Right of Action.** Any person whose benefit portability rights under this section are violated may bring suit in Federal District Court and recover:

- (A) the full value of any forfeited, reduced, or improperly withheld benefits;
- (B) treble damages for willful violations;
- (C) reasonable attorney's fees and costs; and
- (D) injunctive relief compelling compliance.

(2) **IFC Compliance Audits.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall include portability compliance in its annual pension audits under Article X, Section 20. The IFC may refer findings of systemic non-compliance to the Attorney General.

(3) **Attorney General Authority.** The Attorney General may seek injunctive relief in Federal District Court against any jurisdiction operating benefit programs in systematic violation of this section. A pattern of three (3) or more individual portability violations within any twenty-four (24) month period creates a rebuttable presumption of systematic violation.

(4) **Personal Liability.** Officials who knowingly design, implement, or administer benefit programs with the purpose of evading the portability requirements of this section are subject to personal civil liability and removal from office under the same standards applicable to fiscal negligence under Article X, Section 10.

---

### Section 9. Mutual Recognition

(a) Full Faith and Credit. Each jurisdiction shall give full faith and credit to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other jurisdiction.

(b) Legal Status Recognition. Marriages, civil unions, domestic partnerships, divorces, adoptions, parentage determinations, surrogacy agreements, custody orders, guardianship orders, name changes, powers of attorney, corporate registrations, property titles, and all other legal determinations of family status or relationship established under any jurisdiction's law shall be recognized in all other jurisdictions.

(c) Professional Credentials. Professional licenses shall be recognized for practice in all jurisdictions, subject only to registration, fees not exceeding the lesser of actual administrative processing costs or the fee charged to in-Region professionals for license renewal in the same profession, and verification of good standing. Supplementary requirements may be imposed only where the receiving jurisdiction's standards demonstrably exceed those of the issuing jurisdiction.

(d) Academic Credentials. Educational degrees from accredited institutions shall be recognized throughout the United States.

(e) No jurisdiction may refuse recognition based on religious or moral objection, political disagreement, economic protectionism, or retaliation.

(f) This section is self-executing and does not require implementing legislation to take effect. Implementation procedures may be supplemented by statute. See the [Interstate Professional Licensing Reciprocity Act](../../proposals/04-social-policy-labor/interstate-professional-licensing-act.md) for proposed supplementary legislation.

#### Rebuttable Presumption of Competency

(g) **Presumption of Competency.** A credential validly issued by any Region creates a rebuttable presumption of competency to practice in all Regions:

(1) The receiving Region bears the burden of demonstrating that supplementary requirements are necessary;

(2) The standard for supplementary requirements is "Essential for Public Safety" (not merely "demonstrably exceed");

(3) Convenience, preference, or economic protection do not constitute public safety necessity.

(h) **Essential for Public Safety Standard.** A supplementary requirement is "Essential for Public Safety" only if:

(1) It addresses a specific, documented risk to public health, safety, or welfare;

(2) The risk is unique to the receiving Region and not adequately addressed by the issuing Region's standards;

(3) The requirement is narrowly tailored to address only that specific risk;

(4) Less restrictive alternatives are inadequate.

(i) **Prohibited Justifications.** The following do not constitute public safety necessity:

(1) General assertions that Regional standards are "higher" or "more rigorous";

(2) Economic impact on existing Regional practitioners;

(3) Differences in educational institution accreditation;

(4) Requirements for Region-specific knowledge not directly related to professional competency.

#### ARB Pre-Approval for Supplementary Requirements

(j) **ARB Certification Required.** Before imposing any supplementary credential requirement on out-of-Region professionals, a Region must:

(1) Submit the proposed requirement to the Allocation Review Board;

(2) Demonstrate that the requirement meets the "Essential for Public Safety" standard;

(3) Receive ARB certification within ninety (90) days.

(k) **Automatic Recognition.** If the ARB fails to rule within ninety (90) days:

(1) The supplementary requirement is deemed not certified;

(2) The out-of-Region credential must be recognized without supplement;

(3) The Region may resubmit with additional justification.

(l) **Grandfathering.** Supplementary requirements in effect at ratification:

(1) Remain valid for two (2) years;

(2) Must be submitted for ARB certification within one (1) year;

(3) Uncertified requirements become void after the two-year transition period.

#### Anti-Protectionism Provisions

(m) **Facially Neutral Discrimination.** A credential requirement that is facially neutral but has disparate impact on out-of-Region professionals:

(1) Is subject to strict scrutiny;

(2) Must be justified by compelling public safety interest;

(3) Creates rebuttable presumption of protectionist intent if adopted within twenty-four (24) months of significant credential migration.

(n) **Prohibited Practices.** Regions may not:

(1) Require continuing education obtainable only within the Region;

(2) Impose "cultural competency" or "regional knowledge" requirements beyond those directly necessary for professional practice;

(3) Condition reciprocity on political, economic, or policy concessions;

(4) Revoke reciprocity for reasons unrelated to credential standards.

(o) **Expedited Judicial Review.** Professionals denied credential recognition may:

(1) Appeal directly to the National Constitutional Court;

(2) Receive expedited ruling within sixty (60) days;

(3) Practice under provisional recognition pending appeal if they demonstrate valid out-of-Region credential.

#### Delegated Authority and Processing

(p) **Delegated Authority.** The obligations of this Section apply to any entity, public or private, to which a Region or State has delegated the authority to license, certify, or regulate a profession, including professional associations, examining boards, and credentialing bodies. Acts of such entities in the exercise of delegated licensing authority are acts of the delegating jurisdiction for constitutional purposes. No Region may evade the requirements of this Section by delegating licensing authority to an entity that claims exemption from constitutional obligations.

(q) **Processing Timeline and Automatic Recognition.**

(1) Applications for credential recognition shall be processed within thirty (30) days of submission of a complete application;

(2) Failure to issue a specific, written denial based on a supplementary requirement certified under subsection (h) within thirty (30) days constitutes automatic recognition by operation of law;

(3) A denial must identify the specific certified supplementary requirement not met and the specific deficiency in the applicant's qualifications;

(4) Criminal history review, where relevant to professional fitness, does not extend the thirty-day deadline; the reviewing jurisdiction must complete all background review within the same period;

(5) During the first ninety (90) days of practice following recognition, professional liability insurance valid in the originating Region shall be accepted as valid in the receiving Region.

#### Interim Practice and Scope Resolution

(r) **Interim Practice and Partial Recognition.**

(1) Upon submission of a valid application for credential recognition, a professional is immediately authorized to practice within the common scope shared by the originating and receiving licenses;

(2) Disputes regarding supplementary requirements for scope elements that differ between Regions shall not suspend the right to practice within the undisputed common scope;

(3) Supplementary requirements for differing scope elements shall be resolved within six (6) months; failure to resolve within six (6) months constitutes recognition of the full scope;

(4) The right to recognition and practice under this Section extends to remote provision of professional services where the professional is located in one Region and the client or patient is in another;

(5) During a declared emergency under Article XI or any Regional emergency declaration, the registration requirement of subsection (c) is suspended, and any professional holding a valid credential from any Region may practice immediately without application.

(s) **Supervised Practice Cap.** Any supplementary requirement for supervised practice certified by the ARB under subsection (h) shall not exceed ninety (90) days. A Region may not circumvent this limitation by requiring sequential supervised practice periods under different supervisory classifications.

#### Anti-Retaliation and Federal Backstop

(t) **Anti-Retaliation.**

(1) No licensing board, professional association, credentialing body, or entity exercising delegated licensing authority may discriminate against, impose heightened scrutiny upon, conduct targeted audits of, or discipline a professional for exercising rights under this Section;

(2) No Region may revoke, suspend, or restrict reciprocal recognition of another Region's credentials absent ARB certification that the other Region's standards have materially degraded below the Essential for Public Safety threshold;

(3) Violations of this subsection are subject to the remedies and penalties established in Section 14, including treble damages and federal preemption of the offending licensing authority after a pattern of two (2) or more violations within five (5) years;

(4) A professional who prevails in a claim under this subsection shall recover attorney fees and costs.

(u) **Federal Backstop.**

(1) Upon a finding by the National Constitutional Court or the Allocation Review Board that a Region has systematically failed to comply with this Section — including systematic processing delays, pattern of pretextual denials, delegation to non-compliant bodies, or refusal to recognize ARB-certified credentials — the Federal Government shall issue Federal Practice Credentials to affected professionals;

(2) A Federal Practice Credential supersedes Regional licensing requirements and authorizes practice throughout the United States;

(3) The Federal Practice Credential shall be issued within fourteen (14) days of the finding of systematic non-compliance;

(4) The non-compliant Region's licensing authority for the affected profession is suspended until the Region demonstrates compliance to the satisfaction of the ARB;

(5) The Independent Fiscal Council shall monitor professional workforce flows across Regions and report annually on credential recognition compliance, processing times, denial rates, and any patterns suggesting protectionist obstruction.

#### Family Status Portability

(v) **Full Incidents of Recognition.**

(1) Recognition of legal status under subsection (b) entails the obligation to honor all legal incidents, rights, benefits, privileges, and obligations associated with that status, including but not limited to: spousal benefits and insurance coverage, inheritance and survivorship rights, hospital visitation and medical decision-making authority, emergency contact designation, parental rights and custody, child support obligations, property rights and community property protections, testimonial privileges and confidential communications, tax filing status and exemptions, and immigration benefits dependent on family relationship;

(2) A Region shall extend to a recognized out-of-Region status the same incidents it extends to the most comparable status under its own law. If no comparable status exists under Regional law, the Region shall extend the incidents applicable under federal law;

(3) Selective recognition — acknowledging a status for some legal purposes (such as debt liability or tax obligation) while denying recognition for others (such as spousal benefits or inheritance rights) — is prohibited;

(4) Re-characterization of a validly established status as a lesser legal category (such as characterizing a marriage as a "civil arrangement" or "domestic contract" with fewer incidents) constitutes a denial of recognition;

(5) Functional non-recognition — imposing conditions, delays, re-registration requirements, or procedural burdens that render recognition ineffective in practice — is prohibited.

(w) **Continuity of Parentage.**

(1) The relationship between parent and child, once validly established by birth, adoption, parentage determination, surrogacy agreement, adjudication, or operation of law in any Region, is inviolable and travels with the parent and child regardless of relocation;

(2) No Region may deny, sever, diminish, or refuse to recognize a legal parent-child relationship recognized in another jurisdiction;

(3) An adoption decree or parentage determination final in one Region is final in all Regions. Re-adoption proceedings in a receiving Region are prohibited;

(4) No child shall be rendered a legal orphan or lose a legal parent due to interstate relocation;

(5) Termination of a parent-child relationship may occur only through judicial proceedings meeting federal due process requirements, based on a specific finding of parental unfitness, and may not be based on the characteristics of the parents that are protected under subsection (z);

(6) Custody orders and child support orders issued by a court of competent jurisdiction are enforceable in all Regions. A Region may not modify a custody order from another Region except upon a finding of changed circumstances under the law of the Region with jurisdiction, and may not use modification proceedings to nullify the parent-child relationship itself.

(x) **Conflict of Laws.**

(1) The validity of a civil status is determined by the law of the jurisdiction where it was established;

(2) The legal incidents of the status are determined by the law of the jurisdiction of current residence, subject to the requirements that no jurisdiction may extinguish the fundamental legal relationship, deny the minimum incidents enumerated in subsection (v)(1), or discriminate based on the characteristics protected under subsection (z);

(3) Modifications of status (divorce, custody modification, adoption dissolution) are governed by the law of the jurisdiction with subject-matter and personal jurisdiction over the modification proceeding;

(4) Civil status established prior to the effective date of this section shall receive the same recognition as status established afterward. No Region may retroactively nullify, invalidate, or refuse recognition of a previously recognized family status.

(y) **Exclusive Domain Limitation.**

(1) The Exclusive Regional Domain over family law under Article II, Section 1(e)(2)(iv) authorizes Regions to define family structures and establish family law for their own domiciliaries;

(2) The Exclusive Regional Domain does not authorize a Region to refuse recognition of family status validly established under the laws of another Region;

(3) In any conflict between a Regional definition of family law and the recognition obligations of this Section, the recognition obligations prevail;

(4) A Region retains full authority to establish requirements for the creation of new family status within its borders, including age, consent, capacity, and procedural requirements, subject to federal constitutional protections.

(z) **Anti-Discrimination in Family Status Recognition.**

(1) Recognition of family status may not be denied, delayed, diminished, or conditioned based on the sex, gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, age, disability, or any other characteristic of the parties to the status;

(2) No jurisdiction may invoke "public policy," "public order," "public morals," or any similar doctrine to refuse recognition of family status validly established in another Region, except that a Region may decline to recognize a relationship involving a party who was below the age of consent in the receiving Region at the time the relationship was established or a party who did not consent;

(3) Delegated bodies — including religious courts, private institutions, and any entity exercising family law authority on behalf of a Region — are bound by the same recognition obligations as the delegating Region. A Region may not evade the requirements of this Section by delegating family law administration to entities that refuse recognition.

(aa) **Enforcement and Emergency Relief.**

(1) Presentation of a valid vital record, court order, or official certificate of family status from any Region creates a presumption of recognition in all other Regions. In medical emergencies, custodial crises, or any situation requiring immediate determination of family status, this presumption is conclusive pending judicial review;

(2) A person denied recognition of family status under this Section may bring suit in any federal court for declaratory and injunctive relief, and shall recover compensatory damages, attorney fees, and costs;

(3) Expedited review: any federal court shall rule on a claim under this Section within fourteen (14) days of filing. Temporary restraining orders shall issue within forty-eight (48) hours upon showing of valid out-of-Region status and imminent or ongoing harm;

(4) The United States Department of Justice shall have authority to bring enforcement actions against Regions that systematically deny family status recognition. A pattern of three (3) or more denials within twenty-four (24) months creates a rebuttable presumption of systematic non-compliance;

(5) Family status recognition follows the person, not the domicile. A person's family status is recognized in all Regions where any family member resides, works, travels, or receives services, regardless of which Region established the status.

### Section 10. Data Sovereignty and Critical Governance Data

#### Critical Governance Data Classification

(a) **Critical Governance Data Defined.** The following categories constitute "Critical Governance Data" subject to this section:

(1) **Electoral Data:** Voter registration, election results, redistricting data, campaign finance records;

(2) **Fiscal Data:** Tax assessments, collections, expenditures, and audit records at all levels;

(5) **Public Safety Data:** Law enforcement records, emergency response data, public health surveillance.

(b) **Shared Constitutional Utility.** Critical Governance Data is hereby declared a "Shared Constitutional Utility":

(1) No single level of government has exclusive ownership;

(2) All levels with constitutional functions requiring the data have access rights;

(3) The physical location of servers or infrastructure does not determine ownership or control.

(c) **Interoperability Mandate.** All Critical Governance Data systems shall:

(1) Use standardized formats enabling cross-level access;

(2) Maintain real-time or near-real-time synchronization where technically feasible;

(3) Provide API access to authorized government entities at all levels.

(d) **IFC Data Standards Authority.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall establish and maintain:

(1) Technical standards for Critical Governance Data interoperability;

(2) Security protocols for data access and transmission;

(3) Audit procedures for data integrity verification.

#### Prohibition on Digital Blockade

(e) **Prohibition on Data Denial.** No Federal, Regional, or State government may:

(1) Deny, restrict, or condition another level's access to Critical Governance Data necessary for that level's constitutional functions;

(2) Encrypt, silo, or technically obstruct access to shared data systems;

(3) Require approval, licensing, or payment for access to data necessary for constitutional functions;

(4) Provide data in formats designed to impede practical use.

(f) **Constitutional Function Nexus.** Access rights attach when:

(1) The requesting level has an enumerated constitutional power;

(2) Exercise of that power requires the specific data requested;

(3) The nexus between data and function is not pretextual.

(g) **Presumption of Access.** Requests for Critical Governance Data:

(1) Are presumptively valid when made by an authorized government entity;

(2) Must be fulfilled within seventy-two hours absent legitimate technical constraints;

(3) May be denied only upon specific, written justification subject to ARB review.

(h) **Technical Obstruction as Violation.** Providing data in deliberately unusable formats, imposing unreasonable technical requirements, or maintaining "legacy systems" that prevent interoperability without documented modernization plans:

(1) Constitutes constructive denial;

(2) Is subject to the same penalties as outright refusal;

(3) Creates rebuttable presumption of bad faith if the obstructing level has opposed the requesting level's exercise of constitutional authority.

#### Data Integrity and Reconciliation

(i) **Single Source of Truth.** For each category of Critical Governance Data, the IFC shall designate:

(1) A "Primary Custodian" responsible for maintaining the authoritative record;

(2) Reconciliation procedures when multiple sources conflict;

(3) Appeals process for disputed data.

(j) **Primary Custodian Assignment.**

(1) **Electoral Data:** State governments, subject to Federal and Regional audit rights;

(2) **Citizenship/Identity Data:** Federal government;

(3) **Infrastructure Data:** Level operating the infrastructure, subject to oversight access by regulators;

(4) **Tax Data:** Collecting level, with mandatory sharing to other levels with tax authority over same base.

(k) **Mandatory Reconciliation.** When data from different levels conflicts:

(1) The levels shall conduct reconciliation within thirty days;

(2) If reconciliation fails, the IFC shall determine the authoritative record;

(3) Levels refusing to participate in reconciliation forfeit their position in any dispute.

(l) **Audit Rights.** Any level of government may:

(1) Audit Critical Governance Data maintained by another level for accuracy;

(2) Request independent verification by the IFC;

(3) Publish audit findings (excluding personally identifiable information).

#### Privacy and Security Protections

(m) **Privacy Preservation.** Data access under this section:

(1) Is limited to data necessary for constitutional functions;

(2) Does not authorize disclosure to private parties without independent legal authority;

(3) Requires compliance with applicable privacy laws and the National Rights Floor;

(4) Prohibits use of accessed data for purposes beyond the stated constitutional function.

(n) **Security Requirements.** All Critical Governance Data systems shall:

(1) Meet cybersecurity standards established by the IFC in consultation with federal cybersecurity agencies;

(2) Maintain access logs subject to audit;

(3) Implement role-based access controls limiting data exposure to authorized personnel.

(o) **Breach Notification.** Any breach of Critical Governance Data:

(1) Must be reported to all affected levels within twenty-four hours;

(2) Must be reported to the public within seventy-two hours;

(3) Triggers mandatory security review by the IFC.

(p) **No Privacy Shield for Obstruction.** Privacy concerns may not be invoked to:

(1) Deny government-to-government data sharing for constitutional functions;

(2) Justify encryption or access controls that exclude other government levels;

(3) The privacy of individuals is protected by limiting downstream use, not by blocking intergovernmental access.

#### Enforcement and Remedies

(q) **Digital Blockade as Constitutional Violation.** Denial of Critical Governance Data access:

(1) Constitutes a violation of this Constitution equivalent to physical obstruction of federal officers;

(2) May be enjoined by the National Constitutional Court;

(3) Officials responsible for denial are personally liable and may be removed from office.

(r) **Emergency Access Orders.** If a level claims urgent need for data access:

(1) The ARB may issue an Emergency Access Order within twenty-four hours;

(2) The order requires immediate compliance pending full adjudication;

(3) Failure to comply with an Emergency Access Order constitutes contempt.

(s) **Federal Data Backup Authority.** If a State or Region persistently denies data access:

(1) The Federal government may establish parallel data collection systems;

(2) The obstructing level bears the cost of duplicate systems;

(3) Federal data becomes authoritative for federal functions regardless of State/Regional objection.

(t) **Integration with Infrastructure Protections.** Data and telemetry shall be treated as "transit-protected assets" under Section 6:

(1) Digital blockade is subject to the same review and penalties as physical infrastructure obstruction;

(2) The National Infrastructure Transparency System shall include data system availability;

(3) "Data Reliability Scores" shall be published alongside infrastructure reliability scores.

(u) **Specialized Data Access Provisions.** Nothing in this section limits:

(1) Federal Data Supremacy for rights enforcement under Article II, Section 1;

(2) Forensic audit authority under Article X, Section 3;

(3) Algorithmic transparency requirements established by statute pursuant to this section;

(4) Transition data requirements under the Transition Framework.

(v) **Hierarchy of Access.** When specialized provisions conflict with general provisions:

(1) Rights enforcement access takes precedence for individual rights data;

(2) Forensic audit authority takes precedence for fiscal data;

(3) General provisions of this section apply as default for all other data categories.

(w) **Privacy Reconciliation.** The privacy protections of subsection (m) are reconciled with specialized access as follows:

(1) Minimization requirements of subsection (m) apply to all specialized access;

(2) Use restrictions of subsection (m)(4) apply regardless of access authority;

(3) Specialized provisions may expand access scope but not diminish privacy safeguards.

#### Neutral Use Mandate and Anti-Profiling Protections

(w-1) **Neutral Use Mandate.** Critical Governance Data accessed under this section shall be used only for neutral, non-partisan governmental functions:

- (1) No jurisdiction may use shared data to target, profile, or disadvantage residents based on political affiliation, voting history, Region of origin, or ideological beliefs;
- (2) No jurisdiction may use shared data to influence election outcomes, voter turnout, or political participation in other jurisdictions;
- (3) No jurisdiction may use shared data to identify or target political opponents, activists, journalists, or members of disfavored groups.

(w-2) **Prohibited Uses.** The following uses of Critical Governance Data are absolutely prohibited:

- (1) constructing political profiles of individuals or demographic groups;
- (2) predictive modeling of voting behavior or political activity;
- (3) selective enforcement of laws or regulations based on political characteristics;
- (4) sharing data with political campaigns, parties, or partisan organizations;
- (5) using Electoral Data for any purpose other than election administration;
- (6) using Public Safety Data to monitor lawful political activity.

(w-3) **Enhanced Protections for Sensitive Categories.** The following data categories require additional safeguards:

- (1) **Electoral Data:** Access limited to election administration purposes; no cross-referencing with law enforcement data except for specific voter fraud investigations with judicial authorization;
- (2) **Public Safety Data:** No access for immigration enforcement purposes; no sharing with federal agencies for political surveillance;
- (3) **Identity Data:** No use for tracking inter-Regional migration patterns for political purposes.

(w-4) **Data Use Audits.** Each jurisdiction accessing Critical Governance Data shall:

- (1) maintain detailed logs of all data queries, including purpose, requestor, and data accessed;
- (2) submit to annual audits by the Federal Data Coordination Agency for compliance with this section;
- (3) publish anonymized summaries of data access patterns.

(w-5) **Enforcement and Penalties.** Violations of this section shall result in:

- (1) immediate termination of data access privileges for the violating jurisdiction;
- (2) civil penalties of up to $1,000,000 per violation;
- (3) personal liability for officials who authorized or conducted prohibited uses;
- (4) criminal referral for willful violations constituting civil rights violations.

(w-6) **Private Right of Action.** Any individual who is targeted, profiled, or disadvantaged through prohibited use of Critical Governance Data may:

- (1) bring a civil action against the responsible jurisdiction and officials;
- (2) recover actual damages, statutory damages of $10,000 per violation, and attorney fees;
- (3) obtain injunctive relief including data deletion and access termination.

(x) **Federal Data Coordination Agency.** There is hereby established a Federal Data Coordination Agency with the following responsibilities:

(1) **Technical Standards Development.** The Agency shall develop and maintain binding technical standards for Critical Governance Data interoperability, including:

- (i) data format specifications and schema requirements;
- (ii) API protocols and authentication standards;
- (iii) encryption and security requirements;
- (iv) synchronization frequency and latency requirements by data category.

(2) **Legacy System Transition.** The Agency shall:

- (i) inventory all existing government data systems within two years of ratification;
- (ii) establish a ten-year transition timeline for legacy system compliance;
- (iii) provide technical assistance and funding to jurisdictions for system modernization;
- (iv) grant compliance extensions for demonstrated hardship, not to exceed five additional years.

(3) **Security Coordination.** The Agency shall maintain a unified security operations center for Critical Governance Data that:

- (i) monitors for unauthorized access attempts across all jurisdictions;
- (ii) coordinates incident response for data breaches affecting multiple jurisdictions;
- (iii) conducts annual security audits of all connected systems;
- (iv) maintains backup and disaster recovery capabilities for Critical Governance Data.

(4) **Composition.** The Agency shall be governed by a board consisting of:

- (i) one representative appointed by each Regional Governor;
- (ii) two representatives appointed by the President;
- (iii) one representative appointed by the Chief Justice;
- (iv) one non-voting technical advisor selected by the board from the private sector.

(5) **Funding.** The Agency shall be funded through mandatory appropriations not subject to annual discretion, apportioned among the federal government and Regions based on data system usage.

(y) **Liability for Interoperability Failures.** A jurisdiction that fails to maintain interoperability as required by this section and thereby causes demonstrable harm to another jurisdiction's constitutional functions shall be liable for:

(1) actual damages incurred by the affected jurisdiction;

(2) costs of alternative data access arrangements;

(3) civil penalties not to exceed $100,000 per day of non-compliance following notice and a ninety-day cure period.

(z) **Data Hygiene and Quality Certification.**

(1) **Annual Data Quality Audit.** Each jurisdiction maintaining Critical Governance Data shall undergo an annual data quality audit by the Federal Data Coordination Agency assessing:

- (i) accuracy rates (percentage of records verified against source documents);
- (ii) synchronization latency (time between source updates and API availability);
- (iii) completeness (percentage of required fields populated);
- (iv) system stability (uptime and error rates).

(2) **Certification Grades.** The Agency shall assign each jurisdiction a Data Quality Grade:

- (i) Grade A: Meets all standards; full data sharing privileges;
- (ii) Grade B: Minor deficiencies; must submit remediation plan within 90 days;
- (iii) Grade C: Significant deficiencies; data access restricted to read-only by other jurisdictions until remediation;
- (iv) Grade F: Critical failures; data deemed unreliable and may not be used for constitutional functions until remediation verified.

(3) **Phantom Data Prohibition.** Jurisdictions may not represent data as current or accurate when:

- (i) source systems have not been updated within required synchronization windows;
- (ii) known data quality issues have not been disclosed;
- (iii) legacy system limitations prevent verification.

(4) **Consequences for Persistent Failure.** A jurisdiction receiving Grade C or below for three consecutive years:

- (i) shall have data system operations placed under Federal Data Coordination Agency supervision;
- (ii) shall receive mandatory technical assistance funded by federal appropriation;
- (iii) may not cite data system limitations as a defense in any proceeding requiring that data.

#### Conceptual Uniformity and Semantic Integrity

(5) **Standardized Federal Definitions (SFD).** To prevent "Epistemic Sabotage"—the manipulation of internal legal definitions to game federal formulas—the Independent Fiscal Council (IFC) and the Federal Data Coordination Agency (FDCA) shall maintain a "Compendium of Standardized Federal Definitions" for all terms used in constitutional formulas, including but not limited to:

- (i) "Poverty Level" and "Fiscal Capacity";
- (ii) "Unemployment" and "Labor Force Participation";
- (iii) "Infrastructure Health" and "Deferred Maintenance";
- (iv) "Educational Outcome" and "Service Adequacy";
- (v) any other term whose measurement affects equalization transfers, fiscal allocations, or constitutional thresholds.

(6) **Anti-Semantic Fraud Rule.** No Region or State may use idiosyncratic or "shadow" definitions of constitutional terms in their reports to the FDCA or IFC:

- (i) Any data submission using non-standard definitions shall be assigned a "Grade F" for Data Quality regardless of technical accuracy;
- (ii) If a Region changes an internal definition in a way that results in a greater than five percent (5%) change in their Equalization Transfer eligibility, the change is presumptively fraudulent and shall be stayed pending a "Semantic Audit";
- (iii) Regions found to have engaged in deliberate semantic manipulation shall forfeit the excess transfers received plus a twenty percent (20%) penalty.

(7) **Definition Change Notification.** Any Region intending to modify an internal definition that affects constitutional formula inputs shall:

- (i) notify the IFC at least ninety (90) days before the change takes effect;
- (ii) provide detailed justification for the definitional change;
- (iii) await IFC pre-certification that the change is "Semantically Neutral" or accept flagging for Semantic Audit before implementation;
- (iv) failure to provide advance notification creates an irrebuttable presumption of bad faith.

(8) **Semantic Audit Authority.** The IFC shall have the power to "pierce the definition" of any Regional data point to ensure it reflects the underlying economic or social reality, regardless of the label used by the Region:

- (i) Semantic Audits may be triggered by the five percent threshold, inter-Regional complaint, or IFC initiative;
- (ii) The audit shall compare Regional definitions to federal standards and assess whether deviations materially affect formula outcomes;
- (iii) Audit findings are binding and may require restatement of prior submissions.

(9) **Transparency of Conceptual Logic.** The Plain-Language Explanations required under Article II, Section 7-A must explicitly state the conceptual logic used to categorize data:

- (i) "Black-box" categorizations where the meaning of the input is hidden by the algorithm are prohibited;
- (ii) All definitional assumptions must be disclosed and subject to challenge;
- (iii) The IFC shall publish an annual "Semantic Integrity Report" identifying any Regions whose definitions deviate materially from federal standards.

#### Digital Portability and Privacy Harmonization

(aa) **Prohibition on Data-Localization Barriers.** No Region may enact data residency, data localization, or data sovereignty requirements that:

- (1) require physical storage of data exclusively within Regional boundaries as a condition of doing business;
- (2) prohibit the transfer of data to other Regions for legitimate business operations;
- (3) create compliance obligations that are mutually exclusive with the data regulations of other Regions.

(bb) **Federal Privacy Floor.** Congress shall establish, within three years of ratification, a Federal Digital Privacy Floor providing:

- (1) minimum data protection standards applicable in all Regions;
- (2) mutual recognition of Regional privacy certifications meeting or exceeding the Floor;
- (3) a single point of compliance for multi-Regional enterprises.

(cc) **Privacy Portability Certification.** The Federal Data Coordination Agency shall maintain a "Privacy Portability Certification" process whereby:

- (1) Regional privacy regimes that meet the Federal Floor are deemed mutually compatible;
- (2) enterprises certified under any Floor-compliant Regional regime may operate in all Regions without additional privacy compliance burdens;
- (3) Regions may exceed the Floor for intra-Regional operations but may not impose above-Floor requirements on inter-Regional data flows.

(dd) **Conflict Resolution.** When Regional data regulations conflict:

- (1) the ARB shall determine which Regional requirement governs for inter-Regional transactions;
- (2) the default rule shall be that the data subject's Region of residence governs privacy rights, while the enterprise's Region of principal operation governs operational requirements;
- (3) Regions may not apply their regulations extraterritorially to data transactions with no substantial nexus to the Region.

(ee) **Anti-Fragmentation Review.** Every five years, the Federal Data Coordination Agency shall report to Congress on whether Regional data regulations are creating "Digital Regulatory Walls" that impede the Common Market. If fragmentation is found, Congress may establish additional harmonization requirements by ordinary legislation.

#### Tax Residency and Economic Nexus

(ff) **Primary Tax Residency Determination.** For purposes of individual income taxation, a natural person's primary tax residency shall be the Region where the person maintains their principal place of abode, determined by:

- (1) physical presence exceeding one hundred eighty-three days in a calendar year; or
- (2) if no single Region meets the physical presence test, the Region where the person maintains their primary dwelling, family residence, voter registration, and principal community ties.

(gg) **Prohibition on Tax Residency Arbitrage.** No person may claim tax residency in a Region other than their primary tax residency Region for the purpose of avoiding income tax obligations. Specifically:

- (1) "digital residency," "e-residency," or similar status shall not constitute tax residency unless accompanied by genuine physical presence meeting the standards of subsection (ff);
- (2) no Region may offer tax residency status to individuals who do not meet the physical presence or primary dwelling requirements;
- (3) shell residencies, nominal addresses, or residency-for-purchase arrangements shall be void for tax purposes.

(hh) **Economic Nexus for Services.** A person who is tax-resident in one Region but performs substantial remote work for employers or clients located in another Region shall:

- (1) owe income tax to their Region of tax residency on all income;
- (2) be entitled to a credit against their home Region tax for any withholding or income tax paid to the work-source Region, up to the amount of home Region tax on that income; and
- (3) not be subject to double taxation through cumulative Regional income taxes exceeding the higher of the two Regions' rates.

(ii) **Apportionment for Multi-Regional Activity.** The Inter-Regional Fiscal Court shall promulgate uniform rules for apportioning income among Regions when an individual:

- (1) maintains genuine residences in multiple Regions;
- (2) earns income from sources in multiple Regions; or
- (3) operates a business with substantial activities in multiple Regions.
These rules shall prevent both double taxation and tax avoidance through artificial arrangements.

(jj) **Regional Benefit Arbitrage.** No person may claim public benefits, subsidies, or services from a Region in which they are not tax-resident except:

- (1) emergency services available to all persons regardless of residency;
- (2) services explicitly extended to non-residents by Regional law;
- (3) reciprocal services under inter-Regional compacts; or
- (4) services for which the non-resident pays full cost.
A Region may require proof of tax residency as a condition of receiving resident-only benefits.

#### Census Protection

*[Gap 174: Census Sabotage — Data Denial Attack on Representation]*

(kk) **Census as Constitutional Infrastructure.** The decennial census and related enumeration activities are hereby designated "Constitutional Infrastructure" entitled to enhanced protection:

(1) obstruction of census operations is a federal felony;

(2) state and Regional officials have affirmative duty to facilitate census operations;

(3) failure to protect census workers is treated as obstruction.

(ll) **Mandatory Administrative Records Sharing.** States and Regions shall provide to the Census Bureau:

(1) birth, death, and marriage records;

(2) driver's license and state ID records;

(3) school enrollment records;

(4) property tax and utility records;

(5) any other administrative records the Bureau determines necessary for enumeration verification.

Privacy protections of subsection (m) apply to Bureau use of such records.

(mm) **Census Obstruction Consequences.** Upon finding by the ARB that a state or Region has systematically obstructed census operations:

(1) the Census Bureau may use statistical estimation to correct for documented undercount;

(2) the obstructing jurisdiction forfeits objection rights to Bureau methodology;

(3) federal formula allocations to the obstructing jurisdiction may be reduced proportionally;

(4) officials responsible for obstruction are personally liable for costs of remedial enumeration;

(5) pattern of census obstruction triggers enhanced monitoring for subsequent census.

(nn) **Anti-Intimidation Provision.** Any person who:

(1) threatens, intimidates, or harms census workers;

(2) disseminates false information designed to suppress census response;

(3) uses official position to discourage census participation

is subject to federal prosecution and civil liability to affected communities.

(oo) **Enumeration Access Rights.** Census workers shall have:

(1) right of access to all residential properties for enumeration purposes;

(2) right to federal law enforcement protection upon request;

(3) right to complete enumeration activities notwithstanding local ordinances;

(4) immunity from state and local prosecution for activities within scope of enumeration duties.

---

### Section 11. Environmental Border Protection

(a) No jurisdiction may externalize environmental harms to other jurisdictions through pollution siting, emissions, discharges, hazardous waste disposal, or land use practices that cause transboundary harm.

(b) Affected jurisdictions may seek injunctive relief, compensatory damages, and remediation orders. The Environmental Protection Agency shall maintain monitoring capacity and enforcement authority.

(c) This section supplements federal environmental laws establishing national minimum standards. Jurisdictions may establish more protective standards provided they do not discriminate against interstate commerce.

(d) Implementation procedures are established by statute. See the [Transboundary Environmental Harm Prevention Act](../../proposals/05-environment-infrastructure/transboundary-environmental-protection-act.md) for the proposed implementing legislation.

#### Cumulative Harm and Shared Ecosystem Protection

(e) **Cumulative Impact Standard.** In addition to bilateral harm under subsection (a), no combination of jurisdictions may collectively cause cumulative environmental harm to shared ecosystems, even if each jurisdiction's individual contribution would be lawful in isolation.

(f) **Shared Ecosystem Designation.** The Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the Water Resources Coordination Board, shall designate "Shared Ecosystems" including but not limited to:

- (1) major river systems and their watersheds (Mississippi, Colorado, Columbia, etc.);
- (2) shared airsheds crossing Regional boundaries;
- (3) migratory wildlife corridors;
- (4) coastal zones and estuaries receiving multi-Regional drainage;
- (5) aquifers underlying multiple Regions.

(g) **Aggregate Impact Limits.** For each Shared Ecosystem, the EPA shall establish:

- (1) science-based "Ecosystem Carrying Capacity" limits for pollutants, withdrawals, and other stressors;
- (2) allocation formulas apportioning the carrying capacity among contributing jurisdictions;
- (3) monitoring protocols to track cumulative impacts in real time.

(h) **Proportional Liability.** When cumulative harm exceeds Ecosystem Carrying Capacity:

- (1) each contributing jurisdiction shall be jointly and severally liable for remediation costs;
- (2) liability shall be apportioned based on each jurisdiction's share of the cumulative impact;
- (3) jurisdictions exceeding their allocated share bear enhanced liability;
- (4) jurisdictions operating below their allocated share may recover contribution from over-polluters.

(i) **Mandatory Remediation Fund.** All jurisdictions contributing to a Shared Ecosystem shall participate in a Shared Ecosystem Remediation Fund:

- (1) contributions shall be proportional to each jurisdiction's use of ecosystem carrying capacity;
- (2) the Fund shall finance remediation when cumulative harm occurs;
- (3) jurisdictions that fail to contribute shall have federal transfers reduced by the unpaid amount plus twenty percent penalty.

(j) **Preemptive Intervention.** When monitoring indicates that a Shared Ecosystem is approaching eighty percent of its Carrying Capacity:

- (1) the EPA shall convene affected jurisdictions for mandatory planning;
- (2) jurisdictions shall submit reduction plans within ninety days;
- (3) failure to submit or implement plans authorizes EPA to impose allocations directly.

### Section 12. Cross-Jurisdictional Law Enforcement Cooperation

(a) Jurisdictions shall cooperate in criminal law enforcement through extradition, hot pursuit, and mutual legal assistance.

(b) Extradition shall be mandatory for serious crimes including violence, harm to minors, fraud, and public corruption. A jurisdiction may decline extradition only where the requesting jurisdiction seeks sentences violating federal rights floors or where the person faces persecution unrelated to the alleged crime.

(c) No jurisdiction may adopt policies designed to shield individuals from lawful prosecution for crimes of violence, fraud, or harm to minors.

(d) Nothing in this section shall require cooperation in enforcement of laws violating federal rights floors, participation in pretextual or politically motivated actions, or diminishment of Tribal sovereignty over criminal matters.

(e) Implementation procedures are established by statute. See the [Interstate Law Enforcement Cooperation Act](../../proposals/06-security-justice/interstate-law-enforcement-cooperation-act.md) for the proposed implementing legislation.

#### Transboundary Legal Comity

(f) **Prohibition on Non-Cooperation Acts.** No Region or State may enact legislation, executive orders, or policies that:

- (1) prohibit Regional or State officials from cooperating with lawful legal process from other jurisdictions;
- (2) create "sanctuary" status shielding individuals or entities from civil or regulatory enforcement by other Regions;
- (3) refuse recognition of judgments, orders, or legal proceedings from other Regions except as provided in subsection (b).

(g) **Civil Judgment Enforcement.** Civil judgments validly entered by courts of one Region shall be enforceable in all other Regions:

- (1) The enforcing Region may not reexamine the merits of the underlying dispute;
- (2) Enforcement may be denied only if the rendering court lacked jurisdiction or the judgment was obtained by fraud;
- (3) A Region may not refuse enforcement based on disagreement with the substantive law applied.

(h) **Regulatory Cooperation Floor.** Regions shall maintain minimum cooperation in regulatory enforcement:

- (1) Subpoenas and document requests from other Regions' regulatory agencies shall be honored within thirty (30) days;
- (2) Witness testimony may be compelled for proceedings in other Regions pursuant to uniform interstate procedures;
- (3) Regulatory cease-and-desist orders shall be given interim recognition pending judicial review.

(i) **Anti-Evasion Provision.** No person or entity may escape civil or regulatory liability by relocating to another Region:

- (1) Liability that accrued in the originating Region remains enforceable regardless of subsequent relocation;
- (2) A Region may not offer "liability haven" status to attract businesses fleeing enforcement in other Regions;
- (3) Patterns of evasion-motivated relocation may be considered evidence of bad faith in subsequent proceedings.

(j) **Limitations on Non-Cooperation.** Notwithstanding subsection (f), a Region may decline cooperation when:

- (1) the requesting Region's law or enforcement action violates Federal Rights Floors;
- (2) cooperation would require violation of the non-cooperating Region's own constitutional protections that exceed federal floors;
- (3) the request is pretextual or politically motivated, as determined by federal court;
- (4) the underlying law criminalizes conduct that is constitutionally protected in the non-cooperating Region.

(k) **Federal Mediation.** When Regions dispute cooperation obligations under this section:

- (1) Either Region may request ARB mediation;
- (2) The ARB shall issue a binding determination within sixty (60) days;
- (3) Persistent non-cooperation after ARB ruling constitutes grounds for fiscal penalties under Article X.

#### Choice of Law for Inter-Regional Conduct

(l) **Lex Loci Delicti Principle.** The legality of conduct shall be determined by the law of the Region where the conduct occurred. Specifically:

- (1) no Region may impose civil liability, penalties, or sanctions on any person for conduct that was lawful in the Region where it was performed;
- (2) no Region may enforce a judgment, order, or award against a person based on conduct that was lawful where performed, except as provided in subsection (n);
- (3) the mere fact that effects of lawful conduct are felt in another Region does not subject the actor to liability under that Region's law.

(m) **Protected Conduct Categories.** This protection applies with particular force to:

- (1) medical procedures lawful where performed;
- (2) commercial transactions lawful where executed;
- (3) speech and expression lawful where uttered or published;
- (4) personal conduct lawful where engaged in; and
- (5) professional services lawful where rendered.

(n) **Exceptions to Lex Loci Protection.** Notwithstanding subsection (l), a Region may regulate or impose liability for conduct performed elsewhere when:

- (1) the conduct constitutes a violation of federal law or federal constitutional rights;
- (2) the conduct was specifically directed at causing harm within the regulating Region and such targeting was the primary purpose of the conduct;
- (3) the actor was domiciled in the regulating Region at the time of conduct and traveled elsewhere specifically to evade that Region's laws, provided such evasion was the primary purpose of travel; or
- (4) the conduct involves contractual obligations with a choice-of-law clause selecting the regulating Region's law.

(o) **Anti-Extraterritorial Enforcement.** No Region may:

- (1) penalize, sanction, or impose liability on persons who assist, facilitate, or provide information about lawful conduct in other Regions;
- (2) require reporting of lawful conduct performed in other Regions;
- (3) condition licenses, permits, or benefits on abstention from conduct that is lawful where performed; or
- (4) create causes of action enabling private enforcement against conduct lawful where performed.

(p) **Judgment Non-Recognition.** A judgment, order, or award based on conduct protected under this section shall not be entitled to full faith and credit and shall not be enforceable in any Region other than the issuing Region. Courts shall refuse recognition of such judgments upon motion of any party.

(q) **Savings Clause.** Nothing in this section shall:

- (1) prevent a Region from regulating the in-Region conduct of its own residents;
- (2) limit federal authority to regulate conduct with interstate effects;
- (3) affect enforcement of judgments for conduct that was unlawful where performed; or
- (4) prevent enforcement of valid contractual choice-of-law provisions.

#### Federal Extradition Enforcement

*Integrated from Gap 180 — closes the extradition standoff by providing federal arrest authority, mandatory federal custody, expedited review, obstruction penalties, officer immunity, and pattern escalation when a Region refuses to surrender a fugitive charged with a serious crime in another Region.*

(r) **Federal Extradition Warrant.** When a Region fails to surrender a fugitive within seventy-two (72) hours of a valid extradition request for a crime enumerated in subsection (b), the requesting Region may petition a Federal Magistrate. Upon a finding that:

- (1) probable cause exists to believe the fugitive committed the charged offense;
- (2) a valid arrest warrant has been issued by the demanding Region;
- (3) the fugitive is present in the asylum Region; and
- (4) the asylum Region has refused, failed, or unreasonably delayed compliance with the extradition request;

the Magistrate shall issue a Federal Extradition Warrant authorizing the United States Marshals Service to arrest the fugitive within any jurisdiction, take exclusive federal custody, and transport the fugitive to the demanding Region. Congress shall establish procedures for execution of Federal Extradition Warrants.

(s) **Custody and Bail.** Upon issuance of a Federal Extradition Warrant:

- (1) the fugitive shall be remanded to exclusive federal custody;
- (2) bail determinations shall be made by the Federal Magistrate under federal standards; no Regional court may release a fugitive subject to a Federal Extradition Warrant;
- (3) the fugitive may challenge the warrant through remote testimony to prevent unnecessary transport if the warrant is deficient on its face; and
- (4) medical fitness for transport shall be determined by a federal medical examiner, not by Regional authorities.

(t) **Expedited Review.** Challenges to extradition under this section shall be adjudicated by the Federal District Court within fourteen (14) days of the fugitive's arrest:

- (1) the asylum Region bears the burden of proving that a defense under subsection (j) applies, by clear and convincing evidence;
- (2) the inquiry is limited to the validity of the extradition request and the applicability of subsection (j) defenses; the underlying guilt or innocence of the fugitive is not at issue;
- (3) the standard for extradition is probable cause on the face of the warrant and supporting affidavit; the asylum Region may not demand trial-level evidence, depositions, expert testimony, or discovery as a precondition; and
- (4) for capital offenses, extradition shall be conditioned on written assurance by the demanding Region's chief prosecutor that the death penalty will not be sought.

(u) **Officer Protection.** Federal and Regional officers executing a valid Federal Extradition Warrant are immune from criminal prosecution and civil liability in the asylum Region for acts reasonably necessary to effect the arrest and transport:

- (1) any Regional or State criminal charges filed against officers executing a Federal Extradition Warrant are preempted and void ab initio;
- (2) civil claims arising from extradition enforcement shall be adjudicated exclusively in federal court; and
- (3) this immunity does not extend to the use of excessive force, which remains subject to federal prosecution.

(v) **Obstruction of Extradition.** It shall be a federal offense for any Regional or State official to:

- (1) actively conceal a fugitive subject to a valid extradition request;
- (2) warn a fugitive of an impending Federal Extradition Warrant or federal enforcement action;
- (3) interfere with the execution of a Federal Extradition Warrant, including ordering Regional law enforcement to impede federal officers;
- (4) release a fugitive from custody to avoid extradition, including release on nominal bail designed to facilitate flight;
- (5) provide resources, funds, or logistical assistance to help a fugitive evade arrest; or
- (6) create procedural requirements exceeding probable cause review for the purpose of delaying or defeating extradition.

Passive non-cooperation after an adverse ARB ruling under subsection (k) constitutes grounds for removal from office. Active obstruction under this subsection is a High Crime subject to federal prosecution.

(w) **Gubernatorial Pardon Limitation and Pattern Non-Compliance.**

- (1) **Pardon Limitation.** A Regional or State Governor's pardon power extends only to offenses against the pardoning sovereign. No pardon, commutation, or grant of clemency by the asylum Region's Governor shall moot, defeat, or delay extradition for offenses committed against the demanding Region. A pardon issued for the purpose of defeating extradition is void.
- (2) **Pattern Non-Compliance.** Upon a judicial finding by the Constitutional Court that a Region has systematically refused lawful extradition requests — defined as three (3) or more adverse federal court rulings on extradition within twelve (12) months — the Court may authorize the Federal Government to assume direct administration of that Region's extradition docket for a period of up to one (1) year, renewable upon continued non-compliance.
- (3) **Hot Pursuit.** Law enforcement officers of one Region may pursue a fleeing felon across Regional boundaries without prior authorization, provided that: (i) pursuit is continuous and commenced within the demanding Region's territory; (ii) the pursuing officers notify the asylum Region's law enforcement at the earliest practicable opportunity; (iii) the fugitive is surrendered to federal or asylum Region custody upon apprehension; and (iv) Congress shall establish uniform procedures governing cross-Regional hot pursuit, including geographic and temporal limitations.

### Section 13. Interstate Compacts

(a) Existing Compacts. All interstate compacts in effect at ratification continue in force unless:

- superseded by Regional agreement among all affected Regions,
- terminated according to their own terms,
- or found to conflict with this Constitution.

(b) State-Level Compacts. Compacts between States within the same Region become matters of Regional law. The Regional legislature may modify or terminate such compacts by statute.

(c) Cross-Regional Compacts. Compacts between States in different Regions continue as interstate compacts. Such compacts may be:

- assumed by the relevant Regions by mutual agreement,
- renegotiated as inter-Regional agreements under Section 5,
- or continued under existing State administration.

(d) Federal-State Compacts. Compacts between the federal government and one or more States continue as federal-Regional compacts, with the relevant Region(s) assuming State obligations.

(e) Compact Agencies. Agencies created by interstate compact (such as port authorities, transit authorities, and river commissions) continue in existence under their existing governance structures unless:

- modified by agreement of all participating jurisdictions,
- or reorganized pursuant to Regional law for agencies operating wholly within one Region.

(f) Compact Review. Within five years of ratification, the Allocation Review Board shall review all existing interstate compacts and issue guidance on their status under this Constitution. This review is advisory; compacts remain in force pending legislative action.

### Section 14. Professional Credential Protection

#### Professional Immunity for Federal Officers

- (C) Award punitive damages against the licensing body;

(3) Pattern of retaliatory licensing triggers federal preemption of that Regional licensing authority;

(4) Individual board members who participate in retaliation are personally liable.

#### Private Sector Cooperation Immunity

(d) **Private Sector Cooperation Immunity.**

(1) No Region or State may suspend, revoke, or condition the professional license of any individual based on cooperation with federal oversight, audits, or investigations;

(2) "Cooperation" includes providing testimony, documents, data, or expert analysis to federal agencies, the ARB, or Constitutional Oversight Bodies;

(3) Regional "ethics rules" prohibiting federal cooperation are preempted and void;

(4) This immunity applies regardless of whether a Regional court order has been obtained.

(e) **Anti-Retaliation for Federal Cooperation.**

(2) "Adverse action" includes termination, demotion, license suspension, ethics charges, and exclusion from professional organizations;

(3) Individuals subject to retaliation may bring federal civil rights claims with treble damages;

(4) Pattern of retaliation triggers federal preemption of the relevant licensing authority.

(f) **Professional Cooperation Duty.**

(1) Licensed professionals have an affirmative duty to cooperate with lawful federal investigations within their area of expertise;

(2) This duty supersedes any conflicting Regional ethics rules;

(3) Failure to cooperate when lawfully requested may be considered in federal proceedings;

(4) Good-faith cooperation provides immunity from Regional civil liability.

#### Shared Provisions

(g) **Definitions and Cross-Application.**

(1) "Professional license" in this section includes all credentials required to practice a profession, including bar membership, medical licenses, engineering certifications, CPA licenses, and professional association memberships;

(2) Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over claims arising under this section;

(3) The federal preemption remedy of subsections (c) and (e) applies when a licensing authority has engaged in two or more retaliatory actions within five years;

(4) Nothing in this section prevents Regional licensing bodies from disciplining professionals for conduct unrelated to federal cooperation.

### Section 15. Appropriations Integrity

*[Gap 232: Appropriations Reprogramming — preventing executive circumvention of congressional spending authority]*

(a) **Appropriations Inviolability.** Funds appropriated by Congress for a specific purpose shall be expended solely for that purpose. No emergency declaration, executive order, or administrative action shall authorize the transfer, reprogramming, or redirection of appropriated funds to any purpose Congress did not authorize in the appropriation.

(b) **Transfer Prohibition.** The President may not transfer, reprogram, or redirect more than 2% of any appropriation account, or $50 million (indexed to inflation), whichever is less, without prior written approval from the Appropriations Committees of both chambers. No emergency declaration shall expand this authority.

(c) **Anti-Impoundment.** The President shall faithfully execute all appropriations. Failure to obligate appropriated funds within 90 days of availability, absent explicit statutory deferral authority, shall constitute an impeachable offense. Any citizen or Member of Congress may seek mandamus in federal court to compel obligation.

(d) **Emergency Spending.** Emergency appropriations shall be made only through a separate emergency appropriation enacted after the emergency declaration. Pre-existing appropriations may not be redirected to emergency purposes. Emergency appropriations shall automatically terminate with the underlying emergency declaration.

(e) **Transparency.** All transfers, reprogrammings, or deferrals exceeding $1 million shall be publicly reported within 48 hours of authorization.

(f) **Enforcement.** The Comptroller General shall have standing to enforce this section. Courts shall award attorney fees to prevailing plaintiffs. Officials who knowingly violate this section shall be personally liable for restoration of funds, plus penalties of 100 to 1,000 FPUs.

---

### Section 16. Ranked Choice Elections (The Majority Mandate)

*[Gap 238: The "Duopoly Trap" — ensuring majority representation through ranked choice voting]*

(a) **Majority Requirement.** No candidate shall be declared elected to any Federal office unless that candidate receives support from a majority (50% + 1) of valid ballots cast in the final round of tabulation.

(b) **Ranked Choice Voting.** To ensure majority support, all Federal elections shall utilize Ranked Choice Voting (Instant Runoff) whereby:

(1) voters rank candidates by preference (first choice, second choice, etc.);

(2) if no candidate achieves a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated;

(3) ballots cast for the eliminated candidate are redistributed to voters' next-ranked choice;

(4) this process repeats until one candidate achieves a majority of remaining active ballots.

(c) **Ballot Exhaustion.** A ballot is "exhausted" and removed from the count only when:

(1) all candidates ranked on that ballot have been eliminated; or

(2) the voter explicitly chose to rank fewer candidates than remain in the count.

Voters shall be encouraged but not required to rank all candidates.

(d) **Multi-Member Districts.** For legislative bodies using multi-member districts:

(1) Single Transferable Vote (STV) shall be used;

(2) the threshold for election shall be calculated by the Droop quota;

(3) surplus votes shall be transferred proportionally to next-ranked candidates.

(e) **Application.** This section applies to:

(1) all elections for President and Vice President (after Regional tallying per Article VII);

(2) all elections for the House of Representatives;

(3) all elections for the Senate;

(4) all Regional elections for offices with Federal significance as defined by Congress.

(f) **Regional Implementation.** Regions shall:

(1) implement ballot designs that clearly explain ranking;

(2) provide voter education on the ranking system;

(3) use tabulation systems certified by the Election Administration Agency;

(4) complete tabulation within 14 days of election day.

(g) **Ballot Integrity.** Physical ballots supporting ranked choice tabulation shall be retained for 22 months and be available for audit. Electronic tabulation systems shall produce paper audit trails showing each round of elimination.

(h) **Transition.** This section takes effect for Federal elections beginning two years after ratification, allowing time for:

(1) voter education campaigns;

(2) ballot redesign and equipment certification;

(3) tabulation system implementation;

(4) training of election officials.

(i) **Primary Elections.** Party primaries for Federal offices:

(1) may use Ranked Choice Voting;

(2) if conducted as open primaries, shall use Ranked Choice Voting;

(3) shall not use FPTP for open primaries selecting candidates for Federal office.

(j) **Prohibition of First-Past-the-Post.** The "winner-take-all" or "first-past-the-post" method, whereby the candidate with the most votes wins regardless of majority support, is hereby prohibited for Federal elections.

---

### Section 17. Ultimate Beneficiary Disclosure

*[Gap 243: The "Dark Money Shell" Gap — preventing foreign influence laundering in elections]*

(a) **Ultimate Beneficial Owner Defined.** For purposes of this section, "Ultimate Beneficial Owner" (UBO) means the natural person who:

(1) ultimately owns or controls, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of an entity; or

(2) exercises substantial control over an entity; or

(3) is the source of funds that an entity contributes to election-related activity.

(b) **Mandatory Disclosure.** Any entity spending money to influence Federal, Regional, or State elections shall disclose:

(1) the identity of all Ultimate Beneficial Owners;

(2) the original source of contributed funds traced to the natural person(s);

(3) the citizenship and country of residence of each UBO;

(4) certification under penalty of perjury that no UBO is a foreign national or foreign-controlled entity.

(c) **Tracing Requirement.** Disclosure shall trace funds through all intermediate entities to their original source. No entity may contribute to election-related spending unless it can demonstrate:

(1) knowledge of the UBO for all contributed funds; or

(2) good-faith procedures to identify UBOs, with immediate return of any contribution whose UBO cannot be verified as a U.S. citizen or permanent resident.

(d) **Prohibited Contributions.** The following are prohibited and subject to immediate forfeiture:

(1) contributions from any entity that cannot identify its Ultimate Beneficial Owners;

(2) contributions where any UBO is a foreign national;

(3) contributions structured to evade beneficial ownership disclosure;

(4) contributions from shell companies, opaque trusts, or intermediary structures designed to obscure the true source of funds.

(e) **Entity Contribution Eligibility.** Entities may contribute to election-related activity only if:

(1) registered with the Federal Election Commission or equivalent Regional authority;

(2) beneficial ownership information filed and publicly available;

(3) annual certification that all contributors/members are U.S. citizens or permanent residents;

(4) agreement to audit upon reasonable suspicion of foreign money.

(f) **Public Database.** The Federal Election Commission shall maintain a publicly searchable database of:

(1) all entities contributing to election-related activity;

(2) Ultimate Beneficial Owners of contributing entities;

(3) contribution amounts and recipients;

(4) updated within 48 hours of any contribution exceeding 100 Federal Penalty Units.

(g) **Penalties.** Violations of this section shall result in:

(1) forfeiture of all contributed funds;

(2) civil penalties of three times the amount contributed in violation;

(3) criminal liability for knowing violations, including conspiracy to evade disclosure;

(4) permanent ban on election-related spending by repeat violators.

(h) **Recipient Liability.** Any campaign, PAC, or political organization that knowingly accepts contributions in violation of this section:

(1) shall forfeit the contribution plus matching amount to the U.S. Treasury;

(2) may not deduct the contribution against contribution limits;

(3) principals may be held personally liable for knowing acceptance.

(i) **No Preemption of Stronger Standards.** Regional and State governments may impose stricter disclosure requirements; this section establishes only the minimum floor.

(j) **501(c)(4) Reform.** Any organization exempt under 26 U.S.C. 501(c)(4) that engages in election-related activity:

(1) shall comply with all disclosure requirements of this section;

(2) shall separately account for election-related spending;

(3) may not shield donor identity for election-related contributions under "social welfare" exemption.

---

### Section 18. Human Rights Exclusivity

*[Gap 244: The "Frankenstein" Loophole — clarifying that constitutional rights belong to natural persons]*

(a) **Natural Persons Defined.** For purposes of this Constitution, the rights of Free Speech, Religion, Conscience, Assembly, Petition, Privacy, and all other rights derived from human dignity, are the exclusive endowment of Natural Persons -- biological human beings.

(b) **Corporations Are Not Persons.** Corporations, limited liability companies, partnerships, trusts, and all other artificial entities:

(1) are creations of law, not nature;

(2) exist by government permission, not inherent right;

(3) possess only those privileges explicitly granted by statute;

(4) do not possess constitutional rights designed to protect human liberty.

(c) **Enumerated Corporate Privileges.** Artificial entities may exercise by statute:

(1) the privilege to contract, sue, and be sued;

(2) the privilege to own property and conduct business;

(3) procedural due process in governmental proceedings affecting their interests;

(4) equal protection against arbitrary discrimination among similarly situated entities.

These are statutory privileges subject to legislative modification, not constitutional rights beyond democratic reach. No statute, ordinance, or other enactment may grant the franchise — the right to vote in any election — to artificial entities; the franchise is reserved exclusively to natural persons as defined in subsection (a).

(d) **Speech Distinction.** The commercial speech of corporations:

(1) is not entitled to the same constitutional protection as individual political speech;

(2) may be regulated for consumer protection, market integrity, and public health;

(3) may not be used to drown out the political speech of natural persons;

(4) in elections may be prohibited, limited, or conditioned as Congress determines appropriate.

(e) **Religious Liberty Limitation.** Corporations may not:

(1) exercise religious beliefs or claim religious exemptions from law;

(2) attribute the religious beliefs of owners to the corporate entity;

(3) discriminate based on religious objections in commercial activity open to the public;

(4) claim exemption from generally applicable laws based on owner religious belief.

The religious freedom of individuals does not extend to the commercial entities they own.

(f) **Political Spending.** Congress and the Regions may:

(1) limit corporate spending in elections;

(2) prohibit corporate contributions to candidates and parties;

(3) require disclosure of corporate political spending;

(4) establish public financing systems that diminish corporate influence.

Such regulations are presumptively constitutional and do not violate corporate "speech rights."

(g) **Privacy Limitation.** Artificial entities:

(1) have no Fourth Amendment rights against reasonable regulatory inspection;

(2) may not claim privacy to shield public health, safety, or environmental compliance records;

(3) may be compelled to produce records and documents without Fifth Amendment privilege;

(4) operate in commerce as a privilege subject to transparency conditions.

(h) **Severability from Owners.** The rights of natural persons who own corporations:

(1) remain fully protected as individuals;

(2) do not extend to the corporate entities they create;

(3) cannot be aggregated through corporate form to magnify individual rights;

(4) cannot be shielded by corporate structure from personal accountability.

(i) **Existing Precedent Overruled.** To the extent inconsistent with this section, the holdings of *Citizens United v. FEC*, *Burwell v. Hobby Lobby*, and all cases treating corporations as constitutional persons are hereby overruled and without force.

---

### Section 19. Discharge Mandate

*[Gap 250: The "One-Man Veto" — preventing leadership obstruction of majority-supported legislation]*

(a) **Right to a Floor Vote.** Any bill or resolution pending before the House of Representatives or the Senate shall receive a floor vote if a majority of the total membership of that chamber petition for such vote.

(b) **Automatic Discharge.**

(1) Upon the filing of a petition signed by a majority of the total membership of a chamber, the bill or resolution shall be automatically discharged from all committees and placed on the calendar for floor consideration.

(2) The discharge shall occur within five (5) legislative days of the petition reaching majority signatures.

(3) No procedural motion, rule, or leadership action may delay or prevent floor consideration of a discharged bill.

(c) **Guaranteed Vote.**

(1) A discharged bill shall receive a floor vote within ten (10) legislative days of discharge.

(2) The vote shall be on final passage of the bill as discharged, with amendments permitted under open rule procedures.

(3) No procedural motion to table, recommit, or postpone may prevent the final passage vote.

(d) **Signature Protection.**

(1) Members may add their signature to a discharge petition at any time.

(2) Signatures may not be withdrawn after the petition reaches majority.

(3) All signatures shall be public and published in the Congressional Record.

(4) No member may be punished by leadership for signing a discharge petition.

(e) **Committee Time Limit.**

(1) Any bill referred to committee shall receive a committee vote within sixty (60) calendar days of referral.

(2) If no committee vote occurs within sixty (60) days, any member may move to discharge the bill without petition.

(3) Such motion shall be privileged and decided by majority vote of the full chamber.

(f) **Leadership Neutrality.**

(1) The Speaker of the House and Majority Leader of the Senate shall schedule all business without regard to whether bills are favored by leadership.

(2) The agenda of each chamber belongs to the chamber as a whole, not to leadership.

(3) Violation of scheduling duties is grounds for removal from leadership position by majority vote.

(g) **Regional Application.** This section applies to all Regional legislatures with appropriate modifications for unicameral bodies.

---

### Section 20. Integrated Borrowing Authority

*[Gap 260: The "Debt Limit" Suicide Vest — eliminating artificial default through unified fiscal authorization]*

(a) **Unified Authorization.** The authorization by Congress to appropriate or obligate funds shall automatically constitute authorization to borrow the necessary funds to meet those obligations.

(1) A separate vote to "increase the debt limit" or "raise the debt ceiling" is prohibited.

(2) When Congress appropriates, it authorizes both spending and the borrowing necessary to execute that spending.

(3) No statute may create a procedural barrier between spending authorization and borrowing authority.

(b) **Principle of Fiscal Integrity.** Congress may not create obligations it refuses to fund. To spend is to commit to pay.

(1) The validity of the public debt shall not be questioned, threatened, or made contingent on unrelated legislative demands.

(2) No legislative procedure may be used to threaten default on existing obligations.

(3) The full faith and credit of the United States is not a bargaining chip.

(c) **Budget Process Integration.** The congressional budget process shall:

(1) consider spending and revenue as an integrated whole;

(2) explicitly address deficit implications of spending decisions at the time of authorization;

(3) not permit spending authorization without acknowledgment of financing requirements.

(d) **Treasury Authority.** If Congress fails to appropriate funds for existing obligations:

(1) the Treasury shall have authority to borrow necessary funds to meet obligations previously authorized by Congress;

(2) this authority extends only to obligations created by prior congressional action;

(3) the Treasury shall report to Congress on any exercise of this authority within fifteen (15) days.

(e) **Prohibition on Default Threats.** No member of Congress or executive official may:

(1) threaten or advocate for default on United States obligations as a negotiating tactic;

(2) condition payment of existing obligations on unrelated legislative demands;

(3) use the credit of the United States as leverage for political objectives.

(f) **Existing Debt Limit Abolished.** The statutory debt limit established by 31 U.S.C. 3101 and any similar provisions are hereby abolished. Borrowing authority flows automatically from spending authorization.

(g) **Deficit Accountability.** To ensure fiscal responsibility without artificial crises:

(1) each appropriation bill shall include an estimate of borrowing required;

(2) members voting for spending implicitly vote for necessary borrowing;

(3) deficit spending remains a political choice, but not a default trigger.

---

### Section 21. Universal Suffrage Guarantee

*[Gap 262: The "Negative Right" Loophole — establishing an affirmative constitutional right to vote]*

(a) **Affirmative Right to Vote.** Every citizen of the United Regions who has attained the age of eighteen years has a fundamental, affirmative right to vote in all Federal, Regional, and local elections.

(1) This right is inherent in citizenship and shall not require application, petition, or government permission beyond proof of citizenship, age, and residency.

(2) This right shall be protected with the same strict scrutiny applied to other fundamental constitutional rights.

(b) **Prohibited Conditions.** The right to vote shall not be abridged, denied, or conditioned upon:

(1) payment of any fee, fine, tax, or financial obligation;

(2) possession of any specific identification document beyond reasonable proof of identity;

(3) completion of any test, course, or educational requirement;

(4) criminal conviction, except during actual incarceration for felony (restored automatically upon release);

(5) failure to vote in previous elections;

(6) residence in any particular type of housing or lack of permanent address;

(7) any disability, physical or mental, that does not prevent expression of voter intent.

(c) **Affirmative Facilitation.** Governments shall affirmatively facilitate the exercise of this right through:

(1) automatic voter registration upon reaching voting age or obtaining citizenship;

(2) same-day registration at any polling place for citizens not previously registered;

(3) multiple methods of voting including in-person, absentee, and mail options;

(4) sufficient polling places and hours to prevent unreasonable wait times;

(5) accessible voting for citizens with disabilities.

(d) **Anti-Dilution.** The right to vote includes the right to an equally weighted vote:

(1) population-based apportionment for all legislative bodies;

(2) prohibition on gerrymandering that dilutes the voting power of any group;

(3) the principle of "one person, one vote" applies to all elections.

(e) **Strict Scrutiny.** Any law that burdens the right to vote:

(1) shall be subject to strict scrutiny;

(2) must serve a compelling governmental interest;

(3) must be narrowly tailored to achieve that interest;

(4) must be the least restrictive means available.

(f) **Private Right of Action.** Any citizen whose voting rights are abridged may:

(1) bring suit in federal court for injunctive relief and damages;

(2) recover attorney fees if successful;

(3) proceed without first exhausting administrative remedies.

(g) **Congressional Enforcement.** Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation, including:

(1) minimum national standards for voter registration and ballot access;

(2) oversight of Regional and local election administration;

(3) penalties for official interference with voting rights.

(h) **Natural Person Exclusivity.** The right to vote in any election — Federal, Regional, State, local, or for any body exercising governmental authority — is held exclusively by natural persons as defined in Section 18(a) of this Article. No Region, State, locality, or other governmental entity may grant, extend, or recognize voting rights to any entity other than a natural person, including but not limited to corporations, limited liability companies, partnerships, trusts, foundations, associations, governmental entities, artificial intelligence systems, algorithms, or automated decision-making entities. Any purported enfranchisement of a non-natural-person entity is void ab initio.

(i) **Prohibition on Weighted Voting.** No election for public office, for the governing body of any entity exercising governmental authority, or any binding public referendum may weight votes by property ownership or value, tax contribution, wealth, income, corporate affiliation, employment status, or any factor other than the principle of one natural person, one equal vote. This subsection applies to all elections described in subsection (a) and to elections for special districts and other bodies described in subsection (j).

(j) **Governmental Authority Bodies.** Any entity that exercises governmental authority — including taxing power, regulatory power, eminent domain, budgetary control over public funds, or the power to issue rules or determinations with binding legal effect — shall be governed exclusively by:

(1) boards or officials elected by the natural person residents of the jurisdiction served; or

(2) boards or officials appointed by and accountable to elected officials who are themselves chosen by natural person suffrage.

No entity exercising governmental authority may be governed by corporate-weighted, property-weighted, or entity-based voting. An entity's characterization as "advisory" does not exempt it from this subsection if its determinations, recommendations, or approvals are required by law, operate as a precondition to governmental action, or are binding in practice.

(k) **Void Elections and Continuity.** Any election conducted in violation of subsections (h), (i), or (j) is void ab initio. Officials seated through such elections hold no lawful authority. Upon a finding of violation, the appointing authority for the jurisdiction shall designate a caretaker pending a lawful election, which shall be held within ninety (90) days. Where no appointing authority exists, the next higher level of government shall appoint the caretaker. The remedies in subsection (f) apply, and Congress may provide additional penalties by law.

### Section 23. Public Interest Defense

*[Gap 264: The "Espionage Trap" — protecting whistleblowers who reveal government misconduct]*

(a) **Affirmative Defense Established.** In any prosecution for unauthorized disclosure of classified or protected government information, it shall be an affirmative defense that:

(1) the disclosure revealed illegal conduct by government officials or agencies;

(2) the disclosure revealed gross mismanagement, waste, fraud, or abuse of authority;

(3) the disclosure revealed a specific and substantial danger to public health, safety, or civil liberties;

(4) the disclosure revealed information the public had a right to know in a functioning democracy.

(b) **Jury Determination.** If the defendant raises the public interest defense:

(1) the defendant may present evidence of the nature and significance of the information disclosed;

(2) the defendant may present evidence of efforts to use internal channels before disclosure;

(3) the jury shall determine whether the public interest served by disclosure outweighs any harm to national security;

(4) if the jury finds the disclosure was in the public interest, the defendant shall be acquitted.

(c) **Balancing Factors.** In evaluating the public interest defense, the jury may consider:

(1) the seriousness of the misconduct revealed;

(2) whether the information was classified to conceal illegal conduct rather than protect legitimate secrets;

(3) whether the defendant made reasonable efforts to minimize harm;

(4) whether the defendant sought to use internal channels first;

(5) whether the information was already partially public;

(6) the nature and extent of any actual harm caused by disclosure.

(d) **Burden of Proof.** Once the defendant raises the public interest defense:

(1) the defendant bears the initial burden of producing evidence supporting the defense;

(2) the government then bears the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the disclosure was not in the public interest;

(3) the government must specifically identify actual harm caused by the disclosure;

(4) speculative or generalized claims of harm are insufficient.

(e) **Classification Review.** In any prosecution under this section:

(1) the court shall review the classification of disclosed materials;

(2) if the court finds information was classified primarily to conceal illegal conduct, the classification is void;

(3) over-classification to prevent accountability is itself official misconduct.

(f) **Whistleblower Protection.** Any person who discloses information covered by subsection (a):

(1) shall not be subjected to adverse employment action;

(2) shall be protected from retaliation by any government agency;

(3) may bring civil action for damages if retaliated against;

(4) shall have access to security-cleared counsel.

(g) **Limitations.** This section does not protect:

(1) disclosure to foreign governments or their agents;

(2) disclosure for personal financial gain;

(3) disclosure of information identifying intelligence sources whose lives would be endangered;

(4) disclosure during time of declared war to entities assisting the enemy.

(h) **Retroactive Application.** This section applies to:

(1) all pending prosecutions;

(2) any person currently incarcerated for disclosure offenses who can establish the public interest defense;

(3) sentence reduction or release shall be available upon showing.

### Section 24. Innovation Supremacy (with Emergency Valve)

*[Gap 267: The "Patent Rebellion" — balancing federal intellectual property supremacy with public health emergency access]*

(a) **Patent Supremacy.** Federal Intellectual Property rights, including patents, copyrights, and trademarks, are supreme and may not be abrogated, impaired, or circumvented by Regional law, regulation, or executive action.

(b) **Prohibition on Regional Override.**

(1) No Region may authorize the manufacture, import, sale, or use of products that infringe valid federal intellectual property rights.

(2) No Region may declare its territory a "patent-free zone" or otherwise suspend federal IP protections.

(3) Regional "public health" authority does not include authority to override federal patents.

(c) **Federal Compulsory Licensing Authority.** Notwithstanding subsection (a), the Federal Government may authorize compulsory licensing of patented inventions when:

(1) a national or regional public health emergency exists involving the patented product;

(2) the patent holder has failed to make the product available at reasonable cost;

(3) compulsory licensing is necessary to address the emergency;

(4) alternative measures (negotiation, importation, government purchase) have been exhausted or would be inadequate.

(d) **Fair Market Compensation.**

(1) Compulsory licensing shall provide fair market compensation to the patent holder.

(2) "Fair market compensation" shall include:

- (A) recovery of research and development costs attributable to the product;
- (B) a reasonable profit margin based on comparable products;
- (C) ongoing royalties during the license period.

(3) The Federal Trade Commission shall establish compensation formulas ensuring patent holders are not impoverished by compulsory licensing.

(4) Disputes over compensation shall be resolved by the Court of Federal Claims.

(e) **Emergency Determination.**

(1) The President may declare a public health emergency qualifying for compulsory licensing.

(2) Congress may declare such emergency by joint resolution.

(3) A Region may petition the Federal Government to declare an emergency affecting that Region.

(4) The declaration shall specify the products covered, the duration, and the geographic scope.

(f) **Petition Process for Regions.**

(1) A Region experiencing a public health crisis may petition the Department of Health and Human Services for compulsory licensing of specific products.

(2) HHS shall respond within sixty (60) days with approval, denial, or alternative remedy.

(3) If approved, the Federal Government shall issue the compulsory license with fair compensation.

(4) If denied, the Region may appeal to the Constitutional Court.

(g) **Non-Commercial Government Use.** The Federal Government may use any patented invention for government purposes without prior authorization, subject to:

(1) reasonable and entire compensation to the patent holder;

(2) limitation to genuine government use, not commercial distribution;

(3) notification to the patent holder within a reasonable time.

(h) **Private Right of Action.** Patent holders may sue Regions that violate this section for:

(1) injunctive relief ordering cessation of infringing activity;

(2) damages for lost sales and market disruption;

(3) attorney fees and costs.

### Section 25. Linguistic Infrastructure

*Resolves Gap 204 — The "Tower of Babel" (Linguistic Fragmentation). Establishes English as the language of record for federal and inter-Regional operations while preserving Regional multilingualism, protecting indigenous language heritage, and ensuring constitutional literacy across generations.*

#### Language of Record

(a) **English as Language of Record.** English is hereby designated the language of record for:

(1) all federal laws, regulations, executive orders, and official acts of the United States;

(2) all proceedings, filings, orders, and judgments of federal courts;

(3) all official acts, records, and judicial proceedings entitled to recognition under the Full Faith and Credit Clause (Section 9(a) of this Article);

(4) all inter-Regional contracts, agreements, and official communications requiring enforcement or recognition across jurisdictional boundaries.

(b) **Controlling Text.** Where a conflict exists between an English-language record and a translation in another language, the English-language record controls.

#### Language of Access

(c) **Translation and Interpretation Services.** Nothing in subsection (a) prohibits any level of government from providing services, communications, or documents in languages other than English. Governments shall provide interpretation and translation services in:

(1) federal and Regional court proceedings, to ensure meaningful participation by non-English-speaking parties, witnesses, and jurors;

(2) emergency services, including law enforcement, fire, medical, and disaster response;

(3) voting and election administration, consistent with applicable rights floors;

(4) access to federal benefits and programs.

(d) **Cost Allocation.** The cost of interpretation and translation for federal services shall be borne by the federal government. For Regional and State services, the cost shall be borne by the serving jurisdiction.

#### Regional Language Autonomy

(e) **Regional Authority Preserved.** Regions retain authority to:

(1) conduct Regional legislative deliberation, executive administration, and internal government operations in any language or combination of languages;

(2) offer public services and education in any language, provided that English instruction sufficient to achieve the constitutional literacy standard of Article II, Section 21(g) is available to all students satisfying compulsory education requirements;

(3) designate additional official languages for Regional purposes.

(f) **English Records for Inter-Regional Purposes.** All Regional statutes, regulations, and judicial records shall be available in English for purposes of Full Faith and Credit recognition, inter-Regional enforcement, and federal judicial review.

#### Non-Suppression of Languages

(g) **Private Language Use Protected.** No level of government may:

(1) prohibit, penalize, or discourage the use of any language in private speech, commerce, worship, or association;

(2) condition employment, licensing, or public benefits on exclusive use of English, except where English proficiency is a documented operational necessity for the specific position;

(3) suppress, defund, or obstruct programs for the preservation or instruction of heritage languages, including indigenous languages, immigrant community languages, and sign languages.

#### Indigenous Language Preservation

(h) **Tribal Language Authority.** Consistent with Article XXIII (Indigenous Sovereignty Preservation):

(1) Indigenous Nations retain full authority to conduct tribal government, education, and cultural activities in tribal languages;

(2) nothing in this Section alters tribal authority over education within tribal jurisdictions;

(3) tribal citizens seeking federal credentials, federal employment, or recognition of diplomas outside tribal jurisdiction shall demonstrate English literacy through the National Civic Competency Assessment under Article II, Section 21(g).

#### Inter-Regional Professional Practice

(i) **English Proficiency as Universal Baseline.** English proficiency sufficient for inter-Regional professional communication constitutes a universal baseline for credential portability under Section 9 of this Article, and is not a supplementary or Region-specific requirement subject to the limitations of Section 9(h)-(i).

(b) United States territories are not assigned to any Region upon ratification. Their Regional assignment shall be determined pursuant to Article XX, Section 2(a).

(c) Tribal lands within State boundaries remain under tribal and federal jurisdiction as provided in Article XX, Section 3.

(d) These initial boundaries are based on geographic, economic, and demographic considerations as of ratification. Future boundary revisions shall follow the process established in Article I, Section 4.

(e) Population and Fiscal Capacity Considerations.

(1) Regions vary substantially in population. As of ratification, approximate populations are:

- Northeast: 60 million
- Southeast: 75 million
- Midwest: 52 million
- Great Plains: 14 million
- Southwest: 52 million
- Pacific: 55 million
- Mountain: 3 million

(2) Population disparity is an intentional feature of this Constitution, not a defect. Regions are defined by geographic, economic, and cultural coherence, not population equality.

(3) Small-population Regions are protected by:

- equal representation in the Senate,
- equalization transfers ensuring baseline fiscal capacity (Article X, Section 3),
- the boundary revision process, which allows but does not compel merger (Article I, Section 4),
- inter-Regional cooperation agreements permitting shared institutions (Article I, Section 5).

(4) Small Regions may petition for boundary revision to join an adjacent Region, but may not be compelled to merge.

(f) Minimum Regional Capacity.

(1) Each Region must maintain minimum institutional capacity to:

- administer elections,
- operate Regional courts,
- maintain Regional Guard Forces,
- participate in Senate representation.

(2) If a Region's population falls below one-half of one percent of the total population of the United States, or if a Region demonstrates inability to maintain minimum institutional capacity, the Independent Boundary Review Commission shall conduct a special review within one year and may recommend:

- merger with an adjacent Region,
- enhanced inter-Regional cooperation agreements,
- federal technical assistance.

(3) Any merger recommendation under this subsection requires the same approval process as other boundary revisions under Article I, Section 4.
