## ARTICLE II - ALLOCATION OF POWERS

### Section 1. Enumerated Federal Powers

Federal authority is limited to powers expressly enumerated herein, including:

- national defense and armed forces,
- foreign affairs and treaties,
- currency and monetary policy,
- immigration and citizenship,
- enforcement of constitutional rights floors,
- maintenance of a national common market,
- national benefits floor,
- emergency powers as strictly limited by this Constitution.

All powers not enumerated are denied.

### Section 2. Enumerated Regional Powers

Regions shall have exclusive authority over:

- inter-state infrastructure and transportation corridors,
- Regional labor standards above federal floors,
- housing coordination and supply targets,
- energy generation and transmission planning,
- public health coordination,
- environmental regulation above federal floors,
- Regional economic development consistent with anti-dumping rules.

---

### Section 3. State and Local Powers

States retain authority over:

- education,
- criminal and civil law,
- policing structure,
- land use frameworks,
- local government law.

Local governments retain authority over implementation and service delivery.

---

### Section 4. Non-Concurrency Rule

Powers shall be exclusive to the level to which they are assigned unless this Constitution explicitly authorizes shared jurisdiction.

---

## ARTICLE III - RIGHTS FLOORS AND SUBSIDIARITY

### Section 1. Floors, Not Ceilings

Federal rights and standards establish minimum protections only.

No federal law shall be interpreted to prohibit a Region or State from exceeding such protections unless explicitly stated.

---

### Section 2. Subsidiarity with Enforcement

Authority resides at the lowest level capable of exercising it effectively, subject to judicial enforcement of constitutional boundaries.

---

### Section 3. Hierarchy of Law

(a) This Constitution is the supreme law of the United States.

(b) Within their respective spheres:

- Federal law enacted pursuant to enumerated federal powers is supreme over conflicting Regional, State, or local law.
- Regional law enacted pursuant to enumerated Regional powers is supreme over conflicting State or local law within the Region.
- State law is supreme over conflicting local law within the State.

(c) State Constitutions.

(1) State constitutions may not conflict with this Constitution or with the Regional constitution of the Region in which the State is located.

(2) State constitutions may establish protections exceeding those in the Regional or federal constitutions (floors, not ceilings).

(3) In case of conflict between a State constitution and a Regional constitution:

- the Regional constitution prevails on matters within enumerated Regional powers,
- the State constitution prevails on matters within reserved State powers,
- disputes shall be resolved by the Allocation Review Board, with appeal to the Supreme Court.

(d) Local Charters. Local government charters and ordinances are subordinate to State law and may not conflict with State, Regional, or federal law.

(e) Pre-Ratification State Law. State law in effect at ratification continues in force unless:

- inconsistent with this Constitution,
- superseded by Regional law on matters transferred to Regional authority,
- or repealed by the State.

## Design Rationale

### Why Exclusive Rather Than Concurrent Powers?

Traditional federalism allows concurrent jurisdiction, creating ambiguity exploited by both levels of government. The non-concurrency rule:

- prevents federal "creeping preemption" of Regional/State authority
- prevents Regions from obstructing federal enumerated powers
- creates clear lines for judicial enforcement
- reduces intergovernmental conflict

### Why Rights Floors Rather Than Uniform Rights?

Uniform national rights prevent Regional policy variation and force national political battles over every rights question. Rights floors:

- establish minimum protections everywhere
- allow Regions to exceed minimums based on local preferences
- reduce political stakes of federal elections
- preserve policy diversity

### Why Subsidiarity?

Centralized authority creates:

- democratic distance (voters far from decision-makers)
- one-size-fits-all policies for diverse populations
- winner-take-all political dynamics
- authoritarian consolidation risk

Subsidiarity keeps decisions close to affected populations while ensuring baseline protections through judicial enforcement.
