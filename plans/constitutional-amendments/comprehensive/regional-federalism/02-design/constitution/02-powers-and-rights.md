---

### Section 1(e). Domain Classification

(1) **Exclusive Federal Domains.** The following domains are exclusively federal, and no Regional or State law may operate within them:

- (i) National defense and armed forces;
- (ii) Foreign affairs, treaties, and diplomacy;
- (iii) Currency, monetary policy, and central banking;
- (iv) Immigration and naturalization;
- (v) Postal service and interstate telecommunications infrastructure;
- (vi) Intellectual property (patents, copyrights, trademarks);
- (vii) Space and orbit — the regulation of orbital mechanics, space launch, extra-atmospheric activities, and celestial bodies.

(2) **Exclusive Regional Domains.** The following domains are exclusively Regional, and no Federal or State law may operate within them except as specifically enumerated:

- (i) K-12 education curriculum and standards, except as provided in Section 21 of this Article;
- (ii) Land use, zoning, and local planning;
- (iii) State and local government structure;
- (iv) Family law (marriage, divorce, custody, adoption);
- (v) Intraregional transportation infrastructure.

(3) **Structured Concurrent Domains.** The following domains are inherently cross-cutting and shall be governed by the Concurrent Authority Framework:

- (i) Healthcare delivery and insurance;
- (ii) Environmental protection and climate;
- (iii) Labor standards and workplace safety;
- (iv) Housing policy and fair housing;
- (v) Higher education and workforce development;
- (vi) Criminal justice and policing;
- (vii) Energy production and distribution;
- (viii) Public health and disease control.

(4) **Classification Review.** The Allocation Review Board shall review domain classifications every ten years and recommend reclassifications to Congress and the Regional Assemblies:

- (i) ARB recommendations have no legal effect absent legislative action by Congress and ratification by a majority of Regional Assemblies;
- (ii) Failure of Congress or the Regions to act on a recommendation does not alter existing classifications;
- (iii) No domain may be reclassified by judicial interpretation; reclassification requires the legislative process specified herein.

### Section 1(f). Federal Enforcement Operational Immunity

*Resolves Gap 135 — Regional "Licensing" of Federal Operations.*

(f) **Federal Enforcement Operational Immunity.**

- (1) **Credential Supremacy.** No Region or State may require any license, permit, certification, registration, insurance, training, or fee — however denominated — as a condition for federal officers, employees, contractors, or consultants authorized by a federal agency to perform duties pursuant to an enumerated federal power, a constitutional rights floor, or the authority of a Constitutional Oversight Body. This immunity extends to ancillary services necessary for the performance of federal duties, including transportation, equipment operation, laboratory analysis, and technical support. Federal credentials shall be deemed sufficient for all operational purposes within any Region. This subsection applies to personnel acting under direct federal authority; it does not extend to state or local officers except when formally deputized by a federal agency for specific federal enforcement operations.
- (2) **Obstruction Identification.** The Allocation Review Board may identify any Regional or State licensing, permitting, or regulatory requirement as "Federal Operation Obstruction" if the requirement: (A) applies uniquely or disproportionately to personnel performing federal enforcement functions; (B) has the practical effect of preventing, delaying, or materially impeding federal enforcement within the Region, regardless of its facial neutrality; or (C) was enacted, amended, or applied in response to anticipated or ongoing federal enforcement activity, as evidenced by legislative history, temporal proximity to federal action, or selective application. These criteria are disjunctive; satisfaction of any one is sufficient. Upon an obstruction identification, the requirement is immediately suspended as applied to federal personnel. The affected Region may petition the Constitutional Court for review within fourteen (14) days; during review, the suspension remains in effect.
- (3) **Non-Obstruction Duty.** No Region shall impede federal enforcement of constitutional rights floors or the operations of Constitutional Oversight Bodies through licensing, permitting, zoning, inspection, technical requirements, equipment standards, or other administrative requirements. Regional officials who knowingly impose administrative barriers to federal enforcement are subject to federal civil liability under the enforcement provisions of Article III, Section 2. Federal agencies may establish field offices, deploy personnel, and conduct authorized operations within any Region without Regional administrative approval, subject to compliance with generally applicable building, fire, and safety codes that are (i) neutral in purpose and effect, (ii) narrowly tailored to legitimate safety objectives, and (iii) not applied to materially impede federal operations or selectively enforced against federal facilities.
- (4) **Pattern Obstruction.** If the ARB identifies two (2) or more instances of Federal Operation Obstruction by a single Region within any five (5) year period, the Region's licensing authority over the affected professional categories is suspended as applied to all federal enforcement operations until the ARB certifies that the Region has adopted structural reforms sufficient to prevent recurrence. During suspension, federal agencies may conduct enforcement operations within the Region without regard to Regional licensing requirements in the affected categories. The Region may petition the Constitutional Court for review of the pattern finding.
- (5) **Limitations.** (A) This subsection protects operational authority; it does not exempt federal personnel from generally applicable criminal law, tort liability, or professional ethics standards unrelated to licensing for enforcement operations. (B) This subsection does not affect the professional credential protections of Article I-RF, Section 14, which operate independently and protect personal professional standing. Operational immunity under this subsection governs the authority to act within a Region; Section 14 governs personal professional standing. Where conduct implicates both operational authority and personal credentials, both provisions apply independently to their respective domains. (C) Nothing in this subsection authorizes federal personnel to exceed the scope of their lawful federal authority.
- (6) **Interaction with Mutual Recognition.** This subsection addresses federal enforcement operations and is independent of the mutual recognition framework of Article I-RF, Section 9, which governs inter-Regional credential portability. Where both frameworks apply, the more protective provision governs.

### Section 2. Enumerated Regional Powers

Regions shall have exclusive authority over:

- inter-state infrastructure and transportation corridors,
- Regional labor standards above federal floors,
- housing coordination and supply targets,
- energy generation and transmission planning,
- public health coordination,
- environmental regulation above federal floors,
- Regional economic development consistent with anti-dumping rules.

---

### Section 3. State and Local Powers

States retain authority over:

- education,
- criminal and civil law,
- policing structure,
- land use frameworks,
- local government law.

Local governments retain authority over implementation and service delivery.

---

### Section 3-A. Rights Floor Enforcement Constraints

(a) **Rights Floor Authority.** Congress may enforce minimum protections against Regional abridgment only where:

- (i) The right is explicitly enumerated in this Constitution or its amendments; OR
- (ii) The right has been established by constitutional amendment ratified after the effective date of this Section; OR
- (iii) The right has been established through the Dual-Legitimacy Rights-Floor process of Article III, Section 10.

(b) **No Implied Rights Floors.** Congress may not claim enforcement authority based on:

- (i) Penumbral reasoning from enumerated rights;
- (ii) Substantive due process doctrine;
- (iii) General welfare, commerce, or spending power rationales recharacterized as rights enforcement; OR
- (iv) International treaty obligations not separately ratified as constitutional amendments.

(c) **Enforcement Prerequisites.** Before exercising rights floor enforcement authority, Congress shall:

- (i) **Identify the enumerated right** by specific textual citation;
- (ii) **Document Regional violation** with specific findings of fact, including identification of the Regional law, policy, or practice alleged to violate the floor;
- (iii) **Demonstrate necessity** showing that judicial remedies are inadequate to protect the enumerated right; AND
- (iv) **Publish the evidentiary record** supporting enforcement in its entirety within 30 days of enactment, subject only to narrowly tailored national security redactions. Redacted material shall be provided in full to reviewing courts under seal.

(d) **Judicial Review.** Any exercise of rights floor enforcement authority shall be subject to de novo judicial review. Courts shall apply no deference to congressional characterization of:

- (i) Whether the asserted right is enumerated;
- (ii) Whether Regional action violates the floor; OR
- (iii) Whether judicial remedies are inadequate.

(e) **Pretext Analysis.** Courts shall invalidate enforcement actions where:

- (i) The stated rights justification is pretextual;
- (ii) The enforcement mechanism bears no rational relationship to protecting the enumerated right; OR
- (iii) The enforcement imposes burdens on Regional authority disproportionate to any plausible rights-protective benefit.

A rebuttable presumption of pretext arises where enforcement targets Regional policies that Congress has previously sought to override through ordinary legislation.

(f) **Individual Litigation Unaffected.** Nothing in this Section limits the ability of individuals to seek judicial relief for violations of constitutional rights, nor the authority of courts to grant such relief in individual cases. This Section constrains only congressional claims of enforcement authority under enabling clauses.

---

### Section 3-B. Sub-Unit Cooperation Protection

*Resolves Gap 139 — State-Level "Abolition" of Cooperating Sub-units.*

(a) **Project Continuity Protection.**

- (1) When a sub-Regional unit — including any municipality, county, township, special district, or other local government entity — enters into a formal coordination agreement for a project within a Regional Exclusive Domain or Cooperative Implementation domain, the unit may register the agreement with the Allocation Review Board. Registration requires: (A) a copy of the executed coordination agreement; (B) identification of the project and the Regional authority under which it is undertaken; (C) identification of the local governmental functions having a direct and proximate nexus to project implementation; and (D) written notice to the State in which the unit is located, provided at least fourteen (14) days before registration.
- (2) **Interim Protection.** Protection under this section attaches upon delivery of written notice to the State under paragraph (1)(D), not upon ARB registration. From the date of notice delivery until ARB registration or denial, the State may not take any action described in subsection (b)(1) with respect to the notified unit. A State action taken against a sub-Regional unit within ninety (90) days before the unit delivers notice under paragraph (1)(D) is presumed retaliatory and subject to review under subsection (b)(4); the State may rebut this presumption by clear and convincing evidence that the action was initiated before the coordination agreement was contemplated.
- (3) Upon registration, the sub-Regional unit's legal existence and the governmental functions identified in the registration as having a direct and proximate nexus to project implementation are protected under this section. Protection does not extend to governmental functions unrelated to the registered project.
- (4) Protection continues until the earliest of: (A) completion of the project; (B) mutual termination of the coordination agreement by the sub-Regional unit and the Region; (C) deregistration by the ARB under subsection (c)(3); or (D) ARB approval of a State restructuring that ensures project continuity under subsection (b)(3).
- (5) Registration is ministerial; the ARB shall register any agreement that meets the requirements of paragraph (1) within thirty (30) days. The ARB may not refuse registration based on the merits of the underlying project or the desirability of the coordination agreement. However, the ARB shall review whether the governmental functions identified under paragraph (1)(C) have a direct and proximate nexus to project implementation and may narrow the scope of protected functions to those satisfying this standard. The State may challenge a registration within ninety (90) days of registration on the ground that the coordination agreement is a sham or that the registration was procured by fraud. The ARB shall rule on such challenges within sixty (60) days.

(b) **Prohibited State Actions.**

- (1) During the protection period, the State in which the protected unit is located may not, without ARB approval: (A) dissolve, merge, or consolidate the protected unit; (B) revoke or materially alter the unit's home rule authority, charter, or enabling statute insofar as the alteration would impair the unit's capacity to perform its obligations under the coordination agreement; (C) transfer functions necessary for project implementation from the protected unit to a State agency or different local entity; (D) impose mandates, conditions, or restrictions that have the practical effect of preventing or materially impeding project implementation, regardless of facial neutrality; or (E) create or expand a parallel governmental entity with overlapping regulatory, permitting, or veto authority over the protected unit's project-related functions, where the practical effect is to nullify or circumvent the protected unit's capacity to implement the coordination agreement.
- (2) State actions that fall within paragraph (1) are suspended as applied to the protected project. The protected unit's legal existence and project-related authority continue notwithstanding any State law, order, or administrative action to the contrary. Suspension under this paragraph does not affect the State action's validity as applied to governmental functions unrelated to the protected project.
- (3) **Legitimate Restructuring.** A State may petition the ARB for approval to restructure a protected unit. The ARB shall grant the petition if the State demonstrates that: (A) the restructuring would have been undertaken regardless of the Regional project, as evidenced by a documented record of the restructuring rationale predating the coordination agreement or arising from circumstances unrelated to Regional cooperation; (B) the successor entity will assume all obligations under the coordination agreement through a binding written commitment filed with the ARB as a condition of approval, with equivalent or superior institutional capacity to perform the protected functions — and where the successor entity lacks equivalent capacity, the State shall provide supplemental resources, personnel, or technical assistance sufficient to ensure equivalent capacity; and (C) the restructuring will not materially impair or delay project implementation. The ARB shall act on restructuring petitions within sixty (60) days. Approval may include conditions ensuring project continuity. The binding successor commitment filed under this paragraph is enforceable by the Region directly against the successor entity and the State.
- (4) The ARB shall determine whether a State action constitutes prohibited interference under paragraph (1). The determination shall be based on the practical effect of the State action, regardless of its stated purpose or facial neutrality. The criteria of paragraph (1)(A)-(E) are disjunctive; satisfaction of any one is sufficient. Temporal proximity between the State action and the coordination agreement or project milestones constitutes evidence of prohibited purpose.

(c) **Successor Liability, Enforcement, and Deregistration.**

- (1) If a State takes action prohibited under subsection (b) without ARB approval, or in violation of conditions imposed by the ARB: (A) any successor entity — including State agencies, newly created districts, or merged entities — assumes all obligations of the dissolved or restructured unit under the coordination agreement, and where the successor entity lacks the institutional capacity to perform the protected functions, the State shall provide the resources, personnel, and technical assistance necessary to ensure equivalent capacity; (B) the Region may enforce the coordination agreement directly against the State; (C) the State is liable for all project delays and additional costs attributable to the prohibited action; and (D) cost recovery shall follow the procedures of Section 4(n) of this Article, including the fifteen percent (15%) administrative surcharge.
- (2) **State Bad Faith Finding.** If the ARB determines that a State has taken prohibited action under subsection (b) on two (2) or more occasions within any five (5) year period — whether involving the same or different sub-Regional units — or that a single prohibited action has impacted two (2) or more registered projects, the ARB may issue a State Bad Faith Finding. Upon issuance: (A) the State's participation in Regional governance advisory bodies is suspended for the duration of the finding; (B) all coordination agreements registered by sub-Regional units within that State receive enhanced protection, requiring a two-thirds (2/3) supermajority of the ARB for approval of any State restructuring petition under subsection (b)(3) for the duration of the finding; (C) the finding is subject to judicial review by the Constitutional Court upon petition within thirty (30) days; and (D) the finding may be lifted when the ARB certifies that the State has adopted structural reforms sufficient to prevent recurrence, including legislation or constitutional amendments protecting local government cooperation with Regional projects. If a second State Bad Faith Finding is issued within ten (10) years of a prior finding, the ARB may recommend reclassification of the affected project domains from Cooperative Implementation to Regional Exclusive Domain under the procedures of Article II-RF, Section 2, removing State implementation discretion entirely.
- (3) **Deregistration.** The ARB may deregister a coordination agreement upon finding that: (A) the project has been abandoned by the Region or the sub-Regional unit; or (B) the sub-Regional unit has materially breached the coordination agreement, provided that the breach was not caused or substantially contributed to by State action prohibited under subsection (b). Before deregistration for breach, the ARB shall provide the sub-Regional unit with written notice specifying the breach and a ninety (90) day cure period. Where the alleged breach results from State interference — including funding reductions, staffing restrictions, or regulatory burdens imposed on the sub-Regional unit — the breach shall be attributed to the State rather than the sub-Regional unit, and the State's action shall be evaluated under subsection (b).
- (4) **Interaction with Local Government Obstruction.** This section addresses State interference with cooperating sub-units and is complementary to Section 4(l), which addresses local refusal to cooperate. Where a State dissolves a cooperating unit and the successor unit ceases cooperation, the State action shall be treated as prohibited interference under subsection (b), and the State remains responsible for project implementation under Section 4(l)(1)-(2). The protections established by this section constitute the Local Autonomy Floor referenced in Section 4(l).

(d) **Transition.**

- (1) Sub-Regional units that have entered into coordination agreements before the ratification of this section may register such agreements under subsection (a) within one hundred eighty (180) days of ratification. Interim protection under subsection (a)(2) applies from the date of notice delivery under the registration process.
- (2) State restructuring actions completed before the ratification of this section are not subject to review under this section, but obligations under coordination agreements that survived such restructuring may be registered and protected prospectively.

### Section 4. Concurrent Authority Framework

(a) **Federal Floor, Regional Ceiling.** In Structured Concurrent Domains:

- (i) Congress may establish minimum standards ("floors") applicable nationwide;
- (ii) Regions may exceed federal floors within their territory;
- (iii) Regions may not fall below federal floors;
- (iv) Federal floors require three-fifths vote in both houses and certification by the ARB that the floor addresses genuine cross-regional spillover.

(b) **Regional Primary Authority.** Within Structured Concurrent Domains:

- (i) Regions have primary regulatory authority;
- (ii) Federal authority is limited to establishing floors, not comprehensive regulation;
- (iii) Federal enforcement operates only when Regional enforcement fails.

(c) **Spillover Trigger.** Federal floor authority may be exercised only upon ARB certification that:

- (i) The problem addressed has documented cross-regional effects;
- (ii) Regional action alone cannot adequately address the spillover;
- (iii) The proposed floor is the minimum necessary to address the spillover;
- (iv) The floor does not prescribe specific means, only outcomes.

(c-1) **ARB Role Limitation.** In certifying spillover and necessity under subsection (c), the ARB shall not evaluate the wisdom, desirability, or policy merits of the proposed floor, but only whether the constitutional criteria for federal floor authority are satisfied.

(d) **Automatic Sunset.** Federal floors in Structured Concurrent Domains:

- (i) Expire after ten years unless reauthorized;
- (ii) May be reauthorized by simple majority upon ARB certification that spillover conditions persist;
- (iii) Shall be reviewed by the ARB at years 5 and 8 with public report on continued necessity.

(e) **Regional Variance.** A Region may petition for variance from a federal floor upon demonstrating:

- (i) An alternative approach that achieves equivalent spillover mitigation;
- (ii) The variance will not export harms to other Regions;
- (iii) Approval by ARB, which shall issue variance within 90 days or state reasons for denial.

(f) **Accountability Labeling.**

(1) **Federal Responsibility Statement.** Federal floors in Structured Concurrent Domains shall include a Responsibility Statement identifying:

- (i) which outcomes are federally guaranteed;
- (ii) which implementation choices are delegated to Regions.

(2) **Regional Compliance Statement.** Regional legislation in Structured Concurrent Domains shall include a Compliance Statement identifying:

- (i) which provisions implement federal floor requirements;
- (ii) which provisions exceed federal floors as Regional policy choices;
- (iii) which implementation methods were selected by the Region from among permissible alternatives.

(3) **Specificity Requirement.** Responsibility Statements and Compliance Statements shall be sufficiently specific to permit a reasonable reader to distinguish mandated requirements from discretionary policy choices.

(4) **Effect of Non-Compliance.** Failure to include required Statements:

- (i) does not invalidate the underlying legislation;
- (ii) creates rebuttable presumption that challenged provisions are discretionary Regional choices for purposes of accountability;
- (iii) may be cured by amendment at any time.

(g) **Non-Concurrent Domains.** Powers in Exclusive Federal Domains and Exclusive Regional Domains (as defined in Section 1(e)) shall be exclusive to the level to which they are assigned unless this Constitution explicitly authorizes shared jurisdiction.

#### Constitutional Labor and Safety Minimums

*Resolves Gap 185 — The "Race to the Bottom" (Deregulation Trap). Establishes permanent constitutional minimums for labor and workplace safety within the Structured Concurrent Domain framework, preventing Regions from competing through exploitative conditions while preserving Regional authority over standards above the floor.*

(h) **Constitutional Labor Minimums.** Regardless of congressional action under subsection (a), the following standards are fundamental to the economic union and shall not be infringed by any Region:

- (1) **Forced Labor.** No person shall be compelled to perform labor through physical coercion, debt bondage, confiscation of identity documents, or threat of penalty. Prison labor utilized for commercial competitive advantage in interstate commerce — including goods produced by incarcerated persons at compensation below the subsistence floor established in paragraph (3) — is prohibited.
- (2) **Child Labor.** Commercial employment of persons under the age of sixteen (16) that interferes with compulsory education or endangers health, safety, or development is prohibited. This prohibition applies regardless of whether the arrangement is characterized as "apprenticeship," "vocational training," "internship," or any other designation.
- (3) **Subsistence Wage.** Every worker shall receive compensation sufficient for basic subsistence. The Independent Fiscal Council shall determine and publish annually a Regional Subsistence Floor for each Region, indexed to Regional cost of living. No worker may receive compensation that, for the hours worked, falls below the applicable Regional Subsistence Floor.
- (4) **Imminent Hazard.** Every worker has the right to refuse work that presents an imminent danger of death or serious physical harm without retaliation. Regions shall maintain workplace safety standards sufficient to prevent conditions of imminent danger. For transboundary environmental hazards arising from production, Article I, Section 11 (Environmental Border Protection) applies.

(i) **Anti-Circumvention.** The standards of subsection (h) apply to all human labor performed for economic compensation within the territorial jurisdiction of a Region.

- (1) **Universal Territorial Application.** No Region may exempt any geographic zone, special economic district, enterprise zone, or enclave from the standards of subsection (h).
- (2) **Functional Worker Definition.** For purposes of this section, "worker" means any natural person who performs labor or services for economic compensation. Whether an individual is a "worker" shall be determined by the economic reality of the relationship — including economic dependence on the hiring entity, degree of control exercised (including through algorithmic direction or platform management), integration into the hiring entity's business operations, and absence of genuine entrepreneurial independence — regardless of labels such as "independent contractor," "partner," "platform participant," "apprentice," "student," or any other designation.
- (3) **No Waiver.** Rights under subsection (h) are inalienable and may not be waived by contract, collective bargaining agreement, or any other instrument. A "voluntary" agreement to accept compensation below the Subsistence Floor or to work in conditions of imminent danger is void.
- (4) **Supply Chain Accountability.** Entities exercising effective control over the conditions of work — including through supply chain management, subcontracting arrangements, franchise agreements, or algorithmic direction of work — share liability for violations of subsection (h) committed by entities under their effective control.

(j) **Social Dumping Prohibition.** Economic competition based on labor conditions below the standards of subsection (h) constitutes cross-regional spillover for purposes of subsection (c).

- (1) **Rebuttable Presumption.** A Region maintaining labor standards materially below the Constitutional Minimums of subsection (h) is rebuttably presumed to be externalizing costs to other Regions through the economic displacement of industries operating under lawful standards.
- (2) **Commerce Authority.** Congress may prohibit the entry into interstate commerce of goods or services produced in violation of the standards of subsection (h). This authority is in addition to, and does not limit, the federal floor authority under subsection (a).
- (3) **Cross-Reference.** For transboundary environmental harms arising from production processes, Article I, Section 11 provides comprehensive protection. This subsection addresses the labor dimension of interstate regulatory competition; Article I, Section 11 addresses the environmental dimension.

(k) **Enforcement and Permanence.**

- (1) **Permanence.** The standards of subsection (h) are permanent provisions of this Constitution. They are not subject to the sunset provisions of subsection (d), the variance provisions of subsection (e), or any other mechanism that would permit their reduction or suspension.
- (2) **Federal Backstop.** Federal enforcement authority under subsection (b)(iii) applies when Regional enforcement of subsection (h) standards fails. The federal government may conduct inspections, issue citations, and impose penalties for violations of Constitutional Labor Minimums.
- (3) **Private Right of Action.** Any worker aggrieved by a violation of subsection (h) may bring suit in federal court for compensatory damages, injunctive relief, and reasonable attorney fees. Any business in interstate commerce that suffers competitive harm from a competitor's violation of subsection (h) may bring suit in federal court for injunctive relief and actual damages.
- (4) **IFC Monitoring.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall publish an annual Labor Standards Compliance Report assessing each Region's compliance with subsection (h) and with any congressional floors established under subsection (a). The report shall identify Regions with standards materially below national averages and assess the interstate competitive effects.
- (5) **Relationship to Congressional Floors.** Congressional floors established under subsection (a) for labor standards and workplace safety operate above the Constitutional Minimums of subsection (h). The variance provisions of subsection (e), sunset provisions of subsection (d), and accountability labeling provisions of subsection (f) continue to apply to congressional floors. Constitutional Minimums are the permanent, non-waivable base layer; congressional floors are the adjustable standards above that base.

#### Critical Infrastructure Interoperability

*Resolves Gap 92 — "Technical Standards" as de facto Secession, and Gap 116 — "Administrative Veto" via Technical Standard-Setting. Establishes a permanent infrastructure interoperability mandate within the Concurrent Authority Framework, preventing Regions from achieving functional secession through engineering incompatibility while preserving Regional authority to innovate above federal floors.*

(l) **Infrastructure Interoperability Mandate.** No Region may adopt, implement, or maintain technical, engineering, or operational standards for Critical Infrastructure that create a material barrier to:

- (1) the transit of energy across Regional boundaries, including generation, transmission, and distribution interconnection;
- (2) the movement of goods via rail, road, waterway, or pipeline, including signaling, gauge, and safety system compatibility;
- (3) the portability of digital credentials, professional licenses, and identity verification systems across Regional boundaries;
- (4) the interconnection of telecommunications, data, and emergency communications networks.

(m) **Critical Infrastructure Definition.** For purposes of this section, "Critical Infrastructure" means:

- (1) electric power generation, transmission, and distribution systems, including interconnection hardware and load-balancing protocols;
- (2) rail networks, signaling systems, and rolling stock compatibility standards;
- (3) major highways, bridges, tunnels, and their tolling, signaling, and safety systems;
- (4) digital identity, payment, credentialing, and verification systems used by governmental entities or required for access to public services;
- (5) telecommunications, internet, and emergency communications networks;
- (6) pipeline systems for energy, water, or other bulk commodity transport.

The Department of Commerce, acting through the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), in consultation with the ARB, may add categories to this definition by regulation when new infrastructure types with cross-Regional interconnection significance emerge. No category may be removed except by constitutional amendment.

(n) **Material Barrier Standard.** A "material barrier" exists when any of the following conditions is met:

- (1) technical incompatibility requires conversion equipment, transloading, or reformatting processes at or near Regional boundaries that would not be required for the same transit within the Region;
- (2) the cost of conversion, adaptation, or compliance with Regional standards exceeds five percent (5%) of the value of the goods, services, or energy in transit;
- (3) technical differences impose delay exceeding the following thresholds, measured against equivalent transit within the Region:
    - (A) two (2) hours for physical freight, vehicle, or rolling stock transit;
    - (B) five (5) seconds for digital credential verification, authentication, or identity system transactions;
    - (C) for energy transmission and grid interconnection, latency thresholds established by NIST, calibrated to ensure that cross-Regional energy flows are not materially disadvantaged relative to intra-Regional flows. Until NIST publishes specific thresholds, additional latency attributable to cross-Regional standards incompatibility shall not exceed one hundred (100) milliseconds for grid synchronization and frequency regulation signals, or five (5) seconds for bulk power scheduling and dispatch;
    - (D) thirty (30) minutes for telecommunications and data network interconnection handoffs;
- (4) credentials, licenses, or digital identity instruments valid in one Region are not recognized or are not technically operable in another Region due to standards incompatibility;
- (5) a pattern of incremental standard changes, none individually meeting thresholds (1) through (4), cumulatively creates equivalent barrier effects over any thirty-six (36) month period.

The ARB shall develop and publish methodologies for measuring material barriers, including domain-specific threshold calibration, updated no less than every five (5) years. Disputed barrier measurements shall be resolved by the ARB within ninety (90) days of petition.

(o) **Federal Interoperability Floors.** The Federal Department of Commerce, acting through the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), shall establish and maintain minimum interoperability standards ("Interoperability Floors") for each category of Critical Infrastructure defined in subsection (m):

- (1) Interoperability Floors shall specify the technical requirements for cross-Regional compatibility, including but not limited to: voltage and frequency standards for electric power; track gauge, signaling protocols, and freight car specifications for rail; digital credential formats, authentication protocols, and data exchange standards for identity systems; and interconnection protocols for communications networks;
- (2) Interoperability Floors shall be developed in consultation with Regional governments, industry experts, relevant federal agencies, and international standards organizations, and shall be based on best available technology, existing international standards (including ISO, IEEE, and ITU standards), and the objective of maintaining the National Common Market as a single integrated economic space;
- (3) Interoperability Floors shall balance interoperability with legitimate technological advancement. NIST shall not mandate specific technologies when multiple technologies can achieve equivalent interoperability;
- (4) Interoperability Floors shall be reviewed and, if necessary, updated every five (5) years. Between reviews, NIST may issue interim standards in response to emergent technologies, provided that interim standards include a minimum two (2) year transition period. Interim standards follow their own two-year transition timeline and are not subject to the major/minor classification under subsection (s)(3)(A).

(p) **Regional Innovation Within Floors.** Regions may adopt infrastructure standards exceeding Interoperability Floors established under subsection (o), provided that:

- (1) the Regional standard maintains full backward compatibility with the applicable Interoperability Floor. "Full backward compatibility" means that equipment, systems, credentials, and vehicles conforming to the Interoperability Floor can operate within the Region without modification, conversion, or additional cost to the operator;
- (2) interstate users — including persons, goods, vehicles, and energy in transit — experience no additional burden, delay, cost, or technical requirement beyond what would be experienced under the Interoperability Floor;
- (3) the variation serves a genuine technical, safety, or efficiency purpose. The burden of demonstrating genuine purpose rests on the Region;
- (4) the Region has obtained pre-implementation certification under subsection (q).

(q) **Pre-Implementation Certification.** Before adopting, implementing, or materially modifying infrastructure standards for any category of Critical Infrastructure:

- (1) the Region shall submit the proposed standards, together with a Technical Impact Assessment, to NIST no less than one hundred twenty (120) days before the proposed effective date;
- (2) the Technical Impact Assessment shall include: (A) a detailed description of the proposed standard; (B) identification of all Interoperability Floor requirements applicable to the infrastructure category; (C) analysis of backward compatibility under subsection (p)(1); (D) analysis of interstate user impact under subsection (p)(2); (E) documentation of the genuine technical, safety, or efficiency purpose under subsection (p)(3); (F) estimated conversion costs for affected interstate users, if any;
- (3) NIST shall issue an Interoperability Certification or a Certification Denial within ninety (90) days. If NIST fails to act within ninety (90) days, the standard is deemed certified and the Region may proceed with implementation under provisional status. Provisional status means: (A) NIST shall publish the deemed certification in the National Infrastructure Transparency System with a prominent "DEEMED — NOT REVIEWED" designation; (B) the standard remains subject to post-implementation review for one hundred eighty (180) days after implementation, during which any Region, the federal government, or any person or entity demonstrating economic interest may petition the ARB for review; (C) during the provisional period, any affected Region may seek an interim injunction from the ARB upon a showing of probable material barrier, without filing a full petition; (D) upon petition or injunction request, the ARB shall review the standard under the material barrier criteria of subsection (n) and may order modification, suspension, or withdrawal; (E) if the one hundred eighty (180) day provisional period expires without petition or injunction, the deemed certification becomes final;
- (4) standards for which Certification has been expressly denied may not be implemented. A Region may resubmit modified standards with a new Technical Impact Assessment;
- (5) NIST shall publish all submissions, Technical Impact Assessments, Certifications, Denials, and deemed certifications in the National Infrastructure Transparency System established under Article I, Section 6(q);
- (6) Certification decisions, including deemed certifications and provisional-period ARB orders, are subject to de novo judicial review. Any Region, the federal government, or any person or entity demonstrating economic interest may challenge a Certification or Denial.

(r) **Enforcement and Remediation.** Upon finding that a Region has adopted, implemented, or maintained infrastructure standards creating a material barrier in violation of subsection (l):

- (1) the ARB may receive complaints from any Region, the federal government, or any person or entity experiencing a material barrier, and shall investigate potential violations;
- (2) upon finding a violation, the ARB shall order the Region to modify its standards to achieve compliance within one hundred eighty (180) days. The ARB order shall specify the particular standards creating the barrier and the minimum modifications necessary for compliance;
- (3) the Region shall bear all costs of modification, including transition costs for users who adopted the non-compliant Regional standard in reliance on the Region's Certification (if any was issued);
- (4) the Region shall compensate affected parties for documented economic losses caused by the material barrier during the period of non-compliance. Compensation shall include direct losses, consequential damages, and litigation costs. No sovereign immunity defense is available against claims under this subsection;
- (5) if the Region fails to achieve compliance within the one hundred eighty (180) day remediation period, the federal government may implement compatible standards directly within the Region. Implementation costs shall be recovered from the Region's equalization transfers or other federal payments. The Region shall lose independent standard-setting authority in the affected infrastructure category for five (5) years;
- (6) a Region found to have violated subsection (l) three (3) or more times within ten (10) years, whether in the same or different infrastructure categories, shall be designated a Repeat Interoperability Offender. A designated Region shall obtain ARB pre-approval before proposing any infrastructure standard change; upon ARB pre-approval, the Region shall then obtain NIST certification under subsection (q) before implementation. The ARB and NIST shall coordinate to provide a single consolidated decision within one hundred twenty (120) days. If the ARB and NIST fail to issue a consolidated decision within one hundred twenty (120) days, the proposed standard is deemed approved subject to ARB-imposed interim monitoring conditions, including reversibility requirements and quarterly compliance reporting. If the ARB and NIST disagree, the ARB determination shall prevail on questions of material barrier existence under subsection (n), and NIST shall prevail on questions of technical feasibility and standards compliance; disputes over characterization shall be resolved by the ARB with NIST's dissent published in NITS. Designation continues for ten (10) years or until the Region demonstrates sustained compliance;
- (7) cross-references to existing enforcement: treble damages under Article I, Section 6(n) apply to violations found to be in bad faith; repeat offender provisions under Article I, Section 6(p) apply independently and concurrently with this subsection.

(s) **Anti-Circumvention and Innovation Protection.**

- (1) **Prohibited Circumvention Strategies.** Regions may not:
    - (A) invoke "innovation," "efficiency," "modernization," "security," or "environmental" justifications for standards whose primary effect is creating barriers to inter-Regional infrastructure connectivity;
    - (B) change infrastructure standards more frequently than once per calendar year for any single infrastructure category, unless the change is (i) required by a federal Interoperability Floor update, (ii) addresses a documented safety emergency, or (iii) constitutes a cybersecurity vulnerability patch or security update that does not alter the interoperability characteristics of the standard. A Region that changes standards more frequently without meeting exceptions (i) through (iii) creates a rebuttable presumption of a standards arms race intended to prevent neighboring Regions from maintaining compatibility;
    - (C) condition access to Regional infrastructure, services, or markets on adoption of proprietary Regional standards that exceed Interoperability Floors, except where the Region has obtained Certification under subsection (q) and the condition serves a genuine safety purpose;
    - (D) use procurement specifications, licensing requirements, or regulatory mandates to effectively require non-interoperable standards for infrastructure serving interstate functions;
    - (E) adopt standards developed by or exclusively licensed to entities in which the Region, its officials, or their immediate family members hold a material financial interest. A "material financial interest" means direct ownership exceeding one percent (1%) of the entity, a controlling interest regardless of percentage, or an active management or board role. Diversified holdings through mutual funds, pension funds, or index funds do not constitute a material financial interest. Standards adopted in violation of this clause create an irrebuttable presumption of barrier intent;
    - (F) mandate the use of proprietary hardware, software, or protocols for Critical Infrastructure when equivalent open standards — meaning publicly available, royalty-free specifications maintained by recognized standards organizations — exist and can achieve the same functional requirements. Where no equivalent open standard exists and NIST certifies that a proprietary specification is necessary to meet documented safety or operational requirements that cannot be achieved through available open standards, the Region may adopt the proprietary specification subject to Certification under subsection (q) and a requirement that the Region fund or participate in the development of an equivalent open standard, with progress reported to NIST annually. This prohibition extends to procurement specifications, certification requirements, and interoperability conditions that effectively mandate proprietary solutions.
- (2) **Legitimate Innovation Protection.** This section does not prohibit:
    - (A) genuine technological innovation that advances national capability, provided backward compatibility is maintained under subsection (p)(1);
    - (B) pilot programs for new technologies approved by NIST, limited to three (3) years and geographically bounded within the Region, provided interstate transit corridors are exempted from the pilot;
    - (C) Regional standards that exceed Interoperability Floors while maintaining full compatibility, certified under subsection (q);
    - (D) emergency temporary modifications to infrastructure standards in response to natural disaster, cyberattack, or physical infrastructure failure, provided the modifications are reported to NIST within forty-eight (48) hours, limited to the duration of the emergency, and designed to restore interoperable operation as rapidly as practicable.
- (3) **Technology Transition Support.** When Interoperability Floors are updated under subsection (o)(4):
    - (A) Regions shall have a minimum transition period of three (3) years for major standard changes and one (1) year for minor standard changes. NIST shall classify each update as major or minor at the time of publication;
    - (B) the Capacity Development Program under Article XXI, Section 7(f), where still operational, and otherwise federal grants appropriated for this purpose, shall support transition costs for Regions with demonstrated fiscal need as certified by the IFC;
    - (C) legacy equipment and systems conforming to the prior Interoperability Floor shall remain operable during the transition period. No Region or federal agency may require immediate retirement of conforming legacy systems.
- (4) **Permanence.** The Interoperability Mandate of subsection (l) is a permanent provision of this Constitution. It is not subject to the sunset provisions of subsection (d), the variance provisions of subsection (e), or any other mechanism that would permit its suspension. Interoperability Floors established under subsection (o) may evolve with technology, but the constitutional requirement that no Region may create material barriers through technical standards is inviolable.
- (5) **Data Sovereignty Deconfliction.** Where infrastructure interoperability under this section requires the exchange, verification, or processing of data subject to the data sovereignty provisions of Article I, Section 14:
    - (A) interoperability mechanisms shall be designed to achieve verification without requiring the transfer of underlying personal data across Regional boundaries, using privacy-preserving protocols such as zero-knowledge proofs, federated queries, or tokenized verification;
    - (B) Interoperability Floors established under subsection (o) for digital credential and identity systems (subsection (m)(4)) shall be developed in coordination with the data governance framework of Article I, Section 14, and shall not require Regions to compromise data sovereignty protections in order to achieve credential portability;
    - (C) disputes over the intersection of interoperability requirements and data sovereignty protections shall be resolved jointly by the ARB and the relevant data governance authority within ninety (90) days of petition. If the ARB and data governance authority fail to reach a joint resolution within ninety (90) days, the infrastructure shall operate in a temporary privacy-preserving mode — maintaining interoperability through privacy-preserving protocols under clause (A) without requiring full data exchange — pending judicial review. Either body may refer the dispute to the Constitutional Court, which shall resolve it within one hundred twenty (120) days. Neither the interoperability mandate nor data sovereignty protections shall have automatic precedence; the court shall balance both constitutional interests on the facts of the specific dispute.

#### Non-Infrastructure Product, Service, and Environmental Standards Interoperability

*Resolves Gap 78 — Asymmetric "Rights Floor" Regulatory Arbitrage. Extends the interoperability framework of subsections (l)-(s) to non-infrastructure product, service, and environmental standards, preventing Regions from using technically "higher" standards as de facto trade barriers while preserving Regional authority to exceed federal floors under Article XVIII, Section 2.*

(t) **Non-Infrastructure Standards Interoperability.**

- (1) **Scope.** The interoperability principles of subsection (l) extend to Regional standards for products, services, and environmental compliance that exceed federal floors, where those standards fall outside the Critical Infrastructure definition of subsection (m). Covered standards include but are not limited to: consumer product safety and performance standards; environmental compliance standards for manufactured goods, including emissions equipment, chemical composition, and materials requirements; building and construction codes; insurance and financial product standards; food, agricultural, and organic certification standards; digital service, data format, and application-layer standards not constituting telecommunications networks under subsection (m)(5); and testing, certification, and accreditation requirements for non-infrastructure products or services.
- (2) **Supplementary Relationship.** This subsection supplements but does not modify subsections (l) through (s). For standards within the Critical Infrastructure definition of subsection (m), subsections (l) through (s) control exclusively. Where a standard implicates both Critical Infrastructure and non-infrastructure products or services, the more protective framework applies to the infrastructure component and this subsection applies to the non-infrastructure component. Professional credentials are governed by Article I, Section 9 and are excluded from this subsection except as provided in paragraph (5).
- (3) **Equivalency Presumption.** Products, services, or environmental compliance meeting any Regional standard that exceeds the applicable federal floor are presumptively equivalent to all other Regional standards exceeding the same federal floor. No Region may exclude or disadvantage such products, services, or compliance based on which Regional standard they satisfy. The burden is on the excluding Region to demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that the excluded standard fails to achieve the protective purpose of the excluding Region's standard.
- (4) **Anti-Circumvention.** The anti-circumvention provisions of subsection (s)(1) apply to non-infrastructure standards under this subsection. In addition, the following are prohibited: requiring exclusive technologies, materials, or specifications available only from in-Region manufacturers or producers; requiring testing, certification, or accreditation available only from in-Region laboratories, agencies, or bodies; requiring insurance or financial products available only from in-Region providers; and adopting product or environmental standards that only in-Region producers currently meet, where equivalent protective outcomes are achievable through alternative specifications. A Region that adopts a standard meeting two or more of these indicators creates a rebuttable presumption of protectionist intent.
- (5) **Credential-as-Market-Access Barrier.** Where a Region conditions product or service market access on credentials, certifications, or professional qualifications beyond those required by the federal floor, the credential requirement is subject to both Article I, Section 9 (for the individual's right to practice) and this subsection (for the market access barrier effect). A credential requirement that functions primarily as a product market access barrier — including requirements that only Region-certified professionals may design, manufacture, inspect, or certify products sold in the Region — must independently satisfy the equivalency presumption of paragraph (3).
- (6) **Relationship to Article I, Section 11(c).** The general anti-discrimination principle of Article I, Section 11(c) — that jurisdictions may establish more protective standards provided they do not discriminate against interstate commerce — encompasses both facial discrimination and functional incompatibility that creates material barriers under subsection (u). This subsection provides the specific framework for evaluating non-infrastructure standards under that general principle.

(u) **Non-Infrastructure Material Barrier Standard.** A material barrier to inter-Regional product, service, or environmental compliance exists when any of the following conditions is met:

- (1) a Regional standard exceeding the federal floor requires conversion, reformulation, re-manufacture, or separate product versions for sale or use in that Region, where products meeting the federal floor or other Regional above-floor standards would not require such modification;
- (2) the cost of compliance with the Regional standard, including testing, certification, and adaptation, exceeds five percent (5%) of the wholesale value of the product or the annual cost of the service, measured against compliance with the federal floor;
- (3) the timeline to obtain Regional certification, testing, or approval exceeds sixty (60) days beyond the timeline required for federal-floor compliance;
- (4) a Regional testing, certification, or accreditation requirement creates a functional monopoly or imposes a queue exceeding ninety (90) days, effectively excluding timely market entry by out-of-Region products or services;
- (5) a pattern of incremental standard changes, none individually meeting thresholds (1) through (4), cumulatively creates equivalent barrier effects over any thirty-six (36) month period, extending the cumulative pattern provision of subsection (n)(5) to non-infrastructure standards.

The ARB shall develop and publish methodologies for measuring non-infrastructure material barriers, coordinated with the infrastructure barrier methodologies of subsection (n). Disputed barrier measurements shall be resolved by the ARB within ninety (90) days of petition.

(v) **Pre-Implementation Review for Non-Infrastructure Standards.**

- (1) **Mandatory Certification.** Before adopting a non-infrastructure standard that exceeds the federal floor and that, based on the Region's own assessment, meets or is likely to meet any material barrier threshold of subsection (u)(1) through (4), the Region shall submit the proposed standard, together with a Product/Service Impact Assessment, to the relevant federal agency no less than ninety (90) days before the proposed effective date. Relevant agencies include: the Environmental Protection Agency for environmental and emissions standards; the Food and Drug Administration for consumer product safety and food standards; the Department of Energy for energy-related product standards; and the National Institute of Standards and Technology for technical interoperability, building codes, and standards not within another agency's jurisdiction.
- (2) **Product/Service Impact Assessment.** The assessment shall include: (A) a description of the proposed standard and the federal floor it exceeds; (B) analysis of equivalency under subsection (t)(3); (C) estimated compliance costs for out-of-Region producers or providers; (D) identification of whether the standard requires exclusive technologies, testing facilities, or certifications under subsection (t)(4); (E) documentation of the genuine protective purpose the standard serves.
- (3) **Agency Certification.** The reviewing agency shall issue a Non-Infrastructure Standards Certification or Denial within sixty (60) days. If the agency fails to act within sixty (60) days, the standard is deemed certified subject to post-implementation review for one hundred eighty (180) days, during which any Region, the federal government, or any person or entity demonstrating economic interest may petition the ARB for review under subsection (u). NIST shall coordinate among federal agencies, maintain expertise rosters, and route submissions to the appropriate reviewing agency. Where no federal agency has clear subject-matter jurisdiction, NIST shall conduct the review.
- (4) **Notice-Only for Sub-Threshold Standards.** For non-infrastructure standards that do not meet the material barrier thresholds of subsection (u)(1) through (4) at the time of adoption, the Region shall provide notice to the ARB and other Regions no less than thirty (30) days before implementation. Any affected party may petition the ARB for post-implementation review under subsection (u).
- (5) **Denial Effect.** Standards for which Certification has been expressly denied may not be implemented. The Region may resubmit modified standards with a new Product/Service Impact Assessment. A pattern of two (2) or more denials for the same product category within three (3) years creates a rebuttable presumption that subsequent standards in that category are protectionist.

(w) **Harmonization of Non-Infrastructure Standards.**

- (1) When multiple Regions have adopted incompatible standards exceeding the same federal floor for non-infrastructure products, services, or environmental compliance, the relevant federal agency, in coordination with NIST, shall convene a harmonization process within thirty (30) days of petition by any Region, the federal government, or any person or entity demonstrating economic interest.
- (2) Participating Regions shall engage in good faith to develop interoperable or mutually recognized standards within one hundred eighty (180) days.
- (3) If harmonization fails after one hundred eighty (180) days, the ARB may impose interim interoperability requirements, including mandatory mutual recognition under subsection (t)(3), pending further harmonization or Congressional action.
- (4) Congress may mandate harmonization for specific product or service categories by ordinary legislation.

(x) **Non-Infrastructure Standards Registry.** NIST shall maintain, as a component of or companion to the National Infrastructure Transparency System established under Article I, Section 6(q), a Non-Infrastructure Standards Registry:

- (1) listing all Regional product, service, and environmental standards exceeding federal floors;
- (2) indicating equivalency and interoperability status with other Regional standards, including mutual recognition determinations;
- (3) publishing all Product/Service Impact Assessments, certifications, denials, and deemed certifications under subsection (v);
- (4) providing harmonization determinations and status under subsection (w);
- (5) updated no less frequently than quarterly.

### Section 4-A. Dispute Reduction and Litigation Management

(a) **Pre-Enactment Consultation.** Before enacting legislation in a Structured Concurrent Domain:

- (i) The Federal Government shall provide 60 days' notice to all Regional Governors with draft text;
- (ii) Regions shall provide 30 days' notice to the Federal Government and other Regions with draft text;
- (iii) Any level may request ARB advisory opinion during notice period;
- (iv) Advisory opinions issued within 45 days; non-binding but precedential.

(b) **Expedited ARB Certification.** For legislation in Structured Concurrent Domains:

- (i) ARB shall issue floor certifications within 60 days;
- (ii) Failure to issue within 60 days creates rebuttable presumption of validity;
- (iii) Expedited certifications are provisional and subject to full review within one year.

(c) **Presumption of Validity.** In judicial review of Concurrent Domain legislation:

- (i) Regional legislation exceeding federal floors is presumed valid;
- (ii) Federal floors with ARB spillover certification are presumed valid;
- (iii) Challenger bears burden of demonstrating invalidity by clear and convincing evidence.

(d) **Safe Harbors.** The ARB shall publish:

- (i) Model legislation templates that are pre-certified as valid;
- (ii) "Bright line" lists of clearly permissible Regional and Federal actions;
- (iii) Quarterly guidance on emerging issues.

(e) **Annual Limits.** The ARB shall not be required to adjudicate more than:

- (i) Fifty (50) domain boundary disputes per year from Federal Government;
- (ii) Twenty (20) domain boundary disputes per year per Region;
- (iii) Disputes exceeding limits shall be queued by filing date.

(f) **Hardship Exception.** The ARB may grant leave to exceed annual filing limits upon a showing that:

- (i) Denial would result in irreparable harm to Regional constitutional authority; and
- (ii) The dispute could not reasonably have been anticipated and filed earlier.

(g) **Consolidation Authority.** The ARB shall consolidate:

- (i) Disputes raising substantially similar domain questions;
- (ii) Disputes involving the same parties on related matters;
- (iii) Consolidated disputes count as one against filing limits.

(h) **Frivolousness Penalties.** A party that files a domain dispute found frivolous:

- (i) Shall pay the opposing party's costs;
- (ii) Loses one filing slot for the following year per frivolous filing;
- (iii) After three frivolous filings in five years, requires ARB leave to file.

### Section 5. Regional Exclusive Domains

(a) **Enumeration.** Regional Exclusive Domains are those areas where Regions have primary authority subject only to Federal Floors and Frameworks.

(b) **ARB Certification.** The Allocation Review Board shall certify whether legislation impacts Regional Exclusive Domains.

(c) **Supermajority Requirement.** Any bill establishing a "National Floor" or "National Framework" that the ARB has certified as impacting a Regional Exclusive Domain requires three-fifths (60%) majority of the House of Representatives for passage. This requirement may not be waived, suspended, or circumvented by House rules, and applies regardless of procedural posture (including conference reports, amendments, and reconciliation).

(d) **Pre-Legislative Domain Certification.**

(1) Before any bill establishing a National Floor or National Framework may be introduced in the House of Representatives, the bill's sponsor shall submit the proposed legislation to the Allocation Review Board for Domain Certification.

(2) Within thirty days of submission, the Board shall certify whether the proposed legislation impacts a Regional Exclusive Domain under this section.

(3) If the Board certifies that the legislation impacts a Regional Exclusive Domain:

- (i) the bill shall be subject to the supermajority requirement of subsection (c);
- (ii) this certification shall be noted in the bill's official text and cannot be removed by amendment; and
- (iii) any attempt to pass the bill by simple majority shall be void.

(4) If the Board certifies that the legislation does not impact a Regional Exclusive Domain, the bill may proceed under normal House procedures.

(5) The Board's Domain Certification is subject to judicial review only for abuse of discretion or clear legal error. Courts shall give substantial deference to the Board's determination of domain boundaries.

(6) Congress may not:

- (i) define its own jurisdiction over Regional Exclusive Domains;
- (ii) amend the definition of Regional Exclusive Domain except by constitutional amendment; or
- (iii) circumvent Domain Certification through creative bill drafting, omnibus legislation, or procedural manipulation. The single-subject requirement of Article IV, Section 5-A provides the enforcement mechanism for this prohibition.

(7) If the Board fails to issue certification within thirty days, the bill shall be presumptively certified as NOT impacting a Regional Exclusive Domain, and the bill may proceed under normal House procedures. This default prevents certification delay from being used to obstruct legislation.

#### Anti-Bottleneck Provisions

(8) **Expedited Certification Track.** The Board shall establish an expedited certification track for:

- (i) bills addressing declared emergencies;
- (ii) bills with bipartisan House sponsorship exceeding sixty percent;
- (iii) bills that are substantially similar to previously certified legislation.
Expedited certifications shall be completed within ten days.

(9) **Staffing and Capacity Requirements.** The Board shall maintain sufficient staff to process certification requests without backlog:

- (i) If average certification time exceeds twenty days for three consecutive months, the Board shall hire additional staff within sixty days;
- (ii) Certification staff funding is mandatory spending, not subject to annual appropriation;
- (iii) The Board shall publish monthly certification statistics including filing volume, average processing time, and pending requests.

(10) **Backlog Remediation.** If pending certification requests exceed fifty at any time:

- (i) The Board shall implement emergency processing procedures;
- (ii) New requests shall be processed in order of filing date;
- (iii) Requests pending more than twenty days shall be automatically approved for normal House procedures unless the Board affirmatively certifies Regional Exclusive Domain impact within five additional days.

(11) **Anti-Strategic-Delay.** No party may file certification requests for the purpose of creating backlog or delaying unrelated legislation:

- (i) Frivolous or duplicative requests may be summarily dismissed;
- (ii) A pattern of filing requests subsequently withdrawn may result in filing restrictions;
- (iii) The Board may consolidate substantially similar requests.

(12) **Congressional Bypass for Obstruction.** If the Board fails to process certifications due to quorum failure, member vacancies, or other institutional dysfunction for more than sixty consecutive days:

- (i) The House may proceed with legislation without certification by a three-fifths vote;
- (ii) Such legislation shall be subject to expedited judicial review within ninety days of enactment;
- (iii) This bypass may not be used if the Board is functioning normally but simply has a backlog.

---

### Section 6. Regional Equivalence Exemptions

(a) **Equivalence Petition.** A Region may petition the Allocation Review Board for an "Equivalence Exemption" from a specific National Floor. The Board shall grant the exemption if the Region demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence, that its alternative policy achieves the same or superior outcome as intended by the National Floor while better suiting regional economic, geographic, or demographic conditions.

(b) **Outcome Metrics.** For each National Floor, Congress shall specify measurable outcome metrics by which equivalence may be assessed. If Congress fails to specify metrics, the Allocation Review Board shall determine appropriate metrics based on the stated legislative purpose.

(c) **Provisional Compliance.** Pending Allocation Review Board determination on an Equivalence Petition:

(1) The Region may implement its alternative policy on a provisional basis;

(2) The Region shall demonstrate a good-faith compliance mechanism, which may include:

- (i) posting a compliance bond in an amount determined by the Board,
- (ii) establishing an escrow fund for potential remediation costs,
- (iii) implementing enhanced monitoring and reporting, or
- (iv) other assurance mechanisms the Board deems adequate;

(3) Provisional implementation shall not constitute a violation of the National Floor during the pendency of the petition;

(4) If the petition is denied, the Region shall have one hundred eighty days to achieve full compliance with the National Floor.

*Resolves Gap 49 — House Majoritarianism and Consensus Floor Problem. The following subsections complete the Equivalence Shield mechanism by adding determination timelines, renewal procedures, and anti-circumvention safeguards.*

(d) **Board Determination Timeline.**

(1) The Allocation Review Board shall issue a final determination on any Equivalence Petition within two hundred seventy (270) days of filing.

(2) The Board shall publish a preliminary assessment within one hundred twenty (120) days, including:

- (i) identification of the outcome metrics under subsection (b) to be applied;
- (ii) the data sources and measurement methodology to be used;
- (iii) any additional information required from the petitioning Region.

(3) The petitioning Region shall have sixty (60) days from the preliminary assessment to submit supplemental evidence. If the Region fails to submit information identified as required under paragraph (2)(iii) within this period:

- (i) the two hundred seventy (270) day determination deadline is tolled until the Region provides the required information;
- (ii) the Board shall notify the Region that the deadline has been tolled and specify the outstanding information;
- (iii) tolling under this paragraph does not affect the Region's provisional compliance status under subsection (c).

(4) If the Board fails to issue a final determination within two hundred seventy (270) days (as adjusted by any tolling under paragraph (3) or extension under paragraph (6)):

- (i) the petition shall be deemed provisionally approved;
- (ii) provisional approval continues until the Board issues a final determination;
- (iii) the Board shall issue a final determination within one hundred eighty (180) additional days of provisional approval; if the Board fails to do so, the petitioning Region or any party with standing under subsection (f)(7)(i) may seek a writ of mandamus in federal court to compel a determination within sixty (60) days of the court's order;
- (iv) if no party seeks mandamus within ninety (90) days after expiration of the one hundred eighty (180) day period under clause (iii), provisional approval is suspended and the Region shall achieve compliance with the National Floor within one hundred eighty (180) days;
- (v) a pattern of failing to meet the two hundred seventy (270) day deadline on three or more petitions within any twelve-month period triggers the staffing and capacity requirements of Section 5(d)(9)-(10), applied to equivalence determination staff.

(5) **Expedited Determinations.** The Board shall complete determinations within ninety (90) days for:

- (i) renewal petitions under subsection (e) where the Region's prior performance data demonstrates sustained equivalence;
- (ii) petitions substantially similar to previously approved exemptions in other Regions;
- (iii) petitions during the provisional compliance period of a National Floor's first year of implementation, where compliance costs are most acute.

(6) **Good Cause Extension.** The Board may extend the two hundred seventy (270) day deadline by up to ninety (90) additional days upon a published finding that the petition presents novel policy questions, requires data collection not reasonably available within the standard timeline, or involves technical complexity warranting additional expert review. The Board may grant only one extension per petition.

(7) **Non-Cooperation Consequences.** If the Board determines that a Region's failure to provide timely information or data under paragraph (3) was not justified by good cause:

- (i) the Region shall not be eligible for expedited determinations under paragraph (5) for a period of three (3) years;
- (ii) the Board may require the Region to post additional bond under subsection (c)(2) for any pending or future petitions;
- (iii) the period of non-cooperation shall not count toward the determination deadline under paragraph (1).

(e) **Renewal and Review.**

(1) **Duration.** Equivalence Exemptions shall be valid for five (5) years from the date of final determination.

(2) **Renewal.** A Region may petition for renewal no earlier than twelve (12) months and no later than six (6) months before expiration. The renewal petition shall include five years of outcome data demonstrating continued equivalent or superior outcomes. The Board shall apply the same "clear and convincing evidence" standard as for initial petitions.

(3) **Continuous Monitoring.** During the exemption period:

- (i) the Region shall submit annual outcome reports to the Board using the metrics established under subsection (b);
- (ii) the Board shall publish an annual equivalence assessment comparing Regional outcomes to National Floor benchmarks;
- (iii) annual reports and assessments shall be publicly available.

(4) **Mid-Term Review.** If annual outcome data indicates that a Region's alternative policy has produced outcomes materially below National Floor standards for two (2) consecutive years:

- (i) the Board shall initiate a formal mid-term review within sixty (60) days;
- (ii) the Region shall have one hundred twenty (120) days to demonstrate remediation or explain the divergence;
- (iii) if the Board finds continued material divergence without adequate justification, the exemption shall be revoked;
- (iv) upon revocation, the Region shall have one hundred eighty (180) days to achieve full compliance with the National Floor under subsection (c)(4).

(5) **Material Divergence Standard.** For purposes of this subsection:

- (i) the Board shall specify a domain-appropriate divergence threshold for each outcome metric in the preliminary assessment under subsection (d)(2), within a range of no less than eighty-five percent (85%) and no more than ninety-five percent (95%) of the National Floor benchmark, and shall designate the polarity of each metric (whether higher or lower values represent superior outcomes);
- (ii) in the absence of a Board-specified threshold, the default is ninety percent (90%);
- (iii) "materially below" means outcomes that are worse than the applicable threshold in the direction designated under clause (i), as measured by the metrics established under subsection (b);
- (iv) a Region may petition the Board to exclude a measurement period affected by exogenous causes (economic recession, natural disaster, pandemic, or other force majeure), subject to:
    - (A) the Board shall certify or deny the exogenous cause claim within sixty (60) days of the petition; if the Board fails to act within sixty (60) days, the claim is deemed denied without prejudice to re-petition upon submission of additional evidence;
    - (B) if certified, the affected measurement period is excluded from divergence calculations for up to two (2) consecutive annual reporting periods;
    - (C) after two (2) years of certified exclusion, the Region must demonstrate remediation or the full divergence record applies regardless of continued exogenous conditions;
    - (D) the Board's certification, including underlying data and analysis, shall be publicly available.

(6) **Lapse and Transition.** If a Region fails to file a timely renewal petition:

- (i) the exemption expires at the end of the five-year term;
- (ii) the Region shall have one hundred eighty (180) days to achieve full compliance with the National Floor;
- (iii) a late renewal petition filed within ninety (90) days of expiration may be accepted at the Board's discretion if the Region demonstrates good cause for the delay.

(f) **Anti-Circumvention and Integrity.**

(1) **No Race to Bottom.** This section does not authorize Regional policies that fail to achieve the substantive outcomes intended by National Floors. "Equivalence" requires equal or superior outcomes as measured by the metrics established under subsection (b), not mere formal compliance, lesser protections, or alternative definitions of the protected interest.

(2) **Serial Refiling Prohibition.** A Region whose Equivalence Petition has been denied may not refile a petition addressing the same National Floor within twelve (12) months of denial unless:

- (i) the Region's alternative policy has been materially redesigned; and
- (ii) the Board certifies that the redesigned policy is sufficiently distinct to warrant de novo review.

(3) **Provisional Abuse Prevention.** If a Region's Equivalence Petition is denied and the Region subsequently refiles within the one hundred eighty (180) day compliance period under subsection (c)(4):

- (i) the Region may not implement the alternative policy on a provisional basis during the second petition;
- (ii) the compliance clock under subsection (c)(4) continues to run during the second petition;
- (iii) the Board may consolidate the second petition with compliance monitoring.

(4) **Outcome Measurement Integrity.** Regions may not manipulate the timing, methodology, or data sources of outcome measurement to inflate equivalence claims:

- (i) the Board shall specify measurement periods and data sources in the preliminary assessment under subsection (d)(2);
- (ii) Regions shall provide access to raw data underlying outcome reports;
- (iii) the Board may commission independent verification of Regional outcome data;
- (iv) knowing submission of materially false outcome data constitutes fraud upon the Board and grounds for immediate exemption revocation plus five-year disqualification from filing new petitions.

(5) **Exemption Stacking.** Where a Region holds or seeks multiple Equivalence Exemptions whose combined effect may produce outcomes below the aggregate intent of the applicable National Floors:

- (i) the Board shall assess the cumulative impact of stacked exemptions at initial grant and at each renewal;
- (ii) the Board may condition approval or renewal of any exemption on the Region demonstrating that cumulative outcomes remain equivalent;
- (iii) this assessment does not apply to exemptions covering unrelated policy domains.

(6) **Relationship to Constitutional Minimums.** Equivalence Exemptions may not be sought for:

- (i) constitutional minimums established under Section 4(h) (labor and safety minimums), which are permanent and exempt from variance and sunset under Section 4(k)(1);
- (ii) rights protections established under Article III-RF;
- (iii) obligations under Article I (Regional structure, mutual recognition, migration).

(7) **Enforcement.**

- (i) **Standing.** The following persons may bring an action in federal court challenging a Region's failure to achieve equivalent outcomes under a granted exemption:
    - (A) residents of the Region directly affected by the policy subject to the exemption;
    - (B) regulated entities operating within the Region subject to obligations under the applicable National Floor;
    - (C) other Regions that demonstrate direct harm from competitive disadvantage or spillover effects attributable to the exemption.
- (ii) **Administrative Exhaustion.** Before filing suit, a plaintiff must first petition the Board to initiate a mid-term review under subsection (e)(4). The plaintiff may proceed to federal court only after the Board acts on the petition or fails to act within one hundred twenty (120) days.
- (iii) **Remedies.** If the court finds the Region's alternative policy has not achieved equivalent outcomes, the court may:
    - (A) order compliance with the National Floor within a specified period;
    - (B) revoke the exemption prospectively;
    - (C) award compensatory damages to residents who have standing under clause (i)(A); injunctive relief under subclauses (A) and (B) is available to all parties with standing under clause (i).

### Section 6-A. Infrastructure Prioritization Transparency

(a) **Published Criteria.** Each Region shall publish and maintain criteria for infrastructure sequencing, including:

- (i) Factors determining project priority;
- (ii) Methodology for applying factors to specific projects;
- (iii) Timeline projections for queued projects.

(b) **Prohibited Factors.** No prioritization criteria may include:

- (i) Voting patterns of affected localities;
- (ii) Party registration of affected populations;
- (iii) Prior electoral outcomes in affected areas;
- (iv) Political affiliation of local officials.

(c) **Proxy Measure Limitation.** Criteria that correlate greater than 0.6 with prohibited factors require independent infrastructure justification. "Independent infrastructure justification" means a justification that, when applied neutrally across all localities, would not systematically correlate with political alignment.

(d) **Public Accessibility.** Prioritization criteria and their application shall be:

- (i) Published on publicly accessible websites;
- (ii) Updated within 30 days of any methodology change;
- (iii) Accompanied by explanation of how current projects were prioritized.

(e) **Presumption of Need.**

(1) **Prima Facie Case.** A prima facie case of patronage sequencing is established if a locality demonstrates:

- (i) The locality is demonstrably underserved relative to the Regional average for the infrastructure category; AND
- (ii) A sequencing decision delays investment by more than three (3) years relative to comparable projects; AND
- (iii) A pattern of delays correlates with political alignment at greater than 0.5 statistical significance.

(2) **Burden Shift.** Upon prima facie showing:

- (i) The Region bears the burden of demonstrating independent infrastructure justification;
- (ii) Justifications must be specific to the delayed project, not general policy;
- (iii) Post-hoc justifications are viewed with skepticism.

(3) **Independent Infrastructure Justification.** Justification is independent if it:

- (i) Applies neutrally across all localities;
- (ii) Would not systematically disadvantage politically disfavored areas when applied consistently;
- (iii) Is documented in contemporaneous records, not reconstructed for litigation.

(f) **Infrastructure Sequencing Audits.**

(1) **Audit Authority.** The Regional Auditor (or equivalent independent official) may:

- (i) Audit infrastructure sequencing decisions for compliance with this Section;
- (ii) Conduct statistical correlation analysis between sequencing and political variables;
- (iii) Publish annual reports on infrastructure allocation patterns.

(2) **Data Requirements.** Regions shall maintain and provide to auditors:

- (i) Complete sequencing decisions for the prior ten (10) years;
- (ii) Stated justifications for each decision at time of decision;
- (iii) Outcome data enabling correlation analysis.

(3) **Delegation Non-Relief.** Delegation of infrastructure sequencing to private or quasi-private entities does not relieve the Region of responsibility for compliance with this Section. Private entities exercising delegated sequencing authority are subject to the same transparency and anti-patronage requirements.

(4) **Public Reporting.** Audit results shall be:

- (i) Published annually;
- (ii) Transmitted to the ARB for potential enforcement action;
- (iii) Available to affected localities for use in challenges.

(g) **Remedies for Sequencing Patronage.**

(1) **Standing.** Affected localities have standing to challenge sequencing patterns if they meet the prima facie standard of subsection (e).

(2) **ARB Authority.** Upon finding patronage sequencing, the ARB may:

- (i) Order revised prioritization using neutral methodology;
- (ii) Order accelerated timelines for demonstrably disadvantaged localities;
- (iii) Appoint an infrastructure sequencing monitor for up to five (5) years.

(3) **Prospective-First Remedies.** Remedies shall prioritize prospective correction over retroactive reallocation except where delay has caused irreparable harm. No monetary damages for past sequencing; remedy is prospective correction of methodology and accelerated timelines.

(4) **Pattern Evidence.** In challenges under this Section:

- (i) Pattern evidence is admissible and probative;
- (ii) Individual intent is not required if pattern establishes discriminatory effect;
- (iii) Statistical evidence of correlation may establish prima facie case.

### Section 7. Allocation Review Board

#### Establishment and Composition

(a) **Establishment.** There is hereby established an Allocation Review Board (ARB) to resolve disputes regarding the allocation of powers among federal, Regional, and State governments.

(b) **Composition.** The ARB shall consist of nine members appointed as follows:

(1) Three members appointed by the President with Senate confirmation;

(2) Two members appointed by the Judicial Conference of the United States from among retired federal and state appellate judges who have never held partisan elected office;

(3) Two members elected by the Regional Governors, with each Region casting one vote and no Region voting for a resident of its own Region;

(4) Two members appointed by agreement of the minority leadership of both houses of Congress.

(c) **Party Balance.** No more than four members may be affiliated with the same political party. For purposes of this subsection, "independent" members count toward the party with which they most recently affiliated or, if never affiliated, are assigned by the Chief Justice to maintain balance.

(d) **Experience Diversity.** At least two members must have primary professional experience in state or local government (not federal service), and at least one member must have primary experience in private sector or academic roles.

(e) **Terms and Removal.** Members serve staggered seven-year terms, may serve only one term, and may not be removed except for cause (misconduct, incapacity, or conviction of a felony). Removal requires two-thirds vote of the Senate.

(f) **Vacancy Filling.** Vacancies shall be filled by the original appointing authority within ninety days. If not filled within ninety days, the Chief Justice shall make a temporary appointment from among retired appellate judges until the original authority acts.

#### Jurisdiction and Standards

(g) **Jurisdiction.** The ARB shall have original jurisdiction over:

(1) Disputes between Regions concerning allocation of powers;

(2) Challenges to federal exercise of authority as exceeding enumerated powers;

(3) Challenges to Regional exercise of authority as exceeding enumerated powers;

(4) Disputes regarding spillover effects and non-concurrency;

(5) Certification of legislation as within appropriate governmental authority.

(h) **Standards.** The ARB shall apply the allocation framework established by Congress, or in its absence, the default rules of Article XXI. The ARB shall interpret this Constitution to preserve the balance of power among federal, Regional, and State governments.

#### Appeals and Binding Effect

(i) **Immediate Binding Effect.** In all matters of power allocation:

(1) The ARB's ruling is immediately binding upon issuance;

(2) The ruling shall not be stayed pending appeal to the Supreme Court except as provided in subsection (l);

(3) Parties must comply with ARB rulings during any appeal period.

(j) **Supreme Court Review Scope.** The Supreme Court may review ARB decisions only for:

(1) Errors of constitutional interpretation;

(2) Violation of due process in ARB proceedings;

(3) The Supreme Court may not reweigh factual evidence or substitute its judgment on factual matters.

(k) **Appeals.** ARB decisions are final on factual matters. Questions of constitutional interpretation may be appealed to the Supreme Court.

(l) **Limited Stay Authority.** The Supreme Court may stay an ARB ruling only upon finding:

(1) Substantial likelihood that the ARB committed clear constitutional error;

(2) Irreparable harm to the appellant absent stay;

(3) The stay would not substantially harm other parties or the public interest;

(4) Stay requests must be decided within seven days.

#### Anti-Remand Provisions

(m) **No Factual Remand.** The Supreme Court may not remand a power-allocation dispute to the ARB for:

(1) Further factual findings;

(2) Reconsideration of evidence;

(3) Application of a "new" factual standard.

(n) **Reversal or Affirmance Only.** Upon review of an ARB power-allocation decision:

(1) The Supreme Court shall affirm or reverse;

(2) If reversed, the Supreme Court shall specify the correct constitutional interpretation;

(3) The ARB shall apply the Court's interpretation to the existing factual record without further proceedings.

(o) **One Appeal Limit.** Each party may appeal an ARB power-allocation ruling to the Supreme Court only once:

(1) Subsequent appeals on the same matter are barred;

(2) ARB application of Supreme Court interpretation is not separately appealable;

(3) The ARB's post-reversal ruling is final.

#### Parallel Filing Prevention

(p) **Exclusive Initial Jurisdiction.** Power-allocation disputes shall be filed first with the ARB:

(1) The Supreme Court shall not accept original jurisdiction over power-allocation matters;

(2) Filings that characterize power-allocation as "pure constitutional interpretation" shall be transferred to the ARB;

(3) The ARB shall determine whether a matter involves power allocation.

(q) **Sequential Proceeding Requirement.** Parties may not:

(1) File parallel proceedings in the ARB and Supreme Court on related matters;

(2) Seek Supreme Court review until ARB proceedings are complete;

(3) Raise arguments in Supreme Court that were not presented to the ARB.

(r) **Expedited Timeline Enforcement.** The combined timeline for ARB ruling and Supreme Court review shall not exceed:

(1) One hundred twenty days from initial filing to final resolution;

(2) Failure of either body to rule within its allotted time results in automatic ruling for the non-moving party;

(3) Extensions only for extraordinary circumstances certified by the Chief Justice.

#### Adversarial Review Office

(s) **Establishment of ARO.** There is established within the ARB an Adversarial Review Office ("ARO"), structurally independent from the ARB's certification and determination functions.

(t) **ARO Composition.** The ARO shall consist of:

(1) A Chief Adversarial Officer appointed by the minority party leadership of both houses of Congress (by agreement) for a non-renewable five-year term;

(2) Deputy Adversarial Officers and staff sufficient to review all major determinations, with staffing levels set by formula (not annual appropriation);

(3) Independent legal counsel with authority to file court actions.

(u) **ARO Function.** The ARO shall:

(1) Review every Domain Certification, Equivalence Determination, Preemption Certification, and other major determination;

(2) Issue a public "Adversarial Report" identifying potential errors, alternative interpretations, methodological concerns, and evidence of bias;

(3) Have standing to challenge determinations in federal court on behalf of affected parties or the public interest;

(4) Refer evidence of misconduct to the Department of Justice Inspector General.

(v) **Review Completion Trigger.** No determination shall take effect until:

(1) The ARO has issued its Adversarial Report; OR

(2) The ARO has certified in writing that it has completed its review and declines to issue a report; OR

(3) The ARO has petitioned the National Constitutional Court for a time extension due to data volume or complexity, and such extension has expired.

#### Regional Override

(w) **Regional Override of Determinations.** If five of the seven Regional Governors jointly certify that a determination by the ARB:

(1) Exceeds the ARB's statutory or constitutional authority;

(2) Reflects systematic bias toward federal expansion or centralization; or

(3) Fundamentally misapplies the criteria established by law;

the determination shall be suspended pending expedited judicial review.

(x) **Expedited Override Review.** Upon Regional Override certification:

(1) The Supreme Court shall grant expedited review within thirty days;

(2) Oral argument shall be held within sixty days of granting review;

(3) Decision shall be issued within ninety days of oral argument.

(y) **Override Limitations.**

(1) This section may not be invoked more than twice per calendar year;

(2) A Region that participates in a frivolous override (as determined by the Court) shall be barred from participating in the next override petition;

(3) Override may not be used to challenge individual case determinations; only determinations of general applicability or systematic patterns.

#### Systematic Bias Detection

(z) **Statistical Monitoring.** The Government Accountability Office shall annually analyze all ARB determinations for systematic patterns, including:

(1) Certification and determination outcomes correlated with presidential administration;

(2) Regional win/loss rates in contested proceedings;

(3) Correlation between outcomes and the appointing authority of deciding members;

(4) Deviation from historical baseline patterns;

(5) ARO challenge success rates over time.

(aa) **Bias Finding.** If GAO analysis demonstrates statistically significant correlation (p < 0.05) between determination outcomes and political factors over any rolling three-year period:

(1) The finding shall be publicly reported to Congress, all Regional Governors, and the Chief Justice;

(2) All determinations during the affected period shall be subject to expedited judicial review upon petition by any affected party, with de novo standard of review;

(3) Congress shall hold public hearings within sixty days;

(4) The ARB shall submit a remediation plan within ninety days.

(bb) **Structural Response.** If bias findings persist for two consecutive three-year periods (six years total):

(1) All current members' terms shall automatically expire;

(2) Replacement members shall be appointed by lottery from a pool consisting of retired federal appellate judges, retired state supreme court justices, and former deans of ABA-accredited law schools who have never held partisan elected office;

(3) Lottery appointments shall serve three-year terms, after which normal appointment procedures resume;

(4) Members removed under this subsection are permanently ineligible for reappointment to any technocratic body.

#### Budgetary Independence

(cc) **Automatic Funding Formula.** The operating budget of the ARB and the ARO shall be:

(1) Set as a fixed percentage of federal revenue (0.002% for the ARB; 0.0005% for the ARO);

(2) Automatically appropriated without annual congressional action;

(3) Adjusted annually for inflation using the Consumer Price Index.

(dd) **Prohibition on Budgetary Manipulation.** Congress may not:

(1) Reduce funding below the formula amount;

(2) Impose conditions on the use of formula funds;

(3) Transfer formula funds to other purposes;

(4) Delay disbursement of formula funds beyond thirty days after the start of each fiscal year.

(ee) **Enforcement.** Any member of the ARB, or the ARO, may petition the Supreme Court for a writ of mandamus to compel disbursement of formula funds. Such petitions shall be heard on an expedited basis.

#### Anti-Consolidation Safeguards

(ff) **Cross-Partisan Appointment Mandate.** To prevent a single political movement from bypassing constitutional checks through unified control of the Federal and Regional governments:

(ff-1) **Council of Governors Approval.** Appointments to the ARB, IFC, and FDCA require a three-fifths (60%) vote of the Council of Governors, ensuring that a simple partisan alignment between the President and a majority of Governors cannot capture these bodies.

(ff-2) **Adversarial Minority Key.** The minority party in the House of Representatives shall appoint a "Transparency Observer" to each Constitutional Oversight Body with full access to deliberations and data, but no vote. The Observer may:

- (1) attend all meetings, including closed sessions;
- (2) access all documents, data, and communications;
- (3) publish dissenting reports and minority analyses;
- (4) refer concerns directly to Congress and the public.

(ff-3) **Unified Control Supermajority.** If at any time a single political party controls the Presidency and four or more Regional Governorships, the threshold for the ARB to certify a federal bill as "Non-Exclusive" shall automatically rise to a three-quarters (75%) vote of the Board.

(ff-4) **Party Alignment Determination.** For purposes of subsection (ff-3), the IFC shall determine party alignment based on:

- (1) formal party registration of the officeholder;
- (2) caucus affiliation in the case of legislators;
- (3) endorsement patterns and voting alignment for independents.
An officeholder who formally declares non-alignment with any party shall not be counted toward the unified control threshold.

### Section 7-A. Algorithmic Governance Transparency

(a) **Mandatory Algorithmic Transparency.** All algorithms, data models, formulas, and computational methods used by the Allocation Review Board, Independent Fiscal Council, Federal Data Coordination Agency, or any other Constitutional Oversight Body to make determinations affecting Regional rights, obligations, or resources shall be:

- (1) fully documented in plain language accessible to non-technical readers;
- (2) published in complete technical detail, including source code where applicable;
- (3) accompanied by explanations of all assumptions, weightings, and data inputs;
- (4) subject to public comment before initial adoption and before any material modification.

(b) **Open-Source Requirement.** All software, algorithms, and computational tools used for constitutional determinations shall be:

- (1) published as open-source code in publicly accessible repositories;
- (2) accompanied by complete documentation enabling independent replication;
- (3) version-controlled with full change history publicly available;
- (4) testable by any interested party using publicly available data.

(c) **Independent Algorithmic Audit.** Each Constitutional Oversight Body shall undergo annual algorithmic audit by an independent panel:

- (1) The panel shall be appointed by the National Academy of Sciences;
- (2) The audit shall assess accuracy, bias, and methodological soundness;
- (3) Audit findings shall be published within sixty (60) days of completion;
- (4) The audited body shall respond to findings within ninety (90) days.

(d) **Bias Testing Requirements.** Before any algorithm may be used for constitutional determinations:

- (1) it shall be tested for systematic bias against any Region, demographic group, or economic sector;
- (2) bias testing results shall be published;
- (3) algorithms showing statistically significant bias (p < 0.05) may not be used until corrected;
- (4) ongoing bias monitoring shall continue throughout the algorithm's use.

(e) **Data Input Transparency.** All data used as inputs to algorithmic determinations shall be:

- (1) publicly disclosed, with appropriate privacy protections for individual-level data;
- (2) sourced from publicly verifiable sources;
- (3) accompanied by metadata describing collection methodology, limitations, and potential biases;
- (4) subject to challenge by affected parties who may submit alternative data.

(f) **Methodological Challenge Right.** Any Region or affected party may challenge the methodology of an algorithmic determination:

- (1) challenges shall be heard by a Special Master appointed by the Chief Justice with relevant technical expertise;
- (2) the challenger may present expert testimony on methodological flaws;
- (3) the Constitutional Oversight Body bears the burden of demonstrating methodological soundness;
- (4) if the challenge is sustained, the determination shall be vacated pending methodological correction.

(g) **Factual Finding Limitation.** The principle that factual findings of Constitutional Oversight Bodies are "final" under Section 7 applies only to:

- (1) factual determinations based on disclosed data and transparent methodology;
- (2) findings that have survived methodological challenge or for which the challenge period has expired;
- (3) this principle does not immunize algorithmic methodology from review.

(h) **Anti-Black-Box Provision.** No Constitutional Oversight Body may:

- (1) use proprietary algorithms whose methodology cannot be publicly disclosed;
- (2) rely on machine learning models that cannot be explained in human-interpretable terms;
- (3) treat algorithmic outputs as conclusive without human review and approval;
- (4) refuse to explain the basis for any specific determination to affected parties.

(i) **Algorithmic Impact Statements.** Before adopting any new algorithm or materially modifying an existing algorithm, Constitutional Oversight Bodies shall publish an Algorithmic Impact Statement assessing:

- (1) potential differential impacts on various Regions;
- (2) sensitivity analysis showing how changes in inputs affect outputs;
- (3) comparison with alternative methodological approaches;
- (4) mechanisms for ongoing monitoring and correction.

(j) **Whistleblower Protection.** Employees of Constitutional Oversight Bodies who report algorithmic bias, methodological flaws, or data manipulation shall be protected under federal whistleblower statutes and may not be terminated, demoted, or subjected to adverse action for such reporting.

#### Technocratic Integrity and Anti-Capture Provisions

(k) **Revolving Door Restrictions.** To prevent the emergence of an insular technocratic class cycling between oversight bodies:

(k-1) **Cooling-Off Periods.** No individual may serve as a member, senior staff, or consultant to more than one Constitutional Oversight Body (including the ARB, IFC, FARB, ETRB, FDCA, and any successor bodies) within a five-year period. Specifically:

- (1) former members of any such body may not be appointed to another such body until five years after the end of their prior service;
- (2) former senior staff (defined as employees at GS-15 equivalent or above) may not be appointed as members or senior staff of another such body until three years after separation;
- (3) consultants who provided more than 500 hours of service to any such body within a three-year period are subject to the same restrictions as senior staff.

(k-2) **Prohibition on Double-Hatting.** No individual may simultaneously:

- (1) serve as a member of any Constitutional Oversight Body while serving as a member, employee, or consultant to any other such body;
- (2) serve on any Constitutional Oversight Body while employed by or consulting for any party with matters pending before that body or any related body;
- (3) provide expert testimony, advisory opinions, or consulting services to parties in disputes before any body on which they have served within the preceding five years.

(k-3) **Private Sector Restrictions.** Members and senior staff of Constitutional Oversight Bodies:

- (1) may not, for three years after separation, accept employment or consulting arrangements with any entity that was a party to a significant matter in which they personally participated;
- (2) may not, for two years after separation, lobby or advocate before the body on which they served;
- (3) must disclose, for five years after separation, any compensation received from entities subject to the jurisdiction of their former body.

(k-4) **Personnel Diversity Requirements.** To prevent homogeneous technocracy:

- (1) no more than two members of any Constitutional Oversight Body may have previously served together on any other such body;
- (2) no more than one-third of members may have prior employment with the same institution (university, think tank, consulting firm, or government agency);
- (3) appointing authorities shall consider geographic, institutional, and methodological diversity in making appointments.

(k-5) **Disclosure and Transparency.** All members and senior staff shall:

- (1) file annual financial disclosure statements including all sources of income, investments, and institutional affiliations;
- (2) publicly disclose all prior service on Constitutional Oversight Bodies, related advisory committees, and relevant private sector positions;
- (3) recuse themselves from matters involving former employers, clients, or co-panelists for three years after the relevant relationship ended.

(k-6) **Enforcement.** Violations of this section shall result in:

- (1) immediate removal from the current position;
- (2) permanent ineligibility for appointment to any Constitutional Oversight Body;
- (3) disgorgement of compensation received in violation of these provisions;
- (4) civil penalties of up to $500,000 for willful violations.

(l) **Universal Application to Governmental Algorithmic Systems.** *Resolves Gap 208 — The "Black Box" (Algorithmic Tyranny), in conjunction with Article III, Section 6.* The requirements of subsections (a) through (k) of this Section apply to all governmental entities — federal, Regional, State, and local — that use algorithmic systems, artificial intelligence, or automated decision tools to make or materially influence determinations affecting the life, liberty, property, or constitutional rights of any person. For purposes of this subsection:

- (1) "materially influence" means the algorithmic output is presented to, relied upon by, or incorporated into the reasoning of the decision-maker, regardless of whether the system is denominated as "advisory," "predictive," or "decisional";
- (2) a decision-maker who approves algorithmic recommendations in more than ninety percent (90%) of cases within any twelve-month period is presumed not to exercise independent judgment, and the system shall be treated as a final decision-maker subject to subsection (h);
- (3) government may not delegate decision-making authority to private entities, vendors, or contractors to circumvent the requirements of this Section; private systems exercising governmental authority are subject to all requirements herein;
- (4) Regional and State entities shall comply with subsections (a) through (j) for all systems within this subsection's scope, with implementation details prescribed by statute within two (2) years of ratification.

### Section 7-B. Mixed Question Review Doctrine

*Resolves Gap 121 — The "Fact-Hiding" ARB Loophole.*

#### Definitions and Scope

(a) **Law/Fact Boundary.** For purposes of Section 7(j) and Section 7(k), and for all proceedings before the Allocation Review Board:

(1) A "purely factual determination" is a finding that resolves an empirical question without determining the scope, existence, or boundary of a governmental power. Purely factual determinations include: population counts, geographic measurements, economic data, revenue calculations, statistical measurements, and similar empirical findings whose resolution does not depend on the meaning or reach of a constitutional provision.

(2) A "mixed question of law and fact" is any determination in which the resolution of an empirical question is determinative of a constitutional boundary, power allocation, or the scope of governmental authority. A determination is "constitutionally determinative" if it directly establishes, denies, expands, or contracts a governmental power, or if the factual conclusion can only be reached by implicitly applying a legal standard to the facts.

(3) The following categories of findings are presumptively mixed questions of law and fact:

- (i) whether a Region possesses "administrative capacity" to exercise a contested power;
- (ii) whether "historical practice" supports or negates a claimed governmental authority;
- (iii) whether two governmental functions are "functionally equivalent" for allocation purposes;
- (iv) whether spillover effects are "sufficient to trigger concurrent jurisdiction" under Article II, Section 3;
- (v) whether a "regional interest" is "sufficiently distinct" to support exclusive Regional authority;
- (vi) whether federal action constitutes a "legitimate exercise" of an enumerated power, where that determination depends on disputed empirical predicates regarding the action's effects, scope, or reach.

(4) A "pure question of constitutional interpretation" is a question that turns entirely on the meaning, scope, or application of constitutional text without reference to disputed empirical facts.

#### Standard of Review

(b) **De Novo Review for Mixed Questions.** Notwithstanding Section 7(j)(3) and Section 7(k):

(1) Mixed questions of law and fact shall be subject to de novo review by the Supreme Court upon appeal.

(2) The Supreme Court shall independently determine whether a determination constitutes a purely factual determination, a mixed question, or a pure question of constitutional interpretation.

(3) The prohibition on reweighing factual evidence in Section 7(j)(3) applies only to purely factual determinations as defined in subsection (a)(1). The Supreme Court may examine the factual components of a mixed question to the extent necessary to resolve the constitutional question embedded within it.

(4) The finality of factual determinations under Section 7(k) applies only to purely factual determinations; mixed questions remain subject to appellate review regardless of their factual content.

#### ARB Characterization Obligation

(c) **Mandatory Identification.** In every determination:

(1) The ARB shall explicitly identify each finding as either: (i) a purely factual determination, (ii) a mixed question of law and fact, or (iii) a pure question of constitutional interpretation.

(2) For each finding identified as a purely factual determination, the ARB shall state in writing why the finding does not determine a constitutional boundary, power allocation, or scope of governmental authority.

(3) Failure to identify the nature of a finding creates a rebuttable presumption that the finding is a mixed question of law and fact subject to de novo review under subsection (b).

(4) The ARB may not embed constitutionally determinative conclusions within findings labeled as purely factual. A finding that is labeled "purely factual" but whose substance determines a constitutional boundary shall be treated as a mixed question regardless of its label.

(5) The Adversarial Review Office, in its Adversarial Report under Section 7(u), shall include a specific assessment of whether each finding in the determination is properly characterized as to its law/fact nature.

#### Challenge Procedure

(d) **Characterization Challenges.**

(1) Any party to an ARB proceeding may challenge the ARB's characterization of a finding within fourteen (14) days of the later of: (i) the determination's issuance, or (ii) the Adversarial Review Office's issuance of its Adversarial Report under Section 7(v); provided that the challenge window shall open no later than forty-five (45) days after the determination's issuance regardless of whether the ARO has issued its report.

(2) Characterization challenges shall be filed directly with the Supreme Court and resolved on an expedited basis, with decision within thirty (30) days of filing.

(3) If the Supreme Court determines that one or more findings were improperly characterized as "purely factual," all constitutionally determinative findings in the determination shall be subject to de novo review. The Supreme Court may review the entire determination to the extent that improperly characterized findings affected the outcome.

(4) The Supreme Court, not the ARB, is the final arbiter of whether a finding is constitutionally determinative. The ARB's characterization of its own findings is entitled to no deference.

(5) A characterization challenge under this subsection, whether successful or unsuccessful, does not constitute the "one appeal" under Section 7(o). All parties retain the right to appeal the merits of the determination on constitutional interpretation grounds regardless of the outcome of any characterization challenge.

(6) No party that files or succeeds in a characterization challenge shall be subjected to adverse treatment by the ARB in any subsequent proceeding. The ARB may not consider a party's prior characterization challenges when making determinations, assigning priority, or exercising discretion. Alleged violations shall be referred to the Judicial Conduct Board and, if substantiated, constitute grounds for removal for cause under Section 7(e).

#### Anti-Gaming Provisions

(e) **Systematic Mischaracterization.**

(1) A "Characterization Pattern Finding" is established when the Supreme Court reclassifies three (3) or more ARB findings from "purely factual" to "mixed question" within any rolling two-year period.

(2) Upon a Characterization Pattern Finding, the Judicial Conduct Board and the Adversarial Review Office shall be notified. The ARO shall conduct an investigation into whether the pattern reflects systematic evasion of judicial review.

(3) During the twelve (12) months following a Characterization Pattern Finding, all findings by the ARB that are challenged carry a rebuttable presumption of mixed-question status. The ARB bears the burden of demonstrating that a challenged finding is purely factual.

(4) No member of the ARB who participated in a determination containing an improperly characterized finding may participate in the ARB's application of the Supreme Court's interpretation under Section 7(n)(3) for that determination.

(5) An ARB member who engages in a deliberate pattern of mischaracterization, as determined by the Judicial Conduct Board, is subject to removal for cause under Section 7(e).

(6) If recusals under subsection (e)(4) reduce the number of eligible ARB members below quorum for application of the Supreme Court's interpretation under Section 7(n)(3), the Chief Justice shall, within seven (7) days, appoint temporary members from among retired federal and state appellate judges who have never held partisan elected office. The Chief Justice shall select from a standing list maintained by the Judicial Conference for this purpose. Temporary members serve only for the specific application proceeding, have no authority over other ARB matters, and their appointment terminates automatically upon completion of the application.

#### Coordination

(f) **Relationship to Other Provisions.**

(1) This section supplements Section 7(j) through (o). Where Section 7(j) and (k) reference "factual matters" or "factual evidence," those terms refer to purely factual determinations as defined in subsection (a)(1).

(2) The No Factual Remand provision of Section 7(m) does not apply to mixed questions. When the Supreme Court determines that a finding is a mixed question and reverses the ARB's constitutional interpretation, the Court shall specify the correct interpretation under Section 7(n)(2), and the ARB shall apply it to the existing factual record under Section 7(n)(3). Where the existing factual record is insufficient to apply the correct interpretation due to the ARB's prior mischaracterization of one or more findings, the Supreme Court may direct the ARB to make additional purely factual findings limited to the matters necessary for application; this exception does not authorize general factual remand or reopening of the evidentiary record beyond what the mischaracterization made necessary. Additional findings directed under this provision shall be based solely on the existing evidentiary record — no new evidence may be introduced — and shall be completed within thirty (30) days of the Supreme Court's direction.

(3) The Factual Finding Limitation of Section 7-A(g) applies independently. A finding may satisfy Section 7-A(g)'s transparency requirements while still constituting a mixed question subject to this section. The two provisions address distinct vulnerabilities: Section 7-A(g) ensures data and methodological transparency; this section ensures constitutional questions are not hidden within factual packaging.

(4) The de novo review standard established by Section 7(aa)(2) for bias-tainted determinations is independent of and cumulative with the de novo review standard for mixed questions established by this section. A determination may be subject to de novo review under both provisions simultaneously.

(5) The De Novo Review Mandate of Article XIV, Section 9 establishes the general principle that courts decide all questions of law de novo. This section applies that principle specifically to the ARB context, where the general mandate's preservation of "factual deference" (Article XIV, Section 9(c)) would otherwise leave the law/fact boundary undefined for power-allocation determinations.

(6) Nothing in this section alters the Parallel Filing Prevention provisions of Section 7(p)-(q). Characterization challenges under subsection (d) are procedural motions within the appellate process, not parallel filings.

(7) The expedited timeline of Section 7(r) is tolled during the pendency of a characterization challenge filed under subsection (d). The tolling period begins on the date the challenge is filed and ends on the date the Supreme Court issues its characterization decision. Upon resolution, the remaining time under Section 7(r) resumes. This tolling does not affect the thirty (30) day deadline for Supreme Court decision on the characterization challenge itself.

### Section 8. National Security Operations Override

(a) **Certification of National Security Necessity.** When Regional exclusive-domain regulations (including but not limited to labor standards, energy planning, environmental rules, or operational requirements) materially impede the operation of federal defense facilities, defense manufacturing, or critical national security infrastructure, the President may certify a "National Security Necessity."

(b) **Certification Requirements.** A National Security Necessity certification shall:

- (1) identify the specific federal defense operation or facility affected;
- (2) identify the specific Regional regulation creating the impediment;
- (3) demonstrate that the impediment is material (not merely inconvenient) to national defense;
- (4) be transmitted to Congress and the affected Regional Government within 48 hours.

(c) **Effect of Certification.** Upon certification:

- (1) the identified Regional regulation shall be suspended as applied to the identified federal operation for a period not exceeding one hundred eighty (180) days;
- (2) the federal government shall negotiate in good faith with the Regional Government for a permanent accommodation;
- (3) affected workers and communities shall receive federal mitigation assistance for any adverse impacts.

(d) **Congressional Review.** Congress may disapprove a National Security Necessity certification by joint resolution within sixty (60) days, which shall terminate the suspension.

(e) **Judicial Review.** Regional Governments may challenge certifications in federal court on grounds that:

- (1) the impediment is not material to national defense; or
- (2) the certification is pretextual (i.e., the true purpose is economic rather than security-related).

(f) **Anti-Abuse Limitation.** This override may not be used to:

- (1) exempt federal contractors from generally applicable workplace safety requirements;
- (2) circumvent Regional environmental protections except where directly incompatible with defense operations;
- (3) impose federal labor standards on non-defense Regional employers.

---

### Section 9. Emerging Technology Domain Assignment

(a) **Emerging Technology Defined.** An "Emerging Technology" is any technology, practice, or capability that:

- (1) does not fit clearly within existing enumerated Federal, Regional, or State domains;
- (2) poses potential systemic risks crossing jurisdictional boundaries; and
- (3) is not adequately regulated by any existing jurisdictional framework.

(b) **Emerging Technology Review Board.** There is hereby established an Emerging Technology Review Board (ETRB) consisting of:

- (1) three members appointed by the President with scientific or technical expertise;
- (2) two members appointed by the Regional Governors (collectively);
- (3) two members appointed by the National Academy of Sciences;
- (4) two members appointed by the Judicial Conference from among judges with technology law experience.

(c) **Petition for Domain Assignment.** Any federal agency, Regional Government, or State Government may petition the ETRB to assign jurisdiction over an Emerging Technology. Private parties with demonstrated interest may file amicus submissions.

(d) **Provisional Federal Jurisdiction.** Upon a finding that an Emerging Technology poses systemic risks that cannot be adequately managed at the Regional or State level, the ETRB may assign provisional federal jurisdiction for a period not exceeding five years.

(e) **Criteria for Federal Assignment.** Provisional federal jurisdiction is appropriate when:

- (1) the technology poses risks of catastrophic or irreversible harm;
- (2) regulatory arbitrage among Regions or States would create "race to the bottom" dynamics;
- (3) effective regulation requires uniform national standards;
- (4) the technology implicates national security or foreign policy concerns.

(f) **Provisional Regional Jurisdiction.** When an Emerging Technology primarily affects inter-state coordination within Regions but does not meet the criteria for federal assignment, the ETRB may assign provisional Regional jurisdiction.

(g) **Transition to Permanent Assignment.** Before provisional jurisdiction expires:

- (1) the ETRB shall recommend permanent domain assignment to Congress;
- (2) Congress shall codify the assignment by statute, which may include shared jurisdiction frameworks;
- (3) if Congress fails to act, provisional jurisdiction extends for two additional years, after which the technology defaults to State jurisdiction unless renewed.

(h) **Anti-Haven Provision.** No State or Region may offer "regulatory haven" status for Emerging Technologies under provisional federal jurisdiction:

- (1) attempts to attract Emerging Technology development through regulatory exemption are void;
- (2) federal enforcement authority extends to such technologies regardless of State or Regional non-cooperation;
- (3) jurisdictions that actively obstruct federal Emerging Technology regulation shall be ineligible for federal research and development funding for five years.

(i) **Sunset and Review.** Each provisional assignment shall include:

- (1) specific regulatory objectives to be achieved;
- (2) metrics for evaluating regulatory effectiveness;
- (3) mandatory review at the midpoint of the provisional period.

---

### Section 10. Vital Federal Operations Protection

(a) **Vital Federal Operations Defined.** In addition to national defense facilities protected under Section 8, the following constitute "Vital Federal Operations" entitled to protection from Regional regulatory interference:

- (1) Social Security Administration processing centers and data facilities;
- (2) Internal Revenue Service processing centers, data facilities, and regional offices;
- (3) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention facilities and laboratories;
- (4) Federal Emergency Management Agency regional headquarters and logistics centers;
- (5) Medicare and Medicaid Services processing facilities;
- (6) Federal court facilities and administrative offices;
- (7) United States Postal Service distribution centers;
- (8) Intelligence community facilities, including but not limited to data centers, analysis facilities, and secure communications infrastructure; *[Added by Gap 183.]*
- (9) Any other federal facility designated by Congress as "Vital" by statute.

(b) **Minimum Operating Guarantee.** Regions may not use exclusive-domain regulatory authority to:

- (1) deny, restrict, or condition utility services (water, electricity, natural gas, telecommunications) to Vital Federal Operations;
- (2) impose labor standards that would require reduction of operating hours or staffing below levels necessary for continuous operation;
- (3) apply zoning, permitting, or land-use restrictions that would require relocation or closure of existing Vital Federal Operations;
- (4) impose environmental or health regulations that materially impair the operations of federal facilities, regardless of whether such regulations are facially neutral or generally applicable. *[Amended by Gap 183 — operational-effect standard replaces "specifically targeting" standard. See subsection (j).]*

(c) **Certification of Vital Operations Necessity.** When Regional regulations materially impede Vital Federal Operations, the head of the affected federal agency may certify a "Vital Operations Necessity":

- (1) The certification shall identify the specific regulation and specific operational impact;
- (2) The certification shall be transmitted to the Regional Government and Congress within 48 hours;
- (3) Upon certification, the identified regulation shall be suspended as applied to the federal facility for ninety (90) days pending negotiation.

(d) **Negotiated Accommodation.** During the suspension period:

- (1) The federal agency and Regional Government shall negotiate in good faith for permanent accommodation;
- (2) The federal government shall offer reasonable mitigation for Regional concerns (e.g., environmental offsets, community benefits);
- (3) If accommodation is reached, it shall be binding on both parties.

(e) **Arbitration for Unresolved Disputes.** If negotiation fails:

- (1) Either party may request binding arbitration before a three-member panel (one selected by each party, third selected by the Chief Justice);
- (2) The panel shall issue a decision within sixty (60) days balancing federal operational needs against Regional regulatory interests;
- (3) The panel may impose conditions on either party to achieve accommodation.

(f) **Anti-Hostage Provision.** A Region may not:

- (1) threaten or impose regulatory burdens on Vital Federal Operations as leverage in unrelated disputes;
- (2) coordinate with other Regions to simultaneously burden federal operations across multiple locations;
- (3) time regulatory actions to coincide with federal budget negotiations, elections, or other politically sensitive periods.

(g) **Emergency Federal Authority.** If a Region takes action that would cause imminent shutdown of a Vital Federal Operation:

- (1) The President may declare an emergency and assume temporary operational control of necessary Regional infrastructure (utilities, transportation);
- (2) Federal operation shall continue only so long as necessary to prevent shutdown;
- (3) The federal government shall compensate the Region for costs of federal operation.

(h) **Distinction from National Security Override.** This section provides protection for civilian administrative operations; Section 8 provides protection for defense operations. The standards and procedures differ because civilian operations do not implicate the same national security concerns, and Regional interests are given greater weight in balancing.

#### Federal Facility Protection

*Resolves Gap 183 — The "Soft Seizure" (Federal Property Hostages). Prevents Regions from using regulatory harassment, access denial, infrastructure neglect, or adjacent land use manipulation to render federal facilities inoperable without formal seizure.*

(i) **Physical Access and Infrastructure.**

(1) **Unimpeded Access.** The Federal Government possesses the right of unimpeded ingress and egress to all facilities protected under this section and Section 8. No Region may close, restrict, degrade, or impose conditions upon public roads, rail lines, waterways, or air corridors serving a federal facility in a manner that materially impairs operations. At minimum, primary and secondary access routes to each facility shall remain functional at all times.

(2) **Checkpoint Prohibition.** Regional law enforcement may not establish checkpoints, screening procedures, or inspection points on access routes that target, delay, or impede federal personnel, authorized contractors, or cargo. This prohibition does not limit normal traffic enforcement applied uniformly to all road users.

(3) **Infrastructure Maintenance Obligation.** Regions shall maintain public infrastructure (roads, bridges, water mains, sewer lines, electrical transmission, telecommunications lines) serving federal facilities at standards no lower than the standards applied to comparable infrastructure serving non-federal users in the same jurisdiction. Deliberate neglect or disproportionate deferred maintenance of infrastructure serving federal facilities constitutes a violation of this section.

(4) **Federal Maintenance Authority.** If a Region fails to maintain infrastructure serving a federal facility at parity standards and the failure materially impairs operations:

- (A) the federal agency shall notify the Regional Government and provide thirty (30) days to cure;
- (B) if the failure persists, the Federal Government may undertake maintenance directly;
- (C) the costs of federal maintenance shall be recovered from the Region's federal transfer payments.

(5) **Digital Infrastructure.** The protections of subsection (b)(1) extend to all forms of digital infrastructure, including internet connectivity, data transmission, cloud services, and encryption capabilities. No Region may impose cyber-regulation, data localization, or encryption restrictions that materially impair federal facility operations.

(j) **Operational-Effect Standard for Environmental and Regulatory Review.**

(1) **Standard.** Any Regional regulation, zoning ordinance, environmental rule, historic preservation designation, permitting requirement, or water allocation decision that has the practical effect of materially impairing the operations of a Vital Federal Operation or a facility protected under Section 8 is presumptively void as applied to that facility, regardless of its facial neutrality or general applicability.

(2) **Rebuttal.** A Region may enforce such a regulation as applied to a federal facility only by demonstrating to the arbitration panel under subsection (e) that:

- (A) the regulation addresses a grave, immediate, and documented threat to public health or safety that cannot be mitigated by alternative means;
- (B) the operational impairment is proportionate to the threat addressed; and
- (C) the regulation was not adopted, amended, or applied with the purpose of impeding federal operations.

(3) **Safe Harbor.** This subsection does not invalidate bona fide environmental or health regulations of general applicability that impose only incidental, non-material effects on federal facility operations. The distinction between material impairment and incidental effect shall be determined by the arbitration panel based on operational evidence.

(4) **Permitting and Construction.** Federal construction, renovation, or expansion on federal land is subject to federal, not Regional, permitting authority. Regions may not deny, delay, or condition building permits, fire certifications, or health inspections for federal facilities as a means of impeding operations.

(k) **Defensive Perimeter and Adjacent Land Use.**

(1) **Security Buffer Designation.** The Federal Government may designate a Security Buffer Zone extending up to one (1) mile from the boundary of any defense installation, intelligence facility, or nuclear facility protected under Section 8 or this section. The perimeter shall be set by the facility commander or administrator based on operational security requirements, published in the Federal Register, and subject to review by the Allocation Review Board upon petition by the affected Region.

(2) **Preemption Within Buffer.** Within a designated Security Buffer Zone:

- (A) Regional eminent domain may not be exercised without prior written federal consent;
- (B) material changes to land use, zoning, or development that would compromise facility security or operations require prior federal consultation and may be overridden by federal certification of necessity;
- (C) utility easements and rights-of-way serving the facility may not be revoked, modified, or allowed to lapse without federal consent.

(3) **Civilian Federal Facilities.** For Vital Federal Operations that are not defense, intelligence, or nuclear facilities, the Federal Government may not designate a Security Buffer Zone but may invoke subsection (i)(4) (Federal Maintenance Authority) and subsection (j) (Operational-Effect Standard) to protect operations from adjacent land use interference.

(l) **Non-Discrimination in Utilities and Workforce.**

(1) **Utility Pricing.** Federal facilities shall receive utility services at rates no higher than the lowest rate charged to any other institutional or industrial customer for comparable service volume and usage pattern within the same jurisdiction. Discriminatory rate classifications, surcharges, or fee structures that disproportionately burden federal facilities are prohibited.

(2) **Workforce and Contractor Access.** Regions may not impose occupational licensing, bonding, residency, or certification requirements on federal employees or authorized federal contractors that are designed to or have the practical effect of excluding personnel necessary for federal facility operations. This subsection does not limit generally applicable professional licensing requirements that apply uniformly and do not disproportionately burden federal operations.

(3) **Water Allocation.** Regional water allocation decisions may not reduce, revoke, or condition water rights serving federal facilities in a manner that materially impairs operations. Water disputes involving federal facilities shall be resolved through the certification and arbitration process of subsections (c)-(e), with the federal facility's operational requirements treated as a prior appropriation right.

(m) **Enforcement and Personal Liability.**

(1) **Personal Liability.** Any Regional or local official who knowingly enforces a regulation, order, or administrative action declared void under this section, or who knowingly directs the degradation, denial, or obstruction of infrastructure, utilities, or access serving a federal facility, shall be personally liable for civil damages, subject to removal from office, and disqualified from holding public office for a period of five (5) years.

(2) **Targeted Fund Suspension.** Upon a finding by a federal court that a Region has intentionally obstructed Vital Federal Operations in violation of this section:

- (A) the court may order suspension of specific categories of federal transfer payments to the obstructing jurisdiction (not the entire Region) proportionate to the category of obstruction;
- (B) suspension shall escalate in scope with the duration and severity of the obstruction;
- (C) suspended funds shall be restored upon certified compliance.

(3) **Relation to De-Escalation.** The protections and remedies of this section operate concurrently with the de-escalation procedures of Article XII, Section 3. Nothing in Article XII requires exhaustion of de-escalation stages before invoking the emergency authority of subsection (g) or the physical access protections of subsection (i) when federal facility operations face material operational impairment.

(n) **Emergency Utility Priority.**

*Resolves Gap 143 — The "Utility Siege" of Federal Assets. Subsections (n) through (p) prevent Regions from weaponizing declared emergencies to deprioritize federal facilities through "administrative load management" by establishing explicit emergency utility priority, intermediate self-provision authority, and a Utility Siege finding mechanism with category-specific emergency-power suspension.*

(1) During any declared emergency under Article XVII-RF, resource scarcity event, or utility rationing program — however denominated — facilities protected under this section and Section 8 shall receive utility services (water, electricity, natural gas, telecommunications, and waste management) at a priority level no lower than the highest priority assigned to any Regional emergency service in the Region's emergency allocation plan, including hospitals, emergency medical facilities, fire stations, and law enforcement facilities. If the Region has not established a written emergency allocation plan with defined priority levels, federal facilities shall receive priority equal to the highest-priority user category. This priority applies regardless of whether the emergency is declared by the Region, a local government, or a utility provider. Priority encompasses both the quantity and quality of service — including voltage stability, water quality, signal integrity, and waste collection frequency — not merely nominal delivery. Where a protected facility shares a distribution circuit, feeder, or pipeline segment with non-priority users and selective load-shedding or service reduction is technically infeasible, the entire shared infrastructure segment shall be accorded the priority level of the protected facility.

(2) A Region may reduce utility services to federal facilities during a genuine emergency only if: (A) the same proportional reduction — in both quantity and quality of service — is simultaneously applied to all users at or above the emergency-services priority level; (B) the reduction is the minimum necessary to address the emergency; (C) the Region has provided the affected federal agency with written notice of the emergency and the proposed allocation plan at least forty-eight (48) hours before implementation, or as soon as practicable if the emergency precludes advance notice — in which case the Region shall provide written notice within twelve (12) hours of implementation; and (D) notwithstanding the foregoing, if a utility provider certifies in writing that maintaining federal facility priority would cause imminent grid collapse, cascading system failure, or loss of life-safety systems, the provider may implement immediate load-shedding or service reduction affecting federal facilities for the minimum duration necessary to prevent system failure — the provider shall restore priority service within four (4) hours and submit an incident report to the ARB within twenty-four (24) hours documenting the technical justification for the emergency action. Any allocation plan that reduces federal facility service below the level provided to Regional emergency services — whether in quantity, quality, or reliability — is presumptively a violation of this subsection.

(3) The prohibition on deprioritization under this subsection applies to all utility providers operating within the Region, whether public, private, cooperative, or municipal. A Region may not circumvent this subsection by delegating allocation authority to a private utility provider, special district, or emergency management authority. Utility allocation decisions made by any entity pursuant to, in response to, or in coordination with Regional emergency orders, allocation directives, or regulatory guidance are attributable to the Region for purposes of this section.

(4) Upon written notification by the head of the affected federal agency that a federal facility is receiving utility service below the emergency-services priority level, the Region shall restore priority within twenty-four (24) hours, or as soon as technically practicable if physical infrastructure damage or system-wide capacity constraints make restoration within twenty-four hours infeasible — in which case the Region shall provide the federal agency and the ARB with a written explanation of the impediment and a timeline for restoration not to exceed seventy-two (72) hours. Failure to restore priority within the applicable period constitutes a violation of subsection (b)(1) and triggers the enforcement mechanisms of subsection (m). The federal agency may simultaneously invoke the certification process of subsection (c), the self-provision authority of subsection (o), and the interim ARB order mechanism of subsection (p)(2)(F).

(5) No emergency rationing program affecting facilities protected under this section shall continue for more than thirty (30) days without recertification by the ARB that the underlying emergency conditions persist and that the rationing remains the minimum necessary to address the emergency. The Region bears the burden of demonstrating continued necessity. If the ARB does not recertify within five (5) days of the thirty-day expiration, the rationing program as applied to federal facilities is automatically suspended until recertification.

(o) **Federal Self-Provision Authority.**

(1) When the ARB finds that a Region has violated subsection (n), or when the certification and arbitration process of subsections (c) through (e) has not produced adequate accommodation within the ninety (90) day suspension period, federal agencies may establish independent utility infrastructure for facilities protected under this section and Section 8, including: (A) independent water supply (wells, desalination, storage) on federal property; (B) independent power generation (solar, wind, natural gas, nuclear) on federal property, subject to paragraph (2); (C) independent waste management on federal property; (D) direct utility contracts with providers located outside the obstructing Region, including construction of transmission, pipeline, or transportation infrastructure connecting federal property to out-of-Region providers; and (E) telecommunications infrastructure including independent fiber, microwave, and satellite connections, with rights-of-way access for connecting infrastructure without Regional franchise fees or carrier-selection restrictions.

(2) Federal self-provision infrastructure may be constructed on federal property without Regional permitting, zoning, or environmental review, subject to the following: (A) nuclear power generation on federal property shall comply with all applicable Nuclear Regulatory Commission safety standards, and the exemption from Regional permitting does not extend to NRC licensing requirements; (B) water self-provision infrastructure (wells, desalination) on federal property is exempt from Regional water withdrawal permits, discharge permits, and thermal discharge standards that would otherwise prevent or materially delay self-provision, but shall comply with generally applicable federal water quality and environmental standards; and (C) all self-provision infrastructure shall comply with generally applicable federal safety standards. Construction on non-federal land (including easements and rights-of-way) is subject to the National Necessity Easement provisions of Section 17.

(3) The costs of federal self-provision infrastructure shall be recovered from the obstructing Region's equalization transfers under the cost recovery procedures of Section 4(n), including the fifteen percent (15%) administrative surcharge. Cost recovery under this paragraph is in addition to, not in lieu of, any other enforcement consequences under this section.

(4) Self-provision authority under this subsection is an intermediate measure. It does not preclude the President from invoking the emergency authority of subsection (g) if self-provision is insufficient to maintain operations, nor does it require exhaustion of self-provision before invoking subsection (g).

(p) **Utility Siege Finding.**

(1) The ARB may find that a Region is conducting a "Utility Siege" against federal property if: (A) the Region has declared an emergency under Article XVII-RF or invoked utility rationing authority, and has deprioritized federal facilities below the emergency-services priority level established in subsection (n), whether through reduction in quantity, quality, or reliability of service; (B) the Region has failed to maintain or has deliberately degraded utility infrastructure serving federal facilities during a declared emergency, resulting in service levels below those provided to comparable non-federal users — including where the Region has manufactured or prolonged an emergency through deliberate deferral of infrastructure maintenance or capacity investment; or (C) a pattern of utility-related obstruction — including two (2) or more violations of subsection (n) within any five (5) year period, whether during the same or different declared emergencies — demonstrates that the Region is using emergency declarations or scarcity management as a pretext for deprioritizing federal facilities. These criteria are disjunctive; satisfaction of any one is sufficient.

(2) Upon a Utility Siege Finding: (A) all utility services to affected federal facilities shall be immediately restored to the emergency-services priority level, in both quantity and quality; (B) the Region's authority to modify utility allocation to federal facilities in the affected utility category during declared emergencies is suspended for the duration of the finding — during this suspension, any utility allocation decision in the affected category that would reduce service to federal facilities requires prior ARB approval; (C) the Region is liable for all operational costs, project delays, and self-provision expenditures attributable to the siege, with cost recovery following the procedures of Section 4(n) including the fifteen percent (15%) administrative surcharge; (D) the personal liability provisions of subsection (m)(1) apply to Regional officials who directed, authorized, or knowingly failed to prevent the deprioritization; and (E) if the ARB has made two (2) or more Utility Siege Findings against the same Region within any ten (10) year period, the suspension under paragraph (B) extends to all utility categories, not only the affected category. (F) **Interim ARB Order.** Upon receipt of a written complaint from the head of a federal agency alleging a violation of subsection (n), the ARB may issue an interim order within forty-eight (48) hours directing the Region to restore priority service pending full investigation. The interim order remains in effect until the ARB issues a final determination. A Region that fails to comply with an interim order is subject to the enforcement mechanisms of subsection (m).

(3) A Utility Siege Finding is subject to judicial review by the Constitutional Court upon petition by the affected Region within thirty (30) days. During judicial review, the priority restoration of paragraph (2)(A) and any interim order under paragraph (2)(F) remain in effect. The Region bears the burden of demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that its emergency declaration and allocation decisions served a legitimate emergency management purpose and were not pretextual. The court shall consider: (A) temporal proximity between the emergency declaration and federal-Regional disputes; (B) whether comparable non-federal users received proportionally similar reductions in both quantity and quality; (C) whether the emergency conditions justified the degree of deprioritization imposed on federal facilities; (D) statements or actions by Regional officials indicating that deprioritization was intended to create leverage; and (E) whether the Region took reasonable steps to prevent or mitigate the emergency through infrastructure maintenance and capacity investment.

(4) A Utility Siege Finding may be lifted when the ARB certifies that the Region has: (A) restored utility services to federal facilities at the emergency-services priority level in both quantity and quality; (B) adopted structural reforms ensuring that future emergency allocation plans treat federal facilities at parity with Regional emergency services; and (C) compensated the federal government for all costs attributable to the siege. If the finding has been in effect for more than two (2) years and the Region demonstrates sustained compliance with paragraphs (A) and (B), the ARB shall lift the finding upon satisfaction of paragraph (C).

### Section 11. Merit System Protection

*Addresses Gap 233: Civil Service Purges ("Spoils System")*

(a) **Career Service Defined.** There shall exist a constitutionally protected Career Civil Service comprising all federal employees not specifically designated as political appointees by statute. No executive order, administrative action, or regulation shall reclassify Career Civil Service positions as political appointments.

(b) **Political Appointment Ceiling.** The total number of political appointees in the Executive Branch shall not exceed 4,000 positions, or 0.2% of total federal civilian employment, whichever is less. This ceiling may only be modified by Act of Congress. Political appointees shall be limited to agency heads, deputy heads, and positions requiring Senate confirmation.

(c) **Merit Principles.** Career Civil Service employees shall be:

- (1) Selected based solely on qualifications, demonstrated competence, and merit;
- (2) Protected from removal except for cause demonstrated through due process;
- (3) Free to provide professional advice without political interference;
- (4) Protected from retaliation for lawful whistleblowing or refusal to execute unlawful orders.

(d) **For-Cause Removal.** Career Civil Service employees may be removed only for documented misconduct, incapacity, or failure to perform job duties. Political disagreement, policy views, or failure to demonstrate personal loyalty shall not constitute cause. Removal decisions shall be reviewable by the Merit Systems Protection Board with de novo authority.

(e) **Anti-Circumvention.** The following actions are prohibited:

- (1) Creating new employment schedules or categories to evade this section;
- (2) Reassigning employees to compel resignation;
- (3) Eliminating positions to terminate protected employees;
- (4) Requiring loyalty oaths beyond the constitutional oath of office;
- (5) Using hiring freezes to force attrition of career staff.

(f) **Transition Protection.** During presidential transitions, Career Civil Service employees shall remain in their positions absent individual for-cause removal. Mass terminations, reassignments, or reclassifications during the 90 days before or after an inauguration shall be presumptively invalid.

(g) **Enforcement.** The Merit Systems Protection Board shall be an independent constitutional body with members serving staggered 7-year terms, removable only by impeachment. Employees wrongfully terminated shall be entitled to reinstatement with back pay, plus damages of 100 to 500 FPUs. Supervisors who knowingly violate this section shall be personally liable.

---

### Section 12. Transition Integrity

*Addresses Gap 234: Presidential Transition ("Scorched Earth")*

(a) **Transition Period Defined.** The "Transition Period" shall commence upon:

- (1) The certification of a presidential election in which the incumbent is not the winner; or
- (2) The President's announcement that they will not seek re-election, if occurring after primary elections conclude; or
- (3) The President's term reaching its final 90 days.

(b) **Pardon Limitations.** During the Transition Period:

- (1) The President may not pardon any person who served in the administration, any family member within the third degree of consanguinity, any person under investigation for matters related to the President, or themselves;
- (2) All pardons shall require countersignature by the Attorney General or, if the Attorney General position is vacant, the Solicitor General;
- (3) Pardons issued in the final 30 days shall be subject to review and revocation by the incoming President within 60 days of inauguration.

(c) **Executive Actions Restricted.** During the Transition Period, the President may not:

- (1) Issue executive orders with prospective effect beyond the current term;
- (2) Promulgate regulations unless required by statutory deadline or genuine emergency;
- (3) Withdraw from treaties or international agreements (see Section 19 for general withdrawal procedures; this subsection provides an absolute prohibition during the Transition Period);
- (4) Declassify information except upon written request specifying national security need;
- (5) Remove inspectors general, the FBI Director, or special counsels;
- (6) Fill vacancies in positions with terms extending beyond the current term, except acting appointments.

(d) **Records Preservation.** During the Transition Period:

- (1) All presidential records, including digital communications, shall be secured by the Archivist of the United States;
- (2) The President and senior staff shall have no authority to destroy, delete, or remove records;
- (3) The Archivist shall have security access to White House systems;
- (4) Destruction of records during this period shall be a felony punishable by imprisonment.

(e) **Transition Cooperation.** The outgoing President shall:

- (1) Provide the President-elect with daily intelligence briefings within 48 hours of election certification;
- (2) Grant transition team access to all agencies within 72 hours of election certification;
- (3) Ensure orderly transfer of control codes, classified materials, and emergency protocols;
- (4) Personally meet with the President-elect at least twice before inauguration.

(f) **Emergency Exception.** The restrictions in subsections (b) through (c) may be suspended during a genuine national emergency declared by joint resolution of Congress, but only for actions directly related to the emergency response.

(g) **Enforcement.** Actions taken in violation of this section shall be void ab initio. The incoming President shall have standing to seek judicial declaration of invalidity. Officials who facilitate violations shall be subject to criminal penalties of 50 to 500 FPUs and permanent disqualification from federal service.

---

### Section 13. Faithful Execution Mandate

*Addresses Gap 248: Prosecutorial Nullification ("Pocket Veto of Enforcement")*

(a) **Mandatory Duty.** The Executive "shall take care that the Laws be faithfully executed" is a mandatory constitutional duty, not a discretionary power. Systematic refusal to enforce a duly enacted statute constitutes a breach of this duty.

(b) **Categorical Non-Enforcement Prohibited.** The Executive may not:

- (i) categorically decline to enforce an entire statutory scheme;
- (ii) issue guidance, memoranda, or policies directing non-enforcement of statutory categories;
- (iii) interpret statutes so as to render major provisions unenforceable;
- (iv) settle enforcement actions on terms that effectively immunize future violations.

(c) **Case-by-Case Discretion Preserved.** Nothing in this section eliminates:

- (i) prosecutorial discretion in individual cases based on specific facts;
- (ii) reasonable prioritization among equally meritorious cases;
- (iii) resource allocation decisions that do not amount to categorical abandonment;
- (iv) decisions not to prosecute based on evidentiary insufficiency in particular matters.

(d) **Distinction Standard.** Non-enforcement becomes unconstitutional categorical abandonment when:

- (i) an entire class of violations is exempted from enforcement;
- (ii) enforcement is conditioned on criteria not found in the statute;
- (iii) the practical effect is that the statutory prohibition becomes unenforceable;
- (iv) a reasonable observer would conclude the Executive has nullified the statute.

(e) **Compelled Enforcement (Mandamus).**

- (i) Upon a finding of categorical non-enforcement, courts shall issue writs of mandamus compelling the Executive to enforce the statute.
- (ii) Mandamus under this section is not discretionary; it shall issue upon finding of violation.
- (iii) Courts may specify minimum enforcement levels, reporting requirements, and compliance timelines.
- (iv) Standing to seek mandamus under this section is granted to: any member of Congress; any State or Region; any person with a concrete interest in enforcement of the statute.

(f) **Congressional Enforcement Trigger.**

- (i) If either house of Congress passes a resolution by majority vote finding categorical non-enforcement of a specific statute, the resolution shall trigger expedited judicial review.
- (ii) Upon such resolution, the burden shifts to the Executive to demonstrate that enforcement is occurring at levels consistent with faithful execution.
- (iii) The reviewing court shall rule within sixty (60) days.

(g) **Reporting Requirements.**

(h) **Impeachment Standard.** Systematic, intentional refusal to enforce duly enacted law, when continued after judicial mandamus, constitutes a "high Crime or Misdemeanor" for purposes of impeachment.

(i) **Regional Application.** This section applies equally to Regional Governors with respect to Regional legislation, with mandamus available in Regional courts and enforcement trigger available to Regional legislatures.

### Section 18. Prohibition on Secret Law

*Addresses Gap 221: Secret Legal Interpretations ("The Dark State")*

(a) **Public Law Requirement.** No law, regulation, judicial opinion, executive order, or legal interpretation having the force of law may be classified or otherwise kept secret from the public. For purposes of this section:

- (i) "Legal interpretation having the force of law" means any written or oral determination regarding the scope, meaning, applicability, or constitutionality of a statute, regulation, constitutional provision, or government authority, that is relied upon, cited, or treated as authoritative by any government entity in the course of official action, regardless of its form, label, or originating office;
- (ii) The authority for any government action must be stated in publicly available law;
- (iii) No government entity may refuse to confirm or deny the existence of a legal interpretation concerning the scope or authority of government action; the existence of legal authority is not classifiable;
- (iv) A legal interpretation that remains unpublished beyond the deadline established in subsection (c) is void and may not be relied upon to authorize, justify, or defend any government action;
- (v) This section applies to the United States, each Region, each State, and all subdivisions thereof.

(b) **Law and Operations Distinguished.** This section distinguishes between:

- (i) **Legal authority** (which must be public): the legal reasoning, interpretation, and conclusion justifying or authorizing government action, including the statutory or constitutional basis, the scope of authority claimed, and the legal conclusion reached;
- (ii) **Operational details** (which may be classified): sources, methods, targets, identities of agents, and specific operational parameters of implementation.

Classification of operational details does not authorize classification of legal authority. At minimum, the legal question addressed, the conclusion reached, and the statutory or constitutional authority relied upon must remain unredacted in any published version.

(c) **Memorialization and Publication.**

- (i) Any legal guidance, whether written or oral, that is relied upon by any government entity as authority for government action shall be reduced to writing within thirty (30) days of first reliance. Guidance not so memorialized may not be relied upon, and any action taken under unwritten legal authority is ultra vires;
- (ii) Any executive component, office, or official issuing legal opinions, interpretations, or guidance having the force of law shall publish such interpretations within one hundred eighty (180) days of issuance;
- (iii) Publication may redact operational details as defined in subsection (b), but shall not redact legal reasoning, the legal question addressed, or the conclusion reached;
- (iv) Each published interpretation shall include a public summary stating the legal question and the conclusion;
- (v) No government entity may rely upon a legal interpretation that has not been published in accordance with this section;
- (vi) During the period between issuance and the publication deadline, an interpretation is operative but must be disclosed to Congress and to any court reviewing government action conducted under its authority, upon request.

(d) **Surveillance Court Transparency.** Any court, tribunal, or judicial body issuing ex parte orders under surveillance authority:

- (i) shall publish all opinions interpreting the scope or constitutionality of surveillance authorities, redacted for operational details as defined in subsection (b);
- (ii) shall be subject to review by courts of general jurisdiction upon constitutional challenge by any party with standing under this Constitution;
- (iii) shall permit amicus curiae participation in cases raising novel questions of law or constitutional interpretation;
- (iv) may not issue opinions interpreting constitutional rights or the scope of government authority that are permanently withheld from the public.

(e) **Congressional Access.** No classification, privilege, or executive determination may prevent:

- (i) any member of Congress from accessing legal interpretations relevant to their constitutional oversight duties;
- (ii) congressional committees from receiving complete legal justifications for executive programs within their jurisdiction;
- (iii) congressional staff holding appropriate security clearances from reviewing classified legal material under the direction of the member or committee they serve.

(f) **Judicial Review.** Courts reviewing any government action:

- (i) shall have access to all legal interpretations upon which the government relies to justify the action;
- (ii) may review such interpretations in camera where necessary to protect operational details;
- (iii) shall not defer to executive branch classification of legal reasoning;
- (iv) may order publication of any legal interpretation upon which the government relies in the proceeding.

(g) **Whistleblower Coordination.** The disclosure of a legal interpretation that is required to be public under this section but has not been published:

- (i) shall constitute a disclosure in the public interest under Article I, Section 23, and the protections of that section shall apply in full;
- (ii) shall trigger a mandatory declassification review of the interpretation, to be completed within ninety (90) days;
- (iii) shall not be prosecuted under any espionage, classified information, or secrecy statute if the disclosure is limited to legal reasoning and does not include operational details as defined in subsection (b).

(h) **Executive Privilege Coordination.**

- (i) Pre-decisional legal advice — including draft opinions, internal deliberation, and attorney-client communications between government lawyers and officials regarding legal options not yet adopted — remains subject to executive privilege under Section 14 of this Article;
- (ii) A final legal interpretation — defined as one that has been adopted, issued, or relied upon by any government entity as authority for action — may not be withheld from Congress, courts, or the public under executive privilege;
- (iii) Upon expiration of the one-hundred-eighty-day publication period in subsection (c), executive privilege may not be asserted as a basis to prevent publication of any legal interpretation subject to this section.

(i) **Sunset Backstop.** Any legal interpretation that has not been published within five (5) years of issuance:

- (i) expires and may not be relied upon to authorize, justify, or defend any government action;
- (ii) any program or activity conducted under the expired interpretation must be reauthorized under published legal authority or terminated;
- (iii) all such interpretations shall be reviewed for possible declassification at least every two (2) years.

(j) **Implementing Legislation.** Congress shall, by law:

- (i) designate or establish the office or offices responsible for redaction and publication of legal interpretations under this section;
- (ii) establish procedures for memorializing oral guidance under subsection (c)(i);
- (iii) establish publication standards, including format, searchability, and public accessibility requirements;
- (iv) designate the specific bodies within the surveillance court system subject to subsection (d).

### Section 19. Treaty and International Agreement Withdrawal

*Resolves Gap 228 — The "Treaty Toggle" (Foreign Policy Whiplash). Establishes procedural requirements for withdrawal from treaties and international agreements, closing the constitutional asymmetry whereby the President can unilaterally undo commitments that required a Senate supermajority to enter. Together with Section 12(c) (Transition Integrity), this section ensures that international commitments reflect democratic consent for both entry and exit.*

(a) **Definitions.** For purposes of this section:

- (1) "Treaty" means any international agreement submitted to and ratified by the Senate under the Treaty Clause;
- (2) "Congressional-executive agreement" means any international agreement approved by majority vote of both chambers of Congress;
- (3) "Sole executive agreement" means any international agreement entered into by the President without congressional approval;
- (4) "Withdrawal" means denunciation, termination, suspension of all obligations, or any action that has the legal effect of ending participation in a treaty or international agreement;
- (5) "Material modification" means the addition, removal, or alteration of a reservation, understanding, or interpretive declaration that substantially changes the scope of obligations under the agreement.

(b) **Senate Consent for Treaty Withdrawal.** The President may withdraw the United States from a treaty ratified by the Senate only with the advice and consent of the Senate, by a majority vote of the members present and voting.

(c) **Expedited Consideration.**

- (1) Upon presidential submission of a withdrawal request, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee shall report the request to the floor within sixty (60) days;
- (2) The full Senate shall vote within thirty (30) days of committee report;
- (3) If the Senate fails to vote within ninety (90) days of submission, the request is deemed denied;
- (4) The withdrawal request shall be accompanied by a published justification stating the grounds for withdrawal and an assessment of economic, national security, and diplomatic consequences, including impacts on Regions whose economies are materially affected.

(d) **Three-Tier Agreement Framework.**

- (1) *Treaties.* Entry requires two-thirds of the Senate; withdrawal requires a majority of the Senate under subsection (b);
- (2) *Congressional-executive agreements.* Withdrawal requires the same approval as entry: majority vote of both chambers, or statutory repeal by the same process;
- (3) *Sole executive agreements.* The President may terminate sole executive agreements unilaterally, subject to the following limitations:
    - (i) No sole executive agreement may have a duration exceeding four (4) years;
    - (ii) Renewal, extension, or replacement of a sole executive agreement counts as a new agreement for purposes of the four-year limit;
    - (iii) Any sole executive agreement that the President intends to continue beyond four years must be submitted to the Senate as a treaty or approved by majority vote of both chambers as a congressional-executive agreement;
    - (iv) Congress may, by law, require Senate consent for termination of specified sole executive agreements before their expiration.
- (4) *Classification by function.* The substance of an international agreement, not its label, determines its classification under this section. An agreement that would require Senate ratification under the Treaty Clause may not be denominated a "sole executive agreement" or "political commitment" to avoid the requirements of this section.

(e) **Emergency Suspension.**

- (1) In cases of material breach by treaty partners, imminent threat to national security, or fundamental change of circumstances as recognized under international law, the President may suspend treaty obligations for up to one hundred eighty (180) days;
- (2) Suspension requires written certification to Congress specifying the factual grounds;
- (3) If the Senate does not approve withdrawal within one hundred eighty (180) days of suspension, obligations resume automatically;
- (4) *Single suspension limit.* The President may invoke emergency suspension only once per treaty per presidential term. Any further suspension of the same treaty requires Senate authorization by majority vote;
- (5) Emergency suspension is judicially reviewable for factual basis; courts may order immediate reinstatement of obligations upon finding that the certification lacked substantial evidence.

(f) **Transition Period Freeze.** During the Transition Period as defined in Section 12(a):

- (1) The prohibition in Section 12(c)(3) applies absolutely: the President may not initiate, execute, or finalize withdrawal from any treaty or international agreement;
- (2) All notice periods, Senate consideration deadlines, and suspension clocks under this section are tolled during the Transition Period;
- (3) No emergency suspension may be initiated during the Transition Period;
- (4) Any withdrawal notice submitted to treaty partners during the Transition Period is void.

(g) **Notification Requirements.**

- (1) The President shall notify Congress and treaty partners at least one hundred eighty (180) days before any intended withdrawal takes effect;
- (2) The notice period under subsection (g)(1) is tolled during any Transition Period under subsection (f)(2).

(h) **Reservations and Interpretive Declarations.** A material modification of a treaty — including the addition, removal, or alteration of any reservation, understanding, or interpretive declaration that substantially narrows the obligations of the United States — requires the advice and consent of the Senate by a majority vote. Technical clarifications that do not alter the scope of obligations do not require consent.

(i) **Implementation Legislation.**

- (1) If Congress repeals the domestic implementing legislation for a treaty, domestic law changes immediately upon the effective date of the repeal;
- (2) Following such repeal, the President shall submit a withdrawal request to the Senate within ninety (90) days;
- (3) Until withdrawal is completed under this section, the United States remains bound under international law; non-compliance during this period shall not constitute grounds for any adverse domestic legal consequence against private parties.

(j) **War Powers Coordination.** During any period of treaty suspension under subsection (e), the authority to deploy armed forces under the treaty obligation exception in Article XI, Section 2(b)(3) is suspended with respect to that treaty. Resumption of treaty obligations automatically restores the exception.

(k) **Indigenous Treaty Exemption.** This section does not apply to treaties between the United States and Indigenous Nations, which are governed exclusively by Article XXIII (Indigenous Sovereignty Preservation) and may not be withdrawn, terminated, or materially modified without the free, prior, and informed consent of the affected Indigenous Nation or Nations.

(l) **Single-Subject Requirement.** A Senate resolution consenting to treaty withdrawal may address only that withdrawal and may not include unrelated conditions, policy riders, or appropriations.

(m) **Judicial Review.** Federal courts shall have jurisdiction to review whether withdrawal procedures under this section have been followed. Courts shall not question the policy wisdom of withdrawal, only procedural compliance.

(n) **Retroactive Application.** This section applies to all treaties and international agreements in force at the time of adoption, regardless of when ratified. Any withdrawal process commenced before adoption that has not been completed must comply with this section before taking effect.

(o) **Implementing Legislation.** Congress shall, by law:

- (1) establish procedures for expedited Senate consideration of withdrawal requests;
- (2) define standards for classification of agreements under subsection (d)(4);
- (3) establish the format and content requirements for withdrawal justifications under subsection (c)(4);
- (4) define "material modification" for purposes of subsection (h);
- (5) establish procedures for treaty-implementation-repeal reconciliation under subsection (i).

### Section 20. Presidential Fitness and Incapacity

*Resolves Gap 229 — The "Mad King" (The Incapacity Crisis). Replaces the 25th Amendment's Cabinet-dependent incapacity mechanism with an independent medical determination process, addressing the structural conflict of interest whereby the officials best positioned to observe presidential incapacity are those with the most to lose by acting on it.*

(a) **Definitions.** For purposes of this section:

- (1) "Incapacity" means a functional inability to discharge the powers and duties of the office of President, whether arising from physical illness, cognitive impairment, mental health crisis, or any other cause. Incapacity is determined by observable functional capacity, not by diagnosis alone.

- (3) If vacancies reduce Panel membership below five, the Chief Justice shall make sufficient temporary appointments within fourteen (14) days to restore a quorum.

(d) **Mandatory Annual Examination.**

- (1) The President shall submit to a comprehensive medical examination by the Panel annually, including physical, neurological, and cognitive assessments.
- (2) The Panel shall publish a fitness summary within thirty (30) days of the examination, stating whether the President is fit to discharge the powers and duties of the office. The summary shall address functional capacity without disclosing specific diagnoses, treatments, or medical records beyond what is necessary to support the finding.
- (3) If the President refuses or fails to submit to the annual examination within sixty (60) days of the scheduled date, the Panel shall automatically initiate an emergency fitness inquiry under subsection (e).

- (2) A vote of two-thirds of the members of both the Senate and the House of Representatives;
- (3) Five of the seven Regional Governors;
- (4) A vote of five of the seven Panel members.

Upon initiation, the Panel shall commence an emergency fitness evaluation and issue a determination under subsection (f) within seven (7) days.

(f) **Fitness Determination.**

- (1) If the Panel determines, by a vote of at least four of seven members, that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of the office, the Panel shall transmit a written declaration to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives.
- (2) Upon transmission, the powers and duties of the office (but not the title) immediately transfer to the Vice President, who shall serve as Acting President.
- (3) The written declaration shall state the functional basis for the determination without disclosing specific diagnoses except as necessary to establish the basis for the finding.

(g) **Nuclear and Military Authority.**

- (1) Upon transmission of a declaration under subsection (f), sole authority to authorize the use of nuclear weapons and the authority of Commander-in-Chief under Article XI, Section 2(g) transfers immediately to the Acting President.
- (2) No ambiguity in the challenge or congressional review process under subsections (h) or (i) shall delay or divide the transfer of nuclear and military command authority.

(h) **Presidential Challenge.**

- (1) The President may challenge the Panel's determination by transmitting a written declaration to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives within fourteen (14) days of the Panel's declaration.
- (2) Upon receiving the President's challenge, the Panel shall reexamine the President and issue a reaffirmation or reversal within seven (7) days.
- (3) Reaffirmation requires a vote of at least five of seven Panel members. If the Panel does not reaffirm by the required supermajority, the President's powers and duties are restored.
- (4) During the challenge period, the Vice President continues to serve as Acting President.

(i) **Congressional Action.**

- (1) If the Panel reaffirms the determination of incapacity under subsection (h)(3), Congress shall assemble within forty-eight (48) hours and decide the issue within twenty-one (21) days.
- (2) Congress may sustain the removal of powers by a vote of two-thirds of both the Senate and the House of Representatives. If Congress does not vote within twenty-one days, or if the vote fails to reach two-thirds in both chambers, the President's powers and duties are restored.
- (3) Congress may not declare the President incapacitated contrary to a Panel finding of fitness. The congressional role under this subsection is limited to sustaining or declining to sustain a Panel determination of incapacity.

(k) **Temporary and Permanent Incapacity.**

- (1) *Temporary incapacity.* If the Panel determines that the President's incapacity is temporary in nature, the Panel shall conduct follow-up evaluations at intervals not exceeding fourteen (14) days. Upon a majority vote finding that the President has recovered functional capacity, the President's powers and duties are immediately restored.
- (2) *Permanent incapacity.* If the President remains under an incapacity determination for more than sixty (60) consecutive days, the Panel shall conduct a comprehensive reassessment. If the Panel reaffirms incapacity by a vote of at least five of seven members, the determination is reclassified as permanent. A permanent determination may be reversed only by a subsequent Panel vote of at least five of seven members finding functional recovery.

(l) **Concealment of Incapacity.**

- (1) Any person subject to the Fiduciary Duty of Candor under Section 15 of this Article who has actual knowledge of facts constituting presidential incapacity under subsection (a)(1) and fails to disclose those facts to the Panel, the Vice President, or the congressional leadership within a reasonable time violates that duty.
- (2) Deliberate concealment of presidential incapacity by the President, Vice President, or any principal officer of an executive department constitutes an independent ground for impeachment under Article VIII.
- (3) Congress shall establish criminal penalties for willful concealment of presidential incapacity by officers and employees of the executive branch.

(m) **Panel Safeguards.**

- (1) The Panel shall receive an independent appropriation sufficient to perform its duties, which shall not be subject to executive impoundment or reduction.
- (2) The Panel shall have authority to issue subpoenas for medical records, testimony, and evidence relevant to a fitness inquiry.
- (3) The Panel shall have unrestricted access to the President's medical records, attending physicians, and medical staff for purposes of annual examinations and emergency fitness inquiries.
- (4) Any member of the presidential medical staff, the White House Medical Unit, or the executive branch who reports concerns about presidential fitness to the Panel in good faith shall be protected from retaliation. Retaliatory action against such a person constitutes an impeachable offense and a criminal violation.

(n) **Transition Period.**

- (1) If an incapacity determination occurs during the Transition Period as defined in Section 12 of this Article, all timelines under this section are reduced by half, rounded up to the nearest whole day.
- (2) If the President-elect is determined to be incapacitated before assuming office, the Vice President-elect shall serve as Acting President upon inauguration, and the Panel shall conduct a fitness evaluation within seven (7) days thereafter.

(o) **Judicial Review.** Federal courts shall have jurisdiction to review whether the procedures prescribed by this section have been followed. Courts shall not review the Panel's medical judgments, the sufficiency of the medical evidence, or the policy wisdom of any determination. Remedies shall be limited to procedural compliance.

(p) **Implementing Legislation.** Congress shall, by law:

- (1) establish the administrative structure, compensation, and support staff of the Panel;
- (2) define the standards and scope of the annual medical examination under subsection (d);
- (3) establish procedures for Panel vacancies, temporary appointments, and confirmation;
- (4) define criminal penalties for concealment under subsection (l)(3);
- (5) establish whistleblower protections under subsection (m)(4);
- (6) provide for any other matter necessary to carry out the purposes of this section.

This section shall take effect immediately upon ratification. Congress shall enact implementing legislation within ninety (90) days of ratification. The Panel shall be constituted within one hundred and eighty (180) days of ratification, and the first annual examination shall occur within one (1) year of ratification.

### Section 21. Federal Civic Baseline

*Resolves Gap 201 — The "Seditious Curriculum" (Indoctrination Trap). Establishes a narrow federal minimum for civic education within the otherwise Exclusive Regional Domain of K-12 education, protecting the constitutional order against generational ideological erosion while preserving Regional authority over all other educational content.*

(a) **Constitutional Exception.** Notwithstanding the classification of K-12 education curriculum and standards as an Exclusive Regional Domain under Section 1(e)(2)(i), the federal government shall establish and enforce the minimum civic education requirements specified in this Section. This exception is narrowly limited to the preservation of constitutional literacy and fidelity; all other aspects of K-12 education remain exclusively Regional.

(b) **Civic Education Requirement.** All educational institutions satisfying compulsory education requirements or issuing diplomas recognized by any level of government shall include in their curricula instruction in:

- (1) the text and history of the United States Constitution, including all amendments;
- (2) the text and structure of this Constitution, including the Regional Federalism framework;
- (3) the principles of constitutional democracy, including federalism, separation of powers, and individual rights;
- (4) the history of the United States as a continuous political community;
- (5) the rights and responsibilities of citizenship, including mechanisms for peaceful constitutional change through amendment, legislation, and judicial interpretation;
- (6) the structure and function of elections at all levels of government.

The scope of the Civic Baseline is limited to constitutional structure, rights, elections, federalism, and the rule of law. No content beyond these subjects may be mandated under this Section.

(c) **Prohibited Curricula.** No educational institution satisfying compulsory education requirements or issuing recognized diplomas may include in its required curriculum material that advocates or incites:

- (1) the violent overthrow of the United States government or any Regional government;
- (2) the unconstitutional secession of any Region or State from the United States;
- (3) the nullification of federal constitutional authority through non-legal means.

(d) **Academic Safe Harbor.** The prohibitions in subsection (c) do not extend to:

- (1) objective historical study of secessionist movements, civil wars, constitutional crises, or failed states;
- (2) critical analysis of constitutional provisions or proposals for constitutional amendment through lawful processes;
- (3) comparative study of other nations' political systems, including those that permit secession;
- (4) scholarly discussion of legal theories, including historical arguments regarding the constitutionality of secession;
- (5) student expression of personal political views in assignments, discussions, or extracurricular activities.

(e) **No Compelled Affirmation.** Nothing in this Section shall be construed to require any student, teacher, or institution to:

- (1) affirm or pledge allegiance to any political position, party, officeholder, or ideology;
- (2) express agreement with any provision of this Constitution as a condition of enrollment, graduation, employment, or accreditation;
- (3) refrain from advocacy for constitutional amendment through lawful processes.

This Section mandates knowledge, not belief.

(f) **National Civic Education Commission.**

(1) *Establishment.* There is hereby established a National Civic Education Commission consisting of nine (9) members serving staggered six-year terms, removable only for cause:

- (i) three (3) appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate; if the Senate fails to act within ninety (90) days of nomination, the nominee is deemed confirmed;
- (ii) two (2) appointed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court from among persons with demonstrated expertise in constitutional law, history, or civic education;
- (iii) two (2) appointed by Congress, one by the Speaker of the House and one by the President pro tempore of the Senate;
- (iv) two (2) appointed by the Regional Governors Association by supermajority vote.

(2) *Independence.* The Commission shall have independent budget authority funded by mandatory spending not subject to annual appropriation. No member may hold any other government office, elected or appointed, during their term.

(3) *Functions.* The Commission shall:

- (i) develop and maintain the Federal Civic Baseline curriculum standards within the scope defined in subsection (b);
- (ii) create model curricula and educational materials available to all institutions at no cost;
- (iii) administer the National Civic Competency Assessment under subsection (g);
- (iv) review compliance and report annually to Congress and the Regional Assemblies;
- (v) provide technical assistance to Regions and educational institutions implementing the Baseline.

(4) *Limitations.* The Commission may not:

- (i) mandate instruction in subjects beyond those enumerated in subsection (b);
- (ii) endorse, recommend, or oppose any political party, candidate, ideology, or policy position;
- (iii) prescribe teaching methods, textbook selections, or assessment formats beyond the Competency Assessment;
- (iv) reduce the scope of the Civic Baseline below the requirements enumerated in subsection (b).

(g) **National Civic Competency Assessment.**

(1) *Establishment.* The Commission shall develop and administer a National Civic Competency Assessment measuring knowledge of the subjects enumerated in subsection (b).

(2) *Eligibility Nexus.* Successful completion of the Assessment is a prerequisite for:

- (i) receipt of federal financial aid for higher education;
- (ii) admission to public institutions of higher education;
- (iii) federal civil service employment;
- (iv) receipt of a federally recognized high school diploma or equivalent.

(3) *Remediation.* Any person who does not pass the Assessment may:

- (i) retake the Assessment without limit and at no cost;
- (ii) access free federal remediation materials and instruction provided by the Commission;
- (iii) achieve eligibility at any age; no person is permanently disqualified by failure of the Assessment.

(4) *Assessment Standards.* The Assessment shall test factual knowledge and structural understanding only. It may not test political opinions, ideological agreement, or policy preferences.

(5) *Language and Literacy.* *Resolves Gap 204 — The "Tower of Babel" (Linguistic Fragmentation).* The Assessment shall be administered in English and shall include an English reading comprehension component sufficient to demonstrate the ability to read and understand this Constitution, federal statutes, and federal court proceedings. Reasonable accommodations shall be provided for persons with documented disabilities affecting language processing. Remediation materials under paragraph (3)(ii) shall include English literacy instruction.

(h) **Enforcement.**

(1) *Public Schools.* Upon a finding by the Commission that a Region's public education system fails to implement the Civic Baseline:

- (i) the Commission shall issue notice of non-compliance with specific remedial requirements and offer technical assistance;
- (ii) continued non-compliance after one (1) year triggers conditional withholding of federal education funding, with funds restored upon compliance;
- (iii) persistent non-compliance after three (3) years triggers targeted federal delivery of Civic Baseline instruction within the Region, limited to Baseline content and funded by reallocation from the Region's withheld federal education allocation;
- (iv) targeted federal delivery is time-limited to five (5) years, after which the Commission shall report to Congress on whether compliance has been achieved or whether additional legislative measures are required.

(2) *Prohibited Content.* Upon a finding that an educational institution's required curriculum includes material prohibited by subsection (c):

- (i) the Commission shall issue notice with specific findings and remedial requirements;
- (ii) if the institution receives public funding and fails to cure within one hundred eighty (180) days, all public funding shall be suspended until the prohibited content is removed;
- (iii) officials who knowingly direct the inclusion of prohibited content after notice are subject to civil liability under the enforcement provisions of Article XIV.

(i) **Update Safeguards.**

- (1) Amendments to the Civic Baseline curriculum standards require approval by two-thirds of the Commission and certification by the Allocation Review Board that the amendments remain within the scope defined in subsection (b).
- (2) The Civic Baseline may not be reduced below the minimum requirements enumerated in subsection (b); only additions within that scope are permitted.
- (3) The Commission shall review the Baseline decennially and publish its findings. Any proposed changes shall be subject to a one-hundred-eighty-day public comment period before adoption.

(j) **Regional Implementation Authority.** Subject to the minimum requirements of this Section, Regions retain authority over:

- (1) all educational content not covered by the Civic Baseline;
- (2) educational methods, assessment formats, teacher certification, and institutional governance;
- (3) curriculum in history, social studies, and civics beyond the Baseline;
- (4) supplementary civic content consistent with subsection (c).

This Section establishes a narrow constitutional floor, not federal control of education.

---

## ARTICLE III - RIGHTS FLOORS AND SUBSIDIARITY

### Section 1. Floors, Not Ceilings

Federal rights and standards establish minimum protections only.

No federal law shall be interpreted to prohibit a Region or State from exceeding such protections unless explicitly stated.

---

### Section 2. Subsidiarity with Enforcement

Authority resides at the lowest level capable of exercising it effectively, subject to judicial enforcement of constitutional boundaries.

---

### Section 3. Hierarchy of Law

(a) This Constitution is the supreme law of the United States.

(b) Within their respective spheres:

- Federal law enacted pursuant to enumerated federal powers is supreme over conflicting Regional, State, or local law.
- Regional law enacted pursuant to enumerated Regional powers is supreme over conflicting State or local law within the Region. The enforcement mechanisms for this supremacy are provided in Article II, Section 25.
- State law is supreme over conflicting local law within the State.

(c) State Constitutions.

(1) State constitutions may not conflict with this Constitution or with the Regional constitution of the Region in which the State is located.

(2) State constitutions may establish protections exceeding those in the Regional or federal constitutions (floors, not ceilings).

(3) In case of conflict between a State constitution and a Regional constitution:

- the Regional constitution prevails on matters within enumerated Regional powers,
- the State constitution prevails on matters within reserved State powers,
- disputes shall be resolved by the Allocation Review Board, with appeal to the Supreme Court.

(d) Local Charters. Local government charters and ordinances are subordinate to State law and may not conflict with State, Regional, or federal law.

(e) Pre-Ratification State Law. State law in effect at ratification continues in force unless:

- inconsistent with this Constitution,
- superseded by Regional law on matters transferred to Regional authority,
- or repealed by the State.

### Section 4. The Unwaivable Core

*Addresses Gap 217: Terms of Service Trap (Contractual Feudalism)*

(a) **Inalienable Rights.** The following rights may not be waived, surrendered, or contracted away by any person, and any purported waiver is void:

(1) the right to access a judicial tribunal for claims alleging violation of rights under this Constitution, including access unimpeded by forum selection clauses requiring litigation in jurisdictions having no reasonable connection to the dispute or the parties — a jurisdiction has "reasonable connection" only if it is the residence of a party, the place of contract formation or performance, or the principal place of business of a party;

(2) the right to trial by jury for disputes exceeding five thousand (5,000) Federal Penalty Units;

(3) the right to petition the government for redress of grievances;

(4) the right to associate or not associate for political purposes;

(5) the right to be free from unreasonable searches by entities acting under color of law or under contract with government;

(6) the right to speak on matters of public concern, to report unlawful conduct to government authorities, and to participate in legal proceedings without contractual restraint;

(7) any right whose waiver would render the person unable to vindicate protections under this Constitution.

The privilege to contract conferred by Article I, Section 18(c)(1) does not authorize contracts that waive rights protected by this section.

(b) **Forced Arbitration of Protected Claims Prohibited.** No pre-dispute agreement may require arbitration of:

(1) claims alleging violation of rights under this Constitution;

(2) claims alleging civil rights violations under federal or Regional law, including but not limited to employment discrimination, retaliation, workplace safety, and wage-and-hour claims;

(3) claims for injunctive relief affecting constitutional interests;

(4) class actions where individual claims are below one thousand (1,000) Federal Penalty Units.

The determination of whether a claim falls within this subsection shall be made by a court, not an arbitrator. Post-dispute arbitration agreements are enforceable only if entered into knowingly and voluntarily, with the claimant informed in writing of the right to judicial resolution.

(c) **Unconscionability and Severability.** A contract term waiving rights protected by subsection (a) or requiring arbitration prohibited by subsection (b) is presumptively unconscionable, unenforceable as against public policy, and severable — leaving the remainder of the contract intact.

(d) **Class Action Preservation.** Waivers of class action participation are unenforceable where:

(1) individual claims are below one thousand (1,000) Federal Penalty Units;

(2) the aggregate claims of the class exceed one hundred thousand (100,000) Federal Penalty Units; and

(3) individual litigation is not economically viable.

Congress may lower but not raise these thresholds by law.

(e) **Adhesion Contract Scrutiny.** For contracts of adhesion — defined as standardized agreements presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis without meaningful opportunity for negotiation — courts shall:

(1) construe ambiguities against the drafter;

(2) refuse enforcement of terms not reasonably expected by the adhering party;

(3) apply heightened scrutiny to rights-affecting provisions;

(4) refuse enforcement of rights-waiving terms that are incorporated by reference rather than stated in the agreement itself.

(f) **Employment Protection.** No person may, as a condition of employment, be required to:

(1) waive the right to report workplace safety violations, fraud, or unlawful conduct to government authorities;

(2) waive the right to discuss wages and working conditions with coworkers or the public;

(3) agree to non-competition provisions exceeding twelve (12) months in duration or of unreasonable geographic scope;

(4) waive the right to testify truthfully in any legal proceeding.

These protections apply regardless of whether the person is classified as an employee, independent contractor, or otherwise.

(g) **Digital Contracts.** Click-through, browse-wrap, and similar electronic agreements:

(1) may not waive rights enumerated in subsection (a);

(2) must provide conspicuous, separately acknowledged disclosure of any arbitration, class action waiver, or dispute resolution provisions — opt-out mechanisms for such provisions that require affirmative mail, in-person, or otherwise burdensome action are presumptively inadequate;

(3) permit withdrawal of consent for prospective (but not retroactive) application upon reasonable notice.

(h) **No Regional Diminution.** Consistent with Section 1 of this Article, Regions may provide greater protection against contractual rights waiver but may not diminish the protections established in this section.

(i) **Savings Clause.** Nothing in this section limits the protections for digital data established by Article IV, Section 10, which shall continue to apply independently.

### Section 5. Citizenship and National Membership

*Resolves Gap 226 — The "Citizenship Void" (Who Are "We"?). Establishes the constitutional definition of citizenship, ensuring that the foundational question of political membership is not left to inference, statutory construction, or executive discretion. Together with Section 4, this section completes the rights framework: Section 4 defines protections available to any person; this section defines the status of citizenship upon which additional rights depend.*

(a) **Citizenship Defined.**

(1) *Birthright Citizenship.* All persons born within the territory of the United States, including all States, Regions, territories, and possessions subject to United States sovereignty, are citizens of the United States at birth. This right applies regardless of parentage, excluding only children born to parents holding diplomatic immunity accredited to the United States or to members of hostile occupying forces.

(2) *Citizenship by Parentage.* All persons born outside the territory of the United States to at least one parent who is a citizen of the United States are citizens of the United States at birth. Congress may establish reasonable administrative requirements for documentation and registration of such citizenship, but may not condition the right itself on compliance with administrative procedures.

(3) *Naturalization.* Congress shall establish uniform rules for naturalization. No person who has been lawfully naturalized may be treated as holding a lesser form of citizenship than a citizen by birth, except as provided in subsection (b)(1).

(4) *Foundlings.* Any infant or young child found within the territory of the United States whose parentage and birthplace are unknown shall be presumed to be a citizen of the United States at birth until proven otherwise by clear and convincing evidence.

(5) *Continuity.* All persons holding United States citizenship under any law, treaty, or constitutional provision in effect immediately prior to the adoption of this Constitution retain full citizenship under this Constitution, without any requirement of oath, registration, consent, or affirmative action.

(b) **Equality of Citizenship.**

(1) *No Distinction.* No distinction shall be drawn between citizens by birth and citizens by naturalization in any right, privilege, immunity, or eligibility under this Constitution, except that the President and Vice President must have held citizenship for at least twenty (20) years prior to taking office.

(2) *Regional Membership.* All citizens of the United States who are domiciled within a Region are members of that Region for purposes of representation, taxation, and public services. No Region or State may impose citizenship tests, loyalty oaths, or residency duration requirements as conditions of Regional membership beyond those established by this Constitution.

(3) *Dual Citizenship.* Citizenship under this Constitution is not affected by the holding of citizenship in another nation. No person may be required to renounce foreign citizenship as a condition of exercising rights under this Constitution.

(c) **Irrevocability and Loss of Citizenship.** Citizenship is a fundamental status that may not be involuntarily stripped, revoked, suspended, or conditioned, except upon final judicial conviction in the following narrow circumstances:

(1) *Voluntary Renunciation.* A citizen who has attained the age of eighteen (18) years may renounce citizenship by voluntary written declaration before a federal magistrate, subject to a ninety (90) day waiting period during which counseling regarding the consequences of renunciation shall be offered. No renunciation shall take effect if it would render the person stateless. No person may be coerced, threatened, or induced to renounce citizenship; any renunciation obtained through duress is void.

(2) *Treason.* Upon final conviction for treason against the United States, following trial by jury and exhaustion of all appeals.

(3) *Unauthorized Foreign Military Service.* Upon final criminal conviction for unauthorized participation in foreign combat operations or service in foreign private military organizations as defined in Article XI-RF, Section 1(e).

(4) *Exclusive Grounds.* The grounds enumerated in this subsection are the exclusive grounds upon which citizenship may be lost. No court, legislature, or executive may create additional grounds for loss of citizenship, whether denominated as denaturalization, expatriation, forfeiture, or otherwise.

(d) **Protection from Exile.** No citizen may be deported, exiled, banished, expelled from, or denied entry to the territory of the United States, nor compelled to reside in or excluded from any part thereof, except pursuant to lawful criminal sentence imposing geographic restrictions as a condition of supervised release.

(e) **Non-Citizen Rights.** Nothing in this section shall be construed to diminish the rights extended to "any person" under Section 4 of this Article or other provisions of this Constitution. Rights denominated as belonging to "any person," "all persons," or equivalent formulations are not conditioned on citizenship.

(f) **Prohibition on Citizenship Conditions.** No oath, registration, affirmation, or other act of consent shall be required to establish or exercise the rights of citizenship. Citizenship inheres automatically from the qualifying conditions of birth, parentage, or naturalization. Government agencies responsible for documenting citizenship status shall treat such documentation as a ministerial duty and shall process applications within time limits established by statute.

(g) **Implementing Legislation.** Congress shall enact legislation providing:

(1) administrative procedures for documentation and registration of citizenship by parentage under subsection (a)(2);

(2) uniform rules of naturalization under subsection (a)(3);

(3) renunciation procedures, including counseling services, under subsection (c)(1);

(4) time limits for processing citizenship documentation under subsection (f); and

(5) transition provisions for citizenship recognition during the period between adoption and full implementation of this Constitution.

### Section 6. Right to Human Review of Algorithmic Determinations

*Resolves Gap 208 — The "Black Box" (Algorithmic Tyranny), in conjunction with Article II, Section 7-A(l).*

(a) **Right to Human Decision.** No final determination by any governmental entity regarding the life, liberty, or property of any person may rest solely on the output of an algorithmic system, artificial intelligence, or automated decision tool. Every such determination requires:

- (1) meaningful review by a qualified human official exercising independent judgment;
- (2) the human reviewer's documented reasoning, demonstrating engagement with the facts of the individual case; and
- (3) the human reviewer's authority to depart from the algorithmic recommendation.

(b) **Right to Human Appeal.** Any person subject to a governmental determination materially influenced by an algorithmic system may appeal to an independent human decision-maker who shall have:

- (1) authority to override any algorithmic recommendation or prior determination;
- (2) access to the algorithmic inputs and decision factors applied to the individual case, as required by Article II, Section 7-A; and
- (3) an obligation to provide written explanation of the appeal decision in terms the person can understand.

(c) **Prohibited Algorithmic Factors.** No algorithmic system used in governmental decision-making may employ:

- (1) factors that would be unconstitutional if used by a human decision-maker;
- (2) correlates or proxies for protected characteristics, as determined by disparate impact analysis;
- (3) inputs the affected person cannot know, inspect, or contest; or
- (4) aggregate group statistics as the sole basis for an individualized determination.

(d) **Retroactive Review.** When an algorithmic system is found by audit, judicial determination, or administrative finding to have been materially flawed, biased, or non-compliant with Article II, Section 7-A:

- (1) all persons whose determinations were materially influenced by the flawed system shall be identified and notified;
- (2) each affected person shall have the right to individualized human review of the prior determination;
- (3) the governmental entity bears the burden of demonstrating that the prior determination was independently justified; and
- (4) remedies shall include reversal, compensation, and expungement of records as appropriate.

(e) **Enforcement.** A determination made in violation of this Section:

- (1) is voidable at the election of the affected person;
- (2) entitles the affected person to damages under the sovereign immunity waiver applicable to the issuing jurisdiction; and
- (3) subjects responsible officials who willfully deploy non-compliant systems to personal liability.

(f) **Technical Standards.** The transparency, audit, bias testing, open-source, and anti-black-box requirements of Article II, Section 7-A apply to all systems within the scope of this Section, as extended by subsection (l) of that Section.

### Section 7. Right to Functional Identity and Digital Habeas Corpus

*Resolves Gap 209 — The "Digital Death" (Identity Revocation).*

(a) **Inviolability of Identity.** The functional ability to prove one's identity, authenticate one's existence, and access one's assets is a fundamental right, distinct from and antecedent to citizenship. Digital identity credentials — including all identification numbers, tokens, biometric records, authentication keys, and digital certificates issued or maintained by government — are the property of the individual, not the state. This Section applies to all governmental entities — federal, Regional, State, and local — and to any private entity operating a government-mandated identity system.

(b) **Prohibition on Civil Death.** No government, agency, or automated system may revoke, suspend, degrade, or render unverifiable a person's primary identity credentials except upon a specific, particularized judicial warrant based on probable cause of identity fraud or severe security threat. The following are prohibited grounds for identity suspension:

- (1) administrative non-compliance unrelated to identity fraud;
- (2) social credit scoring or behavioral rating;
- (3) punitive coercion for lawful conduct;
- (4) failure to pay fees, fines, or taxes unrelated to identity services; and
- (5) any pretext designed to circumvent the due process protections of this Section.

(c) **Digital Habeas Corpus.** Any person whose identity credentials are suspended, locked, or rendered non-functional may invoke the following protections:

- (1) *Immediate Jurisdiction.* Federal district courts shall have original jurisdiction over all claims arising under this Section, concurrent with any other jurisdiction;
- (2) *Twenty-Four-Hour Hearing.* Upon filing, the court shall conduct a hearing to verify the petitioner's physical existence and identity within twenty-four (24) hours;
- (3) *Presumption of Validity.* The burden of proof rests solely on the government to justify the suspension by clear and convincing evidence;
- (4) *Immediate Restoration.* The court shall have authority to order immediate restoration of identity credentials and may not be divested of this authority by statute or regulation;
- (5) *No Exhaustion Requirement.* Immediate injunctive relief is available without exhaustion of administrative remedies. The protections of Section 4 (The Unwaivable Core) and Section 6 (Right to Human Review) of this Article apply as supplementary remedies.

(d) **Provisional Credentials.** During any investigation, dispute, or litigation regarding identity, the government shall issue provisional credentials that legally suffice to:

- (1) retain and pay legal counsel;
- (2) access housing, food, and medical care;
- (3) transact in physical currency and access financial accounts;
- (4) travel within and between Regions; and
- (5) enter government buildings to petition for redress.

Rendering a person functionally non-existent prior to final adjudication constitutes a deprivation of liberty without due process.

(e) **Analog Redundancy.** The government shall maintain a functional, non-digital pathway for identity verification sufficient to exercise all constitutional rights. No person may be denied rights or services solely for lack of a specific digital device, and possession of biometric data may not be made a precondition for the exercise of constitutional rights. The security and audit obligations of Article IV, Section 10 (Digital Papers Protection) apply to all identity systems maintained under this Section.

(f) **Data Portability and Self-Sovereignty.** Individuals have the right to possess an encrypted, offline copy of their identity attributes. The government shall provide mechanisms for individuals to verify their identity independently of centralized government servers, ensuring that server failure, cyberattack, or administrative action cannot erase a person's legal existence.

(g) **Anti-Retaliation.** Use of identity suspension, degradation, verification failure, or administrative delay as retaliation for political speech, lawful protest, journalism, whistleblowing, legal challenges to government action, or any other activity protected by this Constitution is prohibited. Violations of this subsection:

- (1) create civil liability with treble damages;
- (2) subject responsible officials to personal liability; and
- (3) constitute grounds for the criminal penalties applicable to deprivation of rights under color of law.

### Section 8 — Cognitive Liberty and Neural Privacy

*Integrated from Gap 213 — establishes constitutional protection for cognitive liberty and neural privacy against brain-computer interface surveillance, compelled neural data access, and cognitive manipulation.*

(a) **Right to Mental Integrity.** Every person within the jurisdiction of the United States possesses an inviolable right to mental integrity, encompassing:

- (1) **Freedom from Neural Surveillance.** No government actor may monitor, record, decode, or otherwise access any person's neural activity, cognitive states, or mental processes without authorization under this Section;
- (2) **Freedom from Cognitive Manipulation.** No government actor may use any device, substance, or technique to write to, alter, implant, suppress, or otherwise manipulate any person's thoughts, memories, emotions, or cognitive processes, except for medical treatment to which the person has given informed consent; and
- (3) **Testimonial Privilege.** Neural data revealing a person's thoughts, beliefs, opinions, mental states, or cognitive processes is testimonial in character and subject to the protections of the Fifth Amendment. No person may be compelled to provide neural data that would be self-incriminating.

(b) **Compelled Access Prohibition.** No government actor may compel any person to submit to neural monitoring, brain-computer interface interrogation, or cognitive state assessment, except:

- (1) **Safety Exception.** When a court of competent jurisdiction determines, upon sworn testimony establishing probable cause, that a person poses an imminent danger to self or others, a judicial order may authorize a cognitive fitness assessment, subject to the following restrictions:
    - (i) the assessment shall produce only a binary determination of fitness or unfitness for a specified purpose;
    - (ii) all neural data acquired during the assessment shall be processed ephemerally and destroyed immediately upon rendering the fitness determination;
    - (iii) neural data acquired under this exception shall be firewalled from law enforcement and may not be used, directly or derivatively, in any criminal investigation or prosecution;
    - (iv) only devices certified by the Emerging Technology Review Board under subsection (i) may be used for assessments under this exception; and
    - (v) the person subject to assessment retains the right to counsel and to an independent expert observer during any procedure conducted under this exception.

(c) **Warrant Requirements for Neural Data Access.** Access to stored neural data or real-time neural monitoring for law enforcement purposes requires a super-warrant issued by a panel of three Article III judges (or three judges of the Regional equivalent), upon a showing that:

- (1) there is probable cause to believe that a completed felony involving physical violence or imminent threat thereof has occurred;
- (2) the neural data sought is directly relevant to the completed offense;
- (3) all non-neural investigative methods have been exhausted or would be futile;
- (4) the warrant describes with particularity the specific neural data sought, the time period covered, and the cognitive domains to be accessed;
- (5) minimization procedures ensure that neural data outside the scope of the warrant is neither reviewed nor retained; and
- (6) the warrant expires after thirty days and may be renewed only upon a fresh showing satisfying the requirements of this subsection.

(d) **Inalienability in Commerce.** The rights established by this Section may not be waived, contracted away, or diminished by private agreement:

- (1) Any contract, terms of service, employment agreement, or other instrument purporting to require a person to submit to neural monitoring, disclose neural data, or waive protections under this Section is unenforceable and void as against public policy;
- (2) Any person who has disclosed neural data to a private entity retains the right to revoke access and require deletion at any time, and such revocation may not be treated as breach of contract;
- (3) No employer, educational institution, landlord, insurer, or other private entity may draw adverse inference from a person's refusal to submit to neural monitoring or disclose neural data; and
- (4) This subsection operates through contract unenforceability and adverse-inference prohibition rather than direct regulation of private conduct, preserving the public-private distinction while ensuring that market pressure cannot erode cognitive liberty.

(e) **Evidentiary Rules.** In any proceeding before a federal or Regional court:

- (1) **Thoughts and Beliefs Inadmissible.** Neural data revealing a person's thoughts, beliefs, opinions, political views, religious convictions, or subjective mental states is inadmissible, regardless of how obtained, and may not be used for any purpose including impeachment;
- (2) **Motor Commands and Conduct.** Neural data reflecting motor commands, physical conduct, or volitional acts (as distinguished from thoughts about such acts) may be admitted only if obtained pursuant to a super-warrant satisfying subsection (c);
- (3) **Defendant's Right to Introduce.** A criminal defendant may voluntarily introduce the defendant's own neural data as exculpatory evidence; and
- (4) **Prosecution Rebuttal.** If a defendant introduces neural data under paragraph (3), the prosecution may seek access to the same dataset, limited to the same cognitive domain and time period, through the super-warrant process of subsection (c), and the court shall grant such access only to the extent necessary to provide fair rebuttal.

(f) **Children and Incapacitated Persons.**

- (1) No parent, guardian, school, or other entity may consent on behalf of a minor to neural monitoring or cognitive data collection, except for medical diagnosis and treatment by a licensed medical professional;
- (2) No educational institution may require, incentivize, or condition any benefit upon a student's submission to neural monitoring or cognitive assessment devices;
- (3) No employer may require, incentivize, or condition employment upon a person's submission to neural monitoring or cognitive assessment devices; and
- (4) A guardian may consent to therapeutic neural intervention for an incapacitated person only upon order of a court of competent jurisdiction, which shall appoint independent counsel to represent the incapacitated person's interests.

(g) **Cognitive Profiles from Biometric Proxies.** The protections of this Section extend to cognitive profiles derived from biometric proxy data — including but not limited to eye-tracking, pupillometry, facial micro-expression analysis, gait analysis, keystroke dynamics, and voice stress analysis — when such data is collected or processed with the purpose or functional effect of inferring cognitive states, emotional responses, attention, intent, truthfulness, or other mental processes. The constitutional analysis considers the inferential purpose, not merely the data collection method.

(h) **Military Application.**

- (1) This Section applies to all government actors, including military and intelligence agencies;
- (2) Active-duty military personnel may voluntarily consent to neural enhancement or brain-computer interface augmentation for operational purposes, provided that:
    - (i) consent is informed, specific, documented, and revocable;
    - (ii) no adverse career consequence may result from refusal to consent;
    - (iii) operational neural data collected during augmented service is subject to the minimization and purpose-limitation requirements of this Section; and
    - (iv) upon separation from service, the service member has the right to de-augmentation and to deletion of all neural data collected during augmented service;
- (3) Involuntary neural monitoring or cognitive manipulation of prisoners of war, detainees, or any person in government custody is prohibited without exception.

(i) **Institutional Coordination.** The Emerging Technology Review Board established under Section 9 of Article II:

- (1) shall classify devices and techniques capable of accessing, recording, or modifying neural activity;
- (2) shall certify devices and protocols for use under the safety exception of subsection (b)(1);
- (3) may not waive, reduce, or create exceptions to the rights established by this Section;
- (4) shall maintain a public registry of classified neural access devices and certified assessment protocols; and
- (5) shall review classifications and certifications at least triennially, or upon petition demonstrating material technological change.

(j) **Presidential Fitness Exception.** Nothing in this Section limits assessments conducted under the Presidential Fitness and Incapacity provisions of Article II, Section 20 of this Constitution, provided that:

- (1) any neural or cognitive data obtained in the course of a fitness assessment may not be used for any purpose beyond the fitness determination;
- (2) such data may not be disclosed to law enforcement, intelligence agencies, or any entity other than the assessing body; and
- (3) such data shall be destroyed upon completion of the fitness determination or the end of the President's term of office, whichever occurs first.

(k) **Enforcement.**

- (1) **Exclusionary Rule.** Neural data obtained in violation of this Section is inadmissible in any proceeding — criminal, civil, administrative, or military — and may not be used to develop leads, corroborate evidence, or impeach witnesses;
- (2) **Damages.** Any person whose rights under this Section are violated may recover damages of not less than one thousand Federal Payment Units per violation, plus actual damages and reasonable attorney fees;
- (3) **Personal Liability.** Government officials who authorize, conduct, or knowingly benefit from neural data collection in violation of this Section are personally liable and may not assert qualified immunity, sovereign immunity, or state secrets privilege as a defense;
- (4) **Injunctive Relief.** Any person subject to ongoing or threatened violation of this Section may obtain injunctive relief, including emergency orders, from any court of competent jurisdiction; and
- (5) **Criminal Penalty.** Willful violation of subsection (a)(2) (cognitive manipulation) constitutes a felony punishable by imprisonment and is classified as a deprivation of rights under color of law.

### Section 9. Remedial Supremacy

*Resolves Gap 66 — "Regulatory Dumping" via State-Level Deregulation. Prevents States from nullifying Regional standards by eliminating private enforcement mechanisms (tort liability, contract remedies, procedural court access).*

#### Remedial Supremacy Clause

(a) **Remedial Supremacy.** Where a Region establishes a standard pursuant to its enumerated powers under Article II, Section 2:

- (1) States may not enact civil, procedural, or remedial laws that substantially frustrate private enforcement of that standard;
- (2) Regional standards include an implied right of private enforcement unless the Region, by express statutory provision, designates enforcement as exclusively administrative;
- (3) State civil law applies to Regional standard enforcement only to the extent it does not conflict with Regional policy, consistent with Article III, Section 3(b).

(b) **Substantial Frustration Standard.** A State law "substantially frustrates" Regional enforcement if it, individually or in combination with other State laws:

- (1) Eliminates or caps damages for violations of Regional standards below levels sufficient to deter violations, as assessed by reference to comparable Regional penalties or industry-specific enforcement benchmarks published by the ARB;
- (2) Creates procedural barriers — including filing fees, mandatory waiting periods, or shortened statutes of limitations — that make enforcement impractical for typical claimants;
- (3) Permits contractual waiver of Regional protections designated as non-waivable under subsection (g) or under Article III, Section 4;
- (4) Establishes immunity for private conduct that violates Regional standards;
- (5) Requires mandatory arbitration of Regional standard enforcement claims in forums that systematically disfavor claimants, as determined by reference to arbitrator selection procedures, repeat-player advantage data, or the forum's record of outcomes relative to judicial proceedings on comparable claims.

(c) **Savings Clause.** Nothing in this section prevents States from:

- (1) Providing additional remedies beyond those implied by Regional law;
- (2) Establishing reasonable procedural requirements that apply equally to all claims and do not have a disparate impact on Regional standard enforcement;
- (3) Maintaining traditional civil law doctrines — including comparative negligence, contributory negligence, and statutes of limitations — at levels that do not substantially frustrate Regional enforcement.

#### Regional Enforcement Authority

(d) **Direct Regional Enforcement.** Regions may establish administrative enforcement mechanisms for Regional standards that:

- (1) Operate independently of State courts;
- (2) Impose civil penalties, issue cease-and-desist orders, and require remediation;
- (3) Are enforceable through Regional courts or, where necessary, federal courts;
- (4) Impose penalties proportionate to the severity of the violation and the economic benefit derived from non-compliance; penalties that are punitive in purpose or effect rather than remedial or deterrent are subject to challenge under the Excessive Fines Clause.

(e) **Regional Court Jurisdiction.** Regional courts established pursuant to Article IX shall have:

- (1) Concurrent jurisdiction over private claims arising under Regional standards;
- (2) Exclusive jurisdiction over Regional administrative enforcement appeals;
- (3) Authority to apply Regional remedial law regardless of State civil law limitations.

(f) **Federal Court Backstop.** If State courts refuse to enforce Regional standards, apply State law to frustrate Regional enforcement, or otherwise obstruct vindication of Regional standards:

- (1) Claimants may remove to federal district court upon a showing that the State court has applied a law found by the ARB to substantially frustrate Regional enforcement under subsection (j), or that the State court has refused to apply Regional law or has dismissed a claim on State civil law grounds that conflict with subsection (a);
- (2) Federal courts shall apply Regional law, including Regional remedial provisions;
- (3) State procedural barriers deemed to substantially frustrate Regional standards under subsection (b) are preempted.

#### Anti-Waiver Provisions

(g) **Non-Waivable Regional Protections.** Regions may designate specific protections as "non-waivable," subject to a published finding that the non-waivable designation is necessary to prevent the standard from being effectively nullified through private contract:

- (1) Non-waivable protections cannot be contractually waived, even with consideration;
- (2) Purported waivers are void and unenforceable;
- (3) Retaliation for refusing to sign a waiver is an independent violation;
- (4) No person may be subjected to a civil claim, counterclaim, or contractual penalty for exercising rights under a non-waivable Regional protection or for filing a claim to enforce a Regional standard.

(h) **Presumptive Non-Waivability.** The following Regional protections are presumptively non-waivable unless the Region explicitly provides otherwise:

- (1) Workplace safety standards;
- (2) Minimum wage and overtime requirements;
- (3) Environmental exposure limits for workers and residents;
- (4) Anti-discrimination protections.

These presumptions supplement and do not diminish the inalienable rights protections of Article III, Section 4(a) or the social dumping prohibition of Article II, Section 4(j).

(i) **Arbitration Limitations.** Mandatory pre-dispute arbitration agreements for claims arising under Regional standards:

- (1) May not waive substantive Regional protections;
- (2) May not require arbitration in a forum that systematically disfavors claimants, as determined by reference to arbitrator selection procedures, repeat-player advantage data, or the forum's record of outcomes relative to judicial proceedings on comparable claims;
- (3) Must preserve access to Regional administrative enforcement regardless of arbitration;
- (4) Are subject to the forced arbitration prohibitions of Article III, Section 4(b) where the underlying claim alleges violation of constitutional or civil rights.

#### Expedited Review and Remedies

(j) **ARB Review of State Civil Law.** Upon petition by a Region or by the IFC acting sua sponte, the ARB shall review whether State civil law substantially frustrates Regional enforcement:

- (1) Preliminary determination within thirty (30) days;
- (2) Final determination within ninety (90) days;
- (3) State law found to substantially frustrate Regional enforcement is preempted as to Regional standard enforcement, subject to appeal to the Supreme Court.

(k) **Private Right of Petition.** Individual claimants may petition the ARB if:

- (1) State civil law prevented them from enforcing a Regional standard;
- (2) They suffered concrete injury from the enforcement barrier;
- (3) They have exhausted available Regional administrative remedies, or demonstrate that no Regional administrative remedy exists or that such remedies are inadequate to address the enforcement barrier;
- (4) Upon finding of substantial frustration, the ARB may order the State to provide an alternative remedy or authorize federal court jurisdiction;
- (5) The ARB may dismiss petitions that are frivolous, duplicative of pending proceedings, or that fail to demonstrate a plausible claim of substantial frustration, and may impose sanctions for repeated frivolous filings.

(l) **Repeat Offender Escalation.** If a State is found to have enacted laws substantially frustrating Regional enforcement three (3) or more times within ten (10) years:

- (1) State civil law affecting Regional standard enforcement within the same or related subject-matter domain is subject to Regional override;
- (2) The Region may establish uniform remedial provisions applicable within that State for the affected domain;
- (3) Override authority continues until the State demonstrates five (5) consecutive years of compliance in the affected domain, as certified by the ARB;
- (4) If findings span three (3) or more unrelated subject-matter domains, the Region may seek ARB authorization for a comprehensive remedial override, which the ARB shall grant only upon a finding of systematic obstruction.

### Section 10. Dual-Legitimacy Rights-Floor Statute

*Resolves Gap 8 — Rights-Floor Content and Enforcement Detail. Establishes a sub-constitutional dual-consent process for setting rights floors within five enumerated domains, requiring both national popular referendum approval and two-thirds Regional ratification. Floors may be raised by standard DLRS dual consent, and lowered only by DLRS with elevated dual consent (sixty percent referendum plus three-fourths Regional ratification), creating a democratic ratchet that protects minimum standards while preserving Regional authority to exceed them and permitting correction of unworkable floors without requiring full constitutional amendment.*

#### Definition and Scope

(a) **Definition.** A Dual-Legitimacy Rights-Floor Statute (DLRS) is a federal law that sets minimum rights or protections within the enumerated floor domains in subsection (h). A DLRS may not set ceilings, preempt higher Regional or State standards, or reallocate powers beyond floors.

(b) **Floor and Ceiling Distinction.** For purposes of this Section:

- (1) A floor establishes a minimum standard that Regions and States must meet or exceed.
- (2) A ceiling restricts the ability of Regions or States to provide greater protections, broader access, or more stringent standards than the DLRS mandates.
- (3) A provision that mandates a specific method, excludes alternatives, or prohibits stricter standards constitutes a ceiling and is beyond DLRS authority, except that a provision mandating a specific method does not constitute a ceiling if Regions or States may employ alternative methods that provide demonstrably equivalent or superior protection of the underlying right, as certified by the Allocation Review Board.
- (4) A provision that establishes minimum access, minimum protections, or minimum procedural safeguards while permitting Regions and States to exceed those minimums constitutes a floor.

#### Initiation and Ratification

(c) **Initiation.** A DLRS may be proposed by:

- (1) a three-fifths vote of the House of Representatives; or
- (2) two-thirds of Regional Legislatures acting jointly.

(d) **Dual Consent.** A DLRS that raises floor standards or establishes new floor standards takes effect only upon:

- (1) approval by a majority of votes cast in a national popular referendum, administered by Regions pursuant to Article VII, Section 1, with results certified by the Independent Election Commission; and
- (2) ratification by two-thirds of Regions.

(e) **Regional Method (Hybrid).** Each Region may ratify by either:

- (1) Regional Legislature; or
- (2) Regional Referendum.

Each Region must fix its chosen method by public law at least 12 months before any DLRS proposal; no method changes may occur during an active ratification window. If a Region has not fixed its ratification method at the time of proposal, ratification shall require approval by the Regional Legislature.

(f) **Ratification Window.** Ratification must occur within two years of proposal. If dual consent is not achieved, the DLRS fails.

(g) **Cooling-Off Period.** A DLRS that fails ratification may not be re-proposed in substantially similar form for 24 months following the close of the failed ratification window.

- (1) The Allocation Review Board shall determine substantial similarity through a public notice-and-comment process.
- (2) Upon receiving a new DLRS proposal, the Board shall publish the proposal and invite public comment for 30 days on whether it is substantially similar to a failed proposal within the cooling-off period.
- (3) The Board shall issue a written determination with findings within 60 days of proposal submission.
- (4) A proposal is substantially similar if it meets any of the following criteria:
    - (i) addresses the same floor domain and establishes floor standards that, for numerical standards, differ by less than 20 percent from the failed proposal's standards;
    - (ii) addresses the same floor domain and establishes floor standards that are functionally equivalent or differ only in minor procedural details without changing the substantive protection provided;
    - (iii) does not address materially different circumstances or evidence but serves the same specific policy objective through materially identical means, regardless of minor variations in numerical standards; or
    - (iv) when assessed in its totality, achieves a net substantive protection materially equivalent to the failed proposal notwithstanding individual variations in specific provisions.
- (5) The Board's determination is subject to de novo judicial review within 30 days of publication.
- (6) If no challenge is filed within 30 days, the determination is final.

#### Enumerated Domains and Substantive Rules

(h) **Enumerated Floor Domains.** DLRS authority is limited to:

- (1) voting access and election process floors;
- (2) due process and basic civil procedure floors;
- (3) anti-discrimination and equal protection floors;
- (4) labor rights and minimum safety floors; and
- (5) public integrity and anti-corruption floors.

Additional domains require constitutional amendment.

(i) **Ratchet.**

- (1) Floors may be raised by DLRS enacted through the dual-consent process of subsection (d).
- (2) Floors may be lowered by DLRS enacted through an elevated dual-consent process requiring: (A) approval by not less than sixty percent (60%) of votes cast in a national popular referendum; and (B) ratification by three-fourths of Regions.
- (3) Floors may not be lowered, suspended, or repealed by ordinary federal legislation, executive order, regulation, or any mechanism other than subsection (i)(2) or constitutional amendment.
- (4) For purposes of this subsection, "lowering" is defined in subsection (ii).

(j) **Judicial Review.** Courts may review DLRS for:

- (1) procedural compliance with this Section;
- (2) domain scope — whether the DLRS falls within an enumerated floor domain;
- (3) single-subject compliance under subsection (k);
- (4) ceiling conversion — whether any provision constitutes a ceiling under subsection (b); and
- (5) conflict with other constitutional provisions.

All DLRS challenges are subject to mandatory jurisdiction and time-bound review as defined in Article XIV.

(k) **Single Subject.** Each DLRS shall address one floor domain only. A DLRS that addresses multiple domains is void in its entirety.

(l) **Regional Ratification Duty.** Each Region shall conduct its ratification process within 18 months of proposal.

- (1) If a Region fails to complete ratification within this period, the Region is deemed to have abstained.
- (2) Abstention counts neither for nor against the ratification threshold; the threshold is calculated based on Regions that have ratified or rejected.
- (3) A DLRS achieves regional ratification only if ratified by the required proportion of participating Regions and by at least a majority of all Regions. This absolute majority requirement may not be circumvented by abstention.
- (4) If fewer than five Regions have ratified or rejected by the 18-month deadline, the ratification window is extended by 6 months.
- (5) The Independent Election Commission shall publish monthly compliance reports on regional ratification progress beginning 6 months after proposal.

(m) **Emergency Non-Suspension.** Rights floors established by DLRS may not be suspended, waived, or diminished during any emergency declared under Article XVII.

- (1) Any emergency measure that conflicts with a DLRS floor is void to the extent of the conflict.
- (2) This prohibition applies regardless of the nature, scope, or duration of the emergency.
- (3) Courts shall have mandatory jurisdiction to hear claims that emergency measures violate DLRS floors, with expedited review as provided in Article XIV.

(n) **DLRS Conflicts.** Where two or more DLRS provisions conflict:

- (1) the provision that provides greater protection to the individual prevails;
- (2) if relative protection is indeterminate, the more recently ratified DLRS prevails;
- (3) courts shall construe DLRS provisions to harmonize where possible before finding conflict;
- (4) a finding of conflict does not invalidate either DLRS; it determines which provision governs in the specific circumstance.

(o) **Pre-Ratification Review.**

- (1) No court may enjoin or invalidate a DLRS proposal before dual consent is achieved, except as provided in paragraph (5).
- (2) Pre-ratification challenges to DLRS proposals are not justiciable, except as provided in paragraph (5).
- (3) Challenges to DLRS validity may be brought only after certification of dual consent and only within 180 days of the effective date.
- (4) A DLRS that has been in effect for more than 180 days without successful challenge is presumptively valid; subsequent challenges must demonstrate clear constitutional violation.
- (5) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), a court may enjoin a DLRS proposal before dual consent if the proposal facially and indisputably falls outside the enumerated floor domains of subsection (h). Such challenges must be filed within 30 days of proposal and resolved within 60 days.
- (6) For purposes of this subsection, the effective date of a DLRS is the date on which the Independent Election Commission certifies dual consent under subsection (p)(5), unless the DLRS itself specifies a later effective date, in which case the later date governs.

(p) **Timing of Dual Consent.**

- (1) The national referendum and regional ratification may proceed concurrently or sequentially within the ratification window.
- (2) Neither form of consent is contingent on the other being completed first.
- (3) If one form of consent is achieved before the other, the achieved consent remains valid for the duration of the ratification window.
- (4) Certification of dual consent occurs when both requirements have been met, regardless of sequence.
- (5) The Independent Election Commission shall certify dual consent within 14 days of the later of the two consent events.

(q) **Proposal Limits.**

- (1) No more than three DLRS proposals may be placed on a national ballot in any 12-month period.
- (2) If more than three proposals are pending, the Independent Election Commission shall schedule them for successive referendum dates in order of proposal date.
- (3) This limitation does not extend the ratification window for delayed proposals; proposals that cannot be scheduled within their ratification window fail.
- (4) Congress may by two-thirds vote waive this limitation for a specific proposal upon finding exceptional circumstances.

#### Applicability, Standing, and Transition

(r) **Transition Period.**

- (1) No DLRS may be proposed until Phase V of the Constitutional Transition Act is complete and full activation has occurred.
- (2) During Phases III and IV, Congress may prepare draft DLRS for consideration upon full activation; such drafts have no legal effect until formally proposed.
- (3) The first DLRS proposals may be submitted beginning 90 days after Phase V completion.
- (4) Draft DLRS prepared during transition are not subject to the cooling-off period provisions of subsection (g).

(s) **Territorial Applicability.**

- (1) DLRS floors apply to the District of Columbia and incorporated territories.
- (2) Unincorporated territories may opt in to DLRS coverage by resolution of their legislature; such opt-in is irrevocable for the duration of the DLRS.
- (3) Tribal nations are not subject to DLRS unless they consent by formal action of their governing body as provided in Article XXIII, Section 11. Consent may be revoked by the same formal process. Partial consent to specific DLRS provisions is permitted as provided in Article XXIII, Section 11(a)(3). A Tribal Nation that partially consents is subject to the consented provisions for purposes of standing, enforcement, and compliance under this Section.
- (4) For purposes of regional ratification, territories assigned to Regions under Article XX participate through their Region's ratification process.
- (5) Nothing in this Section diminishes tribal sovereignty or self-governance rights.

(t) **Standing.**

- (1) Any person subject to a DLRS floor standard has standing to challenge its validity or seek its enforcement.
- (2) Any Region or State has standing to challenge a DLRS on procedural or domain-scope grounds.
- (3) Standing is not limited by the political question doctrine; DLRS challenges are justiciable.
- (4) Organizational standing is permitted where members would have individual standing.
- (5) The responsible federal agency has standing to enforce DLRS against non-compliant Regions or States.

#### Interpretation and Amendment

(u) **Interpretation.**

- (1) DLRS provisions shall be construed liberally to effectuate their protective purpose.
- (2) Ambiguities shall be resolved in favor of greater protection for individuals.
- (3) DLRS floors establish minimums, not optimal standards; higher standards are presumptively valid.
- (4) Legislative history and pre-referendum impact statements may be consulted but are not dispositive.
- (5) Subsequent DLRS in the same domain shall be construed to supplement, not replace, prior DLRS unless explicit repeal language is included.

(v) **Amendment and Replacement.**

- (1) A DLRS may be amended to raise specific floor standards without replacing the entire statute; such amendments require full dual consent under subsection (d).
- (2) A DLRS may be replaced by a subsequent DLRS in the same domain; the replacement must explicitly identify provisions superseded. The Independent Election Commission shall publish a certified side-by-side comparison of the replacement and superseded DLRS during the pre-referendum comment period.
- (3) A replacement DLRS may not add sunset provisions under subsection (w) to any floor standard that was not already subject to sunset in the DLRS it supersedes. Floor standards carried forward from a prior DLRS retain their non-sunset status.
- (4) Implicit repeal is disfavored; courts shall harmonize overlapping DLRS where possible under subsection (n).
- (5) Technical corrections may be made by concurrent resolution of Congress and two-thirds of Regional Legislatures without referendum, subject to certification by the Independent Election Commission that the correction does not alter substantive floor standards. A technical correction may change only typographical errors, grammatical errors, internal cross-reference numbering, and formatting. A technical correction may not change any word or number that appears in a substantive floor standard, compliance deadline, threshold, penalty, or definition.
- (6) Proposed technical corrections shall be published for 60-day public comment before the concurrent resolution takes effect. Any person or Region may file an objection, which triggers automatic judicial review within 30 days.

(w) **Sunset Limitations.**

- (1) Substantive rights floors established by DLRS may not be subject to sunset provisions.
- (2) Sunset provisions are permitted only for:
    - (i) specific funding appropriations attached to the DLRS;
    - (ii) temporary administrative bodies created to implement the DLRS; or
    - (iii) pilot programs explicitly designated as temporary, provided the pilot program does not itself establish a floor standard.
- (3) The expiration of funding or administrative provisions under this subsection does not extinguish the underlying right or floor standard.
- (4) Sunset provisions permitted under paragraph (2) shall not exceed 15 years from effective date.
- (5) Sunset provisions may not be added by technical correction; they must be included in the original DLRS or added by amendment under subsection (v).

(x) **External Standards References.**

- (1) A DLRS may incorporate external standards by reference only if:
    - (i) the external standard is publicly available at no cost or at reasonable cost with public library access;
    - (ii) the reference specifies either a fixed version (static incorporation) or permits updates (dynamic incorporation);
    - (iii) the reference includes a floor fallback if the external standard is discontinued or becomes unavailable.
- (2) Dynamic incorporation of external standards that would lower floors below the highest level previously in effect under the dynamic incorporation is void; the highest previously effective floor level continues in effect.
- (3) The DLRS Registry shall track incorporated external standards and their current versions.
- (4) The responsible federal agency shall notify Congress and Regional Legislatures within 30 days if an incorporated external standard is materially revised or discontinued.

(y) **Regional Boundary Changes.**

- (1) If a Region splits during a DLRS ratification window:
    - (i) the original Region's ratification status applies to successor Regions until they independently act;
    - (ii) successor Regions may independently ratify or reject within 6 months of formal recognition as separate Regions.
- (2) If Regions merge during a DLRS ratification window:
    - (i) if both predecessor Regions ratified, the merged Region is deemed to have ratified;
    - (ii) if neither predecessor Region ratified, the merged Region is deemed not to have ratified;
    - (iii) if ratification status differed, the merged Region must affirmatively act within 6 months of merger.
- (3) Boundary adjustments not affecting Regional identity do not alter ratification status.
- (4) For DLRS already in effect, boundary changes do not affect applicability; DLRS floors apply to all territory within recognized Regions.

(z) **Minority Rights Protection.**

- (1) No DLRS floor standard shall be construed or applied to:
    - (i) diminish existing constitutional protections for discrete and insular minorities;
    - (ii) authorize discrimination prohibited elsewhere in this Constitution;
    - (iii) prevent Regions from providing heightened protections to vulnerable populations.
- (2) Courts reviewing DLRS challenges shall apply heightened scrutiny where a floor standard is alleged to have disparate impact on constitutionally protected groups.
- (3) The pre-referendum impact statement shall include analysis of potential disparate impacts on protected groups.
- (4) If a court finds that a DLRS provision has unjustified disparate impact, it may sever that provision while preserving the remainder of the DLRS.

(aa) **Treaty Obligations.**

- (1) DLRS floor standards shall be construed consistently with binding treaty obligations of the United States where possible.
- (2) Where a treaty establishes a higher standard than a DLRS floor, the treaty standard governs.
- (3) Where a DLRS floor establishes a higher standard than a treaty minimum, the DLRS floor governs domestically.
- (4) Nothing in this Section affects the constitutional status of treaties or the treaty-making powers as provided in this Constitution.
- (5) A DLRS may not be used to circumvent treaty obligations or to effectively withdraw from treaty commitments without following constitutional procedures.

#### Administration and Transparency

(bb) **DLRS Registry.**

- (1) The Independent Election Commission shall maintain a public DLRS Registry containing:
    - (i) all proposed, pending, ratified, and failed DLRS;
    - (ii) full text, ratification history, and effective dates;
    - (iii) indexed standard values and adjustment history;
    - (iv) compliance status by Region as certified under each DLRS.
- (2) The Registry shall be publicly accessible online at no cost.
- (3) Official DLRS text is the version in the Registry; any conflict with other publications is resolved in favor of the Registry.
- (4) The Registry shall be updated within 7 days of any change in status.

(cc) **Turnout Disclosure.**

- (1) The Independent Election Commission shall publish, alongside referendum results:
    - (i) total votes cast;
    - (ii) turnout as percentage of registered voters;
    - (iii) turnout as percentage of voting-eligible population;
    - (iv) turnout compared to most recent federal election.
- (2) Low turnout does not invalidate a DLRS that achieves the required approval threshold under subsection (d)(1) or (i)(2)(A).
- (3) Congress may commission studies on turnout patterns but may not impose retroactive turnout requirements.
- (4) If turnout falls below 25 percent of voting-eligible population, the Independent Election Commission shall include in its certification a notation of low turnout and a recommendation for civic engagement measures.

(dd) **Referendum Administration.**

- (1) National referendums under subsection (d)(1) shall be administered by Regions pursuant to Article VII, Section 1.
- (2) DLRS referendums shall be scheduled to coincide with regularly scheduled federal elections to minimize costs and maximize turnout. A standalone referendum date may be designated by the Independent Election Commission only upon certification that no federal election will occur within the ratification window.
- (3) The federal government shall reimburse Regions for the reasonable costs of DLRS referendum administration within 90 days of certification. Referendum administration costs are mandatory spending not subject to annual discretionary appropriation. If Congress fails to appropriate funds within 90 days, the obligation is enforceable under Article XXI, Section 2-A.
- (4) Referendum administration costs shall be appropriated from general revenues and may not be charged against DLRS-specific funding.

(ee) **Ballot Language.**

- (1) The Independent Election Commission shall prepare official ballot language for each DLRS referendum.
- (2) Ballot language shall be neutral in tone and framing, presenting the DLRS without advocacy for or against, and shall:
    - (i) summarize the DLRS in plain language not exceeding 150 words;
    - (ii) accurately describe the floor standards being established;
    - (iii) note that higher regional or state standards are permitted;
    - (iv) identify the floor domain addressed.
- (3) Proposed ballot language shall be published for 30-day public comment before finalization.
- (4) Legal challenges to ballot language accuracy or neutrality must be filed within 30 days of finalization and resolved within 30 days.
- (5) Ballot language shall be available in all languages required for federal elections in each Region.

(ff) **Referendum Campaign Finance.**

- (1) Campaign finance disclosure requirements applicable to federal elections apply to DLRS referendum campaigns.
- (2) Foreign nationals and foreign governments may not contribute to or spend on DLRS referendum campaigns.
- (3) The Independent Election Commission shall maintain a public database of referendum campaign contributions and expenditures exceeding $10,000.
- (4) Nothing in this Section limits individual speech about DLRS proposals.
- (5) Coordination between referendum campaigns and foreign actors is prohibited and subject to penalties under federal election law.

#### Enforcement and Coordination

(gg) **Enforcement Authority.**

- (1) Rights floors established pursuant to this Section are self-executing and enforceable in all federal and Regional courts.
- (2) For all purposes of this Constitution, including but not limited to Article II, Section 3-A, rights floors established through the dual-consent process of this Section have the same constitutional status as rights established by constitutional amendment. Article II, Section 3-A(a)(iii) applies. Congressional enforcement of DLRS floor standards is not subject to the prerequisites of Article II, Section 3-A(c), provided the enforcement action is limited to the scope of the specific DLRS floor standard.
- (3) This provision does not expand congressional enforcement authority beyond the scope of the specific DLRS floor standard established through the dual-consent process.
- (4) The enforcement mechanisms established in the DLRS implementing statute (compliance certification, federal enforcement, enforcement escalation) operate as provided therein. Congress may not amend or repeal enforcement mechanisms of a DLRS implementing statute in a manner that diminishes the enforceability of floor standards without the dual-consent process of subsection (d).
- (5) Compliance with DLRS floor standards shall be assessed based on effective implementation, not merely formal legal conformity. A floor standard is not met if systemic resource deprivation, administrative obstruction, or practical inaccessibility renders the standard non-operative for a significant portion of the protected population.
- (6) Appropriations necessary for the administration and enforcement of DLRS, including the DLRS Registry, compliance certification, and enforcement escalation, are mandatory spending not subject to annual discretionary appropriation. Failure to appropriate funds for DLRS administration and enforcement constitutes obstruction of constitutional processes under Article XXI, Section 2-A.

(hh) **Relationship to Constitutional Minimums.**

- (1) DLRS floor standards supplement and do not replace the constitutional labor and safety minimums established in Article II, Section 4(h)-(k).
- (2) Where a DLRS floor standard and a constitutional minimum address the same subject matter, the higher standard governs. Where a DLRS floor standard and a constitutional minimum interact without directly conflicting, both shall be given full effect; neither shall be construed to narrow or condition the other.
- (3) DLRS authority in the labor rights domain (subsection (h)(4)) may not be construed to lower, narrow, or reclassify the constitutional minimums of Article II, Section 4(h)-(k), which are permanent and exempt from variance. DLRS may not define terms in a manner that narrows the scope of constitutional minimums.
- (4) A DLRS floor standard that exceeds a constitutional minimum of Article II, Section 4(h)-(k) is subject to the ratchet of subsection (i) with respect to the DLRS-established increment. The constitutional minimum itself remains governed by Article II, Section 4(k)(1) and is not affected by the DLRS ratchet.

(ii) **Definition of Lowering.**

- (1) For purposes of this Section, "lowering" includes any of the following relative to an existing DLRS floor standard:
    - (i) reduction in any numerical standard;
    - (ii) narrowing of the scope of protected persons, protected activities, or protected categories;
    - (iii) expansion of exemptions, exclusions, or exceptions;
    - (iv) contraction of coverage, including geographic, temporal, or subject-matter contraction;
    - (v) narrowing of definitions used in the floor standard;
    - (vi) reduction in available remedies or enforcement mechanisms;
    - (vii) any other change that, assessed by its practical effect, diminishes the protection afforded to individuals by the floor standard.
- (2) The determination of whether a change constitutes "lowering" shall be based on practical effect, not formal characterization.
- (3) A replacement DLRS under subsection (v)(2) that narrows any existing floor standard relative to the DLRS it supersedes is subject to the elevated dual-consent requirement of subsection (i)(2), not the standard dual-consent process.

(jj) **Severability.** If any subsection, paragraph, or provision of this Section is held invalid, the remaining provisions continue in full force and effect. Invalidity of a provision as applied to one Region or circumstance does not affect its validity in other Regions or circumstances.

## Design Rationale

### Why Structured Concurrency Rather Than Pure Non-Concurrency?

The original design used exclusive domain assignment to prevent jurisdictional ambiguity. However, modern governance is inherently interdependent—healthcare crosses with labor and commerce, environment with energy and trade. Pure non-concurrency generates constant boundary litigation as every policy touches multiple domains.

The Structured Concurrency Framework (Gap 269) resolves this by:

- **Maintaining true exclusives:** Core sovereignty functions (defense, currency, diplomacy) and genuinely local matters (zoning, family law, K-12) remain exclusive
- **Acknowledging inherent overlap:** Eight structured concurrent domains receive explicit floor/ceiling treatment
- **Federal floors, not mandates:** Federal authority in concurrent domains is limited to minimum standards addressing cross-regional spillover
- **Regional primary authority:** Regions have primary regulatory authority within concurrent domains
- **Dispute prevention:** Pre-enactment consultation, safe harbors, and expedited certification reduce litigation
- **Litigation management:** Filing limits and frivolousness penalties prevent strategic flooding

This approach preserves the benefits of clear jurisdiction while avoiding the rigidity that generated 500+ disputes annually in pure non-concurrency models.

### Why Rights Floors Rather Than Uniform Rights?

Uniform national rights prevent Regional policy variation and force national political battles over every rights question. Rights floors:

- establish minimum protections everywhere
- allow Regions to exceed minimums based on local preferences
- reduce political stakes of federal elections
- preserve policy diversity

### Why Subsidiarity?

Centralized authority creates:

- democratic distance (voters far from decision-makers)
- one-size-fits-all policies for diverse populations
- winner-take-all political dynamics
- authoritarian consolidation risk

Subsidiarity keeps decisions close to affected populations while ensuring baseline protections through judicial enforcement.

### Why "Any Person" Rather Than "Citizen" in the Unwaivable Core?

Section 4 uses "any person" rather than "citizen" deliberately. Adhesion contracts, forced arbitration clauses, and class action waivers affect all persons within U.S. jurisdiction — non-citizen workers, lawful residents, tourists, and visitors are equally subject to terms-of-service extraction. Limiting protection to citizens would create a two-tier rights regime where non-citizens face even greater contractual coercion. The Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses already protect "any person," and Section 4 follows this established scope.

### Why Functional Language in the Prohibition on Secret Law?

Section 18 deliberately avoids naming specific statutory bodies (the Office of Legal Counsel, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court). Constitutional text that names statutory bodies is brittle — Congress can rename an office to escape coverage. Sections 13-17 consistently use functional language ("The Executive," "Inspectors General within the Executive Branch"), and Section 18 follows this pattern: "any executive component, office, or official issuing legal opinions" and "any court, tribunal, or judicial body issuing ex parte orders under surveillance authority." Named bodies are designated in implementing legislation under Section 18(j).

### Why a Hybrid Self-Execution Model for Secret Law?

Section 18 resolves the tension between immediate invalidity and operational reality through a three-layer approach: (1) During the 180-day publication window, interpretations are operative but must be disclosed to Congress and courts on request (§18(c)(vi)); (2) After 180 days, unpublished interpretations are void (§18(a)(iv)); (3) A 5-year hard sunset catches any interpretation that evades the 180-day mandate through relabeling or other gaming (§18(i)). This avoids both the recklessness of instant invalidity (which could destabilize active intelligence programs overnight) and the permissiveness of a purely challenge-based model (which founders on the standing paradox: who challenges law they don't know exists?).

### Why a Constitutional Citizenship Definition?

The constitution references "citizens" in at least six provisions across four articles (Article I §8 freedom of movement, Article I §21 suffrage, Article VII §1(d) franchise, Article XIV-RF §5 standing, Article IV §6 census, Article XI-RF §1(e) denaturalization) but never defines who is a citizen. If a new constitutional framework supersedes the existing Constitution without explicitly incorporating the Fourteenth Amendment's citizenship clause, the foundational question — who is a citizen? — becomes legally ambiguous. Section 5 closes this void by constitutionalizing birthright citizenship (jus soli), citizenship by parentage (jus sanguinis), and the continuity of all existing citizenship. Together with Section 4 ("any person" protections), Section 5 completes the rights framework: Section 4 defines protections available to all persons; Section 5 defines the status of citizenship upon which additional rights depend.

### Why Equal Citizenship and the Twenty-Year Requirement?

The current Constitution's "natural-born citizen" requirement for the Presidency creates a two-tier citizenship system that is incompatible with Section 5(b)(1)'s principle that no distinction shall be drawn between citizens by birth and by naturalization. Rather than preserving this anachronism, Section 5(b)(1) replaces it with a twenty-year citizenship duration requirement — ensuring that presidential candidates have deep roots in the polity without creating a permanent second class of citizens who can never hold the highest office regardless of their commitment to the nation.

### Why Three Narrow Grounds for Loss of Citizenship?

Section 5(c) limits citizenship loss to three grounds: voluntary renunciation, treason conviction, and unauthorized foreign military service conviction. The third ground harmonizes with Article XI-RF §1(e), which previously stripped citizenship automatically for foreign military service violations. Section 5(c)(3) requires final criminal conviction rather than administrative determination — ensuring due process while preserving the deterrent against mercenary service. The exclusive-grounds clause (§5(c)(4)) prevents any court, legislature, or executive from creating additional denaturalization categories, whether denominated as expatriation, forfeiture, or otherwise.

### Why Explicit Jus Sanguinis?

Under current law, children born abroad to U.S. citizen parents receive citizenship by statute (8 U.S.C. §1401), not by constitutional right. This means Congress could theoretically revoke jus sanguinis citizenship for future births. Section 5(a)(2) elevates this to a constitutional right while preserving congressional authority over administrative procedures — ensuring that no American family serving abroad, in the military, or in diplomatic service risks having their children's citizenship depend on the whims of a future Congress.

### Why Senate Consent for Treaty Withdrawal?

The Constitution requires a two-thirds Senate supermajority to enter treaties but is silent on withdrawal. Courts have never definitively resolved whether the President can unilaterally exit treaties, and practice has drifted toward executive unilateralism (Paris Climate Agreement, Iran nuclear deal, INF Treaty, Open Skies Treaty). Section 19 restores the democratic consent principle: if broad consensus is needed to bind the nation, some level of democratic consent should be needed to unbind it. Simple majority (rather than two-thirds) for exit avoids creating "zombie treaties" that a majority opposes but a minority blocks from termination, while the emergency suspension mechanism handles genuine crises without bypassing the Senate.

### Why a Three-Tier Agreement Framework?

Modern international commitments take three forms — treaties (Senate ratification), congressional-executive agreements (bicameral approval), and sole executive agreements (President alone) — but the Constitution addresses only the first. Section 19(d) closes this gap by applying withdrawal constraints matched to the entry instrument. The four-year hard cap on sole executive agreements prevents Presidents from using the "executive agreement" label to create durable commitments that bypass the Senate, while ensuring that agreements intended to outlast an administration receive congressional endorsement.

### Why Exempt Indigenous Treaties?

Treaties between the United States and Indigenous Nations are sui generis — they are domestic compacts between a sovereign and dependent nations, not foreign affairs instruments. Article XXIII already requires free, prior, and informed consent for any action that diminishes tribal sovereignty or modifies treaty rights. Section 19(k) makes explicit that this general withdrawal framework does not override those protections, preventing any argument that the new treaty withdrawal process could be used to unilaterally terminate indigenous treaty obligations.

### Why a Single-Suspension Limit?

Without an explicit limit, a President could perpetually suspend a treaty through serial 180-day certifications, achieving de facto withdrawal without ever obtaining Senate consent. Section 19(e)(4) limits emergency suspension to once per treaty per presidential term, forcing the President to seek Senate consent if the situation persists beyond six months. This preserves executive flexibility for genuine emergencies while closing the serial-suspension loophole.

### Why an Independent Medical Panel for Presidential Incapacity?

The 25th Amendment's Section 4 places the incapacity determination in the hands of the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet — political appointees selected for loyalty who serve at the President's pleasure. This creates a structural conflict of interest: the people best positioned to observe incapacity are the people with the most to lose by acting on it. No Cabinet has ever invoked Section 4 despite documented incapacity (Woodrow Wilson was incapacitated for 18 months while his wife effectively governed; Reagan aides debated invoking but declined). Section 20 replaces this loyalty-dependent mechanism with an independent medical panel whose members have no career stake in the outcome, transforming the determination from a political judgment into a professional medical one.

### Why Seven Members Appointed by NAM, SCOTUS, and Congress?

Three appointing authorities prevent any single branch from controlling the Panel. The National Academy of Medicine (three members) provides medical credibility and professional standards; the Chief Justice (two members) provides institutional independence parallel to the Judicial Conference's role in judicial incapacity; and congressional leaders (two members, bipartisan) provide democratic accountability. The Surgeon General is excluded because as a uniformed military officer subordinate to the President who serves at the President's pleasure, the same loyalty-dependency that renders the Cabinet mechanism ineffective would compromise the Panel's independence. The seven-member odd number avoids ties while remaining small enough for rapid deliberation during emergencies.

### Why Chief Justice Vacancy Appointments?

Senate delay or refusal to confirm Panel members could be weaponized to leave the Panel without a quorum, creating a structural immunity from incapacity determination. The Chief Justice's temporary appointment power, modeled on similar vacancy-filling mechanisms elsewhere in the judiciary, ensures the Panel remains functional regardless of confirmation politics. The ninety-day trigger is long enough to give the Senate genuine opportunity to act but short enough to prevent deliberate paralysis.

### Why Acting President Restrictions?

Without restrictions, the Vice President serving as Acting President could consolidate power by pardoning the incapacitated President (extinguishing future accountability), removing Panel members (undermining future determinations), or dismissing medical staff (destroying evidence of incapacity). These restrictions close the "Acting President coup" gaming vector while preserving all other executive powers needed to govern effectively during the incapacity period.

### Why Immediate Nuclear Transfer?

Nuclear command authority cannot be divided or ambiguous. During the fourteen-day challenge period, having two individuals each claiming nuclear authority creates dangerous uncertainty that adversaries could exploit. Section 20(g) adopts a simple principle: whoever holds the powers and duties holds all the powers and duties, including nuclear authorization under Article XI, Section 2(g). This eliminates the "nuclear limbo" gaming vector entirely.

### Why Procedural-Only Judicial Review for Incapacity?

Allowing courts to review the Panel's medical judgments would transform incapacity determinations into adversarial litigation, with the President's legal team challenging medical evidence while the country operates under dual authority. Procedural review ensures the process was followed correctly without turning the judiciary into a super-medical panel. This parallels the judicial non-review of the Judicial Conference's own incapacity determinations under Article XIV and matches the procedural-only review applied to treaty withdrawal under Section 19(m).

### Why a Dual Track for Temporary and Permanent Incapacity?

A President recovering from surgery needs a rapid clearance mechanism (fourteen-day follow-up evaluations), while a President with progressive cognitive decline needs a permanent removal pathway (sixty-day threshold plus supermajority reaffirmation). Without the dual track, temporary incapacity would either be under-treated (no rapid return) or over-treated (premature permanent removal), and permanent incapacity would lack the elevated threshold that its finality demands. The sixty-day reclassification trigger provides a clear boundary between the two tracks.

### Section 22. Celestial and Orbital Sovereignty

*Resolves Gap 210 — The "Orbital Rogue" (Space Sovereignty). Establishes exclusive federal jurisdiction over all extra-atmospheric activities, preventing Regions from acquiring orbital capabilities that could enable surveillance, military advantage, or information independence outside federal authority.*

(a) **Federal Exclusivity.** The jurisdiction of the Federal Government is exclusive regarding all activities extending beyond the controlled airspace of the United States. No Region may claim sovereignty over orbital paths, celestial bodies, or the electromagnetic spectrum used for space communication.

(b) **The Launch Monopoly.** While Regions and private entities may own and operate terrestrial spaceport infrastructure, the authority to license, approve, and command a launch into space is exclusively Federal. No object may leave the atmosphere without a specific Federal warrant.

(c) **Prohibition on Regional Weaponization.** Regions are strictly prohibited from developing, deploying, or controlling orbital assets with kinetic, directed energy, or electronic warfare capabilities. Any Regional asset found in orbit with undeclared military capabilities is subject to immediate Federal seizure or neutralization.

(d) **Treaty Compliance and Liability.** The Federal Government bears sole international liability for all space activities originating from the United States, pursuant to the Outer Space Treaty and international law. Therefore, Federal safety and liability standards preempt all Regional regulations regarding spaceflight.

(e) **Common Benefit.** Resources derived from celestial bodies or orbital commerce shall be taxed and regulated federally, ensuring that the strategic benefits of space access accrue to the Union as a whole, not solely to the equatorial or coastal Regions hosting launch sites.

---

### Section 23. Authenticity of Official Acts

*Resolves Gap 211 — The "Synthetic Insurrection" (Deepfake Treason). Establishes authentication requirements for high-stakes government communications, preventing synthetic media forgery from triggering armed conflict or constitutional crisis by defining what constitutes a valid official act.*

(a) **Authentication Mandate.** All high-stakes official communications issued by any branch of the Federal Government, any Regional government, or any State government shall be cryptographically authenticated before they carry legal force. High-stakes official communications include, but are not limited to: declarations of emergency or martial law; military orders, mobilization directives, and nuclear authorization requests; executive orders and formal presidential directives; legislative enactments and judicial orders; electoral certifications and results; and any directive commanding the use of lethal force or the suspension of civil rights.

(b) **Legal Effect and Analog Fallback.** An unauthenticated high-stakes communication is presumed void and may not be relied upon as authority for government action. If the digital authentication system is unavailable due to technical failure, cyberattack, or other disruption, high-stakes communications retain legal force if authenticated by physical attestation of the issuing official in the presence of at least one officer from a different branch of government and entered in a public registry within twenty-four hours of issuance, with subsequent digital authentication within seventy-two hours of system restoration.

(c) **Domestic Verification Delay.** No Regional Guard, State militia, or other subnational military force may initiate offensive action against federal forces or forces of another Region on the basis of an unverified communication. Defensive posture and readiness measures are permitted pending verification. This subsection does not apply to self-defense against imminent physical attack or to defense against foreign aggressors.

(d) **Counterfeit Governance.** The knowing creation or dissemination of forged official government acts — including fabricated orders, declarations, certifications, or judicial rulings — with the intent to trigger armed conflict, insurrection, or constitutional crisis, is a felony punishable as Congress shall provide. This prohibition extends to synthetic media, forged documents, and any medium designed to impersonate legitimate government authority. Clearly labeled satire, parody, journalism, and political commentary are not within its scope.

(e) **Non-Repudiation.** An authenticated official act binds its issuer. No official may disavow an authenticated communication by claiming forgery unless the authentication system is demonstrated to have been compromised at the time of issuance. Authenticated records are admissible as conclusive evidence of official action.

(f) **Key Sovereignty and Algorithm Agility.** The Federal Data Coordination Agency shall administer the authentication infrastructure, with root key custody distributed across the executive, legislative, and judicial branches. Each Region shall maintain sovereign authentication keys for Regional official acts, which may not be revoked, suspended, or degraded by federal action except upon judicial order for demonstrated compromise or fraud. Authentication standards shall be designed to resist emerging cryptographic threats, including quantum computing, and shall be updateable by the administering agency without constitutional amendment, subject to multi-branch approval.

(g) **Transition.** For three years following ratification of this Section, high-stakes communications authenticated by traditional means — physical signatures, official seals, and witnessed attestation — retain full legal force. During this period, the Federal Data Coordination Agency shall deploy the authentication infrastructure required by this Section.

(h) **First Amendment Preservation.** Nothing in this Section prohibits criticism of government, reporting on government actions, or expression of political opinion. This Section regulates the authenticity of official government acts, not the content of private speech.

---

### Section 24. Regulatory Sunset and Review (The Impermanence Principle)

*Integrates Gap 205 — Regulatory Sediment (Legislative Entropy).*

(a) **The Principle of Impermanence.** No exercise of delegated regulatory authority shall have perpetual force. Every federal regulation, administrative rule, agency guidance document, interpretive letter, enforcement policy, and any other agency action that carries binding legal effect or practically compels compliance — regardless of its label or the process by which it was issued — shall expire ten (10) years after its effective date unless affirmatively reauthorized by Congress through legislative action. Statutory delegations of rulemaking authority shall likewise expire ten (10) years after enactment unless affirmatively renewed.

(b) **Exemptions and Presumptive Retention.**

(1) Provisions of this Constitution, including the constitutional minimums established in Section 4(k) of this Article, are not subject to the sunset established in this Section.

(2) Regulations directly implementing the rights established in Article III-RF, Sections 1 through 8, are subject to presumptive retention: they survive the sunset date unless Congress affirmatively votes to expire them, reversing the default that applies to all other regulations.

(3) Treaty obligations and international agreements ratified by the Senate are not subject to this Section, though regulations implementing such obligations are subject to sunset review.

(c) **Reauthorization Process.**

(1) Reauthorization shall follow the full legislative process: passage by both houses of Congress and presentment to the President.

(2) Reauthorization legislation shall be limited to a single federal agency or a single Title of the United States Code. Omnibus reauthorization of regulations spanning multiple agencies or Titles is prohibited.

(3) The Independent Fiscal Council shall certify, for each regulation proposed for reauthorization, the current annualized compliance cost, the demonstrated efficacy of the regulation, and whether the regulation's benefits justify its costs. Reauthorization without current IFC certification is void.

(4) Upon reauthorization, prior judicial interpretations of the expired regulation do not bind interpretation of the reauthorized text. Congress may explicitly incorporate specific prior interpretations by reference in the reauthorization legislation; absent such incorporation, the reauthorized regulation receives fresh judicial construction under the de novo review standard of Article XIV-RF, Section 9.

(5) A public comment period of not less than ninety (90) days shall precede any reauthorization vote.

(d) **Regulatory Pay-Go.** For every dollar of annualized compliance cost imposed by a new regulation, an equivalent amount of existing regulatory compliance cost must be identified for elimination. The Independent Fiscal Council shall certify compliance with this requirement before any new regulation takes effect. Congress may by supermajority vote of three-fifths of each house waive this requirement for a specific regulation upon a finding of compelling necessity.

(e) **Staggered Implementation.** Upon ratification of this Section:

(1) within two (2) years, the Independent Fiscal Council, in consultation with the Congressional Budget Office, shall assign all existing federal regulations to ten (10) subject-matter cohorts;

(2) beginning in the third year following ratification, one cohort shall reach its sunset date each year, with the highest-burden cohorts reviewed first;

(3) by the twelfth year following ratification, all existing regulations shall have passed through one complete sunset cycle.

(f) **Graduated Expiration.**

(1) If Congress fails to reauthorize a regulation before its sunset date, the regulation receives an automatic one-year mandatory review extension. During this extension, the regulation remains enforceable, but both houses of Congress must schedule and conduct review proceedings.

(2) If Congress fails to reauthorize the regulation before the expiration of the one-year extension, the regulation is void and unenforceable. No federal funds may be expended for its enforcement. Actions taken under the expired regulation after the extension period are without legal authority.

(3) A regulation that expires under this subsection may be re-enacted through the normal legislative process at any time; expiration does not preclude future regulation of the same subject matter.

(g) **Compliance Cost Monitoring.**

(1) The Congressional Budget Office shall estimate the compliance cost of each new regulation before its adoption, consistent with Article IV, Section 3.

(2) The Independent Fiscal Council shall monitor the actual compliance cost of all federal regulations on an ongoing basis and publish an annual Regulatory Burden Report disclosing the total annualized compliance cost, the cost of each cohort, the cost of each agency's regulatory portfolio, and the trend in aggregate regulatory burden.

(3) No agency may calculate or certify the compliance cost of its own regulations for purposes of this Section.

(h) **Anti-Circumvention.**

(1) This Section applies to all agency actions with binding legal effect or practical compulsive force, regardless of whether denominated as a regulation, rule, guidance, policy statement, interpretive letter, frequently-asked-questions document, enforcement manual, or any other label.

(2) An agency may not, following the expiration of a regulation, continue to enforce the substance of the expired regulation through enforcement discretion, prosecutorial policy, or any assertion of general statutory authority. Enforcement actions premised on expired regulatory authority are void.

(3) Where a regulation incorporates by reference a privately-maintained standard, the regulatory incorporation expires with the regulation. The referenced standard has no independent federal legal force after the incorporating regulation expires.

(4) Reauthorization of a vague statutory delegation of rulemaking authority does not restart the sunset clock for regulations previously promulgated under that delegation. The regulations themselves must be independently reauthorized.

(i) **Regional Application.** Each Region shall establish a mechanism for the periodic review and sunset of Regional regulations. The design and timeline of such mechanisms are within Regional discretion, but each Region must demonstrate that its regulatory stock is subject to systematic periodic review. The Independent Fiscal Council shall include Regional regulatory burden data in its annual Regulatory Burden Report.

(j) **Coordination with Existing Sunset Provisions.**

(1) Where a regulation is subject to both this Section and the sunset provisions of Section 4 of this Article, the shorter sunset period governs.

(2) The sunset for unpublished legal interpretations established in Section 18(i) of this Article operates independently and is not extended by this Section.

(3) Sector-specific sunset provisions elsewhere in this Constitution (including Article IV, Section 6(b); Article XI-RF, Section 6(k); and Article XVII-RF) continue to operate independently; this Section provides a floor, not a ceiling, for regulatory review.

(k) **Enforcement and Emergency Suspension.**

(1) Any person subject to a regulation that has expired under this Section has standing to seek declaratory and injunctive relief in federal court.

(2) The President may suspend the operation of this Section for specific regulations directly related to an ongoing armed conflict or declared national emergency for a period not exceeding one hundred eighty (180) days. Renewal of such suspension requires an affirmative vote of Congress.

(3) This Section is self-executing and does not require implementing legislation, though Congress may enact legislation to further its purposes.

### Section 25. Regional-State Supremacy and Implementation

*Resolves Gap 59 — The State-Regional Preemption Deadlock (Vertical Supremacy Vacuum).*

(a) **Scope.** This Section operationalizes Article III, Section 3(b) for Regional-State relations. It applies to Regional laws enacted pursuant to Section 2 or within Regional Exclusive Domains (Section 1(e)(2)) and Structured Concurrent Domains (Section 1(e)(3)).

(b) **Regional Supremacy Classification.** The Allocation Review Board shall classify Regional authority over State law, by domain or policy, into three tiers:

- (1) **Full Preemption.** Regional law supersedes conflicting State or local law; the Region may implement directly under subsection (g).
- (2) **Cooperative Implementation.** Regional law sets standards and timelines; States implement through approved plans under subsections (h) and (i).
- (3) **Concurrent Authority.** Regional standards operate as floors; States may exceed them consistent with Article III, Section 1 and the National Common Market.

(c) **Exclusive Federal Domains Not Subject.** The Exclusive Federal Domains enumerated in Section 1(e)(1) are not subject to classification under this Section.

(d) **Regional Development Banking.** Regional authority over development banking is limited to:

- (1) Regional Development Banks for infrastructure financing;
- (2) intra-Regional credit unions and community development financial institutions;
- (3) Regional bond issuance for capital projects denominated in national currency; and
- (4) operation within federal banking regulatory frameworks; and
- (5) compliance with the non-discrimination protections of Article III, Section 5 and applicable federal civil rights law. The IFC shall monitor and publish Regional Development Bank lending patterns annually.

(e) **Default Classification.** Unless the ARB classifies a policy as Full Preemption under subsection (f), Regional Exclusive Domains shall be governed by Cooperative Implementation. Structured Concurrent Domains shall be treated as Concurrent Authority unless classified as Full Preemption under subsection (f).

(f) **Classification Criteria (Full Preemption).** The ARB may classify a policy as Full Preemption only upon clear and convincing evidence that:

- (1) the policy requires physical continuity across State boundaries;
- (2) State-by-State variation would render the policy ineffective; and
- (3) no reasonable implementation flexibility exists.

(g) **Direct Implementation Authority (Full Preemption).** For policies classified as Full Preemption, the Region may:

- (1) exercise eminent domain directly, subject to just compensation paid from Regional funds;
- (2) issue permits and approvals that supersede conflicting State or local requirements;
- (3) contract directly with private parties for construction and operation; and
- (4) establish Regional administrative agencies with direct enforcement authority.

(5) **Scope Limitation.** Eminent domain, permitting, and contracting authority under this subsection are limited to property and approvals reasonably necessary to implement the certified policy or project. Takings beyond the certified scope are void and subject to expedited judicial relief.

(6) **Federal National Necessity Priority.** If a Regional Full Preemption project conflicts with a National Necessity project certified under Section 17, the federal project prevails. The Federal Government shall accommodate Regional concerns consistent with Section 17(d).

(h) **Cooperative Implementation Mechanisms.** For policies classified as Cooperative Implementation:

- (1) the Region shall establish performance standards and timelines;
- (2) States shall submit implementation plans within one hundred eighty (180) days;
- (3) the Region shall approve plans that reasonably achieve Regional objectives; and
- (4) States retain discretion over methods, contractors, and local arrangements.

(i) **Implementation Plan Dispute Resolution.** If the Region rejects a State implementation plan:

- (1) the State may appeal to the ARB under Section 7, subject to the procedures and limits of Section 4-A;
- (2) the ARB shall determine whether the Regional rejection was arbitrary or whether the State plan reasonably achieves Regional objectives;
- (3) if the ARB finds the State plan adequate, the Region shall accept it; and
- (4) if the ARB finds the State plan inadequate, the State shall submit a revised plan within ninety (90) days.

(j) **Funding Allocation with Default Split.**

- (1) **Default Split.** Unless otherwise determined, funding for Cooperative Implementation policies shall be allocated:
    - (A) seventy percent (70%) from Regional funds;
    - (B) thirty percent (30%) from State funds.
- (2) **Deviation from Default.** Either party may petition the Independent Fiscal Council (IFC) for a different allocation by demonstrating Disproportionate Burden:
    - (A) the petitioning party must show by clear and convincing evidence that the default split would impose costs substantially exceeding the benefits received; and
    - (B) "substantially exceeding" means a benefit-to-cost ratio below 0.5 for the petitioning party. The IFC shall establish and publish the methodology for calculating benefit-to-cost ratios under this subsection, including time horizon, discount rate, and cost categories.
- (3) **Implementation Pending Dispute.** If a funding allocation is disputed:
    - (A) implementation shall proceed under the default 70/30 split;
    - (B) the IFC shall issue a determination within one hundred eighty (180) days;
    - (C) if the IFC determines a different allocation, the overpaying party shall be reimbursed from the underpaying party's next fiscal year allocation; and
    - (D) no party may delay implementation pending funding dispute resolution.
- (4) **Anti-Gaming Provision.** A party that petitions for deviation three (3) or more times within five (5) years without success:
    - (A) shall bear the IFC's adjudication costs for subsequent petitions; and
    - (B) shall face a rebuttable presumption that future petitions are dilatory.

(k) **Administrative Non-Compliance.** If a State fails to submit an implementation plan or fails to implement an approved plan within required timelines:

- (1) days 1-90 after deadline: the Region shall issue a formal non-compliance notice;
- (2) days 91-180: the Region may withhold Regional funding for unrelated State projects within the same domain;
- (3) days 181-365: the Region may assume direct implementation authority, with costs charged to the non-complying State; and
- (4) day 366+: the ARB may reclassify the policy as Full Preemption for the non-complying State only.

(l) **Local Government Obstruction.** If State law delegates implementation to local governments that refuse cooperation:

- (1) the State remains responsible for achieving Regional objectives;
- (2) the State may not claim local non-compliance as a defense;
- (3) the Region may require the State to exercise State preemption over local governments; and
- (4) persistent local obstruction shall be attributed to State non-compliance.

Nothing in this subsection authorizes Regional preemption of local authority except as provided in subsection (g) for Full Preemption policies. For Cooperative Implementation and Concurrent Authority domains, the Local Autonomy Floor established in Article II-RF, Section 3 is preserved and Regional directives shall not override non-preemptible local powers enumerated therein.

(m) **"Working On It" Defense Prohibited.** A State may not indefinitely delay implementation by claiming ongoing review:

- (1) environmental reviews shall be completed within twenty-four (24) months;
- (2) permitting decisions shall be issued within twelve (12) months of complete application;
- (3) failure to meet these timelines constitutes constructive denial; and
- (4) constructive denial triggers Regional direct implementation authority under subsection (g).

(n) **Cost Recovery.** If the Region assumes direct implementation due to State non-compliance:

- (1) the Region may recover all costs from the State's share of federal transfers and equalization payments under Article X;
- (2) cost recovery shall include a fifteen percent (15%) administrative surcharge; and
- (3) the Non-Coercion Standard of Article X, Section 4 is not a defense to cost recovery for non-compliance with lawful Regional directives under this Section.

(o) **Waiver of State Sovereign Immunity.** No State may assert sovereign immunity in any action arising under this Section, including cost recovery actions certified by the ARB or IFC, enforcement of Regional directives within Regional Exclusive Domains, or collection of penalties and surcharges. This waiver is limited to actions under this Section, is self-executing, and requires no further State legislative action. Attempted reassertion of sovereign immunity for matters covered by this subsection constitutes an independent violation subject to the penalties in subsection (k).

(p) **State Constitutional Challenge.** If a State claims that a Regional policy violates its State constitution:

- (1) the State shall file the challenge with the National Constitutional Court within sixty (60) days of Regional policy adoption;
- (2) the challenge shall specify the State constitutional provision allegedly violated; and
- (3) implementation shall be stayed pending resolution only if the Court finds a substantial likelihood of success on the merits.

State courts may not stay, enjoin, or suspend Regional policies on State constitutional grounds.

(q) **Federal Review Standard.** The National Constitutional Court shall review State constitutional objections under the following standard:

- (1) if the State constitutional provision predates Regional Federation ratification, the Court shall determine whether the provision was intended to limit Regional-type authority or only federal authority;
- (2) if the State constitutional provision was ratified after Regional Federation ratification — regardless of proposal date — it shall be presumed an attempt to circumvent Regional authority and shall receive strict scrutiny; and
- (3) State constitutional provisions adopted or amended specifically to block a Regional policy are void as to that policy.

(r) **Anti-Manipulation Safeguard.** A State may not:

- (1) amend its constitution to create obstacles to Regional authority after a Regional policy is proposed;
- (2) interpret existing provisions in novel ways to block Regional policy; or
- (3) delegate to local governments constitutional authority the State itself does not possess.

(s) **State Implementation Discretion.** Even within Full Preemption domains, States retain:

- (1) authority to exceed Regional standards where such exceedance does not materially impair Regional objectives or physical continuity, subject to common-market constraints;
- (2) discretion over purely local aspects that do not affect Regional objectives; and
- (3) the right to propose alternative implementation methods that achieve equivalent outcomes.

(t) **Subsidiarity Review.** Any State may petition the ARB for a determination that a Regional policy:

- (1) does not require Full Preemption classification;
- (2) imposes implementation requirements beyond what Regional objectives require; or
- (3) fails to provide adequate State implementation discretion.

If the ARB agrees, it shall require the Region to modify the policy to preserve greater State discretion.

(u) **Anti-Centralization Presumption.** In all classifications and reviews under this Section, the ARB shall apply a presumption in favor of State implementation discretion:

- (1) Full Preemption shall be the exception, not the rule;
- (2) Regions shall demonstrate necessity for each reduction in State discretion; and
- (3) the burden of proof lies with the Region, not the State.

(v) **Adversarial Fact-Finding Authority.** When adjudicating classification disputes or subsidiarity reviews under this Section, the ARB:

- (1) shall not rely solely on data provided by the petitioning Region or responding State;
- (2) may commission independent technical assessments from federal agencies, academic institutions, or qualified contractors;
- (3) may subpoena records from any party or third party with relevant information;
- (4) may conduct site inspections and independent measurements;
- (5) shall require parties to certify under penalty of perjury that data is complete and accurate, disclose all data sources and methodologies, and provide underlying records upon request;
- (6) shall draw adverse inferences against any party that provides materially misleading or incomplete data and shall require the offending party to bear the costs of independent fact-finding;
- (7) for States, a finding of factual sabotage creates a rebuttable presumption in favor of Full Preemption; for Regions, a finding of factual sabotage creates an irrebuttable presumption against Full Preemption; and
- (8) shall complete independent fact-finding within one hundred twenty (120) days. Failure to meet this deadline creates a presumption in favor of the existing classification.

(w) **Filing Management and Anti-Flooding.** Disputes under this Section are domain boundary disputes for purposes of Section 4-A and are subject to its annual limits, consolidation authority, and frivolousness penalties. For purposes of Section 4-A(e), State filings count against the annual limit of the State's Region unless the ARB grants leave under Section 4-A(f). Adversarial Review Office procedures under Section 7(s)-(v) apply to determinations under this Section.
