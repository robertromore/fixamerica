---

### Section 1(e). Domain Classification

(1) **Exclusive Federal Domains.** The following domains are exclusively federal, and no Regional or State law may operate within them:

- (i) National defense and armed forces;

- (iii) Currency, monetary policy, and central banking;
- (iv) Immigration and naturalization;
- (v) Postal service and interstate telecommunications infrastructure;
- (vi) Intellectual property (patents, copyrights, trademarks).

(2) **Exclusive Regional Domains.** The following domains are exclusively Regional, and no Federal or State law may operate within them except as specifically enumerated:

- (i) K-12 education curriculum and standards;
- (ii) Land use, zoning, and local planning;
- (iii) State and local government structure;
- (iv) Family law (marriage, divorce, custody, adoption);
- (v) Intraregional transportation infrastructure.

(4) **Classification Review.** The Allocation Review Board shall review domain classifications every ten years and recommend reclassifications to Congress and the Regional Assemblies:

- (i) ARB recommendations have no legal effect absent legislative action by Congress and ratification by a majority of Regional Assemblies;
- (ii) Failure of Congress or the Regions to act on a recommendation does not alter existing classifications;
- (iii) No domain may be reclassified by judicial interpretation; reclassification requires the legislative process specified herein.

---

### Section 2. Enumerated Regional Powers

Regions shall have exclusive authority over:

- inter-state infrastructure and transportation corridors,
- Regional labor standards above federal floors,
- housing coordination and supply targets,
- energy generation and transmission planning,

---

### Section 3-A. Rights Floor Enforcement Constraints

(a) **Rights Floor Authority.** Congress may enforce minimum protections against Regional abridgment only where:

- (i) The right is explicitly enumerated in this Constitution or its amendments; OR
- (ii) The right has been established by constitutional amendment ratified after the effective date of this Section.

(b) **No Implied Rights Floors.** Congress may not claim enforcement authority based on:

- (i) Penumbral reasoning from enumerated rights;
- (ii) Substantive due process doctrine;
- (iii) General welfare, commerce, or spending power rationales recharacterized as rights enforcement; OR
- (iv) International treaty obligations not separately ratified as constitutional amendments.

(c) **Enforcement Prerequisites.** Before exercising rights floor enforcement authority, Congress shall:

- (i) **Identify the enumerated right** by specific textual citation;
- (ii) **Document Regional violation** with specific findings of fact, including identification of the Regional law, policy, or practice alleged to violate the floor;
- (iii) **Demonstrate necessity** showing that judicial remedies are inadequate to protect the enumerated right; AND
- (iv) **Publish the evidentiary record** supporting enforcement in its entirety within 30 days of enactment, subject only to narrowly tailored national security redactions. Redacted material shall be provided in full to reviewing courts under seal.

(d) **Judicial Review.** Any exercise of rights floor enforcement authority shall be subject to de novo judicial review. Courts shall apply no deference to congressional characterization of:

- (i) Whether the asserted right is enumerated;
- (ii) Whether Regional action violates the floor; OR
- (iii) Whether judicial remedies are inadequate.

(e) **Pretext Analysis.** Courts shall invalidate enforcement actions where:

- (i) The stated rights justification is pretextual;
- (ii) The enforcement mechanism bears no rational relationship to protecting the enumerated right; OR
- (iii) The enforcement imposes burdens on Regional authority disproportionate to any plausible rights-protective benefit.

A rebuttable presumption of pretext arises where enforcement targets Regional policies that Congress has previously sought to override through ordinary legislation.

(f) **Individual Litigation Unaffected.** Nothing in this Section limits the ability of individuals to seek judicial relief for violations of constitutional rights, nor the authority of courts to grant such relief in individual cases. This Section constrains only congressional claims of enforcement authority under enabling clauses.

---

### Section 4. Concurrent Authority Framework

(a) **Federal Floor, Regional Ceiling.** In Structured Concurrent Domains:

- (i) Congress may establish minimum standards ("floors") applicable nationwide;
- (ii) Regions may exceed federal floors within their territory;
- (iii) Regions may not fall below federal floors;
- (iv) Federal floors require three-fifths vote in both houses and certification by the ARB that the floor addresses genuine cross-regional spillover.

(b) **Regional Primary Authority.** Within Structured Concurrent Domains:

- (i) Regions have primary regulatory authority;
- (ii) Federal authority is limited to establishing floors, not comprehensive regulation;
- (iii) Federal enforcement operates only when Regional enforcement fails.

(c) **Spillover Trigger.** Federal floor authority may be exercised only upon ARB certification that:

- (i) The problem addressed has documented cross-regional effects;
- (ii) Regional action alone cannot adequately address the spillover;
- (iii) The proposed floor is the minimum necessary to address the spillover;
- (iv) The floor does not prescribe specific means, only outcomes.

(c-1) **ARB Role Limitation.** In certifying spillover and necessity under subsection (c), the ARB shall not evaluate the wisdom, desirability, or policy merits of the proposed floor, but only whether the constitutional criteria for federal floor authority are satisfied.

(d) **Automatic Sunset.** Federal floors in Structured Concurrent Domains:

- (i) Expire after ten years unless reauthorized;
- (ii) May be reauthorized by simple majority upon ARB certification that spillover conditions persist;
- (iii) Shall be reviewed by the ARB at years 5 and 8 with public report on continued necessity.

(e) **Regional Variance.** A Region may petition for variance from a federal floor upon demonstrating:

- (i) An alternative approach that achieves equivalent spillover mitigation;
- (ii) The variance will not export harms to other Regions;
- (iii) Approval by ARB, which shall issue variance within 90 days or state reasons for denial.

(f) **Accountability Labeling.**

(1) **Federal Responsibility Statement.** Federal floors in Structured Concurrent Domains shall include a Responsibility Statement identifying:

- (i) which outcomes are federally guaranteed;
- (ii) which implementation choices are delegated to Regions.

(2) **Regional Compliance Statement.** Regional legislation in Structured Concurrent Domains shall include a Compliance Statement identifying:

- (i) which provisions implement federal floor requirements;
- (ii) which provisions exceed federal floors as Regional policy choices;
- (iii) which implementation methods were selected by the Region from among permissible alternatives.

(3) **Specificity Requirement.** Responsibility Statements and Compliance Statements shall be sufficiently specific to permit a reasonable reader to distinguish mandated requirements from discretionary policy choices.

(4) **Effect of Non-Compliance.** Failure to include required Statements:

- (i) does not invalidate the underlying legislation;
- (ii) creates rebuttable presumption that challenged provisions are discretionary Regional choices for purposes of accountability;
- (iii) may be cured by amendment at any time.

(g) **Non-Concurrent Domains.** Powers in Exclusive Federal Domains and Exclusive Regional Domains (as defined in Section 1(e)) shall be exclusive to the level to which they are assigned unless this Constitution explicitly authorizes shared jurisdiction.

---

### Section 4-A. Dispute Reduction and Litigation Management

(a) **Pre-Enactment Consultation.** Before enacting legislation in a Structured Concurrent Domain:

- (i) The Federal Government shall provide 60 days' notice to all Regional Governors with draft text;
- (ii) Regions shall provide 30 days' notice to the Federal Government and other Regions with draft text;
- (iii) Any level may request ARB advisory opinion during notice period;
- (iv) Advisory opinions issued within 45 days; non-binding but precedential.

(b) **Expedited ARB Certification.** For legislation in Structured Concurrent Domains:

- (i) ARB shall issue floor certifications within 60 days;
- (ii) Failure to issue within 60 days creates rebuttable presumption of validity;
- (iii) Expedited certifications are provisional and subject to full review within one year.

(c) **Presumption of Validity.** In judicial review of Concurrent Domain legislation:

- (i) Regional legislation exceeding federal floors is presumed valid;
- (ii) Federal floors with ARB spillover certification are presumed valid;
- (iii) Challenger bears burden of demonstrating invalidity by clear and convincing evidence.

(d) **Safe Harbors.** The ARB shall publish:

- (i) Model legislation templates that are pre-certified as valid;
- (ii) "Bright line" lists of clearly permissible Regional and Federal actions;
- (iii) Quarterly guidance on emerging issues.

(e) **Annual Limits.** The ARB shall not be required to adjudicate more than:

- (i) Fifty (50) domain boundary disputes per year from Federal Government;
- (ii) Twenty (20) domain boundary disputes per year per Region;
- (iii) Disputes exceeding limits shall be queued by filing date.

(f) **Hardship Exception.** The ARB may grant leave to exceed annual filing limits upon a showing that:

- (i) Denial would result in irreparable harm to Regional constitutional authority; and
- (ii) The dispute could not reasonably have been anticipated and filed earlier.

(g) **Consolidation Authority.** The ARB shall consolidate:

- (i) Disputes raising substantially similar domain questions;
- (ii) Disputes involving the same parties on related matters;
- (iii) Consolidated disputes count as one against filing limits.

(h) **Frivolousness Penalties.** A party that files a domain dispute found frivolous:

- (i) Shall pay the opposing party's costs;
- (ii) Loses one filing slot for the following year per frivolous filing;
- (iii) After three frivolous filings in five years, requires ARB leave to file.

---

### Section 5. Regional Exclusive Domains

(a) **Enumeration.** Regional Exclusive Domains are those areas where Regions have primary authority subject only to Federal Floors and Frameworks.

(b) **ARB Certification.** The Allocation Review Board shall certify whether legislation impacts Regional Exclusive Domains.

(c) **Supermajority Requirement.** Any bill establishing a "National Floor" or "National Framework" that the ARB has certified as impacting a Regional Exclusive Domain requires three-fifths (60%) majority of the House of Representatives for passage. This requirement may not be waived, suspended, or circumvented by House rules, and applies regardless of procedural posture (including conference reports, amendments, and reconciliation).

(d) **Pre-Legislative Domain Certification.**

(1) Before any bill establishing a National Floor or National Framework may be introduced in the House of Representatives, the bill's sponsor shall submit the proposed legislation to the Allocation Review Board for Domain Certification.

(2) Within thirty days of submission, the Board shall certify whether the proposed legislation impacts a Regional Exclusive Domain under this section.

(3) If the Board certifies that the legislation impacts a Regional Exclusive Domain:

- (i) the bill shall be subject to the supermajority requirement of subsection (c);
- (ii) this certification shall be noted in the bill's official text and cannot be removed by amendment; and
- (iii) any attempt to pass the bill by simple majority shall be void.

(4) If the Board certifies that the legislation does not impact a Regional Exclusive Domain, the bill may proceed under normal House procedures.

(5) The Board's Domain Certification is subject to judicial review only for abuse of discretion or clear legal error. Courts shall give substantial deference to the Board's determination of domain boundaries.

(6) Congress may not:

- (i) define its own jurisdiction over Regional Exclusive Domains;
- (ii) amend the definition of Regional Exclusive Domain except by constitutional amendment; or
- (iii) circumvent Domain Certification through creative bill drafting, omnibus legislation, or procedural manipulation.

(7) If the Board fails to issue certification within thirty days, the bill shall be presumptively certified as NOT impacting a Regional Exclusive Domain, and the bill may proceed under normal House procedures. This default prevents certification delay from being used to obstruct legislation.

#### Anti-Bottleneck Provisions

(8) **Expedited Certification Track.** The Board shall establish an expedited certification track for:

- (i) bills addressing declared emergencies;
- (ii) bills with bipartisan House sponsorship exceeding sixty percent;
- (iii) bills that are substantially similar to previously certified legislation.
Expedited certifications shall be completed within ten days.

(9) **Staffing and Capacity Requirements.** The Board shall maintain sufficient staff to process certification requests without backlog:

- (i) If average certification time exceeds twenty days for three consecutive months, the Board shall hire additional staff within sixty days;
- (ii) Certification staff funding is mandatory spending, not subject to annual appropriation;
- (iii) The Board shall publish monthly certification statistics including filing volume, average processing time, and pending requests.

(10) **Backlog Remediation.** If pending certification requests exceed fifty at any time:

- (i) The Board shall implement emergency processing procedures;
- (ii) New requests shall be processed in order of filing date;
- (iii) Requests pending more than twenty days shall be automatically approved for normal House procedures unless the Board affirmatively certifies Regional Exclusive Domain impact within five additional days.

(11) **Anti-Strategic-Delay.** No party may file certification requests for the purpose of creating backlog or delaying unrelated legislation:

- (i) Frivolous or duplicative requests may be summarily dismissed;
- (ii) A pattern of filing requests subsequently withdrawn may result in filing restrictions;
- (iii) The Board may consolidate substantially similar requests.

(12) **Congressional Bypass for Obstruction.** If the Board fails to process certifications due to quorum failure, member vacancies, or other institutional dysfunction for more than sixty consecutive days:

- (i) The House may proceed with legislation without certification by a three-fifths vote;
- (ii) Such legislation shall be subject to expedited judicial review within ninety days of enactment;
- (iii) This bypass may not be used if the Board is functioning normally but simply has a backlog.

---

### Section 6. Regional Equivalence Exemptions

(a) **Equivalence Petition.** A Region may petition the Allocation Review Board for an "Equivalence Exemption" from a specific National Floor. The Board shall grant the exemption if the Region demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence, that its alternative policy achieves the same or superior outcome as intended by the National Floor while better suiting regional economic, geographic, or demographic conditions.

(b) **Outcome Metrics.** For each National Floor, Congress shall specify measurable outcome metrics by which equivalence may be assessed. If Congress fails to specify metrics, the Allocation Review Board shall determine appropriate metrics based on the stated legislative purpose.

(c) **Provisional Compliance.** Pending Allocation Review Board determination on an Equivalence Petition:

(1) The Region may implement its alternative policy on a provisional basis;

(2) The Region shall demonstrate a good-faith compliance mechanism, which may include:

- (i) posting a compliance bond in an amount determined by the Board,
- (ii) establishing an escrow fund for potential remediation costs,
- (iii) implementing enhanced monitoring and reporting, or
- (iv) other assurance mechanisms the Board deems adequate;

(3) Provisional implementation shall not constitute a violation of the National Floor during the pendency of the petition;

(4) If the petition is denied, the Region shall have one hundred eighty days to achieve full compliance with the National Floor.

---

### Section 6-A. Infrastructure Prioritization Transparency

(a) **Published Criteria.** Each Region shall publish and maintain criteria for infrastructure sequencing, including:

- (i) Factors determining project priority;
- (ii) Methodology for applying factors to specific projects;
- (iii) Timeline projections for queued projects.

(b) **Prohibited Factors.** No prioritization criteria may include:

- (i) Voting patterns of affected localities;
- (ii) Party registration of affected populations;
- (iii) Prior electoral outcomes in affected areas;
- (iv) Political affiliation of local officials.

(c) **Proxy Measure Limitation.** Criteria that correlate greater than 0.6 with prohibited factors require independent infrastructure justification. "Independent infrastructure justification" means a justification that, when applied neutrally across all localities, would not systematically correlate with political alignment.

(d) **Public Accessibility.** Prioritization criteria and their application shall be:

- (i) Published on publicly accessible websites;
- (ii) Updated within 30 days of any methodology change;
- (iii) Accompanied by explanation of how current projects were prioritized.

(e) **Presumption of Need.**

(1) **Prima Facie Case.** A prima facie case of patronage sequencing is established if a locality demonstrates:

- (i) The locality is demonstrably underserved relative to the Regional average for the infrastructure category; AND
- (ii) A sequencing decision delays investment by more than three (3) years relative to comparable projects; AND
- (iii) A pattern of delays correlates with political alignment at greater than 0.5 statistical significance.

(2) **Burden Shift.** Upon prima facie showing:

- (i) The Region bears the burden of demonstrating independent infrastructure justification;
- (ii) Justifications must be specific to the delayed project, not general policy;
- (iii) Post-hoc justifications are viewed with skepticism.

(3) **Independent Infrastructure Justification.** Justification is independent if it:

- (i) Applies neutrally across all localities;
- (ii) Would not systematically disadvantage politically disfavored areas when applied consistently;
- (iii) Is documented in contemporaneous records, not reconstructed for litigation.

(f) **Infrastructure Sequencing Audits.**

(1) **Audit Authority.** The Regional Auditor (or equivalent independent official) may:

- (i) Audit infrastructure sequencing decisions for compliance with this Section;
- (ii) Conduct statistical correlation analysis between sequencing and political variables;
- (iii) Publish annual reports on infrastructure allocation patterns.

(2) **Data Requirements.** Regions shall maintain and provide to auditors:

- (i) Complete sequencing decisions for the prior ten (10) years;
- (ii) Stated justifications for each decision at time of decision;
- (iii) Outcome data enabling correlation analysis.

(3) **Delegation Non-Relief.** Delegation of infrastructure sequencing to private or quasi-private entities does not relieve the Region of responsibility for compliance with this Section. Private entities exercising delegated sequencing authority are subject to the same transparency and anti-patronage requirements.

(4) **Public Reporting.** Audit results shall be:

- (i) Published annually;
- (ii) Transmitted to the ARB for potential enforcement action;
- (iii) Available to affected localities for use in challenges.

(g) **Remedies for Sequencing Patronage.**

(1) **Standing.** Affected localities have standing to challenge sequencing patterns if they meet the prima facie standard of subsection (e).

(2) **ARB Authority.** Upon finding patronage sequencing, the ARB may:

- (i) Order revised prioritization using neutral methodology;
- (ii) Order accelerated timelines for demonstrably disadvantaged localities;
- (iii) Appoint an infrastructure sequencing monitor for up to five (5) years.

(3) **Prospective-First Remedies.** Remedies shall prioritize prospective correction over retroactive reallocation except where delay has caused irreparable harm. No monetary damages for past sequencing; remedy is prospective correction of methodology and accelerated timelines.

(4) **Pattern Evidence.** In challenges under this Section:

- (i) Pattern evidence is admissible and probative;
- (ii) Individual intent is not required if pattern establishes discriminatory effect;
- (iii) Statistical evidence of correlation may establish prima facie case.

### Section 7. Allocation Review Board

#### Establishment and Composition

(a) **Establishment.** There is hereby established an Allocation Review Board (ARB) to resolve disputes regarding the allocation of powers among federal, Regional, and State governments.

(b) **Composition.** The ARB shall consist of nine members appointed as follows:

(1) Three members appointed by the President with Senate confirmation;

(2) Two members appointed by the Judicial Conference of the United States from among retired federal and state appellate judges who have never held partisan elected office;

(3) Two members elected by the Regional Governors, with each Region casting one vote and no Region voting for a resident of its own Region;

(4) Two members appointed by agreement of the minority leadership of both houses of Congress.

(c) **Party Balance.** No more than four members may be affiliated with the same political party. For purposes of this subsection, "independent" members count toward the party with which they most recently affiliated or, if never affiliated, are assigned by the Chief Justice to maintain balance.

(d) **Experience Diversity.** At least two members must have primary professional experience in state or local government (not federal service), and at least one member must have primary experience in private sector or academic roles.

(e) **Terms and Removal.** Members serve staggered seven-year terms, may serve only one term, and may not be removed except for cause (misconduct, incapacity, or conviction of a felony). Removal requires two-thirds vote of the Senate.

(f) **Vacancy Filling.** Vacancies shall be filled by the original appointing authority within ninety days. If not filled within ninety days, the Chief Justice shall make a temporary appointment from among retired appellate judges until the original authority acts.

#### Jurisdiction and Standards

(g) **Jurisdiction.** The ARB shall have original jurisdiction over:

(1) Disputes between Regions concerning allocation of powers;

(2) Challenges to federal exercise of authority as exceeding enumerated powers;

(3) Challenges to Regional exercise of authority as exceeding enumerated powers;

(4) Disputes regarding spillover effects and non-concurrency;

(5) Certification of legislation as within appropriate governmental authority.

(h) **Standards.** The ARB shall apply the allocation framework established by Congress, or in its absence, the default rules of Article XXI. The ARB shall interpret this Constitution to preserve the balance of power among federal, Regional, and State governments.

#### Appeals and Binding Effect

(i) **Immediate Binding Effect.** In all matters of power allocation:

(1) The ARB's ruling is immediately binding upon issuance;

(2) The ruling shall not be stayed pending appeal to the Supreme Court except as provided in subsection (l);

(3) Parties must comply with ARB rulings during any appeal period.

(j) **Supreme Court Review Scope.** The Supreme Court may review ARB decisions only for:

(1) Errors of constitutional interpretation;

(2) Violation of due process in ARB proceedings;

(3) The Supreme Court may not reweigh factual evidence or substitute its judgment on factual matters.

(k) **Appeals.** ARB decisions are final on factual matters. Questions of constitutional interpretation may be appealed to the Supreme Court.

(l) **Limited Stay Authority.** The Supreme Court may stay an ARB ruling only upon finding:

(1) Substantial likelihood that the ARB committed clear constitutional error;

(2) Irreparable harm to the appellant absent stay;

(3) The stay would not substantially harm other parties or the public interest;

(4) Stay requests must be decided within seven days.

#### Anti-Remand Provisions

(m) **No Factual Remand.** The Supreme Court may not remand a power-allocation dispute to the ARB for:

(1) Further factual findings;

(2) Reconsideration of evidence;

(3) Application of a "new" factual standard.

(n) **Reversal or Affirmance Only.** Upon review of an ARB power-allocation decision:

(1) The Supreme Court shall affirm or reverse;

(2) If reversed, the Supreme Court shall specify the correct constitutional interpretation;

(3) The ARB shall apply the Court's interpretation to the existing factual record without further proceedings.

(o) **One Appeal Limit.** Each party may appeal an ARB power-allocation ruling to the Supreme Court only once:

(1) Subsequent appeals on the same matter are barred;

(2) ARB application of Supreme Court interpretation is not separately appealable;

(3) The ARB's post-reversal ruling is final.

#### Parallel Filing Prevention

(p) **Exclusive Initial Jurisdiction.** Power-allocation disputes shall be filed first with the ARB:

(1) The Supreme Court shall not accept original jurisdiction over power-allocation matters;

(2) Filings that characterize power-allocation as "pure constitutional interpretation" shall be transferred to the ARB;

(3) The ARB shall determine whether a matter involves power allocation.

(q) **Sequential Proceeding Requirement.** Parties may not:

(1) File parallel proceedings in the ARB and Supreme Court on related matters;

(2) Seek Supreme Court review until ARB proceedings are complete;

(3) Raise arguments in Supreme Court that were not presented to the ARB.

(r) **Expedited Timeline Enforcement.** The combined timeline for ARB ruling and Supreme Court review shall not exceed:

(1) One hundred twenty days from initial filing to final resolution;

(2) Failure of either body to rule within its allotted time results in automatic ruling for the non-moving party;

(3) Extensions only for extraordinary circumstances certified by the Chief Justice.

#### Adversarial Review Office

(s) **Establishment of ARO.** There is established within the ARB an Adversarial Review Office ("ARO"), structurally independent from the ARB's certification and determination functions.

(t) **ARO Composition.** The ARO shall consist of:

(1) A Chief Adversarial Officer appointed by the minority party leadership of both houses of Congress (by agreement) for a non-renewable five-year term;

(2) Deputy Adversarial Officers and staff sufficient to review all major determinations, with staffing levels set by formula (not annual appropriation);

(3) Independent legal counsel with authority to file court actions.

(u) **ARO Function.** The ARO shall:

(1) Review every Domain Certification, Equivalence Determination, Preemption Certification, and other major determination;

(2) Issue a public "Adversarial Report" identifying potential errors, alternative interpretations, methodological concerns, and evidence of bias;

(3) Have standing to challenge determinations in federal court on behalf of affected parties or the public interest;

(4) Refer evidence of misconduct to the Department of Justice Inspector General.

(v) **Review Completion Trigger.** No determination shall take effect until:

(1) The ARO has issued its Adversarial Report; OR

(2) The ARO has certified in writing that it has completed its review and declines to issue a report; OR

(3) The ARO has petitioned the National Constitutional Court for a time extension due to data volume or complexity, and such extension has expired.

#### Regional Override

(w) **Regional Override of Determinations.** If five of the seven Regional Governors jointly certify that a determination by the ARB:

(1) Exceeds the ARB's statutory or constitutional authority;

(2) Reflects systematic bias toward federal expansion or centralization; or

(3) Fundamentally misapplies the criteria established by law;

the determination shall be suspended pending expedited judicial review.

(x) **Expedited Override Review.** Upon Regional Override certification:

(1) The Supreme Court shall grant expedited review within thirty days;

(2) Oral argument shall be held within sixty days of granting review;

(3) Decision shall be issued within ninety days of oral argument.

(y) **Override Limitations.**

(1) This section may not be invoked more than twice per calendar year;

(2) A Region that participates in a frivolous override (as determined by the Court) shall be barred from participating in the next override petition;

(3) Override may not be used to challenge individual case determinations; only determinations of general applicability or systematic patterns.

#### Systematic Bias Detection

(z) **Statistical Monitoring.** The Government Accountability Office shall annually analyze all ARB determinations for systematic patterns, including:

(1) Certification and determination outcomes correlated with presidential administration;

(2) Regional win/loss rates in contested proceedings;

(3) Correlation between outcomes and the appointing authority of deciding members;

(4) Deviation from historical baseline patterns;

(5) ARO challenge success rates over time.

(aa) **Bias Finding.** If GAO analysis demonstrates statistically significant correlation (p < 0.05) between determination outcomes and political factors over any rolling three-year period:

(1) The finding shall be publicly reported to Congress, all Regional Governors, and the Chief Justice;

(2) All determinations during the affected period shall be subject to expedited judicial review upon petition by any affected party, with de novo standard of review;

(3) Congress shall hold public hearings within sixty days;

(4) The ARB shall submit a remediation plan within ninety days.

(bb) **Structural Response.** If bias findings persist for two consecutive three-year periods (six years total):

(1) All current members' terms shall automatically expire;

(2) Replacement members shall be appointed by lottery from a pool consisting of retired federal appellate judges, retired state supreme court justices, and former deans of ABA-accredited law schools who have never held partisan elected office;

(3) Lottery appointments shall serve three-year terms, after which normal appointment procedures resume;

(4) Members removed under this subsection are permanently ineligible for reappointment to any technocratic body.

#### Budgetary Independence

(cc) **Automatic Funding Formula.** The operating budget of the ARB and the ARO shall be:

(1) Set as a fixed percentage of federal revenue (0.002% for the ARB; 0.0005% for the ARO);

(2) Automatically appropriated without annual congressional action;

(3) Adjusted annually for inflation using the Consumer Price Index.

(dd) **Prohibition on Budgetary Manipulation.** Congress may not:

(1) Reduce funding below the formula amount;

(2) Impose conditions on the use of formula funds;

(3) Transfer formula funds to other purposes;

(4) Delay disbursement of formula funds beyond thirty days after the start of each fiscal year.

(ee) **Enforcement.** Any member of the ARB, or the ARO, may petition the Supreme Court for a writ of mandamus to compel disbursement of formula funds. Such petitions shall be heard on an expedited basis.

#### Anti-Consolidation Safeguards

(ff) **Cross-Partisan Appointment Mandate.** To prevent a single political movement from bypassing constitutional checks through unified control of the Federal and Regional governments:

(ff-1) **Council of Governors Approval.** Appointments to the ARB, IFC, and FDCA require a three-fifths (60%) vote of the Council of Governors, ensuring that a simple partisan alignment between the President and a majority of Governors cannot capture these bodies.

(ff-2) **Adversarial Minority Key.** The minority party in the House of Representatives shall appoint a "Transparency Observer" to each Constitutional Oversight Body with full access to deliberations and data, but no vote. The Observer may:

- (1) attend all meetings, including closed sessions;
- (2) access all documents, data, and communications;
- (3) publish dissenting reports and minority analyses;
- (4) refer concerns directly to Congress and the public.

(ff-3) **Unified Control Supermajority.** If at any time a single political party controls the Presidency and four or more Regional Governorships, the threshold for the ARB to certify a federal bill as "Non-Exclusive" shall automatically rise to a three-quarters (75%) vote of the Board.

(ff-4) **Party Alignment Determination.** For purposes of subsection (ff-3), the IFC shall determine party alignment based on:

- (1) formal party registration of the officeholder;
- (2) caucus affiliation in the case of legislators;
- (3) endorsement patterns and voting alignment for independents.
An officeholder who formally declares non-alignment with any party shall not be counted toward the unified control threshold.

### Section 7-A. Algorithmic Governance Transparency

(a) **Mandatory Algorithmic Transparency.** All algorithms, data models, formulas, and computational methods used by the Allocation Review Board, Independent Fiscal Council, Federal Data Coordination Agency, or any other Constitutional Oversight Body to make determinations affecting Regional rights, obligations, or resources shall be:

- (1) fully documented in plain language accessible to non-technical readers;
- (2) published in complete technical detail, including source code where applicable;
- (3) accompanied by explanations of all assumptions, weightings, and data inputs;

- (1) The panel shall be appointed by the National Academy of Sciences;
- (2) The audit shall assess accuracy, bias, and methodological soundness;
- (3) Audit findings shall be published within sixty (60) days of completion;
- (4) The audited body shall respond to findings within ninety (90) days.

(d) **Bias Testing Requirements.** Before any algorithm may be used for constitutional determinations:

- (1) it shall be tested for systematic bias against any Region, demographic group, or economic sector;
- (2) bias testing results shall be published;
- (3) algorithms showing statistically significant bias (p < 0.05) may not be used until corrected;
- (4) ongoing bias monitoring shall continue throughout the algorithm's use.

(e) **Data Input Transparency.** All data used as inputs to algorithmic determinations shall be:

- (1) publicly disclosed, with appropriate privacy protections for individual-level data;
- (2) sourced from publicly verifiable sources;
- (3) accompanied by metadata describing collection methodology, limitations, and potential biases;
- (4) subject to challenge by affected parties who may submit alternative data.

(f) **Methodological Challenge Right.** Any Region or affected party may challenge the methodology of an algorithmic determination:

- (1) challenges shall be heard by a Special Master appointed by the Chief Justice with relevant technical expertise;
- (2) the challenger may present expert testimony on methodological flaws;
- (3) the Constitutional Oversight Body bears the burden of demonstrating methodological soundness;
- (4) if the challenge is sustained, the determination shall be vacated pending methodological correction.

(g) **Factual Finding Limitation.** The principle that factual findings of Constitutional Oversight Bodies are "final" under Section 7 applies only to:

- (1) factual determinations based on disclosed data and transparent methodology;
- (2) findings that have survived methodological challenge or for which the challenge period has expired;
- (3) this principle does not immunize algorithmic methodology from review.

(h) **Anti-Black-Box Provision.** No Constitutional Oversight Body may:

- (1) use proprietary algorithms whose methodology cannot be publicly disclosed;
- (2) rely on machine learning models that cannot be explained in human-interpretable terms;
- (3) treat algorithmic outputs as conclusive without human review and approval;
- (4) refuse to explain the basis for any specific determination to affected parties.

(i) **Algorithmic Impact Statements.** Before adopting any new algorithm or materially modifying an existing algorithm, Constitutional Oversight Bodies shall publish an Algorithmic Impact Statement assessing:

- (1) potential differential impacts on various Regions;
- (2) sensitivity analysis showing how changes in inputs affect outputs;
- (3) comparison with alternative methodological approaches;
- (4) mechanisms for ongoing monitoring and correction.

(j) **Whistleblower Protection.** Employees of Constitutional Oversight Bodies who report algorithmic bias, methodological flaws, or data manipulation shall be protected under federal whistleblower statutes and may not be terminated, demoted, or subjected to adverse action for such reporting.

#### Technocratic Integrity and Anti-Capture Provisions

(k) **Revolving Door Restrictions.** To prevent the emergence of an insular technocratic class cycling between oversight bodies:

(k-1) **Cooling-Off Periods.** No individual may serve as a member, senior staff, or consultant to more than one Constitutional Oversight Body (including the ARB, IFC, FARB, ETRB, FDCA, and any successor bodies) within a five-year period. Specifically:

- (1) former members of any such body may not be appointed to another such body until five years after the end of their prior service;
- (2) former senior staff (defined as employees at GS-15 equivalent or above) may not be appointed as members or senior staff of another such body until three years after separation;
- (3) consultants who provided more than 500 hours of service to any such body within a three-year period are subject to the same restrictions as senior staff.

(k-2) **Prohibition on Double-Hatting.** No individual may simultaneously:

- (1) serve as a member of any Constitutional Oversight Body while serving as a member, employee, or consultant to any other such body;
- (2) serve on any Constitutional Oversight Body while employed by or consulting for any party with matters pending before that body or any related body;
- (3) provide expert testimony, advisory opinions, or consulting services to parties in disputes before any body on which they have served within the preceding five years.

(k-3) **Private Sector Restrictions.** Members and senior staff of Constitutional Oversight Bodies:

- (1) may not, for three years after separation, accept employment or consulting arrangements with any entity that was a party to a significant matter in which they personally participated;
- (2) may not, for two years after separation, lobby or advocate before the body on which they served;
- (3) must disclose, for five years after separation, any compensation received from entities subject to the jurisdiction of their former body.

(k-4) **Personnel Diversity Requirements.** To prevent homogeneous technocracy:

- (1) no more than two members of any Constitutional Oversight Body may have previously served together on any other such body;
- (2) no more than one-third of members may have prior employment with the same institution (university, think tank, consulting firm, or government agency);
- (3) appointing authorities shall consider geographic, institutional, and methodological diversity in making appointments.

(k-5) **Disclosure and Transparency.** All members and senior staff shall:

- (1) file annual financial disclosure statements including all sources of income, investments, and institutional affiliations;
- (2) publicly disclose all prior service on Constitutional Oversight Bodies, related advisory committees, and relevant private sector positions;
- (3) recuse themselves from matters involving former employers, clients, or co-panelists for three years after the relevant relationship ended.

(k-6) **Enforcement.** Violations of this section shall result in:

- (1) immediate removal from the current position;
- (2) permanent ineligibility for appointment to any Constitutional Oversight Body;
- (3) disgorgement of compensation received in violation of these provisions;
- (4) civil penalties of up to $500,000 for willful violations.

### Section 8. National Security Operations Override

(a) **Certification of National Security Necessity.** When Regional exclusive-domain regulations (including but not limited to labor standards, energy planning, environmental rules, or operational requirements) materially impede the operation of federal defense facilities, defense manufacturing, or critical national security infrastructure, the President may certify a "National Security Necessity."

(b) **Certification Requirements.** A National Security Necessity certification shall:

- (1) identify the specific federal defense operation or facility affected;
- (2) identify the specific Regional regulation creating the impediment;
- (3) demonstrate that the impediment is material (not merely inconvenient) to national defense;
- (4) be transmitted to Congress and the affected Regional Government within 48 hours.

(c) **Effect of Certification.** Upon certification:

- (1) the identified Regional regulation shall be suspended as applied to the identified federal operation for a period not exceeding one hundred eighty (180) days;
- (2) the federal government shall negotiate in good faith with the Regional Government for a permanent accommodation;
- (3) affected workers and communities shall receive federal mitigation assistance for any adverse impacts.

(d) **Congressional Review.** Congress may disapprove a National Security Necessity certification by joint resolution within sixty (60) days, which shall terminate the suspension.

(e) **Judicial Review.** Regional Governments may challenge certifications in federal court on grounds that:

- (1) the impediment is not material to national defense; or
- (2) the certification is pretextual (i.e., the true purpose is economic rather than security-related).

(f) **Anti-Abuse Limitation.** This override may not be used to:

- (1) exempt federal contractors from generally applicable workplace safety requirements;
- (2) circumvent Regional environmental protections except where directly incompatible with defense operations;
- (3) impose federal labor standards on non-defense Regional employers.

---

### Section 9. Emerging Technology Domain Assignment

(a) **Emerging Technology Defined.** An "Emerging Technology" is any technology, practice, or capability that:

- (1) does not fit clearly within existing enumerated Federal, Regional, or State domains;
- (2) poses potential systemic risks crossing jurisdictional boundaries; and
- (3) is not adequately regulated by any existing jurisdictional framework.

(b) **Emerging Technology Review Board.** There is hereby established an Emerging Technology Review Board (ETRB) consisting of:

- (1) three members appointed by the President with scientific or technical expertise;
- (2) two members appointed by the Regional Governors (collectively);
- (3) two members appointed by the National Academy of Sciences;
- (4) two members appointed by the Judicial Conference from among judges with technology law experience.

(c) **Petition for Domain Assignment.** Any federal agency, Regional Government, or State Government may petition the ETRB to assign jurisdiction over an Emerging Technology. Private parties with demonstrated interest may file amicus submissions.

(d) **Provisional Federal Jurisdiction.** Upon a finding that an Emerging Technology poses systemic risks that cannot be adequately managed at the Regional or State level, the ETRB may assign provisional federal jurisdiction for a period not exceeding five years.

(e) **Criteria for Federal Assignment.** Provisional federal jurisdiction is appropriate when:

- (1) the technology poses risks of catastrophic or irreversible harm;
- (2) regulatory arbitrage among Regions or States would create "race to the bottom" dynamics;
- (3) effective regulation requires uniform national standards;
- (4) the technology implicates national security or foreign policy concerns.

(f) **Provisional Regional Jurisdiction.** When an Emerging Technology primarily affects inter-state coordination within Regions but does not meet the criteria for federal assignment, the ETRB may assign provisional Regional jurisdiction.

(g) **Transition to Permanent Assignment.** Before provisional jurisdiction expires:

- (1) the ETRB shall recommend permanent domain assignment to Congress;
- (2) Congress shall codify the assignment by statute, which may include shared jurisdiction frameworks;
- (3) if Congress fails to act, provisional jurisdiction extends for two additional years, after which the technology defaults to State jurisdiction unless renewed.

(h) **Anti-Haven Provision.** No State or Region may offer "regulatory haven" status for Emerging Technologies under provisional federal jurisdiction:

- (1) attempts to attract Emerging Technology development through regulatory exemption are void;
- (2) federal enforcement authority extends to such technologies regardless of State or Regional non-cooperation;
- (3) jurisdictions that actively obstruct federal Emerging Technology regulation shall be ineligible for federal research and development funding for five years.

(i) **Sunset and Review.** Each provisional assignment shall include:

- (1) specific regulatory objectives to be achieved;
- (2) metrics for evaluating regulatory effectiveness;
- (3) mandatory review at the midpoint of the provisional period.

### Section 10. Vital Federal Operations Protection

(a) **Vital Federal Operations Defined.** In addition to national defense facilities protected under Section 8, the following constitute "Vital Federal Operations" entitled to protection from Regional regulatory interference:

- (1) Social Security Administration processing centers and data facilities;
- (2) Internal Revenue Service processing centers, data facilities, and regional offices;
- (3) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention facilities and laboratories;
- (4) Federal Emergency Management Agency regional headquarters and logistics centers;
- (5) Medicare and Medicaid Services processing facilities;
- (6) Federal court facilities and administrative offices;
- (7) United States Postal Service distribution centers;
- (8) Any other federal facility designated by Congress as "Vital" by statute.

(b) **Minimum Operating Guarantee.** Regions may not use exclusive-domain regulatory authority to:

- (1) deny, restrict, or condition utility services (water, electricity, natural gas, telecommunications) to Vital Federal Operations;
- (2) impose labor standards that would require reduction of operating hours or staffing below levels necessary for continuous operation;
- (3) apply zoning, permitting, or land-use restrictions that would require relocation or closure of existing Vital Federal Operations;
- (4) impose environmental or health regulations specifically targeting federal facilities without generally applicable justification.

(c) **Certification of Vital Operations Necessity.** When Regional regulations materially impede Vital Federal Operations, the head of the affected federal agency may certify a "Vital Operations Necessity":

- (1) The certification shall identify the specific regulation and specific operational impact;
- (2) The certification shall be transmitted to the Regional Government and Congress within 48 hours;
- (3) Upon certification, the identified regulation shall be suspended as applied to the federal facility for ninety (90) days pending negotiation.

(d) **Negotiated Accommodation.** During the suspension period:

- (1) The federal agency and Regional Government shall negotiate in good faith for permanent accommodation;
- (2) The federal government shall offer reasonable mitigation for Regional concerns (e.g., environmental offsets, community benefits);
- (3) If accommodation is reached, it shall be binding on both parties.

(e) **Arbitration for Unresolved Disputes.** If negotiation fails:

- (1) Either party may request binding arbitration before a three-member panel (one selected by each party, third selected by the Chief Justice);
- (2) The panel shall issue a decision within sixty (60) days balancing federal operational needs against Regional regulatory interests;
- (3) The panel may impose conditions on either party to achieve accommodation.

(f) **Anti-Hostage Provision.** A Region may not:

- (1) threaten or impose regulatory burdens on Vital Federal Operations as leverage in unrelated disputes;
- (2) coordinate with other Regions to simultaneously burden federal operations across multiple locations;
- (3) time regulatory actions to coincide with federal budget negotiations, elections, or other politically sensitive periods.

(g) **Emergency Federal Authority.** If a Region takes action that would cause imminent shutdown of a Vital Federal Operation:

- (1) The President may declare an emergency and assume temporary operational control of necessary Regional infrastructure (utilities, transportation);
- (2) Federal operation shall continue only so long as necessary to prevent shutdown;
- (3) The federal government shall compensate the Region for costs of federal operation.

(h) **Distinction from National Security Override.** This section provides protection for civilian administrative operations; Section 8 provides protection for defense operations. The standards and procedures differ because civilian operations do not implicate the same national security concerns, and Regional interests are given greater weight in balancing.

## ARTICLE III - RIGHTS FLOORS AND SUBSIDIARITY

### Section 1. Floors, Not Ceilings

Federal rights and standards establish minimum protections only.

No federal law shall be interpreted to prohibit a Region or State from exceeding such protections unless explicitly stated.

---

### Section 2. Subsidiarity with Enforcement

Authority resides at the lowest level capable of exercising it effectively, subject to judicial enforcement of constitutional boundaries.

---

### Section 3. Hierarchy of Law

(a) This Constitution is the supreme law of the United States.

(b) Within their respective spheres:

- Federal law enacted pursuant to enumerated federal powers is supreme over conflicting Regional, State, or local law.
- Regional law enacted pursuant to enumerated Regional powers is supreme over conflicting State or local law within the Region.
- State law is supreme over conflicting local law within the State.

(c) State Constitutions.

(1) State constitutions may not conflict with this Constitution or with the Regional constitution of the Region in which the State is located.

(2) State constitutions may establish protections exceeding those in the Regional or federal constitutions (floors, not ceilings).

(3) In case of conflict between a State constitution and a Regional constitution:

- the Regional constitution prevails on matters within enumerated Regional powers,
- the State constitution prevails on matters within reserved State powers,
- disputes shall be resolved by the Allocation Review Board, with appeal to the Supreme Court.

(d) Local Charters. Local government charters and ordinances are subordinate to State law and may not conflict with State, Regional, or federal law.

(e) Pre-Ratification State Law. State law in effect at ratification continues in force unless:

- inconsistent with this Constitution,
- superseded by Regional law on matters transferred to Regional authority,
- or repealed by the State.

## Design Rationale

### Why Structured Concurrency Rather Than Pure Non-Concurrency?

The original design used exclusive domain assignment to prevent jurisdictional ambiguity. However, modern governance is inherently interdependent—healthcare crosses with labor and commerce, environment with energy and trade. Pure non-concurrency generates constant boundary litigation as every policy touches multiple domains.

The Structured Concurrency Framework (Gap 269) resolves this by:

- **Maintaining true exclusives:** Core sovereignty functions (defense, currency, diplomacy) and genuinely local matters (zoning, family law, K-12) remain exclusive
- **Acknowledging inherent overlap:** Eight structured concurrent domains receive explicit floor/ceiling treatment
- **Federal floors, not mandates:** Federal authority in concurrent domains is limited to minimum standards addressing cross-regional spillover
- **Regional primary authority:** Regions have primary regulatory authority within concurrent domains
- **Dispute prevention:** Pre-enactment consultation, safe harbors, and expedited certification reduce litigation
- **Litigation management:** Filing limits and frivolousness penalties prevent strategic flooding

This approach preserves the benefits of clear jurisdiction while avoiding the rigidity that generated 500+ disputes annually in pure non-concurrency models.

### Why Rights Floors Rather Than Uniform Rights?

Uniform national rights prevent Regional policy variation and force national political battles over every rights question. Rights floors:

- establish minimum protections everywhere
- allow Regions to exceed minimums based on local preferences
- reduce political stakes of federal elections
- preserve policy diversity

### Why Subsidiarity?

Centralized authority creates:

- democratic distance (voters far from decision-makers)
- one-size-fits-all policies for diverse populations
- winner-take-all political dynamics
- authoritarian consolidation risk

Subsidiarity keeps decisions close to affected populations while ensuring baseline protections through judicial enforcement.
