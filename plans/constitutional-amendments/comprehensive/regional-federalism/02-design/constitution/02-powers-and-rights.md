---

### Section 4. Non-Concurrency Rule

---

### Section 5. Regional Exclusive Domains

(a) **Enumeration.** Regional Exclusive Domains are those areas where Regions have primary authority subject only to Federal Floors and Frameworks.

(b) **ARB Certification.** The Allocation Review Board shall certify whether legislation impacts Regional Exclusive Domains.

(c) **Supermajority Requirement.** Any bill establishing a "National Floor" or "National Framework" that the ARB has certified as impacting a Regional Exclusive Domain requires three-fifths (60%) majority of the House of Representatives for passage. This requirement may not be waived, suspended, or circumvented by House rules, and applies regardless of procedural posture (including conference reports, amendments, and reconciliation).

(d) **Pre-Legislative Domain Certification.**

(1) Before any bill establishing a National Floor or National Framework may be introduced in the House of Representatives, the bill's sponsor shall submit the proposed legislation to the Allocation Review Board for Domain Certification.

(2) Within thirty days of submission, the Board shall certify whether the proposed legislation impacts a Regional Exclusive Domain under this section.

(3) If the Board certifies that the legislation impacts a Regional Exclusive Domain:

- (i) the bill shall be subject to the supermajority requirement of subsection (c);
- (ii) this certification shall be noted in the bill's official text and cannot be removed by amendment; and
- (iii) any attempt to pass the bill by simple majority shall be void.

(4) If the Board certifies that the legislation does not impact a Regional Exclusive Domain, the bill may proceed under normal House procedures.

(5) The Board's Domain Certification is subject to judicial review only for abuse of discretion or clear legal error. Courts shall give substantial deference to the Board's determination of domain boundaries.

(6) Congress may not:

- (i) define its own jurisdiction over Regional Exclusive Domains;
- (ii) amend the definition of Regional Exclusive Domain except by constitutional amendment; or
- (iii) circumvent Domain Certification through creative bill drafting, omnibus legislation, or procedural manipulation.

(7) If the Board fails to issue certification within thirty days, the bill shall be presumptively certified as impacting a Regional Exclusive Domain, and the supermajority requirement shall apply.

### Section 6. Regional Equivalence Exemptions

(a) **Equivalence Petition.** A Region may petition the Allocation Review Board for an "Equivalence Exemption" from a specific National Floor. The Board shall grant the exemption if the Region demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence, that its alternative policy achieves the same or superior outcome as intended by the National Floor while better suiting regional economic, geographic, or demographic conditions.

(b) **Outcome Metrics.** For each National Floor, Congress shall specify measurable outcome metrics by which equivalence may be assessed. If Congress fails to specify metrics, the Allocation Review Board shall determine appropriate metrics based on the stated legislative purpose.

(c) **Provisional Compliance.** Pending Allocation Review Board determination on an Equivalence Petition:

(1) The Region may implement its alternative policy on a provisional basis;

(2) The Region shall demonstrate a good-faith compliance mechanism, which may include:

- (i) posting a compliance bond in an amount determined by the Board,
- (ii) establishing an escrow fund for potential remediation costs,
- (iii) implementing enhanced monitoring and reporting, or
- (iv) other assurance mechanisms the Board deems adequate;

(3) Provisional implementation shall not constitute a violation of the National Floor during the pendency of the petition;

(4) If the petition is denied, the Region shall have one hundred eighty days to achieve full compliance with the National Floor.

### Section 7. Allocation Review Board

#### Establishment and Composition

(a) **Establishment.** There is hereby established an Allocation Review Board (ARB) to resolve disputes regarding the allocation of powers among federal, Regional, and State governments.

(b) **Composition.** The ARB shall consist of nine members appointed as follows:

(1) Three members appointed by the President with Senate confirmation;

(2) Two members appointed by the Judicial Conference of the United States from among retired federal and state appellate judges who have never held partisan elected office;

(3) Two members elected by the Regional Governors, with each Region casting one vote and no Region voting for a resident of its own Region;

(4) Two members appointed by agreement of the minority leadership of both houses of Congress.

(c) **Party Balance.** No more than four members may be affiliated with the same political party. For purposes of this subsection, "independent" members count toward the party with which they most recently affiliated or, if never affiliated, are assigned by the Chief Justice to maintain balance.

(d) **Experience Diversity.** At least two members must have primary professional experience in state or local government (not federal service), and at least one member must have primary experience in private sector or academic roles.

(e) **Terms and Removal.** Members serve staggered seven-year terms, may serve only one term, and may not be removed except for cause (misconduct, incapacity, or conviction of a felony). Removal requires two-thirds vote of the Senate.

(f) **Vacancy Filling.** Vacancies shall be filled by the original appointing authority within ninety days. If not filled within ninety days, the Chief Justice shall make a temporary appointment from among retired appellate judges until the original authority acts.

#### Jurisdiction and Standards

(g) **Jurisdiction.** The ARB shall have original jurisdiction over:

(1) Disputes between Regions concerning allocation of powers;

(2) Challenges to federal exercise of authority as exceeding enumerated powers;

(3) Challenges to Regional exercise of authority as exceeding enumerated powers;

(4) Disputes regarding spillover effects and non-concurrency;

(5) Certification of legislation as within appropriate governmental authority.

(h) **Standards.** The ARB shall apply the allocation framework established by Congress, or in its absence, the default rules of Article XXI. The ARB shall interpret this Constitution to preserve the balance of power among federal, Regional, and State governments.

#### Appeals and Binding Effect

(i) **Immediate Binding Effect.** In all matters of power allocation:

(1) The ARB's ruling is immediately binding upon issuance;

(2) The ruling shall not be stayed pending appeal to the Supreme Court except as provided in subsection (l);

(3) Parties must comply with ARB rulings during any appeal period.

(j) **Supreme Court Review Scope.** The Supreme Court may review ARB decisions only for:

(1) Errors of constitutional interpretation;

(2) Violation of due process in ARB proceedings;

(3) The Supreme Court may not reweigh factual evidence or substitute its judgment on factual matters.

(k) **Appeals.** ARB decisions are final on factual matters. Questions of constitutional interpretation may be appealed to the Supreme Court.

(l) **Limited Stay Authority.** The Supreme Court may stay an ARB ruling only upon finding:

(1) Substantial likelihood that the ARB committed clear constitutional error;

(2) Irreparable harm to the appellant absent stay;

(3) The stay would not substantially harm other parties or the public interest;

(4) Stay requests must be decided within seven days.

#### Anti-Remand Provisions

(m) **No Factual Remand.** The Supreme Court may not remand a power-allocation dispute to the ARB for:

(1) Further factual findings;

(2) Reconsideration of evidence;

(3) Application of a "new" factual standard.

(n) **Reversal or Affirmance Only.** Upon review of an ARB power-allocation decision:

(1) The Supreme Court shall affirm or reverse;

(2) If reversed, the Supreme Court shall specify the correct constitutional interpretation;

(3) The ARB shall apply the Court's interpretation to the existing factual record without further proceedings.

(o) **One Appeal Limit.** Each party may appeal an ARB power-allocation ruling to the Supreme Court only once:

(1) Subsequent appeals on the same matter are barred;

(2) ARB application of Supreme Court interpretation is not separately appealable;

(3) The ARB's post-reversal ruling is final.

#### Parallel Filing Prevention

(p) **Exclusive Initial Jurisdiction.** Power-allocation disputes shall be filed first with the ARB:

(1) The Supreme Court shall not accept original jurisdiction over power-allocation matters;

(2) Filings that characterize power-allocation as "pure constitutional interpretation" shall be transferred to the ARB;

(3) The ARB shall determine whether a matter involves power allocation.

(q) **Sequential Proceeding Requirement.** Parties may not:

(1) File parallel proceedings in the ARB and Supreme Court on related matters;

(2) Seek Supreme Court review until ARB proceedings are complete;

(3) Raise arguments in Supreme Court that were not presented to the ARB.

(r) **Expedited Timeline Enforcement.** The combined timeline for ARB ruling and Supreme Court review shall not exceed:

(1) One hundred twenty days from initial filing to final resolution;

(2) Failure of either body to rule within its allotted time results in automatic ruling for the non-moving party;

(3) Extensions only for extraordinary circumstances certified by the Chief Justice.

#### Adversarial Review Office

(s) **Establishment of ARO.** There is established within the ARB an Adversarial Review Office ("ARO"), structurally independent from the ARB's certification and determination functions.

(3) Independent legal counsel with authority to file court actions.

(u) **ARO Function.** The ARO shall:

(1) Review every Domain Certification, Equivalence Determination, Preemption Certification, and other major determination;

(2) Issue a public "Adversarial Report" identifying potential errors, alternative interpretations, methodological concerns, and evidence of bias;

(3) Have standing to challenge determinations in federal court on behalf of affected parties or the public interest;

(4) Refer evidence of misconduct to the Department of Justice Inspector General.

(v) **Review Completion Trigger.** No determination shall take effect until:

(1) The ARO has issued its Adversarial Report; OR

(2) The ARO has certified in writing that it has completed its review and declines to issue a report; OR

(3) The ARO has petitioned the National Constitutional Court for a time extension due to data volume or complexity, and such extension has expired.

#### Regional Override

(w) **Regional Override of Determinations.** If five of the seven Regional Governors jointly certify that a determination by the ARB:

(1) Exceeds the ARB's statutory or constitutional authority;

(2) Reflects systematic bias toward federal expansion or centralization; or

(3) Fundamentally misapplies the criteria established by law;

the determination shall be suspended pending expedited judicial review.

(1) This section may not be invoked more than twice per calendar year;

(2) A Region that participates in a frivolous override (as determined by the Court) shall be barred from participating in the next override petition;

(3) Override may not be used to challenge individual case determinations; only determinations of general applicability or systematic patterns.

#### Systematic Bias Detection

(z) **Statistical Monitoring.** The Government Accountability Office shall annually analyze all ARB determinations for systematic patterns, including:

(1) Certification and determination outcomes correlated with presidential administration;

(2) Regional win/loss rates in contested proceedings;

(3) Correlation between outcomes and the appointing authority of deciding members;

(4) Deviation from historical baseline patterns;

(5) ARO challenge success rates over time.

(aa) **Bias Finding.** If GAO analysis demonstrates statistically significant correlation (p < 0.05) between determination outcomes and political factors over any rolling three-year period:

(1) The finding shall be publicly reported to Congress, all Regional Governors, and the Chief Justice;

(2) All determinations during the affected period shall be subject to expedited judicial review upon petition by any affected party, with de novo standard of review;

(3) Congress shall hold public hearings within sixty days;

(4) The ARB shall submit a remediation plan within ninety days.

(2) Replacement members shall be appointed by lottery from a pool consisting of retired federal appellate judges, retired state supreme court justices, and former deans of ABA-accredited law schools who have never held partisan elected office;

(3) Lottery appointments shall serve three-year terms, after which normal appointment procedures resume;

(4) Members removed under this subsection are permanently ineligible for reappointment to any technocratic body.

#### Budgetary Independence

(cc) **Automatic Funding Formula.** The operating budget of the ARB and the ARO shall be:

(1) Set as a fixed percentage of federal revenue (0.002% for the ARB; 0.0005% for the ARO);

(2) Automatically appropriated without annual congressional action;

(3) Adjusted annually for inflation using the Consumer Price Index.

(dd) **Prohibition on Budgetary Manipulation.** Congress may not:

(1) Reduce funding below the formula amount;

(3) Transfer formula funds to other purposes;

(4) Delay disbursement of formula funds beyond thirty days after the start of each fiscal year.

(ee) **Enforcement.** Any member of the ARB, or the ARO, may petition the Supreme Court for a writ of mandamus to compel disbursement of formula funds. Such petitions shall be heard on an expedited basis.

## ARTICLE III - RIGHTS FLOORS AND SUBSIDIARITY

### Section 1. Floors, Not Ceilings

Federal rights and standards establish minimum protections only.

No federal law shall be interpreted to prohibit a Region or State from exceeding such protections unless explicitly stated.

---

### Section 2. Subsidiarity with Enforcement

Authority resides at the lowest level capable of exercising it effectively, subject to judicial enforcement of constitutional boundaries.

---

### Section 3. Hierarchy of Law

(a) This Constitution is the supreme law of the United States.

(b) Within their respective spheres:

- Federal law enacted pursuant to enumerated federal powers is supreme over conflicting Regional, State, or local law.
- Regional law enacted pursuant to enumerated Regional powers is supreme over conflicting State or local law within the Region.
- State law is supreme over conflicting local law within the State.

(c) State Constitutions.

(1) State constitutions may not conflict with this Constitution or with the Regional constitution of the Region in which the State is located.

(2) State constitutions may establish protections exceeding those in the Regional or federal constitutions (floors, not ceilings).

(3) In case of conflict between a State constitution and a Regional constitution:

- the Regional constitution prevails on matters within enumerated Regional powers,
- the State constitution prevails on matters within reserved State powers,
- disputes shall be resolved by the Allocation Review Board, with appeal to the Supreme Court.

(d) Local Charters. Local government charters and ordinances are subordinate to State law and may not conflict with State, Regional, or federal law.

(e) Pre-Ratification State Law. State law in effect at ratification continues in force unless:

- inconsistent with this Constitution,
- superseded by Regional law on matters transferred to Regional authority,
- or repealed by the State.

---

## Design Rationale

### Why Exclusive Rather Than Concurrent Powers?

Traditional federalism allows concurrent jurisdiction, creating ambiguity exploited by both levels of government. The non-concurrency rule:

- prevents federal "creeping preemption" of Regional/State authority
- prevents Regions from obstructing federal enumerated powers
- creates clear lines for judicial enforcement
- reduces intergovernmental conflict

### Why Rights Floors Rather Than Uniform Rights?

Uniform national rights prevent Regional policy variation and force national political battles over every rights question. Rights floors:

- establish minimum protections everywhere
- allow Regions to exceed minimums based on local preferences
- reduce political stakes of federal elections
- preserve policy diversity

### Why Subsidiarity?

Centralized authority creates:

- democratic distance (voters far from decision-makers)
- one-size-fits-all policies for diverse populations
- winner-take-all political dynamics
- authoritarian consolidation risk

Subsidiarity keeps decisions close to affected populations while ensuring baseline protections through judicial enforcement.
