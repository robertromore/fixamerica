- (i) K-12 education curriculum and standards, except as provided in Section 21 of this Article;
- (ii) Land use, zoning, and local planning;
- (iii) State and local government structure;
- (iv) Family law (marriage, divorce, custody, adoption);

- (i) ARB recommendations have no legal effect absent legislative action by Congress and ratification by a majority of Regional Assemblies;
- (ii) Failure of Congress or the Regions to act on a recommendation does not alter existing classifications;
- (iii) No domain may be reclassified by judicial interpretation; reclassification requires the legislative process specified herein.

---

### Section 2. Enumerated Regional Powers

Regions shall have exclusive authority over:

- inter-state infrastructure and transportation corridors,
- Regional labor standards above federal floors,
- housing coordination and supply targets,
- energy generation and transmission planning,

---

### Section 3-A. Rights Floor Enforcement Constraints

(a) **Rights Floor Authority.** Congress may enforce minimum protections against Regional abridgment only where:

- (i) The right is explicitly enumerated in this Constitution or its amendments; OR
- (ii) The right has been established by constitutional amendment ratified after the effective date of this Section.

(b) **No Implied Rights Floors.** Congress may not claim enforcement authority based on:

- (i) Penumbral reasoning from enumerated rights;
- (ii) Substantive due process doctrine;
- (iii) General welfare, commerce, or spending power rationales recharacterized as rights enforcement; OR
- (iv) International treaty obligations not separately ratified as constitutional amendments.

(c) **Enforcement Prerequisites.** Before exercising rights floor enforcement authority, Congress shall:

- (i) **Identify the enumerated right** by specific textual citation;
- (ii) **Document Regional violation** with specific findings of fact, including identification of the Regional law, policy, or practice alleged to violate the floor;
- (iii) **Demonstrate necessity** showing that judicial remedies are inadequate to protect the enumerated right; AND
- (iv) **Publish the evidentiary record** supporting enforcement in its entirety within 30 days of enactment, subject only to narrowly tailored national security redactions. Redacted material shall be provided in full to reviewing courts under seal.

(d) **Judicial Review.** Any exercise of rights floor enforcement authority shall be subject to de novo judicial review. Courts shall apply no deference to congressional characterization of:

- (i) Whether the asserted right is enumerated;
- (ii) Whether Regional action violates the floor; OR
- (iii) Whether judicial remedies are inadequate.

(e) **Pretext Analysis.** Courts shall invalidate enforcement actions where:

- (i) The stated rights justification is pretextual;
- (ii) The enforcement mechanism bears no rational relationship to protecting the enumerated right; OR
- (iii) The enforcement imposes burdens on Regional authority disproportionate to any plausible rights-protective benefit.

A rebuttable presumption of pretext arises where enforcement targets Regional policies that Congress has previously sought to override through ordinary legislation.

(f) **Individual Litigation Unaffected.** Nothing in this Section limits the ability of individuals to seek judicial relief for violations of constitutional rights, nor the authority of courts to grant such relief in individual cases. This Section constrains only congressional claims of enforcement authority under enabling clauses.

---

### Section 4. Concurrent Authority Framework

(a) **Federal Floor, Regional Ceiling.** In Structured Concurrent Domains:

- (i) Congress may establish minimum standards ("floors") applicable nationwide;
- (ii) Regions may exceed federal floors within their territory;
- (iii) Regions may not fall below federal floors;
- (iv) Federal floors require three-fifths vote in both houses and certification by the ARB that the floor addresses genuine cross-regional spillover.

(b) **Regional Primary Authority.** Within Structured Concurrent Domains:

- (i) Regions have primary regulatory authority;
- (ii) Federal authority is limited to establishing floors, not comprehensive regulation;
- (iii) Federal enforcement operates only when Regional enforcement fails.

(c) **Spillover Trigger.** Federal floor authority may be exercised only upon ARB certification that:

- (i) The problem addressed has documented cross-regional effects;
- (ii) Regional action alone cannot adequately address the spillover;
- (iii) The proposed floor is the minimum necessary to address the spillover;
- (iv) The floor does not prescribe specific means, only outcomes.

(c-1) **ARB Role Limitation.** In certifying spillover and necessity under subsection (c), the ARB shall not evaluate the wisdom, desirability, or policy merits of the proposed floor, but only whether the constitutional criteria for federal floor authority are satisfied.

(d) **Automatic Sunset.** Federal floors in Structured Concurrent Domains:

- (i) Expire after ten years unless reauthorized;
- (ii) May be reauthorized by simple majority upon ARB certification that spillover conditions persist;
- (iii) Shall be reviewed by the ARB at years 5 and 8 with public report on continued necessity.

(e) **Regional Variance.** A Region may petition for variance from a federal floor upon demonstrating:

- (i) An alternative approach that achieves equivalent spillover mitigation;
- (ii) The variance will not export harms to other Regions;
- (iii) Approval by ARB, which shall issue variance within 90 days or state reasons for denial.

(f) **Accountability Labeling.**

(1) **Federal Responsibility Statement.** Federal floors in Structured Concurrent Domains shall include a Responsibility Statement identifying:

- (i) which outcomes are federally guaranteed;
- (ii) which implementation choices are delegated to Regions.

(2) **Regional Compliance Statement.** Regional legislation in Structured Concurrent Domains shall include a Compliance Statement identifying:

- (i) which provisions implement federal floor requirements;
- (ii) which provisions exceed federal floors as Regional policy choices;
- (iii) which implementation methods were selected by the Region from among permissible alternatives.

(3) **Specificity Requirement.** Responsibility Statements and Compliance Statements shall be sufficiently specific to permit a reasonable reader to distinguish mandated requirements from discretionary policy choices.

(4) **Effect of Non-Compliance.** Failure to include required Statements:

- (i) does not invalidate the underlying legislation;
- (ii) creates rebuttable presumption that challenged provisions are discretionary Regional choices for purposes of accountability;
- (iii) may be cured by amendment at any time.

(g) **Non-Concurrent Domains.** Powers in Exclusive Federal Domains and Exclusive Regional Domains (as defined in Section 1(e)) shall be exclusive to the level to which they are assigned unless this Constitution explicitly authorizes shared jurisdiction.

---

### Section 4-A. Dispute Reduction and Litigation Management

(a) **Pre-Enactment Consultation.** Before enacting legislation in a Structured Concurrent Domain:

- (i) The Federal Government shall provide 60 days' notice to all Regional Governors with draft text;
- (ii) Regions shall provide 30 days' notice to the Federal Government and other Regions with draft text;
- (iii) Any level may request ARB advisory opinion during notice period;
- (iv) Advisory opinions issued within 45 days; non-binding but precedential.

(b) **Expedited ARB Certification.** For legislation in Structured Concurrent Domains:

- (i) ARB shall issue floor certifications within 60 days;
- (ii) Failure to issue within 60 days creates rebuttable presumption of validity;
- (iii) Expedited certifications are provisional and subject to full review within one year.

(c) **Presumption of Validity.** In judicial review of Concurrent Domain legislation:

- (i) Regional legislation exceeding federal floors is presumed valid;
- (ii) Federal floors with ARB spillover certification are presumed valid;
- (iii) Challenger bears burden of demonstrating invalidity by clear and convincing evidence.

(d) **Safe Harbors.** The ARB shall publish:

- (i) Model legislation templates that are pre-certified as valid;
- (ii) "Bright line" lists of clearly permissible Regional and Federal actions;
- (iii) Quarterly guidance on emerging issues.

(e) **Annual Limits.** The ARB shall not be required to adjudicate more than:

- (i) Fifty (50) domain boundary disputes per year from Federal Government;
- (ii) Twenty (20) domain boundary disputes per year per Region;
- (iii) Disputes exceeding limits shall be queued by filing date.

(f) **Hardship Exception.** The ARB may grant leave to exceed annual filing limits upon a showing that:

- (i) Denial would result in irreparable harm to Regional constitutional authority; and
- (ii) The dispute could not reasonably have been anticipated and filed earlier.

(g) **Consolidation Authority.** The ARB shall consolidate:

- (i) Disputes raising substantially similar domain questions;
- (ii) Disputes involving the same parties on related matters;
- (iii) Consolidated disputes count as one against filing limits.

(h) **Frivolousness Penalties.** A party that files a domain dispute found frivolous:

- (i) Shall pay the opposing party's costs;
- (ii) Loses one filing slot for the following year per frivolous filing;
- (iii) After three frivolous filings in five years, requires ARB leave to file.

---

### Section 5. Regional Exclusive Domains

(a) **Enumeration.** Regional Exclusive Domains are those areas where Regions have primary authority subject only to Federal Floors and Frameworks.

(b) **ARB Certification.** The Allocation Review Board shall certify whether legislation impacts Regional Exclusive Domains.

(c) **Supermajority Requirement.** Any bill establishing a "National Floor" or "National Framework" that the ARB has certified as impacting a Regional Exclusive Domain requires three-fifths (60%) majority of the House of Representatives for passage. This requirement may not be waived, suspended, or circumvented by House rules, and applies regardless of procedural posture (including conference reports, amendments, and reconciliation).

(d) **Pre-Legislative Domain Certification.**

(1) Before any bill establishing a National Floor or National Framework may be introduced in the House of Representatives, the bill's sponsor shall submit the proposed legislation to the Allocation Review Board for Domain Certification.

(2) Within thirty days of submission, the Board shall certify whether the proposed legislation impacts a Regional Exclusive Domain under this section.

(3) If the Board certifies that the legislation impacts a Regional Exclusive Domain:

- (i) the bill shall be subject to the supermajority requirement of subsection (c);
- (ii) this certification shall be noted in the bill's official text and cannot be removed by amendment; and
- (iii) any attempt to pass the bill by simple majority shall be void.

(4) If the Board certifies that the legislation does not impact a Regional Exclusive Domain, the bill may proceed under normal House procedures.

(5) The Board's Domain Certification is subject to judicial review only for abuse of discretion or clear legal error. Courts shall give substantial deference to the Board's determination of domain boundaries.

(6) Congress may not:

- (i) define its own jurisdiction over Regional Exclusive Domains;
- (ii) amend the definition of Regional Exclusive Domain except by constitutional amendment; or
- (iii) circumvent Domain Certification through creative bill drafting, omnibus legislation, or procedural manipulation. The single-subject requirement of Article IV, Section 5-A provides the enforcement mechanism for this prohibition.

(7) If the Board fails to issue certification within thirty days, the bill shall be presumptively certified as NOT impacting a Regional Exclusive Domain, and the bill may proceed under normal House procedures. This default prevents certification delay from being used to obstruct legislation.

#### Anti-Bottleneck Provisions

(8) **Expedited Certification Track.** The Board shall establish an expedited certification track for:

- (i) bills addressing declared emergencies;
- (ii) bills with bipartisan House sponsorship exceeding sixty percent;
- (iii) bills that are substantially similar to previously certified legislation.
Expedited certifications shall be completed within ten days.

(9) **Staffing and Capacity Requirements.** The Board shall maintain sufficient staff to process certification requests without backlog:

- (i) If average certification time exceeds twenty days for three consecutive months, the Board shall hire additional staff within sixty days;
- (ii) Certification staff funding is mandatory spending, not subject to annual appropriation;
- (iii) The Board shall publish monthly certification statistics including filing volume, average processing time, and pending requests.

(10) **Backlog Remediation.** If pending certification requests exceed fifty at any time:

- (i) The Board shall implement emergency processing procedures;
- (ii) New requests shall be processed in order of filing date;
- (iii) Requests pending more than twenty days shall be automatically approved for normal House procedures unless the Board affirmatively certifies Regional Exclusive Domain impact within five additional days.

(11) **Anti-Strategic-Delay.** No party may file certification requests for the purpose of creating backlog or delaying unrelated legislation:

- (i) Frivolous or duplicative requests may be summarily dismissed;
- (ii) A pattern of filing requests subsequently withdrawn may result in filing restrictions;
- (iii) The Board may consolidate substantially similar requests.

(12) **Congressional Bypass for Obstruction.** If the Board fails to process certifications due to quorum failure, member vacancies, or other institutional dysfunction for more than sixty consecutive days:

- (i) The House may proceed with legislation without certification by a three-fifths vote;
- (ii) Such legislation shall be subject to expedited judicial review within ninety days of enactment;
- (iii) This bypass may not be used if the Board is functioning normally but simply has a backlog.

---

### Section 6. Regional Equivalence Exemptions

(a) **Equivalence Petition.** A Region may petition the Allocation Review Board for an "Equivalence Exemption" from a specific National Floor. The Board shall grant the exemption if the Region demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence, that its alternative policy achieves the same or superior outcome as intended by the National Floor while better suiting regional economic, geographic, or demographic conditions.

(b) **Outcome Metrics.** For each National Floor, Congress shall specify measurable outcome metrics by which equivalence may be assessed. If Congress fails to specify metrics, the Allocation Review Board shall determine appropriate metrics based on the stated legislative purpose.

(c) **Provisional Compliance.** Pending Allocation Review Board determination on an Equivalence Petition:

(1) The Region may implement its alternative policy on a provisional basis;

(2) The Region shall demonstrate a good-faith compliance mechanism, which may include:

- (i) posting a compliance bond in an amount determined by the Board,
- (ii) establishing an escrow fund for potential remediation costs,
- (iii) implementing enhanced monitoring and reporting, or
- (iv) other assurance mechanisms the Board deems adequate;

(3) Provisional implementation shall not constitute a violation of the National Floor during the pendency of the petition;

(4) If the petition is denied, the Region shall have one hundred eighty days to achieve full compliance with the National Floor.

---

### Section 6-A. Infrastructure Prioritization Transparency

(a) **Published Criteria.** Each Region shall publish and maintain criteria for infrastructure sequencing, including:

- (i) Factors determining project priority;
- (ii) Methodology for applying factors to specific projects;
- (iii) Timeline projections for queued projects.

(b) **Prohibited Factors.** No prioritization criteria may include:

- (i) Voting patterns of affected localities;
- (ii) Party registration of affected populations;
- (iii) Prior electoral outcomes in affected areas;
- (iv) Political affiliation of local officials.

(c) **Proxy Measure Limitation.** Criteria that correlate greater than 0.6 with prohibited factors require independent infrastructure justification. "Independent infrastructure justification" means a justification that, when applied neutrally across all localities, would not systematically correlate with political alignment.

(d) **Public Accessibility.** Prioritization criteria and their application shall be:

- (i) Published on publicly accessible websites;
- (ii) Updated within 30 days of any methodology change;
- (iii) Accompanied by explanation of how current projects were prioritized.

(e) **Presumption of Need.**

(1) **Prima Facie Case.** A prima facie case of patronage sequencing is established if a locality demonstrates:

- (i) The locality is demonstrably underserved relative to the Regional average for the infrastructure category; AND
- (ii) A sequencing decision delays investment by more than three (3) years relative to comparable projects; AND
- (iii) A pattern of delays correlates with political alignment at greater than 0.5 statistical significance.

(2) **Burden Shift.** Upon prima facie showing:

- (i) The Region bears the burden of demonstrating independent infrastructure justification;
- (ii) Justifications must be specific to the delayed project, not general policy;
- (iii) Post-hoc justifications are viewed with skepticism.

(3) **Independent Infrastructure Justification.** Justification is independent if it:

- (i) Applies neutrally across all localities;
- (ii) Would not systematically disadvantage politically disfavored areas when applied consistently;
- (iii) Is documented in contemporaneous records, not reconstructed for litigation.

(f) **Infrastructure Sequencing Audits.**

(1) **Audit Authority.** The Regional Auditor (or equivalent independent official) may:

- (i) Audit infrastructure sequencing decisions for compliance with this Section;
- (ii) Conduct statistical correlation analysis between sequencing and political variables;
- (iii) Publish annual reports on infrastructure allocation patterns.

(2) **Data Requirements.** Regions shall maintain and provide to auditors:

- (i) Complete sequencing decisions for the prior ten (10) years;
- (ii) Stated justifications for each decision at time of decision;
- (iii) Outcome data enabling correlation analysis.

(3) **Delegation Non-Relief.** Delegation of infrastructure sequencing to private or quasi-private entities does not relieve the Region of responsibility for compliance with this Section. Private entities exercising delegated sequencing authority are subject to the same transparency and anti-patronage requirements.

(4) **Public Reporting.** Audit results shall be:

- (i) Published annually;
- (ii) Transmitted to the ARB for potential enforcement action;
- (iii) Available to affected localities for use in challenges.

(g) **Remedies for Sequencing Patronage.**

(1) **Standing.** Affected localities have standing to challenge sequencing patterns if they meet the prima facie standard of subsection (e).

(2) **ARB Authority.** Upon finding patronage sequencing, the ARB may:

- (i) Order revised prioritization using neutral methodology;
- (ii) Order accelerated timelines for demonstrably disadvantaged localities;
- (iii) Appoint an infrastructure sequencing monitor for up to five (5) years.

(3) **Prospective-First Remedies.** Remedies shall prioritize prospective correction over retroactive reallocation except where delay has caused irreparable harm. No monetary damages for past sequencing; remedy is prospective correction of methodology and accelerated timelines.

(4) **Pattern Evidence.** In challenges under this Section:

- (i) Pattern evidence is admissible and probative;
- (ii) Individual intent is not required if pattern establishes discriminatory effect;
- (iii) Statistical evidence of correlation may establish prima facie case.

### Section 7. Allocation Review Board

#### Establishment and Composition

(a) **Establishment.** There is hereby established an Allocation Review Board (ARB) to resolve disputes regarding the allocation of powers among federal, Regional, and State governments.

(b) **Composition.** The ARB shall consist of nine members appointed as follows:

(1) Three members appointed by the President with Senate confirmation;

(2) Two members appointed by the Judicial Conference of the United States from among retired federal and state appellate judges who have never held partisan elected office;

(3) Two members elected by the Regional Governors, with each Region casting one vote and no Region voting for a resident of its own Region;

(4) Two members appointed by agreement of the minority leadership of both houses of Congress.

(c) **Party Balance.** No more than four members may be affiliated with the same political party. For purposes of this subsection, "independent" members count toward the party with which they most recently affiliated or, if never affiliated, are assigned by the Chief Justice to maintain balance.

(d) **Experience Diversity.** At least two members must have primary professional experience in state or local government (not federal service), and at least one member must have primary experience in private sector or academic roles.

(e) **Terms and Removal.** Members serve staggered seven-year terms, may serve only one term, and may not be removed except for cause (misconduct, incapacity, or conviction of a felony). Removal requires two-thirds vote of the Senate.

(f) **Vacancy Filling.** Vacancies shall be filled by the original appointing authority within ninety days. If not filled within ninety days, the Chief Justice shall make a temporary appointment from among retired appellate judges until the original authority acts.

#### Jurisdiction and Standards

(g) **Jurisdiction.** The ARB shall have original jurisdiction over:

(1) Disputes between Regions concerning allocation of powers;

(2) Challenges to federal exercise of authority as exceeding enumerated powers;

(3) Challenges to Regional exercise of authority as exceeding enumerated powers;

(4) Disputes regarding spillover effects and non-concurrency;

(5) Certification of legislation as within appropriate governmental authority.

(h) **Standards.** The ARB shall apply the allocation framework established by Congress, or in its absence, the default rules of Article XXI. The ARB shall interpret this Constitution to preserve the balance of power among federal, Regional, and State governments.

#### Appeals and Binding Effect

(i) **Immediate Binding Effect.** In all matters of power allocation:

(1) The ARB's ruling is immediately binding upon issuance;

(2) The ruling shall not be stayed pending appeal to the Supreme Court except as provided in subsection (l);

(3) Parties must comply with ARB rulings during any appeal period.

(j) **Supreme Court Review Scope.** The Supreme Court may review ARB decisions only for:

(1) Errors of constitutional interpretation;

(2) Violation of due process in ARB proceedings;

(3) The Supreme Court may not reweigh factual evidence or substitute its judgment on factual matters.

(k) **Appeals.** ARB decisions are final on factual matters. Questions of constitutional interpretation may be appealed to the Supreme Court.

(l) **Limited Stay Authority.** The Supreme Court may stay an ARB ruling only upon finding:

(1) Substantial likelihood that the ARB committed clear constitutional error;

(2) Irreparable harm to the appellant absent stay;

(3) The stay would not substantially harm other parties or the public interest;

(4) Stay requests must be decided within seven days.

#### Anti-Remand Provisions

(m) **No Factual Remand.** The Supreme Court may not remand a power-allocation dispute to the ARB for:

(1) Further factual findings;

(2) Reconsideration of evidence;

(3) Application of a "new" factual standard.

(n) **Reversal or Affirmance Only.** Upon review of an ARB power-allocation decision:

(1) The Supreme Court shall affirm or reverse;

(2) If reversed, the Supreme Court shall specify the correct constitutional interpretation;

(3) The ARB shall apply the Court's interpretation to the existing factual record without further proceedings.

(o) **One Appeal Limit.** Each party may appeal an ARB power-allocation ruling to the Supreme Court only once:

(1) Subsequent appeals on the same matter are barred;

(2) ARB application of Supreme Court interpretation is not separately appealable;

(3) The ARB's post-reversal ruling is final.

#### Parallel Filing Prevention

(p) **Exclusive Initial Jurisdiction.** Power-allocation disputes shall be filed first with the ARB:

(1) The Supreme Court shall not accept original jurisdiction over power-allocation matters;

(2) Filings that characterize power-allocation as "pure constitutional interpretation" shall be transferred to the ARB;

(3) The ARB shall determine whether a matter involves power allocation.

(q) **Sequential Proceeding Requirement.** Parties may not:

(1) File parallel proceedings in the ARB and Supreme Court on related matters;

(2) Seek Supreme Court review until ARB proceedings are complete;

(3) Raise arguments in Supreme Court that were not presented to the ARB.

(r) **Expedited Timeline Enforcement.** The combined timeline for ARB ruling and Supreme Court review shall not exceed:

(1) One hundred twenty days from initial filing to final resolution;

(2) Failure of either body to rule within its allotted time results in automatic ruling for the non-moving party;

(3) Extensions only for extraordinary circumstances certified by the Chief Justice.

#### Adversarial Review Office

(s) **Establishment of ARO.** There is established within the ARB an Adversarial Review Office ("ARO"), structurally independent from the ARB's certification and determination functions.

(t) **ARO Composition.** The ARO shall consist of:

(1) A Chief Adversarial Officer appointed by the minority party leadership of both houses of Congress (by agreement) for a non-renewable five-year term;

(2) Deputy Adversarial Officers and staff sufficient to review all major determinations, with staffing levels set by formula (not annual appropriation);

(3) Independent legal counsel with authority to file court actions.

(u) **ARO Function.** The ARO shall:

(1) Review every Domain Certification, Equivalence Determination, Preemption Certification, and other major determination;

(2) Issue a public "Adversarial Report" identifying potential errors, alternative interpretations, methodological concerns, and evidence of bias;

(3) Have standing to challenge determinations in federal court on behalf of affected parties or the public interest;

(4) Refer evidence of misconduct to the Department of Justice Inspector General.

(v) **Review Completion Trigger.** No determination shall take effect until:

(1) The ARO has issued its Adversarial Report; OR

(2) The ARO has certified in writing that it has completed its review and declines to issue a report; OR

(3) The ARO has petitioned the National Constitutional Court for a time extension due to data volume or complexity, and such extension has expired.

#### Regional Override

(w) **Regional Override of Determinations.** If five of the seven Regional Governors jointly certify that a determination by the ARB:

(1) Exceeds the ARB's statutory or constitutional authority;

(2) Reflects systematic bias toward federal expansion or centralization; or

(3) Fundamentally misapplies the criteria established by law;

the determination shall be suspended pending expedited judicial review.

(x) **Expedited Override Review.** Upon Regional Override certification:

(1) The Supreme Court shall grant expedited review within thirty days;

(2) Oral argument shall be held within sixty days of granting review;

(3) Decision shall be issued within ninety days of oral argument.

(y) **Override Limitations.**

(1) This section may not be invoked more than twice per calendar year;

(2) A Region that participates in a frivolous override (as determined by the Court) shall be barred from participating in the next override petition;

(3) Override may not be used to challenge individual case determinations; only determinations of general applicability or systematic patterns.

#### Systematic Bias Detection

(z) **Statistical Monitoring.** The Government Accountability Office shall annually analyze all ARB determinations for systematic patterns, including:

(1) Certification and determination outcomes correlated with presidential administration;

(2) Regional win/loss rates in contested proceedings;

(3) Correlation between outcomes and the appointing authority of deciding members;

(4) Deviation from historical baseline patterns;

(5) ARO challenge success rates over time.

(aa) **Bias Finding.** If GAO analysis demonstrates statistically significant correlation (p < 0.05) between determination outcomes and political factors over any rolling three-year period:

(1) The finding shall be publicly reported to Congress, all Regional Governors, and the Chief Justice;

(2) All determinations during the affected period shall be subject to expedited judicial review upon petition by any affected party, with de novo standard of review;

(3) Congress shall hold public hearings within sixty days;

(4) The ARB shall submit a remediation plan within ninety days.

(bb) **Structural Response.** If bias findings persist for two consecutive three-year periods (six years total):

(1) All current members' terms shall automatically expire;

(2) Replacement members shall be appointed by lottery from a pool consisting of retired federal appellate judges, retired state supreme court justices, and former deans of ABA-accredited law schools who have never held partisan elected office;

(3) Lottery appointments shall serve three-year terms, after which normal appointment procedures resume;

(4) Members removed under this subsection are permanently ineligible for reappointment to any technocratic body.

#### Budgetary Independence

(cc) **Automatic Funding Formula.** The operating budget of the ARB and the ARO shall be:

(1) Set as a fixed percentage of federal revenue (0.002% for the ARB; 0.0005% for the ARO);

(2) Automatically appropriated without annual congressional action;

(3) Adjusted annually for inflation using the Consumer Price Index.

(dd) **Prohibition on Budgetary Manipulation.** Congress may not:

(1) Reduce funding below the formula amount;

(2) Impose conditions on the use of formula funds;

(3) Transfer formula funds to other purposes;

(4) Delay disbursement of formula funds beyond thirty days after the start of each fiscal year.

(ee) **Enforcement.** Any member of the ARB, or the ARO, may petition the Supreme Court for a writ of mandamus to compel disbursement of formula funds. Such petitions shall be heard on an expedited basis.

#### Anti-Consolidation Safeguards

(ff) **Cross-Partisan Appointment Mandate.** To prevent a single political movement from bypassing constitutional checks through unified control of the Federal and Regional governments:

(ff-1) **Council of Governors Approval.** Appointments to the ARB, IFC, and FDCA require a three-fifths (60%) vote of the Council of Governors, ensuring that a simple partisan alignment between the President and a majority of Governors cannot capture these bodies.

(ff-2) **Adversarial Minority Key.** The minority party in the House of Representatives shall appoint a "Transparency Observer" to each Constitutional Oversight Body with full access to deliberations and data, but no vote. The Observer may:

- (1) attend all meetings, including closed sessions;
- (2) access all documents, data, and communications;
- (3) publish dissenting reports and minority analyses;
- (4) refer concerns directly to Congress and the public.

(ff-3) **Unified Control Supermajority.** If at any time a single political party controls the Presidency and four or more Regional Governorships, the threshold for the ARB to certify a federal bill as "Non-Exclusive" shall automatically rise to a three-quarters (75%) vote of the Board.

(ff-4) **Party Alignment Determination.** For purposes of subsection (ff-3), the IFC shall determine party alignment based on:

- (1) formal party registration of the officeholder;
- (2) caucus affiliation in the case of legislators;
- (3) endorsement patterns and voting alignment for independents.
An officeholder who formally declares non-alignment with any party shall not be counted toward the unified control threshold.

### Section 7-A. Algorithmic Governance Transparency

(a) **Mandatory Algorithmic Transparency.** All algorithms, data models, formulas, and computational methods used by the Allocation Review Board, Independent Fiscal Council, Federal Data Coordination Agency, or any other Constitutional Oversight Body to make determinations affecting Regional rights, obligations, or resources shall be:

- (1) fully documented in plain language accessible to non-technical readers;
- (2) published in complete technical detail, including source code where applicable;
- (3) accompanied by explanations of all assumptions, weightings, and data inputs;
- (4) subject to public comment before initial adoption and before any material modification.

(b) **Open-Source Requirement.** All software, algorithms, and computational tools used for constitutional determinations shall be:

- (1) published as open-source code in publicly accessible repositories;
- (2) accompanied by complete documentation enabling independent replication;
- (3) version-controlled with full change history publicly available;
- (4) testable by any interested party using publicly available data.

(c) **Independent Algorithmic Audit.** Each Constitutional Oversight Body shall undergo annual algorithmic audit by an independent panel:

- (1) The panel shall be appointed by the National Academy of Sciences;
- (2) The audit shall assess accuracy, bias, and methodological soundness;
- (3) Audit findings shall be published within sixty (60) days of completion;
- (4) The audited body shall respond to findings within ninety (90) days.

(d) **Bias Testing Requirements.** Before any algorithm may be used for constitutional determinations:

- (1) it shall be tested for systematic bias against any Region, demographic group, or economic sector;
- (2) bias testing results shall be published;
- (3) algorithms showing statistically significant bias (p < 0.05) may not be used until corrected;
- (4) ongoing bias monitoring shall continue throughout the algorithm's use.

(e) **Data Input Transparency.** All data used as inputs to algorithmic determinations shall be:

- (1) publicly disclosed, with appropriate privacy protections for individual-level data;
- (2) sourced from publicly verifiable sources;
- (3) accompanied by metadata describing collection methodology, limitations, and potential biases;
- (4) subject to challenge by affected parties who may submit alternative data.

(f) **Methodological Challenge Right.** Any Region or affected party may challenge the methodology of an algorithmic determination:

- (1) challenges shall be heard by a Special Master appointed by the Chief Justice with relevant technical expertise;
- (2) the challenger may present expert testimony on methodological flaws;
- (3) the Constitutional Oversight Body bears the burden of demonstrating methodological soundness;
- (4) if the challenge is sustained, the determination shall be vacated pending methodological correction.

(g) **Factual Finding Limitation.** The principle that factual findings of Constitutional Oversight Bodies are "final" under Section 7 applies only to:

- (1) factual determinations based on disclosed data and transparent methodology;
- (2) findings that have survived methodological challenge or for which the challenge period has expired;
- (3) this principle does not immunize algorithmic methodology from review.

(h) **Anti-Black-Box Provision.** No Constitutional Oversight Body may:

- (1) use proprietary algorithms whose methodology cannot be publicly disclosed;
- (2) rely on machine learning models that cannot be explained in human-interpretable terms;
- (3) treat algorithmic outputs as conclusive without human review and approval;
- (4) refuse to explain the basis for any specific determination to affected parties.

(i) **Algorithmic Impact Statements.** Before adopting any new algorithm or materially modifying an existing algorithm, Constitutional Oversight Bodies shall publish an Algorithmic Impact Statement assessing:

- (1) potential differential impacts on various Regions;
- (2) sensitivity analysis showing how changes in inputs affect outputs;
- (3) comparison with alternative methodological approaches;
- (4) mechanisms for ongoing monitoring and correction.

(j) **Whistleblower Protection.** Employees of Constitutional Oversight Bodies who report algorithmic bias, methodological flaws, or data manipulation shall be protected under federal whistleblower statutes and may not be terminated, demoted, or subjected to adverse action for such reporting.

#### Technocratic Integrity and Anti-Capture Provisions

(k) **Revolving Door Restrictions.** To prevent the emergence of an insular technocratic class cycling between oversight bodies:

(k-1) **Cooling-Off Periods.** No individual may serve as a member, senior staff, or consultant to more than one Constitutional Oversight Body (including the ARB, IFC, FARB, ETRB, FDCA, and any successor bodies) within a five-year period. Specifically:

- (1) former members of any such body may not be appointed to another such body until five years after the end of their prior service;
- (2) former senior staff (defined as employees at GS-15 equivalent or above) may not be appointed as members or senior staff of another such body until three years after separation;
- (3) consultants who provided more than 500 hours of service to any such body within a three-year period are subject to the same restrictions as senior staff.

(k-2) **Prohibition on Double-Hatting.** No individual may simultaneously:

- (1) serve as a member of any Constitutional Oversight Body while serving as a member, employee, or consultant to any other such body;
- (2) serve on any Constitutional Oversight Body while employed by or consulting for any party with matters pending before that body or any related body;
- (3) provide expert testimony, advisory opinions, or consulting services to parties in disputes before any body on which they have served within the preceding five years.

(k-3) **Private Sector Restrictions.** Members and senior staff of Constitutional Oversight Bodies:

- (1) may not, for three years after separation, accept employment or consulting arrangements with any entity that was a party to a significant matter in which they personally participated;
- (2) may not, for two years after separation, lobby or advocate before the body on which they served;
- (3) must disclose, for five years after separation, any compensation received from entities subject to the jurisdiction of their former body.

(k-4) **Personnel Diversity Requirements.** To prevent homogeneous technocracy:

- (1) no more than two members of any Constitutional Oversight Body may have previously served together on any other such body;
- (2) no more than one-third of members may have prior employment with the same institution (university, think tank, consulting firm, or government agency);
- (3) appointing authorities shall consider geographic, institutional, and methodological diversity in making appointments.

(k-5) **Disclosure and Transparency.** All members and senior staff shall:

- (1) file annual financial disclosure statements including all sources of income, investments, and institutional affiliations;
- (2) publicly disclose all prior service on Constitutional Oversight Bodies, related advisory committees, and relevant private sector positions;
- (3) recuse themselves from matters involving former employers, clients, or co-panelists for three years after the relevant relationship ended.

(k-6) **Enforcement.** Violations of this section shall result in:

- (1) immediate removal from the current position;
- (2) permanent ineligibility for appointment to any Constitutional Oversight Body;

### Section 8. National Security Operations Override

(a) **Certification of National Security Necessity.** When Regional exclusive-domain regulations (including but not limited to labor standards, energy planning, environmental rules, or operational requirements) materially impede the operation of federal defense facilities, defense manufacturing, or critical national security infrastructure, the President may certify a "National Security Necessity."

(b) **Certification Requirements.** A National Security Necessity certification shall:

- (1) identify the specific federal defense operation or facility affected;
- (2) identify the specific Regional regulation creating the impediment;
- (3) demonstrate that the impediment is material (not merely inconvenient) to national defense;
- (4) be transmitted to Congress and the affected Regional Government within 48 hours.

(c) **Effect of Certification.** Upon certification:

- (1) the identified Regional regulation shall be suspended as applied to the identified federal operation for a period not exceeding one hundred eighty (180) days;
- (2) the federal government shall negotiate in good faith with the Regional Government for a permanent accommodation;
- (3) affected workers and communities shall receive federal mitigation assistance for any adverse impacts.

(d) **Congressional Review.** Congress may disapprove a National Security Necessity certification by joint resolution within sixty (60) days, which shall terminate the suspension.

(e) **Judicial Review.** Regional Governments may challenge certifications in federal court on grounds that:

- (1) the impediment is not material to national defense; or
- (2) the certification is pretextual (i.e., the true purpose is economic rather than security-related).

(f) **Anti-Abuse Limitation.** This override may not be used to:

- (1) exempt federal contractors from generally applicable workplace safety requirements;
- (2) circumvent Regional environmental protections except where directly incompatible with defense operations;
- (3) impose federal labor standards on non-defense Regional employers.

---

### Section 9. Emerging Technology Domain Assignment

(a) **Emerging Technology Defined.** An "Emerging Technology" is any technology, practice, or capability that:

- (1) does not fit clearly within existing enumerated Federal, Regional, or State domains;
- (2) poses potential systemic risks crossing jurisdictional boundaries; and
- (3) is not adequately regulated by any existing jurisdictional framework.

(b) **Emerging Technology Review Board.** There is hereby established an Emerging Technology Review Board (ETRB) consisting of:

- (1) three members appointed by the President with scientific or technical expertise;
- (2) two members appointed by the Regional Governors (collectively);
- (3) two members appointed by the National Academy of Sciences;
- (4) two members appointed by the Judicial Conference from among judges with technology law experience.

(c) **Petition for Domain Assignment.** Any federal agency, Regional Government, or State Government may petition the ETRB to assign jurisdiction over an Emerging Technology. Private parties with demonstrated interest may file amicus submissions.

(d) **Provisional Federal Jurisdiction.** Upon a finding that an Emerging Technology poses systemic risks that cannot be adequately managed at the Regional or State level, the ETRB may assign provisional federal jurisdiction for a period not exceeding five years.

(e) **Criteria for Federal Assignment.** Provisional federal jurisdiction is appropriate when:

- (1) the technology poses risks of catastrophic or irreversible harm;
- (2) regulatory arbitrage among Regions or States would create "race to the bottom" dynamics;
- (3) effective regulation requires uniform national standards;
- (4) the technology implicates national security or foreign policy concerns.

(f) **Provisional Regional Jurisdiction.** When an Emerging Technology primarily affects inter-state coordination within Regions but does not meet the criteria for federal assignment, the ETRB may assign provisional Regional jurisdiction.

(g) **Transition to Permanent Assignment.** Before provisional jurisdiction expires:

- (1) the ETRB shall recommend permanent domain assignment to Congress;
- (2) Congress shall codify the assignment by statute, which may include shared jurisdiction frameworks;
- (3) if Congress fails to act, provisional jurisdiction extends for two additional years, after which the technology defaults to State jurisdiction unless renewed.

(h) **Anti-Haven Provision.** No State or Region may offer "regulatory haven" status for Emerging Technologies under provisional federal jurisdiction:

- (1) attempts to attract Emerging Technology development through regulatory exemption are void;
- (2) federal enforcement authority extends to such technologies regardless of State or Regional non-cooperation;
- (3) jurisdictions that actively obstruct federal Emerging Technology regulation shall be ineligible for federal research and development funding for five years.

(i) **Sunset and Review.** Each provisional assignment shall include:

- (1) specific regulatory objectives to be achieved;
- (2) metrics for evaluating regulatory effectiveness;
- (3) mandatory review at the midpoint of the provisional period.

### Section 10. Vital Federal Operations Protection

(a) **Vital Federal Operations Defined.** In addition to national defense facilities protected under Section 8, the following constitute "Vital Federal Operations" entitled to protection from Regional regulatory interference:

- (1) Social Security Administration processing centers and data facilities;
- (2) Internal Revenue Service processing centers, data facilities, and regional offices;
- (3) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention facilities and laboratories;
- (4) Federal Emergency Management Agency regional headquarters and logistics centers;
- (5) Medicare and Medicaid Services processing facilities;
- (6) Federal court facilities and administrative offices;
- (7) United States Postal Service distribution centers;
- (8) Any other federal facility designated by Congress as "Vital" by statute.

(b) **Minimum Operating Guarantee.** Regions may not use exclusive-domain regulatory authority to:

- (1) deny, restrict, or condition utility services (water, electricity, natural gas, telecommunications) to Vital Federal Operations;
- (2) impose labor standards that would require reduction of operating hours or staffing below levels necessary for continuous operation;
- (3) apply zoning, permitting, or land-use restrictions that would require relocation or closure of existing Vital Federal Operations;
- (4) impose environmental or health regulations specifically targeting federal facilities without generally applicable justification.

(c) **Certification of Vital Operations Necessity.** When Regional regulations materially impede Vital Federal Operations, the head of the affected federal agency may certify a "Vital Operations Necessity":

- (1) The certification shall identify the specific regulation and specific operational impact;
- (2) The certification shall be transmitted to the Regional Government and Congress within 48 hours;
- (3) Upon certification, the identified regulation shall be suspended as applied to the federal facility for ninety (90) days pending negotiation.

(d) **Negotiated Accommodation.** During the suspension period:

- (1) The federal agency and Regional Government shall negotiate in good faith for permanent accommodation;
- (2) The federal government shall offer reasonable mitigation for Regional concerns (e.g., environmental offsets, community benefits);
- (3) If accommodation is reached, it shall be binding on both parties.

(e) **Arbitration for Unresolved Disputes.** If negotiation fails:

- (1) Either party may request binding arbitration before a three-member panel (one selected by each party, third selected by the Chief Justice);
- (2) The panel shall issue a decision within sixty (60) days balancing federal operational needs against Regional regulatory interests;
- (3) The panel may impose conditions on either party to achieve accommodation.

(f) **Anti-Hostage Provision.** A Region may not:

- (1) threaten or impose regulatory burdens on Vital Federal Operations as leverage in unrelated disputes;
- (2) coordinate with other Regions to simultaneously burden federal operations across multiple locations;
- (3) time regulatory actions to coincide with federal budget negotiations, elections, or other politically sensitive periods.

(g) **Emergency Federal Authority.** If a Region takes action that would cause imminent shutdown of a Vital Federal Operation:

- (1) The President may declare an emergency and assume temporary operational control of necessary Regional infrastructure (utilities, transportation);
- (2) Federal operation shall continue only so long as necessary to prevent shutdown;
- (3) The federal government shall compensate the Region for costs of federal operation.

(h) **Distinction from National Security Override.** This section provides protection for civilian administrative operations; Section 8 provides protection for defense operations. The standards and procedures differ because civilian operations do not implicate the same national security concerns, and Regional interests are given greater weight in balancing.

---

### Section 11. Merit System Protection

*Addresses Gap 233: Civil Service Purges ("Spoils System")*

(a) **Career Service Defined.** There shall exist a constitutionally protected Career Civil Service comprising all federal employees not specifically designated as political appointees by statute. No executive order, administrative action, or regulation shall reclassify Career Civil Service positions as political appointments.

(b) **Political Appointment Ceiling.** The total number of political appointees in the Executive Branch shall not exceed 4,000 positions, or 0.2% of total federal civilian employment, whichever is less. This ceiling may only be modified by Act of Congress. Political appointees shall be limited to agency heads, deputy heads, and positions requiring Senate confirmation.

(c) **Merit Principles.** Career Civil Service employees shall be:

- (1) Selected based solely on qualifications, demonstrated competence, and merit;
- (2) Protected from removal except for cause demonstrated through due process;
- (3) Free to provide professional advice without political interference;
- (4) Protected from retaliation for lawful whistleblowing or refusal to execute unlawful orders.

(d) **For-Cause Removal.** Career Civil Service employees may be removed only for documented misconduct, incapacity, or failure to perform job duties. Political disagreement, policy views, or failure to demonstrate personal loyalty shall not constitute cause. Removal decisions shall be reviewable by the Merit Systems Protection Board with de novo authority.

(e) **Anti-Circumvention.** The following actions are prohibited:

- (1) Creating new employment schedules or categories to evade this section;
- (2) Reassigning employees to compel resignation;
- (3) Eliminating positions to terminate protected employees;
- (4) Requiring loyalty oaths beyond the constitutional oath of office;
- (5) Using hiring freezes to force attrition of career staff.

(f) **Transition Protection.** During presidential transitions, Career Civil Service employees shall remain in their positions absent individual for-cause removal. Mass terminations, reassignments, or reclassifications during the 90 days before or after an inauguration shall be presumptively invalid.

(g) **Enforcement.** The Merit Systems Protection Board shall be an independent constitutional body with members serving staggered 7-year terms, removable only by impeachment. Employees wrongfully terminated shall be entitled to reinstatement with back pay, plus damages of 100 to 500 FPUs. Supervisors who knowingly violate this section shall be personally liable.

---

### Section 12. Transition Integrity

*Addresses Gap 234: Presidential Transition ("Scorched Earth")*

(a) **Transition Period Defined.** The "Transition Period" shall commence upon:

- (1) The certification of a presidential election in which the incumbent is not the winner; or

- (3) The President's term reaching its final 90 days.

(b) **Pardon Limitations.** During the Transition Period:

- (1) The President may not pardon any person who served in the administration, any family member within the third degree of consanguinity, any person under investigation for matters related to the President, or themselves;
- (2) All pardons shall require countersignature by the Attorney General or, if the Attorney General position is vacant, the Solicitor General;
- (3) Pardons issued in the final 30 days shall be subject to review and revocation by the incoming President within 60 days of inauguration.

(c) **Executive Actions Restricted.** During the Transition Period, the President may not:

- (1) Issue executive orders with prospective effect beyond the current term;
- (2) Promulgate regulations unless required by statutory deadline or genuine emergency;

- (4) Declassify information except upon written request specifying national security need;
- (5) Remove inspectors general, the FBI Director, or special counsels;
- (6) Fill vacancies in positions with terms extending beyond the current term, except acting appointments.

(g) **Enforcement.** Actions taken in violation of this section shall be void ab initio. The incoming President shall have standing to seek judicial declaration of invalidity. Officials who facilitate violations shall be subject to criminal penalties of 50 to 500 FPUs and permanent disqualification from federal service.

---

### Section 13. Faithful Execution Mandate

*Addresses Gap 248: Prosecutorial Nullification ("Pocket Veto of Enforcement")*

(a) **Mandatory Duty.** The Executive "shall take care that the Laws be faithfully executed" is a mandatory constitutional duty, not a discretionary power. Systematic refusal to enforce a duly enacted statute constitutes a breach of this duty.

(b) **Categorical Non-Enforcement Prohibited.** The Executive may not:

- (i) categorically decline to enforce an entire statutory scheme;
- (ii) issue guidance, memoranda, or policies directing non-enforcement of statutory categories;
- (iii) interpret statutes so as to render major provisions unenforceable;
- (iv) settle enforcement actions on terms that effectively immunize future violations.

(c) **Case-by-Case Discretion Preserved.** Nothing in this section eliminates:

- (i) prosecutorial discretion in individual cases based on specific facts;
- (ii) reasonable prioritization among equally meritorious cases;
- (iii) resource allocation decisions that do not amount to categorical abandonment;
- (iv) decisions not to prosecute based on evidentiary insufficiency in particular matters.

(d) **Distinction Standard.** Non-enforcement becomes unconstitutional categorical abandonment when:

- (i) an entire class of violations is exempted from enforcement;
- (ii) enforcement is conditioned on criteria not found in the statute;
- (iii) the practical effect is that the statutory prohibition becomes unenforceable;
- (iv) a reasonable observer would conclude the Executive has nullified the statute.

(e) **Compelled Enforcement (Mandamus).**

- (i) Upon a finding of categorical non-enforcement, courts shall issue writs of mandamus compelling the Executive to enforce the statute.
- (ii) Mandamus under this section is not discretionary; it shall issue upon finding of violation.
- (iii) Courts may specify minimum enforcement levels, reporting requirements, and compliance timelines.
- (iv) Standing to seek mandamus under this section is granted to: any member of Congress; any State or Region; any person with a concrete interest in enforcement of the statute.

(f) **Congressional Enforcement Trigger.**

- (i) If either house of Congress passes a resolution by majority vote finding categorical non-enforcement of a specific statute, the resolution shall trigger expedited judicial review.
- (ii) Upon such resolution, the burden shifts to the Executive to demonstrate that enforcement is occurring at levels consistent with faithful execution.
- (iii) The reviewing court shall rule within sixty (60) days.

(g) **Reporting Requirements.**

- (i) Each agency shall report annually to Congress on enforcement levels for each major statutory scheme under its jurisdiction.
- (ii) Reports shall include: number of violations detected, investigations opened, enforcement actions initiated, penalties imposed, and comparison to prior years.
- (iii) Significant declines in enforcement levels without corresponding statutory change shall trigger explanatory hearings.

(h) **Impeachment Standard.** Systematic, intentional refusal to enforce duly enacted law, when continued after judicial mandamus, constitutes a "high Crime or Misdemeanor" for purposes of impeachment.

(i) **Regional Application.** This section applies equally to Regional Governors with respect to Regional legislation, with mandamus available in Regional courts and enforcement trigger available to Regional legislatures.

---

### Section 14. Executive Privilege Reform

(d) **Time-Bound Resolution.**

- (i) The Special Privilege Panel shall rule on any privilege dispute within thirty (30) days of submission.
- (ii) If the Panel fails to rule within thirty (30) days, the privilege claim is deemed denied.
- (iii) No extension of time may be granted except by unanimous consent of all parties.

(e) **Burden of Proof.**

- (i) The burden of establishing that executive privilege applies rests on the Executive.
- (ii) In cases involving allegations of misconduct by the President or senior officials, there is a presumption against privilege.
- (iii) The presumption may be overcome only by specific showing that disclosure would cause concrete harm to national security or foreign relations.

(f) **In Camera Review.**

- (i) The Special Privilege Panel shall review contested documents in camera (privately) to determine applicability of privilege.
- (ii) The Panel may disclose to Congress or courts any documents found not privileged.
- (iii) Documents found privileged shall remain confidential unless the crime-fraud exception applies.

(g) **No Blanket Claims.**

- (i) Privilege must be asserted document-by-document with specific justification.
- (ii) Blanket assertions of privilege over categories of documents are void.
- (iii) Failure to provide specific justification within fourteen (14) days of subpoena constitutes waiver.

(h) **Contempt and Enforcement.**

- (i) Refusal to comply with a Panel determination is contempt of the Constitution.
- (ii) Officials who refuse compliance may be fined, imprisoned, or removed from office.
- (iii) The Sergeant-at-Arms of either chamber may enforce compliance by arrest.

(i) **Preservation Requirement.**

- (i) All presidential communications shall be preserved pursuant to the Presidential Records Act.
- (ii) Destruction of records subject to a subpoena or privilege dispute is a felony.
- (iii) Obstruction of privilege proceedings is grounds for impeachment.

(j) **Coordination with Section 18.** Executive privilege under this section does not apply to final legal interpretations as defined in Section 18(h)(ii). Pre-decisional legal advice remains subject to this section.

---

### Section 15. Fiduciary Duty of Candor

*Addresses Gap 252: Government Lies Without Consequence ("The Official Lie")*

(a) **Duty of Truth.** All public officers of the United States, the Regions, and the States hold a fiduciary duty of candor to the citizens. In their official capacity, they shall not knowingly make false statements on matters of material public importance.

- (iii) the statement involved a matter of opinion, interpretation, or prediction clearly identified as such;
- (iv) disclosure of the truth would have caused specific, identifiable harm to national security, and the official disclosed the truth as soon as the security concern abated.

(f) **Consequences.**

- (i) **Impeachment**: Knowing dissemination of material falsehoods is a "high Crime or Misdemeanor" for purposes of impeachment.
- (ii) **Criminal Penalty**: A covered official who violates this section is guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment of one (1) to five (5) years and a fine of 100 to 500 FPUs.
- (iii) **Disqualification**: Upon conviction, the official is permanently disqualified from holding any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States or any Region.

### Section 17. National Necessity Easement

*Addresses Gap 265: Strategic Land Use ("The NIMBY Blockade")*

(a) **Superior Eminent Domain.** The Federal Government possesses a superior right of Eminent Domain over Regional, State, and local land use authority for facilities and infrastructure certified as essential under this section.

(b) **Certification Categories.** Congress may certify a project as a "National Necessity" if it is:

### Section 18. Prohibition on Secret Law

*Addresses Gap 221: Secret Legal Interpretations ("The Dark State")*

(a) **Public Law Requirement.** No law, regulation, judicial opinion, executive order, or legal interpretation having the force of law may be classified or otherwise kept secret from the public. For purposes of this section:

- (i) "Legal interpretation having the force of law" means any written or oral determination regarding the scope, meaning, applicability, or constitutionality of a statute, regulation, constitutional provision, or government authority, that is relied upon, cited, or treated as authoritative by any government entity in the course of official action, regardless of its form, label, or originating office;
- (ii) The authority for any government action must be stated in publicly available law;
- (iii) No government entity may refuse to confirm or deny the existence of a legal interpretation concerning the scope or authority of government action; the existence of legal authority is not classifiable;
- (iv) A legal interpretation that remains unpublished beyond the deadline established in subsection (c) is void and may not be relied upon to authorize, justify, or defend any government action;
- (v) This section applies to the United States, each Region, each State, and all subdivisions thereof.

(b) **Law and Operations Distinguished.** This section distinguishes between:

- (i) **Legal authority** (which must be public): the legal reasoning, interpretation, and conclusion justifying or authorizing government action, including the statutory or constitutional basis, the scope of authority claimed, and the legal conclusion reached;
- (ii) **Operational details** (which may be classified): sources, methods, targets, identities of agents, and specific operational parameters of implementation.

Classification of operational details does not authorize classification of legal authority. At minimum, the legal question addressed, the conclusion reached, and the statutory or constitutional authority relied upon must remain unredacted in any published version.

(c) **Memorialization and Publication.**

- (i) Any legal guidance, whether written or oral, that is relied upon by any government entity as authority for government action shall be reduced to writing within thirty (30) days of first reliance. Guidance not so memorialized may not be relied upon, and any action taken under unwritten legal authority is ultra vires;
- (ii) Any executive component, office, or official issuing legal opinions, interpretations, or guidance having the force of law shall publish such interpretations within one hundred eighty (180) days of issuance;
- (iii) Publication may redact operational details as defined in subsection (b), but shall not redact legal reasoning, the legal question addressed, or the conclusion reached;
- (iv) Each published interpretation shall include a public summary stating the legal question and the conclusion;
- (v) No government entity may rely upon a legal interpretation that has not been published in accordance with this section;
- (vi) During the period between issuance and the publication deadline, an interpretation is operative but must be disclosed to Congress and to any court reviewing government action conducted under its authority, upon request.

(d) **Surveillance Court Transparency.** Any court, tribunal, or judicial body issuing ex parte orders under surveillance authority:

- (i) shall publish all opinions interpreting the scope or constitutionality of surveillance authorities, redacted for operational details as defined in subsection (b);
- (ii) shall be subject to review by courts of general jurisdiction upon constitutional challenge by any party with standing under this Constitution;
- (iii) shall permit amicus curiae participation in cases raising novel questions of law or constitutional interpretation;
- (iv) may not issue opinions interpreting constitutional rights or the scope of government authority that are permanently withheld from the public.

(e) **Congressional Access.** No classification, privilege, or executive determination may prevent:

- (i) any member of Congress from accessing legal interpretations relevant to their constitutional oversight duties;
- (ii) congressional committees from receiving complete legal justifications for executive programs within their jurisdiction;
- (iii) congressional staff holding appropriate security clearances from reviewing classified legal material under the direction of the member or committee they serve.

(f) **Judicial Review.** Courts reviewing any government action:

- (i) shall have access to all legal interpretations upon which the government relies to justify the action;
- (ii) may review such interpretations in camera where necessary to protect operational details;
- (iii) shall not defer to executive branch classification of legal reasoning;
- (iv) may order publication of any legal interpretation upon which the government relies in the proceeding.

(g) **Whistleblower Coordination.** The disclosure of a legal interpretation that is required to be public under this section but has not been published:

- (i) shall constitute a disclosure in the public interest under Article I, Section 23, and the protections of that section shall apply in full;
- (ii) shall trigger a mandatory declassification review of the interpretation, to be completed within ninety (90) days;
- (iii) shall not be prosecuted under any espionage, classified information, or secrecy statute if the disclosure is limited to legal reasoning and does not include operational details as defined in subsection (b).

(h) **Executive Privilege Coordination.**

- (i) Pre-decisional legal advice — including draft opinions, internal deliberation, and attorney-client communications between government lawyers and officials regarding legal options not yet adopted — remains subject to executive privilege under Section 14 of this Article;
- (ii) A final legal interpretation — defined as one that has been adopted, issued, or relied upon by any government entity as authority for action — may not be withheld from Congress, courts, or the public under executive privilege;
- (iii) Upon expiration of the one-hundred-eighty-day publication period in subsection (c), executive privilege may not be asserted as a basis to prevent publication of any legal interpretation subject to this section.

(i) **Sunset Backstop.** Any legal interpretation that has not been published within five (5) years of issuance:

- (i) expires and may not be relied upon to authorize, justify, or defend any government action;
- (ii) any program or activity conducted under the expired interpretation must be reauthorized under published legal authority or terminated;
- (iii) all such interpretations shall be reviewed for possible declassification at least every two (2) years.

(j) **Implementing Legislation.** Congress shall, by law:

- (i) designate or establish the office or offices responsible for redaction and publication of legal interpretations under this section;
- (ii) establish procedures for memorializing oral guidance under subsection (c)(i);
- (iii) establish publication standards, including format, searchability, and public accessibility requirements;
- (iv) designate the specific bodies within the surveillance court system subject to subsection (d).

### Section 19. Treaty and International Agreement Withdrawal

*Resolves Gap 228 — The "Treaty Toggle" (Foreign Policy Whiplash). Establishes procedural requirements for withdrawal from treaties and international agreements, closing the constitutional asymmetry whereby the President can unilaterally undo commitments that required a Senate supermajority to enter. Together with Section 12(c) (Transition Integrity), this section ensures that international commitments reflect democratic consent for both entry and exit.*

(a) **Definitions.** For purposes of this section:

- (1) "Treaty" means any international agreement submitted to and ratified by the Senate under the Treaty Clause;
- (2) "Congressional-executive agreement" means any international agreement approved by majority vote of both chambers of Congress;
- (3) "Sole executive agreement" means any international agreement entered into by the President without congressional approval;
- (4) "Withdrawal" means denunciation, termination, suspension of all obligations, or any action that has the legal effect of ending participation in a treaty or international agreement;
- (5) "Material modification" means the addition, removal, or alteration of a reservation, understanding, or interpretive declaration that substantially changes the scope of obligations under the agreement.

(b) **Senate Consent for Treaty Withdrawal.** The President may withdraw the United States from a treaty ratified by the Senate only with the advice and consent of the Senate, by a majority vote of the members present and voting.

(c) **Expedited Consideration.**

- (1) Upon presidential submission of a withdrawal request, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee shall report the request to the floor within sixty (60) days;
- (2) The full Senate shall vote within thirty (30) days of committee report;
- (3) If the Senate fails to vote within ninety (90) days of submission, the request is deemed denied;
- (4) The withdrawal request shall be accompanied by a published justification stating the grounds for withdrawal and an assessment of economic, national security, and diplomatic consequences, including impacts on Regions whose economies are materially affected.

(d) **Three-Tier Agreement Framework.**

- (1) *Treaties.* Entry requires two-thirds of the Senate; withdrawal requires a majority of the Senate under subsection (b);
- (2) *Congressional-executive agreements.* Withdrawal requires the same approval as entry: majority vote of both chambers, or statutory repeal by the same process;
- (3) *Sole executive agreements.* The President may terminate sole executive agreements unilaterally, subject to the following limitations:
    - (i) No sole executive agreement may have a duration exceeding four (4) years;
    - (ii) Renewal, extension, or replacement of a sole executive agreement counts as a new agreement for purposes of the four-year limit;
    - (iii) Any sole executive agreement that the President intends to continue beyond four years must be submitted to the Senate as a treaty or approved by majority vote of both chambers as a congressional-executive agreement;
    - (iv) Congress may, by law, require Senate consent for termination of specified sole executive agreements before their expiration.
- (4) *Classification by function.* The substance of an international agreement, not its label, determines its classification under this section. An agreement that would require Senate ratification under the Treaty Clause may not be denominated a "sole executive agreement" or "political commitment" to avoid the requirements of this section.

(e) **Emergency Suspension.**

- (1) In cases of material breach by treaty partners, imminent threat to national security, or fundamental change of circumstances as recognized under international law, the President may suspend treaty obligations for up to one hundred eighty (180) days;
- (2) Suspension requires written certification to Congress specifying the factual grounds;
- (3) If the Senate does not approve withdrawal within one hundred eighty (180) days of suspension, obligations resume automatically;
- (4) *Single suspension limit.* The President may invoke emergency suspension only once per treaty per presidential term. Any further suspension of the same treaty requires Senate authorization by majority vote;
- (5) Emergency suspension is judicially reviewable for factual basis; courts may order immediate reinstatement of obligations upon finding that the certification lacked substantial evidence.

(f) **Transition Period Freeze.** During the Transition Period as defined in Section 12(a):

- (1) The prohibition in Section 12(c)(3) applies absolutely: the President may not initiate, execute, or finalize withdrawal from any treaty or international agreement;
- (2) All notice periods, Senate consideration deadlines, and suspension clocks under this section are tolled during the Transition Period;
- (3) No emergency suspension may be initiated during the Transition Period;
- (4) Any withdrawal notice submitted to treaty partners during the Transition Period is void.

(g) **Notification Requirements.**

- (1) The President shall notify Congress and treaty partners at least one hundred eighty (180) days before any intended withdrawal takes effect;
- (2) The notice period under subsection (g)(1) is tolled during any Transition Period under subsection (f)(2).

(h) **Reservations and Interpretive Declarations.** A material modification of a treaty — including the addition, removal, or alteration of any reservation, understanding, or interpretive declaration that substantially narrows the obligations of the United States — requires the advice and consent of the Senate by a majority vote. Technical clarifications that do not alter the scope of obligations do not require consent.

(i) **Implementation Legislation.**

- (1) If Congress repeals the domestic implementing legislation for a treaty, domestic law changes immediately upon the effective date of the repeal;
- (2) Following such repeal, the President shall submit a withdrawal request to the Senate within ninety (90) days;
- (3) Until withdrawal is completed under this section, the United States remains bound under international law; non-compliance during this period shall not constitute grounds for any adverse domestic legal consequence against private parties.

(j) **War Powers Coordination.** During any period of treaty suspension under subsection (e), the authority to deploy armed forces under the treaty obligation exception in Article XI, Section 2(b)(3) is suspended with respect to that treaty. Resumption of treaty obligations automatically restores the exception.

(k) **Indigenous Treaty Exemption.** This section does not apply to treaties between the United States and Indigenous Nations, which are governed exclusively by Article XXIII (Indigenous Sovereignty Preservation) and may not be withdrawn, terminated, or materially modified without the free, prior, and informed consent of the affected Indigenous Nation or Nations.

(l) **Single-Subject Requirement.** A Senate resolution consenting to treaty withdrawal may address only that withdrawal and may not include unrelated conditions, policy riders, or appropriations.

(m) **Judicial Review.** Federal courts shall have jurisdiction to review whether withdrawal procedures under this section have been followed. Courts shall not question the policy wisdom of withdrawal, only procedural compliance.

(n) **Retroactive Application.** This section applies to all treaties and international agreements in force at the time of adoption, regardless of when ratified. Any withdrawal process commenced before adoption that has not been completed must comply with this section before taking effect.

(o) **Implementing Legislation.** Congress shall, by law:

- (1) establish procedures for expedited Senate consideration of withdrawal requests;
- (2) define standards for classification of agreements under subsection (d)(4);
- (3) establish the format and content requirements for withdrawal justifications under subsection (c)(4);
- (4) define "material modification" for purposes of subsection (h);
- (5) establish procedures for treaty-implementation-repeal reconciliation under subsection (i).

### Section 20. Presidential Fitness and Incapacity

*Resolves Gap 229 — The "Mad King" (The Incapacity Crisis). Replaces the 25th Amendment's Cabinet-dependent incapacity mechanism with an independent medical determination process, addressing the structural conflict of interest whereby the officials best positioned to observe presidential incapacity are those with the most to lose by acting on it.*

(a) **Definitions.** For purposes of this section:

- (1) "Incapacity" means a functional inability to discharge the powers and duties of the office of President, whether arising from physical illness, cognitive impairment, mental health crisis, or any other cause. Incapacity is determined by observable functional capacity, not by diagnosis alone.
- (2) "Acting President" means the Vice President exercising the powers and duties (but not the title or office) of the President under this section.
- (3) "Panel" means the Presidential Medical Fitness Panel established by subsection (b).

(b) **Presidential Medical Fitness Panel.**

- (1) There is hereby established a Presidential Medical Fitness Panel of seven members, appointed as follows:
    - (i) Three physicians appointed by the National Academy of Medicine, each board-certified in internal medicine, neurology, or psychiatry;

(c) **Vacancy and Quorum.**

- (1) If the Senate fails to confirm a Panel member within ninety (90) days of a vacancy, the Chief Justice of the United States shall make a temporary appointment to serve until the Senate acts.
- (2) Five members constitute a quorum. The Panel may not issue a fitness determination under subsection (f) without a quorum.
- (3) If vacancies reduce Panel membership below five, the Chief Justice shall make sufficient temporary appointments within fourteen (14) days to restore a quorum.

(d) **Mandatory Annual Examination.**

- (1) The President shall submit to a comprehensive medical examination by the Panel annually, including physical, neurological, and cognitive assessments.
- (2) The Panel shall publish a fitness summary within thirty (30) days of the examination, stating whether the President is fit to discharge the powers and duties of the office. The summary shall address functional capacity without disclosing specific diagnoses, treatments, or medical records beyond what is necessary to support the finding.
- (3) If the President refuses or fails to submit to the annual examination within sixty (60) days of the scheduled date, the Panel shall automatically initiate an emergency fitness inquiry under subsection (e).

(e) **Emergency Fitness Inquiry.** An emergency fitness inquiry may be initiated by any of the following:

- (1) The Vice President and a majority of the principal officers of the executive departments, acting jointly;
- (2) A vote of two-thirds of the members of both the Senate and the House of Representatives;
- (3) Five of the seven Regional Governors;
- (4) A vote of five of the seven Panel members.

Upon initiation, the Panel shall commence an emergency fitness evaluation and issue a determination under subsection (f) within seven (7) days.

(f) **Fitness Determination.**

- (1) If the Panel determines, by a vote of at least four of seven members, that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of the office, the Panel shall transmit a written declaration to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives.
- (2) Upon transmission, the powers and duties of the office (but not the title) immediately transfer to the Vice President, who shall serve as Acting President.
- (3) The written declaration shall state the functional basis for the determination without disclosing specific diagnoses except as necessary to establish the basis for the finding.

(g) **Nuclear and Military Authority.**

- (1) Upon transmission of a declaration under subsection (f), sole authority to authorize the use of nuclear weapons and the authority of Commander-in-Chief under Article XI, Section 2(g) transfers immediately to the Acting President.
- (2) No ambiguity in the challenge or congressional review process under subsections (h) or (i) shall delay or divide the transfer of nuclear and military command authority.

(h) **Presidential Challenge.**

- (1) The President may challenge the Panel's determination by transmitting a written declaration to the President pro tempore of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives within fourteen (14) days of the Panel's declaration.
- (2) Upon receiving the President's challenge, the Panel shall reexamine the President and issue a reaffirmation or reversal within seven (7) days.
- (3) Reaffirmation requires a vote of at least five of seven Panel members. If the Panel does not reaffirm by the required supermajority, the President's powers and duties are restored.
- (4) During the challenge period, the Vice President continues to serve as Acting President.

(i) **Congressional Action.**

- (1) If the Panel reaffirms the determination of incapacity under subsection (h)(3), Congress shall assemble within forty-eight (48) hours and decide the issue within twenty-one (21) days.
- (2) Congress may sustain the removal of powers by a vote of two-thirds of both the Senate and the House of Representatives. If Congress does not vote within twenty-one days, or if the vote fails to reach two-thirds in both chambers, the President's powers and duties are restored.
- (3) Congress may not declare the President incapacitated contrary to a Panel finding of fitness. The congressional role under this subsection is limited to sustaining or declining to sustain a Panel determination of incapacity.

(j) **Acting President Restrictions.** During any period in which the Vice President serves as Acting President under this section:

- (1) The Acting President shall not grant a pardon, reprieve, or commutation of sentence to the President whose powers have been transferred;
- (2) The Acting President shall not remove, suspend, or reassign any member of the Panel;
- (3) The Acting President shall not remove, reassign, or restrict the access of the President's personal medical staff or the White House Medical Unit;
- (4) The Acting President shall not nominate a new Vice President under the Twenty-fifth Amendment, Section 2, unless the Vice Presidency is independently vacant.

(k) **Temporary and Permanent Incapacity.**

- (1) *Temporary incapacity.* If the Panel determines that the President's incapacity is temporary in nature, the Panel shall conduct follow-up evaluations at intervals not exceeding fourteen (14) days. Upon a majority vote finding that the President has recovered functional capacity, the President's powers and duties are immediately restored.
- (2) *Permanent incapacity.* If the President remains under an incapacity determination for more than sixty (60) consecutive days, the Panel shall conduct a comprehensive reassessment. If the Panel reaffirms incapacity by a vote of at least five of seven members, the determination is reclassified as permanent. A permanent determination may be reversed only by a subsequent Panel vote of at least five of seven members finding functional recovery.

(l) **Concealment of Incapacity.**

- (1) Any person subject to the Fiduciary Duty of Candor under Section 15 of this Article who has actual knowledge of facts constituting presidential incapacity under subsection (a)(1) and fails to disclose those facts to the Panel, the Vice President, or the congressional leadership within a reasonable time violates that duty.
- (2) Deliberate concealment of presidential incapacity by the President, Vice President, or any principal officer of an executive department constitutes an independent ground for impeachment under Article VIII.
- (3) Congress shall establish criminal penalties for willful concealment of presidential incapacity by officers and employees of the executive branch.

(m) **Panel Safeguards.**

- (1) The Panel shall receive an independent appropriation sufficient to perform its duties, which shall not be subject to executive impoundment or reduction.
- (2) The Panel shall have authority to issue subpoenas for medical records, testimony, and evidence relevant to a fitness inquiry.
- (3) The Panel shall have unrestricted access to the President's medical records, attending physicians, and medical staff for purposes of annual examinations and emergency fitness inquiries.
- (4) Any member of the presidential medical staff, the White House Medical Unit, or the executive branch who reports concerns about presidential fitness to the Panel in good faith shall be protected from retaliation. Retaliatory action against such a person constitutes an impeachable offense and a criminal violation.

(n) **Transition Period.**

- (1) If an incapacity determination occurs during the Transition Period as defined in Section 12 of this Article, all timelines under this section are reduced by half, rounded up to the nearest whole day.
- (2) If the President-elect is determined to be incapacitated before assuming office, the Vice President-elect shall serve as Acting President upon inauguration, and the Panel shall conduct a fitness evaluation within seven (7) days thereafter.

(o) **Judicial Review.** Federal courts shall have jurisdiction to review whether the procedures prescribed by this section have been followed. Courts shall not review the Panel's medical judgments, the sufficiency of the medical evidence, or the policy wisdom of any determination. Remedies shall be limited to procedural compliance.

(p) **Implementing Legislation.** Congress shall, by law:

- (1) establish the administrative structure, compensation, and support staff of the Panel;
- (2) define the standards and scope of the annual medical examination under subsection (d);
- (3) establish procedures for Panel vacancies, temporary appointments, and confirmation;
- (4) define criminal penalties for concealment under subsection (l)(3);

### Section 21. Federal Civic Baseline

*Resolves Gap 201 — The "Seditious Curriculum" (Indoctrination Trap). Establishes a narrow federal minimum for civic education within the otherwise Exclusive Regional Domain of K-12 education, protecting the constitutional order against generational ideological erosion while preserving Regional authority over all other educational content.*

(a) **Constitutional Exception.** Notwithstanding the classification of K-12 education curriculum and standards as an Exclusive Regional Domain under Section 1(e)(2)(i), the federal government shall establish and enforce the minimum civic education requirements specified in this Section. This exception is narrowly limited to the preservation of constitutional literacy and fidelity; all other aspects of K-12 education remain exclusively Regional.

(b) **Civic Education Requirement.** All educational institutions satisfying compulsory education requirements or issuing diplomas recognized by any level of government shall include in their curricula instruction in:

- (1) the text and history of the United States Constitution, including all amendments;
- (2) the text and structure of this Constitution, including the Regional Federalism framework;
- (3) the principles of constitutional democracy, including federalism, separation of powers, and individual rights;
- (4) the history of the United States as a continuous political community;
- (5) the rights and responsibilities of citizenship, including mechanisms for peaceful constitutional change through amendment, legislation, and judicial interpretation;
- (6) the structure and function of elections at all levels of government.

The scope of the Civic Baseline is limited to constitutional structure, rights, elections, federalism, and the rule of law. No content beyond these subjects may be mandated under this Section.

(c) **Prohibited Curricula.** No educational institution satisfying compulsory education requirements or issuing recognized diplomas may include in its required curriculum material that advocates or incites:

- (1) the violent overthrow of the United States government or any Regional government;
- (2) the unconstitutional secession of any Region or State from the United States;
- (3) the nullification of federal constitutional authority through non-legal means.

(d) **Academic Safe Harbor.** The prohibitions in subsection (c) do not extend to:

- (1) objective historical study of secessionist movements, civil wars, constitutional crises, or failed states;
- (2) critical analysis of constitutional provisions or proposals for constitutional amendment through lawful processes;
- (3) comparative study of other nations' political systems, including those that permit secession;
- (4) scholarly discussion of legal theories, including historical arguments regarding the constitutionality of secession;
- (5) student expression of personal political views in assignments, discussions, or extracurricular activities.

(e) **No Compelled Affirmation.** Nothing in this Section shall be construed to require any student, teacher, or institution to:

- (1) affirm or pledge allegiance to any political position, party, officeholder, or ideology;
- (2) express agreement with any provision of this Constitution as a condition of enrollment, graduation, employment, or accreditation;
- (3) refrain from advocacy for constitutional amendment through lawful processes.

This Section mandates knowledge, not belief.

(f) **National Civic Education Commission.**

(1) *Establishment.* There is hereby established a National Civic Education Commission consisting of nine (9) members serving staggered six-year terms, removable only for cause:

- (i) three (3) appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate; if the Senate fails to act within ninety (90) days of nomination, the nominee is deemed confirmed;
- (ii) two (2) appointed by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court from among persons with demonstrated expertise in constitutional law, history, or civic education;

- (ii) access free federal remediation materials and instruction provided by the Commission;
- (iii) achieve eligibility at any age; no person is permanently disqualified by failure of the Assessment.

(4) *Assessment Standards.* The Assessment shall test factual knowledge and structural understanding only. It may not test political opinions, ideological agreement, or policy preferences.

Reasonable accommodations shall be provided for persons with documented disabilities affecting language processing. Remediation materials under paragraph (3)(ii) shall include English literacy instruction.

(h) **Enforcement.**

(1) *Public Schools.* Upon a finding by the Commission that a Region's public education system fails to implement the Civic Baseline:

- (i) the Commission shall issue notice of non-compliance with specific remedial requirements and offer technical assistance;
- (ii) continued non-compliance after one (1) year triggers conditional withholding of federal education funding, with funds restored upon compliance;
- (iii) persistent non-compliance after three (3) years triggers targeted federal delivery of Civic Baseline instruction within the Region, limited to Baseline content and funded by reallocation from the Region's withheld federal education allocation;
- (iv) targeted federal delivery is time-limited to five (5) years, after which the Commission shall report to Congress on whether compliance has been achieved or whether additional legislative measures are required.

(2) *Prohibited Content.* Upon a finding that an educational institution's required curriculum includes material prohibited by subsection (c):

- (i) the Commission shall issue notice with specific findings and remedial requirements;
- (ii) if the institution receives public funding and fails to cure within one hundred eighty (180) days, all public funding shall be suspended until the prohibited content is removed;
- (iii) officials who knowingly direct the inclusion of prohibited content after notice are subject to civil liability under the enforcement provisions of Article XIV.

(i) **Update Safeguards.**

- (1) Amendments to the Civic Baseline curriculum standards require approval by two-thirds of the Commission and certification by the Allocation Review Board that the amendments remain within the scope defined in subsection (b).
- (2) The Civic Baseline may not be reduced below the minimum requirements enumerated in subsection (b); only additions within that scope are permitted.
- (3) The Commission shall review the Baseline decennially and publish its findings. Any proposed changes shall be subject to a one-hundred-eighty-day public comment period before adoption.

(j) **Regional Implementation Authority.** Subject to the minimum requirements of this Section, Regions retain authority over:

- (1) all educational content not covered by the Civic Baseline;
- (2) educational methods, assessment formats, teacher certification, and institutional governance;
- (3) curriculum in history, social studies, and civics beyond the Baseline;
- (4) supplementary civic content consistent with subsection (c).

This Section establishes a narrow constitutional floor, not federal control of education.

---

## ARTICLE III - RIGHTS FLOORS AND SUBSIDIARITY

### Section 1. Floors, Not Ceilings

Federal rights and standards establish minimum protections only.

No federal law shall be interpreted to prohibit a Region or State from exceeding such protections unless explicitly stated.

---

### Section 2. Subsidiarity with Enforcement

Authority resides at the lowest level capable of exercising it effectively, subject to judicial enforcement of constitutional boundaries.

---

### Section 3. Hierarchy of Law

(a) This Constitution is the supreme law of the United States.

(b) Within their respective spheres:

- Federal law enacted pursuant to enumerated federal powers is supreme over conflicting Regional, State, or local law.
- Regional law enacted pursuant to enumerated Regional powers is supreme over conflicting State or local law within the Region.
- State law is supreme over conflicting local law within the State.

(c) State Constitutions.

(1) State constitutions may not conflict with this Constitution or with the Regional constitution of the Region in which the State is located.

(2) State constitutions may establish protections exceeding those in the Regional or federal constitutions (floors, not ceilings).

(3) In case of conflict between a State constitution and a Regional constitution:

- the Regional constitution prevails on matters within enumerated Regional powers,
- the State constitution prevails on matters within reserved State powers,
- disputes shall be resolved by the Allocation Review Board, with appeal to the Supreme Court.

(d) Local Charters. Local government charters and ordinances are subordinate to State law and may not conflict with State, Regional, or federal law.

(e) Pre-Ratification State Law. State law in effect at ratification continues in force unless:

- inconsistent with this Constitution,
- superseded by Regional law on matters transferred to Regional authority,

### Section 4. The Unwaivable Core

*Addresses Gap 217: Terms of Service Trap (Contractual Feudalism)*

(a) **Inalienable Rights.** The following rights may not be waived, surrendered, or contracted away by any person, and any purported waiver is void:

(1) the right to access a judicial tribunal for claims alleging violation of rights under this Constitution, including access unimpeded by forum selection clauses requiring litigation in jurisdictions having no reasonable connection to the dispute or the parties — a jurisdiction has "reasonable connection" only if it is the residence of a party, the place of contract formation or performance, or the principal place of business of a party;

(2) the right to trial by jury for disputes exceeding five thousand (5,000) Federal Penalty Units;

(3) the right to petition the government for redress of grievances;

(4) the right to associate or not associate for political purposes;

(5) the right to be free from unreasonable searches by entities acting under color of law or under contract with government;

(6) the right to speak on matters of public concern, to report unlawful conduct to government authorities, and to participate in legal proceedings without contractual restraint;

(7) any right whose waiver would render the person unable to vindicate protections under this Constitution.

The privilege to contract conferred by Article I, Section 18(c)(1) does not authorize contracts that waive rights protected by this section.

(b) **Forced Arbitration of Protected Claims Prohibited.** No pre-dispute agreement may require arbitration of:

(1) claims alleging violation of rights under this Constitution;

(2) claims alleging civil rights violations under federal or Regional law, including but not limited to employment discrimination, retaliation, workplace safety, and wage-and-hour claims;

(3) claims for injunctive relief affecting constitutional interests;

(4) class actions where individual claims are below one thousand (1,000) Federal Penalty Units.

The determination of whether a claim falls within this subsection shall be made by a court, not an arbitrator. Post-dispute arbitration agreements are enforceable only if entered into knowingly and voluntarily, with the claimant informed in writing of the right to judicial resolution.

(c) **Unconscionability and Severability.** A contract term waiving rights protected by subsection (a) or requiring arbitration prohibited by subsection (b) is presumptively unconscionable, unenforceable as against public policy, and severable — leaving the remainder of the contract intact.

(d) **Class Action Preservation.** Waivers of class action participation are unenforceable where:

(1) individual claims are below one thousand (1,000) Federal Penalty Units;

(2) the aggregate claims of the class exceed one hundred thousand (100,000) Federal Penalty Units; and

(3) individual litigation is not economically viable.

Congress may lower but not raise these thresholds by law.

(e) **Adhesion Contract Scrutiny.** For contracts of adhesion — defined as standardized agreements presented on a take-it-or-leave-it basis without meaningful opportunity for negotiation — courts shall:

(1) construe ambiguities against the drafter;

(2) refuse enforcement of terms not reasonably expected by the adhering party;

(3) apply heightened scrutiny to rights-affecting provisions;

(4) refuse enforcement of rights-waiving terms that are incorporated by reference rather than stated in the agreement itself.

(f) **Employment Protection.** No person may, as a condition of employment, be required to:

(1) waive the right to report workplace safety violations, fraud, or unlawful conduct to government authorities;

(2) waive the right to discuss wages and working conditions with coworkers or the public;

(3) agree to non-competition provisions exceeding twelve (12) months in duration or of unreasonable geographic scope;

(4) waive the right to testify truthfully in any legal proceeding.

These protections apply regardless of whether the person is classified as an employee, independent contractor, or otherwise.

(g) **Digital Contracts.** Click-through, browse-wrap, and similar electronic agreements:

(1) may not waive rights enumerated in subsection (a);

(2) must provide conspicuous, separately acknowledged disclosure of any arbitration, class action waiver, or dispute resolution provisions — opt-out mechanisms for such provisions that require affirmative mail, in-person, or otherwise burdensome action are presumptively inadequate;

(3) permit withdrawal of consent for prospective (but not retroactive) application upon reasonable notice.

(h) **No Regional Diminution.** Consistent with Section 1 of this Article, Regions may provide greater protection against contractual rights waiver but may not diminish the protections established in this section.

(i) **Savings Clause.** Nothing in this section limits the protections for digital data established by Article IV, Section 10, which shall continue to apply independently.

### Section 5. Citizenship and National Membership

*Resolves Gap 226 — The "Citizenship Void" (Who Are "We"?). Establishes the constitutional definition of citizenship, ensuring that the foundational question of political membership is not left to inference, statutory construction, or executive discretion. Together with Section 4, this section completes the rights framework: Section 4 defines protections available to any person; this section defines the status of citizenship upon which additional rights depend.*

(a) **Citizenship Defined.**

(1) *Birthright Citizenship.* All persons born within the territory of the United States, including all States, Regions, territories, and possessions subject to United States sovereignty, are citizens of the United States at birth. This right applies regardless of parentage, excluding only children born to parents holding diplomatic immunity accredited to the United States or to members of hostile occupying forces.

(2) *Citizenship by Parentage.* All persons born outside the territory of the United States to at least one parent who is a citizen of the United States are citizens of the United States at birth. Congress may establish reasonable administrative requirements for documentation and registration of such citizenship, but may not condition the right itself on compliance with administrative procedures.

(3) *Naturalization.* Congress shall establish uniform rules for naturalization. No person who has been lawfully naturalized may be treated as holding a lesser form of citizenship than a citizen by birth, except as provided in subsection (b)(1).

(4) *Foundlings.* Any infant or young child found within the territory of the United States whose parentage and birthplace are unknown shall be presumed to be a citizen of the United States at birth until proven otherwise by clear and convincing evidence.

(5) *Continuity.* All persons holding United States citizenship under any law, treaty, or constitutional provision in effect immediately prior to the adoption of this Constitution retain full citizenship under this Constitution, without any requirement of oath, registration, consent, or affirmative action.

(b) **Equality of Citizenship.**

(1) *No Distinction.* No distinction shall be drawn between citizens by birth and citizens by naturalization in any right, privilege, immunity, or eligibility under this Constitution, except that the President and Vice President must have held citizenship for at least twenty (20) years prior to taking office.

(2) *Regional Membership.* All citizens of the United States who are domiciled within a Region are members of that Region for purposes of representation, taxation, and public services. No Region or State may impose citizenship tests, loyalty oaths, or residency duration requirements as conditions of Regional membership beyond those established by this Constitution.

(3) *Dual Citizenship.* Citizenship under this Constitution is not affected by the holding of citizenship in another nation. No person may be required to renounce foreign citizenship as a condition of exercising rights under this Constitution.

(c) **Irrevocability and Loss of Citizenship.** Citizenship is a fundamental status that may not be involuntarily stripped, revoked, suspended, or conditioned, except upon final judicial conviction in the following narrow circumstances:

(1) *Voluntary Renunciation.* A citizen who has attained the age of eighteen (18) years may renounce citizenship by voluntary written declaration before a federal magistrate, subject to a ninety (90) day waiting period during which counseling regarding the consequences of renunciation shall be offered. No renunciation shall take effect if it would render the person stateless. No person may be coerced, threatened, or induced to renounce citizenship; any renunciation obtained through duress is void.

(2) *Treason.* Upon final conviction for treason against the United States, following trial by jury and exhaustion of all appeals.

(3) *Unauthorized Foreign Military Service.* Upon final criminal conviction for unauthorized participation in foreign combat operations or service in foreign private military organizations as defined in Article XI-RF, Section 1(e).

(4) *Exclusive Grounds.* The grounds enumerated in this subsection are the exclusive grounds upon which citizenship may be lost. No court, legislature, or executive may create additional grounds for loss of citizenship, whether denominated as denaturalization, expatriation, forfeiture, or otherwise.

(d) **Protection from Exile.** No citizen may be deported, exiled, banished, expelled from, or denied entry to the territory of the United States, nor compelled to reside in or excluded from any part thereof, except pursuant to lawful criminal sentence imposing geographic restrictions as a condition of supervised release.

(e) **Non-Citizen Rights.** Nothing in this section shall be construed to diminish the rights extended to "any person" under Section 4 of this Article or other provisions of this Constitution. Rights denominated as belonging to "any person," "all persons," or equivalent formulations are not conditioned on citizenship.

(f) **Prohibition on Citizenship Conditions.** No oath, registration, affirmation, or other act of consent shall be required to establish or exercise the rights of citizenship. Citizenship inheres automatically from the qualifying conditions of birth, parentage, or naturalization. Government agencies responsible for documenting citizenship status shall treat such documentation as a ministerial duty and shall process applications within time limits established by statute.

(g) **Implementing Legislation.** Congress shall enact legislation providing:

(1) administrative procedures for documentation and registration of citizenship by parentage under subsection (a)(2);

(2) uniform rules of naturalization under subsection (a)(3);

(3) renunciation procedures, including counseling services, under subsection (c)(1);

(4) time limits for processing citizenship documentation under subsection (f); and

(5) transition provisions for citizenship recognition during the period between adoption and full implementation of this Constitution.

## Design Rationale

### Why Structured Concurrency Rather Than Pure Non-Concurrency?

The original design used exclusive domain assignment to prevent jurisdictional ambiguity. However, modern governance is inherently interdependent—healthcare crosses with labor and commerce, environment with energy and trade. Pure non-concurrency generates constant boundary litigation as every policy touches multiple domains.

The Structured Concurrency Framework (Gap 269) resolves this by:

- **Maintaining true exclusives:** Core sovereignty functions (defense, currency, diplomacy) and genuinely local matters (zoning, family law, K-12) remain exclusive
- **Acknowledging inherent overlap:** Eight structured concurrent domains receive explicit floor/ceiling treatment
- **Federal floors, not mandates:** Federal authority in concurrent domains is limited to minimum standards addressing cross-regional spillover
- **Regional primary authority:** Regions have primary regulatory authority within concurrent domains
- **Dispute prevention:** Pre-enactment consultation, safe harbors, and expedited certification reduce litigation
- **Litigation management:** Filing limits and frivolousness penalties prevent strategic flooding

This approach preserves the benefits of clear jurisdiction while avoiding the rigidity that generated 500+ disputes annually in pure non-concurrency models.

### Why Rights Floors Rather Than Uniform Rights?

Uniform national rights prevent Regional policy variation and force national political battles over every rights question. Rights floors:

- establish minimum protections everywhere
- allow Regions to exceed minimums based on local preferences
- reduce political stakes of federal elections
- preserve policy diversity

### Why Subsidiarity?

Centralized authority creates:

- democratic distance (voters far from decision-makers)
- one-size-fits-all policies for diverse populations
- winner-take-all political dynamics
- authoritarian consolidation risk

Subsidiarity keeps decisions close to affected populations while ensuring baseline protections through judicial enforcement.

### Why "Any Person" Rather Than "Citizen" in the Unwaivable Core?

Section 4 uses "any person" rather than "citizen" deliberately. Adhesion contracts, forced arbitration clauses, and class action waivers affect all persons within U.S. jurisdiction — non-citizen workers, lawful residents, tourists, and visitors are equally subject to terms-of-service extraction. Limiting protection to citizens would create a two-tier rights regime where non-citizens face even greater contractual coercion. The Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses already protect "any person," and Section 4 follows this established scope.

### Why Functional Language in the Prohibition on Secret Law?

Section 18 deliberately avoids naming specific statutory bodies (the Office of Legal Counsel, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court). Constitutional text that names statutory bodies is brittle — Congress can rename an office to escape coverage. Sections 13-17 consistently use functional language ("The Executive," "Inspectors General within the Executive Branch"), and Section 18 follows this pattern: "any executive component, office, or official issuing legal opinions" and "any court, tribunal, or judicial body issuing ex parte orders under surveillance authority." Named bodies are designated in implementing legislation under Section 18(j).

### Why a Hybrid Self-Execution Model for Secret Law?

Section 18 resolves the tension between immediate invalidity and operational reality through a three-layer approach: (1) During the 180-day publication window, interpretations are operative but must be disclosed to Congress and courts on request (§18(c)(vi)); (2) After 180 days, unpublished interpretations are void (§18(a)(iv)); (3) A 5-year hard sunset catches any interpretation that evades the 180-day mandate through relabeling or other gaming (§18(i)). This avoids both the recklessness of instant invalidity (which could destabilize active intelligence programs overnight) and the permissiveness of a purely challenge-based model (which founders on the standing paradox: who challenges law they don't know exists?).

### Why a Constitutional Citizenship Definition?

The constitution references "citizens" in at least six provisions across four articles (Article I §8 freedom of movement, Article I §21 suffrage, Article VII §1(d) franchise, Article XIV-RF §5 standing, Article IV §6 census, Article XI-RF §1(e) denaturalization) but never defines who is a citizen. If a new constitutional framework supersedes the existing Constitution without explicitly incorporating the Fourteenth Amendment's citizenship clause, the foundational question — who is a citizen? — becomes legally ambiguous. Section 5 closes this void by constitutionalizing birthright citizenship (jus soli), citizenship by parentage (jus sanguinis), and the continuity of all existing citizenship. Together with Section 4 ("any person" protections), Section 5 completes the rights framework: Section 4 defines protections available to all persons; Section 5 defines the status of citizenship upon which additional rights depend.

### Why Equal Citizenship and the Twenty-Year Requirement?

The current Constitution's "natural-born citizen" requirement for the Presidency creates a two-tier citizenship system that is incompatible with Section 5(b)(1)'s principle that no distinction shall be drawn between citizens by birth and by naturalization. Rather than preserving this anachronism, Section 5(b)(1) replaces it with a twenty-year citizenship duration requirement — ensuring that presidential candidates have deep roots in the polity without creating a permanent second class of citizens who can never hold the highest office regardless of their commitment to the nation.

### Why Three Narrow Grounds for Loss of Citizenship?

Section 5(c) limits citizenship loss to three grounds: voluntary renunciation, treason conviction, and unauthorized foreign military service conviction. The third ground harmonizes with Article XI-RF §1(e), which previously stripped citizenship automatically for foreign military service violations. Section 5(c)(3) requires final criminal conviction rather than administrative determination — ensuring due process while preserving the deterrent against mercenary service. The exclusive-grounds clause (§5(c)(4)) prevents any court, legislature, or executive from creating additional denaturalization categories, whether denominated as expatriation, forfeiture, or otherwise.

### Why Explicit Jus Sanguinis?

Under current law, children born abroad to U.S. citizen parents receive citizenship by statute (8 U.S.C. §1401), not by constitutional right. This means Congress could theoretically revoke jus sanguinis citizenship for future births. Section 5(a)(2) elevates this to a constitutional right while preserving congressional authority over administrative procedures — ensuring that no American family serving abroad, in the military, or in diplomatic service risks having their children's citizenship depend on the whims of a future Congress.

### Why Senate Consent for Treaty Withdrawal?

The Constitution requires a two-thirds Senate supermajority to enter treaties but is silent on withdrawal. Courts have never definitively resolved whether the President can unilaterally exit treaties, and practice has drifted toward executive unilateralism (Paris Climate Agreement, Iran nuclear deal, INF Treaty, Open Skies Treaty). Section 19 restores the democratic consent principle: if broad consensus is needed to bind the nation, some level of democratic consent should be needed to unbind it. Simple majority (rather than two-thirds) for exit avoids creating "zombie treaties" that a majority opposes but a minority blocks from termination, while the emergency suspension mechanism handles genuine crises without bypassing the Senate.

### Why a Three-Tier Agreement Framework?

Modern international commitments take three forms — treaties (Senate ratification), congressional-executive agreements (bicameral approval), and sole executive agreements (President alone) — but the Constitution addresses only the first. Section 19(d) closes this gap by applying withdrawal constraints matched to the entry instrument. The four-year hard cap on sole executive agreements prevents Presidents from using the "executive agreement" label to create durable commitments that bypass the Senate, while ensuring that agreements intended to outlast an administration receive congressional endorsement.

### Why Exempt Indigenous Treaties?

Treaties between the United States and Indigenous Nations are sui generis — they are domestic compacts between a sovereign and dependent nations, not foreign affairs instruments. Article XXIII already requires free, prior, and informed consent for any action that diminishes tribal sovereignty or modifies treaty rights. Section 19(k) makes explicit that this general withdrawal framework does not override those protections, preventing any argument that the new treaty withdrawal process could be used to unilaterally terminate indigenous treaty obligations.

### Why a Single-Suspension Limit?

Without an explicit limit, a President could perpetually suspend a treaty through serial 180-day certifications, achieving de facto withdrawal without ever obtaining Senate consent. Section 19(e)(4) limits emergency suspension to once per treaty per presidential term, forcing the President to seek Senate consent if the situation persists beyond six months. This preserves executive flexibility for genuine emergencies while closing the serial-suspension loophole.

### Why an Independent Medical Panel for Presidential Incapacity?

The 25th Amendment's Section 4 places the incapacity determination in the hands of the Vice President and a majority of the Cabinet — political appointees selected for loyalty who serve at the President's pleasure. This creates a structural conflict of interest: the people best positioned to observe incapacity are the people with the most to lose by acting on it. No Cabinet has ever invoked Section 4 despite documented incapacity (Woodrow Wilson was incapacitated for 18 months while his wife effectively governed; Reagan aides debated invoking but declined). Section 20 replaces this loyalty-dependent mechanism with an independent medical panel whose members have no career stake in the outcome, transforming the determination from a political judgment into a professional medical one.

### Why Seven Members Appointed by NAM, SCOTUS, and Congress?

Three appointing authorities prevent any single branch from controlling the Panel. The National Academy of Medicine (three members) provides medical credibility and professional standards; the Chief Justice (two members) provides institutional independence parallel to the Judicial Conference's role in judicial incapacity; and congressional leaders (two members, bipartisan) provide democratic accountability. The Surgeon General is excluded because as a uniformed military officer subordinate to the President who serves at the President's pleasure, the same loyalty-dependency that renders the Cabinet mechanism ineffective would compromise the Panel's independence. The seven-member odd number avoids ties while remaining small enough for rapid deliberation during emergencies.

### Why Chief Justice Vacancy Appointments?

Senate delay or refusal to confirm Panel members could be weaponized to leave the Panel without a quorum, creating a structural immunity from incapacity determination. The Chief Justice's temporary appointment power, modeled on similar vacancy-filling mechanisms elsewhere in the judiciary, ensures the Panel remains functional regardless of confirmation politics. The ninety-day trigger is long enough to give the Senate genuine opportunity to act but short enough to prevent deliberate paralysis.

### Why Acting President Restrictions?

Without restrictions, the Vice President serving as Acting President could consolidate power by pardoning the incapacitated President (extinguishing future accountability), removing Panel members (undermining future determinations), or dismissing medical staff (destroying evidence of incapacity). These restrictions close the "Acting President coup" gaming vector while preserving all other executive powers needed to govern effectively during the incapacity period.

### Why Immediate Nuclear Transfer?

Nuclear command authority cannot be divided or ambiguous. During the fourteen-day challenge period, having two individuals each claiming nuclear authority creates dangerous uncertainty that adversaries could exploit. Section 20(g) adopts a simple principle: whoever holds the powers and duties holds all the powers and duties, including nuclear authorization under Article XI, Section 2(g). This eliminates the "nuclear limbo" gaming vector entirely.

### Why Procedural-Only Judicial Review for Incapacity?

Allowing courts to review the Panel's medical judgments would transform incapacity determinations into adversarial litigation, with the President's legal team challenging medical evidence while the country operates under dual authority. Procedural review ensures the process was followed correctly without turning the judiciary into a super-medical panel. This parallels the judicial non-review of the Judicial Conference's own incapacity determinations under Article XIV and matches the procedural-only review applied to treaty withdrawal under Section 19(m).

### Why a Dual Track for Temporary and Permanent Incapacity?

A President recovering from surgery needs a rapid clearance mechanism (fourteen-day follow-up evaluations), while a President with progressive cognitive decline needs a permanent removal pathway (sixty-day threshold plus supermajority reaffirmation). Without the dual track, temporary incapacity would either be under-treated (no rapid return) or over-treated (premature permanent removal), and permanent incapacity would lack the elevated threshold that its finality demands. The sixty-day reclassification trigger provides a clear boundary between the two tracks.
