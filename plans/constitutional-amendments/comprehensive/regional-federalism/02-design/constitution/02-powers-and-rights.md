- three appointed by a majority vote of Regional Governors,
- three appointed by the Chief Justice from among retired federal and state appellate judges.

(c) **Terms.** Members shall serve staggered nine-year terms, non-renewable. No more than three members may be affiliated with the same political party. Members may be removed only for cause by two-thirds vote of the Senate.

## ARTICLE III - RIGHTS FLOORS AND SUBSIDIARITY

### Section 1. Floors, Not Ceilings

Federal rights and standards establish minimum protections only.

No federal law shall be interpreted to prohibit a Region or State from exceeding such protections unless explicitly stated.

---

### Section 2. Subsidiarity with Enforcement

Authority resides at the lowest level capable of exercising it effectively, subject to judicial enforcement of constitutional boundaries.

---

### Section 3. Hierarchy of Law

(a) This Constitution is the supreme law of the United States.

(b) Within their respective spheres:

- Federal law enacted pursuant to enumerated federal powers is supreme over conflicting Regional, State, or local law.
- Regional law enacted pursuant to enumerated Regional powers is supreme over conflicting State or local law within the Region.
- State law is supreme over conflicting local law within the State.

(c) State Constitutions.

(1) State constitutions may not conflict with this Constitution or with the Regional constitution of the Region in which the State is located.

(2) State constitutions may establish protections exceeding those in the Regional or federal constitutions (floors, not ceilings).

(3) In case of conflict between a State constitution and a Regional constitution:

- the Regional constitution prevails on matters within enumerated Regional powers,
- the State constitution prevails on matters within reserved State powers,
- disputes shall be resolved by the Allocation Review Board, with appeal to the Supreme Court.

(d) Local Charters. Local government charters and ordinances are subordinate to State law and may not conflict with State, Regional, or federal law.

(e) Pre-Ratification State Law. State law in effect at ratification continues in force unless:

- inconsistent with this Constitution,
- superseded by Regional law on matters transferred to Regional authority,
- or repealed by the State.

## Design Rationale

### Why Exclusive Rather Than Concurrent Powers?

Traditional federalism allows concurrent jurisdiction, creating ambiguity exploited by both levels of government. The non-concurrency rule:

- prevents federal "creeping preemption" of Regional/State authority
- prevents Regions from obstructing federal enumerated powers
- creates clear lines for judicial enforcement
- reduces intergovernmental conflict

### Why Rights Floors Rather Than Uniform Rights?

Uniform national rights prevent Regional policy variation and force national political battles over every rights question. Rights floors:

- establish minimum protections everywhere
- allow Regions to exceed minimums based on local preferences
- reduce political stakes of federal elections
- preserve policy diversity

### Why Subsidiarity?

Centralized authority creates:

- democratic distance (voters far from decision-makers)
- one-size-fits-all policies for diverse populations
- winner-take-all political dynamics
- authoritarian consolidation risk

Subsidiarity keeps decisions close to affected populations while ensuring baseline protections through judicial enforcement.
