*This document contains the constitutional safeguard provisions of the Regional Federal Constitution, addressing the stability and amendment processes.*

---

## ARTICLE XII - SECESSION, NULLIFICATION, AND DE-ESCALATION

### Section 1. No Secession

No State or Region may secede from the United States.

---

### Section 2. No Nullification

No jurisdiction may nullify constitutional law.

---

### Section 3. De-Escalation

Constitutional conflicts shall be resolved through graduated de-escalation procedures established by statute, prioritizing judicial resolution and avoiding military intervention except as a last resort with multi-key authorization.

The de-escalation sequence shall prioritize:

1. judicial enforcement,
2. administrative remedies,
3. temporary intervention,
4. immediate restoration of self-government upon compliance.

Implementation procedures are established by statute. See the [De-Escalation Procedures Act](../../proposals/01-foundations/de-escalation-procedures-act.md) for the proposed implementing legislation.

#### Imminent Harm Bypass

(a) **Imminent Harm Certification.** The de-escalation sequence may be bypassed if:

(1) The Allocation Review Board certifies imminent harm; or

(2) The Supreme Court certifies imminent harm; or

(3) Both the President and a majority of Regional Governors certify imminent harm.

(b) **Imminent Harm Standards.** Certification requires finding that continued delay poses imminent threat to:

(1) Life or physical safety of persons;

(2) National security or territorial integrity;

(3) The integrity of the National Common Market;

(4) Critical infrastructure necessary for public welfare.

(c) **Expedited Certification.** Imminent harm certification:

(1) Shall be issued within forty-eight (48) hours of request;

(2) May be issued ex parte if exigent circumstances require;

(3) Is not subject to appeal until after federal action concludes.

(d) **Post-Bypass Review.** After imminent harm bypass:

(1) The bypassed de-escalation steps shall be completed retroactively;

(2) If the certification was erroneous, affected parties may recover damages;

(3) Pattern of improper certifications triggers enhanced scrutiny.

#### Stage Time Limits

(e) **Stage Time Limits.** Each stage of the de-escalation sequence has maximum duration:

(1) Initial notification and demand: seventy-two (72) hours;

(2) Administrative mediation: fourteen (14) days;

(3) Judicial review (trial level): thirty (30) days;

(4) Appellate review: fourteen (14) days per level;

(5) Total de-escalation sequence: not to exceed ninety (90) days.

(f) **Automatic Escalation.** Upon expiration of any stage time limit:

(1) The sequence advances automatically to the next stage;

(2) Pending motions or appeals are deemed denied;

(3) No extension may be granted except by unanimous consent of all parties.

(g) **Final Stage Consequence.** Upon expiration of the ninety (90) day total:

(1) All judicial and administrative remedies are deemed exhausted;

(2) Military intervention authority activates automatically;

(3) The Two-Key requirement is satisfied by the exhaustion of alternatives.

#### Bad Faith Participation Finding

(h) **Bad Faith Indicators.** The following constitute evidence of bad faith participation in de-escalation:

(1) Demands that exceed pre-crisis status quo by more than de minimis adjustments;

(2) Failure to attend scheduled mediation sessions without valid excuse;

(3) Continued physical consolidation of contested position during negotiations;

(4) Communication with foreign powers regarding disputed matter during mediation.

(i) **Bad Faith Finding.** Upon finding of bad faith:

(1) The de-escalation sequence terminates immediately;

(2) All pending time limits are deemed expired;

(3) The bad faith actor forfeits the right to further judicial review before federal action.

(j) **Bad Faith Consequences.** The bad faith actor:

(1) Bears all costs of subsequent federal action;

(2) Is estopped from claiming procedural defects;

(3) Responsible officials are personally liable.

#### Anti-Consolidation Measures

(k) **Freeze Order.** Upon initiation of de-escalation sequence:

(1) All parties must maintain positions as of the date of initiation;

(2) Physical fortification, troop movement, or asset seizure is prohibited;

(3) Violation of the freeze order constitutes bad faith.

(l) **Foreign Contact Prohibition.** During de-escalation:

(1) No party may seek foreign recognition, support, or intervention;

(2) No party may negotiate with foreign powers regarding the disputed matter;

(3) Violation of the foreign contact prohibition constitutes bad faith.

(m) **Asset Preservation.** Contested federal assets:

(1) Shall be placed under neutral custodianship (U.S. Marshals or agreed third party);

(2) May not be damaged, sold, or transferred during de-escalation;

(3) Damage or transfer constitutes grounds for immediate federal intervention.

## ARTICLE XIII - CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS

### Section 1. Proposal

Amendments may be proposed by:

- two-thirds of each chamber of Congress, or
- two-thirds of Regional legislatures.

---

### Section 2. Ratification

Amendments require:

- ratification by three-fourths of Regions, and
- approval by a majority of votes cast in a national popular referendum.

No minimum turnout threshold shall be required for the national referendum.

---

### Section 3. Ratification Window

Proposed amendments must be ratified within seven years of proposal. Amendments not ratified within this period expire and must be reproposed to be considered again.

---

### Section 4. No Partial Ratification

No Region may conditionally ratify an amendment or ratify only portions thereof. Ratification must be complete and unconditional.

---

### Section 5. Uniform Application

No amendment may apply asymmetrically among Regions.

---

### Section 6. Commentary on Ratification Threshold

(a) The three-fourths Regional ratification requirement combined with national popular referendum creates a dual legitimacy requirement: both geographic diversity (through Regions) and popular support (through referendum).

(b) The high threshold is intentional. Constitutional amendments should require broad consensus across the federated structure. Regional minority protection is a core value of this Constitution.

(c) The number of Regions may change pursuant to Article I, Section 4. Any boundary revision that would change the number of Regions shall include analysis of the effect on amendment thresholds.

(d) The three-fourths requirement applies to Regions as constituted at the time of ratification vote, not at the time of proposal.

---

## Design Rationale

### Why Prohibit Secession?

Secession availability:

- raises political stakes to existential levels
- enables exit threats as negotiating leverage
- undermines commitment to working within the system
- historically led to the bloodiest conflict in American history

The prohibition forces political actors to work within the constitutional framework rather than threatening exit.

### Why Prohibit Nullification?

Nullification-the claimed right of states to void federal law-was:

- used to resist civil rights enforcement
- used to justify segregation
- fundamentally incompatible with constitutional supremacy
- a path to constitutional disintegration

Disputes about federal overreach must be resolved through courts, not unilateral state action.

### Why De-Escalation Rather Than Punishment?

Constitutional crises are dangerous precisely because they escalate. Punitive responses:

- create martyrs and grievances
- entrench resistance
- make restoration harder
- risk civil conflict

The de-escalation ladder prioritizes restoration of constitutional order, not punishment of violators. The goal is functional governance, not revenge.

### Why Dual Ratification?

The current Article V process:

- gives small states disproportionate power (3/4 of state legislatures)
- has no popular vote requirement
- allows amendments ratified against majority will

Dual ratification requires:

- geographic breadth (3/4 of Regions)
- popular support (majority in national referendum)

This prevents both small-state domination and large-state trampling of Regional interests.

### Why No Minimum Turnout?

Minimum turnout requirements:

- reward abstention as a veto strategy
- make amendment harder for obscure but important matters
- create perverse incentives to suppress turnout

The majority of those who vote is sufficient democratic legitimacy.

### Why Seven-Year Ratification Window?

Open-ended ratification creates:

- uncertainty about pending amendments
- possibility of ratification decades after proposal when conditions have changed
- constitutional instability

Seven years provides adequate time for deliberation while ensuring timeliness.

## De-Escalation Ladder: Summary

> **Note:** Detailed implementation procedures are in the [De-Escalation Procedures Act](../../proposals/01-foundations/de-escalation-procedures-act.md). This section provides an overview.

**Level 1: Judicial Enforcement** - Courts issue compliance orders with expedited review and contempt powers.

**Level 2: Administrative Remedies** - Fund withholding, penalties, and federal assumption of specific functions.

**Level 3: Temporary Intervention** - Federal personnel and Regional Guard forces (with two-key authorization) if necessary.

**Level 4: Restoration** - Immediate restoration of self-government upon compliance; no ongoing punishment.

The goal at every level is restoration, not domination.
