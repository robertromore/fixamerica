# Constitutional Safeguards

## Articles XII-XIII: Secession, Nullification, and Amendments

*This document contains the constitutional safeguard provisions of the Regional Federal Constitution, addressing the stability and amendment processes.*

---

## ARTICLE XII - SECESSION, NULLIFICATION, AND DE-ESCALATION

### Section 1. No Secession

No State or Region may secede from the United States.

---

### Section 2. No Nullification

No jurisdiction may nullify constitutional law.

---

### Section 3. De-Escalation

Constitutional conflicts shall be resolved through graduated de-escalation procedures established by statute, prioritizing judicial resolution and avoiding military intervention except as a last resort with multi-key authorization.

The de-escalation sequence shall prioritize:

1. judicial enforcement,
2. administrative remedies,
3. temporary intervention,
4. immediate restoration of self-government upon compliance.

Implementation procedures are established by statute. See the [De-Escalation Procedures Act](../../proposals/01-foundations/de-escalation-procedures-act.md) for the proposed implementing legislation.

#### Imminent Harm Bypass

(a) **Imminent Harm Certification.** The de-escalation sequence may be bypassed if:

(1) The Allocation Review Board certifies imminent harm; or

(2) The Supreme Court certifies imminent harm; or

(3) Both the President and a majority of Regional Governors certify imminent harm.

(b) **Imminent Harm Standards.** Certification requires finding that continued delay poses imminent threat to:

(1) Life or physical safety of persons;

(2) National security or territorial integrity;

(3) The integrity of the National Common Market;

(4) Critical infrastructure necessary for public welfare.

(c) **Expedited Certification.** Imminent harm certification:

(1) Shall be issued within forty-eight (48) hours of request;

(2) May be issued ex parte if exigent circumstances require;

(3) Is not subject to appeal until after federal action concludes.

(d) **Post-Bypass Review.** After imminent harm bypass:

(1) The bypassed de-escalation steps shall be completed retroactively;

(2) If the certification was erroneous, affected parties may recover damages;

(3) Pattern of improper certifications triggers enhanced scrutiny.

#### Stage Time Limits

(e) **Stage Time Limits.** Each stage of the de-escalation sequence has maximum duration:

(1) Initial notification and demand: seventy-two (72) hours;

(2) Administrative mediation: fourteen (14) days;

(3) Judicial review (trial level): thirty (30) days;

(4) Appellate review: fourteen (14) days per level;

(5) Total de-escalation sequence: not to exceed ninety (90) days.

(f) **Automatic Escalation.** Upon expiration of any stage time limit:

(1) The sequence advances automatically to the next stage;

(2) Pending motions or appeals are deemed denied;

(3) No extension may be granted except by unanimous consent of all parties.

(g) **Final Stage Consequence.** Upon expiration of the ninety (90) day total:

(1) All judicial and administrative remedies are deemed exhausted;

(2) Military intervention authority activates automatically;

(3) The Two-Key requirement is satisfied by the exhaustion of alternatives.

#### Bad Faith Participation Finding

(h) **Bad Faith Indicators.** The following constitute evidence of bad faith participation in de-escalation:

(1) Demands that exceed pre-crisis status quo by more than de minimis adjustments;

(2) Failure to attend scheduled mediation sessions without valid excuse;

(3) Continued physical consolidation of contested position during negotiations;

(4) Communication with foreign powers regarding disputed matter during mediation.

(i) **Bad Faith Finding.** Upon finding of bad faith:

(1) The de-escalation sequence terminates immediately;

(2) All pending time limits are deemed expired;

(3) The bad faith actor forfeits the right to further judicial review before federal action.

(j) **Bad Faith Consequences.** The bad faith actor:

(1) Bears all costs of subsequent federal action;

(2) Is estopped from claiming procedural defects;

(3) Responsible officials are personally liable.

#### Anti-Consolidation Measures

(k) **Freeze Order.** Upon initiation of de-escalation sequence:

(1) All parties must maintain positions as of the date of initiation;

(2) Physical fortification, troop movement, or asset seizure is prohibited;

(3) Violation of the freeze order constitutes bad faith.

(l) **Foreign Contact Prohibition.** During de-escalation:

(1) No party may seek foreign recognition, support, or intervention;

(2) No party may negotiate with foreign powers regarding the disputed matter;

(3) Violation of the foreign contact prohibition constitutes bad faith.

(m) **Asset Preservation.** Contested federal assets:

(1) Shall be placed under neutral custodianship (U.S. Marshals or agreed third party);

(2) May not be damaged, sold, or transferred during de-escalation;

(3) Damage or transfer constitutes grounds for immediate federal intervention.

---

### Section 4. Coordinated Threat Response

*[This section addresses the risk that individually-mitigated constitutional vulnerabilities may be exploited simultaneously through coordinated multi-vector attacks that overwhelm institutional response capacity. See Gap 33.]*

#### Cross-Institutional Alert System

(a) **Coordinated Threat Detection.** When any constitutional institution detects an attack or anomaly within its domain — including but not limited to certification challenges, judicial recusal patterns, fiscal anomalies, data access denials, or cyber-kinetic incidents — it shall immediately notify:

(1) The Supreme Court, or its Emergency Quorum designee;

(2) The Independent Fiscal Council;

(3) All Regional Governors;

(4) The National Election Court, during election or referendum periods;

(5) The Congressional leadership of both chambers.

(b) **Coordinated Threat Assessment.** When two or more institutions report domain-specific attacks or anomalies within a thirty (30) day period:

(1) A Coordinated Threat Assessment shall be convened within seventy-two (72) hours;

(2) The Assessment shall be conducted by a standing inter-institutional panel comprising one designee each from the Supreme Court, IFC, and Regional Governors' Council;

(3) The panel shall determine whether the reported events constitute a coordinated multi-vector attack;

(4) Upon finding of coordination, the panel shall recommend specific institutional responses and resource deployments.

(c) **Communication During Assessment.** The Coordinated Threat Assessment:

(1) May not be delayed or obstructed by any single institution or official;

(2) Shall proceed even if one or more institutions fail to designate a representative;

(3) Shall be conducted via hardened communication channels established under subsection (e).

#### Concurrent Crisis Adjudication

(d) **Judicial Surge Capacity.** The National Election Court and Supreme Court shall maintain institutional capacity to adjudicate three (3) concurrent emergency matters simultaneously:

(1) The Judicial Council shall maintain a reserve roster of qualified judges who may be temporarily assigned to emergency panels without displacing standing judges;

(2) Reserve judges shall meet the same qualifications and independence standards as standing judges;

(3) Emergency panel assignments shall be by lot from the reserve roster, not by designation of any single official;

(4) No emergency panel may include more than one reserve judge per three standing judges.

#### Communication Resilience

(e) **Hardened Communication Channels.** Federal institutions, the Independent Fiscal Council, and Regional Governors shall maintain redundant, hardened communication channels independent of public internet and commercial telecommunications infrastructure:

(1) These channels shall be sufficient to conduct all multi-key authorization procedures, coordinated threat assessments, and emergency adjudication even during complete disruption of civilian communications;

(2) Channels shall be tested quarterly under simulated disruption conditions;

(3) No single actor — federal, Regional, or private — shall have the ability to sever all inter-institutional communication channels simultaneously;

(4) Specifications and maintenance shall be overseen by a joint committee of the institutions served, not by any single branch.

#### Dependency Audit

(f) **Cascading Dependency Review.** The Constitutional Review Commission shall conduct annual audits of constitutional mitigation dependency chains:

(1) The audit shall identify any sequence where the effectiveness of one constitutional safeguard depends on the functioning of a second safeguard, which depends on a third;

(2) For any dependency chain exceeding two links, the Commission shall recommend either:

- (A) an independent fallback mechanism that bypasses the chain; or
- (B) a constitutional floor provision that activates automatically if the chain fails;

(3) Audit findings and recommendations shall be reported to Congress and published for public review within ninety (90) days of completion.

#### Periodic Stress Testing

(g) **Multi-Vector Simulation.** Every five (5) years, the Constitutional Review Commission shall conduct a simulation exercise testing institutional response to coordinated multi-vector attack scenarios:

(1) Simulations shall include, at minimum, scenarios involving simultaneous attacks on executive compliance, judicial capacity, electoral certification, fiscal systems, and communication infrastructure;

(2) All constitutional institutions shall participate;

(3) Results shall be reported to Congress and the public in summary form;

(4) Specific vulnerability details identified during simulation may be restricted to cleared officials for a period not exceeding two (2) years, after which they shall be declassified absent renewed certification of ongoing risk.

## ARTICLE XIII - CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS

### Section 1. Proposal

Amendments may be proposed by:

- two-thirds of each chamber of Congress, or
- two-thirds of Regional legislatures.

---

### Section 2. Ratification

Amendments require:

- ratification by three-fourths of Regions, and
- approval by a majority of votes cast in a national popular referendum.

No minimum turnout threshold shall be required for the national referendum.

---

### Section 3. Ratification Window

Proposed amendments must be ratified within seven years of proposal. Amendments not ratified within this period expire and must be reproposed to be considered again.

---

### Section 4. No Partial Ratification

No Region may conditionally ratify an amendment or ratify only portions thereof. Ratification must be complete and unconditional.

---

### Section 5. Uniform Application

No amendment may apply asymmetrically among Regions.

---

### Section 6. Commentary on Ratification Threshold

(a) The three-fourths Regional ratification requirement combined with national popular referendum creates a dual legitimacy requirement: both geographic diversity (through Regions) and popular support (through referendum).

(b) The high threshold is intentional. Constitutional amendments should require broad consensus across the federated structure. Regional minority protection is a core value of this Constitution.

(c) The number of Regions may change pursuant to Article I, Section 4. Any boundary revision that would change the number of Regions shall include analysis of the effect on amendment thresholds.

(d) The three-fourths requirement applies to Regions as constituted at the time of ratification vote, not at the time of proposal.

---

### Section 7. Referendum Immunity Protocol

#### Referendum Period Immunity

(a) **Referendum Immunity Period.** A "Referendum Immunity Period" shall begin thirty (30) days before any National Popular Referendum and continue until certification of results:

(d) **Emergency Referendum Postponement.** If a genuine emergency makes referendum impossible:

(1) Postponement requires certification by the National Electoral Commission and the Chief Justice;

(2) Postponement shall be for the minimum time necessary, not exceeding sixty (60) days;

(3) The Referendum Immunity Period recommences when the referendum is rescheduled.

### Section 8. Popular Ratification Bypass

*[This section provides an alternative amendment pathway when substantial Regional support exists but falls short of the three-fourths threshold due to minority veto. See Gap 157.]*

(a) **Triggering Conditions.** If an Amendment proposed by Congress:

(1) Is ratified by at least four (4) Regional Legislatures;

(2) Fails to achieve three-fourths ratification within two (2) years of Congressional proposal; and

(3) Has not been rejected by more than two (2) Regional Legislatures;

(b) **Congressional Authorization.** Congress may, by two-thirds vote of each chamber taken within six (6) months after the two-year deadline, submit the Amendment to a National Referendum;

(c) **Ratification Requirements.** The Amendment becomes part of this Constitution if approved by:

(1) Fifty-seven percent (57%) of the total national vote cast; AND

(2) A majority of voters in at least four (4) Regions;

(d) **Usage Limitations.** No more than two (2) bypass amendments may be:

(1) Submitted to referendum per decade;

(2) Adopted via bypass per two decades;

(e) **Referendum Process.** National Referenda under this section:

(1) Shall be conducted by the National Electoral Commission;

(2) Shall include standardized informational materials prepared by nonpartisan federal agencies;

(3) May not be held during the same election cycle as Presidential elections to avoid partisan spillover effects;

(f) **Anti-Circumvention.** This bypass may not be used for amendments that:

(1) Alter the basic structure of Regional Federalism;

(2) Eliminate the requirement for Regional ratification of future amendments;

(3) Were previously submitted to referendum and failed within the preceding decade.

(g) **Referendum Integrity Protections.**

(1) No Regional government may restrict voter registration or access specifically for federal referendum participation;

(2) Polling locations and hours must meet federal minimum standards;

(3) Any interference with referendum voting triggers federal election intervention procedures;

(4) Results are not final until certified by both National Electoral Commission and federal courts.

---

### Section 9. Convention Scope Limitation

*[This section prevents a constitutional convention from exceeding its mandate, addressing the "runaway convention" risk. See Gap 187.]*

(a) **Scope Limitation.** A Convention for proposing Amendments called pursuant to this Article shall be strictly limited to the specific subject matter identified in the applications of the Regional Legislatures. Any proposal exceeding this scope is ultra vires and void.

(b) **Pre-Convention Scope Certification.** Before any Convention may convene:

(1) the Constitutional Court shall certify the scope of the Convention based on the language of the calling applications;

(2) the certification shall define the subject matter boundaries with specificity;

(3) the certification is binding on all Convention proceedings;

(4) no Convention may convene without scope certification.

(c) **Delegate Oath.** All Convention delegates shall, before participating in proceedings, swear or affirm:

(1) to limit their proposals to the certified scope;

(2) to recognize the Constitutional Court's authority to enforce scope limitations;

(3) that violation of the scope limitation constitutes breach of oath.

Delegates who violate their oath are subject to removal from the Convention and may be prosecuted for breach of constitutional duty.

(d) **Real-Time Monitoring.** The Constitutional Court shall:

(1) appoint an observer to attend all Convention proceedings;

(2) receive daily reports on Convention activities;

(3) have authority to issue cease-and-desist orders if proceedings exceed certified scope;

(4) have authority to declare specific proposals ultra vires during Convention proceedings.

(e) **Ratification Bar.** No amendment proposed by a Convention may be submitted for ratification until:

(1) the Constitutional Court certifies that it falls within the certified scope;

(2) the scope certification may be challenged by any Region, the President, or Congress;

(3) scope determination shall be completed within sixty (60) days.

(f) **Severability.** If any portion of a Convention's output is determined to exceed the certified scope:

(1) the entire Convention output is void;

(2) legitimate proposals may not be "severed" and separately ratified;

(3) a new Convention must be called for any desired amendments.

This severability rule prevents bundling legitimate and illegitimate proposals.

(g) **Sovereignty Limitation.** A Convention called under this Article:

(1) is a creature of the Constitution, not superior to it;

(2) derives its authority solely from this Article, not from "the people" directly;

(3) may not claim authority beyond that granted by this Article;

(4) may not declare itself a "constitutional convention" with plenary authority.

Claims of inherent sovereignty or extra-constitutional authority are void and without legal effect.

(h) **Original Jurisdiction.** The Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction to enforce this section. Standing to challenge Convention proceedings or proposals is granted to:

(1) any Region;

(2) the President;

(3) either house of Congress by majority vote;

(4) the Constitutional Court.

---

### Section 10. Eternity Clause

*[This section establishes unamendable constitutional provisions to prevent democracy from using its own procedures to abolish itself. See Gap 249.]*

(a) **Unamendable Provisions.** Amendments to this Constitution may not:

(1) abolish the democratic and republican form of government;

(2) abolish, suspend, or render unenforceable the Bill of Rights or subsequent amendments protecting individual liberties;

(3) abolish or suspend regular elections for federal office;

(4) abolish or fundamentally alter the separation of powers among the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial branches;

(5) abolish or fundamentally alter the federal structure dividing power between the Federal Government and the Regions or States;

(6) abolish or fundamentally alter the independence of the Judiciary;

(7) concentrate governmental power in a single person, office, or entity;

(8) establish any hereditary office or title;

(9) abolish or suspend the right of the people to alter their government through constitutional amendment.

(b) **Void Ab Initio.** Any amendment purporting to accomplish objectives prohibited by subsection (a) is void from the beginning and of no legal effect, regardless of the procedures by which it was proposed or ratified.

(c) **Pre-Ratification Review.** Before any proposed amendment may be submitted to Regions or the people for ratification:

(1) the Constitutional Court shall review the proposal for compliance with this section;

(2) if the Constitutional Court finds the proposal violates this section, it shall declare the proposal ineligible for ratification;

(3) the Constitutional Court's determination may be appealed to the Supreme Court within thirty (30) days;

(4) no ratification proceedings may occur until judicial review is complete.

(d) **Post-Ratification Review.** If an amendment is ratified despite pre-ratification review:

(1) any citizen, State, Region, or federal officer may challenge the amendment within five (5) years of ratification;

(2) the Constitutional Court shall have mandatory jurisdiction over such challenges;

(3) if the Constitutional Court finds the amendment violates this section, the amendment is void and all actions taken under it are reversed to the extent practicable.

(e) **Interpretation Standard.** In determining whether a proposed or ratified amendment violates this section:

(1) courts shall consider substance over form, examining the practical effect of the amendment rather than its stated purpose;

(2) courts shall consider cumulative effect, examining whether the amendment combined with previous amendments would accomplish prohibited objectives;

(3) doubt shall be resolved in favor of preserving democratic governance and individual liberty.

(f) **This Section Unamendable.** This section itself may not be amended or repealed. Any amendment purporting to modify or abolish this section is void.

(g) **Enforcement.** Federal officers who attempt to implement provisions of void amendments, or who refuse to recognize judicial determinations under this section, shall be subject to:

(1) immediate removal from office by the Constitutional Court;

(2) criminal prosecution for violation of constitutional duty;

(3) permanent disqualification from federal service.

## Design Rationale

### Why Prohibit Secession?

Secession availability:

- raises political stakes to existential levels
- enables exit threats as negotiating leverage
- undermines commitment to working within the system
- historically led to the bloodiest conflict in American history

The prohibition forces political actors to work within the constitutional framework rather than threatening exit.

### Why Prohibit Nullification?

Nullification-the claimed right of states to void federal law-was:

- used to resist civil rights enforcement
- used to justify segregation
- fundamentally incompatible with constitutional supremacy
- a path to constitutional disintegration

Disputes about federal overreach must be resolved through courts, not unilateral state action.

### Why De-Escalation Rather Than Punishment?

Constitutional crises are dangerous precisely because they escalate. Punitive responses:

- create martyrs and grievances
- entrench resistance
- make restoration harder
- risk civil conflict

The de-escalation ladder prioritizes restoration of constitutional order, not punishment of violators. The goal is functional governance, not revenge.

### Why Dual Ratification?

The current Article V process:

- gives small states disproportionate power (3/4 of state legislatures)
- has no popular vote requirement
- allows amendments ratified against majority will

Dual ratification requires:

- geographic breadth (3/4 of Regions)
- popular support (majority in national referendum)

This prevents both small-state domination and large-state trampling of Regional interests.

### Why No Minimum Turnout?

Minimum turnout requirements:

- reward abstention as a veto strategy
- make amendment harder for obscure but important matters
- create perverse incentives to suppress turnout

The majority of those who vote is sufficient democratic legitimacy.

### Why Seven-Year Ratification Window?

Open-ended ratification creates:

- uncertainty about pending amendments
- possibility of ratification decades after proposal when conditions have changed
- constitutional instability

Seven years provides adequate time for deliberation while ensuring timeliness.

## De-Escalation Ladder: Summary

> **Note:** Detailed implementation procedures are in the [De-Escalation Procedures Act](../../proposals/01-foundations/de-escalation-procedures-act.md). This section provides an overview.

**Level 1: Judicial Enforcement** - Courts issue compliance orders with expedited review and contempt powers.

**Level 2: Administrative Remedies** - Fund withholding, penalties, and federal assumption of specific functions.

**Level 3: Temporary Intervention** - Federal personnel and Regional Guard forces (with two-key authorization) if necessary.

**Level 4: Restoration** - Immediate restoration of self-government upon compliance; no ongoing punishment.

The goal at every level is restoration, not domination.
