## ARTICLE X - FISCAL ARCHITECTURE

### Section 1. Independent Taxing Authority

Each level of government-federal, Regional, State, local-shall possess independent taxing authority sufficient to fulfill its enumerated responsibilities.

#### Regional Revenue Protection

(a) **Prohibition on Targeted Fiscal Nullification.** No State shall enact any law, credit, rebate, deduction, or exemption that:

(1) Specifically targets, offsets, or neutralizes Regional tax liabilities;

(2) Provides tax benefits conditioned on payment of Regional taxes;

(3) Creates priority schemes that systematically subordinate Regional tax collection to State collection;

(4) Offers location-based incentives designed to erode the Regional tax base within the State.

(b) **Rebuttable Presumption.** A State tax provision shall be presumed to violate subsection (a) if:

(1) It was enacted within twenty-four (24) months of a Regional tax increase or new Regional tax;

(2) Its fiscal impact falls disproportionately (greater than 75%) on Regional revenue rather than Federal or general State revenue;

(3) Legislative history or public statements by sponsors reference Regional tax policy.

(c) **Permitted State Tax Policy.** Nothing in this section shall prevent States from:

(1) Establishing general tax credits, deductions, or exemptions that apply regardless of Regional tax status;

(2) Setting State tax rates at any level, including zero;

(3) Competing for business through general economic development incentives not targeted at Regional tax avoidance.

#### Regional Tax Collection Priority

(d) **Concurrent Collection Authority.** Regions shall have independent authority to:

(1) Assess and collect Regional taxes directly from taxpayers without State intermediation;

(2) Establish Regional tax administration agencies with full enforcement powers;

(3) File liens, levy assets, and pursue collection remedies independently of State tax authorities.

(e) **Lien Parity.** Regional tax liens shall have equal priority with State tax liens:

(1) When Regional and State liens attach to the same property on the same date, they share pro rata;

(2) When liens attach on different dates, priority follows standard first-in-time rules regardless of governmental level;

(3) No State may establish categorical priority for State liens over Regional liens.

(f) **Anti-Subordination Clause.** No State bankruptcy, receivership, or fiscal emergency proceeding may subordinate Regional tax claims to State claims or general creditors.

---

### Section 2. No Unfunded Mandates

Mandates imposed on subordinate governments without adequate funding are unenforceable.

---

### Section 3. Equalization

Automatic, formula-based equalization transfers shall ensure baseline governing capacity across Regions.

#### National Benefits Spine Fiscal Alignment

(a) **Co-Payment Requirement.** For any program funded through the National Benefits Spine, the administering Region shall contribute a co-payment from Regional own-source revenue according to the following schedule:

(1) Regions with fiscal capacity above 110% of national median: 20% co-payment;

(2) Regions with fiscal capacity between 90-110% of national median: 15% co-payment;

(3) Regions with fiscal capacity below 90% of national median: 10% co-payment;

(4) Small Regions receiving equalization transfers under Section 3-A: 5% co-payment (minimum).

(b) **Effect on Incentives.** The co-payment requirement ensures that Regional governments bear marginal fiscal consequences for program expansion decisions, aligning authority over administration with responsibility for costs.

#### Efficiency-Indexed Federal Contributions

(c) **Outcome-Based Funding.** The federal government shall provide National Benefits Spine funding sufficient to achieve specified outcome floors at the National Median cost-per-outcome, adjusted for Regional Purchasing Power Parity.

(d) **Purchasing Power Parity Adjustment.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall annually calculate a Regional Cost Index reflecting differences in labor costs, real estate costs, and input prices across Regions. All efficiency comparisons shall use PPP-adjusted figures.

(e) **Funding Adjustment Based on Efficiency.**

(1) **Efficient Regions:** If a Region achieves outcome floors at below-median PPP-adjusted cost, the Region retains 50% of the savings as unrestricted Regional revenue;

(2) **Inefficient Regions:** If a Region exceeds median PPP-adjusted cost while achieving outcome floors, federal funding covers only the median cost; the Region must fund the excess from own-source revenue;

(3) **Underperforming Regions:** If a Region fails to achieve outcome floors regardless of spending, the Region enters Performance Improvement Status.

#### Subsidy-Neutrality Adjustment

(f) **Subsidy-Neutrality Adjustment.** Equalization formulas shall account for Regional tax expenditures:

(1) "Tax expenditures" include tax credits, exemptions, abatements, and other preferential treatments that reduce tax liability for specific industries or firms;

(2) Tax expenditures exceeding two percent (2%) of Regional GDP shall be added back to calculated tax capacity for equalization purposes;

(3) This adjustment treats the Region as if it had collected the forgone revenue.

(g) **Tax Expenditure Reporting.** Each Region shall report annually:

(1) All tax expenditures by category and amount;

(2) The industries or firms benefiting from each expenditure;

(3) The stated policy rationale for each expenditure.

(h) **IFC Verification.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall:

(1) Verify Regional tax expenditure reports;

(2) Apply the subsidy-neutrality adjustment to equalization calculations;

(3) Publish comparative tax expenditure analyses across Regions.

#### Predatory Subsidy Prohibition

(i) **Predatory Subsidy Prohibition.** Regions may not offer subsidies:

(1) Explicitly conditioned on relocation from another Region;

(2) Available only to firms relocating from specific other Regions;

(3) Structured to match or exceed subsidies offered by other Regions in bidding wars.

(j) **Relocation Subsidy Definition.** A subsidy is "conditioned on relocation" if:

(1) The subsidy agreement references the firm's current location;

(2) The subsidy is available only to firms not currently operating in the Region;

(3) The subsidy amount varies based on the firm's origin Region.

(k) **Total Subsidy Ceiling.** Regional tax expenditures and direct subsidies combined:

(1) May not exceed five percent (5%) of Regional GDP in any fiscal year;

(2) May not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of Regional tax revenue;

(3) The lower of the two limits applies.

---

### Section 3-A. Small Region Support

(a) Equalization transfers under Section 3 shall include a minimum floor for each Region, regardless of formula calculations, sufficient to fund:

- basic Regional administrative functions,
- Regional court operations,
- Regional Guard minimum readiness requirements,
- participation in inter-Regional coordination bodies.

(b) This floor shall be established by statute and may not be reduced below the level necessary to maintain functioning Regional governance.

(c) Small Regions may pool resources through inter-Regional agreements for:

- specialized court functions,
- technical expertise,
- infrastructure management,
- higher education coordination.

(d) Pooling agreements under this section require no federal approval and do not constitute merger.

(e) **Federal Institutional Capacity Support.** For any Region with population below two percent of the total population of the United States:

- (1) The federal government shall provide supplemental funding for Regional court operations, including judicial salaries, court facilities, and administrative staff, sufficient to ensure access to justice equivalent to that available in larger Regions;
- (2) The federal government shall provide technical assistance and shared personnel for specialized regulatory functions that require expertise not economically sustainable at small-region scale;
- (3) Regional Guard forces may be supplemented by federal reserve components under Regional Governor command for non-federalized operations, pursuant to agreement between the Region and the Department of Defense;
- (4) This support is an entitlement, not subject to annual appropriation discretion, and shall be funded through mandatory spending.

(f) **Mandatory Pooling for Critical Functions.** Regions with population below two percent of the total population shall enter into pooling agreements with at least one adjacent Region for:

- (1) appellate court operations (trial courts may remain independent),
- (2) specialized law enforcement functions (forensics, cybercrime),
- (3) emergency management coordination.

Such pooling shall preserve each Region's sovereignty and independent governance; pooled functions operate under joint authority with equal Regional representation regardless of population.

(g) For purposes of this section, a "Small Region" is one that meets either:

- (1) population below five percent of the total population of the United States, or
- (2) fiscal capacity below the median fiscal capacity of all Regions.

(h) Fiscal capacity shall be measured by the Independent Fiscal Council using a formula that accounts for tax base, cost of living, and geographic factors. The formula shall be established by statute and reviewed every ten years.

---

### Section 4. Anti-Coercion Rule

Conditional funding that effectively compels unrelated policy compliance is unconstitutional.

---

### Section 5. Independent Fiscal Council

(a) There is hereby established an Independent Fiscal Council (IFC) consisting of seven members appointed as follows:

- (1) two members appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate,
- (2) two members appointed by the Speaker of the House,
- (3) two members appointed by a majority vote of all Regional Governors, and
- (4) one member selected by unanimous agreement of the other six members, who shall serve as Chair.

(b) Members shall serve staggered seven-year terms and may be removed only for cause by a two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress.

(c) The Council shall:

- (3) determine Small Region qualification under Section 3-A(e),
- (4) advise Congress on fiscal federalism matters,
- (5) publish annual reports on the fiscal status of each Region and the effectiveness of equalization transfers.

(d) Council determinations under subsections (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) shall be final and not subject to political override, but may be challenged in federal court for procedural error or constitutional violation.

(e) The Council shall operate with full budgetary independence and shall receive automatic appropriations equal to 0.01% of equalization transfers or $50 million (indexed to inflation), whichever is greater.

#### Off-Balance-Sheet Debt Controls

(o) **Consolidated Fiscal Reporting.** For purposes of all debt limits, ceilings, and monitoring under this Article, "Regional debt" includes:

(1) All direct obligations of the Regional government;

(2) All obligations of any Regional authority, agency, corporation, or instrumentality created by or on behalf of the Region, regardless of formal legal separation;

(3) All revenue bonds issued by entities in which the Region has an ownership interest, exercises control, or for which Regional action was required for creation;

(4) All public-private partnership obligations where the Region bears contingent liability, guarantees revenue, or provides availability payments;

(5) All lease-purchase agreements, certificates of participation, and similar financing arrangements;

(6) The proportionate share of any multi-Regional financing entity's obligations based on the Region's participation.

(p) **Independent Infrastructure Authority Restrictions.**

(1) No Region may create or authorize the creation of an independent authority, corporation, or special district for the primary purpose of issuing debt that would not be included in Regional debt calculations;

(2) Any entity created by Regional action that issues debt exceeding $100 million shall be presumed to be a Regional instrumentality subject to consolidated reporting;

(3) The IFC may pierce the corporate form of any entity and attribute its debt to the creating Region if:

### Section 7. Financial Conservatorship

#### Systemic Risk Limits

(a) **Mandatory Fiscal Limits.**

(1) The Independent Fiscal Council shall establish and publish mandatory debt-to-GDP ratios for all Regions, not to exceed eighty percent of Regional GDP;

(2) Regional Development Banks shall maintain leverage ratios not exceeding those applicable to federally-chartered banks;

(3) Regions must submit annual fiscal sustainability reports to the IFC demonstrating compliance;

(4) The IFC may adjust ratios based on economic conditions but may not waive limits entirely.

#### Automatic Conservatorship

(b) **Financial Conservatorship Trigger.**

(1) Exceeding the debt-to-GDP ratio by ten percent or more triggers automatic "Financial Conservatorship" status;

(2) During Conservatorship, the IFC assumes authority over:

- (A) All new Regional borrowing and bond issuance;
- (B) Regional Development Bank operations and lending policies;
- (C) Budget approval for expenditures exceeding operational minimums;

(3) Conservatorship continues until the Region returns to compliance for two consecutive fiscal years;

(4) Regional officials may not incur new obligations without IFC approval during Conservatorship.

#### Anti-Extortion Provisions

(c) **Contagion Risk Limitation.**

(1) No Region may condition fiscal responsibility on federal policy concessions;

(2) Threats of "disorderly default" to extract transfers or exemptions constitute grounds for immediate Conservatorship;

(3) The IFC may pre-emptively impose Conservatorship upon finding evidence of deliberate over-leveraging for coercive purposes;

(4) Equalization transfers shall not be increased to remedy self-inflicted fiscal crises caused by deliberate over-borrowing.

#### Orderly Resolution

(d) **Structured Resolution.**

(1) If a Region in Conservatorship cannot achieve fiscal sustainability, the IFC may implement orderly resolution including:

- (A) Mandatory debt restructuring with haircuts distributed equitably among bondholders;
- (B) Temporary federal assumption of essential services;
- (C) Asset sales from Regional Development Banks;

(2) Resolution shall not include unlimited federal bailouts or transfer increases;

---

### Section 8. Administrative Receivership

(a) **Trigger Conditions.** If a Region's own-source revenue falls below forty percent (40%) of its total expenditures for three consecutive fiscal years, the Independent Fiscal Council shall declare that Region to be in a state of Administrative Receivership.

(b) **Receivership Powers.** During Administrative Receivership, the Independent Fiscal Council shall have authority to:

(1) Conduct comprehensive audits of Regional finances, including all revenue sources, expenditures, and obligations;

(2) Require the Region to submit quarterly fiscal reports in a form prescribed by the Council;

(3) Mandate specific revenue reforms, including but not limited to minimum tax rates, broadening of tax bases, elimination of fiscally irresponsible exemptions, and improved collection enforcement;

(4) Require the Region to submit a Fiscal Recovery Plan within one hundred eighty (180) days, subject to Council approval;

(5) Disapprove Regional budgets that the Council determines will perpetuate dependency; and

(6) Require the Region to engage independent fiscal advisors at Regional expense.

(c) **Limitations on Receivership Powers.** The Independent Fiscal Council may not:

(1) Reduce, condition, or otherwise affect the Region's representation in the Senate or any other legislative body;

(2) Reduce, condition, or otherwise affect the voting rights of the Region's citizens in federal elections;

(3) Assume direct control of Regional government operations beyond fiscal matters;

(4) Mandate specific spending cuts to particular programs (the Region retains discretion over expenditure priorities within approved budget levels); or

(5) Impose receivership for reasons other than the objective fiscal trigger in subsection (a).

(d) **Exit from Receivership.** Administrative Receivership terminates automatically when the Region's own-source revenue exceeds fifty percent (50%) of its total expenditures for two consecutive fiscal years.

(e) **Democratic Representation Preserved.** For the avoidance of doubt, a Region in Administrative Receivership retains full and equal representation in the Senate, full participation in all constitutional processes, and all rights of self-governance except as specifically limited by this section. Fiscal dependency shall never be grounds for reducing a Region's democratic voice in the Union.

---

### Section 9. Asymmetric Shock Stabilization

#### Automatic Cyclical Stabilizers

(a) **Asymmetric Shock Recognition.** The IFC shall monitor Regional economic divergence using a composite index including:

(1) Regional unemployment rate deviation from national average;

(2) Regional GDP growth deviation from national average;

(3) Regional inflation deviation from national average;

(4) Regional housing price deviation from national trend.

(b) **Automatic Stabilizer Trigger.** When any Region's composite index exceeds two (2) standard deviations from the national mean for two (2) consecutive quarters:

(1) The Region shall be designated as experiencing an "Asymmetric Cyclical Shock";

(2) Automatic stabilization transfers shall commence without requiring Congressional appropriation;

(3) Designation shall continue until the index returns to within 1.5 standard deviations for two (2) consecutive quarters.

#### Cyclical Stabilization Fund

(c) **Cyclical Stabilization Fund.**

(1) **Establishment.** A Cyclical Stabilization Fund shall be established, separate from the Fiscal Equalization Fund, dedicated exclusively to asymmetric shock response.

(2) **Capitalization.** The Fund shall be capitalized through:

- (A) A base contribution of 0.5% of national GDP annually during non-crisis periods;
- (B) Countercyclical contributions: Regions experiencing above-average growth contribute an additional 0.25% of Regional GDP;
- (C) Federal Reserve remittances during periods of monetary expansion.

(3) **Target Reserve.** The Fund shall maintain a target reserve of 3% of national GDP, with contributions suspended when target is exceeded.

(d) **Fund Disbursement.** Upon Asymmetric Shock designation:

(1) Automatic transfers commence within thirty (30) days;

(2) Transfer amounts are calculated by formula based on shock severity;

(3) No Congressional appropriation or executive action is required.

#### Regional Countercyclical Tools

(e) **Receding Region Countercyclical Tools.** Regions experiencing Asymmetric Cyclical Shocks (composite index below -2 SD) may:

(1) **Accelerated Depreciation:** Authorize accelerated depreciation schedules for business investment within the Region;

(2) **Payroll Tax Holiday:** Temporarily suspend Regional payroll tax contributions for up to twenty-four (24) months;

(2) Increase Regional reserve requirements for Regional Development Banks;

(3) Implement Regional property transfer taxes to moderate housing speculation;

(4) Establish Regional inflation stabilization reserves funded by surplus revenues.

---

### Section 10. Fiscal Intervention Hierarchy

The IFC fiscal intervention authorities established in this Article proceed in escalating stages. Each stage requires a finding that lesser interventions are insufficient before proceeding to more intensive measures.

(a) **Intervention Stages.**

(1) **Stage 1: Capacity-Based Equalization Adjustment.** The IFC may adjust equalization calculations under Section 3 to account for self-inflicted fiscal weakness, including:

- (A) Capacity-based calculations that treat forgone tax revenue as if collected (subsidy-neutrality adjustment);
- (B) Predatory subsidy prohibition enforcement;
- (C) Tax expenditure reporting requirements.

(2) **Stage 2: Negligence Finding and Clawback.** If capacity adjustment proves insufficient, the IFC may issue a negligence finding upon determining that Regional fiscal distress results from deliberate policy choices rather than external circumstances:

- (A) Strategic incompetence or deliberate under-collection triggers enhanced reporting;
- (B) Equalization transfers reduced to prevent subsidizing self-inflicted harm;
- (C) Clawback of prior transfers if premised on materially misleading fiscal reporting.

(3) **Stage 3: Solvency Certification Suspension.** If negligence finding proves insufficient:

- (A) The IFC may suspend the Region's solvency certification;
- (B) Suspended certification triggers market disclosure requirements;
- (C) Asset quality floors for Regional Development Banks may be imposed;
- (D) Contagion firewalls activated to protect other Regions.

(4) **Stage 4: Financial Conservatorship.** Only if Stages 1-3 prove insufficient may the IFC impose Financial Conservatorship under Section 7, assuming control over Regional borrowing and major fiscal decisions.

(5) **Stage 5: Administrative Receivership.** If the objective trigger in Section 8(a) is met, Administrative Receivership provides the most intensive intervention.

(b) **Escalation Documentation.** Before proceeding to a higher intervention stage, the IFC shall:

(1) Document why lesser interventions have proven insufficient;

(2) Provide the Region thirty (30) days notice and opportunity to respond;

(3) Issue a public finding justifying escalation.

(c) **De-escalation Path.** The IFC shall reduce intervention intensity when the Region demonstrates sustained compliance:

(1) Each stage requires two consecutive quarters of compliance before de-escalation;

(2) De-escalation proceeds one stage at a time;

(3) The Region may not be re-escalated for the same conduct within twelve (12) months of de-escalation.

---

### Section 11. Fiscal Subsidiarity Protection

#### Tax Base Preservation

(a) **Fiscal Subsidiarity Principle.** Regional and Federal taxation shall not collectively render States unable to fund their enumerated duties through reasonable local taxation.

(b) **IFC Tax Burden Certification.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall certify annually:

(1) The combined Federal-Regional-State effective tax rate for each major tax base (income, payroll, property, sales, corporate);

(2) The proportion of each tax base consumed by Federal and Regional taxation;

(3) Whether the remaining tax capacity is sufficient for States to fund enumerated duties.

(c) **Tax Capacity Floor.** States shall retain access to tax capacity sufficient to fund:

(1) K-12 education at the national average per-pupil expenditure;

(2) Local road maintenance at levels sufficient for public safety;

(3) Essential State administrative functions;

(4) The IFC shall calculate a "Minimum State Tax Capacity" for each State.

(d) **Crowding-Out Prohibition.** If Federal and Regional taxation would reduce State access below the Minimum State Tax Capacity:

(1) The IFC shall notify the offending level(s);

(2) The offending level shall reduce rates or provide compensating transfers within one hundred eighty (180) days;

(3) Failure to comply results in automatic transfer from the offending level to affected States.

---

### Section 11-A. Prohibition on Predatory Tax Exportation

(a) **Tax Exportation Defined.** Tax exportation occurs when the economic burden of a Regional or State tax, fee, or assessment falls primarily (greater than sixty percent) on persons or entities residing outside the taxing jurisdiction.

(b) **Tax Exportation Ceiling.** No Region may derive more than twenty-five percent (25%) of its total annual revenue from exported taxes. This ceiling applies to:

- (1) transit fees on inter-Regional energy, data, or transportation corridors;
- (2) severance taxes on resources where the primary consumption occurs outside the Region;
- (3) consumption or sales taxes specifically targeting industries or activities with primarily non-resident participation;
- (4) any other fiscal instrument where the Independent Fiscal Council (IFC) determines the ultimate economic incidence is shifted to non-residents.

(c) **Monopoly Rents Finding.** If a Region possesses a geographic or economic monopoly over a vital national utility (e.g., a primary deep-water port, a national fiber-optic hub, or a trans-continental energy corridor), the IFC shall:

- (1) establish a "Neutral Service Rate" for that utility based on cost-plus-reasonable-margin;
- (2) any revenue collected above this rate shall be deemed "Monopoly Rent" and credited against the Region's equalization transfers.

(d) **Enforcement and Remediation.** If a Region exceeds the Tax Exportation Ceiling:

- (1) the excess revenue shall be placed in an escrow fund administered by the IFC;
- (2) the fund shall be redistributed as "Exportation Rebates" to the Regions whose residents bore the economic burden;
- (3) persistent violations (three consecutive years) shall result in the IFC assuming authority over the Region's tax-rate setting for the offending categories.

(e) **Incidence Determination.** The IFC shall determine economic incidence using standard public finance methodology, considering price elasticities, market structure, and pass-through rates. The IFC's incidence determination is subject to methodological challenge under Article II, Section 7-A(f).

---

### Section 12. Democratic Accountability for Fiscal Institutions

#### Political Override for Systemic Disputes

(a) **Legitimacy Review Trigger.** If three or more Regions formally declare non-compliance with IFC or ARB determinations within a twelve-month period:

(1) The declarations shall automatically trigger a "Legitimacy Review" requiring Congress to:

- (i) hold public hearings within sixty (60) days on the disputed determinations;
- (ii) vote within one hundred twenty (120) days on whether to affirm, modify, or vacate the disputed determinations;
- (iii) consider structural reforms to the IFC or ARB.

(2) During Legitimacy Review:

- (i) enforcement of disputed determinations is stayed;
- (ii) affected Regions remain subject to baseline constitutional requirements (debt ceilings, no-bailout rule);
- (iii) the IFC and ARB shall participate in hearings and defend their determinations publicly.

(b) **Periodic Reauthorization.** The statutory authorities of the IFC and ARB shall sunset every twelve (12) years unless reauthorized by Congress. Reauthorization shall include:

(1) review of institutional performance;

(2) opportunity for structural reforms;

(3) public comment period.

(c) **Regional Representation in Determinations.** No determination materially adverse to a Region may be made by a panel where no member was appointed by Regional Governors. If such a panel composition occurs due to vacancies or recusals, the determination shall require unanimous agreement of remaining members.

#### Transparency Requirements

(d) **Public Accountability.** The IFC and ARB shall:

(1) publish all deliberations and vote records;

(2) issue plain-language explanations of determinations accessible to non-experts;

(3) maintain public dashboards showing Regional fiscal status and pending matters;

(4) hold annual public meetings in each Region.

#### Non-Compliance Response Ladder

(e) **Graduated Enforcement.** Before any coercive enforcement against a non-compliant Region:

(1) **Stage 1 - Explanation:** The IFC/ARB shall issue a formal explanation and offer technical assistance (30 days);

(2) **Stage 2 - Mediation:** Mediation by a panel including Regional Governor representatives (60 days);

(3) **Stage 3 - Congressional Review:** Congressional review and vote on whether enforcement is appropriate (90 days);

(4) **Stage 4 - Enforcement:** Only after Congressional authorization may coercive measures (conservatorship, receivership) proceed.

(f) **Emergency Exception.** Subsection (e) does not apply when:

(1) the Region's actions pose imminent risk of contagion to other Regions' fiscal stability;

(2) the Region has deliberately structured transactions to evade constitutional limits;

(3) certified by the Chief Justice as requiring immediate intervention.

---

### Section 13. Prohibition on Shadow Currencies and Quasi-Monetary Instruments

(a) **Federal Monetary Exclusivity.** The federal government's exclusive authority over "currency and monetary policy" under Article II, Section 1 includes exclusive authority over all instruments that function as money, regardless of their formal designation.

(b) **Prohibited Regional Instruments.** No Region or State may issue, authorize, or permit the circulation of:

- (1) "Regional credits," "energy credits," "tax-anticipation tokens," or similar instruments that are transferable and accepted for payment of taxes, fees, or utility charges;
- (2) digital tokens, blockchain-based currencies, or other electronic instruments that function as a medium of exchange within Regional commerce;
- (3) scrip, vouchers, or certificates that are designed to circulate as a substitute for federal currency;
- (4) any instrument that, regardless of its formal designation, functions as a store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account within the Regional economy.

(c) **Functional Test.** An instrument shall be deemed a prohibited quasi-currency if it meets any two of the following criteria:

- (1) it is accepted for payment of Regional or State taxes, fees, or charges;
- (2) it is traded on secondary markets or exchanges;
- (3) its aggregate value in circulation exceeds $100 million;
- (4) it is used by more than 10,000 distinct parties in commercial transactions within a twelve-month period;
- (5) it is marketed or promoted as an alternative to federal currency.

(d) **Permitted Instruments.** This section does not prohibit:

- (1) conventional tax credits, rebates, or refunds denominated in dollars;
- (2) non-transferable benefit vouchers (e.g., food assistance, housing vouchers);
- (3) loyalty programs, gift cards, or promotional credits limited to specific vendors;
- (4) Regional bonds, notes, or other debt instruments that are not designed to circulate as currency;
- (5) public utility rate credits applied to specific customer accounts.

(e) **IFC Monitoring.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall:

- (1) monitor Regional fiscal instruments for compliance with this section;
- (2) issue advisory opinions on whether proposed instruments would violate this section;
- (3) refer suspected violations to the Department of Justice for enforcement.

(f) **Enforcement.** Issuance of a prohibited quasi-currency shall result in:

- (1) immediate injunction by federal court;
- (2) mandatory redemption of all outstanding instruments at face value in federal currency;
- (3) civil penalties of up to $10 million per day of continued circulation;
- (4) personal liability for Regional officials who authorized the issuance.

(g) **Federal Reserve Coordination.** The Federal Reserve shall have authority to:

- (1) determine whether an instrument constitutes a prohibited quasi-currency;
- (2) require reporting from Regions on fiscal instruments that approach the thresholds in subsection (c);
- (3) issue cease-and-desist orders for instruments that threaten monetary policy effectiveness.

### Section 14. Fiscal Adequacy Determinations

(a) **Definition of Adequate Funding.** A mandate is adequately funded when the resources provided are reasonably sufficient to achieve substantial compliance with the mandate's requirements without requiring the subordinate government to:

- (1) reduce existing services below minimum standards established by law;
- (2) impose taxes or fees exceeding one hundred ten percent of the regional median for comparable jurisdictions; or
- (3) defer essential infrastructure maintenance or capital replacement.

(b) **Fiscal Adequacy Review Board.** The Inter-Regional Fiscal Court shall establish a Fiscal Adequacy Review Board ("FARB") consisting of:

- (1) three economists appointed by the IFC for staggered six-year terms;
- (2) two former State or Regional budget directors appointed by the Council of Governors; and
- (3) two representatives of municipal governments appointed by the National League of Cities.

(c) **Pre-Enactment Fiscal Adequacy Certification.** Before any Federal or Regional mandate takes effect:

- (1) the enacting authority shall submit a Fiscal Adequacy Statement to the FARB estimating compliance costs and identifying funding sources;
- (2) the FARB shall issue a Fiscal Adequacy Determination within sixty days certifying whether proposed funding is adequate;
- (3) if the FARB certifies funding as inadequate, the mandate shall not take effect until funding is increased to adequate levels or the enacting authority demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the FARB's determination was erroneous.

(d) **Post-Enactment Adequacy Challenges.** Any subordinate government subject to a mandate may petition the FARB for a determination that funding has become inadequate due to:

- (1) increased compliance costs exceeding original estimates by more than twenty percent;
- (2) inflation or economic changes materially affecting compliance costs;
- (3) unforeseen implementation requirements; or
- (4) cumulative burden of multiple mandates affecting the same revenue sources.

(e) **Remedies for Inadequate Funding.** Upon determination that a mandate is inadequately funded:

- (1) the subordinate government may suspend compliance with the underfunded portions until adequate funding is provided;
- (2) the enacting authority shall have one hundred eighty days to cure the funding deficiency;
- (3) if not cured, the mandate becomes unenforceable against the petitioning government;
- (4) no penalty, sanction, or loss of other funding may be imposed for non-compliance with an inadequately funded mandate.

(f) **Anti-Circumvention.** No enacting authority may:

- (1) condition unrelated funding on compliance with inadequately funded mandates;
- (2) impose mandates through guidance, interpretation, or enforcement discretion to avoid fiscal adequacy review;
- (3) fragment mandates into smaller components to avoid cumulative burden analysis.

### Section 15. Pre-Ratification Legacy Liabilities

(a) **Legacy Liability Defined.** A "Legacy Liability" is a fiscal or environmental obligation incurred prior to the ratification of this Constitution, specifically including:

- (1) unfunded pension obligations for state and local employees accrued before ratification;
- (2) remediation costs for pre-existing toxic waste or "Superfund" sites designated before ratification;
- (3) decommissioning costs for aging nuclear or industrial facilities constructed before ratification;
- (4) infrastructure debt and deferred maintenance obligations incurred before ratification.

(b) **National Legacy Trust.** There is hereby established a National Legacy Trust ("NLT"), managed by the IFC, to assist Regions burdened by disproportionate industrial or administrative history:

(b-1) **Legacy Burden Factor.** The IFC shall include a "Legacy Burden Factor" in the equalization formula, ensuring that Regions with older infrastructure, higher pension loads, and greater environmental remediation obligations are not fiscally penalized relative to Regions without such historical burdens. The Factor shall be calculated based on:

- (1) per-capita unfunded pension obligations attributable to pre-ratification service;
- (2) per-capita environmental remediation costs for pre-ratification contamination;
- (3) per-capita deferred maintenance on infrastructure constructed before ratification;
- (4) other quantifiable legacy burdens as determined by the IFC.

(b-2) **Federal Backstop for Catastrophic Legacy Harms.** For legacy harms that exceed a Region's fiscal capacity (defined as remediation costs exceeding five percent of Regional GDP), the NLT shall provide direct grants funded by:

- (1) a 0.05% national corporate carbon fee on emissions exceeding sector baselines;
- (2) a 0.05% financial transaction fee on securities trades exceeding $1 million in daily volume;
- (3) appropriations as Congress may provide.

(b-3) **Trust Administration.** The NLT shall:

- (1) receive applications from Regions documenting legacy liabilities;
- (2) verify claims through independent audit;
- (3) prioritize funding based on fiscal impact and public health urgency;
- (4) publish annual reports on legacy liability status nationwide.

(c) **Legacy Liability Sunset.** The Legacy Burden Factor shall be recalculated every ten years and shall phase out over fifty (50) years following ratification:

- (1) the Factor shall remain at full value for the first ten years following ratification;
- (2) beginning in year eleven, the Factor shall decline by two percent (2%) of its initial value annually;
- (3) by year sixty following ratification, the Legacy Burden Factor shall be zero;
- (4) this sunset ensures that legacy equity adjustments address historical burdens without creating permanent entitlements.

(d) **Anti-Manipulation.** No Region may:

- (1) incur new obligations and retroactively classify them as "legacy" liabilities;
- (2) defer maintenance or remediation to increase legacy burden claims;
- (3) manipulate pension assumptions to inflate unfunded liability calculations.
Violations shall result in forfeiture of NLT assistance and clawback of prior disbursements.

## Design Rationale

### Why Independent Taxing Authority?

Fiscal dependence creates political dependence. If Regions rely on federal transfers for basic operations:

- federal government gains coercive leverage
- Regional policy independence becomes illusory
- political accountability becomes confused

Independent taxing authority ensures each level can fund its constitutional responsibilities without permission from other levels.

### Why Prohibit Unfunded Mandates?

Unfunded mandates allow higher levels of government to:

- impose costs on lower levels without political accountability
- claim credit for programs while shifting blame for funding
- effectively expand their power beyond enumerated limits

The prohibition makes the mandating government internalize costs, creating political accountability for its decisions.

### Why Equalization Transfers?

Without equalization, poorer Regions cannot provide basic governmental services:

- courts, elections, emergency services require minimum scale
- extreme inequality undermines national cohesion
- citizens in poor Regions become second-class

Equalization ensures baseline capacity everywhere while preserving fiscal independence for expenditures above the floor.

### Why Formula-Based Rather Than Discretionary?

Discretionary transfers become:

- political patronage tools
- subject to partisan manipulation
- unpredictable for recipient planning

Formula-based transfers create predictability, remove political discretion, and ensure equal treatment of similarly situated Regions.

### Why the Anti-Coercion Rule?

Conditional funding has been used to:

- compel states to adopt federal policies (drinking age, speed limits)
- expand federal authority beyond enumerated powers
- create effective federal control over nominally state functions

The anti-coercion rule prevents conditional funding from becoming a back door to unconstitutional federal expansion.

## Implementation Guidance

### Fiscal Equalization Act Requirements

Congress shall enact a Fiscal Equalization Act establishing:

**Formula Components:**

- measure of Regional fiscal capacity (tax base relative to costs)
- measure of Regional fiscal need (population, geography, service costs)
- equalization target (e.g., bring all Regions to median fiscal capacity)

**Process Requirements:**

- annual calculation by Independent Fiscal Council
- automatic appropriation (mandatory spending)
- formula revision only by supermajority vote

**Accountability:**

- annual reporting on transfers and Regional fiscal status
- auditing by Government Accountability Office
- five-year review cycle for formula adequacy

### Default Rule (Article XXI)

If Congress fails to enact the Fiscal Equalization Act within three years of ratification:

- equalization transfers shall be calculated as flat per-capita grants
- baseline level: five percent of federal revenues
- distributed to Regions with below-median fiscal capacity
- rate declines by one percentage point per year beginning in year six
- floor of two percent to incentivize congressional action
