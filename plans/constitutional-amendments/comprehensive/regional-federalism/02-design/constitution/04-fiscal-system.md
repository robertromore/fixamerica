## ARTICLE X - FISCAL ARCHITECTURE

### Section 1. Independent Taxing Authority

Each level of government-federal, Regional, State, local-shall possess independent taxing authority sufficient to fulfill its enumerated responsibilities.

#### Regional Revenue Protection

(a) **Prohibition on Targeted Fiscal Nullification.** No State shall enact any law, credit, rebate, deduction, or exemption that:

(1) Specifically targets, offsets, or neutralizes Regional tax liabilities;

(2) Provides tax benefits conditioned on payment of Regional taxes;

(3) Creates priority schemes that systematically subordinate Regional tax collection to State collection;

(4) Offers location-based incentives designed to erode the Regional tax base within the State.

(b) **Rebuttable Presumption.** A State tax provision shall be presumed to violate subsection (a) if:

(1) It was enacted within twenty-four (24) months of a Regional tax increase or new Regional tax;

(2) Its fiscal impact falls disproportionately (greater than 75%) on Regional revenue rather than Federal or general State revenue;

(3) Legislative history or public statements by sponsors reference Regional tax policy.

(c) **Permitted State Tax Policy.** Nothing in this section shall prevent States from:

(1) Establishing general tax credits, deductions, or exemptions that apply regardless of Regional tax status;

(2) Setting State tax rates at any level, including zero;

(3) Competing for business through general economic development incentives not targeted at Regional tax avoidance.

#### Regional Tax Collection Priority

(d) **Concurrent Collection Authority.** Regions shall have independent authority to:

(1) Assess and collect Regional taxes directly from taxpayers without State intermediation;

(2) Establish Regional tax administration agencies with full enforcement powers;

(3) File liens, levy assets, and pursue collection remedies independently of State tax authorities.

(e) **Lien Parity.** Regional tax liens shall have equal priority with State tax liens:

(1) When Regional and State liens attach to the same property on the same date, they share pro rata;

(2) When liens attach on different dates, priority follows standard first-in-time rules regardless of governmental level;

(3) No State may establish categorical priority for State liens over Regional liens.

(f) **Anti-Subordination Clause.** No State bankruptcy, receivership, or fiscal emergency proceeding may subordinate Regional tax claims to State claims or general creditors.

---

### Section 2. No Unfunded Mandates

Mandates imposed on subordinate governments without adequate funding are unenforceable.

---

### Section 3. Equalization

Automatic, formula-based equalization transfers shall ensure baseline governing capacity across Regions.

#### National Benefits Spine Fiscal Alignment

(a) **Co-Payment Requirement.** For any program funded through the National Benefits Spine, the administering Region shall contribute a co-payment from Regional own-source revenue according to the following schedule:

(1) Regions with fiscal capacity above 110% of national median: 20% co-payment;

(2) Regions with fiscal capacity between 90-110% of national median: 15% co-payment;

(3) Regions with fiscal capacity below 90% of national median: 10% co-payment;

(4) Small Regions receiving equalization transfers under Section 3-A: 5% co-payment (minimum).

(b) **Effect on Incentives.** The co-payment requirement ensures that Regional governments bear marginal fiscal consequences for program expansion decisions, aligning authority over administration with responsibility for costs.

#### Efficiency-Indexed Federal Contributions

(c) **Outcome-Based Funding.** The federal government shall provide National Benefits Spine funding sufficient to achieve specified outcome floors at the National Median cost-per-outcome, adjusted for Regional Purchasing Power Parity.

(d) **Purchasing Power Parity Adjustment.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall annually calculate a Regional Cost Index reflecting differences in labor costs, real estate costs, and input prices across Regions. All efficiency comparisons shall use PPP-adjusted figures.

(e) **Funding Adjustment Based on Efficiency.**

(1) **Efficient Regions:** If a Region achieves outcome floors at below-median PPP-adjusted cost, the Region retains 50% of the savings as unrestricted Regional revenue;

(2) **Inefficient Regions:** If a Region exceeds median PPP-adjusted cost while achieving outcome floors, federal funding covers only the median cost; the Region must fund the excess from own-source revenue;

(3) **Underperforming Regions:** If a Region fails to achieve outcome floors regardless of spending, the Region enters Performance Improvement Status.

(4) **Performance Improvement Status.** A Region in Performance Improvement Status under paragraph (3):

(A) shall submit to enhanced IFC monitoring and technical assistance;

(B) shall develop a corrective action plan within ninety (90) days identifying root causes and remediation steps;

(C) shall achieve outcome floors within twenty-four (24) months;

(D) if improvement is not achieved within the twenty-four (24) month period, the Region shall enter Program-Specific Performance Receivership for the affected program category. Under Program-Specific Performance Receivership, the IFC may: assume direct operational authority over the affected program; mandate minimum Regional budget allocations for the affected program; require program-specific revenue enhancements or expenditure reforms; and contract directly with service providers, bypassing Regional administration. Program-Specific Performance Receivership under this paragraph is distinct from Administrative Receivership under Section 8. A Region may be in Program-Specific Performance Receivership for one or more NBS categories while retaining fiscal autonomy in other domains. If a Region is in Program-Specific Performance Receivership for three or more NBS categories simultaneously, or if such receivership continues for more than four years, this shall constitute evidence of systemic incapacity for purposes of Section 8.

(E) **Partial Savings Suspension.** A Region in Performance Improvement Status for a program category shall be ineligible to retain efficiency savings under paragraph (1) for that category, but may retain savings for other categories where outcome floors are met across all demographic strata under Section 3-B.

(5) **Co-Payment Integrity.** Co-payments under subsection (a) must be paid from Regional general revenue. The following sources may not be used:

(A) dedicated federal transfers, including any federal grant or transfer with conditions or reporting requirements specific to the program category, any federal funds received pursuant to federal law establishing National Benefits Spine programs, and any equalization transfer calculated under Section 3, Section 3-A, or Section 9;

(B) pass-through of federal equalization funds;

(C) borrowing against future federal allocations;

(D) accounting maneuvers that shift other Regional expenses to federal categories.

The Independent Fiscal Council shall verify co-payment compliance annually, conduct random forensic audits of at least twenty percent (20%) of Regional outcome claims annually including direct verification of service delivery, and may refer suspected violations to the Allocation Review Board. Regions found to have materially misrepresented outcome data shall forfeit all efficiency savings retained under paragraph (1) for the fiscal year in question, repay federal funding calculated on the basis of fraudulent data, and enter Performance Improvement Status for the affected program category.

#### Subsidy-Neutrality Adjustment

(f) **Subsidy-Neutrality Adjustment.** Equalization formulas shall account for Regional tax expenditures:

(1) "Tax expenditures" include tax credits, exemptions, abatements, and other preferential treatments that reduce tax liability for specific industries or firms;

(2) Tax expenditures exceeding two percent (2%) of Regional GDP shall be added back to calculated tax capacity for equalization purposes;

(3) This adjustment treats the Region as if it had collected the forgone revenue.

(g) **Tax Expenditure Reporting.** Each Region shall report annually:

(1) All tax expenditures by category and amount;

(2) The industries or firms benefiting from each expenditure;

(3) The stated policy rationale for each expenditure.

(h) **IFC Verification.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall:

(1) Verify Regional tax expenditure reports;

(2) Apply the subsidy-neutrality adjustment to equalization calculations;

(3) Publish comparative tax expenditure analyses across Regions.

#### Predatory Subsidy Prohibition

(i) **Predatory Subsidy Prohibition.** Regions may not offer subsidies:

(1) Explicitly conditioned on relocation from another Region;

(2) Available only to firms relocating from specific other Regions;

(3) Structured to match or exceed subsidies offered by other Regions in bidding wars.

(j) **Relocation Subsidy Definition.** A subsidy is "conditioned on relocation" if:

(1) The subsidy agreement references the firm's current location;

(2) The subsidy is available only to firms not currently operating in the Region;

(3) The subsidy amount varies based on the firm's origin Region.

(k) **Total Subsidy Ceiling.** Regional tax expenditures and direct subsidies combined:

(1) May not exceed five percent (5%) of Regional GDP in any fiscal year;

(2) May not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of Regional tax revenue;

(3) The lower of the two limits applies.

#### Tax Effort and Anti-Haven Standards

(l) **Minimum Tax Effort Requirement.** To receive equalization transfers under this Section beyond the minimum floor established by Section 3-A, a Region must demonstrate minimum tax effort, defined as:

(1) Regional tax revenue collection equal to at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the national average Regional tax revenue per capita; OR

(2) Regional tax rates that, if applied to the national average tax base, would generate at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the national average Regional tax revenue per capita.

The Independent Fiscal Council shall certify annually whether each Region meets this threshold.

(m) **Phantom Revenue Adjustment.** For Regions that fail to meet the minimum tax effort threshold under subsection (l):

(1) equalization entitlement shall be calculated as if the Region collected revenue at the minimum tax effort threshold;

(2) the difference between actual collection and the minimum threshold ("phantom revenue") shall be subtracted from equalization transfers;

(3) phantom revenue calculations shall be net of any tax expenditure add-backs already applied under subsection (f) of this Section, to prevent double-counting;

(4) the IFC shall publish phantom revenue calculations for all Regions annually.

(n) **Genuine Low Capacity Exception.** The minimum tax effort requirement under subsection (l) does not apply to a Region that demonstrates:

(1) tax rates at or above the national average for each major tax category; AND

(2) below-average revenue attributable to a genuinely lower tax base, including fewer high-income residents, less corporate activity, or lower property values;

(3) not attributable to tax policy choices designed to attract tax-avoiding residents or entities.

The IFC shall certify whether a Region qualifies for this exception. IFC certification is subject to judicial review for abuse of discretion.

(o) **Anti-Haven Fiscal Consequence.** A Region that maintains tax rates more than fifty percent (50%) below the national average for any major tax category (income, corporate, property, or sales) shall be:

(1) deemed to have fiscal capacity equal to the national average for equalization purposes, regardless of actual revenue;

(2) ineligible for the Genuine Low Capacity Exception under subsection (n);

(3) subject to enhanced phantom revenue calculation using one hundred percent (100%) of the national average (rather than seventy-five percent (75%)) as the threshold.

No Region may provide special tax exemptions or incentives available only to new residents or entities relocating from other Regions, or establish tax-free zones that function primarily as havens for avoiding other Regions' taxation. *[See also subsection (i) Predatory Subsidy Prohibition.]*

(p) **Section 3-A Floor Preservation.** Notwithstanding subsections (l) through (o), the minimum equalization floor under Section 3-A shall not be reduced below the level required to fund basic Regional governance functions. Phantom revenue adjustments may reduce equalization transfers above the Section 3-A floor but may not reduce transfers below it.

(q) **Residence and Domicile Standards.** For purposes of Regional taxation:

(1) physical presence within a Region for more than one hundred eighty-three (183) days per calendar year establishes a presumption of tax residence in that Region;

(2) income earned through work performed within a Region is taxable by that Region regardless of the taxpayer's nominal residence;

(3) Regions shall cooperate in the sharing of taxpayer information to prevent residence arbitrage, subject to privacy protections established by statute.

(r) **Corporate Tax Apportionment.** Corporate tax liability shall be apportioned among Regions based on:

(1) the proportion of sales to customers in each Region;

(2) the proportion of employees and payroll in each Region;

(3) the proportion of property and assets in each Region;

using a formula established by Interstate Compact. Nominal headquarters location alone does not determine tax liability. In the absence of such a Compact, the Independent Fiscal Council shall promulgate a default apportionment formula based on sales, payroll, and property factors.

(s) **Congressional Equalization Adjustment Authority.** If interstate tax competition undermines the viability of the equalization system under this Section, Congress may by law adjust the equalization formula to account for competitive distortions. Congress may not, under this subsection, establish minimum tax rates for Regional taxation.

*[See Gap 193.]*

#### Predatory Subsidy Enforcement

*Resolves Gap 93 — The "Race to the Bottom" Regional Tax/Subsidy Competition.*

(t) **Relocation Subsidy Disclosure.**

(1) When a firm relocates between Regions, and cumulative subsidies provided to that firm by the receiving Region or any governmental subdivision thereof exceed a materiality threshold established by the Independent Fiscal Council — which threshold shall not be less than ten million dollars ($10,000,000) or one-hundredth of one percent (0.01%) of Regional GDP, whichever is less — the receiving Region shall disclose to the IFC all subsidies, tax expenditures, and non-tax incentives provided to that firm within sixty (60) days of the relocation event.

(2) For purposes of this subsection:

- (A) "Relocation" means the transfer of more than thirty percent (30%) of a firm's operational capacity or workforce between Regions within any thirty-six (36) month period, regardless of corporate restructuring, subsidiary formation, or change in entity name or structure;

- (B) "Subsidy" includes tax expenditures, direct financial assistance, in-kind infrastructure provided at below-market value, land grants at below-market value, targeted workforce training grants not available to all firms within the same sector, and regulatory waivers conferring quantifiable financial benefit;

- (C) Subsidies provided by any local government, municipality, county, or other governmental subdivision within a Region shall be attributed to the Region for purposes of disclosure under this subsection, the ceiling under subsection (k), and predation analysis under subsection (u).

(3) Failure to disclose subsidies as required by this subsection creates a rebuttable presumption that the undisclosed subsidies are predatory under subsection (i).

(u) **Predation Petition and Investigation.**

(1) Any Region that has lost a significant employer to another Region's subsidies, or the Independent Fiscal Council acting on its own initiative upon detecting a pattern of predatory subsidy activity, may petition the Allocation Review Board for a predation finding under subsection (i).

(2) Upon receipt of a petition, the IFC shall conduct an investigation and prepare a factual report, including:

- (A) the subsidies provided and their relationship to the relocation;
- (B) whether the subsidies are conditioned on relocation under subsection (j);
- (C) whether the subsidies exceed the firm's capital investment in the receiving Region;
- (D) whether the subsidies are part of a documented bidding war pattern.

(3) The IFC shall transmit its report to the ARB within one hundred twenty (120) days. The ARB shall conduct an expedited hearing and issue a determination within ninety (90) days of receiving the report.

(4) Subsidies exceeding the relocating firm's capital investment in the receiving Region are presumptively predatory. This presumption is rebuttable by clear and convincing evidence that the subsidies serve a legitimate economic development purpose unrelated to the firm's departure from another Region.

(v) **Predation Finding Consequences.**

(1) Upon an ARB finding of predatory subsidy under subsection (u), the predating Region's equalization eligibility shall be reduced by the amount of the predatory subsidy for a period of three (3) years from the date of the finding.

(2) The predating Region shall compensate the losing Region for documented transition costs, including unemployment expenditures, tax base losses, and infrastructure stranding costs, as determined by the IFC.

(3) The equalization deduction under paragraph (1) is in addition to any subsidy-neutrality adjustment applied under subsection (f), but the total annual deduction from a Region's equalization eligibility arising from a single predation finding — including both the subsidy-neutrality adjustment and the penalty deduction — shall not exceed two hundred percent (200%) of the predatory subsidy's annualized value.

(4) No provision of this subsection requires repayment by the firm receiving the predatory subsidy. Congress may by statute establish clawback procedures applicable to firms participating in predatory subsidy schemes.

(w) **Subsidy Ceiling Enforcement.**

(1) If a Region exceeds the subsidy ceiling established by subsection (k), the excess amount shall be placed in an escrow fund administered by the Independent Fiscal Council.

(2) The IFC shall redistribute escrowed funds to Regions that meet the minimum tax effort requirements under subsection (l), in proportion to their compliance with the equalization framework.

(3) New subsidy programs by the exceeding Region are prohibited until the Region demonstrates compliance with subsection (k) for two (2) consecutive fiscal years.

(4) If a Region exceeds the ceiling during a certified economic emergency, the IFC may grant a temporary exception not exceeding two (2) fiscal years. The IFC is the sole certifying authority for economic emergencies under this paragraph; no other federal, Regional, or State official may certify an economic emergency for purposes of this subsection. Emergency certification requires a finding that:

- (A) the Region faces an economic contraction exceeding five percent (5%) of Regional GDP within a single fiscal year, or a natural disaster causing documented economic disruption; and
- (B) the excess subsidies are directly related to emergency economic stabilization and are not available only to relocating firms.

(5) Escrow and redistribution under this subsection constitutes the equalization adjustment for ceiling violations; no separate equalization deduction is imposed in addition to the escrowed amount for the same excess.

### Section 3-A. Small Region Support

(a) Equalization transfers under Section 3 shall include a minimum floor for each Region, regardless of formula calculations, sufficient to fund:

- basic Regional administrative functions,
- Regional court operations,
- Regional Guard minimum readiness requirements,
- participation in inter-Regional coordination bodies.

(b) This floor shall be established by statute and may not be reduced below the level necessary to maintain functioning Regional governance.

(c) Small Regions may pool resources through inter-Regional agreements for:

- specialized court functions,
- technical expertise,
- infrastructure management,
- higher education coordination.

(d) Pooling agreements under this section require no federal approval and do not constitute merger.

(e) **Federal Institutional Capacity Support.** For any Region with population below two percent of the total population of the United States:

- (1) The federal government shall provide supplemental funding for Regional court operations, including judicial salaries, court facilities, and administrative staff, sufficient to ensure access to justice equivalent to that available in larger Regions;
- (2) The federal government shall provide technical assistance and shared personnel for specialized regulatory functions that require expertise not economically sustainable at small-region scale;
- (3) Regional Guard forces may be supplemented by federal reserve components under Regional Governor command for non-federalized operations, pursuant to agreement between the Region and the Department of Defense;
- (4) This support is an entitlement, not subject to annual appropriation discretion, and shall be funded through mandatory spending.

(f) **Mandatory Pooling for Critical Functions.** Regions with population below two percent of the total population shall enter into pooling agreements with at least one adjacent Region for:

- (1) appellate court operations (trial courts may remain independent),
- (2) specialized law enforcement functions (forensics, cybercrime),
- (3) emergency management coordination.

Such pooling shall preserve each Region's sovereignty and independent governance; pooled functions operate under joint authority with equal Regional representation regardless of population.

(g) For purposes of this section, a "Small Region" is one that meets either:

- (1) population below five percent of the total population of the United States, or
- (2) fiscal capacity below the median fiscal capacity of all Regions.

(h) Fiscal capacity shall be measured by the Independent Fiscal Council using a formula that accounts for tax base (including non-human economic output as defined in Section 21), cost of living, and geographic factors. The formula shall be established by statute and reviewed every ten years.

### Section 3-B. Anti-Creaming Protections

*[Resolves Gap 52 — National Benefits Spine Fiscal Blame Loop, Part 3. Prevents Regions from achieving favorable cost-per-outcome metrics by concentrating resources on easy-to-serve populations while neglecting the most vulnerable.]*

(a) **Stratified Outcome Requirements.** Outcome floors for National Benefits Spine programs shall be measured across demographic strata, not merely in aggregate. A Region may not be deemed to have achieved outcome floors unless targets are met in each of the following categories:

(1) Age cohorts: children (ages 0-17), working-age adults (ages 18-64), and seniors (ages 65 and older);

(2) Disability status: persons with disabilities and persons without disabilities;

(3) Severity of need: persons in deep poverty or acute need versus persons near threshold;

(4) Geographic distribution: urban, suburban, and rural populations within the Region.

(b) **Savings Release Contingent on Stratified Performance.** A Region may not retain efficiency savings under Section 3(e)(1) unless:

(1) Outcome floors are met across all demographic strata under subsection (a); and

(2) The Region demonstrates that per-capita expenditure for each stratum is not less than eighty percent (80%) of the national median per-capita expenditure for that stratum, adjusted for Regional Purchasing Power Parity under Section 3(d).

(c) **IFC Methodology.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall develop and publish methodologies for measuring stratified outcomes, including:

(1) standardized definitions for each demographic stratum, using the most granular demographic definitions for which statistically valid measurement is feasible and presuming inclusion of borderline populations in higher-need strata;

(2) minimum sample sizes for statistical validity;

(3) adjustment factors for Regions with atypical demographic compositions.

Such methodologies shall be subject to notice-and-comment rulemaking and shall be reviewable in federal court under arbitrary and capricious standards. The IFC shall publish an annual report demonstrating that outcome stratification prevents concentration of resources on easy-to-serve populations. Methodologies shall be reviewed every five (5) years, and any Region may petition for review if systematic underperformance in a subpopulation is statistically demonstrated.

(d) **Small Population Strata.** For demographic strata with fewer than five hundred (500) individuals in a Region:

(1) The IFC shall use rolling three-year averages to achieve adequate sample sizes;

(2) If three-year rolling data remains insufficient, the IFC shall use comparative peer analysis with demographically similar Regions;

(3) If neither methodology under paragraphs (1) or (2) yields statistically valid measurement, the stratum shall be excluded from compliance requirements, but the Region shall report annually on service provision to that population and may not systematically deny services on the basis of the exclusion.

(e) **Small Region Pooling.** Small Regions under Section 3-A may pool data across Regions for purposes of stratified outcome measurement under this Section, where individual Regional sample sizes are insufficient. Pooled Regions are collectively responsible for achieving outcome floors across shared strata.

(f) **Transition Period.** Within thirty (30) months of ratification, the IFC shall develop and adopt final stratified outcome methodologies. During the transition period:

(1) Efficiency indexing under Section 3(e) shall apply using aggregate outcome measures;

(2) Regions shall collect and report outcome data disaggregated by age, disability status, and geography using standardized federal survey methodologies;

(3) The IFC shall issue annual reports identifying Regions with statistically significant disparities in service delivery across demographic groups, which shall create a rebuttable presumption of creaming;

(4) If the IFC fails to adopt final methodologies within thirty-six (36) months, Congress shall by joint resolution appoint an independent commission to complete the methodology development.

---

### Section 3-C. Efficiency Standards and the Non-Coercion Standard

*[Resolves Gap 52 — National Benefits Spine Fiscal Blame Loop, Part 4. Clarifies the boundary between prohibited coercive conditions under Section 4 and permitted accountability standards for NBS programs.]*

(a) **Efficiency Standards Are Not Ceilings.** Federal efficiency benchmarks, cost-per-outcome standards, and performance metrics established under Section 3 do not constitute "ceilings" prohibited by Article III, Section 1. Regions remain free to exceed federal outcome floors using Regional own-source revenue.

(b) **Regional Supplementation.** Federal funding under Section 3(c) is calibrated to achieve outcome floors at median efficiency. A Region's choice to spend additional own-source revenue to exceed outcome floors is Regional fiscal responsibility, not a federal obligation.

(c) **Purchasing Power and Delivery Model Adjustment.** The Regional Cost Index under Section 3(d) shall reflect not only differences in input prices (labor, real estate, materials) but also differences in service delivery costs arising from population density, geographic dispersion, climate, and other factors beyond Regional policy control. Efficiency comparisons shall be conducted within peer groups of Regions with similar demographic and geographic characteristics where feasible.

(d) **Non-Coercion Standard Scope.** The Non-Coercion Standard under Section 4 does not prohibit:

(1) outcome-based funding formulas that tie federal contributions to measurable results;

(2) efficiency-indexed federal contributions that fund median cost-per-outcome;

(3) co-payment requirements for shared programs under Section 3(a);

(4) performance improvement requirements for Regions failing to meet outcome floors under Section 3(e)(3)-(4);

(5) Program-Specific Performance Receivership for persistent underperformance under Section 3(e)(4)(D).

(e) **Boundary Definition.** The distinction between prohibited coercive conditions and permitted accountability standards under Section 4 is:

(1) **Prohibited (Coercive):** Conditioning funding on policy choices unrelated to the program's outcome objectives;

(2) **Permitted (Accountability):** Conditioning funding on achieving the outcomes the funding is intended to produce, using the specific metrics and methodologies established under Section 3 and Section 3-B.

(f) **Outcome Floor Constraints.** Outcome floors shall be specified in terms of measurable results (health status, educational attainment, housing stability, income security) rather than service utilization or programmatic enrollment. Outcome floors:

(1) may not be set at levels that can be achieved only through a single policy architecture, thereby foreclosing Regional policy experimentation;

(2) shall be set at the level achievable by the median-performing Region using the least-restrictive policy approach demonstrated to achieve the outcome in any peer jurisdiction;

(3) may not require expenditure exceeding median PPP-adjusted cost-per-outcome by more than twenty percent (20%);

(4) may not impose process requirements unrelated to outcome measurement or mandate specific delivery methods rather than measurable results.

Any Region may petition the Allocation Review Board for review of an outcome floor specification on grounds that it constitutes a disguised policy mandate. The ARB shall apply de novo review and may adjust the outcome floor or exempt the Region if it demonstrates pursuit of a good-faith alternative approach that achieves comparable outcomes.

---

### Section 4. Non-Coercion Standard

*[This section prohibits the federal government from using conditional spending or tax expenditures to coerce Regions into adopting policies within Exclusive Regional Domains. See Gap 194.]*

(a) **Conditional Spending Limitations.** Federal spending conditions and conditional tax expenditures must be:

(1) **Germane**: directly and substantially related to the federal spending program's purpose;

(2) **Non-Coercive**: not compelling adoption of policies within Exclusive Regional Domains as defined in Article II, Section 1(e)(2); and

(3) **Transparent**: clearly stated in the authorizing legislation, not imposed through regulation, guidance, or enforcement discretion.

(b) **Coercion Threshold.** A spending condition or conditional tax expenditure is presumptively coercive if:

(1) the potential loss to the Region exceeds 5% of the Region's budget for the affected functional category as determined by the Independent Fiscal Council; OR

(2) the aggregate financial impact of all federal conditions within a single functional category exceeds 5% of the Region's budget for that category in a fiscal year; OR

(3) the condition requires a Region to enact, maintain, or repeal legislation within an Exclusive Regional Domain; OR

(4) the condition effectively transfers regulatory authority from the Region to the federal government in an Exclusive Regional Domain.

(c) **Germaneness Requirement.** Conditions attached to federal spending must relate to how the federal funds are spent, not to unrelated Regional policies. A condition on transportation funds must relate to transportation construction, maintenance, or safety--not to education, family law, or other domains.

(d) **Exclusive Domain Protection.** No spending condition or conditional tax expenditure may require a Region to:

(1) adopt specific policies within an Exclusive Regional Domain;

(2) surrender regulatory authority within an Exclusive Regional Domain;

(3) submit Exclusive Regional Domain legislation for federal approval; or

(4) enforce federal standards within an Exclusive Regional Domain.

(e) **Voluntary Cooperation.** A Region may accept federal conditions within an Exclusive Regional Domain only by a two-thirds vote of the Regional Assembly. Such acceptance:

(1) may be revoked by the same two-thirds vote at any time;

(2) does not establish precedent for future conditions;

(3) does not waive the Region's right to challenge other conditions under this section.

(f) **Scope.** For purposes of this section, "federal funds" includes appropriations, grants, transfers, tax credits, tax deductions, tax exemptions, and any other financial incentive conditioned on Regional policy compliance. "Functional category" means the budget classification categories established and maintained by the Independent Fiscal Council under Section 5.

(g) **Maintenance of Effort.** Maintenance of Effort requirements attached to conditional spending are subject to the limitations of Section 18(e) regardless of whether the underlying program constitutes a funded or unfunded mandate.

(h) **Enforcement.** Regions may challenge spending conditions before the Constitutional Court. If a condition is found invalid:

(1) the invalid condition is severed; the Region receives the funds without the condition;

(2) Congress may not reduce baseline funding to the Region--defined as the prior fiscal year's appropriation for the affected program--in retaliation for a successful challenge;

(3) the prevailing Region recovers litigation costs.

(i) **Savings Clause.** This section does not limit:

(1) legitimate accounting, audit, and reporting requirements for how federal funds are spent;

(2) conditions directly and substantially related to the administration of the funded program itself;

(3) federal regulatory authority in Shared Domains or Federal Exclusive Domains as defined in Article II, Section 1(e).

---

### Section 5. Independent Fiscal Council

(a) There is hereby established an Independent Fiscal Council (IFC) consisting of seven members appointed as follows:

- (1) two members appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate,
- (2) two members appointed by the Speaker of the House,
- (3) two members appointed by a majority vote of all Regional Governors, and
- (4) one member selected by unanimous agreement of the other six members, who shall serve as Chair.

(b) Members shall serve staggered seven-year terms and may be removed only for cause by a two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress.

(c) The Council shall:

- (1) measure Regional fiscal capacity annually using the formula established by statute under Section 3-A(f),
- (2) certify equalization transfer calculations under Section 3,
- (3) determine Small Region qualification under Section 3-A(e),
- (4) advise Congress on fiscal federalism matters,
- (5) publish annual reports on the fiscal status of each Region and the effectiveness of equalization transfers,
- (6) measure and classify non-human economic output under Section 21, including development of valuation methodologies in coordination with the Emerging Technology Review Board.

(d) Council determinations under subsections (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) shall be final and not subject to political override, but may be challenged in federal court for procedural error or constitutional violation.

(e) The Council shall operate with full budgetary independence and shall receive automatic appropriations equal to 0.01% of equalization transfers or $50 million (indexed to inflation), whichever is greater.

(f) **Vacancy Filling.**

- (1) Vacancies on the Independent Fiscal Council shall be filled by the original appointing authority within ninety (90) days of the vacancy. If the original appointing authority fails to act within ninety (90) days, the Chief Justice shall make a temporary appointment from among persons with demonstrated expertise in public finance, economics, or fiscal policy who have no current affiliation with any Regional government.
- (2) Temporary appointments under this subsection are subject to the time limits and procedures established in Article IV, Section 4-C.
- (3) If vacancies reduce the Council below a quorum of four members, the quorum emergency provisions of Article IV, Section 4-C(e)(4) shall apply.

---

### Section 6. Regional Debt Discipline

#### Debt Ceilings

(a) **Standard Debt Ceiling.** No Region may issue debt exceeding:

(1) Fifteen percent of its three-year average Regional GDP; or

(2) One hundred fifty percent of its annual Regional tax revenue;

(3) Whichever is lower shall apply as the binding ceiling.

(b) **Emergency Debt Authorization.** Debt exceeding the standard ceiling requires:

(1) Authorization from the Independent Fiscal Council;

(2) Certification that the additional debt is necessary for genuine emergency response;

(3) A credible repayment plan demonstrating capacity to service the debt.

(c) **IFC Authorization Standards.** The IFC shall authorize emergency debt only if:

(1) The declared emergency meets objective criteria (natural disaster, economic crisis, public health emergency);

(2) The Region has exhausted reasonable revenue alternatives;

(3) The debt will be used solely for emergency response, not ongoing operations.

(d) **Absolute Debt Ceiling.** Even with IFC authorization, Regional debt may not exceed:

(1) Twenty-five percent of three-year average Regional GDP; or

(2) Two hundred fifty percent of annual Regional tax revenue;

(3) This ceiling is absolute and may not be waived.

#### Debt Sustainability Monitoring

(e) **IFC Debt Monitoring.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall:

(1) Monitor Regional debt levels quarterly;

(2) Publish debt sustainability assessments annually;

(3) Issue early warning alerts when debt approaches ceiling thresholds.

(f) **Debt Warning Thresholds.** The IFC shall issue alerts at:

(1) "Caution" when debt exceeds seventy-five percent of ceiling;

(2) "Warning" when debt exceeds ninety percent of ceiling;

(3) "Critical" when debt exceeds ninety-five percent of ceiling.

(g) **Warning Response Requirements.** Upon IFC warning:

(1) "Caution" requires Regional fiscal plan submission within ninety days;

(2) "Warning" prohibits new non-emergency debt issuance;

(3) "Critical" requires mandatory debt reduction plan with IFC approval.

(h) **Market Disclosure.** Regions shall disclose to bond markets:

(1) Current debt level relative to ceiling;

(2) IFC sustainability assessment;

(3) Any warning status and response plans.

#### No-Bailout Commitment

(i) **Federal No-Bailout Rule.** Neither the United States nor any instrumentality thereof shall:

(1) Assume, guarantee, or pay any debt or obligation of any Region or any instrumentality thereof;

(2) Appropriate funds for the purpose of enabling any Region to meet debt obligations or avoid default;

(3) Provide loans, credit facilities, or other financial assistance if the primary purpose is to enable debt service or avoid default.

Any law, appropriation, or executive action that violates this prohibition is void.

This prohibition does not apply to:

- (A) Formula-based stabilization transfers under Section 9, which address cyclical economic conditions rather than debt service;
- (B) Temporary federal assumption of essential service operations under Section 7(d)(1)(B), which constitutes operational continuity rather than financial assistance;
- (C) Emergency liquidity assistance under subsection (t) of this Section, provided all conditions therein are satisfied.

*[See Gap 197.]*

(j) **Regional Default Procedures.** If a Region cannot service its debt:

(1) The Region shall enter structured bankruptcy proceedings overseen by the ARB;

(2) Bondholders bear losses according to normal priority rules;

(3) Essential services continue under ARB-supervised receivership;

(4) Restructuring plans require approval by two-thirds of creditors by value in each class;

(5) Approved restructuring plans bind all creditors in the approving class, including holdouts;

(6) Pension obligations shall be modified only after bondholders and general obligation creditors have absorbed losses proportionate to their claims; pensions are not immune from modification if solvency cannot otherwise be restored.

*[See Gap 197.]*

(k) **Corridor Protection During Default.** National Interest Corridors:

(1) May not be closed or impaired during Regional fiscal distress;

(2) Shall be operated under federal receivership if necessary;

(3) The Region may not use corridor closure as leverage for bailout.

#### Intergenerational Protection

(l) **Debt Service Ceiling.** Annual debt service (principal plus interest) may not exceed:

(1) Fifteen percent of annual Regional tax revenue;

(2) If projected to exceed, new debt issuance is prohibited until compliance achieved.

(m) **Future Taxpayer Representation.** Regional debt decisions shall consider:

(1) IFC assessment of intergenerational equity;

(2) Long-term debt service projections under various economic scenarios;

(3) The IFC may object to debt issuance that unfairly burdens future generations.

(n) **Debt Maturity Requirements.** Regional debt shall:

(1) Have average weighted maturity not exceeding twenty years;

(2) Include no provisions that defer all principal repayment beyond ten years;

(3) These requirements ensure current generations bear current costs.

#### Off-Balance-Sheet Debt Controls

(o) **Consolidated Fiscal Reporting.** For purposes of all debt limits, ceilings, and monitoring under this Article, "Regional debt" includes:

(1) All direct obligations of the Regional government;

(2) All obligations of any Regional authority, agency, corporation, or instrumentality created by or on behalf of the Region, regardless of formal legal separation;

(3) All revenue bonds issued by entities in which the Region has an ownership interest, exercises control, or for which Regional action was required for creation;

(4) All public-private partnership obligations where the Region bears contingent liability, guarantees revenue, or provides availability payments;

(5) All lease-purchase agreements, certificates of participation, and similar financing arrangements;

(6) The proportionate share of any multi-Regional financing entity's obligations based on the Region's participation;

(7) Unfunded pension liabilities, unfunded other post-employment benefit (OPEB) liabilities, and unfunded liabilities of any other long-term employee benefit obligation, calculated using actuarial standards under Section 20 of this Article; provided that inclusion of such liabilities shall be phased in over ten (10) years following ratification, with ten percent (10%) of the calculated liability added in each year. *[See Gap 202.]*

(p) **Independent Infrastructure Authority Restrictions.**

(1) No Region may create or authorize the creation of an independent authority, corporation, or special district for the primary purpose of issuing debt that would not be included in Regional debt calculations;

(2) Any entity created by Regional action that issues debt exceeding $100 million shall be presumed to be a Regional instrumentality subject to consolidated reporting;

(3) The IFC may pierce the corporate form of any entity and attribute its debt to the creating Region if:

- (i) the Region exercises practical control over the entity's governance;
- (ii) the Region provides substantial revenue support or credit enhancement;
- (iii) the entity was structured to evade Regional debt limits.

(q) **Revenue Bond Disclosure.** Revenue bonds issued by Regional instrumentalities shall:

(1) Disclose in offering documents that the bonds are subject to Regional debt consolidation rules;

(2) State that bondholders cannot rely on formal legal separation to avoid the consequences of Regional fiscal distress;

(3) Be reported to the IFC within thirty days of issuance.

(r) **Penalties for Evasion.** If the IFC determines that a Region has structured transactions to evade debt limits:

(1) The evaded debt shall be immediately attributed to the Region;

(2) The Region shall be placed on "Warning" status regardless of prior debt level;

(3) Regional officials who authorized the evasive structure may be personally disqualified from future public financial positions;

(4) The Region shall reimburse IFC enforcement costs.

#### Market Discipline and Liquidity

(s) **Market Discipline Preservation.** To preserve market discipline on Regional borrowing:

(1) No federal law shall establish that Regional bonds are guaranteed by federal full faith and credit;

(2) No federal regulatory action shall require financial institutions to treat Regional bonds as risk-free assets;

(3) Regional bonds shall be rated, priced, and traded based on the creditworthiness of the issuing Region alone.

*[See Gap 197.]*

(t) **Emergency Liquidity Assistance.** Notwithstanding subsection (i), the Federal Reserve may provide short-term liquidity assistance to a Region:

(1) Only upon certification by the Independent Fiscal Council that the Region faces a temporary liquidity crisis rather than structural insolvency;

(2) At penalty interest rates above market rates for comparable risk;

(3) For a maximum duration of eighteen (18) months, which may not be extended or renewed;

(4) Secured by adequate collateral;

(5) Subject to Congressional notification within forty-eight (48) hours and Congressional override within sixty (60) days.

If the IFC determines at any point during the assistance period that the Region is structurally insolvent rather than temporarily illiquid, liquidity assistance shall terminate immediately and the Region shall enter the fiscal intervention process under Section 10.

*[See Gap 197.]*

### Section 7. Financial Conservatorship

#### Systemic Risk Limits

(a) **Mandatory Fiscal Limits.**

(1) The Independent Fiscal Council shall establish and publish mandatory debt-to-GDP ratios for all Regions, not to exceed eighty percent of Regional GDP;

(2) Regional Development Banks shall maintain leverage ratios not exceeding those applicable to federally-chartered banks;

(3) Regions must submit annual fiscal sustainability reports to the IFC demonstrating compliance;

(4) The IFC may adjust ratios based on economic conditions but may not waive limits entirely.

#### Automatic Conservatorship

(b) **Financial Conservatorship Trigger.**

(1) Exceeding the debt-to-GDP ratio by ten percent or more triggers automatic "Financial Conservatorship" status;

(2) During Conservatorship, the IFC assumes authority over:

- (A) All new Regional borrowing and bond issuance;
- (B) Regional Development Bank operations and lending policies;
- (C) Budget approval for expenditures exceeding operational minimums;

(3) Conservatorship continues until the Region returns to compliance for two consecutive fiscal years;

(4) Regional officials may not incur new obligations without IFC approval during Conservatorship.

#### Anti-Extortion Provisions

(c) **Contagion Risk Limitation.**

(1) No Region may condition fiscal responsibility on federal policy concessions;

(2) Threats of "disorderly default" to extract transfers or exemptions constitute grounds for immediate Conservatorship;

(3) The IFC may pre-emptively impose Conservatorship upon finding evidence of deliberate over-leveraging for coercive purposes;

(4) Equalization transfers shall not be increased to remedy self-inflicted fiscal crises caused by deliberate over-borrowing.

#### Orderly Resolution

(d) **Structured Resolution.**

(1) If a Region in Conservatorship cannot achieve fiscal sustainability, the IFC may implement orderly resolution including:

- (A) Mandatory debt restructuring with haircuts distributed equitably among bondholders;
- (B) Temporary federal assumption of essential service operations, which constitutes operational continuity and does not constitute financial assistance or a guarantee of Regional debt obligations under Section 6(i);
- (C) Asset sales from Regional Development Banks;

(2) Resolution shall not include unlimited federal bailouts or transfer increases;

(3) The resolution process shall impose costs on the failing Region proportionate to its contribution to the crisis;

(4) Regional officials who deliberately caused insolvency are subject to personal liability and criminal referral.

---

### Section 8. Administrative Receivership

(a) **Trigger Conditions.** If a Region's own-source revenue falls below forty percent (40%) of its total expenditures for three consecutive fiscal years, the Independent Fiscal Council shall declare that Region to be in a state of Administrative Receivership.

(b) **Receivership Powers.** During Administrative Receivership, the Independent Fiscal Council shall have authority to:

(1) Conduct comprehensive audits of Regional finances, including all revenue sources, expenditures, and obligations;

(2) Require the Region to submit quarterly fiscal reports in a form prescribed by the Council;

(3) Mandate specific revenue reforms, including but not limited to minimum tax rates, broadening of tax bases, elimination of fiscally irresponsible exemptions, and improved collection enforcement;

(4) Require the Region to submit a Fiscal Recovery Plan within one hundred eighty (180) days, subject to Council approval;

(5) Disapprove Regional budgets that the Council determines will perpetuate dependency; and

(6) Require the Region to engage independent fiscal advisors at Regional expense.

(c) **Limitations on Receivership Powers.** The Independent Fiscal Council may not:

(1) Reduce, condition, or otherwise affect the Region's representation in the Senate or any other legislative body;

(2) Reduce, condition, or otherwise affect the voting rights of the Region's citizens in federal elections;

(3) Assume direct control of Regional government operations beyond fiscal matters;

(4) Mandate specific spending cuts to particular programs (the Region retains discretion over expenditure priorities within approved budget levels); or

(5) Impose receivership for reasons other than the objective fiscal trigger in subsection (a).

(d) **Exit from Receivership.** Administrative Receivership terminates automatically when the Region's own-source revenue exceeds fifty percent (50%) of its total expenditures for two consecutive fiscal years.

(e) **Democratic Representation Preserved.** For the avoidance of doubt, a Region in Administrative Receivership retains full and equal representation in the Senate, full participation in all constitutional processes, and all rights of self-governance except as specifically limited by this section. Fiscal dependency shall never be grounds for reducing a Region's democratic voice in the Union.

---

### Section 9. Asymmetric Shock Stabilization

#### Automatic Cyclical Stabilizers

(a) **Asymmetric Shock Recognition.** The IFC shall monitor Regional economic divergence using a composite index including:

(1) Regional unemployment rate deviation from national average;

(2) Regional GDP growth deviation from national average;

(3) Regional inflation deviation from national average;

(4) Regional housing price deviation from national trend.

(b) **Automatic Stabilizer Trigger.** When any Region's composite index exceeds two (2) standard deviations from the national mean for two (2) consecutive quarters:

(1) The Region shall be designated as experiencing an "Asymmetric Cyclical Shock";

(2) Automatic stabilization transfers shall commence without requiring Congressional appropriation;

(3) Designation shall continue until the index returns to within 1.5 standard deviations for two (2) consecutive quarters.

#### Cyclical Stabilization Fund

(c) **Cyclical Stabilization Fund.**

(1) **Establishment.** A Cyclical Stabilization Fund shall be established, separate from the Fiscal Equalization Fund, dedicated exclusively to asymmetric shock response.

(2) **Capitalization.** The Fund shall be capitalized through:

- (A) A base contribution of 0.5% of national GDP annually during non-crisis periods;
- (B) Countercyclical contributions: Regions experiencing above-average growth contribute an additional 0.25% of Regional GDP;
- (C) Federal Reserve remittances during periods of monetary expansion.

(3) **Target Reserve.** The Fund shall maintain a target reserve of 3% of national GDP, with contributions suspended when target is exceeded.

(d) **Disbursement Formula.** Stabilization transfers to Regions designated under subsection (b) shall be calculated as follows:

(1) **Unemployment Component.** A percentage, determined by the IFC within the range of forty (40) to sixty (60) percent, of the difference between the Region's unemployment rate and the national unemployment rate, multiplied by the Region's civilian labor force, multiplied by the Region's average annual wage as reported by the IFC. The IFC shall publish and justify the selected percentage at the time of each shock designation;

(2) **Revenue Stabilization Component.** A percentage, determined by the IFC within the range of sixty (60) to eighty (80) percent, of the shortfall between actual Regional revenue and the Region's five-year rolling average revenue, adjusted for inflation using the consumer price index for the Region. The IFC shall reduce the Revenue Stabilization Component by an amount equal to the estimated revenue loss attributable to the unemployment increase already captured by the Unemployment Component, to prevent double recovery. Revenue collected in the twelve (12) months preceding shock designation shall not be reduced by administrative delay, deferred collection, or accelerated refunds for purposes of deepening the measured shortfall;

(3) **Infrastructure Maintenance Component.** A percentage, determined by the IFC within the range of eighty-five (85) to one hundred (100) percent, of baseline for critical infrastructure maintenance within the Region during the shock designation period. Baseline is the Region's average annual infrastructure maintenance expenditure over the preceding five (5) fiscal years, excluding any single-year expenditure increase that exceeds twice the Region's ten-year average annual infrastructure growth rate unless the IFC certifies that the increase resulted from documented infrastructure emergencies or capital projects approved prior to the onset of the shock;

(4) **Automatic Commencement.** Transfers under this subsection shall commence within thirty (30) days of designation under subsection (b) and shall continue without interruption for the duration of the designation. No Congressional appropriation, executive order, or administrative action shall be required;

(5) **Pro-Rata Scaling.** Pro-rata scaling shall apply only after the IFC has fully committed all available Cyclical Stabilization Fund balance and has authorized or sought authorization for Union Stability Bond issuance under subsection (g). The IFC may not apply scaling in lieu of accessing available bond authority. If, after exhausting the Fund balance and authorized bond proceeds, total formula outlays across all designated Regions still exceed available resources, the IFC shall apply a uniform pro-rata scaling factor to all disbursements, published contemporaneously with the scaling determination. No Region's scaled disbursement shall fall below sixty percent (60%) of the unadjusted formula amount. If the sixty percent floor cannot be maintained for all designated Regions, the IFC shall immediately certify an Imminent Liquidity Crisis under subsection (g)(6);

(6) **Conservatorship Tolling.** A Region designated under subsection (b) shall not be subject to Financial Conservatorship under Section 7 or Administrative Receivership under Section 8 for fiscal deficits attributable to the Asymmetric Cyclical Shock, as certified by the IFC. Conservatorship and receivership triggers under Sections 7 and 8 shall be tolled for the duration of the shock designation. Upon termination of the designation, the Region shall have twenty-four (24) months to return to compliance with the fiscal thresholds of Sections 7 and 8. This tolling does not apply to fiscal deficits attributable to Regional policy choices unrelated to the shock. A Region or any creditor affected by the tolling determination may petition the ARB for expedited review of the IFC's certification within thirty (30) days. The ARB shall rule within sixty (60) days. Pending review, the tolling remains in effect. The ARB may affirm, modify, or reverse the IFC's attribution of deficits to shock versus Regional policy causes.

#### Regional Countercyclical Tools

(e) **Receding Region Countercyclical Tools.** Regions experiencing Asymmetric Cyclical Shocks (composite index below -2 SD) may:

(1) **Accelerated Depreciation:** Authorize accelerated depreciation schedules for business investment within the Region;

(2) **Payroll Tax Holiday:** Temporarily suspend Regional payroll tax contributions for up to twenty-four (24) months;

(3) **Regional Development Bank Expansion:** Authorize Regional Development Banks to expand lending capacity by up to 150% of normal limits;

(4) **Work-Sharing Programs:** Implement subsidized work-sharing to reduce layoffs while preserving employment relationships.

(f) **Booming Region Countermeasures.** Regions experiencing above-trend growth (composite index exceeding +1.5 SD) may:

(1) Impose Regional capital gains surcharges of up to 5%;

(2) Increase Regional reserve requirements for Regional Development Banks;

(3) Implement Regional property transfer taxes to moderate housing speculation;

(4) Establish Regional inflation stabilization reserves funded by surplus revenues.

#### Federal Deficit Backstop

(g) **Union Stability Bond Authority.** If the Cyclical Stabilization Fund balance falls below ten percent (10%) of the target reserve established under subsection (c)(3), or if the IFC certifies that projected stabilization outlays over the next twelve (12) months — based on current designations and historical disbursement rates — will exceed the current Fund balance:

(1) The Federal Treasury shall issue Union Stability Bonds to fund continuing stabilization transfers under subsection (d);

(2) Union Stability Bonds shall be general obligations of the United States, backed by the full faith and credit of the Union;

(3) Bond proceeds shall be used exclusively for Cyclical Stabilization disbursements under this Section;

(4) The IFC shall certify the fund shortfall before each bond issuance and shall publish the certification contemporaneously;

(5) No single bond issuance shall exceed one percent (1%) of national GDP. If additional issuance is required, the IFC shall publish a supplemental certification at each increment;

(6) **Accelerated Tranche Authority.** If the IFC and the Federal Reserve Board jointly certify an Imminent Liquidity Crisis — defined as projected fund exhaustion within sixty (60) days with designated Regions still requiring stabilization transfers — the one percent cap in paragraph (5) may be exceeded for a single issuance not to exceed three percent (3%) of national GDP. The joint certification shall be published immediately and reported to the relevant committees of Congress within twenty-four (24) hours.

(h) **Recovery Surcharge.** Upon issuance of Union Stability Bonds:

(1) The IFC shall calculate a Recovery Surcharge sufficient to retire all outstanding Union Stability Bonds within fifteen (15) years;

(2) The Recovery Surcharge shall be implemented automatically twenty-four (24) months after both of the following conditions are met: (A) the national composite economic index has returned to within 0.5 standard deviations of its ten-year trend for four (4) consecutive quarters; and (B) no Region remains designated under subsection (b). If either condition ceases to be met during the twenty-four-month waiting period, the waiting period resets. If additional Union Stability Bonds are issued under subsection (g) during the twenty-four-month waiting period, the waiting period resets to twenty-four (24) months from the date of the most recent issuance;

(3) The Surcharge shall be apportioned among all Regions according to the Fiscal Equalization capacity formula established under Section 3;

(4) No Region shall be exempted from the Recovery Surcharge, regardless of whether it received stabilization transfers;

(5) The IFC shall publish annual projections of bond retirement timelines and cumulative surcharge burdens by Region.

(i) **Anti-Depletion Provision.** To prevent strategic exhaustion of the Cyclical Stabilization Fund:

(1) Any Region that received stabilization transfers in the twenty-four (24) months preceding Union Stability Bond issuance shall have its future Stabilization Fund contributions increased by 0.1% of Regional GDP for ten (10) years following bond retirement;

(2) This increase shall not apply if the IFC certifies that the Region's shock resulted from factors "substantially beyond Regional policy control," including global commodity price shifts, federal policy changes, natural disasters, or pandemics;

(3) A Region subject to increased contributions under paragraph (1) that demonstrates sustained fiscal recovery — composite index within 1 standard deviation of the national mean for eight (8) consecutive quarters — may petition the IFC for reduction of the contribution increase. The IFC may reduce the increase by up to fifty percent (50%) but may not eliminate it entirely;

(4) The IFC shall publish annually the total amount of increased contributions collected, by Region, and the projected retirement date for outstanding bonds.

#### Inter-Regional Labor Mobility Credit

(j) **Mobility Credit Trigger.** When a Region maintains a composite index below negative two (-2) standard deviations for four (4) consecutive quarters:

(1) The IFC shall establish an Inter-Regional Mobility Credit program funded from the Cyclical Stabilization Fund;

(2) The program shall remain active until the originating Region's composite index returns to within negative 1.5 (-1.5) standard deviations for two (2) consecutive quarters.

(k) **Mobility Credit Benefits.** Eligible workers relocating from a Receding Region (composite index below -2 SD) to a Region whose composite index exceeds positive 1.5 (+1.5) standard deviations shall receive:

(1) **Relocation Grant:** An amount equivalent to twenty-five percent (25%) of the National Median Annual Wage as most recently reported by the IFC, for documented moving expenses;

(2) **Housing Transition Assistance:** Up to six (6) months of housing cost differential subsidy if the destination Region's median housing cost exceeds the origin Region's by more than twenty percent (20%);

(3) **Credential Portability Assistance:** Expedited professional licensing reciprocity processing and fee coverage, consistent with the mutual recognition requirements of Article I, Section 9. Destination Region licensing authorities shall act within sixty (60) days of application;

(4) **Family Transition Support:** An additional grant equivalent to ten percent (10%) of the National Median Annual Wage, for dependent education transition and spousal employment assistance.

(l) **Mobility Credit Limitations.**

(1) Credits shall be available only to workers who have been employed or actively seeking employment in the Receding Region for at least twelve (12) of the preceding twenty-four (24) months;

(2) Workers who return to the originating Region within eighteen (18) months of receiving a Relocation Grant shall repay a pro-rated portion of the grant;

(3) Total Mobility Credit expenditures shall not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of annual Cyclical Stabilization Fund disbursements, to prevent "hollowing out" of Receding Regions;

(4) The IFC shall publish quarterly reports on Mobility Credit utilization, including numbers of workers relocated, originating and destination Regions, grant amounts, and return rates.

### Section 9-A. Regional Transition Endowment for Structural Economic Shifts

*This section addresses permanent structural economic transitions — distinct from the cyclical shocks addressed in Section 9. The Transition Endowment operates as a third fund, separate from both the Fiscal Equalization Fund (Section 3) and the Cyclical Stabilization Fund (Section 9).*

(a) **Establishment.** A Regional Transition Endowment shall be established, administered by the IFC, dedicated exclusively to addressing permanent structural economic shifts that render entire Regional economic sectors nonviable.

(b) **Structural Collapse Trigger.** A Region may petition the IFC for Transition Endowment access upon demonstrating:

(1) Loss of at least twenty-five percent (25%) of employment in a Primary Industrial Sector within a ten (10) year period. A "Primary Industrial Sector" is any sector comprising more than fifteen percent (15%) of Regional employment;

(2) The loss results primarily from global economic shifts, technological change, or federal policy changes rather than Regional policy failures;

(3) The IFC certifies that the sectoral decline is "Structural and Permanent" rather than cyclical, based on independent economic analysis published with the certification.

(c) **Capitalization.**

(1) Initial capitalization of 0.5% of national GDP, phased in over five (5) years from ratification;

(2) Annual contributions of 0.1% of national GDP during non-crisis periods, defined as periods in which no Region is designated under Section 9(b);

(3) Supplemental contributions from federal revenues derived from policies contributing to structural shifts. Where a federal policy change — including but not limited to carbon pricing, trade agreements, or technology regulation — is certified by the IFC as a proximate cause of structural sectoral decline, ten percent (10%) of federal revenue attributable to that policy shall be directed to the Transition Endowment for a period of ten (10) years;

(4) Target reserve of 1.5% of national GDP, with annual contributions suspended when the target is reached.

(d) **Ten-Year Transition Master Plan.** Upon Structural and Permanent certification, the affected Region shall develop a Transition Master Plan, subject to IFC approval, including:

(1) **Workforce Retraining:** Programs aligned with emerging economic opportunities, including partnerships with Regional educational institutions and private employers;

(2) **Infrastructure Realignment:** Capital investment in infrastructure supporting new economic sectors, including broadband, transportation, and energy systems;

(3) **Educational Institution Adaptation:** Community college and university program development for transition sectors, with enrollment targets and completion benchmarks;

(4) **Business Incubation:** Regional Development Bank capitalization for transition-sector entrepreneurship, with loan performance targets;

(5) **Social Transition Support:** Enhanced social services during the adjustment period, including extended unemployment benefits, mental health services, and community stabilization programs.

(e) **Governance.**

(1) The IFC shall review and approve Transition Master Plans within one hundred eighty (180) days of submission. Failure to act within this period constitutes a constructive denial subject to judicial review;

(2) Disbursements shall be tied to milestone achievement, with annual progress reviews and public reporting;

(3) Regions may receive Transition Endowment support for a maximum of fifteen (15) years per structural shift;

(4) **No Double Recovery.** A Region may not simultaneously receive Cyclical Stabilization transfers under Section 9 and Transition Endowment disbursements under this Section for the same economic sector. If a Region qualifies for both funds due to overlapping causes, the Transition Endowment disbursement shall be reduced by the amount of any Cyclical Stabilization transfers attributed to the same sector's decline. The IFC shall determine sectoral attribution of Cyclical Stabilization transfers using the methodology specified in its Disbursement Certification published under Section 9(d) at the time of each disbursement. If the Disbursement Certification does not specify sectoral attribution, the IFC shall allocate Cyclical Stabilization transfers proportionally based on the share of each sector in the Region's total employment decline during the designation period. A Region may receive both funds without offset if the cyclical shock and structural shift affect demonstrably different sectors, as certified by the IFC;

(5) If a Region fails to meet milestones for three (3) consecutive annual reviews, the IFC may suspend disbursements pending plan revision. Suspension shall not exceed one hundred eighty (180) days; if no revised plan is approved, the Region may reapply with a new plan after twelve (12) months;

(6) **Mandatory Plan Refresh.** If Transition Endowment support continues beyond ten (10) years, the Region shall submit an updated Transition Master Plan at year five (5) and year ten (10) of the support period. Updated plans are subject to IFC approval under paragraph (1). Failure to submit an updated plan within one hundred eighty (180) days of the refresh deadline constitutes grounds for suspension under paragraph (5). Milestones for continued disbursement shall be based on the most recently approved plan.

(f) **Anti-Capture Provision.** Transition Master Plan expenditures may not be directed to:

(1) Maintaining employment in the declining sector through direct subsidy, unless the IFC certifies that phased decline — rather than immediate cessation — is necessary to prevent community collapse;

(2) Any enterprise that received more than twenty percent (20%) of its revenue from the declining sector in the five (5) years preceding the structural shift certification, unless the enterprise demonstrates a credible pivot to a transition sector;

(3) Any enterprise in which a Regional elected official, or a member of such official's immediate family, holds a financial interest exceeding one percent (1%).

### Section 9-B. Federal Reserve Regional Divergence Consideration

*This section establishes institutional mechanisms to address the monetary policy mismatch inherent in combining deep Regional fiscal autonomy with a single national currency, and to counter secessionist narratives arising from asymmetric economic conditions.*

#### Regional Impact Assessment

(a) **Regional Divergence Consideration.** The Federal Reserve, in conducting monetary policy, shall:

(1) Publish quarterly Regional Impact Assessments analyzing the differential effects of current and proposed monetary policy across Regions;

(2) When Regional economic divergence as measured by the IFC composite index under Section 9(a) exceeds two (2) standard deviations for any Region, provide written explanation of how monetary policy accounts for asymmetric conditions;

(3) Coordinate with the IFC on timing of monetary policy changes relative to Cyclical Stabilization Fund disbursements under Section 9, to avoid pro-cyclical interaction.

(b) **Regional Reserve Bank Consultation and Reporting.** Before major monetary policy decisions during periods of significant Regional divergence (any Region exceeding 1.5 SD from national mean):

(1) The Federal Reserve Board shall consult with Federal Reserve Bank presidents from both high-growth and low-growth Regions;

(2) Dissenting Regional perspectives shall be published in FOMC minutes;

(3) The Chair of the Federal Reserve shall deliver an annual Regional Divergence Report to the ARB and the relevant committees of Congress, analyzing the regional distributional effects of monetary policy conducted during the preceding twelve (12) months. This report shall be published and made available to the public.

#### Anti-Secession Narrative Institutional Tools

(c) **Lifetime Transfer Accounting.** The IFC shall publish annually:

(1) Cumulative stabilization and equalization transfers received and contributed by each Region over rolling thirty (30) year periods;

(2) Net transfer position for each Region, showing historical periods as net contributor and net recipient;

(3) Projection of expected future transfer flows based on demographic and economic trends, with methodology and assumptions disclosed.

(d) **Counterfactual Analysis.** The IFC shall publish biennially:

(1) Estimated Regional economic performance absent monetary union, using comparable independent economy benchmarks;

(2) Calculated value of common market access, labor mobility, and capital flow benefits to each Region;

(3) Estimated costs each Region would bear for independent currency management, trade barriers, and reduced capital access.

(e) **Narrative Correction Authority.** When public discourse contains materially false claims about inter-Regional transfers:

(1) The IFC may issue Economic Fact Sheets correcting specific misstatements with verifiable data;

(2) The IFC shall maintain an Economic Transparency Portal, publicly accessible, on which all corrections, Lifetime Transfer Accounting reports, and Counterfactual Analyses are published. Regional governments may voluntarily repost IFC corrections through their own communications channels but shall not be compelled to do so;

(3) IFC corrections shall be limited to verifiable economic data and shall not address policy preferences, political positions, or the desirability of any particular fiscal arrangement.

(f) **Anti-Inflammatory Restriction.** The IFC shall not:

(1) Characterize any Region as a "permanent burden," "chronic dependent," or similar pejorative designation;

(2) Publish rankings that frame transfer receipt as Regional failure or moral deficiency;

(3) Issue corrections that could reasonably be interpreted as taking sides in Regional political disputes;

(4) Advocate for or against secession, boundary changes, or constitutional amendments;

(5) **Comity Clause.** No Regional government shall, in official inter-governmental communications, characterize another Region as a "parasite," "permanent burden," or similar pejorative based on that Region's net transfer position. This restriction applies to official documents, testimony, and formal communications between Regional governments and does not restrict the speech of individual officials acting in their personal capacity, legislative debate, or media commentary.

---

### Section 10. Fiscal Intervention Hierarchy

The IFC fiscal intervention authorities established in this Article proceed in escalating stages. Each stage requires a finding that lesser interventions are insufficient before proceeding to more intensive measures.

(a) **Intervention Stages.**

(1) **Stage 1: Capacity-Based Equalization Adjustment.** The IFC may adjust equalization calculations under Section 3 to account for self-inflicted fiscal weakness, including:

- (A) Capacity-based calculations that treat forgone tax revenue as if collected (subsidy-neutrality adjustment);
- (B) Predatory subsidy prohibition enforcement;
- (C) Tax expenditure reporting requirements.

(2) **Stage 2: Negligence Finding and Clawback.** If capacity adjustment proves insufficient, the IFC may issue a negligence finding upon determining that Regional fiscal distress results from deliberate policy choices rather than external circumstances:

- (A) Strategic incompetence or deliberate under-collection triggers enhanced reporting;
- (B) Equalization transfers reduced to prevent subsidizing self-inflicted harm;
- (C) Clawback of prior transfers if premised on materially misleading fiscal reporting.

(3) **Stage 3: Solvency Certification Suspension.** If negligence finding proves insufficient:

- (A) The IFC may suspend the Region's solvency certification;
- (B) Suspended certification triggers market disclosure requirements;
- (C) Asset quality floors for Regional Development Banks may be imposed;
- (D) Contagion firewalls activated to protect other Regions.

(4) **Stage 4: Financial Conservatorship.** Only if Stages 1-3 prove insufficient may the IFC impose Financial Conservatorship under Section 7, assuming control over Regional borrowing and major fiscal decisions.

(5) **Stage 5: Administrative Receivership.** If the objective trigger in Section 8(a) is met, Administrative Receivership provides the most intensive intervention.

(b) **Escalation Documentation.** Before proceeding to a higher intervention stage, the IFC shall:

(1) Document why lesser interventions have proven insufficient;

(2) Provide the Region thirty (30) days notice and opportunity to respond;

(3) Issue a public finding justifying escalation.

(c) **De-escalation Path.** The IFC shall reduce intervention intensity when the Region demonstrates sustained compliance:

(1) Each stage requires two consecutive quarters of compliance before de-escalation;

(2) De-escalation proceeds one stage at a time;

(3) The Region may not be re-escalated for the same conduct within twelve (12) months of de-escalation.

---

### Section 11. Fiscal Subsidiarity Protection

#### Tax Base Preservation

(a) **Fiscal Subsidiarity Principle.** Regional and Federal taxation shall not collectively render States unable to fund their enumerated duties through reasonable local taxation.

(b) **IFC Tax Burden Certification.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall certify annually:

(1) The combined Federal-Regional-State effective tax rate for each major tax base (income, payroll, property, sales, corporate);

(2) The proportion of each tax base consumed by Federal and Regional taxation;

(3) Whether the remaining tax capacity is sufficient for States to fund enumerated duties.

(c) **Tax Capacity Floor.** States shall retain access to tax capacity sufficient to fund:

(1) K-12 education at the national average per-pupil expenditure;

(2) Local road maintenance at levels sufficient for public safety;

(3) Essential State administrative functions;

(4) The IFC shall calculate a "Minimum State Tax Capacity" for each State.

(d) **Crowding-Out Prohibition.** If Federal and Regional taxation would reduce State access below the Minimum State Tax Capacity:

(1) The IFC shall notify the offending level(s);

(2) The offending level shall reduce rates or provide compensating transfers within one hundred eighty (180) days;

(3) Failure to comply results in automatic transfer from the offending level to affected States.

### Section 11-A. Prohibition on Predatory Tax Exportation

(a) **Tax Exportation Defined.** Tax exportation occurs when the economic burden of a Regional or State tax, fee, or assessment falls primarily (greater than sixty percent) on persons or entities residing outside the taxing jurisdiction.

(b) **Tax Exportation Ceiling.** No Region may derive more than twenty-five percent (25%) of its total annual revenue from exported taxes. This ceiling applies to:

- (1) transit fees on inter-Regional energy, data, or transportation corridors;
- (2) severance taxes on resources where the primary consumption occurs outside the Region;
- (3) consumption or sales taxes specifically targeting industries or activities with primarily non-resident participation;
- (4) any other fiscal instrument where the Independent Fiscal Council (IFC) determines the ultimate economic incidence is shifted to non-residents.

(c) **Monopoly Rents Finding.** If a Region possesses a geographic or economic monopoly over a vital national utility (e.g., a primary deep-water port, a national fiber-optic hub, or a trans-continental energy corridor), the IFC shall:

- (1) establish a "Neutral Service Rate" for that utility based on cost-plus-reasonable-margin;
- (2) any revenue collected above this rate shall be deemed "Monopoly Rent" and credited against the Region's equalization transfers.

(d) **Enforcement and Remediation.** If a Region exceeds the Tax Exportation Ceiling:

- (1) the excess revenue shall be placed in an escrow fund administered by the IFC;
- (2) the fund shall be redistributed as "Exportation Rebates" to the Regions whose residents bore the economic burden;
- (3) persistent violations (three consecutive years) shall result in the IFC assuming authority over the Region's tax-rate setting for the offending categories.

(e) **Incidence Determination.** The IFC shall determine economic incidence using standard public finance methodology, considering price elasticities, market structure, and pass-through rates. The IFC's incidence determination is subject to methodological challenge under Article II, Section 7-A(f).

### Section 12. Democratic Accountability for Fiscal Institutions

#### Political Override for Systemic Disputes

(a) **Legitimacy Review Trigger.** If three or more Regions formally declare non-compliance with IFC or ARB determinations within a twelve-month period:

(1) The declarations shall automatically trigger a "Legitimacy Review" requiring Congress to:

- (i) hold public hearings within sixty (60) days on the disputed determinations;
- (ii) vote within one hundred twenty (120) days on whether to affirm, modify, or vacate the disputed determinations;
- (iii) consider structural reforms to the IFC or ARB.

(2) During Legitimacy Review:

- (i) enforcement of disputed determinations is stayed;
- (ii) affected Regions remain subject to baseline constitutional requirements (debt ceilings, no-bailout rule);
- (iii) the IFC and ARB shall participate in hearings and defend their determinations publicly.

(b) **Periodic Reauthorization.** The statutory authorities of the IFC and ARB shall sunset every twelve (12) years unless reauthorized by Congress. Reauthorization shall include:

(1) review of institutional performance;

(2) opportunity for structural reforms;

(3) public comment period.

(c) **Regional Representation in Determinations.** No determination materially adverse to a Region may be made by a panel where no member was appointed by Regional Governors. If such a panel composition occurs due to vacancies or recusals, the determination shall require unanimous agreement of remaining members.

#### Transparency Requirements

(d) **Public Accountability.** The IFC and ARB shall:

(1) publish all deliberations and vote records;

(2) issue plain-language explanations of determinations accessible to non-experts;

(3) maintain public dashboards showing Regional fiscal status and pending matters;

(4) hold annual public meetings in each Region.

#### Non-Compliance Response Ladder

(e) **Graduated Enforcement.** Before any coercive enforcement against a non-compliant Region:

(1) **Stage 1 - Explanation:** The IFC/ARB shall issue a formal explanation and offer technical assistance (30 days);

(2) **Stage 2 - Mediation:** Mediation by a panel including Regional Governor representatives (60 days);

(3) **Stage 3 - Congressional Review:** Congressional review and vote on whether enforcement is appropriate (90 days);

(4) **Stage 4 - Enforcement:** Only after Congressional authorization may coercive measures (conservatorship, receivership) proceed.

(f) **Emergency Exception.** Subsection (e) does not apply when:

(1) the Region's actions pose imminent risk of contagion to other Regions' fiscal stability;

(2) the Region has deliberately structured transactions to evade constitutional limits;

(3) certified by the Chief Justice as requiring immediate intervention.

---

### Section 13. Prohibition on Shadow Currencies and Quasi-Monetary Instruments

(a) **Federal Monetary Exclusivity.** The federal government's exclusive authority over "currency and monetary policy" under Article II, Section 1 includes exclusive authority over all instruments that function as money, regardless of their formal designation.

(b) **Prohibited Regional Instruments.** No Region or State may issue, authorize, or permit the circulation of:

- (1) "Regional credits," "energy credits," "tax-anticipation tokens," or similar instruments that are transferable and accepted for payment of taxes, fees, or utility charges;
- (2) digital tokens, blockchain-based currencies, or other electronic instruments that function as a medium of exchange within Regional commerce;
- (3) scrip, vouchers, or certificates that are designed to circulate as a substitute for federal currency;
- (4) any instrument that, regardless of its formal designation, functions as a store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account within the Regional economy.

(c) **Functional Test.** An instrument, regardless of whether it was created, issued, or sponsored by a Region or State, shall be deemed a prohibited quasi-currency if it meets any two of the following criteria:

- (1) it is accepted for payment of Regional or State taxes, fees, or charges;
- (2) it is traded on secondary markets or exchanges;
- (3) its aggregate value in circulation exceeds $100 million;
- (4) it is used by more than 10,000 distinct parties in commercial transactions within a twelve-month period;
- (5) it is marketed or promoted as an alternative to federal currency.

(d) **Permitted Instruments.** This section does not prohibit:

- (1) conventional tax credits, rebates, or refunds denominated in dollars;
- (2) non-transferable benefit vouchers (e.g., food assistance, housing vouchers);
- (3) loyalty programs, gift cards, or promotional credits limited to specific vendors;
- (4) Regional bonds, notes, or other debt instruments that are not designed to circulate as currency;
- (5) public utility rate credits applied to specific customer accounts.

(e) **IFC Monitoring.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall:

- (1) monitor Regional fiscal instruments for compliance with this section;
- (2) issue advisory opinions on whether proposed instruments would violate this section;
- (3) refer suspected violations to the Department of Justice for enforcement.

(f) **Enforcement.** Issuance of a prohibited quasi-currency shall result in:

- (1) immediate injunction by federal court;
- (2) mandatory redemption of all outstanding instruments at face value in federal currency;
- (3) civil penalties of up to $10 million per day of continued circulation;
- (4) personal liability for Regional officials who authorized the issuance.

(g) **Federal Reserve Coordination.** The Federal Reserve shall have authority to:

- (1) determine whether an instrument constitutes a prohibited quasi-currency;
- (2) require reporting from Regions on fiscal instruments that approach the thresholds in subsection (c);
- (3) issue cease-and-desist orders for instruments that threaten monetary policy effectiveness.

(h) **Legal Tender Monopoly.** *[See Gap 195.]*

- (1) No Region or State may make any thing other than the Federal Dollar legal tender in payment of debts, whether public or private;
- (2) No Region or State may accept any medium other than the Federal Dollar for the discharge of public taxes, fees, fines, or other obligations owed to the Regional or State government;
- (3) No Region or State may denominate public obligations, contracts, or budgets in any unit of account other than the Federal Dollar;
- (4) No Region or State may establish, sponsor, adopt, or officially endorse any alternative currency, cryptocurrency, commodity money, or medium of exchange as equivalent to or substitute for the Federal Dollar.

(i) **Definition of "Federal Dollar."** For purposes of this section and of this Constitution:

- (1) "Federal Dollar" means the currency issued by the United States Federal Reserve System;
- (2) Digital representations of Federal Dollars issued or authorized by the Federal Reserve are Federal Dollars, subject to the privacy and anti-programmability requirements of Article I, Section 22;
- (3) Private stablecoins, cryptocurrencies, and digital assets are not Federal Dollars regardless of their denomination or peg.

(j) **Private Transactions.** Nothing in this section prohibits:

- (1) private parties from voluntarily transacting in any medium they choose, subject to applicable federal regulation;
- (2) federal regulation of cryptocurrency and digital assets;
- (3) Regional consumer protection laws regarding cryptocurrency fraud.

This subsection limits only governmental acceptance and endorsement, not private economic activity.

---

### Section 14. Fiscal Adequacy Determinations

(a) **Definition of Adequate Funding.** A mandate is adequately funded when the resources provided are reasonably sufficient to achieve substantial compliance with the mandate's requirements without requiring the subordinate government to:

- (1) reduce existing services below minimum standards established by law;
- (2) impose taxes or fees exceeding one hundred ten percent of the regional median for comparable jurisdictions; or
- (3) defer essential infrastructure maintenance or capital replacement.

(b) **Fiscal Adequacy Review Board.** The Inter-Regional Fiscal Court shall establish a Fiscal Adequacy Review Board ("FARB") consisting of:

- (1) three economists appointed by the IFC for staggered six-year terms;
- (2) two former State or Regional budget directors appointed by the Council of Governors; and
- (3) two representatives of municipal governments appointed by the National League of Cities.

(c) **Pre-Enactment Fiscal Adequacy Certification.** Before any Federal or Regional mandate takes effect:

- (1) the enacting authority shall submit a Fiscal Adequacy Statement to the FARB estimating compliance costs and identifying funding sources;
- (2) the FARB shall issue a Fiscal Adequacy Determination within sixty days certifying whether proposed funding is adequate;
- (3) if the FARB certifies funding as inadequate, the mandate shall not take effect until funding is increased to adequate levels or the enacting authority demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the FARB's determination was erroneous.

(d) **Post-Enactment Adequacy Challenges.** Any subordinate government subject to a mandate may petition the FARB for a determination that funding has become inadequate due to:

- (1) increased compliance costs exceeding original estimates by more than twenty percent;
- (2) inflation or economic changes materially affecting compliance costs;
- (3) unforeseen implementation requirements; or
- (4) cumulative burden of multiple mandates affecting the same revenue sources.

(e) **Remedies for Inadequate Funding.** Upon determination that a mandate is inadequately funded:

- (1) the subordinate government may suspend compliance with the underfunded portions until adequate funding is provided;
- (2) the enacting authority shall have one hundred eighty days to cure the funding deficiency;
- (3) if not cured, the mandate becomes unenforceable against the petitioning government;
- (4) no penalty, sanction, or loss of other funding may be imposed for non-compliance with an inadequately funded mandate.

(f) **Anti-Circumvention.** No enacting authority may:

- (1) condition unrelated funding on compliance with inadequately funded mandates;
- (2) impose mandates through guidance, interpretation, or enforcement discretion to avoid fiscal adequacy review;
- (3) fragment mandates into smaller components to avoid cumulative burden analysis.

---

### Section 15. Pre-Ratification Legacy Liabilities

(a) **Legacy Liability Defined.** A "Legacy Liability" is a fiscal or environmental obligation incurred prior to the ratification of this Constitution, specifically including:

- (1) unfunded pension obligations for state and local employees accrued before ratification;
- (2) remediation costs for pre-existing toxic waste or "Superfund" sites designated before ratification;
- (3) decommissioning costs for aging nuclear or industrial facilities constructed before ratification;
- (4) infrastructure debt and deferred maintenance obligations incurred before ratification.

(b) **National Legacy Trust.** There is hereby established a National Legacy Trust ("NLT"), managed by the IFC, to assist Regions burdened by disproportionate industrial or administrative history:

(b-1) **Legacy Burden Factor.** The IFC shall include a "Legacy Burden Factor" in the equalization formula, ensuring that Regions with older infrastructure, higher pension loads, and greater environmental remediation obligations are not fiscally penalized relative to Regions without such historical burdens. The Factor shall be calculated based on:

- (1) per-capita unfunded pension obligations attributable to pre-ratification service;
- (2) per-capita environmental remediation costs for pre-ratification contamination;
- (3) per-capita deferred maintenance on infrastructure constructed before ratification;
- (4) other quantifiable legacy burdens as determined by the IFC.

(b-2) **Federal Backstop for Catastrophic Legacy Harms.** For legacy harms that exceed a Region's fiscal capacity (defined as remediation costs exceeding five percent of Regional GDP), the NLT shall provide direct grants funded by:

- (1) a 0.05% national corporate carbon fee on emissions exceeding sector baselines;
- (2) a 0.05% financial transaction fee on securities trades exceeding $1 million in daily volume;
- (3) appropriations as Congress may provide.

(b-3) **Trust Administration.** The NLT shall:

- (1) receive applications from Regions documenting legacy liabilities;
- (2) verify claims through independent audit;
- (3) prioritize funding based on fiscal impact and public health urgency;
- (4) publish annual reports on legacy liability status nationwide.

(c) **Legacy Liability Sunset.** The Legacy Burden Factor shall be recalculated every ten years and shall phase out over fifty (50) years following ratification:

- (1) the Factor shall remain at full value for the first ten years following ratification;
- (2) beginning in year eleven, the Factor shall decline by two percent (2%) of its initial value annually;
- (3) by year sixty following ratification, the Legacy Burden Factor shall be zero;
- (4) this sunset ensures that legacy equity adjustments address historical burdens without creating permanent entitlements.

(d) **Anti-Manipulation.** No Region may:

- (1) incur new obligations and retroactively classify them as "legacy" liabilities;
- (2) defer maintenance or remediation to increase legacy burden claims;
- (3) manipulate pension assumptions to inflate unfunded liability calculations.
Violations shall result in forfeiture of NLT assistance and clawback of prior disbursements.

---

### Section 16. Forensic Audit Authority and Data Integrity

*[This section establishes forensic audit authority and data integrity requirements for Regional fiscal data submissions. See Gap 129.]*

(a) **Forensic Audit Authority.**

(1) The Independent Fiscal Council (IFC) and Allocation Review Board (ARB) shall possess authority to conduct unannounced forensic audits of Regional data systems;

(2) Audits may examine source records, data entry processes, and algorithmic transformations;

(3) Regions must provide auditors with full system access, including administrative credentials;

(4) Obstruction of forensic audit is treated as admission of data falsification.

(b) **Data Integrity Certification.**

(1) Regional officials certifying data submissions for federal purposes shall attest under penalty of perjury to data accuracy;

(2) Certification must identify the official responsible, data sources used, and any known limitations;

(3) Intentional false certification is a federal felony with mandatory removal from office;

(4) The IFC shall establish Data Integrity Standards that Regions must demonstrate compliance with annually.

(c) **Falsification Consequences.**

(1) Upon IFC or ARB finding of systematic data falsification, the affected Region's "Exclusive Domain" status for the affected sector is automatically suspended for three (3) years;

(2) Federal agencies assume direct data collection authority in the affected sector;

(3) All constitutional determinations made using falsified data are subject to reopening and revision;

(4) The Region must reimburse all equalization transfers received based on falsified data, plus interest and penalties.

(d) **Cross-Verification.**

(1) The IFC shall cross-verify Regional data submissions against:

- (A) Federal tax records;
- (B) Private sector economic indicators (energy consumption, freight volume, financial transactions);
- (C) Adjacent Regions' border-crossing data;
- (D) Satellite and remote sensing data where applicable;

(2) Material discrepancies trigger mandatory audit;

(3) Regions with consistent verification failures are placed on "Enhanced Monitoring" with quarterly audits;

(4) Three consecutive quarters of verification failure creates rebuttable presumption of falsification.

---

### Section 17. Independent Statistical Trust

*[This section establishes an Independent Statistical Trust to prevent fiscal data fraud and ensure the integrity of all statistics used for equalization, apportionment, and federal funding formulae. See Gap 236.]*

(a) **Establishment.** There shall be an Independent Statistical Trust (IST), insulated from political control, responsible for the collection, verification, and certification of all economic, demographic, and social data used for:

(1) Federal apportionment of funds;

(2) Fiscal Equalization calculations;

(3) Congressional representation;

(4) Cost-of-living adjustments to federal programs;

(5) Any constitutional or statutory formula requiring statistical inputs.

(b) **Independence.** The Independent Statistical Trust:

(1) is not part of the Executive Branch and does not report to the President;

(2) has Commissioners serving staggered 10-year terms, removable only for cause by two-thirds vote of the Senate;

(3) has constitutionally guaranteed funding equal to 0.1% of federal discretionary spending, not subject to executive impoundment;

(4) employs career statistical professionals under merit-based civil service protection;

(5) may not receive instructions from any elected official regarding methodology or findings.

(c) **Mandatory Data.** The IST has sole authority to certify:

(1) Regional and State GDP and economic output;

(2) Population counts between decennial censuses;

(3) Unemployment and labor force participation rates;

(4) Consumer price indices and inflation measures;

(5) Tax capacity and fiscal capacity for Equalization;

(6) Any other statistic used in federal funding formulae.

Regional statistics that have not been IST-certified may not be used for federal purposes.

(d) **Access Authority.** The IST:

(1) has unrestricted access to all Regional and State administrative data;

(2) may conduct independent surveys and sampling within any jurisdiction;

(3) may audit Regional statistical agencies at any time without notice;

(4) may subpoena records from private entities for statistical verification;

(5) Regional claims of data sovereignty do not apply to IST access for certification.

(e) **Methodology Transparency.** The IST:

(1) shall publish all methodologies for public review before implementation;

(2) shall submit major methodology changes to a 90-day public comment period;

(3) shall explain all statistical adjustments in public documentation;

(4) shall make microdata available to qualified researchers under privacy protections;

(5) may not classify statistical methodology or certification processes.

(f) **Statistical Fraud as High Crime.** Any official who:

(1) falsifies data submitted to the IST;

(2) obstructs IST access to source records;

(3) pressures IST personnel regarding findings;

(4) manipulates administrative data to distort certified statistics;

(5) retaliates against IST personnel, whistleblowers, or any person reporting suspected violations of this Article — including predatory subsidy activity, equalization manipulation, subsidy ceiling violations, or tax effort misrepresentation

commits a High Crime punishable by imprisonment of 5-20 years and permanent disqualification from public office.

(g) **Cross-Verification.** The IST shall:

(1) cross-verify Regional data against independent sources (tax records, satellite imagery, private economic indicators);

(2) flag statistically implausible claims for mandatory audit;

(3) maintain historical baselines to detect sudden unexplained changes;

(4) publish confidence intervals and uncertainty measures with all certified statistics.

(h) **Consequences of Falsification.** If the IST finds that a Region systematically falsified data:

(1) all Equalization transfers based on falsified data shall be clawed back with interest;

(2) the Region's Equalization receipts shall be reduced by 25% for 5 years;

(3) the Region shall bear costs of IST direct data collection for 10 years;

(4) responsible officials shall be referred for criminal prosecution;

(5) the Region loses voting representation on the Allocation Review Board.

(i) **Federal Statistics.** Federal agencies may not release official statistics that:

(1) contradict IST-certified figures;

(2) use methodologies rejected by IST after public comment;

(3) are produced under political direction regarding outcomes.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics, Census Bureau, and Bureau of Economic Analysis shall coordinate with IST or be absorbed into IST.

---

### Section 18. Full Funding Requirement for Federal Mandates

*[This section establishes the "No Money, No Mandate" rule, prohibiting unfunded federal mandates on Regional, State, and local governments. See Gap 241.]*

(a) **Full Funding Requirement.** Any Federal law, regulation, or Executive order that imposes a financial cost upon Regional, State, or local governments shall include a fully funded Federal appropriation to cover that cost. If the Federal Government does not appropriate funds to cover the implementation cost, the mandate is unenforceable.

(b) **Cost Determination.** For each Federal mandate:

(1) the Congressional Budget Office shall estimate total compliance costs to Regional, State, and local governments over a 10-year horizon;

(2) the estimate shall include direct costs, administrative costs, and opportunity costs;

(3) the estimate shall be published before any floor vote;

(4) Congress shall appropriate the full estimated cost or the mandate does not take effect.

(c) **Conditional Funding Prohibition.** The Federal Government may not:

(1) condition unrelated federal funding on compliance with new mandates;

(2) threaten withdrawal of existing funding to coerce acceptance of unfunded requirements;

(3) structure "voluntary" programs such that non-participation triggers effective penalties;

(4) use spending power to accomplish what would otherwise require unfunded mandate.

Coercive conditional funding arrangements are treated as unfunded mandates subject to this section and are subject to the Non-Coercion Standard of Section 4.

(d) **Regulatory Mandates.** Federal agency regulations imposing costs on Regional, State, or local governments:

(1) are subject to the same full funding requirement as statutory mandates;

(2) may not take effect until Congress appropriates implementation costs;

(3) require explicit statutory authorization--agencies may not independently create mandates;

(4) must include compliance cost estimates certified by the Office of Management and Budget.

(e) **Maintenance of Effort Limitation.** "Maintenance of Effort" requirements that compel Regional spending as condition of federal participation:

(1) may not exceed the level of spending that existed when the federal program began;

(2) must be adjusted for inflation and population changes;

(3) may not be used to ratchet up Regional spending obligations;

(4) expire after 5 years unless explicitly renewed by Congress.

(f) **Partial Funding Accountability.** If Congress provides partial funding for a mandate:

(1) the mandate is enforceable only to the extent of federal funding;

(2) Regions may scale implementation proportionally to funding received;

(3) Federal agencies may not penalize partial compliance due to partial funding;

(4) the gap between mandate and funding must be reported annually to Congress.

(g) **Existing Mandates.** For mandates enacted prior to ratification:

(1) Congress shall review all existing unfunded mandates within 5 years;

(2) each mandate must be either funded, modified to eliminate cost, or repealed;

(3) pending review, existing mandates remain in effect but may not be expanded;

(4) Regions may petition for expedited review of particularly burdensome mandates.

(h) **Enforcement.** Regional, State, and local governments may:

(1) refuse compliance with unfunded mandates without penalty;

(2) seek declaratory judgment that a federal requirement constitutes an unfunded mandate;

(3) recover compliance costs from the Federal Government if compelled to implement unfunded mandate;

(4) obtain injunctive relief against enforcement of unfunded mandates.

(i) **Emergency Exception.** This section does not apply to:

(1) mandates during a declared national emergency, for the duration of the emergency only;

(2) requirements necessary to protect constitutional rights (civil rights enforcement);

(3) mandates that merely prohibit conduct without requiring affirmative spending;

(4) reciprocal obligations incidental to federal grants voluntarily accepted.

(j) **Appropriations Protection.** Appropriations for mandate funding:

(1) may not be rescinded, impounded, or reprogrammed without Congressional action;

(2) are subject to automatic continuing resolution under Section 19 if new appropriation is not enacted;

(3) flow directly to implementing governments without executive discretion;

(4) are indexed to actual compliance costs, with true-up provisions for underestimates.

---

### Section 19. Automatic Continuing Resolution

*[This section constitutionally prohibits government shutdowns and establishes automatic appropriations if Congress fails to enact a budget. See Gap 170.]*

(a) **Prohibition on Shutdowns.** Government shutdowns are constitutionally prohibited. The Federal Government shall not cease operations due to failure to enact appropriations.

(b) **Automatic Appropriation.** If Congress fails to enact an appropriation bill for any department or agency by the first day of the fiscal year, the previous fiscal year's appropriation for that department or agency shall be automatically reenacted at ninety-eight percent (98%) of the prior level.

(c) **Monthly Continuation.** Automatic appropriations under subsection (b) shall continue on a monthly basis until new appropriations are enacted. Each month, the automatic level shall be recalculated at ninety-eight percent (98%) of the prior month's automatic level, creating compounding incentive to reach agreement.

(d) **Essential Functions Protection.** Notwithstanding subsections (b) and (c), the following constitutionally enumerated functions shall receive full appropriations at the prior fiscal year's enacted level, adjusted annually by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or by a successor index designated by statute:

(1) border security and immigration enforcement;

(2) interstate commerce regulation and enforcement;

(3) federal court operations, including the Constitutional Court, the Autonomy Review Board, and all Article III courts;

(4) election administration, including the Independent Electoral Commission;

(5) equalization payment processing and disbursement;

(6) debt service and existing obligation payments.

Congress may add functions to this list by two-thirds vote of both chambers, subject to judicial review for consistency with constitutional purposes. Removal from this list requires constitutional amendment.

(e) **No New Programs or Expansions.** During any period of automatic appropriation:

(1) no new programs, agencies, or spending initiatives may be funded;

(2) no existing programs may be expanded beyond their prior-year scope;

(3) no new obligations extending beyond the current fiscal year may be created;

(4) automatic appropriation authority extends only to programs authorized by Congress prior to the lapse in appropriations.

(f) **No Retroactive Reduction.** Obligations incurred and compensation earned during periods of automatic appropriation shall not be subject to retroactive reduction if a subsequent appropriation is enacted at a lower level.

(g) **Borrowing Authority.** Automatic appropriations under this Section shall be deemed appropriations authorized by Congress for purposes of Article I, Section 20. The Treasury shall have full borrowing authority to execute automatic appropriations on the same terms as legislated appropriations.

(h) **Termination.** Automatic appropriations terminate immediately upon enactment of regular appropriations for the affected fiscal year. Partial appropriations (covering some but not all departments or agencies) terminate automatic appropriation only for the departments or agencies covered by the enacted legislation.

(i) **Unauthorized Military Operations Exclusion.** Automatic appropriations under this section shall not fund military operations for which authorization under Article XI, Section 2, has expired, been terminated, or was never granted. The Comptroller General shall identify and quarantine such expenditures within thirty days of the commencement of any automatic appropriation period. Funds necessary for the orderly withdrawal of forces under Article XI, Section 2(j), are not subject to this exclusion.

*[Subsections (j)-(o) establish mandatory disbursement timelines, prohibit executive delay tactics during automatic appropriation periods, and provide layered remedies including IFC disbursement authority, Regional self-help offset, and personal liability. See Gap 112.]*

(j) **Mandatory Disbursement Schedule.** Funds under automatic appropriation pursuant to this Section:

- (1) shall be disbursed according to the prior fiscal year's disbursement schedule, adjusted proportionally to reflect the applicable rate under subsection (b) or the full-funding level under subsection (d), as appropriate. The Department of the Treasury shall publish each program's prior-year disbursement schedule within thirty (30) days of the commencement of any automatic appropriation period. For programs without a prior-year disbursement schedule — including programs first funded in the last-enacted appropriation — funds shall be disbursed in equal monthly installments on the first business day of each month;
- (2) no administrative hold, review, audit, or other executive action may delay any scheduled disbursement by more than fourteen (14) calendar days from the date disbursement was due under the prior fiscal year's schedule or the default schedule under paragraph (1). For essential function appropriations under subsection (d), no administrative hold may delay disbursement by more than seven (7) calendar days;
- (3) an administrative hold exceeding the applicable limit under paragraph (2) requires authorization from the Constitutional Court based on a finding, by clear and convincing evidence, of actual fraud or material misuse of previously disbursed funds by the recipient — pending audits, procedural concerns, documentation deficiencies, or incomplete review do not constitute sufficient grounds. The Constitutional Court shall rule on any hold request within ten (10) business days of filing. If the Court does not rule within ten (10) business days, the hold request lapses by operation of law and the funds shall be disbursed immediately;
- (4) for purposes of this subsection, "disbursement" means the transfer of funds to the recipient's account, not the initiation of internal processing. Compliance is measured by the date funds are available to the recipient, not the date the disbursing agency begins processing;
- (5) disbursement of less than ninety-five percent (95%) of the scheduled amount by the scheduled date constitutes a failure to disburse under this subsection, unless the shortfall is attributable to a valid judicial hold under paragraph (3).

(k) **Prohibited Delay Tactics.** During any period of automatic appropriation under this Section, executive agencies and the Department of the Treasury may not:

- (1) require documentation from any Region, agency, or other recipient that exceeds the documentation required for the corresponding disbursement in the prior fiscal year;
- (2) impose compliance reviews, audits, certifications, or reporting requirements not applicable to the prior fiscal year's disbursements;
- (3) apply disbursement processing standards, timelines, review procedures, or staffing levels that differ among Regions or among recipients of the same program, unless such differences existed in the prior fiscal year;
- (4) reclassify expenditure categories, reallocate appropriation line items, or restructure disbursement accounts in a manner that delays fund release;
- (5) require reauthorization of standing disbursement arrangements, intergovernmental transfer agreements, or direct-deposit instructions that were in effect during the prior fiscal year;
- (6) delegate disbursement authority to a new office, agency, or intermediary not involved in disbursement during the prior fiscal year.

Paragraphs (1) and (2) do not prohibit compliance with requirements imposed by statute enacted after the prior fiscal year or by court order, provided that such requirements do not delay disbursement beyond the limits established by subsection (j)(2). Executive agencies invoking this exception shall bear the burden of demonstrating that the new requirement is mandated by a specific statutory provision or court order, not by executive discretion, and shall implement it in a manner that does not exceed the hold periods established by this Section.

(l) **Delay Presumption.** Administrative delay of any automatic appropriation disbursement exceeding fourteen (14) calendar days beyond the scheduled date:

- (1) is presumptively a violation of this Section;
- (2) shifts the burden of proof to the responsible executive agency to demonstrate, by clear and convincing evidence, that the delay is justified by actual fraud or material misuse;
- (3) creates immediate remedy eligibility under subsections (m) and (n).

(m) **Independent Disbursement Authority.** If any executive agency or the Department of the Treasury fails to disburse automatic appropriation funds within the fourteen (14) day limit established by subsection (j)(2):

- (1) the Independent Fiscal Council shall, upon petition by any affected Region or upon its own initiative, order the Department of the Treasury to disburse the withheld funds within five (5) business days;
- (2) an IFC disbursement order under this subsection is self-executing and may not be stayed, reversed, or modified by any executive officer, including the President;
- (3) the IFC shall maintain standing contingency procedures for emergency disbursement, including verified electronic transfer capabilities, to ensure operational readiness;
- (4) if the Department of the Treasury fails to comply with an IFC disbursement order within five (5) business days, any affected Region may petition the Constitutional Court for a mandatory injunction. The Court shall hear the petition within forty-eight (48) hours and shall issue the injunction unless the executive demonstrates actual fraud or material misuse by clear and convincing evidence;
- (5) the IFC's authority under this subsection extends to all funds subject to automatic appropriation, including essential function appropriations under subsection (d) and monthly continuation adjustments under subsection (c);
- (6) the IFC's authority under this subsection does not extend to funds subject to a valid judicial hold issued by the Constitutional Court under subsection (j)(3). The IFC may not order disbursement of funds that a court has specifically held pending a finding of actual fraud or material misuse. If the judicial hold subsequently lapses — including by operation of the ten (10) business day deadline under subsection (j)(3) — or is vacated, the IFC's authority over those funds is restored immediately.

(n) **Regional Offset Authority.** If disbursement is delayed beyond thirty (30) calendar days notwithstanding the remedies under subsection (m):

- (1) the affected Region may offset the delayed amount against the Region's next scheduled fiscal obligations to the federal government, limited to shared-revenue contributions, intergovernmental transfer payments, penalty assessments, and other fiscal obligations that the Region directly pays to the federal government. Offsets may not be applied against federal taxes collected directly from individuals or entities within the Region by the Internal Revenue Service or successor agency;
- (2) offset funds shall be held in a segregated escrow account by the Region, established under IFC supervision, pending judicial resolution under subsection (o) or full federal disbursement, whichever occurs first. If the IFC is unable to supervise the escrow account due to institutional incapacity, the Constitutional Court shall designate an alternate escrow custodian from among the federal courts or an independent fiduciary approved by the Court;
- (3) the offset amount may not exceed the documented amount of delayed federal disbursement, calculated using the prior year's schedule as the benchmark;
- (4) offset authority terminates immediately upon full federal disbursement, and all escrowed funds shall be released to the federal government within ten (10) business days of disbursement completion;
- (5) a Region's exercise of offset authority under this subsection is not a violation of Article XII (Secession and De-Escalation) or Article XXIV (Union Permanence and Orderly Alteration) and shall not be treated as an act of nullification or non-compliance with federal fiscal obligations. This subsection provides a constitutionally authorized self-help remedy operative only during documented executive failure to perform a mandatory disbursement obligation.

(o) **Enforcement and Judicial Review.**

- (1) Either party may seek expedited judicial review before the Constitutional Court:
    - (i) of whether federal disbursement delay was justified under the actual-fraud-or-misuse standard;
    - (ii) of whether any Regional offset under subsection (n) was proportional and properly calculated;
    - (iii) review shall be completed within thirty (30) days of filing.
- (2) Executive officials who direct, authorize, or knowingly maintain disbursement delay in violation of this Section are personally liable in civil actions brought by affected Regions. Personal liability requires proof by preponderance of the evidence that the official (i) held authority over the delayed disbursement, and (ii) acted with knowledge that the delay violated subsection (j) or continued the delay after receiving an IFC disbursement order under subsection (m).
- (3) Affected individuals whose compensation, benefits, or program entitlements were delayed or terminated as a result of a disbursement delay that violated this Section may bring civil actions for damages against the responsible federal agency. Prevailing plaintiffs shall recover reasonable attorney fees and litigation costs.
- (4) The Attorney General may bring enforcement actions under this subsection independently of any Regional petition. Enforcement actions by the Attorney General are not subject to the prior IFC petition requirement of subsection (m)(1).

### Section 20. Actuarial Honesty and Pension Discipline

*[This section prevents the accumulation of unfunded pension and retiree benefit liabilities through mandatory accrual funding, realistic actuarial assumptions, and automatic correction mechanisms. See Gap 202.]*

(a) **Full Accrual Funding Requirement.** All public pension systems, retiree healthcare systems, and other long-term employee benefit obligations of Regional, State, and local governments shall be funded on a current accrual basis:

- (1) the Annual Required Contribution (ARC) shall be calculated using actuarial standards promulgated by the Pension Actuarial Division of the Independent Fiscal Council;
- (2) governments shall contribute one hundred percent (100%) of the ARC each fiscal year;
- (3) failure to contribute one hundred percent (100%) of the ARC constitutes a fiscal violation subject to the intervention hierarchy under Section 10 of this Article.

(b) **Discount Rate Standards.** For purposes of calculating pension and benefit liabilities:

- (1) the discount rate shall be the yield on twenty-year Treasury bonds, plus a risk premium not to exceed one hundred (100) basis points;
- (2) assumed investment returns may not exceed historical thirty-year rolling averages for the pension system's actual asset allocation;
- (3) mortality assumptions shall use the most recent federal actuarial tables without modification;
- (4) the IFC shall audit discount rate assumptions annually.

Actuarial assumptions that systematically understate liabilities are prohibited.

(c) **Unfunded Liability Amortization.** Existing unfunded liabilities as of ratification shall be:

- (1) amortized over a maximum of twenty (20) years using level-dollar amortization;
- (2) included as a separate line item in Regional, State, and local budgets;
- (3) subject to annual progress reporting to the IFC.

No new unfunded liability may be created. Benefit enhancements must be fully funded at the time of enactment. Pre-ratification unfunded pension obligations are also subject to the Legacy Burden Factor under Section 15 of this Article, which provides equalization support but does not excuse the amortization obligation.

(d) **Automatic Contribution Trigger.** If a government fails to make its full ARC:

- (1) employee and employer contribution rates automatically increase by the shortfall percentage, divided equally;
- (2) the automatic increase takes effect the following fiscal year;
- (3) the government may override the automatic increase only by enacting equivalent benefit reductions or alternative funding sources certified as actuarially sufficient by the IFC;
- (4) failure to cure within two (2) fiscal years triggers enhanced oversight under Section 10 of this Article.

No government may manipulate its ARC calculation through assumption changes for the purpose of avoiding the automatic contribution trigger. The IFC may disregard assumption changes made within twelve (12) months of a trigger event if the changes lack independent actuarial justification.

(e) **Benefit Enhancement Restrictions.** No Regional, State, or local government may:

- (1) enhance pension or benefit formulas unless the enhancement is fully funded by increased contributions or reduced benefits elsewhere, as certified by the IFC;
- (2) allow pension spiking through artificial inflation of final average salary, including through overtime, unused leave payouts, or temporary reclassification;
- (3) grant retroactive benefit enhancements applying to service already rendered;
- (4) issue pension obligation bonds without IFC certification that the issuance improves net actuarial position over the full amortization period.

(f) **Transparency Requirements.** All public pension systems shall:

- (1) publish annual actuarial reports using standardized formats promulgated by the IFC;
- (2) disclose funded ratios, unfunded liabilities, and amortization schedules prominently in annual budgets;
- (3) provide thirty-year projections under assumptions certified by the IFC;
- (4) make all actuarial data available for independent analysis.

(g) **Enforcement.** Pension funding violations are subject to the fiscal intervention hierarchy under Section 10 of this Article. For purposes of Section 10:

- (1) failure to contribute one hundred percent (100%) of the ARC for a single fiscal year constitutes a fiscal condition warranting Stage 1 (Capacity Adjustment) review;
- (2) persistent ARC shortfalls exceeding two (2) consecutive fiscal years constitute fiscal negligence warranting Stage 2 review;
- (3) unfunded liability ratios exceeding seventy-five percent (75%) of annual Regional revenue, as calculated by the IFC, constitute grounds for Stage 3 (Solvency Suspension) consideration;
- (4) officials who knowingly approve inadequate contributions, or who knowingly submit false actuarial data, are subject to personal liability and removal under the same standards applicable to fiscal negligence under Section 10.

(h) **Relationship to Sovereign Reorganization.** In any Sovereign Reorganization proceeding under Section 6(j), pension obligations:

- (1) are subject to the priority ordering established by Section 6(j)(6);
- (2) may be modified only prospectively for future benefit accruals, not retroactively for benefits already earned;
- (3) must maintain minimum benefit floors established by the IFC;
- (4) may not be discharged entirely—some pension recovery is required even in insolvency.

### Section 21. Fiscal Adaptation to Non-Human Economic Output

*Resolves Gap 212 — Post-Labor Crash (Robot Tax Gap). Ensures the fiscal architecture remains viable as economic output shifts from taxable human labor to automated systems.*

(a) **Taxing Authority.** Congress may impose excise taxes and duties on non-human economic output — value generated by automated, algorithmic, or autonomous systems without proportional human labor input. Such taxes are not direct taxes requiring apportionment among the Regions. This power is in addition to existing taxing authority under Section 1 of this Article.

(b) **Fiscal Capacity Modernization.** For purposes of Fiscal Equalization under this Article:

- (1) "Fiscal Capacity" includes non-human economic output, not only human income and consumption;
- (2) non-human economic output shall be attributed to Regions using market-based sourcing consistent with the apportionment methodology under Section 3(r) of this Article: value is attributed to the Region where the good is consumed or the service is delivered;
- (3) the Independent Fiscal Council shall develop and maintain measurement methodologies for non-human economic output, subject to the transparency requirements of Article II, Section 7-A.

(c) **Displacement Mitigation.** Revenue derived from taxation of non-human economic output shall be dedicated to mitigating labor displacement and ensuring social stability during economic transitions. Congress shall determine the specific allocation by statute.

(d) **Anti-Arbitrage.** To prevent erosion of the tax base through automation-specific structuring:

- (1) economic substance, not legal entity location, determines tax attribution;
- (2) artificial structures that shift the nominal source of automated value — including intellectual property holding arrangements, licensing schemes, and intercompany transfers — shall be disregarded for tax purposes;
- (3) consolidated reporting is required for related automated systems operating across Regions;
- (4) Congress shall establish a minimum effective tax rate on non-human economic output; no Region may undercut this floor through incentives or exemptions.

These provisions supplement the anti-haven protections under Section 3(r) and Section 11-A of this Article.

(e) **Technological Neutrality.** This section does not prohibit automation or technological development, require human labor where automation is more efficient, or penalize productivity improvements. The purpose is fiscal neutrality: the tax base shall reflect actual economic output regardless of whether that output is produced by human labor, automated systems, or any combination thereof.

(f) **Border Adjustment.** Congress shall establish a technological border adjustment mechanism imposing equivalent levies on goods and services produced by non-human systems abroad and imported into the United Regions, to prevent offshore arbitrage that would undermine the domestic tax base under this section.

(g) **Institutional Coordination.** The Emerging Technology Review Board (Article II, Section 9) shall classify technologies as generating "non-human economic output" for purposes of this section. The Independent Fiscal Council shall develop valuation methodologies and measurement standards for classified technologies. The ETRB's domain assignment authority under Article II, Section 9 does not limit federal fiscal authority under this section.

(h) **Activation.** The taxing authority under subsection (a) becomes operative when the Independent Fiscal Council certifies that non-human economic output constitutes a material share of gross domestic product or that labor force participation has declined materially from the date of ratification. Congress shall establish the specific thresholds for activation by statute. The fiscal capacity modernization under subsection (b) and measurement infrastructure under subsection (g) take effect immediately upon ratification.

(i) **Constitutional Floor.** The transition from human to automated economic output shall not erode the fiscal capacity of the Union below levels necessary for constitutional functions. If the Independent Fiscal Council determines that the existing tax base is insufficient to fund essential services and equalization obligations, it shall declare a fiscal capacity emergency. Congress shall act within one hundred eighty (180) days to restore adequate revenue. If Congress fails to act within that period, the automatic appropriation provisions of Section 19 of this Article shall apply, supplemented by a temporary surcharge on non-human economic output at a rate determined by the IFC, not to exceed the rate necessary to restore fiscal adequacy.

## Design Rationale

### Why Independent Taxing Authority?

Fiscal dependence creates political dependence. If Regions rely on federal transfers for basic operations:

- federal government gains coercive leverage
- Regional policy independence becomes illusory
- political accountability becomes confused

Independent taxing authority ensures each level can fund its constitutional responsibilities without permission from other levels.

### Why Prohibit Unfunded Mandates?

Unfunded mandates allow higher levels of government to:

- impose costs on lower levels without political accountability
- claim credit for programs while shifting blame for funding
- effectively expand their power beyond enumerated limits

The prohibition makes the mandating government internalize costs, creating political accountability for its decisions.

### Why Equalization Transfers?

Without equalization, poorer Regions cannot provide basic governmental services:

- courts, elections, emergency services require minimum scale
- extreme inequality undermines national cohesion
- citizens in poor Regions become second-class

Equalization ensures baseline capacity everywhere while preserving fiscal independence for expenditures above the floor.

### Why Formula-Based Rather Than Discretionary?

Discretionary transfers become:

- political patronage tools
- subject to partisan manipulation
- unpredictable for recipient planning

Formula-based transfers create predictability, remove political discretion, and ensure equal treatment of similarly situated Regions.

### Why the Anti-Coercion Rule?

Conditional funding has been used to:

- compel states to adopt federal policies (drinking age, speed limits)
- expand federal authority beyond enumerated powers
- create effective federal control over nominally state functions

The anti-coercion rule prevents conditional funding from becoming a back door to unconstitutional federal expansion.

## Implementation Guidance

### Fiscal Equalization Act Requirements

Congress shall enact a Fiscal Equalization Act establishing:

**Formula Components:**

- measure of Regional fiscal capacity (tax base relative to costs)
- measure of Regional fiscal need (population, geography, service costs)
- equalization target (e.g., bring all Regions to median fiscal capacity)

**Process Requirements:**

- annual calculation by Independent Fiscal Council
- automatic appropriation (mandatory spending)
- formula revision only by supermajority vote

**Accountability:**

- annual reporting on transfers and Regional fiscal status
- auditing by Government Accountability Office
- five-year review cycle for formula adequacy

### Default Rule (Article XXI)

If Congress fails to enact the Fiscal Equalization Act within three years of ratification:

- equalization transfers shall be calculated as flat per-capita grants
- baseline level: five percent of federal revenues
- distributed to Regions with below-median fiscal capacity
- rate declines by one percentage point per year beginning in year six
- floor of two percent to incentivize congressional action
