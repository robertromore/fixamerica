# Fiscal System

## Article X: Fiscal Architecture

*This document contains the fiscal architecture provisions of the Regional Federal Constitution. For standalone tax reform principles, see [Tax Reform](../../../../single-topic/tax-reform/).*

## ARTICLE X - FISCAL ARCHITECTURE

### Section 1. Independent Taxing Authority

Each level of government-federal, Regional, State, local-shall possess independent taxing authority sufficient to fulfill its enumerated responsibilities.

---

### Section 2. No Unfunded Mandates

Mandates imposed on subordinate governments without adequate funding are unenforceable.

---

### Section 3. Equalization

Automatic, formula-based equalization transfers shall ensure baseline governing capacity across Regions.

---

### Section 3-A. Small Region Support

(a) Equalization transfers under Section 3 shall include a minimum floor for each Region, regardless of formula calculations, sufficient to fund:

- basic Regional administrative functions,
- Regional court operations,
- Regional Guard minimum readiness requirements,
- participation in inter-Regional coordination bodies.

(b) This floor shall be established by statute and may not be reduced below the level necessary to maintain functioning Regional governance.

(c) Small Regions may pool resources through inter-Regional agreements for:

- specialized court functions,
- technical expertise,
- infrastructure management,
- higher education coordination.

(d) Pooling agreements under this section require no federal approval and do not constitute merger.

(e) For purposes of this section, a "Small Region" is one that meets either:

- (1) population below five percent of the total population of the United States, or
- (2) fiscal capacity below the median fiscal capacity of all Regions.

(f) Fiscal capacity shall be measured by the Independent Fiscal Council using a formula that accounts for tax base, cost of living, and geographic factors. The formula shall be established by statute and reviewed every ten years.

### Section 4. Anti-Coercion Rule

Conditional funding that effectively compels unrelated policy compliance is unconstitutional.

---

## Design Rationale

### Why Independent Taxing Authority?

Fiscal dependence creates political dependence. If Regions rely on federal transfers for basic operations:

- federal government gains coercive leverage
- Regional policy independence becomes illusory
- political accountability becomes confused

Independent taxing authority ensures each level can fund its constitutional responsibilities without permission from other levels.

### Why Prohibit Unfunded Mandates?

Unfunded mandates allow higher levels of government to:

- impose costs on lower levels without political accountability
- claim credit for programs while shifting blame for funding
- effectively expand their power beyond enumerated limits

The prohibition makes the mandating government internalize costs, creating political accountability for its decisions.

### Why Equalization Transfers?

Without equalization, poorer Regions cannot provide basic governmental services:

- courts, elections, emergency services require minimum scale
- extreme inequality undermines national cohesion
- citizens in poor Regions become second-class

Equalization ensures baseline capacity everywhere while preserving fiscal independence for expenditures above the floor.

### Why Formula-Based Rather Than Discretionary?

Discretionary transfers become:

- political patronage tools
- subject to partisan manipulation
- unpredictable for recipient planning

Formula-based transfers create predictability, remove political discretion, and ensure equal treatment of similarly situated Regions.

### Why the Anti-Coercion Rule?

Conditional funding has been used to:

- compel states to adopt federal policies (drinking age, speed limits)
- expand federal authority beyond enumerated powers
- create effective federal control over nominally state functions

The anti-coercion rule prevents conditional funding from becoming a back door to unconstitutional federal expansion.

## Implementation Guidance

### Fiscal Equalization Act Requirements

Congress shall enact a Fiscal Equalization Act establishing:

**Formula Components:**

- measure of Regional fiscal capacity (tax base relative to costs)
- measure of Regional fiscal need (population, geography, service costs)
- equalization target (e.g., bring all Regions to median fiscal capacity)

**Process Requirements:**

- annual calculation by Independent Fiscal Council
- automatic appropriation (mandatory spending)
- formula revision only by supermajority vote

**Accountability:**

- annual reporting on transfers and Regional fiscal status
- auditing by Government Accountability Office
- five-year review cycle for formula adequacy

### Default Rule (Article XXI)

If Congress fails to enact the Fiscal Equalization Act within three years of ratification:

- equalization transfers shall be calculated as flat per-capita grants
- baseline level: five percent of federal revenues
- distributed to Regions with below-median fiscal capacity
- rate declines by one percentage point per year beginning in year six
- floor of two percent to incentivize congressional action
