## ARTICLE X - FISCAL ARCHITECTURE

### Section 1. Independent Taxing Authority

Each level of government-federal, Regional, State, local-shall possess independent taxing authority sufficient to fulfill its enumerated responsibilities.

#### Regional Revenue Protection

(a) **Prohibition on Targeted Fiscal Nullification.** No State shall enact any law, credit, rebate, deduction, or exemption that:

(1) Specifically targets, offsets, or neutralizes Regional tax liabilities;

(2) Provides tax benefits conditioned on payment of Regional taxes;

(3) Creates priority schemes that systematically subordinate Regional tax collection to State collection;

(4) Offers location-based incentives designed to erode the Regional tax base within the State.

(b) **Rebuttable Presumption.** A State tax provision shall be presumed to violate subsection (a) if:

(1) It was enacted within twenty-four (24) months of a Regional tax increase or new Regional tax;

(2) Its fiscal impact falls disproportionately (greater than 75%) on Regional revenue rather than Federal or general State revenue;

(3) Legislative history or public statements by sponsors reference Regional tax policy.

(c) **Permitted State Tax Policy.** Nothing in this section shall prevent States from:

(1) Establishing general tax credits, deductions, or exemptions that apply regardless of Regional tax status;

(2) Setting State tax rates at any level, including zero;

(3) Competing for business through general economic development incentives not targeted at Regional tax avoidance.

#### Regional Tax Collection Priority

(d) **Concurrent Collection Authority.** Regions shall have independent authority to:

(1) Assess and collect Regional taxes directly from taxpayers without State intermediation;

(2) Establish Regional tax administration agencies with full enforcement powers;

(3) File liens, levy assets, and pursue collection remedies independently of State tax authorities.

(e) **Lien Parity.** Regional tax liens shall have equal priority with State tax liens:

(1) When Regional and State liens attach to the same property on the same date, they share pro rata;

(2) When liens attach on different dates, priority follows standard first-in-time rules regardless of governmental level;

(3) No State may establish categorical priority for State liens over Regional liens.

(f) **Anti-Subordination Clause.** No State bankruptcy, receivership, or fiscal emergency proceeding may subordinate Regional tax claims to State claims or general creditors.

---

### Section 2. No Unfunded Mandates

Mandates imposed on subordinate governments without adequate funding are unenforceable.

---

### Section 3. Equalization

Automatic, formula-based equalization transfers shall ensure baseline governing capacity across Regions.

#### National Benefits Spine Fiscal Alignment

(a) **Co-Payment Requirement.** For any program funded through the National Benefits Spine, the administering Region shall contribute a co-payment from Regional own-source revenue according to the following schedule:

(1) Regions with fiscal capacity above 110% of national median: 20% co-payment;

(2) Regions with fiscal capacity between 90-110% of national median: 15% co-payment;

(3) Regions with fiscal capacity below 90% of national median: 10% co-payment;

(4) Small Regions receiving equalization transfers under Section 3-A: 5% co-payment (minimum).

(b) **Effect on Incentives.** The co-payment requirement ensures that Regional governments bear marginal fiscal consequences for program expansion decisions, aligning authority over administration with responsibility for costs.

#### Efficiency-Indexed Federal Contributions

(c) **Outcome-Based Funding.** The federal government shall provide National Benefits Spine funding sufficient to achieve specified outcome floors at the National Median cost-per-outcome, adjusted for Regional Purchasing Power Parity.

(d) **Purchasing Power Parity Adjustment.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall annually calculate a Regional Cost Index reflecting differences in labor costs, real estate costs, and input prices across Regions. All efficiency comparisons shall use PPP-adjusted figures.

(e) **Funding Adjustment Based on Efficiency.**

(1) **Efficient Regions:** If a Region achieves outcome floors at below-median PPP-adjusted cost, the Region retains 50% of the savings as unrestricted Regional revenue;

(2) **Inefficient Regions:** If a Region exceeds median PPP-adjusted cost while achieving outcome floors, federal funding covers only the median cost; the Region must fund the excess from own-source revenue;

(3) **Underperforming Regions:** If a Region fails to achieve outcome floors regardless of spending, the Region enters Performance Improvement Status.

#### Subsidy-Neutrality Adjustment

(f) **Subsidy-Neutrality Adjustment.** Equalization formulas shall account for Regional tax expenditures:

(1) "Tax expenditures" include tax credits, exemptions, abatements, and other preferential treatments that reduce tax liability for specific industries or firms;

(2) Tax expenditures exceeding two percent (2%) of Regional GDP shall be added back to calculated tax capacity for equalization purposes;

(3) This adjustment treats the Region as if it had collected the forgone revenue.

(g) **Tax Expenditure Reporting.** Each Region shall report annually:

(1) All tax expenditures by category and amount;

(2) The industries or firms benefiting from each expenditure;

(3) The stated policy rationale for each expenditure.

(h) **IFC Verification.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall:

(1) Verify Regional tax expenditure reports;

(2) Apply the subsidy-neutrality adjustment to equalization calculations;

(3) Publish comparative tax expenditure analyses across Regions.

#### Predatory Subsidy Prohibition

(i) **Predatory Subsidy Prohibition.** Regions may not offer subsidies:

(1) Explicitly conditioned on relocation from another Region;

(2) Available only to firms relocating from specific other Regions;

(3) Structured to match or exceed subsidies offered by other Regions in bidding wars.

(j) **Relocation Subsidy Definition.** A subsidy is "conditioned on relocation" if:

(1) The subsidy agreement references the firm's current location;

(2) The subsidy is available only to firms not currently operating in the Region;

(3) The subsidy amount varies based on the firm's origin Region.

(k) **Total Subsidy Ceiling.** Regional tax expenditures and direct subsidies combined:

(1) May not exceed five percent (5%) of Regional GDP in any fiscal year;

(2) May not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of Regional tax revenue;

(3) The lower of the two limits applies.

---

### Section 3-A. Small Region Support

(a) Equalization transfers under Section 3 shall include a minimum floor for each Region, regardless of formula calculations, sufficient to fund:

- basic Regional administrative functions,
- Regional court operations,
- Regional Guard minimum readiness requirements,
- participation in inter-Regional coordination bodies.

(b) This floor shall be established by statute and may not be reduced below the level necessary to maintain functioning Regional governance.

(c) Small Regions may pool resources through inter-Regional agreements for:

- specialized court functions,
- technical expertise,
- infrastructure management,
- higher education coordination.

(d) Pooling agreements under this section require no federal approval and do not constitute merger.

(e) **Federal Institutional Capacity Support.** For any Region with population below two percent of the total population of the United States:

- (1) The federal government shall provide supplemental funding for Regional court operations, including judicial salaries, court facilities, and administrative staff, sufficient to ensure access to justice equivalent to that available in larger Regions;
- (2) The federal government shall provide technical assistance and shared personnel for specialized regulatory functions that require expertise not economically sustainable at small-region scale;
- (3) Regional Guard forces may be supplemented by federal reserve components under Regional Governor command for non-federalized operations, pursuant to agreement between the Region and the Department of Defense;
- (4) This support is an entitlement, not subject to annual appropriation discretion, and shall be funded through mandatory spending.

(f) **Mandatory Pooling for Critical Functions.** Regions with population below two percent of the total population shall enter into pooling agreements with at least one adjacent Region for:

- (1) appellate court operations (trial courts may remain independent),
- (2) specialized law enforcement functions (forensics, cybercrime),
- (3) emergency management coordination.

Such pooling shall preserve each Region's sovereignty and independent governance; pooled functions operate under joint authority with equal Regional representation regardless of population.

(g) For purposes of this section, a "Small Region" is one that meets either:

- (1) population below five percent of the total population of the United States, or
- (2) fiscal capacity below the median fiscal capacity of all Regions.

(h) Fiscal capacity shall be measured by the Independent Fiscal Council using a formula that accounts for tax base, cost of living, and geographic factors. The formula shall be established by statute and reviewed every ten years.

---

### Section 4. Anti-Coercion Rule

Conditional funding that effectively compels unrelated policy compliance is unconstitutional.

---

### Section 5. Independent Fiscal Council

(a) There is hereby established an Independent Fiscal Council (IFC) consisting of seven members appointed as follows:

- (1) two members appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate,
- (2) two members appointed by the Speaker of the House,
- (3) two members appointed by a majority vote of all Regional Governors, and
- (4) one member selected by unanimous agreement of the other six members, who shall serve as Chair.

(b) Members shall serve staggered seven-year terms and may be removed only for cause by a two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress.

(c) The Council shall:

- (2) certify equalization transfer calculations under Section 3,
- (3) determine Small Region qualification under Section 3-A(e),
- (4) advise Congress on fiscal federalism matters,
- (5) publish annual reports on the fiscal status of each Region and the effectiveness of equalization transfers.

(d) Council determinations under subsections (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) shall be final and not subject to political override, but may be challenged in federal court for procedural error or constitutional violation.

(e) The Council shall operate with full budgetary independence and shall receive automatic appropriations equal to 0.01% of equalization transfers or $50 million (indexed to inflation), whichever is greater.

(n) **Debt Maturity Requirements.** Regional debt shall:

(1) Have average weighted maturity not exceeding twenty years;

(2) Include no provisions that defer all principal repayment beyond ten years;

(3) These requirements ensure current generations bear current costs.

#### Off-Balance-Sheet Debt Controls

(o) **Consolidated Fiscal Reporting.** For purposes of all debt limits, ceilings, and monitoring under this Article, "Regional debt" includes:

(1) All direct obligations of the Regional government;

(2) All obligations of any Regional authority, agency, corporation, or instrumentality created by or on behalf of the Region, regardless of formal legal separation;

(3) All revenue bonds issued by entities in which the Region has an ownership interest, exercises control, or for which Regional action was required for creation;

(4) All public-private partnership obligations where the Region bears contingent liability, guarantees revenue, or provides availability payments;

(5) All lease-purchase agreements, certificates of participation, and similar financing arrangements;

(6) The proportionate share of any multi-Regional financing entity's obligations based on the Region's participation.

(p) **Independent Infrastructure Authority Restrictions.**

(1) No Region may create or authorize the creation of an independent authority, corporation, or special district for the primary purpose of issuing debt that would not be included in Regional debt calculations;

(2) Any entity created by Regional action that issues debt exceeding $100 million shall be presumed to be a Regional instrumentality subject to consolidated reporting;

(3) The IFC may pierce the corporate form of any entity and attribute its debt to the creating Region if:

### Section 7. Financial Conservatorship

#### Systemic Risk Limits

(a) **Mandatory Fiscal Limits.**

(1) The Independent Fiscal Council shall establish and publish mandatory debt-to-GDP ratios for all Regions, not to exceed eighty percent of Regional GDP;

(2) Regional Development Banks shall maintain leverage ratios not exceeding those applicable to federally-chartered banks;

(3) Regions must submit annual fiscal sustainability reports to the IFC demonstrating compliance;

(4) The IFC may adjust ratios based on economic conditions but may not waive limits entirely.

#### Automatic Conservatorship

(b) **Financial Conservatorship Trigger.**

(1) Exceeding the debt-to-GDP ratio by ten percent or more triggers automatic "Financial Conservatorship" status;

(2) During Conservatorship, the IFC assumes authority over:

- (A) All new Regional borrowing and bond issuance;
- (B) Regional Development Bank operations and lending policies;
- (C) Budget approval for expenditures exceeding operational minimums;

(3) Conservatorship continues until the Region returns to compliance for two consecutive fiscal years;

(4) Regional officials may not incur new obligations without IFC approval during Conservatorship.

#### Anti-Extortion Provisions

(c) **Contagion Risk Limitation.**

(1) No Region may condition fiscal responsibility on federal policy concessions;

(2) Threats of "disorderly default" to extract transfers or exemptions constitute grounds for immediate Conservatorship;

(3) The IFC may pre-emptively impose Conservatorship upon finding evidence of deliberate over-leveraging for coercive purposes;

(4) Equalization transfers shall not be increased to remedy self-inflicted fiscal crises caused by deliberate over-borrowing.

#### Orderly Resolution

(d) **Structured Resolution.**

(1) If a Region in Conservatorship cannot achieve fiscal sustainability, the IFC may implement orderly resolution including:

- (A) Mandatory debt restructuring with haircuts distributed equitably among bondholders;
- (B) Temporary federal assumption of essential services;
- (C) Asset sales from Regional Development Banks;

(2) Resolution shall not include unlimited federal bailouts or transfer increases;

(3) The resolution process shall impose costs on the failing Region proportionate to its contribution to the crisis;

(4) Regional officials who deliberately caused insolvency are subject to personal liability and criminal referral.

---

### Section 8. Administrative Receivership

(a) **Trigger Conditions.** If a Region's own-source revenue falls below forty percent (40%) of its total expenditures for three consecutive fiscal years, the Independent Fiscal Council shall declare that Region to be in a state of Administrative Receivership.

(b) **Receivership Powers.** During Administrative Receivership, the Independent Fiscal Council shall have authority to:

(1) Conduct comprehensive audits of Regional finances, including all revenue sources, expenditures, and obligations;

(2) Require the Region to submit quarterly fiscal reports in a form prescribed by the Council;

(3) Mandate specific revenue reforms, including but not limited to minimum tax rates, broadening of tax bases, elimination of fiscally irresponsible exemptions, and improved collection enforcement;

(4) Require the Region to submit a Fiscal Recovery Plan within one hundred eighty (180) days, subject to Council approval;

(5) Disapprove Regional budgets that the Council determines will perpetuate dependency; and

(6) Require the Region to engage independent fiscal advisors at Regional expense.

(c) **Limitations on Receivership Powers.** The Independent Fiscal Council may not:

(1) Reduce, condition, or otherwise affect the Region's representation in the Senate or any other legislative body;

(2) Reduce, condition, or otherwise affect the voting rights of the Region's citizens in federal elections;

(3) Assume direct control of Regional government operations beyond fiscal matters;

(4) Mandate specific spending cuts to particular programs (the Region retains discretion over expenditure priorities within approved budget levels); or

(5) Impose receivership for reasons other than the objective fiscal trigger in subsection (a).

(d) **Exit from Receivership.** Administrative Receivership terminates automatically when the Region's own-source revenue exceeds fifty percent (50%) of its total expenditures for two consecutive fiscal years.

(e) **Democratic Representation Preserved.** For the avoidance of doubt, a Region in Administrative Receivership retains full and equal representation in the Senate, full participation in all constitutional processes, and all rights of self-governance except as specifically limited by this section. Fiscal dependency shall never be grounds for reducing a Region's democratic voice in the Union.

---

### Section 9. Asymmetric Shock Stabilization

#### Automatic Cyclical Stabilizers

(a) **Asymmetric Shock Recognition.** The IFC shall monitor Regional economic divergence using a composite index including:

(1) Regional unemployment rate deviation from national average;

(2) Regional GDP growth deviation from national average;

(3) Regional inflation deviation from national average;

(4) Regional housing price deviation from national trend.

(b) **Automatic Stabilizer Trigger.** When any Region's composite index exceeds two (2) standard deviations from the national mean for two (2) consecutive quarters:

(1) The Region shall be designated as experiencing an "Asymmetric Cyclical Shock";

(2) Automatic stabilization transfers shall commence without requiring Congressional appropriation;

(3) Designation shall continue until the index returns to within 1.5 standard deviations for two (2) consecutive quarters.

#### Cyclical Stabilization Fund

(c) **Cyclical Stabilization Fund.**

(1) **Establishment.** A Cyclical Stabilization Fund shall be established, separate from the Fiscal Equalization Fund, dedicated exclusively to asymmetric shock response.

(2) **Capitalization.** The Fund shall be capitalized through:

- (A) A base contribution of 0.5% of national GDP annually during non-crisis periods;
- (B) Countercyclical contributions: Regions experiencing above-average growth contribute an additional 0.25% of Regional GDP;
- (C) Federal Reserve remittances during periods of monetary expansion.

(3) **Target Reserve.** The Fund shall maintain a target reserve of 3% of national GDP, with contributions suspended when target is exceeded.

(d) **Fund Disbursement.** Upon Asymmetric Shock designation:

(1) Automatic transfers commence within thirty (30) days;

(2) Transfer amounts are calculated by formula based on shock severity;

(3) No Congressional appropriation or executive action is required.

#### Regional Countercyclical Tools

(e) **Receding Region Countercyclical Tools.** Regions experiencing Asymmetric Cyclical Shocks (composite index below -2 SD) may:

(1) **Accelerated Depreciation:** Authorize accelerated depreciation schedules for business investment within the Region;

(2) **Payroll Tax Holiday:** Temporarily suspend Regional payroll tax contributions for up to twenty-four (24) months;

(3) **Regional Development Bank Expansion:** Authorize Regional Development Banks to expand lending capacity by up to 150% of normal limits;

(4) **Work-Sharing Programs:** Implement subsidized work-sharing to reduce layoffs while preserving employment relationships.

(f) **Booming Region Countermeasures.** Regions experiencing above-trend growth (composite index exceeding +1.5 SD) may:

(1) Impose Regional capital gains surcharges of up to 5%;

(2) Increase Regional reserve requirements for Regional Development Banks;

(3) Implement Regional property transfer taxes to moderate housing speculation;

(4) Establish Regional inflation stabilization reserves funded by surplus revenues.

---

### Section 10. Fiscal Intervention Hierarchy

The IFC fiscal intervention authorities established in this Article proceed in escalating stages. Each stage requires a finding that lesser interventions are insufficient before proceeding to more intensive measures.

(a) **Intervention Stages.**

(1) **Stage 1: Capacity-Based Equalization Adjustment.** The IFC may adjust equalization calculations under Section 3 to account for self-inflicted fiscal weakness, including:

- (A) Capacity-based calculations that treat forgone tax revenue as if collected (subsidy-neutrality adjustment);
- (B) Predatory subsidy prohibition enforcement;
- (C) Tax expenditure reporting requirements.

(2) **Stage 2: Negligence Finding and Clawback.** If capacity adjustment proves insufficient, the IFC may issue a negligence finding upon determining that Regional fiscal distress results from deliberate policy choices rather than external circumstances:

- (A) Strategic incompetence or deliberate under-collection triggers enhanced reporting;
- (B) Equalization transfers reduced to prevent subsidizing self-inflicted harm;
- (C) Clawback of prior transfers if premised on materially misleading fiscal reporting.

(3) **Stage 3: Solvency Certification Suspension.** If negligence finding proves insufficient:

- (A) The IFC may suspend the Region's solvency certification;
- (B) Suspended certification triggers market disclosure requirements;
- (C) Asset quality floors for Regional Development Banks may be imposed;
- (D) Contagion firewalls activated to protect other Regions.

(4) **Stage 4: Financial Conservatorship.** Only if Stages 1-3 prove insufficient may the IFC impose Financial Conservatorship under Section 7, assuming control over Regional borrowing and major fiscal decisions.

(5) **Stage 5: Administrative Receivership.** If the objective trigger in Section 8(a) is met, Administrative Receivership provides the most intensive intervention.

(b) **Escalation Documentation.** Before proceeding to a higher intervention stage, the IFC shall:

(1) Document why lesser interventions have proven insufficient;

(2) Provide the Region thirty (30) days notice and opportunity to respond;

(3) Issue a public finding justifying escalation.

(c) **De-escalation Path.** The IFC shall reduce intervention intensity when the Region demonstrates sustained compliance:

(1) Each stage requires two consecutive quarters of compliance before de-escalation;

(2) De-escalation proceeds one stage at a time;

(3) The Region may not be re-escalated for the same conduct within twelve (12) months of de-escalation.

---

### Section 11. Fiscal Subsidiarity Protection

#### Tax Base Preservation

(a) **Fiscal Subsidiarity Principle.** Regional and Federal taxation shall not collectively render States unable to fund their enumerated duties through reasonable local taxation.

(b) **IFC Tax Burden Certification.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall certify annually:

(1) The combined Federal-Regional-State effective tax rate for each major tax base (income, payroll, property, sales, corporate);

(2) The proportion of each tax base consumed by Federal and Regional taxation;

(3) Whether the remaining tax capacity is sufficient for States to fund enumerated duties.

(c) **Tax Capacity Floor.** States shall retain access to tax capacity sufficient to fund:

(1) K-12 education at the national average per-pupil expenditure;

(2) Local road maintenance at levels sufficient for public safety;

(3) Essential State administrative functions;

(4) The IFC shall calculate a "Minimum State Tax Capacity" for each State.

(d) **Crowding-Out Prohibition.** If Federal and Regional taxation would reduce State access below the Minimum State Tax Capacity:

(1) The IFC shall notify the offending level(s);

(2) The offending level shall reduce rates or provide compensating transfers within one hundred eighty (180) days;

(3) Failure to comply results in automatic transfer from the offending level to affected States.

## Design Rationale

### Why Independent Taxing Authority?

Fiscal dependence creates political dependence. If Regions rely on federal transfers for basic operations:

- federal government gains coercive leverage
- Regional policy independence becomes illusory
- political accountability becomes confused

Independent taxing authority ensures each level can fund its constitutional responsibilities without permission from other levels.

### Why Prohibit Unfunded Mandates?

Unfunded mandates allow higher levels of government to:

- impose costs on lower levels without political accountability
- claim credit for programs while shifting blame for funding
- effectively expand their power beyond enumerated limits

The prohibition makes the mandating government internalize costs, creating political accountability for its decisions.

### Why Equalization Transfers?

Without equalization, poorer Regions cannot provide basic governmental services:

- courts, elections, emergency services require minimum scale
- extreme inequality undermines national cohesion
- citizens in poor Regions become second-class

Equalization ensures baseline capacity everywhere while preserving fiscal independence for expenditures above the floor.

### Why Formula-Based Rather Than Discretionary?

Discretionary transfers become:

- political patronage tools
- subject to partisan manipulation
- unpredictable for recipient planning

Formula-based transfers create predictability, remove political discretion, and ensure equal treatment of similarly situated Regions.

### Why the Anti-Coercion Rule?

Conditional funding has been used to:

- compel states to adopt federal policies (drinking age, speed limits)
- expand federal authority beyond enumerated powers
- create effective federal control over nominally state functions

The anti-coercion rule prevents conditional funding from becoming a back door to unconstitutional federal expansion.

---

## Implementation Guidance

### Fiscal Equalization Act Requirements

Congress shall enact a Fiscal Equalization Act establishing:

**Formula Components:**

- measure of Regional fiscal capacity (tax base relative to costs)
- measure of Regional fiscal need (population, geography, service costs)
- equalization target (e.g., bring all Regions to median fiscal capacity)

**Process Requirements:**

- annual calculation by Independent Fiscal Council
- automatic appropriation (mandatory spending)
- formula revision only by supermajority vote

**Accountability:**

- annual reporting on transfers and Regional fiscal status
- auditing by Government Accountability Office
- five-year review cycle for formula adequacy

### Default Rule (Article XXI)

If Congress fails to enact the Fiscal Equalization Act within three years of ratification:

- equalization transfers shall be calculated as flat per-capita grants
- baseline level: five percent of federal revenues
- distributed to Regions with below-median fiscal capacity
- rate declines by one percentage point per year beginning in year six
- floor of two percent to incentivize congressional action
