## ARTICLE X - FISCAL ARCHITECTURE

### Section 1. Independent Taxing Authority

Each level of government-federal, Regional, State, local-shall possess independent taxing authority sufficient to fulfill its enumerated responsibilities.

#### Regional Revenue Protection

(a) **Prohibition on Targeted Fiscal Nullification.** No State shall enact any law, credit, rebate, deduction, or exemption that:

(1) Specifically targets, offsets, or neutralizes Regional tax liabilities;

(2) Provides tax benefits conditioned on payment of Regional taxes;

(3) Creates priority schemes that systematically subordinate Regional tax collection to State collection;

(4) Offers location-based incentives designed to erode the Regional tax base within the State.

(b) **Rebuttable Presumption.** A State tax provision shall be presumed to violate subsection (a) if:

(1) It was enacted within twenty-four (24) months of a Regional tax increase or new Regional tax;

(2) Its fiscal impact falls disproportionately (greater than 75%) on Regional revenue rather than Federal or general State revenue;

(3) Legislative history or public statements by sponsors reference Regional tax policy.

(c) **Permitted State Tax Policy.** Nothing in this section shall prevent States from:

(1) Establishing general tax credits, deductions, or exemptions that apply regardless of Regional tax status;

(2) Setting State tax rates at any level, including zero;

(3) Competing for business through general economic development incentives not targeted at Regional tax avoidance.

#### Regional Tax Collection Priority

(d) **Concurrent Collection Authority.** Regions shall have independent authority to:

(1) Assess and collect Regional taxes directly from taxpayers without State intermediation;

(2) Establish Regional tax administration agencies with full enforcement powers;

(3) File liens, levy assets, and pursue collection remedies independently of State tax authorities.

(e) **Lien Parity.** Regional tax liens shall have equal priority with State tax liens:

(1) When Regional and State liens attach to the same property on the same date, they share pro rata;

(2) When liens attach on different dates, priority follows standard first-in-time rules regardless of governmental level;

(3) No State may establish categorical priority for State liens over Regional liens.

(f) **Anti-Subordination Clause.** No State bankruptcy, receivership, or fiscal emergency proceeding may subordinate Regional tax claims to State claims or general creditors.

---

### Section 2. No Unfunded Mandates

Mandates imposed on subordinate governments without adequate funding are unenforceable.

---

### Section 3. Equalization

Automatic, formula-based equalization transfers shall ensure baseline governing capacity across Regions.

#### National Benefits Spine Fiscal Alignment

(a) **Co-Payment Requirement.** For any program funded through the National Benefits Spine, the administering Region shall contribute a co-payment from Regional own-source revenue according to the following schedule:

(1) Regions with fiscal capacity above 110% of national median: 20% co-payment;

(2) Regions with fiscal capacity between 90-110% of national median: 15% co-payment;

(3) Regions with fiscal capacity below 90% of national median: 10% co-payment;

(4) Small Regions receiving equalization transfers under Section 3-A: 5% co-payment (minimum).

(b) **Effect on Incentives.** The co-payment requirement ensures that Regional governments bear marginal fiscal consequences for program expansion decisions, aligning authority over administration with responsibility for costs.

#### Efficiency-Indexed Federal Contributions

(c) **Outcome-Based Funding.** The federal government shall provide National Benefits Spine funding sufficient to achieve specified outcome floors at the National Median cost-per-outcome, adjusted for Regional Purchasing Power Parity.

(d) **Purchasing Power Parity Adjustment.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall annually calculate a Regional Cost Index reflecting differences in labor costs, real estate costs, and input prices across Regions. All efficiency comparisons shall use PPP-adjusted figures.

(e) **Funding Adjustment Based on Efficiency.**

(1) **Efficient Regions:** If a Region achieves outcome floors at below-median PPP-adjusted cost, the Region retains 50% of the savings as unrestricted Regional revenue;

(2) **Inefficient Regions:** If a Region exceeds median PPP-adjusted cost while achieving outcome floors, federal funding covers only the median cost; the Region must fund the excess from own-source revenue;

(3) **Underperforming Regions:** If a Region fails to achieve outcome floors regardless of spending, the Region enters Performance Improvement Status.

#### Subsidy-Neutrality Adjustment

(f) **Subsidy-Neutrality Adjustment.** Equalization formulas shall account for Regional tax expenditures:

(1) "Tax expenditures" include tax credits, exemptions, abatements, and other preferential treatments that reduce tax liability for specific industries or firms;

(2) Tax expenditures exceeding two percent (2%) of Regional GDP shall be added back to calculated tax capacity for equalization purposes;

(3) This adjustment treats the Region as if it had collected the forgone revenue.

(g) **Tax Expenditure Reporting.** Each Region shall report annually:

(1) All tax expenditures by category and amount;

(2) The industries or firms benefiting from each expenditure;

(3) The stated policy rationale for each expenditure.

(h) **IFC Verification.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall:

(1) Verify Regional tax expenditure reports;

(2) Apply the subsidy-neutrality adjustment to equalization calculations;

(3) Publish comparative tax expenditure analyses across Regions.

#### Predatory Subsidy Prohibition

(i) **Predatory Subsidy Prohibition.** Regions may not offer subsidies:

(1) Explicitly conditioned on relocation from another Region;

(2) Available only to firms relocating from specific other Regions;

(3) Structured to match or exceed subsidies offered by other Regions in bidding wars.

(j) **Relocation Subsidy Definition.** A subsidy is "conditioned on relocation" if:

(1) The subsidy agreement references the firm's current location;

(2) The subsidy is available only to firms not currently operating in the Region;

(3) The subsidy amount varies based on the firm's origin Region.

(k) **Total Subsidy Ceiling.** Regional tax expenditures and direct subsidies combined:

(1) May not exceed five percent (5%) of Regional GDP in any fiscal year;

(2) May not exceed fifteen percent (15%) of Regional tax revenue;

(3) The lower of the two limits applies.

#### Tax Effort and Anti-Haven Standards

(l) **Minimum Tax Effort Requirement.** To receive equalization transfers under this Section beyond the minimum floor established by Section 3-A, a Region must demonstrate minimum tax effort, defined as:

(1) Regional tax revenue collection equal to at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the national average Regional tax revenue per capita; OR

(2) Regional tax rates that, if applied to the national average tax base, would generate at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the national average Regional tax revenue per capita.

The Independent Fiscal Council shall certify annually whether each Region meets this threshold.

(m) **Phantom Revenue Adjustment.** For Regions that fail to meet the minimum tax effort threshold under subsection (l):

(1) equalization entitlement shall be calculated as if the Region collected revenue at the minimum tax effort threshold;

(2) the difference between actual collection and the minimum threshold ("phantom revenue") shall be subtracted from equalization transfers;

(3) phantom revenue calculations shall be net of any tax expenditure add-backs already applied under subsection (f) of this Section, to prevent double-counting;

(4) the IFC shall publish phantom revenue calculations for all Regions annually.

(n) **Genuine Low Capacity Exception.** The minimum tax effort requirement under subsection (l) does not apply to a Region that demonstrates:

(1) tax rates at or above the national average for each major tax category; AND

(2) below-average revenue attributable to a genuinely lower tax base, including fewer high-income residents, less corporate activity, or lower property values;

(3) not attributable to tax policy choices designed to attract tax-avoiding residents or entities.

The IFC shall certify whether a Region qualifies for this exception. IFC certification is subject to judicial review for abuse of discretion.

(o) **Anti-Haven Fiscal Consequence.** A Region that maintains tax rates more than fifty percent (50%) below the national average for any major tax category (income, corporate, property, or sales) shall be:

(1) deemed to have fiscal capacity equal to the national average for equalization purposes, regardless of actual revenue;

(2) ineligible for the Genuine Low Capacity Exception under subsection (n);

(3) subject to enhanced phantom revenue calculation using one hundred percent (100%) of the national average (rather than seventy-five percent (75%)) as the threshold.

No Region may provide special tax exemptions or incentives available only to new residents or entities relocating from other Regions, or establish tax-free zones that function primarily as havens for avoiding other Regions' taxation. *[See also subsection (i) Predatory Subsidy Prohibition.]*

(p) **Section 3-A Floor Preservation.** Notwithstanding subsections (l) through (o), the minimum equalization floor under Section 3-A shall not be reduced below the level required to fund basic Regional governance functions. Phantom revenue adjustments may reduce equalization transfers above the Section 3-A floor but may not reduce transfers below it.

(q) **Residence and Domicile Standards.** For purposes of Regional taxation:

(1) physical presence within a Region for more than one hundred eighty-three (183) days per calendar year establishes a presumption of tax residence in that Region;

(2) income earned through work performed within a Region is taxable by that Region regardless of the taxpayer's nominal residence;

(3) Regions shall cooperate in the sharing of taxpayer information to prevent residence arbitrage, subject to privacy protections established by statute.

(r) **Corporate Tax Apportionment.** Corporate tax liability shall be apportioned among Regions based on:

(1) the proportion of sales to customers in each Region;

(2) the proportion of employees and payroll in each Region;

(3) the proportion of property and assets in each Region;

using a formula established by Interstate Compact. Nominal headquarters location alone does not determine tax liability. In the absence of such a Compact, the Independent Fiscal Council shall promulgate a default apportionment formula based on sales, payroll, and property factors.

(s) **Congressional Equalization Adjustment Authority.** If interstate tax competition undermines the viability of the equalization system under this Section, Congress may by law adjust the equalization formula to account for competitive distortions. Congress may not, under this subsection, establish minimum tax rates for Regional taxation.

*[See Gap 193.]*

### Section 3-A. Small Region Support

(a) Equalization transfers under Section 3 shall include a minimum floor for each Region, regardless of formula calculations, sufficient to fund:

- basic Regional administrative functions,
- Regional court operations,
- Regional Guard minimum readiness requirements,
- participation in inter-Regional coordination bodies.

(b) This floor shall be established by statute and may not be reduced below the level necessary to maintain functioning Regional governance.

(c) Small Regions may pool resources through inter-Regional agreements for:

- specialized court functions,
- technical expertise,
- infrastructure management,
- higher education coordination.

(d) Pooling agreements under this section require no federal approval and do not constitute merger.

(e) **Federal Institutional Capacity Support.** For any Region with population below two percent of the total population of the United States:

- (1) The federal government shall provide supplemental funding for Regional court operations, including judicial salaries, court facilities, and administrative staff, sufficient to ensure access to justice equivalent to that available in larger Regions;
- (2) The federal government shall provide technical assistance and shared personnel for specialized regulatory functions that require expertise not economically sustainable at small-region scale;
- (3) Regional Guard forces may be supplemented by federal reserve components under Regional Governor command for non-federalized operations, pursuant to agreement between the Region and the Department of Defense;
- (4) This support is an entitlement, not subject to annual appropriation discretion, and shall be funded through mandatory spending.

(f) **Mandatory Pooling for Critical Functions.** Regions with population below two percent of the total population shall enter into pooling agreements with at least one adjacent Region for:

- (1) appellate court operations (trial courts may remain independent),
- (2) specialized law enforcement functions (forensics, cybercrime),
- (3) emergency management coordination.

Such pooling shall preserve each Region's sovereignty and independent governance; pooled functions operate under joint authority with equal Regional representation regardless of population.

(g) For purposes of this section, a "Small Region" is one that meets either:

- (1) population below five percent of the total population of the United States, or
- (2) fiscal capacity below the median fiscal capacity of all Regions.

(h) Fiscal capacity shall be measured by the Independent Fiscal Council using a formula that accounts for tax base, cost of living, and geographic factors. The formula shall be established by statute and reviewed every ten years.

---

### Section 4. Non-Coercion Standard

*[This section prohibits the federal government from using conditional spending or tax expenditures to coerce Regions into adopting policies within Exclusive Regional Domains. See Gap 194.]*

(a) **Conditional Spending Limitations.** Federal spending conditions and conditional tax expenditures must be:

(1) **Germane**: directly and substantially related to the federal spending program's purpose;

(2) **Non-Coercive**: not compelling adoption of policies within Exclusive Regional Domains as defined in Article II, Section 1(e)(2); and

(3) **Transparent**: clearly stated in the authorizing legislation, not imposed through regulation, guidance, or enforcement discretion.

(b) **Coercion Threshold.** A spending condition or conditional tax expenditure is presumptively coercive if:

(1) the potential loss to the Region exceeds 5% of the Region's budget for the affected functional category as determined by the Independent Fiscal Council; OR

(2) the aggregate financial impact of all federal conditions within a single functional category exceeds 5% of the Region's budget for that category in a fiscal year; OR

(3) the condition requires a Region to enact, maintain, or repeal legislation within an Exclusive Regional Domain; OR

(4) the condition effectively transfers regulatory authority from the Region to the federal government in an Exclusive Regional Domain.

(c) **Germaneness Requirement.** Conditions attached to federal spending must relate to how the federal funds are spent, not to unrelated Regional policies. A condition on transportation funds must relate to transportation construction, maintenance, or safety--not to education, family law, or other domains.

(d) **Exclusive Domain Protection.** No spending condition or conditional tax expenditure may require a Region to:

(1) adopt specific policies within an Exclusive Regional Domain;

(2) surrender regulatory authority within an Exclusive Regional Domain;

(3) submit Exclusive Regional Domain legislation for federal approval; or

(4) enforce federal standards within an Exclusive Regional Domain.

(e) **Voluntary Cooperation.** A Region may accept federal conditions within an Exclusive Regional Domain only by a two-thirds vote of the Regional Assembly. Such acceptance:

(1) may be revoked by the same two-thirds vote at any time;

(2) does not establish precedent for future conditions;

(3) does not waive the Region's right to challenge other conditions under this section.

(f) **Scope.** For purposes of this section, "federal funds" includes appropriations, grants, transfers, tax credits, tax deductions, tax exemptions, and any other financial incentive conditioned on Regional policy compliance. "Functional category" means the budget classification categories established and maintained by the Independent Fiscal Council under Section 5.

(g) **Maintenance of Effort.** Maintenance of Effort requirements attached to conditional spending are subject to the limitations of Section 18(e) regardless of whether the underlying program constitutes a funded or unfunded mandate.

(h) **Enforcement.** Regions may challenge spending conditions before the Constitutional Court. If a condition is found invalid:

(1) the invalid condition is severed; the Region receives the funds without the condition;

(2) Congress may not reduce baseline funding to the Region--defined as the prior fiscal year's appropriation for the affected program--in retaliation for a successful challenge;

(3) the prevailing Region recovers litigation costs.

(i) **Savings Clause.** This section does not limit:

(1) legitimate accounting, audit, and reporting requirements for how federal funds are spent;

(2) conditions directly and substantially related to the administration of the funded program itself;

(3) federal regulatory authority in Shared Domains or Federal Exclusive Domains as defined in Article II, Section 1(e).

---

### Section 5. Independent Fiscal Council

(a) There is hereby established an Independent Fiscal Council (IFC) consisting of seven members appointed as follows:

- (1) two members appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate,
- (2) two members appointed by the Speaker of the House,
- (3) two members appointed by a majority vote of all Regional Governors, and
- (4) one member selected by unanimous agreement of the other six members, who shall serve as Chair.

(b) Members shall serve staggered seven-year terms and may be removed only for cause by a two-thirds vote of both houses of Congress.

(c) The Council shall:

- (1) measure Regional fiscal capacity annually using the formula established by statute under Section 3-A(f),
- (2) certify equalization transfer calculations under Section 3,
- (3) determine Small Region qualification under Section 3-A(e),
- (4) advise Congress on fiscal federalism matters,
- (5) publish annual reports on the fiscal status of each Region and the effectiveness of equalization transfers.

(d) Council determinations under subsections (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)(3) shall be final and not subject to political override, but may be challenged in federal court for procedural error or constitutional violation.

(e) The Council shall operate with full budgetary independence and shall receive automatic appropriations equal to 0.01% of equalization transfers or $50 million (indexed to inflation), whichever is greater.

---

### Section 6. Regional Debt Discipline

#### Debt Ceilings

(a) **Standard Debt Ceiling.** No Region may issue debt exceeding:

(1) Fifteen percent of its three-year average Regional GDP; or

(2) One hundred fifty percent of its annual Regional tax revenue;

(3) Whichever is lower shall apply as the binding ceiling.

(b) **Emergency Debt Authorization.** Debt exceeding the standard ceiling requires:

(1) Authorization from the Independent Fiscal Council;

(2) Certification that the additional debt is necessary for genuine emergency response;

(3) A credible repayment plan demonstrating capacity to service the debt.

(c) **IFC Authorization Standards.** The IFC shall authorize emergency debt only if:

(1) The declared emergency meets objective criteria (natural disaster, economic crisis, public health emergency);

(2) The Region has exhausted reasonable revenue alternatives;

(3) The debt will be used solely for emergency response, not ongoing operations.

(d) **Absolute Debt Ceiling.** Even with IFC authorization, Regional debt may not exceed:

(1) Twenty-five percent of three-year average Regional GDP; or

(2) Two hundred fifty percent of annual Regional tax revenue;

(3) This ceiling is absolute and may not be waived.

#### Debt Sustainability Monitoring

(e) **IFC Debt Monitoring.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall:

(1) Monitor Regional debt levels quarterly;

(2) Publish debt sustainability assessments annually;

(3) Issue early warning alerts when debt approaches ceiling thresholds.

(f) **Debt Warning Thresholds.** The IFC shall issue alerts at:

(1) "Caution" when debt exceeds seventy-five percent of ceiling;

(2) "Warning" when debt exceeds ninety percent of ceiling;

(3) "Critical" when debt exceeds ninety-five percent of ceiling.

(g) **Warning Response Requirements.** Upon IFC warning:

(1) "Caution" requires Regional fiscal plan submission within ninety days;

(2) "Warning" prohibits new non-emergency debt issuance;

(3) "Critical" requires mandatory debt reduction plan with IFC approval.

(h) **Market Disclosure.** Regions shall disclose to bond markets:

(1) Current debt level relative to ceiling;

(2) IFC sustainability assessment;

(3) Any warning status and response plans.

#### No-Bailout Commitment

(i) **Federal No-Bailout Rule.** Neither the United States nor any instrumentality thereof shall:

(1) Assume, guarantee, or pay any debt or obligation of any Region or any instrumentality thereof;

(2) Appropriate funds for the purpose of enabling any Region to meet debt obligations or avoid default;

(3) Provide loans, credit facilities, or other financial assistance if the primary purpose is to enable debt service or avoid default.

Any law, appropriation, or executive action that violates this prohibition is void.

This prohibition does not apply to:

- (A) Formula-based stabilization transfers under Section 9, which address cyclical economic conditions rather than debt service;
- (B) Temporary federal assumption of essential service operations under Section 7(d)(1)(B), which constitutes operational continuity rather than financial assistance;
- (C) Emergency liquidity assistance under subsection (t) of this Section, provided all conditions therein are satisfied.

*[See Gap 197.]*

(j) **Regional Default Procedures.** If a Region cannot service its debt:

(1) The Region shall enter structured bankruptcy proceedings overseen by the ARB;

(2) Bondholders bear losses according to normal priority rules;

(3) Essential services continue under ARB-supervised receivership;

(4) Restructuring plans require approval by two-thirds of creditors by value in each class;

(5) Approved restructuring plans bind all creditors in the approving class, including holdouts;

(6) Pension obligations shall be modified only after bondholders and general obligation creditors have absorbed losses proportionate to their claims; pensions are not immune from modification if solvency cannot otherwise be restored.

*[See Gap 197.]*

(k) **Corridor Protection During Default.** National Interest Corridors:

(1) May not be closed or impaired during Regional fiscal distress;

(2) Shall be operated under federal receivership if necessary;

(3) The Region may not use corridor closure as leverage for bailout.

#### Intergenerational Protection

(l) **Debt Service Ceiling.** Annual debt service (principal plus interest) may not exceed:

(1) Fifteen percent of annual Regional tax revenue;

(2) If projected to exceed, new debt issuance is prohibited until compliance achieved.

(m) **Future Taxpayer Representation.** Regional debt decisions shall consider:

(1) IFC assessment of intergenerational equity;

(2) Long-term debt service projections under various economic scenarios;

(3) The IFC may object to debt issuance that unfairly burdens future generations.

(n) **Debt Maturity Requirements.** Regional debt shall:

(1) Have average weighted maturity not exceeding twenty years;

(2) Include no provisions that defer all principal repayment beyond ten years;

(3) These requirements ensure current generations bear current costs.

#### Off-Balance-Sheet Debt Controls

(o) **Consolidated Fiscal Reporting.** For purposes of all debt limits, ceilings, and monitoring under this Article, "Regional debt" includes:

(1) All direct obligations of the Regional government;

(2) All obligations of any Regional authority, agency, corporation, or instrumentality created by or on behalf of the Region, regardless of formal legal separation;

(3) All revenue bonds issued by entities in which the Region has an ownership interest, exercises control, or for which Regional action was required for creation;

(4) All public-private partnership obligations where the Region bears contingent liability, guarantees revenue, or provides availability payments;

(5) All lease-purchase agreements, certificates of participation, and similar financing arrangements;

(6) The proportionate share of any multi-Regional financing entity's obligations based on the Region's participation;

(7) Unfunded pension liabilities, unfunded other post-employment benefit (OPEB) liabilities, and unfunded liabilities of any other long-term employee benefit obligation, calculated using actuarial standards under Section 20 of this Article; provided that inclusion of such liabilities shall be phased in over ten (10) years following ratification, with ten percent (10%) of the calculated liability added in each year. *[See Gap 202.]*

(p) **Independent Infrastructure Authority Restrictions.**

(1) No Region may create or authorize the creation of an independent authority, corporation, or special district for the primary purpose of issuing debt that would not be included in Regional debt calculations;

(2) Any entity created by Regional action that issues debt exceeding $100 million shall be presumed to be a Regional instrumentality subject to consolidated reporting;

(3) The IFC may pierce the corporate form of any entity and attribute its debt to the creating Region if:

- (i) the Region exercises practical control over the entity's governance;
- (ii) the Region provides substantial revenue support or credit enhancement;
- (iii) the entity was structured to evade Regional debt limits.

(q) **Revenue Bond Disclosure.** Revenue bonds issued by Regional instrumentalities shall:

(1) Disclose in offering documents that the bonds are subject to Regional debt consolidation rules;

(2) State that bondholders cannot rely on formal legal separation to avoid the consequences of Regional fiscal distress;

(3) Be reported to the IFC within thirty days of issuance.

(r) **Penalties for Evasion.** If the IFC determines that a Region has structured transactions to evade debt limits:

(1) The evaded debt shall be immediately attributed to the Region;

(2) The Region shall be placed on "Warning" status regardless of prior debt level;

(3) Regional officials who authorized the evasive structure may be personally disqualified from future public financial positions;

(4) The Region shall reimburse IFC enforcement costs.

#### Market Discipline and Liquidity

(s) **Market Discipline Preservation.** To preserve market discipline on Regional borrowing:

(1) No federal law shall establish that Regional bonds are guaranteed by federal full faith and credit;

(2) No federal regulatory action shall require financial institutions to treat Regional bonds as risk-free assets;

(3) Regional bonds shall be rated, priced, and traded based on the creditworthiness of the issuing Region alone.

*[See Gap 197.]*

(t) **Emergency Liquidity Assistance.** Notwithstanding subsection (i), the Federal Reserve may provide short-term liquidity assistance to a Region:

(1) Only upon certification by the Independent Fiscal Council that the Region faces a temporary liquidity crisis rather than structural insolvency;

(2) At penalty interest rates above market rates for comparable risk;

(3) For a maximum duration of eighteen (18) months, which may not be extended or renewed;

(4) Secured by adequate collateral;

(5) Subject to Congressional notification within forty-eight (48) hours and Congressional override within sixty (60) days.

If the IFC determines at any point during the assistance period that the Region is structurally insolvent rather than temporarily illiquid, liquidity assistance shall terminate immediately and the Region shall enter the fiscal intervention process under Section 10.

*[See Gap 197.]*

---

### Section 7. Financial Conservatorship

#### Systemic Risk Limits

(a) **Mandatory Fiscal Limits.**

(1) The Independent Fiscal Council shall establish and publish mandatory debt-to-GDP ratios for all Regions, not to exceed eighty percent of Regional GDP;

(2) Regional Development Banks shall maintain leverage ratios not exceeding those applicable to federally-chartered banks;

(3) Regions must submit annual fiscal sustainability reports to the IFC demonstrating compliance;

(4) The IFC may adjust ratios based on economic conditions but may not waive limits entirely.

#### Automatic Conservatorship

(b) **Financial Conservatorship Trigger.**

(1) Exceeding the debt-to-GDP ratio by ten percent or more triggers automatic "Financial Conservatorship" status;

(2) During Conservatorship, the IFC assumes authority over:

- (A) All new Regional borrowing and bond issuance;
- (B) Regional Development Bank operations and lending policies;
- (C) Budget approval for expenditures exceeding operational minimums;

(3) Conservatorship continues until the Region returns to compliance for two consecutive fiscal years;

(4) Regional officials may not incur new obligations without IFC approval during Conservatorship.

#### Anti-Extortion Provisions

(c) **Contagion Risk Limitation.**

(1) No Region may condition fiscal responsibility on federal policy concessions;

(2) Threats of "disorderly default" to extract transfers or exemptions constitute grounds for immediate Conservatorship;

(3) The IFC may pre-emptively impose Conservatorship upon finding evidence of deliberate over-leveraging for coercive purposes;

(4) Equalization transfers shall not be increased to remedy self-inflicted fiscal crises caused by deliberate over-borrowing.

#### Orderly Resolution

(d) **Structured Resolution.**

(1) If a Region in Conservatorship cannot achieve fiscal sustainability, the IFC may implement orderly resolution including:

- (A) Mandatory debt restructuring with haircuts distributed equitably among bondholders;
- (B) Temporary federal assumption of essential service operations, which constitutes operational continuity and does not constitute financial assistance or a guarantee of Regional debt obligations under Section 6(i);
- (C) Asset sales from Regional Development Banks;

(2) Resolution shall not include unlimited federal bailouts or transfer increases;

(3) The resolution process shall impose costs on the failing Region proportionate to its contribution to the crisis;

(4) Regional officials who deliberately caused insolvency are subject to personal liability and criminal referral.

---

### Section 8. Administrative Receivership

(a) **Trigger Conditions.** If a Region's own-source revenue falls below forty percent (40%) of its total expenditures for three consecutive fiscal years, the Independent Fiscal Council shall declare that Region to be in a state of Administrative Receivership.

(b) **Receivership Powers.** During Administrative Receivership, the Independent Fiscal Council shall have authority to:

(1) Conduct comprehensive audits of Regional finances, including all revenue sources, expenditures, and obligations;

(2) Require the Region to submit quarterly fiscal reports in a form prescribed by the Council;

(3) Mandate specific revenue reforms, including but not limited to minimum tax rates, broadening of tax bases, elimination of fiscally irresponsible exemptions, and improved collection enforcement;

(4) Require the Region to submit a Fiscal Recovery Plan within one hundred eighty (180) days, subject to Council approval;

(5) Disapprove Regional budgets that the Council determines will perpetuate dependency; and

(6) Require the Region to engage independent fiscal advisors at Regional expense.

(c) **Limitations on Receivership Powers.** The Independent Fiscal Council may not:

(1) Reduce, condition, or otherwise affect the Region's representation in the Senate or any other legislative body;

(2) Reduce, condition, or otherwise affect the voting rights of the Region's citizens in federal elections;

(3) Assume direct control of Regional government operations beyond fiscal matters;

(4) Mandate specific spending cuts to particular programs (the Region retains discretion over expenditure priorities within approved budget levels); or

(5) Impose receivership for reasons other than the objective fiscal trigger in subsection (a).

(d) **Exit from Receivership.** Administrative Receivership terminates automatically when the Region's own-source revenue exceeds fifty percent (50%) of its total expenditures for two consecutive fiscal years.

(e) **Democratic Representation Preserved.** For the avoidance of doubt, a Region in Administrative Receivership retains full and equal representation in the Senate, full participation in all constitutional processes, and all rights of self-governance except as specifically limited by this section. Fiscal dependency shall never be grounds for reducing a Region's democratic voice in the Union.

---

### Section 9. Asymmetric Shock Stabilization

#### Automatic Cyclical Stabilizers

(a) **Asymmetric Shock Recognition.** The IFC shall monitor Regional economic divergence using a composite index including:

(1) Regional unemployment rate deviation from national average;

(2) Regional GDP growth deviation from national average;

(3) Regional inflation deviation from national average;

(4) Regional housing price deviation from national trend.

(b) **Automatic Stabilizer Trigger.** When any Region's composite index exceeds two (2) standard deviations from the national mean for two (2) consecutive quarters:

(1) The Region shall be designated as experiencing an "Asymmetric Cyclical Shock";

(2) Automatic stabilization transfers shall commence without requiring Congressional appropriation;

(3) Designation shall continue until the index returns to within 1.5 standard deviations for two (2) consecutive quarters.

#### Cyclical Stabilization Fund

(c) **Cyclical Stabilization Fund.**

(1) **Establishment.** A Cyclical Stabilization Fund shall be established, separate from the Fiscal Equalization Fund, dedicated exclusively to asymmetric shock response.

(2) **Capitalization.** The Fund shall be capitalized through:

- (A) A base contribution of 0.5% of national GDP annually during non-crisis periods;
- (B) Countercyclical contributions: Regions experiencing above-average growth contribute an additional 0.25% of Regional GDP;
- (C) Federal Reserve remittances during periods of monetary expansion.

(3) **Target Reserve.** The Fund shall maintain a target reserve of 3% of national GDP, with contributions suspended when target is exceeded.

(d) **Fund Disbursement.** Upon Asymmetric Shock designation:

(1) Automatic transfers commence within thirty (30) days;

(2) Transfer amounts are calculated by formula based on shock severity;

(3) No Congressional appropriation or executive action is required.

#### Regional Countercyclical Tools

(e) **Receding Region Countercyclical Tools.** Regions experiencing Asymmetric Cyclical Shocks (composite index below -2 SD) may:

(1) **Accelerated Depreciation:** Authorize accelerated depreciation schedules for business investment within the Region;

(2) **Payroll Tax Holiday:** Temporarily suspend Regional payroll tax contributions for up to twenty-four (24) months;

(3) **Regional Development Bank Expansion:** Authorize Regional Development Banks to expand lending capacity by up to 150% of normal limits;

(4) **Work-Sharing Programs:** Implement subsidized work-sharing to reduce layoffs while preserving employment relationships.

(f) **Booming Region Countermeasures.** Regions experiencing above-trend growth (composite index exceeding +1.5 SD) may:

(1) Impose Regional capital gains surcharges of up to 5%;

(2) Increase Regional reserve requirements for Regional Development Banks;

(3) Implement Regional property transfer taxes to moderate housing speculation;

(4) Establish Regional inflation stabilization reserves funded by surplus revenues.

---

### Section 10. Fiscal Intervention Hierarchy

The IFC fiscal intervention authorities established in this Article proceed in escalating stages. Each stage requires a finding that lesser interventions are insufficient before proceeding to more intensive measures.

(a) **Intervention Stages.**

(1) **Stage 1: Capacity-Based Equalization Adjustment.** The IFC may adjust equalization calculations under Section 3 to account for self-inflicted fiscal weakness, including:

- (A) Capacity-based calculations that treat forgone tax revenue as if collected (subsidy-neutrality adjustment);
- (B) Predatory subsidy prohibition enforcement;
- (C) Tax expenditure reporting requirements.

(2) **Stage 2: Negligence Finding and Clawback.** If capacity adjustment proves insufficient, the IFC may issue a negligence finding upon determining that Regional fiscal distress results from deliberate policy choices rather than external circumstances:

- (A) Strategic incompetence or deliberate under-collection triggers enhanced reporting;
- (B) Equalization transfers reduced to prevent subsidizing self-inflicted harm;
- (C) Clawback of prior transfers if premised on materially misleading fiscal reporting.

(3) **Stage 3: Solvency Certification Suspension.** If negligence finding proves insufficient:

- (A) The IFC may suspend the Region's solvency certification;
- (B) Suspended certification triggers market disclosure requirements;
- (C) Asset quality floors for Regional Development Banks may be imposed;
- (D) Contagion firewalls activated to protect other Regions.

(4) **Stage 4: Financial Conservatorship.** Only if Stages 1-3 prove insufficient may the IFC impose Financial Conservatorship under Section 7, assuming control over Regional borrowing and major fiscal decisions.

(5) **Stage 5: Administrative Receivership.** If the objective trigger in Section 8(a) is met, Administrative Receivership provides the most intensive intervention.

(b) **Escalation Documentation.** Before proceeding to a higher intervention stage, the IFC shall:

(1) Document why lesser interventions have proven insufficient;

(2) Provide the Region thirty (30) days notice and opportunity to respond;

(3) Issue a public finding justifying escalation.

(c) **De-escalation Path.** The IFC shall reduce intervention intensity when the Region demonstrates sustained compliance:

(1) Each stage requires two consecutive quarters of compliance before de-escalation;

(2) De-escalation proceeds one stage at a time;

(3) The Region may not be re-escalated for the same conduct within twelve (12) months of de-escalation.

### Section 11. Fiscal Subsidiarity Protection

#### Tax Base Preservation

(a) **Fiscal Subsidiarity Principle.** Regional and Federal taxation shall not collectively render States unable to fund their enumerated duties through reasonable local taxation.

(b) **IFC Tax Burden Certification.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall certify annually:

(1) The combined Federal-Regional-State effective tax rate for each major tax base (income, payroll, property, sales, corporate);

(2) The proportion of each tax base consumed by Federal and Regional taxation;

(3) Whether the remaining tax capacity is sufficient for States to fund enumerated duties.

(c) **Tax Capacity Floor.** States shall retain access to tax capacity sufficient to fund:

(1) K-12 education at the national average per-pupil expenditure;

(2) Local road maintenance at levels sufficient for public safety;

(3) Essential State administrative functions;

(4) The IFC shall calculate a "Minimum State Tax Capacity" for each State.

(d) **Crowding-Out Prohibition.** If Federal and Regional taxation would reduce State access below the Minimum State Tax Capacity:

(1) The IFC shall notify the offending level(s);

(2) The offending level shall reduce rates or provide compensating transfers within one hundred eighty (180) days;

(3) Failure to comply results in automatic transfer from the offending level to affected States.

---

### Section 11-A. Prohibition on Predatory Tax Exportation

(a) **Tax Exportation Defined.** Tax exportation occurs when the economic burden of a Regional or State tax, fee, or assessment falls primarily (greater than sixty percent) on persons or entities residing outside the taxing jurisdiction.

(b) **Tax Exportation Ceiling.** No Region may derive more than twenty-five percent (25%) of its total annual revenue from exported taxes. This ceiling applies to:

- (1) transit fees on inter-Regional energy, data, or transportation corridors;
- (2) severance taxes on resources where the primary consumption occurs outside the Region;
- (3) consumption or sales taxes specifically targeting industries or activities with primarily non-resident participation;
- (4) any other fiscal instrument where the Independent Fiscal Council (IFC) determines the ultimate economic incidence is shifted to non-residents.

(c) **Monopoly Rents Finding.** If a Region possesses a geographic or economic monopoly over a vital national utility (e.g., a primary deep-water port, a national fiber-optic hub, or a trans-continental energy corridor), the IFC shall:

- (1) establish a "Neutral Service Rate" for that utility based on cost-plus-reasonable-margin;
- (2) any revenue collected above this rate shall be deemed "Monopoly Rent" and credited against the Region's equalization transfers.

(d) **Enforcement and Remediation.** If a Region exceeds the Tax Exportation Ceiling:

- (1) the excess revenue shall be placed in an escrow fund administered by the IFC;
- (2) the fund shall be redistributed as "Exportation Rebates" to the Regions whose residents bore the economic burden;
- (3) persistent violations (three consecutive years) shall result in the IFC assuming authority over the Region's tax-rate setting for the offending categories.

(e) **Incidence Determination.** The IFC shall determine economic incidence using standard public finance methodology, considering price elasticities, market structure, and pass-through rates. The IFC's incidence determination is subject to methodological challenge under Article II, Section 7-A(f).

---

### Section 12. Democratic Accountability for Fiscal Institutions

#### Political Override for Systemic Disputes

(a) **Legitimacy Review Trigger.** If three or more Regions formally declare non-compliance with IFC or ARB determinations within a twelve-month period:

(1) The declarations shall automatically trigger a "Legitimacy Review" requiring Congress to:

- (i) hold public hearings within sixty (60) days on the disputed determinations;
- (ii) vote within one hundred twenty (120) days on whether to affirm, modify, or vacate the disputed determinations;
- (iii) consider structural reforms to the IFC or ARB.

(2) During Legitimacy Review:

- (i) enforcement of disputed determinations is stayed;
- (ii) affected Regions remain subject to baseline constitutional requirements (debt ceilings, no-bailout rule);
- (iii) the IFC and ARB shall participate in hearings and defend their determinations publicly.

(b) **Periodic Reauthorization.** The statutory authorities of the IFC and ARB shall sunset every twelve (12) years unless reauthorized by Congress. Reauthorization shall include:

(1) review of institutional performance;

(2) opportunity for structural reforms;

(3) public comment period.

(c) **Regional Representation in Determinations.** No determination materially adverse to a Region may be made by a panel where no member was appointed by Regional Governors. If such a panel composition occurs due to vacancies or recusals, the determination shall require unanimous agreement of remaining members.

#### Transparency Requirements

(d) **Public Accountability.** The IFC and ARB shall:

(1) publish all deliberations and vote records;

(2) issue plain-language explanations of determinations accessible to non-experts;

(3) maintain public dashboards showing Regional fiscal status and pending matters;

(4) hold annual public meetings in each Region.

#### Non-Compliance Response Ladder

(e) **Graduated Enforcement.** Before any coercive enforcement against a non-compliant Region:

(1) **Stage 1 - Explanation:** The IFC/ARB shall issue a formal explanation and offer technical assistance (30 days);

(2) **Stage 2 - Mediation:** Mediation by a panel including Regional Governor representatives (60 days);

(3) **Stage 3 - Congressional Review:** Congressional review and vote on whether enforcement is appropriate (90 days);

(4) **Stage 4 - Enforcement:** Only after Congressional authorization may coercive measures (conservatorship, receivership) proceed.

(f) **Emergency Exception.** Subsection (e) does not apply when:

(1) the Region's actions pose imminent risk of contagion to other Regions' fiscal stability;

(2) the Region has deliberately structured transactions to evade constitutional limits;

(3) certified by the Chief Justice as requiring immediate intervention.

---

### Section 13. Prohibition on Shadow Currencies and Quasi-Monetary Instruments

(a) **Federal Monetary Exclusivity.** The federal government's exclusive authority over "currency and monetary policy" under Article II, Section 1 includes exclusive authority over all instruments that function as money, regardless of their formal designation.

(b) **Prohibited Regional Instruments.** No Region or State may issue, authorize, or permit the circulation of:

- (1) "Regional credits," "energy credits," "tax-anticipation tokens," or similar instruments that are transferable and accepted for payment of taxes, fees, or utility charges;
- (2) digital tokens, blockchain-based currencies, or other electronic instruments that function as a medium of exchange within Regional commerce;
- (3) scrip, vouchers, or certificates that are designed to circulate as a substitute for federal currency;
- (4) any instrument that, regardless of its formal designation, functions as a store of value, medium of exchange, and unit of account within the Regional economy.

(c) **Functional Test.** An instrument, regardless of whether it was created, issued, or sponsored by a Region or State, shall be deemed a prohibited quasi-currency if it meets any two of the following criteria:

- (1) it is accepted for payment of Regional or State taxes, fees, or charges;
- (2) it is traded on secondary markets or exchanges;
- (3) its aggregate value in circulation exceeds $100 million;
- (4) it is used by more than 10,000 distinct parties in commercial transactions within a twelve-month period;
- (5) it is marketed or promoted as an alternative to federal currency.

(d) **Permitted Instruments.** This section does not prohibit:

- (1) conventional tax credits, rebates, or refunds denominated in dollars;
- (2) non-transferable benefit vouchers (e.g., food assistance, housing vouchers);
- (3) loyalty programs, gift cards, or promotional credits limited to specific vendors;
- (4) Regional bonds, notes, or other debt instruments that are not designed to circulate as currency;
- (5) public utility rate credits applied to specific customer accounts.

(e) **IFC Monitoring.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall:

- (1) monitor Regional fiscal instruments for compliance with this section;
- (2) issue advisory opinions on whether proposed instruments would violate this section;
- (3) refer suspected violations to the Department of Justice for enforcement.

(f) **Enforcement.** Issuance of a prohibited quasi-currency shall result in:

- (1) immediate injunction by federal court;
- (2) mandatory redemption of all outstanding instruments at face value in federal currency;
- (3) civil penalties of up to $10 million per day of continued circulation;
- (4) personal liability for Regional officials who authorized the issuance.

(g) **Federal Reserve Coordination.** The Federal Reserve shall have authority to:

- (1) determine whether an instrument constitutes a prohibited quasi-currency;
- (2) require reporting from Regions on fiscal instruments that approach the thresholds in subsection (c);
- (3) issue cease-and-desist orders for instruments that threaten monetary policy effectiveness.

(h) **Legal Tender Monopoly.** *[See Gap 195.]*

- (1) No Region or State may make any thing other than the Federal Dollar legal tender in payment of debts, whether public or private;
- (2) No Region or State may accept any medium other than the Federal Dollar for the discharge of public taxes, fees, fines, or other obligations owed to the Regional or State government;
- (3) No Region or State may denominate public obligations, contracts, or budgets in any unit of account other than the Federal Dollar;
- (4) No Region or State may establish, sponsor, adopt, or officially endorse any alternative currency, cryptocurrency, commodity money, or medium of exchange as equivalent to or substitute for the Federal Dollar.

(i) **Definition of "Federal Dollar."** For purposes of this section and of this Constitution:

- (1) "Federal Dollar" means the currency issued by the United States Federal Reserve System;
- (2) Digital representations of Federal Dollars issued or authorized by the Federal Reserve are Federal Dollars, subject to the privacy and anti-programmability requirements of Article I, Section 22;
- (3) Private stablecoins, cryptocurrencies, and digital assets are not Federal Dollars regardless of their denomination or peg.

(j) **Private Transactions.** Nothing in this section prohibits:

- (1) private parties from voluntarily transacting in any medium they choose, subject to applicable federal regulation;
- (2) federal regulation of cryptocurrency and digital assets;
- (3) Regional consumer protection laws regarding cryptocurrency fraud.

This subsection limits only governmental acceptance and endorsement, not private economic activity.

---

### Section 14. Fiscal Adequacy Determinations

(a) **Definition of Adequate Funding.** A mandate is adequately funded when the resources provided are reasonably sufficient to achieve substantial compliance with the mandate's requirements without requiring the subordinate government to:

- (1) reduce existing services below minimum standards established by law;
- (2) impose taxes or fees exceeding one hundred ten percent of the regional median for comparable jurisdictions; or
- (3) defer essential infrastructure maintenance or capital replacement.

(b) **Fiscal Adequacy Review Board.** The Inter-Regional Fiscal Court shall establish a Fiscal Adequacy Review Board ("FARB") consisting of:

- (1) three economists appointed by the IFC for staggered six-year terms;
- (2) two former State or Regional budget directors appointed by the Council of Governors; and
- (3) two representatives of municipal governments appointed by the National League of Cities.

(c) **Pre-Enactment Fiscal Adequacy Certification.** Before any Federal or Regional mandate takes effect:

- (1) the enacting authority shall submit a Fiscal Adequacy Statement to the FARB estimating compliance costs and identifying funding sources;
- (2) the FARB shall issue a Fiscal Adequacy Determination within sixty days certifying whether proposed funding is adequate;
- (3) if the FARB certifies funding as inadequate, the mandate shall not take effect until funding is increased to adequate levels or the enacting authority demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the FARB's determination was erroneous.

(d) **Post-Enactment Adequacy Challenges.** Any subordinate government subject to a mandate may petition the FARB for a determination that funding has become inadequate due to:

- (1) increased compliance costs exceeding original estimates by more than twenty percent;
- (2) inflation or economic changes materially affecting compliance costs;
- (3) unforeseen implementation requirements; or
- (4) cumulative burden of multiple mandates affecting the same revenue sources.

(e) **Remedies for Inadequate Funding.** Upon determination that a mandate is inadequately funded:

- (1) the subordinate government may suspend compliance with the underfunded portions until adequate funding is provided;
- (2) the enacting authority shall have one hundred eighty days to cure the funding deficiency;
- (3) if not cured, the mandate becomes unenforceable against the petitioning government;
- (4) no penalty, sanction, or loss of other funding may be imposed for non-compliance with an inadequately funded mandate.

(f) **Anti-Circumvention.** No enacting authority may:

- (1) condition unrelated funding on compliance with inadequately funded mandates;
- (2) impose mandates through guidance, interpretation, or enforcement discretion to avoid fiscal adequacy review;
- (3) fragment mandates into smaller components to avoid cumulative burden analysis.

---

### Section 15. Pre-Ratification Legacy Liabilities

(a) **Legacy Liability Defined.** A "Legacy Liability" is a fiscal or environmental obligation incurred prior to the ratification of this Constitution, specifically including:

- (1) unfunded pension obligations for state and local employees accrued before ratification;
- (2) remediation costs for pre-existing toxic waste or "Superfund" sites designated before ratification;
- (3) decommissioning costs for aging nuclear or industrial facilities constructed before ratification;
- (4) infrastructure debt and deferred maintenance obligations incurred before ratification.

(b) **National Legacy Trust.** There is hereby established a National Legacy Trust ("NLT"), managed by the IFC, to assist Regions burdened by disproportionate industrial or administrative history:

(b-1) **Legacy Burden Factor.** The IFC shall include a "Legacy Burden Factor" in the equalization formula, ensuring that Regions with older infrastructure, higher pension loads, and greater environmental remediation obligations are not fiscally penalized relative to Regions without such historical burdens. The Factor shall be calculated based on:

- (1) per-capita unfunded pension obligations attributable to pre-ratification service;
- (2) per-capita environmental remediation costs for pre-ratification contamination;
- (3) per-capita deferred maintenance on infrastructure constructed before ratification;
- (4) other quantifiable legacy burdens as determined by the IFC.

(b-2) **Federal Backstop for Catastrophic Legacy Harms.** For legacy harms that exceed a Region's fiscal capacity (defined as remediation costs exceeding five percent of Regional GDP), the NLT shall provide direct grants funded by:

- (1) a 0.05% national corporate carbon fee on emissions exceeding sector baselines;
- (2) a 0.05% financial transaction fee on securities trades exceeding $1 million in daily volume;
- (3) appropriations as Congress may provide.

(b-3) **Trust Administration.** The NLT shall:

- (1) receive applications from Regions documenting legacy liabilities;
- (2) verify claims through independent audit;
- (3) prioritize funding based on fiscal impact and public health urgency;
- (4) publish annual reports on legacy liability status nationwide.

(c) **Legacy Liability Sunset.** The Legacy Burden Factor shall be recalculated every ten years and shall phase out over fifty (50) years following ratification:

- (1) the Factor shall remain at full value for the first ten years following ratification;
- (2) beginning in year eleven, the Factor shall decline by two percent (2%) of its initial value annually;
- (3) by year sixty following ratification, the Legacy Burden Factor shall be zero;
- (4) this sunset ensures that legacy equity adjustments address historical burdens without creating permanent entitlements.

(d) **Anti-Manipulation.** No Region may:

- (1) incur new obligations and retroactively classify them as "legacy" liabilities;
- (2) defer maintenance or remediation to increase legacy burden claims;
- (3) manipulate pension assumptions to inflate unfunded liability calculations.
Violations shall result in forfeiture of NLT assistance and clawback of prior disbursements.

### Section 16. Forensic Audit Authority and Data Integrity

*[This section establishes forensic audit authority and data integrity requirements for Regional fiscal data submissions. See Gap 129.]*

(a) **Forensic Audit Authority.**

(1) The Independent Fiscal Council (IFC) and Allocation Review Board (ARB) shall possess authority to conduct unannounced forensic audits of Regional data systems;

(2) Audits may examine source records, data entry processes, and algorithmic transformations;

(3) Regions must provide auditors with full system access, including administrative credentials;

(4) Obstruction of forensic audit is treated as admission of data falsification.

(b) **Data Integrity Certification.**

(1) Regional officials certifying data submissions for federal purposes shall attest under penalty of perjury to data accuracy;

(2) Certification must identify the official responsible, data sources used, and any known limitations;

(3) Intentional false certification is a federal felony with mandatory removal from office;

(4) The IFC shall establish Data Integrity Standards that Regions must demonstrate compliance with annually.

(c) **Falsification Consequences.**

(1) Upon IFC or ARB finding of systematic data falsification, the affected Region's "Exclusive Domain" status for the affected sector is automatically suspended for three (3) years;

(2) Federal agencies assume direct data collection authority in the affected sector;

(3) All constitutional determinations made using falsified data are subject to reopening and revision;

(4) The Region must reimburse all equalization transfers received based on falsified data, plus interest and penalties.

(d) **Cross-Verification.**

(1) The IFC shall cross-verify Regional data submissions against:

- (A) Federal tax records;
- (B) Private sector economic indicators (energy consumption, freight volume, financial transactions);
- (C) Adjacent Regions' border-crossing data;
- (D) Satellite and remote sensing data where applicable;

(2) Material discrepancies trigger mandatory audit;

(3) Regions with consistent verification failures are placed on "Enhanced Monitoring" with quarterly audits;

(4) Three consecutive quarters of verification failure creates rebuttable presumption of falsification.

---

### Section 17. Independent Statistical Trust

*[This section establishes an Independent Statistical Trust to prevent fiscal data fraud and ensure the integrity of all statistics used for equalization, apportionment, and federal funding formulae. See Gap 236.]*

(a) **Establishment.** There shall be an Independent Statistical Trust (IST), insulated from political control, responsible for the collection, verification, and certification of all economic, demographic, and social data used for:

(1) Federal apportionment of funds;

(2) Fiscal Equalization calculations;

(3) Congressional representation;

(4) Cost-of-living adjustments to federal programs;

(5) Any constitutional or statutory formula requiring statistical inputs.

(b) **Independence.** The Independent Statistical Trust:

(1) is not part of the Executive Branch and does not report to the President;

(2) has Commissioners serving staggered 10-year terms, removable only for cause by two-thirds vote of the Senate;

(3) has constitutionally guaranteed funding equal to 0.1% of federal discretionary spending, not subject to executive impoundment;

(4) employs career statistical professionals under merit-based civil service protection;

(5) may not receive instructions from any elected official regarding methodology or findings.

(1) Regional and State GDP and economic output;

(2) Population counts between decennial censuses;

(3) Unemployment and labor force participation rates;

(4) Consumer price indices and inflation measures;

(5) Tax capacity and fiscal capacity for Equalization;

(6) Any other statistic used in federal funding formulae.

Regional statistics that have not been IST-certified may not be used for federal purposes.

(d) **Access Authority.** The IST:

(1) has unrestricted access to all Regional and State administrative data;

(2) may conduct independent surveys and sampling within any jurisdiction;

(3) may audit Regional statistical agencies at any time without notice;

(4) may subpoena records from private entities for statistical verification;

(5) Regional claims of data sovereignty do not apply to IST access for certification.

(e) **Methodology Transparency.** The IST:

(1) shall publish all methodologies for public review before implementation;

(2) shall submit major methodology changes to a 90-day public comment period;

(3) shall explain all statistical adjustments in public documentation;

(4) shall make microdata available to qualified researchers under privacy protections;

(5) may not classify statistical methodology or certification processes.

(f) **Statistical Fraud as High Crime.** Any official who:

(1) falsifies data submitted to the IST;

(2) obstructs IST access to source records;

(3) pressures IST personnel regarding findings;

(4) manipulates administrative data to distort certified statistics;

(5) retaliates against IST personnel or whistleblowers

commits a High Crime punishable by imprisonment of 5-20 years and permanent disqualification from public office.

(g) **Cross-Verification.** The IST shall:

(1) cross-verify Regional data against independent sources (tax records, satellite imagery, private economic indicators);

(2) flag statistically implausible claims for mandatory audit;

(3) maintain historical baselines to detect sudden unexplained changes;

(3) are produced under political direction regarding outcomes.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics, Census Bureau, and Bureau of Economic Analysis shall coordinate with IST or be absorbed into IST.

---

### Section 18. Full Funding Requirement for Federal Mandates

*[This section establishes the "No Money, No Mandate" rule, prohibiting unfunded federal mandates on Regional, State, and local governments. See Gap 241.]*

(a) **Full Funding Requirement.** Any Federal law, regulation, or Executive order that imposes a financial cost upon Regional, State, or local governments shall include a fully funded Federal appropriation to cover that cost. If the Federal Government does not appropriate funds to cover the implementation cost, the mandate is unenforceable.

(b) **Cost Determination.** For each Federal mandate:

(1) the Congressional Budget Office shall estimate total compliance costs to Regional, State, and local governments over a 10-year horizon;

(2) the estimate shall include direct costs, administrative costs, and opportunity costs;

(3) the estimate shall be published before any floor vote;

(4) Congress shall appropriate the full estimated cost or the mandate does not take effect.

(c) **Conditional Funding Prohibition.** The Federal Government may not:

(1) condition unrelated federal funding on compliance with new mandates;

(2) threaten withdrawal of existing funding to coerce acceptance of unfunded requirements;

(3) structure "voluntary" programs such that non-participation triggers effective penalties;

(4) use spending power to accomplish what would otherwise require unfunded mandate.

Coercive conditional funding arrangements are treated as unfunded mandates subject to this section and are subject to the Non-Coercion Standard of Section 4.

(d) **Regulatory Mandates.** Federal agency regulations imposing costs on Regional, State, or local governments:

(1) are subject to the same full funding requirement as statutory mandates;

(2) may not take effect until Congress appropriates implementation costs;

(3) require explicit statutory authorization--agencies may not independently create mandates;

(4) must include compliance cost estimates certified by the Office of Management and Budget.

(e) **Maintenance of Effort Limitation.** "Maintenance of Effort" requirements that compel Regional spending as condition of federal participation:

(1) may not exceed the level of spending that existed when the federal program began;

(2) must be adjusted for inflation and population changes;

(3) may not be used to ratchet up Regional spending obligations;

(4) expire after 5 years unless explicitly renewed by Congress.

(f) **Partial Funding Accountability.** If Congress provides partial funding for a mandate:

(1) the mandate is enforceable only to the extent of federal funding;

(2) Regions may scale implementation proportionally to funding received;

(3) Federal agencies may not penalize partial compliance due to partial funding;

(4) the gap between mandate and funding must be reported annually to Congress.

(g) **Existing Mandates.** For mandates enacted prior to ratification:

(1) Congress shall review all existing unfunded mandates within 5 years;

(2) each mandate must be either funded, modified to eliminate cost, or repealed;

(3) pending review, existing mandates remain in effect but may not be expanded;

(4) Regions may petition for expedited review of particularly burdensome mandates.

(h) **Enforcement.** Regional, State, and local governments may:

(1) refuse compliance with unfunded mandates without penalty;

(2) seek declaratory judgment that a federal requirement constitutes an unfunded mandate;

(3) recover compliance costs from the Federal Government if compelled to implement unfunded mandate;

(4) obtain injunctive relief against enforcement of unfunded mandates.

(i) **Emergency Exception.** This section does not apply to:

(1) mandates during a declared national emergency, for the duration of the emergency only;

(2) requirements necessary to protect constitutional rights (civil rights enforcement);

(3) mandates that merely prohibit conduct without requiring affirmative spending;

(4) reciprocal obligations incidental to federal grants voluntarily accepted.

(j) **Appropriations Protection.** Appropriations for mandate funding:

(1) may not be rescinded, impounded, or reprogrammed without Congressional action;

(2) are subject to automatic continuing resolution under Section 19 if new appropriation is not enacted;

(3) flow directly to implementing governments without executive discretion;

(4) are indexed to actual compliance costs, with true-up provisions for underestimates.

---

### Section 19. Automatic Continuing Resolution

*[This section constitutionally prohibits government shutdowns and establishes automatic appropriations if Congress fails to enact a budget. See Gap 170.]*

(a) **Prohibition on Shutdowns.** Government shutdowns are constitutionally prohibited. The Federal Government shall not cease operations due to failure to enact appropriations.

(b) **Automatic Appropriation.** If Congress fails to enact an appropriation bill for any department or agency by the first day of the fiscal year, the previous fiscal year's appropriation for that department or agency shall be automatically reenacted at ninety-eight percent (98%) of the prior level.

(c) **Monthly Continuation.** Automatic appropriations under subsection (b) shall continue on a monthly basis until new appropriations are enacted. Each month, the automatic level shall be recalculated at ninety-eight percent (98%) of the prior month's automatic level, creating compounding incentive to reach agreement.

(d) **Essential Functions Protection.** Notwithstanding subsections (b) and (c), the following constitutionally enumerated functions shall receive full appropriations at the prior fiscal year's enacted level, adjusted annually by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or by a successor index designated by statute:

(1) border security and immigration enforcement;

(2) interstate commerce regulation and enforcement;

(3) federal court operations, including the Constitutional Court, the Autonomy Review Board, and all Article III courts;

(4) election administration, including the Independent Electoral Commission;

(5) equalization payment processing and disbursement;

(6) debt service and existing obligation payments.

Congress may add functions to this list by two-thirds vote of both chambers, subject to judicial review for consistency with constitutional purposes. Removal from this list requires constitutional amendment.

(e) **No New Programs or Expansions.** During any period of automatic appropriation:

(1) no new programs, agencies, or spending initiatives may be funded;

(2) no existing programs may be expanded beyond their prior-year scope;

(3) no new obligations extending beyond the current fiscal year may be created;

(4) automatic appropriation authority extends only to programs authorized by Congress prior to the lapse in appropriations.

(f) **No Retroactive Reduction.** Obligations incurred and compensation earned during periods of automatic appropriation shall not be subject to retroactive reduction if a subsequent appropriation is enacted at a lower level.

(g) **Borrowing Authority.** Automatic appropriations under this Section shall be deemed appropriations authorized by Congress for purposes of Article I, Section 20. The Treasury shall have full borrowing authority to execute automatic appropriations on the same terms as legislated appropriations.

(h) **Termination.** Automatic appropriations terminate immediately upon enactment of regular appropriations for the affected fiscal year. Partial appropriations (covering some but not all departments or agencies) terminate automatic appropriation only for the departments or agencies covered by the enacted legislation.

(i) **Unauthorized Military Operations Exclusion.** Automatic appropriations under this section shall not fund military operations for which authorization under Article XI, Section 2, has expired, been terminated, or was never granted. The Comptroller General shall identify and quarantine such expenditures within thirty days of the commencement of any automatic appropriation period. Funds necessary for the orderly withdrawal of forces under Article XI, Section 2(j), are not subject to this exclusion.

---

### Section 20. Actuarial Honesty and Pension Discipline

*[This section prevents the accumulation of unfunded pension and retiree benefit liabilities through mandatory accrual funding, realistic actuarial assumptions, and automatic correction mechanisms. See Gap 202.]*

(a) **Full Accrual Funding Requirement.** All public pension systems, retiree healthcare systems, and other long-term employee benefit obligations of Regional, State, and local governments shall be funded on a current accrual basis:

- (1) the Annual Required Contribution (ARC) shall be calculated using actuarial standards promulgated by the Pension Actuarial Division of the Independent Fiscal Council;
- (2) governments shall contribute one hundred percent (100%) of the ARC each fiscal year;
- (3) failure to contribute one hundred percent (100%) of the ARC constitutes a fiscal violation subject to the intervention hierarchy under Section 10 of this Article.

(b) **Discount Rate Standards.** For purposes of calculating pension and benefit liabilities:

- (1) the discount rate shall be the yield on twenty-year Treasury bonds, plus a risk premium not to exceed one hundred (100) basis points;
- (2) assumed investment returns may not exceed historical thirty-year rolling averages for the pension system's actual asset allocation;
- (3) mortality assumptions shall use the most recent federal actuarial tables without modification;
- (4) the IFC shall audit discount rate assumptions annually.

Actuarial assumptions that systematically understate liabilities are prohibited.

(c) **Unfunded Liability Amortization.** Existing unfunded liabilities as of ratification shall be:

- (1) amortized over a maximum of twenty (20) years using level-dollar amortization;
- (2) included as a separate line item in Regional, State, and local budgets;
- (3) subject to annual progress reporting to the IFC.

No new unfunded liability may be created. Benefit enhancements must be fully funded at the time of enactment. Pre-ratification unfunded pension obligations are also subject to the Legacy Burden Factor under Section 15 of this Article, which provides equalization support but does not excuse the amortization obligation.

(d) **Automatic Contribution Trigger.** If a government fails to make its full ARC:

- (1) employee and employer contribution rates automatically increase by the shortfall percentage, divided equally;
- (2) the automatic increase takes effect the following fiscal year;
- (3) the government may override the automatic increase only by enacting equivalent benefit reductions or alternative funding sources certified as actuarially sufficient by the IFC;
- (4) failure to cure within two (2) fiscal years triggers enhanced oversight under Section 10 of this Article.

No government may manipulate its ARC calculation through assumption changes for the purpose of avoiding the automatic contribution trigger. The IFC may disregard assumption changes made within twelve (12) months of a trigger event if the changes lack independent actuarial justification.

(e) **Benefit Enhancement Restrictions.** No Regional, State, or local government may:

- (1) enhance pension or benefit formulas unless the enhancement is fully funded by increased contributions or reduced benefits elsewhere, as certified by the IFC;
- (2) allow pension spiking through artificial inflation of final average salary, including through overtime, unused leave payouts, or temporary reclassification;
- (3) grant retroactive benefit enhancements applying to service already rendered;
- (4) issue pension obligation bonds without IFC certification that the issuance improves net actuarial position over the full amortization period.

(f) **Transparency Requirements.** All public pension systems shall:

- (1) publish annual actuarial reports using standardized formats promulgated by the IFC;
- (2) disclose funded ratios, unfunded liabilities, and amortization schedules prominently in annual budgets;
- (3) provide thirty-year projections under assumptions certified by the IFC;
- (4) make all actuarial data available for independent analysis.

(g) **Enforcement.** Pension funding violations are subject to the fiscal intervention hierarchy under Section 10 of this Article. For purposes of Section 10:

- (1) failure to contribute one hundred percent (100%) of the ARC for a single fiscal year constitutes a fiscal condition warranting Stage 1 (Capacity Adjustment) review;
- (2) persistent ARC shortfalls exceeding two (2) consecutive fiscal years constitute fiscal negligence warranting Stage 2 review;
- (3) unfunded liability ratios exceeding seventy-five percent (75%) of annual Regional revenue, as calculated by the IFC, constitute grounds for Stage 3 (Solvency Suspension) consideration;
- (4) officials who knowingly approve inadequate contributions, or who knowingly submit false actuarial data, are subject to personal liability and removal under the same standards applicable to fiscal negligence under Section 10.

(h) **Relationship to Sovereign Reorganization.** In any Sovereign Reorganization proceeding under Section 6(j), pension obligations:

- (1) are subject to the priority ordering established by Section 6(j)(6);
- (2) may be modified only prospectively for future benefit accruals, not retroactively for benefits already earned;
- (3) must maintain minimum benefit floors established by the IFC;
- (4) may not be discharged entirely—some pension recovery is required even in insolvency.

## Design Rationale

### Why Independent Taxing Authority?

Fiscal dependence creates political dependence. If Regions rely on federal transfers for basic operations:

- federal government gains coercive leverage
- Regional policy independence becomes illusory
- political accountability becomes confused

Independent taxing authority ensures each level can fund its constitutional responsibilities without permission from other levels.

### Why Prohibit Unfunded Mandates?

Unfunded mandates allow higher levels of government to:

- impose costs on lower levels without political accountability
- claim credit for programs while shifting blame for funding
- effectively expand their power beyond enumerated limits

The prohibition makes the mandating government internalize costs, creating political accountability for its decisions.

### Why Equalization Transfers?

Without equalization, poorer Regions cannot provide basic governmental services:

- courts, elections, emergency services require minimum scale
- extreme inequality undermines national cohesion
- citizens in poor Regions become second-class

Equalization ensures baseline capacity everywhere while preserving fiscal independence for expenditures above the floor.

### Why Formula-Based Rather Than Discretionary?

Discretionary transfers become:

- political patronage tools
- subject to partisan manipulation
- unpredictable for recipient planning

Formula-based transfers create predictability, remove political discretion, and ensure equal treatment of similarly situated Regions.

### Why the Anti-Coercion Rule?

Conditional funding has been used to:

- compel states to adopt federal policies (drinking age, speed limits)
- expand federal authority beyond enumerated powers
- create effective federal control over nominally state functions

The anti-coercion rule prevents conditional funding from becoming a back door to unconstitutional federal expansion.

## Implementation Guidance

### Fiscal Equalization Act Requirements

Congress shall enact a Fiscal Equalization Act establishing:

**Formula Components:**

- measure of Regional fiscal capacity (tax base relative to costs)
- measure of Regional fiscal need (population, geography, service costs)
- equalization target (e.g., bring all Regions to median fiscal capacity)

**Process Requirements:**

- annual calculation by Independent Fiscal Council
- automatic appropriation (mandatory spending)
- formula revision only by supermajority vote

**Accountability:**

- annual reporting on transfers and Regional fiscal status
- auditing by Government Accountability Office
- five-year review cycle for formula adequacy

### Default Rule (Article XXI)

If Congress fails to enact the Fiscal Equalization Act within three years of ratification:

- equalization transfers shall be calculated as flat per-capita grants
- baseline level: five percent of federal revenues
- distributed to Regions with below-median fiscal capacity
- rate declines by one percentage point per year beginning in year six
- floor of two percent to incentivize congressional action
