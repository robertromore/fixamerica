# Regional Federal Constitution

## Overview

This directory contains the constitutional text for the Regional Federalism proposal. The constitution has been organized into focused documents for easier navigation.

## Core Regional Constitution

These documents contain provisions that are inherently tied to the regional structure:

| Document | Content |
|----------|---------|
| [01-regional-structure.md](01-regional-structure.md) | Article I: Regions, boundaries, regional constitutions |
| [02-powers-and-rights.md](02-powers-and-rights.md) | Articles II-III: Allocation of powers, rights floors |
| [03-regional-governance.md](03-regional-governance.md) | Articles IV-V: Regional legislatures and executives |
| [04-fiscal-system.md](04-fiscal-system.md) | Article X: Fiscal architecture and equalization |
| [05-safeguards.md](05-safeguards.md) | Articles XII-XIII: Secession, amendments |
| [06-supremacy.md](06-supremacy.md) | Articles XVIII-XX: Supremacy, transition, non-state entities |
| [07-implementation.md](07-implementation.md) | Articles XXI-XXII: Defaults and definitions |

## Companion Reforms

These reforms can be adopted independently OR as part of Regional Federalism. Full standalone versions are available in separate plan folders:

| Topic | Regional Article | Standalone Plan |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Lobbying/Anti-Corruption | Article IX | [plans/lobbying-reform/](../../../../single-topic/lobbying-reform/) |
| Federal Reserve | Article XI | [plans/federal-reserve-reform/](../../../../single-topic/federal-reserve-reform/) |
| Armed Forces/Civilian Control | Article XV | [plans/military-civilian-control/](../../../../single-topic/military-civilian-control/) |
| Cyber Defense | Article XVI | [plans/cyber-defense/](../../../../single-topic/cyber-defense/) |
| Emergency Powers | Article XVII | [plans/emergency-powers-reform/](../../../../single-topic/emergency-powers-reform/) |
| Impeachment | Article VI | [plans/impeachment-reform/](../../../../single-topic/impeachment-reform/) |
| Elections | Article VII | [plans/election-reform/](../../../../single-topic/election-reform/) |
| Judiciary | Article XIV | [plans/judicial-reform/](../../../../single-topic/judicial-reform/) |

## How the Pieces Fit Together

**If adopting Regional Federalism as a whole:**

- Use Articles I-XXII as a complete package
- The regional-specific and standalone reforms are integrated
- Cross-references work within the unified document

**If adopting reforms separately:**

- Each standalone plan can be adopted without regional structure
- Standalone versions adapt regional-specific provisions
- Reforms work with existing federal/state structure
