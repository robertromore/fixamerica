## Articles XXI-XXII: Default Rules, Definitions, and Commentary

*This document contains the implementation and definition provisions of the Regional Federal Constitution, plus the official non-binding commentary.*

---

## ARTICLE XXI - IMPLEMENTATION AND DEFAULT RULES

### Section 1. Congressional Implementation Duty

Congress shall enact enabling legislation to implement this Constitution, including but not limited to:

- an Allocation Framework Act defining jurisdictional boundaries and spillover criteria,
- a Fiscal Equalization Act establishing transfer formulas and the Independent Fiscal Council,
- an Elections Implementation Act specifying procedures for federal elections under Regional administration.

---

### Section 2. Default Rules Upon Congressional Failure

(a) If Congress fails to enact the Allocation Framework Act within two years of ratification, the allocation of powers shall be governed by existing federal-state divisions, with Regions exercising authority over matters previously requiring interstate compacts.

(b) If Congress fails to enact the Fiscal Equalization Act within three years of ratification, equalization transfers shall be calculated as flat per-capita grants at a baseline level equal to five percent of federal revenues, distributed to Regions with below-median fiscal capacity.

(b-1) **IFC Adjustment Authority.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall have authority to adjust the default formula annually to maximize regional fiscal capacity equalization, subject to the following:

(1) The five percent rate is a ceiling for default transfers; Congress may enact higher rates by statute;

(2) The default rate does not decline over time absent Congressional action;

(3) Congressional inaction costs Donor Regions (higher automatic transfers) rather than Recipient Regions (declining transfers), inverting the incentive structure to encourage legislative engagement.

(b-2) **Annual Capacity Assessment.** The IFC shall publish annually:

(1) Regional fiscal capacity indices;

(2) Equalization transfer recommendations;

(3) Assessment of whether current transfers achieve constitutional equalization goals.

(b-3) **Emergency Adjustment Trigger.** If the IFC determines that:

(1) Regional fiscal capacity divergence exceeds twenty-five percent (25%) from baseline; OR

(2) Any Region cannot meet basic governmental functions due to fiscal constraints; OR

(3) Economic shocks have rendered existing formulas inadequate;

the IFC may adjust the default transfer formula within the five percent ceiling.

(b-4) **Emergency Adjustment Limitations.** IFC emergency adjustments:

(1) May not exceed twenty percent (20%) change from prior year formula;

(2) Require published justification;

(3) Are subject to Congressional override by simple majority within ninety (90) days.

(b-5) **Anti-Obstruction Provisions.** Fiscal Equalization Acts shall receive expedited consideration:

(1) Privileged motion status in both chambers;

(2) Limited debate time (twenty hours per chamber);

(3) No amendments not germane to fiscal equalization;

(4) Guaranteed floor vote within sixty (60) days of committee reporting.

(b-6) **Poison Pill Prohibition.** Provisions in a Fiscal Equalization Act that:

(1) Address matters unrelated to fiscal equalization;

(2) Would require supermajority approval under other constitutional provisions;

(3) Are designed to make the Act unacceptable to Recipient Regions;

are severable and may be struck by the ARB without invalidating the remainder.

(c) If Congress fails to enact the Elections Implementation Act within two years of ratification, the following default rules apply:

- The national popular vote requirement of Article VII, Section 2 remains in full force.
- Administrative procedures (voter registration, ballot design, counting methods) shall follow prior federal law as adapted for Regional administration.
- Regions assume the administrative role previously held by States.
- Any provisions of prior federal law inconsistent with the national popular vote requirement (including the Electoral College) are superseded and inapplicable.
- If no candidate receives a majority of votes cast, a runoff election between the two candidates receiving the most votes shall be held within twenty-one days. If Congress has enacted a different majority mechanism (such as ranked-choice voting or instant runoff), that mechanism supersedes this default.

(d) If Congress fails to enact appropriations for any fiscal year by the start of that fiscal year, the following automatic fiscal continuation shall apply:

- Spending shall continue at the prior fiscal year's enacted levels for all previously authorized programs.
- Prior-year levels shall be adjusted by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or by a successor index designated by statute.
- No new programs, expansions of existing programs, or new spending initiatives may be funded under automatic continuation.
- Automatic continuation terminates upon enactment of appropriations for the affected fiscal year.

(e) Default rules remain in effect until Congress enacts superseding legislation.

---

### Section 3. Purpose

These default rules exist to prevent deliberate nonimplementation from becoming a method of constitutional sabotage. The Constitution shall operate even if Congress fails to act.

---

### Section 4. Partial Adoption Safeguards

(a) **Supplement Activation Condition.** No RF supplement (Article XIV-RF, XI-RF, or XVII-RF) shall take effect unless the corresponding standalone amendment, or federal legislation establishing equivalent protections meeting the minimum requirements enumerated in that supplement's compatibility clause, has been adopted. Until that condition is met, the subject matter governed by the supplement shall continue under prior constitutional and statutory law as modified by this Constitution's core articles.

(b) **Minimum Safeguard Defaults.** If the core articles of this Constitution are ratified and any standalone amendment has not been adopted within four years of ratification, the following defaults shall take effect by operation of law and remain in force until the corresponding standalone amendment or equivalent legislation is adopted:

(1) *Judicial default.* All cases arising under this Constitution, including disputes between Regions, between a Region and the Federal Government, and challenges to Regional or Federal legislation under this Constitution, shall be heard by the federal courts established under the existing Constitution. The Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction over inter-Regional disputes. No court established under this Constitution shall operate without mandatory jurisdiction over constitutional challenges, published time limits for decisions, and merit-based selection procedures.

(2) *Military default.* No armed forces of the United States, including any Regional Guard force, shall be deployed for domestic law enforcement or civil governance purposes except upon concurrent authorization of the President and a majority of Regional Governors whose Regions are affected. The duty of any member of the armed forces to refuse orders that violate this Constitution or the laws of war shall not be diminished by the absence of the Military Civilian Control Amendment. No Regional Guard force shall be established until civilian control safeguards meeting the compatibility clause requirements of Article XI-RF are in effect.

(3) *Emergency powers default.* No declaration of emergency by a Regional Governor or the President shall suspend the rights guaranteed by Article III of this Constitution or the existing Bill of Rights. Emergency declarations shall expire after thirty days unless reauthorized by the declaring authority's legislature. No emergency declaration shall be used to expand the declaring authority's substantive powers beyond those enumerated in this Constitution. Judicial review of emergency measures shall be available within forty-eight hours of any individual petition.

(c) **Equivalent Legislation Standard.** Federal legislation satisfying a supplement's compatibility clause must:

(1) Address each requirement enumerated in the compatibility clause;

(2) Be adopted by a three-fifths vote of the House;

(3) Not be subject to repeal or material amendment that weakens the protections established therein by simple majority for ten years following adoption; technical, conforming, or strengthening amendments are not subject to this restriction;

(4) Be certified as meeting compatibility clause requirements by the Allocation Review Board.

(d) **Adoption Status Reporting.** Beginning one year after ratification and annually thereafter until all standalone amendments or equivalent legislation have been adopted, the Allocation Review Board shall publish a Partial Adoption Status Report identifying: which supplements remain inactive, which defaults are in effect, whether existing defaults have proven sufficient, and recommended actions. Congress shall hold public hearings on each report within ninety days of publication.
