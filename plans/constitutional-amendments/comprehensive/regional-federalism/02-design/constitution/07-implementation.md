*This document contains the implementation and definition provisions of the Regional Federal Constitution, plus the official non-binding commentary.*

---

## ARTICLE XXI - IMPLEMENTATION AND DEFAULT RULES

### Section 1. Congressional Implementation Duty

Congress shall enact enabling legislation to implement this Constitution, including but not limited to:

- an Allocation Framework Act defining jurisdictional boundaries and spillover criteria,
- a Fiscal Equalization Act establishing transfer formulas and the Independent Fiscal Council,
- an Elections Implementation Act specifying procedures for federal elections under Regional administration.

---

### Section 2. Default Rules Upon Congressional Failure

(a) If Congress fails to enact the Allocation Framework Act within two years of ratification, the allocation of powers shall be governed by existing federal-state divisions, with Regions exercising authority over matters previously requiring interstate compacts.

(b) If Congress fails to enact the Fiscal Equalization Act within three years of ratification, equalization transfers shall be calculated as flat per-capita grants at a baseline level equal to five percent of federal revenues, distributed to Regions with below-median fiscal capacity.

(b-1) **IFC Adjustment Authority.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall have authority to adjust the default formula annually to maximize regional fiscal capacity equalization, subject to the following:

(1) The five percent rate is a ceiling for default transfers; Congress may enact higher rates by statute;

(2) The default rate does not decline over time absent Congressional action;

(3) Congressional inaction costs Donor Regions (higher automatic transfers) rather than Recipient Regions (declining transfers), inverting the incentive structure to encourage legislative engagement.

(b-2) **Annual Capacity Assessment.** The IFC shall publish annually:

(1) Regional fiscal capacity indices;

(2) Equalization transfer recommendations;

(3) Assessment of whether current transfers achieve constitutional equalization goals.

(b-3) **Emergency Adjustment Trigger.** If the IFC determines that:

(1) Regional fiscal capacity divergence exceeds twenty-five percent (25%) from baseline; OR

(2) Any Region cannot meet basic governmental functions due to fiscal constraints; OR

(3) Economic shocks have rendered existing formulas inadequate;

the IFC may adjust the default transfer formula within the five percent ceiling.

(b-4) **Emergency Adjustment Limitations.** IFC emergency adjustments:

(1) May not exceed twenty percent (20%) change from prior year formula;

(2) Require published justification;

(3) Are subject to Congressional override by simple majority within ninety (90) days.

(b-5) **Anti-Obstruction Provisions.** Fiscal Equalization Acts shall receive expedited consideration:

(1) Privileged motion status in both chambers;

(2) Limited debate time (twenty hours per chamber);

(3) No amendments not germane to fiscal equalization;

(4) Guaranteed floor vote within sixty (60) days of committee reporting.

(b-6) **Poison Pill Prohibition.** Provisions in a Fiscal Equalization Act that:

(1) Address matters unrelated to fiscal equalization;

(2) Would require supermajority approval under other constitutional provisions;

(3) Are designed to make the Act unacceptable to Recipient Regions;

are severable and may be struck by the ARB without invalidating the remainder.

(c) If Congress fails to enact the Elections Implementation Act within two years of ratification, the following default rules apply:

- The national popular vote requirement of Article VII, Section 2 remains in full force.
- Administrative procedures (voter registration, ballot design, counting methods) shall follow prior federal law as adapted for Regional administration.
- Regions assume the administrative role previously held by States.
- Any provisions of prior federal law inconsistent with the national popular vote requirement (including the Electoral College) are superseded and inapplicable.
- If no candidate receives a majority of votes cast, a runoff election between the two candidates receiving the most votes shall be held within twenty-one days. If Congress has enacted a different majority mechanism (such as ranked-choice voting or instant runoff), that mechanism supersedes this default.

(d) If Congress fails to enact appropriations for any fiscal year by the start of that fiscal year, the Automatic Continuing Resolution provisions of Article X, Section 19 shall apply.

(e) Default rules remain in effect until Congress enacts superseding legislation.

### Section 2-A. Implementation Act Integrity

*Resolves Gap 7 — Implementation Act Dependency and Statutory Capture. This section exists to prevent statutory capture of the constitutional system's operational infrastructure. It extends anti-obstruction and poison pill protections to all three core implementation acts, establishes supermajority protection against statutory capture, constitutionalizes institutional independence floors, and creates an escalation mechanism for prolonged default operation. Where ambiguity exists, this section shall be construed to preserve the independence, adequacy, and operational integrity of the three core implementation acts and the institutions they establish.*

(a) **Scope.** This section applies to the three implementation acts required by Section 1: the Allocation Framework Act, the Fiscal Equalization Act, and the Elections Implementation Act, and to any successor legislation that substantially replaces their functions. For purposes of this section, "successor legislation" includes any legislation, whether enacted as a single measure or cumulatively over time, that in aggregate substantially replaces or displaces the functions of an implementation act. The Allocation Review Board may petition the Supreme Court for a determination that a series of enactments constitutes cumulative displacement subject to the protections of this section.

(b) **Universal Anti-Obstruction.** The expedited consideration procedures of Section 2(b-5) shall apply to all three implementation acts, not solely to Fiscal Equalization Acts. For purposes of this subsection, "germane" means directly related to the subject matter of the implementation act under consideration. For the Fiscal Equalization Act, the protections of this subsection supplement and do not narrow the protections of Section 2(b-5); where both apply, the provision affording greater protection shall control.

(c) **Universal Poison Pill Prohibition.** The severability provisions of Section 2(b-6) shall apply to all three implementation acts. Provisions in any implementation act that address matters unrelated to that act's subject matter, would require supermajority approval under other constitutional provisions, or are designed to make the act unacceptable to affected Regions are severable and may be struck by the Allocation Review Board without invalidating the remainder. For the Fiscal Equalization Act, the protections of this subsection supplement and do not narrow the protections of Section 2(b-6); where both apply, the provision affording greater protection shall control.

(d) **Supermajority Protection Against Statutory Capture.** Once enacted, an implementation act:

- (1) May not be repealed in whole by less than a three-fifths vote of each chamber of Congress;
- (2) May not be amended in a manner that materially weakens the protections, institutions, or operational framework established therein by less than a three-fifths vote of each chamber;
- (3) May be amended to strengthen protections, correct technical errors, conform to other constitutional provisions, or improve operational effectiveness by simple majority; provided that any bill containing provisions that both strengthen and materially weaken the implementation act shall be treated as a material weakening amendment under paragraph (2) and shall require a three-fifths vote of each chamber;
- (4) This supermajority requirement expires fifteen (15) years after the implementation act's initial enactment, after which the act may be amended or repealed by simple majority. Congress may re-enact the supermajority protection for one additional period not exceeding ten (10) years by a three-fifths vote. No further renewal of the supermajority protection period is permitted under this subsection; thereafter, the act may be amended or repealed by simple majority;
- (5) The supermajority protection under paragraphs (1) and (2) does not apply during the first Congress seated after the implementation act's initial enactment. During this period, the act may be amended or repealed by simple majority. The fifteen-year protection period commences upon the seating of the second Congress following initial enactment;
- (6) Amendments to an implementation act enacted during a lame-duck session (between a general election and the seating of the subsequent Congress) are subject to the three-fifths requirement under paragraph (2) regardless of whether they purport to strengthen the act. Simple-majority amendments enacted during a lame-duck session take effect ninety (90) days after enactment, during which period the incoming Congress may override them by simple majority;
- (7) If an implementation act also qualifies as equivalent legislation under Section 4(c), the longer supermajority protection period shall apply. The protections are cumulative, not alternative.

(e) **Material Weakening Defined.** For purposes of subsection (d)(2), "material weakening" includes but is not limited to:

- (1) Reducing equalization transfer amounts, rates, or coverage below the levels established in the most recent enactment;
- (2) Eliminating, defunding, or reducing the operational independence of any institution established by the implementation act;
- (3) Removing anti-manipulation, anti-gaming, or enforcement provisions;
- (4) Narrowing the scope of protected populations, jurisdictions, or functions;
- (5) Transferring implementation authority from an independent body to a politically appointed one;
- (6) For purposes of subsection (d)(3), "technical errors" means errors in cross-references, numbering, typographical errors, and conforming changes necessitated by renumbering or reorganization. A change that alters the substantive rights, obligations, institutional authorities, or funding levels established by the implementation act is not a technical correction regardless of how it is characterized.

(f) **Material Weakening Determination.** Whether an amendment constitutes "material weakening" under subsection (d)(2):

- (1) Shall be determined by the Allocation Review Board upon petition by any Region, any member of Congress, or the board of any institution established by the implementation act;
- (2) The ARB shall issue its determination within sixty (60) days of petition;
- (3) The ARB's determination is subject to judicial review by the Supreme Court on an expedited basis, with a decision due within one hundred twenty (120) days of petition for review. The Court shall review legal questions (whether the amendment constitutes material weakening under the constitutional definition in subsection (e)) de novo and factual findings for clear error;
- (4) Legislation determined to constitute material weakening that was enacted by less than a three-fifths vote is void ab initio;
- (5) If legislation is declared void under paragraph (4), the prior version of the implementation act is restored in full force. The ARB shall provide a reasonable transition period, not exceeding one hundred eighty (180) days, for affected institutions and parties to conform to the restored provisions. Contracts entered and personnel actions taken in good-faith reliance on the voided legislation shall be honored for the duration of the transition period.

(g) **Appropriations Protection.** Appropriations for the administration of implementation acts and the institutions established thereunder:

- (1) Shall not be conditioned on the adoption or rejection of any substantive policy unrelated to the act's subject matter;
- (2) Shall not be reduced below the level necessary for the institution to perform its constitutionally and statutorily mandated functions, as certified by the Independent Fiscal Council;
- (3) If Congress fails to appropriate adequate funds for any implementation institution for one (1) fiscal year, that institution's funding shall be treated as mandatory spending at the level of its most recent adequate appropriation, adjusted for inflation, until Congress enacts a superseding appropriation. During any period in which Congress has not appropriated adequate funds but the mandatory spending trigger under this paragraph has not yet activated, the institution may draw upon its prior-year unobligated balances and reserves. The IFC shall certify quarterly whether the institution's funding level permits it to perform its mandated functions; if the IFC certifies that it does not, the mandatory spending trigger under this paragraph activates immediately regardless of the one-year waiting period;
- (4) Congress may not impose new mandated functions on an implementation institution without appropriating funds sufficient for the institution to perform those functions in addition to its existing mandates, as certified by the Independent Fiscal Council.

(h) **Constitutional Independence Floor for Implementation Institutions.** Any institution established by an implementation act to exercise independent, quasi-judicial, regulatory, or administrative judgment (including but not limited to the Independent Fiscal Council, any allocation or boundary determination body, and any election administration body) shall have the following constitutional minimums that the implementing statute may supplement but not diminish:

- (1) **Appointment diversity.** No single appointing authority (President, Speaker, Senate President Pro Tempore, or Chief Justice) may appoint a majority of members;
- (2) **Removal only for cause.** Members may be removed only for incapacity, conviction of a felony, or serious misconduct — not for policy disagreements — by a two-thirds vote of the Senate;
- (3) **Compensation protection.** Member compensation may not be reduced during their term of service;
- (4) **Budgetary floor.** The institution shall receive mandatory appropriations at a level not less than the greater of: (A) the level certified as adequate by the institution's board and confirmed by the Government Accountability Office within sixty (60) days, with confirmation presumed if the GAO fails to act within that period; or (B) the prior year's appropriation adjusted by the Consumer Price Index. Congress may appropriate higher amounts;
- (5) **Operational autonomy.** The institution shall set its own rules of procedure, hire its own staff, and control its own budget allocation within the total appropriated amount;
- (6) **Anti-retaliation.** No federal official may retaliate against an implementation institution or its members for findings, recommendations, or certifications made in the exercise of their statutory duties;
- (7) **Savings clause.** Where an institution's enabling constitutional provision establishes protections exceeding these minimums, the more protective provision controls. Nothing in this subsection diminishes protections established elsewhere in this Constitution.

(h-1) **Institutional Creation Mandate.** Each implementation act shall designate or establish one or more independent institutions for the administration of its core functions. Delegation of an implementation act's primary administrative authority to politically appointed executive branch officials is prohibited. Congress may assign secondary or coordinating roles to executive branch agencies, but the institution exercising independent judgment over the act's core determinations must satisfy the independence requirements of subsection (h).

(i) **Default Operation Escalation.** If Congress has not enacted any one of the three implementation acts within the deadlines specified in Section 2:

- (1) The ARB shall include in each annual Partial Adoption Status Report under Section 4(d) a specific assessment of whether prolonged default operation is degrading constitutional system performance;
- (2) If any implementation act remains unenacted ten (10) years after ratification, the ARB shall issue a formal Implementation Failure Finding, which shall be transmitted to the President, Congress, and all Regional Governors;
- (3) An Implementation Failure Finding triggers mandatory congressional hearings within sixty (60) days and a privileged floor vote on a proposed implementation act within one hundred eighty (180) days;
- (4) If Congress fails to act within one (1) year of an Implementation Failure Finding, the IFC and ARB shall jointly have authority to promulgate binding interim regulations to supplement the default rules of Section 2, subject to the following limitations: (A) interim regulations may not create new institutions or impose new taxes; (B) interim regulations expire two (2) years after promulgation unless Congress enacts superseding legislation; (C) interim regulations are subject to judicial review under an arbitrary-and-capricious standard, examining whether the regulation is within the scope authorized by this subsection, is rationally related to supplementing the default rules, and does not exceed the limitations of paragraph (A); (D) the IFC and ARB shall provide at least sixty (60) days for public notice and comment before promulgating interim regulations, and shall consult with all Regional Governors before promulgation of regulations that affect Regional powers or boundaries; (E) upon expiration of the two-year period, the system reverts to the default rules of Section 2; the IFC and ARB may re-promulgate interim regulations only after issuing a new Implementation Failure Finding; interim regulations may not contradict or diminish the default rules of Section 2 — they may only supplement them.

(j) **Successor Legislation.** If Congress repeals an implementation act and enacts successor legislation:

- (1) The successor legislation is subject to this section upon enactment;
- (2) The supermajority protection period under subsection (d)(4) resets upon enactment of successor legislation;
- (3) If the ARB determines that the successor legislation constitutes material weakening of the repealed act, the provisions of subsection (d) and (f) apply to the repeal itself, and the repeal is void unless enacted by three-fifths vote;
- (4) If a repeal is voided under paragraph (3), any successor legislation enacted in the same legislative vehicle or as a companion measure is also void. Congress may re-enact the successor legislation as a standalone amendment to the restored act, subject to the provisions of subsection (d).

(k) **Savings Clause.** Nothing in this section prevents Congress from enacting additional implementation legislation beyond the three required acts, but such additional legislation is not subject to the protections of this section unless Congress expressly designates it as an implementation act by three-fifths vote.

(l) **Reversion to Defaults.** If an implementation act is repealed and no successor legislation is enacted simultaneously, the default rules of Section 2 shall immediately resume operation as though the implementation act had never been enacted. The ARB shall publish notice of the reversion within five (5) days.

---

### Section 3. Purpose

These default rules exist to prevent deliberate nonimplementation from becoming a method of constitutional sabotage. The Constitution shall operate even if Congress fails to act.

---

### Section 4. Partial Adoption Safeguards

*Addresses Gap 275 — Partial Amendment Adoption Risk ("Half-Built House"). Ensures partial adoption of the modular architecture degrades gracefully by preventing RF supplements from activating without corresponding safeguard frameworks, establishing protective defaults, and creating institutional pressure toward complete adoption.*

(a) **Supplement Activation Condition.** No RF supplement (Article XIV-RF, XI-RF, or XVII-RF) shall take effect unless the corresponding standalone amendment, or federal legislation establishing equivalent protections meeting the minimum requirements enumerated in that supplement's compatibility clause, has been adopted. Until that condition is met, the subject matter governed by the supplement shall continue under prior constitutional and statutory law as modified by this Constitution's core articles.

(b) **Minimum Safeguard Defaults.** If the core articles of this Constitution are ratified and any standalone amendment has not been adopted within four years of ratification, the following defaults shall take effect by operation of law and remain in force until the corresponding standalone amendment or equivalent legislation is adopted:

(1) *Judicial default.* All cases arising under this Constitution, including disputes between Regions, between a Region and the Federal Government, and challenges to Regional or Federal legislation under this Constitution, shall be heard by the federal courts established under the existing Constitution. The Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction over inter-Regional disputes. No court established under this Constitution shall operate without mandatory jurisdiction over constitutional challenges, published time limits for decisions, and merit-based selection procedures.

(2) *Military default.* No armed forces of the United States, including any Regional Guard force, shall be deployed for domestic law enforcement or civil governance purposes except upon concurrent authorization of the President and a majority of Regional Governors whose Regions are affected. The duty of any member of the armed forces to refuse orders that violate this Constitution or the laws of war shall not be diminished by the absence of the Military Civilian Control Amendment. No Regional Guard force shall be established until civilian control safeguards meeting the compatibility clause requirements of Article XI-RF are in effect.

(3) *Emergency powers default.* No declaration of emergency by a Regional Governor or the President shall suspend the rights guaranteed by Article III of this Constitution or the existing Bill of Rights. Emergency declarations shall expire after thirty days unless reauthorized by the declaring authority's legislature. No emergency declaration shall be used to expand the declaring authority's substantive powers beyond those enumerated in this Constitution. Judicial review of emergency measures shall be available within forty-eight hours of any individual petition.

(c) **Equivalent Legislation Standard.** Federal legislation satisfying a supplement's compatibility clause must:

(1) Address each requirement enumerated in the compatibility clause;

(2) Be adopted by a three-fifths vote of the House;

(3) Not be subject to repeal or material amendment that weakens the protections established therein by simple majority for ten years following adoption; technical, conforming, or strengthening amendments are not subject to this restriction;

(4) Be certified as meeting compatibility clause requirements by the Allocation Review Board.

(d) **Adoption Status Reporting.** Beginning one year after ratification and annually thereafter until all standalone amendments or equivalent legislation have been adopted, the Allocation Review Board shall publish a Partial Adoption Status Report identifying: which supplements remain inactive, which defaults are in effect, whether existing defaults have proven sufficient, and recommended actions. Congress shall hold public hearings on each report within ninety days of publication.

### Section 5. Data Continuity During Transition

*[This section establishes data handover protocols during the transition from State to Regional authority, preventing hostile States from sequestering or destroying critical administrative data. See Gap 105.]*

#### Mirror Repository Requirement

(a) **Mirror Repository Mandate.** All States shall maintain "Mirror Repositories" of data pertaining to transferred Regional powers:

(1) Water usage, allocation, and quality records;

(2) Energy generation, transmission, and grid load data;

(3) Public health statistics and disease surveillance;

(4) Transportation infrastructure condition and usage.

(b) **Data Standards.** Mirror Repositories shall:

(1) Use machine-readable, open formats specified by the Federal Data Coordinator;

(2) Include complete records for the ten (10) years preceding transfer;

(3) Be updated continuously until transfer completion.

(c) **Transfer Timeline.** States shall provide complete Mirror Repository access to Regional governments:

(1) Within thirty (30) days of Regional government formation;

(2) With technical documentation enabling immediate use;

(3) With trained personnel available for transition assistance.

(d) **Completeness Certification.** The Federal Data Coordinator shall certify:

(1) That State repositories meet completeness standards;

(2) That data formats are usable by Regional systems;

(3) Certification required before State transfer obligations are deemed satisfied.

#### Constitutional Enforcement

(e) **Restoration Mandate Breach.** Failure to provide complete, machine-readable records within thirty (30) days:

(1) Constitutes a breach of the Restoration Mandate under Article XII;

(2) Triggers mandatory ARB intervention;

(3) May result in federal assumption of data management functions.

(f) **Data Destruction Prohibition.** States may not:

(1) Destroy, delete, or render unusable data subject to transfer;

(2) Claim routine records retention policies exempt transfer data;

(3) Transfer data to private entities to avoid transfer obligations.

(g) **Criminal Accountability.** State officials who deliberately destroy or sequester transfer data:

(1) Are personally liable for damages caused by data loss;

(2) May be prosecuted for obstruction of constitutional transition;

(3) Are disqualified from Regional office for ten (10) years.

#### Continuity Safeguards

(h) **Federal Backup Repository.** The Federal Data Coordinator shall maintain:

(1) Backup copies of all State data subject to Regional transfer;

(2) Real-time synchronization with State systems during transition period;

(3) Authority to provide data directly to Regions if States fail to comply.

(i) **Transition Assistance.** The Federal government shall provide:

(1) Technical assistance to Regions receiving data transfers;

(2) Funding for data integration and system development;

(3) Personnel support during the initial operational period.

(j) **Service Continuity.** If data transfer failures threaten essential services:

(1) The State shall continue operating transferred functions until data is available;

(2) State costs during extended operation are borne by the State as consequence of non-compliance;

(3) The Region assumes authority immediately upon data availability.

---

### Section 6. Regulatory Continuity and Transition

*Addresses Gap 184: The Regulatory Void (The Day 1 Problem). Prevents regulatory collapse when jurisdiction over Exclusive Domains transfers from federal to Regional authority by establishing automatic continuity of existing federal law as Transitional Regional Law.*

#### Continuity of Law

(a) **Transitional Regional Law.** Upon the ratification of this Constitution, all federal statutes, regulations, and administrative rules governing matters within the Exclusive Domains of the Regions shall continue in full force and effect as "Transitional Regional Law."

(b) **Status.** Transitional Regional Law shall have the force of Regional statutory law. It may be amended or repealed only by the Regional Legislature or appropriate Regional regulatory authority. Congress shall have no authority to amend such law after ratification.

#### Enforcement Bridge

(c) **Federal Administration.** For a period of five (5) years following ratification, or until the Allocation Review Board certifies that a Region has established sufficient regulatory and enforcement capacity, whichever is earlier, federal agencies shall continue to administer and enforce Transitional Regional Law within that Region.

(d) **Cost Reimbursement.** The Region shall reimburse the Federal Government for the full cost of such administration and enforcement. Failure to reimburse shall constitute a debt subject to offset against federal transfers.

(e) **Personnel.** Federal employees engaged in such enforcement shall be offered transfer to the corresponding Regional agency with preservation of seniority and pension credits, or may be seconded to the Regional government.

#### Conversion and Sunset

(f) **Five-Year Conversion.** Any Transitional Regional Law that has not been affirmatively amended, repealed, or replaced by the Region within five (5) years of ratification shall automatically convert to permanent Regional statutory law.

(g) **No Voiding.** The expiration of the transition period shall not cause any Transitional Regional Law to lapse or become void; it ensures only that the law loses its "Transitional" character.

#### Judicial Jurisdiction

(h) **Transitional Jurisdiction.** During the period of federal administration under subsection (c), federal courts shall retain jurisdiction over disputes arising under Transitional Regional Law, applying Regional law as the rule of decision. Upon certification of Regional capacity, jurisdiction shall transfer to Regional courts.

#### Good Faith Implementation

(i) **Deregulation by Delay Prohibited.** No Region may engage in deregulation by delay. The Allocation Review Board may issue compliance orders if a Region intentionally fails to establish regulatory capacity for the purpose of avoiding the enforcement of Transitional Regional Law.

---

### Section 7. Regional Institutional Capacity Development

*This section establishes a structured framework for building Regional institutional capacity during and after the transition from State-based governance, preventing early performance disparities from undermining the legitimacy of the constitutional system. See Gap 13.*

#### Tiered Capacity Assessment

(a) **Capacity Assessment Framework.** The Allocation Review Board, in consultation with the Independent Fiscal Council, shall assess each Region's institutional capacity according to a three-tier framework:

(1) **Tier 1 — Foundational Capacity.** A Region achieves Foundational Capacity when it demonstrates the "minimum institutional capacity" defined in Article XXII, Section 6(b): functional executive, legislative, and judicial branches; ability to collect and disburse tax revenue; operational emergency services; an educational system meeting federal accreditation standards; and participation in inter-Regional data sharing systems;

(2) **Tier 2 — Operational Capacity.** A Region achieves Operational Capacity when, in addition to Tier 1 requirements, it demonstrates: (A) the ability to independently administer all Exclusive Domain powers assigned to it under Article II, Section 1(e)(2), without reliance on federal bridge administration under Section 6(c) of this Article; (B) independent fiscal operations, including tax administration, budget execution, and debt management, certified by the IFC; (C) a functioning Regional judiciary with case management systems, adequate staffing, and compliance with constitutional deadlines; (D) regulatory agencies capable of enforcement within Regional Exclusive Domains; and (E) demonstrated capacity to engage in inter-Regional coordination, including participation in ARB and IFC proceedings and the ability to negotiate and administer intergovernmental agreements;

(3) **Tier 3 — Full Capacity.** A Region achieves Full Capacity when, in addition to Tier 2 requirements, it demonstrates sustained performance over three (3) consecutive annual assessments in which: (A) no Minimum Institutional Capacity function has fallen below federal standards; (B) the Regional judiciary meets or exceeds constitutional case-processing deadlines; (C) Regional fiscal operations receive an unqualified audit opinion from the IFC; and (D) the Region has no outstanding ARB compliance orders related to deficiency in any function enumerated in Article XXII, Section 6(b).

(b) **Assessment Schedule and Procedure.** The ARB shall:

(1) conduct initial capacity assessments of all Regions within one (1) year of ratification;

(2) conduct annual capacity assessments thereafter until all Regions achieve Tier 3;

(3) publish assessment criteria, methodology, and data at least ninety (90) days before each assessment cycle;

(4) provide each Region a draft assessment and sixty (60) days to respond before final publication;

(5) use objective, quantified criteria to the maximum extent practicable. Assessment criteria shall be uniform across all Regions, and no Region shall be assessed against a standard not applied to all Regions;

(6) before adopting or materially amending assessment criteria, provide sixty (60) days for public notice and comment. Regions, federal agencies, and any interested party may submit comments. The ARB shall publish a response to significant comments received;

(7) establish an Assessment Review Panel consisting of three (3) independent experts in public administration — two (2) appointed by the ARB and one (1) appointed by the Chief Justice of the United States — for staggered four-year terms. A Region may petition the Panel for independent review of any final tier determination. The Panel shall issue a binding recommendation within ninety (90) days. Panel members may not be current or former employees of any Region, the ARB, or the IFC, and must have no financial interest in the outcome. The ARB shall publish and implement all Panel recommendations.

#### Graduated Authority Transfer

(c) **Constitutional Authority Distinguished from Operational Responsibility.** All Regions possess full constitutional authority within their enumerated powers from the date of ratification. This section governs the transfer of *operational responsibility* — the practical administration of governmental functions — from federal bridge agencies to Regional institutions. No provision of this section diminishes a Region's constitutional authority or legal standing.

(d) **Transfer Schedule.** Operational responsibility shall transfer to each Region according to the following schedule:

(1) **Upon ratification:** All Regions exercise Shared Domain powers alongside the federal government; federal bridge administration under Section 6(c) commences for Exclusive Domain enforcement;

(2) **Upon Tier 1 certification:** The Region assumes direct operational responsibility for emergency services coordination, tax collection (with IFC technical support), and legislative and executive functions. The federal bridge continues for regulatory enforcement and judicial operations;

(3) **Upon Tier 2 certification:** The Region assumes full operational responsibility for all Exclusive Domain functions. Federal bridge administration under Section 6(c) terminates. The Region independently manages fiscal operations, regulatory enforcement, and judicial administration;

(4) **Upon Tier 3 certification:** The Region is fully autonomous. Annual ARB capacity assessments transition to the standard IFC annual certification under Article XXII, Section 6(b);

(5) **Bridge-Override Clause.** Where the transfer schedule established by this subsection conflicts with the five-year limitation in Section 6(c) of this Article, this subsection shall control. Federal bridge administration for any individual functional domain may extend beyond five (5) years if the Region has not achieved Tier 2 certification for that domain, provided that: (A) no federal bridge administration for any single functional domain shall continue beyond seven (7) years from ratification, regardless of the Region's capacity tier; (B) if a Region has not achieved capacity for a domain by year seven, the ARB shall certify operational transfer and simultaneously implement enhanced monitoring and technical assistance under this section; (C) the seven-year outer limit is intended to prevent indefinite federal administration from substituting for Regional self-governance, even at the cost of reduced initial operational quality; (D) if the ARB certifies at the time of transfer under paragraph (B) that the Region cannot independently maintain courts, tax administration, or emergency services at a level sufficient to protect residents' constitutional rights, the ARB shall establish interim shared-services arrangements for those essential functions with adjacent Regions or the federal government until the Region achieves independent capacity or Congress enacts alternative measures under subsection (r). Shared-services costs shall be borne by the Region, with reimbursement available from the Capacity Development Program under subsection (f).

(e) **Transfer Flexibility.** The ARB may certify Tier 2 capacity for individual functional domains before the Region achieves overall Tier 2 certification. A Region may assume operational responsibility for domains in which it has demonstrated capacity while federal bridge administration continues for other domains.

#### Federal Capacity Development Program

(f) **Establishment.** The Federal Government shall establish a Regional Capacity Development Program, administered by the ARB through a Capacity Development Secretariat, to provide mandatory institutional development support to all Regions during the transition period.

(g) **Program Components.** The Program shall include:

(1) **Institutional Design Assistance.** Teams of experienced public administrators, drawn from federal agencies, State governments, and, with consent, other Regions, shall be available to assist Regions in designing governmental structures, including judiciary design, tax administration systems, regulatory agency organization, and emergency management frameworks;

(2) **Personnel Development.** The Program shall fund and coordinate: (A) training programs for Regional civil servants, judges, and administrators; (B) fellowships for Regional personnel to serve temporary rotations in federal agencies or high-capacity Regions; (C) recruitment assistance for Regions that lack a sufficient pool of qualified applicants for critical positions;

(3) **Systems and Infrastructure.** The Program shall provide: (A) information technology systems for tax administration, case management, regulatory enforcement, and inter-Regional data sharing; (B) physical infrastructure grants for courthouses, administrative offices, and emergency operations centers where existing State facilities are insufficient for Regional operations; (C) model templates for Regional administrative codes, court rules, and regulatory procedures; (D) common data standards and interoperability protocols ensuring that systems deployed under this subsection are compatible across all Regions and with federal systems, consistent with the data continuity requirements of Section 5 of this Article;

(4) **Fiscal Capacity Building.** The IFC shall provide: (A) technical assistance in tax system design, revenue forecasting, and budget development; (B) interim tax administration services where a Region cannot yet independently operate its own tax system; (C) capacity-building grants, distinct from equalization transfers under Article X, Section 3, to fund the development of fiscal infrastructure;

(5) **Judicial Capacity.** Recognizing that a functioning judiciary is essential to constitutional governance and presents particular capacity challenges, the Program shall include: (A) accelerated judicial training programs developed in coordination with existing federal judicial education institutions; (B) temporary judicial borrowing arrangements under which federal judges or judges from other Regions may sit by designation on a Region's courts when the Region's own judiciary lacks sufficient personnel to hear cases within constitutional deadlines; (C) shared judicial services for low-volume specialized proceedings, including but not limited to environmental courts, commercial arbitration, and water disputes, to be administered by inter-Regional agreement or by the ARB where no agreement is reached; (D) judicial borrowing under this subsection shall not exceed five (5) years for any individual Region without ARB certification that the Region is making demonstrable progress toward independent judicial capacity. Regardless of ARB certification, judicial borrowing shall not continue beyond seven (7) years from ratification except by express congressional authorization.

(h) **Priority Allocation.** The ARB shall allocate Program resources with priority to Regions furthest from Tier 2 certification. No Region shall be denied baseline Program access, but enhanced support shall be directed where institutional gaps are greatest.

(i) **Funding.** The Capacity Development Program shall be funded from general federal revenues. Program costs shall not be charged against equalization transfers, Cyclical Stabilization Fund disbursements, or any other Article X fiscal mechanism. Congress shall appropriate funds sufficient to operate the Program; if Congress fails to appropriate adequate funds within one (1) year of ratification, the IFC may direct the release of funds from the federal general account at a level not exceeding 0.1% of national GDP annually, subject to the Anti-Obstruction provisions of Section 2(b-5). The following additional protections shall apply:

(1) **Anti-Conditionality.** Federal appropriations for the Capacity Development Program shall not be conditioned on a Region's adoption or rejection of any substantive policy unrelated to institutional capacity development. Conditions that restrict program funds to capacity-building purposes, require reporting on fund usage, or impose performance benchmarks related to this section's tier framework are permissible. Disputes over whether a condition constitutes an impermissible policy condition under this paragraph shall be referred to the Allocation Review Board, which shall issue a determination within sixty (60) days. The ARB's determination shall be subject to judicial review;

(2) **Aggregate Cap on Default Draws.** IFC default releases under this subsection shall not exceed a cumulative total of 0.5% of national GDP over any consecutive five-year period. If this cap proves insufficient, the IFC shall report to Congress with recommended appropriation levels;

(3) **Fallback Termination.** The IFC's authority to direct default releases under this subsection terminates upon the sunset of the tiered capacity assessment framework under subsection (v).

(j) **Duration.** The Capacity Development Program shall operate for a minimum of ten (10) years following ratification or until all Regions achieve Tier 2 certification, whichever is later, but in no event beyond fifteen (15) years following ratification. Congress may extend the Program by statute. Upon termination, any ongoing technical assistance commitments shall be honored for the remainder of the applicable assistance period. If the tiered capacity assessment framework sunsets under subsection (v) before the Program's minimum duration expires, Program allocations for the remainder of its term shall be guided by the IFC annual certification findings under Article XXII, Section 6(b), with priority to Regions identified as having capacity deficiencies in any certified function.

#### Inter-Regional Technical Assistance

(k) **Voluntary Peer Assistance.** Regions that have achieved Tier 2 or Tier 3 certification may enter into voluntary technical assistance agreements with lower-tier Regions. Such agreements may include:

(1) secondment of experienced Regional personnel to assist with institutional development, subject to the following: (A) seconded personnel shall serve a minimum return-service period in the sending Region equal to the duration of the secondment, commencing upon the secondment's conclusion; (B) no Region shall simultaneously second more than five percent (5%) of its workforce in any single functional domain to other Regions; (C) the Capacity Development Secretariat shall track secondments to prevent aggregate personnel drain from any sending Region;

(2) shared-services arrangements for functions where independent Regional capacity is not yet feasible (e.g., forensic laboratory services, specialized court expertise, environmental monitoring);

(3) joint training programs and professional development exchanges.

(l) **Facilitation.** The ARB shall maintain a Technical Assistance Clearinghouse publishing: (1) offers of assistance from higher-tier Regions; (2) requests for assistance from lower-tier Regions; and (3) model shared-services agreements. The ARB may recommend inter-Regional technical assistance partnerships but may not compel them.

(m) **Cost Sharing.** The costs of voluntary peer technical assistance shall be shared as follows: (1) personnel costs of seconded employees shall be borne by the sending Region, with reimbursement available from the Capacity Development Program under subsection (f); (2) shared-services costs shall be allocated by agreement between the Regions; (3) the Capacity Development Program may subsidize up to fifty percent (50%) of shared-services costs during the first five (5) years of a shared-services agreement.

#### Early Warning and Remediation

(n) **Capacity Alert.** If the ARB determines during an annual assessment that a Region:

(1) has not achieved Tier 1 certification within two (2) years of ratification; or

(2) is not on track to achieve Tier 2 certification within seven (7) years of ratification, based on the rate of progress observed in consecutive assessments; or

(3) has regressed from a previously achieved tier;

the ARB shall issue a Capacity Alert for that Region.

(o) **Alert Consequences.** A Capacity Alert triggers:

(1) a detailed Capacity Remediation Assessment identifying the specific institutional deficiencies preventing tier advancement, published within sixty (60) days of the Alert;

(2) enhanced Capacity Development Program support, including dedicated assistance teams and priority resource allocation;

(3) quarterly progress reviews, published in summary form, replacing annual assessments for the duration of the Alert;

(4) mandatory consultation between the Region's Governor and legislature and the ARB to develop a Capacity Remediation Plan within one hundred twenty (120) days. The Remediation Plan shall be developed collaboratively — the ARB provides institutional expertise and benchmarks; the Region retains authority over the plan's specific design and implementation.

(p) **Remediation Plan.** A Capacity Remediation Plan shall:

(1) identify specific, measurable benchmarks for achieving the next tier;

(2) establish a timeline not exceeding three (3) years for achieving each benchmark;

(3) specify the federal and inter-Regional assistance the Region will receive;

(4) be published for public review and updated annually.

(q) **Mandatory Enhanced Intervention.** If any Region has not achieved Tier 2 certification by the sixth (6th) year following ratification:

(1) the Capacity Development Secretariat shall deploy a dedicated Institutional Development Team to that Region, consisting of specialists in each functional domain where capacity gaps remain;

(2) the IFC shall conduct an emergency fiscal capacity assessment and provide supplementary fiscal assistance as necessary;

(3) the ARB shall convene a Capacity Conference among the Region, the federal government, and willing peer Regions to identify and address remaining barriers;

(4) this mandatory intervention supplements, and does not replace, any Capacity Alert or Remediation Plan in effect.

(r) **Escalation.** If a Region under Capacity Alert fails to achieve Tier 1 within four (4) years of ratification, or Tier 2 within ten (10) years of ratification:

(1) the ARB shall assess whether the failure constitutes or is approaching Political Institutional Failure under Article V, Section 5;

(2) if the ARB determines the Region is approaching but has not reached Political Institutional Failure, it shall recommend to Congress targeted legislative interventions, which may include extended federal bridge administration under Section 6(c) as modified by subsection (d)(5), mandatory shared-services arrangements with adjacent Regions, or additional fiscal support;

(3) the ARB may not itself impose governance changes on the Region. Interventions beyond enhanced technical assistance require Congressional action or, in the event of Political Institutional Failure, the receivership procedures of Article V, Section 5;

(4) no Region may be placed in Political Institutional Failure receivership under Article V, Section 5 solely because it has not achieved Tier 2 capacity. Political Institutional Failure requires the specific conditions enumerated in Article V, Section 5(a).

#### Anti-Stigma Protections

(s) **Objective Assessment Standard.** Capacity assessments shall be based exclusively on objective, quantified criteria published in advance. The ARB shall not:

(1) issue subjective assessments of Regional "culture," "attitude," or "willingness" to develop capacity;

(2) compare Regions to one another in assessment publications. Each Region's assessment shall be published as an independent document evaluating that Region against the uniform criteria. Nothing in this subsection prevents fact-based reporting by media organizations, academic researchers, or legislative bodies, which may include inter-Regional comparisons in the exercise of public accountability;

(3) characterize any Region as "failing," "deficient," "backward," or similar pejorative terms. Assessments shall use descriptive tier designations only.

(t) **Narrative Responsibility.** During the first five (5) years following ratification:

(1) the ARB and all federal agencies shall, in official communications regarding Regional capacity, emphasize the expected and planned nature of differential development timelines;

(2) the President and federal officials shall not use capacity tier designations as grounds for questioning a Region's constitutional authority, legitimacy, or standing to participate in inter-Regional governance;

(3) nothing in this subsection restricts the speech of individual officials in their personal capacity, legislative debate, or media commentary.

(u) **Equal Standing.** Regardless of capacity tier, every Region retains:

(1) full constitutional authority within its enumerated powers;

(2) equal representation in the Senate under Article IV, Section 3;

(3) equal standing to participate in ARB proceedings, IFC consultations, and inter-Regional compacts;

(4) the right to challenge federal actions and to petition the Supreme Court;

(5) authority over its own Regional constitution and governance structure.

#### Sunset and Transition

(v) **Sunset.** The tiered capacity assessment framework established by this section shall sunset upon the earliest of:

(1) the date on which all Regions have achieved Tier 3 certification; or

(2) fifteen (15) years following ratification, regardless of whether all Regions have achieved Tier 3.

Upon sunset, all Regions shall be assessed exclusively under the annual IFC certification required by Article XXII, Section 6(b). If any Region has not achieved Tier 3 at sunset, the IFC shall provide enhanced monitoring for that Region, including annual assessments against Tier 2 and Tier 3 criteria, for a period of five (5) years following sunset or until the Region achieves Tier 3, whichever is earlier.

(w) **Post-Sunset Monitoring.** After sunset, if the IFC determines during an annual certification that any Region has fallen below minimum institutional capacity as defined in Article XXII, Section 6(b):

(1) the IFC shall notify the ARB, which may reinstate enhanced assessment procedures on a Region-specific basis;

(2) reinstatement shall not trigger automatic application of the full tiered framework, but the ARB may recommend capacity-building interventions to Congress;

(3) Political Institutional Failure procedures under Article V, Section 5 remain available as the ultimate backstop.

### Section 8. Transition-Period Boundary Adaptability

*Resolves Gap 12 — Constitutional Transition Vulnerability. This section prevents initial boundary decisions from creating irreversible path dependency during the transition period by requiring boundary-adaptive statutory design and limiting boundary-dependent commitments.*

#### Boundary-Adaptive Statutory Design

(a) **Boundary-Adaptive Statutory Design.** Each implementation act required by Section 1 shall include automatic adjustment mechanisms ensuring that:

(1) equalization formulas, allocation criteria, and funding mechanisms reference "the Regions as constituted at the time of application" rather than specific Regional compositions established in Schedule A of Article I;

(2) institutional structures can accommodate boundary changes without requiring new legislation — where a boundary change alters Regional membership, the implementation act's provisions shall apply to the reconstituted Regions without interruption;

(3) data collection, reporting, and certification systems are designed to operate at the State level as well as the Regional level, permitting recalculation upon boundary revision;

(4) no implementation act may define eligibility for equalization transfers, fiscal allocations, or institutional representation by reference to specific States within a specific Region, except as necessary for transition-period calculations under Section 7;

(5) the Independent Fiscal Council shall review each implementation act's boundary adaptability within one (1) year of enactment and publish an assessment of whether the act's formulas and parameters would produce materially different outcomes under plausible alternative boundary configurations. If the IFC identifies material boundary dependency, it shall recommend specific amendments to Congress;

(6) compliance with this subsection shall not constitute grounds for extending the congressional enactment deadlines established in Section 1 and Section 2. The boundary-adaptive design requirement may be satisfied by formulas that reference Regional composition dynamically and does not require Congress to anticipate or model specific boundary changes;

(7) federal agencies administering Transitional Regional Law under Section 6(c) shall organize their bridge administration at the State level, not the Regional level, to the maximum extent practicable, ensuring that administrative reorganization following boundary revision does not require restructuring federal bridge operations.

#### Fiscal Succession Protocol

(b) **Fiscal Succession Protocol.** For financial obligations of Regions, including bonds, pension commitments, and contractual liabilities, each implementation act shall establish a fiscal succession protocol specifying how obligations are apportioned between reconstituted Regions following a boundary revision.

#### Anti-Lock-In for Inter-Regional Agreements

(c) **Anti-Lock-In for Inter-Regional Agreements.** During the first ten (10) years following ratification:

(1) inter-Regional agreements under Article I, Section 5 that exceed ten (10) years in duration shall include a boundary-revision adjustment clause specifying how the agreement adapts if a participating Region's boundaries change;

(2) an inter-Regional agreement that lacks such a clause is voidable upon boundary revision by any affected Region;

(3) this requirement does not apply to agreements of ten (10) years or shorter duration, or to agreements exclusively between States within a single Region.

#### Institutional Investment Notice

(d) **Institutional Investment Notice.** During the first ten (10) years following ratification, any Regional capital investment exceeding the greater of one percent (1%) of the Region's annual budget or fifty million dollars ($50,000,000) adjusted for inflation that is location-dependent and would be materially affected by boundary revision shall be accompanied by a published Boundary Sensitivity Assessment:

(1) prepared by the Region and filed with the ARB;

(2) identifying how the investment would be affected if the Region's boundaries changed under Article I, Section 4;

(3) specifying any adaptation measures the Region has planned.

This requirement is informational only — it does not restrict Regional investment decisions, but ensures that boundary-dependent commitments are made with awareness and transparency. The ARB shall not rank, compare, or aggregate Boundary Sensitivity Assessments across Regions. No federal official shall characterize a Region's investment decisions as evidence of boundary instability.

#### Capacity Investment Safe Harbor

(e) **Capacity Investment Safe Harbor.** Institutional investments made pursuant to the Capacity Development Program under Section 7 shall not be characterized as path dependency effects for purposes of the accelerated review under Article I, Section 4-A(b-1)(5). Where boundary revision would affect capacity investments, the Commission shall identify transition mechanisms for preserving the value of such investments (including transfer of facilities to successor Regions, shared-services agreements, and inter-Regional facility sharing) rather than treating investments as barriers to revision or as reasons to avoid revision. No Region shall be disadvantaged in capacity assessment under Section 7 for making investments that would be affected by potential boundary revision, provided such investments are consistent with the Region's capacity development objectives.

#### Capacity Tier Adjustment for Boundary Changes

(f) **Capacity Tier Adjustment for Boundary Changes.**

(1) If a State transfer under Article I, Section 4(f)-(r) or Section 4-A(b-2), or a boundary revision under Article I, Section 4 and Section 4-A, results in a Region falling below a previously achieved capacity tier, the ARB shall: (A) recalculate capacity baselines for the reconstituted Region; (B) provide a grace period of not less than one (1) year before applying tier regression consequences under Section 7(n); (C) make supplementary Capacity Development Program resources available to the affected Region.

(2) If boundary revision under Article I, Section 4-A(b-1) takes effect during the Capacity Development Program's operational period under Section 7(j), the Program's duration for affected Regions shall be extended by the lesser of three (3) years or the time remaining until all affected Regions achieve Tier 2 certification.

#### Savings Clause

(g) **Savings Clause.** Nothing in this section:

(1) restricts the constitutional authority of Regions to make investment, policy, or institutional decisions within their enumerated powers;

(2) creates a private right of action based on failure to comply with this section, except that any Region, State, or the ARB may petition for a declaratory judgment regarding compliance;

(3) extends beyond the first ten (10) years following ratification, except for subsection (a), which applies permanently to implementation acts, and subsection (b), which applies whenever boundary revision occurs;

(4) diminishes the protections established in Section 2-A (Implementation Act Integrity). A challenge to an implementation act's compliance with subsection (a) shall not result in invalidation of any provision of the act. The sole remedy for non-compliance with subsection (a) shall be a declaratory judgment requiring Congress to amend the non-compliant provision within two (2) years, during which the existing provision remains in full force;

(5) an amendment to an implementation act that modifies a boundary-adaptive provision required by subsection (a) shall not be deemed "material weakening" under Section 2-A(e) if the amendment substitutes an alternative boundary-adaptive mechanism that satisfies the requirements of subsection (a).
