# Implementation and Definitions

## Articles XXI-XXII: Default Rules, Definitions, and Commentary

*This document contains the implementation and definition provisions of the Regional Federal Constitution, plus the official non-binding commentary.*

---

## ARTICLE XXI - IMPLEMENTATION AND DEFAULT RULES

### Section 1. Congressional Implementation Duty

Congress shall enact enabling legislation to implement this Constitution, including but not limited to:

- an Allocation Framework Act defining jurisdictional boundaries and spillover criteria,
- a Fiscal Equalization Act establishing transfer formulas and the Independent Fiscal Council,
- an Elections Implementation Act specifying procedures for federal elections under Regional administration.

---

### Section 2. Default Rules Upon Congressional Failure

(a) If Congress fails to enact the Allocation Framework Act within two years of ratification, the allocation of powers shall be governed by existing federal-state divisions, with Regions exercising authority over matters previously requiring interstate compacts.

(b) If Congress fails to enact the Fiscal Equalization Act within three years of ratification, equalization transfers shall be calculated as flat per-capita grants at a baseline level equal to five percent of federal revenues, distributed to Regions with below-median fiscal capacity. This default rate shall decline by one percentage point per year beginning in year six, reaching a floor of two percent, to incentivize congressional action rather than reward inaction.

(c) If Congress fails to enact the Elections Implementation Act within two years of ratification, the following default rules apply:

- The national popular vote requirement of Article VII, Section 2 remains in full force.
- Administrative procedures (voter registration, ballot design, counting methods) shall follow prior federal law as adapted for Regional administration.
- Regions assume the administrative role previously held by States.
- Any provisions of prior federal law inconsistent with the national popular vote requirement (including the Electoral College) are superseded and inapplicable.
- If no candidate receives a majority of votes cast, a runoff election between the two candidates receiving the most votes shall be held within twenty-one days. If Congress has enacted a different majority mechanism (such as ranked-choice voting or instant runoff), that mechanism supersedes this default.

(d) If Congress fails to enact appropriations for any fiscal year by the start of that fiscal year, the following automatic fiscal continuation shall apply:

- Spending shall continue at the prior fiscal year's enacted levels for all previously authorized programs.
- Prior-year levels shall be adjusted by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or by a successor index designated by statute.
- No new programs, expansions of existing programs, or new spending initiatives may be funded under automatic continuation.
- Automatic continuation terminates upon enactment of appropriations for the affected fiscal year.

(e) Default rules remain in effect until Congress enacts superseding legislation.

---

### Section 3. Purpose

These default rules exist to prevent deliberate nonimplementation from becoming a method of constitutional sabotage. The Constitution shall operate even if Congress fails to act.

## OFFICIAL COMMENTARY (NON-BINDING)

### Purpose

This Constitution is designed not for consensus, but for survival.

It assumes:

- polarization,
- bad faith,
- institutional stress,
- and periodic crisis.

It rejects:

- exit politics,
- domination through centralization,
- governance by emergency,
- judicial policymaking,
- and militarized politics.

---

### Core Design Philosophy

1. **Distribute power**
2. **Lower existential stakes**
3. **Preserve real self-government**
4. **Make abuse slow, visible, and reversible**
5. **Prefer restoration over punishment**

---

### Interpretive Directive

Where ambiguity exists, interpreters shall prefer:

- decentralization over concentration,
- process enforcement over outcome imposition,
- restoration over escalation,
- democratic legitimacy over efficiency.

---

### Final Statement

This Constitution does not promise harmony.

It promises something more realistic:

> **That disagreement will not destroy the Republic.**
