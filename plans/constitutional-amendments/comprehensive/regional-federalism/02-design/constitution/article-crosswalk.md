## Architecture Rationale

### Why Modular?

1. **Independent adoptability**: Each standalone amendment can be adopted without requiring the full RF restructuring
2. **Reduced political barrier**: Reforms can proceed incrementally
3. **One-way dependencies**: RF can rely on standalone amendments; standalone amendments do NOT rely on RF
4. **Clear boundaries**: Region-dependent provisions are clearly separated from general reforms

### How to Determine Location

**In RF Core if:**
- Creates or depends on Regional institutions
- Establishes Region/State/Federal power allocation
- Requires multi-tier governance to function

**In Standalone if:**
- Works equally well with States or Regions
- Does not create Regional institutions
- Can be adopted independently

**Needs RF Supplement if:**
- Standalone amendment exists
- Region-dependent provisions would enhance it
- RF adoption would change how it operates
