# Article Crosswalk: Regional Federalism Constitution

## Purpose

This document provides a canonical mapping of all constitutional article numbers to their locations. The Regional Federalism plan uses a **modular architecture** where some articles are part of the core RF Constitution and others are standalone amendments that can be adopted independently.

**Use this document to find the correct citation and file location for any article reference.**

| Article | Topic | Location | RF Supplement? |
|---------|-------|----------|----------------|
| **VII** | Elections | [single-topic/election-reform/](../../../../single-topic/election-reform/) | No—works same with States or Regions |
| **VIII** | Impeachment | [single-topic/impeachment-reform/](../../../../single-topic/impeachment-reform/) | No |
| **IX** | Lobbying/Anti-Corruption | [single-topic/lobbying-reform/](../../../../single-topic/lobbying-reform/) | No |

### RF Supplement Articles

## Architecture Rationale

### Why Modular?

1. **Independent adoptability**: Each standalone amendment can be adopted without requiring the full RF restructuring
2. **Reduced political barrier**: Reforms can proceed incrementally
3. **One-way dependencies**: RF can rely on standalone amendments; standalone amendments do NOT rely on RF
4. **Clear boundaries**: Region-dependent provisions are clearly separated from general reforms

### How to Determine Location

**In RF Core if:**
- Creates or depends on Regional institutions
- Establishes Region/State/Federal power allocation
- Requires multi-tier governance to function

**In Standalone if:**
- Works equally well with States or Regions
- Does not create Regional institutions
- Can be adopted independently

**Needs RF Supplement if:**
- Standalone amendment exists
- Region-dependent provisions would enhance it
- RF adoption would change how it operates
