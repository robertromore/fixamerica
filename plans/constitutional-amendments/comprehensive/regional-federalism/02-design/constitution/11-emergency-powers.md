# Regional Emergency Authority

## Regional Federalism Supplement to Emergency Powers Reform

*This document contains ONLY the region-dependent provisions for emergency powers under Regional Federalism. For the complete emergency powers reform, see the [Emergency Powers Reform Amendment](../single-topic/emergency-powers-reform.md).*

---

## Compatibility Clause

This article presumes adoption of the [Emergency Powers Reform Amendment](../single-topic/emergency-powers-reform.md) or an equivalent provision establishing:

- categorized emergency powers (natural disaster, public health, economic, security, constitutional crisis)
- enumerated powers by category
- time limits and reauthorization requirements
- judicial review standards
- restoration mandate
- habeas corpus protections
- prohibition on emergency expansion of power
- constitutional crisis definition

The Emergency Powers Reform Amendment works with either the existing federal/state system or with Regional Federalism. This supplement adds Regional Governor declaration authority that only makes sense with the regional structure.

## ARTICLE XVII-RF - REGIONAL EMERGENCY AUTHORITY

### Section 1. Regional Governor Declaration Authority

(a) Regional Governors may declare emergencies for matters within Regional constitutional authority.

(b) Regional emergency declarations are subject to the same requirements as federal declarations under the Emergency Powers Reform Amendment:

- written declaration specifying nature, geographic scope, powers to be exercised, duration, and termination conditions,
- authentication in accordance with Article II, Section 23 (Authenticity of Official Acts),
- publication and transmission to Regional legislature within twenty-four hours,
- category-specific powers only,
- time limits and reauthorization requirements.

(c) Regional emergencies may not exceed the jurisdiction of the declaring Region. Multi-Regional emergencies require either:

- coordinated declarations by affected Regional Governors, or
- federal declaration by the President.

---

### Section 2. Regional Legislature Reauthorization

(a) Regional emergencies may be extended by majority vote of the Regional legislature for thirty-day periods, up to the maximum duration specified in the Emergency Powers Reform Amendment.

(b) After reaching maximum duration, a Regional emergency may only be renewed by:

- a two-thirds vote of the Regional legislature, and
- approval by the Regional Supreme Court.

(c) Any Regional emergency not reauthorized before expiration terminates automatically. All Regional emergency powers cease immediately.

#### Anti-Ratcheting and Cooling-Off Requirements

(e) **Prohibition on Sequential Category Switching.** No Governor may declare an emergency under a different category within thirty days of the termination or expiration of a prior emergency if:

- (1) the new declaration addresses substantially the same underlying conditions as the prior emergency;
- (2) the primary purpose of the new declaration is to obtain powers unavailable under the prior category; or
- (3) the cumulative duration of sequential emergency declarations addressing the same conditions would exceed the maximum renewal limits established for the original category.

(f) **Cooling-Off Period.** Following termination of any Regional emergency that reached its maximum renewal limit under subsection (d), no new emergency of the same category addressing substantially similar conditions may be declared for a period of one hundred eighty days, unless:

- (1) a genuinely new triggering event occurs that is independent of the prior emergency conditions; and
- (2) the Regional Assembly certifies by two-thirds vote that the new declaration is not an attempt to circumvent renewal limits.

(g) **Cumulative Duration Tracking.** The Regional Arbiter shall maintain a public registry of all emergency declarations, their categories, stated justifications, and cumulative durations. Any pattern of declarations that cumulatively exceeds twice the single-emergency maximum duration for a category within any five-year period shall trigger mandatory review by the Regional Assembly, which must affirmatively vote to permit any further declarations of that category.

(h) **Judicial Review of Successive Declarations.** Any resident of the Region may challenge a successive emergency declaration as violating this section. Courts shall apply strict scrutiny, requiring the Governor to demonstrate that the new declaration addresses genuinely distinct conditions and is not designed to evade the limitations of this Article.

---

### Section 3. Coordination with Federal Emergency Powers

(a) Federal emergencies supersede conflicting Regional emergencies within the geographic scope of the federal declaration.

(b) Regional Governors may request federal emergency assistance. Such requests do not require Regional emergency declaration.

(c) Regional Guard Forces may be deployed under Regional emergency authority without federal approval, subject to the limitations in Article XI-RF.

---

### Section 4. Regional Bio-Security Cooperation

*Resolves Gap 206 — The "Petri Dish" (Bio-Security Anarchy). Supplements the Bio-Security Emergency Escalation provisions in Article XVII, Section 11 with Regional-specific cooperation requirements and enforcement mechanisms.*

(a) **Regional Governor Cooperation Duty.** During a Bio-Security Emergency declared under Article XVII, Section 11:

- (1) Regional Governors shall implement federally mandated communicable disease response measures within their Regions without delay;
- (2) Regional Governors shall designate a Regional Public Health Liaison to coordinate with the federal emergency response authority;
- (3) Regional Governors may not invoke Regional concurrent authority over public health to refuse, delay, or undermine federally mandated bio-security measures.

(b) **Regional Data Infrastructure.** Each Region shall maintain public health surveillance and reporting systems capable of:

- (1) real-time transmission of epidemiological data to federal authorities as required by Article XVII, Section 11(c);
- (2) standardized case reporting compatible with federal data systems;
- (3) genomic sequencing capacity or access through interstate compact;
- (4) interoperability with neighboring Regions' public health surveillance systems.

Failure to maintain such capacity does not excuse non-compliance with data-sharing mandates.

(c) **Regional Guard for Bio-Security — Last Resort.** Regional Guard Forces may be deployed to support bio-security enforcement within a Region only:

- (1) after civilian enforcement measures under Article XVII, Section 11(d)(1)-(4) have been exhausted or are demonstrably insufficient;
- (2) pursuant to Two-Key authorization under Article XI-RF, Section 2, with the Emergency Response Acceleration provisions of Section 2(h) applicable;
- (3) under the operational direction of civilian public health authorities, not military command;
- (4) for logistical support, facility security, and distribution operations — not for enforcement of public health orders against individual civilians.

(d) **Federal Supersession.** During a Bio-Security Emergency, Article XVII, Section 11(b) supersedes Regional concurrent authority over communicable disease response. Section 3(a) of this article (federal emergencies supersede conflicting Regional emergencies) applies with full force to Bio-Security Emergencies.

(e) **Post-Emergency Restoration.** Upon termination of a Bio-Security Emergency:

- (1) Regional concurrent authority over public health is fully restored;
- (2) any federal measures imposed under Article XVII, Section 11 that Regions wish to continue may be adopted as Regional law through normal legislative process;
- (3) the Allocation Review Board shall publish a post-emergency assessment of each Region's compliance, data-sharing performance, and public health outcomes within one hundred eighty (180) days.

## Design Rationale

### Why Regional Emergency Authority?

The multi-tier structure ensures:

- Emergencies can be addressed at the appropriate level
- Federal emergency powers are not required for Regional crises
- Regional Governors can coordinate multi-State responses within their Region
- Checks and balances apply at all levels

Without Regional emergency authority, Regions would depend entirely on federal declarations or individual State declarations, creating:

- Slower response times
- Coordination gaps for multi-State emergencies within a Region
- Unnecessary federal involvement in Regional matters

### Why Regional Legislature Reauthorization?

Regional legislatures provide democratic accountability for Regional emergency measures:

- Elected representatives must approve extensions
- Two-thirds supermajority required after maximum duration
- Regional Supreme Court review for extended emergencies
- Automatic termination prevents indefinite Regional emergencies

### Relationship to Emergency Powers Reform Amendment

The core reforms (categories, powers, time limits, judicial review, restoration mandate, habeas corpus protections) are in the standalone [Emergency Powers Reform Amendment](../single-topic/emergency-powers-reform.md). That amendment:

- Works with the existing federal/state system
- Does not require Regional Federalism
- Establishes the emergency powers accountability framework

This Regional Emergency Authority article adds:

- Regional Governor declaration authority
- Regional legislature reauthorization
- Coordination rules between Regional and federal emergencies
- Regional bio-security cooperation requirements (Section 4)
