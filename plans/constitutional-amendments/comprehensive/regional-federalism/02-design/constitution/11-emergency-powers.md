# Regional Emergency Authority

## Regional Federalism Supplement to Emergency Powers Reform

*This document contains ONLY the region-dependent provisions for emergency powers under Regional Federalism. For the complete emergency powers reform, see the [Emergency Powers Reform Amendment](../single-topic/emergency-powers-reform.md).*

---

## Compatibility Clause

This article presumes adoption of the [Emergency Powers Reform Amendment](../single-topic/emergency-powers-reform.md) or an equivalent provision establishing:

- categorized emergency powers (natural disaster, public health, economic, security, constitutional crisis)
- enumerated powers by category
- time limits and reauthorization requirements
- judicial review standards
- restoration mandate
- habeas corpus protections
- prohibition on emergency expansion of power
- constitutional crisis definition

The Emergency Powers Reform Amendment works with either the existing federal/state system or with Regional Federalism. This supplement adds Regional Governor declaration authority that only makes sense with the regional structure.

---

## ARTICLE XVII-RF - REGIONAL EMERGENCY AUTHORITY

### Section 1. Regional Governor Declaration Authority

(a) Regional Governors may declare emergencies for matters within Regional constitutional authority.

(b) Regional emergency declarations are subject to the same requirements as federal declarations under the Emergency Powers Reform Amendment:

- written declaration specifying nature, geographic scope, powers to be exercised, duration, and termination conditions,
- authentication in accordance with Article II, Section 23 (Authenticity of Official Acts),
- publication and transmission to Regional legislature within twenty-four hours,
- category-specific powers only,
- time limits and reauthorization requirements.

(c) Regional emergencies may not exceed the jurisdiction of the declaring Region. Multi-Regional emergencies require either:

- coordinated declarations by affected Regional Governors, or
- federal declaration by the President.

---

### Section 2. Regional Legislature Reauthorization

(a) Regional emergencies may be extended by majority vote of the Regional legislature for thirty-day periods, up to the maximum duration specified in the Emergency Powers Reform Amendment.

(b) After reaching maximum duration, a Regional emergency may only be renewed by:

- a two-thirds vote of the Regional legislature, and
- approval by the Regional Supreme Court.

(c) Any Regional emergency not reauthorized before expiration terminates automatically. All Regional emergency powers cease immediately.

#### Anti-Ratcheting and Cooling-Off Requirements

(e) **Prohibition on Sequential Category Switching.** No Governor may declare an emergency under a different category within thirty days of the termination or expiration of a prior emergency if:

- (1) the new declaration addresses substantially the same underlying conditions as the prior emergency;
- (2) the primary purpose of the new declaration is to obtain powers unavailable under the prior category; or
- (3) the cumulative duration of sequential emergency declarations addressing the same conditions would exceed the maximum renewal limits established for the original category.

(f) **Cooling-Off Period.** Following termination of any Regional emergency that reached its maximum renewal limit under subsection (d), no new emergency of the same category addressing substantially similar conditions may be declared for a period of one hundred eighty days, unless:

- (1) a genuinely new triggering event occurs that is independent of the prior emergency conditions; and
- (2) the Regional Assembly certifies by two-thirds vote that the new declaration is not an attempt to circumvent renewal limits.

(g) **Cumulative Duration Tracking.** The Regional Arbiter shall maintain a public registry of all emergency declarations, their categories, stated justifications, and cumulative durations. Any pattern of declarations that cumulatively exceeds twice the single-emergency maximum duration for a category within any five-year period shall trigger mandatory review by the Regional Assembly, which must affirmatively vote to permit any further declarations of that category.

(h) **Judicial Review of Successive Declarations.** Any resident of the Region may challenge a successive emergency declaration as violating this section. Courts shall apply strict scrutiny, requiring the Governor to demonstrate that the new declaration addresses genuinely distinct conditions and is not designed to evade the limitations of this Article.

---

### Section 3. Coordination with Federal Emergency Powers

(a) Federal emergencies supersede conflicting Regional emergencies within the geographic scope of the federal declaration.

(b) Regional Governors may request federal emergency assistance. Such requests do not require Regional emergency declaration.

(c) Regional Guard Forces may be deployed under Regional emergency authority without federal approval, subject to the limitations in Article XI-RF.

---

### Section 4. Regional Bio-Security Cooperation

*Resolves Gap 206 — The "Petri Dish" (Bio-Security Anarchy). Supplements the Bio-Security Emergency Escalation provisions in Article XVII, Section 11 with Regional-specific cooperation requirements and enforcement mechanisms.*

(a) **Regional Governor Cooperation Duty.** During a Bio-Security Emergency declared under Article XVII, Section 11:

- (1) Regional Governors shall implement federally mandated communicable disease response measures within their Regions without delay;
- (2) Regional Governors shall designate a Regional Public Health Liaison to coordinate with the federal emergency response authority;
- (3) Regional Governors may not invoke Regional concurrent authority over public health to refuse, delay, or undermine federally mandated bio-security measures.

(b) **Regional Data Infrastructure.** Each Region shall maintain public health surveillance and reporting systems capable of:

- (1) real-time transmission of epidemiological data to federal authorities as required by Article XVII, Section 11(c);
- (2) standardized case reporting compatible with federal data systems;
- (3) genomic sequencing capacity or access through interstate compact;
- (4) interoperability with neighboring Regions' public health surveillance systems.

Failure to maintain such capacity does not excuse non-compliance with data-sharing mandates.

(c) **Regional Guard for Bio-Security — Last Resort.** Regional Guard Forces may be deployed to support bio-security enforcement within a Region only:

- (1) after civilian enforcement measures under Article XVII, Section 11(d)(1)-(4) have been exhausted or are demonstrably insufficient;
- (2) pursuant to Two-Key authorization under Article XI-RF, Section 2, with the Emergency Response Acceleration provisions of Section 2(h) applicable;
- (3) under the operational direction of civilian public health authorities, not military command;
- (4) for logistical support, facility security, and distribution operations — not for enforcement of public health orders against individual civilians.

(d) **Federal Supersession.** During a Bio-Security Emergency, Article XVII, Section 11(b) supersedes Regional concurrent authority over communicable disease response. Section 3(a) of this article (federal emergencies supersede conflicting Regional emergencies) applies with full force to Bio-Security Emergencies.

(e) **Post-Emergency Restoration.** Upon termination of a Bio-Security Emergency:

- (1) Regional concurrent authority over public health is fully restored;
- (2) any federal measures imposed under Article XVII, Section 11 that Regions wish to continue may be adopted as Regional law through normal legislative process;
- (3) the Allocation Review Board shall publish a post-emergency assessment of each Region's compliance, data-sharing performance, and public health outcomes within one hundred eighty (180) days.

### Section 5. Catastrophic Displacement and Resettlement

*Resolves Gap 215 — The "Internal Refugee" (Climate Displacement). Supplements Natural Disaster emergency powers in Article XVII with displacement-specific coordination authority when catastrophic events render territory uninhabitable and overwhelm normal migration mechanisms under Article I, Section 8(f)-(o).*

(a) **Declaration of Displacement Emergency.** The President may declare a "Displacement Emergency" when a natural disaster, climate event, or environmental catastrophe renders significant territory uninhabitable and displaces citizens beyond the capacity of standard migration mechanisms under Article I, Section 8(f)-(o):

- (1) Declaration requires certification by the Independent Fiscal Council that:
    - (A) displacement exceeds three percent (3%) of the origin Region's population; or
    - (B) the affected territory is projected uninhabitable for ten (10) or more years based on scientific assessment;
- (2) Congress shall concur within thirty (30) days. If Congress neither concurs nor rejects within thirty (30) days, the declaration continues in effect but the President must re-certify every ninety (90) days until Congressional action;
- (3) the declaration supersedes and supplements Migration Surge Stabilization mechanisms under Article I, Section 8(f)-(o), which continue to operate concurrently.

(b) **Federal Coordination Authority.** During a declared Displacement Emergency, the Federal Government shall have authority to:

- (1) coordinate resettlement through voluntary incentive programs, including housing vouchers, employment assistance, and relocation grants targeted to Regions with verified absorption capacity;
- (2) preempt Regional zoning, land use, or residency restrictions that impede the immediate housing of displaced citizens, limited to emergency shelter and transitional housing;
- (3) prohibit any Region from closing its borders, denying services, or declaring emergency powers to limit absorption of displaced citizens;
- (4) determine Regional absorption capacity through independent federal audit; a Region may not deny displaced citizens absent IFC-certified capacity exhaustion.

No displaced citizen shall be compelled to relocate to a specific Region. Allocation shall operate through incentive structures that distribute displaced populations according to verified capacity, not through mandatory assignment.

(c) **Fiscal Indemnification.** The Federal Government shall guarantee fiscal neutrality for receiving Regions:

- (1) the IFC shall determine the direct marginal costs of housing and servicing displaced citizens, and the Federal Government shall reimburse one hundred percent (100%) of verified costs;
- (2) federal funds shall cover infrastructure expansion required by displacement;
- (3) reimbursement shall be offset against equalization transfers under Article X, Section 3 to prevent double-counting;
- (4) the origin Region shall contribute to resettlement costs based on pre-disaster fiscal capacity; origin Regions that failed to invest in climate adaptation, as assessed by the IFC, shall bear a higher contribution share.

(d) **Rights of the Displaced.** Citizens displaced under a declared Displacement Emergency:

- (1) shall register to vote in the receiving Region immediately upon arrival; registration waiting periods are waived for displaced citizens;
- (2) may not vote in both the origin and receiving Region; the one-person-one-vote principle applies absolutely;
- (3) shall have professional licenses and credentials recognized in any receiving Region for five (5) years under Article I, Section 9, without supplementary requirements;
- (4) shall receive portable federal benefits that adhere to the citizen, not the jurisdiction;
- (5) may not be classified as "transients" or "temporary residents" for purposes of benefits, services, or legal protections.

(e) **Right to Return.** If territory previously declared uninhabitable becomes habitable:

- (1) displaced citizens shall have priority right to return for twenty (20) years from the date of displacement;
- (2) the custodial authority over the territory shall facilitate return, restore services, and provide reintegration assistance;
- (3) the right to return does not obligate return; displaced citizens who have established residence elsewhere retain all rights in their receiving Region.

(f) **Origin Region Obligations.** The Region from which citizens are displaced:

- (1) remains responsible for pension and benefit obligations until formally transferred to the Federal Government or a successor entity;
- (2) shall facilitate transfer of records, credentials, and documentation to receiving Regions;
- (3) may not impose exit requirements, fees, or penalties on displaced citizens;
- (4) shall contribute to resettlement costs based on pre-disaster fiscal capacity as determined by the IFC.

(g) **Dissolution of Origin Region.** If the IFC certifies that an origin Region is permanently uninhabitable or has lost more than fifty percent (50%) of its population to displacement:

- (1) Congress may place the Region into Federal Trusteeship by majority vote of both chambers;
- (2) the territory becomes Federal Territory; Regional debts are assumed by the Union;
- (3) remaining political structures are dissolved or merged with neighboring Regions by act of Congress, subject to Article I, Section 2 boundary procedures;
- (4) assets of the dissolved Region are managed by a federal custodial authority for the benefit of displaced citizens and creditors;
- (5) Congressional representation is adjusted pursuant to Article I, Section 2.

(h) **Termination and Review.**

- (1) A Displacement Emergency terminates when the IFC certifies that resettlement is stabilized and displaced citizens are integrated into receiving communities;
- (2) the IFC shall conduct annual reviews of displacement status, Regional absorption capacity, fiscal neutrality, and integration progress;
- (3) federal coordination authority under subsection (b) expires five (5) years from declaration absent Congressional renewal;
- (4) all emergency powers under this section expire immediately upon termination of the Displacement Emergency.

(i) **Climate Displacement Reserve.** Congress shall establish and maintain a reserve fund sufficient to meet anticipated displacement costs:

- (1) the fund shall be sized based on actuarial and scientific projections of climate displacement risk, updated annually;
- (2) upon declaration of a Displacement Emergency, funds shall be available for expenditure without further appropriation, subject to IFC oversight;
- (3) the IFC shall publish annual reports on fund adequacy and displacement risk projections.

### Section 6. Census Immunity and Enumeration Protection

*Resolves Gap 126 — "Census Emergency" and Boundary Sabotage. Establishes constitutional immunity for federal census operations from emergency power abuse, authorizes alternative enumeration when obstruction occurs, creates an enforcement framework with ARB investigation and burden-shifting, and protects the decennial boundary revision timeline from data manipulation.*

(a) **Definitions.** For purposes of this Section:

- (1) "Census period" means the constitutionally mandated decennial enumeration period, beginning on the date designated by the Director of the Census Bureau and continuing until the Director certifies completion, plus any extension authorized by Congress;
- (2) "Census operations" means all activities conducted by or on behalf of the Census Bureau for purposes of enumeration, including door-to-door canvassing, mail collection, electronic data gathering, administrative records analysis, statistical estimation, and quality verification;
- (3) "Census obstruction" means any act or omission by a governmental entity — federal, Regional, or State — that delays, prevents, undermines, or materially impedes census operations, including but not limited to:
    - (A) emergency declarations that restrict census worker movement, access, or operations;
    - (B) denial or unreasonable delay of access to public facilities, records, or infrastructure needed for enumeration;
    - (C) data system shutdowns, transmission failures, or interoperability refusals not attributable to natural causes or genuine technical failure;
    - (D) threats, intimidation, or harassment of census personnel by governmental agents or with governmental acquiescence;
    - (E) imposition of licensing, credentialing, background check, or security requirements on census workers beyond those imposed by the Census Bureau itself;
- (4) "Census response rate" means the percentage of housing units within a Region from which the Census Bureau has obtained a completed enumeration response — whether by self-response, field enumeration, or administrative records verification — as certified by the Director of the Census Bureau; the Director shall publish the methodology for calculating response rates no later than one (1) year before each decennial census.

(b) **Census Immunity from Emergency Powers.**

- (1) No emergency declaration — federal, Regional, or State — may be used to delay, obstruct, or modify federal census operations within the declaring jurisdiction;
- (2) census workers shall have constitutional immunity from emergency restrictions imposed by any level of government during the census period; no governmental entity may detain, exclude, redirect, or impose conditions upon census workers engaged in lawful enumeration activities;
- (3) the Census Bureau may conduct enumeration using any lawful method notwithstanding any emergency order, declaration, or restriction;
- (4) governmental data systems that serve census operations shall remain operational during the census period; Regional and State governments shall maintain data transmission capacity to the Census Bureau and shall designate backup transmission methods in advance of each census period; a genuine cyber incident affecting census data systems — verified by a Census Bureau information security officer — shall not constitute census obstruction under subsection (a)(3)(C) provided the affected government activates designated backup transmission methods within twenty-four (24) hours; failure to activate backup methods within this period creates a rebuttable presumption of census obstruction;
- (5) the immunity established by this subsection applies regardless of whether the underlying emergency declaration is legitimate; a genuine emergency does not authorize census obstruction as an incidental consequence;
- (6) notwithstanding the foregoing, a federal official designated by the Director of the Census Bureau may temporarily restrict census operations within a specific geographic area when there is an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of census workers that cannot be mitigated by security measures:
    - (A) the restriction shall be limited to the specific area of imminent threat and shall not exceed seventy-two (72) hours; a single renewal of seventy-two (72) hours may be authorized if the threat persists;
    - (B) the Census Bureau shall be notified immediately and shall adjust enumeration schedules to compensate for any lost time;
    - (C) only federal officials may invoke this provision; Regional, State, and local officials may request federal invocation but may not independently restrict census operations on safety grounds;
    - (D) the Director shall conduct a post-action review within thirty (30) days; if the restriction was not justified by a genuine imminent threat, the restricting official's action constitutes census obstruction under subsection (a)(3);
    - (E) if an imminent threat to life or physical safety persists beyond one hundred forty-four (144) hours (two full renewal cycles), the designated federal official may petition the NCC for an extended restriction; the NCC shall rule within forty-eight (48) hours; extensions under this clause may not exceed thirty (30) days each and are renewable only upon fresh NCC approval; the Census Bureau shall conduct alternative enumeration under subsection (c) in any area subject to an NCC-approved extended restriction.

(c) **Alternative Enumeration Authority.**

- (1) if a Region's census response rate falls below eighty percent (80%) of the national average response rate, the Census Bureau may employ administrative records, statistical sampling, and other scientifically validated methods to complete enumeration;
- (2) alternative enumeration conducted under this subsection is valid for all constitutional purposes, including boundary revision under Article I, Section 4 and apportionment;
- (3) a Region in which census obstruction has been found under subsection (e) may not challenge the methodology of alternative enumeration employed in response to that obstruction; this prohibition takes effect upon final determination — either expiration of the sixty-day NCC appeal period without appeal, or NCC affirmance of the obstruction finding under subsection (e)(6);
- (4) the Director of the Census Bureau shall select alternative enumeration methods that maximize accuracy; the Director may not deliberately employ inferior methods to disadvantage any Region.

(d) **Enumeration Timeline Integrity.**

- (1) the constitutional census timeline shall not be extended due to Regional or State non-cooperation; boundary revisions under Article I, Section 4 proceed on schedule using the best data available at the constitutionally required deadline;
- (2) Regions that achieve census response rates at or above ninety percent (90%) of the national average receive a presumption of data accuracy in any boundary dispute under Article I, Section 4;
- (3) Regions with census response rates below eighty percent (80%) of the national average bear the burden of proving the accuracy of any population claims that diverge from Census Bureau estimates.

(e) **Obstruction Finding and Enforcement.**

- (1) the Allocation Review Board shall investigate potential census obstruction upon:
    - (A) referral by the Director of the Census Bureau;
    - (B) petition by any affected Tribal Nation, State, or Region;
    - (C) its own initiative when a Region's census response rate falls below seventy percent (70%) of the national average as measured at a checkpoint date set by the Director of the Census Bureau, which shall be no earlier than sixty (60) days before the Director's scheduled certification of completion;
- (2) the ARB shall complete its investigation and issue a written determination within ninety (90) days of initiation; if the investigated government fully cooperated with the investigation and the ARB fails to issue a determination within this period, a rebuttable presumption arises that no obstruction occurred; if the investigated government failed to produce records, respond to inquiries, or otherwise cooperate with the investigation, the ARB may extend the investigation by up to sixty (60) additional days, and the government's non-cooperation creates a rebuttable presumption that obstruction occurred; if the ARB fails to issue a determination within the extended period, subsection (e)(4)(A) and (B) apply automatically — boundary revision proceeds using Census Bureau data and the investigated government bears the burden of proving any data adjustment would be inappropriate;
- (3) the standard of proof for an obstruction finding is preponderance of the evidence; the ARB may draw adverse inferences from a Region's failure to produce records or cooperate with investigation;
- (4) upon a finding of census obstruction:
    - (A) boundary revision under Article I, Section 4 shall proceed using the best available data as determined by the Census Bureau;
    - (B) the obstructing government bears the burden of proving that any data adjustment would be inappropriate;
    - (C) the obstruction finding triggers automatic review of the obstructing government's emergency declaration authority by the Regional Assembly for Regional-level obstruction, or by the State legislature for State-level obstruction;
    - (D) officials who knowingly directed or authorized census obstruction may be referred by the ARB or Attorney General for federal criminal prosecution; the ARB shall refer cases involving willful obstruction to the Attorney General for consideration;
- (5) a pattern of obstruction — defined as two or more obstruction findings within twenty (20) years — results in mandatory suspension of the obstructing government's authority to restrict census operations for the next two census cycles; during suspension, the Census Bureau operates within the jurisdiction without requiring governmental facilitation;
- (6) obstruction findings may be appealed to the NCC within sixty (60) days; NCC review is limited to whether the ARB applied the correct legal standard and whether the finding is supported by substantial evidence; the NCC may not substitute its judgment for the ARB's factual determinations.

(f) **Census Bureau Accountability.**

- (1) the Census Bureau shall apply uniform enumeration standards and methods across all Regions; variation in methodology is permitted only when justified by genuine geographic, demographic, or logistical differences, not by political considerations;
- (2) the Government Accountability Office shall audit Census Bureau operations in each decennial census and report to Congress on methodological uniformity, accuracy, and any evidence of political bias;
- (3) census workers and Census Bureau employees shall have whistleblower protections; no federal, Regional, or State official may retaliate against a census worker who reports obstruction, political interference, or methodological irregularities;
- (4) any Region may petition the ARB if it believes Census Bureau methods are being applied non-uniformly; the ARB shall investigate and, if it finds non-uniform application, may order corrective measures.

(g) **Coordination with Other Provisions.**

- (1) this Section supplements but does not replace the anti-ratcheting provisions of Section 2(e)-(h); an emergency declaration that constitutes census obstruction under this Section is independently reviewable regardless of whether it also violates Section 2;
- (2) federal emergencies declared by the President are subject to census immunity under subsection (b)(1); Section 3(a) (federal emergencies supersede conflicting Regional emergencies) does not authorize the President to supersede census operations;
- (3) the Boundary Review Commission established under Article I, Section 4 may request ARB investigation of census obstruction as part of any boundary revision proceeding;
- (4) Tribal Nations conducting their own census or enumeration pursuant to federal law are not subject to this Section; this Section governs only governmental obstruction of federal census operations;
- (5) the Director of the Census Bureau shall publish the decennial census operational schedule, including all key dates, at least two (2) years before census day; any deviation of more than sixty (60) days from the published schedule requires written justification to Congress, published in the Federal Register, and is subject to GAO review under subsection (f)(2).

## Design Rationale

### Why Regional Emergency Authority?

The multi-tier structure ensures:

- Emergencies can be addressed at the appropriate level
- Federal emergency powers are not required for Regional crises
- Regional Governors can coordinate multi-State responses within their Region
- Checks and balances apply at all levels

Without Regional emergency authority, Regions would depend entirely on federal declarations or individual State declarations, creating:

- Slower response times
- Coordination gaps for multi-State emergencies within a Region
- Unnecessary federal involvement in Regional matters

### Why Regional Legislature Reauthorization?

Regional legislatures provide democratic accountability for Regional emergency measures:

- Elected representatives must approve extensions
- Two-thirds supermajority required after maximum duration
- Regional Supreme Court review for extended emergencies
- Automatic termination prevents indefinite Regional emergencies

### Relationship to Emergency Powers Reform Amendment

The core reforms (categories, powers, time limits, judicial review, restoration mandate, habeas corpus protections) are in the standalone [Emergency Powers Reform Amendment](../single-topic/emergency-powers-reform.md). That amendment:

- Works with the existing federal/state system
- Does not require Regional Federalism
- Establishes the emergency powers accountability framework

This Regional Emergency Authority article adds:

- Regional Governor declaration authority
- Regional legislature reauthorization
- Coordination rules between Regional and federal emergencies
- Regional bio-security cooperation requirements (Section 4)
- Census immunity and enumeration protection (Section 6)
