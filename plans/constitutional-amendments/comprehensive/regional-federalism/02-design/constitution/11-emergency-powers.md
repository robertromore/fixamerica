# Regional Emergency Authority

## Regional Federalism Supplement to Emergency Powers Reform

*This document contains ONLY the region-dependent provisions for emergency powers under Regional Federalism. For the complete emergency powers reform, see the [Emergency Powers Reform Amendment](../../../../single-topic/emergency-powers-reform/).*

---

## Compatibility Clause

This article presumes adoption of the [Emergency Powers Reform Amendment](../../../../single-topic/emergency-powers-reform/) or an equivalent provision establishing:

- categorized emergency powers (natural disaster, public health, economic, security, constitutional crisis)
- enumerated powers by category
- time limits and reauthorization requirements
- judicial review standards
- restoration mandate
- habeas corpus protections
- prohibition on emergency expansion of power
- constitutional crisis definition

The Emergency Powers Reform Amendment works with either the existing federal/state system or with Regional Federalism. This supplement adds Regional Governor declaration authority that only makes sense with the regional structure.

## ARTICLE XVII-RF - REGIONAL EMERGENCY AUTHORITY

### Section 1. Regional Governor Declaration Authority

(a) Regional Governors may declare emergencies for matters within Regional constitutional authority.

(b) Regional emergency declarations are subject to the same requirements as federal declarations under the Emergency Powers Reform Amendment:

- written declaration specifying nature, geographic scope, powers to be exercised, duration, and termination conditions,
- publication and transmission to Regional legislature within twenty-four hours,
- category-specific powers only,
- time limits and reauthorization requirements.

(c) Regional emergencies may not exceed the jurisdiction of the declaring Region. Multi-Regional emergencies require either:

- coordinated declarations by affected Regional Governors, or
- federal declaration by the President.

---

### Section 2. Regional Legislature Reauthorization

(a) Regional emergencies may be extended by majority vote of the Regional legislature for thirty-day periods, up to the maximum duration specified in the Emergency Powers Reform Amendment.

(b) After reaching maximum duration, a Regional emergency may only be renewed by:

- a two-thirds vote of the Regional legislature, and
- approval by the Regional Supreme Court.

(c) Any Regional emergency not reauthorized before expiration terminates automatically. All Regional emergency powers cease immediately.

---

### Section 3. Coordination with Federal Emergency Powers

(a) Federal emergencies supersede conflicting Regional emergencies within the geographic scope of the federal declaration.

(b) Regional Governors may request federal emergency assistance. Such requests do not require Regional emergency declaration.

(c) Regional Guard Forces may be deployed under Regional emergency authority without federal approval, subject to the limitations in Article XV-RF.

## Design Rationale

### Why Regional Emergency Authority?

The multi-tier structure ensures:

- Emergencies can be addressed at the appropriate level
- Federal emergency powers are not required for Regional crises
- Regional Governors can coordinate multi-State responses within their Region
- Checks and balances apply at all levels

Without Regional emergency authority, Regions would depend entirely on federal declarations or individual State declarations, creating:

- Slower response times
- Coordination gaps for multi-State emergencies within a Region
- Unnecessary federal involvement in Regional matters

### Why Regional Legislature Reauthorization?

Regional legislatures provide democratic accountability for Regional emergency measures:

- Elected representatives must approve extensions
- Two-thirds supermajority required after maximum duration
- Regional Supreme Court review for extended emergencies
- Automatic termination prevents indefinite Regional emergencies

### Relationship to Emergency Powers Reform Amendment

The core reforms (categories, powers, time limits, judicial review, restoration mandate, habeas corpus protections) are in the standalone [Emergency Powers Reform Amendment](../../../../single-topic/emergency-powers-reform/). That amendment:

- Works with the existing federal/state system
- Does not require Regional Federalism
- Establishes the emergency powers accountability framework

This Regional Emergency Authority article adds:

- Regional Governor declaration authority
- Regional legislature reauthorization
- Coordination rules between Regional and federal emergencies
