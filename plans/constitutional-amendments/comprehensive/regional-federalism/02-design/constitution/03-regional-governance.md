## Articles IV-VI: Legislative Branch, Executive Branch, and Foreign Affairs (Regional-Specific Provisions)

*This document contains the regional-specific governance provisions of the Regional Federal Constitution. For standalone federal governance reforms, see the companion plans:*

- *[Congressional Reform](../single-topic/congressional-reform.md) - Generic federal legislative reforms*
- *[Executive Reform](../single-topic/executive-reform.md) - Generic federal executive reforms*

## ARTICLE IV - THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH

### Section 1. Congress

Congress shall remain bicameral, consisting of a House of Representatives and a Senate.

---

### Section 2. The House of Representatives

The House shall be elected by the People according to population and shall initiate national legislation within enumerated federal powers.

---

### Section 3. The Senate

(a) The Senate shall represent the Regions equally.

(b) Each Region shall be represented by three Senators, elected at-large within the Region by ranked-choice voting for staggered six-year terms.

(c) The total membership of the Senate shall be three times the number of Regions, plus any at-large members serving under subsection (d).

(d) Each Region shall select Senators according to Regional law, provided such law provides for direct popular election.

(e) **Transitional Exception.** Senators representing the District of Columbia and United States territories prior to Regional assignment serve as at-large members pursuant to Article XX, Sections 1(b) and 2(b). At-large Senators have full voting rights for five (5) years following ratification; thereafter, voting rights are subject to the Integration Timeline provisions of Article XX, Section 4. Upon Regional assignment, the Integration Bonus provisions of Article XX, Section 4 apply, and such Senators join the assigned Region's delegation.

---

### Section 4. Senate Powers

The Senate's powers are limited to:

- ratification of treaties,
- confirmation of judicial and constitutional officers,
- participation in constitutional amendments,
- adjudication of intergovernmental disputes.

The Senate shall not function as a routine legislative veto.

**Adjudication Procedures.** When adjudicating intergovernmental disputes:

- (a) The Senate shall establish standing rules for dispute adjudication, including discovery procedures, hearing requirements, and decision standards.
- (b) Disputes must be resolved within 180 days of filing unless all parties consent to extension.
- (c) Senate adjudication is limited to disputes between Regions, or between Regions and the federal government, regarding interpretation of this Constitution or federal law.
- (d) The Senate may not adjudicate disputes involving individual rights (which belong to the courts) or disputes already pending in the Allocation Review Board or federal courts.
- (e) Senate adjudication decisions may be appealed to the Supreme Court on questions of constitutional interpretation within 60 days.

**Conflict of Interest Provisions.** To ensure impartial adjudication:

- (f) **Mandatory Recusal.** Senators from any Region that is a party to a dispute shall be recused from voting on the adjudication. If both parties are Regions, Senators from both Regions are recused.
- (f-1) **Party Definition and Material Interest.**
    - (1) **"Party" Defined.** For purposes of mandatory recusal under subsection (f), "party" includes: (a) any Region formally named in the dispute; (b) any Region that has filed an appearance or amicus submission; and (c) any Region determined by the presiding officer to be a "beneficial party" under paragraph (2).
    - (2) **Beneficial Party Standard.** A Region is a "beneficial party" if it: (a) is providing more than incidental funding, legal assistance, or strategic direction to a named party; (b) has entered into any agreement with a named party concerning the conduct or outcome of the dispute; or (c) would receive more than incidental direct benefit from the relief sought, as distinguished from precedential effect.
    - (3) **Material Interest Recusal.** Independent of party status, a Senator shall be recused if the dispute's outcome would directly and substantially affect that Senator's Region's: (a) fiscal obligations or entitlements exceeding 0.5% of Regional annual budget; (b) territorial boundaries or jurisdiction; or (c) constitutional authority as distinguished from policy preferences.
    - (4) **Party Limitation.** No dispute may name more than four Regions as parties. If additional Regions have material interests, they may participate as amici but their Senators are not automatically recused unless they meet the beneficial party or material interest standards above.
- (g) **Quorum with Recusals.** When Senators are recused under subsection (f):
    - (1) The quorum for adjudication shall be a majority of non-recused Senators;
    - (2) Decisions require a majority of non-recused Senators voting;
    - (3) If recusals reduce participating Senators below eight, the presiding officer shall first convene a Special Senate Panel under subsection (g-1). Transfer to the Supreme Court occurs only if a Special Senate Panel cannot be constituted.
- (g-1) **Special Senate Panel.** When recusals reduce participating Senators below eight:
    - (1) The Chief Justice shall convene a Special Senate Panel consisting of six former Senators selected by lot from those who left office within the preceding twelve years and who did not represent any party Region;
    - (2) The Panel shall have the same authority as the full Senate for the specific dispute;
    - (3) Panel decisions are appealable to the Supreme Court on the same terms as full Senate decisions;
    - (4) If fewer than six eligible former Senators are available, the Panel may proceed with a minimum of four members;
    - (5) If a Special Senate Panel cannot be constituted, the dispute transfers to the Supreme Court for original jurisdiction.
    - (6) **Eligibility Requirements.** To be eligible for selection to the Special Senate Panel under this subsection, a former Senator must have:
        - (a) completed at least one full six-year term by election, or served at least four cumulative years if appointed to fill a vacancy;
        - (b) departed office without having been removed by expulsion, impeachment, or recall;
        - (c) not resigned while subject to formally adopted charges by the Senate Ethics Committee or a pending criminal indictment relating to official conduct;
        - (d) not been censured by the Senate for conduct relating to integrity, honesty, or fitness for office, as distinguished from policy disagreements;
        - (e) Disqualification under paragraph (c) terminates if the charges or indictment are subsequently dismissed or resolved without adverse finding;
        - (f) A former Senator who resigned to accept another federal, Regional, or State office is not disqualified under paragraph (c) solely by reason of that resignation.
    - (7) **Transition.** During the first twelve years following ratification of this Constitution, former members of the United States Senate who meet the criteria of paragraph (6)(a) through (d) shall be eligible for selection under this subsection, subject to the same party-Region exclusion of paragraph (1).
- (g-2) **Anti-Engineering Provisions.**
    - (1) **Frivolous Party Addition.** If recusals would reduce participating Senators below eight, the presiding officer shall review whether any party was added primarily to force recusals rather than because of genuine legal necessity. Parties added without substantial justification shall be dismissed for recusal calculation purposes.
    - (2) **Transfer Quota.** No more than three disputes per calendar year may be transferred to the Supreme Court or Special Senate Panel under subsection (g)(3) at the initiation of the same party or coordinated parties. Additional disputes shall be held in abeyance pending resolution of transferred matters.
- (g-3) **Tertiary Fallback for Exhausted Forums.**
    - (1) **Trigger.** If a dispute transferred to the Supreme Court under subsection (g-1)(5) cannot be heard because Supreme Court recusals prevent a quorum, the Chief Justice shall certify the dispute to a Circuit Resolution Panel.
    - (2) **Panel Composition.**
        - (a) The Circuit Resolution Panel shall consist of the chief judges of five circuits, selected by lot from circuits whose territorial jurisdiction does not substantially overlap with any party Region. If fewer than five circuits are eligible, retired chief judges from ineligible circuits may be added by lot.
        - (b) **Judicial Eligibility.** To be eligible for selection to the Circuit Resolution Panel, a chief judge or retired chief judge must have: (i) served at least ten years in an Article III judicial capacity; (ii) not resigned or retired while subject to formally adopted charges of judicial misconduct; and (iii) not been removed from office for cause. Disqualification under clause (ii) terminates if the charges are subsequently dismissed or resolved without adverse finding.
        - (c) **Transition.** During the first twelve years following ratification of this Constitution, chief judges and retired chief judges of the United States Courts of Appeals who meet the criteria of paragraph (b) shall be eligible.
    - (3) **Authority.** The Circuit Resolution Panel shall have original jurisdiction over the certified dispute with the same authority as the Supreme Court. Its decision is final and not subject to further appeal.
    - (4) **Absolute Fallback.** If a Circuit Resolution Panel cannot be constituted, the dispute shall be resolved by binding arbitration before a panel of three arbitrators: one selected by each party and one selected by the American Arbitration Association from its roster of former federal judges. The arbitration award shall have the force of a Supreme Court judgment.
- (h) **Anti-Bloc Voting Safeguards.**
    - (1) No adjudication may proceed if Senators from three or fewer Regions would constitute a majority of voting Senators;
    - (2) If the same Regional coalition decides three consecutive disputes against the same Region or group of Regions, and those disputes involved claims with aggregate value exceeding 500,000 Federal Penalty Units or involving a question of Certified Constitutional Impression, any affected Region may demand transfer to the Supreme Court. Disputes voluntarily conceded, dismissed for procedural defect, or resolved by settlement shall not count toward the pattern threshold;
    - (3) The Chief Justice shall review Senate adjudication patterns annually and may certify "systematic regional bias" if statistical analysis demonstrates non-random voting patterns correlated with Regional identity rather than legal merit. Such certification triggers automatic Supreme Court review of pending and future disputes for two years.
- (i) **Independent Adjudication Panel Option.** For disputes involving allegations of Regional discrimination or systematic bias:
    - (1) Any party may request adjudication by an Independent Panel instead of the full Senate;
    - (2) The Panel shall consist of the Chief Justice (presiding), two retired federal appellate judges meeting the eligibility criteria of subsection (g-3)(2)(b) selected by lot, and two Senators selected by lot from non-party Regions;
    - (3) Panel decisions have the same force as Senate adjudication and are appealable under the same terms.
- (i-1) **Randomization Protocol for Panel Selection.**
    - (1) **Selection Authority.** Senator selection by lot under subsection (i)(2) and former Senator selection under subsection (g-1)(1) shall be conducted by the Clerk of the Supreme Court, not by any Senate officer.
    - (2) **Procedure.** The Clerk shall: (a) publicly announce the pool of eligible Senators or former Senators after applying the eligibility requirements of subsection (g-1)(6) and, for judicial panels, subsection (g-3)(2)(b); (b) use a cryptographically verifiable random selection algorithm, with the seed derived from a publicly observable source announced at least 24 hours in advance; (c) conduct the selection in a recorded public proceeding; and (d) publish the algorithm, seed, and selection results within one hour.
    - (3) **Challenge.** Any party may challenge the selection within 48 hours by demonstrating procedural irregularity. The Chief Justice shall rule on challenges within 72 hours. A successful challenge requires new selection; it does not permit party-directed selection.
- (j) **Anti-Strategic Filing.** To prevent deliberate overload of adjudication systems:
    - (1) No party may have more than three disputes pending before the Senate or Supreme Court simultaneously;
    - (2) Disputes that are substantially similar or arise from coordinated filing strategies may be consolidated;
    - (3) The Chief Justice may impose filing restrictions on parties who demonstrate a pattern of filing disputes primarily to create procedural burden;
    - (4) If Supreme Court transfer requests exceed the Court's capacity, the Court may designate a Special Master panel of retired federal judges to hear overflow cases with the same binding authority;
    - (5) Filing fees, set by the Judicial Conference and waivable for hardship, shall apply to deter frivolous or strategic filings.
- (j-1) **Coalition Filing Limits.**
    - (1) **Coordination Presumption.** Disputes filed by different Regions within 60 days that: (a) name the same opposing party or parties; (b) raise substantially similar legal theories; or (c) seek relief that would be cumulative or reinforcing—are presumed to be coordinated filings subject to consolidated limits.
    - (2) **Coalition Limit.** Regions whose filings are determined to be coordinated shall collectively be limited to five pending disputes, allocated among the coordinating Regions as they agree or, absent agreement, as the presiding officer directs.
    - (3) **Rebuttal.** The presumption of coordination may be rebutted by demonstrating that the filings arose from genuinely independent grievances without communication or agreement among the filing Regions.

**Senate Adjudicative Ethics Code.** When exercising quasi-judicial functions:

- (k) **Applicability.** When the Senate or any Senator exercises adjudicative functions under this Article, including dispute resolution, treaty interpretation, and constitutional interpretation, the following ethics rules shall apply with the same force as judicial conduct rules apply to federal judges.

- (l) **Ex Parte Communication Prohibition.** During the pendency of any adjudicative matter:
    - (1) no Senator participating in the adjudication may communicate about the substance of the matter with any party, party representative, or interested person outside of official proceedings;
    - (2) all substantive communications must be on the record and with notice to all parties;
    - (3) inadvertent ex parte contacts must be immediately disclosed and made part of the record;
    - (4) violations shall result in mandatory recusal of the affected Senator and, for willful violations, referral to the Senate Ethics Committee.

- (m) **Gift and Hospitality Restrictions.** From the time a matter is filed until final disposition:
    - (1) no Senator participating in the adjudication may accept gifts, hospitality, travel, or other things of value from any party or interested person exceeding $50 in aggregate value;
    - (2) no Senator may accept speaking fees, honoraria, or consulting compensation from entities with interests in pending matters;
    - (3) this prohibition extends to gifts to immediate family members and staff;
    - (4) pre-existing relationships requiring ongoing financial transactions (such as book royalties from a publisher that is a party) must be disclosed but need not be terminated.

- (n) **Campaign Contribution Restrictions.** During the pendency of adjudicative matters:
    - (1) no Senator may solicit or accept campaign contributions from any party to the adjudication, their officers, directors, or registered lobbyists;
    - (2) contributions received before the matter was filed need not be returned but must be disclosed;
    - (3) contributions received in violation of this subsection must be returned within 30 days or donated to the U.S. Treasury;
    - (4) Senators who receive contributions exceeding $10,000 in aggregate from parties to a matter within the two years preceding filing shall disclose such contributions and may be subject to recusal motions.

- (o) **Independent Expenditure Disclosure.** If a Senator becomes aware that independent expenditures exceeding $100,000 have been made supporting or opposing their candidacy by a party to a pending adjudication or their affiliates:
    - (1) the Senator shall immediately disclose this information to all parties and the presiding officer;
    - (2) any party may move for recusal based on appearance of impropriety;
    - (3) the motion shall be decided by the non-conflicted Senators, with ties resolved in favor of recusal.

- (p) **Adjudicative Impartiality Standard.** Senators exercising adjudicative functions shall:
    - (1) decide matters based solely on the record, applicable law, and constitutional principles;
    - (2) avoid public statements prejudging matters before them;
    - (3) disqualify themselves when their impartiality might reasonably be questioned;
    - (4) not allow political, partisan, or Regional loyalty considerations to influence their adjudicative judgment.

- (q) **Ethics Enforcement.** The Senate Ethics Committee shall:
    - (1) promulgate detailed rules implementing this section within one year of ratification;
    - (2) receive and investigate complaints of adjudicative ethics violations;
    - (3) impose sanctions ranging from private reprimand to public censure to exclusion from adjudicative functions;
    - (4) refer willful or repeated violations to the Department of Justice for potential criminal prosecution under applicable federal ethics statutes.

- (r) **Party Remedies.** A party to an adjudication who demonstrates that ethics violations materially affected the outcome may:
    - (1) move for reconsideration by a panel excluding the violating Senator(s);
    - (2) appeal directly to the Supreme Court for de novo review;
    - (3) seek civil damages from Senators who engaged in willful violations, with qualified immunity waived for adjudicative ethics violations.

**Senate Adjudicative Tie-Break.** To prevent procedural deadlock during the Senate's judicial functions:

- (s) **Presiding Officer.** The Chief Justice of the United States shall preside over the Senate when it sits as an adjudicative body for inter-Regional or constitutional disputes. The Chief Justice shall:
    - (1) maintain order and enforce procedural rules;
    - (2) rule on evidentiary and procedural motions;
    - (3) ensure compliance with the Senate Adjudicative Ethics Code.

- (t) **Casting Vote.** The Chief Justice shall remain non-voting during deliberations but shall cast a single vote to break an absolute tie among the non-recused Senators:
    - (1) a "tie" exists when the votes for and against a disposition are exactly equal;
    - (2) the Chief Justice may not cast a vote unless a tie exists;
    - (3) the Chief Justice shall explain the reasoning for the casting vote in writing.

- (u) **Limited Precedent for Tie-Broken Decisions.** A decision reached by the Chief Justice's casting vote shall be:
    - (1) subject to mandatory, expedited review by the Supreme Court within sixty (60) days;
    - (2) stayed pending Supreme Court review if any party so requests;
    - (3) not binding as precedent on future Senate adjudications until affirmed by the Supreme Court;
    - (4) this provision ensures that narrowly decided matters receive full judicial scrutiny and carry the weight of a clear legal majority.

### Section 4-A. Senate Concurrence for Constitutional Safeguards (Proposed)

> **Note:** This section is a proposed optional enhancement. See the [Senate Safeguard Concurrence Amendment](../../proposals/01-foundations/senate-safeguard-concurrence-act.md) for full text and analysis.

Senate concurrence by majority vote may be required for legislation affecting constitutional safeguards, including emergency powers, domestic armed force deployment, election administration, judicial structure, de-escalation procedures, and allocation of powers.

If adopted, this section would create targeted Senate involvement in safeguard legislation while preserving House majority rule for ordinary policy.

---

### Section 4-B. Mandatory Confirmation Procedures

*Addresses Gap 222: The Confirmation Blockade ("The Empty Chair Crisis"). Establishes mandatory deadlines and default confirmation to prevent strategic vacancy creation through Senate inaction.*

(a) **Scope and Definitions.**

- (i) This section applies to all nominations requiring Senate confirmation under this Constitution, including judicial officers, constitutional officers, and principal officers of executive departments whose confirmation is required by this Constitution or by law.
- (ii) "Officers requiring Senate confirmation" includes heads of executive departments, deputies and assistants whose appointment requires Senate confirmation by law, members of constitutional bodies established by this Constitution (including the Allocation Review Board and Independent Fiscal Commission), and such other officers as Congress may by law require to be confirmed.
- (iii) Where another provision of this Constitution establishes a specific confirmation timeline or procedure for a particular office, that provision controls to the extent it imposes a shorter deadline or alternative mechanism. This section provides the default where no specific provision applies.

(b) **Mandatory Vote Requirement.** Upon public transmission of a presidential nomination to the Senate:

- (i) The Senate shall complete a confirmation vote within ninety (90) calendar days;
- (ii) If the Senate fails to hold a vote within ninety (90) calendar days, the nominee shall be deemed confirmed by operation of law;
- (iii) The Senate may vote to reject any nominee, but silence shall constitute consent;
- (iv) Confirmation shall be by majority of Senators present and voting. No procedural rule, including rules requiring supermajority cloture, may prevent a confirmation vote from occurring or raise the threshold for confirmation above simple majority.

(c) **Procedure Protections.** During the confirmation period:

- (i) The nominee shall be entitled to at least one public hearing before the relevant committee;
- (ii) If the relevant committee has not concluded hearings within sixty (60) calendar days of public transmission, hearings shall be deemed concluded by operation of law;
- (iii) The full Senate shall hold a floor vote within thirty (30) days of committee action or the deemed-conclusion deadline under subsection (c)(ii), whichever is earlier;
- (iv) Upon expiration of the ninety-day confirmation period, the confirmation vote shall be the first order of business on the next day the Senate is in session. No procedural motion may delay, table, or block the vote.

(d) **Clock Start and Tolling.**

- (i) The confirmation clock begins on the date of public transmission of the nomination to the Senate, as timestamped by the official transmission record;
- (ii) The confirmation period shall be tolled only if the nominee fails to respond to written questions submitted by the relevant committee within fourteen (14) calendar days of receipt. The tolling period equals the number of days of non-response beyond the fourteen-day deadline;
- (iii) No other event — including Senate recess, quorum failure, or scheduling conflict — shall toll the confirmation clock;
- (iv) Written questions eligible to toll the clock must be submitted within thirty (30) calendar days of public transmission. Questions submitted after this deadline do not trigger tolling.

(e) **Deemed Confirmation Effect.** A nominee deemed confirmed by operation of law under this section:

- (i) Holds office with the same authority, tenure, and legal status as any officer confirmed by Senate vote;
- (ii) May exercise all powers and duties of the office from the date of deemed confirmation;
- (iii) Serves until resignation, removal for cause, impeachment, expiration of term, or removal under subsection (f).

(f) **Removal Safety Valve.** Following deemed confirmation under this section or any other provision of this Constitution:

- (i) The Senate may vote to remove the deemed-confirmed officer within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days of the deemed confirmation date;
- (ii) Removal under this subsection requires a two-thirds vote of Senators present and voting;
- (iii) Removal under this subsection is not an impeachment and does not require House action;
- (iv) An officer removed under this subsection may be re-nominated.

(g) **Recess Appointments.**

- (i) The President may make temporary appointments during genuine recesses of the Senate exceeding thirty (30) consecutive calendar days;
- (ii) Recess appointments expire at the end of the next Senate session or upon Senate action on a nomination for the same position, whichever comes first;
- (iii) Pro forma sessions in which no substantive business is transacted and which are held for the purpose of preventing recess appointments shall not constitute a session for purposes of this subsection.

(h) **Anti-Gaming Provisions.**

- (i) **No Clock Reset by Withdrawal.** If the President withdraws a nomination and re-nominates the same or a different person for the same position within one hundred eighty (180) calendar days, the original confirmation clock continues from the date of the initial public transmission. The clock resets only if the position is filled and subsequently vacated, or if more than one hundred eighty (180) days have elapsed since withdrawal;
- (ii) **Incomplete Submissions.** If a nomination is transmitted without the documentation required by law or Senate rules, the confirmation clock begins thirty (30) calendar days after the initial transmission or upon completion of documentation, whichever is earlier;
- (iii) **Hearing Conclusion.** Committee hearings are deemed concluded upon: (A) a recorded committee vote to report or not report the nomination; (B) the expiration of the sixty-day committee deadline under subsection (c)(ii); or (C) a majority vote of the committee to conclude hearings.

(i) **Coordination with Acting Official Limitations.** The provisions of this section complement, and shall be construed in coordination with, the limitations on acting officials established in Section 4-C of this Article.

(j) **Implementing Legislation.** Congress shall enact legislation providing:

- (i) Procedures for public transmission and timestamping of nominations;
- (ii) Standards for documentation required with nominations;
- (iii) Transition provisions for nominations pending at the time of ratification.

---

### Section 4-C. Acting Official Limitations

*Addresses Gap 168: The Acting Official Loophole (Bypassing Confirmation). Establishes time limits, succession mechanisms, and anti-circumvention measures for officials serving in acting, interim, or temporary capacity. Fulfills the cross-reference in Section 4-B(i).*

(a) **Scope and Definitions.**

- (1) This section applies to any person exercising the powers of a constitutional office in an acting, interim, temporary, or designated capacity without having been confirmed by the Senate for that office, or without having been elected to that office, as applicable.
- (2) "Constitutional powers" means any power whose exercise is required by or authorized by a specific provision of this Constitution, including but not limited to: command of Regional Guard forces (Article XI-RF, Section 2(d)); declaration of emergency (Article XVII-RF, Section 1); certification of equalization formulas (Article X, Section 5); resolution of power-allocation disputes (Article II, Section 7); and appointment of officers requiring confirmation.
- (3) "Vacancy" means the date on which the office became vacant by reason of death, resignation, removal, expiration of term, incapacity, or any other cause.

(b) **Time Limits on Acting Officials.**

- (1) No person may exercise constitutional powers in an acting capacity for more than one hundred twenty (120) calendar days from the date of the vacancy, except as provided in subsection (j).
- (2) **Tolling During Active Confirmation.** If a nomination for the vacant office has been transmitted to the Senate under Section 4-B, the one hundred twenty-day period shall be tolled for the duration of active confirmation proceedings. Tolling terminates upon: (a) Senate confirmation or rejection of the nominee; (b) withdrawal of the nomination; (c) expiration of the Section 4-B confirmation period without action; or (d) the nominee's failure to respond to committee questions beyond the tolling period established in Section 4-B(d)(ii).
- (3) **Mandatory Disclosure.** All exercises of constitutional power by acting officials shall be publicly reported within twenty-four (24) hours in the Federal Register or equivalent official publication. Failure to report does not invalidate the action but constitutes a separate violation of this section.

(c) **Mandatory Nomination.**

- (1) The appointing authority shall transmit a nomination for the vacant office to the confirming body within sixty (60) calendar days of the vacancy.
- (2) If no nomination has been transmitted within sixty (60) days, the acting official's authority to exercise constitutional powers shall be automatically suspended upon the expiration of the one hundred twenty-day period under subsection (b)(1), without tolling.
- (3) Upon transmission of a nomination, the confirmation procedures of Section 4-B apply, including the ninety-day mandatory vote and deemed confirmation provisions.

(d) **Succession and Fallback.**

Upon expiration of the acting period under subsection (b) without a confirmed officer in place:

- (1) **Succession.** The constitutional powers of the vacant office shall be exercised by the next person in the statutory line of succession who holds a position to which they were confirmed by the Senate or elected by the people, as applicable.
- (2) **Panel Fallback.** If no confirmed or elected officer exists in the line of succession, the Chief Justice shall, within fourteen (14) days, convene a panel of three confirmed officers from other constitutional offices or, for Regional offices, from other Regions, to exercise the constitutional powers of the vacant office collectively until a confirmed officer assumes the position.
- (3) **Suspension.** If neither succession nor a panel can be constituted within thirty (30) days of the acting period's expiration, the constitutional powers of the office shall be suspended until a confirmed officer assumes the position, except that powers necessary to protect life, safety, or constitutional rights in an emergency shall be exercised by the senior confirmed officer of the executive branch or, for Regional offices, of the Regional executive.

(e) **Multi-Member Body Quorum Protection.**

- (1) For constitutional bodies consisting of multiple members, including the Allocation Review Board (Article II, Section 7) and the Independent Fiscal Council (Article X, Section 5), the appointing authority shall fill any vacancy within ninety (90) days.
- (2) If the appointing authority fails to act within ninety (90) days, the Chief Justice shall make a temporary appointment from among qualified professionals with relevant expertise. For the Allocation Review Board, appointments shall be drawn from retired appellate judges, consistent with Article II, Section 7(f). For the Independent Fiscal Council, appointments shall be drawn from persons with demonstrated expertise in public finance, economics, or fiscal policy who have no current affiliation with any Regional government.
- (3) Temporary appointments under this subsection are subject to the time limits of subsection (b).
- (4) **Quorum Emergency.** If vacancies reduce a constitutional body below the quorum necessary to exercise its constitutional functions, the remaining members and the Chief Justice shall fill emergency vacancies within thirty (30) days using the procedures of paragraph (2), notwithstanding any other appointment provision. A body reduced below quorum may take no action other than to facilitate the filling of vacancies.

(f) **Anti-Circumvention.**

- (1) **Revolving Door Prohibition.** The one hundred twenty-day period runs from the date of the vacancy, not from the date of the acting official's designation. Re-designating the same person, replacing one acting official with another, or any other procedural manipulation shall not restart, extend, or reset the period.
- (2) **Delegation Prohibition.** An acting official may not delegate constitutional powers to any person who has not been confirmed or elected to a constitutional office. Delegated acts are attributed to the delegating acting official for purposes of the time limit.
- (3) **Dual-Hat Prohibition.** A person who holds a confirmed position in one office and is designated as acting official of another office may exercise constitutional powers of the acting office only within the time limit of this section. The confirmed position does not extend or substitute for the time limit applicable to the acting designation.
- (4) **Functional Coverage.** This section applies to any person exercising constitutional powers of a vacant office, regardless of title, designation, or the formal mechanism of appointment, including "first assistant" succession, interim designation, or delegation by the vacating officer.

(g) **Regional Acting Officials.**

- (1) **Constitutional Floor.** A Regional acting official — including an acting Governor serving under Regional succession law — may not exercise constitutional powers granted by this Constitution, including Guard refusal (Article XI-RF, Section 2(d)) and emergency declaration (Article XVII-RF, Section 1), beyond the time limit established in subsection (b)(1).
- (2) Regional constitutions may establish time limits that are shorter than, but not longer than, those established in this section for exercise of constitutional powers granted by this Constitution.
- (3) Regional constitutional powers not granted by this Constitution (powers arising solely from Regional constitutions) are governed by Regional law, but this section provides a non-waivable floor for any power enumerated in this Constitution.

(h) **Temporary Judicial Officers.**

- (1) Temporary judges appointed under Article IV, Section 5(d)(3) or any other provision of this Constitution shall serve for no more than one hundred eighty (180) calendar days unless confirmed through applicable judicial confirmation procedures.
- (2) Temporary judges may exercise full judicial authority during the one hundred eighty-day period but may not be assigned to cases with expected duration beyond their authorized service period.
- (3) Judicial confirmation procedures shall be governed by Article XIV-RF and applicable statute.

(i) **Enforcement.**

- (1) **Automatic Suspension.** Upon expiration of the time limit established in subsection (b), the acting official's authority to exercise constitutional powers is automatically suspended by operation of law. Actions taken in exercise of constitutional powers after the expiration are void ab initio.
- (2) **Judicial Petition.** Any member of the confirming body, the Governor-Elect (for Regional offices), any State or Region affected by the acting official's exercise of constitutional powers, or any person with a concrete interest adversely affected by a constitutional power exercise may petition a federal court to: (a) declare that the time limit has expired and the acting official's constitutional authority has been suspended; (b) declare void any action taken after expiration; or (c) issue a mandatory order requiring the appointing authority to transmit a nomination.
- (3) **Standing.** The confirming body as an institution, individual members of the confirming body, and any constitutional body whose functions are affected by the vacancy shall have standing to enforce this section.
- (4) **Expedited Review.** Petitions under this subsection shall be heard on an expedited basis, with initial hearing within fourteen (14) days and final disposition within forty-five (45) days.

(j) **Emergency Exception.**

- (1) If a genuine emergency requiring the exercise of constitutional powers arises within thirty (30) days of the expiration of the acting period, and no confirmed officer or succession mechanism is available, the acting official may continue to exercise the specific constitutional powers necessary to address the emergency for up to thirty (30) additional calendar days.
- (2) Extension under this subsection requires: (a) written certification by the acting official specifying the emergency and the constitutional powers to be exercised; (b) concurrence of the relevant confirming body by majority vote within seventy-two (72) hours of certification (failure to act within seventy-two hours constitutes denial); and (c) immediate notification to the Chief Justice, who may order expedited judicial review.
- (3) The emergency extension applies only to the enumerated critical constitutional powers of Guard command and emergency declaration. Other constitutional powers may not be extended under this subsection.
- (4) The emergency extension may not be renewed. Upon expiration, the succession and fallback provisions of subsection (d) apply without further delay.

(k) **Coordination.**

- (1) This section complements and shall be construed in coordination with the confirmation procedures of Section 4-B. Where a nomination is pending, the confirmation timeline of Section 4-B and the acting official timeline of this section operate concurrently, subject to tolling under subsection (b)(2).
- (2) This section applies in addition to the restrictions of Article V, Section 4-A (Regional Executive Transition Integrity). Where both sections apply to the same person — including an acting Regional Governor during a transition period — the more restrictive provision governs.
- (3) Acting officials who receive deemed confirmation under Section 4-B(e) hold full authority from the date of deemed confirmation, and the time limits of this section cease to apply.
- (4) This section is self-executing and does not require implementing legislation. Congress may enact legislation to supplement but not diminish its protections.

### Section 4-D. Confirmation Integrity and Institutional Continuity

*Addresses Gap 90: The Senate "Blue-Slipping" of Constitutional Officers. Establishes holdover authority, qualification standards, serial rejection anti-gaming, and confirmation obstruction detection to prevent depopulation of constitutional institutions through strategic confirmation blocking.*

(a) **Holdover Authority.** Members of Constitutional Oversight Bodies established by this Constitution, including the Allocation Review Board and the Independent Fiscal Council:

- (1) May continue to serve beyond the expiration of their term until a successor has been confirmed or deemed confirmed under Section 4-B, provided holdover service does not exceed one (1) year beyond term expiration;
- (2) During holdover service, the member retains full authority to participate in deliberations, vote, and exercise all powers of the position;
- (3) Holdover service counts toward quorum calculations as if the member's term had not expired;
- (4) Holdover authority terminates upon the earlier of: (i) a successor taking office; (ii) the expiration of one year beyond term expiration; or (iii) the member's death, resignation, removal for cause, or incapacity;
- (5) If holdover authority expires without a successor in place, the vacancy provisions of Section 4-C apply, including temporary appointment by the Chief Justice under Section 4-C(e)(2);
- (6) When a vacancy exists or holdover service commences under this subsection, the appointing authority shall submit a nomination within thirty (30) calendar days. Failure to nominate within this period does not extend or terminate holdover authority but shall be publicly reported by the Clerk of the Senate and transmitted to each Regional legislature.

(b) **Qualification Standards.** Nominees to Constitutional Oversight Bodies established by this Constitution:

- (1) Must meet objective qualification criteria established by law for the specific position, which shall include minimum standards of professional experience, educational attainment, and demonstrated expertise relevant to the body's constitutional functions;
- (2) Must not have a disqualifying conflict of interest, as defined by law, with the constitutional functions of the body to which they are nominated;
- (3) Prior to committee hearings, a Constitutional Oversight Body other than the one to which the nominee is designated shall certify whether the nominee meets the objective qualification criteria established under paragraph (1). The certifying body shall be: for nominations to the Allocation Review Board, the National Election Court; for nominations to the National Election Court, the Allocation Review Board; and for other Constitutional Oversight Bodies, as designated by law or, absent statutory designation, the Allocation Review Board. The certifying body shall issue its certification within twenty-one (21) calendar days of the date of nomination. If the certifying body fails to act within twenty-one days or lacks a quorum to act, the nominee is deemed certified as meeting the qualification criteria. This certification is advisory and does not bind the Senate, but a Senate rejection of a certified-qualified nominee — including a nominee deemed certified under this paragraph — counts as an unreasoned rejection for purposes of subsection (c) unless the rejection statement under paragraph (4) identifies specific qualification deficiencies not addressed by or not considered in the certification;
- (4) The Senate may reject a nominee for failure to meet qualification standards under paragraph (1), documented ethical violations, or disqualifying conflicts of interest under paragraph (2). The Senate's vote to reject shall be accompanied by a public written statement specifying the basis for rejection from among these categories;
- (5) The written statement requirement under paragraph (4) is a transparency obligation. Failure to issue a written statement does not invalidate a rejection vote, but an unreasoned rejection counts toward the serial rejection threshold under subsection (c).

(c) **Serial Rejection Anti-Gaming.** If the Senate rejects two or more consecutive nominees for the same position on a Constitutional Oversight Body:

- (1) Upon the second consecutive rejection, the confirmation period under Section 4-B(b) for the next nominee for that position reduces from ninety (90) to sixty (60) calendar days;
- (2) Upon the third consecutive rejection, the confirmation period for the next nominee for that position is forty-five (45) calendar days from the date of nomination. If the Senate does not vote to reject within this period, the nominee is deemed confirmed by operation of this subsection without reference to the timelines of Section 4-B(b). A rejection vote within the forty-five-day period is valid only if the rejection statement under subsection (b)(4) cites specific qualification deficiencies, documented ethical violations, or disqualifying conflicts of interest — a rejection without such specification is void;
- (3) A rejection vote that fails to meet the requirements of paragraph (2) does not interrupt deemed confirmation under this subsection, and the nominee takes office on the forty-sixth (46th) calendar day;
- (4) For purposes of this subsection, "consecutive rejections" means rejections of different nominees for the same position. Renomination of a previously rejected individual does not reset the consecutive rejection count;
- (5) The consecutive rejection count resets upon: (i) a nominee being confirmed or deemed confirmed for the position; (ii) a change in the office of President or, for positions appointed by other authorities, a change in the appointing authority; or (iii) the commencement of a new Congress.

(d) **Named Procedural Prohibitions.** In addition to the procedural protections established in Section 4-B(b)(iv) and (c)(iv):

- (1) No Senate rule, tradition, custom, or practice — including "blue-slip" objections, "courtesy holds," anonymous holds, or any procedure by which a single Senator or group of Senators from the nominee's home Region may prevent or delay committee hearings — may be applied to delay, prevent, or condition committee hearings or floor votes on nominations to Constitutional Oversight Bodies or judicial positions created by this Constitution;
- (2) Paragraph (1) does not restrict individual Senators from voting against a nominee or from publicly stating objections to a nominee. The prohibition applies to procedural mechanisms that prevent a vote from occurring, not to the exercise of voting rights;
- (3) All votes to reject nominees to Constitutional Oversight Bodies or judicial positions created by this Constitution shall be by recorded roll-call vote. Voice votes, division votes, or any other voting method that does not produce a public record of each Senator's individual vote are not valid for rejection of such nominees;
- (4) This subsection is self-executing. Any Senate rule inconsistent with this subsection is void ab initio as applied to nominations covered by this section.

(e) **Confirmation Obstruction Finding.** The Allocation Review Board, or the National Election Court for nominations to its own membership, may find confirmation obstruction if:

- (1) The Senate has rejected three or more consecutive qualified nominees for the same position and the rejection statements under subsection (b)(4) do not cite specific qualification deficiencies, documented ethical violations, or disqualifying conflicts of interest;
- (2) Vacancies on a Constitutional Oversight Body have exceeded the body's quorum threshold for more than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive calendar days due to Senate inaction or serial rejection;
- (3) A pattern of confirmation delay or rejection demonstrates that the purpose is to prevent the constitutional body from functioning rather than to exercise the Senate's legitimate qualitative check on nominees;
- (4) The obstruction finding shall be adopted by a majority vote of the non-vacant members of the finding body, provided that no fewer than three (3) members participate in the vote. If the finding body has fewer than three non-vacant members, the Chief Justice of the National Constitutional Court may make the obstruction finding upon petition by any non-vacant member of the affected body, the President, or any Regional legislature. The finding shall be published in the Federal Register and transmitted to the President, the Senate, and the public;
- (5) An obstruction finding under this subsection is subject to expedited judicial review before the National Constitutional Court, limited to procedural regularity — including whether the finding body met the quorum requirement of paragraph (4) and whether the factual predicates of paragraphs (1) through (3) were facially satisfied. The Court shall render its decision within thirty (30) calendar days of the petition for review. Substantive review of whether the Senate's rejections constituted obstruction is not available under this paragraph.

(f) **Obstruction Consequences.** Upon a finding of confirmation obstruction under subsection (e):

- (1) The confirmation period under Section 4-B(b) reduces to sixty (60) calendar days for all pending and future nominees to the affected body, until the body has reached full authorized membership or until two years have elapsed from the finding, whichever is earlier;
- (2) The named procedural prohibitions of subsection (d) extend to all Senate proceedings related to nominations to the affected body, including committee scheduling, witness selection, and document production;
- (3) The Senate may not invoke the removal safety valve of Section 4-B(f) against any nominee deemed confirmed during the obstruction period;
- (4) The finding shall be transmitted to each Regional legislature whose Senators voted to reject the nominees identified in the obstruction finding, and shall be a matter of public record that may not be sealed, expunged, or classified.

(g) **Regional Accountability.** When a confirmation obstruction finding under subsection (e) identifies Senators whose votes constituted the majority of rejection votes:

- (1) The finding shall identify the Regions represented by those Senators;
- (2) The identified Regions' delegations shall be publicly noted in the finding, and the finding shall be transmitted to each identified Region's legislature and chief executive;
- (3) This subsection imposes no legal penalty on the identified Senators or Regions beyond disclosure. Regional electorates and legislatures may exercise their own accountability mechanisms.

(h) **Coordination.** This section complements and shall be construed in coordination with:

- (1) Section 4-B (Mandatory Confirmation Procedures) — the timelines established in this section modify the default timelines of Section 4-B where this section provides shorter deadlines. Where a specific provision of this Constitution establishes a confirmation timeline shorter than those in this section, that provision controls;
- (2) Section 4-C (Acting Official Limitations) — holdover authority under subsection (a) does not extend or modify the time limits on acting officials under Section 4-C. Holdover and acting service are separate mechanisms: holdover applies to members whose terms have expired, while acting service applies to persons serving in an acting capacity for a vacant position;
- (3) Article VII, Section 8(l) (Appointment and Removal Freeze) — during Caretaker Governance, the restrictions of Article VII, Section 8(l) apply in addition to this section. Holdover authority under subsection (a) continues during Caretaker Governance but does not permit new appointments or confirmations that are frozen under Section 8(l).

### Section 4-E. Emergency Session Integrity and Quorum Protection

*Addresses Gap 106: The Senate Quorum Trap for Federal Emergency Inaction. Establishes attendance duties, quorum definitions, and default outcomes to prevent coordinated Senate absence from disabling constitutional oversight of emergency powers and domestic force deployment.*

**(a) General Senate Quorum.**

- (1) For all Senate functions other than adjudication under Section 4(g), quorum shall consist of a majority of Senators who have been certified and seated.
- (2) Vacant seats — whether due to death, resignation, removal, expiration of term without a successor, or failure of a Region to elect or appoint Senators — shall not count against quorum calculation.
- (3) A Senator who has been certified and seated but who is absent shall be counted toward the quorum denominator. Deliberate absence does not reduce the number of Senators from whom a majority must be calculated.

**(b) Emergency Session Attendance Duty.**

- (1) During any declared federal emergency under Article XVII, during any active domestic force deployment requiring Congressional oversight, or during any pending Congressional Key Override proceeding under Article XI, Section 14, all Senators shall attend sessions called for emergency oversight purposes unless physically incapacitated.
- (2) Remote participation through secure, authenticated communication satisfies the attendance requirement. Congress shall provide by law for secure remote participation facilities. If such facilities have not been established by law, or are unavailable during an emergency, the Presiding Officer shall accept any commercially available secure communication method that permits visual identification and real-time participation.
- (3) Absence from an emergency oversight session without certification of objective physical incapacity — specifically, hospitalization, strict medical isolation, or incapacity preventing both physical and remote participation — by a licensed physician constitutes a breach of constitutional duty. Any Senator may petition the National Constitutional Court for expedited review of such certifications within forty-eight (48) hours.
- (4) A Senator who is absent without valid cause from three or more emergency oversight sessions within a single emergency period shall be referred to the Senate Ethics Committee and may be subject to censure.

**(c) Coordinated Absence Finding.**

- (1) The Senate Presiding Officer, or in the Presiding Officer's absence the most senior Senator present, may find "Coordinated Absence" when:
    - (i) Senators from two or more Regions are simultaneously absent from an emergency oversight session without certification of physical incapacity meeting the standard of subsection (b)(3);
    - (ii) the uncertified absences under paragraph (i), considered independently of any Senators who have provided valid incapacity certifications, prevent the Senate from achieving quorum; and
    - (iii) the absences exhibit a pattern suggesting coordination to defeat constitutional oversight.
- (2) A Coordinated Absence finding may be made by recorded vote of the Senators present, notwithstanding any quorum requirement. A majority of Senators present and voting shall suffice.
- (3) The Coordinated Absence finding shall specify the names of absent Senators without valid incapacity certification, the session from which they are absent, and the constitutional function the absence prevents. Senators with valid incapacity certifications are excluded from the finding.
- (4) No Coordinated Absence finding may be made unless at least one-third of seated Senators are present at the time of the finding.

**(d) Consequences of Coordinated Absence Finding.**

- (1) Upon a Coordinated Absence finding, absent Senators named in the finding shall be counted as present for quorum purposes.
- (2) The emergency oversight vote shall proceed. Named absent Senators shall be recorded as abstaining, not as absent. Senators excluded from the finding due to valid incapacity certification are not counted as present and are not recorded as abstaining.
- (3) For any vote requiring a simple majority, the threshold shall be a majority of Senators present and voting. For any vote requiring a supermajority threshold specified elsewhere in this Constitution — including but not limited to treaty ratification, constitutional amendment participation, and removal under Section 4-B(f) — the threshold shall be calculated from the total number of seated Senators, not from Senators present and voting.
- (4) No emergency oversight vote under this subsection may proceed unless at least one-third of seated Senators are present, including in person and by remote participation. This minimum-presence requirement applies independently of the quorum established by the Coordinated Absence finding.
- (5) A vote conducted under this subsection has the same legal force and effect as a vote conducted with all Senators present.
- (6) The Coordinated Absence finding and the resulting vote shall be published in the official Senate record and transmitted to each Region's Governor and legislature within twenty-four (24) hours.
- (7) A Senator affected by a Coordinated Absence finding may petition the National Constitutional Court for review after the emergency oversight vote has been conducted. The Court shall review only whether the finding was procedurally regular and whether the criteria of subsection (c)(1) were met. No petition shall stay, suspend, or invalidate the vote conducted under this subsection pending review.

**(e) Emergency Oversight Vote Guarantees.**

- (1) **Emergency Termination Vote.** During any declared federal emergency, the Senate shall hold a recorded vote on a joint resolution of termination:
    - (i) within seventy-two (72) hours of the emergency declaration, or within seventy-two (72) hours of a request by any Senator or by the House of Representatives;
    - (ii) at intervals of not more than thirty (30) days thereafter for the duration of the emergency;
    - (iii) these votes may not be delayed, tabled, or prevented by procedural motions, scheduling actions, or adjournment.
- (2) **Domestic Deployment Oversight Vote.** During any active domestic force deployment:
    - (i) the Senate shall hold a recorded vote on disapproval within forty-eight (48) hours of the deployment or within forty-eight (48) hours of a request by any Senator or by the House;
    - (ii) disapproval by majority vote of the Senate, combined with House action as required by law, shall terminate the deployment within seventy-two (72) hours;
    - (iii) these votes may not be delayed, tabled, or prevented by procedural motions, scheduling actions, or adjournment.
- (3) **Congressional Key Override Vote.** When the House has voted to activate the Congressional Key Override under Article XI, Section 14:
    - (i) the Senate shall hold a recorded vote within forty-eight (48) hours;
    - (ii) no procedural motion may delay the vote;
    - (iii) the vote threshold is as specified in Article XI, Section 14(d).
- (4) **Auto-Scheduling.** If a vote required by this subsection has not been scheduled by the Presiding Officer by the deadline specified herein, the vote shall be deemed scheduled by operation of law for noon on the next calendar day. No act of the Presiding Officer, Majority Leader, or any other Senator is required for the vote to occur at the deemed-scheduled time.

**(f) Default Outcomes upon Persistent Quorum Failure.**

- (1) **Emergency Termination Default.** If the Senate cannot hold the specific emergency termination vote required by subsection (e)(1) — whether due to quorum failure, failure to schedule, or adjournment before voting — for three (3) consecutive required vote occasions or for thirty (30) consecutive calendar days, whichever occurs first, the emergency shall be deemed terminated by operation of law. The holding of quorum for other legislative business does not reset this count.
- (2) **Deployment Disapproval Default.** If the Senate cannot hold the specific deployment oversight vote required by subsection (e)(2) — whether due to quorum failure, failure to schedule, or adjournment before voting — within seventy-two (72) hours of the required vote, the deployment shall be deemed disapproved and shall terminate within seventy-two (72) hours.
- (3) **Re-Declaration Limitation.** An emergency terminated under paragraph (1) or a deployment terminated under paragraph (2) may be re-declared or re-authorized by the President, but the same default rules apply to each subsequent declaration or deployment. No re-declaration or re-authorization resets the persistent quorum failure clock, regardless of any intervening period of quorum or legislative session, if the new declaration relies on substantially the same underlying facts or circumstances.
- (4) **Interaction with Emergency Powers Reform.** The default termination provisions of this subsection operate in addition to, and do not replace, the auto-expiration provisions of Article XVII, Section 4(c). Where this subsection provides a shorter timeline to termination than Article XVII, this subsection controls.

**(g) Transparency and Accountability.**

- (1) The Senate shall publish, in real time to the extent practicable:
    - (i) quorum status for all emergency oversight sessions;
    - (ii) attendance records for all Senators during emergency periods, including reasons provided for any absences;
    - (iii) the dates and outcomes of all Coordinated Absence findings.
- (2) Within thirty (30) days of the termination of any federal emergency, the Senate shall publish a complete report of attendance, quorum status, and votes during the emergency period.
- (3) The Comptroller General shall include Senate emergency session attendance and quorum data in the post-emergency audit required by Article XVII, Section 5(d).

**(h) Coordination.**

- (1) This section supplements the adjudication quorum provisions of Section 4(g), which continue to govern quorum for intergovernmental dispute adjudication. Where both this section and Section 4(g) could apply, the more specific provision governs.
- (2) The attendance duty and quorum provisions of this section do not modify the confirmation procedures of Section 4-B, which provide independent protection against quorum manipulation through deemed confirmation.
- (3) The emergency oversight vote guarantees of subsection (e) operate in coordination with, and do not replace, the Congressional oversight obligations established in Article XVII, Section 5 (Emergency Powers Reform). Where this section establishes shorter timelines for Senate action, this section controls for the Senate; the House shall act according to its own rules and any applicable provisions of Article XVII.

### Section 4-F. Treaty Ratification Accountability

*Addresses Gap 125: The Senate Treaty Blockade (Minority Veto). Establishes mandatory consideration timelines, a population-weighted House override for treaties rejected by the Senate, pre-negotiation consultation requirements, and a Treaty Blockade finding for serial rejection.*

**(a) Standard Ratification and Mandatory Consideration.**

- (1) Except as provided in subsection (b), treaty ratification requires approval by two-thirds of seated Senators, by recorded roll-call vote.
- (2) The President shall transmit any signed treaty to the Senate for ratification consideration, together with a certification that the treaty text is final and the administrative record complete. The Senate shall hold a recorded vote on ratification within one hundred twenty (120) days of such certification. If the President has not transmitted certification within one hundred eighty (180) days of treaty signature, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, or its equivalent, may by majority vote deem the treaty certified for purposes of this paragraph, commencing the one hundred twenty (120) day period.
- (3) If the Senate neither ratifies nor rejects the treaty by recorded vote within one hundred twenty (120) days, the treaty shall be deemed rejected for purposes of subsections (b) and (d). Deemed rejection does not constitute affirmative Senate action, and the treaty does not take effect unless the House override under subsection (b) is achieved.
- (4) Each Senator voting to reject a treaty shall submit a written statement of reasons within fourteen (14) days, which shall be published in the official Senate record. Failure to submit a statement does not invalidate the vote, but the absence of a statement shall create a rebuttable presumption for purposes of subsection (d)(2) that the Senator's rejection lacked specific objection to the treaty text, negotiation process, or compliance mechanism. A Senator may rebut this presumption by providing a written statement to the Allocation Review Board during any Treaty Blockade investigation.

**(b) House Proportional Override.**

- (1) Following Senate rejection or deemed rejection under subsection (a), the President may transmit the rejected treaty to the House of Representatives for override consideration.
- (2) The House may ratify a treaty rejected by the Senate upon the concurrence of:
    - (i) two-thirds of the seated membership of the House of Representatives, by recorded roll-call vote. For purposes of this subsection, "seated membership" means Members who have been certified and are currently serving; vacant seats are excluded; and
    - (ii) the affirmative votes of Representatives whose districts collectively contain at least sixty percent (60%) of the national population as determined by the official apportionment data from the most recent decennial census. The Clerk of the House shall certify population totals for override votes; vacant seats shall be excluded from the calculation. If a court of competent jurisdiction has ordered reapportionment based on revised population data subsequent to the most recent decennial census, the Clerk shall use the court-ordered apportionment figures for affected districts.
- (3) The House shall hold a recorded vote within ninety (90) days of presidential transmission. If the House does not achieve the override threshold within ninety (90) days, the override process terminates and the treaty is not ratified.
- (4) Following a House override vote that achieves the threshold of paragraph (2), the Senate may reconsider and ratify the treaty by the standard two-thirds vote within thirty (30) days. If the Senate ratifies on reconsideration, the treaty is ratified through standard Senate action and the House override is mooted. If the Senate does not ratify on reconsideration within thirty (30) days, the treaty shall be deemed ratified by House override.
- (5) A treaty ratified by House override has the same force and effect as a treaty ratified by Senate vote under international law. However, a treaty ratified by House override shall be non-self-executing for purposes of domestic law and shall not create judicially enforceable rights or obligations within the United States absent implementing legislation enacted by Congress through the standard legislative process.
- (6) The House override mechanism under this subsection may be invoked only once per treaty. If the House fails to achieve the override threshold, the President may resubmit the treaty to the Senate but may not invoke a second House override for the same treaty text.

**(c) Pre-Negotiation Consultation.**

- (1) The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, or its equivalent, shall receive regular briefings on treaties under active negotiation.
- (2) The Committee may provide advisory input to the President's negotiators on potential ratification concerns. Advisory input does not bind the negotiators or the Senate's ratification decision.
- (3) For treaties that would materially affect Regional interests — including trade, environmental regulation, border management, and defense basing — the President shall consult with affected Regional Governors before finalizing treaty text.
- (4) Failure to consult under this subsection does not invalidate a treaty but may be raised as a factor in Senate debate.

**(d) Treaty Blockade Finding.**

- (1) The Allocation Review Board may investigate for "Treaty Blockade" if the Senate rejects or is deemed to have rejected under subsection (a)(3) three (3) or more consecutive treaties within any four (4) year period.
- (2) "Treaty Blockade" means a pattern of serial treaty rejection in which the rejecting Senators' stated reasons fail to articulate specific objections to the treaty text, negotiation process, or compliance mechanism of each rejected treaty. The ARB shall consider:
    - (i) whether the written rejection statements under subsection (a)(4) identify specific provisions, terms, or negotiation deficiencies in each treaty, or instead reflect generalized opposition unrelated to the content of the particular treaties rejected. A statement satisfies the specificity requirement of this clause if it identifies at least one specific provision, article, clause, or term of the treaty, or a specific aspect of the negotiation process or compliance mechanism, to which the Senator objects. General statements of opposition to the treaty's subject matter, policy area, or negotiating partner, without reference to specific treaty content, do not satisfy this standard;
    - (ii) whether the same Senators or Regional delegations voted to reject each treaty regardless of subject matter;
    - (iii) whether conditions were attached to ratification that are unrelated to the treaty's terms.
- (3) The ARB shall adopt a Treaty Blockade finding by majority vote of its non-vacant members, provided that no fewer than three (3) members participate in the vote.
- (4) Upon a Treaty Blockade finding:
    - (i) the population threshold for House override under subsection (b)(2)(ii) is reduced from sixty percent (60%) to fifty-five percent (55%) for a period of two (2) years from the date of the finding;
    - (ii) the House vote threshold under subsection (b)(2)(i) remains two-thirds of seated membership;
    - (iii) the reduced threshold applies to all treaties submitted during the two-year period, not only to the treaties that triggered the finding.
- (5) A Treaty Blockade finding is subject to expedited judicial review before the National Constitutional Court, limited to procedural regularity and whether the factual predicates of paragraphs (1) and (2) were facially satisfied. The Court shall render its decision within thirty (30) calendar days of the petition for review. Substantive review of whether the Senate's rejections constituted a blockade is not available under this paragraph.

**(e) Transparency and Accountability.**

- (1) The Senate shall publish, within thirty (30) days of each treaty vote:
    - (i) the full text of the treaty as submitted;
    - (ii) the recorded vote of each Senator;
    - (iii) written statements of reasons from Senators voting to reject.
- (2) The ARB shall maintain a public registry of treaty submissions, Senate votes, and outcomes, including deemed rejections, House override proceedings, and Treaty Blockade findings.

**(f) Coordination.**

- (1) This section does not modify the treaty withdrawal procedures of Article II, Section 19. Senate consent requirements for treaty withdrawal are independent of this section.
- (2) The House override mechanism under subsection (b) applies only to treaty ratification. It does not extend to Senate confirmation of officers, participation in constitutional amendments, or adjudication of intergovernmental disputes.
- (3) The quorum and Coordinated Absence protections of Section 4-E apply to treaty ratification votes under this section. The supermajority threshold for standard ratification under subsection (a)(1) shall be calculated from the total number of seated Senators in accordance with Section 4-E(d)(3).
- (4) Treaties between the United States and Indigenous Nations, governed by Article XXIII (Indigenous Sovereignty Preservation), are not subject to the House override mechanism under subsection (b). The free, prior, and informed consent requirements of Article XXIII, Section 4 apply independently of this section.
- (5) **Transition Freeze.** The House override mechanism under subsection (b) shall not be initiated or concluded during the Presidential Transition Period defined in Article II, Section 19(f). The procedural deadlines established in subsections (a)(2), (a)(3), (b)(3), (b)(4), and (d)(4)(i) are tolled during such period. The four-year lookback period in subsection (d)(1) is a calendar measurement that runs continuously and is not subject to tolling under this paragraph. Override proceedings pending at the commencement of the Transition Period are suspended and resume upon its conclusion. The Transition Freeze is not subject to waiver. Upon inauguration, the newly inaugurated President may re-certify any pending treaty under subsection (a)(2) to resume or initiate proceedings.

### Section 5. Federal Lawmaking

(a) Bills within enumerated federal powers may be introduced in the House of Representatives.

(b) Upon passage by the House, bills shall be presented to the President for signature.

(c) The President may sign or veto the bill. A presidential veto may be overridden by a two-thirds vote of the House of Representatives.

(d) The Senate shall not have veto power over ordinary legislation. Senate concurrence is required only for matters specified in Section 4.

(e) Senate Review of Interregional Coordination Matters. For bills affecting interregional coordination (shared natural resources, equalization formulas, Regional mandates, boundary procedures), the Senate may delay presentation to the President to propose amendments, but cannot permanently block legislation.

- (1) The Senate must complete review within 60 days of receiving a bill from the House. If no action is taken within 60 days, the bill shall be automatically presented to the President.
- (2) If the Senate proposes amendments, the House may accept, reject, or modify them within 30 days. The House's final action is conclusive.
- (3) The Senate may invoke review by majority vote within 10 days of House passage. Failure to invoke review waives the delay authority.
- (4) During Senate review, the bill's sponsors in the House may request expedited review (30 days) upon showing urgent circumstances.

(f) The categories triggering Senate review may not be expanded except by constitutional amendment.

(g) Implementation procedures are established by statute. See the [Interregional Coordination Legislative Review Act](../../proposals/01-foundations/interregional-coordination-review-act.md) for the proposed implementing legislation.

### Section 5-A. The Deliberation Mandate (Single-Subject and Readability Requirements)

*Addresses Gap 219: The "Unread Law" Gap (Omnibus Chaos). Ensures deliberative democracy by requiring that legislation be limited to a single subject, publicly available for genuine review, and structured for transparency.*

(a) **Single-Subject Requirement.** Every Bill before Congress shall embrace but one subject, which shall be expressed in its title. For purposes of this section, "subject" means a single, reasonably narrow policy objective; labels such as "general government operations," "national security," or similarly capacious descriptors do not satisfy this requirement.

- (1) A bill that contains provisions unrelated to its stated subject is void as to the unrelated provisions.
- (2) "Omnibus" packaging of unrelated legislation is prohibited.
- (3) Appropriations bills may contain only provisions that allocate funds, establish conditions on the expenditure of the funds allocated therein, or impose reporting and oversight requirements tied to the appropriation account. Provisions that alter, restrict, or expand substantive law or regulatory authority unrelated to the mechanics of the expenditure — including limitation riders conditioning funding on non-enforcement of otherwise valid law — are void.
- (4) Enforcement of this subsection is governed by Article XIV-RF, Section 5 (Standing to Enforce the Constitution). No separate time limit restricts the filing of challenges under this subsection.

(b) **Publication Requirement.** No Bill may receive a floor vote until:

- (1) The final text has been publicly posted in searchable, machine-readable format on the official congressional publication system, with a verifiable timestamp, for not less than seventy-two (72) calendar hours;
- (2) A plain-language summary not exceeding ten percent (10%) of the bill's word count has been prepared and posted, as provided by law;
- (3) A fiscal impact estimate has been completed and posted by the Congressional Budget Office or its successor; provided that if no estimate is produced within fourteen (14) calendar days of a formal scoring request by the bill's sponsor or committee of jurisdiction, this requirement is waived and the bill may proceed without a score;
- (4) A committee report explaining the bill's provisions has been filed; provided that for bills discharged under Article I, Section 19, the bill's sponsor or sponsors may file a statement in lieu of a committee report satisfying this requirement.

(c) **Extended Review for Complex Legislation.** For bills exceeding one hundred (100) pages in standard legislative format:

- (1) The seventy-two-hour period in subsection (b)(1) extends to seven (7) calendar days;
- (2) A section-by-section index with page references is required;
- (3) Each section must be separately voteable upon motion of twenty percent (20%) of the total membership of the chamber.

(d) **Definition Transparency.** Definitions in legislation:

- (1) Must appear within the first ten percent (10%) of the bill's pages;
- (2) May not assign counterintuitive meanings to common terms, as determined by the presiding officer subject to appeal by majority vote of the chamber;
- (3) Must be cross-referenced wherever the defined term appears.

(e) **Amendment Procedure.** No procedural rule may prevent:

- (1) Members from offering amendments to remove individual provisions;
- (2) Separate votes on severable portions of legislation;
- (3) Motions to divide compound bills into component parts.

(f) **Conference Committee Reports.** A conference report shall be treated as a new bill for purposes of the publication requirements of subsections (b) and (c). The publication period restarts upon the filing of the conference report.

(g) **Post-Amendment Publication.**

- (1) An amendment adopted after the publication period has been satisfied that increases the bill's word count by more than ten percent (10%) or introduces subject matter not contained in the published version restarts the full publication period under subsections (b) and (c).
- (2) An amendment that does not meet the threshold in paragraph (1) requires reposting of the amended text for not less than twenty-four (24) calendar hours before a floor vote.
- (3) The presiding officer shall determine whether an amendment meets the threshold in paragraph (1), subject to appeal by majority vote of the chamber.

(h) **Waiver Limitations.**

- (1) The publication and review requirements of subsections (b) through (g) may be waived only by three-fourths (3/4) vote of the House of Representatives, and only during a Declared National Emergency under Article XVII.
- (2) Even when waived, the final text must be publicly posted for not less than twenty-four (24) calendar hours before a floor vote.
- (3) Publication requirements may not be waived for legislation exceeding two hundred (200) pages.
- (4) The single-subject requirement of subsection (a) may not be waived under any circumstances.

(i) **Interaction with Discharge Mandate.** The publication period under this section runs concurrently with any pending discharge period under Article I, Section 19. No floor vote may occur until both the publication requirement of this section and the discharge procedure of Article I, Section 19 are satisfied.

(j) **Domain Certification Coordination.** This section operates independently of and in addition to the Domain Certification requirements of Article II, Section 5. The single-subject requirement of subsection (a) provides the enforcement mechanism for the anti-omnibus principle declared in Article II, Section 5(b)(6)(iii). A bill that satisfies the single-subject requirement of this section may still require Domain Certification if it impacts a Regional Exclusive Domain.

(k) **Implementing Legislation.** Congress shall provide by law for the designation of the non-partisan office responsible for preparing plain-language summaries under subsection (b)(2), the standards governing official congressional publication under subsection (b)(1), and the procedures for determining page count and word count under this section.

### Section 6. Senate Legitimacy and Population Rebalancing

(a) **Decennial Population Review.** Following each decennial census, the Independent Boundary Review Commission shall assess whether population disparities among Regions have reached levels that threaten the legitimacy of Senate adjudication functions.

(b) **Legitimacy Threshold.** A "Legitimacy Imbalance" exists when:

- (1) the most populous Region exceeds the least populous Region by a ratio greater than 50:1; or
- (2) Regions containing less than five percent of the national population collectively hold more than thirty percent of Senate seats; or
- (3) a majority of Senate seats are held by Regions containing less than twenty percent of the national population.

(c) **Mandatory Response.** Upon finding a Legitimacy Imbalance, the Commission shall:

- (1) recommend boundary adjustments that would reduce the imbalance while respecting geographic and cultural coherence;
- (2) recommend merger options for Regions below a minimum population threshold (one percent of national population);
- (3) submit recommendations to Congress and all Regional Governors within one year of census certification.

(d) **Weighted Adjudication Alternative.** If boundary adjustment is not feasible or is rejected, the following weighted adjudication system shall apply to Senate dispute resolution functions:

- (1) For disputes under Section 4 (inter-Regional disputes), each Region's vote shall be weighted by the square root of its population relative to other Regions;
- (2) Population weighting shall not apply to ordinary legislative functions of the Senate;
- (3) The weighting formula shall be recalculated following each census.

(e) **Super-Minority Protection.** Notwithstanding subsection (d), small-population Regions retain:

- (1) absolute veto over boundary changes affecting their Region;
- (2) equal standing to bring disputes before the Senate;
- (3) guaranteed minimum representation in all federal institutions.

(f) **Legitimacy Review Trigger.** If three or more Regions formally declare that Senate adjudication lacks democratic legitimacy due to population imbalance:

- (1) The declaration shall trigger expedited constitutional review by the Supreme Court;
- (2) The Court may order temporary modifications to adjudication procedures pending structural reform;
- (3) Congress shall hold hearings within ninety days on constitutional amendments to address the imbalance.

(g) **Periodic Reauthorization of Parity Rule.** The equal-representation principle for the Senate shall be subject to reauthorization:

- (1) Every twenty years following ratification, the principle shall be submitted to national referendum;
- (2) Reauthorization requires approval by majority of voters and by voters in at least four of seven Regions;
- (3) If reauthorization fails, Congress shall propose alternative representation formulas within two years.

(h) **Anti-Manipulation.** Population figures for purposes of this section shall be:

- (1) based solely on the decennial census conducted by the Census Bureau;
- (2) unadjusted for citizenship status, incarceration, or other factors that might be manipulated;
- (3) certified by the Census Bureau Director, whose certification is final and non-reviewable.

### Section 7. The Acquisition Shield

*Integrated from Gap 218 -- closes the Fourth Amendment commercial data purchase loophole.*

(a) **Equivalence Principle.** The government may not acquire through purchase, gift, compulsion, or any other means, information that it would require a warrant to obtain through direct search or seizure.

(b) **Information Covered.** This section applies to:

- (i) location tracking data, whether real-time or historical;
- (ii) communications metadata (sender, recipient, time, duration, frequency);
- (iii) browsing, search, and online activity records;
- (iv) purchase history and financial transaction records;
- (v) biometric data (facial recognition, gait analysis, voice prints);
- (vi) aggregated data profiles sufficient to reveal intimate life details;
- (vii) neural and cognitive data, whether obtained directly from neural interfaces or inferred from biometric proxies as described in Article III, Section 8(g);
- (viii) any information that, individually or in combination, would reveal information protected from warrantless search.

(c) **Commercial Acquisition Treated as Search.** Government acquisition of covered information from commercial data brokers, advertisers, app developers, or other private entities:

- (i) constitutes a "search" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment;
- (ii) requires probable cause and a warrant describing with particularity the information sought;
- (iii) is subject to minimization requirements limiting retention and use;
- (iv) triggers notice requirements to affected persons within 90 days unless court grants delay.

(d) **Third-Party Doctrine Abrogation.** The mere fact that information was disclosed to or collected by a private entity does not:

- (i) eliminate the reasonable expectation of privacy in that information;
- (ii) authorize government acquisition without constitutional process;
- (iii) constitute consent to government access;
- (iv) waive Fourth Amendment protections.

(e) **Data Broker Regulations.** Entities that collect, aggregate, or sell personal information:

- (i) may not sell to any government entity information described in subsection (b) without certification that constitutional process was followed;
- (ii) must maintain records of all government purchases for five (5) years, subject to audit;
- (iii) face civil penalties of 10,000 FPU per violation and criminal liability for knowing violations;
- (iv) shall provide annual transparency reports on government data requests.

(f) **Exclusionary Rule.** Information acquired in violation of this section:

- (i) is inadmissible in any criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding;
- (ii) may not be used to develop leads or corroborate other evidence;
- (iii) must be purged from government databases upon discovery of violation;
- (iv) entitles affected persons to statutory damages of 1,000 FPU per incident.

(g) **Foreign Acquisition.** Acquisition of information on U.S. persons from foreign data brokers or through foreign intermediaries:

- (i) is subject to the same restrictions as domestic acquisition;
- (ii) may not be used to circumvent this section;
- (iii) triggers heightened reporting requirements to the Privacy and Civil Liberties Board.

(h) **Regional Application.** This section applies with equal force to:

- (i) Federal agencies and instrumentalities;
- (ii) Regional governments and agencies;
- (iii) State and local law enforcement;
- (iv) any entity acting under color of law or pursuant to government contract.

### Section 8. The Conviction Prerequisite (Abolition of Civil Asset Forfeiture)

*Integrated from Gap 239 -- eliminates the legal fiction of civil asset forfeiture and restores due process.*

(a) **Conviction Required.** The forfeiture of private property to the government is prohibited unless:

- (1) the owner has first been convicted of a criminal offense in a court of law; and
- (2) the property is proven beyond a reasonable doubt to be the direct proceeds of that specific crime or an instrumentality essential to its commission.

(b) **Abolition of Civil Forfeiture.** "Civil Asset Forfeiture"--the legal fiction of proceeding in rem against property rather than in personam against its owner--is hereby abolished for all purposes. The government may not:

- (1) sue property as a defendant;
- (2) seize property based on suspicion without criminal charge;
- (3) require owners to prove the "innocence" of their property;
- (4) shift the burden of proof from government to citizen in forfeiture proceedings.

(c) **Seizure Limitations.** Pre-conviction seizure of property is permitted only when:

- (1) a criminal charge has been filed against the property owner;
- (2) the property would be destroyed or dissipated without seizure;
- (3) a judicial officer issues a seizure warrant upon sworn probable cause; and
- (4) the owner is entitled to a prompt hearing (within 14 days) to challenge the seizure.

Property seized pre-conviction but not forfeited after conviction shall be returned with interest.

(d) **Proceeds Disposition.** Forfeited property, after conviction and all appeals, shall be:

- (1) deposited in the general treasury of the jurisdiction obtaining forfeiture;
- (2) not allocated to the seizing agency or department;
- (3) not budgeted, anticipated, or relied upon as operational revenue by law enforcement.

No law enforcement agency shall retain any direct or indirect financial benefit from forfeitures.

(e) **Equitable Sharing Prohibition.** No Regional, State, or local government may:

- (1) transfer seized property to federal agencies to circumvent this section;
- (2) receive property or proceeds from federal forfeitures that would violate this section;
- (3) participate in joint task forces whose forfeiture practices violate this section.

The federal "Equitable Sharing" program and similar arrangements are hereby abolished.

(f) **Standard of Proof.** In all forfeiture proceedings:

- (1) the government bears the burden of proof;
- (2) the standard of proof is "beyond a reasonable doubt";
- (3) forfeiture may not exceed the scope of proven criminal activity;
- (4) proportionality to the offense is required.

(g) **Innocent Owner Protection.** Property may not be forfeited from:

- (1) owners who did not know of and did not consent to the criminal use;
- (2) secured creditors with perfected interests predating the criminal activity;
- (3) bona fide purchasers for value without notice;
- (4) family members not involved in the offense.

The government bears the burden of proving owner knowledge or consent.

(h) **Right to Counsel.** Any person facing forfeiture valued above 100 FPU ($10,000) shall have the right to appointed counsel if indigent. Legal fees incurred defending against wrongful forfeiture attempts shall be compensated if the forfeiture is denied.

(i) **Return and Compensation.** If property is:

- (1) seized but charges are not filed within 90 days -- property shall be returned with interest and storage costs compensated;
- (2) seized but owner is acquitted -- property shall be returned with interest and all legal costs reimbursed;
- (3) damaged or destroyed while in government custody -- full fair market value shall be compensated;
- (4) sold before final judgment -- owner is entitled to full sale proceeds plus interest if forfeiture is not sustained.

(j) **Enforcement.** Violations of this section shall be:

- (1) actionable under 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 or its successor;
- (2) grounds for disciplinary action against responsible officials;
- (3) considered in evaluating law enforcement funding and accreditation.

Officials who knowingly violate this section forfeit qualified immunity for that conduct.

---

### Section 9. The Extradition Shield (Sovereignty Protection)

*Integrated from Gap 240 -- prevents cross-Regional prosecution for conduct lawful where performed.*

(a) **Territorial Limitation of Criminal Jurisdiction.** The criminal jurisdiction of each Region extends only to:

- (1) conduct occurring within the Region's territorial boundaries;
- (2) conduct by the Region's residents that produces direct harmful effects within the Region; or
- (3) conduct that would constitute a crime in the Region where performed and also in the prosecuting Region.

No Region may criminalize conduct occurring entirely within another Region where such conduct is lawful.

(b) **Extradition Prohibition.** No person shall be extradited from one Region to another for:

- (1) conduct that was lawful in the Region where it was performed;
- (2) conduct occurring entirely outside the demanding Region's borders;
- (3) assisting another person in performing conduct lawful where performed;
- (4) traveling to another Region to engage in conduct lawful there; or
- (5) providing information about services lawful where offered.

A Region receiving an extradition demand shall refuse the demand if any of these conditions apply.

(c) **Aiding and Abetting Shield.** No person shall be prosecuted for:

- (1) "conspiracy" to perform acts lawful where planned to be performed;
- (2) "aiding and abetting" conduct lawful where the conduct occurred;
- (3) providing transportation, information, or logistical support for activities lawful at their destination;
- (4) medical, legal, or professional services lawful in the jurisdiction where rendered.

(d) **Travel Protection.** The right of citizens to travel between Regions for any lawful purpose shall not be infringed. No Region may:

- (1) criminalize travel to another Region;
- (2) criminalize the intent to perform lawful acts in another Region;
- (3) impose civil liability for travel to obtain lawful services elsewhere;
- (4) require residents to report travel plans or purposes;
- (5) penalize employers, insurers, or others for facilitating lawful travel.

(e) **Data Protection.** No Region may:

- (1) subpoena records from another Region's government or businesses regarding conduct lawful in that Region;
- (2) require businesses to report on customers' lawful activities in other Regions;
- (3) use surveillance data to identify persons engaging in conduct lawful where performed.

Regions may refuse to comply with any demand for data regarding conduct lawful within their borders.

(f) **Retroactivity Prohibition.** No person may be prosecuted for conduct that:

- (1) was lawful in any Region when performed; or
- (2) was lawful in the Region where performed, regardless of subsequent law changes.

This prohibition applies to criminal charges, civil penalties, professional discipline, and any other government sanction.

(g) **Forum Non Conveniens.** When conduct spans multiple Regions:

- (1) the Region where the principal conduct occurred has primary jurisdiction;
- (2) prosecution shall occur in the Region with the strongest nexus to the alleged harm;
- (3) multiple prosecutions for the same conduct in different Regions are prohibited;
- (4) the first Region to assert jurisdiction retains exclusive jurisdiction.

(h) **Valid Extradition.** This section does not prohibit extradition for:

- (1) conduct that was criminal in both the demanding and asylum Regions at the time performed;
- (2) conduct occurring within the demanding Region's territory;
- (3) conduct with direct, substantial harmful effects within the demanding Region;
- (4) flight from prosecution after commission of a universally recognized crime.

(i) **Enforcement.** Any person subject to extradition, prosecution, or penalty in violation of this section may:

- (1) petition any federal court for immediate injunctive relief;
- (2) have the case removed to federal court;
- (3) recover costs and attorney fees if the claim is sustained;
- (4) seek damages from officials who knowingly violated this section.

(j) **Supremacy.** This section supersedes any Regional law, court order, or official action purporting to extend criminal jurisdiction beyond the limits established herein. Officials who execute extradition warrants or arrests in violation of this section are personally liable.

### Section 10. The Digital Papers Protection

*Integrated from Gap 245 -- extends Fourth Amendment protection to data entrusted to third parties, abolishing the third-party doctrine.*

(a) **Privacy Extends to Entrusted Data.** The right of privacy under the Fourth Amendment extends to data, records, and communications entrusted to third parties for the purpose of commerce, communication, storage, or service. Such data remains the constitutional property of the citizen who created or provided it.

(b) **Third-Party Doctrine Abolished.** The fact that information has been shared with a third party does not:

- (i) eliminate the citizen's reasonable expectation of privacy in that information;
- (ii) authorize government access without constitutional process;
- (iii) constitute consent to government surveillance;
- (iv) waive Fourth Amendment protections.

*Smith v. Maryland*, *United States v. Miller*, and their progeny are hereby overruled to the extent inconsistent with this section.

(c) **Warrant Requirement.** Government access to data held by third parties requires:

- (i) a warrant issued upon probable cause;
- (ii) the warrant must describe with particularity the data sought and the crime investigated;
- (iii) the warrant must be served on the citizen, not merely the third party, within 72 hours;
- (iv) the citizen may challenge the warrant before data is disclosed, unless court finds notice would jeopardize investigation.

(d) **Categories of Protected Data.** This section applies to, but is not limited to:

- (i) financial records held by banks, credit unions, payment processors, or investment firms;
- (ii) communications records held by phone companies, email providers, or messaging services;
- (iii) location data held by cellular carriers, GPS services, or applications;
- (iv) browsing history held by internet service providers or search engines;
- (v) purchase records held by merchants, credit card companies, or e-commerce platforms;
- (vi) health data held by pharmacies, insurance companies, fitness applications, or medical devices;
- (vii) neural and cognitive data, including data from brain-computer interfaces, neural monitoring devices, or biometric systems capable of inferring cognitive states as described in Article III, Section 8;
- (viii) any data that, individually or in aggregate, reveals intimate details of the citizen's life.

(e) **Subpoena Prohibition.** Administrative subpoenas, grand jury subpoenas, and national security letters may not be used to obtain data protected by this section. Only a judicial warrant, issued upon probable cause after adversarial hearing, suffices.

(f) **Third-Party Obligations.** Entities holding citizen data:

- (i) may not voluntarily disclose data to government without warrant or citizen consent;
- (ii) must notify citizens within 72 hours of receiving government data request, unless court orders delayed notice;
- (iii) must provide citizens with copies of data disclosed upon request;
- (iv) may not contract away citizens' Fourth Amendment rights through terms of service.

(g) **Aggregation Principle.** Individual data points that may seem innocuous alone but reveal intimate details when aggregated receive the same protection as directly sensitive data. The constitutional analysis considers the aggregate privacy invasion, not merely individual data fields.

(h) **Exclusionary Rule.** Data obtained in violation of this section:

- (i) is inadmissible in any criminal, civil, or administrative proceeding;
- (ii) may not be used to develop leads or corroborate other evidence;
- (iii) must be purged from government databases upon discovery of violation;
- (iv) entitles the citizen to statutory damages and attorney fees.

(i) **Regional Application.** This section applies to:

- (i) Federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies;
- (ii) Regional and State law enforcement;
- (iii) any entity acting under color of law or government contract;
- (iv) foreign requests for data under mutual legal assistance treaties.

(j) **Coordination with Section 7.** This section operates in parallel with the Acquisition Shield (Section 7):

- (i) Section 7 prohibits purchasing surveillance-equivalent data;
- (ii) this section requires warrants for compelled disclosure;
- (iii) together, they close both purchase and subpoena circumvention paths.

### Section 4-A. Regional Executive Transition Integrity

*Resolves Gap 167 — Lame Duck Sabotage (Transition Vulnerability). Mirrors Article II, Section 12 (Presidential Transition Integrity) for Regional Governors, preventing outgoing executives from abusing constitutional powers during the transition period.*

(a) **Transition Period Defined.** The "Transition Period" shall commence upon the earliest of:

- (1) The certification of a Regional gubernatorial election in which the incumbent Governor is not the winner;
- (2) The incumbent Governor's public announcement that they will not seek re-election, if occurring after primary elections conclude;
- (3) The Governor's term reaching its final ninety (90) days;
- (4) The certification of a successful recall petition against the Governor or the Governor's impeachment by the Regional legislature; or
- (5) A declaration by the Regional Election Board that the incumbent's loss is a statistical certainty, based on canvassed returns showing a margin exceeding one percent (1%) of votes cast.

The Transition Period concludes upon the inauguration of the successor.

(b) **Restricted Authority.** During the Transition Period, the Governor — and any person exercising gubernatorial powers, including a Lieutenant Governor, Acting Governor, or any successor who assumes office during the Transition Period — shall not, without the written concurrence of the Governor-Elect or a two-thirds vote of the Regional Legislature, take any of the following actions:

- (1) Refuse a lawful federalization order for the Regional Guard under Article XI-RF, Section 2;
- (2) Declare a new State of Emergency under Article XVII-RF, Section 1, or materially expand the scope or powers of an existing emergency declaration;
- (3) Withdraw from, terminate, or fail to renew any interstate compact or intergovernmental agreement that would otherwise continue by its terms;
- (4) Terminate, suspend, or appoint department heads, judges, independent officers, inspectors general, or any official whose term extends beyond the current gubernatorial term;
- (5) Execute contracts, settlements, or financial obligations exceeding ten thousand (10,000) Federal Penalty Units in aggregate value, or any contract or obligation extending more than ninety (90) days beyond inauguration regardless of amount. Related transactions shall be aggregated for purposes of this threshold;
- (6) Grant pardons, commutations, or reprieves to administration officials, family members within the third degree of consanguinity, persons under investigation for matters related to the Governor, political donors who contributed more than one hundred (100) FPU during the Governor's term, or the Governor themselves;
- (7) Promulgate new regulations or issue executive orders with prospective effect beyond the current term, unless required by existing statutory deadline or genuine emergency under subsection (d).

(c) **Duty of Continuity.** During the Transition Period, the Governor shall maintain the status quo ante regarding routine government operations, disaster response, and contractual obligations. Willful failure to renew routine contracts, respond to emergencies, or perform ministerial duties required by law — where such failure is designed to constrain the successor or create crisis — constitutes a violation of this section subject to the enforcement provisions of subsection (h).

(d) **Emergency Exception.** The restrictions of subsection (b) may be suspended for a specific action if:

- (1) The Governor certifies in writing that an imminent threat to public safety, Regional security, or critical infrastructure requires immediate action;
- (2) A three-judge panel of the Regional Supreme Court, convened within twenty-four (24) hours, concurs that the certified threat is genuine and the proposed action is reasonably necessary; and
- (3) The Governor-Elect and the presiding officer of the Regional Legislature are notified immediately upon certification.

Emergency authorization under this subsection expires after seventy-two (72) hours unless ratified by the Governor-Elect or by a two-thirds vote of the Regional Legislature. Actions taken under emergency authorization remain subject to Article XVII-RF, Section 2 anti-ratcheting provisions for any continuation or renewal.

(e) **Governor-Elect Response.** When the Governor requests written concurrence under subsection (b):

- (1) The request shall be transmitted simultaneously to the Governor-Elect and the presiding officer of the Regional Legislature through authenticated channels established by the Regional Election Board;
- (2) If the Governor-Elect does not respond within forty-eight (48) hours, the Governor may seek authorization through the two-thirds legislative vote alternative;
- (3) If both the Governor-Elect and the Regional Legislature fail to act within an additional seventy-two (72) hours, the Governor may petition the three-judge panel of the Regional Supreme Court under subsection (d) procedures.

(f) **Records Preservation.** During the Transition Period:

- (1) All official records generated during the Governor's term, including digital communications, shall be preserved and transferred to the Regional Archives or equivalent institution designated by Regional law;
- (2) The Governor and senior staff shall have no authority to destroy, delete, alter, or remove official records;
- (3) Destruction or alteration of records during the Transition Period shall be a felony punishable under Regional and federal law.

(g) **Transition Cooperation.** The outgoing Governor shall:

- (1) Provide the Governor-Elect with a written summary of all ongoing emergencies, Guard deployments, interstate compact obligations, pending contracts, and material litigation within seven (7) days of the commencement of the Transition Period;
- (2) Grant the Governor-Elect's transition team access to all Regional agency records, emergency plans, and Guard readiness reports;
- (3) Ensure orderly transfer of emergency communications systems, security protocols, and codes of access;
- (4) Personally meet with the Governor-Elect at least once before inauguration to discuss pending matters.

(h) **Anti-Circumvention.**

- (1) **Delegation.** Actions taken by subordinate officials or agencies at the direction of the Governor are attributable to the Governor for purposes of subsection (b). No official may execute a restricted action by claiming independent authority if the action was directed or encouraged by the Governor.
- (2) **Pre-Transition Positioning.** The incoming Governor may petition the Regional Supreme Court to void any action taken within sixty (60) days before the commencement of the Transition Period if the court finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that the action was primarily designed to circumvent the restrictions of this section or to constrain the successor's policy options.
- (3) **Aggregation.** For purposes of subsection (b)(5), contracts, obligations, and settlements that are related by subject matter, counterparty, or timing shall be aggregated. Division of a single transaction into multiple components to avoid the threshold constitutes a violation of this section.

(i) **Enforcement.**

- (1) **Void Ab Initio.** Any action taken in violation of subsection (b) is void from inception. No rights, obligations, or liabilities shall accrue from a void action.
- (2) **Standing.** The Governor-Elect, any member of the Regional Legislature, and the Regional Attorney General shall have standing to seek immediate injunctive relief and declaratory judgment in Regional or federal court.
- (3) **Criminal Penalties.** A Governor or other official who knowingly takes or facilitates an action in violation of this section shall be subject to criminal penalties of fifty (50) to five hundred (500) Federal Penalty Units and permanent disqualification from Regional and federal elected or appointed office.
- (4) **Ratification.** Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the incoming Governor may, within sixty (60) days of inauguration, ratify an action that would otherwise be void under this section if the Governor determines the action serves the public interest. Ratification does not immunize the prior official from criminal liability under paragraph (3).

---

### Section 5. Political Institutional Failure and Federal Receivership

(a) **Political Institutional Failure Defined.** A Region is in "Political Institutional Failure" when:

- (1) the Regional legislature has been unable to achieve quorum for more than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days;
- (2) no Regional Governor or acting Governor is able to exercise executive authority for more than ninety (90) consecutive days;
- (3) the Regional judiciary cannot seat sufficient judges to adjudicate cases for more than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days;
- (4) the Region has failed to conduct scheduled elections for more than twelve (12) months past the constitutional deadline; or
- (5) the Region has been unable to perform two or more "Minimum Institutional Capacity" functions under Article I, Schedule A(f) for more than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days.

(b) **Certification of Political Institutional Failure.** Political Institutional Failure shall be certified by:

- (1) joint declaration of the Chief Justice of the United States and the Comptroller General; or
- (2) concurrent resolution of both houses of Congress; or
- (3) petition of four of the remaining six Regional Governors, confirmed by the Supreme Court within thirty (30) days.

(c) **Federal Political Receivership.** Upon certification, the President shall appoint a Federal Political Receiver for the Region, subject to Senate confirmation within thirty (30) days (or deemed confirmed if the Senate fails to act):

- (1) The Receiver shall be a person of recognized competence in public administration who has not held partisan elected office within the preceding ten (10) years;
- (2) The Receiver shall exercise only those governmental powers necessary to restore functioning institutions;
- (3) The Receiver may not exercise policy discretion beyond maintaining existing Regional law and essential services.

(d) **Receiver Powers and Limitations.** The Federal Political Receiver may:

- (1) convene and preside over the Regional legislature for purposes of achieving quorum and conducting essential business;
- (2) appoint acting executive officials to maintain essential governmental functions;
- (3) appoint temporary judges to hear pending cases, subject to federal judicial qualifications;
- (4) order and administer emergency elections to fill vacant offices;
- (5) maintain existing Regional law and regulations without modification except for emergency measures.

The Receiver may NOT:

- (1) enact new substantive legislation or regulations;
- (2) modify Regional tax rates or fiscal policy beyond maintaining current operations;
- (3) enter into long-term contracts or obligations binding the Region beyond the receivership period;
- (4) modify the Regional constitution;
- (5) exercise any power not strictly necessary for institutional restoration.

(e) **Restoration Timeline.** The Receiver shall:

- (1) within sixty (60) days, submit a Restoration Plan to Congress identifying the causes of failure and proposed remedies;
- (2) within one hundred eighty (180) days, conduct emergency elections for all vacant elected offices;
- (3) within one (1) year, certify that functioning institutions have been restored or explain why extension is necessary.

(f) **Termination of Receivership.** Federal Political Receivership terminates upon:

- (1) certification by the Receiver that functioning institutions have been restored, confirmed by the Chief Justice;
- (2) expiration of two (2) years from initial certification, unless extended by Congress;
- (3) Congressional resolution terminating the receivership.

(g) **Anti-Abuse Provisions.** Federal Political Receivership may NOT be used:

- (1) to address policy disagreements between the Region and federal government;
- (2) to overturn lawful election results;
- (3) to impose federal policy preferences on Regional exclusive domains;
- (4) as punishment for Regional non-compliance with federal directives.

(h) **Judicial Review.** The certification of Political Institutional Failure and the actions of the Federal Political Receiver are subject to expedited judicial review by the Supreme Court, which shall hear challenges within thirty (30) days.

(i) **Costs.** The costs of Federal Political Receivership shall be:

- (1) initially borne by the federal government;
- (2) recoverable from the Region over ten (10) years following restoration, unless Congress waives recovery upon finding that the failure was caused by circumstances beyond Regional control.

#### Mandatory Path to Restoration

(j) **Restoration Benchmarks.** The Federal Political Receiver's authority is strictly limited to achieving "Restoration Benchmarks" defined by the Supreme Court at the time of certification. These shall include:

- (1) certification of valid voter rolls sufficient for elections;
- (2) seating of a quorum-capable Regional legislature;
- (3) appointment of a functioning Regional Supreme Court;
- (4) establishment of executive capacity to perform Minimum Institutional Capacity functions.
The Court shall apply consistent standards across receiverships, and precedent from prior receivership certifications shall be binding.

(k) **Non-Extension Presumption.** There is a rebuttable presumption against extending a receivership beyond two years. To obtain an extension:

- (1) the President must prove by clear and convincing evidence that "Active Sabotage" by local actors—not merely political instability or policy disagreement—makes restoration impossible;
- (2) Congress must approve the extension by a two-thirds vote of both Houses;
- (3) the Supreme Court must certify that the extension is consistent with constitutional principles and not pretextual.

(l) **Absolute Maximum Duration.** No Federal Political Receivership may exceed five (5) years total duration, regardless of circumstances. Upon reaching the five-year limit:

- (1) the receivership terminates automatically;
- (2) the most recent lawfully constituted Regional government is restored to authority;
- (3) if no such government exists, emergency elections shall be conducted under federal supervision within ninety (90) days, after which federal authority terminates.

(m) **Adversarial Restoration Review.** During the receivership, the Adversarial Review Office (ARO) shall:

- (1) issue quarterly reports on whether the Receiver is exceeding the "Minimum Necessary Power" standard;
- (2) have standing to petition for immediate termination if the Receiver engages in substantive policymaking beyond maintaining existing law;
- (3) monitor for "Mission Creep" where the Receiver attempts to resolve underlying political disagreements rather than institutional failures;
- (4) report directly to the Supreme Court and Congress, bypassing the Executive Branch.

(n) **Voter Re-Entry Trigger.** If the Receiver fails to conduct a certified election within eighteen (18) months:

- (1) the Region's residents may trigger a "Direct Restoration Referendum" by petition signed by five percent (5%) of registered voters from the most recent valid voter roll;
- (2) the referendum shall be administered by the Federal Election Commission, not the Receiver;
- (3) if the referendum passes by majority vote, the receivership terminates within sixty (60) days and the prior legal status quo is restored;
- (4) the Receiver may not campaign against or interfere with the referendum process.

### Section 6. Inter-Level Civil Service Mobility and Protection

**(a) Service Credit Portability.**

- (1) All years of public service at any level of government — federal, Regional, or State — shall count toward seniority, leave accrual, tenure eligibility, and retirement eligibility at every other level. Service credits shall transfer automatically upon inter-level appointment. Retirement eligibility credit shall operate through the pension portability mechanics of Article I, Section 8; this paragraph does not create pension obligations independent of that section. Tenure eligibility based on transferred service credits does not exempt the employee from any probationary evaluation or performance review required by the receiving level for newly appointed employees at equivalent grade.
- (2) The Independent Fiscal Council shall publish and maintain equivalence tables for grade, rank, step, and seniority across federal, Regional, and State civil service systems. No level of government may impose grade or step reductions upon an employee transferring from another level who held an equivalent position as determined by the IFC equivalence tables.
- (3) An employee transferring between levels shall not experience a gap in health, disability, or life insurance coverage exceeding thirty (30) calendar days. The receiving level shall provide interim coverage during any administrative processing period. The cost of interim coverage shall be borne by the receiving level.
- (4) Non-pension service credits — including accrued leave, sabbatical eligibility, professional development entitlements, and tenure-clock credit — shall transfer on the same basis as pension credits under Article I, Section 8. Upon transfer, the originating level shall remit to the receiving level the actuarial value of all transferred non-pension service credits, as calculated by the Independent Fiscal Council. The IFC shall publish standard actuarial tables for this purpose.

**(b) Inter-Level Transfer Rights.**

- (1) No level of government may penalize, retaliate against, or impose adverse employment consequences upon an employee for applying to, accepting, or performing service at another level of government.
- (2) An employee who transfers to another level of government shall have the right to return to the originating level within twenty-four (24) months with restored seniority, grade, and step. If no position at equivalent grade is immediately available, the originating level shall reinstate the employee in a supernumerary capacity at equivalent grade for up to twelve (12) months while a permanent position is identified. Simultaneous supernumerary positions at any single agency shall not exceed two percent (2%) of the agency's authorized permanent positions; employees whose return would exceed this cap shall be placed directly on a priority reemployment list. If no permanent position materializes within twelve (12) months, the employee shall be placed on a priority reemployment list with preference over external candidates at equivalent grade.
- (3) No level of government may impose non-compete clauses, mandatory waiting periods, or "cooling off" periods that restrict inter-level employment mobility.
- (4) No level of government may require, as a condition of employment or continued employment, any attestation, oath, or agreement — other than the constitutional oath of office — that would preclude the employee from simultaneously holding credentials for service at another level or from applying for positions at another level. This prohibition does not preclude role-specific conflict-of-interest restrictions for employees with active operational access to classified intelligence sources and methods, employees exercising judicial authority, or employees with active procurement contracting authority, provided that such restrictions are limited to the duration of the specific role assignment and do not extend to general inter-level mobility upon reassignment or departure from the role.

**(c) Security Clearance Reciprocity.**

- (1) Security clearances issued by one level of government shall be recognized at all other levels for access to information at the same or lower classification level, provided that the issuing level adjudicates clearances under standards no less stringent than the corresponding federal standard. A receiving agency may require supplemental briefing for program-specific access but may not require re-investigation or new adjudication based solely on the employee's level of government employment. Disputes regarding clearance-standard equivalence shall be resolved by the National Constitutional Court.
- (2) No security clearance may be revoked, suspended, or downgraded based on the employee's current or prior level of government employment, or on the employee's application for or acceptance of a position at another level.
- (3) Inter-level clearance transfer processing shall be completed within thirty (30) calendar days of the employee's transfer. If the receiving level has not completed processing within thirty (30) days, the employee shall be granted interim access at the previously cleared level pending completion, unless the receiving level has documented, specific, and articulable grounds to believe that granting access would pose an immediate risk to national security or the safety of intelligence sources and methods. In such cases, the receiving level shall file a sealed statement with the National Constitutional Court within five (5) business days, and the Court shall review the hold within fifteen (15) calendar days. If the Court does not sustain the hold within fifteen (15) days, interim access shall be granted automatically.
- (4) Classified information sharing agreements between levels of government shall not impose conditions that restrict inter-level employment mobility. Any such condition is void and unenforceable.

**(d) Anti-Poaching and Administrative Capacity Protection.**

- (1) The Independent Fiscal Council shall publish annual salary and total compensation benchmarks for equivalent positions across federal, Regional, and State civil service systems.
- (2) Targeted recruitment by one level of government of employees from another level's defined agency or functional area is presumptively an act of administrative warfare if, within any twelve (12) month period, the recruiting level extends formal written offers of employment to more than ten percent (10%) of the target agency's or functional area's career workforce, and the recruitment is concentrated rather than incidental. For purposes of this paragraph: "career workforce" means full-time, non-political-appointment employees who have completed probationary service; "concentrated" means that the offers are directed at employees within the same agency, bureau, division, or functional specialty rather than distributed across the target level's civil service generally; and "incidental" means resulting from routine, publicly posted vacancy announcements without targeted outreach to the specific agency or functional area.
- (3) The Allocation Review Board may investigate and adopt an "Administrative Warfare" finding where one level of government engages in a coordinated pattern of actions — including but not limited to targeted recruitment, clearance manipulation, funding conditions that require personnel restructuring, or regulatory actions targeting another level's employees — intended to or having the effect of materially degrading another level's administrative capacity.
- (4) The ARB shall adopt an Administrative Warfare finding by majority vote of its non-vacant members, provided that no fewer than three (3) members participate in the vote.
- (5) Upon an Administrative Warfare finding:
    - (i) the ARB shall order the offending level to cease the identified conduct;
    - (ii) the offending level shall compensate the affected level for documented recruitment and training costs incurred to replace lost personnel, calculated by the IFC;
    - (iii) officials who knowingly directed or authorized the coordinated campaign shall be personally liable for damages and subject to referral for disciplinary proceedings at their level; an official is not personally liable under this clause for routine, non-coordinated hiring decisions made in the ordinary course of filling vacancies;
    - (iv) the finding shall be published and reported to the relevant legislatures.
- (6) An Administrative Warfare finding is subject to expedited judicial review before the National Constitutional Court, limited to procedural regularity and whether the factual predicates of paragraphs (2) and (3) were satisfied. The Court shall render its decision within thirty (30) calendar days of the petition for review.

**(e) Intergovernmental Personnel Exchange.**

- (1) Congress shall establish by law a voluntary Intergovernmental Personnel Exchange Program enabling temporary details of career employees between federal, Regional, and State agencies. Exchange details shall not exceed three (3) years unless renewed by mutual agreement.
- (2) An employee on inter-level exchange shall retain home-level benefits, seniority accrual, retirement contributions, and all protections of this section. The exchange employee shall be subject to the workplace rules and supervision of the host agency for operational purposes.
- (3) Exchange service shall count toward career advancement, professional development requirements, and tenure at the home level on the same basis as home-level service.
- (4) In a declared emergency under Article XVII or equivalent Regional/State authority, any level of government may request personnel assistance from other levels. Responding employees retain all protections of this section and shall not be deemed to have transferred for purposes of subsection (b)(2).

**(f) Coordination.**

- (1) This section supplements the merit system protections of Article II, Section 11. Where both sections apply to the same employee, the more protective provision governs.
- (2) The pension and benefit portability provisions of Article I, Section 8 apply independently of this section. This section extends portability to non-pension service credits not covered by Article I, Section 8.
- (3) The professional licensing protections of Article I, Sections 9 and 14 apply independently of this section. This section extends reciprocity to security clearances, which are not covered by Article I, Sections 9 or 14.
- (4) No provision of this section shall be construed to override the political appointment ceiling of Article II, Section 11(b) at the federal level. Regional and State governments shall establish by their constitutions or by law a ceiling on political appointments that ensures a merit-protected career civil service. The maximum ratio of political appointments to total civilian government positions at each Regional or State level shall not exceed the ratio that Article II, Section 11(b) establishes at the federal level, as calculated by the Independent Fiscal Council based on the federal ceiling and total federal civilian workforce. Regions and States may structure their political appointments differently from the federal model provided they meet this minimum merit-protection floor.

## ARTICLE VI - FOREIGN AFFAIRS AND REGIONAL LIMITATIONS

### Section 4. The One Voice Doctrine

*Integrated from Gap 266 -- establishes federal exclusivity over all foreign relations including non-treaty instruments.*

(a) **Exclusive Federal Authority.** The conduct of foreign relations is the exclusive domain of the Federal Government. No Region, State, local government, or instrumentality thereof may:

- (i) enter into any treaty, alliance, or confederation with a foreign power;
- (ii) enter into any agreement, compact, memorandum of understanding, framework, or arrangement with a foreign government, foreign government entity, foreign state-owned enterprise, or foreign political subdivision that:
    - contradicts established Federal foreign policy;
    - undermines Federal diplomatic objectives;
    - interferes with Federal sanctions, embargoes, or trade restrictions;
    - creates commitments regarding matters within Federal foreign affairs authority;
    - provides foreign powers access to information, facilities, or relationships that could compromise national security.

(b) **Void Ab Initio.** Any agreement entered into in violation of subsection (a) is void from the beginning and of no legal effect. No Regional official may implement, honor, or give effect to such an agreement.

(c) **Permitted Activities.** This section does not prohibit:

- (i) purely commercial transactions between Regional entities and foreign private parties;
- (ii) academic exchanges with foreign universities that do not involve government commitments;
- (iii) cultural activities that do not create governmental obligations;
- (iv) tourism promotion not involving diplomatic representations;
- (v) technical cooperation on non-sensitive matters with federal notification.

(d) **Federal Notification and Review.**

- (i) Before any Regional entity enters into any arrangement with a foreign government or government-connected entity, it shall notify the Department of State.
- (ii) The Department of State shall have thirty (30) days to review and object.
- (iii) If the Department objects, the arrangement shall not proceed unless the objection is overruled by the Constitutional Court.
- (iv) Failure to notify renders any subsequent agreement presumptively void.

(e) **Designation of Prohibited Partners.** The Federal Government may designate foreign entities with which Regional arrangements are categorically prohibited, including:

- (i) governments of sanctioned countries;
- (ii) foreign intelligence services and their front organizations;
- (iii) foreign state-owned enterprises in sensitive sectors;
- (iv) political parties of adversary nations.

(e-1) **Regional Official Financial Interest Prohibition.** *Resolves Gap 172 — Trojan Horse Infrastructure (Foreign Influence Through Regional Assets).* No Regional official exercising authority over infrastructure, procurement, or regulatory matters may:

- (i) hold financial interests in entities owned or controlled by Prohibited Partners designated under subsection (e);
- (ii) receive compensation, gifts, or benefits from foreign state-owned enterprises without prior federal approval;
- (iii) accept employment or consulting arrangements with Prohibited Partner entities within five (5) years of leaving office.

Violation constitutes grounds for removal from office and personal liability under subsection (f).

(f) **Enforcement.**

- (i) The Attorney General may seek injunctive relief against prohibited arrangements.
- (ii) Regional officials who enter into or implement prohibited arrangements are personally liable for damages to federal foreign policy interests.
- (iii) Federal courts shall have jurisdiction to void prohibited arrangements and order cessation of implementation.

(g) **Existing Arrangements.** Within one year of ratification:

- (i) all existing Regional arrangements with foreign entities shall be submitted to the Department of State for review;
- (ii) arrangements found to conflict with this section shall be terminated;
- (iii) failure to submit shall render existing arrangements void.

## Design Rationale

### Why Transform the Senate?

The current Senate:

- gives 40 million Californians the same voice as 600,000 Wyomingites
- routinely blocks legislation supported by House majorities
- creates a veto point exploitable by determined minorities
- enables minority rule through the filibuster

The transformed Senate:

- represents Regions, not arbitrary historical boundaries
- focuses on constitutional matters (treaties, judges, amendments, disputes)
- cannot veto ordinary legislation
- retains review power only for interregional coordination matters
- may optionally require concurrence for safeguard legislation (see Section 4-A proposal)

### Why "Silence Equals Consent" for Confirmations?

The confirmation blockade exploits a gap in the original Constitution: "advice and consent" was understood to require action, but no mechanism forces the Senate to act. Strategic inaction became a weapon — the Senate could block nominees indefinitely without taking a recorded vote, avoiding political accountability. The Regional Federal system amplifies this risk because more constitutionally empowered offices require confirmation (ARB, IFC, Regional Guard commanders), and vacancy in these offices degrades constitutional functions rather than merely statutory ones.

The "deemed confirmed" mechanism does not remove the Senate's power to reject. It removes only the power to do nothing. Senators must vote no or accept the nominee. The 180-day removal safety valve (matching Article XIV §13(c)(3)) provides a further backstop: if the Senate believes a deemed-confirmed officer is unfit, it can organize a two-thirds vote to remove within six months.

### Why Self-Executing Deadlines Rather Than Officer-Triggered?

The proposed text avoids relying on any specific officer (Parliamentarian, Chief Justice, presiding officer) to schedule the mandatory vote. Instead, the vote becomes "the first order of business on the next day the Senate is in session" by operation of law. This prevents gaming where the triggering officer is pressured not to act, and is consistent with the pattern in Article IV §5-A (Deliberation Mandate), which uses similar self-executing language ("No procedural mechanism may prevent").

### Why Limit Presidential Domestic Authority?

Under traditional federalism, presidents increasingly govern by executive order in domestic policy. This Constitution:

- limits presidential authority to enumerated federal powers
- prevents executive overreach into Regional/State domains
- preserves the President's core functions (foreign affairs, federal law execution, rights enforcement)
- creates clear boundaries for judicial enforcement

### Regional Governance Flexibility

This Constitution does not prescribe Regional government structures. Each Region may:

- choose unicameral or bicameral legislature
- select its own electoral systems
- design its executive structure (single governor, plural executive, parliamentary)
- establish its own court system

The only requirements are:

- republican form of government
- consistency with federal and Regional constitutional requirements
- democratic process guarantees (universal suffrage, independent redistricting, proportionality standards)
