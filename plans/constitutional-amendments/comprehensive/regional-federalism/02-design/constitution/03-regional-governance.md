## ARTICLE IV - THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH

### Section 1. Congress

Congress shall remain bicameral, consisting of a House of Representatives and a Senate.

---

### Section 2. The House of Representatives

The House shall be elected by the People according to population and shall initiate national legislation within enumerated federal powers.

---

### Section 3. The Senate

The Senate shall represent the Regions equally.

Each Region shall select Senators according to Regional law.

---

### Section 4. Senate Powers

The Senate's powers are limited to:

- ratification of treaties,
- confirmation of judicial and constitutional officers,
- participation in constitutional amendments,
- adjudication of intergovernmental disputes.

The Senate shall not function as a routine legislative veto.

---

### Section 5. Federal Lawmaking

(a) Bills within enumerated federal powers may be introduced in the House of Representatives.

(b) Upon passage by the House, bills shall be presented to the President for signature.

(c) The President may sign or veto the bill. A presidential veto may be overridden by a two-thirds vote of the House of Representatives.

(d) The Senate shall not have veto power over ordinary legislation. Senate concurrence is required only for matters specified in Section 4.

(e) Senate Review of Interregional Coordination Matters. For bills meeting the criteria in subsection (f), the Senate may delay presentation to the President by up to sixty days to propose amendments. Failure to act within sixty days results in automatic presentation to the President.

(f) Interregional Coordination Criteria. A bill is subject to Senate review under subsection (e) only if it:

(1) directly regulates the allocation of shared natural resources among Regions,

(2) establishes or modifies equalization transfer formulas,

(3) creates federal mandates requiring Regional implementation, or

(4) modifies Regional boundary revision procedures.

(g) Determination of Applicability. Whether a bill meets the criteria in subsection (f) shall be determined as follows:

(1) The Speaker of the House shall certify whether each bill meets the criteria upon passage.

(2) The Senate may challenge the Speaker's certification by a vote of three-fifths of Senators.

(3) If challenged, the Parliamentarian of the House shall issue a binding determination within five days.

(4) The Parliamentarian's determination may be appealed to the Allocation Review Board, which shall rule within ten days.

(h) No body may expand the categories in subsection (f) except by constitutional amendment.

(i) The Senate may propose amendments to bills subject to its review. If the House accepts Senate amendments, the bill proceeds to the President. If the House rejects Senate amendments, the original House bill proceeds to the President after the sixty-day period expires.

## ARTICLE V - THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH

### Section 1. The Presidency

The President remains the Chief Executive and Commander-in-Chief of the Federal Armed Forces.

---

### Section 2. Scope of Executive Authority

The President shall:

- execute federal law,
- conduct foreign affairs,
- enforce constitutional floors.

The President shall not exercise general domestic governance over Regional or State domains.

---

## Design Rationale

### Why Transform the Senate?

The current Senate:

- gives 40 million Californians the same voice as 600,000 Wyomingites
- routinely blocks legislation supported by House majorities
- creates a veto point exploitable by determined minorities
- enables minority rule through the filibuster

The transformed Senate:

- represents Regions, not arbitrary historical boundaries
- focuses on constitutional matters (treaties, judges, amendments, disputes)
- cannot veto ordinary legislation
- retains review power only for interregional coordination matters

### Why Limit Presidential Domestic Authority?

Under traditional federalism, presidents increasingly govern by executive order in domestic policy. This Constitution:

- limits presidential authority to enumerated federal powers
- prevents executive overreach into Regional/State domains
- preserves the President's core functions (foreign affairs, federal law execution, rights enforcement)
- creates clear boundaries for judicial enforcement

### Regional Governance Flexibility

This Constitution does not prescribe Regional government structures. Each Region may:

- choose unicameral or bicameral legislature
- select its own electoral systems
- design its executive structure (single governor, plural executive, parliamentary)
- establish its own court system

The only requirements are:

- republican form of government
- consistency with federal and Regional constitutional requirements
- democratic process guarantees (universal suffrage, independent redistricting, proportionality standards)
