*This document contains the regional-specific governance provisions of the Regional Federal Constitution. For standalone federal governance reforms, see the companion plans:*

- *[Executive Reform](../single-topic/executive-reform.md) - Generic federal executive reforms*

## ARTICLE IV - THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH

### Section 1. Congress

Congress shall remain bicameral, consisting of a House of Representatives and a Senate.

---

### Section 2. The House of Representatives

The House shall be elected by the People according to population and shall initiate national legislation within enumerated federal powers.

---

### Section 3. The Senate

(a) The Senate shall represent the Regions equally.

(b) Each Region shall be represented by three Senators, elected at-large within the Region by ranked-choice voting for staggered six-year terms.

(c) The total membership of the Senate shall be three times the number of Regions, plus any at-large members serving under subsection (d).

(d) Each Region shall select Senators according to Regional law, provided such law provides for direct popular election.

(e) **Transitional Exception.** Senators representing the District of Columbia and United States territories prior to Regional assignment serve as at-large members with full voting rights pursuant to Article XX, Sections 1(b) and 2(b). Upon Regional assignment, such Senators join the assigned Region's delegation.

---

### Section 4. Senate Powers

The Senate's powers are limited to:

- ratification of treaties,
- confirmation of judicial and constitutional officers,
- participation in constitutional amendments,
- adjudication of intergovernmental disputes.

The Senate shall not function as a routine legislative veto.

**Adjudication Procedures.** When adjudicating intergovernmental disputes:

- (a) The Senate shall establish standing rules for dispute adjudication, including discovery procedures, hearing requirements, and decision standards.
- (b) Disputes must be resolved within 180 days of filing unless all parties consent to extension.
- (c) Senate adjudication is limited to disputes between Regions, or between Regions and the federal government, regarding interpretation of this Constitution or federal law.
- (d) The Senate may not adjudicate disputes involving individual rights (which belong to the courts) or disputes already pending in the Allocation Review Board or federal courts.
- (e) Senate adjudication decisions may be appealed to the Supreme Court on questions of constitutional interpretation within 60 days.

**Conflict of Interest Provisions.** To ensure impartial adjudication:

- (f) **Mandatory Recusal.** Senators from any Region that is a party to a dispute shall be recused from voting on the adjudication. If both parties are Regions, Senators from both Regions are recused.
- (g) **Quorum with Recusals.** When Senators are recused under subsection (f):
    - (1) The quorum for adjudication shall be a majority of non-recused Senators;
    - (2) Decisions require a majority of non-recused Senators voting;
    - (3) If recusals reduce participating Senators below eight, the dispute shall be transferred to the Supreme Court for original jurisdiction.
- (h) **Anti-Bloc Voting Safeguards.**
    - (1) No adjudication may proceed if Senators from three or fewer Regions would constitute a majority of voting Senators;
    - (2) If a pattern emerges where the same Regional coalition decides three consecutive disputes against the same Region or group of Regions, any affected Region may demand transfer to the Supreme Court;
    - (3) The Chief Justice shall review Senate adjudication patterns annually and may certify "systematic regional bias" if statistical analysis demonstrates non-random voting patterns correlated with Regional identity rather than legal merit. Such certification triggers automatic Supreme Court review of pending and future disputes for two years.
- (i) **Independent Adjudication Panel Option.** For disputes involving allegations of Regional discrimination or systematic bias:
    - (1) Any party may request adjudication by an Independent Panel instead of the full Senate;
    - (2) The Panel shall consist of the Chief Justice (presiding), two retired federal appellate judges selected by lot, and two Senators selected by lot from non-party Regions;
    - (3) Panel decisions have the same force as Senate adjudication and are appealable under the same terms.

### Section 4-A. Senate Concurrence for Constitutional Safeguards (Proposed)

> **Note:** This section is a proposed optional enhancement. See the [Senate Safeguard Concurrence Amendment](../../proposals/01-foundations/senate-safeguard-concurrence-act.md) for full text and analysis.

Senate concurrence by majority vote may be required for legislation affecting constitutional safeguards, including emergency powers, domestic armed force deployment, election administration, judicial structure, de-escalation procedures, and allocation of powers.

If adopted, this section would create targeted Senate involvement in safeguard legislation while preserving House majority rule for ordinary policy.

---

### Section 5. Federal Lawmaking

(a) Bills within enumerated federal powers may be introduced in the House of Representatives.

(b) Upon passage by the House, bills shall be presented to the President for signature.

(c) The President may sign or veto the bill. A presidential veto may be overridden by a two-thirds vote of the House of Representatives.

(d) The Senate shall not have veto power over ordinary legislation. Senate concurrence is required only for matters specified in Section 4.

(e) Senate Review of Interregional Coordination Matters. For bills affecting interregional coordination (shared natural resources, equalization formulas, Regional mandates, boundary procedures), the Senate may delay presentation to the President to propose amendments, but cannot permanently block legislation.

- (1) The Senate must complete review within 60 days of receiving a bill from the House. If no action is taken within 60 days, the bill shall be automatically presented to the President.
- (2) If the Senate proposes amendments, the House may accept, reject, or modify them within 30 days. The House's final action is conclusive.
- (3) The Senate may invoke review by majority vote within 10 days of House passage. Failure to invoke review waives the delay authority.
- (4) During Senate review, the bill's sponsors in the House may request expedited review (30 days) upon showing urgent circumstances.

(f) The categories triggering Senate review may not be expanded except by constitutional amendment.

(g) Implementation procedures are established by statute. See the [Interregional Coordination Legislative Review Act](../../proposals/01-foundations/interregional-coordination-review-act.md) for the proposed implementing legislation.

## ARTICLE V - THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH

### Section 1. The Presidency

The President remains the Chief Executive and Commander-in-Chief of the Federal Armed Forces.

---

### Section 2. Scope of Executive Authority

The President shall:

- execute federal law,
- conduct foreign affairs,
- enforce constitutional floors.

The President shall not exercise general domestic governance over Regional or State domains.

---

## Design Rationale

### Why Transform the Senate?

The current Senate:

- gives 40 million Californians the same voice as 600,000 Wyomingites
- routinely blocks legislation supported by House majorities
- creates a veto point exploitable by determined minorities
- enables minority rule through the filibuster

The transformed Senate:

- represents Regions, not arbitrary historical boundaries
- focuses on constitutional matters (treaties, judges, amendments, disputes)
- cannot veto ordinary legislation
- retains review power only for interregional coordination matters
- may optionally require concurrence for safeguard legislation (see Section 4-A proposal)

### Why Limit Presidential Domestic Authority?

Under traditional federalism, presidents increasingly govern by executive order in domestic policy. This Constitution:

- limits presidential authority to enumerated federal powers
- prevents executive overreach into Regional/State domains
- preserves the President's core functions (foreign affairs, federal law execution, rights enforcement)
- creates clear boundaries for judicial enforcement

### Regional Governance Flexibility

This Constitution does not prescribe Regional government structures. Each Region may:

- choose unicameral or bicameral legislature
- select its own electoral systems
- design its executive structure (single governor, plural executive, parliamentary)
- establish its own court system

The only requirements are:

- republican form of government
- consistency with federal and Regional constitutional requirements
- democratic process guarantees (universal suffrage, independent redistricting, proportionality standards)
