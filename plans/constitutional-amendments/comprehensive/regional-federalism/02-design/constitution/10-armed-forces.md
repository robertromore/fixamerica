# Regional Guard Forces

## Regional Federalism Supplement to Armed Forces Reform

*This document contains ONLY the region-dependent provisions for armed forces under Regional Federalism. For the complete armed forces and civilian control reform, see the [Military Civilian Control Amendment](../single-topic/military-civilian-control.md).*

---

## Compatibility Clause

This article presumes adoption of the [Military Civilian Control Amendment](../single-topic/military-civilian-control.md) or an equivalent provision establishing:

- civilian supremacy over armed forces
- two-key authorization for domestic deployment
- duty to refuse unlawful orders
- prohibited uses of armed forces
- transparency and accountability requirements
- counter-key authority for emergency suspension
- judicial key override for executive defiance of Supreme Court orders
- digital force equivalence (cyber-kinetic operations require two-key authorization)
- infrastructure independence guarantees
- state defense force limitations (personnel caps, prohibited capabilities)
- congressional key override for two-key collusion
- officer corps independence protections (loyalty prohibition, mass removal trigger, pardon limitation)

If the Military Civilian Control Amendment is adopted alongside Regional Federalism:

- Substitute "Regional Governors" for "State Governors" in Key 2 authorization throughout that amendment
- The Judicial Key Override (Section 10) uses "five of seven Regional Governors" rather than "majority of State Governors"
- Infrastructure Independence guarantees (Section 12) apply to Regions rather than States
- State Defense Force limits (Section 13) apply to forces within constituent States, not Regional Guard
- Congressional Key Override (Section 14) uses Regional Governors for certification and bypass
- Counter-Deployment Authority (Section 15(e)) authorizes Regional Guard activation

## ARTICLE XI-RF - REGIONAL GUARD FORCES

### Section 1. Establishment of Regional Guard Forces

(a) Each Region may maintain Regional Guard Forces for:

- disaster response within the Region,
- support of civil authorities at Regional Governor request,
- defense of Regional territory in coordination with federal forces.

(b) Regional Guard Forces are under the command of the Regional Governor except when called into federal service.

*Resolves Gap 192 — Paramilitary Loophole (Shadow Army). Closes the unfederalizable Regional force vulnerability by classifying all Regional-level armed forces as Regional Guard.*

(c) **Regional Force Classification.** Any organized armed force maintained by a Regional government, other than civilian law enforcement agencies operating within normal police powers, shall be classified as Regional Guard Forces and subject to federalization under Section 2. No Region may establish or maintain military or paramilitary forces exempt from federal call-up authority. The non-federalization exemption under Section 3(d) applies only to State Defense Forces maintained by individual State governments within the limits established by the Military Civilian Control Amendment.

---

### Section 2. Federalization of Regional Guard

(a) Regional Guard Forces may be called into federal service:

- upon declaration of war by Congress,
- upon authorization for use of military force approved by two-thirds of the House and Senate,
- for domestic deployment pursuant to two-key authorization (as defined by the Military Civilian Control Amendment if adopted, or by subsection (g) of this section).

(b) When called into federal service, Regional Guard units are commanded by the President through the chain of command, except during Congressional Key Override as provided in subsection (m).

(c) Federalization for domestic purposes may not exceed ninety days without consent of the affected Region's Governor.

(d) A Regional Governor may refuse federalization of that Region's Guard Forces if:

- no two-key authorization has been obtained, or
- the federalization order directs action against that Governor's own Region.

(e) If the Regional Governor position is vacant or if the Governor has been removed by federal action, the refusal authority under subsection (d) shall be exercised by the acting Governor under Regional succession law, or if none, by the presiding officer of the Regional legislature.

(f) Federalization of a Region's Guard is prohibited for 180 days following removal of that Region's Governor by federal action, unless:

- (1) approved by two-thirds of the Regional legislature, or
- (2) approved by a majority of all other Regional Governors, or
- (3) authorized by the Supreme Court upon finding genuine emergency unrelated to the removal.

(g) **Default Two-Key Authorization.** If the Military Civilian Control Amendment is not adopted, "two-key authorization" for purposes of this article means authorization for domestic deployment of armed forces that requires approval from both:

- (1) **Key 1:** The President (or, if the President is unavailable or incapacitated, the next civilian in the line of succession), and
- (2) **Key 2:** A majority of Regional Governors, or if deployment is limited to a single Region, the Governor of that Region.

Two-key authorization may not be waived, delegated to military officers, or satisfied by implied consent. Deployment without two-key authorization is unlawful and may be refused by commanders without penalty.

(h) **Emergency Response Acceleration.** Notwithstanding subsection (g), the following expedited procedures apply to time-sensitive emergencies:

- (1) **Automatic Approval for Infrastructure Attacks.** When the President certifies that a cyber-physical attack on critical infrastructure (energy grid, water systems, communications networks, transportation systems) requires immediate military response, Regional Governors shall have forty-eight (48) hours to respond to a two-key authorization request. Failure to respond within forty-eight hours shall be deemed consent for the specific deployment requested, limited to defending the affected infrastructure.

- (2) **Supermajority Override.** If five of seven Regional Governors affirmatively authorize deployment, the authorization is valid even if the remaining Governors actively refuse, provided the deployment does not target the refusing Governors' Regions.

- (3) **Judicial Emergency Key.** If a majority of Regional Governors cannot be reached or fail to respond within forty-eight hours during a verified emergency, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court may, upon petition by the President and certification by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that delay poses imminent risk of mass casualties, authorize deployment for up to seventy-two (72) hours pending Governor response. This judicial authorization:
    - (i) requires the Chief Justice to find clear and convincing evidence of imminent threat;
    - (ii) may not be used for any deployment targeting domestic political activity, protests, or civil disturbances;
    - (iii) automatically terminates after seventy-two hours unless Governor majority consent is obtained;
    - (iv) shall be reported to Congress within twenty-four hours.

- (4) **Anti-Brinkmanship Provision.** A Regional Governor who withholds two-key consent while simultaneously demanding unrelated policy concessions from the President shall be deemed to have waived the consent requirement for that authorization request. The Allocation Review Board shall determine whether such conditioning has occurred, with expedited seventy-two-hour review.

#### Constitutional Compliance Enforcement

(i) **Constitutional Compliance Enforcement Exception.** Notwithstanding subsection (d), a Regional Governor may not invoke the refusal authority to shield the Region from enforcement of:

- (1) final, non-appealable rulings of the Allocation Review Board;
- (2) final, non-appealable rulings of the Supreme Court;
- (3) federal court orders enforcing constitutional provisions of this Constitution.

(j) **Alternative Enforcement Mechanisms.** When Guard federalization is unavailable or refused under subsection (d), the federal government retains authority to enforce constitutional compliance through:

- (1) fiscal measures authorized under Article X, including withholding of federal transfers and equalization payments;
- (2) federal marshals and civilian law enforcement agencies;
- (3) assumption of operational control over specific infrastructure under Article I, Section 6(o);
- (4) judicial contempt proceedings against responsible officials, including personal fines and incarceration;
- (5) disqualification of non-compliant Regional officials from future federal office.

(k) **Escalation Ladder.** Before any enforcement action under subsection (j), the federal government shall:

- (1) provide written notice specifying the violation and required remediation;
- (2) allow thirty (30) days for voluntary compliance;
- (3) offer mediation through the ARB;
- (4) obtain judicial certification that non-compliance is willful.

(l) **Anti-Militarization Principle.** The limitations on Guard federalization in subsection (d) reflect the constitutional preference for civilian, fiscal, and judicial enforcement mechanisms over military force in resolving intergovernmental disputes. Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize military action against civilian populations.

#### Congressional Key Override Operations

*Resolves Gap 82 — Double-Key Hostage-Taking (Collusion for Inaction). These provisions supplement the Congressional Key Override (Article XI, Section 14) with operational details that depend on Regional Federalism institutions. The standalone Section 14 provides the override authority, vote thresholds, scope, independent certification, governor bypass, and anti-collusion prohibition. The following subsections address command authority, certification standards, certification effect, geographic scope, and post-incident review.*

(m) **Command Authority During Congressional Key Override.** When Congress activates the override authority under Article XI, Section 14:

- (1) The Secretary of Defense exercises operational command of all federalized forces, including Regional Guard units called into federal service;
- (2) The President retains titular Commander-in-Chief status but may not countermand Congress-authorized operations;
- (3) Command reverts to the President upon termination of the Congressional override.

(n) **Insurrection Certification Standards.** For purposes of independent insurrection certification under Article XI, Section 14(d):

- (1) Certification requires a binding finding that all three conditions are met:
    - (i) armed groups exercise territorial control within the United Regions;
    - (ii) civil law enforcement, including State and Regional law enforcement, has proven insufficient to restore order; and
    - (iii) constitutional governance faces an imminent threat that military force alone can address.
- (2) Where Article XI, Section 14(d)(2) refers to "Circuit Chief Judges," the Regional Federalism equivalent shall be the Chief Justices of the Regional Supreme Courts or, if Regional Supreme Courts have not been established, the chief judges of the federal circuit courts encompassing the affected Region.
- (3) Certification under this subsection is judicially reviewable only after the operational period ends.

(o) **Certification Effect on Presidential Action.** Upon independent insurrection certification under subsection (n):

- (1) The President shall request two-key authorization or invoke the insurrection exception under Article XI, Section 3 within twenty-four (24) hours;
- (2) Failure to act within twenty-four hours:
    - (i) reduces the Congressional override threshold to two-thirds of the House and simple majority of the Senate, as provided in Article XI, Section 14(d);
    - (ii) constitutes prima facie evidence of dereliction of duty in any subsequent impeachment proceeding, but does not automatically constitute grounds for impeachment.
- (3) The President may satisfy the twenty-four-hour deadline by providing written justification for declining to act, which shall be transmitted to Congress and published immediately.

(p) **Post-Certification Regional Bypass Scope.** When a Regional Governor provides individual consent for operations under Article XI, Section 14(e):

- (1) Operations are limited to the consenting Governor's Region and areas of direct threat spillover;
- (2) Operations may not extend to non-affected Regions without those Regions' Governor consent or Congressional authorization;
- (3) The geographic scope determination shall be made by the Secretary of Defense, subject to judicial review.

(q) **Post-Incident Review.** Following any deployment authorized through Congressional key override under Article XI, Section 14:

- (1) Any member of Congress, any Regional Governor, or any affected party with standing may petition the Constitutional Court to review:
    - (i) whether the certification of insurrection was factually supported;
    - (ii) whether key-holder refusals were justified;
    - (iii) whether the scope of military operations exceeded the certified threat.
- (2) The Constitutional Court shall accept or decline the petition within thirty (30) days.
- (3) Findings of unjustified refusal may be used as evidence in subsequent impeachment or recall proceedings.
- (4) No review under this subsection may retroactively invalidate lawful military orders issued during the operational period.

### Section 3. Integration with State National Guard

(a) State National Guard units continue in existence within the Regional structure.

(b) State National Guard units may be placed under Regional command by agreement between the State and Regional governments.

(c) The Governor of each State retains authority over State National Guard units for State emergencies unless such units have been federalized or placed under Regional command.

(d) State Defense Forces under exclusive State control may be maintained and are not subject to federalization.

(e) Coordination Requirements. State National Guard and Regional Guard Forces shall maintain:

- (1) interoperable communications and command systems,
- (2) joint training exercises at least annually,
- (3) mutual aid agreements specifying support protocols,
- (4) clear precedence rules when operating in same theater.

(f) During concurrent operations, the senior Regional Guard commander shall coordinate overall response unless the emergency is confined to a single State and the Regional Governor has not declared a Regional emergency.

(g) Nothing in this section shall be construed to subordinate State National Guard units to Regional command without agreement under subsection (b), except during federalization or declared Regional emergency requiring unified command.

*Resolves Gap 192 — Paramilitary Loophole (Shadow Army). Ensures the cap-and-reclassify framework in the Military Civilian Control Amendment, Section 13(d) has proactive detection rather than relying on reactive discovery.*

(h) **Subnational Force Registry and Inspection.** The Department of Defense shall:

- (1) maintain a comprehensive registry of all Regional Guard Forces, State National Guard units, and State Defense Forces;
- (2) conduct annual inspections of all registered forces to verify compliance with personnel caps, capability prohibitions, and authorized roles established by this article and the Military Civilian Control Amendment;
- (3) report findings to Congress, the affected Regional Governor, and the Constitutional Court;
- (4) certify annually whether each State Defense Force remains within the limits that preserve its non-federalization exemption under Section 3(d).

Failure to register or refusal to submit to inspection shall constitute prima facie evidence that the force exceeds authorized limits, triggering reclassification review under the Military Civilian Control Amendment, Section 13(d) for State forces, or immediate classification as Regional Guard under Section 1(c) for Regional forces.

---

### Section 4. Monopoly on Force

*Resolves Gap 235 — Privatized War / PMC Prohibition. Closes the mercenary bypass by prohibiting private military contractors from performing inherently governmental functions involving force.*

(a) **Inherently Governmental Function.** The exercise of the following powers is an Inherently Governmental Function that may only be performed by sworn officers of the United Regions:

- (1) combat operations, offensive military action, and armed conflict engagement;
- (2) detention, arrest, and imprisonment of persons;
- (3) interrogation of prisoners or detainees;
- (4) law enforcement requiring the use or threat of force;
- (5) intelligence operations involving coercion, violence, or surveillance of U.S. persons;
- (6) security operations requiring authority to use lethal force.

(b) **Private Military Contractor Prohibition.** The Federal Government, Regional Governments, and all agencies and instrumentalities thereof may not:

- (1) employ private military contractors for combat, combat support, or security operations requiring lethal force authority;
- (2) fund, directly or indirectly, private military operations by U.S. or foreign entities;
- (3) grant immunity, indemnification, or legal protection to private military actors;
- (4) classify PMC contracts or expenditures to evade congressional oversight;
- (5) permit PMC personnel to operate under U.S. command or in conjunction with U.S. forces.

(c) **Limited Contractor Authorization.** Private contractors may provide:

- (1) logistics, maintenance, and supply chain services;
- (2) training and education in non-combat settings;
- (3) technical expertise for weapons systems;
- (4) administrative and clerical support.

Contractors providing such services may not carry weapons, exercise detention authority, or participate in combat operations.

(d) **UCMJ Extension.** Any person performing security or military-adjacent functions under U.S. government contract is subject to:

- (1) the Uniform Code of Military Justice;
- (2) prosecution for war crimes under federal law;
- (3) court-martial jurisdiction for offenses committed in conflict zones.

(e) **Foreign Operations.** U.S. persons may not:

- (1) serve in foreign private military organizations;
- (2) provide military training or services to foreign governments without State Department license;
- (3) participate in combat operations for any entity other than the United Regions armed forces.

Violation constitutes a criminal offense punishable upon final conviction by loss of citizenship pursuant to Article III, Section 5(c)(3), and permanent ineligibility for any government employment or contract.

(f) **Regional PMC Prohibition.** Regional and State governments may not:

- (1) hire private military or armed security contractors;
- (2) authorize private entities to exercise law enforcement powers;
- (3) fund paramilitary organizations through grants, contracts, or tax benefits;
- (4) grant official status, affiliation, rank, or auxiliary designation to private militia or paramilitary organizations, or integrate such organizations into any governmental armed force.

(g) **Transparency.** All contracts for security services, military training, or defense-related functions:

- (1) shall be reported to Congress within 30 days;
- (2) may not be classified solely to conceal their existence;
- (3) shall include total cost, personnel count, and authorized activities;
- (4) shall be publicly disclosed in unclassified summary form.

(h) **Enforcement.** Violation of this section:

- (1) renders any PMC contract void and unenforceable;
- (2) creates personal liability for officials authorizing prohibited contracts;
- (3) subjects violators to prosecution for illegal warfare;
- (4) authorizes Congress to terminate any covert action discovered to involve PMC combat operations.

## Design Rationale

### Why Regional Guard Forces?

Regional Guard Forces provide:

- Additional capacity for regional disasters beyond what states can individually provide
- Regional-level military force under Regional civilian control
- Counterbalance to federal military power
- Career opportunities for military personnel preferring Regional service

Regional Guards are distinct from State National Guard units, providing an intermediate tier of military capacity.

### Why Preserve State National Guard?

The three-tier structure (Federal, Regional, State) provides:

- Redundancy and resilience
- Multiple chains of command
- Protection against concentration of military power
- Flexibility for different emergency scales

### Relationship to Military Civilian Control Amendment

The core reforms (two-key authorization, duty to refuse, prohibited uses, transparency) are in the standalone [Military Civilian Control Amendment](../single-topic/military-civilian-control.md). That amendment works with either:

- **State-based system**: Key 2 = majority of State Governors
- **Regional Federalism**: Key 2 = majority of Regional Governors

This Regional Guard article adds the intermediate tier of military capacity that only makes sense with the regional structure.
