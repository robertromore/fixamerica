# Regional Guard Forces

## Regional Federalism Supplement to Armed Forces Reform

*This document contains ONLY the region-dependent provisions for armed forces under Regional Federalism. For the complete armed forces and civilian control reform, see the [Military Civilian Control Amendment](../single-topic/military-civilian-control.md).*

---

## Compatibility Clause

This article presumes adoption of the [Military Civilian Control Amendment](../single-topic/military-civilian-control.md) or an equivalent provision establishing:

- civilian supremacy over armed forces
- two-key authorization for domestic deployment
- duty to refuse unlawful orders
- prohibited uses of armed forces
- transparency and accountability requirements
- counter-key authority for emergency suspension
- judicial key override for executive defiance of Supreme Court orders
- digital force equivalence (cyber-kinetic operations require two-key authorization)
- infrastructure independence guarantees
- state defense force limitations (personnel caps, prohibited capabilities)
- congressional key override for two-key collusion
- officer corps independence protections (loyalty prohibition, mass removal trigger, pardon limitation, chain of command integrity, cumulative removal threshold)
- counter-deployment operations protocol (activation determination, authorized actions, rules of engagement, judicial review, post-crisis adjudication)

If the Military Civilian Control Amendment is adopted alongside Regional Federalism:

- Substitute "Regional Governors" for "State Governors" in Key 2 authorization throughout that amendment
- The Judicial Key Override (Section 10) uses "five of seven Regional Governors" rather than "majority of State Governors"
- Infrastructure Independence guarantees (Section 12) apply to Regions rather than States
- State Defense Force limits (Section 13) apply to forces within constituent States, not Regional Guard
- Congressional Key Override (Section 14) uses Regional Governors for certification and bypass
- Counter-Deployment Authority (Section 15(e)) authorizes Regional Guard activation
- Counter-Deployment Operations Protocol (Section 16) activation under subsection (b)(2) uses "three or more Regional Governors" rather than "majority of State Governors"
- Counter-deployment forces are Regional Guard Forces under Article XI-RF, Section 1, supplemented by State National Guard units at State Governor request
- Post-crisis adjudication under Section 16(i) is conducted by the Special Civil-Military Review Tribunal as specified in that subsection
- The Allocation Review Board participates in activation determinations (Section 16(b)(1)), documentation verification (Section 16(k)(1)), and cumulative removal review confirmation (Section 15(k)(3))

## ARTICLE XI-RF - REGIONAL GUARD FORCES

### Section 1. Establishment of Regional Guard Forces

(a) Each Region may maintain Regional Guard Forces for:

- disaster response within the Region,
- support of civil authorities at Regional Governor request,
- defense of Regional territory in coordination with federal forces.

(b) Regional Guard Forces are under the command of the Regional Governor except when called into federal service.

*Resolves Gap 192 — Paramilitary Loophole (Shadow Army). Closes the unfederalizable Regional force vulnerability by classifying all Regional-level armed forces as Regional Guard.*

(c) **Regional Force Classification.** Any organized armed force maintained by a Regional government, other than civilian law enforcement agencies operating within normal police powers, shall be classified as Regional Guard Forces and subject to federalization under Section 2. No Region may establish or maintain military or paramilitary forces exempt from federal call-up authority. The non-federalization exemption under Section 3(d) applies only to State Defense Forces maintained by individual State governments within the limits established by the Military Civilian Control Amendment.

---

### Section 2. Federalization of Regional Guard

(a) Regional Guard Forces may be called into federal service:

- upon declaration of war by Congress,
- upon authorization for use of military force approved by two-thirds of the House and Senate,
- for domestic deployment pursuant to two-key authorization (as defined by the Military Civilian Control Amendment if adopted, or by subsection (g) of this section).

(b) When called into federal service, Regional Guard units are commanded by the President through the chain of command, except during Congressional Key Override as provided in subsection (m).

(c) Federalization for domestic purposes may not exceed ninety days without consent of the affected Region's Governor.

(d) A Regional Governor may refuse federalization of that Region's Guard Forces if:

- no two-key authorization has been obtained, or
- the federalization order directs action against that Governor's own Region.

(e) If the Regional Governor position is vacant or if the Governor has been removed by federal action, the refusal authority under subsection (d) shall be exercised by the acting Governor under Regional succession law, or if none, by the presiding officer of the Regional legislature.

(f) Federalization of a Region's Guard is prohibited for 180 days following removal of that Region's Governor by federal action, unless:

- (1) approved by two-thirds of the Regional legislature, or
- (2) approved by a majority of all other Regional Governors, or
- (3) authorized by the Supreme Court upon finding genuine emergency unrelated to the removal.

(g) **Default Two-Key Authorization.** If the Military Civilian Control Amendment is not adopted, "two-key authorization" for purposes of this article means authorization for domestic deployment of armed forces that requires approval from both:

- (1) **Key 1:** The President (or, if the President is unavailable or incapacitated, the next civilian in the line of succession), and
- (2) **Key 2:** A majority of Regional Governors, or if deployment is limited to a single Region, the Governor of that Region.

Two-key authorization may not be waived, delegated to military officers, or satisfied by implied consent. Communications requesting or conveying two-key authorization shall be authenticated in accordance with Article II, Section 23 (Authenticity of Official Acts). Deployment without two-key authorization is unlawful and may be refused by commanders without penalty.

(h) **Emergency Response Acceleration.** Notwithstanding subsection (g), the following expedited procedures apply to time-sensitive emergencies:

- (1) **Automatic Approval for Infrastructure Attacks.** When the President certifies that a cyber-physical attack on critical infrastructure (energy grid, water systems, communications networks, transportation systems) requires immediate military response, Regional Governors shall have forty-eight (48) hours to respond to a two-key authorization request. Failure to respond within forty-eight hours shall be deemed consent for the specific deployment requested, limited to defending the affected infrastructure.

- (2) **Supermajority Override.** If five of seven Regional Governors affirmatively authorize deployment, the authorization is valid even if the remaining Governors actively refuse, provided the deployment does not target the refusing Governors' Regions.

- (3) **Judicial Emergency Key.** If a majority of Regional Governors cannot be reached or fail to respond within forty-eight hours during a verified emergency, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court may, upon petition by the President and certification by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that delay poses imminent risk of mass casualties, authorize deployment for up to seventy-two (72) hours pending Governor response. This judicial authorization:
    - (i) requires the Chief Justice to find clear and convincing evidence of imminent threat;
    - (ii) may not be used for any deployment targeting domestic political activity, protests, or civil disturbances;
    - (iii) automatically terminates after seventy-two hours unless Governor majority consent is obtained;
    - (iv) shall be reported to Congress within twenty-four hours.

- (4) **Anti-Brinkmanship Provision.** A Regional Governor who withholds two-key consent while simultaneously demanding unrelated policy concessions from the President shall be deemed to have waived the consent requirement for that authorization request. The Allocation Review Board shall determine whether such conditioning has occurred, with expedited seventy-two-hour review.

#### Constitutional Compliance Enforcement

(i) **Constitutional Compliance Enforcement Exception.** Notwithstanding subsection (d), a Regional Governor may not invoke the refusal authority to shield the Region from enforcement of:

- (1) final, non-appealable rulings of the Allocation Review Board;
- (2) final, non-appealable rulings of the Supreme Court;
- (3) federal court orders enforcing constitutional provisions of this Constitution.

(j) **Alternative Enforcement Mechanisms.** When Guard federalization is unavailable or refused under subsection (d), the federal government retains authority to enforce constitutional compliance through:

- (1) fiscal measures authorized under Article X, including withholding of federal transfers and equalization payments;
- (2) federal marshals and civilian law enforcement agencies;
- (3) assumption of operational control over specific infrastructure under Article I, Section 6(o);
- (4) judicial contempt proceedings against responsible officials, including personal fines and incarceration;
- (5) disqualification of non-compliant Regional officials from future federal office.

(k) **Escalation Ladder.** Before any enforcement action under subsection (j), the federal government shall:

- (1) provide written notice specifying the violation and required remediation;
- (2) allow thirty (30) days for voluntary compliance;
- (3) offer mediation through the ARB;
- (4) obtain judicial certification that non-compliance is willful.

(l) **Anti-Militarization Principle.** The limitations on Guard federalization in subsection (d) reflect the constitutional preference for civilian, fiscal, and judicial enforcement mechanisms over military force in resolving intergovernmental disputes. Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize military action against civilian populations.

#### Congressional Key Override Operations

*Resolves Gap 82 — Double-Key Hostage-Taking (Collusion for Inaction). These provisions supplement the Congressional Key Override (Article XI, Section 14) with operational details that depend on Regional Federalism institutions. The standalone Section 14 provides the override authority, vote thresholds, scope, independent certification, governor bypass, and anti-collusion prohibition. The following subsections address command authority, certification standards, certification effect, geographic scope, and post-incident review.*

(m) **Command Authority During Congressional Key Override.** When Congress activates the override authority under Article XI, Section 14:

- (1) The Secretary of Defense exercises operational command of all federalized forces, including Regional Guard units called into federal service;
- (2) The President retains titular Commander-in-Chief status but may not countermand Congress-authorized operations;
- (3) Command reverts to the President upon termination of the Congressional override.

(n) **Insurrection Certification Standards.** For purposes of independent insurrection certification under Article XI, Section 14(d):

- (1) Certification requires a binding finding that all three conditions are met:
    - (i) armed groups exercise territorial control within the United Regions;
    - (ii) civil law enforcement, including State and Regional law enforcement, has proven insufficient to restore order; and
    - (iii) constitutional governance faces an imminent threat that military force alone can address.
- (2) Where Article XI, Section 14(d)(2) refers to "Circuit Chief Judges," the Regional Federalism equivalent shall be the Chief Justices of the Regional Supreme Courts or, if Regional Supreme Courts have not been established, the chief judges of the federal circuit courts encompassing the affected Region.
- (3) Certification under this subsection is judicially reviewable only after the operational period ends.

(o) **Certification Effect on Presidential Action.** Upon independent insurrection certification under subsection (n):

- (1) The President shall request two-key authorization or invoke the insurrection exception under Article XI, Section 3 within twenty-four (24) hours;
- (2) Failure to act within twenty-four hours:
    - (i) reduces the Congressional override threshold to two-thirds of the House and simple majority of the Senate, as provided in Article XI, Section 14(d);
    - (ii) constitutes prima facie evidence of dereliction of duty in any subsequent impeachment proceeding, but does not automatically constitute grounds for impeachment.
- (3) The President may satisfy the twenty-four-hour deadline by providing written justification for declining to act, which shall be transmitted to Congress and published immediately.

(p) **Post-Certification Regional Bypass Scope.** When a Regional Governor provides individual consent for operations under Article XI, Section 14(e):

- (1) Operations are limited to the consenting Governor's Region and areas of direct threat spillover;
- (2) Operations may not extend to non-affected Regions without those Regions' Governor consent or Congressional authorization;
- (3) The geographic scope determination shall be made by the Secretary of Defense, subject to judicial review.

(q) **Post-Incident Review.** Following any deployment authorized through Congressional key override under Article XI, Section 14:

- (1) Any member of Congress, any Regional Governor, or any affected party with standing may petition the Constitutional Court to review:
    - (i) whether the certification of insurrection was factually supported;
    - (ii) whether key-holder refusals were justified;
    - (iii) whether the scope of military operations exceeded the certified threat.
- (2) The Constitutional Court shall accept or decline the petition within thirty (30) days.
- (3) Findings of unjustified refusal may be used as evidence in subsequent impeachment or recall proceedings.
- (4) No review under this subsection may retroactively invalidate lawful military orders issued during the operational period.

---

### Section 3. Integration with State National Guard

(a) State National Guard units continue in existence within the Regional structure.

(b) State National Guard units may be placed under Regional command by agreement between the State and Regional governments.

(c) The Governor of each State retains authority over State National Guard units for State emergencies unless such units have been federalized or placed under Regional command.

(d) State Defense Forces under exclusive State control may be maintained and are not subject to federalization.

(e) Coordination Requirements. Subject to the limitations in Section 6, State National Guard and Regional Guard Forces shall maintain:

- (1) interoperable communications and command systems,
- (2) joint training exercises at least annually,
- (3) mutual aid agreements specifying support protocols,
- (4) clear precedence rules when operating in same theater.

(f) During concurrent operations, the senior Regional Guard commander shall coordinate overall response unless the emergency is confined to a single State and the Regional Governor has not declared a Regional emergency.

(g) Nothing in this section shall be construed to subordinate State National Guard units to Regional command without agreement under subsection (b), except during federalization or declared Regional emergency requiring unified command.

*Resolves Gap 192 — Paramilitary Loophole (Shadow Army). Ensures the cap-and-reclassify framework in the Military Civilian Control Amendment, Section 13(d) has proactive detection rather than relying on reactive discovery.*

(h) **Subnational Force Registry and Inspection.** The Department of Defense shall:

- (1) maintain a comprehensive registry of all Regional Guard Forces, State National Guard units, and State Defense Forces;
- (2) conduct annual inspections of all registered forces to verify compliance with personnel caps, capability prohibitions, and authorized roles established by this article and the Military Civilian Control Amendment;
- (3) report findings to Congress, the affected Regional Governor, and the Constitutional Court;
- (4) certify annually whether each State Defense Force remains within the limits that preserve its non-federalization exemption under Section 3(d).

Failure to register or refusal to submit to inspection shall constitute prima facie evidence that the force exceeds authorized limits, triggering reclassification review under the Military Civilian Control Amendment, Section 13(d) for State forces, or immediate classification as Regional Guard under Section 1(c) for Regional forces.

---

### Section 4. Monopoly on Force

*Resolves Gap 235 — Privatized War / PMC Prohibition. Closes the mercenary bypass by prohibiting private military contractors from performing inherently governmental functions involving force.*

(a) **Inherently Governmental Function.** The exercise of the following powers is an Inherently Governmental Function that may only be performed by sworn officers of the United Regions:

- (1) combat operations, offensive military action, and armed conflict engagement;
- (2) detention, arrest, and imprisonment of persons;
- (3) interrogation of prisoners or detainees;
- (4) law enforcement requiring the use or threat of force;
- (5) intelligence operations involving coercion, violence, or surveillance of U.S. persons;
- (6) security operations requiring authority to use lethal force.

(b) **Private Military Contractor Prohibition.** The Federal Government, Regional Governments, and all agencies and instrumentalities thereof may not:

- (1) employ private military contractors for combat, combat support, or security operations requiring lethal force authority;
- (2) fund, directly or indirectly, private military operations by U.S. or foreign entities;
- (3) grant immunity, indemnification, or legal protection to private military actors;
- (4) classify PMC contracts or expenditures to evade congressional oversight;
- (5) permit PMC personnel to operate under U.S. command or in conjunction with U.S. forces.

(c) **Limited Contractor Authorization.** Private contractors may provide:

- (1) logistics, maintenance, and supply chain services;
- (2) training and education in non-combat settings;
- (3) technical expertise for weapons systems;
- (4) administrative and clerical support.

Contractors providing such services may not carry weapons, exercise detention authority, or participate in combat operations.

(d) **UCMJ Extension.** Any person performing security or military-adjacent functions under U.S. government contract is subject to:

- (1) the Uniform Code of Military Justice;
- (2) prosecution for war crimes under federal law;
- (3) court-martial jurisdiction for offenses committed in conflict zones.

(e) **Foreign Operations.** U.S. persons may not:

- (1) serve in foreign private military organizations;
- (2) provide military training or services to foreign governments without State Department license;
- (3) participate in combat operations for any entity other than the United Regions armed forces.

Violation constitutes a criminal offense punishable upon final conviction by loss of citizenship pursuant to Article III, Section 5(c)(3), and permanent ineligibility for any government employment or contract.

(f) **Regional PMC Prohibition.** Regional and State governments may not:

- (1) hire private military or armed security contractors;
- (2) authorize private entities to exercise law enforcement powers;
- (3) fund paramilitary organizations through grants, contracts, or tax benefits;
- (4) grant official status, affiliation, rank, or auxiliary designation to private militia or paramilitary organizations, or integrate such organizations into any governmental armed force.

(g) **Transparency.** All contracts for security services, military training, or defense-related functions:

- (1) shall be reported to Congress within 30 days;
- (2) may not be classified solely to conceal their existence;
- (3) shall include total cost, personnel count, and authorized activities;
- (4) shall be publicly disclosed in unclassified summary form.

(h) **Enforcement.** Violation of this section:

- (1) renders any PMC contract void and unenforceable;
- (2) creates personal liability for officials authorizing prohibited contracts;
- (3) subjects violators to prosecution for illegal warfare;
- (4) authorizes Congress to terminate any covert action discovered to involve PMC combat operations.

### Section 5. Autonomous Lethal Systems and Force Equivalence

*Integrated from Gap 214 — closes the autonomous weapons loophole by prohibiting sub-federal autonomous lethal systems, requiring meaningful human control for armed systems, establishing force equivalence counting, and restricting federal domestic deployment.*

(a) **Prohibition on Autonomous Lethal Force.** No Region, State, municipality, or local government may possess, deploy, or authorize any autonomous lethal system. For purposes of this Section, an "autonomous lethal system" is any weapons system that, once activated, can select and engage targets with lethal force without a specific, affirmative human decision for each engagement.

- (1) This prohibition applies to all sub-federal entities regardless of designation, including Regional Guard forces, State Defense Forces, State and local law enforcement agencies, and any other entity exercising governmental authority;
- (2) Classification of a system as "law enforcement equipment," "defensive infrastructure," "border security," or any other label does not exempt it from this prohibition if it meets the functional definition of an autonomous lethal system; and
- (3) Single-use munitions (missiles, torpedoes, and similar ordnance that destroy themselves upon impact) are not "autonomous lethal systems" for purposes of this Section, provided they are launched pursuant to an affirmative human engagement decision.

(b) **Meaningful Human Control.** Any armed system operated by or on behalf of a Region, State, or local government — whether lethal or less-lethal — must be subject to meaningful human control:

- (1) every lethal engagement must require a specific, affirmative human decision by an identified operator;
- (2) the human operator must have the ability to abort any engagement at any moment prior to the application of force;
- (3) the operator must possess situational awareness sufficient to make an informed engagement decision, not merely ratify an algorithmic recommendation; and
- (4) the Emerging Technology Review Board shall establish and periodically update the maximum ratio of armed systems to human operators necessary to maintain meaningful control, and shall certify compliance by sub-federal armed forces.

(c) **Force Equivalence.** For purposes of personnel limitations under this Article and Article XI, Section 13, autonomous and remotely operated systems shall be counted as equivalent personnel:

- (1) the Emerging Technology Review Board shall annually establish Force Equivalence Ratios, determining the number of human personnel operationally equivalent to each class of unmanned or autonomous system, based on capability assessment;
- (2) equivalent personnel counts shall be aggregated with human personnel for all force caps applicable to Regional Guard forces, State Defense Forces, and State or local armed units;
- (3) any force — Regional Guard, State Defense Force, or other sub-federal armed entity — whose aggregate personnel count (human plus equivalents) exceeds the applicable constitutional cap shall immediately disarm excess systems or submit to federalization under Section 2 of this Article; and
- (4) the ETRB may not set a Force Equivalence Ratio below one-to-one for any armed system.

(d) **Anti-Swarm Doctrine.** The possession and operation of networked autonomous systems capable of coordinated lethal or coercive action exceeding the meaningful control capacity of their human operators is a power reserved exclusively to the federal Armed Forces for external defense:

- (1) no Region, State, or local government may possess, operate, or authorize swarms of networked autonomous systems capable of coordinated armed action;
- (2) domestic deployment of armed autonomous swarms by any level of government, including federal, is prohibited except in response to a declared invasion by a foreign power authorized under this Article; and
- (3) for purposes of this subsection, a "swarm" means three or more networked unmanned systems capable of coordinated autonomous action beyond the real-time control capacity of individual human operators.

(e) **Constructive Control and Private Intermediaries.** The prohibitions of this Section extend to any autonomous system subject to the effective control or direction of a sub-federal government, regardless of nominal ownership:

- (1) any system funded by Regional, State, or local appropriations is covered regardless of the entity that holds title;
- (2) any system that a Region, State, or local government may commandeer, requisition, or operationally direct is covered regardless of ownership structure;
- (3) any private entity, corporation, public-private partnership, or contractor that operates armed autonomous systems under the direction, funding, or operational control of a sub-federal government is subject to this Section;
- (4) leasing, licensing, or other arrangements that provide sub-federal governments with operational access to autonomous weapons systems are treated as possession for purposes of this Section; and
- (5) this subsection incorporates and extends the private military contractor prohibitions of Section 4 of this Article to autonomous systems.

(f) **Federal Domestic Restriction.** To preserve the balance of force between the federal government and the Regions:

- (1) the federal government may not deploy autonomous lethal systems within the domestic territory of the United States except in response to a declared invasion by a foreign power, and only pursuant to Two-Key authorization under Article XI, Section 3;
- (2) any federal domestic deployment of armed autonomous systems, whether lethal or less-lethal, requires the meaningful human control standards of subsection (b); and
- (3) this subsection does not restrict federal military use of autonomous systems in foreign theaters of war authorized under Article XI, Section 2.

(g) **Latent Lethality.** Systems designed or marketed for non-lethal purposes — including surveillance, logistics, agriculture, firefighting, or disaster relief — that possess latent capacity for rapid weaponization through software update, payload modularity, or field modification:

- (1) shall be classified as military equipment by the Emerging Technology Review Board if they can be converted to lethal capability without specialized manufacturing;
- (2) are subject to the force equivalence counting of subsection (c) once classified;
- (3) shall be presumed lethal unless the ETRB certifies that the system lacks weaponization potential; and
- (4) Regions possessing systems reclassified as military equipment under this subsection shall have one hundred eighty days to divest, decommission, or submit to federal oversight.

(h) **Enforcement.**

- (1) **Federal Seizure.** The federal government may seize prohibited autonomous lethal systems in the possession of any sub-federal government upon judicial order or, in exigent circumstances, upon certification by the Secretary of Defense that immediate seizure is necessary to prevent imminent use;
- (2) **Guard Federalization.** Possession of prohibited autonomous systems by a Regional Guard force constitutes grounds for emergency federalization under Section 2 of this Article;
- (3) **Automatic Reclassification.** Possession of prohibited autonomous systems by a State Defense Force triggers the automatic reclassification provisions of Article XI, Section 13(d);
- (4) **Personal Liability.** Officials who authorize the acquisition, possession, or deployment of prohibited autonomous systems are personally liable and subject to prosecution;
- (5) **Whistleblower Protection.** Any person who reports the acquisition, possession, or development of prohibited autonomous systems by a sub-federal government is protected from retaliation under the whistleblower provisions of this Constitution; and
- (6) **Compliance Monitoring.** The Department of Defense, in coordination with the Emerging Technology Review Board, shall conduct annual inspections of sub-federal armed forces to verify compliance with this Section, and shall report findings to Congress.

### Section 6. Prohibition on Inter-Regional Military Confederations

*Integrated from Gap 179 — closes the shadow confederation loophole by prohibiting inter-Regional unified command structures, limiting mutual aid deployments, restricting equipment pre-positioning, and establishing a functional classification test that prevents evasion through relabeling.*

(a) **Prohibition on Unified Command.** No Region, State, or subdivision thereof shall enter into any compact, agreement, or arrangement with another Region, State, or subdivision thereof that establishes:

- (1) a permanent unified military command structure between Regions;
- (2) a standing joint general staff, permanent joint headquarters, or permanent joint military academy for coordinating Regional Guard Forces, State National Guard units, or any other armed force subject to this Article;
- (3) automatic force integration protocols that bypass the specific mutual aid request process required by subsection (b); or
- (4) joint ownership of lethal weapons systems, ammunition stockpiles, or armored combat vehicles between Regions.

While Section 3(e) mandates interoperability and mutual aid agreements, nothing in that section shall be construed to authorize permanent unified command, standing joint staff, unified tactical doctrine, or cross-Regional force pooling outside the exceptions enumerated in subsection (i).

(b) **Mutual Aid Limitations.** Military mutual aid deployments between Regions are subject to the following:

- (1) **Time Limit.** Mutual aid deployments may not exceed thirty (30) days per incident without specific Congressional authorization. Congress may authorize one extension of up to thirty (30) additional days upon written request from both the host and guest Governors.
- (2) **Anti-Rotation.** Aggregate deployments between the same Region-pair may not exceed sixty (60) days in any twelve-month period, regardless of the number of incidents invoked, absent federal authorization. Consecutive deployments involving the same Regions designed to circumvent time limits by rotating host and guest roles are prohibited.
- (3) **Command Authority.** Visiting forces shall remain under the ultimate command of their home Governor. The hosting Governor exercises operational control only for the duration and specific purpose of the declared emergency. No "advisor," "liaison," or "consultant" from another Region may exercise command authority — formal or informal — over a host Region's forces.
- (4) **Incident Specificity.** Each mutual aid deployment must be tied to a specific, identified incident or emergency. Deployments may not be authorized for generalized "readiness," "deterrence," or "precautionary" purposes.

(c) **Equipment Pre-Positioning.** Pre-positioning of military equipment in another Region's territory is prohibited, except:

- (1) non-lethal disaster relief supplies, including food, water, generators, medical supplies, and communications equipment, may be staged pursuant to a DoD-approved seasonal emergency plan for a period not exceeding one hundred twenty (120) days per calendar year; and
- (2) mission-specific equipment may be deployed during an active, declared state of emergency and must be withdrawn within fourteen (14) days after the emergency declaration is terminated.

The pre-positioning of ammunition, heavy weapons, armored combat vehicles, or combat aircraft outside a Region's jurisdiction absent a declared emergency is prohibited. Joint logistics depots, shared maintenance facilities, or shared munitions storage between Regions are prohibited.

(d) **Functional Classification.** The prohibitions of this Section apply to any organized force, regardless of its designation as "Guard," "Police," "Civil Defense," "Emergency Management," or any other label, if that force:

- (1) is equipped with heavy weapons, armored combat vehicles, or military-grade rotary or fixed-wing aircraft;
- (2) maintains military-grade surveillance, intelligence, or electronic warfare capability;
- (3) is organized in military-style command and control structures with unit designations, ranks, and operational doctrine distinct from civilian law enforcement; or
- (4) conducts training in offensive military tactics, combined arms operations, or force-on-force maneuvers.

Any entity meeting this functional test shall be classified as a Regional Guard Force under Section 1(c) for purposes of this Article, including the compact limitations of this Section, the registry and inspection requirements of Section 3(h), and the force cap provisions of Article XI, Section 13.

(e) **Intelligence and Surveillance Compacts.** Inter-Regional intelligence-sharing compacts are prohibited when tied to force planning, operational military coordination, or the maintenance of permanent files on citizens outside active criminal investigations. Routine criminal intelligence sharing between law enforcement agencies is not restricted by this subsection, provided such sharing does not serve as a coordination mechanism for the military or paramilitary activities prohibited by this Section.

(f) **Foreign Sub-National Compacts.** No Region or State may enter into any military, paramilitary, or defense cooperation agreement with a foreign government, foreign sub-national entity, or foreign state-owned enterprise. This prohibition supplements and reinforces Article VI, Section 4 (One Voice Doctrine) as applied to military cooperation.

(g) **Joint Procurement and Standardization.** Regions may jointly procure military equipment for cost efficiency, provided that:

- (1) each item of lethal equipment, weapons system, and combat vehicle shall be owned by and registered to a single Region;
- (2) no joint procurement agreement may require participating Regions to adopt unified tactical doctrine, unified command protocols, or interchangeable officer assignments; and
- (3) cross-commissioning of officers across Regions is prohibited except for temporary training exchanges not exceeding thirty (30) days per officer per calendar year, conducted under federal observation.

(h) **Compact Registration and Oversight.**

- (1) **Registry.** All inter-Regional security compacts, mutual aid agreements, joint training schedules, and cooperative defense arrangements must be filed with the Department of Defense and the Department of Justice within thirty (30) days of execution.
- (2) **Inspection.** The Department of Defense, through the Subnational Force Registry established under Section 3(h), shall inspect all inter-Regional security compacts and their implementing structures for compliance with this Section. The Inspector General shall report findings annually to Congress.
- (3) **Federal Observers.** Joint training exercises conducted under Section 3(e) shall be observed by federal personnel designated by the Department of Defense. Federal observers shall certify that exercises are limited to disaster response and defensive readiness and do not constitute unified tactical doctrine development or combined arms training.

(i) **Exceptions.** This Section does not prohibit or restrict:

- (1) unified command authorized under Article XI, Section 10 (Judicial Key Override) when the Supreme Court has certified a Systemic Executive Breach;
- (2) federalization of Regional Guard or National Guard forces under Section 2 of this Article;
- (3) standard mutual aid compacts for civilian disaster relief that do not involve lethal equipment, unified combat command, or standing joint military structures; or
- (4) military cooperation specifically authorized by Act of Congress for a defined purpose and duration.

No exception other than those enumerated in this subsection shall be implied, inferred, or created by compact, executive agreement, or judicial interpretation.

(j) **Enforcement.**

- (1) The Attorney General shall seek immediate injunctive relief against any compact, agreement, or arrangement that violates this Section.
- (2) Any official who knowingly participates in establishing or maintaining a prohibited unified command, standing joint staff, or military confederation shall be removed from office and permanently disqualified from holding any federal, Regional, or State office.
- (3) The Department of Defense may federalize Regional Guard or State National Guard units engaged in prohibited unified operations under Section 2 of this Article.
- (4) Any non-participating Region, the Attorney General, or the Department of Defense may petition the Constitutional Court for a declaration that a compact violates this Section.

(k) **Congressional Review.** Congress shall review all active inter-Regional security compacts every two (2) years. Any compact not affirmatively reauthorized by Congress shall automatically sunset. Annual reports on compact activity shall be submitted to the Armed Services Committees of both Houses.

## Design Rationale

### Why Regional Guard Forces?

Regional Guard Forces provide:

- Additional capacity for regional disasters beyond what states can individually provide
- Regional-level military force under Regional civilian control
- Counterbalance to federal military power
- Career opportunities for military personnel preferring Regional service

Regional Guards are distinct from State National Guard units, providing an intermediate tier of military capacity.

### Why Preserve State National Guard?

The three-tier structure (Federal, Regional, State) provides:

- Redundancy and resilience
- Multiple chains of command
- Protection against concentration of military power
- Flexibility for different emergency scales

### Relationship to Military Civilian Control Amendment

The core reforms (two-key authorization, duty to refuse, prohibited uses, transparency) are in the standalone [Military Civilian Control Amendment](../single-topic/military-civilian-control.md). That amendment works with either:

- **State-based system**: Key 2 = majority of State Governors
- **Regional Federalism**: Key 2 = majority of Regional Governors

This Regional Guard article adds the intermediate tier of military capacity that only makes sense with the regional structure.
