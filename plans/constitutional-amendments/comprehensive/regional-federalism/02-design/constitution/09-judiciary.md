## Regional Federalism Supplement to Judicial Reform

*This document contains ONLY the region-dependent provisions for the judiciary under Regional Federalism. For the complete judicial reform, see the [Judicial Reform Amendment](../single-topic/judicial-reform.md).*

---

## Compatibility Clause

This article presumes adoption of the [Judicial Reform Amendment](../single-topic/judicial-reform.md) or an equivalent provision establishing:

- mandatory jurisdiction for constitutional cases
- time limits for judicial decisions
- effective remedies requirements
- self-executing default rules
- Supreme Court term limits (18 years)
- court structure protections (9 Justices)
- quorum protection with emergency restoration
- vacancy acceleration with default confirmation
- judicial nominating commissions

The Judicial Reform Amendment works with either the existing federal/state court system or with Regional Federalism. This supplement adds the Regional courts tier that only makes sense with the regional structure.

When Regional Federalism is adopted, the Judicial Nominating Commissions (Section 14 of the Judicial Reform Amendment) are established at the Regional level rather than the State level. References to "State" in that section become "Region."

## ARTICLE XIV-RF - REGIONAL COURTS

### Section 1. Establishment of Regional Courts

(a) Each Region shall establish Regional courts with jurisdiction over:

- Regional law,
- disputes between States within the Region,
- disputes between a Region and its constituent States,
- cases arising under federal law where authorized by statute.

(b) Regional courts shall include trial courts, appellate courts, and a Regional Supreme Court.

(c) Regional judges shall serve terms as established by Regional constitution, subject to good behavior requirements and removal only for cause.

(d) Appeals from Regional courts to federal courts shall be limited to questions of federal law and constitutional interpretation.

---

### Section 2. Specialized Courts for Regional Federalism

(a) The Allocation Review Board, established under Article II, shall resolve disputes regarding the allocation of powers among federal, Regional, and State governments.

(b) A National Election Court may be established by Congress to hear election disputes that cross Regional boundaries or affect national elections.

(c) The National Water Court, established under Article I, Section 7, shall resolve interstate water disputes.

(d) Specialized courts shall have judges appointed for terms and subject to removal as established by the creating statute or constitutional provision.

### Section 3. Federal Floor Interpretation Uniformity

#### Mandatory Federal Certification

(a) **Certification Requirement.** When a Regional court of any level issues a ruling interpreting, applying, or effectively exempting any person, entity, or geographic area from a Federal Floor or Federal Framework, the ruling shall not take effect until:

(1) The Federal Supreme Court declines to review the ruling; or

(2) Ninety (90) days pass without the Federal Supreme Court granting certiorari; or

(3) The Federal Supreme Court affirms the Regional interpretation.

(b) **Expanded Trigger.** For purposes of this Section, a ruling "effectively exempts" if it:

(1) Interprets the scope, applicability, or meaning of a Federal Floor or Framework;

(2) Makes a factual finding that a Federal Floor does not apply to specific conditions, actors, or geographic areas;

(3) Determines that local circumstances render a Federal Floor's specific metrics inapplicable; or

(4) Has the practical effect of suspending Federal Floor enforcement for a class of actors, regardless of doctrinal label.

(c) **Automatic Certiorari for Circuit Splits.** If two or more Regional courts have issued conflicting rulings on the same Federal Floor or Framework provision, the Federal Supreme Court shall grant certiorari within thirty (30) days of the second conflicting ruling. The ninety-day automatic effect provision does not apply to circuit split cases; the ruling remains stayed until federal resolution.

(d) **Status Quo Preservation.** During the certification period:

(1) The pre-ruling legal status quo shall remain in effect;

(2) No permits, licenses, or authorizations may be issued based on the contested interpretation;

(3) Parties may not claim reliance on the Regional interpretation for purposes of grandfather provisions, vested rights, or detrimental reliance.

#### Trial Court Injection Prevention

(e) **Trial Court Injection Prevention.**

(1) Any judicial order by any Regional court at any level that stays, enjoins, or suspends the enforcement of a Federal Floor or Framework shall be immediately transmitted to the National Constitutional Court.

(2) Within fifteen (15) days of transmission, the National Constitutional Court shall conduct a Summary Review and either:

- (i) affirm the stay pending full litigation;
- (ii) vacate the stay and require immediate enforcement; or
- (iii) modify the stay with conditions.

(3) Failure to transmit a stay order within forty-eight (48) hours renders the stay void.

(4) This subsection applies regardless of the stage of litigation; trial court injunctions receive the same immediate federal review as appellate rulings.

#### Anti-Reliance Rule

(f) **Reliance Prohibited.** No party may claim vested rights, grandfather status, detrimental reliance, or equitable estoppel based on a Regional court interpretation of a Federal Floor or Framework if:

(1) The interpretation is subject to pending certification under subsection (a);

(2) The interpretation conflicts with interpretations issued by other Regional courts;

(3) A petition for Federal Supreme Court review is pending or has been filed; or

(4) The Federal Supreme Court has granted certiorari.

(g) **Investment Risk Notice.** Permits, licenses, and authorizations issued during contested interpretation periods shall bear a "Contested Interpretation Notice" warning that:

(1) The underlying legal interpretation is subject to federal review;

(2) The permit holder bears the risk of interpretation reversal;

(3) No grandfather rights, reliance claims, or equitable defenses will apply.

(h) **Remediation Liability.** Parties who proceed under a contested interpretation bear full remediation costs if the interpretation is subsequently overturned, including:

(1) Costs of achieving compliance with the correct interpretation;

(2) Environmental remediation or cleanup costs;

(3) Back wages or benefits owed under the correct interpretation;

(4) Civil penalties for the period of non-compliance;

without offset for investments made during the uncertainty period, and without defense of good faith reliance on the Regional interpretation.

## Design Rationale

### Why Regional Courts?

Regional courts provide:

- Expertise in Regional law
- Forum for intra-Regional disputes (between States within the same Region)
- Capacity to handle Regional matters without burdening federal courts
- Accountability to Regional governance structures

Without Regional courts, disputes about Regional law would go directly to federal courts, creating:

- Excessive federal court caseload
- Lack of expertise in Regional law
- Reduced Regional autonomy

### Why Specialized Courts?

The Regional Federalism structure creates new categories of disputes:

- **Allocation Review Board**: Resolves which level of government has authority over a given matter
- **National Election Court**: Handles election disputes crossing Regional boundaries
- **National Water Court**: Adjudicates interstate water rights under equitable apportionment

These specialized courts provide expertise and consistent interpretation of complex multi-jurisdictional issues.

### Relationship to Judicial Reform Amendment

The core reforms (mandatory jurisdiction, time limits, term limits, self-executing defaults) are in the standalone [Judicial Reform Amendment](../single-topic/judicial-reform.md). That amendment:

- Works with the existing federal court system
- Does not require Regional Federalism
- Establishes the judicial accountability framework

This Regional Courts article adds:

- An intermediate court tier for Regional matters
- Specialized courts for RF-specific disputes
- Integration with the three-tier governance structure
