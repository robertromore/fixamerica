# Regional Courts

## Regional Federalism Supplement to Judicial Reform

*This document contains ONLY the region-dependent provisions for the judiciary under Regional Federalism. For the complete judicial reform, see the [Judicial Reform Amendment](../single-topic/judicial-reform.md).*

---

## Compatibility Clause

This article presumes adoption of the [Judicial Reform Amendment](../single-topic/judicial-reform.md) or an equivalent provision establishing:

- mandatory jurisdiction for constitutional cases
- time limits for judicial decisions
- effective remedies requirements
- self-executing default rules
- Supreme Court term limits (18 years)
- court structure protections (9 Justices)
- quorum protection with emergency restoration
- vacancy acceleration with default confirmation
- judicial nominating commissions

The Judicial Reform Amendment works with either the existing federal/state court system or with Regional Federalism. This supplement adds the Regional courts tier that only makes sense with the regional structure.

When Regional Federalism is adopted, the Judicial Nominating Commissions (Section 14 of the Judicial Reform Amendment) are established at the Regional level rather than the State level. References to "State" in that section become "Region."

## ARTICLE XIV-RF - REGIONAL COURTS

### Section 1. Establishment of Regional Courts

(a) Each Region shall establish Regional courts with jurisdiction over:

- Regional law,
- disputes between States within the Region,
- disputes between a Region and its constituent States,
- cases arising under federal law where authorized by statute.

(b) Regional courts shall include trial courts, appellate courts, and a Regional Supreme Court.

(c) Regional judges shall serve terms as established by Regional constitution, subject to good behavior requirements and removal only for cause.

(d) Appeals from Regional courts to federal courts shall be limited to questions of federal law and constitutional interpretation.

---

### Section 2. Specialized Courts for Regional Federalism

(a) The Allocation Review Board, established under Article II, shall resolve disputes regarding the allocation of powers among federal, Regional, and State governments.

(b) A National Election Court may be established by Congress to hear election disputes that cross Regional boundaries or affect national elections.

(c) The National Water Court, established under Article I, Section 7, shall resolve interstate water disputes.

(d) Specialized courts shall have judges appointed for terms and subject to removal as established by the creating statute or constitutional provision.

---

### Section 3. Federal Floor Interpretation Uniformity

#### Mandatory Federal Certification

(a) **Certification Requirement.** When a Regional court of any level issues a ruling interpreting, applying, or effectively exempting any person, entity, or geographic area from a Federal Floor or Federal Framework, the ruling shall not take effect until:

(1) The Federal Supreme Court declines to review the ruling; or

(2) Ninety (90) days pass without the Federal Supreme Court granting certiorari; or

(3) The Federal Supreme Court affirms the Regional interpretation.

(b) **Expanded Trigger.** For purposes of this Section, a ruling "effectively exempts" if it:

(1) Interprets the scope, applicability, or meaning of a Federal Floor or Framework;

(2) Makes a factual finding that a Federal Floor does not apply to specific conditions, actors, or geographic areas;

(3) Determines that local circumstances render a Federal Floor's specific metrics inapplicable; or

(4) Has the practical effect of suspending Federal Floor enforcement for a class of actors, regardless of doctrinal label.

(c) **Automatic Certiorari for Circuit Splits.** If two or more Regional courts have issued conflicting rulings on the same Federal Floor or Framework provision, the Federal Supreme Court shall grant certiorari within thirty (30) days of the second conflicting ruling. The ninety-day automatic effect provision does not apply to circuit split cases; the ruling remains stayed until federal resolution.

(d) **Status Quo Preservation.** During the certification period:

(1) The pre-ruling legal status quo shall remain in effect;

(2) No permits, licenses, or authorizations may be issued based on the contested interpretation;

(3) Parties may not claim reliance on the Regional interpretation for purposes of grandfather provisions, vested rights, or detrimental reliance.

#### Trial Court Injection Prevention

(e) **Trial Court Injection Prevention.**

(1) Any judicial order by any Regional court at any level that stays, enjoins, or suspends the enforcement of a Federal Floor or Framework shall be immediately transmitted to the National Constitutional Court.

(2) Within fifteen (15) days of transmission, the National Constitutional Court shall conduct a Summary Review and either:

- (i) affirm the stay pending full litigation;
- (ii) vacate the stay and require immediate enforcement; or
- (iii) modify the stay with conditions.

(3) Failure to transmit a stay order within forty-eight (48) hours renders the stay void.

(4) This subsection applies regardless of the stage of litigation; trial court injunctions receive the same immediate federal review as appellate rulings.

#### Anti-Reliance Rule

(f) **Reliance Prohibited.** No party may claim vested rights, grandfather status, detrimental reliance, or equitable estoppel based on a Regional court interpretation of a Federal Floor or Framework if:

(1) The interpretation is subject to pending certification under subsection (a);

(2) The interpretation conflicts with interpretations issued by other Regional courts;

(3) A petition for Federal Supreme Court review is pending or has been filed; or

(4) The Federal Supreme Court has granted certiorari.

(g) **Investment Risk Notice.** Permits, licenses, and authorizations issued during contested interpretation periods shall bear a "Contested Interpretation Notice" warning that:

(1) The underlying legal interpretation is subject to federal review;

(2) The permit holder bears the risk of interpretation reversal;

(3) No grandfather rights, reliance claims, or equitable defenses will apply.

(h) **Remediation Liability.** Parties who proceed under a contested interpretation bear full remediation costs if the interpretation is subsequently overturned, including:

(1) Costs of achieving compliance with the correct interpretation;

(2) Environmental remediation or cleanup costs;

(3) Back wages or benefits owed under the correct interpretation;

(4) Civil penalties for the period of non-compliance;

without offset for investments made during the uncertainty period, and without defense of good faith reliance on the Regional interpretation.

---

### Section 4. Provisional Relief and Remedy Preservation

**Scope.** This section applies to claims challenging constitutional structure, separation of powers, electoral processes, intergovernmental authority, or fundamental rights where delay would defeat the remedy—not to ordinary policy disputes or regulatory challenges.

(a) **Remedy Timing Assessment.** Upon filing of any case within the scope of this section, the court shall within seven (7) days assess whether:

(1) the challenged action is ongoing or of continuing effect;

(2) delay in resolution would render effective relief impracticable;

(3) irreversible harm to constitutional rights is likely absent provisional relief.

(b) **Expedited Review Track.** If the court determines that any condition in subsection (a) is satisfied, the case shall be assigned to an Expedited Review Track with:

(1) abbreviated briefing schedules (not to exceed 30 days total);

(2) priority scheduling for oral argument;

(3) decision within 60 days of track assignment, absent extraordinary circumstances documented in writing.

(c) **Provisional Relief Standard.** In cases on the Expedited Review Track, courts may issue provisional relief upon a showing that:

(1) the challenger raises a substantial constitutional question;

(2) continuation of the challenged action pending resolution would likely cause irreversible harm; and

(3) the balance of harms favors preserving the status quo ante.

The challenger need not demonstrate likelihood of success on the merits for provisional relief under this section; a substantial question is sufficient.

Any order granting or denying provisional relief shall include written findings addressing each factor in this subsection and explaining the court's reasoning.

(d) **Status Quo Preservation Orders.** Provisional relief under this section may include:

(1) orders freezing the implementation of challenged policies;

(2) orders requiring continuation of prior practices pending resolution;

(3) orders enjoining expenditure of funds or execution of contracts that would create irreversible facts;

(4) orders preserving election procedures in effect before the challenged action.

(e) **Mootness Limitation.** No case presenting a substantial constitutional question shall be dismissed as moot solely because:

(1) the specific election, term, or transaction at issue has concluded;

(2) the challenged policy has expired by its own terms; or

(3) the government has voluntarily ceased the challenged action.

Courts shall resolve the constitutional question on the merits unless both parties agree to dismissal and no public interest in precedent exists.

(f) **Remedies for Completed Violations.** When a court determines that a constitutional violation occurred but was completed before judicial resolution:

(1) the court shall issue a declaratory judgment establishing the violation;

(2) the court may award compensatory damages to injured parties;

(3) the court may impose structural injunctions preventing recurrence;

(4) responsible officials may be subject to sanctions under Article VIII, Section 5, including disqualification from future office for pattern violations;

(5) the government entity shall bear the costs of litigation and reasonable attorney fees.

(g) **Anti-Delay Sanctions.** If a court finds that a party engaged in procedural delay tactics to defeat timely remedy, the court shall:

(1) award attorney fees and costs to the opposing party;

(2) impose additional sanctions proportional to the harm caused by delay;

(3) refer responsible attorneys to disciplinary proceedings.

(h) **Transparency and Reporting.** The Judicial Conference shall publish annual statistics on petitions for expedited review, assignments to the Expedited Review Track, provisional relief orders granted and denied, case outcomes, and average time to resolution. These reports shall be publicly accessible and transmitted to Congress.

(i) **Election-Specific Expedited Review.** Any challenge to election procedures filed within 90 days of an election shall receive:

(1) ruling within 14 days of filing if filed more than 45 days before the election;

(2) ruling within 7 days if filed 45 days or fewer before the election;

(3) provisional relief maintaining the most recent validated election procedures pending resolution.

(j) **Infrastructure and Contract Expedited Review.** Challenges to infrastructure prioritization under Article II, Section 6-A, or to contract awards exceeding 10,000 Federal Currency Units, shall:

(1) trigger automatic stay of implementation pending initial hearing;

(2) receive ruling on provisional relief within 21 days;

(3) receive final resolution within 120 days.

### Section 5. Standing to Enforce the Constitution

*Integrates Gap 247 — The "Courthouse Door" (Standing Barrier to Constitutional Enforcement). Subsection (i) integrates Gap 175 — The Precedent Trap (Regional Standing).*

(a) **Constitutional Standing.** Any citizen of the United States shall have standing to bring an action in federal court to:

(1) enjoin ultra vires acts by any branch of the Federal Government, any Region, or any State;

(2) challenge violations of the separation of powers established by this Constitution;

(3) challenge unlawful expenditures of public funds not authorized by law;

(4) enforce structural constitutional provisions, including federalism, bicameralism, and presentment requirements;

(5) challenge actions taken pursuant to unconstitutional delegations of legislative power.

(b) **Injury Standard.** For actions under subsection (a), the injury to the constitutional order and the rule of law shall be sufficient injury to establish jurisdiction. No showing of particularized individual harm beyond the constitutional violation itself shall be required.

(c) **Taxpayer Standing.** Any taxpayer shall have standing to challenge:

(1) expenditures not authorized by congressional appropriation;

(2) expenditures in violation of constitutional prohibitions;

(3) diversion of appropriated funds to unauthorized purposes;

(4) revenue measures enacted in violation of constitutional procedures.

(d) **Organizational Standing.** Organizations formed for the purpose of monitoring government compliance with constitutional requirements shall have standing to bring actions under this section on behalf of their members and the public interest.

(e) **Limitations.** Standing under this section does not extend to:

(1) challenges to the wisdom or policy judgment of lawful government action;

(2) matters committed to unreviewable discretion by this Constitution;

(3) claims that would require courts to supervise ongoing executive operations.

(f) **Remedies.** Courts exercising jurisdiction under this section may:

(1) issue declaratory judgments;

(2) grant injunctive relief;

(3) issue writs of mandamus to compel performance of ministerial duties;

(4) award costs and reasonable attorney fees to prevailing plaintiffs.

(g) **Supersession.** This section supersedes contrary judicial interpretations of standing doctrine, including requirements of particularized injury for challenges to structural constitutional violations. *Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife* and its progeny shall not apply to actions brought under this section.

(h) **No Defensive Use.** This section creates standing for plaintiffs to challenge government action. It does not create standing for the government to challenge citizen conduct or expand governmental enforcement authority.

(i) **Regional Standing.** In addition to the citizen standing established in subsections (a) through (h), each Region shall have standing to challenge:

(1) any federal action allegedly exceeding enumerated federal powers under this Constitution;

(2) any federal action allegedly intruding on Regional Exclusive Domains or exceeding federal authority within Structured Concurrent Domains;

(3) any federal court interpretation allegedly inconsistent with the power allocation established by this Constitution.

Standing under this subsection shall not require demonstration of injury-in-fact beyond the alleged constitutional violation itself. A Region's interest in the constitutional allocation of powers is a sufficient sovereign interest to establish jurisdiction.

## ARTICLE III-RF - FEDERAL JUDICIAL REFORM PROVISIONS

*The following sections supplement the Federal Judiciary under Regional Federalism. They address structural reforms to the Supreme Court and federal courts that interact with the Regional court system established in Article XIV-RF above.*

---

### Section 5. Supreme Court Term Reform

*Integrates Gap 237 — Life Tenure Stagnation ("Judicial Lottery").*

(a) **Term Length.** Justices of the Supreme Court shall serve a single, non-renewable term of eighteen (18) years.

(b) **Staggered Appointments.** Terms shall be staggered so that one vacancy arises in each odd-numbered year. Each President shall make two Supreme Court appointments during a four-year term, absent death or early departure.

(c) **Appointment Timing.** The President shall nominate a successor within 30 days of a scheduled vacancy. The Senate shall hold hearings and vote within 90 days of nomination. Failure to vote within 90 days results in deemed confirmation pursuant to Article IV, Section 4-B.

(d) **Early Departure.** If a Justice departs before term completion:

(1) the successor serves only the remainder of the departed Justice's term;

(2) terms of less than 9 years do not count toward the one-term limit;

(3) the replacement appointment follows the same nomination and confirmation process.

(e) **Senior Justice Status.** Upon completion of the 18-year term, a Justice:

(1) assumes "Senior Justice" status on federal circuit courts;

(2) may sit by designation on lower federal courts;

(3) receives full salary and benefits for life;

(4) may not return to the Supreme Court except as temporary substitute for recused Justice.

(f) **Transition.** Upon ratification:

(1) current Justices retain their seats until death, retirement, or removal;

(2) the next vacancy triggers the 18-year term system;

(3) staggering is achieved by adjusting initial terms so vacancies align with odd years;

(4) during transition, no Justice may be appointed with term exceeding 18 years.

(g) **Regional Diversity Preserved.** The Regional Diversity requirement for Supreme Court composition (Article III-RF, Section 1) remains in effect. The 18-year term ensures each Region's seat rotates more frequently than under life tenure.

(h) **Chief Justice.** The Chief Justice:

(1) is designated by the President from among sitting Justices;

(2) serves as Chief until the end of their 18-year term;

(3) a new Chief is designated upon the prior Chief's departure.

(i) **Incapacity.** If a Justice becomes incapacitated:

(1) incapacity is determined by the Judicial Conference of the United States;

(2) an incapacitated Justice is deemed to have vacated the seat;

(3) the incapacitated Justice assumes Senior Justice status with full benefits.

---

### Section 6. Trial Penalty Prohibition (The Coercion Cap)

*Integrates Gap 242 — The "Trial Penalty" Gap (Death of the Jury).*

(a) **Maximum Sentencing Differential.** To preserve the right to trial by jury guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment:

(1) The sentence imposed after conviction at trial shall not exceed **one hundred fifty percent (150%)** of the sentence offered in a plea bargain for the same conduct;

(2) For purposes of this calculation, the "sentence offered" includes all incarceration, probation, fines, and collateral consequences aggregated into a comparable value;

(3) If no formal plea offer was extended, the trial sentence shall not exceed 150% of the statutory minimum for the offense of conviction.

(b) **Plea Offer Documentation.** All plea offers shall be:

(1) made in writing with specific sentence terms stated;

(2) filed with the court under seal at the time of offer;

(3) available to the sentencing judge after conviction at trial;

(4) preserved in the record for appellate review.

(c) **Charge Stacking Prohibition.** The Government may not:

(1) increase charges solely because a defendant refused a plea offer;

(2) file superseding indictments adding charges after plea negotiations fail, absent newly discovered evidence;

(3) structure charges to evade the 150% cap by artificially separating a single course of conduct into multiple offenses.

(d) **Judicial Review of Trial Penalty.** Before imposing any sentence exceeding the documented plea offer:

(1) the court shall make written findings justifying each increment above the offer;

(2) the aggregate sentence shall not exceed the 150% cap absent extraordinary circumstances documented on the record;

(3) "the defendant exercised trial rights" is not an extraordinary circumstance.

(e) **Retroactive Relief.** Any person currently incarcerated whose sentence exceeds 200% of the documented plea offer may petition for resentencing under this section within three (3) years of ratification.

(f) **Enforcement.** A sentence imposed in violation of this section:

(1) is void to the extent it exceeds the 150% cap;

(2) shall be automatically reduced to the maximum permissible sentence;

(3) creates a civil cause of action against the prosecuting jurisdiction.

(g) **Prosecutorial Accountability.** Prosecutors who demonstrably engaged in patterns of coercion through systematic trial penalty exploitation may be:

(1) referred to state bar disciplinary authorities;

(2) disqualified from practicing before federal courts;

(3) subject to civil liability for constitutional violations under color of law.

---

### Section 7. Defense Parity Rule

*Integrates Gap 246 — The "Defense Deficit" (Empty Promise of Counsel).*

(a) **Resource Equivalence.** To ensure the constitutional guarantee of effective counsel, the funding and resources allocated to the Public Defense of indigent defendants shall be commensurate with the funding and resources allocated to the Prosecution.

(1) For purposes of this section, "commensurate" means substantially equivalent per-case expenditure, accounting for case complexity and severity of charges.

(2) "Resources" includes attorneys, investigators, expert witnesses, paralegals, support staff, technology, and all other litigation support.

(3) The State may not spend its way to a conviction against a citizen who cannot afford to defend themselves.

(b) **Caseload Limits.** No public defender shall be assigned:

(1) more than 150 felony cases per year;

(2) more than 400 misdemeanor cases per year;

(3) more than 200 juvenile cases per year;

(4) any combination exceeding weighted equivalent as established by the Defense Parity Commission.

Assignments exceeding these limits constitute a per se violation of the right to effective counsel.

(c) **Expert Access.** Indigent defendants shall have:

(1) presumptive entitlement to expert witnesses in categories routinely used by prosecution (forensics, mental health, financial analysis);

(2) automatic approval for one defense expert in any field where prosecution presents expert testimony;

(3) expedited ex parte process for additional experts, with approval within 7 days;

(4) no requirement to disclose defense expert strategy to prosecution before retention.

(d) **Investigation Parity.** The defense shall have access to:

(1) investigators with authority to interview witnesses and gather evidence;

(2) forensic analysis capabilities equivalent to prosecution resources;

(3) discovery in usable electronic format with adequate time for review;

(4) prosecution work product identifying exculpatory evidence (*Brady* material) within 14 days of charge.

(e) **Salary Parity.** Public defender compensation shall be:

(1) not less than 90% of equivalent prosecutor compensation in the same jurisdiction;

(2) adjusted for experience, with retention incentives matching prosecution career tracks;

(3) sufficient to attract and retain qualified counsel.

(f) **Defense Parity Commission.** There shall be established a Defense Parity Commission:

(1) composed of judges, prosecutors, defense attorneys, and public members;

(2) empowered to establish caseload standards, resource requirements, and parity metrics;

(3) authorized to audit compliance and certify jurisdictions meeting parity requirements;

(4) required to publish annual reports on defense resource adequacy.

(g) **Enforcement.** Failure to provide parity resources shall result in:

(1) mandatory dismissal of charges if parity deficiency prejudiced the defendant;

(2) automatic reversal of convictions obtained without parity resources;

(3) prospective funding mandates imposed by federal courts on non-compliant jurisdictions;

(4) personal liability for officials who knowingly maintain unconstitutional defense funding.

(h) **Presumption of Prejudice.** When caseload limits are exceeded or resource parity is not achieved:

(1) prejudice is presumed, reversing the *Strickland* burden;

(2) the State must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the deficiency did not affect the outcome;

(3) systemic deficiency (affecting entire jurisdiction) creates presumption for all defendants.

(i) **Strickland Modified.** The standard for ineffective assistance of counsel under *Strickland v. Washington* is hereby modified:

(1) "objective reasonableness" is measured against adequately resourced defense, not underfunded baseline;

(2) systemic resource deficiency constitutes per se ineffective assistance;

(3) the "prejudice" prong is satisfied upon showing reasonable probability that adequate resources would have produced different result.

---

### Section 8. Single Jeopardy Rule

*Integrates Gap 256 — The "Dual Sovereignty" Trap (Double Jeopardy Abuse).*

(a) **Unified Jeopardy Protection.** No person shall be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb for the same underlying conduct or transaction, regardless of which sovereign -- Federal, Regional, State, or Territorial -- brings the charge.

(1) A verdict of acquittal in any jurisdiction bars prosecution in every other jurisdiction for the same conduct.

(2) A conviction in any jurisdiction bars subsequent prosecution for the same conduct, except as provided in subsection (d).

(3) "Same conduct" means the same act, transaction, or course of conduct, regardless of the statutory label, element analysis, or sovereign interest asserted.

(b) **Attachment of Jeopardy.** Jeopardy attaches when:

(1) a jury is empaneled and sworn;

(2) in a bench trial, when the first witness is sworn;

(3) in a guilty plea proceeding, when the court accepts the plea.

(c) **Pre-Trial Coordination Requirement.** Before prosecution may proceed in any jurisdiction:

(1) the prosecuting authority shall certify that no other jurisdiction is prosecuting or has prosecuted the same conduct;

(2) if multiple jurisdictions have potential interest, they shall designate a single lead jurisdiction;

(3) failure to coordinate does not bar the first prosecution but bars all subsequent prosecutions.

(d) **Limited Exception for Manifest Injustice.** A second prosecution may proceed only upon:

(1) clear and convincing evidence of jury tampering, bribery, or corruption in the first proceeding;

(2) certification by a three-judge panel that the first proceeding was fundamentally compromised;

(3) no second prosecution based merely on disagreement with the verdict or discovery of additional evidence.

(e) **Civil Rights Preservation.** This section does not preclude:

(1) civil actions for damages arising from the same conduct;

(2) administrative proceedings for license revocation or professional discipline;

(3) federal enforcement where state prosecution was impossible due to state law (e.g., state lacks relevant criminal statute).

(f) **Supersession.** This section supersedes the dual sovereignty doctrine as applied in *Gamble v. United States*, *Heath v. Alabama*, and their progeny. The protection against double jeopardy is a right of the citizen against all governments, not merely against each government separately.

---

### Section 9. De Novo Review Mandate

*Integrates Gap 257 — The "Interpretive Blank Check" (Deference Gap).*

(a) **Judicial Duty to Interpret.** In all cases involving the interpretation of statutes, treaties, regulations, or other legal instruments, the Judiciary shall decide all questions of law de novo, exercising independent judgment without deference to the interpretation of any executive agency, administrative body, or other non-judicial entity.

(b) **Prohibition on Deference Doctrines.** The Judiciary shall not defer to:

(1) agency interpretations of statutes, whether under *Chevron U.S.A. v. NRDC*, *Skidmore v. Swift*, or any successor doctrine;

(2) agency interpretations of their own regulations, whether under *Auer v. Robbins*, *Kisor v. Wilkie*, or any successor doctrine;

(3) agency determinations of their own jurisdictional scope or authority;

(4) executive branch legal opinions, including those of the Department of Justice or Regional equivalents.

(c) **Factual Deference Preserved.** This section does not prohibit deference to:

(1) agency factual findings supported by substantial evidence;

(2) agency technical or scientific determinations within their expertise;

(3) agency policy choices where statute grants discretion.

(d) **Clear Statement Requirement.** No statute shall be interpreted to grant an agency authority to:

(1) decide questions of major political or economic significance, unless Congress clearly stated that intent;

(2) expand the agency's jurisdiction beyond its traditional scope;

(3) impose obligations or penalties not clearly authorized by statutory text.

(e) **Agency Interpretations as Evidence.** Courts may consider agency interpretations as:

(1) evidence of how a statute has been understood historically;

(2) practical considerations informing interpretation;

(3) but never as binding or presumptively correct legal authority.

(f) **Constitutional Codification.** The holding of *Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo* (2024) overruling *Chevron* deference is hereby constitutionalized. No judicial decision may revive deference doctrines or create functional equivalents.

(g) **Regional Application.** This section applies equally to:

(1) Federal courts reviewing federal agency interpretations;

(2) Federal courts reviewing Regional agency interpretations;

(3) Regional courts reviewing Regional agency interpretations;

(4) Any court reviewing administrative interpretation of law.

---

### Section 10. Sunshine in Litigation Mandate

*Integrates Gap 258 — The "Sealed Danger" Loophole (Secret Settlements).*

(a) **Prohibition on Concealment of Public Hazards.** No court order, settlement agreement, protective order, or confidentiality provision may conceal information concerning:

(1) a defect in a consumer product that poses risk of death or serious bodily harm;

(2) a hazard to public health, including contamination, pollution, or toxic exposure;

(3) a hazard to public safety, including infrastructure defects, vehicle defects, or building code violations;

(4) fraud or deception in products, services, or investments marketed to the public;

(5) patterns of conduct constituting civil rights violations affecting multiple persons.

(b) **Void and Unenforceable.** Any provision in a settlement agreement, contract, or court order that restricts disclosure of information covered by subsection (a) is void and unenforceable. Any party may disclose such information without penalty.

(c) **Mandatory Disclosure to Regulators.** When litigation reveals information covered by subsection (a):

(1) parties shall provide such information to relevant federal and Regional regulatory agencies within thirty (30) days of discovery;

(2) disclosure to regulators is mandatory regardless of any confidentiality agreement;

(3) regulatory agencies shall treat submitted information as public records subject to FOIA, unless independent statutory exemption applies.

(d) **Judicial Duty.** Before approving any settlement involving sealed records or confidentiality provisions:

(1) the court shall review the materials to be sealed;

(2) the court shall make written findings that no information covered by subsection (a) is being concealed;

(3) the court shall consider whether confidentiality serves legitimate privacy interests or merely conceals wrongdoing;

(4) denial of sealing for public safety information is mandatory, not discretionary.

(e) **Legitimate Privacy Preserved.** This section does not prohibit confidentiality for:

(1) personal medical records not relevant to product defect claims;

(2) trade secrets unrelated to public safety (manufacturing processes, not safety data);

(3) financial terms of settlements (dollar amounts, not underlying facts);

(4) identity protection for minor victims or sexual assault survivors.

(f) **Whistleblower Protection.** Any person who discloses information covered by subsection (a) in good faith:

(1) is immune from civil liability for breach of confidentiality;

(2) is protected from retaliation by employers or contracting parties;

(3) may recover attorney fees and damages for attempted retaliation.

(g) **Retroactive Disclosure.** Information concerning ongoing public hazards concealed under prior confidential settlements:

(1) may be disclosed without penalty if the hazard continues;

(2) any person possessing such information may petition the court for release;

(3) court shall grant release upon finding the hazard is ongoing and public interest outweighs confidentiality.

(h) **Private Right of Action.** Any person harmed by a hazard that was concealed through confidential settlement may bring action against:

(1) the concealing party, for damages caused by continued concealment;

(2) attorneys who knowingly participated in concealing public hazards;

(3) such actions are not barred by the underlying settlement.

---

### Section 11. Reasoned Order Mandate

*Integrates Gap 259 — The "Shadow Docket" (Law by Fiat).*

(a) **Requirement of Reasoned Decision.** Every order of the Supreme Court that affects the legal rights of parties or enjoins the operation of a federal, Regional, or State law shall be accompanied by:

(1) a written opinion explaining the legal reasoning for the decision;

(2) the signature of at least one Justice taking responsibility for the reasoning;

(3) identification of which Justices joined the opinion, concurred, or dissented.

(b) **Emergency Orders.** When the Supreme Court issues an emergency stay, injunction, or vacatur:

(1) the order shall state the legal standard applied;

(2) the order shall explain why the standard is met in the specific case;

(3) if the order resolves or effectively moots a merits question, the order shall receive full briefing and oral argument within sixty (60) days.

(c) **Shadow Docket Limitations.** The Supreme Court may not use emergency or summary procedures to:

(1) establish binding precedent on questions not fully briefed and argued;

(2) resolve merits questions disguised as procedural matters;

(3) effectively decide cases in ways that prevent subsequent merits review.

(d) **Lower Court Guidance.** When an emergency order affects how lower courts should apply law:

(1) the order shall provide sufficient reasoning for lower courts to understand and apply;

(2) an unexplained order creates no precedent that lower courts must follow;

(3) lower courts may treat unexplained orders as limited to their specific facts.

(e) **Expedited Merits Review.** When the Court grants emergency relief:

(1) the case shall be placed on an expedited merits track;

(2) full briefing shall be completed within ninety (90) days;

(3) oral argument shall be held within thirty (30) days of briefing completion;

(4) merits decision shall issue within sixty (60) days of argument.

(f) **Transparency Requirements.**

(1) All emergency applications and responses shall be publicly docketed within twenty-four (24) hours of filing;

(2) The Court's consideration of emergency matters shall be disclosed to the public;

(3) Vote counts on emergency orders shall be published even if opinion is per curiam.

(g) **Anti-Evasion.** The Court may not circumvent these requirements by:

(1) denying certiorari on cases where shadow docket orders effectively resolved the dispute;

(2) characterizing substantive decisions as procedural to avoid explanation requirements;

(3) using "GVR" (grant, vacate, remand) orders to avoid merits decisions on important questions.

---

### Section 12. Civilian Court Supremacy

*Resolves Gap 190 — Tribunal Trap (Martial Law Limits). Converts the holding of Ex Parte Milligan (1866) into constitutional text, ensuring civilian court supremacy survives Gap 175's interpretive decoupling. Part of the Gap 175 Repair Trilogy (Gaps 188, 189, 190).*

(a) **Prohibition on Military Tribunals for Civilians.** No civilian may be tried by a military tribunal, martial court, or any judicial body other than the civilian courts established under this Constitution while the civilian courts of competent jurisdiction remain open and functioning.

(b) **Definition of "Open and Functioning."** A civilian court is "open and functioning" if:

- (i) the courthouse or alternative facility is physically accessible;
- (ii) judges are available to hear cases, including by remote proceedings;
- (iii) basic procedural rights—counsel, confrontation, jury for serious offenses—can be provided.

The temporary closure of a specific courthouse does not render courts "non-functioning" if alternative venues or remote proceedings are available. Functional capacity includes availability through any medium, including manual or paper-based proceedings. Disruption of electronic systems does not render courts non-functioning if judges remain available and procedural rights can be provided through alternative means.

(c) **Habeas Corpus Limitations.** The suspension of the Writ of Habeas Corpus, where constitutionally authorized:

- (i) shall not authorize the creation of ad hoc judicial bodies;
- (ii) shall not transfer jurisdiction from civilian to military courts;
- (iii) shall only authorize temporary detention pending civilian court proceedings;
- (iv) where the Emergency Powers Reform Amendment (Article XVII) is in force, the duration and procedural limits of Section 8 thereof govern suspension; where that Amendment is not in force, suspension shall not exceed ninety (90) days without Congressional reauthorization and judicial review.

(d) **Prohibited Exercises.** Under no circumstances may military tribunals:

- (i) try civilians for ordinary criminal offenses, regardless of emergency status;
- (ii) impose sentences of death, imprisonment, or corporal punishment on civilians;
- (iii) exercise jurisdiction over any person not subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

(e) **Emergency Docket Procedures.** During declared emergencies, civilian courts shall:

- (i) establish expedited dockets for emergency-related offenses;
- (ii) permit remote proceedings where physical attendance is impractical;
- (iii) temporarily relax non-essential procedural requirements while preserving core due process rights.

The existence of emergency conditions does not justify transfer to military jurisdiction.

(f) **Enforcement.** Any military officer who convenes a tribunal to try a civilian in violation of this section:

- (i) acts ultra vires and without lawful authority;
- (ii) is personally liable for false imprisonment;
- (iii) may be prosecuted for deprivation of civil rights;
- (iv) may not claim obedience to superior orders as defense.

Any conviction by such tribunal is void ab initio.

## Design Rationale

### Why Regional Courts?

Regional courts provide:

- Expertise in Regional law
- Forum for intra-Regional disputes (between States within the same Region)
- Capacity to handle Regional matters without burdening federal courts
- Accountability to Regional governance structures

Without Regional courts, disputes about Regional law would go directly to federal courts, creating:

- Excessive federal court caseload
- Lack of expertise in Regional law
- Reduced Regional autonomy

### Why Specialized Courts?

The Regional Federalism structure creates new categories of disputes:

- **Allocation Review Board**: Resolves which level of government has authority over a given matter
- **National Election Court**: Handles election disputes crossing Regional boundaries
- **National Water Court**: Adjudicates interstate water rights under equitable apportionment

These specialized courts provide expertise and consistent interpretation of complex multi-jurisdictional issues.

### Relationship to Judicial Reform Amendment

The core reforms (mandatory jurisdiction, time limits, term limits, self-executing defaults) are in the standalone [Judicial Reform Amendment](../single-topic/judicial-reform.md). That amendment:

- Works with the existing federal court system
- Does not require Regional Federalism
- Establishes the judicial accountability framework

This Regional Courts article adds:

- An intermediate court tier for Regional matters
- Specialized courts for RF-specific disputes
- Integration with the three-tier governance structure
