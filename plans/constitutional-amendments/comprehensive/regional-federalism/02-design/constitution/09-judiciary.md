# Regional Courts

## Regional Federalism Supplement to Judicial Reform

*This document contains ONLY the region-dependent provisions for the judiciary under Regional Federalism. For the complete judicial reform, see the [Judicial Reform Amendment](../../../../single-topic/judicial-reform/).*

---

## Compatibility Clause

This article presumes adoption of the [Judicial Reform Amendment](../../../../single-topic/judicial-reform/) or an equivalent provision establishing:

- mandatory jurisdiction for constitutional cases
- time limits for judicial decisions
- effective remedies requirements
- self-executing default rules
- Supreme Court term limits (18 years)
- court structure protections (9 Justices)

The Judicial Reform Amendment works with either the existing federal/state court system or with Regional Federalism. This supplement adds the Regional courts tier that only makes sense with the regional structure.

## ARTICLE XIV-RF - REGIONAL COURTS

### Section 1. Establishment of Regional Courts

(a) Each Region shall establish Regional courts with jurisdiction over:

- Regional law,
- disputes between States within the Region,
- disputes between a Region and its constituent States,
- cases arising under federal law where authorized by statute.

(b) Regional courts shall include trial courts, appellate courts, and a Regional Supreme Court.

(c) Regional judges shall serve terms as established by Regional constitution, subject to good behavior requirements and removal only for cause.

(d) Appeals from Regional courts to federal courts shall be limited to questions of federal law and constitutional interpretation.

---

### Section 2. Specialized Courts for Regional Federalism

(a) The Allocation Review Board, established under Article II, shall resolve disputes regarding the allocation of powers among federal, Regional, and State governments.

(b) A National Election Court may be established by Congress to hear election disputes that cross Regional boundaries or affect national elections.

(c) The National Water Court, established under Article I, Section 7, shall resolve interstate water disputes.

(d) Specialized courts shall have judges appointed for terms and subject to removal as established by the creating statute or constitutional provision.

## Design Rationale

### Why Regional Courts?

Regional courts provide:

- Expertise in Regional law
- Forum for intra-Regional disputes (between States within the same Region)
- Capacity to handle Regional matters without burdening federal courts
- Accountability to Regional governance structures

Without Regional courts, disputes about Regional law would go directly to federal courts, creating:

- Excessive federal court caseload
- Lack of expertise in Regional law
- Reduced Regional autonomy

### Why Specialized Courts?

The Regional Federalism structure creates new categories of disputes:

- **Allocation Review Board**: Resolves which level of government has authority over a given matter
- **National Election Court**: Handles election disputes crossing Regional boundaries
- **National Water Court**: Adjudicates interstate water rights under equitable apportionment

These specialized courts provide expertise and consistent interpretation of complex multi-jurisdictional issues.

### Relationship to Judicial Reform Amendment

The core reforms (mandatory jurisdiction, time limits, term limits, self-executing defaults) are in the standalone [Judicial Reform Amendment](../../../../single-topic/judicial-reform/). That amendment:

- Works with the existing federal court system
- Does not require Regional Federalism
- Establishes the judicial accountability framework

This Regional Courts article adds:

- An intermediate court tier for Regional matters
- Specialized courts for RF-specific disputes
- Integration with the three-tier governance structure
