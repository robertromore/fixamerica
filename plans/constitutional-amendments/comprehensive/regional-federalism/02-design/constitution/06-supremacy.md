# Supremacy and Transition

## Articles XVIII-XX: Supremacy, Transition, and Non-State Entities

*This document contains the supremacy, transition, and non-state entity provisions of the Regional Federal Constitution.*

---

## ARTICLE XVIII - SUPREMACY AND CONSTRUCTION

### Section 1. Enumerated Powers Supremacy

Only powers expressly granted to the federal government by this Constitution are valid exercises of federal authority. This section reinforces Article II, Section 1; powers not enumerated to the federal government are reserved to the Regions, States, or the People.

---

### Section 2. Floor Presumption

Rights and standards shall be construed as floors unless explicitly stated otherwise.

---

### Section 3. Interpretive Conventions

(a) Capitalized terms "Region," "State," "Tribal Nation," and "Territory" refer to constitutional entities established or recognized by this Constitution.

(b) "Tribal Nation" means a federally recognized Tribal Nation unless otherwise specified. The inherent sovereignty acknowledged in Article XX, Section 3 is not limited to federally recognized Tribal Nations, but constitutional protections and coordination requirements under this Constitution apply to federally recognized Tribal Nations as a matter of practical administration. See Article XXII, Section 1(d).

(c) References to "Regional" institutions (Regional Governor, Regional legislature, Regional courts) use initial capitalization to denote constitutional status.

(d) "Federal" refers to the national government of the United States.

---

## ARTICLE XIX - RATIFICATION AND TRANSITION

### Section 1. Effect Upon Ratification

This amendment package shall take effect upon ratification pursuant to its own terms.

---

### Section 2. Transition Authority

(a) Notwithstanding Section 1, certain operational provisions of this Constitution may be activated in phases pursuant to transition legislation enacted prior to ratification, provided such legislation:

- is enacted by both chambers of Congress and signed by the President prior to ratification,
- specifies a maximum transition period not exceeding four years from ratification,
- does not delay the immediate provisions identified in Section 3,
- does not expand existing governmental authority beyond that permitted under the prior Constitution.

(b) Transition legislation shall govern sequencing and continuity during the transition period but may not claim supremacy over this Constitution. Any conflict between transition legislation and this Constitution shall be resolved in favor of this Constitution.

(c) Transition legislation expires automatically upon completion of the transition period and may not be extended.

---

### Section 3. Immediate Provisions

The following provisions take effect immediately upon ratification and may not be delayed by transition legislation:

- Congressional representation for the District of Columbia (Article XX, Section 1(a))
- Rights floors and the floor presumption (Article III; Article XVIII, Section 2)
- Prohibition on power expansion during transition
- The amendment process (Article XIII)
- Mandatory jurisdiction for constitutional cases (Article XIV, Section 1)
- Two-key authorization requirements for domestic deployment (Article XI, Section 2)

---

### Section 4. Transition Completion

Upon completion of the transition period:

- All transition legislation terminates automatically
- All provisions of this Constitution are fully operative
- Any residual authority claimed under transition legislation is void

---

## ARTICLE XX - NON-STATE ENTITIES

### Section 1. District of Columbia

(a) The District of Columbia shall be entitled to representation in Congress as if it were a State, including Representatives apportioned by population and two Senators. This representation is immediate upon ratification.

(b) **Transitional Senate Representation.** Until Regional assignment is completed, District Senators serve as at-large members of the Senate with full voting rights, subject to the Integration Timeline provisions of Section 4. Upon Regional assignment, District Senators join the assigned Region's delegation for purposes of Senate organization, while continuing to be elected by District residents.

(c) Within five years, Congress shall determine the District's permanent status: admission as a State with Regional assignment, or Regional assignment while preserving federal district status.

(d) Regional assignment requires approval by two-thirds of the receiving Region's legislature and by majority referendum of District residents. No assignment may take effect within one year before or six months after a federal presidential election.

(e) **Integration Bonus.** Upon Regional assignment, the Integration Bonus provisions of Section 4 shall apply to the District.

(f) Implementation procedures are established by statute. See the [D.C. Status Determination Act](../../proposals/08-special-jurisdictions/dc-status-determination-act.md) for the proposed implementing legislation.

---

### Section 2. Territories

(a) Residents of United States territories shall be entitled to participate in federal elections and to Congressional representation. Congress shall assign each territory to a Region based on geographic proximity, historical connection, or economic integration.

(b) **Transitional Congressional Representation.** Until Regional assignment is completed:

- (1) each territory shall elect at least one Representative apportioned by population;
- (2) each territory shall elect two Senators with full voting rights, subject to the Integration Timeline provisions of Section 4;
- (3) territorial Senators serve as at-large members of the Senate, not assigned to any Regional delegation;
- (4) upon Regional assignment, territorial Senators join the assigned Region's delegation for purposes of Senate organization.

(c) Regional assignment requires approval by two-thirds of the receiving Region's legislature and may be rejected by territorial referendum. No assignment may take effect within one year before or six months after a federal presidential election.

(d) Congress shall establish a clear path for each territory to petition for statehood, Regional assignment without statehood, or continued territorial status with defined representation. No territory may be held indefinitely without a defined governance status.

(e) **Integration Bonus.** Upon Regional assignment, the Integration Bonus provisions of Section 4 shall apply to the territory.

(f) Implementation procedures are established by statute. See the [Territories Status Determination Act](../../proposals/08-special-jurisdictions/territories-status-act.md) for the proposed implementing legislation.

---

### Section 3. Tribal Nations

(a) The inherent sovereignty of federally recognized Tribal Nations is hereby reaffirmed. Tribal Nations possess original sovereignty that predates this Constitution and exists independent of federal recognition.

(b) Tribal Nations are not subordinate political subdivisions of the federal government, Regions, States, or territories. The relationship between the United States and Tribal Nations is government-to-government, nation-to-nation.

(c) Tribal lands remain under tribal jurisdiction. Federal authority over tribal lands is limited to that arising from treaties, trust responsibilities, and powers expressly consented to by Tribal Nations. Regional and State authority does not extend to tribal lands except by consent of the affected Tribal Nation.

(d) Regions and Tribal Nations shall enter into compacts for coordination of shared services, infrastructure, and emergency response. Such compacts shall be negotiated in good faith and shall respect tribal sovereignty.

(e) Tribal Nations may, at their option, designate representatives to participate in Regional assemblies. The nature of such participation (voting, non-voting, observer) shall be determined by agreement between each Tribal Nation and the relevant Region.

(f) Nothing in this Constitution diminishes any treaty rights, trust responsibilities, or obligations of the United States to Tribal Nations.

### Section 4. Territorial and District Integration Incentives

*This section establishes the "Bridge and Cliff" mechanism to ensure that non-state entities are incentivized to complete Regional integration rather than remaining indefinitely in at-large transitional status.*

#### Part A: The Integration Bonus (The Bridge)

(a) **Bonus Senate Seat.** When a Territory or the District is assigned to a Region pursuant to Sections 1 or 2, that Region's Senate delegation shall increase by one seat for a period of fifteen (15) years following the effective date of assignment.

(b) **Reserved Election.** The bonus seat shall be elected exclusively by the residents of the newly integrated Territory or District using ranked-choice voting.

(c) **Full Powers.** The Senator holding the bonus seat shall have full voting rights and committee membership privileges identical to other Senators.

(d) **Expiration.** After fifteen (15) years, the bonus seat expires. Thereafter, the Territory or District participates in the Region's standard Senate elections.

(e) **Post-Bonus Representation Guarantee.** Following expiration of the bonus period:

- (1) Integrated Territories or Districts with population equal to or exceeding twice the national population per House seat (as determined by the most recent decennial census and apportionment) shall be guaranteed that at least one of the Region's three standard Senate seats shall be elected by ranked-choice vote conducted exclusively within the Territory or District;
- (2) This guarantee expires when the Territory or District population falls below the national population per House seat for two consecutive decennial censuses;
- (3) Territories or Districts with population below the threshold in subsection (1) participate in Region-wide Senate elections without a guaranteed seat.

(f) **Non-Transferable.** The integration bonus may be claimed only once per Territory or District. A Territory or District that subsequently transfers to a different Region does not generate a new bonus period.

(g) **Good Faith Integration.** If the Independent Boundary Review Commission finds that a Region has systematically excluded its integrated Territory or District from Regional governance—including denial of proportional committee representation, exclusion from fiscal equalization, or deliberate dilution of Territory or District residents in Regional elections—the bonus seat period shall be extended until the Commission certifies good faith integration.

#### Part B: The Integration Timeline (The Cliff)

(h) **Five-Year Full Voting Window.** For five (5) years following ratification, at-large Senators from unassigned Territories and the District shall possess full voting rights in the Senate on all matters.

(i) **Reversion to Delegate Status.** If a Territory or District remains unassigned after five (5) years from ratification:

- (1) its Senators shall retain the right to speak on the Senate floor, participate in committee deliberations, and introduce legislation;
- (2) its Senators shall forfeit the right to vote on the Senate floor until Regional assignment is completed;
- (3) this reversion shall not affect House representation, which continues with full voting rights regardless of assignment status.

(j) **Fiscal Consequences of Non-Assignment.** Unassigned Territories and the District after year five (5) shall:

- (1) continue to receive federal program benefits and transfers;
- (2) be ineligible for new Regional infrastructure grants, Regional innovation funds, or other benefits established for Regional members;
- (3) have baseline federal transfers frozen at year-five levels, adjusted only for inflation.

(k) **Restoration of Voting Rights.** Full Senate voting rights are immediately restored upon completion of Regional assignment.

#### Part C: The Orphan Safeguard

(l) **Rejection Review.** If a Territory or District petitions for Regional assignment but is rejected by the receiving Region, the Independent Boundary Review Commission shall review the rejection within one hundred eighty (180) days.

(m) **Fiscal Discrimination Finding.** The Commission may find "Fiscal Discrimination" if:

- (1) the rejection was substantially motivated by the Territory's or District's debt obligations, fiscal condition, or anticipated costs rather than legitimate geographic, cultural, or administrative concerns; or
- (2) multiple Regions have rejected the Territory or District, and no legitimate non-fiscal basis exists for universal rejection.

(n) **Ordered Assignment.** Upon a finding of Fiscal Discrimination:

- (1) the Commission may order assignment to the most geographically and culturally appropriate Region;
- (2) the order is subject to appeal to the Supreme Court within sixty (60) days;
- (3) the Court may vacate the order only upon finding that the Commission's determination was arbitrary, capricious, or based on clear factual error.

(o) **Federal Debt Assumption.** In cases of ordered assignment under subsection (n):

- (1) the Federal Government shall assume one hundred percent (100%) of the Territory's or District's outstanding public debt as of the date of ratification, adjusted for inflation;
- (2) debt incurred after ratification shall not be assumed and shall transfer with the Territory or District to the receiving Region;
- (3) the assumption shall be funded through general federal revenues and shall not be charged to the receiving Region.

(p) **Anti-Gaming.** To prevent moral hazard:

- (1) the debt assumption cap is fixed at ratification-date levels;
- (2) Territories or Districts that incur substantial new debt after ratification in anticipation of federal assumption shall have such post-ratification debt excluded from assumption and subject to independent audit;
- (3) the Commission may reduce the assumption amount if it finds the Territory or District engaged in deliberate fiscal mismanagement after ratification.

## Design Rationale

### Why Enumerated Powers Supremacy?

The federal government has expanded far beyond original enumerated powers through:

- implied powers doctrine
- commerce clause expansion
- spending power coercion
- emergency powers accumulation

Enumerated powers supremacy:

- restores meaningful federalism
- creates enforceable boundaries
- prevents creeping centralization
- protects Regional and State authority

### Why Floor Presumption?

Without explicit floor presumption, courts may interpret federal law to preempt state protections exceeding federal standards. The floor presumption:

- preserves state/Regional policy experimentation
- prevents preemption arguments from blocking higher standards
- ensures federal law sets minimums, not maximums
- protects policy diversity

### Why Phased Transition?

Immediate implementation of all provisions would:

- overwhelm administrative capacity
- create legal uncertainty
- risk implementation failures
- generate opposition from disrupted institutions

Phased transition:

- allows orderly implementation
- builds capacity before activation
- maintains stability during change
- creates precedent for future amendments

### Why Immediate Provisions?

Some provisions cannot wait:

- **D.C. representation**: Citizens should not be disenfranchised during transition
- **Rights floors**: Fundamental protections cannot be delayed
- **Power expansion prohibition**: Prevents using transition to grab power
- **Amendment process**: Enables correction of implementation problems
- **Mandatory jurisdiction**: Ensures courts can enforce the Constitution
- **Two-key authorization**: Prevents misuse of military during vulnerable transition

### Why Separate Treatment of Non-State Entities?

The current Constitution:

- denies D.C. residents meaningful representation
- leaves territories in constitutional limbo
- undermines tribal sovereignty through inconsistent treatment

Separate treatment ensures:

- full representation for D.C. residents
- clear path to defined status for territories
- reaffirmation and protection of tribal sovereignty
- no entity left in constitutional uncertainty

### Why the "Bridge and Cliff" Integration Mechanism?

Without Section 4, territories and the District could rationally choose to remain indefinitely in at-large status:

- **The Perverse Incentive:** At-large Senators are dedicated exclusively to their constituents' interests, while joining a Region means sharing representation with larger states. A territory like Puerto Rico (3.2M people) might calculate that at-large status gives them *more* effective representation than being absorbed into a Region dominated by larger states.

- **The "Continued Territorial Status" Escape Hatch:** The Territories Status Determination Act (Section 24) explicitly allows indefinite continued territorial status with representation—no Regional integration required.

The "Bridge and Cliff" mechanism solves this through aligned incentives:

**The Bridge (Integration Bonus):**

- Makes territories a *prize* rather than a *burden*—Regions gain +1 Senate seat for 15 years
- Regions compete to court territories rather than avoiding them
- Territories retain dedicated representation during transition period
- Post-bonus guarantee for large territories prevents post-integration dilution

**The Cliff (Integration Timeline):**

- At-large voting rights expire after 5 years if unassigned
- Creates genuine urgency to complete integration
- Delegate status (voice, no vote) is a real demotion without being disenfranchisement
- Fiscal consequences add economic pressure

**The Orphan Safeguard:**

- Prevents Regions from colluding to reject territories and force them into delegate status
- "Fiscal Discrimination" finding allows ordered assignment
- Federal debt assumption removes the "hot potato" dynamic
- Anti-gaming provisions prevent territories from running up debt pre-integration

This mechanism ensures that:

- Both territories and Regions have positive incentives to integrate
- No territory is left in limbo through no fault of its own
- The 15-year bonus period allows political adjustment without permanent asymmetry
- Post-bonus guarantees protect large territories from dilution
