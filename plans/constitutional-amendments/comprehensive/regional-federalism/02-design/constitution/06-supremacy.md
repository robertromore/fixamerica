# Supremacy and Transition

## Articles XVIII-XX, XXIII-XXV: Supremacy, Transition, Non-State Entities, and Structural Protections

*This document contains the supremacy, transition, and non-state entity provisions of the Regional Federal Constitution, along with structural protections for indigenous sovereignty, union permanence, and federal district independence.*

---

## ARTICLE XVIII - SUPREMACY AND CONSTRUCTION

### Section 1. Enumerated Powers Supremacy

Only powers expressly granted to the federal government by this Constitution are valid exercises of federal authority. This section reinforces Article II, Section 1; powers not enumerated to the federal government are reserved to the Regions, States, or the People.

---

### Section 2. Floor Presumption

Rights and standards shall be construed as floors unless explicitly stated otherwise.

---

### Section 3. Interpretive Conventions

(a) Capitalized terms "Region," "State," "Tribal Nation," and "Territory" refer to constitutional entities established or recognized by this Constitution.

(b) "Tribal Nation" means a federally recognized Tribal Nation unless otherwise specified. The inherent sovereignty acknowledged in Article XX, Section 3 is not limited to federally recognized Tribal Nations, but constitutional protections and coordination requirements under this Constitution apply to federally recognized Tribal Nations as a matter of practical administration. See Article XXII, Section 1(d).

(c) References to "Regional" institutions (Regional Governor, Regional legislature, Regional courts) use initial capitalization to denote constitutional status.

(d) "Federal" refers to the national government of the United States.

(e) "National Constitutional Court" means the Supreme Court of the United States when exercising constitutional review jurisdiction under this Constitution, including but not limited to summary review of stays and injunctions, State constitutional challenges, proxy designation determinations, and expedited override review.

---

### Section 4. Interpretive Decoupling

*Resolves Gap 175 — The Precedent Trap (Interpretive Regress). Prevents courts from importing pre-ratification centralizing precedent into the new constitutional framework.*

(a) **Pre-Ratification Precedent.** Judicial precedents established prior to the ratification of this Constitution shall not be binding interpretation of this Constitution where they:

(1) conflict with the text or structure of this Constitution;

(2) would diminish the scope of Regional Exclusive Domains below their textual meaning;

(3) would expand federal authority beyond its enumerated powers in this Constitution; or

(4) were decided under constitutional provisions superseded by this Constitution.

Pre-ratification precedent may be considered as persuasive authority where consistent with the text and structure of this Constitution, but carries no presumption of correctness regarding the allocation of powers between Federal, Regional, and State governments.

(b) **Supersession of Conflicting Doctrine.** The following pre-ratification doctrines are hereby superseded to the extent inconsistent with this Constitution:

(1) the "substantial effects" test for Commerce Clause jurisdiction, including the holdings of *Wickard v. Filburn* (1942) and *Gonzales v. Raich* (2005) insofar as they permit federal regulation of activity wholly within a single Region on the theory that such activity substantially affects interstate commerce;

(2) implied field preemption of Regional or State authority, whereby federal regulation of a field is deemed to exclude all subnational regulation even absent express preemption;

(3) the dormant Commerce Clause as a judicially implied restriction on Regional or State regulatory authority, provided that the common-market protections established by Article I, Section 9 (Mutual Recognition) and Article X, Section 11-A (Prohibition on Predatory Tax Exportation) remain in full force as textual substitutes for judicially implied commerce restrictions;

(4) any doctrine that treats federal agency interpretation as binding or presumptively correct on constitutional questions, including questions regarding the scope of federal versus Regional authority.

(c) **Affirmative Text Requirement.** Federal authority over matters assigned to Regional Exclusive Domains under Article II, Section 1(e)(2) requires:

(1) explicit textual authorization in this Constitution; and

(2) where exercised through legislation, explicit textual authorization in a federal statute enacted after ratification of this Constitution that specifically identifies the constitutional provision granting authority.

No federal authority over Exclusive Regional Domains may be implied from the general structure of the Constitution, from pre-ratification precedent, or from the aggregate effect of multiple non-exclusive powers.

(d) **Relationship to Existing Provisions.** This section complements and does not diminish:

(1) Article II, Section 1(e)(4)(iii) (prohibition on judicial reclassification of domains);

(2) Article II, Section 3-A (rights floor enforcement constraints);

(3) Article XVIII, Section 1 (enumerated powers supremacy);

(4) Article III-RF, Section 9 (de novo review mandate).

---

### Section 5. Presumption of Subsidiarity

*Resolves Gap 175 — The Precedent Trap (Interpretive Regress). Establishes the default rule for resolving ambiguities in the allocation of powers.*

(a) **Power Allocation Presumption.** Ambiguities regarding the division of authority between Federal, Regional, and State governments shall be resolved:

(1) in favor of the Regional Exclusive Domains as defined in Article II, Section 1(e)(2);

(2) against implied preemption of Regional authority;

(3) in favor of concurrent jurisdiction where this Constitution does not clearly assign exclusive authority to any level of government.

(b) **Burden of Proof.** The party asserting federal authority over a matter within a Regional Exclusive Domain or Structured Concurrent Domain bears the burden of demonstrating explicit textual authorization. No presumption of federal authority arises from:

(1) the historical exercise of federal power over similar subject matter prior to ratification;

(2) the existence of pre-ratification federal statutes addressing the subject matter;

(3) the practical convenience of uniform federal regulation.

(c) **Concurrent Domain Default.** Within Structured Concurrent Domains under Article II, Section 1(e)(3), federal authority is limited to setting minimum standards (floors) through the procedures established in Article II, Section 4. Regional authority to exceed those floors is presumed unless this Constitution expressly provides otherwise.

---

## ARTICLE XIX - RATIFICATION AND TRANSITION

### Section 1. Effect Upon Ratification

This amendment package shall take effect upon ratification pursuant to its own terms.

---

### Section 2. Transition Authority

(a) Notwithstanding Section 1, certain operational provisions of this Constitution may be activated in phases pursuant to transition legislation enacted prior to ratification, provided such legislation:

- is enacted by both chambers of Congress and signed by the President prior to ratification,
- specifies a maximum transition period not exceeding four years from ratification,
- does not delay the immediate provisions identified in Section 3,
- does not expand existing governmental authority beyond that permitted under the prior Constitution.

(b) Transition legislation shall govern sequencing and continuity during the transition period but may not claim supremacy over this Constitution. Any conflict between transition legislation and this Constitution shall be resolved in favor of this Constitution.

(c) Transition legislation expires automatically upon completion of the transition period and may not be extended.

---

### Section 3. Immediate Provisions

The following provisions take effect immediately upon ratification and may not be delayed by transition legislation:

- Congressional representation for the District of Columbia (Article XX, Section 1(a))
- Rights floors and the floor presumption (Article III; Article XVIII, Section 2)
- Prohibition on power expansion during transition
- The amendment process (Article XIII)
- Mandatory jurisdiction for constitutional cases (Article XIV, Section 1)
- Two-key authorization requirements for domestic deployment (Article XI, Section 2)

---

### Section 4. Transition Completion

Upon completion of the transition period:

- All transition legislation terminates automatically
- All provisions of this Constitution are fully operative
- Any residual authority claimed under transition legislation is void

---

## ARTICLE XX - NON-STATE ENTITIES

### Section 1. District of Columbia

(a) The District of Columbia shall be entitled to representation in Congress as if it were a State, including Representatives apportioned by population and two Senators. This representation is immediate upon ratification.

(b) **Transitional Senate Representation.** Until Regional assignment is completed, District Senators serve as at-large members of the Senate with full voting rights, subject to the Integration Timeline provisions of Section 4. Upon Regional assignment, District Senators join the assigned Region's delegation for purposes of Senate organization, while continuing to be elected by District residents.

(c) Within five years, Congress shall determine the District's permanent status: admission as a State with Regional assignment, or Regional assignment while preserving federal district status.

(d) Regional assignment requires approval by two-thirds of the receiving Region's legislature and by majority referendum of District residents. No assignment may take effect within one year before or six months after a federal presidential election.

(e) **Integration Bonus.** Upon Regional assignment, the Integration Bonus provisions of Section 4 shall apply to the District.

(f) Implementation procedures are established by statute. See the [D.C. Status Determination Act](../../proposals/08-special-jurisdictions/dc-status-determination-act.md) for the proposed implementing legislation.

---

### Section 2. Territories

(a) Residents of United States territories shall be entitled to participate in federal elections and to Congressional representation. Congress shall assign each territory to a Region based on geographic proximity, historical connection, or economic integration.

(b) **Transitional Congressional Representation.** Until Regional assignment is completed:

- (1) each territory shall elect at least one Representative apportioned by population;
- (2) each territory shall elect two Senators with full voting rights, subject to the Integration Timeline provisions of Section 4;
- (3) territorial Senators serve as at-large members of the Senate, not assigned to any Regional delegation;
- (4) upon Regional assignment, territorial Senators join the assigned Region's delegation for purposes of Senate organization.

(c) Regional assignment requires approval by two-thirds of the receiving Region's legislature and may be rejected by territorial referendum. No assignment may take effect within one year before or six months after a federal presidential election.

(d) Congress shall establish a clear path for each territory to petition for statehood, Regional assignment without statehood, or continued territorial status with defined representation. No territory may be held indefinitely without a defined governance status.

(e) **Integration Bonus.** Upon Regional assignment, the Integration Bonus provisions of Section 4 shall apply to the territory.

(f) Implementation procedures are established by statute. See the [Territories Status Determination Act](../../proposals/08-special-jurisdictions/territories-status-act.md) for the proposed implementing legislation.

---

### Section 3. Tribal Nations

(a) The inherent sovereignty of federally recognized Tribal Nations is hereby reaffirmed. Tribal Nations possess original sovereignty that predates this Constitution and exists independent of federal recognition.

(b) Tribal Nations are not subordinate political subdivisions of the federal government, Regions, States, or territories. The relationship between the United States and Tribal Nations is government-to-government, nation-to-nation.

(c) Tribal lands remain under tribal jurisdiction. Federal authority over tribal lands is limited to that arising from treaties, trust responsibilities, and powers expressly consented to by Tribal Nations. Regional and State authority does not extend to tribal lands except by consent of the affected Tribal Nation.

(d) Regions and Tribal Nations shall enter into compacts for coordination of shared services, infrastructure, and emergency response. Such compacts shall be negotiated in good faith and shall respect tribal sovereignty.

(e) Tribal Nations may, at their option, designate representatives to participate in Regional assemblies. The nature of such participation (voting, non-voting, observer) shall be determined by agreement between each Tribal Nation and the relevant Region.

(f) Nothing in this Constitution diminishes any treaty rights, trust responsibilities, or obligations of the United States to Tribal Nations.

#### National Interest Corridor Dispute Resolution

*Resolves Gap 99 — Tribal Veto via Infrastructure Entrapment. Establishes a Sovereign Mediation Panel framework for resolving disputes when National Interest Corridors must cross tribal land, balancing tribal sovereignty protection with national infrastructure connectivity.*

(g) **National Interest Corridor Designation.** A corridor may be designated as a "National Interest Corridor" only when all three of the following criteria are satisfied:

- (1) The corridor serves critical interstate infrastructure connecting two or more Regions, including but not limited to electrical transmission, rail, pipeline, highway, or telecommunications infrastructure;
- (2) No feasible alternative route exists that avoids tribal land, where "feasible" has the meaning defined in subsection (m)(2), as certified by the Department of Commerce acting through the National Institute of Standards and Technology; and
- (3) The designation is approved by Joint Resolution of Congress, enacted with a three-fifths vote in the Senate, after receiving and considering the NIST feasibility certification and the views of the affected Tribal Nation(s).

National Interest Corridor designation shall specify the infrastructure type, maximum physical footprint, estimated duration of the transit need, and environmental impact assessment. Designation may be revoked by the same procedure. Designation does not itself authorize construction; it establishes eligibility for the mediation process under subsections (h) through (n).

(h) **Sovereign Mediation Requirement.** Where tribal consent under Section 3(c) is withheld for a designated National Interest Corridor:

- (1) A Sovereign Mediation Panel shall be convened within thirty (30) days of a formal request by the affected Region, Tribal Nation, or Secretary of the Interior;
- (2) The Panel shall consist of seven (7) members: two (2) selected by the affected Tribal Nation, two (2) by the affected Region, two (2) by the Secretary of the Interior (who shall select members with expertise in infrastructure mediation and tribal affairs), and one (1) neutral mediator who shall be a retired Article III federal judge drawn by lot from a roster maintained by the Chief Justice, excluding judges who served in courts located in the affected Region or any Region party to the dispute;
- (3) Panel members shall have no financial interest in the corridor project, its alternatives, or any entity that would benefit from the corridor's construction or obstruction;
- (4) The Panel shall have authority to fashion binding resolution subject to the procedures and limitations of subsections (h) through (t);
- (5) **Multi-Tribal Corridors.** Where a National Interest Corridor crosses the lands of multiple Tribal Nations, a single Consolidated Sovereign Mediation Panel shall be convened. The Panel shall be expanded to include one (1) representative from each additional affected Tribal Nation, with one (1) additional Regional representative added for each additional Tribal representative to maintain balance, and one (1) additional neutral mediator added for every three (3) additional members. All vote thresholds in this Section shall be calculated proportionally to the expanded Panel size, rounded up. Each affected Tribal Nation retains independent standing to challenge the Panel's determinations.
- (6) **Multi-Region Corridors.** Where a National Interest Corridor is sought by or directly benefits multiple Regions, the co-petitioning Regions shall jointly select the two (2) Regional representatives. Regions through whose territory the corridor would pass but who are not co-petitioners may petition the Panel for one (1) non-voting advisory seat with full participation rights in mediation proceedings but no vote on resolutions under subsections (l) through (n). Where multi-Region and multi-Tribal provisions apply simultaneously, subsection (h)(5) governs Panel expansion and vote thresholds.

(i) **Mediation Timeline.** The Sovereign Mediation Panel:

- (1) Shall complete mediation within one hundred eighty (180) days of convening;
- (2) May extend once for ninety (90) additional days by unanimous consent of all members;
- (3) Upon expiration of the mediation period without agreement, shall proceed to resolution under subsections (l) through (n);
- (4) Shall publish a written report documenting all proposals offered by each party, counterproposals, reasons for rejection, and the Panel's assessment of the feasibility and reasonableness of each proposal;
- (5) The mediation timeline under subsections (i)(1)-(2) shall be tolled during the pendency of any interlocutory appeal under subsection (r)(2).

(j) **Mediation Scope.** The Panel may consider and recommend:

- (1) Alternative corridor routes that avoid tribal land entirely;
- (2) Corridor realignment to minimize the footprint crossing tribal land;
- (3) Compensation packages for transit rights that preserve tribal jurisdiction;
- (4) Mitigation measures addressing environmental, cultural, sacred site, and community concerns;
- (5) Revenue-sharing arrangements for ongoing infrastructure operations;
- (6) Tribal employment and contracting preferences for construction, maintenance, and operation;
- (7) Infrastructure design modifications that reduce impact on tribal land use, including undergrounding, noise barriers, and visual screening.

(k) **Good Faith Requirement.** All parties must participate in mediation in good faith:

- (1) Refusal to participate, refusal to respond to proposals within thirty (30) days, or failure to designate Panel members within thirty (30) days constitutes bad faith;
- (2) Demands for the base easement component of compensation exceeding three hundred percent (300%) of independently appraised fair market value create a rebuttable presumption of bad faith; for purposes of this subsection, the sovereignty premium under subsection (p)(2) and revenue share under subsection (p)(4) are excluded from the bad faith calculation;
- (3) A finding of bad faith authorizes the Panel to proceed to resolution under subsections (l) through (n) without the bad-faith party's consent;
- (4) Bad faith by a Region creates a presumption in favor of the Tribal Nation's most recent good-faith proposal;
- (5) Bad faith by a Tribal Nation enables the resolution mechanisms of subsections (l) through (n) but does not authorize any outcome that would not otherwise be available under those subsections — the substantive protections of subsections (o) through (q) apply regardless of any bad faith finding.

(l) **Negotiated Resolution.** If the Panel reaches agreement:

- (1) The agreement is binding on all parties and enforceable in federal court;
- (2) The agreement may include compensation, mitigation, revenue-sharing, employment preferences, route modification, design modification, or any other terms within the Panel's scope under subsection (j);
- (3) Implementation is overseen by the Department of Interior in its capacity as trustee for the affected Tribal Nation;
- (4) Either party may petition the Panel for modification if circumstances materially change, provided the modification does not diminish the Tribal Nation's compensation or sovereignty protections below the standards in subsections (o) and (p).

(m) **Re-Routing Obligation.** If no agreement is reached, before any Constitutionally Authorized Transit Easement may be considered:

- (1) The corridor shall be re-routed to avoid tribal land if a feasible alternative exists, even if more costly than the original route;
- (2) "Feasible" means reasonably constructible within standard engineering practice using proven technology and without requiring experimental methods or extraordinary risk measures; cost alone does not defeat feasibility unless the alternative exceeds three hundred percent (300%) of the original route cost as certified by NIST;
- (3) Re-routing costs, including all additional construction, engineering, environmental mitigation, and land acquisition costs, are borne entirely by the Region or entity seeking the corridor;
- (4) Re-routing may not impose unreasonable burden on other Regions, other Tribal Nations, or private landowners; the Panel shall determine whether a burden is unreasonable based on quantified economic, environmental, and community impact assessments submitted by all affected parties;
- (5) The Panel shall certify in writing whether re-routing is feasible under subsections (m)(1)-(4) before proceeding to subsection (n), and shall publish its certification and supporting analysis.

(n) **Constitutionally Authorized Transit Easement.** If re-routing is certified as not feasible under subsection (m):

- (1) The Panel may, by vote of five (5) of seven (7) members, including the affirmative vote of at least one neutral mediator, authorize a Constitutionally Authorized Transit Easement over tribal land; for Consolidated Panels under subsection (h)(5), the required vote is the proportional equivalent rounded up, including the affirmative vote of at least one neutral mediator;
- (2) The transit easement authorizes only the specific infrastructure use designated in the National Interest Corridor designation and no other use;
- (3) Compensation shall be determined by the Panel in accordance with subsection (p) and shall be paid in full before construction may commence;
- (4) The transit easement does not transfer land ownership, fee simple title, general jurisdiction, or any authority beyond the specific infrastructure use authorized;
- (5) The Tribal Nation retains full sovereignty over all activities on the easement land not directly related to the authorized infrastructure operation;
- (6) The transit easement shall include a mandatory termination and reversion clause: when the infrastructure is decommissioned, the National Interest Corridor designation is revoked, or the authorized infrastructure use ceases for a continuous period exceeding five (5) years, all rights under the easement revert to the Tribal Nation, and the easement holder shall restore the land to its prior condition at its own expense within two (2) years of reversion.

(o) **Tribal Jurisdiction Preservation.** Constitutionally Authorized Transit Easements under subsection (n):

- (1) Do not transfer land ownership, fee simple title, or general jurisdiction to any party;
- (2) Are limited to the specific infrastructure use authorized in the National Interest Corridor designation and the physical footprint specified therein;
- (3) Include tribal participation in infrastructure governance, including but not limited to environmental monitoring, safety oversight, emergency response coordination, and representation on any operating board or authority for the corridor segment;
- (4) Are subject to tribal law enforcement on the easement land for all matters not directly related to infrastructure operation;
- (5) May not be expanded in scope, transferred to a different entity, or repurposed for a different infrastructure type without the Tribal Nation's consent or a new National Interest Corridor designation meeting all criteria of subsection (g);
- (6) Shall comply with all applicable tribal environmental and cultural protection laws to the extent consistent with the authorized infrastructure operation.

(p) **Compensation Standards.** Just compensation for Constitutionally Authorized Transit Easements shall include all of the following:

- (1) Fair market value for the easement as determined by independent appraisal using methodologies agreed upon by the Panel or, absent agreement, the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice, with the appraisal conducted by an appraiser mutually selected or, absent agreement, appointed by the neutral mediator;
- (2) A sovereignty premium of not less than fifty percent (50%) and not more than two hundred percent (200%) of fair market value, as determined by the Panel based on the degree of impact on tribal sovereignty, land use, cultural values, and community cohesion;
- (3) Full compensation for any environmental or cultural impacts, including costs of mitigation, monitoring, and restoration;
- (4) Ongoing revenue share from infrastructure operation at a rate determined by the Panel, not less than the greater of two percent (2%) of gross revenue or ten percent (10%) of net operating income from the corridor segment crossing tribal land, adjusted for inflation annually; for infrastructure operated on a cost-of-service basis, as a public utility, or without direct revenue attributable to the corridor segment, the minimum revenue share shall be a fixed annual payment not less than two percent (2%) of the replacement cost of the infrastructure improvements on the easement land, as certified by NIST and adjusted for inflation annually; the Panel may further adjust any formula under this subsection provided the adjusted amount is not less than the applicable minimum floor;
- (5) Tribal employment and contracting preferences for infrastructure construction, maintenance, and operation, consistent with tribal self-determination;
- (6) All compensation shall be paid directly to the Tribal Nation's designated financial authority, not held in federal trust unless the Tribal Nation affirmatively requests trust management.

(q) **Scope Limitation and Consent Preference.** Nothing in subsections (g) through (t):

- (1) Diminishes the preference for negotiated consent under subsection (c) of this Section, which remains the primary and preferred method for authorizing infrastructure on tribal land;
- (2) Authorizes any taking or easement of tribal land for purposes that do not satisfy all three criteria of subsection (g);
- (3) Applies to infrastructure that is not the subject of a formal, current National Interest Corridor designation;
- (4) Permits any authority other than a duly constituted Sovereign Mediation Panel to authorize Constitutionally Authorized Transit Easements over tribal land under this Section;
- (5) Notwithstanding the general consent requirements of Article XXIII, Section 4(a) of this Constitution, a Constitutionally Authorized Transit Easement authorized under subsection (n) constitutes a limited, compensated, and procedurally safeguarded exception to the consent requirement for the specific infrastructure use designated — and for no other purpose; all other protections of Article XXIII remain in full force;
- (6) Creates any precedent for federal, Regional, or State authority over tribal land outside the specific National Interest Corridor framework established by this Section.

(r) **Foreign Influence Prohibition.** Tribal consent decisions regarding National Interest Corridors:

- (1) May not be influenced by payments, incentives, loans, debt forgiveness, or other consideration from foreign governments, foreign state-owned enterprises, foreign non-governmental organizations, or entities receiving substantial funding from foreign sources or acting on behalf of or under the direction of foreign governments;
- (2) A finding of foreign influence, established by clear and convincing evidence before the Panel or a federal court of competent jurisdiction, voids any consent or withholding-of-consent decision affected by such influence, and the Panel may proceed as though no decision had been made; a voiding determination is subject to immediate interlocutory appeal, which shall be decided within sixty (60) days of filing; the mediation timeline under subsection (i) is tolled during the pendency of such appeal;
- (3) The Department of Interior, in coordination with the Department of Justice and the intelligence community, shall monitor for foreign influence in corridor disputes involving designated National Interest Corridors;
- (4) Any person or entity that knowingly facilitates foreign influence in tribal consent decisions regarding National Interest Corridors is subject to criminal prosecution under applicable federal law.

(s) **Inter-Regional Manipulation Prohibition.** Regions may not:

- (1) Provide payments, subsidies, grants, or incentives to Tribal Nations to withhold consent for corridors primarily benefiting other Regions;
- (2) Coordinate with Tribal Nations, directly or through intermediaries, to achieve infrastructure blockade effects that would be prohibited under Article I, Section 6 if conducted by the Region directly;
- (3) Condition Regional benefits, compacts, services, or cooperation with a Tribal Nation on the Tribal Nation's consent or withholding of consent regarding another Region's corridor request;
- (4) Such manipulation constitutes a violation of the Non-Blockade rules under Article I, Section 6, and is subject to the full remedies and penalties established therein, including treble damages under Section 6(n) and repeat offender designation under Section 6(p).

(t) **Transparency Requirements.** In National Interest Corridor negotiations and mediation:

- (1) All payments, agreements, or commitments between any party and a Tribal Nation exceeding one million dollars ($1,000,000) in value must be disclosed to the Panel and published in the National Infrastructure Transparency System established under Article I, Section 6(q); for purposes of this threshold, all payments from the same source or related sources to the same Tribal Nation within any twelve (12) month period shall be aggregated, and structuring payments to evade the disclosure threshold constitutes a per se violation;
- (2) The source of funds for any party's negotiating positions, legal representation, expert witnesses, and lobbying activities must be disclosed to the Panel upon request;
- (3) Failure to disclose information required under this subsection creates a rebuttable presumption of manipulation under subsection (r) or (s);
- (4) The Panel may draw adverse inferences from non-disclosure in fashioning its resolution under subsections (l) through (n).

### Section 4. Territorial and District Integration Incentives

*This section establishes the "Bridge and Cliff" mechanism to ensure that non-state entities are incentivized to complete Regional integration rather than remaining indefinitely in at-large transitional status.*

#### Part A: The Integration Bonus (The Bridge)

(a) **Bonus Senate Seat.** When a Territory or the District is assigned to a Region pursuant to Sections 1 or 2, that Region's Senate delegation shall increase by one seat for a period of fifteen (15) years following the effective date of assignment.

(b) **Reserved Election.** The bonus seat shall be elected exclusively by the residents of the newly integrated Territory or District using ranked-choice voting.

(c) **Full Powers.** The Senator holding the bonus seat shall have full voting rights and committee membership privileges identical to other Senators.

(d) **Expiration.** After fifteen (15) years, the bonus seat expires. Thereafter, the Territory or District participates in the Region's standard Senate elections.

(e) **Post-Bonus Representation Guarantee.** Following expiration of the bonus period:

- (1) Integrated Territories or Districts with population equal to or exceeding twice the national population per House seat (as determined by the most recent decennial census and apportionment) shall be guaranteed that at least one of the Region's three standard Senate seats shall be elected by ranked-choice vote conducted exclusively within the Territory or District;
- (2) This guarantee expires when the Territory or District population falls below the national population per House seat for two consecutive decennial censuses;
- (3) Territories or Districts with population below the threshold in subsection (1) participate in Region-wide Senate elections without a guaranteed seat.

(f) **Non-Transferable.** The integration bonus may be claimed only once per Territory or District. A Territory or District that subsequently transfers to a different Region does not generate a new bonus period.

(g) **Good Faith Integration.** If the Independent Boundary Review Commission finds that a Region has systematically excluded its integrated Territory or District from Regional governance—including denial of proportional committee representation, exclusion from fiscal equalization, or deliberate dilution of Territory or District residents in Regional elections—the bonus seat period shall be extended until the Commission certifies good faith integration.

#### Part B: The Integration Timeline (The Cliff)

(h) **Five-Year Full Voting Window.** For five (5) years following ratification, at-large Senators from unassigned Territories and the District shall possess full voting rights in the Senate on all matters.

(i) **Reversion to Delegate Status.** If a Territory or District remains unassigned after five (5) years from ratification:

- (1) its Senators shall retain the right to speak on the Senate floor, participate in committee deliberations, and introduce legislation;
- (2) its Senators shall forfeit the right to vote on the Senate floor until Regional assignment is completed;
- (3) this reversion shall not affect House representation, which continues with full voting rights regardless of assignment status.

(j) **Fiscal Consequences of Non-Assignment.** Unassigned Territories and the District after year five (5) shall:

- (1) continue to receive federal program benefits and transfers;
- (2) be ineligible for new Regional infrastructure grants, Regional innovation funds, or other benefits established for Regional members;
- (3) have baseline federal transfers frozen at year-five levels, adjusted only for inflation.

(k) **Restoration of Voting Rights.** Full Senate voting rights are immediately restored upon completion of Regional assignment.

#### Part C: The Orphan Safeguard

(l) **Rejection Review.** If a Territory or District petitions for Regional assignment but is rejected by the receiving Region, the Independent Boundary Review Commission shall review the rejection within one hundred eighty (180) days.

(m) **Fiscal Discrimination Finding.** The Commission may find "Fiscal Discrimination" if:

- (1) the rejection was substantially motivated by the Territory's or District's debt obligations, fiscal condition, or anticipated costs rather than legitimate geographic, cultural, or administrative concerns; or
- (2) multiple Regions have rejected the Territory or District, and no legitimate non-fiscal basis exists for universal rejection.

(n) **Ordered Assignment.** Upon a finding of Fiscal Discrimination:

- (1) the Commission may order assignment to the most geographically and culturally appropriate Region;
- (2) the order is subject to appeal to the Supreme Court within sixty (60) days;
- (3) the Court may vacate the order only upon finding that the Commission's determination was arbitrary, capricious, or based on clear factual error.

(o) **Federal Debt Assumption.** In cases of ordered assignment under subsection (n):

- (1) the Federal Government shall assume one hundred percent (100%) of the Territory's or District's outstanding public debt as of the date of ratification, adjusted for inflation;
- (2) debt incurred after ratification shall not be assumed and shall transfer with the Territory or District to the receiving Region;
- (3) the assumption shall be funded through general federal revenues and shall not be charged to the receiving Region.

(p) **Anti-Gaming.** To prevent moral hazard:

- (1) the debt assumption cap is fixed at ratification-date levels;
- (2) Territories or Districts that incur substantial new debt after ratification in anticipation of federal assumption shall have such post-ratification debt excluded from assumption and subject to independent audit;
- (3) the Commission may reduce the assumption amount if it finds the Territory or District engaged in deliberate fiscal mismanagement after ratification.

## Design Rationale

### Why Enumerated Powers Supremacy?

The federal government has expanded far beyond original enumerated powers through:

- implied powers doctrine
- commerce clause expansion
- spending power coercion
- emergency powers accumulation

Enumerated powers supremacy:

- restores meaningful federalism
- creates enforceable boundaries
- prevents creeping centralization
- protects Regional and State authority

### Why Floor Presumption?

Without explicit floor presumption, courts may interpret federal law to preempt state protections exceeding federal standards. The floor presumption:

- preserves state/Regional policy experimentation
- prevents preemption arguments from blocking higher standards
- ensures federal law sets minimums, not maximums
- protects policy diversity

### Why Phased Transition?

Immediate implementation of all provisions would:

- overwhelm administrative capacity
- create legal uncertainty
- risk implementation failures
- generate opposition from disrupted institutions

Phased transition:

- allows orderly implementation
- builds capacity before activation
- maintains stability during change
- creates precedent for future amendments

### Why Immediate Provisions?

Some provisions cannot wait:

- **D.C. representation**: Citizens should not be disenfranchised during transition
- **Rights floors**: Fundamental protections cannot be delayed
- **Power expansion prohibition**: Prevents using transition to grab power
- **Amendment process**: Enables correction of implementation problems
- **Mandatory jurisdiction**: Ensures courts can enforce the Constitution
- **Two-key authorization**: Prevents misuse of military during vulnerable transition

### Why Separate Treatment of Non-State Entities?

The current Constitution:

- denies D.C. residents meaningful representation
- leaves territories in constitutional limbo
- undermines tribal sovereignty through inconsistent treatment

Separate treatment ensures:

- full representation for D.C. residents
- clear path to defined status for territories
- reaffirmation and protection of tribal sovereignty
- no entity left in constitutional uncertainty

### Why the "Bridge and Cliff" Integration Mechanism?

Without Section 4, territories and the District could rationally choose to remain indefinitely in at-large status:

- **The Perverse Incentive:** At-large Senators are dedicated exclusively to their constituents' interests, while joining a Region means sharing representation with larger states. A territory like Puerto Rico (3.2M people) might calculate that at-large status gives them *more* effective representation than being absorbed into a Region dominated by larger states.

- **The "Continued Territorial Status" Escape Hatch:** The Territories Status Determination Act (Section 24) explicitly allows indefinite continued territorial status with representation—no Regional integration required.

The "Bridge and Cliff" mechanism solves this through aligned incentives:

**The Bridge (Integration Bonus):**

- Makes territories a *prize* rather than a *burden*—Regions gain +1 Senate seat for 15 years
- Regions compete to court territories rather than avoiding them
- Territories retain dedicated representation during transition period
- Post-bonus guarantee for large territories prevents post-integration dilution

**The Cliff (Integration Timeline):**

- At-large voting rights expire after 5 years if unassigned
- Creates genuine urgency to complete integration
- Delegate status (voice, no vote) is a real demotion without being disenfranchisement
- Fiscal consequences add economic pressure

**The Orphan Safeguard:**

- Prevents Regions from colluding to reject territories and force them into delegate status
- "Fiscal Discrimination" finding allows ordered assignment
- Federal debt assumption removes the "hot potato" dynamic
- Anti-gaming provisions prevent territories from running up debt pre-integration

This mechanism ensures that:

- Both territories and Regions have positive incentives to integrate
- No territory is left in limbo through no fault of its own
- The 15-year bonus period allows political adjustment without permanent asymmetry
- Post-bonus guarantees protect large territories from dilution

## ARTICLE XXIII - INDIGENOUS SOVEREIGNTY PRESERVATION

*Resolves Gap 253 — Indigenous/Treaty Sovereignty. Establishes a three-sovereign framework explicitly protecting tribal sovereignty from Regional encroachment.*

### Section 1. Recognition of Tribal Sovereignty

(a) The sovereignty of Indigenous Nations and Tribes, as recognized by Treaty, Federal statute, and judicial precedent, is hereby affirmed and preserved.

(b) Indigenous Nations possess inherent powers of self-governance that predate this Constitution and are not granted by it.

(c) The Federal Government shall maintain its trust responsibility to Indigenous Nations. This responsibility may not be diminished, transferred, or delegated to Regions.

---

### Section 2. Federal Exclusivity

(a) Relations with Indigenous Nations, including but not limited to treaty obligations, trust responsibilities, and recognition matters, are the exclusive domain of the Federal Government.

(b) Neither Regions nor States may:

- (i) enter into treaties or agreements with Indigenous Nations that purport to alter federal treaty obligations;
- (ii) exercise jurisdiction over tribal lands except as authorized by federal law with tribal consent;
- (iii) impose taxes on tribal lands, tribal governments, or tribal members for activities occurring on tribal land;
- (iv) regulate tribal governance, membership, or internal affairs;
- (v) infringe upon tribal water rights, hunting and fishing rights, or other treaty-protected resources.

---

### Section 3. Treaty Supremacy

(a) Treaties between the United States and Indigenous Nations remain "the supreme Law of the Land" and take precedence over any Regional or State law.

(b) Regional laws that conflict with treaty obligations are void to the extent of the conflict.

(c) Ambiguities in treaties shall be construed in favor of the Indigenous Nations, consistent with the canons of treaty interpretation.

---

### Section 4. Tribal Consent Requirement

(a) No federal action that diminishes tribal sovereignty, alters reservation boundaries, or modifies treaty rights may occur without the free, prior, and informed consent of the affected Indigenous Nation(s).

(b) Tribal consent must be obtained through procedures established by the Indigenous Nation's own governance structure.

(c) Consent may not be coerced through threats to federal funding, services, or trust responsibilities.

---

### Section 5. Enforcement and Remedies

(a) Indigenous Nations shall have standing to challenge in federal court any Regional or State action that infringes upon tribal sovereignty or treaty rights.

(b) The burden of proof shall be on the Region or State to demonstrate that the challenged action does not infringe upon tribal rights.

(c) Courts shall enjoin Regional or State actions that violate this Article pending full adjudication.

(d) Regional officials who knowingly violate tribal sovereignty or treaty rights are personally liable and may be removed from office.

---

### Section 6. Coordination, Not Subordination

(a) Regions and Indigenous Nations are encouraged to enter into government-to-government compacts for mutual benefit on matters of shared concern.

(b) Such compacts may not diminish tribal sovereignty or treaty rights.

(c) The Federal Government shall facilitate Regional-Tribal cooperation through technical assistance and dispute resolution services.

---

### Section 7. Cross-Boundary Tribal Territories

(a) When a tribal territory spans multiple Regions, the Indigenous Nation retains unified sovereignty over its entire territory.

(b) Regions may not partition tribal territory or impose different requirements on different portions.

(c) The Federal Government shall coordinate with the Indigenous Nation and affected Regions to ensure consistent treatment.

---

### Section 8. Mandatory Consultation

*Resolves Gap 27 — Tribal-Regional Relations (operational framework). Adds mandatory consultation, off-reservation protections, compact negotiation standards, DLRS applicability, transition provisions, adjacent-impact safeguards, and IGC representation to complement the sovereignty protections in Sections 1-7.*

(a) **Duty to Consult.** Before taking any action that may significantly affect tribal interests, Regional governments shall:

- (1) identify Tribal Nations that may be affected;
- (2) notify those Tribal Nations of the proposed action with sufficient detail to enable meaningful response;
- (3) provide not less than sixty (60) days for tribal comment;
- (4) meet with tribal representatives upon request at times and locations reasonably convenient for tribal participation;
- (5) document consultation in writing and include the record in any administrative proceeding.

(b) **Triggering Actions.** "Significantly affect tribal interests" includes actions that:

- (1) affect tribal lands or waters, or areas adjacent thereto;
- (2) affect treaty-protected resources including hunting, fishing, and gathering rights;
- (3) affect tribal cultural resources, sacred sites, or ancestral remains;
- (4) affect transportation or infrastructure providing access to tribal lands;
- (5) affect environmental quality of areas where tribal members exercise treaty rights.

(c) **Genuine Consideration.** Consultation requires good-faith consideration of tribal views. Regions need not obtain tribal consent except where required by other provisions, but shall provide written explanation when declining to adopt tribal recommendations.

(d) **Emergency Exception.** In genuine emergencies requiring immediate action to protect public safety, Regions may act without prior consultation. Post-action consultation shall occur within thirty (30) days. If the Tribal Nation objects, the Region shall consider modifying or reversing the action.

(e) **Failure to Consult.** Actions taken without required consultation:

- (1) are voidable upon challenge by an affected Tribal Nation;
- (2) may be enjoined pending completion of consultation;
- (3) the Region bears all costs of delay resulting from its failure to consult.

---

### Section 9. Off-Reservation Protections

(a) **Service Access.** Tribal members residing off-reservation within a Region are entitled to:

- (1) Regional public services on the same terms as other residents;
- (2) recognition of tribal identification for purposes of Regional services;
- (3) non-discrimination based on tribal membership or affiliation.

(b) **Prohibited Discrimination.** Regional law may not:

- (1) discriminate against tribal members in employment, housing, or public accommodations;
- (2) treat tribal governments less favorably than similarly situated governments in the same program or service context, excluding differences required by treaty obligations or sovereign-specific procedures;
- (3) impose special burdens on businesses owned by tribal members or Tribal Nations operating off-reservation.

(c) **Adjacent-Area Protections.**

- (1) For purposes of this subsection, "material degradation" means a measurable decline in environmental quality — including air quality, water quality, soil integrity, or ecological function — as documented by federal, tribal, or independent environmental monitoring, that adversely affects tribal lands, treaty-protected resources, or areas where tribal members exercise treaty-protected rights;
- (2) Before taking any action that would cause material degradation of areas adjacent to tribal lands, a Region shall provide the affected Tribal Nation with notice and a ninety (90) day consultation period; where the action also triggers Section 8 consultation, the Region may satisfy both requirements concurrently by designating the consultation as addressing both Section 8 and Section 9(c) obligations, provided the ninety (90) day period of this subsection governs;
- (3) If the affected Tribal Nation objects, the Region may proceed only upon a federal court finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that: (i) the action serves a compelling public necessity; (ii) no feasible alternative exists that avoids or substantially reduces the adverse impact; and (iii) the Region has implemented all practicable mitigation measures;
- (4) Regions may not materially impair access to tribal lands through adjacent Regional territory;
- (5) Regions may not materially reduce water flow or water quality affecting tribal lands or treaty-protected fisheries;
- (6) In genuine emergencies requiring immediate action to protect public safety, a Region may take actions that may cause material degradation of adjacent areas without prior compliance with subsections (c)(2) and (c)(3); the Region shall provide written notice to the affected Tribal Nation within seventy-two (72) hours and complete post-action consultation within thirty (30) days; upon tribal objection, the Region shall seek federal court review within sixty (60) days, during which the court may order restoration or mitigation.

(d) **Enforcement.** Violations of this Section are actionable in federal court with the remedies of Section 5.

---

### Section 10. Coordination Compact Framework

(a) **Mandatory Compacts.** Pursuant to Article XX, Section 3(d), Regions and Tribal Nations shall negotiate compacts addressing:

- (1) shared services and infrastructure coordination;
- (2) emergency response and mutual aid;
- (3) law enforcement cooperation and jurisdictional boundaries;
- (4) environmental monitoring and resource management.

(b) **Anti-Coercion.** Regions may not:

- (1) condition Regional services to tribal members on compact terms;
- (2) withhold cooperation on one compact matter to gain leverage on another;
- (3) threaten fiscal, regulatory, or administrative retaliation for tribal negotiating positions.

(c) **Negotiation Timeline.**

- (1) Initial compacts shall be negotiated within two (2) years of Regional activation;
- (2) either party may request mediation through the Department of Interior after one (1) year;
- (3) mediation shall conclude within one hundred eighty (180) days.

(d) **Default Provisions.** If no compact is reached:

- (1) existing agreements between predecessor States and the Tribal Nation remain in effect;
- (2) the Region may not exercise any authority on tribal lands;
- (3) federal agencies shall provide services and coordination functions until compact is reached.

(e) **Compact Modification.** Compacts may be modified by mutual consent. Either party may request renegotiation after five (5) years.

---

### Section 11. DLRS and Transition

(a) **DLRS Applicability.**

- (1) Tribal Nations are not subject to Dual Legitimacy Rights Floor requirements except by consent through formal action of their governing body;
- (2) consent may be revoked by the same process;
- (3) partial consent (specific DLRS provisions only) is permitted;
- (4) DLRS applicability has no effect on other aspects of the Tribal Nation's relationship with the United States or Regions.

(b) **Successor Agreements.** Agreements between predecessor States and Tribal Nations:

- (1) transfer to successor Regions upon Regional activation;
- (2) remain in full force until modified by mutual consent or expiration;
- (3) either party may request renegotiation within three (3) years of Regional activation; if the other party declines, the requesting party may invoke mediation under Section 10(c).

(c) **Gaming Compacts.** Gaming compacts under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act:

- (1) transfer to successor Regions;
- (2) Regions shall negotiate renewals in good faith;
- (3) good-faith negotiation requires Regions to respond to tribal proposals within sixty (60) days, provide substantive counterproposals rather than blanket refusals, and refrain from conditioning renewal on concessions unrelated to gaming operations;
- (4) if a Region fails to respond to a tribal gaming compact proposal within the sixty (60) day period of subsection (c)(3), the Tribal Nation may invoke mediation under Section 10(c); the Region's non-response creates a rebuttable presumption of bad faith in mediation proceedings.

(d) **Federal Program Continuity.** When federal programs are block-granted to Regions:

- (1) tribal set-asides shall be maintained at pre-transition levels, adjusted for population;
- (2) Tribal Nations may elect direct federal funding where available;
- (3) Regions may not impose conditions on tribal use of federal funds beyond those in federal law.

---

### Section 12. Intergovernmental Council Representation

(a) **IGC Tribal Seat.** For any federal-Regional council, board, or commission established under this Constitution or by federal law whose policy domain directly and substantially affects tribal lands, resources, or treaty rights:

- (1) at least one voting seat shall be reserved for a representative of Tribal Nations;
- (2) the President shall appoint such representative in consultation with the National Congress of American Indians or successor organization representing federally recognized tribes; if no single representative organization is recognized, the President shall appoint from among candidates nominated by a majority of federally recognized Tribal Nations within the affected Region(s), or, for bodies of national scope, by a majority of all federally recognized Tribal Nations nationwide;
- (3) the tribal representative shall have full participation rights including voting, committee membership, and access to information.

(b) **Domain Determination.** The ARB shall certify which federal-Regional bodies "directly and substantially affect" tribal interests. This certification:

- (1) shall be issued within ninety (90) days of a request by any Tribal Nation or the body in question;
- (2) is binding absent clear error;
- (3) shall be reconsidered if the body's jurisdiction materially changes;
- (4) may be reviewed by the NCC upon petition by any Tribal Nation; review is limited to whether the ARB applied the correct legal standard and whether the certification is supported by substantial evidence.

(c) **Non-Voting Observers.** Federal-Regional bodies not certified under subsection (b) shall nonetheless permit non-voting tribal observers when:

- (1) a Tribal Nation demonstrates substantial interest in the body's proceedings;
- (2) the observation does not compromise national security or law enforcement operations.

---

## ARTICLE XXIV - UNION PERMANENCE AND ORDERLY ALTERATION

### Section 1. Perpetual Union

(a) The Union of the Regions under this Constitution is perpetual and indissoluble.

(b) No Region may unilaterally secede, withdraw, or declare independence from the United States.

- (iii) engage in good-faith negotiation with the Federal Government for at least one (1) year.

(b) If any requirement of this section is not met, the amendment process may not proceed.

---

### Section 5. Consequences of Attempted Secession

(b) Any Region that attempts unilateral secession:

- (i) forfeits all representation in Congress during the period of rebellion;

(b) Failure to meet these obligations may be raised as grounds to pause the alteration process.

---

- (ii) disposition of federal property within the Region;
- (iii) citizenship status of persons in the Region;
- (iv) treaty obligations and international commitments;
- (v) defense arrangements and military assets;
- (vi) currency, monetary, and fiscal transition.

(b) These matters shall be resolved before independence takes effect.

---

## ARTICLE XXV - FEDERAL DISTRICT INDEPENDENCE

*Resolves Gap 255 — Federal District Vulnerability. Ensures the Federal Government cannot be held hostage by surrounding Regions through infrastructure, security, or economic pressure.*
