# Supremacy and Transition

## Articles XVIII-XX: Supremacy, Transition, and Non-State Entities

*This document contains the supremacy, transition, and non-state entity provisions of the Regional Federal Constitution.*

---

## ARTICLE XVIII - SUPREMACY AND CONSTRUCTION

### Section 1. Enumerated Powers Supremacy

Only powers expressly granted to the federal government by this Constitution are valid exercises of federal authority. This section reinforces Article II, Section 1; powers not enumerated to the federal government are reserved to the Regions, States, or the People.

---

### Section 2. Floor Presumption

Rights and standards shall be construed as floors unless explicitly stated otherwise.

---

### Section 3. Interpretive Conventions

(a) Capitalized terms "Region," "State," "Tribal Nation," and "Territory" refer to constitutional entities established or recognized by this Constitution.

(b) "Tribal Nation" means a federally recognized Tribal Nation unless otherwise specified. The inherent sovereignty acknowledged in Article XX, Section 3 is not limited to federally recognized Tribal Nations, but constitutional protections and coordination requirements under this Constitution apply to federally recognized Tribal Nations as a matter of practical administration. See Article XXII, Section 1(d).

(c) References to "Regional" institutions (Regional Governor, Regional legislature, Regional courts) use initial capitalization to denote constitutional status.

(d) "Federal" refers to the national government of the United States.

## ARTICLE XIX - RATIFICATION AND TRANSITION

### Section 1. Effect Upon Ratification

This amendment package shall take effect upon ratification pursuant to its own terms.

---

### Section 2. Transition Authority

(a) Notwithstanding Section 1, certain operational provisions of this Constitution may be activated in phases pursuant to transition legislation enacted prior to ratification, provided such legislation:

- is enacted by both chambers of Congress and signed by the President prior to ratification,
- specifies a maximum transition period not exceeding four years from ratification,
- does not delay the immediate provisions identified in Section 3,
- does not expand existing governmental authority beyond that permitted under the prior Constitution.

(b) Transition legislation shall govern sequencing and continuity during the transition period but may not claim supremacy over this Constitution. Any conflict between transition legislation and this Constitution shall be resolved in favor of this Constitution.

(c) Transition legislation expires automatically upon completion of the transition period and may not be extended.

---

### Section 3. Immediate Provisions

The following provisions take effect immediately upon ratification and may not be delayed by transition legislation:

---

## ARTICLE XX - NON-STATE ENTITIES

### Section 1. District of Columbia

(a) The District of Columbia shall be entitled to representation in Congress as if it were a State, including Representatives apportioned by population and two Senators. This representation is immediate upon ratification.

(b) **Transitional Senate Representation.** Until Regional assignment is completed, District Senators serve as at-large members of the Senate with full voting rights. Upon Regional assignment, District Senators join the assigned Region's delegation for purposes of Senate organization, while continuing to be elected by District residents.

(c) Within five years, Congress shall determine the District's permanent status: admission as a State with Regional assignment, or Regional assignment while preserving federal district status.

(d) Regional assignment requires approval by two-thirds of the receiving Region's legislature and by majority referendum of District residents. No assignment may take effect within one year before or six months after a federal presidential election.

(e) Implementation procedures are established by statute. See the [D.C. Status Determination Act](../../proposals/dc-status-determination-act.md) for the proposed implementing legislation.

---

### Section 2. Territories

(a) Residents of United States territories shall be entitled to participate in federal elections and to Congressional representation. Congress shall assign each territory to a Region based on geographic proximity, historical connection, or economic integration.

(b) **Transitional Congressional Representation.** Until Regional assignment is completed:

- (1) each territory shall elect at least one Representative apportioned by population;
- (2) each territory shall elect two Senators with full voting rights;
- (3) territorial Senators serve as at-large members of the Senate, not assigned to any Regional delegation;
- (4) upon Regional assignment, territorial Senators join the assigned Region's delegation for purposes of Senate organization.

(c) Regional assignment requires approval by two-thirds of the receiving Region's legislature and may be rejected by territorial referendum. No assignment may take effect within one year before or six months after a federal presidential election.

(d) Congress shall establish a clear path for each territory to petition for statehood, Regional assignment without statehood, or continued territorial status with defined representation. No territory may be held indefinitely without a defined governance status.

(e) Implementation procedures are established by statute. See the [Territories Status Determination Act](../../proposals/territories-status-act.md) for the proposed implementing legislation.

---

### Section 3. Tribal Nations

(a) The inherent sovereignty of federally recognized Tribal Nations is hereby reaffirmed. Tribal Nations possess original sovereignty that predates this Constitution and exists independent of federal recognition.

(b) Tribal Nations are not subordinate political subdivisions of the federal government, Regions, States, or territories. The relationship between the United States and Tribal Nations is government-to-government, nation-to-nation.

(c) Tribal lands remain under tribal jurisdiction. Federal authority over tribal lands is limited to that arising from treaties, trust responsibilities, and powers expressly consented to by Tribal Nations. Regional and State authority does not extend to tribal lands except by consent of the affected Tribal Nation.

(d) Regions and Tribal Nations shall enter into compacts for coordination of shared services, infrastructure, and emergency response. Such compacts shall be negotiated in good faith and shall respect tribal sovereignty.

(e) Tribal Nations may, at their option, designate representatives to participate in Regional assemblies. The nature of such participation (voting, non-voting, observer) shall be determined by agreement between each Tribal Nation and the relevant Region.

(f) Nothing in this Constitution diminishes any treaty rights, trust responsibilities, or obligations of the United States to Tribal Nations.

## Design Rationale

### Why Enumerated Powers Supremacy?

The federal government has expanded far beyond original enumerated powers through:

- implied powers doctrine
- commerce clause expansion
- spending power coercion
- emergency powers accumulation

Enumerated powers supremacy:

- restores meaningful federalism
- creates enforceable boundaries
- prevents creeping centralization
- protects Regional and State authority

### Why Floor Presumption?

Without explicit floor presumption, courts may interpret federal law to preempt state protections exceeding federal standards. The floor presumption:

- preserves state/Regional policy experimentation
- prevents preemption arguments from blocking higher standards
- ensures federal law sets minimums, not maximums
- protects policy diversity

### Why Phased Transition?

Immediate implementation of all provisions would:

- overwhelm administrative capacity
- create legal uncertainty
- risk implementation failures
- generate opposition from disrupted institutions

Phased transition:

- allows orderly implementation
- builds capacity before activation
- maintains stability during change
- creates precedent for future amendments

### Why Immediate Provisions?

Some provisions cannot wait:

- **D.C. representation**: Citizens should not be disenfranchised during transition
- **Rights floors**: Fundamental protections cannot be delayed
- **Power expansion prohibition**: Prevents using transition to grab power
- **Amendment process**: Enables correction of implementation problems
- **Mandatory jurisdiction**: Ensures courts can enforce the Constitution
- **Two-key authorization**: Prevents misuse of military during vulnerable transition

### Why Separate Treatment of Non-State Entities?

The current Constitution:

- denies D.C. residents meaningful representation
- leaves territories in constitutional limbo
- undermines tribal sovereignty through inconsistent treatment

Separate treatment ensures:

- full representation for D.C. residents
- clear path to defined status for territories
- reaffirmation and protection of tribal sovereignty
- no entity left in constitutional uncertainty
