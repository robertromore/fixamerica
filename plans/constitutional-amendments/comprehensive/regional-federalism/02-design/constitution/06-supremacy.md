## ARTICLE XX - NON-STATE ENTITIES

### Section 1. District of Columbia

(a) The District of Columbia shall be entitled to representation in Congress as if it were a State:

(1) Representatives in the House apportioned by population according to the same formula applied to States.

(2) Two Senators, elected by the residents of the District according to procedures established by statute.

(3) This representation is immediate upon ratification and does not depend on Regional assignment.

(4) Until Congress establishes election procedures, Senators shall be elected in the same manner as Representatives, with the two candidates receiving the most votes in a general election being elected.

(b) Within five years of ratification, Congress shall by statute either:

- admit the District as a State and assign it to a Region, or
- assign the District to a Region for purposes of Regional governance while preserving its unique federal district status.

(c) Regional assignment of the District shall require:

- approval by a two-thirds vote of the receiving Region's legislature, and
- approval by a majority of District residents voting in a referendum on the assignment.

No assignment may be enacted, amended, or take effect within one year before or six months after a federal presidential election.

(d) Until such determination:

- For presidential elections: residents of the District shall vote as part of the national popular vote; their votes are counted nationally, not assigned to any Region.
- For congressional elections: the District elects its own Representatives and Senators as provided in subsection (a).
- For Regional governance matters: the District is not subject to Regional authority until Congress makes a determination under subsection (b).

### Section 2. Territories

(a) Residents of United States territories shall be entitled to participate in federal elections. Congress shall by statute assign each territory to a Region for purposes of such participation.

(b) Regional assignment of territories shall be governed by the following constraints:

(1) Assignment must be based on geographic proximity, historical connection, or economic integration. No territory may be assigned to a Region with which it shares no such connection.

(2) Assignment requires approval by a two-thirds vote of the receiving Region's legislature.

(3) No territory assignment may be enacted, amended, or take effect within one year before or six months after a federal presidential election.

(4) The territory's residents shall have the opportunity to approve or reject Regional assignment by referendum. Rejection does not prevent federal election participation but delays Regional governance integration until a subsequent assignment is approved.

(c) Congress shall by statute establish a clear path for each territory to:

- petition for statehood and subsequent Regional assignment,
- petition for Regional assignment without statehood,
- or continue territorial status with defined representation rights.

(d) No territory may be held indefinitely without a defined governance status. Congress shall act on any territorial petition within five years.

---

### Section 3. Tribal Nations

(a) The sovereignty of federally recognized Tribal Nations is hereby reaffirmed. Tribal Nations are not subordinate to Regions.

(b) Tribal lands remain under tribal and federal jurisdiction. Regional authority does not extend to tribal lands except by consent of the affected Tribal Nation.

(c) Regions and Tribal Nations shall enter into compacts for coordination of shared services, infrastructure, and emergency response. Such compacts shall be negotiated in good faith and shall respect tribal sovereignty.

(d) Tribal Nations may, at their option, designate representatives to participate in Regional assemblies. The nature of such participation (voting, non-voting, observer) shall be determined by agreement between each Tribal Nation and the relevant Region.

(e) Nothing in this Constitution diminishes any treaty rights, trust responsibilities, or obligations of the United States to Tribal Nations.

## Design Rationale

### Why Enumerated Powers Supremacy?

The federal government has expanded far beyond original enumerated powers through:

- implied powers doctrine
- commerce clause expansion
- spending power coercion
- emergency powers accumulation

Enumerated powers supremacy:

- restores meaningful federalism
- creates enforceable boundaries
- prevents creeping centralization
- protects Regional and State authority

### Why Floor Presumption?

Without explicit floor presumption, courts may interpret federal law to preempt state protections exceeding federal standards. The floor presumption:

- preserves state/Regional policy experimentation
- prevents "race to the bottom" arguments from blocking higher standards
- ensures federal law sets minimums, not maximums
- protects policy diversity

### Why Phased Transition?

Immediate implementation of all provisions would:

- overwhelm administrative capacity
- create legal uncertainty
- risk implementation failures
- generate opposition from disrupted institutions

Phased transition:

- allows orderly implementation
- builds capacity before activation
- maintains stability during change
- creates precedent for future amendments

### Why Immediate Provisions?

Some provisions cannot wait:

- **D.C. representation**: Citizens should not be disenfranchised during transition
- **Rights floors**: Fundamental protections cannot be delayed
- **Power expansion prohibition**: Prevents using transition to grab power
- **Amendment process**: Enables correction of implementation problems
- **Mandatory jurisdiction**: Ensures courts can enforce the Constitution
- **Two-key authorization**: Prevents misuse of military during vulnerable transition

### Why Separate Treatment of Non-State Entities?

The current Constitution:

- denies D.C. residents meaningful representation
- leaves territories in constitutional limbo
- undermines tribal sovereignty through inconsistent treatment

Separate treatment ensures:

- full representation for D.C. residents
- clear path to defined status for territories
- reaffirmation and protection of tribal sovereignty
- no entity left in constitutional uncertainty
