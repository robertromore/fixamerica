## Relationship to RF Core

These amendments are designed to:

1. **Stand alone**: Each can be adopted without the Regional Federal Constitution
2. **Integrate**: If RF Core is adopted, these amendments supplement it as specified in the [Article Crosswalk](../constitution/article-crosswalk.md)
3. **Address specific reforms**: Each targets a discrete area of constitutional dysfunction

## Citation Guidance

When citing standalone amendments:
- Use the Article number (e.g., "Article VII" for Election Reform)
- Link to the specific amendment file, not the RF Core constitution index
- Note whether the amendment is adopted standalone or as part of RF integration
