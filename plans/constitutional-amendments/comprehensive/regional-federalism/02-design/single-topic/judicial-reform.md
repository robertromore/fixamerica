## Article XIV — Judicial Reform

### Section 1. Supreme Court Structure

(a) The Supreme Court of the United States shall consist of nine Justices, one of whom shall serve as Chief Justice.

(b) The number of Justices may be changed only by constitutional amendment. Congress shall have no power to alter the size of the Supreme Court by statute.

(c) The Supreme Court shall sit en banc for all cases. No statute or rule may provide for panels, divisions, or rotation systems that prevent all Justices from hearing a case.

### Section 2. Term Limits for Supreme Court Justices

(a) Each Justice of the Supreme Court shall serve a single term of eighteen years.

(b) Terms shall be staggered such that one vacancy occurs every two years in the first and third years of each presidential term. If a vacancy occurs at an irregular time due to death, resignation, removal, or incapacity, the replacement Justice shall serve only the remainder of the unexpired term.

(c) Upon completion of their term, former Justices may serve as Senior Justices on lower federal courts or be assigned by the Chief Justice to sit by designation on Circuit Courts of Appeals, but may not return to the Supreme Court.

(d) No person who has served as a Justice of the Supreme Court for more than nine years shall be eligible for appointment to another term.

### Section 3. Appointment Process

(a) The President shall nominate Justices of the Supreme Court with the advice and consent of the Senate.

(b) The Senate shall hold hearings on any nomination within sixty days of submission. The Senate shall vote on the nomination within thirty days of the conclusion of hearings.

(c) If the Senate fails to act within the time limits specified in subsection (b), the nomination shall be deemed confirmed.

(d) No person shall be eligible for appointment as a Justice who has not served at least ten years as a judge on a federal court, the highest court of a State, or a combination thereof.

### Section 4. Mandatory Jurisdiction

(a) The Supreme Court shall have mandatory jurisdiction over:

(1) cases challenging the constitutionality of a federal statute;

(2) cases in which a State or Regional court has held a federal statute unconstitutional;

(3) cases involving a direct conflict between Circuit Courts of Appeals on a question of federal law;

(4) cases involving the interpretation of this Constitution that present a substantial federal question.

(b) For cases within mandatory jurisdiction, the Supreme Court shall issue a decision on the merits. Denial of certiorari or dismissal without decision is not permitted.

(c) The Supreme Court shall retain discretionary jurisdiction for all other cases arising under federal law or the Constitution.

### Section 5. Time Limits for Decisions

(a) The Supreme Court shall issue decisions in all cases within one year of granting review.

(b) Circuit Courts of Appeals shall issue decisions within one hundred eighty days of the completion of briefing and oral argument.

(c) District Courts shall rule on dispositive motions within ninety days of full briefing.

(d) If a court fails to issue a decision within the time limits specified in this section, any party may petition the next higher court for a writ of mandamus, which shall issue as of right upon showing the time limit has expired.

### Section 6. Effective Remedies

(a) Every person who suffers a violation of rights secured by this Constitution shall have access to a court of competent jurisdiction and shall be entitled to an effective remedy.

(b) No doctrine of immunity, standing, ripeness, mootness, or political question shall be construed to deny all remedies to a person whose constitutional rights have been violated.

(c) If traditional remedies are unavailable due to doctrinal limitations, courts shall fashion such alternative relief as will provide meaningful redress and deter future violations.

### Section 7. Self-Executing Default Rules

(a) If any branch of government fails to perform a duty required by this Constitution or by statute within a time limit established by law, the following default rules shall take effect automatically:

(1) For executive non-enforcement: private parties may bring suit to compel enforcement, and courts shall have jurisdiction to issue mandatory injunctions;

(2) For legislative inaction where this Constitution requires legislation: the most recent expired provision shall remain in effect, or if none exists, the court shall have power to issue interim rules until Congress acts;

(3) For judicial delay beyond time limits in Section 5: the judgment below shall be affirmed by operation of law, unless the higher court issues a stay supported by written findings of exceptional circumstances.

(b) Default rules under this section are temporary measures and shall be superseded when the relevant branch performs its constitutional duty.

### Section 8. Lower Federal Courts

(a) Congress shall establish inferior courts as necessary for the fair and efficient administration of justice.

(b) Judges of inferior federal courts shall be appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate and shall hold their offices during good behavior.

(c) Congress may not reduce the number of judgeships on any court below the number necessary to dispose of the court's caseload within the time limits established by Section 5.

(d) The Judicial Conference of the United States shall annually certify to Congress the number of judgeships necessary for each court to meet time limits. If Congress fails to act on the certification within one year, the positions shall be deemed authorized.

### Section 9. Judicial Ethics and Accountability

(a) All federal judges shall be bound by a code of judicial conduct established by the Judicial Conference and approved by the Supreme Court.

(b) The code shall require recusal in cases presenting a conflict of interest or the appearance thereof, financial disclosure, and restrictions on extrajudicial activities.

(c) Violations of the code of conduct shall be grounds for discipline, including private reprimand, public censure, temporary suspension, or referral to Congress for impeachment proceedings.

(d) A Judicial Conduct Council, consisting of judges appointed by the Chief Justice, shall investigate complaints and impose discipline short of removal.

### Section 10. Prohibition on Court Packing

(a) No statute enacted within four years after a change in the party controlling the Presidency or Senate may alter the size of any federal court.

(b) Any statute altering the number of judges on any federal court shall require a two-thirds vote of both Houses of Congress.

(c) This section shall not apply to the creation of new courts to serve new geographic areas or specialized subject matter jurisdictions.

### Section 11. Preservation of Judicial Independence

(a) The compensation of federal judges shall not be diminished during their continuance in office and shall be adjusted annually to maintain its real value.

(b) No federal judge may be reassigned, have their jurisdiction reduced, or have their chambers relocated as a consequence of decisions rendered.

(c) Congress shall appropriate funds sufficient to operate the federal courts and shall not use appropriations to coerce judicial outcomes.

### Section 12. Quorum Protection

(a) **Quorum Preservation Duty.** Justices shall not recuse in a manner that would reduce the Court below quorum unless:

(1) A direct, personal financial interest exists in the outcome;

(2) A close family member (spouse, child, parent, sibling) is a named party;

(3) The Justice previously served as counsel of record in the specific matter before the Court.

(b) **Recusal Certification.** Any recusal that would reduce the Court below quorum requires:

(1) Written certification of the specific conflict under subsection (a);

(2) Review by the Chief Justice (or senior Associate Justice if Chief recuses);

(3) Publication of the recusal grounds within seventy-two hours.

(c) **Emergency Quorum Restoration.** If recusals and vacancies reduce the Supreme Court below quorum for any case:

(1) The Chief Justice shall certify a "Quorum Emergency" within forty-eight hours;

(2) The Chief Justice shall designate the senior-most Chief Judge of a Circuit Court of Appeals not already on the Supreme Court as a Temporary Justice for the specific case;

(3) Temporary Justices have full voting authority on the designated case but their participation terminates upon case disposition.

(d) **Case Progression Guarantee.** No case may be delayed more than one hundred twenty days due to quorum issues:

(1) If quorum cannot be achieved within one hundred twenty days, the lower court ruling stands as the final judgment;

(2) The Supreme Court may grant rehearing when quorum is restored;

(3) Lower court affirmance under this section does not create binding precedent.

(e) **Prohibited Coordination.** Justices may not communicate with other Justices for the purpose of coordinating recusals or agree to recuse in exchange for another Justice's recusal.

### Section 13. Vacancy Acceleration

(a) **Presidential Nomination Deadline.** When a Supreme Court vacancy occurs, the President shall submit a nomination within sixty days.

(b) **Senate Action Deadline.** The Senate shall hold hearings within sixty days of nomination and shall vote within ninety days of nomination.

(c) **Default Confirmation.** If the Senate fails to vote within ninety days:

(1) The President's nominee is deemed confirmed;

(2) The nominee takes office immediately;

(3) The Senate may subsequently vote to remove by two-thirds majority within one hundred eighty days.

(d) **Multiple Vacancy Protocol.** When two or more vacancies exist simultaneously:

(1) The President shall submit all nominations within sixty days;

(2) The Senate may hold combined or sequential hearings;

(3) The ninety-day deadline applies separately to each nomination.

### Section 14. Judicial Nominating Commissions

(a) **Establishment.** Each State (or Region, if Regional Federalism is adopted) shall establish a non-partisan Judicial Nominating Commission:

(1) Consisting of members appointed by the Governor, Legislature, and State Bar Association in equal thirds;

(2) Members serve staggered six-year terms and may not hold partisan office;

(3) The Commission shall maintain a roster of qualified judicial candidates.

(b) **Nomination List Requirement.** When a judicial seat reserved for a specific State or Region becomes vacant:

(1) The relevant Nominating Commission shall submit a list of at least three qualified candidates within thirty days;

(2) The President must select from the Commission's list;

(3) The President may request additional candidates but may not reject the entire list without cause.

(c) **Automatic Seating.** If the President fails to nominate from the Commission list within sixty days:

(1) The Commission's top-ranked candidate is automatically nominated;

(2) If the Senate fails to vote within an additional sixty days, the candidate is automatically seated.

(d) **Diversity Monitoring.** The Judicial Conference shall monitor vacancy duration and nomination patterns. If any State or Region has vacancies exceeding fifty percent of its allocated seats for more than one year, automatic appointment timelines reduce to thirty days.

### Section 15. Separation of Adjudication

(a) **Independent Adjudicator Requirement.** No person may be deprived of private rights (including professional licenses, regulatory penalties, or property interests) except upon determination by an adjudicator who:

(1) is not employed by, appointed by, or removable at will by the agency or entity bringing the enforcement action;

(2) has compensation independent of agency control or influence;

(3) has no career advancement dependent on agency satisfaction with adjudicatory outcomes.

(b) **Private Rights Defined.** For purposes of this section, "private rights" include:

(1) professional and occupational licenses;

(2) civil monetary penalties exceeding 1,000 Federal Penalty Units;

(3) property seizures or forfeitures;

(4) immigration removal proceedings;

(5) benefit determinations affecting vested interests (including benefits for which eligibility has been established by statute, contract, or prior adjudication);

(6) any proceeding where the agency seeks remedies traditionally available only from courts.

(c) **Administrative Courts Authorized.** This section does not prohibit specialized administrative courts, provided such courts:

(1) are structurally independent from enforcement agencies;

(2) have judges appointed through merit selection with tenure protection;

(3) are supervised by the judiciary, not executive agencies;

(4) follow procedures substantially similar to federal court rules.

(d) **Existing ALJ Systems.** Within five (5) years of ratification:

(1) all federal ALJs shall be transferred to an independent Administrative Court system under Article III supervision;

(2) Regional ALJ systems (if Regional Federalism is adopted) or State ALJ systems shall comply with the independence requirements of this section within the same five-year transition period;

(3) proceedings commenced after the transition period before non-compliant adjudicators are voidable; proceedings concluded before the transition period remain valid under prior law.

For purposes of this section, "Article III supervision" means budgetary authority, disciplinary oversight, and rulemaking control vested in the federal judiciary rather than executive agencies.

(e) **De Novo Review Right.** Any person subject to adverse determination by an adjudicator shall have the right to de novo review by an Article III court upon:

(1) prima facie showing that the adjudicator failed to meet independence requirements; or

(2) prima facie showing that constitutional rights were violated in the proceeding.

A prima facie showing requires specific factual allegations demonstrating structural non-independence or procedural violation; bare assertions are insufficient to trigger de novo review.

(f) **Anti-Evasion.** Agencies may not circumvent this section by:

(1) requiring "consent" to administrative adjudication as condition of licensure;

(2) structuring penalties to fall below private rights thresholds;

(3) characterizing deprivations as "public rights" to avoid adjudicator independence requirements.

### Section 16. Injunctive Relief Scope and Anti-Forum Shopping

(a) **District Court Scope Limitation.** A single federal district court may not issue injunctive relief against enforcement of any federal statute, regulation, or executive action that extends beyond the parties before the court and the judicial district in which the court sits, except as provided in subsection (b).

(b) **Nationwide Relief Through Elevated Courts.** Injunctive relief extending beyond a single judicial district may be issued only by:

(1) the Supreme Court;

(2) a panel of not fewer than three federal judges, as provided by law; or

(3) a court exercising jurisdiction under Section 4 of Article XIV-RF (Provisional Relief) for constitutional-structure claims within that section's scope.

The requirement of a multi-judge panel does not apply to relief limited to the named parties.

(c) **Automatic Stay for Non-Constitutional Cases.** When a district court issues injunctive relief against federal action in cases outside the scope of Article XIV-RF, Section 4 (statutory, regulatory, and administrative challenges):

(1) the injunction is automatically stayed upon the government's filing of notice of appeal;

(2) the stay continues unless the appellate court affirms within sixty (60) days;

(3) this subsection does not apply to cases on the Expedited Review Track under Article XIV-RF, Section 4.

(d) **Anti-Forum Shopping.** Challenges to federal policy:

(1) must be filed in a district with substantial connection to the challenger's residence, principal place of business, or the locus of the challenged conduct;

(2) may be consolidated by the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, as provided by law, for coordinated proceedings;

(3) a pattern of filing in districts unconnected to challengers creates rebuttable presumption of forum shopping.

(e) **Effective Remedies Preservation.** Nothing in this section limits the authority of courts to provide effective remedies under Section 6 of this Article. The scope limitations in subsection (a) are procedural requirements for obtaining nationwide relief, not substantive limitations on the remedies available through the elevated courts identified in subsection (b).

(f) **Serial Litigation Coordination.** When substantially similar challenges to the same federal action are filed in multiple districts:

(1) the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation, as provided by law, shall consolidate such challenges for coordinated pretrial proceedings;

(2) a court may impose sanctions for vexatious litigation where a party files challenges substantially similar to claims previously adjudicated on the merits, under standards established by the Federal Rules or by law;

(3) consolidation does not limit any party's right to trial in the transferor district upon completion of coordinated proceedings.

## Relationship to RF Core

If the Regional Federal Constitution is adopted:

- Article XIV integrates as specified in [Article Crosswalk](../constitution/article-crosswalk.md)
- Regional courts are established by [Article XIV-RF](../constitution/09-judiciary.md)
- Specialized courts (ARB, National Water Court) are added for RF-specific disputes

If adopted standalone:

- Article XIV applies to the existing federal court system
- States retain authority over state courts
- No Regional court tier exists

## Design Rationale

### Why 18-Year Terms?

- Long enough to insulate Justices from political pressure
- Short enough to ensure regular turnover and democratic accountability
- Staggered terms mean each President appoints two Justices per term
- Eliminates strategic retirement timing
- Reduces stakes of any single appointment

### Why Mandatory Jurisdiction?

- Ensures constitutional questions receive authoritative resolution
- Prevents Supreme Court from avoiding controversial issues through certiorari denial
- Circuit splits must be resolved, promoting uniform federal law

### Why Time Limits?

- Justice delayed is justice denied
- Creates accountability without compromising independence
- Self-executing defaults prevent indefinite delay as a tactic

### Why Court Size Protection?

- Prevents court-packing as political retaliation
- Supermajority requirement ensures bipartisan support for changes
- Four-year waiting period after power shifts prevents reactive expansion

### Why Quorum Protection?

- Prevents "pocket nullification" through coordinated strategic recusals
- Narrow recusal grounds prevent pretextual withdrawals
- Emergency restoration using Circuit Chief Judges ensures cases are decided
- 120-day hard deadline prevents indefinite delay

### Why Vacancy Acceleration?

- Prevents weaponized vacancy maintenance
- Default confirmation defeats Senate obstruction while preserving removal option
- Multiple vacancy protocol addresses compound crises

### Why Judicial Nominating Commissions?

- Non-partisan commissions provide qualified candidate pools
- List requirement constrains Presidential discretion to qualified candidates
- Automatic seating defeats both Presidential and Senate obstruction
- Diversity monitoring detects and addresses geographic packing

### Why Separation of Adjudication?

- **Structural bias is endemic**: ALJs employed by agencies deciding cases brought by those agencies have 90%+ "conviction" rates—not because respondents are always wrong, but because the system is rigged
- **"No man may be judge in his own cause"**: Violates fundamental due process principle recognized since *Dr. Bonham's Case* (1610) and *Tumey v. Ohio* (1927)
- **Scale of impact**: ~2,000 federal ALJs decide Social Security, immigration, securities, and environmental cases affecting millions annually
- **Structural independence preserves expertise**: Independent administrative courts can still employ specialized judges; independence from enforcement agencies does not require generalist adjudication
- **Private rights threshold**: Focuses protection on significant deprivations (licenses, major penalties, property, deportation) while allowing streamlined procedures for minor matters
- **Transition period**: Five years allows orderly transfer without disrupting pending cases; voidability applies only to post-transition non-compliant proceedings
- **Prima facie gate for de novo review**: Prevents automatic relitigation while preserving meaningful access when structural violations occur

**Political Feasibility Note**: This reform will face resistance from executive agencies (lose control over outcomes), the administrative law bar (disrupts established practice), and parts of the judiciary (increased caseload). This is acknowledged as high-conflict structural reform requiring coalition-building with civil liberties advocates, regulated industries frustrated by agency bias, and judicial reformers.
