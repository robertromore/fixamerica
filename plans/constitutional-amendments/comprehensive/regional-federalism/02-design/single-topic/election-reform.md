## Article VII — Elections and Democratic Legitimacy

### Section 1. Right to Vote

(a) The right of citizens of the United States, who are eighteen years of age or older, to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State or Region on account of race, color, previous condition of servitude, sex, age, or failure to pay any poll tax or other tax.

(b) Every citizen shall have equal access to voter registration and voting, including early voting, absentee voting, and same-day registration.

(c) No State or Region shall impose voter identification requirements that create an undue burden on the right to vote.

### Section 2. Electoral System

(a) The President and Vice President shall be elected by national popular vote using ranked-choice voting.

(b) If no candidate receives a majority of first-choice votes, an instant runoff shall be conducted by eliminating the candidate with the fewest votes and redistributing those votes according to voters' next preferences, until one candidate receives a majority.

(c) The Electoral College is hereby abolished.

### Section 3. Congressional Elections

(a) Members of the House of Representatives shall be elected from multi-member districts using proportional representation or ranked-choice voting, as Congress shall provide by law.

(b) Members of the Senate shall be elected by ranked-choice voting within each State or Region.

(c) Congressional redistricting shall be conducted by independent commissions as provided by the Independent Redistricting Commission Act.

### Section 4. Independent Election Commission

(a) There is hereby established an Independent Election Commission (IEC) to administer federal elections.

(b) The IEC shall consist of [number] members appointed for staggered [term-length] terms, with no more than [number] members from any single political party.

(c) The IEC shall have authority to:
    (1) Establish uniform standards for federal election administration;
    (2) Certify voting systems and election procedures;
    (3) Investigate and remedy violations of federal election law;
    (4) Provide guidance to State and Regional election officials.

### Section 5. Campaign Finance

(a) Congress shall have power to regulate the raising and spending of money in federal elections, including by setting reasonable limits on contributions and expenditures.

(b) All contributions and expenditures intended to influence federal elections shall be publicly disclosed within [timeframe].

(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the free speech rights of individuals acting in their personal capacity.

### Section 6. Election Security

(a) All voting systems used in federal elections shall produce a voter-verified paper record.

(b) Post-election audits shall be conducted for all federal elections using statistically rigorous methods.

(c) The IEC shall establish cybersecurity standards for election infrastructure.

### Section 7. Certification and Escrow

#### Certification Options

(a) **Certification Options.** Within twenty-one (21) days of an election, each State or Regional Certification Authority shall either:

(1) **Certify** the results, attesting that the election was conducted according to law and the results accurately reflect votes cast;

(2) **Refuse to certify** with a written statement of specific deficiencies, triggering the procedures in Section 7(d); or

(3) **Place results in Certification Escrow** pursuant to this section.

(b) **Certification Escrow.** A State or Regional Certification Authority may place results in Certification Escrow only upon:

(1) A written finding, supported by specific evidence, that fraud, systematic error, or other irregularity may have affected more than one percent (1%) of ballots cast; and

(2) Simultaneous filing of an Integrity Challenge with the National Election Court.

(c) **Effect of Escrow.** Results placed in Certification Escrow:

(1) Are included in the national count on a **provisional basis**;

(2) Do not constitute State/Regional endorsement of result accuracy;

(3) Preserve the State/Region's standing to challenge before the National Election Court; and

(4) Do not trigger the auto-certification provisions of subsection (d).

(d) **National Election Court Review.** Upon filing of an Integrity Challenge:

(1) The National Election Court shall convene an emergency panel within forty-eight (48) hours;

(2) The Court shall issue a preliminary determination within fourteen (14) days of filing on whether the challenge has substantial merit;

(3) If the Court finds substantial merit, it may order:
    - (i) a targeted recount of affected precincts,
    - (ii) an evidentiary hearing on specific fraud allegations,
    - (iii) provisional exclusion of specific ballot categories pending resolution, or
    - (iv) adjustment of the escrowed results based on verified evidence;

(4) The Court shall issue a final determination within twenty-eight (28) days of filing;

(5) The Court's determination is final and not subject to further appeal, except to the Supreme Court on constitutional questions only.

#### Provisional Truncation for RCV

(e) **Provisional Truncation for RCV Tabulation.**

(1) **Mathematical Insufficiency Standard.** The National Certification Board may proceed with RCV elimination rounds if:

- (i) At least six (6) of seven (7) States/Regions have certified results (or placed results in Escrow with provisional inclusion); and
- (ii) The outstanding ballots from non-certifying State(s)/Region(s) are mathematically insufficient to change the current round's elimination result.

(2) **Calculation of Mathematical Insufficiency.** Outstanding ballots are "mathematically insufficient" when, even if all such ballots were allocated to the candidate currently facing elimination, that candidate would still have fewer votes than the next-lowest candidate.

#### Preemptive Federal Election Jurisdiction

(f) **Federal Jurisdiction Timeline.** In federal elections, if a State/Regional Court has not issued a final, non-appealable decision within seven (7) days of the election:

(1) Jurisdiction automatically and exclusively transfers to the National Election Court;

(2) All pending State/Regional court proceedings are stayed;

(3) All State/Regional court stays are vacated by operation of law.

(g) **National Election Court Authority.** Upon jurisdiction transfer:

(1) The National Election Court assumes exclusive authority over all certification disputes;

(2) The Court may consider State/Regional law issues without deference to State/Regional court interpretations;

(3) The Court shall resolve all pending disputes within fourteen (14) days of jurisdiction transfer.

(h) **Pretextual Stay Finding.** The National Election Court may find a State/Regional court stay pretextual if:

(1) The underlying claim lacks substantial legal merit;

(2) The stay was issued without adequate factual basis;

(3) The pattern of rulings suggests partisan motivation rather than legal analysis.

(i) **Consequence of Pretextual Finding.** Upon finding of pretextual stay:

(1) The issuing judge is referred to the Judicial Conduct Board;

(2) The State/Region loses authority to issue stays in federal election matters for the next two election cycles;

(3) All future election disputes from that State/Region proceed directly to the National Election Court.

#### Certification Escrow Coordination

(j) **Escrow Tolling.** The seven-day deadline under subsection (f) is tolled during any Certification Escrow period:

(1) The deadline resumes upon escrow termination or release;

(2) During escrow, State/Regional court stays remain vacated;

(3) The National Election Court assumes jurisdiction over escrow disputes upon tolling expiration.

(k) **Timeline Coordination.** The certification deadlines in this section coordinate as follows:

(1) Day 0-7: State/Regional court window under subsection (f);

(2) Day 7-21: Certification window under subsection (a);

(3) Day 21-56: Integrity challenge resolution under subsection (d).

(l) **Default Resolution.** If all timeline deadlines expire without resolution:

(1) Results as certified (or as provisionally included from escrow) become final;

(2) No further challenges may be filed;

(3) The National Certification Board shall proceed with tabulation.

### Section 8. Caretaker Governance

#### Disqualified Caretaker Rule

(a) **Disqualified Caretaker Rule.** No person may serve as Caretaker Executive during a certification dispute if that person:

(1) Is a candidate in the disputed election;

(2) Was the incumbent in the office being contested;

(3) Is a member of the same political party as any candidate in the disputed election;

(4) Was appointed by or reports to the federal executive branch;

(5) Has a financial or familial relationship with any candidate;

(6) Was appointed to any judicial office by the incumbent within the preceding four years.

(b) **Caretaker Selection Hierarchy.** During a certification dispute, the Caretaker Executive shall be selected in the following order:

(1) The Chief Justice of the State/Regional Supreme Court, if willing to serve;

(2) The most senior judge of the State/Regional Court of Appeals who is not affiliated with any party to the dispute;

(3) A retired State/Regional executive from a prior non-consecutive term who is not affiliated with any party to the dispute;

(4) If none of the above are available, a panel of three persons selected by unanimous agreement of adjacent State/Regional Governors.

#### Declining Caretaker Authority

(c) **Declining Authority Timeline.**

(1) **Initial Period (Days 1-30).** The Caretaker Executive shall exercise full executive authority necessary for continuity of government operations.

(2) **Reduced Authority (Days 31-60).** The Caretaker Executive may not:

- (i) Make permanent appointments to any position;
- (ii) Enter into contracts exceeding $1 million or 12 months duration;
- (iii) Issue executive orders with effect beyond the caretaker period;
- (iv) Propose or sign new legislation except emergency measures certified by the State/Regional Supreme Court.

(3) **Minimal Authority (Days 61-90).** The Caretaker Executive may only:

- (i) Maintain essential government services as defined by standing appropriations;
- (ii) Respond to genuine emergencies certified by the State/Regional Supreme Court;
- (iii) Cooperate with certification resolution efforts.

(4) **Automatic Termination (Day 91).** If no certification has occurred by Day 91:

- (i) A special election shall be called;
- (ii) The Caretaker shall continue with minimal authority until the special election concludes;
- (iii) The special election winner takes office immediately upon certification.
