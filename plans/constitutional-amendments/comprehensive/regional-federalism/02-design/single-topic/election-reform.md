---

## Article VII — Elections and Democratic Legitimacy

### Section 1. Right to Vote

(a) The right of citizens of the United States, who are eighteen years of age or older, to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State or Region on account of race, color, previous condition of servitude, sex, age, or failure to pay any poll tax or other tax.

(b) Every citizen shall have equal access to voter registration and voting, including early voting, absentee voting, and same-day registration.

(c) No State or Region shall impose voter identification requirements that create an undue burden on the right to vote.

(d) The right to vote in any election conducted under this Constitution is held exclusively by natural persons who are citizens of the United States. No State or Region may grant, extend, or recognize voting rights to corporations, artificial entities, or automated systems, or weight votes by property, tax contribution, or wealth. Elections in which non-natural-person entities vote or votes are so weighted are void.

### Section 2. Electoral System

(a) The President and Vice President shall be elected by national popular vote using ranked-choice voting.

(b) If no candidate receives a majority of first-choice votes, an instant runoff shall be conducted by eliminating the candidate with the fewest votes and redistributing those votes according to voters' next preferences, until one candidate receives a majority.

(c) The Electoral College is hereby abolished.

### Section 3. Congressional Elections

(a) Members of the House of Representatives shall be elected from multi-member districts using proportional representation or ranked-choice voting, as Congress shall provide by law.

(b) Members of the Senate shall be elected by ranked-choice voting within each State or Region.

(c) Congressional redistricting shall be conducted by independent redistricting commissions as provided by Section 10 of this Article and the Independent Redistricting Commission Act.

### Section 4. Independent Election Commission

(a) There is hereby established an Independent Election Commission (IEC) to administer federal elections.

(b) The IEC shall consist of [number] members appointed for staggered [term-length] terms, with no more than [number] members from any single political party.

(c) The IEC shall have authority to:
    (1) Establish uniform standards for federal election administration;
    (2) Certify voting systems and election procedures;
    (3) Investigate and remedy violations of federal election law;
    (4) Provide guidance to State and Regional election officials.

### Section 5. Campaign Finance

(a) Congress shall have power to regulate the raising and spending of money in federal elections, including by setting reasonable limits on contributions and expenditures.

(b) All contributions and expenditures intended to influence federal elections shall be publicly disclosed within [timeframe].

(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the free speech rights of individuals acting in their personal capacity.

### Section 6. Election Security

(a) All voting systems used in federal elections shall produce a voter-verified paper record.

(b) Post-election audits shall be conducted for all federal elections using statistically rigorous methods.

(c) The IEC shall establish cybersecurity standards for election infrastructure.

### Section 7. Certification and Escrow

#### Certification Options

(a) **Certification Options.** Within twenty-one (21) days of an election, each State or Regional Certification Authority shall either:

(1) **Certify** the results, attesting that the election was conducted according to law and the results accurately reflect votes cast;

(2) **Refuse to certify** with a written statement of specific deficiencies, triggering the procedures in Section 7(d); or

(3) **Place results in Certification Escrow** pursuant to this section.

(b) **Certification Escrow.** A State or Regional Certification Authority may place results in Certification Escrow only upon:

(1) A written finding, supported by specific evidence, that fraud, systematic error, or other irregularity may have affected more than one percent (1%) of ballots cast; and

(2) Simultaneous filing of an Integrity Challenge with the National Election Court.

(c) **Effect of Escrow.** Results placed in Certification Escrow:

(1) Are included in the national count on a **provisional basis**;

(2) Do not constitute State/Regional endorsement of result accuracy;

(3) Preserve the State/Region's standing to challenge before the National Election Court; and

(4) Do not trigger the auto-certification provisions of subsection (d).

(d) **National Election Court Review.** Upon filing of an Integrity Challenge:

(1) The National Election Court shall convene an emergency panel within forty-eight (48) hours;

(2) The Court shall issue a preliminary determination within fourteen (14) days of filing on whether the challenge has substantial merit;

(3) If the Court finds substantial merit, it may order:
    - (i) a targeted recount of affected precincts,
    - (ii) an evidentiary hearing on specific fraud allegations,
    - (iii) provisional exclusion of specific ballot categories pending resolution, or
    - (iv) adjustment of the escrowed results based on verified evidence;

(4) The Court shall issue a final determination within twenty-eight (28) days of filing;

(5) The Court's determination is final and not subject to further appeal, except to the Supreme Court on constitutional questions only.

#### Provisional Truncation for RCV

(e) **Provisional Truncation for RCV Tabulation.**

(1) **Mathematical Insufficiency Standard.** The National Certification Board may proceed with RCV elimination rounds if:

- (i) At least six (6) of seven (7) States/Regions have certified results (or placed results in Escrow with provisional inclusion); and
- (ii) The outstanding ballots from non-certifying State(s)/Region(s) are mathematically insufficient to change the current round's elimination result.

(2) **Calculation of Mathematical Insufficiency.** Outstanding ballots are "mathematically insufficient" when, even if all such ballots were allocated to the candidate currently facing elimination, that candidate would still have fewer votes than the next-lowest candidate.

#### Preemptive Federal Election Jurisdiction

(f) **Federal Jurisdiction Timeline.** In federal elections, if a State/Regional Court has not issued a final, non-appealable decision within seven (7) days of the election:

(1) Jurisdiction automatically and exclusively transfers to the National Election Court;

(2) All pending State/Regional court proceedings are stayed;

(3) All State/Regional court stays are vacated by operation of law.

(g) **National Election Court Authority.** Upon jurisdiction transfer:

(1) The National Election Court assumes exclusive authority over all certification disputes;

(2) The Court may consider State/Regional law issues without deference to State/Regional court interpretations;

(3) The Court shall resolve all pending disputes within fourteen (14) days of jurisdiction transfer.

(h) **Pretextual Stay Finding.** The National Election Court may find a State/Regional court stay pretextual if:

(1) The underlying claim lacks substantial legal merit;

(2) The stay was issued without adequate factual basis;

(3) The pattern of rulings suggests partisan motivation rather than legal analysis.

(i) **Consequence of Pretextual Finding.** Upon finding of pretextual stay:

(1) The issuing judge is referred to the Judicial Conduct Board;

(2) The State/Region loses authority to issue stays in federal election matters for the next two election cycles;

(3) All future election disputes from that State/Region proceed directly to the National Election Court.

#### Certification Escrow Coordination

(j) **Escrow Tolling.** The seven-day deadline under subsection (f) is tolled during any Certification Escrow period:

(1) The deadline resumes upon escrow termination or release;

(2) During escrow, State/Regional court stays remain vacated;

(3) The National Election Court assumes jurisdiction over escrow disputes upon tolling expiration.

(k) **Timeline Coordination.** The certification deadlines in this section coordinate as follows:

(1) Day 0-7: State/Regional court window under subsection (f);

(2) Day 7-21: Certification window under subsection (a);

(3) Day 21-56: Integrity challenge resolution under subsection (d).

(l) **Default Resolution.** If all timeline deadlines expire without resolution:

(1) Results as certified (or as provisionally included from escrow) become final;

(2) No further challenges may be filed;

(3) The National Certification Board shall proceed with tabulation.

#### Certification Integrity

(m) **Ministerial Nature of Certification.** The certification of election results by any State, Regional, or federal official is a ministerial duty, not a discretionary legislative or executive act. No legislature may direct, override, or substitute its judgment for the certification processes established in this section. Officials shall execute one of the options in subsection (a) within the timeframe established therein. If no option is executed within the constitutional timeframe, the results of the official canvass shall be deemed certified under subsection (a)(1) by operation of law.

(n) **Prohibition on Alternate Certifications.** No legislature, executive, political party, or other person or body may submit, recognize, or act upon any certification of election results other than the single certification issued pursuant to the processes in this section. Any purported alternate certification is void ab initio and of no legal force or effect.

(o) **Penalties for Certification Subversion.** Any official who knowingly refuses to perform the ministerial duties established in this section, or who submits, certifies, or endorses an alternate certification in violation of subsection (n):

(1) shall be immediately removed from office;

(2) shall be permanently barred from holding any office of profit or trust under the United States or any State or Region thereof; and

(3) shall be subject to such criminal penalties as Congress shall provide by law, which shall include penalties classified as felonies.

### Section 8. Caretaker Governance

#### Disqualified Caretaker Rule

(a) **Disqualified Caretaker Rule.** No person may serve as Caretaker Executive during a certification dispute if that person:

(1) Is a candidate in the disputed election;

(2) Was the incumbent in the office being contested;

(3) Is a member of the same political party as any candidate in the disputed election;

(4) Was appointed by or reports to the federal executive branch;

(5) Has a financial or familial relationship with any candidate;

(6) Was appointed to any judicial office by the incumbent within the preceding four years.

(b) **Caretaker Selection Hierarchy.** During a certification dispute, the Caretaker Executive shall be selected in the following order:

(1) The Chief Justice of the State/Regional Supreme Court, if willing to serve;

(2) The most senior judge of the State/Regional Court of Appeals who is not affiliated with any party to the dispute;

(3) A retired State/Regional executive from a prior non-consecutive term who is not affiliated with any party to the dispute;

(4) If none of the above are available, a panel of three persons selected by unanimous agreement of adjacent State/Regional Governors.

#### Declining Caretaker Authority

(c) **Declining Authority Timeline.**

(1) **Initial Period (Days 1-30).** The Caretaker Executive shall exercise full executive authority necessary for continuity of government operations.

(2) **Reduced Authority (Days 31-60).** The Caretaker Executive may not:

- (i) Make permanent appointments to any position;
- (ii) Enter into contracts exceeding $1 million or 12 months duration;
- (iii) Issue executive orders with effect beyond the caretaker period;
- (iv) Propose or sign new legislation except emergency measures certified by the State/Regional Supreme Court.

(3) **Minimal Authority (Days 61-90).** The Caretaker Executive may only:

- (i) Maintain essential government services as defined by standing appropriations;
- (ii) Respond to genuine emergencies certified by the State/Regional Supreme Court;
- (iii) Cooperate with certification resolution efforts.

(4) **Automatic Termination (Day 91).** If no certification has occurred by Day 91:

- (i) The Caretaker's authority terminates;
- (ii) Governance transfers to the Temporary Executive Committee established by subsection (e);
- (iii) If a Failure of Choice has been declared under subsection (h)(3), a special election shall proceed under subsection (h)(4);
- (iv) If no Failure of Choice has been declared, the National Election Court shall issue a default certification under subsection (h)(2) within seven (7) days.
- (v) This termination date may not be extended, stayed, or modified by any authority, including emergency declaration, judicial order, or executive action.

#### External Confirmation

(d) **External Confirmation of Caretaker.**

(1) Any Caretaker selected under subsection (b)(1) through (b)(3) shall require confirmation by majority vote of the Governors of adjacent States or Regions. For purposes of this subsection, "adjacent" means sharing a land border or, for non-contiguous States or Regions, the two nearest by geographic center.

(2) Adjacent Governors shall vote on confirmation within seventy-two (72) hours of the Caretaker selection. If a Governor fails to cast a vote within seventy-two hours, that Governor is deemed to have voted in favor of confirmation. If the adjacent Governors are evenly divided, the Governor with the longest continuous tenure in office shall cast the deciding vote; if two or more Governors share the longest continuous tenure, the oldest by age among them shall cast the deciding vote.

(3) If confirmation is not obtained:

- (i) The next person in the hierarchy established by subsection (b) shall be offered the position;
- (ii) If the entire hierarchy is exhausted without confirmation, the adjacent Governors shall select the Caretaker directly by majority vote within forty-eight (48) hours;
- (iii) Notwithstanding subsections (a)(4) and (a)(6), if the adjacent Governors fail to select a Caretaker within forty-eight hours, the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit encompassing the State or Region shall serve as Caretaker.

(4) The confirmation vote shall be public and recorded. No Governor may condition a confirmation vote on policy commitments, personnel decisions, or other concessions from the Caretaker.

#### Temporary Executive Committee

(e) **Temporary Executive Committee.**

(1) **Activation.** Upon termination of Caretaker authority under subsection (c)(4), executive functions shall be exercised by a Temporary Executive Committee until certification of an election winner or inauguration following a special election.

(2) **Composition.** The Temporary Executive Committee shall consist of:

- (i) The presiding officers of both chambers of the State/Regional legislature;
- (ii) The minority leaders of both chambers of the State/Regional legislature;
- (iii) The former Caretaker, in an advisory and non-voting capacity.

(3) **Unicameral and Nonpartisan Legislatures.** Where the State/Regional legislature consists of a single chamber or does not organize by political party:

- (i) In a unicameral legislature, the committee shall consist of the presiding officer, the deputy presiding officer, the minority leader, and one additional member selected by the minority caucus, with the former Caretaker in an advisory and non-voting capacity;
- (ii) In a nonpartisan legislature with two chambers, the committee shall consist of the presiding officers of both chambers and the two members with the longest continuous service who are not from the same chamber or electoral district as either presiding officer, with the former Caretaker in an advisory and non-voting capacity;
- (iii) If both conditions apply (unicameral and nonpartisan), the committee shall consist of the presiding officer and the three members with the longest continuous service who are not from the same electoral district as the presiding officer, with the former Caretaker in an advisory and non-voting capacity.

(4) **Supermajority Requirement.** If the State/Regional legislature is controlled by a political party affiliated with any candidate in the disputed election:

- (i) All executive actions by the Committee shall require a two-thirds (2/3) supermajority of voting members;
- (ii) Any action receiving less than a two-thirds vote shall be void;
- (iii) For purposes of this paragraph, "control" means a party holds the majority of seats in either chamber (or, in a unicameral legislature, the single chamber).

(5) **Limited Authority.** The Temporary Executive Committee may only:

- (i) Maintain essential government services as defined by standing appropriations;
- (ii) Respond to genuine emergencies certified by the State/Regional Supreme Court;
- (iii) Cooperate with certification resolution or special election preparation.

(6) **Anti-Abuse Provisions.** The Temporary Executive Committee may not:

- (i) Take any action designed to advantage any candidate in the disputed election or potential special election;
- (ii) Modify election procedures, voter rolls, polling locations, or certification requirements;
- (iii) Appoint officials with authority over the disputed election or special election;
- (iv) Enter into contracts, grants, or agreements exceeding thirty (30) days in duration or one thousand (1,000) Federal Penalty Units in value, except for expenditures necessary for court-certified emergency response under paragraph (5)(ii) or special election administration under paragraph (5)(iii), which shall be publicly reported within seventy-two (72) hours.

#### Anti-Obstruction Mechanisms

(f) **Anti-Obstruction Mechanisms.**

(1) **Obstruction Defined.** For purposes of this section, "obstruction" includes any action primarily intended to delay or prevent certification rather than resolve a legitimate dispute, including but not limited to:

- (i) Filing legal challenges that lack a good-faith factual or legal basis;
- (ii) Refusing to cooperate with audit, recount, or certification procedures;
- (iii) Withholding evidence, data, or records necessary for certification;
- (iv) Coordinating with the Caretaker or Temporary Executive Committee to extend the deadlock;
- (v) Physical disruption or intimidation of counting, auditing, or certification processes;
- (vi) Cyber attacks, unauthorized access, or interference with election systems;
- (vii) Incitement to imminent lawless action intended to physically prevent or disrupt the counting, auditing, or certification of lawful ballots.

(2) **Finding of Obstruction.** The National Election Court may find, by preponderance of the evidence, that a candidate, political party, or their agents engaged in obstruction. Upon such finding:

- (i) The obstructing party shall be assessed all costs, including attorney fees, for all other parties to the dispute;
- (ii) All pending and future legal challenges by the obstructing party in the same dispute shall be subject to a clear and convincing evidence standard;
- (iii) If the obstruction is egregious, repeated, or outcome-determinative, the Court may certify the election for the non-obstructing candidate;
- (iv) The finding shall be a matter of public record and may not be sealed or expunged;
- (v) All pending matters brought by the obstructing party before the National Election Court, including matters arising under Section 7, shall be subject to heightened scrutiny, including rigorous enforcement of standing, timeliness, and factual basis requirements.

(3) **Candidate Disqualification for Obstruction.** A candidate found by the National Election Court to have personally directed or authorized obstruction:

- (i) In one certification proceeding: shall be ineligible to hold the contested office for four (4) years from the date of the finding;
- (ii) In two or more certification proceedings: shall be permanently disqualified from holding State or Regional executive office;
- (iii) Disqualification under this paragraph is separate from and in addition to penalties under Section 7(o).

(4) **Federal Obstruction.** If the federal government or its agents are found by the National Election Court to have obstructed State or Regional certification:

- (i) All federal executive and administrative involvement in the affected State or Region's governance shall terminate immediately, except that judicial functions of the National Election Court and Supreme Court, law enforcement referrals, and election-security functions under subsection (h)(4)(iv) shall continue;
- (ii) The State or Region shall select its own Caretaker under subsection (b) without federal executive input;
- (iii) The responsible federal officials shall be referred to the Department of Justice for investigation and prosecution;
- (iv) The finding shall be reported to Congress for potential impeachment proceedings against responsible officials.

(5) **Frivolous Challenge Deterrence.** Election challenges that are dismissed for lack of evidence, standing, or merit, or that are substantially similar to previously dismissed challenges:

- (i) Shall result in an assessment of costs and attorney fees against the filing party;
- (ii) Shall be considered in any subsequent obstruction finding under paragraph (2);
- (iii) May result in a requirement that future challenges by the same party in the same dispute receive pre-approval from the National Election Court before filing.

(6) **Serial Litigation Finding.** If the National Election Court determines that election challenges by a candidate, political party, or their agents constitute a coordinated pattern designed to delay certification rather than pursue legitimate legal claims:

- (i) All pending challenges in the same dispute shall be transferred to the National Election Court, including any matters pending before State or Regional courts or tribunals, but excluding matters already pending before the Supreme Court, and consolidated for decision within seven (7) days;
- (ii) No further challenges by that party may be filed without pre-approval under paragraph (5)(iii);
- (iii) The finding shall be a matter of public record and shall be considered in any future disputes involving the same parties;
- (iv) A Serial Litigation finding constitutes obstruction for purposes of paragraph (2);
- (v) The filing of claims relying on facts or legal theories substantially identical to those previously rejected by a court of competent jurisdiction in the same election dispute constitutes prima facie evidence of a coordinated pattern under this paragraph.

#### Caretaker-Specific Resolution Timeline

(g) **Accelerated Resolution During Caretaker Governance.**

(1) **Application.** Notwithstanding Section 7(k), when a certification dispute has triggered Caretaker Governance under this section, the following accelerated deadlines shall govern the dispute resolution timeline:

| Stage | Deadline | Cumulative Days from Election Day |
|---|---|---|
| State/Regional certification or refusal | 21 days (per §7(a)) | 21 |
| Challenge filing | 7 days after certification or refusal | 28 |
| NEC evidentiary hearing | 14 days after challenge filing | 42 |
| NEC ruling | 7 days after hearing | 49 |
| Appeal to Supreme Court | 3 days after NEC ruling | 52 |
| Supreme Court ruling | 14 days after appeal | 66 |

(2) **Maximum Deadlock Period.** The total period from Election Day to final resolution of a certification dispute that has triggered Caretaker Governance shall not exceed sixty-six (66) days. If no judicial ruling has been issued by Day 66, the provisions of subsection (h) apply.

(3) **Timeline Enforcement.** If any court or tribunal fails to meet a deadline specified in this subsection:

- (i) The matter is automatically transferred to the next body in the hierarchy (from State/Regional court to NEC, or from NEC to Supreme Court);
- (ii) The receiving body shall rule within seven (7) days of automatic transfer;
- (iii) The deadline for the next stage begins from the date of automatic transfer, not from the missed deadline;
- (iv) If the Supreme Court fails to meet its deadline under this subsection, the matter shall proceed directly to the NEC audit determination under subsection (h)(1).

(4) **Coordination with Section 7.** The deadlines in this subsection do not modify the general certification provisions of Section 7 for elections that do not trigger Caretaker Governance. Where Section 7 deadlines are shorter than those specified here, the shorter deadline applies.

#### NEC Audit Default and Special Election

(h) **Default Resolution and Special Election.**

(1) **NEC Audit Determination.** If no final judicial ruling has been issued by Day 66 from Election Day, the National Election Court shall determine, within seven (7) days:

- (i) Whether the most recent completed count is reliable and materially free from obstruction, fraud, or systematic error;
- (ii) The identity of the candidate with the most votes in the most recent reliable count.

(2) **Default Certification.** If the National Election Court determines the count is reliable:

- (i) The candidate with the most votes shall be certified;
- (ii) This certification is final and not subject to further challenge, except for fraud discovered post-certification that is sufficient to change the outcome;
- (iii) The certified candidate shall take office within seven (7) days of certification.

(3) **Failure of Choice.** The National Election Court shall issue a "Failure of Choice" declaration if it determines that:

- (i) The most recent count is unreliable due to obstruction, fraud, or systematic error affecting the integrity of the result; or
- (ii) The margin between the leading candidates is smaller than the number of ballots that are unresolvable due to dispute, destruction, or tampering.

(4) **Special Election.** Upon a Failure of Choice declaration:

- (i) A special election shall be held within thirty (30) days of the declaration;
- (ii) The Caretaker (or Temporary Executive Committee, if Caretaker authority has terminated) shall continue with minimal authority during the special election period;
- (iii) The same candidates shall appear on the ballot unless a candidate voluntarily withdraws or has been disqualified under subsection (f)(3);
- (iv) Enhanced election security measures, including federal observers, shall be implemented for the special election;
- (v) Any party found to have caused the Failure of Choice through obstruction shall bear the costs of the special election.

(5) **Terminal Fallback.** If the special election also results in a Failure of Choice:

- (i) The State/Regional legislature shall elect the executive by a two-thirds (2/3) vote of a joint session;
- (ii) If no candidate receives two-thirds support within fourteen (14) days, the Temporary Executive Committee shall serve until a special election can be held during the next general election cycle; if the next general election is more than one (1) year from the date the Committee assumed authority under subsection (c)(4), a mandatory special election shall be held within one (1) year of that date;
- (iii) This terminal fallback is final and not subject to further extension or modification.

#### Caretaker and Committee Emergency Limitations

(i) **Caretaker and Committee Emergency Limitations.**

(1) **Legislative Concurrence Required.** During caretaker governance or Temporary Executive Committee governance under this section, emergency declarations by the Caretaker Executive or Temporary Executive Committee shall require the written concurrence of the presiding officer of the State/Regional legislature. Where the legislature has two chambers, concurrence of both presiding officers is required. This requirement is in addition to, and does not replace, any court certification requirement under subsection (c). Where both court certification and legislative concurrence are required, the forty-eight (48) hour exception under subparagraph (A) applies only to the legislative concurrence requirement.

(A) **Immediate Response Exception.** The Caretaker Executive or Temporary Executive Committee may declare an emergency and exercise emergency powers for a period not to exceed forty-eight (48) hours without legislative concurrence, provided the declaration is immediately transmitted to the presiding officers of the State/Regional legislature. Continuation beyond forty-eight (48) hours requires written concurrence under this paragraph.

(2) **Prohibited Emergency Uses.** Emergency powers exercised during caretaker or Temporary Executive Committee governance may not be used to:

- (i) Affect election administration, counting, auditing, certification, or transition procedures;
- (ii) Restrict the movement, assembly, or communication of candidates, election officials, or voters in connection with the disputed election or any special election;
- (iii) Extend or modify the termination date under subsection (c)(4) or any deadline under subsection (g);
- (iv) Authorize surveillance of or interference with transition activities under subsection (j).

(3) **Emergency Duration.** Emergency declarations during caretaker or Temporary Executive Committee governance expire automatically after fourteen (14) days unless renewed with legislative concurrence under paragraph (1). No single emergency may be renewed more than twice during the caretaker or Committee governance period. A subsequent emergency declaration addressing substantially the same underlying event or circumstances as a prior declaration, regardless of whether the prior declaration has expired or been rescinded, counts as a renewal of that emergency for purposes of this paragraph.

(4) **Investigation Limitation.** Investigations ordered by the Caretaker Executive or Temporary Executive Committee regarding the disputed election:

- (i) Do not affect certification deadlines under this section or Section 7;
- (ii) May not be used as a basis for withholding, delaying, or conditioning certification;
- (iii) Continue under the successor if unresolved at the time of termination under subsection (c)(4) or expiration of Temporary Executive Committee authority under subsection (h)(5)(ii); provided that the successor may review and terminate any investigation initiated during the caretaker or Committee governance period.

#### Transition Protection

(j) **Transition Protection.**

(1) **Apparent Winner Designation.** The candidate leading in the most recent official canvass or, if no canvass has been completed, the candidate identified by the National Election Court as the likely winner based on available returns, shall be designated the "Apparent Winner" for purposes of transition preparation. If conflicting canvasses are issued or the identity of the leading candidate is disputed, the National Election Court shall designate the Apparent Winner within twenty-four (24) hours. This designation does not prejudice the outcome of any pending certification dispute.

(2) **Transition Entitlements.** Upon designation, the Apparent Winner shall be entitled to:

- (i) Security briefings, including classified briefings at the same classification level, and protective detail equivalent to those provided to the Caretaker Executive;
- (ii) Access to government transition facilities and office space;
- (iii) Transition funding at the rate established by law for incoming executives;
- (iv) Briefings from department and agency heads on ongoing operations and pending matters.

(3) **Anti-Impairment.** The Caretaker Executive and Temporary Executive Committee may not:

- (i) Impede, delay, or condition transition activities;
- (ii) Withhold information relevant to the Apparent Winner's preparation for office;
- (iii) Reassign, terminate, or discipline government employees for cooperating with transition activities;
- (iv) Destroy, alter, or remove records that would be transferred to the successor upon taking office.

(4) **Change of Apparent Winner.** If the identity of the Apparent Winner changes due to a recount, court order, or National Election Court determination, transition entitlements shall transfer to the newly designated Apparent Winner within twenty-four (24) hours. Upon transfer, the prior Apparent Winner's access to security briefings, classified materials, and government facilities under paragraph (2) shall terminate immediately. All classified materials in the prior Apparent Winner's possession shall be returned within twenty-four (24) hours.

#### Accountability for Caretaker Abuse

(k) **Accountability for Caretaker Abuse.**

(1) **Refusal to Vacate.** A Caretaker Executive or member of the Temporary Executive Committee who refuses to vacate office or relinquish authority upon the termination or expiration of their authority under this section:

- (i) Is guilty of a high crime against the constitutional order;
- (ii) Shall be subject to immediate removal by the State/Regional Supreme Court upon petition by the Apparent Winner, the State/Regional legislature, or the National Election Court;
- (iii) Shall be permanently barred from holding any office of profit or trust under the United States or any State or Region thereof;
- (iv) Shall be subject to such criminal penalties as Congress shall provide by law, which shall include penalties classified as felonies.

(2) **Void Orders.** Any order, directive, appointment, or official act issued by a Caretaker Executive or Temporary Executive Committee member after the termination or expiration of their authority under this section is void ab initio and of no legal force or effect.

(3) **Subordinate Official Obligations.** Upon termination of Caretaker authority under subsection (c)(4), and thereafter:

- (i) All subordinate officials shall take direction from the certified winner; if no winner has been certified, from the Temporary Executive Committee if it retains authority under subsection (e); if Committee authority has also expired, from the Apparent Winner pending certification; and if none is available, from the successor entity established under this section. During any period of Temporary Executive Committee governance, transition activities under subsection (j) shall be directed by the Apparent Winner;
- (ii) Security services shall protect the successor and facilitate the transition of authority;
- (iii) A subordinate official who knowingly continues to take direction from a person whose authority has terminated under this section is subject to removal and such penalties as Congress shall provide by law;
- (iv) **Safe Harbor.** No civil or criminal penalty, administrative discipline, or employment retaliation may be imposed on any subordinate official for refusing a direction from a Caretaker Executive or Temporary Executive Committee member whose authority has terminated under this section, or for taking direction from the successor designated under paragraph (i).

(4) **Non-Stayable Termination.** The termination of authority under subsection (c)(4) and the expiration of Temporary Executive Committee authority under subsection (h)(5)(ii):

- (i) Are self-executing and require no judicial order or certification;
- (ii) May not be stayed, enjoined, or suspended by any court pending judicial review;
- (iii) Any challenge to the termination shall be decided by the National Election Court within seventy-two (72) hours;
- (iv) The successor assumes authority immediately upon termination, regardless of any pending challenge.

### Section 9. Algorithmic Transparency

*[This section establishes transparency requirements for algorithmic systems used to administer rights-affecting governmental functions. See Gap 144.]*

(a) **Algorithmic Transparency Floor.**

(1) Any automated system used by a Region or State to administer functions related to Federal Rights Floors or National Frameworks must be "Open-Audit" compliant;

(2) "Open-Audit" compliance means the ARB or authorized federal agencies may inspect:

- (i) Source code and decision logic;
- (ii) Training data and model parameters;
- (iii) Input variables and weighting factors;
- (iv) Output logs and decision records;

(3) Inspection authority activates upon a finding of probable cause of rights violation;

(4) No trade secret, proprietary data, or intellectual property claim may be asserted against federal audit authority.

(b) **Vendor Accountability.**

(1) Regions may not contract for algorithmic systems unless the vendor agrees to federal audit compliance;

(2) Vendor contracts must include audit access clauses as a condition of use in rights-affecting functions;

(3) Regions are liable for vendor non-compliance as if the Region itself refused access;

(4) Vendors who obstruct federal audits are barred from government contracts nationwide for five years.

(c) **Decision Explainability.**

(1) Algorithmic systems affecting individual rights must be capable of providing human-understandable explanations for specific decisions;

(2) "Black box" systems that cannot explain individual decisions are prohibited for rights-affecting functions;

(3) Regions must maintain audit trails sufficient to reconstruct the basis for any algorithmic decision;

(4) Individuals denied benefits or rights by algorithmic systems have a right to human review and explanation.

### Section 10. Independent Redistricting

(a) **Independent Redistricting Commission Mandate.** Each Region shall establish an Independent Redistricting Commission (IRC) to draw boundaries for federal House of Representatives districts and Regional legislative districts. No Regional legislature, governor, or executive official shall have authority to draw, approve, or modify redistricting plans for districts covered by this section. Any redistricting plan adopted by a body other than an IRC established under this section is void.

(b) **Commission Composition.** Each IRC shall consist of not fewer than seven (7) and not more than fifteen (15) members, comprising:

(1) an equal number of members affiliated with each qualifying political party — defined as any party that received at least five percent (5%) of the total vote in the most recent federal or Regional general election within the jurisdiction — up to the four parties receiving the highest vote share; if fewer than two parties qualify, the unaffiliated category shall comprise at least two-thirds of the commission;

(2) an equal number of members not affiliated with any qualifying political party.

Commissioners shall be selected through a process that includes random selection from qualified applicant pools, with opposing parties permitted limited strikes. No person who has served as an elected official, registered lobbyist, or party officer within the preceding five (5) years may serve as a commissioner. Congress shall provide by law additional qualification, conflict-of-interest, and selection procedures.

(c) **Redistricting Criteria.** IRCs shall draw districts according to the following criteria, in order of priority:

(1) equal population within constitutionally permissible deviation;

(2) compliance with voting rights protections, including prohibition on dilution of racial or language minority voting strength;

(3) consistency of district magnitude — multi-member districts within the same jurisdiction shall not vary in the number of seats per district by more than two, unless required by population equality or geographic constraints and approved by the National Election Court upon a public finding that no compliant alternative is practicable;

(4) geographic contiguity;

(5) geographic compactness;

(6) preservation of political subdivisions and communities of interest where feasible;

(7) partisan fairness — the overall plan shall produce seat distributions reasonably reflecting vote distributions, as measured by metrics appropriate to the electoral system in use, designated by the National Election Court.

No district shall be drawn with the intent or predictable effect of favoring or disfavoring any political party, candidate, or incumbent. No district shall vary in magnitude for the purpose of manipulating the effective representation threshold.

(d) **District Magnitude.** Each multi-member district for the House of Representatives shall elect not fewer than three (3) and not more than seven (7) members. Congress may adjust the maximum within this range but may not reduce the minimum below three.

(e) **Approval and Transparency.** Redistricting plans shall be approved by a supermajority of the IRC — at least sixty percent (60%) of members, including at least one member from each qualifying party category and at least one unaffiliated member. If no plan achieves supermajority after three attempts, a plan may be adopted by simple majority, subject to automatic judicial review for compliance with subsection (c).

All IRC proceedings shall be open to the public. The IRC shall conduct public hearings in each geographic area of the jurisdiction before adopting a plan, shall use publicly available mapping data and software, and shall publish all deliberation records. No private communications between commissioners and elected officials, party representatives, or lobbyists shall occur during the redistricting process. Communications with non-partisan technical staff — including census officials, geographic information system specialists, and demographers — are permitted if recorded and published as part of the IRC's deliberation record.

(f) **Judicial Review.** Any citizen residing in the jurisdiction may challenge a redistricting plan within sixty (60) days of adoption. Courts shall apply de novo review to claims of non-compliance with subsection (c) criteria and shall order plans redrawn if they fail to comply. The burden is on the IRC to demonstrate compliance with partisan fairness and magnitude consistency requirements through quantitative evidence using metrics designated by the National Election Court. If the IRC fails to produce a compliant plan within the timeframe required by law, the National Election Court may adopt a backup plan.

(g) **Timing.** Redistricting shall occur only:

(1) following each decennial federal census;

(2) if ordered by a court or by the National Election Court pursuant to a compliance review under Article I, Section 3-A or this section;

(3) if required by a change in the number of districts allocated to the jurisdiction.

Mid-decade redistricting for partisan advantage is prohibited. Any redistricting conducted outside the circumstances enumerated in this subsection is void.

(h) **Incarcerated Persons.** For redistricting purposes, incarcerated persons shall be counted at their last known residence prior to incarceration, not at the location of the correctional facility.

(i) **Federal Backup.** If a Region fails to establish a compliant IRC, or if an IRC fails to adopt a redistricting plan by the deadline established by law:

(1) the Independent Election Commission shall appoint a special master to draw the jurisdiction's districts;

(2) the special master shall apply the criteria in subsection (c);

(3) plans adopted by a special master are subject to the same judicial review as IRC plans;

(4) the National Election Court retains jurisdiction over compliance challenges to special master plans.
