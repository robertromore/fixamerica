## Implementation Notes

## Relationship to RF Core

If the Regional Federal Constitution is adopted:

- Article IX applies to lobbying of federal officials as specified
- Regions may establish similar requirements for Regional lobbying
- Foreign lobbying restrictions apply regardless of governmental tier

If adopted standalone:

- Article IX applies to lobbying of the federal government
- States may establish parallel requirements for state lobbying
- Federal requirements set a floor, not a ceiling

---

## Design Rationale

### Why Constitutional Level?

- Statutory lobbying reforms have proven ineffective
- Constitutional entrenchment prevents rollback by beneficiaries
- First Amendment concerns require constitutional balancing
- Demonstrates commitment to structural anti-corruption

### Why Four-Year Cooling Off?

- Two years (current law for some positions) is insufficient
- Four years spans typical election cycle
- Reduces value of "access" as primary asset
- Still allows eventual return to private sector

### Why Independent Office?

- Justice Department has conflicts (executive branch oversight)
- Congressional ethics committees are captured
- Independent oversight with single-mission focus
- Director tenure provides insulation from political pressure

### Why Strict Foreign Lobbying Rules?

- Foreign influence undermines self-government
- Constitutional principle: Americans govern America
- Disclosure ensures transparency when engagement occurs
- Lifetime ban for former officials prevents capture
