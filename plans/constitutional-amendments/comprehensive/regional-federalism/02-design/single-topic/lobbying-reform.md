# Article IX: Lobbying and Anti-Corruption Amendment

## Status: Draft

This standalone constitutional amendment establishes transparency requirements for lobbying, restricts revolving door practices, limits foreign influence, and strengthens anti-corruption standards while protecting First Amendment petition rights. It works with either the existing federal/state system or with Regional Federalism.

---

## Article IX — Lobbying and Anti-Corruption

### Section 1. Right to Petition and Lobbying Defined

(a) The right of the people peaceably to petition the government for redress of grievances shall not be abridged.

(b) For purposes of this Article, "lobbying" means any oral, written, or electronic communication to a covered official made on behalf of a client for compensation, with the intent to influence:

(1) the formulation, modification, adoption, or rejection of legislation;

(2) the formulation, modification, adoption, or rejection of a rule, regulation, executive order, or other program, policy, or position of the United States Government;

(3) the administration or execution of a federal program or policy;

(4) the nomination or confirmation of a person for a position subject to Senate confirmation.

(c) "Covered official" means any Member of Congress, congressional staff, officer or employee of the executive branch, or federal judge.

(d) Nothing in this Article shall be construed to restrict:

(1) individual citizens communicating their personal views to their elected representatives;

(2) news media reporting or editorial activities;

(3) testimony before Congress or administrative proceedings upon official invitation;

(4) communications by state, local, or tribal government officials in their official capacity.

### Section 2. Lobbyist Registration and Disclosure

(a) Every person who engages in lobbying as defined in Section 1 shall register with the Office of Lobbying Oversight established by Section 7.

(b) Registration shall include:

(1) the name and contact information of the lobbyist and employing organization;

(2) the name of each client on whose behalf lobbying is conducted;

(3) the general issues on which the lobbyist expects to engage;

(4) the amount of compensation received or expected;

(5) any foreign government, foreign political party, or foreign principal that has an interest in the lobbying activities.

(c) Registered lobbyists shall file quarterly reports disclosing:

(1) each covered official contacted, by name and position;

(2) the subject matter of each lobbying communication;

(3) the position advocated;

(4) the total compensation received for lobbying activities;

(5) any campaign contributions, gifts, or other transfers of value to covered officials or their families.

(d) All registration and disclosure filings shall be publicly available in searchable electronic format within forty-eight hours of filing.

### Section 3. Revolving Door Restrictions

(a) **Cooling-off periods:**

(1) Members of Congress may not engage in lobbying Congress for four years after leaving office.

(2) Senior executive branch officials may not lobby their former agency for four years after leaving office, and may not lobby any executive branch agency for two years after leaving office.

(3) Congressional staff earning above a threshold set by law may not lobby their former House of Congress for two years after leaving employment.

(4) Federal judges may not engage in lobbying for four years after leaving the bench.

(b) **Reverse revolving door:**

(1) No person may be appointed to a position with regulatory authority over an industry in which the person was employed or represented as a lobbyist within the preceding four years.

(2) Waivers may be granted only by the President with written justification published in the Federal Register and subject to congressional review.

(c) **Lifetime ban:** No former covered official may ever represent a foreign government or foreign political party before the United States Government.

(d) Violations of this section shall result in:

(1) civil penalties of up to five times the compensation received for prohibited activities;

(2) forfeiture of federal pension benefits during the period of violation;

(3) criminal prosecution for willful violations.

### Section 3-A. Post-Service Economic Restrictions

(a) **Relationship to Section 3.** This section supplements Section 3. Compliance with the lobbying restrictions of Section 3 does not excuse violation of this section, and compliance with this section does not excuse violation of Section 3. A former official subject to both provisions shall comply with each independently.

(b) **Covered Positions.** For purposes of this section, covered positions are defined in two tiers:

(1) **Tier 1** — positions subject to a five-year cooling-off period:

(i) all positions requiring Senate confirmation;

(ii) all Senior Executive Service positions or equivalent;

(iii) all positions with regulatory, enforcement, or contracting authority over private entities.

(2) **Tier 2** — positions subject to a two-year cooling-off period:

(i) all positions involving access to non-public information relevant to private investment or business decisions;

(ii) congressional staff earning above a threshold set by law;

(iii) other positions designated by the Office of Lobbying Oversight as having substantial private-sector interaction.

(c) **Post-Service Economic Prohibition.** No former holder of a covered position may, during the applicable cooling-off period, accept from a covered entity any employment, compensation, consulting fees, advisory fees, speaking fees, board seats, equity interests, stock options, deferred compensation, or any other arrangement providing economic benefit, regardless of the form such arrangement takes.

(d) **Covered Entities.** The prohibition extends to:

(1) any entity the former official regulated, contracted with, or had substantial official dealings with during the final three years of service;

(2) any subsidiary, affiliate, parent, or successor of such entity;

(3) any trade association of which such entity is a member or substantial funder;

(4) any entity receiving more than twenty-five percent of its revenue from entities described in paragraphs (1) through (3);

(5) any entity substantially controlled by principals of a covered entity.

For officials of agencies with jurisdiction over multiple industries, "regulated, contracted with, or had substantial official dealings with" extends only to entities within the specific sector or industry over which the official had substantial authority, not to all entities within the agency's jurisdiction.

(e) **Family Members.** The prohibitions of subsection (c) extend to compensation paid to or economic benefits conferred upon the immediate family of a former covered official, where such compensation or benefit is designed to circumvent this section. "Immediate family" means the official's spouse, domestic partner, dependent children, and any person sharing a household with the official at the time of separation from service.

(f) **De Minimis and Passive Investment Exceptions.** This section does not prohibit:

(1) ownership of shares in diversified mutual funds, index funds, or exchange-traded funds that are not sector-specific to the official's former regulatory portfolio;

(2) economic relationships below fifty Federal Penalty Units per year in aggregate value;

(3) pre-existing financial arrangements entered into before government service, provided no new economic benefit is conferred during the cooling-off period.

(g) **Penalties.** Violation of this section results in:

(1) civil penalties of up to five times the compensation received for prohibited activities;

(2) forfeiture of federal pension benefits during the period of violation;

(3) criminal prosecution for willful violations;

(4) clawback of all compensation received in violation of this section;

(5) permanent ineligibility for future federal employment.

(h) **Entity-Side Obligations.** Covered entities:

(1) shall certify annually to the Office of Lobbying Oversight that they do not employ, compensate, or provide economic benefit to any former covered official in violation of this section, including by providing compensation or economic benefit to the immediate family of any such official;

(2) that knowingly employ, compensate, or provide economic benefit to a former covered official in violation of this section are subject to civil penalties under Section 9(a) and criminal prosecution under Section 9(b) for willful violations.

(i) **Reporting.** Former holders of covered positions shall file annual employment and compensation disclosures with the Office of Lobbying Oversight for ten years after leaving office. Disclosures shall include all sources of income, board memberships, consulting arrangements, and equity interests.

(j) **Whistleblower Incentive.** Persons who provide original information leading to successful enforcement of this section are eligible for awards under Section 8(d).

(k) **Hardship Exception.** The prohibitions of this section may be waived only upon:

(1) a finding by a federal court that no comparable employment outside the covered sector is available and that the former official's financial circumstances constitute genuine hardship;

(2) limitation that the waiver does not extend to board seats, equity interests, or compensation exceeding civil service pay levels for comparable positions;

(3) public disclosure of the waiver, including the court's findings, within forty-eight hours of issuance.

The Office of Lobbying Oversight may petition for or oppose waivers and shall publish all waiver decisions.

(l) **Relationship to Article II, Section 7-A(k).** Nothing in this section limits the application of Article II, Section 7-A(k) (Revolving Door Restrictions for Constitutional Oversight Bodies). Officials subject to both this section and Article II, Section 7-A(k) shall comply with both; the stricter requirement controls where they overlap.

(m) **Anti-Circumvention.** Any arrangement designed to provide economic benefit to a former covered official or the official's immediate family through intermediaries — including charitable donations to entities affiliated with or substantially benefiting the former official — is subject to the prohibitions of this section regardless of the form of the arrangement.

### Section 4. Foreign Lobbying Restrictions

(a) Any person acting as an agent of a foreign principal shall register with the Office of Lobbying Oversight before engaging in any political activities, lobbying activities, or public relations activities within the United States on behalf of that foreign principal.

(b) "Foreign principal" means:

(2) a foreign political party;

(3) a person outside the United States, unless the person is a citizen of the United States, or a corporation or organization organized under the laws of the United States;

(4) any entity directly or indirectly controlled by a foreign government or foreign national.

(c) Foreign agents shall disclose:

(1) the identity of each foreign principal;

(2) all compensation received from foreign principals;

(3) all activities undertaken on behalf of foreign principals;

(4) all disbursements made in connection with such activities.

(d) Foreign governments and foreign nationals may not:

(1) contribute to any federal, state, or local election campaign;

(2) contribute to any political action committee or independent expenditure organization;

(3) fund lobbying activities directed at Congress or the executive branch except through registered foreign agents.

(e) Any lobbying communication on behalf of a foreign principal shall disclose that fact at the time of the communication.

### Section 10. Active-Service Financial Restrictions

*Resolves Gap 230 — The "Insider" (Congressional Graft). Prohibits covered financial officials from holding individual stocks, cryptocurrency, commodities, private equity, and sector-specific funds during active service, closing the structural conflict of interest that enables insider trading by officials with access to non-public market-moving information.*

(a) **Definitions.** For purposes of this section:

- (1) "Covered financial official" means: the President; the Vice President; any Member of Congress; any federal judge; any principal officer or head of an executive department confirmed by the Senate; any member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; any Senior Executive Service employee; any congressional committee staff member with access to classified or market-sensitive information; and any other officer or employee designated by the Office of Lobbying Oversight under subsection (j).
- (2) "Prohibited asset" means any individual stock, bond (other than United States Treasury obligations and general obligation municipal bonds), commodity, cryptocurrency or digital asset, private equity interest, venture capital interest, hedge fund interest, derivative, option, future, or sector-specific exchange-traded fund or mutual fund.
- (3) "Permitted asset" means United States Treasury securities, general obligation municipal bonds, broad-market index funds or exchange-traded funds that are not sector-specific, money market instruments, and bank deposits.
- (4) "Liquidating trust" means a trust that mandates the sale of all prohibited assets and reinvestment solely in permitted assets within the divestiture period, managed by an independent trustee with no prior relationship to the official.
- (5) "Non-public information" means information obtained through official duties that is not available to the general public and that a reasonable person would expect to affect the market value of a security or other financial instrument.

(b) **Prohibited Holdings.** No covered financial official may own, directly or through any entity in which the official has a beneficial interest, any prohibited asset.

(c) **Mandatory Divestiture.**

- (1) Within ninety (90) days of assuming a covered position, a covered financial official shall divest all prohibited assets or transfer them to a liquidating trust.
- (2) Divestiture of prohibited assets into permitted assets under this section shall be treated as a non-taxable event for purposes of federal income tax. The basis of the original asset carries over to the replacement permitted asset.
- (3) The Office of Lobbying Oversight may grant a hardship extension of up to one (1) year for illiquid assets, including private equity interests, vesting stock options, and real property held in investment entities, upon a showing that divestiture within ninety days would result in substantial financial harm unrelated to the asset's market value.
- (4) Failure to divest or transfer prohibited assets within the required period, including any extension, is grounds for removal from office.

(d) **Anti-Proxy Rule.**

- (1) No covered financial official may communicate non-public information to any person for the purpose of enabling that person to trade in any security, commodity, cryptocurrency, or other financial instrument.
- (2) Violation of this subsection constitutes a high crime within the meaning of Article VIII.
- (3) If a close family member of a covered financial official — defined as spouse, domestic partner, parent, child (including adult child), sibling, or household member — executes a trade in a security or other financial instrument within fourteen (14) days before or after an official act by the covered financial official that materially affects the value of that instrument, a rebuttable presumption arises that the trade was based on non-public information communicated in violation of paragraph (1). The official may overcome this presumption only by demonstrating, by clear and convincing evidence, that no non-public information was communicated.

(e) **Post-Service Trading Restrictions.** The post-service trading restrictions under this section shall be aligned with the tier structure of Section 3-A:

- (1) Tier 1 covered financial officials (Senate-confirmed officers, Members of Congress, federal judges, Federal Reserve Board members) may not, for five (5) years after leaving office, trade in securities of any entity that was subject to their direct regulatory authority, oversight, or official action.
- (2) Tier 2 covered financial officials (SES employees, senior congressional staff, other designated officials) may not, for two (2) years after leaving office, trade in securities of any entity that was subject to their direct regulatory authority, oversight, or official action.
- (3) Profits from trades within the applicable cooling-off period that violate this subsection are subject to disgorgement.

(f) **Enforcement.**

- (1) The Office of Lobbying Oversight shall maintain automated financial surveillance systems to monitor compliance with this section, including detection of prohibited holdings, suspicious trading patterns by close family members, and post-service trading violations.
- (2) Upon detection of a potential violation, the Office shall refer the matter to the Department of Justice within thirty (30) days.
- (3) If the Department of Justice declines to prosecute within one hundred and twenty (120) days of referral, the Office may petition for the appointment of a special counsel under procedures established by law.
- (4) For violations involving federal judges, the Office shall also refer the matter to the Judicial Conference for investigation under Article XIV.

(g) **Penalties.**

- (1) A covered financial official who willfully holds prohibited assets, fails to divest within the required period, or engages in prohibited trading shall be subject to:
    - (i) disgorgement of all profits from the prohibited holdings or trades;
    - (ii) civil penalties of treble the amount of profits gained or losses avoided;
    - (iii) permanent disqualification from holding any federal office.
- (2) Criminal penalties for willful violations shall be as provided by law, notwithstanding the limitations of Section 9(b).
- (3) Negligent violations (failure to timely divest without intent to evade) shall be subject to civil penalties and mandatory divestiture but not criminal prosecution or permanent disqualification.

(h) **Whistleblower Awards.** Any person who provides original information to the Office of Lobbying Oversight leading to a successful enforcement action under this section shall be eligible for an award of ten to thirty percent of penalties collected, consistent with Section 8(d).

(i) **Constitutional Floor.** This section establishes a uniform federal standard for federal officials. Regions and States may impose stricter financial restrictions on their own officials but may not permit conduct prohibited by this section for federal officials serving within their jurisdiction.

(j) **Implementing Legislation.** Congress shall, by law:

- (1) establish the automated surveillance systems and procedures for the Office of Lobbying Oversight under subsection (f);
- (2) designate additional positions subject to this section beyond those enumerated in subsection (a)(1);
- (3) establish procedures for hardship extensions under subsection (c)(3);
- (4) implement the tax-deferred rollover mechanism under subsection (c)(2);
- (5) define standards for the rebuttable presumption under subsection (d)(3);
- (6) establish special counsel procedures under subsection (f)(3);
- (7) establish post-service trading reporting and enforcement procedures;
- (8) provide for any other matter necessary to carry out the purposes of this section.

(k) **Ratification Transition.** Officials serving in covered positions at the time of ratification shall have a one-time election to divest or transfer prohibited assets to a liquidating trust. The divestiture period for officials serving at ratification shall be ninety (90) days for liquid assets and up to one (1) year for illiquid assets, commencing upon the date of ratification.

This section supplements and implements the general prohibition of Section 5(c).

## Relationship to RF Core

If the Regional Federal Constitution is adopted:

- Article IX applies to lobbying of federal officials as specified
- Regions may establish similar requirements for Regional lobbying
- Foreign lobbying restrictions apply regardless of governmental tier

If adopted standalone:

- Article IX applies to lobbying of the federal government
- States may establish parallel requirements for state lobbying
- Federal requirements set a floor, not a ceiling
- Section 10 active-service financial restrictions apply to all covered federal officials regardless of whether Regions exist
- Section 10(i) constitutional floor prevents States from permitting conduct prohibited for federal officials

---

## Design Rationale

### Why Constitutional Level?

- Statutory lobbying reforms have proven ineffective
- Constitutional entrenchment prevents rollback by beneficiaries
- First Amendment concerns require constitutional balancing
- Demonstrates commitment to structural anti-corruption

### Why Four-Year Cooling Off?

- Two years (current law for some positions) is insufficient
- Four years spans typical election cycle
- Reduces value of "access" as primary asset
- Still allows eventual return to private sector

### Why Independent Office?

- Justice Department has conflicts (executive branch oversight)
- Congressional ethics committees are captured
- Independent oversight with single-mission focus
- Director tenure provides insulation from political pressure

### Why Extend Beyond Lobbying to All Economic Relationships?

- Section 3 bans "lobbying" — compensated communications to influence official action
- This leaves employment, consulting, boards, equity, and speaking fees untouched
- The "deferred bribe" operates through employment promises, not lobbying
- 60% of former SEC Directors become securities industry consultants
- Capture operates through implicit reward expectations, not explicit lobbying

### Why Tiered Cooling-Off Periods?

- Not all government employees pose the same revolving door risk
- Senate-confirmed officials and SES regulators have the most influence — five years
- Information-access positions still create risk but less direct — two years
- Flat five-year ban for all would cause brain drain and recruitment failure
- Tier 2 aligns with existing §3(a)(3) two-year staff lobbying ban

### Why Strict Foreign Lobbying Rules?

- Foreign influence undermines self-government
- Constitutional principle: Americans govern America
- Disclosure ensures transparency when engagement occurs
- Lifetime ban for former officials prevents capture

### Why Prohibit Individual Asset Ownership Rather Than Regulate Trading?

- The STOCK Act (2012) attempted to regulate congressional trading and produced zero prosecutions of sitting members
- Disclosure-based regimes fail because the informational advantage is structural and ongoing — officials cannot credibly claim ignorance when their job is to know
- Trading restrictions create complex enforcement problems (timing, intent, materiality)
- Asset prohibition eliminates the conflict at its source: if you cannot hold the asset, you cannot profit from non-public information about it
- Congressional trading systematically outperforms market benchmarks by 6-10% annually, a statistical impossibility without informational advantage

### Why a Liquidating Trust Rather Than a Traditional Blind Trust?

- Traditional blind trusts have been "blind trust theater" — officials receive regular updates, trustees are not truly independent, and the trust retains the prohibited assets
- A liquidating trust mandates actual sale of prohibited assets and reinvestment in permitted assets (broad-market index funds, Treasuries)
- This means the official truly cannot benefit from non-public information about individual companies, because they no longer own individual companies
- The trustee's only discretion is timing and method of liquidation, not ongoing investment decisions

### Why an Anti-Proxy Tipping Rule?

- Prohibiting the official's own holdings does not prevent the official from tipping family members or associates
- The rebuttable presumption for close-family trading near official acts shifts the burden of proof without requiring direct evidence of communication
- This is modeled on SEC insider trading enforcement, which uses circumstantial evidence of tipping
- The "high crime" classification for deliberate tipping ensures that proxy trading through family members carries the same constitutional severity as direct corruption

### Why Tax-Neutral Divestiture?

- Without tax neutrality, officials face a financial penalty for public service — forced realization of capital gains creates a deterrent to entering government
- Tax-deferred rollover (basis carries over) means no immediate tax consequence; taxes are paid when the permitted asset is eventually sold
- This removes the most legitimate objection to mandatory divestiture: that it imposes an unfair financial burden on officials with large unrealized gains

### Why Automated Surveillance?

- Human-discretion enforcement of financial ethics rules has uniformly failed: DOJ rarely investigates sitting members, ethics committees are politically captured, complaints are career suicide for the filer
- Automated detection removes human discretion from the initial identification step: patterns are flagged by algorithm, not political appointee
- Mandatory DOJ referral ensures detected violations cannot be buried
- Special counsel trigger ensures DOJ cannot protect allies by declining prosecution without consequence
