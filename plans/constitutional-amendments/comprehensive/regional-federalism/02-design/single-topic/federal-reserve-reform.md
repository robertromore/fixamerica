## Relationship to RF Core

If the Regional Federal Constitution is adopted:

- Article XV applies to the Federal Reserve as a national institution
- Monetary policy remains exclusively federal
- No Regional role in central banking

If adopted standalone:

- Article XV applies to the existing Federal Reserve System
- Supersedes inconsistent statutory provisions
- Establishes constitutional parameters for monetary policy

---

## Design Rationale

### Why Constitutional Level?

- Monetary policy affects every person and transaction
- Independence from short-term political pressure is essential
- Current statutory framework is vulnerable to interference
- Constitutional entrenchment provides needed stability

### Why Dual Mandate with Price Stability Primary?

- Inflation imposes regressive tax on savings and wages
- Employment goal is important but monetary policy has limits
- Clear hierarchy prevents conflicting objectives
- Numerical target provides accountability

### Why Limit Emergency Powers?

- 2008-2020 experience showed need for emergency authority
- But also showed risk of permanent expansion
- Time limits and congressional oversight prevent mission creep
- Penalty rates and collateral requirements protect taxpayers

### Why Protect Against CBDC Abuse?

- Digital currency could enable total surveillance
- Could enable direct government control of spending
- Congressional authorization with privacy requirements essential
- Preserves choice between digital and physical money
