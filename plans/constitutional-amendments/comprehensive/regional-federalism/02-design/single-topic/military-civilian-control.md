# Article XI: Military and Civilian Control Amendment

## Status: Draft

This standalone constitutional amendment reinforces civilian supremacy over the armed forces, establishes safeguards against domestic military deployment, and creates accountability mechanisms for military operations. It works with either the existing federal/state system or with Regional Federalism.

---

## Article XI — Armed Forces and Civilian Control

### Section 1. Civilian Supremacy

(a) The President of the United States shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States when called into the actual service of the United States.

(b) The chain of command shall run from the President through civilian officials of the Department of Defense to military commanders. No military officer shall be interposed in the chain of command between the President and the civilian Secretary of Defense.

(c) The Secretary of Defense, the Secretaries of the military departments, and all officials with command authority over armed forces shall be civilians who have not served in active duty military service within the preceding seven years.

(d) No active duty military officer shall hold any civil office of the United States, any State, or any Region, except as provided by law for military justice, military education, or military healthcare institutions.

(e) The armed forces shall be nonpartisan. No member of the armed forces on active duty shall engage in partisan political activity, endorse candidates, or participate in political campaigns.

### Section 2. Congressional War Powers

(a) Congress shall have power to declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal, and make rules concerning captures on land and water.

(b) The President may not introduce armed forces into hostilities or imminent hostilities without prior authorization from Congress, except:

(1) to repel a sudden attack on the United States, its territories, possessions, or armed forces;

(2) to protect and evacuate United States citizens abroad when their lives are in imminent danger;

(3) to respond to an armed attack on a treaty ally pursuant to a mutual defense treaty ratified by the Senate, provided that:

- (A) the President notifies Congress within forty-eight hours;
- (B) the President seeks specific authorization from Congress within thirty days;
- (C) operations terminate within sixty days absent such authorization;
- (D) this exception applies only to responses to armed attack on an ally's territory, not to collective security operations, humanitarian interventions, or peacekeeping missions.

(c) Any use of armed forces under subsection (b) shall be reported to Congress within forty-eight hours and shall terminate within sixty days unless Congress has declared war or enacted a specific authorization for the use of military force.

(d) Authorization for the use of military force shall specify:

(1) the objective of the military operation;

(2) the geographic scope of authorized operations;

(3) the enemy, group, or threat against which force is authorized;

(4) the duration of the authorization or conditions for termination;

(5) any limitations on the means or methods of warfare;

(6) a maximum duration not exceeding two years from the date of enactment, subject to reauthorization under subsection (g).

(e) No authorization for the use of military force shall be construed to authorize operations against nations, groups, or threats not specifically identified in the authorization.

(f) Congress may terminate any use of military force by joint resolution not subject to presidential veto.

(g) **Mandatory Reauthorization and Sunset.** No authorization for the use of military force shall remain in effect for more than two years from the date of enactment or most recent reauthorization. Reauthorization shall require:

(1) for the first reauthorization: a majority vote of both chambers of Congress, with the authorization meeting all requirements of subsection (d);

(2) for the second reauthorization: a three-fifths vote of both chambers;

(3) for the third and each subsequent reauthorization: a two-thirds vote of both chambers.

Each reauthorization shall not exceed two years and shall specify any changes in objective, scope, enemy, or limitations since the prior authorization. An authorization that is not reauthorized before expiration terminates automatically, and all military operations conducted under that authorization shall cease, subject to subsection (j).

(h) **Definition of Hostilities.** For purposes of this Article, "hostilities" includes:

(1) any situation in which United States armed forces are engaged in exchanges of fire with hostile forces;

(2) sustained military operations against armed groups, whether or not war has been declared;

(3) the use of armed drones, special operations forces, or offensive cyber operations causing physical destruction or casualties;

(4) any situation meeting the threshold of "armed conflict" under international humanitarian law, including non-international armed conflict;

(5) the presence of United States armed forces in territory where combat operations by any party are ongoing, unless limited to embassy security or diplomatic protection.

A presidential determination that operations do not constitute "hostilities" shall not affect the application of this Article. The question of whether operations constitute hostilities is justiciable and subject to judicial review.

(i) **Legacy Authorization Transition.** Any authorization for the use of military force in effect on the date of ratification of this Article shall:

(1) be brought into compliance with subsection (d) by Congress within one hundred eighty days of ratification, including specification of objective, geographic scope, enemy, duration, and limitations;

(2) expire two years after the date of ratification unless reauthorized in compliance with this section;

(3) not be construed to authorize operations beyond the scope specified in compliance legislation enacted under paragraph (1);

(4) require a recorded vote in each chamber for continued authorization under this subsection.

If Congress fails to enact compliance legislation under paragraph (1) within one hundred eighty days, the authorization shall be deemed to authorize only operations in the specific countries where United States armed forces were conducting operations on the date of ratification, against only the specific entities engaged in hostilities on that date.

(j) **Withdrawal Funding.** Upon termination or expiration of any authorization for the use of military force:

(1) funds necessary for the safe and orderly withdrawal of forces, protection of personnel, and fulfillment of obligations to allied forces shall remain available for a period not exceeding one hundred eighty days;

(2) such withdrawal funding shall not be subject to the automatic reduction provisions of Article X, Section 19;

(3) no withdrawal funding may be used to continue offensive operations;

(4) force protection operations, including defensive actions necessary to protect withdrawing personnel, are authorized during withdrawal.

(k) **Enforcement.** Any member of Congress shall have standing to enforce this section through an action for declaratory or injunctive relief. The United States District Court for the District of Columbia shall have original jurisdiction over such actions, with expedited appeal directly to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court shall decide such appeals within sixty days of filing.

### Section 3. Two-Key Authorization for Domestic Deployment

(a) Armed forces of the United States may not be deployed for domestic law enforcement or to suppress civil disturbance except pursuant to two-key authorization.

(b) **Two-key authorization** requires approval from both:

(1) **Key 1:** The President of the United States, or if the President is unavailable or incapacitated, the next civilian in the line of presidential succession; and

(2) **Key 2:** A majority of the Governors of the States, or if Regional Federalism is adopted, a majority of the Regional Governors. If deployment is limited to a single State or Region, the Governor of that State or Region may satisfy Key 2.

(c) Two-key authorization may not be:

(1) waived by the President or any other official;

(2) delegated to military officers;

(3) satisfied by implied consent, silence, or failure to respond;

(4) obtained retroactively.

(d) Each key holder's authorization must be in writing, signed, and transmitted to both Houses of Congress within twenty-four hours.

(e) Domestic deployment without valid two-key authorization is unlawful. Military commanders may refuse to execute such orders without penalty.

(f) **Exception for invasion or insurrection:** If the territory of the United States is under armed attack by a foreign power or if an armed insurrection has seized control of territory such that civil authority cannot function, the President may deploy armed forces without Key 2 authorization, provided:

(1) Congress is notified within twenty-four hours;

(2) Key 2 authorization is sought within seventy-two hours;

(3) deployment terminates within fourteen days if Key 2 authorization is not obtained.

### Section 4. Prohibited Uses of Armed Forces

(a) Armed forces of the United States shall not be used to:

(1) suppress lawful protest, assembly, or speech;

(2) enforce immigration laws, except to repel armed invasion;

(3) conduct surveillance of United States persons except as authorized by law and warrant;

(4) seize or destroy property except as incident to lawful military operations;

(5) detain United States citizens or lawful residents except pursuant to Act of Congress and subject to judicial review;

(6) interfere with elections, vote counting, or the certification of election results;

(7) enforce the orders or judgments of any person claiming authority not derived from this Constitution;

(8) prevent the lawful assembly of Congress or any State or Regional legislature.

(b) Any order directing armed forces to take action prohibited by this section is unlawful and shall not be obeyed.

(c) No member of the armed forces shall be punished for refusing to obey an order prohibited by this section.

### Section 5. Duty to Refuse Unlawful Orders

(a) Every member of the armed forces has a duty to refuse to obey orders that are manifestly unlawful.

(b) An order is manifestly unlawful if it:

(1) directs the commission of a war crime;

(2) directs action prohibited by Section 4 of this Article;

(3) directs domestic deployment without two-key authorization;

(4) directs action against the United States, its Constitution, or its lawful government;

(5) directs the overthrow, removal, or detention of civilian officials except pursuant to lawful process.

(c) No member of the armed forces may be court-martialed, discharged, demoted, or otherwise punished for refusing an order that is manifestly unlawful under this section.

(d) A member of the armed forces who obeys an order that is manifestly unlawful is personally responsible for the consequences and may not assert obedience to orders as a defense.

(e) The military justice system shall provide expedited procedures for determining whether a refused order was manifestly unlawful.

### Section 6. National Guard and State Defense Forces

(a) The Militia of each State shall consist of the National Guard and such State Defense Forces as the State may establish.

(b) The Governor of each State shall be commander of that State's National Guard except when called into federal service.

(c) The National Guard may be called into federal service:

(1) upon declaration of war by Congress;

(2) upon authorization for use of military force approved by two-thirds of both Houses of Congress;

(3) for domestic deployment pursuant to two-key authorization under Section 3.

(d) Federalization of a State's National Guard over the objection of the Governor requires two-key authorization.

(e) State Defense Forces under exclusive State control may be maintained and are not subject to federalization.

(f) No State shall maintain military forces other than the National Guard and State Defense Forces without the consent of Congress.

### Section 7. Transparency and Accountability

(a) The President shall report to Congress within forty-eight hours of any deployment of armed forces, whether foreign or domestic, and every thirty days thereafter for the duration of the deployment.

(b) Reports under subsection (a) shall include:

(1) the legal authority for the deployment;

(2) the objective and scope of operations;

(3) the number of personnel deployed;

(4) the estimated cost;

(5) any casualties or significant incidents.

(c) The Inspector General of the Department of Defense shall investigate and report to Congress on any alleged violation of this Article.

(d) Any person harmed by a violation of this Article shall have a cause of action for damages against responsible officials, who shall not be entitled to qualified immunity for violations of this Article.

(e) Congress shall appropriate no funds for military operations conducted in violation of this Article. Automatic appropriations under Article X, Section 19, shall not extend to expenditures for military operations for which authorization under Section 2 has expired, been terminated, or was never granted. The Comptroller General shall certify quarterly to Congress and the public whether any funds are being expended on unauthorized military operations. If the Comptroller General identifies unauthorized expenditures, the Comptroller General shall notify Congress and the expenditures shall cease within thirty days unless Congress enacts specific authorization.

### Section 8. Military Justice and Service Member Rights

(a) Members of the armed forces shall retain all rights secured by this Constitution except as expressly limited by the Uniform Code of Military Justice.

(b) No member of the armed forces may be tried by court-martial for offenses committed while off duty and off base that would be within the jurisdiction of civilian courts, unless the offense is service-connected.

(c) Members of the armed forces convicted by court-martial shall have the right to appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces and, for constitutional questions, to the Supreme Court of the United States.

(d) No member of the armed forces may be punished for communicating with a member of Congress concerning any matter.

(e) Members of the armed forces may not be compelled to participate in medical experiments or receive medical treatments not approved for general use, except as necessary to protect against weapons of mass destruction in combat zones.

### Section 9. Counter-Key Authority

(a) If the President orders deployment of armed forces in apparent violation of this Article, any of the following may invoke counter-key authority to suspend the order pending judicial review:

(1) the Speaker of the House of Representatives;

(2) the President pro tempore of the Senate;

(3) a majority of State Governors, or if Regional Federalism is adopted, a majority of Regional Governors;

(4) the Chief Justice of the United States.

(b) Upon invocation of counter-key authority:

(1) the deployment order is suspended;

(2) the Supreme Court shall convene within seventy-two hours to review the legality of the order;

(3) the Court shall issue a decision within seven days;

(4) if the Court finds the order unlawful, the suspension becomes permanent;

(5) if the Court finds the order lawful, the suspension is lifted.

(c) Military commanders who comply with a counter-key suspension shall not be punished for failing to execute the suspended order.

(d) Counter-key authority may not be invoked against deployments authorized by declaration of war.

### Section 10. Judicial Key Override

(a) **Systemic Executive Breach Certification.** If the Supreme Court, by a vote of six or more Justices, certifies a "Systemic Executive Breach"—defined as the President's willful and continuing refusal to comply with a final, non-appealable order of the Supreme Court for a period exceeding thirty days—the following alternative authorization pathway becomes available.

(b) **Alternative Authorization.** Upon such certification, a supermajority of Governors (five of seven Regional Governors, or a majority of all State Governors if Regional Federalism is not adopted) may authorize:

(1) deployment of Regional Guard or State National Guard forces under unified command of a Governor designated by the authorizing majority; or

(2) request that federal military forces be placed under the command of a designated civilian official other than the President;

for the sole and specific purpose of enforcing that particular Supreme Court order.

(c) **Limitations.** Such authorization:

(1) is limited to the minimum force necessary to secure compliance with the specific order;

(2) automatically terminates upon compliance or after ninety days, whichever is sooner;

(3) may be renewed by the same supermajority if non-compliance continues;

(4) does not extend to any purpose beyond enforcement of the certified order.

(d) **Presidential Orders Void.** The President may not order federal forces to resist or obstruct enforcement actions authorized under this section. Any such order is void and unlawful.

(e) **Exclusions.** This section does not apply to policy disagreements, statutory interpretation disputes, or orders that the President is challenging through lawful appellate processes. It applies only to final orders where all appeals are exhausted.

### Section 11. Digital Force Equivalence

(a) **Expanded Definition.** For purposes of this Article, "domestic deployment of force" includes:

(1) Physical deployment of Armed Forces personnel within the United States for purposes other than training, disaster relief, or ceremonial functions;

(2) Activation of National Guard units under federal authority for domestic operations;

(3) **Cyber-kinetic operations** that disable, degrade, or deny access to critical infrastructure serving a State, Region, or sub-regional area;

(4) **Infrastructure interdiction** that restricts a State or Region's access to federal systems, networks, or services upon which governmental operations depend;

(5) **Financial system manipulation** that restricts a State or Region's ability to receive federal transfers, access banking systems, or process government payments;

(6) **Administrative throttling** that degrades service quality to a specific State or Region below the national median without genuine technical justification;

(7) Any action or deliberate inaction that has the practical effect of compelling State or Regional compliance through denial or degradation of essential services, regardless of the mechanism employed.

(b) **Critical Infrastructure.** For purposes of this section, "critical infrastructure" includes:

(1) Electrical generation, transmission, and distribution systems;

(2) Telecommunications and internet connectivity;

(3) Banking, payment processing, and financial clearing systems;

(4) Water supply and treatment systems;

(5) Transportation control systems;

(6) Federal benefit disbursement systems;

(7) Cloud computing and data storage services used by State or Regional governments;

(8) Any other system identified by the Allocation Review Board (or equivalent body) as essential to governmental operations.

(c) **Functional Test.** The determination of whether an action constitutes "domestic force" shall be based on its practical effect on State or Regional autonomy, not on the mechanism employed or the label assigned by the federal government.

(d) **Two-Key Extension.** No cyber-kinetic operation, infrastructure interdiction, financial system manipulation, or administrative throttling affecting a State or Region shall be executed without two-key authorization under Section 3.

(e) **Emergency Exception.** In cases of genuine external cyber attack or infrastructure failure:

(1) The President may take immediate protective measures;

(2) Within forty-eight hours, the President shall certify to Congress and the affected Governors whether the measures constitute "domestic force" under this section;

(3) If certified as domestic force, two-key authorization must be obtained within seventy-two hours or measures must be terminated;

(4) False certification is an impeachable offense and grounds for criminal prosecution.

(f) **Attribution Requirement.** Before any cyber-kinetic operation affecting domestic infrastructure:

(1) The President shall publicly identify the operation and its scope;

(2) State the legal authority for the operation;

(3) Notify the affected State or Region and Congress;

(4) Covert operations against domestic States or Regions are absolutely prohibited;

(5) Operations disguised as "technical failures" or "third-party attacks" shall be treated as two-key violations regardless of actual mechanism.

### Section 12. Infrastructure Independence Guarantees

(a) **Guaranteed Access.** Each State and Region shall have guaranteed, non-revocable access to:

(1) The national electrical grid, subject only to genuine technical safety requirements;

(2) National telecommunications and internet backbone infrastructure;

(3) Federal Reserve payment and clearing systems;

(4) Federal benefit disbursement systems for which residents are eligible;

(5) Federal data systems necessary for governmental operations.

(b) **Prohibition on Weaponization.** The federal government may not:

(1) Condition infrastructure access on policy compliance unrelated to infrastructure operations;

(2) Degrade service quality to specific States or Regions as a coercive measure;

(3) Impose "maintenance windows," "security protocols," or "compliance reviews" that disproportionately affect specific States or Regions without genuine technical justification;

(4) Use infrastructure control as leverage in political disputes.

(c) **Emergency Restoration.** If any State or Region experiences loss of access to critical federal infrastructure for more than seventy-two hours, the affected Governor may certify the disruption to the Supreme Court, which shall issue a preliminary restoration order within twenty-four hours unless the federal government demonstrates genuine technical failure or verified external attack by clear and convincing evidence.

(d) **Presumption of Coercion.** Infrastructure disruption occurring during or within thirty days of a dispute between the federal government and the affected State or Region shall create a rebuttable presumption that the disruption is coercive domestic force requiring two-key authorization.

### Section 13. State Defense Force Limitations

(a) **Personnel Cap.** State Defense Forces shall not exceed:

(1) One-half of one percent (0.5%) of the State's population; or

(2) Ten thousand personnel, whichever is smaller;

(3) Personnel includes all full-time, part-time, and volunteer members.

(b) **Prohibited Capabilities.** State Defense Forces are prohibited from possessing or operating:

(1) Heavy weaponry (crew-served weapons, artillery, missiles);

(2) Armored combat vehicles;

(3) Combat aircraft or armed drones;

(4) Offensive cyber capabilities designed to disrupt, damage, or destroy systems;

(5) Chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear materials or delivery systems.

(c) **Combat Role Definition.** For purposes of State Defense Force limitations, "independent combat role" includes:

(1) Armed confrontation with military, paramilitary, or law enforcement forces;

(2) Offensive cyber operations against government systems, critical infrastructure, or military targets;

(3) Information warfare operations designed to support kinetic military objectives;

(4) Any operation that would constitute an "act of war" if conducted by a foreign nation.

(d) **Automatic Reclassification.** Any State Defense Force that exceeds the personnel cap by more than ten percent, possesses prohibited capabilities, or engages in independent combat roles is automatically reclassified as a National Guard unit subject to federalization.

(e) **Multi-State Coordination Limits.** State Defense Forces from different States may not conduct joint exercises exceeding one thousand combined personnel without federal notification, establish unified command structures, or coordinate operations that would constitute de facto military force.

### Section 14. Congressional Key Override

(a) **Override Authority.** Congress may authorize domestic armed force without Presidential or Governor approval when:

(1) An armed insurrection or invasion threatens constitutional governance;

(2) The President has failed to request two-key authorization within seventy-two hours of the threat; or

(3) Both keys have been requested and withheld for forty-eight hours after request.

(b) **Override Vote Threshold.** Congressional key override requires declaration by four-fifths of the House of Representatives and concurrence by two-thirds of the Senate, both votes within forty-eight hours of each other.

(c) **Override Scope.** Congressional key override authorizes domestic deployment for seventy-two hours initially, may be extended by simple majority of both chambers for additional seventy-two hour periods, and terminates automatically if either the President or Governor majority subsequently provides authorization.

(d) **Independent Insurrection Certification.** The following may independently certify that insurrection exists, reducing the Congressional override threshold to two-thirds House and simple majority Senate:

(1) The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court;

(2) Any three Circuit Chief Judges acting jointly;

(3) The Joint Chiefs of Staff acting unanimously.

(e) **Governor Bypass for Affected Areas.** If the President provides the first key but Governor majority withholds, any affected State's or Region's Governor may provide individual consent for operations within that jurisdiction.

(f) **Anti-Collusion.** The President and Governors may not agree to withhold authorization regardless of circumstances or coordinate refusal to frustrate constitutional response to insurrection. If two-key authorization is withheld during certified insurrection, each refusing official shall provide individual written justification within forty-eight hours.

### Section 15. Officer Corps Independence

(a) **Prohibited Loyalty Requirements.** No military officer may be required to pledge personal loyalty to any individual, removed or disadvantaged for refusing an unlawful order, or required to express support for any political party, candidate, or policy position.

(b) **Protected Refusal.** An officer who refuses an order lacking two-key authorization is presumed to have acted lawfully, may not be relieved of command pending investigation, and may petition for immediate protected status determination.

(c) **Mass Removal Trigger.** If more than five general officers are removed or reassigned within any sixty-day period, the Senate Armed Services Committee shall conduct immediate review and no further removals may occur until review concludes.

(d) **Purge Finding Consequences.** Upon finding of loyalty purge, all removed officers are reinstated pending individual review and the President's military appointment authority is suspended for six months.

(e) **Counter-Deployment Authority.** If federal armed forces are deployed domestically without two-key authorization, the deployment is constitutionally void and affected Governors may activate State National Guard or Regional Guard forces to prevent unauthorized federal military movement, using proportional force while prioritizing de-escalation.

(f) **Commander Accountability.** Any officer who executes a domestic deployment order lacking two-key authorization is personally liable, may be court-martialed after restoration of constitutional order, and may not claim superior orders defense.

(g) **Pardon Limitation.** The President may not pardon officers for violations of the two-key requirement or unlawful domestic deployment. Such pardons are void.

(h) **Joint Chiefs Independence.** The Joint Chiefs of Staff may not be removed except for cause certified by two-thirds of the Senate, have duty to advise Congress directly if they believe unlawful orders have been issued, and may publicly dissent from orders they believe violate the two-key requirement.

## Relationship to RF Core

If the Regional Federal Constitution is adopted:

- Article XI integrates as specified in [Article Crosswalk](../constitution/article-crosswalk.md)
- Regional Guard Forces are established by [Article XI-RF](../constitution/10-armed-forces.md)
- Key 2 authorization shifts from State Governors to Regional Governors

If adopted standalone:

- Article XI applies to the existing federal/state military structure
- State National Guard remains under State Governors
- Key 2 authorization by majority of State Governors

---

## Design Rationale

### Why Two-Key Authorization?

- Prevents unilateral domestic military deployment by the President
- Requires civilian consensus across levels of government
- No single point of failure in checking domestic military use
- Distributes the grave decision to use force domestically

### Why Duty to Refuse?

- "Just following orders" is not a defense for atrocities
- Service members must exercise moral judgment
- Creates friction against unlawful orders at every level
- Protects service members who do the right thing

### Why Counter-Key?

- Provides emergency brake if President acts unlawfully
- Multiple actors can trigger review, preventing capture
- Judicial resolution within days, not months
- Protects commanders who respect constitutional limits

### Why Preserve State National Guard?

- Distributed military capacity prevents concentration of force
- State Governors retain immediate response capability
- Multiple chains of command provide redundancy
- Federalization requires either consent or two-key authorization

### Why Judicial Key Override?

- Prevents executive nullification of Supreme Court orders
- High threshold (6+ Justices plus supermajority of Governors) prevents abuse
- Creates credible deterrent making actual use unlikely
- Maintains civilian control throughout enforcement process

### Why Digital Force Equivalence?

- Modern coercion is primarily digital, not kinetic
- "Bloodless nullification" via infrastructure control as dangerous as military occupation
- Functional definition captures all coercion regardless of mechanism
- Extends constitutional protections to cyber domain

### Why Infrastructure Guarantees?

- Prevents "siege" tactics using federal systems as leverage
- Emergency restoration ensures rapid judicial response
- Presumption of coercion during disputes prevents pretextual claims
- Guaranteed access is positive right, not just prohibition on denial

### Why State Defense Force Limits?

- Prevents States from building "shadow armies" outside two-key framework
- Personnel and capability caps ensure defensive-only posture
- Automatic reclassification creates clear consequence for violations
- Closes cyber/hybrid warfare loopholes in "combat role" definition

### Why Congressional Key Override?

- Provides third key when President and Governors collude for inaction
- 4/5 House threshold ensures genuine emergency consensus
- Independent insurrection certification defeats definitional gaming
- Governor bypass enables response in affected areas despite collective withholding

### Why Officer Corps Independence?

- Prevents loyalty purges that would undermine duty to refuse
- Protected refusal enables officers to follow law without career destruction
- Mass removal trigger catches coordinated purges early
- Counter-deployment authority provides physical enforcement of two-key rule
- Pardon limitation prevents President from immunizing own illegal orders

### Why Mandatory Reauthorization with Escalating Supermajority?

- Two-year sunset forces regular democratic deliberation on ongoing wars
- Aligns with congressional election cycle so voters can hold representatives accountable
- Escalating supermajority (majority → 3/5 → 2/3) makes indefinite wars progressively harder
- Automatic termination removes Congress from the political trap of "voting to abandon troops"
- Default becomes peace, not permanent war

### Why Define Hostilities?

- Presidents have claimed drone campaigns, cyber operations, and special operations are not "hostilities"
- IHL reference anchors definition in established international law rather than executive self-serving interpretation
- Enumerated list closes known semantic evasion routes (Libya 2011, Yemen, Niger)
- Justiciability clause ensures courts can review presidential classification attempts

### Why Legacy AUMF Transition?

- 2001 AUMF has been used to justify operations in countries that did not exist when it was enacted
- 180-day compliance window gives Congress time to bring existing authorizations into §2(d) compliance
- Two-year maximum prevents indefinite continuation under grandfathered authority
- Fallback clause (operations limited to date-of-ratification scope) prevents congressional inaction from creating a loophole

### Why Auto-CR Carve-Out for Unauthorized Operations?

- Article X, Section 19 automatically re-appropriates prior-year funding at 98%, which would keep unauthorized military operations funded
- Without the carve-out, §7(e) is a dead letter: Congress says "no funds" but Auto-CR says "98% of last year"
- Comptroller General identification and quarantine creates active enforcement rather than passive prohibition
- Withdrawal funding exemption ensures troop safety is never held hostage

### Why Treaty Exception with Time Limit?

- §2(b)(1) only covers attacks on US territory/forces, leaving NATO Article 5 scenarios uncovered
- Narrow exception (armed attack on ally only, not collective security or peacekeeping) prevents expansion
- 30-day authorization requirement and 60-day termination ensure Congress retains control
- Prevents treaty obligations from becoming blank checks for executive war-making
