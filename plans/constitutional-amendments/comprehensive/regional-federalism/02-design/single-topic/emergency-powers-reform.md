## Article XVII — Emergency Powers

### Section 1. Declaration Requirements

(a) The President may declare a national emergency only by written proclamation that specifies:

(1) the nature and cause of the emergency;

(2) the geographic scope of the emergency;

(3) the category of emergency under Section 2;

(4) the specific powers to be exercised under Section 3;

(5) the duration of the emergency, not to exceed the limits in Section 4;

(6) the conditions for termination.

(b) The proclamation shall be transmitted to Congress and published within twenty-four hours.

(c) No emergency may be declared retroactively. Emergency powers may be exercised only prospectively from the time of declaration.

### Section 2. Emergency Categories

(a) Emergencies shall be declared under one of the following categories:

(1) **Natural Disaster**: earthquake, hurricane, flood, wildfire, tsunami, volcanic eruption, or similar natural event causing widespread harm;

(2) **Public Health**: epidemic, pandemic, or biological threat presenting imminent danger to public health;

(3) **Economic**: severe financial crisis, systemic banking failure, or economic collapse threatening essential functions of commerce;

(4) **National Security**: armed attack, invasion, insurrection, or imminent threat thereof;

(5) **Constitutional Crisis**: as defined in Section 9.

(b) Each declaration shall specify a single category. If multiple categories apply, separate declarations shall be made for each.

(c) The category declared determines the powers available under Section 3 and the time limits under Section 4.

### Section 3. Enumerated Emergency Powers

(a) **Natural Disaster emergencies** authorize:

(1) deployment of federal resources for rescue, relief, and recovery;

(2) waiver of administrative requirements that impede emergency response;

(3) coordination of federal, State, and local response efforts;

(4) temporary housing and shelter assistance.

(b) **Public Health emergencies** authorize:

(1) quarantine and isolation measures based on scientific evidence;

(2) emergency use authorization for medical countermeasures;

(3) allocation and distribution of medical supplies;

(4) coordination of public health response across jurisdictions;

(5) mandatory collection and sharing of epidemiological data by all subnational governments within twenty-four hours of collection;

(6) federal direct implementation of public health measures within non-compliant jurisdictions through civilian agencies when subnational governments fail to implement mandated measures after notice and opportunity to comply.

(c) **Economic emergencies** authorize:

(1) emergency lending facilities through the Federal Reserve;

(2) temporary guarantee of deposits or financial instruments;

(3) coordination of regulatory forbearance across agencies;

(4) emergency appropriations requests to Congress.

(d) **National Security emergencies** authorize:

(2) activation of civil defense measures;

(3) emergency procurement authority;

(4) enhanced border security measures.

(e) **Constitutional Crisis emergencies** authorize only the powers specified in Section 9.

(f) No emergency declaration shall authorize powers beyond those enumerated for its category. The President shall have no inherent emergency powers beyond this enumeration.

### Section 4. Time Limits

(a) Emergency declarations shall expire automatically as follows:

(1) Natural Disaster: one year, renewable by Congress for one-year periods;

(2) Public Health: one year, renewable by Congress for six-month periods;

(3) Economic: two years, renewable by Congress for one-year periods;

(4) National Security: sixty days without congressional authorization; thereafter, as Congress provides by law;

(5) Constitutional Crisis: as specified in Section 9.

(b) Congress may terminate any emergency at any time by joint resolution, which shall not be subject to presidential veto.

(c) If Congress fails to reauthorize an emergency before expiration, the emergency terminates automatically. All emergency powers cease immediately upon termination.

(d) No emergency may be renewed more than twice under subsection (a) without a two-thirds vote of both Houses of Congress.

(e) **Absolute Duration Limit.** No emergency declaration, including all renewals under this section, shall remain in effect for a cumulative period exceeding two years from the date of the initial declaration. Constitutional Crisis emergencies under Section 9 are exempt from this limit. Upon reaching the two-year limit, the emergency shall terminate with a thirty-day wind-down period during which the President may exercise only such powers as are strictly necessary for orderly restoration of normal governance under Section 7.

(f) **Nexus Re-demonstration and Recorded Vote.** Each renewal of an emergency under this section shall include:

(1) a written re-certification by the President that:

- (A) the conditions that gave rise to the emergency continue to exist and meet the criteria for the declared category;

- (B) there is a specific nexus between those continuing conditions and each power sought for the renewal period; and

- (C) the powers sought remain necessary and proportionate to the continuing emergency;

(2) All congressional votes on emergency renewal, extension, or re-authorization under this Article shall be by recorded vote. No renewal may be approved by voice vote, unanimous consent, or any procedure that does not produce a public record of each member's individual vote.

### Section 5. Congressional Oversight

(a) The President shall report to Congress every thirty days during any emergency on:

(1) actions taken under emergency authority;

(2) expenditures made under emergency authority;

(3) assessment of continued necessity;

(4) progress toward termination conditions.

(b) Congress shall meet within forty-eight hours of any emergency declaration to receive the President's submission and may immediately vote on termination.

(c) Each House shall establish a standing committee to oversee emergency powers, with authority to subpoena documents and testimony.

(d) The Comptroller General shall audit all emergency expenditures and report to Congress within ninety days of emergency termination.

### Section 6. Judicial Review

(a) Any person aggrieved by the exercise of emergency powers may challenge the declaration or any action taken thereunder in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or any district where the person resides or the action has effect.

(b) Courts shall apply the following standards of review:

(1) whether the emergency meets the criteria for its declared category;

(2) whether the powers exercised are within those enumerated for that category;

(3) whether the exercise of power is necessary and proportionate to the emergency;

(4) whether constitutional rights have been violated.

(c) No doctrine of deference to executive judgment shall preclude judicial review under this section. Courts shall make independent findings on all questions.

(d) Actions challenging emergency declarations shall be expedited and decided within thirty days.

### Section 7. Restoration Mandate

(a) Upon termination of any emergency:

(1) all emergency powers shall cease immediately;

(2) all regulations, orders, and directives issued under emergency authority shall expire within thirty days unless reenacted through normal legislative or regulatory process;

(3) all persons detained under emergency authority shall be released or charged under ordinary criminal law;

(4) all property seized under emergency authority shall be returned or compensation paid.

(b) The President shall submit to Congress within sixty days of termination a restoration report detailing:

(1) all actions taken to restore normal operations;

(2) any continuing effects of the emergency;

(3) recommendations for permanent legislation, if any.

(c) Congress shall hold hearings on the restoration report and may by law extend the thirty-day period in subsection (a)(2) for specific regulations upon finding necessity.

### Section 8. Habeas Corpus and Fundamental Rights

(a) The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended except when in cases of invasion or rebellion the public safety may require it, and then only by Act of Congress specifying:

(1) the geographic area of suspension;

(2) the duration, not to exceed ninety days;

(3) the categories of persons subject to detention;

(4) the procedures for detention and review.

(b) Even during suspension, every person detained shall:

(1) be informed of the grounds for detention within forty-eight hours;

(2) have access to counsel;

(3) have the right to challenge detention before a neutral adjudicator within fourteen days;

(4) be released if the adjudicator finds no reasonable basis for detention.

(c) No emergency shall authorize:

(1) torture or cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment;

(2) collective punishment;

(3) punishment without individual determination of wrongdoing;

(4) discrimination on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, or national origin;

(5) suppression of speech or press except as narrowly necessary to prevent immediate harm.

(d) Any person whose rights under this section are violated shall have a cause of action for damages against responsible officials, who shall not be entitled to qualified immunity for violations of this section.

### Section 9. Constitutional Crisis

(a) A constitutional crisis exists when:

(1) a branch of the federal government refuses to perform a duty expressly required by this Constitution;

(2) a branch of the federal government claims power expressly denied by this Constitution;

(3) multiple branches assert conflicting constitutional interpretations and refuse to accept judicial resolution;

(4) the normal processes of constitutional government have broken down such that essential functions cannot be performed.

(b) Only Congress may declare a constitutional crisis, by two-thirds vote of both Houses.

### Section 10. Prohibition on Emergency Expansion of Power

(a) No emergency shall serve as the basis for claiming powers not granted by this Constitution.

(b) Emergency powers exist only as specified in this Article. No inherent, implied, or residual emergency power shall be recognized.

(c) No emergency shall authorize amendment of this Constitution except through the procedures established in Article V.

(d) No pattern of emergency declarations shall establish precedent for expanded executive power. Each emergency stands alone and confers no authority beyond its duration.

(e) Any claim of emergency power not authorized by this Article is void ab initio.

### Section 11. Bio-Security Emergency Escalation

*Resolves Gap 206 — The "Petri Dish" (Bio-Security Anarchy). Addresses the speed mismatch between pandemic spread (3-7 day doubling time) and normal constitutional floor-setting processes (60+ days), and the risk that a subnational government refuses cooperation with communicable disease response.*

(a) **Bio-Security Emergency Declaration.** When a Public Health emergency under Section 2(2) involves a communicable pathogen, the President may escalate the declaration to a Bio-Security Emergency upon joint certification by the Surgeon General and the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that:

(1) the pathogen meets quantitative criteria — basic reproduction number (R0) exceeding 2.0 and case fatality rate exceeding 0.5% based on available epidemiological evidence; or

(2) the pathogen poses significant pandemic risk based on professional judgment concerning transmissibility, severity, novelty, or combination thereof, even if quantitative thresholds have not been established due to insufficient data; and

(3) there is evidence of sustained community transmission within the United States, or an international outbreak poses imminent threat of domestic spread.

(b) **Temporary Override of Concurrent Authority.** During a Bio-Security Emergency:

(1) Public health measures authorized under Section 3(b) and this section shall operate as direct federal requirements that supersede conflicting subnational laws, regulations, and executive orders concerning communicable disease response;

(2) The normal floor-setting process (including any supermajority vote and certification requirements) is suspended for communicable disease response measures for the duration of the emergency;

(3) This override applies only to communicable disease response. Non-communicable public health matters remain governed by existing authority allocation.

(c) **Mandatory Data Sharing.** During a Bio-Security Emergency:

(1) all subnational governments shall transmit epidemiological data — including case counts, testing data, hospitalization rates, genomic sequencing results, and mortality data — to the federal public health authority within twenty-four hours of collection;

(2) all subnational governments shall permit federal epidemiological personnel unrestricted access to healthcare facilities, laboratories, and public health records relevant to the emergency;

(3) suppression, falsification, or material delay of public health data by any government official constitutes obstruction of federal emergency response and is punishable under federal law;

(4) officials responsible for data suppression or falsification are personally liable and may not claim sovereign immunity or official immunity.

(d) **Enforcement — Civilian Primacy.** Enforcement of Bio-Security Emergency measures shall follow civilian-first escalation:

(1) **Notice.** The federal government shall provide written notice specifying the non-compliance and required measures, and allow seventy-two (72) hours for voluntary compliance;

(2) **Fiscal Consequences.** Non-compliant jurisdictions forfeit federal public health funding, disaster assistance, and emergency appropriations for the duration of non-compliance;

(3) **Federal Direct Implementation.** If a jurisdiction fails to implement mandated measures after the compliance window, federal civilian agencies may directly implement public health measures within the non-compliant jurisdiction;

(4) **Judicial Enforcement.** Federal courts may issue injunctions requiring compliance and impose contempt sanctions on non-compliant officials, including personal fines and incarceration;

(5) **Military Support — Last Resort.** Armed forces may be deployed to support bio-security enforcement only upon exhaustion of civilian enforcement mechanisms and only pursuant to applicable domestic deployment authorization requirements. Military personnel deployed for bio-security support shall operate under civilian public health authority direction and may not exercise law enforcement powers against civilians.

(e) **Duration and Review.**

(1) A Bio-Security Emergency expires after ninety (90) days unless renewed by majority vote of both Houses of Congress;

(2) Congress shall review the emergency every thirty (30) days and may terminate it by joint resolution not subject to presidential veto;

(3) The temporary override of concurrent authority under subsection (b) terminates immediately upon expiration or termination of the emergency;

(4) No Bio-Security Emergency may be renewed more than twice without a two-thirds vote of both Houses of Congress.

(f) **Expedited Judicial Review.** Notwithstanding Section 6(d):

(1) any person or subnational government may challenge a Bio-Security Emergency declaration or any measure taken thereunder;

(2) courts shall decide challenges within seventy-two (72) hours of filing;

(3) courts may enjoin specific measures found to be unconstitutional, disproportionate, or unsupported by scientific evidence, even during an active emergency;

(4) no doctrine of deference to executive judgment shall preclude review under this subsection.

(g) **Anti-Abuse Provisions.** No Bio-Security Emergency declaration or measure taken thereunder may be used to:

(1) restrict the right to vote, campaign for office, or participate in elections;

(2) suppress political speech, protest, or assembly beyond scientifically justified restrictions on mass gatherings that apply uniformly regardless of content or viewpoint;

(3) impose restrictions that discriminate on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, or political affiliation;

(4) extend the term of any elected official or delay any scheduled election.

(h) **Compensation.** The federal government shall provide equitable compensation to subnational governments and individuals for direct economic losses attributable to federally mandated bio-security measures. Congress shall establish by law a Bio-Security Compensation Fund and claims procedures within one year of ratification of this Article.

### Section 12. Serial Emergency Prevention

*Resolves Gap 169 — Serial Emergency Loophole. Establishes federal anti-ratcheting provisions mirroring the Regional safeguards in Article XVII-RF, Section 2(e)-(h).*

(a) **Prohibition on Sequential Category Switching.** The President may not declare an emergency under a different category within thirty days of the termination or expiration of a prior emergency if:

(1) the new declaration addresses substantially the same underlying conditions as the prior emergency;

(2) the primary purpose of the new declaration is to obtain powers unavailable under the prior category; or

(3) the cumulative duration of sequential emergency declarations addressing the same conditions would exceed the absolute duration limit established in Section 4(e).

(b) **Cooling-Off Period.** Following termination of any emergency that reached its maximum renewal limit under Section 4(d) or its absolute duration limit under Section 4(e), no new emergency of the same category addressing substantially similar conditions may be declared for a period of one hundred eighty days, unless:

(1) a genuinely new triggering event occurs that is independent of the prior emergency conditions; and

(2) Congress certifies by two-thirds vote of both Houses that the new declaration is not an attempt to circumvent the duration or renewal limits of this Article.

(c) **Cumulative Duration Tracking.** The Comptroller General shall maintain a public registry of all emergency declarations, their categories, stated justifications, and cumulative durations. Any pattern of declarations that cumulatively exceeds twice the absolute duration limit under Section 4(e) for any category within any five-year period shall trigger mandatory review by both Houses of Congress, which must affirmatively vote to permit any further declarations of that category.

(d) **Judicial Review of Successive Declarations.** Any person may challenge a successive emergency declaration as violating this section. Courts shall apply strict scrutiny, requiring the President to demonstrate that the new declaration addresses genuinely distinct conditions and is not designed to evade the limitations of this Article. The expedited review provisions of Section 6(d) apply.

---

### Section 13. Legacy Emergency Transition

*Resolves Gap 227 — Emergency Zombie / Permanent Crisis (jointly with Section 12 and Section 4(e)-(f)). Establishes transition rules for emergencies in effect at ratification.*

(a) **Mandatory Expiration.** All emergency declarations in effect on the date of ratification of this Article shall expire one hundred eighty days after ratification, regardless of the authority under which they were originally declared.

(b) **Re-declaration Under This Article.** The President may, within the one hundred eighty day transition period, re-declare any expiring emergency under this Article. Any such re-declaration shall comply with all requirements of this Article, including:

(1) category designation under Section 2;

(2) enumerated powers under Section 3;

(3) written declaration meeting all requirements of Section 1; and

(4) time limits under Section 4, with the two-year absolute duration limit running from the date of re-declaration.

(c) **Expedited Congressional Review.** During the one hundred eighty day transition period, Congress may approve re-declarations by majority vote of both Houses, with each vote taken as a recorded vote. Re-declarations not approved by Congress before expiration of the transition period terminate automatically.

(d) **Sanctions and IEEPA Programs.** Emergency declarations supporting sanctions programs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act or similar statutes shall be categorized as Economic emergencies under Section 2(3) for purposes of re-declaration. Congress may by law establish alternative non-emergency statutory authority for sanctions programs that do not require emergency status.

(e) **Inventory Requirement.** Within thirty days of ratification, the President shall transmit to Congress a complete inventory of all emergency declarations then in effect, including for each: the original declaration date, the statutory authority invoked, the powers exercised, and a recommendation as to whether the emergency should be re-declared, converted to non-emergency statutory authority, or allowed to expire.

## Relationship to RF Core

If the Regional Federal Constitution is adopted:

- Article XVII integrates as specified in [Article Crosswalk](../constitution/article-crosswalk.md)
- Regional emergency authority is established by [Article XVII-RF](../constitution/11-emergency-powers.md)
- Regional Governors may declare Regional emergencies under RF Supplement

If adopted standalone:

- Article XVII applies to federal emergency powers under current structure
- States retain authority over state emergencies under state law
- No Regional emergency tier exists

---

## Design Rationale

### Why Categorized Emergencies?

- Different crises require different responses
- Enumerated powers prevent mission creep
- Category-specific time limits reflect actual recovery timelines
- Prevents declaring one type of emergency to gain powers appropriate to another

### Why Strict Time Limits?

- Emergencies must end; permanent emergency is tyranny
- Automatic expiration prevents congressional inertia from extending emergencies
- Renewal requirements force periodic justification
- Supermajority for extended renewal ensures broad consensus

### Why Restoration Mandate?

- Emergency powers are loans, not gifts
- Government must actively restore normalcy
- Prevents emergency measures from becoming permanent by inertia
- Creates accountability for the full emergency lifecycle

### Why Constitutional Crisis Category?

- Some crises cannot be addressed by executive action alone
- Requires legislative supermajority to prevent partisan abuse
- Strictly limited powers focused on restoration, not expansion
- Explicit prohibition on using crisis to extend terms or cancel elections

### Why Absolute Duration Limit?

- Two years is sufficient for genuine emergencies to be addressed or for Congress to enact permanent legislation
- Prevents the "emergency zombie" phenomenon where emergencies persist for decades
- Category-specific renewals already provide flexibility within the two-year envelope
- Constitutional Crisis exemption preserves the escape valve for truly existential situations
- Forces the political system to address root causes rather than maintain permanent emergency governance

### Why Serial Emergency Prevention?

- Category switching allows executives to evade renewal limits by re-labeling the same crisis
- Cooling-off periods prevent immediate re-declaration after maximum duration
- Cumulative tracking reveals patterns of serial emergency governance
- Strict scrutiny judicial review ensures genuine novelty, not relabeling
- Mirrors Regional safeguards in Article XVII-RF, Section 2(e)-(h) at the federal level

### Why Legacy Transition?

- Approximately forty emergency declarations currently in effect, some dating to the 1970s
- Immediate termination would disrupt sanctions programs and other ongoing measures
- One hundred eighty day transition allows orderly re-evaluation under new framework
- Encourages Congress to convert permanent sanctions programs from emergency authority to standalone legislation
- Every pre-existing emergency must justify its continuation under the new accountability framework
