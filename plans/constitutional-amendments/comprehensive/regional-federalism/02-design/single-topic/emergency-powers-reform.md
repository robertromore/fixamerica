## Implementation Notes

This amendment requires implementing legislation including:

- Emergency Management Procedures Act (detailed implementation of declaration process)
- Emergency Powers Oversight Act (congressional committee structure and procedures)
- Judicial Review of Emergency Powers Act (expedited procedures and venue)
- Constitutional Crisis Response Act (procedures for Section 9 declarations)

---

## Relationship to RF Core

If the Regional Federal Constitution is adopted:

- Article XVII integrates as specified in [Article Crosswalk](../constitution/article-crosswalk.md)
- Regional emergency authority is established by [Article XVII-RF](../constitution/11-emergency-powers.md)
- Regional Governors may declare Regional emergencies under RF Supplement

If adopted standalone:

- Article XVII applies to federal emergency powers under current structure
- States retain authority over state emergencies under state law
- No Regional emergency tier exists

## Design Rationale

### Why Categorized Emergencies?

- Different crises require different responses
- Enumerated powers prevent mission creep
- Category-specific time limits reflect actual recovery timelines
- Prevents declaring one type of emergency to gain powers appropriate to another

### Why Strict Time Limits?

- Emergencies must end; permanent emergency is tyranny
- Automatic expiration prevents congressional inertia from extending emergencies
- Renewal requirements force periodic justification
- Supermajority for extended renewal ensures broad consensus

### Why Restoration Mandate?

- Emergency powers are loans, not gifts
- Government must actively restore normalcy
- Prevents emergency measures from becoming permanent by inertia
- Creates accountability for the full emergency lifecycle

### Why Constitutional Crisis Category?

- Some crises cannot be addressed by executive action alone
- Requires legislative supermajority to prevent partisan abuse
- Strictly limited powers focused on restoration, not expansion
- Explicit prohibition on using crisis to extend terms or cancel elections
