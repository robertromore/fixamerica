## Article VIII — Impeachment

### Section 1. Officers Subject to Impeachment

(a) The President, Vice President, and all civil officers of the United States shall be subject to impeachment.

(b) Civil officers include:

(1) Cabinet secretaries and heads of executive departments and agencies;

(2) Justices of the Supreme Court and judges of inferior federal courts;

(3) Ambassadors and other principal officers appointed with Senate confirmation;

(4) Such other officers as Congress may by law designate.

(c) Members of Congress are not civil officers for purposes of impeachment and shall be subject to expulsion by their respective Houses under Article I.

### Section 2. Grounds for Impeachment

(a) The President, Vice President, and all civil officers of the United States shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.

(b) High crimes and misdemeanors include:

(1) abuse of the powers of office for personal benefit or to harm political opponents;

(2) corruption, including accepting bribes, emoluments, or improper payments;

(3) obstruction of justice or interference with lawful investigations;

(4) violation of the constitutional rights of persons;

(5) refusal to comply with lawful subpoenas or congressional oversight;

(6) betrayal of the national interest to foreign powers;

(7) incitement or facilitation of insurrection or rebellion;

(8) gross negligence or dereliction of duty causing serious harm to the nation;

(9) conduct that renders the officer manifestly unfit to continue in office.

(c) An act need not be a criminal offense to constitute a high crime or misdemeanor. The standard is whether the conduct is a serious breach of the public trust.

(d) Conduct occurring before taking office may be grounds for impeachment if it:

(1) was concealed and would have prevented confirmation or election;

(2) demonstrates unfitness for the office held;

(3) constitutes an ongoing threat to the proper functioning of government.

### Section 3. House Impeachment Procedures

(a) The House of Representatives shall have the sole power of impeachment.

(b) Impeachment proceedings shall be initiated by:

(1) resolution referred to the Judiciary Committee or a special committee designated by the Speaker;

(2) report from a standing committee with jurisdiction over the officer or subject matter;

(3) petition signed by one-third of the members of the House.

(c) The committee conducting the investigation shall:

(1) have subpoena power for documents and testimony;

(2) allow the officer under investigation to be represented by counsel;

(3) permit the officer to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses;

(4) provide the minority party proportional representation and the right to call witnesses;

(5) complete its investigation and report within one hundred eighty days of referral, unless extended by majority vote.

(d) Articles of impeachment shall be reported to the full House with:

(1) specific charges stated with particularity;

(2) the evidence supporting each charge;

(3) minority views, if any.

(e) The House shall debate articles of impeachment and vote on each article separately. A majority vote of the House is required to adopt any article.

(f) Upon adoption of one or more articles, the House shall appoint managers to prosecute the impeachment before the Senate.

### Section 4. Senate Trial Procedures

(a) The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments. When sitting for that purpose, Senators shall be on oath or affirmation.

(b) When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside. When any other officer is tried, the Vice President shall preside, or if the Vice President has a conflict of interest, the President pro tempore.

(c) The presiding officer shall rule on all questions of evidence and procedure, subject to appeal to the full Senate by majority vote.

(d) Trial procedures shall include:

(1) opening statements by the House managers and counsel for the officer;

(2) presentation of evidence by the House managers;

(3) presentation of evidence by the officer;

(4) examination and cross-examination of witnesses;

(5) closing arguments;

(6) deliberation in closed session;

(7) public vote on each article.

(e) The Senate trial shall commence within thirty days of receiving articles from the House and shall proceed on consecutive days until concluded, absent extraordinary circumstances determined by two-thirds vote.

(f) Senators shall not engage in ex parte communications with the parties during trial and shall base their judgment solely on the evidence presented.

(g) No person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two-thirds of the Senators present.

(h) The Senate shall vote separately on removal and disqualification. Removal requires two-thirds vote; disqualification from future office requires majority vote after conviction.

### Section 5. Judgment and Consequences

(a) Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than removal from office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.

(b) A person convicted on impeachment shall be removed from office immediately upon the announcement of the verdict.

(c) A person convicted and disqualified may petition the Senate for removal of the disqualification after ten years. Restoration requires a two-thirds vote.

(d) The party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment, and punishment according to law.

(e) A pardon by the President shall not restore eligibility for office following disqualification by the Senate.

(f) Resignation after impeachment proceedings have commenced shall not bar continuation of the proceedings, including conviction and disqualification.

### Section 6. Expedited Procedures for Emergencies

(a) If the House determines by two-thirds vote that an officer poses an immediate threat to the constitutional order, national security, or public safety, it may invoke expedited procedures.

(b) Under expedited procedures:

(1) the committee investigation shall be completed within thirty days;

(2) House floor consideration shall occur within seven days of committee report;

(3) the Senate trial shall commence within seven days of receiving articles and shall be completed within twenty-one days.

(c) The officer may be suspended without pay pending the Senate trial upon majority vote of the Senate, provided:

(1) the suspension is reviewed by the Senate every fourteen days;

(2) the officer retains the right to counsel and to prepare a defense;

(3) if acquitted, the officer shall be restored to office with back pay.

### Section 7. Judicial Officers

(a) Judges of the Supreme Court and inferior federal courts may be impeached under the same procedures as other civil officers.

(b) In addition to impeachment, Congress may by law establish procedures for:

(1) temporary suspension of judges credibly accused of serious misconduct, pending investigation;

(2) mandatory retirement for physical or mental incapacity;

(3) discipline short of removal for lesser misconduct.

(c) No judge shall be removed, suspended, or disciplined for the content of judicial opinions or decisions, unless the opinion constitutes an impeachable offense under Section 2.

### Section 8. Protection Against Abuse

(a) No officer may be impeached twice for the same conduct if acquitted by the Senate.

(b) Impeachment proceedings shall not be used to punish officers for lawful exercise of their constitutional duties.

(c) An officer who believes impeachment proceedings are pretextual or unconstitutional may seek expedited review in the Supreme Court, which shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over such claims.

(d) The Supreme Court may dismiss articles of impeachment that:

(1) fail to allege conduct that could constitute a high crime or misdemeanor under Section 2;

(2) violate the prohibition on double jeopardy under subsection (a);

(3) are demonstrably pretextual.

(e) Judicial review under this section is limited to the sufficiency of the charges, not the factual merits, which remain exclusively for the Senate.

## Implementation Notes

This amendment requires implementing legislation including:

- House Impeachment Procedures Act (committee rules, witness procedures, timeline enforcement)
- Senate Trial Rules (evidence standards, presiding officer duties)
- Judicial Discipline Act (procedures for suspension and incapacity under Section 7)

## Relationship to RF Core

If the Regional Federal Constitution is adopted:

- Article VIII applies to federal officers as specified
- Regional officers are subject to Regional impeachment procedures under Regional constitutions
- No RF Supplement is required; impeachment applies uniformly to federal government

If adopted standalone:

- Article VIII replaces current impeachment provisions in Articles I and II
- Applies to all federal officers subject to current impeachment provisions

---

## Design Rationale

### Why Enumerate Grounds?

- Current Constitution's "high crimes and misdemeanors" is undefined
- Enumeration provides guidance without being exclusive
- Clarifies that criminal conduct is not required
- Establishes principled standard: breach of public trust

### Why Timeline Requirements?

- Prevents indefinite investigations as political weapons
- Ensures prompt resolution of questions about officer fitness
- Expedited procedures available for genuine emergencies
- Balances speed with due process

### Why Allow Judicial Review?

- Prevents purely pretextual impeachments
- Review limited to sufficiency of charges, not merits
- Senate remains sole judge of facts and ultimate decision
- Protects against use of impeachment to punish lawful conduct

### Why Continue After Resignation?

- Resignation should not be an escape from accountability
- Disqualification from future office serves public interest
- Prevents strategic resignation to preserve future eligibility
- Historical precedent supports continuation
