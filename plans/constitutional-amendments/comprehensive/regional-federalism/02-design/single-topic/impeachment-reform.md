## Article VIII — Impeachment

### Section 1. Officers Subject to Impeachment

(a) The President, Vice President, and all civil officers of the United States shall be subject to impeachment.

(b) Civil officers include:

(1) Cabinet secretaries and heads of executive departments and agencies;

(2) Justices of the Supreme Court and judges of inferior federal courts;

(3) Ambassadors and other principal officers appointed with Senate confirmation;

(4) Such other officers as Congress may by law designate.

(c) Members of Congress are not civil officers for purposes of impeachment and shall be subject to expulsion by their respective Houses under Article I.

### Section 2. Grounds for Impeachment

(a) The President, Vice President, and all civil officers of the United States shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.

(b) High crimes and misdemeanors include:

(1) abuse of the powers of office for personal benefit or to harm political opponents;

(2) corruption, including accepting bribes, emoluments, or improper payments;

(3) obstruction of justice or interference with lawful investigations;

(4) violation of the constitutional rights of persons;

(5) refusal to comply with lawful subpoenas or congressional oversight;

(6) betrayal of the national interest to foreign powers;

(7) incitement or facilitation of insurrection or rebellion;

(8) gross negligence or dereliction of duty causing serious harm to the nation;

(9) conduct that renders the officer manifestly unfit to continue in office.

(c) An act need not be a criminal offense to constitute a high crime or misdemeanor. The standard is whether the conduct is a serious breach of the public trust.

(d) Conduct occurring before taking office may be grounds for impeachment if it:

(1) was concealed and would have prevented confirmation or election;

(2) demonstrates unfitness for the office held;

(3) constitutes an ongoing threat to the proper functioning of government.

### Section 3. House Impeachment Procedures

(a) The House of Representatives shall have the sole power of impeachment.

(b) Impeachment proceedings shall be initiated by:

(1) resolution referred to the Judiciary Committee or a special committee designated by the Speaker;

(2) report from a standing committee with jurisdiction over the officer or subject matter;

(3) petition signed by one-third of the members of the House.

(c) The committee conducting the investigation shall:

(1) have subpoena power for documents and testimony;

(2) allow the officer under investigation to be represented by counsel;

(3) permit the officer to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses;

(4) provide the minority party proportional representation and the right to call witnesses;

(5) complete its investigation and report within one hundred eighty days of referral, unless extended by majority vote.

(d) Articles of impeachment shall be reported to the full House with:

(1) specific charges stated with particularity;

(2) the evidence supporting each charge;

(3) minority views, if any.

(e) The House shall debate articles of impeachment and vote on each article separately. A majority vote of the House is required to adopt any article.

(f) Upon adoption of one or more articles, the House shall appoint managers to prosecute the impeachment before the Senate.

### Section 4. Senate Trial Procedures

(a) The Senate shall have the sole power to try all impeachments. When sitting for that purpose, Senators shall be on oath or affirmation.

(b) When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside. When any other officer is tried, the Vice President shall preside, or if the Vice President has a conflict of interest, the President pro tempore.

(c) The presiding officer shall rule on all questions of evidence and procedure, subject to appeal to the full Senate by majority vote.

(d) Trial procedures shall include:

(1) opening statements by the House managers and counsel for the officer;

(2) presentation of evidence by the House managers;

(3) presentation of evidence by the officer;

(4) examination and cross-examination of witnesses;

(5) closing arguments;

(6) deliberation in closed session;

(7) public vote on each article.

(e) The Senate trial shall commence within thirty days of receiving articles from the House and shall proceed on consecutive days until concluded, absent extraordinary circumstances determined by two-thirds vote.

(f) Senators shall not engage in ex parte communications with the parties during trial and shall base their judgment solely on the evidence presented.

(g) No person shall be convicted without the concurrence of two-thirds of the Senators present.

(h) The Senate shall vote separately on removal and disqualification. Removal requires two-thirds vote; disqualification from future office requires majority vote after conviction.

### Section 5. Judgment and Consequences

(a) Judgment in cases of impeachment shall not extend further than removal from office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.

(b) A person convicted on impeachment shall be removed from office immediately upon the announcement of the verdict.

(c) A person convicted and disqualified may petition the Senate for removal of the disqualification after ten years. Restoration requires a two-thirds vote.

(d) The party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment, and punishment according to law.

(e) A pardon by the President shall not restore eligibility for office following disqualification by the Senate.

(f) Resignation after impeachment proceedings have commenced shall not bar continuation of the proceedings, including conviction and disqualification.

### Section 6. Expedited Procedures for Emergencies

(a) If the House determines by two-thirds vote that an officer poses an immediate threat to the constitutional order, national security, or public safety, it may invoke expedited procedures.

(b) Under expedited procedures:

(1) the committee investigation shall be completed within thirty days;

(2) House floor consideration shall occur within seven days of committee report;

(3) the Senate trial shall commence within seven days of receiving articles and shall be completed within twenty-one days.

(3) discipline short of removal for lesser misconduct.

(c) No judge shall be removed, suspended, or disciplined for the content of judicial opinions or decisions, unless the opinion constitutes an impeachable offense under Section 2.

### Section 8. Protection Against Abuse

(a) No officer may be impeached twice for the same conduct if acquitted by the Senate.

(b) Impeachment proceedings shall not be used to punish officers for lawful exercise of their constitutional duties.

(c) An officer who believes impeachment proceedings are pretextual or unconstitutional may seek expedited review in the Supreme Court, which shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over such claims.

(d) The Supreme Court may dismiss articles of impeachment that:

(1) fail to allege conduct that could constitute a high crime or misdemeanor under Section 2;

(2) violate the prohibition on double jeopardy under subsection (a);

(3) are demonstrably pretextual.

(e) Judicial review under this section is limited to the sufficiency of the charges, not the factual merits, which remain exclusively for the Senate.

### Section 9. Limitations on the Pardon Power

*Addresses Gap 223: The Pardon Loophole ("The Impunity Circle") and Gap 171: Impunity Pardon ("The Self-Cleanse"). Reforms the pardon power to prevent self-dealing, obstruction of justice, and abuse of clemency while preserving traditional mercy functions.*

(a) Definitions. For purposes of this Section:

(1) "Act of clemency" means any pardon, commutation of sentence, reprieve, remission of fine or forfeiture, or other exercise of executive clemency power, however denominated.

(2) "Named relationship" means a person who is the President's: spouse, domestic partner, parent, child (including adopted child and stepchild), sibling (including stepsibling), grandparent, grandchild, parent-in-law, child-in-law, or sibling-in-law.

(3) "Same administration" means having served simultaneously as officers or employees of the executive branch during any portion of the same presidential term, regardless of relative seniority.

(4) "Senior campaign role" means any compensated position, or any uncompensated position with authority over strategy, communications, finance, or operations, in a presidential campaign.

(b) Self-Clemency Prohibition. No President, Regional Governor, or State Governor may grant an act of clemency to themselves for any offense. This prohibition is absolute and may not be waived or circumvented.

(c) Impeachment-Related Clemency. The President may not grant an act of clemency for any offense:

(1) that is the subject of pending articles of impeachment against the President;

(2) that is cited as evidence in articles of impeachment against the President; or

(3) that forms part of the same course of conduct alleged in articles of impeachment against the President.

(d) Restricted Clemency Requiring Senate Approval. The President may not, without approval by two-thirds vote of the Senate, grant an act of clemency to:

(1) any person who is a named relationship of the President;

(2) any person who served in the President's presidential campaign in a senior campaign role;

(3) any person who served as a principal officer, head of executive department, or senior advisor in the President's administration; or

(4) any person with whom the President has had a significant financial or business relationship within the ten (10) years preceding the President's inauguration.

The Senate shall act on any request for clemency approval within sixty (60) calendar days of submission. Failure to act within sixty days shall constitute denial. The Senate's authority under this subsection is granted directly by this Article.

(e) Witness and Subject Clemency. When an act of clemency is granted to a person who, at the time of the grant or at any time during the preceding five (5) years:

(1) was a witness or potential witness in any proceeding involving the President;

(2) possessed evidence relevant to any investigation of the President; or

(3) was a subject or target of an investigation involving the President's conduct;

the act of clemency shall be presumed to have been granted with corrupt intent. The President may overcome this presumption only by demonstrating, by clear and convincing evidence before a federal court, that the clemency was granted for a legitimate purpose unrelated to the President's personal legal exposure.

(f) Same-Administration Clemency. The President may not, without approval by two-thirds vote of the Senate, grant an act of clemency to any person with whom the President served simultaneously as officers of the executive branch during any portion of the same presidential term, regardless of relative seniority. This includes but is not limited to a former President under whom the granting President served as Vice President. The Senate's authority under this subsection is granted directly by this Article.

(g) Timing Restrictions. During the final sixty (60) calendar days before the expiration of the President's term of office:

(1) all acts of clemency shall be submitted to Congress before taking effect;

(2) Congress may, by joint resolution adopted within thirty (30) days of submission, void any act of clemency;

(3) no act of clemency shall take effect during this period without submission under paragraph (1).

(h) Disclosure Requirements. All acts of clemency shall be accompanied by:

(1) public identification of the recipient;

(2) a statement of the offenses covered;

(3) a certification that no restricted relationship exists under subsections (d) or (f), or that the required Senate approval has been obtained; and

(4) filing with the official government publication system designated by law within seventy-two (72) hours.

No act of clemency shall be classified, sealed, or withheld from public disclosure. Secret acts of clemency are void.

(i) Retroactive Voidability. If articles of impeachment are adopted by the House of Representatives within two (2) years following the issuance of an act of clemency by the President, any such act of clemency covering offenses related to the conduct alleged in the articles of impeachment shall be voidable upon petition to a federal court. The court shall void the act of clemency unless the President demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the clemency was not granted to obstruct justice or shield participants in the alleged conduct.

(j) Enforcement.

(1) An act of clemency issued in violation of subsection (b), (c), or the submission requirement of subsection (g) shall be void ab initio.

(2) An act of clemency issued without required Senate approval under subsection (d) or (f) shall be void ab initio.

(3) An act of clemency subject to the presumption under subsection (e) shall be voidable upon judicial finding that the presumption has not been overcome.

(4) An act of clemency subject to subsection (i) shall be voidable within the two-year retroactive voidability window.

(5) An act of clemency that fails to comply with disclosure requirements under subsection (h) shall be voidable, and non-compliance shall constitute evidence of corrupt intent under subsection (e).

(6) Any person with standing may challenge an act of clemency in federal court. Standing includes: Congress by resolution of either chamber, any prosecutor with jurisdiction over covered offenses, and any victim of the covered offense.

(k) Conspiracy to Evade. Any agreement, express or implied, to grant or accept an act of clemency in exchange for silence, false testimony, refusal to cooperate with lawful investigations, or other obstruction of justice shall constitute a separate criminal offense. This offense:

(1) is not subject to any act of clemency by any executive at any level of government;

(2) may be prosecuted by any federal, Regional, or State authority with jurisdiction; and

(3) shall be punishable as provided by law, with a minimum penalty established by Congress.

(l) Traditional Clemency Preserved. Nothing in this Section shall limit:

(1) acts of clemency for persons with no relationship to the President described in subsections (d) or (f);

(2) acts of clemency granted for purposes of justice reform, humanitarian relief, or national reconciliation, provided they comply with disclosure requirements under subsection (h); or

(3) the exercise of clemency power by officials other than the President, except as provided in subsection (b).

(m) Implementing Legislation. Congress shall enact legislation providing:

(1) procedures for Senate review of clemency requests under subsections (d) and (f);

(2) standards for determining "significant financial or business relationship" under subsection (d)(4);

(3) procedures for congressional review of lame-duck clemency under subsection (g); and

(4) penalties for conspiracy to evade under subsection (k).

## Implementation Notes

This amendment requires implementing legislation including:

- House Impeachment Procedures Act (committee rules, witness procedures, timeline enforcement)
- Senate Trial Rules (evidence standards, presiding officer duties)
- Judicial Discipline Act (procedures for suspension and incapacity under Section 7)
- Pardon Power Limitations Act (Senate clemency review procedures, financial relationship standards, conspiracy-to-evade penalties, lame-duck review procedures)

## Relationship to RF Core

If the Regional Federal Constitution is adopted:

- Article VIII applies to federal officers as specified
- Regional officers are subject to Regional impeachment procedures under Regional constitutions
- No RF Supplement is required; impeachment applies uniformly to federal government
- Section 9(b) self-clemency prohibition applies to Regional Governors in addition to the President

If adopted standalone:

- Article VIII replaces current impeachment provisions in Articles I and II
- Applies to all federal officers subject to current impeachment provisions
- Section 9(b) self-clemency prohibition applies to State Governors in addition to the President
- Section 9 comprehensively reforms the presidential pardon power regardless of whether Regions exist

## Design Rationale

### Why Enumerate Grounds?

- Current Constitution's "high crimes and misdemeanors" is undefined
- Enumeration provides guidance without being exclusive
- Clarifies that criminal conduct is not required
- Establishes principled standard: breach of public trust

### Why Timeline Requirements?

- Prevents indefinite investigations as political weapons
- Ensures prompt resolution of questions about officer fitness
- Expedited procedures available for genuine emergencies
- Balances speed with due process

### Why Allow Judicial Review?

- Prevents purely pretextual impeachments
- Review limited to sufficiency of charges, not merits
- Senate remains sole judge of facts and ultimate decision
- Protects against use of impeachment to punish lawful conduct

### Why Continue After Resignation?

- Resignation should not be an escape from accountability
- Disqualification from future office serves public interest
- Prevents strategic resignation to preserve future eligibility
- Historical precedent supports continuation

### Why Cover All Acts of Clemency?

- If only "pardons" were restricted, Presidents could commute sentences to achieve the same corrupt purpose
- Commutation to time served releases co-conspirator identically to a pardon
- "Act of clemency" defined to include all forms: pardons, commutations, reprieves, remissions
- Traditional clemency preserved under subsection (l) for legitimate uses

### Why Named Relationships Rather Than Degrees of Consanguinity?

- "Third degree of consanguinity or affinity" is a legal term most citizens cannot evaluate
- Named list (spouse, parent, child, sibling, etc.) is unambiguous and self-enforcing
- Prevents gaming through relationship-degree disputes
- Inclusionary approach covers domestic partners, step-relations, and in-laws

### Why Rebuttable Presumption for Witness Clemency?

- Automatic prohibition would create false positives for legitimate clemency involving witnesses
- "Corrupt intent" standard (original proposal) is practically unenforceable — Presidents always claim legitimate reasons
- Rebuttable presumption shifts burden to the President: must prove legitimate purpose by clear and convincing evidence
- Creates effective deterrent through legal uncertainty for corrupt actors

### Why Same-Administration Language for Successor Pardons?

- The Ford-Nixon sequence (VP becomes President, pardons former President) is a specific historical vulnerability
- Banning all successor pardons would be too broad (legitimate clemency decades later)
- "Same administration" captures the specific corrupt bargain without affecting unrelated administrations
- Applies regardless of seniority direction: VP pardoning former President or President pardoning former VP

### Why Retroactive Voidability for Pre-Impeachment Pardons?

- Without this provision, a President could pardon all co-conspirators before articles of impeachment are filed
- Section 9(c) only triggers on "pending" articles — creating a race-to-pardon incentive
- Retroactive voidability means pre-emptive pardons are conditionally valid: they evaporate if impeachment follows within two years
- Changes calculus for co-conspirators: the pardon may not protect them, reducing the obstruction incentive
