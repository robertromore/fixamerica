# Core Idea: A New Layer of Government - Regional Federalism

## A Comprehensive Design Document

> **Purpose of this document:**
> To define, justify, and operationalize a new constitutional level of government ("Regions") between states and the federal government-without yet committing to the full amendment package. This is the "core idea" in isolation: what it is, why it exists, and how it should function.

## 1. Executive Overview

**Regional federalism** adds a formal level of government-**Regions**-between states and the federal government. Regions are groups of states with real democratic legitimacy and meaningful governing authority.

The system exists to solve a modern mismatch:

- **States** are often too small to manage cross-border realities (labor markets, housing demand, transportation networks, energy grids, water systems).
- The **federal government** is often too blunt and politically overloaded to govern diverse local outcomes.
- The result is **nationalization of everything**, where every presidential election feels existential and courts are pressured to become policy engines.

Regions are designed as an intermediate scale where:

- policy can be tailored to shared conditions,
- coordination happens at the scale that actually matches real life,
- national politics becomes less totalizing,
- and democratic conflict becomes more survivable.

---

## 2. What "Regional Federalism" Means

### A plain definition

A **Region** is:

- a constitutionally recognized government,
- composed of multiple states,
- democratically accountable to the people living within it,
- empowered to govern issues that are **too large for states** but **too diverse for the nation**.

### A functional definition

Regions govern **spillovers**-problems where what one state does strongly affects neighbors:

- transportation corridors and commuting sheds
- electric reliability and grid interconnects
- shared river basins / watersheds
- air quality and climate adaptation
- regional housing supply pressures
- cross-border labor markets and credential mobility
- public health coordination (pandemics, hospital capacity, procurement)

### A structural definition

Regions are not "bigger states." They are **coordination governments**:

- built to reduce fragmentation,
- reduce national overreach,
- and provide a legitimate middle level of public decision-making.

---

## 3. Why Add a Regional Layer

Regional federalism is a response to three persistent failures in the current U.S. structure.

### 3.1 Scale mismatch: modern systems don't align with state borders

Most of the real "units" of American life are already regional:

- metropolitan economies cross state lines
- freight, supply chains, and ports connect multi-state systems
- energy is regional by physics and infrastructure
- water and air are regional by nature
- labor and credentialing markets are regional by mobility

When governance is stuck at state scale, you get:

- duplication,
- coordination failures,
- underinvestment,
- and competition that looks like "policy arbitrage."

### 3.2 Nationalization overload: everything becomes a federal fight

When states can't coordinate and federal action is the only path, politics becomes a zero-sum national contest:

- every policy dispute becomes a Supreme Court dispute
- every federal election becomes existential
- legitimacy collapses when the losing side feels permanently ruled

Regions provide a third place for disagreement:

- *less fragmented than 50 states*
- *less totalizing than one national government*

### 3.3 Internal fragmentation: the hidden cost of "50 laboratories"

The "laboratories of democracy" story is partly true-but at modern scale it also creates:

- incompatible standards
- licensing barriers
- supply chain friction
- race-to-the-bottom incentives
- difficulty responding to multi-state crises

Regions preserve experimentation while reducing chaos.

---

## 4. What Regions Are (and Are Not)

### Regions are

- **democratic** (elected leadership or elected legislature)
- **governing** (not advisory commissions)
- **fiscal** (real revenue authority)
- **coordinating** (designed for cross-border spillovers)
- **constitutionally bounded** (enumerated powers; cannot become a new federal layer)

### Regions are not

- a cultural partition ("red regions vs blue regions")
- a step toward secession
- a replacement for states
- a new bureaucracy without legitimacy
- a vehicle for uniformity for its own sake

### Regions are especially not

- a tool to "win politics" permanently

A regional system must remain legitimate even when the "other side" governs a region.

---

## 5. Defining Regions: Criteria and Constraints

### 5.1 Criteria for region design (what makes a good region)

A good region is:

1. **Economically coherent**
    - shared labor markets
    - freight corridors and ports
    - complementary industries

2. **Infrastructure-coherent**
    - linked transportation systems
    - energy generation/transmission realities
    - water supply dependencies

3. **Ecologically coherent**
    - watersheds, coastlines, drought patterns
    - air sheds, wildfire risk regions

4. **Population balanced enough for legitimacy**
    - no region is *so large* it feels like a mini-nation
    - no region is *so small* it becomes a "super-state veto"

5. **Administratively plausible**
    - can build institutions without total reinvention
    - can harmonize standards without micromanaging local governance

### 5.2 Constraints (what the system must prevent)

1. **No unilateral exit**
2. **No internal tariffs / trade barriers**
3. **No permanent emergency centralization**
4. **No "special regions" with unique constitutional obligations**
5. **No single city dominating without internal checks** (design issue)

### 5.3 How many regions?

There's no perfect number. The design tension is:

- **Fewer regions** - stronger coordination, but higher stakes
- **More regions** - more local fit, but increased fragmentation

A plausible range is **6-10**. Many designs converge around **7** because it:

- reduces 50-unit fragmentation
- avoids "two nations" polarization
- creates institutions that feel large but not alien

### 5.4 Formation and Revision

This document defines criteria for *what makes a good region*, but does not specify the process for creating or revising boundaries. The constitutional design addresses formation and revision through:

- an Independent Boundary Review Commission,
- periodic review following each decennial census,
- supermajority consent of affected regions plus national referendum,
- election blackout periods to prevent manipulation.

See [The Regional Federal Constitution](../02-design/constitution/00-index.md), Article I, Section 4 for the complete boundary revision mechanism.

## 6. Sketching Plausible U.S. Regions

Below are **example** region groupings. These are not "the" answer; they are testable sketches.

> **Note on non-state entities:** The example maps include DC for geographic completeness, but the constitutional definition of regions is "a grouping of States." DC, territories, and tribal nations are handled separately in [Article XX (Non-State Entities)](../02-design/constitution/00-index.md) of the constitutional design, which specifies representation, regional assignment procedures, and sovereignty preservation.

### Option A: 7 Regions (coarse, strong coordination)

| Region | States (example) | Why it coheres (high level) |
|--------|------------------|----------------------------|
| Pacific | WA, OR, CA, HI, AK | coastline logistics, ports, energy, wildfire, trade |
| Mountain/Interior West | ID, MT, WY, NV, UT, CO, NM, AZ | water scarcity, federal land, grid/water coordination |
| Plains | ND, SD, NE, KS, OK, TX | agriculture, energy, freight corridors |
| Midwest/Great Lakes | MN, WI, IL, IN, MI, OH, IA, MO | manufacturing, Great Lakes systems, river commerce |
| South | AR, LA, MS, AL, TN, KY, GA, SC, NC, FL | coastal resilience, logistics, public health coordination |
| Mid-Atlantic | VA, WV, MD, DE, PA, NJ, DC | dense corridors, commuting sheds, ports |
| Northeast/New England | NY, CT, RI, MA, VT, NH, ME | dense metro regions, infrastructure interdependence |

**Trade-off:** strong coordination, but regions can become powerful; internal subregional representation becomes important.

---

### Option B: 9 Regions (more granular, lower stakes)

Break up the South and/or Interior West to reduce "mega-region" dominance.

Example:

- Split South into "Deep South" and "Southeast/Atlantic"
- Split Interior West into "Mountain" and "Desert Southwest"

**Trade-off:** better fit, but more boundaries and coordination overhead.

---

### Option C: Functional Regions (overlay model)

> **Design note:** This option was explored as a conceptual alternative but is **not adopted** in the constitutional design. The constitution establishes fixed geographic regions (Options A/B) rather than functional overlays. This section is retained for analytical completeness.

Rather than one fixed set of regions, you define "region maps" for:

- energy governance
- water governance
- transportation governance
- public health governance

And allow regional institutions to overlap.

**Trade-off:** extremely realistic, but politically harder to explain and constitutionalize. See [The Regional Federal Constitution](../02-design/constitution/00-index.md), Article I for the adopted approach.

---

## 7. Core Competencies of Regions

This is the core of the idea: **what regions do that neither states nor federal government can do well**.

### 7.1 Coordination policy (the heart of the model)

Regions should handle problems that:

- spill across state borders,
- require harmonization of standards,
- and benefit from consistent planning.

Examples:

- interstate rail and freight priorities
- multi-state zoning/housing compacts
- regional grid modernization and reliability rules
- shared wildfire response
- epidemic response coordination and procurement
- credential reciprocity with safety add-ons

### 7.2 Infrastructure and long-horizon planning

Regions can plan at the scale that states cannot:

- 20-50 year infrastructure plans
- corridor-based investment (not state-by-state patchwork)
- resilience planning for climate and severe weather patterns

### 7.3 Labor market alignment (without internal globalization)

Regions are the right scale to:

- set wage floors tied to local conditions
- coordinate unemployment systems
- manage training and credential recognition
- prevent "race to bottom" within an integrated national market

### 7.4 Regional public health governance

Public health is inherently regional:

- hospital networks
- supply logistics
- disease spread patterns
- emergency coordination

Regions can centralize *coordination* without nationalizing all healthcare.

---

## 8. How Regions Relate to Federal and State Governments

### 8.1 Federal role in a regional system

The federal government remains essential for:

- defense and foreign policy
- currency and national finance
- immigration and citizenship
- constitutional rights enforcement
- national minimum standards (not uniform ceilings)
- national benefits floor (portability and dignity)

Federal government should be:

- **strong where uniformity is necessary**
- **limited where diversity is legitimate**

### 8.2 State role in a regional system

States remain crucial for:

- local criminal law and policing structures (within rights floors)
- education policy (within constitutional floors)
- civil law, property law
- local governance and municipalities
- culturally specific policy experimentation

States become:

- less isolated
- less forced to reinvent infrastructure alone
- less pressured to "fight the nation" for legitimacy

### 8.3 Regions as the "coordination spine"

Regions reduce the need for:

- federal micromanagement
- 50-state duplication
- interstate compacts negotiated ad hoc

---

## 9. The Legitimacy Thesis: Why This Reduces National Stakes

A democracy becomes unstable when:

- losing nationally means losing everywhere,
- and the winner can impose uniform policy on a deeply pluralistic society.

Regions reduce that pressure because:

- many contentious policy domains become regional,
- national elections decide fewer life-defining policies,
- and losers retain real self-government.

This is the core legitimacy gain:

> **The political system becomes less "winner-take-all."**

---

## 10. The Stability Thesis: Why This Reduces Secession Risk

Secession sentiment rises when:

- people believe there is no lawful path to live differently,
- and that the national government is permanently hostile.

A regional system reduces this by:

- providing lawful autonomy at meaningful scale,
- keeping a single market and national rights floors,
- and explicitly banning exit (no secession),
- while ensuring autonomy is real enough that exit feels unnecessary.

The model is **autonomy without exit**.

---

## 11. The Practical Thesis: Why This Improves Governance

Regional governance improves outcomes in places where current systems predictably fail:

### 11.1 Better coordination, fewer duplications

- shared agencies for procurement
- shared standards for licensing and professional mobility
- shared infrastructure planning

### 11.2 Reduced policy whiplash

National policy swings harder than regional policy.

Regions produce:

- more stable compromises
- less re-litigation every election

### 11.3 Better crisis response

Crises are often regional in reality:

- hurricanes
- wildfires
- public health emergencies
- grid failures

Regions coordinate the response at the right scale.

---

## 12. Common Objections and Design Responses

### Objection A: "This creates another bureaucracy."

**Response:**
Yes, but it can reduce total bureaucracy by:

- consolidating duplicate state functions into one regional function
- removing the need for sprawling federal implementation agencies in regional matters

Key design point: regions must **replace**, not merely add, certain state-level duplications.

### Objection B: "Regions become mini-nations and increase secession risk."

**Response:**
Risk is real if regions are identity containers with exit ambiguity.

The design must:

- prohibit secession,
- prohibit nullification,
- preserve a single market,
- preserve national benefits floor,
- and keep national democratic floors enforceable.

### Objection C: "Regions will be dominated by big metros."

**Response:**
This is a real risk. Options:

- regional bicameralism
- mixed electoral systems (some proportional, some territorial)
- internal minority protections
- strong local governance autonomy

### Objection D: "This makes governance more complex."

**Response:**
Complexity already exists; it's just informal.

Regionalization formalizes coordination, sets clear lines, and reduces ad hoc patchwork.

### Objection E: "It'll never pass politically."

**Response:**
This is a political feasibility question, but the core design can be introduced incrementally:

- pilot regional institutions
- compact-style regional coordination
- then constitutionalization after proof of value

## 13. Minimal Viable Version vs Full Version

### Minimal viable version (MV-RF)

If you wanted the smallest change that still matters:

- recognize regions constitutionally
- give them limited coordination powers (infrastructure, grid, public health)
- keep Senate and elections mostly unchanged initially
- build legitimacy gradually

Even the minimal version requires explicit **transfer and de-duplication** of specified cross-border functions (e.g., grid reliability standards, regional housing compacts, public health procurement) from states to regions. Regions must replace, not merely add to, state-level duplication. See the [Allocation Framework Act](../05-implementation/03-allocation-framework-act.md) for the operational specification of which functions transfer and the de-duplication timetable.

### Full version (FV-RF)

The full system (as we later drafted) includes:

- regional Senate representation
- revised amendment process
- hardened common market
- labor/benefits portability architecture
- fiscal adequacy and no unfunded mandates
- enforcement/construction article
- armed forces restructuring

This document focuses on the **core idea**, but MV vs FV matters for rollout.

---

## 14. Transition Strategy (Conceptual)

A functional transition has three phases:

### Phase 1: Institutional preformation

- create regional agencies (transport, grid, public health)
- coordinate with existing state agencies
- begin shared procurement and standards

### Phase 2: Authority transfer

- constitutionally recognize regions
- transfer enumerated cross-border powers
- establish regional revenue mechanisms

### Phase 3: Constitutional hardening

- embed amendment process, enforcement rules, judiciary constraints
- finalize Senate/election reforms if included in the full package

Principle:

> Avoid "big bang" transitions that create uncertainty and panic.

---

## 15. Design Guardrails and Non-Negotiables

Any legitimate regional system needs:

1. **A single national common market** (no internal tariffs)
2. **A national rights floor** (democracy and civil liberties)
3. **A national benefits floor** (mobility without precarity)
4. **No secession and no nullification**
5. **Independent fiscal authority at each level**
6. **Clear assignment of powers** (no silent creep)
7. **Mechanisms to prevent internal dumping** (labor and subsidies)
8. **Internal regional democracy safeguards** (metro domination check)

---

## 16. Summary: What This Layer Solves

### Solves directly

- cross-border coordination failures
- nationalization overload
- existential elections (by reducing national scope)
- ad hoc interstate patchwork
- fragile crisis coordination

### Mitigates substantially

- secession risk (by making autonomy real)
- authoritarian consolidation (by fragmenting power)
- court-as-legislature pressure (by restoring regional lawmaking space)

### Does not magically solve

- bad faith actors
- disinformation
- cultural conflict itself

But it changes the system so those forces are less likely to become nationally fatal.

---

## Closing Thesis

Regional federalism is not a utopian constitution.

It is a design for a pluralistic democracy that assumes:

- persistent disagreement,
- periodic crisis,
- and imperfect actors.

It aims to ensure that:

> **disagreement does not become collapse**,
> and **crisis does not become permanent authoritarianism**.

That is the core idea.
