# Design Axioms of Regional Federalism

## The Ten Rules That Govern the Entire System

> **Purpose of this document:**
> To reduce the full constitutional framework to a small set of **axioms**—non-negotiable design rules from which all institutional choices follow.
>
> If you understand these ten rules, you understand the system.

These are not slogans.
They are **constraints**.

---

## Axiom 1 — Assume Bad Faith

Design every institution as if:

- officials will exploit ambiguity,
- courts may evade,
- executives will overreach,
- legislatures may sabotage.

> **If the system only works when everyone behaves well, it will fail when it matters.**

---

## Axiom 2 — Distribute Power Relentlessly

No office, branch, or level may:

- control elections,
- control money,
- control law interpretation,
- control enforcement,
- control armed force.

> **Single-point control is single-point failure.**

---

## Axiom 3 — Match Authority to Scale

Assign powers to the smallest unit capable of:

- exercising them effectively,
- bearing their consequences,
- maintaining legitimacy.

> **Overscaled authority produces backlash; underscaled authority produces failure.**

---

## Axiom 4 — Floors, Not Ceilings

National standards establish:

- minimum rights,
- baseline protections,
- shared dignity.

They do **not** freeze policy or eliminate variation.

> **Uniformity where necessary; pluralism everywhere else.**

---

## Axiom 5 — Make Losses Survivable

No election, policy, or court ruling should:

- permanently erase self-government,
- govern everyone identically,
- make defeat existential.

> **Democracy fails when losing means annihilation.**

---

## Axiom 6 — Prefer Restoration Over Punishment

Enforcement exists to:

- restore lawful process,
- re-enable self-government,
- then withdraw.

Not to:

- humiliate,
- dominate,
- or permanently centralize power.

> **Compliance matters more than victory.**

---

## Axiom 7 — Law Must Move Faster Than Power

Constitutional law must:

- act automatically,
- include deadlines,
- self-execute when blocked.

> **Delay is a form of domination.**

---

## Axiom 8 — Fragment Coercion

No civilian authority may:

- unilaterally deploy armed force domestically,
- control all enforcement mechanisms,
- bypass multi-actor authorization.

> **The sword must never belong to one hand.**

---

### Design Note: Reconciling Axioms 7 and 8

Axiom 7 (self-executing law) and Axiom 8 (fragmented coercion) appear in tension: how can law "act automatically" while enforcement remains multi-actor? The constitutional design resolves this by distinguishing two enforcement modes:

1. **Automatic/default enforcement** (Axiom 7): Certification deadlines, default rules upon inaction, and automatic transfers operate without coercion. If Congress fails to act, defaults take effect. If officials fail to certify, certification is automatic. No physical force is required—the law simply moves forward.

2. **Coercive enforcement** (Axiom 8): When physical force is required (domestic deployment, asset seizure, arrest of officials), multiple actors must authorize. The two-key authorization model requires both the President and a supermajority of Regional Governors before armed forces may act domestically.

Self-execution handles procedural compliance; fragmented coercion handles physical enforcement. Neither axiom is compromised.

See [Armed Forces and Civilian Control](../02-design/06-armed-forces.md) and [Judiciary and Constitutional Enforcement](../02-design/07-judiciary.md) for implementation details.

## Axiom 9 — Adaptation Is Safer Than Rigidity

A constitution that cannot change:

- invites informal power grabs,
- shifts authority to courts and executives,
- loses legitimacy.

> **Hard to amend, harder to break.**

---

## Axiom 10 — Legitimacy Is the Limiting Resource

Design institutions to preserve:

- predictability,
- fairness of process,
- visible reversibility,
- lawful voice.

> **Power endures only as long as legitimacy does.**

---

## The System in One Sentence

> **Regional federalism is a constitutional system designed to survive prolonged disagreement by making power difficult to concentrate, losses survivable, law automatic, and restoration inevitable.**

Everything else is implementation.
