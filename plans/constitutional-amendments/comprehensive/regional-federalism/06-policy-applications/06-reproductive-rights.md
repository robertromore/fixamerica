# Reproductive Rights Under Regional Federalism

## How Regional Government Transforms Reproductive Rights Governance

> **Purpose of this document:**
> To describe how the Regional Federal constitutional system would structure reproductive rights governance, establishing a federal floor for rights protection while enabling regional variation above that floor.

Post-*Dobbs*, reproductive rights represent maximum policy variation across states. Regional Federalism addresses this by establishing federal rights floors while defining clear rules for cross-regional issues including travel, telemedicine, and provider liability.

## 1. Current Post-*Dobbs* Structure

After *Dobbs v. Jackson* (2022), reproductive rights are entirely state-determined:

- **Federal**: No constitutional protection; FDA regulates medication abortion
- **State**: Complete authority over legality, restrictions, exceptions
- **Result**: Patchwork from total bans to explicit protections

Current conflicts:

- Interstate travel for abortion services
- Telemedicine prescription across state lines
- Provider liability for out-of-state patients
- Data privacy for location and health information
- Federal facilities and programs in restrictive states

---

## 2. Problems Regional Federalism Addresses

### Legal Uncertainty

- Providers face unclear liability exposure
- Patients uncertain of their rights
- Constant litigation over state laws
- No stable framework for healthcare planning

### Cross-Border Conflicts

- States attempting to restrict travel
- Prosecution threats across state lines
- Telemedicine creating jurisdictional conflicts
- No mechanism for interstate coordination

### Healthcare System Disruption

- Medical training affected by state bans
- Emergency care complicated by legal uncertainty
- Provider recruitment challenges
- Insurance and coverage fragmentation

---

## 3. Reproductive Rights Under Regional Federalism

### Federal Authority (Establishing Floor)

Federal government establishes constitutional floor:

- **Travel protection**: Cannot restrict interstate/interregional travel for healthcare
- **Due process**: Any restriction must provide due process
- **Life and health exceptions**: Medical emergencies must be addressable
- **Federal facilities**: Federal programs and facilities operate under federal law
- **FDA authority**: Medication approval and regulation remains federal
- **Privacy protection**: Health information privacy protected

### Regional Authority (Above Floor)

Regions control policy above federal floor:

- Legality and gestational limits
- Provider regulations and licensing
- Facility requirements
- Funding decisions (state Medicaid)
- Parental involvement requirements
- Waiting periods and counseling requirements

### Constitutional Architecture

[Article III, Section 2](../02-design/constitution/02-powers-and-rights.md) establishes:

- Bodily autonomy as protected interest (interpreted through floor legislation)
- Due process for any restrictions affecting fundamental interests
- Equal protection in application of restrictions

---

## 4. Federal Rights Floor Options

### Option A: Minimal Floor (Travel and Emergency Only)

Federal floor protects only:

- Right to travel for healthcare (cannot be restricted)
- Emergency medical treatment (EMTALA-style protection)
- Federal facilities operate under federal law
- No substantive right to abortion services

**Effect**: Maximum regional variation; some regions may prohibit abortion entirely except emergencies

### Option B: Life/Health Floor

Federal floor establishes:

- Right to abortion when pregnancy threatens life or health
- Health defined to include serious physical conditions
- Rape and incest exceptions required
- Travel fully protected
- Telemedicine from legal regions protected

**Effect**: All regions must permit abortion in limited circumstances; variation above floor

### Option C: Viability Floor

Federal floor establishes:

- Right to abortion before viability (approximately 24 weeks)
- Regions may regulate but not prohibit before viability
- After viability, regions may restrict except for life/health
- Travel protected
- Telemedicine protected

**Effect**: Similar to pre-*Dobbs* framework; regions can regulate but not ban before viability

### Choosing Among Options

Each option represents a different balance:

- **Option A**: Maximum regional autonomy, minimum federal intervention
- **Option B**: Addresses medical emergencies while preserving regional variation
- **Option C**: Closest to pre-*Dobbs* framework with constitutional grounding

The choice among these options involves fundamental value judgments that Regional Federalism does not predetermine. Constitutional architects may select different floors based on how they weigh autonomy, federalism, and rights protection.

## 5. Regional Policy Variation

### Restrictive Region Example

Region prohibits abortion except floor requirements:

- Permitted only for life/health, rape, incest (federal floor)
- No elective abortion permitted
- No public funding
- Provider regulations for permitted procedures
- Mandatory counseling and waiting periods for permitted cases

### Moderate Region Example

Region permits abortion with regulations:

- Permitted through 15-20 weeks
- Parental notification (not consent) for minors
- 24-48 hour waiting period
- State Medicaid funding prohibited
- Informed consent requirements

### Permissive Region Example

Region protects abortion access:

- Permitted through viability
- After viability for health reasons
- State Medicaid funding
- Provider protections from other regions' laws
- No waiting period
- Telehealth fully permitted

### Protective Region Example

Region maximizes access:

- Permitted through viability, after for health
- State funding for all
- Shield laws protecting providers
- Out-of-region patient protections
- Training requirements for providers
- Insurance coverage mandates

## 6. Cross-Regional Issues

### Travel Rights

[Article I, Section 8](../02-design/constitution/01-regional-structure.md) guarantees freedom of movement:

- No region may restrict travel for healthcare
- No region may penalize travel to another region
- No region may prosecute conduct occurring entirely in another region
- Travel protection is constitutional, not merely statutory

### Telemedicine

Cross-regional telemedicine rules:

- Provider licensed in origin region providing service to patient in that region: Permitted
- Provider in Region A prescribing to patient physically in Region B: Subject to Region B law
- Medication shipped from Region A to patient in Region B: Subject to Region B law
- Patient traveling to Region A for telemedicine consultation: Region A law applies

### Provider Liability Protection

**Shield Law Framework**:

- Regions may enact shield laws protecting providers from other regions' laws
- Shield laws prevent enforcement of other regions' judgments
- No region can compel another region to extradite for lawful conduct
- Federal law may establish provider protection floor

### Prosecution Limits

[Article I, Section 6](../02-design/constitution/01-regional-structure.md) limits extraterritorial prosecution:

- Regions cannot prosecute conduct occurring entirely in another region
- "Effects" jurisdiction limited to actual conduct in prosecuting region
- Federal law prohibits prosecution for travel

---

## 7. Healthcare System Integration

### Provider Regulation

- Regions license providers within their borders
- Providers follow law of region where service occurs
- Interstate licensing compacts may facilitate multi-region practice
- Training programs follow region law

### Hospital Operations

- Hospitals follow law of their physical region
- Emergency exceptions apply everywhere (federal floor)
- Religious institution exemptions remain regional
- Conscience protections defined regionally

### Insurance Coverage

- Regional authority over state-regulated insurance
- Employer plans (ERISA) follow federal law
- Exchange plans follow region rules
- Medicaid follows federal floor plus regional choices

### Medical Training

- OB-GYN training programs adapt to regional law
- Regions may fund training for full procedure scope
- Cross-regional training arrangements possible
- Board certification remains national

---

## 8. Federal Programs and Facilities

### Federal Facilities

Federal facilities operate under federal law:

- Military hospitals: Federal law applies
- VA facilities: Federal law applies
- Indian Health Service: Federal law with tribal consultation
- Federal prisons: Federal law applies

### Federal Funding

- Title X: Federal family planning program continues
- Medicaid: Federal floor plus regional options
- Hyde Amendment: Congressional decision on federal abortion funding
- Research funding: Federal authority

### Federal Employees

- Federal employee health insurance: Federal policy
- Posted to restrictive regions: Access through federal facilities or travel

---

## 9. Enforcement and Liability

### Criminal Enforcement

- Regional authorities enforce regional law
- Federal authorities enforce federal floor
- No prosecution for conduct in another region
- Travel itself is never criminal

### Civil Liability

- Civil suits follow defendant's region law
- No enforcement of judgments for lawful out-of-region conduct
- Shield laws protect providers from other regions' civil suits
- Data protection prevents enforcement through records

### Data Privacy

Federal data protection requirements:

- Location data protected
- Health records protected
- No compelled disclosure to other regions
- Search warrant requirements for health data

---

## 10. Implementation Considerations

### Political Feasibility

Reproductive rights deeply divisive:

- Including floor may cause some to oppose entire Regional Federalism package
- Excluding floor may cause others to oppose
- Option B (Life/Health Floor) may be acceptable compromise
- Could be addressed separately from core Regional Federalism amendments

### Constitutional Questions

- Does Congress have authority to establish abortion rights floor?
- Commerce Clause? Section 5 of Fourteenth Amendment?
- May require explicit constitutional amendment for certainty
- Regional Federal Constitution could include in Article III

### Transition

During transition:

- Current state laws remain effective initially
- Federal floor phases in upon ratification
- Regional consolidation of policies
- Provider guidance during transition

### Equalization

Fiscal equalization ensures:

- All regions can fund reproductive healthcare to extent they choose
- No coercion through funding conditions
- Services available consistent with regional policy

---

## Summary

Regional Federalism addresses reproductive rights by:

1. **Establishing federal floor**: Life/health exceptions, travel protection, due process
2. **Enabling regional variation**: Regions set policy above floor
3. **Protecting travel**: Constitutional protection for interstate healthcare travel
4. **Clarifying cross-regional rules**: Telemedicine, provider liability, prosecution limits
5. **Addressing federal role**: Federal facilities, funding, data protection

> **Federal floor for emergencies and travel protection.**
> **Regional authority for policy above floor.**
> **Clear rules for cross-regional conflicts.**
> **Provider and patient protections defined.**
