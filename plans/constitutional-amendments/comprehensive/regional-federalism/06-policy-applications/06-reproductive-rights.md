# Reproductive Rights Under Regional Federalism

## Status: Outline Only

This document outlines how reproductive rights policy would function under Regional Federalism. Full analysis to be developed.

---

## The Challenge

Post-*Dobbs*, reproductive rights are maximally contested:

- No federal constitutional protection for abortion
- State laws range from total bans to explicit protections
- Interstate travel and telemedicine create conflicts
- Prosecution threats cross state lines
- Healthcare providers face legal uncertainty
- No stable framework - constant litigation and legislation

## Regional Federalism Approach

### Federal Authority (potential)

- Interstate travel rights (cannot be restricted)
- Federal facilities and programs
- Research and drug approval (FDA)
- Constitutional floor (if established by amendment)

### Regional Authority

- Legality and restrictions within region
- Gestational limits
- Provider regulations
- Funding decisions
- Parental involvement requirements

### Rights Floors (critical design question)

**Option A: No federal floor**
- Regions decide entirely
- Maximum variation
- Some regions ban, others protect

**Option B: Minimal federal floor**
- Life/health of mother exceptions required
- No prosecution for travel
- Due process for any restrictions

**Option C: Substantive federal floor**
- Constitutional right to abortion up to viability
- Regions can exceed but not restrict below floor
- Similar to pre-*Dobbs* framework

## Key Questions to Research

### Constitutional Architecture

- Should Regional Federalism include reproductive rights floor?
- What level of protection, if any?
- How does this interact with regional variation goals?
- Is this issue appropriate for regional variation at all?

### Interstate Issues

- Can regions restrict travel for abortion?
- How do telemedicine prescriptions work across regions?
- Can Region A prosecute providers in Region B?
- What's the "effects" jurisdiction question?

### Healthcare System

- How do hospitals and providers navigate regional variation?
- What happens to medical training?
- How do emergency exceptions work?
- What's the liability framework?

### Political Strategy

- Does including reproductive rights in Regional Federalism help or hurt adoption?
- Would pro-choice and pro-life advocates accept regional variation?
- Is this issue too charged for structural reform to address?

## Scenarios to Analyze

1. **Southeast Region bans abortion** - What's the federal floor? Travel rights?
2. **Pacific Region protects through viability** - Can it shield providers from other regions' laws?
3. **Telemedicine prescription** - Provider in California, patient in Texas
4. **Emergency exception** - How does it work when regional laws differ?
5. **Federal facilities** - Military bases, VA hospitals in restrictive regions

## Comparative Models to Study

- **Germany**: Federal framework with Länder implementation
- **Canada**: No federal law, provincial variation
- **Mexico**: Recent federalization of abortion rights
- **EU**: Member state variation with travel rights

## Warning

This issue may be:

- Too divisive to include in Regional Federalism package
- A reason some would oppose the entire framework
- Better addressed separately from structural reform

Research whether reproductive rights should be:
1. Included with a floor
2. Included without a floor (full regional variation)
3. Excluded entirely from Regional Federalism framework
