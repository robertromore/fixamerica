# Housing Policy Under Regional Federalism

## How Regional Government Transforms Housing Governance

> **Purpose of this document:**
> To describe how the Regional Federal constitutional system would restructure housing governance, addressing the housing crisis through regional coordination while preserving local implementation authority.

Housing illustrates the case for regional governance: metropolitan housing markets cross state lines, exclusionary zoning externalizes costs to neighbors, and current fragmentation prevents coordinated solutions.

## 1. Current Federal-State-Local Housing Structure

The current system fragments housing authority across levels:

- **Federal**: Fair housing enforcement, mortgage regulation, tax incentives (MID), HUD programs
- **State**: Landlord-tenant law, building codes, housing finance agencies
- **Local**: Zoning, land use, permitting, local housing authorities

This fragmentation creates:

- No authority at the metropolitan scale where housing markets actually operate
- Exclusionary zoning that externalizes housing costs to neighboring jurisdictions
- Exclusionary zoning incentives (each locality may benefit by shifting housing costs elsewhere)
- Federal programs disconnected from local land use decisions
- States unable to override local zoning without political backlash

---

## 2. Problems Regional Federalism Addresses

### Scale Mismatch

Localities are too small for:

- Coordinating housing supply across metropolitan labor markets
- Preventing cost-shifting through exclusionary zoning
- Building regional transit-oriented development
- Addressing homelessness that moves across municipal boundaries

States are often too small for:

- Metropolitan areas that cross state lines (NYC, DC, Chicago, Philadelphia, Kansas City)
- Coordinating housing policy with regional economic development
- Matching housing supply to regional job growth

The nation is too large for:

- Uniform zoning standards that fit Manhattan and rural Wyoming
- Responsive adaptation to regional housing markets
- Democratic accountability for housing decisions

### The Externality Problem

Current structure enables:

- Wealthy suburbs excluding affordable housing
- Costs pushed to central cities and older suburbs
- Regional housing shortages despite local "success"
- Infrastructure costs externalized to neighbors

### Political Dysfunction

National housing reform faces:

- Local governments as veto players
- NIMBY politics at every level
- Inability to coordinate metropolitan solutions
- Federal programs that fund housing but cannot ensure it gets built

---

## 3. Housing Powers Under Regional Federalism

This section applies the allocation framework established in [Article II](../02-design/constitution/02-powers-and-rights.md) and operationalized by the [Allocation Framework Act](../05-implementation/03-allocation-framework-act.md).

### Federal Powers (Enumerated)

Federal authority limited to ([Article II](../02-design/constitution/02-powers-and-rights.md)):

- **Rights floors**: Fair housing, non-discrimination ([Article III](../02-design/constitution/00-index.md))
- **Mortgage regulation**: Financial system stability
- **Tax policy**: Mortgage interest deduction, LIHTC
- **Federal lands**: Housing on federal property
- **National housing data**: Collection and publication

### Regional Powers (Exclusive)

Regions would control ([Article I](../02-design/constitution/00-index.md)):

- **Housing supply coordination**: Regional targets and anti-exclusion standards
- **Metropolitan planning**: Coordinating housing with transportation and employment
- **Regional fair share**: Allocating affordable housing obligations across jurisdictions
- **Anti-exclusionary zoning standards**: Minimum density requirements, by-right development
- **Regional housing finance**: Coordinating state housing finance agencies
- **Homelessness coordination**: Regional approach to shelter and services

### State Powers (Retained)

States retain:

- Landlord-tenant law
- Building codes (within regional minimums)
- State housing finance agencies (coordinated regionally)
- Condominium and HOA regulation

### Local Powers (Retained)

Local governments retain:

- Zoning implementation within regional frameworks
- Design review and architectural standards
- Permitting and inspection
- Local housing authority operations
- Neighborhood planning within regional guidelines

---

## 4. The Spillover Problem in Housing

### Why Housing Triggers Regional Authority

The [Allocation Framework Act](../05-implementation/03-allocation-framework-act.md) classifies housing as **Category B — Coordination Required** because housing exceeds spillover thresholds:

| Spillover Metric | Housing Market Reality |
|------------------|------------------------|
| **Population affected** | >15% of affected population outside acting jurisdiction — commuters, displaced residents |
| **Economic impact** | >$100M annual external impact — housing costs affect regional labor markets |
| **Geographic scope** | Effects extend >50 miles — metropolitan housing markets span multiple jurisdictions |
| **Infrastructure dependency** | >25% of system users from other jurisdictions — transit, roads, utilities |

### The Exclusionary Zoning Externality

When a locality restricts housing:

1. Housing costs rise regionally (not just locally)
2. Workers commute longer distances
3. Poorer residents concentrate in permissive jurisdictions
4. Infrastructure costs shift to neighbors
5. Regional economic growth is constrained

This is a textbook spillover: **decisions made by voters in one jurisdiction impose costs on non-voters in neighboring jurisdictions**.

### Why States Cannot Solve This

State preemption of local zoning faces:

- Intense local opposition (voters control state legislators)
- Political asymmetry (NIMBYs are organized, future residents are not)
- Cross-state metros (state action cannot reach across state lines)

Regional authority solves all three problems.

## 5. Regional Housing Supply Coordination

### Regional Housing Needs Assessment

Each Region shall conduct housing needs assessments:

- Current housing stock by type and affordability level
- Projected population and employment growth
- Housing production needed to meet demand
- Distribution of need across subregions and localities

### Regional Housing Targets

Based on needs assessment, Regions establish:

- **Overall production targets**: Total units needed regionally
- **Affordability targets**: Units at each income level
- **Geographic distribution**: Fair share allocation across localities
- **Timeline**: Phased production schedule

### Local Obligation

Each locality receives:

- **Fair share allocation**: Number of units at each affordability level
- **Zoning capacity requirement**: Must zone for allocated units
- **By-right development threshold**: Projects meeting standards approved ministerially
- **Progress reporting**: Annual reports to Regional housing authority

### Enforcement

If a locality fails to meet obligations:

- Regional housing authority may approve projects directly
- State housing finance agency funding conditioned on compliance
- Regional infrastructure funding tied to housing performance
- Builder's remedy: developers may build to regional standards if local zoning inadequate

---

## 6. Regional Zoning Approaches

Regions have authority to set zoning policy above federal floors. Different regions may choose different approaches based on their housing markets, preferences, and conditions.

### Regional Policy Options

**Option A: Local Control (Minimal Regional Intervention)**

Region defers most zoning decisions to localities:

- Local governments retain primary zoning authority
- Regional role limited to data collection and voluntary coordination
- No regional density mandates or fair share requirements
- Market forces determine housing supply and location

**Option B: Coordination (Moderate Regional Role)**

Region coordinates without mandating specific outcomes:

- Regional housing needs assessment
- Voluntary fair share frameworks
- Technical assistance to localities
- Incentive funding for localities meeting regional goals
- No builder's remedy or regional override

**Option C: Active Intervention (Stronger Regional Role)**

Region sets standards to address spillover effects:

- Regional anti-exclusion standards (see below)
- Fair share requirements for affordable housing
- Builder's remedy for non-compliant localities
- Regional override of exclusionary practices

### Regional Anti-Exclusion Standards (Option C)

Regions choosing active intervention may establish standards:

**Density Minimums:**

- Near transit stations: minimum 50 units/acre
- Near major employment centers: minimum 30 units/acre
- Residential zones generally: minimum 15 units/acre
- Localities may exceed minimums

**By-Right Development:**

- Projects meeting regional standards approved ministerially
- No discretionary review for compliant projects
- Design review limited to objective standards
- Timeline limits on permit processing

**Regional Zoning Standards:**

Regions establish zoning parameters reflecting regional housing needs and preferences:

| Parameter | High-Demand Regions | Moderate-Demand Regions | Regional Discretion |
|-----------|---------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Transit proximity for multi-family | 0.25-0.5 miles | 0.5-1.0 miles | Region sets threshold |
| Maximum lot size minimums | 2,500-5,000 sq ft | 5,000-10,000 sq ft | Region sets cap |
| Maximum parking requirements | 0-1 space/unit | 1-2 spaces/unit | Region sets ceiling |

**Under Option C, regions may prohibit:**

- Discretionary review for projects meeting objective regional standards

### Local Flexibility Within Framework

Localities retain:

- Authority to exceed regional minimums
- Design standards (objective, not discretionary)
- Historic preservation (limited geographic scope)
- Environmental review where required by state/federal law

---

## 7. Affordable Housing Production

### Regional Affordable Housing Fund

Each Region shall establish a Regional Affordable Housing Fund:

**Revenue Sources:**

- Regional housing levy (property or sales tax component)
- Federal LIHTC and HOME allocations
- State housing trust fund contributions
- Inclusionary zoning in-lieu fees
- Commercial linkage fees

**Eligible Uses:**

- Gap financing for affordable development
- Operating subsidies for deeply affordable units
- Acquisition of naturally occurring affordable housing
- Preservation of expiring affordability covenants

### Inclusionary Requirements

Regions may establish inclusionary requirements:

- Percentage of units affordable in new developments
- Income targeting (30%, 50%, 80%, 120% AMI)
- In-lieu fee alternative
- Density bonuses for exceeding minimums

### Public Housing Coordination

Regional coordination of public housing authorities:

- Unified waiting lists
- Portability within region
- Coordinated capital planning
- Regional approach to RAD conversions

---

## 8. Fair Housing and Federal Rights Floors

### Federal Fair Housing Floor

Federal rights floors ([Article III](../02-design/constitution/00-index.md)) include:

- Prohibition on discrimination (race, color, religion, sex, national origin, familial status, disability)
- Affirmatively furthering fair housing obligation
- Reasonable accommodation requirements
- Accessibility standards for new construction

### Regional Fair Housing Enhancement

Regions may exceed federal floors:

- Additional protected classes (source of income, veteran status, etc.)
- Stronger enforcement mechanisms
- Regional fair housing planning
- Anti-displacement protections

### Addressing Segregation

Regional authority enables:

- Fair share distribution of affordable housing
- Integration of high-opportunity areas
- Coordinated mobility programs
- Regional approach to school integration

---

## 9. Homelessness Response

### Current Dysfunction

Homelessness policy fails because:

- Homeless individuals cross municipal boundaries
- Each locality tries to push problem elsewhere
- Fragmented funding streams
- No regional coordination of shelter and services

### Regional Homelessness Authority

Each Region shall establish coordinated homelessness response:

**Functions:**

- Regional homeless count and needs assessment
- Coordinated entry system (regional, not local)
- Regional shelter capacity (distributed across localities)
- Housing First programs at regional scale
- Outreach and services coordination

**Fair Share Obligations:**

- Each locality contributes to regional response
- Shelter beds and services distributed regionally
- No locality can exclude homeless services entirely
- Funding based on fiscal capacity, not homeless population

**Permanent Supportive Housing:**

- Regional development and siting
- Localities cannot exclude PSH developments
- Integrated with regional affordable housing strategy

---

## 10. Implementation Considerations

### Transition

Housing transition under regional federalism would require:

- Establishment of Regional Housing Authorities
- Regional housing needs assessments (Year 1)
- Regional anti-exclusion standards adopted (Year 2)
- Local fair share allocations assigned (Year 2)
- Full implementation with enforcement (Year 3+)

### Equalization

Fiscal equalization ([Article X, Section 3](../02-design/constitution/04-fiscal-system.md)), operationalized by the [Fiscal Equalization Act](../05-implementation/04-fiscal-equalization-act.md), ensures:

- Lower-capacity regions can fund housing programs
- Affordable housing subsidies available everywhere
- Regional coordination on housing standards
- National solidarity maintained

### Political Economy

Regional federalism changes housing politics:

- **Diffuses NIMBY power**: Local NIMBYs cannot block regional decisions
- **Creates regional accountability**: Elected regional officials answer for housing outcomes
- **Enables cross-subsidy**: Wealthy areas contribute to regional affordability
- **Matches markets**: Authority aligns with housing market geography

### Variation and Experimentation

Regional federalism enables:

- Different regions trying different approaches
- Learning from regional experiments
- Adaptation to regional preferences (urban vs. suburban focus)
- Innovation without national permission

### Federal Floors Prevent

- Discrimination in housing
- Elimination of affordable housing entirely
- Exclusion of protected classes
- Local nullification of civil rights

---

## Summary

Regional federalism transforms housing governance by:

1. **Matching scale to market**: Regional authority covers metropolitan housing markets
2. **Solving the externality problem**: Exclusionary zoning costs are internalized regionally
3. **Enabling coordination**: Housing, transportation, and employment planning aligned
4. **Maintaining accountability**: Elected regional officials answer for housing outcomes
5. **Preserving local implementation**: Design and permitting remain local within regional framework

Housing under regional federalism represents the system's approach applied to a domain where current fragmentation manifestly fails:

> **Federal floors for fair housing and civil rights.
> Regional authority for supply coordination and anti-exclusion.
> Local implementation within regional frameworks.
> Democratic accountability at the metropolitan scale.**
