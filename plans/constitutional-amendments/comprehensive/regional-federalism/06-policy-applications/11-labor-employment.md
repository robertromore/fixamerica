# Labor and Employment Under Regional Federalism

## Status: Outline Only

This document outlines how labor and employment policy would function under Regional Federalism. Full analysis to be developed.

---

## The Challenge

Labor policy varies dramatically and inconsistently:

- Federal minimum wage hasn't kept pace
- State minimum wages range from federal floor to $15+
- Right-to-work laws create patchwork
- Gig economy classification uncertain
- Worker protections vary by state
- No mechanism for regional labor market coordination

## Regional Federalism Approach

### Federal Authority (retained)

- National minimum floor (wage, safety, discrimination)
- NLRA framework for collective bargaining
- OSHA minimum safety standards
- Anti-discrimination enforcement
- Immigration employment verification

### Regional Authority (new)

- Regional minimum wage above federal floor
- Regional labor standards above federal floor
- Right-to-work or union security rules
- Gig economy classification
- Paid leave requirements
- Regional workforce development

### Rights Floors

- Federal minimum wage (floor, not ceiling)
- Workplace safety minimums
- Anti-discrimination protections
- Right to organize (federal NLRA)

## Key Questions to Research

### Minimum Wage

- How does regional minimum wage work?
- Can regions set different minimums for different sectors?
- What's the relationship to cost of living?
- How do regional minimums interact at borders?

### Collective Bargaining

- Can regions be "right-to-work" or not?
- How does this affect union organizing regionally?
- What's the federal floor for union rights?
- Can regions exceed federal collective bargaining protections?

### Gig Economy

- Can regions classify gig workers differently?
- How does this work for apps operating nationally?
- What enforcement exists regionally?

### Paid Leave

- Can regions mandate paid family/medical leave?
- How does leave portability work across regions?
- What's the relationship to federal FMLA?

### Workforce Development

- How do regions coordinate workforce with education?
- What's the regional role in apprenticeships?
- How do credentials transfer across regions?

## Comparative Models to Study

- **Germany**: Strong federal labor standards with works councils
- **Canada**: Provincial variation in minimum wage and labor law
- **Australia**: Federal minimum with state variation
- **EU**: Directive minimums with member state variation

---

## Scenarios to Analyze

1. **Regional minimum wage** - Northeast Region sets $20 minimum
2. **Right-to-work** - Great Plains Region maintains, Midwest Region repeals
3. **Gig classification** - Pacific Region classifies drivers as employees
4. **Paid leave** - Southeast Region no mandate, Pacific 12 weeks paid
5. **Union organizing** - Regional variation in card check or election rules

## Economic Considerations

### Race to Bottom Risk

- Will businesses relocate to low-standard regions?
- How significant is this effect?
- What mechanisms prevent destructive competition?

### Regional Labor Markets

- Do regions map to actual labor markets?
- How does regional variation interact with labor mobility?
- What prevents "regulatory arbitrage"?
