# Labor and Employment Policy Under Regional Federalism

## How Regional Government Transforms Labor Governance

> **Purpose of this document:**
> To describe how the Regional Federal constitutional system would restructure labor and employment governance, enabling regional variation above federal floors while preventing destructive competition.

Labor policy exemplifies the tension between uniformity and variation. Regional Federalism provides federal floors establishing baseline protections while enabling regional adaptation to different labor markets and preferences.

## 1. Current Federal-State Labor Structure

The current system divides labor authority inconsistently:

- **Federal**: FLSA (minimum wage, overtime), NLRA (unions), OSHA (safety), anti-discrimination
- **State**: Minimum wage above federal, right-to-work laws, additional protections
- **Local**: Some cities set own minimum wages, benefits requirements

This fragmentation creates:

- Federal minimum wage stuck at $7.25 while states range to $15+
- Right-to-work laws in some states, union security in others
- Gig economy classification varying by state
- Worker protections varying dramatically
- No mechanism for regional labor market coordination

---

## 2. Problems Regional Federalism Addresses

### Scale Mismatch

States are too small for:

- Coordinating policy across actual labor markets
- Coordinating standards among neighboring states
- Addressing employers who operate regionally
- Consistent enforcement across metropolitan areas

The nation is too large for:

- One minimum wage fitting Manhattan and rural Mississippi
- Uniform rules for vastly different labor markets
- Federal solutions to regionally varying conditions

### Competitive Pressure on Standards

Current structure enables:

- States cutting protections to attract business
- Right-to-work spreading as competitive response
- Enforcement weakening to reduce business costs

---

## 3. Labor Powers Under Regional Federalism

### Federal Powers (Enumerated)

Federal authority sets floors:

- **Minimum wage floor**: National minimum that no Region may undercut
- **NLRA framework**: Right to organize, collective bargaining structure
- **OSHA minimums**: Workplace safety floors
- **Anti-discrimination**: Title VII, ADA, ADEA protections
- **Overtime and hours**: FLSA framework

### Regional Powers (Primary Above Floors)

Regions would control:

- **Regional minimum wage**: Set above federal floor based on regional costs
- **Union security rules**: Right-to-work or not (regional decision)
- **Additional protections**: Paid leave, scheduling, predictability
- **Gig economy classification**: Regional standards for worker status
- **Regional enforcement**: Labor standards enforcement

### State/Local Powers

States and localities retain:

- Enforcement of regional standards
- Local supplements where permitted
- State-specific programs within regional framework

---

## 4. Minimum Wage and Compensation

### Federal Floor

National minimum wage establishes absolute floor:

- No Region may pay less than federal minimum
- Federal minimum indexed to inflation
- Consistent national baseline

### Regional Minimum Wage

Regions set minimums above federal floor reflecting:

- Regional cost of living
- Regional labor market conditions
- Regional democratic preferences

**Examples**:

- **Northeast Region**: $18/hour reflecting high cost of living
- **Great Plains Region**: $12/hour reflecting lower costs
- **Pacific Region**: $20/hour reflecting higher labor cost standards

### Border Effects

Regional rather than state-by-state minimums reduce border arbitrage:

- Businesses cannot easily relocate across regional borders
- Consistent standards within regional labor markets

---

## 5. Collective Bargaining

### Federal Framework (NLRA)

National framework preserved:

- Right to organize remains federal
- Collective bargaining structure maintained
- NLRB jurisdiction continues

### Regional Authority: Union Security

Regions decide on union security arrangements:

- **Option A**: Union security allowed (agency fees permissible)
- **Option B**: Right-to-work (no mandatory fees)

This replaces state-by-state right-to-work with regional decision.

---

## 6. Worker Classification and Gig Economy

### Regional Standards

Regions would establish classification tests:

- **Option A**: Strict classification (ABC test, employee presumption)
- **Option B**: Flexible classification (traditional test)
- **Option C**: Third category for gig workers with portable benefits

Platform companies follow regional rules in each region.

---

## 7. Workplace Safety and Conditions

### Federal OSHA Floor

National safety minimums continue with regional authority to exceed.

### Regional Enhancement

Regions may exceed OSHA floors with stricter standards for regional industries.

---

## 8. Paid Leave and Benefits

### Regional Paid Leave Programs

Regions establish paid leave:

- **Paid family/medical leave**: Regional programs with duration/replacement rates set regionally
- **Paid sick leave**: Regional minimum requirements

Benefits portability within region ensures worker mobility.

---

## 9. Workforce Development

Regional coordination with education system:

- Training aligned with regional employers
- Credential portability within region
- Apprenticeship coordination

See [Education Policy](09-education.md) for details.

---

## 10. Implementation Considerations

### Equalization

Fiscal equalization ([Article X, Section 3](../02-design/constitution/04-fiscal-system.md)) ensures lower-income Regions can fund enforcement.

### Federal Floors Prevent

- Wages below national minimum
- Unsafe workplaces below OSHA standards
- Discrimination in employment
- Standards falling below federal floors

---

## Summary

Regional Federalism transforms labor governance by:

1. **Establishing federal floors**: National minimums ensure baseline protections
2. **Enabling regional variation**: Regions set standards above floors
3. **Establishing coordination**: Regional scale enables coordinated standards above floors
4. **Addressing gig economy**: Regional classification standards provide clarity

> **Federal floors for minimum standards.
> Regional authority for standards above floors.
> Variation reflecting regional labor markets.**
