# Drug Policy Under Regional Federalism

## Status: Outline Only

This document outlines how drug policy would function under Regional Federalism. Full analysis to be developed.

---

## The Challenge

Drug policy under current federalism creates chaos:

- Federal prohibition conflicts with state legalization
- Interstate commerce in legal states creates federal crimes
- Banking and financial services blocked for legal businesses
- Enforcement varies dramatically by jurisdiction
- No clear framework for regulatory commerce across state lines
- Criminal justice disparities based on geography

## Regional Federalism Approach

### Federal Authority (retained)

- International drug trafficking
- Import/export controls
- Interstate trafficking of federally prohibited substances
- National scheduling framework (with regional variation allowed)

### Regional Authority (new)

- Legalization/decriminalization within region
- Intra-regional commerce regulation
- Licensing and taxation
- Public health approach vs enforcement approach
- Treatment and harm reduction programs

### Rights Floors

- No mandatory minimums for simple possession
- Treatment availability requirements
- Non-discrimination in enforcement
- Record expungement pathways

## Key Questions to Research

### Legalization Mechanics

- Can a region fully legalize what remains federally prohibited?
- How does "regional legalization" interact with federal commerce clause?
- What's the constitutional architecture for regional scheduling authority?

### Interstate Commerce

- How do legal products move between regions with different laws?
- Can Region A's legal cannabis be sold in Region B where it's illegal?
- How do border controls between regions work for legal/illegal substances?

### Banking and Finance

- Can regional banks serve legal drug businesses?
- How does federal banking regulation interact with regional legalization?
- What financial infrastructure is needed?

### Criminal Justice Transition

- How are existing convictions handled when regions change policy?
- What's the federal/regional split on drug crime prosecution?
- How do sentences vary across regions for same conduct?

### Public Health

- How do treatment programs vary regionally?
- What's the federal floor for addiction services?
- How do harm reduction approaches vary?

## Comparative Models to Study

- **Portugal**: National decriminalization with treatment focus
- **Netherlands**: Tolerance policy with regulated sales
- **Uruguay**: National legalization framework
- **Canada**: Federal legalization with provincial variation
- **Switzerland**: Harm reduction pioneering (safe injection sites)

## Scenarios to Analyze

1. **Pacific Region legalizes all drugs** - How does this interact with federal law and neighboring regions?
2. **Southeast Region maintains prohibition** - What border enforcement exists?
3. **Cross-regional trafficking** - Who prosecutes, under what law?
4. **Medical vs recreational** - Can regions have different frameworks?
