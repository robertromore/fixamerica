# Education Under Regional Federalism

## Status: Outline Only

This document outlines how education policy would function under Regional Federalism. Full analysis to be developed.

---

## The Challenge

Education governance is fragmented and contested:

- Local control tradition but massive inequality
- State standards vary dramatically
- Federal role contested and inconsistent
- No mechanism for regional coordination
- Higher education costs spiraling
- Workforce development disconnected from labor markets

## Regional Federalism Approach

### Federal Authority (limited)

- Civil rights enforcement in education
- Research funding (NSF, NIH)
- National student loan programs
- Basic accessibility standards
- National data collection

### Regional Authority (new)

- K-12 standards coordination
- Regional university systems
- Workforce development alignment
- Teacher certification reciprocity
- Regional school funding equalization
- Career and technical education

### State Authority (retained)

- K-12 curriculum (within regional frameworks)
- State universities
- Teacher employment
- School district governance

### Local Authority (retained)

- School operations
- Local hiring
- Implementation

## Key Questions to Research

### K-12 Education

- Should there be regional standards or remain state-by-state?
- How does regional funding equalization work?
- What's the federal floor for educational quality?
- How do charter schools and choice programs work regionally?

### Higher Education

- Could regions create coordinated university systems?
- How would tuition and financial aid work regionally?
- What's the role of community colleges in regional workforce?
- How do flagship universities relate to regional systems?

### Workforce Development

- How do regions align education with labor market needs?
- What's the regional role in apprenticeships and CTE?
- How do credentials transfer across regions?

### Funding

- How does regional equalization work for school funding?
- What's the federal floor for per-pupil spending?
- How do property tax systems interact with regional equalization?

## Comparative Models to Study

- **Germany**: Länder education authority with coordination
- **Canada**: Provincial education systems
- **Australia**: State education with federal funding
- **Switzerland**: Cantonal education with intercantonal coordination

## Scenarios to Analyze

1. **Regional standards** - Northeast Region adopts common standards across states
2. **University system** - Midwest Region creates integrated public university system
3. **Funding equalization** - Rich states subsidize poor states within region
4. **School choice** - How do voucher programs work regionally?
5. **Teacher mobility** - Certification recognized across region automatically

## Key Design Questions

### Centralization vs Local Control

- How much regional coordination vs state/local autonomy?
- What's the right level for different decisions?
- How do you prevent regional bureaucracy?

### Equity

- Can regional equalization address intra-state inequality?
- What's the federal floor for educational opportunity?
- How do rural and urban schools fare regionally?

### Innovation

- Does regional coordination stifle experimentation?
- How do you preserve "laboratories of democracy"?
- What's the right balance?
