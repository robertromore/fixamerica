# Education Policy Under Regional Federalism

## How Regional Government Transforms Education Governance

> **Purpose of this document:**
> To describe how the Regional Federal constitutional system would restructure education governance, demonstrating subsidiarity in action while maintaining funding floors and credential portability.

Education exemplifies subsidiarity: curriculum decisions are typically made locally, while funding disparities and credential fragmentation require higher-level coordination. Regional Federalism addresses both dimensions.

## 1. Current Federal-State Education Structure

The current system divides education authority inconsistently:

- **Federal**: Title I funding, IDEA (special education), civil rights enforcement, research
- **State**: Standards, testing, teacher certification, funding formulas
- **Local**: Day-to-day operations, curriculum selection, hiring
- **Higher education**: State systems, federal financial aid, accreditation

This fragmentation creates:

- Massive funding disparities between states and districts
- Non-portable credentials (teaching licenses, professional certifications)
- Fragmented workforce development
- Inconsistent quality standards
- Political battles over curriculum at state level

---

## 2. Problems Regional Federalism Addresses

### Scale Mismatch

States are too small for:

- Credential portability across labor markets
- Coordinated workforce development
- Higher education systems serving regional economies
- Addressing brain drain to neighboring states

The nation is too large for:

- Uniform curriculum fitting Maine and Texas
- Centralized decisions on local school matters
- One-size-fits-all accountability systems
- Responsive adaptation to regional economic needs

### Funding Disparities

Current structure produces:

- Per-pupil spending varying 3:1 across states
- Property tax reliance creating intra-state disparities
- Poor states unable to fund adequate education
- Teacher quality following funding (wealthy districts attract talent)

### Credential Fragmentation

Current problems:

- Teachers licensed in one state cannot easily move
- Professional credentials not recognized across lines
- College credits don't transfer cleanly
- Workforce certifications vary state to state

## 3. Education Powers Under Regional Federalism

This section applies the allocation framework established in [Article II](../02-design/constitution/02-powers-and-rights.md) and subsidiarity principles from [Article III](../02-design/constitution/02-powers-and-rights.md).

### Federal Powers (Enumerated)

Federal authority limited to:

- **Funding floors**: Minimum per-pupil spending nationwide ([Article III](../02-design/constitution/02-powers-and-rights.md))
- **Civil rights enforcement**: Non-discrimination, IDEA protections
- **Financial aid**: Pell grants, student loans
- **Research**: Education research funding (IES)
- **Veterans education benefits**: GI Bill administration

### Regional Powers (Coordination)

Regions would control:

- **Credential portability**: Regional teaching licenses, professional certifications
- **Higher education coordination**: Regional university systems, tuition reciprocity
- **Workforce development**: Alignment with regional labor markets
- **Quality assurance**: Regional accreditation standards
- **Funding coordination**: Regional equalization above federal floor

### State Powers (Primary - Subsidiarity)

States retain primary authority over:

- **Curriculum standards**: What is taught
- **Testing and assessment**: How learning is measured
- **Teacher preparation**: Program requirements
- **School organization**: District structure, charter authorization
- **Local funding**: Above regional and federal floors

### Local Powers (Operational)

Localities retain:

- Day-to-day school operations
- Hiring decisions (meeting state certification)
- Curriculum implementation
- School culture and programs
- Community engagement

---

## 4. K-12 Education Systems

### Subsidiarity in Practice

**Federal level**: Funding floor, civil rights, research

**Regional level**: Credential portability, quality benchmarks, equalization

**State level**: Curriculum, standards, assessment, teacher certification

**Local level**: Operations, implementation, community responsiveness

### Curriculum Authority

Under subsidiarity, curriculum decisions remain with states and localities:

- States set content standards
- Local districts select materials
- No federal or regional curriculum mandates
- Cultural and community values reflected locally

### Teacher Certification

Regional approach enables mobility:

- **Regional teaching license**: Valid across all states in region
- **State-specific requirements**: States may add (not subtract) requirements
- **Reciprocity agreements**: Inter-regional recognition
- **Portability database**: Regional tracking of credentials

### Assessment and Accountability

- States determine assessment systems
- Regional coordination on comparability (optional)
- No federal testing mandates
- Local accountability to community

---

## 5. Higher Education

### Regional University Systems

Regions could coordinate higher education:

- **Regional flagship coordination**: Complementary rather than duplicative programs
- **Tuition reciprocity**: In-state rates across region for residents
- **Credit transfer**: Guaranteed articulation within region
- **Research coordination**: Regional centers of excellence

### Community Colleges

Regional approach enables:

- Coordinated workforce programs
- Regional transfer pathways
- Industry partnerships across state lines
- Shared online programs

### Student Financial Aid

- Federal Pell grants continue
- Regional supplement programs possible
- State programs continue
- Coordination prevents gaps

### Research Universities

- Regional coordination on research priorities
- Shared facilities and equipment
- Coordinated graduate programs
- Industry partnership alignment

---

## 6. Workforce Development and Credentialing

### Regional Labor Market Alignment

Regions match workforce development to actual labor markets:

- Metropolitan areas span state lines
- Regional economic development coordination
- Employer engagement at regional scale
- Skills gap analysis region-wide

### Credential Portability

Under [Article I, Section 9](../02-design/constitution/01-regional-structure.md) (Professional Licensing):

- **Regional occupational licenses**: Valid across region
- **Certification recognition**: Industry credentials honored regionally
- **Apprenticeship coordination**: Regional standards and programs
- **Continuing education**: Regional requirements

The [Interstate Professional Licensing Act](../proposals/interstate-professional-licensing-act.md) implements credential portability with:

- Fee limits
- Supplementary requirement restrictions
- Streamlined verification

### Career Pathways

Regional coordination enables:

- Stackable credentials across institutions
- Career pathway maps for regional industries
- Employer-education partnerships
- Work-based learning coordination

---

## 7. Early Childhood Education

### Regional Coordination Opportunities

Early childhood spans current fragmentation:

- **Head Start**: Federal program
- **State pre-K**: Varies dramatically
- **Child care**: Market-based with subsidies
- **Early intervention**: IDEA Part C (federal floor)

### Regional Approach

Regions could coordinate:

- Quality standards across early childhood settings
- Workforce development (early childhood educators)
- Funding coordination
- Transition to K-12

### Federal Floor

- Head Start funding continues
- IDEA early intervention floor
- Child care subsidy floor
- Non-discrimination protections

---

## 8. Special Populations

### Students with Disabilities

IDEA federal floor continues with regional coordination:

- Federal rights floor (FAPE, LRE)
- Regional service coordination
- State implementation
- Local service delivery

### English Language Learners

- Federal civil rights floor (Lau v. Nichols)
- Regional coordination on assessment
- State program design
- Local implementation

### Gifted Education

- No federal mandate (optional)
- Regional coordination possible
- State programs vary
- Local implementation

### Career and Technical Education

- Federal Perkins funding continues

## 9. Funding and Equity

### Current Disparities

Education funding varies dramatically:

- **Interstate**: $8,000 to $25,000+ per pupil
- **Intrastate**: Wealthy districts outspend poor districts 2:1+
- **Property tax reliance**: Creates local wealth dependence
- **State capacity**: Poor states cannot fund adequately

### Regional Federalism Solution

**Federal floor**: Minimum per-pupil spending nationwide

**Regional equalization**: Brings all states in region to adequate funding

**State formulas**: Address intra-state disparities

**Local supplements**: Above floors, reflecting local priorities

### Equalization Mechanism

Fiscal equalization ([Article X, Section 3](../02-design/constitution/04-fiscal-system.md)) ensures:

- All Regions can fund adequate K-12 education
- Lower-income Regions receive support
- Regional coordination on education spending
- National commitment to educational opportunity

### Adequacy vs. Equity

Regional Federalism enables both:

- **Adequacy**: Federal floor ensures minimum everywhere
- **Equity**: Regional equalization reduces variation
- **Local control**: Supplements reflect community priorities
- **Accountability**: Democratic accountability at each level

---

## 10. Implementation Considerations

### Transition

Education transition under Regional Federalism would require:

- Phased development of regional credential systems
- Gradual higher education coordination
- Maintenance of existing state/local authority
- Federal floor establishment
- Workforce development alignment

### Key Protections Preserved

- Local curriculum control
- State standards authority
- IDEA protections
- Civil rights enforcement
- Teacher collective bargaining (where established)

### Variation and Experimentation

Regional Federalism enables:

- Different states trying different curriculum approaches
- Regional innovation in higher education delivery
- Workforce development experimentation
- Local responsiveness to community values

### Federal Floors Prevent

- Funding below adequate levels
- Discrimination in education access
- Denial of services to students with disabilities
- Segregation or exclusion

### Quality Assurance

Regional structures can improve quality through:

- Credential portability creating mobility
- Regional benchmarking (voluntary)
- Higher education coordination
- Workforce outcome tracking

## Summary

Regional Federalism transforms education governance by:

1. **Demonstrating subsidiarity**: Curriculum stays local, funding coordinates regionally, civil rights federal
2. **Enabling credential portability**: Regional licenses and certifications honor labor market realities
3. **Addressing funding disparities**: Federal floors plus regional equalization ensure adequacy
4. **Coordinating higher education**: Regional university systems reduce duplication, improve access
5. **Aligning workforce development**: Regional approach matches actual labor markets

Education under Regional Federalism represents the system's approach applied to a critical policy domain:

> **Federal floors for funding and civil rights.
> Regional coordination for credentials and higher education.
> State and local authority for curriculum and operations.
> Subsidiarity honored at each level.**
