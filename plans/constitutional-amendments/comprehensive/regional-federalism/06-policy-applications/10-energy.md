# Energy Policy Under Regional Federalism

## Status: Outline Only

This document outlines how energy policy would function under Regional Federalism. Full analysis to be developed.

---

## The Challenge

Energy policy is fragmented and contested:

- Federal-state jurisdictional confusion
- Interstate transmission blocked by state interests
- No mechanism for regional grid coordination
- Renewable integration hampered by balkanization
- Nuclear policy uncertain
- Fossil fuel transition uncoordinated

## Regional Federalism Approach

### Federal Authority (retained)

- Nuclear regulation (NRC)
- Interstate pipelines
- Federal hydropower
- Energy research (DOE)
- Strategic petroleum reserve
- International energy trade

### Regional Authority (new)

- Regional grid planning and operation
- Regional renewable portfolio standards
- Regional transmission siting
- Electricity market design
- Generation mix planning
- Energy efficiency standards

### State Authority

- Retail electricity regulation (within regional framework)
- Building codes
- Local siting decisions

## Key Questions to Research

### Grid Operations

- How do regional transmission organizations (RTOs) map to regions?
- What's the regional authority over grid planning?
- How do regions coordinate on reliability?
- Who decides on new transmission lines?

### Renewable Integration

- Can regions set different renewable mandates?
- How does intermittent generation work across regions?
- What's the regional role in storage deployment?
- How do renewable credits work across regions?

### Fossil Fuel Transition

- How do fossil fuel producing regions manage transition?
- What's the federal role in just transition?
- How do stranded assets get addressed?
- What happens to coal communities?

### Nuclear

- What's the federal vs regional role in nuclear?
- Can regions prohibit nuclear within their borders?
- How does nuclear waste work regionally?

### Markets

- How do wholesale electricity markets work regionally?
- What's the regional role in market design?
- How do retail markets interact with regional wholesale?

## Comparative Models to Study

- **Germany**: Energiewende with Länder implementation
- **EU**: Member state energy mix with EU-wide targets
- **Australia**: National electricity market with state variation
- **Canada**: Provincial energy authority with interprovincial coordination

---

## Scenarios to Analyze

1. **Regional renewable mandate** - Pacific Region requires 100% clean electricity
2. **Transmission siting** - New line crosses multiple states within region
3. **Coal transition** - Great Plains Region coal plants close
4. **Nuclear expansion** - Southeast Region expands nuclear fleet
5. **Grid emergency** - How do regions coordinate during blackouts?

## Relationship to Climate Policy

Energy is central to climate policy:

- Electricity generation is major emissions source
- Regional energy choices affect regional climate policy
- Coordination needed for economy-wide decarbonization
- Regional variation in energy may undermine climate goals
