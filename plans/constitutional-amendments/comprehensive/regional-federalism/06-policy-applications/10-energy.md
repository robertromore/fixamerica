# Energy Policy Under Regional Federalism

## How Regional Government Transforms Energy Governance

> **Purpose of this document:**
> To describe how the Regional Federal constitutional system would restructure energy governance, enabling regional grid coordination and clean energy transition while maintaining federal authority over nuclear, interstate infrastructure, and national security.

Energy policy exemplifies where current state boundaries create coordination challenges: grids cross state lines, transmission projects require multi-state approval, and renewable integration is complicated by jurisdictional fragmentation. Regional Federalism matches governance to actual energy systems.

## 1. Current Federal-State Energy Structure

The current system fragments energy authority:

- **Federal**: Nuclear (NRC), interstate pipelines (FERC), wholesale electricity markets (FERC), hydropower, research (DOE)
- **State**: Retail electricity, utility regulation, renewable portfolio standards, siting
- **Regional**: Voluntary RTOs/ISOs with limited authority
- **Local**: Building codes, some siting

This fragmentation creates:

- Transmission lines blocked by state-by-state approval
- Renewable energy stranded by grid constraints
- Inconsistent clean energy standards
- No mechanism for regional grid planning
- Reliability coordination challenges

---

## 2. Problems Regional Federalism Addresses

### Scale Mismatch

States are too small for:

- Grid planning (electrical grids don't follow state lines)
- Transmission siting (lines cross multiple states)
- Renewable integration (wind/solar resources don't match demand)
- Coordinated decarbonization

### Coordination Failures

Current RTOs/ISOs are inadequate because:

- Voluntary membership with limited authority
- No governmental accountability
- Cannot compel transmission investment
- Subject to state vetoes on major projects

### Energy Transition Challenges

- Fossil fuel regions face economic disruption
- No mechanism for coordinated just transition
- Stranded asset costs unaddressed
- Workforce transition fragmented

## 4. Regional Grid Governance

### Regional Transmission Organizations

Each region operates unified grid authority:

- **Governance**: Regional governmental body (not private ISO)
- **Planning**: Integrated resource and transmission planning
- **Siting**: Regional authority to approve transmission projects
- **Cost allocation**: Regional formula for transmission costs
- **Reliability**: Regional reliability coordination

### Transmission Investment

Regional authority enables:

- Long-distance transmission for renewables
- Inter-regional connections
- Grid modernization investments
- Storage integration
- Demand response coordination

### Regional Interconnections

Three major interconnections continue:

- **Eastern Interconnection**: Multiple RF regions, coordinated operation
- **Western Interconnection**: Pacific and Mountain regions
- **ERCOT/Texas**: Potential single-region grid

Inter-regional coordination through federal-regional agreements.

## 5. Renewable Energy Integration

### Regional Clean Energy Standards

Regions set renewable/clean energy mandates:

**Example standards:**

| Region | 2030 Target | 2040 Target | 2050 Target |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Pacific | 80% clean | 95% clean | 100% clean |
| Northeast | 70% clean | 90% clean | 100% clean |
| Midwest | 50% clean | 70% clean | 90% clean |
| Southeast | 40% clean | 60% clean | 80% clean |
| Great Plains | 60% clean | 80% clean | 95% clean |

### Renewable Resource Development

Regional authority enables:

- Large-scale wind development in high-resource regions
- Solar deployment coordinated with grid needs
- Transmission to move renewable power to load centers
- Storage deployment for reliability
- Offshore wind in coastal regions

### Interconnection and Curtailment

Regional rules for:

- Generator interconnection queues
- Curtailment procedures
- Capacity markets for reliability
- Renewable energy credit systems

## 6. Fossil Fuel Transition

### Just Transition Framework

Regional programs for fossil fuel communities:

- **Worker transition**: Retraining, wage insurance, relocation assistance
- **Community investment**: Economic diversification funding
- **Tax base protection**: Transition assistance for local governments
- **Environmental remediation**: Cleanup funding for retired facilities

### Stranded Assets

Regional mechanisms for:

- Accelerated depreciation of fossil plants
- Securitization for early retirement
- Cost allocation across regional customers
- Pension protection for utility workers

### Production Region Considerations

Fossil fuel producing regions (e.g., Great Plains, Gulf) receive:

- Extended transition timelines
- Enhanced equalization during transition
- Federal support for diversification
- Carbon capture development support

### Carbon Capture and Storage

Regional authority over:

- CCS project permitting (surface facilities)
- Regional incentives for CCS
- CO2 pipeline siting within region
- Storage site regulation (coordination with federal)

## 7. Nuclear Energy

### Federal Authority (Retained)

NRC retains authority over:

- Reactor licensing and safety
- Security requirements

- National reliability standards maintained

### Relationship to Climate Policy

Energy is central to climate:

- Regional energy choices drive regional emissions
- Electricity decarbonization enables economy-wide transition
- See [Climate and Environment](08-climate-environment.md) for integration
