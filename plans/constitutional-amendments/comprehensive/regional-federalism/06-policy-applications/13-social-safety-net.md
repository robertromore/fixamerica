# Social Safety Net Under Regional Federalism

## How Regional Government Transforms Social Safety Net Governance

> **Purpose of this document:**
> To describe how the Regional Federal constitutional system would restructure social safety net programs, establishing federal floors while enabling regional variation and ensuring benefit portability.
>
> **Related Statutory Proposal:** [`proposals/04-social-policy-labor/social-safety-net-coordination-act.md`](../proposals/04-social-policy-labor/social-safety-net-coordination-act.md)

Social safety net programs currently vary dramatically in their federalization. Regional Federalism rationalizes this system by establishing clear federal floors while giving regions authority to design programs above those floors, with portability rules enabling mobility.

## 1. Current Federal-State Safety Net Structure

Current programs have varied federal-state relationships:

| Program | Federal Role | State Role |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Social Security | Fully federal | None |
| Medicare | Fully federal | None |
| Medicaid | Federal funding/rules | State administration/options |
| SNAP | Federal funding/rules | State administration |
| TANF | Block grant | State program design |
| Unemployment | Federal tax/framework | State benefits/administration |
| Housing | Federal funding | Mixed federal/local administration |

This creates:

- Massive variation in benefit levels
- Different eligibility rules across states
- Work requirements varying by state
- No portability when people move
- Competitive pressure on benefit levels

---

## 2. Problems Regional Federalism Addresses

### Benefit Variation

Current variation is extreme:

- TANF monthly benefits range from ~$200 to ~$800
- Medicaid eligibility varies (expansion vs. non-expansion)
- Unemployment replacement rates vary significantly
- Housing assistance availability varies dramatically

### Administrative Fragmentation

- 50 different systems for each program
- No economies of scale
- Inconsistent technology and processes
- Duplication of administrative costs

### Portability Problems

When people move:

- Benefits don't transfer automatically
- Re-application required
- Coverage gaps during transition
- Different eligibility rules apply

### Competitive Pressure on Benefits

States compete to avoid being "welfare magnets":

- Low benefits to discourage migration
- Strict eligibility to reduce caseloads
- Work requirements as barriers
- No mechanism to prevent destructive competition

---

## 3. Safety Net Powers Under Regional Federalism

### Federal Authority (Establishing Floor)

Federal government establishes constitutional floor:

- **National benefits floor**: Minimum benefit levels
- **Social Security**: Remains fully federal
- **Medicare**: Remains fully federal
- **Supplemental Security Income (SSI)**: Federal floor with regional supplement
- **SNAP floor**: Minimum food assistance level
- **Civil rights**: Non-discrimination in all programs
- **Portability requirements**: Benefits must transfer

### Regional Authority (Above Floor)

Regions control programs above federal floor:

- **Medicaid design**: Coverage beyond federal minimum
- **Cash assistance**: Regional TANF-equivalent programs
- **Unemployment supplements**: Benefits above federal floor
- **Housing programs**: Regional housing assistance
- **Food assistance supplements**: Beyond federal SNAP
- **Work requirements**: Regional approach (within rights constraints)
- **Eligibility above floor**: Regional expansions

### State/Local Authority

States and localities retain:

- Administration of regional programs
- Local implementation
- Additional local supplements where permitted
- Service delivery coordination

---

## 4. National Benefits Floor

### Constitutional Requirement

[Article X, Section 3-A](../02-design/constitution/04-fiscal-system.md) establishes:

- National minimum benefit floor
- Floor sufficient to prevent destitution
- Indexed to regional cost of living
- Not subject to waiver or block grant reduction

### Floor Components

The national benefits floor includes:

| Category | Floor Level | Adjustment |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| Health coverage | Medicaid-equivalent | N/A |
| Food assistance | SNAP at 100% poverty | Cost of living |
| Cash assistance | Basic income floor | Cost of living |
| Housing assistance | Not capped by funding | Based on need |

### Calculating the Floor

Floor levels tied to:

- Federal poverty level (updated annually)
- Regional cost-of-living adjustments
- Healthcare costs in region
- Housing costs in region

### Floor vs. Ceiling

- Floor: Minimum every region must provide
- No ceiling: Regions may exceed floor
- Equalization funding supports floor in all regions
- Regions fund supplements from regional revenue

---

## 5. Medicaid and Health Coverage

### Federal Floor

Medicaid floor requirements:

- All residents below 138% FPL covered
- Essential health benefits defined federally
- No lifetime limits
- Coverage for pre-existing conditions
- Continuous coverage without gaps

### Regional Options

Regions may exceed federal floor:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Income expansion | Coverage above 138% FPL |
| Benefit expansion | Additional services beyond EHB |
| Cost-sharing reduction | Lower copays and deductibles |
| Enrollment simplification | Presumptive eligibility, automatic renewal |

### Funding

- Federal match continues (enhanced for floor)
- Regional funding for supplements
- Equalization ensures all regions can fund floor
- No unfunded mandates on regions

### Relationship to Healthcare

See [Healthcare](01-healthcare.md) for full healthcare system design.

## 6. Cash Assistance Programs

### Federal Floor

Minimum cash assistance:

- Available to families with children below poverty
- Floor level: ~50% of poverty line (adjusted for region)
- Available to individuals with barriers to employment
- Time limits: Federal minimum duration (36 months lifetime)
- Work requirements: Cannot exceed federal standard

### Regional TANF-Equivalent

Regions design programs above floor:

**Generous Region Example:**

- Benefits: 75% of poverty line
- Time limits: 60 months
- Work requirements: Employment support, not sanctions
- Education counts as work activity
- Supportive services funded

**Moderate Region Example:**

- Benefits: 50% of poverty line (federal floor)
- Time limits: 48 months
- Work requirements: 20 hours/week with exemptions
- Job training counts as work
- Childcare provided

### Work Requirements

Federal floor on work requirements:

- Exemptions for disability, caregiving, age
- Education and training count as work
- Sanctions cannot reduce below floor
- Supportive services must be available

Regions cannot impose work requirements stricter than federal allows.

---

## 7. Unemployment Insurance

### Federal Framework (Retained)

Federal unemployment insurance structure continues:

- FUTA tax on employers
- Federal minimum standards
- Extended benefits during recessions
- Trade adjustment assistance

### Regional Enhancement

Regions control benefits above federal minimum:

| Element | Federal Floor | Regional Option |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| Replacement rate | 50% of wages | Up to 70% |
| Duration | 26 weeks | Up to 52 weeks |
| Eligibility | Standard lookback | Expanded eligibility |
| Gig workers | Minimum coverage | Full coverage |

### Funding

- Federal FUTA provides base funding
- Regional taxes fund supplements
- Experience rating remains
- Equalization for regional recessions

### Regional Recessions

When one region faces recession:

- Federal extended benefits activate
- Inter-regional transfers support affected region
- Coordinated standards during downturns
- Automatic stabilizers function

## 10. Benefit Portability and Migration

### Portability Guarantee

[Article I, Section 8](../02-design/constitution/01-regional-structure.md) guarantees freedom of movement:

- Benefits cannot be conditioned on residence duration
- No waiting periods for floor benefits
- Immediate coverage upon regional relocation
- No "welfare migration" restrictions

### Portability Rules

| Benefit Type | Portability Rule |
|--------------|------------------|
| Medicaid | Immediate coverage in new region |
| SNAP | Immediate transfer |
| Cash assistance | Pro-rated transfer, immediate floor |
| Unemployment | Claims follow worker |
| Housing voucher | Portable across regions |

### Transition Mechanics

When person moves from Region A to Region B:

1. Floor benefits continue immediately in Region B
2. Region B supplement begins after 30 days
3. No gap in coverage
4. Electronic records transfer
5. No re-application for floor benefits

### Migration Concerns

Federal floor establishes baseline protections:

- All regions must provide floor
- Generous regions protected from migration pressure
- Equalization funds floor everywhere
- Regional supplements funded regionally

---

## 11. Implementation Considerations

### Federal Floor Funding

- Federal government funds floor level in all regions
- Enhanced equalization for regions with limited capacity
- No unfunded mandates
- Anti-coercion rule prevents conditional funding

### Technology and Administration

Regional administration with federal standards:

- Integrated eligibility systems
- Cross-regional data sharing (with privacy)
- Common benefit delivery platforms
- Modernized enrollment technology

### Transition

Transition from current system:

- Current programs continue during transition
- Regional consolidation of administration
- Federal floor phases in
- Equalization adjustments

### Political Feasibility

Safety net redesign requires:

- Federal funding commitment for floor
- Regional acceptance of floor requirements
- Portability rules that don't disadvantage generous regions
- Work requirement floor protecting recipients

---
