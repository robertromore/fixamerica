# Social Safety Net Under Regional Federalism

## Status: Outline Only

This document outlines how social safety net programs would function under Regional Federalism. Full analysis to be developed.

---

## The Challenge

Social safety net programs are inconsistently federalized:

- Social Security/Medicare: federal
- Medicaid: federal-state partnership
- SNAP: federal with state administration
- TANF: block grants with state variation
- Unemployment: federal-state hybrid
- Massive variation in benefit levels and eligibility

## Regional Federalism Approach

### Federal Authority (retained)

- Social Security (national floor)
- Medicare (national program)
- National benefits floor
- Civil rights in benefits
- Benefit portability requirements

### Regional Authority (new)

- Regional standards above federal floor
- Medicaid design (within federal floor)
- Regional TANF-equivalent programs
- Regional unemployment supplements
- Regional housing assistance
- Regional food assistance supplements

### Constitutional Provisions

- Article X (Fiscal Architecture) requires "national benefits floor"
- No unfunded mandates on safety net programs
- Equalization transfers support regional capacity

## Key Questions to Research

### National Floor

- What's included in "national benefits floor"?
- How high should the floor be?
- Is it cash-equivalent or program-specific?
- How does floor interact with regional supplements?

### Medicaid

- How does Medicaid work regionally?
- What's the federal floor for coverage?
- Can regions expand beyond federal floor?
- How does funding work (federal match)?

### Cash Assistance

- Can regions design different TANF programs?
- What's the federal floor for cash assistance?
- How do work requirements vary regionally?
- What happens when recipients move?

### Unemployment

- How do regional supplements work?
- Can regions have different eligibility rules?
- How does benefit portability work?
- What happens in regional recessions?

### Benefit Portability

- How do benefits transfer when people move?
- What prevents "welfare migration" concerns?
- How do you handle different regional benefit levels?

## Comparative Models to Study

- **Germany**: Federal social insurance with Länder supplements
- **Canada**: Provincial variation with federal transfers
- **Switzerland**: Cantonal variation with federal coordination
- **EU**: Member state systems with coordination rules

## Scenarios to Analyze

1. **Medicaid expansion** - All regions expand above federal floor
2. **TANF variation** - Pacific Region generous, Southeast Region restrictive
3. **Unemployment** - Regional recession hits one region hard
4. **Migration** - Person moves from high-benefit to low-benefit region
5. **National floor** - What's the minimum every region must provide?

## Design Tensions

### Equity vs Variation

- How much variation in basic needs programs is acceptable?
- Does regional variation create second-class citizens?
- What's the role of national solidarity?

### Portability vs Local Control

- How do you ensure mobility when benefits differ?
- What transition rules apply when people move?
- How long until new regional benefits apply?

### Funding

- How do poorer regions fund adequate safety nets?
- What's the equalization transfer role?
- How do you prevent race to bottom?
