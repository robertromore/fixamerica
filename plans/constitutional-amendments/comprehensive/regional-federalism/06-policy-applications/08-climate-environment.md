# Climate and Environment Under Regional Federalism

## Status: Outline Only

This document outlines how climate and environmental policy would function under Regional Federalism. Full analysis to be developed.

---

## The Challenge

Environmental policy under current federalism is dysfunctional:

- Federal policy swings dramatically with administrations
- States can't effectively address interstate pollution
- Climate policy paralyzed at federal level
- Race to bottom in environmental standards
- Transboundary issues (water, air) poorly addressed
- No mechanism for regional coordination on shared resources

## Regional Federalism Approach

### Federal Authority (retained)

- National minimum standards (floors)
- International agreements and treaties
- Interstate pollution disputes
- Endangered species (national concern)
- Federal lands management
- National parks and monuments

### Regional Authority (primary)

- Standards above federal floors
- Regional emissions targets
- Cap-and-trade or carbon pricing within region
- Regional renewable mandates
- Regional water management
- Air quality standards above federal floor
- Regional land use coordination

### Constitutional Provisions (already in document)

- Water rights framework (Article I, Section 7)
- Environmental border protection (Article I, Section 10)
- Transboundary pollution prohibition

## Key Questions to Research

### Climate Policy

- Can regions implement carbon pricing independently?
- How do regional emissions targets aggregate nationally?
- What's the federal floor for climate action?
- How do cap-and-trade systems work across regions?

### Interstate Environmental Issues

- How does the Water Resources Coordination Board work?
- What enforcement exists for transboundary pollution?
- How are shared ecosystems managed?
- What happens when upstream region pollutes?

### Energy Transition

- Can regions mandate renewable energy percentages?
- How do regional grids interact?
- What's the federal role in energy infrastructure?
- How do fossil fuel producing regions transition?

### Adaptation

- How do regions coordinate on flood control, fire management?
- What's the federal role in climate adaptation?
- How are climate migration and displacement handled?

## Comparative Models to Study

- **EU**: Member state variation with EU-wide targets
- **Germany**: Länder implementation of federal environmental law
- **Canada**: Provincial carbon pricing with federal backstop
- **Australia**: State variation with federal coordination

---

## Scenarios to Analyze

1. **Pacific Region carbon tax** - Border adjustment with other regions?
2. **Coal region transition** - How does Great Plains Region handle job losses?
3. **Water dispute** - Colorado River allocation among Southwest Region states
4. **Air pollution** - Midwest factory affecting Northeast air quality
5. **Renewable mandate** - Region requires 100% clean electricity by 2040

## Climate-Specific Issues

### Regional Variation Risks

- Carbon leakage to low-regulation regions
- "Pollution havens" within United States
- Race to bottom on enforcement

### Regional Variation Benefits

- Laboratories of democracy for climate policy
- Regions can move faster than federal government
- Tailored approaches to regional conditions

### Design Questions

- Should there be federal climate floor?
- How aggressive can it be given regional variation?
- What mechanism prevents regions from undermining each other?
