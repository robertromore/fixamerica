## 1. Current Federal-State Environmental Structure

The current system fragments environmental authority:

- **EPA**: Federal standards (often unenforced)
- **State agencies**: Implementation with wide variation
- **Interstate compacts**: Ad hoc, limited authority
- **Federal lands**: BLM, Forest Service, Park Service
- **Water**: Complex federal-state-interstate regime

This fragmentation creates:

- Inconsistent enforcement across state borders
- Pollution externalities (upstream pollutes, downstream suffers)
- Climate policy paralysis at federal level
- Competitive pressure on environmental standards
- Inability to manage ecosystems that cross state lines
- Water disputes with no effective resolution mechanism

---

## 2. Problems Regional Federalism Addresses

### Scale Mismatch

States are too small for:

- Airshed management (pollution crosses borders daily)
- Watershed coordination (rivers don't respect state lines)
- Carbon pricing with meaningful market size
- Grid-scale renewable energy planning
- Ecosystem management (forests, wetlands span states)

The nation is too large for:

- Uniform policy fitting Alaska and Florida
- Responsive adaptation to regional climate impacts
- Democratic accountability for environmental decisions
- Tailored solutions to regional economic structures

### Coordination Failures

Current structure produces:

- **Air pollution**: Midwest emissions affect Northeast air quality
- **Water conflicts**: Colorado River overallocated, no resolution mechanism
- **Climate policy**: Patchwork of state programs, federal paralysis
- **Energy transition**: Uncoordinated grid planning

### Political Gridlock

National environmental policy faces:

- Fossil fuel state vetoes on climate action
- Administration-by-administration policy swings
- All-or-nothing dynamics preventing incremental progress
- Inability to experiment without federal permission

## 3. Environmental Powers Under Regional Federalism

This section applies the allocation framework established in [Article II](../02-design/constitution/02-powers-and-rights.md) and operationalized by the [Allocation Framework Act](../proposals/01-foundations/allocation-framework-act.md).

### Federal Powers (Enumerated)

Federal authority limited to:

- **National minimum standards**: Environmental floors that no Region may undercut ([Article III](../02-design/constitution/02-powers-and-rights.md))
- **International agreements**: Treaty obligations, Paris Agreement commitments
- **Interstate pollution disputes**: When Regions cannot resolve through Water Court or ARB
- **Endangered species**: National concern species, critical habitat
- **Federal lands**: National parks, monuments, BLM lands, national forests
- **Transboundary pollution prohibition**: Article I, Section 10 enforcement

### Regional Powers (Primary)

Regions would control ([Article I](../02-design/constitution/01-regional-structure.md)):

- **Standards above federal floors**: More stringent air, water, emissions limits
- **Regional carbon pricing**: Cap-and-trade or carbon tax within region
- **Regional renewable mandates**: Clean electricity standards
- **Regional water management**: Allocation within region, coordination via Water Court for interstate
- **Air quality standards**: Above federal floor, regional airshed management
- **Regional land use**: Coordination of development, conservation, habitat

### State Powers (Retained)

States retain:

- Local environmental enforcement (within regional frameworks)
- State parks and conservation areas
- Local land use decisions (within regional standards)
- Facility permitting (applying regional standards)

### Constitutional Provisions

Key provisions already in the Regional Federal Constitution:

- **Water rights framework**: [Article I, Section 7](../02-design/constitution/01-regional-structure.md) - National Water Resources Coordination Board, equitable apportionment
- **Environmental border protection**: [Article I, Section 10](../02-design/constitution/01-regional-structure.md) - Transboundary pollution prohibition
- **National Water Court**: [Article I, Section 7(f)](../02-design/constitution/01-regional-structure.md) - Binding adjudication of interstate water disputes

---

## 4. Regional Climate Systems Design

### Option A: Regional Carbon Tax

A region could implement carbon pricing:

- Tax on carbon content of fossil fuels
- Revenue recycled as dividend, invested in transition, or both
- Border adjustment for goods from other regions
- Phased increase providing investment certainty
- Must not fall below federal floor (if established)

**Example**: Pacific Region implements $50/ton carbon tax with border adjustment, using revenue for clean energy investment and household dividends.

### Option B: Regional Cap-and-Trade

A region could establish emissions trading:

- Regional emissions cap declining over time
- Tradeable allowances allocated or auctioned
- Market determines price of carbon
- Linkage possible with other regional programs
- Offsets for carbon removal projects

**Example**: Northeast Region establishes cap-and-trade linked with existing RGGI, expanding to transportation and buildings.

### Option C: Regional Clean Energy Standard

A region could mandate clean electricity:

- Percentage of electricity from clean sources increasing over time
- Technology-neutral (renewables, nuclear, CCS)
- Tradeable clean energy credits
- Compliance flexibility for utilities

**Example**: Mountain West Region requires 80% clean electricity by 2035, 100% by 2045.

### Option D: Hybrid Approach

A region could combine mechanisms:

- Carbon tax for sectors outside trading (transportation, buildings)
- Cap-and-trade for power sector
- Clean fuel standard for transportation
- Building performance standards

### Inter-Regional Coordination

Under [Article I, Section 5](../02-design/constitution/01-regional-structure.md), Regions may cooperate on climate:

- **Linked carbon markets**: Multiple Regions connect cap-and-trade systems
- **Joint renewable procurement**: Regions cooperate on large-scale projects
- **Grid integration**: Coordinated transmission planning
- **Border adjustment alignment**: Common treatment of goods from non-participating regions

Such agreements must specify governance, cost-sharing, dispute resolution, and withdrawal procedures per Article I, Section 5(d).

## 5. Water Resources Management

### Current Crisis

Water in the American West faces:

- Colorado River overallocated by 20%+
- Groundwater depletion accelerating
- Climate change reducing snowpack
- No effective dispute resolution
- Interstate compacts inadequate

### Regional Federalism Solution

The [Interstate Water Resources Coordination Act](../proposals/05-environment-infrastructure/water-resources-coordination-act.md) implements Article I, Section 7:

**National Water Resources Coordination Board**:

- One representative per Region, EPA rep, Army Corps rep, two Tribal representatives
- Develops equitable apportionment principles
- Coordinates major infrastructure
- Monitors basin health

**National Water Court** ([Article I, Section 7(f)](../02-design/constitution/01-regional-structure.md)):

- Binding adjudication of interstate water disputes
- Applies equitable apportionment doctrine
- Can modify existing allocations based on changed conditions
- Enforcement through federal courts

**Regional Water Authorities**:

- Manage allocation within region
- Coordinate with upstream/downstream regions
- Implement conservation measures
- Plan infrastructure investments

### Practical Application

**Colorado River Basin**:

1. Southwest Region and Mountain West Region negotiate allocation
2. National Water Court mediates disputes
3. Tribal water rights honored per Article XX, Section 3
4. Climate change adaptation built into agreements
5. Groundwater and surface water managed together

## 6. Air Quality and Pollution Control

### Transboundary Pollution

[Article I, Section 10](../02-design/constitution/01-regional-structure.md) prohibits:

> No State or Region shall permit activities within its jurisdiction that cause significant environmental degradation in another State or Region.

The [Transboundary Environmental Protection Act](../proposals/05-environment-infrastructure/transboundary-environmental-protection-act.md) implements this with:

- EPA monitoring of cross-border pollution
- Civil penalties (not equalization withholding per Anti-Coercion Rule)
- Federal court enforcement
- Injunctive relief available

### Regional Airshed Management

Regions can manage air quality at the appropriate scale:

- **Ozone precursors**: Regional controls on sources affecting multi-state airshed
- **Particulate matter**: Coordinated wildfire smoke response
- **Toxic releases**: Regional standards above federal floors
- **Mobile sources**: Regional vehicle emission standards (California-style authority)

### Advantages Over Current System

- Midwest Region cannot externalize pollution costs to Northeast
- Regional accountability for air quality outcomes
- Scale matches actual airshed boundaries
- Coordinated response to wildfires crossing state lines

---

## 7. Energy Transition

### Regional Grid Planning

Regions would coordinate energy infrastructure:

- **Transmission planning**: Regional authority over siting, eliminating state-by-state vetoes
- **Renewable integration**: Coordinated intermittent resource management
- **Storage deployment**: Regional approach to grid-scale batteries
- **Nuclear**: Regional decision on new nuclear construction

### Fossil Fuel Transition

Regional Federalism enables differentiated transition timelines reflecting regional economic structures:

**Regions with Fossil-Fuel-Dependent Economies** (e.g., Great Plains):

- Longer transition timelines with equalization support
- Economic diversification investment
- Workforce transition programs
- Community economic development assistance

**Regions with Service/Technology-Based Economies** (e.g., Pacific):

- Shorter transition timelines feasible given economic structure
- Clean electricity export opportunities
- Clean technology manufacturing development

These different timelines reflect regional economic realities, not value judgments about environmental commitment. All Regions must meet federal environmental floors; transition pace above floors reflects regional democratic choice and economic feasibility.

### Federal Role

Federal government retains:

- National transmission corridors
- Nuclear safety regulation (NRC)
- Fuel efficiency standards (floor)
- Federal tax incentives
- Research and development

### Inter-Regional Grid

Under Article I, Section 5, Regions can create:

- **Regional transmission organizations**: Coordinating power markets
- **Clean energy sharing agreements**: Surplus renewable exports
- **Backup capacity sharing**: Mutual assistance during extreme events

---

## 8. Land Use and Conservation

### Regional Conservation Planning

Regions can coordinate:

- **Wildlife corridors**: Habitat connectivity across state lines
- **Forest management**: Fire prevention, carbon sequestration
- **Wetland protection**: Regional watershed approach
- **Agricultural conservation**: Coordinated soil and water programs

### Development and Sprawl

Regional authority enables:

- **Growth management**: Regional approach to urban expansion
- **Habitat protection**: No state-by-state undermining
- **Agricultural preservation**: Regional food system planning

### Federal Lands Integration

Federal lands within Regions would be coordinated:

- Regional input on Forest Service and BLM management plans
- Fire management coordination
- Recreation access coordination
- Tribal co-management honored per Article XX, Section 3

---

## 9. Climate Adaptation

### Regional Adaptation Planning

Regions can address climate impacts at scale:

- **Flood control**: Regional watershed management, not county-by-county
- **Fire management**: Coordinated fuel reduction, firefighting
- **Coastal protection**: Regional sea level rise response
- **Heat resilience**: Coordinated public health response

### Climate Migration

Regional Federalism enables:

- **Managed retreat**: Regional coordination of relocating communities
- **Receiving community planning**: Regional approach to climate migrants
- **Economic transition**: Diversification of climate-vulnerable economies

### Federal Support

Federal role in adaptation:

- National flood insurance reform
- Disaster relief (coordinated with regional programs)
- Climate science and projections
- Technical assistance

---

## 10. Implementation Considerations

### Transition

Environmental transition under Regional Federalism would require:

- Phased transfer of state environmental programs to regional coordination
- Federal EPA maintains floor-setting authority
- Existing permits honored during transition
- Gradual buildout of regional environmental agencies

### Equalization

Fiscal equalization ([Article X, Section 3](../02-design/constitution/04-fiscal-system.md)), operationalized by the [Fiscal Equalization Act](../05-implementation/04-fiscal-equalization-act.md), ensures:

- All Regions can fund adequate environmental protection
- Fossil-fuel-dependent Regions receive transition support
- Coordinated regional standards
- National solidarity on climate action

### Variation and Experimentation

Regional Federalism enables:

- Different Regions trying different carbon pricing approaches
- Learning from regional experiments
- Adaptation to regional economic structures
- Innovation without federal permission

### Federal Floors Prevent

- Standards below national minimums
- Pollution havens within the United States
- Enforcement below federal standards
- Climate action undermining by holdout Regions

### Carbon Leakage Prevention

To prevent businesses relocating to low-regulation Regions:

- Federal carbon floor (minimum price or standard)
- Regional border adjustments for carbon content
- Anti-Coercion Rule prevents punitive measures but allows legitimate border adjustments
- Inter-regional agreements on mutual recognition

---

## Summary

Regional Federalism transforms environmental governance by:

1. **Matching scale to function**: Regions large enough to manage airsheds, watersheds, and ecosystems, small enough for democratic accountability
2. **Enabling experimentation**: Different Regions can try carbon taxes, cap-and-trade, or clean energy standards
3. **Resolving water conflicts**: National Water Court provides binding dispute resolution
4. **Preventing pollution externalities**: Article I, Section 10 prohibits transboundary pollution
5. **Supporting transition**: Equalization helps fossil-fuel-dependent Regions

Climate and environmental policy under Regional Federalism represents the system's approach applied to a critical policy domain:

> **Federal floors for minimum standards.
> Regional authority for climate action and environmental management.
> Effective coordination at the scale of actual environmental systems.**
