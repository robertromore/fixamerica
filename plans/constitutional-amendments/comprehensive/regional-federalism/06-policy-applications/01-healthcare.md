## 1. Current Federal-State Healthcare Structure

The current system divides healthcare authority inconsistently:

- **Medicare**: Fully federal
- **Medicaid**: Federal-state partnership with wide state variation
- **Insurance regulation**: Primarily state-based
- **Public health**: State/local with federal support
- **Provider licensing**: State-based
- **Drug approval**: Federal (FDA)

This fragmentation creates:

- Coverage gaps at state borders
- Medicaid variation creating inconsistent coverage
- 50+ different insurance regulatory regimes
- Inconsistent public health response
- Provider shortages in some states, surpluses in others

---

## 2. Problems Regional Federalism Addresses

### Scale Mismatch

States are too small for:

- Risk pooling across adequate populations
- Negotiating power with consolidated hospital systems
- Coordinating care across metropolitan areas that span state lines
- Building specialized healthcare infrastructure

The nation is too large for:

- Uniform policy that fits Boston and rural Mississippi
- Responsive adaptation to regional health needs
- Democratic accountability for healthcare decisions

### Coordination Failures

Current structure produces:

- Border effects (people crossing state lines for different Medicaid rules)
- Fragmented public health response (COVID-19 demonstrated this)
- Inconsistent insurance markets
- Provider distribution failures

### Political Gridlock

National healthcare reform faces:

- Existential political stakes (national elections hinge on healthcare)
- All-or-nothing dynamics
- Inability to experiment without federal permission

---

## 3. Healthcare Powers Under Regional Federalism

This section applies the allocation framework established in [Article II](../02-design/constitution/02-powers-and-rights.md) and operationalized by the [Allocation Framework Act](../05-implementation/03-allocation-framework-act.md).

### Federal Powers (Enumerated)

Federal authority limited to ([Article II](../02-design/constitution/02-powers-and-rights.md)):

- **Rights floors**: Minimum coverage standards, non-discrimination ([Article III](../02-design/constitution/00-index.md))
- **Medicare**: Federal program for elderly/disabled continues
- **Drug/device approval**: FDA authority preserved
- **National benefits floor**: Portable baseline coverage
- **Emergency coordination**: Pandemic response framework ([Article XVII](../../../../single-topic/emergency-powers-reform/))

### Regional Powers (Exclusive)

Regions would control ([Article I](../02-design/constitution/00-index.md)):

- **Insurance market regulation** above federal floors
- **Regional rate-setting** or all-payer systems
- **Medicaid administration** (with federal funding)
- **Public health coordination** across member states
- **Healthcare workforce policy** (licensing compacts, distribution incentives)
- **Regional coverage systems** (public option, single-payer if chosen)

### State Powers (Retained)

States retain:

- Provider licensing (within regional compacts)
- Local public health implementation
- Facility regulation
- Scope of practice rules (within regional frameworks)

---

## 4. Regional Healthcare Systems Design

### Option A: Regional Single-Payer

A region could implement single-payer healthcare:

- All residents covered by regional program
- Funded by regional taxes (within fiscal architecture)
- Providers paid by single regional payer
- Federal Medicare dollars flow to region for eligible population
- Must meet federal rights floors

### Option B: Regional Public Option

A region could create a public insurance option:

- Competes with private insurers on regional exchange
- Available to all residents and employers
- Uses regional negotiating power for rates
- Provides fallback coverage

### Option C: Regional All-Payer Rate-Setting

A region could establish uniform prices:

- All payers (public and private) pay same rates
- Regional rate-setting commission establishes prices
- Similar to Maryland's current system, but regional scale
- Reduces administrative complexity

### Option D: Enhanced ACA Framework

A region could strengthen the ACA model:

- Regional exchange with enhanced subsidies
- Stronger network adequacy requirements
- Regional risk adjustment
- State flexibility within regional framework

### Inter-Regional Cooperation

Under [Article I, Section 5](../02-design/constitution/00-index.md), two or more Regions may cooperate on healthcare:

- **Joint purchasing pools**: Multiple Regions negotiate drug prices together
- **Shared specialty networks**: Regions cooperate on rare disease centers or specialized facilities
- **Coordinated coverage systems**: Adjacent Regions align eligibility and benefits for border populations
- **Common credentialing**: Multi-regional provider licensing agreements

Such agreements must specify governance, cost-sharing, dispute resolution, and withdrawal procedures per Article I, Section 5(d).

---

## 5. Coverage and Access

### Regional Approach to Universal Coverage

Regional governments can ensure baseline access while adapting to local conditions:

- **Floor guarantee**: Federal rights floors ([Article III](../02-design/constitution/00-index.md)) ensure minimum coverage everywhere
- **Regional enhancement**: Regions may exceed floors based on regional preferences
- **No coverage gaps**: Regional administration eliminates state border effects
- **Portability**: Benefits floor ensures coverage travels within and across regions

### Addressing the Coverage Gap

Under regional federalism:

- Coverage gap population would be covered by regional Medicaid or regional public option
- No state can opt out of baseline coverage within a region
- Regional democratic accountability for coverage decisions
- Federal equalization ensures all regions can fund adequate coverage

---

## 6. Cost Control Mechanisms

### Regional Rate-Setting

Regions could implement rate-setting with appropriate scale:

- Regional market power vs. consolidated hospital systems
- Uniform rates reduce administrative complexity
- Can include global budgets for hospitals
- Democratic accountability for rate decisions

### Regional Drug Negotiation

Regions could negotiate drug prices:

- Larger purchasing pools than individual states
- Regional formularies with negotiated prices
- Coordination with federal Medicare negotiation
- Can implement reference pricing

### Administrative Simplification

Regional systems reduce complexity:

- Single set of rules per region (vs. 50 state variations)
- Unified billing and prior authorization
- Regional provider networks
- Standardized quality reporting

---

## 7. Medicaid Under Regional Administration

### Current Problems

- State-by-state variation creates coverage cliffs
- States can opt out of expansion
- Countercyclical pressure (need rises when state revenue falls)
- Variable eligibility, benefits, payment rates

### Regional Medicaid Design

Under regional federalism:

- **Regional administration**: Regions administer Medicaid for member states
- **Federal funding**: 90%+ federal match continues
- **Federal floors**: Minimum eligibility (138% FPL), benefit requirements
- **Regional enhancement**: Regions may exceed floors
- **No opt-out**: All states within a region participate
- **Coordination**: Unified eligibility, benefits across region

### Advantages

- Eliminates border effects within regions
- Larger risk pools
- Regional democratic accountability
- Can coordinate with regional coverage systems
- Maintains federal funding and floors

---

## 8. Medicare Integration

### Dual Eligible Coordination

Under regional federalism:

- Regions coordinate care for dual eligibles (Medicare + Medicaid)
- Regional integrated care programs
- Single point of contact for beneficiaries
- Aligned incentives across programs

### Medicare Advantage Oversight

Regions could have role in:

- Network adequacy standards
- Quality oversight
- Coordination with regional systems

### Federal Medicare Preserved

Core Medicare remains federal:

- National program for elderly/disabled
- Federal benefit standards
- Federal financing (payroll tax, general revenue)
- National portability

---

## 9. Public Health Coordination

### Regional Public Health Authority

Regions would coordinate public health across member states:

- Regional disease surveillance
- Coordinated pandemic response
- Regional health department standards
- Cross-state outbreak response

### Advantages Over Current System

- Eliminates fragmented response (COVID-19 lessons)
- Scale for specialized capabilities
- Unified data systems
- Coordinated with regional healthcare systems

### Federal Role

Federal government retains:

- CDC coordination across regions
- International health security
- National standards and guidelines
- Emergency funding

---

## 10. Workforce Distribution

### Regional Workforce Planning

Regions could address provider shortages:

- Regional graduate medical education planning
- Loan forgiveness tied to regional need
- Scope of practice harmonization within region
- Telehealth across state lines within region

### Licensing Compacts

- Regional licensing (practice anywhere in region)
- Portability within region
- Coordinated with other regions for cross-regional practice

---

## 11. Implementation Considerations

### Transition

Healthcare transition under regional federalism would require:

- Phased implementation (coverage systems, then payment, then full integration)
- Federal waiver authority during transition
- Protection for existing coverage
- Gradual Medicaid transition to regional administration

### Equalization

Fiscal equalization ([Article X, Section 3](../02-design/constitution/04-fiscal-system.md)), operationalized by the [Fiscal Equalization Act](../05-implementation/04-fiscal-equalization-act.md), ensures:

- All regions can fund adequate healthcare
- Lower-income regions receive support
- Coordinated regional standards
- National solidarity maintained

### Variation and Experimentation

Regional federalism enables:

- Different regions trying different approaches
- Learning from regional experiments
- Adaptation to regional preferences
- Innovation without national permission

### Federal Floors Prevent

- Coverage below minimum standards
- Discrimination
- Benefit inadequacy
- Standards below federal floors

---

## Summary

Regional federalism transforms healthcare governance by:

1. **Matching scale to function**: Regions large enough for risk pooling and market power, small enough for democratic accountability
2. **Enabling experimentation**: Different regions can try single-payer, public option, all-payer, or enhanced ACA
3. **Eliminating fragmentation**: Regional administration replaces 50-state patchwork
4. **Maintaining floors**: Federal rights floors establish baseline protections
5. **Preserving Medicare**: National program continues with regional coordination

Healthcare under regional federalism represents the system's approach applied to a critical policy domain:

> **Federal floors for rights and minimum standards.
> Regional authority for system design and administration.
> Democratic accountability at the appropriate scale.**
