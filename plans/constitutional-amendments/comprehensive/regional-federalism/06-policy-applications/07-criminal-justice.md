## 1. Current Federal-State Criminal Justice Structure

The current system divides criminal justice authority inconsistently:

- **Federal crimes**: Limited enumerated offenses (interstate commerce, federal lands, etc.)
- **State criminal codes**: 50+ different definitions, penalties
- **Local policing**: Thousands of independent police departments
- **State courts**: Primary criminal jurisdiction
- **Federal courts**: Federal crimes, habeas corpus review
- **Corrections**: Federal prisons, state prisons, local jails

This fragmentation creates:

- Sentencing for identical conduct varying by orders of magnitude
- Death penalty in some states, abolished in others
- Policing ranging from community-oriented to highly militarized
- Mass incarceration concentrated in certain states
- Wildly different bail and pretrial detention systems
- Inconsistent civil rights enforcement

---

## 2. Problems Regional Federalism Addresses

### Scale Mismatch

States are too small for:

- Addressing cross-border crime patterns
- Coordinating law enforcement across metropolitan areas
- Managing prison systems efficiently
- Providing specialized courts and treatment programs
- Ensuring consistent rights protections

The nation is too large for:

- Uniform sentencing fitting rural Maine and urban Los Angeles
- Centralized policing responsive to local conditions
- One-size-fits-all approaches to community safety
- Democratic accountability for criminal justice policy

### Coordination Failures

Current structure produces:

- **Extradition complexities**: Different crimes, different penalties
- **Hot pursuit limitations**: Criminal crosses state line, pursuit ends
- **Evidence sharing barriers**: State-by-state rules
- **Parole/probation transfers**: Inconsistent supervision

### Equal Protection Concerns

Current system creates:

- Geographic lottery determining punishment severity
- Racial disparities magnified by local discretion
- Wealth-based detention (cash bail)
- Inconsistent enforcement of constitutional rights

## 3. Criminal Justice Powers Under Regional Federalism

This section applies the allocation framework established in [Article II](../02-design/constitution/02-powers-and-rights.md) and operationalized by the [Allocation Framework Act](../05-implementation/03-allocation-framework-act.md).

### Federal Powers (Enumerated)

Federal authority limited to:

- **Constitutional rights floors**: 4th, 5th, 6th, 8th Amendment enforcement ([Article III](../02-design/constitution/02-powers-and-rights.md))
- **Federal crimes**: Interstate commerce, federal lands, crimes against the United States
- **Civil rights enforcement**: Discrimination, pattern-or-practice investigations
- **Federal prison system**: For federal offenses
- **Interstate fugitive coordination**: Ensuring cooperation under Article I, Section 11

### Regional Powers (Primary)

Regions would control:

- **Regional criminal code frameworks**: Harmonized definitions within region
- **Sentencing guidelines**: Regional standards, ranges, alternatives
- **Death penalty policy**: Regional decision to retain or abolish
- **Policing standards**: Regional accountability frameworks
- **Regional corrections**: Prison systems, rehabilitation programs
- **Bail reform**: Regional standards for pretrial detention

### State/Local Powers (Retained)

States and localities retain:

- Local policing (within regional standards)
- County prosecution (within regional frameworks)
- Local courts (applying regional and state law)
- Local jail operation (meeting regional standards)
- Community-specific programs

### Constitutional Rights Framework

Key protections under Regional Federalism:

- **Rights floors, not ceilings**: [Article III](../02-design/constitution/02-powers-and-rights.md) - Regions may exceed but not undercut federal rights
- **Due process**: Federal floor ensures minimum protections everywhere
- **Non-discrimination**: Federal enforcement regardless of regional policy
- **Habeas corpus**: Federal court review of regional and state detention

---

## 4. Rights Floors and Protections

### Federal Floors (Minimum Everywhere)

Under [Article III](../02-design/constitution/02-powers-and-rights.md), no Region may provide less than:

**Fourth Amendment Floor**:

- Warrant requirement (with established exceptions)
- Probable cause standard
- Exclusionary rule for unconstitutional searches
- Limits on surveillance without judicial oversight

**Fifth Amendment Floor**:

- Right against self-incrimination
- Grand jury indictment for serious offenses (or equivalent process)
- Double jeopardy protection
- Due process in proceedings

**Sixth Amendment Floor**:

- Right to counsel (effective assistance standard)
- Speedy trial requirements (minimum timelines)
- Jury trial for serious offenses
- Confrontation of witnesses
- Compulsory process for defense witnesses

**Eighth Amendment Floor**:

- Prohibition on torture and cruel treatment
- Proportionality in sentencing (constitutional limits)
- Conditions of confinement standards
- Bail reform floor (limits on pretrial detention for inability to pay)

### Regional Enhancement

Regions may exceed federal floors:

- Broader exclusionary rules
- Stronger right to counsel (earlier appointment, better funding)
- Stricter limits on pretrial detention
- Additional procedural protections
- Sentencing maximums below federal constitutional limits

---

## 5. Regional Criminal Justice Systems Design

### Option A: Rehabilitation-Focused Model

A Region could prioritize rehabilitation:

- Sentencing emphasizing treatment and skill development
- Diversion programs for non-violent offenses
- Education and job training in corrections
- Shorter sentences with supervised reintegration
- Focus on reducing recidivism through support services

**Example**: Pacific Region implements corrections focused on rehabilitation, education, and workforce preparation.

### Option B: Incapacitation-Focused Model

A Region could prioritize public safety through incapacitation:

- Sentencing emphasizing removal of offenders from community
- Stricter eligibility for diversion programs
- Secure corrections with structured programming
- Longer sentences with earned release opportunities
- Focus on protecting communities from repeat offenders

**Example**: Gulf Region implements longer sentences with structured release conditions and regional consistency replacing state-by-state variation.

### Option C: Restorative Justice Model

A Region could emphasize restoration:

- Victim-offender mediation programs
- Community conferencing
- Restitution-focused sentencing
- Circle sentencing for appropriate offenses
- Integration of Tribal justice models (with tribal consent)

**Example**: Great Lakes Region implements restorative justice for non-violent offenses with victim participation in sentencing.

### Option D: Hybrid/Evidence-Based Model

A Region could combine approaches based on evidence:

- Risk assessment informing supervision levels
- Treatment mandates for drug-related offenses
- Traditional responses for violent crime
- Graduated sanctions
- Continuous outcome monitoring

### Inter-Regional Coordination

Under [Article I, Section 11](../02-design/constitution/01-regional-structure.md), Regions cooperate on:

- **Extradition**: Streamlined process within federal framework
- **Hot pursuit**: Authority to continue across regional lines
- **Evidence sharing**: Mutual legal assistance
- **Witness protection**: Cross-regional programs
- **Parole/probation transfer**: Interstate Compact adaptation

---

## 6. Policing and Law Enforcement

### Regional Policing Standards

Regions would establish:

- **Use of force policies**: Regional standards (above federal floor)
- **Training requirements**: Minimum hours, de-escalation, bias training
- **Certification/decertification**: Regional database of officers
- **Accountability mechanisms**: Civilian oversight requirements
- **Equipment restrictions**: Limits on militarization

### Local Implementation

Localities retain:

- Day-to-day policing decisions
- Community policing strategies
- Local hiring (meeting regional certification)
- Budget allocation within regional frameworks

### Regional Coordination

Regional structures enable:

- **Metropolitan coordination**: Unified approach across metro areas
- **Specialized units**: Regional task forces for complex crimes
- **Training academies**: Regional standards, economies of scale
- **Data systems**: Regional crime statistics, officer databases

### Federal Role

Federal government retains:

- FBI for federal crimes
- Civil rights investigations (pattern-or-practice)
- Technical assistance
- National crime databases

---

## 7. Sentencing and Incarceration

### Addressing Sentencing Disparity

Current problem: Same conduct gets 5 years in one state, 25 in another.

Regional solution:

- **Regional sentencing guidelines**: Harmonized ranges within region
- **Proportionality principles**: Regional consistency
- **Structured discretion**: Judges work within regional frameworks
- **Departure standards**: Clear criteria for above/below guidelines

### Death Penalty

Regional Federalism allows:

- Regions decide whether to retain or abolish capital punishment
- Federal floor prohibits methods constituting cruel and unusual punishment
- Regional variation reflects democratic choice within region
- Cross-regional extradition addressed in agreements (see Section 8)

### Regional Corrections

Regional prison systems would:

- Replace 50 state systems with ~8 regional systems
- Enable specialization (mental health, substance abuse, etc.)
- Create economies of scale
- Ensure consistent conditions meeting federal floor
- Reduce incarceration through coordinated alternatives

### Addressing Mass Incarceration

Regional Federalism enables:

- Regional decarceration strategies
- Coordinated sentencing reform
- Investment in alternatives
- Democratic accountability for incarceration rates
- Equalization support for transition costs

---

## 8. Cross-Regional Issues

### Extradition When Penalties Differ

**Scenario**: Region A has death penalty, Region B doesn't. Person commits capital crime in A, flees to B.

**Resolution framework**:

1. Extradition generally required under [Article I, Section 11](../02-design/constitution/01-regional-structure.md)
2. Regions may negotiate agreements on death penalty cases
3. Extraditing region may condition on non-imposition of death penalty
4. Federal coordination ensures no "sanctuary regions" for violent offenders

### Conduct Legal in One Region, Illegal in Another

**Scenario**: Conduct legal in Region A, person crosses to Region B where it's illegal.

**Resolution framework**:

1. Generally, law of jurisdiction where conduct occurs applies
2. Regions cannot prosecute conduct occurring entirely in another Region
3. Border areas may have coordinated enforcement
4. Federal anti-coercion rule prevents punitive treatment of residents based on home Region's policies

### Criminal Records Across Regions

Regional cooperation enables:

- Unified regional records systems
- Inter-regional records sharing
- Expungement/sealing portability
- Employment background check standards

### Parole and Probation Transfer

Interstate Compact on Adult Offender Supervision adapted for Regions:

- Transfer of supervision between Regions
- Consistent violation standards
- Coordinated revocation procedures
- Rights protections during transfer

---

## 9. Restorative and Alternative Justice

### Regional Innovation

Regional Federalism enables experimentation:

- Drug courts and treatment alternatives
- Mental health diversion programs
- Veterans treatment courts
- Restorative justice pilots
- Community-based alternatives to incarceration

### Tribal Justice Integration

Under [Article XX, Section 3](../02-design/constitution/06-supremacy.md):

- Tribal courts retain jurisdiction per federal law
- Regions may partner with Tribal justice systems
- Restorative practices from Tribal traditions (with consent)
- Coordination on cross-jurisdictional cases

### Victim Services

Regional coordination improves:

- Victim compensation programs
- Notification systems
- Restitution collection
- Support services across state lines

---

## 10. Implementation Considerations

### Transition

Criminal justice transition under Regional Federalism would require:

- Phased development of regional sentencing guidelines
- Gradual transfer of corrections to regional management
- Maintenance of local policing with regional standards
- Federal monitoring during transition
- Protection of pending cases and sentences

### Equalization

Fiscal equalization ([Article X, Section 3](../02-design/constitution/04-fiscal-system.md)) ensures:

- All Regions can fund adequate defense counsel
- Lower-income Regions can implement alternatives to incarceration
- Decarceration transitions are financially supported
- No Region forced into mass incarceration by fiscal constraints

### Variation and Experimentation

Regional Federalism enables:

- Different Regions trying different approaches
- Evidence accumulation across regional experiments
- Adaptation to regional conditions and preferences
- Innovation without federal permission

### Federal Floors Prevent

- Rights protections below constitutional minimum
- Racial discrimination in enforcement
- Conditions of confinement violating Eighth Amendment
- Denial of effective counsel
- Excessive pretrial detention

### Addressing Racial Disparities

Regional structures can address disparities through:

- Regional data collection and transparency
- Accountability for disparate outcomes
- Standardized policies reducing discretion
- Federal civil rights enforcement
- Democratic accountability for regional disparities

---

## Summary

Regional Federalism transforms criminal justice governance by:

1. **Establishing rights floors**: Federal minimums ensure baseline protections everywhere
2. **Enabling regional consistency**: Harmonized codes within regions reduce arbitrary geographic variation
3. **Facilitating coordination**: Regional approach addresses cross-border crime and law enforcement
4. **Allowing democratic choice**: Regions can choose rehabilitative, deterrence, restorative, or hybrid models
5. **Supporting reform**: Equalization enables decarceration without fiscal barriers

Criminal justice under Regional Federalism represents the system's approach applied to a critical policy domain:

> **Federal floors for constitutional rights.
> Regional authority for criminal justice policy and administration.
> Democratic accountability at the scale matching the problem.**
