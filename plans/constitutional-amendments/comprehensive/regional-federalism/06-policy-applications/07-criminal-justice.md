# Criminal Justice Under Regional Federalism

## Status: Outline Only

This document outlines how criminal justice would function under Regional Federalism. Full analysis to be developed.

## The Challenge

Criminal justice varies dramatically across America:

- Sentencing for same crime varies by orders of magnitude
- Some states have death penalty, others abolished
- Policing models range from community to militarized
- Mass incarceration concentrated in certain regions
- Bail and pretrial detention systems vary
- Prosecutor discretion creates arbitrary outcomes

## Regional Federalism Approach

### Federal Authority (retained)

- Federal crimes (limited enumerated areas)
- Constitutional rights floors (4th, 5th, 6th, 8th Amendments)
- Interstate fugitive extradition
- Federal prison system
- Civil rights enforcement

### Regional Authority (primary)

- Criminal code definitions
- Sentencing frameworks
- Death penalty decisions
- Policing standards and oversight
- Prosecution policies
- Prison and corrections systems
- Bail and pretrial detention

### State/Local Authority

- Local policing (within regional standards)
- County prosecution (within regional frameworks)
- Local courts

### Rights Floors

- Jury trial rights
- Right to counsel
- Prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment
- Due process requirements
- Non-discrimination in enforcement

## Key Questions to Research

### Sentencing Variation

- How much regional variation is acceptable?
- Should there be federal sentencing floors or ceilings?
- How do disparities affect equal protection?
- What happens when someone commits crime in multiple regions?

### Death Penalty

- Can regions abolish or retain independently?
- What federal role in capital punishment?
- How do appeals work across regions?

### Policing

- Should there be federal policing standards?
- How do regional standards interact with local control?
- What's the regional role in police misconduct?
- How does qualified immunity work regionally?

### Incarceration

- How do prison systems work regionally?
- Can regions share facilities?
- What's the federal role in prison conditions?
- How do interstate transfers work?

### Cross-Regional Issues

- Extradition when penalties differ dramatically
- Prosecution for conduct legal in defendant's home region
- Transfer of probation/parole
- Criminal records across regions

## Comparative Models to Study

- **Germany**: Länder criminal justice with federal coordination
- **Australia**: State criminal law with federal oversight
- **Canada**: Provincial variation with Charter floors
- **EU**: Member state variation with rights framework

## Scenarios to Analyze

1. **Region A has death penalty, Region B doesn't** - Extradition for capital crime?
2. **Marijuana legal in Region A, illegal in Region B** - Cross-border possession?
3. **Different sentencing** - Same crime, 5 years vs 20 years in different regions
4. **Police misconduct** - Federal floor or regional variation?
5. **Mass incarceration** - Can regional policy reduce without federal mandate?
