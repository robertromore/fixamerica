## Relationship to Other Folders

### vs. `/proposals/`

| This Folder (`06-policy-applications/`) | `/proposals/` |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------|
| **Conceptual analysis** — "Why and how" | **Statutory drafts** — "What exactly" |
| Essays explaining the framework | Legal text with sections and subsections |
| Strategic vision | Operational implementation |

**These folders are complementary, not duplicative.**

For each policy area analyzed here, there is typically a corresponding statutory proposal in `/proposals/` that provides the actual implementing legislation.
