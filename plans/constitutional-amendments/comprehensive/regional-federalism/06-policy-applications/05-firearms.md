## The Challenge

Firearms policy is among the most divisive issues in American politics:

- Second Amendment interpreted to guarantee individual right
- Massive regional variation in gun culture and preferences
- Federal legislation blocked by polarization
- State laws undermined by cross-border trafficking
- Urban/rural divide doesn't map to state boundaries
- No mechanism for meaningful regional variation

## Regional Federalism Approach

### Federal Authority (retained)

- Second Amendment floor (some right to keep arms)
- Interstate trafficking enforcement
- Federal firearms licensing (manufacturers, dealers)
- National background check system infrastructure
- Military weapons restrictions

### Regional Authority (new)

- Regulation above federal floor
- Concealed/open carry rules
- Assault weapons definitions and restrictions
- Magazine capacity limits
- Waiting periods and purchase limits
- Red flag/ERPO procedures
- Storage and safety requirements

### Rights Floors

- Right to keep firearms for self-defense in home
- Due process for any restrictions
- Non-discriminatory enforcement
- Appeal rights for denied purchases

## Key Questions to Research

### Constitutional Architecture

- How does regional variation interact with Second Amendment?
- What's the federal floor vs regional ceiling framework?
- Can regions effectively ban categories of weapons?
- How does *Bruen* (2022) affect regional authority?

### Cross-Border Issues

- How do firearms legally purchased in one region work in another?
- What border enforcement exists for prohibited weapons?
- How do concealed carry permits work across regions?
- What prevents regions from being "source states" for trafficking?

### Enforcement Mechanics

- Who enforces regional firearms laws?
- How do federal and regional enforcement interact?
- What databases and information sharing exist?

### Urban/Rural Within Regions

- Can states or localities within regions have stricter rules?
- How does regional policy balance urban and rural preferences?
- What's the subsidiarity principle for firearms?

## Comparative Models to Study

- **Switzerland**: High ownership with strong regulation
- **Canada**: Provincial variation within federal framework
- **Australia**: State variation post-1996 reforms
- **EU**: Member state variation within framework directive

## Scenarios to Analyze

1. **Pacific Region bans assault weapons** - Constitutional? Enforceable?
2. **Great Plains Region allows permitless carry** - Effect on neighboring regions?
3. **Cross-regional travel** - What happens to legally owned weapons?
4. **Red flag laws** - Regional variation in procedures?
5. **Trafficking** - How does enforcement work when legal status differs?

## Political Feasibility

This may be the hardest policy domain for regional variation because:

- Second Amendment jurisprudence is nationalized
- Gun rights advocates resist any "patchwork"
- Gun control advocates want national standards
- Neither side may accept regional solution

Research whether regional variation is politically viable or whether firearms must remain primarily federal.
