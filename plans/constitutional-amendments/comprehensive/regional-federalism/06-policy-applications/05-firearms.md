# Firearms Policy Under Regional Federalism

## How Regional Government Transforms Firearms Governance

> **Purpose of this document:**
> To describe how the Regional Federal constitutional system would restructure firearms governance, enabling regional variation above constitutional floors while addressing cross-border trafficking and respecting Second Amendment rights.

Firearms policy exemplifies deep regional and cultural divisions. Regional Federalism provides a framework for meaningful regional variation while maintaining federal authority over interstate trafficking and establishing rights floors grounded in Second Amendment jurisprudence.

## 1. Current Federal-State Firearms Structure

The current system creates a patchwork:

- **Federal**: Gun Control Act (dealers, prohibited persons), NFA (machine guns, silencers), Brady Act (background checks), ATF enforcement
- **State**: Concealed carry, assault weapons bans, waiting periods, red flag laws
- **Local**: Some cities have additional restrictions (often preempted by state law)

This fragmentation creates:

- Guns purchased legally in one state trafficked to another
- No mechanism for regional enforcement
- State preemption blocking local responses to urban violence
- Constitutional litigation over every significant regulation

---

## 2. Problems Regional Federalism Addresses

### Scale Mismatch

States are too small for:

- Addressing trafficking across state lines
- Creating coherent regional enforcement
- Matching regulation to actual regional gun culture

### Constitutional Uncertainty

- Post-*Bruen* (2022), every regulation faces litigation
- No stable framework for permissible restrictions
- States cannot know what will survive judicial review

### Urban/Rural Divide

- State boundaries don't match urban/rural divide
- Rural areas in regulated states feel restricted
- Urban areas in permissive states cannot protect residents

---

## 3. Firearms Powers Under Regional Federalism

### Federal Powers (Retained)

Federal authority establishes constitutional floor and national systems:

- **Second Amendment enforcement**: Constitutional floor for right to keep arms
- **Interstate trafficking**: Federal prosecution for illegal cross-regional sales
- **Federal licensing**: Manufacturer and dealer licensing (FFL system)
- **Background check infrastructure**: NICS system operation
- **Prohibited persons categories**: Federal list (felons, domestic violence, etc.)
- **Military weapons**: NFA restrictions on machine guns, explosives

### Regional Powers (Primary Above Floor)

Regions control regulation above federal floor:

- **Concealed/open carry**: Permit requirements, permitless carry, restrictions
- **Assault weapons**: Definitions and restrictions (or no restrictions)
- **Magazine capacity**: Limits (or no limits)
- **Waiting periods**: Duration requirements
- **Purchase limits**: Frequency restrictions
- **Red flag/ERPO**: Procedures for emergency risk orders
- **Storage requirements**: Safe storage mandates
- **Age restrictions**: Minimum ages above federal floor (18/21)
- **Training requirements**: Mandatory training for permits

### State/Local Authority

States and localities retain:

- Local implementation of regional standards
- Additional restrictions where regional law permits
- Enforcement coordination with regional agencies

---

## 4. Second Amendment and Rights Floors

### Constitutional Floor (Article III Rights)

The Regional Federal Constitution preserves Second Amendment rights:

- **Right to keep**: Firearms for self-defense in the home protected
- **Due process**: Any restriction requires due process
- **Non-discrimination**: Enforcement must be non-discriminatory
- **Appeal rights**: Denied purchases have appeal mechanism

### Post-*Bruen* Framework

*Bruen* (2022) requires regulations be consistent with historical tradition:

- Regional regulations must satisfy *Bruen* standard
- Federal courts review regional laws against constitutional floor
- Regions cannot eliminate Second Amendment rights
- Regions can regulate manner, carrying, and categories above floor

### What Regions Cannot Do

- Ban all firearms
- Eliminate home self-defense right
- Deny due process for restrictions
- Discriminate in licensing
- Create de facto prohibition through regulation

### What Regions Can Do

- Require permits for concealed carry (with shall-issue standards)
- Restrict carrying in sensitive places
- Regulate commercial sales above federal requirements
- Establish training and safety requirements
- Limit magazine capacity and weapon features
- Create red flag procedures with due process

---

## 5. Regional Regulatory Options

### Option A: Permissive Regulation

Region emphasizes Second Amendment rights:

- Constitutional carry (no permit required)
- No assault weapons restrictions
- No magazine limits
- No waiting periods beyond NICS check
- Minimal red flag procedures
- Preemption of local restrictions

### Option B: Moderate Regulation

Region balances rights and public safety:

- Shall-issue concealed carry permits
- No assault weapons ban
- Optional waiting periods (3-day)
- Red flag procedures with due process
- Training encouraged but not mandated
- Some local authority permitted

### Option C: Comprehensive Regulation

Region emphasizes public safety regulation:

- Shall-issue permits with training requirement
- Assault weapons restrictions
- Magazine capacity limits (10-15 rounds)
- Waiting periods (7-10 days)
- Robust red flag procedures
- Safe storage requirements
- Local authority for additional restrictions

### Option D: Strict Regulation

Region maximizes public safety regulation within constitutional limits:

- May-issue permits (but must issue to qualified applicants per *Bruen*)
- Assault weapons ban with registration
- Magazine limits (10 rounds)
- Extended waiting periods (14 days)
- Comprehensive red flag with multiple pathways
- Mandatory safe storage
- Extensive training requirements
- Registration requirements

## 6. Cross-Regional Issues

### Travel with Firearms

Person traveling between regions with different laws:

- Unloaded, locked firearms in transit protected (FOPA continuation)
- Cannot carry in manner prohibited in destination region
- Must comply with destination region's laws upon arrival
- No prosecution for mere transit

### Purchases Across Regional Lines

- Purchases at licensed dealers: Follow purchaser's home region rules
- Private sales: Prohibited across regional lines
- Online sales: Must ship to FFL in purchaser's region

### Trafficking Enforcement

Federal-regional coordination on trafficking:

- Federal prosecution for interstate/interregional trafficking
- Regional reporting requirements for multiple purchases
- Federal-regional task forces for trafficking patterns
- Enhanced penalties for cross-regional trafficking

### Permits and Reciprocity

- Regions may establish reciprocity agreements
- No region required to honor another region's permits
- Federal law does not mandate reciprocity
- Travel protection distinct from carry reciprocity

---

## 7. Enforcement Architecture

### Federal Enforcement (ATF)

- Federal Firearms License (FFL) compliance
- Interstate/interregional trafficking
- Prohibited persons violations
- NFA violations (machine guns, silencers)
- Coordination with regional authorities

### Regional Enforcement

Regional authorities enforce regional laws:

- Permit issuance and revocation
- Assault weapons compliance
- Storage requirement violations
- Red flag order execution
- Regional dealer compliance above federal floor

### Coordination

Federal-regional coordination through:

- Joint task forces on trafficking
- Shared data systems (with privacy protections)
- Clear jurisdictional protocols
- Prosecution coordination

---

## 8. Dealer and Manufacturer Regulation

### Federal Licensing (Retained)

All dealers and manufacturers require federal license:

- FFL system continues
- ATF inspection authority
- Federal record-keeping requirements
- Interstate commerce regulation

### Regional Requirements

Regions may impose additional requirements:

- Regional dealer licensing
- Additional record-keeping
- Security requirements for dealers
- Inspection authority above federal minimum
- Local zoning authority for gun stores

### Manufacturer Regulation

- Federal safety standards
- Regional may require additional safety features
- Microstamping or ballistic identification (regional option)
- Marketing restrictions (regional authority)

---

## 9. Data Systems and Background Checks

### NICS System (Federal)

National Instant Criminal Background Check System continues:

- Federal operation and standards
- Prohibited person categories federal
- Response time requirements
- Appeal procedures

### Regional Enhancements

Regions may enhance above NICS:

- Point-of-sale permits requiring additional check
- Waiting periods for additional investigation
- State/regional records integrated with NICS
- Enhanced reporting requirements

### Registry Questions

- Federal registry prohibited by current law
- Regions may require registration (constitutional questions)
- Dealer records provide de facto tracing capability
- *Bruen* may limit registry requirements

---

## 10. Implementation Considerations

### Constitutional Litigation

Expect constitutional challenges to:

- Regional assault weapons bans
- Regional magazine limits
- Regional permit requirements
- Regional registration schemes

Regional laws must be drafted to survive *Bruen* analysis.

### Political Feasibility

Firearms policy is among most divisive issues:

- Gun rights advocates may resist any regional variation
- Gun safety advocates may want national standards
- Regional Federalism offers compromise: floor + variation

### Equalization

Fiscal equalization ensures all regions can fund:

- Enforcement of regional standards
- Background check systems
- Data system integration

### Transition

During transition to regional system:

- Current state laws remain effective
- Regional consolidation of enforcement
- Federal-regional coordination development
- Data system integration

---

## Summary

Regional Federalism transforms firearms policy by:

1. **Establishing constitutional floor**: Second Amendment rights protected everywhere
2. **Enabling regional variation**: Regions regulate above floor reflecting regional preferences
3. **Addressing trafficking**: Federal enforcement of cross-regional trafficking
4. **Clarifying enforcement**: Federal for trafficking, regional for regulation above floor
5. **Managing cross-regional issues**: Clear rules for travel, purchases, reciprocity

> **Federal authority for constitutional floor and trafficking.**
> **Regional authority for regulation above floor.**
> **Rights protected, variation enabled, trafficking addressed.**
