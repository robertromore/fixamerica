# Transportation Under Regional Federalism

## Status: Outline Only

This document outlines how transportation policy would function under Regional Federalism. Full analysis to be developed.

---

## The Challenge

Transportation governance is poorly matched to actual travel patterns:

- Metropolitan areas cross state lines
- Interstate highway system federally funded but state-managed
- No mechanism for regional transit coordination
- Rail development blocked by fragmented authority
- Aviation federally controlled but airports locally run
- Climate goals require transportation transformation

## Regional Federalism Approach

### Federal Authority (retained)

- Interstate highway system (core network)
- Aviation (FAA)
- Rail safety (FRA)
- Maritime (Coast Guard)
- Vehicle safety standards (NHTSA)
- National transportation planning

### Regional Authority (new)

- Regional transit systems
- Regional highway planning
- Regional rail development
- Regional freight coordination
- Vehicle emissions standards (above federal)
- Regional transportation pricing

### State/Local Authority

- State highways
- Local transit
- Local roads
- Parking policy

## Key Questions to Research

### Regional Transit

- Can regions create integrated transit authorities?
- How do regional transit systems cross state lines?
- What's the funding mechanism for regional transit?
- How do you coordinate with local transit agencies?

### Rail

- Can regions develop high-speed rail independently?
- How does regional rail authority interact with Amtrak?
- What's the regional role in freight rail?
- How do you site regional rail corridors?

### Highways

- How do regional highways supplement federal interstates?
- Can regions implement congestion pricing?
- What's the regional role in highway maintenance?
- How do tolling systems work regionally?

### Aviation

- What regional role in airports?
- How do regional airports compete and coordinate?
- What's the regional role in air service to rural areas?

### Freight

- How do regions coordinate freight movement?
- What's the regional role in ports?
- How do regional freight corridors work?

## Comparative Models to Study

- **Germany**: Länder transportation with federal coordination
- **Canada**: Provincial transportation authority
- **EU**: Trans-European Networks with member state implementation
- **Switzerland**: Integrated national/cantonal transit

## Scenarios to Analyze

1. **Regional transit** - Northeast Corridor becomes regional transit authority
2. **High-speed rail** - Pacific Region develops California-Oregon-Washington HSR
3. **Congestion pricing** - Midwest Region implements regional highway pricing
4. **Rural service** - How do rural areas within regions get transit?
5. **Cross-regional travel** - How do systems coordinate at regional borders?

## Critical Design Questions

### Scale Matching

- Do regions match actual transportation networks?
- How do metropolitan areas that cross regional boundaries work?
- What's the right level for different transportation decisions?

### Funding

- How do regional transportation systems get funded?
- What's the federal contribution vs regional contribution?
- How does equalization work for transportation?

### Integration

- How do regional systems integrate with national systems?
- What standards ensure interoperability?
- How do you prevent balkanization?
