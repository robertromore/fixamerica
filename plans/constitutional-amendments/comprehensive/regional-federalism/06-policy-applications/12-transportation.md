Transportation exemplifies where current boundaries create coordination challenges: metropolitan areas cross state lines, rail corridors span multiple states, freight networks operate regionally. Regional Federalism matches governance to these realities while preserving federal authority over national networks.

## 1. Current Federal-State Transportation Structure

The current system divides transportation authority inconsistently:

- **Federal**: Interstate highways, aviation (FAA), rail safety (FRA), vehicle standards (NHTSA), maritime (Coast Guard/MARAD)
- **State**: State highways, driver licensing, vehicle registration, state transit agencies
- **Local**: Local roads, local transit, land use affecting transportation
- **Regional**: Ad hoc Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) with advisory authority only

This fragmentation creates:

- Metropolitan transit systems blocked by state boundaries
- Rail development stalled by multi-state jurisdictional conflicts
- No mechanism for regional congestion pricing
- Highway funding tied to state rather than regional needs
- Incompatible toll systems across state lines
- Transit agencies competing rather than coordinating

### Current Funding Structure

| Level | Source | Use |
|-------|--------|-----|
| Federal | Gas tax, general fund | Interstate, grants to states |
| State | Gas tax, fees | State highways, local aid |
| Local | Property/sales tax | Local transit, roads |
| Regional | Limited compact authority | Joint projects only |

## 2. Problems Regional Federalism Addresses

### Scale Mismatch

States are too small for:

- **Metropolitan coordination**: DC Metro serves 3 jurisdictions with chronic governance conflicts; NYC Metro spans parts of 3 states with no unified authority
- **Interstate rail corridors**: Northeast Corridor runs through 8 states; California HSR requires coordination with Nevada, Arizona
- **Regional freight networks**: Port of LA/Long Beach serves entire Southwest but governance is local
- **Air quality management**: Vehicle emissions cross state lines daily

### Coordination Failures

Current failures include:

- **DC Metro (WMATA)**: Three-jurisdiction funding disputes create chronic underfunding and governance deadlock
- **Northeast Corridor**: Eight states plus Amtrak cannot agree on upgrades; NEC Commission is advisory only
- **Toll interoperability**: E-ZPass works across states but pricing and revenue allocation remain fragmented
- **Congestion pricing**: No regional authority to implement market-based traffic management

### Funding Fragmentation

- Highway Trust Fund declining as gas tax erodes
- States compete for federal grants rather than coordinate
- No mechanism for regional revenue pooling
- Transit funding depends on local referenda that fail at arbitrary boundaries

## 3. Transportation Powers Under Regional Federalism

### Federal Powers (Enumerated)

Federal authority retained over:

- **Interstate highway system**: National network planning, standards, core funding
- **Aviation**: FAA air traffic control, safety certification, airspace
- **Rail safety**: FRA safety regulations, grade crossing standards
- **Vehicle safety**: NHTSA safety standards (floor)
- **Maritime**: Coast Guard safety, port security
- **National corridors**: Designated corridors of national significance
- **Environmental floors**: EPA emissions standards (floor)

### Regional Powers (Primary)

Regions control:

- **Regional transit systems**: Unified governance for metropolitan transit
- **Regional rail development**: Planning, funding, operation of regional corridors
- **Congestion management**: Regional pricing, demand management
- **Regional airport coordination**: System planning, ground access
- **Highway supplements**: Regional expressways beyond federal system
- **Vehicle emissions**: Standards above federal floor (California-style authority)
- **Tolling and pricing**: Regional toll systems, congestion charges
- **Transit funding**: Regional revenue authority for transit

### State/Local Authority

States and localities retain:

- Local road construction and maintenance
- Driver licensing (within regional framework)
- Land use decisions affecting transportation
- Local transit operations (within regional system)
- Parking policy and pricing
- Local street design standards

### Constitutional Provisions

- [Article I, Section 8](../02-design/constitution/01-regional-structure.md) - Freedom of movement guarantees no barriers to travel
- [Article I, Section 6](../02-design/constitution/01-regional-structure.md) - Right of transit and non-blockade (supporting national common market)
- [Article I, Section 5](../02-design/constitution/01-regional-structure.md) - Inter-regional cooperation enables joint projects

## 4. Regional Transit Systems

### Regional Approach Options

Regions have discretion in how actively they coordinate transit systems:

**Option A: State-Led Coordination**

Regions defer to state and local transit agencies:

- Existing state DOTs and transit agencies continue primary roles
- Regional role limited to data sharing and voluntary coordination
- No mandatory regional transit authority
- Local control over funding and operations

**Option B: Unified Regional Governance**

Regions establish unified transit authorities for metropolitan areas (described below):

- Single governance structure for cross-state metros
- Regional funding authority
- Coordinated planning and operations

### Unified Governance Opportunity (Option B)

Regional Federalism enables unified transit governance for metropolitan areas:

**Northeast Region:**

- Unified Northeast transit authority coordinating NYC MTA, NJ Transit, SEPTA, MBTA
- Regional fare integration and service coordination
- Capital investment planning across traditional state boundaries
- Single governance structure replacing competing agencies

**Great Lakes/Midwest Region:**

- Chicago metro integration across IL/IN/WI portions of metro area
- Detroit-Windsor international coordination
- Cleveland-Akron-Canton corridor coordination

**Southeast Region:**

- DC Metro (WMATA) converted to true regional authority with dedicated funding
- Atlanta MARTA expansion authority across metro counties
- Charlotte-Raleigh corridor coordination

**Pacific Region:**

- Bay Area transit integration (BART, Muni, Caltrain, VTA unified)
- LA Metro with unified regional governance
- Portland-Seattle-Vancouver corridor

### Governance Structure

Regional transit authorities would have:

- **Unified governance**: Single board with regional representation (not multi-state compact requiring unanimous consent)
- **Regional funding authority**: Dedicated revenue sources (regional sales tax, payroll tax, congestion charges)
- **Capital planning**: Multi-year capital investment plans not subject to annual state budget politics
- **Operating authority**: Direct operation or contracted service provision
- **Land use coordination**: Integration with regional land use planning

### Funding Options

| Source | Authority | Example Rate |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| Regional sales tax | Regional government | 0.5-1.0% |
| Employer payroll tax | Regional government | 0.5-1.5% |
| Congestion charges | Regional government | Variable |
| Fare revenue | Transit authority | Cost recovery |
| Federal grants | Federal allocation | Formula + competitive |

## 5. Highways and Roads

### Federal Interstate System

Core interstate network remains federal:

- National network designation
- Federal funding and standards
- Interstate commerce protection
- National defense highway system

### Regional Highway Authority

Regions control highways beyond federal system:

**Regional Expressways:**

- Highways of regional significance not in federal system
- Regional funding and construction authority
- Standards above federal minimums where appropriate

**Congestion Pricing:**

- Regional authority to implement congestion pricing
- Variable tolling on regional expressways
- Cordon pricing for metropolitan centers
- Revenue dedicated to regional transportation

**Toll Systems:**

- Unified regional toll systems
- Interoperability across regions (federal requirement)
- Regional toll revenue for regional priorities
- Dynamic pricing authority

### Example: Regional Highway Coordination

**Current Problem:** I-95 corridor managed by eight separate state DOTs with different priorities, funding levels, and tolling approaches.

**Regional Solution:** Northeast Region highway authority coordinates:

- Unified corridor management
- Consistent tolling and pricing
- Coordinated construction scheduling
- Regional revenue pooling for improvements

- Northeast Corridor upgrades under Northeast Region

**Commuter Rail:**

- Regional commuter systems unified under regional authority
- Metro-North, LIRR, NJ Transit coordinated as single system
- Metra and South Shore Line integrated
- Caltrain, Metrolink coordinated

**Regional Corridors:**

- State-supported Amtrak routes become regional
- Pacific Surfliner, Cascades, Piedmont under regional authority
- Regional funding and service decisions
- Coordination with national network

### Amtrak and National Network

Federal authority over long-distance routes:

- Long-distance routes remain federally supported
- National network connectivity maintained
- Regional corridors transferred to regional authority
- Equipment sharing and coordination through inter-regional agreements

### Federal-Regional Coordination

| Service Type | Authority | Funding | Example |
|--------------|-----------|---------|---------|
