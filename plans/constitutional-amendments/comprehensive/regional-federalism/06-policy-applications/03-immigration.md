## Status: Outline Only

This document outlines how immigration policy would function under Regional Federalism. Full analysis to be developed.

## The Challenge

Immigration policy under current federalism creates conflict:

- Federal government has exclusive authority but enforcement varies
- Border states bear disproportionate costs
- Interior states have different labor market needs
- Sanctuary city conflicts pit local against federal authority
- No mechanism for regional variation in visa allocation
- Polarization prevents federal legislative action

## Regional Federalism Approach

### Federal Authority (retained)

- Border control and enforcement
- Citizenship and naturalization
- Refugee and asylum determination
- National security screening
- Treaty obligations

### Regional Authority (new)

- Regional visa allocation preferences
- Integration program design
- Labor market immigration coordination
- State/local cooperation policies
- Regional refugee resettlement

### Rights Floors

- Due process for all persons
- Family unity protections
- Anti-discrimination requirements
- Minimum detention standards

## Key Questions to Research

### Allocation Mechanics

- How would regional visa preferences work within federal quotas?
- Could regions sponsor additional visas beyond federal allocation?
- How would regions coordinate on labor market needs?
- What prevents "race to the bottom" on enforcement?

### Border Region Issues

- How do border regions (Southwest, Pacific) handle unique costs?
- Should border security costs be federally funded or regionally shared?
- How does regional variation affect border enforcement?

### Interior Enforcement

- Can regions opt out of interior enforcement cooperation?
- How do sanctuary policies interact with regional authority?
- What happens when someone moves between regions with different policies?

### Integration Programs

- How would language training, job placement vary by region?
- Would citizenship pathways differ regionally?
- How do education and social services for immigrants work?

### Economic Analysis

- How does regional immigration variation affect labor markets?
- What prevents regions from "exporting" immigration costs to neighbors?
- How do equalization transfers account for immigration costs/benefits?

## Comparative Models to Study

- **Canada**: Provincial Nominee Program allows provinces to select immigrants
- **Australia**: State-sponsored visa categories
- **Germany**: Länder variation in refugee integration
- **EU**: Member state variation within Schengen framework
