> **Purpose of this document:**
> To describe how the Regional Federal constitutional system would restructure immigration governance, maintaining federal authority over borders and citizenship while enabling regional input on labor migration and integration.

Immigration remains constitutionally federal, but Regional Federalism creates mechanisms for regional voice in labor market migration and integration programs while preserving national control over borders and citizenship.

## 1. Current Federal Immigration Structure

Immigration is constitutionally federal:

- **Federal**: Border control, visas, citizenship, deportation
- **State/Local**: Limited cooperation role, sanctuary policies

Current conflicts:

- Federal enforcement varies by administration
- Border states bear disproportionate costs
- Sanctuary city conflicts
- No mechanism for regional labor market input

---

## 2. Problems Regional Federalism Addresses

### Labor Market Mismatch

- Visa allocation doesn't reflect regional labor needs
- Agricultural regions need different immigration than tech regions
- No regional voice in labor migration priorities

### Integration Fragmentation

- Integration services vary dramatically by locality
- No regional coordination on language, workforce, services

### Cost Distribution

- Border regions bear enforcement costs
- Interior regions may not contribute proportionally

---

## 3. Immigration Powers Under Regional Federalism

### Federal Powers (Exclusive — Retained)

Federal government retains exclusive authority over:

- Border control and enforcement
- Visa issuance and categories
- Citizenship and naturalization
- Deportation proceedings
- Refugee and asylum determination
- National security screening
- Treaty obligations

### Regional Input (New — Advisory)

Regions would have advisory input on:

- Labor migration priorities (regional needs assessment)
- Visa allocation recommendations
- Integration program design
- Workforce immigration coordination

### Regional Authority (Implementation)

Regions would control:

- Integration program administration
- Language services
- Workforce training for immigrants
- Refugee resettlement coordination
- Driver's licenses and state identification

---

## 4. Regional Labor Migration Input

### Regional Needs Assessment

Regions would assess labor market needs:

- Industries with labor shortages
- Skills gaps in regional workforce
- Seasonal and agricultural labor needs
- Professional category needs

### Advisory Role

Regions provide recommendations to federal system:

- Priority categories for regional labor needs
- Supporting evidence from regional employers
- Integration capacity assessment
- Similar to Canadian Provincial Nominee Program concept (but advisory, not binding)

### Federal Decision

Final visa allocation remains federal:

- National quotas set by Congress
- Federal agencies issue visas
- Regions cannot independently admit immigrants
- Regional input informs but doesn't control

---

## 5. Integration Programs

### Regional Administration

Regions would design and administer integration programs:

**Language Services**:

- English language instruction
- Interpreter services
- Multilingual government services

**Workforce Integration**:

- Credential recognition processes
- Job placement services
- Occupational training
- Employer partnerships

**Community Integration**:

- Citizenship preparation
- Civic education
- Cultural orientation
- Social services coordination

### Federal Funding

- Federal funding supports integration
- Formula based on immigrant population
- Regional flexibility in program design
- Accountability for outcomes

### Regional Variation

Different regions may emphasize:

- Intensive language programs vs. workplace integration
- Centralized services vs. community-based
- Different timelines and intensity

---

## 6. Border Region Considerations

### Cost Sharing

Border enforcement costs addressed through:

- Federal responsibility for border security
- Equalization accounting for border costs
- Regional coordination on border communities

### Border Region Authority

Border regions (Southwest, Pacific) have:

- Input on local enforcement cooperation
- Regional processing center coordination
- Cross-border community programs
- Economic development in border areas

### Federal Primacy

Despite regional input:

- Federal government controls border
- ICE/CBP remain federal agencies
- Prosecution for immigration crimes is federal
- Regions cannot independently open or close borders

---

## 7. Interior Enforcement

### Cooperation Policies

Regions decide cooperation level with federal enforcement:

- **Full cooperation**: Regional/state law enforcement assists ICE
- **Limited cooperation**: Cooperation only for criminal matters
- **Minimal cooperation**: Constitutional minimum only

### Constitutional Limits

Regardless of regional policy:

- Federal agents can operate in all regions
- No region can prohibit federal enforcement
- No region can independently deport
- Constitutional requirements apply everywhere

### Anti-Coercion Protection

[Article X, Section 4](../02-design/constitution/04-fiscal-system.md) (Anti-Coercion Rule):

- Federal government cannot withhold equalization to coerce cooperation
- Immigration enforcement cooperation is regional policy choice
- No conditional funding based on sanctuary status

---

## 8. Rights Floors

### Constitutional Protections

All persons regardless of immigration status:

- Due process in all proceedings
- Protection from unreasonable searches
- Access to courts
- Protection from cruel treatment

### Federal Minimums

Federal law establishes minimums:

- Detention standards
- Access to counsel rights
- Family unity considerations
- Humanitarian protections

### Regional Enhancement

Regions may exceed federal protections:

- Additional legal services
- Higher detention standards
- More generous family policies
- Enhanced humanitarian programs

---

## 9. Cross-Regional Movement

### Freedom of Movement

[Article I, Section 8](../02-design/constitution/01-regional-structure.md) guarantees:

- Lawful immigrants can move freely between Regions
- No regional barriers to movement
- Benefits portability for legal residents

### Status Consistency

- Immigration status is national, not regional
- Legal status in one Region means legal everywhere
- No regional variation in legal status itself

### Integration Service Transfer

When immigrants move between Regions:

- Service records transfer
- No loss of progress in programs
- Coordination on ongoing cases

---

## 10. Implementation Considerations

### Transition

- Phased development of regional input mechanisms
- Gradual transfer of integration programs
- Coordination with existing state programs
- Federal oversight during transition

### Equalization

Fiscal equalization ensures:

- All Regions can fund integration programs
- Border costs accounted for
- No Region disadvantaged by immigrant population

### Political Feasibility

Immigration remains federal because:

- Constitutional structure requires it
- National security concerns
- Border control is inherently national
- Citizenship must be uniform

Regional Federalism adds:

- Regional voice in labor migration
- Regional integration program authority
- Regional cooperation policy choice

---

## Summary

Regional Federalism affects immigration by:

1. **Preserving federal control**: Borders, visas, citizenship remain federal
2. **Adding regional input**: Labor market needs inform federal decisions
3. **Enabling regional integration**: Regions design integration programs
4. **Protecting cooperation choice**: Regions decide interior enforcement cooperation
5. **Ensuring rights floors**: Constitutional protections apply everywhere

> **Federal authority for borders and citizenship.
> Regional input on labor migration priorities.
> Regional administration of integration programs.
> Rights floors protecting all persons.**
