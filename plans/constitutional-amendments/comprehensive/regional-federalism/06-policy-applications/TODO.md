## Content Development Priority

### Tier 1 - Highest Priority

These topics best demonstrate Regional Federalism's value:

- [ ] **08-climate-environment.md** - Explicit regional authority (air quality, watersheds); demonstrates emissions trading at regional scale; shows federal floors + regional enhancement

- [ ] **07-criminal-justice.md** - Shows rights floors + state retained authority balance; addresses mass incarceration through federal minimums; demonstrates subsidiarity in practice

- [ ] **01-healthcare.md** - Complex multi-level governance; demonstrates equalization and portability

### Tier 2 - High Priority

- [ ] **12-transportation.md** - Transportation corridors explicitly regional (Article I); concrete demonstration of regional administration

- [ ] **11-labor-employment.md** - Regional minimum wage above federal floors; shows cost-of-living variation with coordinated standards

- [ ] **09-education.md** - Demonstrates subsidiarity: state exclusive for curriculum; regional for credential portability; federal for funding floors

### Tier 3 - Standard Priority

- [ ] **02-housing.md** - Regional coordination on affordability; shows federal floors with regional variation
- [ ] **03-immigration.md** - Federal/regional division of authority; regional labor market allocation
- [ ] **04-drug-policy.md** - Shows state experimentation within federal floors
- [ ] **05-firearms.md** - Demonstrates rights floors with state variation
- [ ] **06-reproductive-rights.md** - Shows floors-not-ceilings in contested domain
- [ ] **10-energy.md** - Regional grid coordination; shows interstate infrastructure
- [ ] **13-social-safety-net.md** - Equalization in practice; regional variation within federal minimums

## Selection Criteria

Policy applications are prioritized by:

1. **Public salience** - Issues people care deeply about
2. **Constitutional demonstration value** - How well it shows framework features
3. **Current dysfunction severity** - How broken the current system is
4. **Clarity of regional fit** - How obviously regional scale helps

## Content Requirements

Each policy application should include:

1. **The Challenge** - Current system dysfunction
2. **Regional Federalism Approach** - Authority allocation (Federal/Regional/State)
3. **Constitutional Provisions** - Relevant articles and sections
4. **Implementation** - How the framework would work in practice
5. **Regional Variation Examples** - How different regions might approach the issue
6. **Advantages Over Current System** - Concrete benefits
7. **Potential Concerns** - Challenges and how the framework addresses them
