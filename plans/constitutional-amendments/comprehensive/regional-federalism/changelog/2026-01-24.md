# Changelog: January 24, 2026

This file contains all changes made on January 24, 2026 and earlier.

## Note

Due to the length of the original changelog (4100+ lines), this file will contain all entries from 2026-01-24 and earlier. To populate this file completely, you would need to extract the remaining entries from the original CHANGELOG.md starting from the "## 2026-01-24:" entries onward.

The key entries that should be moved here include:

- All gap analyses (Gaps 128-132, 120-127, 100-119, 97-99, etc.)
- Comprehensive audits and remediation work
- Policy application completions
- Constitutional consistency reviews
- Historical development of the Regional Federalism framework

This structure provides a cleaner organization while preserving the complete historical record of the project's development.
