## 2026-02-04: Gap 125 — Senate Treaty Blockade (Minority Veto) Resolved (Article IV Section 4-F)

One intergovernmental gap resolved through new Section 4-F (Treaty Ratification Accountability) in Article IV (Federal Governance Procedures), Section 4 (Senate Powers). Drafted via multi-LLM protocol: v1 → Round 1 review (2 reviewers, 10 findings: 3 convergent, 0 complementary, 0 contradictions, 4 single-reviewer accepted) → v2 → Round 2 review (2 reviewers, 6 findings: 0 convergent, 1 complementary, 0 contradictions, 5 single-reviewer accepted) → v3 (FINAL) → integration.

### Problem

**Gap 125 (Senate Treaty Blockade / Minority Veto):** The Senate has 21 Senators (3 per Region). Treaty ratification requires a two-thirds supermajority (14 of 21). A coalition of 8 Senators voting no — as few as 3 Regions — can block any treaty. Because Regions have equal representation regardless of population, Regions representing a small fraction of the national population can exercise a population-disproportionate veto over international commitments that bind the entire nation. Three distinct vulnerabilities: (1) ransom demand — Regions hold treaty ratification hostage to extract unrelated domestic concessions; (2) strategic sabotage — anti-internationalist Regions systematically block all treaties; (3) leveraged negotiation — minority Regions force treaty modifications favoring their interests.

### Pre-Existing Coverage

8 provisions analyzed; none addressed substantive Senate vote-blocking of treaties:

| Provision | What It Covers | What Remained Uncovered |
|-----------|----------------|------------------------|
| Art IV §4 Senate enumerated powers | Treaty ratification as exclusive function; 2/3 threshold | No override mechanism; no mandatory consideration timeline |
| Art IV §4-E(c)-(d) Coordinated Absence | Quorum manipulation during treaty votes | Only addresses quorum/absence gaming, not substantive vote-blocking |
| Art IV §4-E(e)-(f) Emergency vote guarantees | Mandatory timelines for emergency/deployment/override votes | Treaty votes not covered |
| Art IV §5(e) Senate Review | Review-but-not-veto for ordinary legislation | Precedent exists but applies only to ordinary legislation |
| Art II §19 Treaty Withdrawal | Withdrawal procedures, three-tier framework | Covers withdrawal, not ratification blockade |
| Art VI §4 One Voice Doctrine | Federal exclusivity in foreign relations | Prevents Regional freelancing; doesn't address Senate blocking |
| Art XXIII §3-4 Indigenous Treaty Protection | Treaty supremacy for indigenous treaties | Separate track; must be excluded from override |

### Solution

New Section 4-F with 6 subsections added to Article IV, Section 4:

| Subsection | Content | Key Provisions |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| §4-F(a) | Standard Ratification and Mandatory Consideration | 2/3 seated Senators for standard ratification; presidential certification triggers 120-day clock; Senate committee backstop at 180 days from signature; deemed rejection for inaction (counts toward Blockade); written rejection reasons required (missing statement = rebuttable presumption for Blockade) |
| §4-F(b) | House Proportional Override | 2/3 seated membership + 60% population dual threshold; "seated membership" defined (certified and serving, excluding vacancies); decennial census apportionment data with Clerk certification and court-ordered reapportionment fallback; 90-day House clock; 30-day Senate reconsideration window; non-self-executing for domestic law; one override attempt per treaty |
| §4-F(c) | Pre-Negotiation Consultation | Senate Foreign Relations Committee briefings; advisory input to negotiators; Regional Governor consultation for treaties affecting Regional interests; non-invalidating |
| §4-F(d) | Treaty Blockade Finding | ARB investigates after 3+ consecutive rejections within 4 years (including deemed rejections); bright-line minimum specificity standard (must reference at least one specific provision/article/clause/term); reduced 55% population threshold for 2 years; NCC judicial review limited to procedural regularity |
| §4-F(e) | Transparency and Accountability | Publication of treaty text, recorded votes, rejection statements; ARB public registry |
| §4-F(f) | Coordination | Treaty withdrawal independent; override limited to treaty ratification; §4-E quorum protections apply; indigenous treaty exclusion; Transition Freeze (absolute, not waivable; procedural deadlines tolled; 4-year Blockade lookback runs continuously; new President re-certifies upon inauguration) |

### Key Design Decisions

- **Placed as §4-F** (DD-1): Continues §4-B/§4-C/§4-D/§4-E pattern for Senate procedural protections
- **120-day mandatory consideration with deemed rejection** (DD-2): Parallels §4-B anti-silent-veto; deemed rejection (not deemed ratification) preserves affirmative consent principle
- **Dual threshold: 2/3 House + 60% population** (DD-3): Very high bar ensures override only for treaties with genuine broad support; population threshold insures against malapportionment
- **Post-rejection presidential submission** (DD-4): President decides whether to pursue override; preserves executive discretion
- **30-day Senate reconsideration** (DD-5): Preserves Senate dignity; no gaming vector (Senate can only ratify, not kill)
- **Time-based Blockade trigger: 3 within 4 years** (DD-6/DD-16): Removes original different-Presidents requirement that immunized single-term obstruction
- **Non-self-executing mandate** (DD-14): Override-ratified treaties have international force but require implementing legislation for domestic law — prevents unicameral legislation backdoor
- **"Seated membership" = certified and serving** (DD-21): "Total membership" was ambiguous; vacancy exclusion scales threshold with actual serving Members; consistent across both override thresholds
- **Senate committee backstop at 180 days** (DD-22): Prevents President from indefinitely delaying certification
- **Missing statement = rebuttable presumption** (DD-23): Closes silent-rejection evasion while preserving fairness
- **Bright-line minimum specificity** (DD-24): Must reference specific treaty content; limits ARB discretion; general opposition doesn't qualify
- **4-year lookback runs continuously** (DD-25): Not subject to Transition Freeze tolling; calendar measurement prevents accountability gaps
- **Transition Freeze is absolute** (DD-26): President-Elect has no constitutional authority; new President re-certifies upon inauguration
- **Court-ordered reapportionment fallback** (DD-27): Clerk uses court-ordered figures for affected districts if applicable

### Review Protocol Summary

**Round 1 (v1 → v2):** 10 findings from 2 reviewers. 3 convergent: C1 (time-based Blockade trigger with deemed rejections), C2 (decennial census apportionment data), C3 (objective Blockade standard). 4 single-reviewer: S1 ("except as provided" consistency), S2 (total membership prevents low-attendance), S3 (Transition Freeze), S4 (non-self-executing mandate). 5 open questions resolved by reviewer consensus.

**Round 2 (v2 → v3 FINAL):** 6 findings from 2 reviewers. 1 complementary: C4 (Transition Freeze interaction — 4-year lookback + President-Elect waiver, resolved as calendar measurement + absolute freeze). 5 single-reviewer: S5 ("seated membership" definition with vacancy alignment), S6 (Senate committee backstop at 180 days), S7 (missing-statement rebuttable presumption), S8 (bright-line minimum specificity standard), S9 (court-ordered reapportionment fallback).

## 2026-02-04: Gap 70 — Administrative Attrition via Civil Service Purge Resolved (Article V Section 6)

One institutional governance gap resolved through new Section 6 (Inter-Level Civil Service Mobility and Protection) in Article V (Executive Branch). Drafted via multi-LLM protocol: v1 → Round 1 review (2 reviewers, 5 findings + 3 enhancements, all accepted) → v2 → Round 2 review (2 reviewers, 4 findings, all accepted) → v3 (FINAL) → integration.

### Problem

**Gap 70 (Administrative Attrition via Civil Service Purge):** One level of government can systematically degrade another level's administrative capacity by weaponizing personnel rules — targeted poaching campaigns, security clearance revocation, loyalty test exclusion, and seniority reset traps. The vulnerability is asymmetric: a level with greater resources (typically Federal) can "lobotomize" another level's governance through talent extraction rather than direct confrontation. Existing provisions cover pension portability (Art I §8), professional licensing (Art I §9/§14), and federal merit system protection (Art II §11), but the inter-level dimension — protections for employees moving between government levels and accountability for coordinated talent extraction — remained unaddressed.

### Pre-Existing Coverage

6 provisions analyzed; pension/benefit portability and professional licensing well-covered; gap narrowed to inter-level service credits, clearance reciprocity, transfer rights, anti-poaching, and personnel exchange:

| Provision | What It Covers | What Remained Uncovered |
|-----------|----------------|------------------------|
| Art II §11 Merit System Protection | Federal civil service: for-cause removal, 4,000 appointment ceiling, anti-circumvention | Federal only; no inter-level mobility or Regional/State equivalent mandate |
| Art I §8(q)-(u) Benefit Portability | Pensions, health trusts, educational accounts fully portable | Non-pension service credits (seniority, leave, tenure) NOT portable across levels |
| Art I §9 Professional Licensing | Credential recognition, fee parity, 30-day processing | Security clearance reciprocity NOT addressed |
| Art I §14 Professional Credential Protection | No license revocation based on federal service | Clearance weaponization and inter-level employment retaliation NOT covered |
| Art X §20 Pension Discipline | Actuarial funding requirements | No inter-level service credit recognition |
| Art IX §6(d)(3) Lobbying Reform | Clearance denial as prohibited lobbying retaliation | Does not extend to inter-level employment context |

### Solution

New Section 6 with 6 subsections added to Article V:

| Subsection | Content | Key Provisions |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| §6(a) | Service Credit Portability | All public service counts across levels; IFC equivalence tables for grade/rank/step; 30-day max benefits gap; actuarial liability transfer (originating level remits IFC-calculated value); retirement eligibility through Art I §8 mechanics; local probation preserved |
| §6(b) | Inter-Level Transfer Rights | No retaliation for inter-level service; 24-month return right with supernumerary reinstatement (12-month, 2% per-agency cap); no non-compete/loyalty tests; narrow conflict-of-interest carve-out (3 role types: intelligence/judicial/procurement, duration-limited to role assignment) |
| §6(c) | Security Clearance Reciprocity | Cross-level recognition with federal-standard floor; no revocation by level; 30-day processing with security risk hold exception (sealed NCC review within 15 days, auto-grant if not sustained); void mobility-restricting sharing agreement conditions; NCC resolves equivalence disputes |
| §6(d) | Anti-Poaching / Administrative Warfare | IFC salary benchmarks; 10% rebuttable presumption (defined terms: career workforce, formal written offers, concentrated, incidental); ARB finding with cessation/compensation/personal liability ("knowingly directed or authorized" with safe harbor); NCC expedited 30-day judicial review |
| §6(e) | Intergovernmental Personnel Exchange | 3-year voluntary details; home-level benefits retained; emergency assistance distinct from transfer (no 24-month clock) |
| §6(f) | Coordination | Supplements Art II §11 (more protective governs); extends Art I §8 to non-pension credits; extends Art I §9/§14 to clearances; IFC-calculated merit-protection ratio for Regional/State political appointment ceiling with structural autonomy |

### Key Design Decisions

- **Placed as §6** (DD-1): Art V covers executive branch structure; civil service mobility is structural; follows §5 (receivership)
- **Narrowed from original 4-part proposal** (DD-2): Pre-existing coverage (pension, licensing, federal merit system) eliminates redundancy
- **IFC equivalence tables** (DD-3): Grade/rank/step structures differ across levels; annual updates avoid constitutional rigidity
- **10% rebuttable presumption with defined terms** (DD-4/DD-16): Bright-line trigger; "career workforce" (full-time, non-political, post-probationary), "concentrated" (same agency/specialty), "incidental" (routine public postings)
- **24-month return with supernumerary + 2% cap** (DD-5/DD-19): Substantive return right bounded by fiscal prudence
- **ARB for Administrative Warfare** (DD-6): Inter-level expertise; NCC judicial review limited to procedural regularity
- **Mens rea + safe harbor** (DD-7): "Knowingly directed or authorized" prevents chilling routine hiring
- **Federal-standard floor for clearances** (DD-12/DD-20): Clearances are binary security determinations, not administrative rankings; NCC for disputes
- **NCC sealed security hold review** (DD-17): 15-day deadline; prevents indefinite pretext holds
- **Actuarial liability transfer** (DD-14): Prevents fiscal dumping on smaller jurisdictions
- **Local probation preserved** (DD-13): Service credits accelerate eligibility but don't bypass competence evaluation
- **Narrow conflict-of-interest carve-out** (DD-15): 3 role types only, duration-limited to assignment
- **Retirement eligibility via Art I §8** (DD-18): No unfunded pension obligations independent of existing framework
- **IFC-calculated merit-protection ratio** (DD-10): Converts absolute federal ceiling (4,000) to applicable ratio for different-sized jurisdictions

### Review Protocol Summary

**Round 1 (v1 → v2):** 8 findings from 2 reviewers. 5 single-reviewer: S1 (security risk hold exception, HIGH), S2 (conflict-of-interest carve-out, MEDIUM), S3 (local probation, MEDIUM), S4 (defined terms, MEDIUM), S5 (mens rea standard, LOW). 3 enhancements: S6 (actuarial liability transfer), S7 (supernumerary reinstatement), S8 (Regional ceiling structural autonomy). All accepted.

**Round 2 (v2 → v3 FINAL):** 4 findings from 2 reviewers. S9 (federal-standard floor for clearances, HIGH), S10 (IFC-calculated ratio for merit-protection, MEDIUM), S11 (retirement eligibility via Art I §8, MEDIUM), S12 (2% supernumerary cap, LOW). All accepted.

## 2026-02-04: Gap 121 — Fact-Hiding ARB Loophole Resolved (Article II Section 7-B)

One electoral/judicial gap resolved through new Section 7-B (Mixed Question Review Doctrine) in Article II (Allocation of Powers), Section 7 (Allocation Review Board). Drafted via multi-LLM protocol: v1 → Round 1 review (2 reviewers, 5 findings: 0 convergent, 0 complementary, 0 contradictions, 5 single-reviewer accepted) → v2 → Round 2 review (2 reviewers, 4 findings: 0 convergent, 0 complementary, 0 contradictions, 4 single-reviewer accepted + 2 OQ resolutions) → v3 (FINAL) → integration.

### Problem

**Gap 121 (Fact-Hiding ARB Loophole):** Article II, Section 7(k) provides that ARB decisions are "final on factual matters," with Section 7(j) limiting Supreme Court review to "errors of constitutional interpretation" and "violation of due process." A hostile ARB could exploit the undefined boundary between "factual findings" and "constitutional interpretation" by recharacterizing constitutional boundary disputes as factual determinations — e.g., characterizing a power-allocation conclusion as a factual finding about "administrative capacity" or "historical practice" — effectively insulating unconstitutional actions from judicial review. The vulnerability is structural: the ARB determines whether a matter involves power allocation (§7(p)(3)), and its factual findings are both final (§7(k)) and non-remandable (§7(m)). A factual finding that covertly resolves a constitutional boundary question becomes unreviewable, non-remandable, and immediately binding (§7(i)).

### Pre-Existing Coverage

8 provisions analyzed; none addressed the law/fact boundary characterization for ARB power-allocation determinations:

| Provision | What It Covers | What Remained Uncovered |
|-----------|----------------|------------------------|
| Art II §7(j) SC Review Scope | Reviews only for constitutional interpretation errors and due process violations | No mechanism to identify mixed questions where factual finding determines constitutional boundary |
| Art II §7(k) Factual Finality | ARB decisions final on factual matters | No definition of "factual matter" vs. "constitutional interpretation"; boundary undefined |
| Art II §7(m) No Factual Remand | SC cannot remand for further factual findings | Mischaracterized constitutional question becomes both unreviewable AND non-remandable |
| Art II §7(n) Reversal or Affirmance Only | SC affirms or reverses, specifies correct interpretation | Only functions when SC recognizes question as "constitutional interpretation" |
| Art II §7(p)(2)-(3) Self-Determination | Transfers power-allocation filings to ARB | ARB controls jurisdictional framing, compounds characterization vulnerability |
| Art II §7(aa) Bias Finding | De novo review for statistically significant bias | System-level remedy only; requires 3 years of data; doesn't address individual case-level gaming |
| Art II §7-A(g) Factual Finding Limitation | Factual findings final only with disclosed data/transparent methodology | Addresses data transparency, not law/fact boundary characterization |
| Art XIV §9(a)-(c) De Novo Review Mandate | All questions of law de novo; factual deference preserved | Establishes principle but doesn't define law/fact boundary for ARB specifically |

### Solution

New Section 7-B with 6 subsections added to Article II, Section 7:

| Subsection | Content | Key Provisions |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| §7-B(a) | Law/Fact Boundary | Three-category taxonomy (purely factual / mixed question / pure constitutional interpretation); 6 presumptive mixed-question categories (administrative capacity, historical practice, functional equivalence, spillover effects, regional interest, legitimate exercise with empirical predicates); illustrative, not exhaustive |
| §7-B(b) | De Novo Review for Mixed Questions | SC reviews mixed questions de novo; independently determines characterization; factual finality applies only to purely factual determinations; SC may examine factual components of mixed questions |
| §7-B(c) | Mandatory Identification | ARB must label each finding; written explanation for factual labels; rebuttable presumption for unlabeled findings; substance-over-label rule; ARO characterization assessment in Adversarial Report |
| §7-B(d) | Characterization Challenges | 14-day window from later of determination or ARO report with 45-day outer limit; SC 30-day expedited decision; de novo review upon successful challenge; SC final arbiter; does not consume one-appeal; anti-retaliation with JCB referral |
| §7-B(e) | Systematic Mischaracterization | CPF at 3+ reclassifications within 2 years; 12-month rebuttable presumption; member recusal from reconsideration; removal for cause; recusal quorum protection via Chief Justice 7-day appointment from Judicial Conference standing list |
| §7-B(f) | Coordination | Supplements §7(j)-(o); §7(m) exception for mixed questions with no-new-evidence rule and 30-day deadline; §7-A(g) independence; §7(aa) cumulative; Art XIV §9 alignment; parallel filing carve-out; §7(r) tolling during characterization challenge |

### Key Design Decisions

- **Placed as §7-B** (DD-1): Follows §7-A (Algorithmic Governance Transparency) pattern; supplements §7(j)-(o) without modifying text
- **Three-category taxonomy** (DD-2): Maps to established legal doctrine (*Pullman-Standard*, *Ornelas v. United States*); clear definitions
- **Six presumptive mixed-question categories, illustrative** (DD-3/DD-21): Most common vehicles for disguising constitutional conclusions; illustrative approach prevents terminological evasion
- **De novo review for mixed questions** (DD-4): Consistent with Art XIV §9(a) general principle; clear error standard would leave room for gaming
- **Substance-over-label rule** (DD-6): Prevents micro-finding granularity gaming; mirrors tax law "substance over form" doctrine
- **SC as final arbiter of characterization** (DD-8): Body whose review is being defined cannot control scope of that review
- **Characterization challenge distinct from one-appeal** (DD-9/DD-14): Procedural/threshold question; forcing appeal expenditure would chill challenges
- **"Legitimate exercise" narrowed to empirical predicates** (DD-13): Pure legal questions excluded from presumption
- **Recusal quorum protection via self-contained Chief Justice appointment** (DD-16): 7-day deadline; Judicial Conference standing list; temporary members limited to specific proceeding
- **§7(r) tolling during characterization challenges** (DD-17): Prevents timing conflict between challenge path and 120-day global deadline
- **No-new-evidence rule for directed additional findings** (DD-18): Prevents backdoor to general factual remand; 30-day completion deadline
- **45-day outer limit on challenge window** (DD-19): Prevents ARO delay as finality lever
- **Anti-retaliation with JCB referral** (DD-20): Closes GV-9; removal-for-cause consequence

### Review Protocol Summary

**Round 1 (v1 → v2):** 5 findings from 2 reviewers. 0 convergent, 0 complementary, 0 contradictions. 5 single-reviewer: S1 (recusal quorum protection, HIGH), S2 ("successfully" ambiguity clarified, MEDIUM), S3 (14-day/ARO timing alignment, MEDIUM), S4 (factual remand gate tightened, MEDIUM), S5 ("legitimate exercise" narrowed, LOW). OQ-5 resolved.

**Round 2 (v2 → v3 FINAL):** 4 findings from 2 reviewers. 0 convergent, 0 complementary, 0 contradictions. 4 single-reviewer: S6 (§7(r) tolling provision, HIGH), S7 (self-contained appointment procedure, MEDIUM), S8 (no-new-evidence rule and 30-day deadline, MEDIUM), S9 (45-day ARO outer limit, LOW). OQ-1 resolved (illustrative, DD-21). OQ-4 resolved (anti-retaliation, DD-20; closes GV-9).

## 2026-02-04: Gap 102 — Emergency Loophole for Information Warfare Resolved (Article XI-RF Section 7)

One emergency/military gap resolved through new Section 7 (Cyber Operations with Domestic Effect) in Article XI-RF (Armed Forces RF Supplement). Drafted via multi-LLM protocol: v1 → Round 1 review (2 reviewers, 4 single-reviewer + 1 complementary, all accepted) → v2 → Round 2 review (2 reviewers, 5 convergent findings, all accepted) → v3 (FINAL) → integration.

### Problem

**Gap 102 (Emergency Loophole for Information Warfare):** Article XVI (Cyber Defense) allows the President to conduct cyber defense operations and declare cyber emergencies. The undefined boundary between foreign cyber defense and domestic information control could be exploited by: (1) designating domestic opposition as "foreign proxies" to obtain foreign intelligence authorization under Art XVI §3(e); (2) seizing communications platforms under cyber emergency (Art XVI §6(e)); (3) labeling domestic operations "administrative" to bypass Two-Key; (4) targeting journalists under the pretext of "protection." The compatibility clause references "digital force equivalence" but lacks operative constitutional text implementing Two-Key for cyber operations with domestic effect.

### Pre-Existing Coverage

8 provisions analyzed; warrant requirements and surveillance limits exist but leave the proxy designation loophole, "administrative bypass" of Two-Key, and absence of press/platform/election protections unclosed:

| Provision | What It Covers | What Remained Uncovered |
|-----------|----------------|------------------------|
| Art XVI §3(e) Domestic Targeting Prohibition | No targeting US persons without warrant or foreign intelligence authorization | "Foreign intelligence authorization" available after unilateral proxy designation |
| Art XVI §6 Cyber Emergency Authority | 30-day emergency limit; 72-hour infrastructure operation | Government can operate communications platforms; no content protections |
| Art XVI §7 Mass Surveillance Prohibition | Mass surveillance prohibited; FISA warrant required | FISA warrant available after proxy designation |
| Art XI-RF Compatibility Clause | States "digital force equivalence" | Compatibility note only; no operative Two-Key for cyber |
| Art XI-RF §2(h)(1) Emergency Response | 48-hour Governor response for cyber-physical attacks | Covers infrastructure attacks only; not offensive domestic cyber ops |
| Art XI-RF §4(a)(5) Inherently Governmental Function | Surveillance of US persons restricted to sworn officers | Doesn't prevent government surveillance under "foreign intelligence" |
| Art III §4(a)(6) Right to Speak | Unwaivable core right to speak on public concerns | No specific protection against cyber operations targeting speech |
| Art II §23(h) First Amendment Preservation | Criticism of government protected | No specific prohibition on cyber operations suppressing speech |

### Solution

New Section 7 with 6 subsections added to Article XI-RF:

| Subsection | Content | Key Provisions |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| §7(a) | Definitions and Scope | "Cyber operation with domestic effect" (functional, regardless of characterization); "domestic communications" (at least one US person); "proxy designation" |
| §7(b) | Two-Key Extension | Two-Key required for all cyber ops with domestic effect; criminal warrant exception (primary-purpose test, named-target-only, no platform effects, no strategic info warfare); CISA Director weekly certification with automatic suspension for missed deadlines; defensive carve-out with expansion trigger |
| §7(c) | Proxy Designation Limitations | NCC judicial finding required (clear and convincing evidence); "direct agent" = instructions AND compensation; 5 exclusions (shared views, public media, aligned advocacy, non-governmental funding, foreign contacts); cleared special advocate; 180-day validity with fresh-evidence renewal |
| §7(d) | Platform and Communications Protection | Seizure limited to active attack + 72 hours (NCC cessation finding, 48-hour ruling deadline); content control prohibited; content removal via public legal process (30-day publication, NCC-approved delay up to 30 additional days); anti-cycling rule (72-hour bar after voluntary relinquishment) |
| §7(e) | Press and Political Speech Protection | Journalist targeting requires direct-agent warrant + least restrictive means; 48-hour auto-purge for incidental collection (NCC retention warrant required); 90-day election period protection for federal/Regional elections via NEC (presumption against authorization; NEC jurisdiction limited to cyber-op authorization) |
| §7(f) | Coordination | Supplements Art XVI (proxy designation compliance); supplements Art XVII-RF (emergency doesn't suspend); cumulative authorization (Two-Key + warrant, with (b)(3) exception); characterization irrelevant; autonomous systems independent; law enforcement carve-out |

### Key Design Decisions

- **Placed as Art XI-RF §7** (DD-1): Implements "digital force equivalence" from compatibility clause; follows §4/§5/§6 pattern
- **Two-Key for all cyber ops with domestic effect** (DD-2): Cyber capabilities directed at domestic targets get same institutional check as kinetic force
- **"Direct agent" = instructions AND compensation** (DD-3): Prevents broad labeling; mirrors espionage law standards
- **Criminal warrant exception with primary-purpose test** (DD-6/DD-16/DD-20): Prevents over-proceduralization of legitimate criminal investigation while blocking pretextual relabeling
- **Scale constraint on criminal warrants** (DD-21): Named targets only; no platform/network effects; no strategic information warfare disguised as enforcement
- **CISA Director weekly certification + automatic suspension** (DD-18/DD-23): For-cause-protected institutional check; self-executing suspension
- **NCC cessation finding with 48-hour deadline** (DD-17): Independent determination; any-party petition
- **Anti-cycling rule** (DD-22): 72-hour bar on re-seizure after voluntary relinquishment
- **NCC-approved publication delay** (DD-24): 30-day default with up to 30 additional days for sources/methods
- **48-hour auto-purge for journalist communications** (DD-19): Reverses default from "retain unless prohibited" to "purge unless warranted"
- **Election protection for federal AND Regional elections** (DD-15): Governors hold Two-Key; Regional election interference could compromise Two-Key check
- **NEC jurisdiction limited to cyber-op authorization** (DD-25): Prevents conflict with Regional election adjudication
- **"Direct agent" limited to foreign military/intelligence** (DD-13): Broader definitions sweep in legitimate contacts; false positive risk
- **No safe harbor for unauthorized operations** (DD-14): Defensive carve-out covers genuine emergencies; safe harbor creates perverse incentive

### Review Protocol Summary

**Round 1 (v1 → v2):** 5 findings from 2 reviewers. 0 convergent, 1 complementary, 0 contradictions. 4 single-reviewer: S1 (§7(b)(3)/(f)(3) internal conflict, HIGH), S2 (§7(b)(3) broad Two-Key bypass via warrant routing, MEDIUM), S3 (§7(d)(1) "ceases" undefined, MEDIUM), S4 (§7(b)(4) defensive-offensive blur self-reporting, MEDIUM). 1 complementary: C1 (journalist minimization — 48-hour auto-purge). 3 OQs resolved, 1 reviewer question resolved.

**Round 2 (v2 → v3 FINAL):** 5 findings from 2 reviewers. 5 convergent: C1 (criminal warrant pretext test, MEDIUM), C2 (voluntary cessation cycling, MEDIUM), C3 (NEC Regional election jurisdiction, MEDIUM), C4 (CISA missed certification consequences, LOW), C5 (content removal publication delay, LOW). 1 question subsumed. 2 remaining OQs resolved.
