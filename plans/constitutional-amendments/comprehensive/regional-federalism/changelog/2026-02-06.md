## 2026-02-06: Gap 59 — State-Regional Preemption Deadlock Resolved (Article II, Section 25)

One intergovernmental gap resolved through new Article II, Section 25 (Regional-State Supremacy and Implementation) in `02-design/constitution/02-powers-and-rights.md`. Drafted via multi-LLM protocol: briefing generated by coordinator with overlap analysis (30% overlap) and 8 design questions, reviewed by 2 external LLMs. First reviewer integrated directly (bypassing protocol Step 3-6). Second reviewer identified 2 High, 2 Medium, 1 Low findings. Coordinator verified all claims, synthesized divergences, presented 5 design decisions to human. Human resolved all 5, coordinator applied corrections. Convergence in 1 effective round after corrections.

### Problem

**Gap 59 (State-Regional Preemption Deadlock):** The constitution declares Regional supremacy over State law (Article III §3(b)) but provides zero enforcement machinery. States can exercise a de facto veto over Regional policy through administrative non-compliance — refusing to issue permits, conduct environmental reviews, or process land use changes. Regional Exclusive Domains become "Domains in Name Only."

### Placement Correction

Original proposal targeted Article III §7(a-w). Corrected to Article II §25 for two reasons:

1. Article III §7 is occupied (Digital Habeas Corpus / Gap 209)
2. Article III is "Rights Floors and Subsidiarity" — wrong topical home; related resolved gaps (96, 114, 139, 265, 269) are all in Article II / II-RF

### Resolution

New Section 25 added to Article II with 23 subsections (a)-(w):

- **§25(a) Scope:** Operationalizes Art III §3(b) for Regional-State relations
- **§25(b) Tiered Classification:** Full Preemption / Cooperative Implementation / Concurrent Authority with ARB classification
- **§25(c) Federal Exclusive Domains:** Cross-reference to §1(e)(1) (not re-enumerated)
- **§25(d) Regional Development Banking:** Limited authority with non-discrimination floor via Art III §5 cross-reference and IFC lending pattern monitoring
- **§25(e) Default Classification:** Cooperative Implementation for Regional Exclusive Domains; Concurrent Authority for Structured Concurrent Domains
- **§25(f) Full Preemption Criteria:** Physical continuity, ineffectiveness of State variation, no reasonable flexibility — clear and convincing evidence standard
- **§25(g) Direct Implementation:** Eminent domain, permits, contracting, agencies — with scope limitation (g)(5) and National Necessity priority (g)(6) per §17(d)
- **§25(h)-(i) Cooperative Implementation:** Performance standards, 180-day State plans, ARB dispute resolution
- **§25(j) Funding:** 70/30 default split, IFC-adjudicated Disproportionate Burden petitions with IFC-published B/C methodology, anti-gaming provision
- **§25(k) Anti-Obstruction Ladder:** 90-day notice → 180-day withholding → 365-day direct implementation → reclassification
- **§25(l) Local Government Obstruction:** State responsibility; Gap 96 Local Autonomy Floor preserved for Cooperative/Concurrent domains via explicit Art II-RF §3 cross-reference
- **§25(m) "Working On It" Prohibition:** 24-month environmental review cap, 12-month permitting cap, constructive denial
- **§25(n) Cost Recovery:** 15% surcharge; Anti-Coercion Rule (Art X §4) not a defense
- **§25(o) Sovereign Immunity Waiver:** Self-executing, limited to this Section, reassertion is independent violation
- **§25(p)-(r) State Constitutional Challenge:** NCC jurisdiction, 60-day filing, no State-court stays; post-ratification strict scrutiny; anti-manipulation safeguards
- **§25(s) State Discretion:** Retained even in Full Preemption for local aspects and alternative methods
- **§25(t)-(u) Subsidiarity Review:** ARB petition with anti-centralization presumption; Region bears burden of proof
- **§25(v) Adversarial Fact-Finding:** Independent data collection, perjury certification, asymmetric factual sabotage penalties
- **§25(w) Filing Management:** Disputes count under §4-A limits; ARO procedures apply

### Additional Provisions

- **Article XVIII §3(e):** Formal definition of "National Constitutional Court" as the Supreme Court exercising constitutional review jurisdiction
- **Article III §3(b):** Forward reference to Art II §25 for enforcement mechanisms

### Design Decisions (10 total)

## 2026-02-06: Gap 60 — Para-Diplomacy Conflict Resolved (Article VI, Section 5)

One intergovernmental gap resolved through new Article VI, Section 5 (Structured Para-Diplomacy Framework) in `02-design/constitution/03-regional-governance.md`. Drafted via multi-LLM protocol: briefing generated by coordinator with overlap analysis (~45% overlap) and 8 design questions, reviewed by 2 external LLMs. Round 1 produced 11 findings (4 High, 5 Medium, 2 Low) and 5 new design decisions (D9a-D13). Round 2 confirmed all 16 corrections with 2 Medium and 2 Low residual findings. Convergence achieved in 2 rounds.

### Problem

**Gap 60 (Para-Diplomacy Conflict):** Regions are designed to manage cross-border realities (climate, labor, energy) but the Constitution grants the Federal government exclusive foreign policy authority (Art II §1; Art VI §4), creating a "Multiple Voices" crisis. The One Voice Doctrine (Art VI §4) is prohibition-only — it says what Regions cannot do but does not affirmatively authorize what they can do. The Treaty Power can be used as a backdoor to bypass the 60% House supermajority requirement for Regional Domain legislation.

### Placement Correction

Original proposal targeted Article I §9(a-cc). Corrected to Article VI §5 for two reasons:

1. Article I §9 is occupied (Mutual Recognition — professional credentials, family status portability)
2. Article I is "Regional Structure" — wrong topical home; Article VI is "Foreign Affairs and Regional Limitations" where the One Voice Doctrine (§4, Gap 266) already resides

### Resolution

New Section 5 added to Article VI with 30 subsections (a)-(dd) in 6 parts:

**Part 1 — Regional Foreign Engagement Authorization (a)-(d):**

- **§5(a) Authorized Engagement:** Transboundary coordination, treaty implementation, information sharing, emergency response — builds on §4(c) permitted activities
- **§5(b) Prohibited Engagement:** Cross-references Art VI §4(a-b) and Art I §5(f)-(h); adds binding commitments, recognition, diplomatic missions
- **§5(c) Notification:** 30-day State Department notification for substantive discussions, agreements, and proposals
- **§5(d) Facilitative Coordinator:** State Department designee with facilitative-only mandate; explicit anti-gatekeeping safeguards; auto-suspension by operation of law upon ARB finding of misconduct (D13)

**Part 2 — Treaty Consultation with Parallel Threshold (e)-(i):**

- **§5(e) Mandatory Consultation:** 90-day pre-signature draft text; written comment; consultation meeting
- **§5(f) Regional Impact Statement:** Submitted with treaty to Senate
- **§5(g) Parallel Threshold:** Pre-signature 60% House vote for treaties that would require 60% House if enacted domestically (D8); ARB certification with deemed-triggered default on inaction (D10); House inaction = deemed not approved (D10)
- **§5(h) Emergency Exception:** Presidential certification; 30-day House vote; no domestic effect on failure; once-per-Congress limit
- **§5(i) Anti-Circumvention:** 5-year lookback; characterization test; executive agreement notification with 30-day no-domestic-effect period (D12); cause of action with burden shift (D11)

**Part 3 — Conflict Resolution (j)-(o):**

- **§5(j) Supersession:** §4(d) procedures do not apply to §5 engagements (D9a)
- **§5(k)-(l) Procedural Verification:** ARB determines specific treaty contradiction, binding commitments, procedural compliance — NOT material impairment
- **§5(m) Material Impairment:** NCC in camera review with rehearing; classified materials and expert testimony (D4)
- **§5(n) Standard of Review:** ARB procedural (specific contradiction); NCC material (substantially undermine active initiative, concrete/demonstrable, no alternative means)
- **§5(o) Protected Activities:** Same subject matter, stricter standards, communication on Regional matters, policy preference expression

**Part 4 — National Security Exception (p)-(s):**

- **§5(p) Classified Negative-Key:** Secretary personal certification; 48-hour classified ARB briefing; 30-day temporary stay
- **§5(q) Standard:** Intelligence-supported; identified risk; specific to engagement
- **§5(r) In Camera Judicial Review:** NCC review; extend/permanent/lift options (D4)
- **§5(s) Anti-Abuse:** Personal certification; generic intelligence committee reporting (D2); 2-strike prior-approval rule; impeachment for false certification

**Part 5 — Foreign Influence Safeguards (t)-(y):**

- **§5(t) Funding Prohibition:** Cross-reference to §4(e-1) (D5); $100K in-kind threshold; infrastructure review; anti-favorable-terms
- **§5(u) IFC Valuation:** Self-contained authority (D7); market-rate, replacement cost, licensing fee methodologies; presumption of high value; anti-structuring
- **§5(v)-(w) Disclosure and Counterintelligence:** Annual reporting; cooperation requirement
- **§5(x) Foreign Capture Split:** ARB factual findings (undisclosed funding, counterintelligence refusal); NCC political determinations (coordinating against policy, Systemic Symbolic Contradiction) (D3); 5-year suspension
- **§5(y) Systemic Symbolic Contradiction:** Presidential declaration + Congressional majority within 30 days; 3-of-5 pattern; ARB Cease and Desist pending NCC determination

**Part 6 — Subnational Coordination (z)-(cc):**

- **§5(z) Authorization:** "Notwithstanding Art I §5(f)-(h)" — standards harmonization, emergency, environmental, infrastructure, cultural (D9b)
- **§5(aa) Limits:** No binding foreign national government; no tariff arrangements; no federal law violations
- **§5(bb) National Common Market Bridge:** Compatibility with Federal Floors; 60-day ARB review; ministerial equivalency pathway (90 days / $5,000 cap)
- **§5(cc) Model Agreements:** State Department published; presumed compliant

**Jurisdiction — §5(dd):** Explicit ARB jurisdiction grant; §4-A filing limits apply

### Cross-References Added

- **Art VI §4(c):** Forward reference to §5 for structured engagement framework
- **Art I §5(g):** Carve-out: "Except as authorized under Article VI, Section 5(z)"

### Design Decisions (13 total)

| ID | Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----|----------|--------|-----------|
| D1 | Placement | Art VI §5 standalone | Adjacent to One Voice Doctrine; foreign affairs article |
| D2 | Intelligence Committees | Generic language | Survives restructuring; constitutional pattern |
| D3 | Foreign Capture scope | ARB factual / NCC political split | Maintains procedural/material split |
| D4 | NCC classified proceedings | "In camera review" | Matches existing judicial practice |
| D5 | Overlap handling | Cross-reference existing prohibitions | Avoids duplication |
| D6 | Coordinator model | Two-track (prohibitive regulatory / facilitative diplomatic) | Matches risk profiles |
| D7 | IFC valuation authority | Self-contained in §5(u) | Cleaner than amending Art X §5 |
| D8 | Parallel Threshold scope | Only where 60% House needed domestically | Precisely targets backdoor |
| D9a | §4(d) conflict | Explicit supersession in §5(j) | Clean resolution |
| D9b | Art I §5(g) conflict | Both-direction carve-out | Bidirectional clarity |
| D10 | Default on inaction | ARB deemed triggered; House deemed not approved | Conservative defaults |
| D11 | Anti-circumvention | Cause of action with burden shift | Legally operative |
| D12 | Executive agreements | Notification + petition + no domestic effect until 30 days | Closes blind spot |
| D13 | Coordinator enforcement | Auto-suspension by operation of law | Self-executing |

### Reviewer Divergences Resolved

| Issue | Reviewer 1 | Reviewer 2 | Resolution |
|-------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| IFC placement (D7) | Centralize in Art X §5 | Self-contained in Art VI §5 | Human chose: self-contained (Option A) |

## 2026-02-06: Gap 54 — Expert Capture Marked RESOLVED (Already Integrated in Art II §7)

Gap 54 (Expert Capture / Administrative Law Variation and Due Process) found to be fully integrated into Art II §7 (Allocation Review Board). All five parts of the proposed Adversarial Governance framework were already present: Part 1 Compositional Safeguards (§7(b)-(f)), Part 2 Adversarial Review Office (§7(s)-(v)), Part 3 Regional Override (§7(w)-(y)), Part 4 Systematic Bias Detection (§7(z)-(bb)), Part 5 Budgetary Independence (§7(cc)-(ee)), plus Anti-Consolidation Safeguards (§7(ff)-(ff-4)).

## 2026-02-06: Gap 58 — Geographic Defense Penalty Resolved (Article XI-RF, Section 8)

One intergovernmental gap resolved through new Article XI-RF, Section 8 (Defense Burden Equalization Framework) in `02-design/constitution/10-armed-forces.md`. Drafted via multi-LLM protocol: briefing generated by coordinator with overlap analysis (~25% overlap) and 8 design questions, reviewed by 2 external LLMs. Round 1 produced 7 findings (3 High, 3 Medium, 1 Low) and 4 new design decisions (D9-D12). Round 2 confirmed all 15 corrections with 4 Medium and 3 Low residual findings. Convergence achieved in 2 rounds.

### Problem

**Gap 58 (Geographic Defense Penalty):** The Three-Tier armed forces structure creates an unacknowledged fiscal asymmetry where border and coastal Regions bear disproportionate defense costs while interior Regions enjoy "free rider" benefits. Pacific Region has 7,600+ miles of coastline; South has the entire southern border (~1,900 miles); Plains and Heartland have no international borders.

### Placement Correction

Original proposal targeted Art XI §11. Corrected to Art XI-RF §8 because existing sections only go to §7 (Cyber Operations); §8 is the next available section number.

### Resolution

New Section 8 added to Art XI-RF with 21 subsections (a)-(u) in 6 parts, plus §6(b) forward reference for defense/disaster track separation:

**Part 1 — Defense Burden Assessment (a)-(d):**

- **§8(a) Annual Calculation:** DoD provides threat data (border miles, coastline, critical infrastructure, Threat Environment Assessment including Hostile Intent and Mobilization factor); IFC calculates Defense Burden Index; DoD has no authority over final fiscal determinations
- **§8(b) Deterrence Credit:** 10% bonus for 3 years for measurable improvement; not reduced for adversary buildup in response to effective deterrence
- **§8(c) National Defense Baseline:** Minimum capacity, Excess Defense Burden, Shared Benefit Infrastructure categories
- **§8(d) Methodology Transparency:** Published, ARB-reviewed for objectivity, 5-year update cycle

**Part 2 — Defense Equalization Fund (e)-(h):**

- **§8(e) Establishment:** Federal capitalization for 3 years; Regional phase-in years 4-5
- **§8(f) Contributions:** 40% equal per-Region base + 60% fiscal capacity proportional
- **§8(g) Disbursements:** Excess Burden, Shared Benefit maintenance, surge capacity
- **§8(h) Limits:** 150% cap over 5 years; emergency override via Presidential declaration + Congressional majority; emergency powers cross-reference

**Part 3 — Minimum Readiness and Mutual Aid (i)-(m):**

- **§8(i) Minimum Readiness:** Category 3 disaster response, interoperability certification, annual multi-Regional exercise
- **§8(j) Standing Defense Mutual Aid Compact:** Separate defense/disaster tracks; "qualifying defense emergency" defined; Governor authorization required; rebuttable presumption; ARB refusal review; anti-commandeering (30-day limit + Congressional certification for 30-90 day extensions)
- **§8(k) Cost-Sharing:** 60% requesting Region, 40% DBEF for deployments >14 days
- **§8(l) Free Rider Penalty:** Non-Coercion Standard does not apply (germane to compact); suspension of aid and disbursements
- **§8(m) Readiness Certification:** ARB annual ministerial function; field-verified exercises

**Part 4 — Shared Benefit Infrastructure (n)-(p):**

- **§8(n) Designation:** Presidential nomination + ARB certification (clear and convincing evidence) + NCC de novo review; national-scope assets presumptively qualify; regional-scope requires adjacency or demonstrable benefit; 10-year sunset; 5-year challenge
- **§8(o) Cost Allocation:** 70/30 construction, 60/40 operating
- **§8(p) Access Guarantee:** Triple Lock for federal operational assumption (ARB + NCC + Congress)

**Part 5 — Anti-Gaming (q)-(s):**

- **§8(q) Prohibited Burden Inflation:** Artificial inflation, misclassification, incident manipulation; 20% excess threshold with prior certification
- **§8(r) Audit Authority:** GAO biennial audits
- **§8(s) Penalty:** Repayment + 25% penalty + 5-year enhanced scrutiny + prosecution referral

**Part 6 — Coordination and Savings (t)-(u):**

- **§8(t) National Necessity Savings Clause:** Art II §17 not limited; no Triple Lock required for National Necessity access
- **§8(u) IFC Methodology:** IFC data primacy; ARB reviews objectivity not fiscal methodology

### Cross-References Added

- **Art XI-RF §6(b):** Forward reference to §8 for defense-related mutual aid

### Design Decisions (12 total)

| ID | Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----|----------|--------|-----------|
| D1 | Mutual aid duration | Separate defense/disaster tracks with Congressional certification for 30-90 day extensions | Preserves existing §6(b) for disaster; defense needs longer windows |
| D2 | National Necessity deconfliction | Savings clause; DBEF does not limit Art II §17 | Existing NNE already has its own safeguards |
| D3 | Non-Coercion Standard | Belt-and-suspenders (explicit carve-out + germaneness argument) | Conservative approach for constitutional certainty |
| D4 | Cost allocation | 70/30 construction, 60/40 operating | Host Region retains operational control |
| D5 | DoD fiscal role | DoD provides threat data only; IFC calculates; DoD has no final fiscal authority | Prevents executive branch fiscal capture |
| D6 | Institutional placement | IFC fiscal, ARB objectivity, DoD threat data | Three-body separation of functions |
| D7 | Deterrence Credit cap | No cap; not reduced for adversary buildup | Prevents perverse penalty for success |
| D8 | Excess capacity threshold | 20% above Minimum Readiness with prior certification | Blocks gold-plating while allowing reasonable cushion |
| D9 | Standing Compact | All Regions auto-enrolled; no opt-out | Defense is non-excludable public good |
| D10 | Hostile Intent factor | Explicit inclusion in Threat Environment Assessment | Closes deterrence paradox feedback loop |
| D11 | Geographic scope test | National-scope presumptive; regional-scope requires adjacency or demonstrable benefit | Prevents abuse while covering genuine cases |
| D12 | Filing management | SBI challenges count under §4-A; readiness certification ministerial (exempt) | Prevents ARB overload |

### Reviewer Divergences Resolved

| Issue | Reviewer 1 | Reviewer 2 | Resolution |
|-------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Mutual aid duration (D1) | Align at 30 days for both tracks | Separate tracks with Congressional certification | Human chose: separate tracks (Option B) |
| DoD fiscal role (D5) | Remove DoD from fiscal process | Limit to data provision | Both agree DoD must not control transfers |
| Deterrence feedback loop (D10) | Not identified | Hostile Intent factor needed | Added per R2 recommendation |

## 2026-02-06: Gap 25 — Climate Emergency Coordination Marked RESOLVED (Already Integrated)

Gap 25 (Climate Emergency Coordination) found to be fully covered by existing constitutional provisions across four articles. The proposal file (`proposals/05-environment-infrastructure/climate-emergency-coordination.md`) itself confirms: "Constitutional amendment is not required; the framework uses existing constitutional authorities." All four gap components mapped to existing text; remaining elements are appropriately statutory.

Also corrected description mismatch in `00-index.md` (previously listed as "Cross-regional water rights during scarcity" — actual scope is broader climate emergency coordination).

### Coverage Map

| Gap Component | Constitutional Coverage |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Water scarcity allocation | Art I §7 (WRCB, National Water Court, equitable apportionment) |
| Emergency resource access | Art I §11(m) (declaration, anti-hoarding, treble damages, fair market compensation) |
| Environmental coordination | Art I §11(a)-(j) (transboundary harm, cumulative impact, shared ecosystems, carrying capacity) |
| Climate migration | Art I §8(f)-(m) (Migration Surge Stabilization, 3% trigger, automatic fiscal transfers) |
| Catastrophic displacement | Art XVII-RF §5 (IFC-certified declaration, voluntary allocation, Climate Displacement Reserve) |
| Carbon policy coordination | Art I §5 (inter-regional cooperation compact authority — statutory) |
| Adaptation infrastructure | Art I §5A (joint authority template — statutory) |
| Resource-restrictive standards | Art I §11(k) (certification, 4-part proportionality test, pretext finding) |

## 2026-02-06: Gap 130 — Audit-Capacity Freeze of the National Election Court Resolved (Article VII, Section 11)

One electoral/judicial gap resolved through new Article VII, Section 11 (NEC Operational Independence) in `02-design/single-topic/election-reform.md` and amendment of Article XIV-RF §2(b) from "may" to "shall" in `02-design/constitution/09-judiciary.md`. Drafted via multi-LLM protocol: briefing generated by coordinator with overlap analysis (35% overlap with ARB budget template and Gap 87) and 8 design questions, reviewed by 2 external LLMs. Reviewer 1 identified 2 High, 2 Medium, 2 Low findings. Reviewer 2 identified 2 High, 2 Medium findings. Coordinator synthesized 5 agreements and 3 divergences, presented to human for resolution. Human resolved all 3 divergences. Convergence in 1 round.

### Problem

**Gap 130 (Audit-Capacity Freeze):** The NEC has extensive mandatory functions (48-hour emergency panels, 14-day preliminary determinations, 28-day final determinations, Day 66 audit, obstruction findings, redistricting compliance) but zero constitutional operational capacity guarantees. A hostile Congress could zero out investigative staff while preserving judicial salaries, creating a "skeleton court" that cannot investigate fraud, audit counts, or evaluate evidence within required timelines.

### Placement Correction

Original proposal targeted Article XIV-RF, Section 5. Corrected to Article VII, Section 11 for three reasons:

1. Art XIV-RF §5 is occupied (Standing to Enforce the Constitution — Gaps 247, 175)
2. Art XIV-RF §6 is occupied (Shadow Stay Prevention — Gap 111)
3. All NEC powers and procedures are in Article VII (§§7-8, 10); operational capacity belongs with the powers it supports

### Budget Calibration Correction

Original proposal set budget floor at 0.05% of federal revenue (~$2.5B). This was 25x the ARB budget and comparable to a quarter of the FBI's entire budget — grossly miscalibrated for election forensics. Corrected to 0.002% base (~$100M) with automatic surge to 0.005% (~$250M) during federal general election years.

### Key Design Decisions

| ID | Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----|----------|--------|-----------|
| D1 | Placement | Art VII §11 | Co-locate with NEC powers |
| D2 | Budget model | ARB pattern (fixed %) | Proven constitutional template |
| D3 | Gap 87 interaction | Self-contained + savings clause | Election integrity too critical to depend on unresolved gap |
| D4 | Budget floor | 0.002% base / 0.005% election surge | Covers presidential + midterm; avoids off-year over-funding |
| D5 | NEC establishment | Amend "may" to "shall" | Mandatory existence required for mandatory jurisdiction |
| D6 | Investigative authority | Permanent staff + private experts; NO requisition | Eliminates separation-of-powers risk |
| D7 | Staffing | Budget + GAO fiscal adequacy | GAO certifies fiscal adequacy, not headcounts |
| D8 | Internal allocation | Chief proposes / panel approves / GAO audits | Three-layer defense against capture |

### Resolution

New Section 11 added to Article VII with 15 subsections (a)-(o) in 4 parts:

**Part 1 — NEC Budget Floor (a)-(d):**

- §11(a): Dedicated budget — 0.002% of federal revenue (base); 0.005% in federal general election years
- §11(b): Automatic appropriation, CPI adjustment, 30-day disbursement
- §11(c): Anti-manipulation — Congress may not reduce, condition, transfer, or delay

## 2026-02-06: Gap 11 — Boundary Revision Politics and Regional Identity Crystallization Resolved (Article I, Section 4-A)

One long-horizon systemic risk gap resolved through new Article I, Section 4-A (Boundary Revision Governance) in `02-design/constitution/01-regional-structure.md`. Drafted via multi-LLM protocol: briefing generated by coordinator with overlap analysis (20% overlap with Gap 12, 10% with Gap 87) and 13 design questions, reviewed by 2 external LLMs. Full convergence on D1-D8 (no divergences). Additional design questions D9-D13 raised by reviewers, full convergence on D9-D12, one divergence on D13 (budget calibration) resolved by human. Convergence in 1 round.

### Problem

**Gap 11 (Boundary Revision Politics):** Article I, Section 4 creates a solid three-tier approval framework (Commission + 2/3 Regional legislatures + national referendum) but delegates almost all operational protections to Congress via §4(c) and §4(e). Every anti-manipulation safeguard in the Regional Boundary Review and Revision Act — Commission composition, party balance, disqualification rules, 20-year review cycle, prohibited criteria, cooling-off periods, congressional bypass — can be amended or repealed by simple congressional majority. A hostile Congress could pack the Commission, freeze boundaries permanently, allow partisan criteria, or starve the Commission of resources.

### Key Design Decisions

| ID | Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----|----------|--------|-----------|
| D1 | Placement | New Art I §4-A | Avoids renumbering §4(f)-(r) State Transfer Mechanism |
| D2 | Periodic review | Constitutional 20-year minimum tied to decennial census | Prevents review freeze |
| D3 | Commission independence | Floor (principles, not full statutory detail) | Avoids over-rigidity |
| D4 | Commission budget | Fixed % with surge model (ARB/NEC pattern) | Prevents skeleton commission |
| D5 | Prohibited criteria | All three + next-cycle rule constitutionalized | Core anti-gaming rules |
| D6 | Anti-obstruction | Constitutional bypass (Commission submits directly) | Prevents congressional pocket veto |
| D7 | Cooling-off | Constitutional 4-year minimum | Prevents referendum harassment |
| D8 | Small Region protection | Region consent (2/3 legislature) for dissolution/merger | Prevents bully majority |
| D9 | Party-label evasion | 10-year affiliation definition (registration, primaries, officer roles, campaign employment, donations) | Prevents stealth partisanship |
| D10 | Midterm timing | Extend blackout to all federal general elections | Closes timing manipulation |
| D11 | Census data deadline | 180-day mandate with mandamus + provisional data authority | Prevents executive data starvation |
| D12 | Appointment vacancy | 90-day auto-fill via judicial lottery | Prevents quorum sabotage |
| D13 | Budget calibration | 0.0002% base / 0.001% surge for 5-year post-census window | Episodic body; carryover bridges gaps |

### Resolution

New Section 4-A added to Article I with 22 subsections (a)-(v) in 7 parts:

**Part 1 — Mandatory Periodic Review (a)-(b):**

- §4-A(a): 20-year review mandate tied to decennial census; Congress may increase frequency but not decrease
- §4-A(b): Census Bureau 180-day data provision deadline with mandamus remedy and provisional data authority

**Part 2 — Commission Independence Floor (c)-(h):**

- §4-A(c): Multi-source appointments (no single authority selects majority; at least 3 distinct appointing authorities)
- §4-A(d): Party balance cap with constitutional affiliation definition (registration, primaries, officer roles, campaign employment, donations over $5k — 10-year lookback; statute may expand, not narrow)
- §4-A(e): 10-year disqualification for elected officials, party officers, lobbyists, campaign employees
- §4-A(f): Removal only for cause by 2/3 Senate
- §4-A(g): 90-day vacancy auto-fill via judicial lottery (preserving party balance and disqualification rules)
- §4-A(h): Interim Commission (9 retired judges by lottery, no more than 2 per Region) if Congress fails to establish within 2 years

**Part 3 — Commission Budget Floor (i)-(m):**

- §4-A(i): 0.0002% base (~$10M) / 0.001% surge (~$50M) during 5-year review window following decennial census
- §4-A(j): Automatic appropriation, 30-day disbursement
- §4-A(k): Anti-manipulation (no reduce, condition, transfer, delay)
- §4-A(l): Carryover of unspent funds (no reversion to Treasury)
- §4-A(m): Mandamus enforcement (compel at floor, cannot exceed formula)

**Part 4 — Prohibited Criteria and Review Integrity (n)-(o):**

- §4-A(n): Constitutional prohibition on partisan advantage, racial/ethnic advantage, and retaliatory punishment criteria
- §4-A(o): Criteria updates (statutory or regulatory) apply only to next review cycle

**Part 5 — Anti-Obstruction and Anti-Harassment (p)-(s):**

- §4-A(p): 18-month congressional action deadline
- §4-A(q): Commission bypass to direct referendum if Congress fails to act (scheduling only; Regional legislature approval still required)
- §4-A(r): 4-year cooling-off after failed referendum; "substantially similar" defined
- §4-A(s): Extended blackout to all federal general elections (House/Senate/President) — 1 year before, 6 months after

**Part 6 — Small Region Protection (t):**

- §4-A(t): Region dissolution/merger/reduction by >1/3 requires 2/3 of affected Region's legislature (in addition to §4(a) requirements)

**Part 7 — Enforcement (u)-(v):**

- §4-A(u): Anti-retaliation — retaliatory boundary proposals void; expedited Supreme Court challenge
- §4-A(v): Savings clause — if COF established, offset but not below formula

## 2026-02-06: Gap 26 — Digital/AI Governance Framework Marked RESOLVED (Already Integrated)

Gap 26 (Digital/AI Governance Framework) found to be fully covered by existing constitutional provisions across four articles. All four identified problems mapped to existing text; the proposal file's constitutional provisions are weaker than what already exists. Remaining statutory elements (Federal AI Accountability Act, digital identity coordination, foundation model reporting) appropriately live in implementing legislation.

### Coverage Map

## 2026-02-06: Gap 124 — "Internal Tax Haven" Arbitrage Marked RESOLVED (Already Integrated)

Gap 124 (Internal Tax Haven Arbitrage) found to be ~96% covered by existing Article X provisions. All four proposed parts — capacity-based equalization adjustment, predatory competition prohibition, mobile factor floor, and arbitrage investigation/remedy — are substantially addressed. The three primary gaming vectors (zero-tax magnet, subsidized poaching, effort-laundering) are each blocked by specific constitutional mechanisms.

### Coverage Map

| Gap Component | Constitutional Coverage |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Part 1: Capacity-based equalization with tax expenditure add-back | Art X §3(f)-(h) — tax expenditures >2% GDP added back to capacity; IFC verification; comparative reporting |
| Part 2: Predatory competition prohibition | Art X §3(i)-(k) — subsidies conditioned on relocation prohibited; relocation subsidy definition; 5% GDP / 15% revenue ceiling |
| Part 3: Mobile factor floor | Art X §3(l)-(o) — minimum tax effort (75% national average); phantom revenue adjustment; anti-haven fiscal consequence (50% threshold deems average capacity) |
| Part 4: Arbitrage investigation and remedy | Art X §10 (fiscal intervention hierarchy) + §16 (forensic audit, falsification penalties, 3-year Exclusive Domain suspension) + §17 (IST certification) |
| Zero-tax magnet (gaming vector) | Art X §3(o) — anti-haven fiscal consequence automatically deems Region at average capacity |
| Subsidized poaching (gaming vector) | Art X §3(i)-(k) — predatory prohibition + subsidy ceiling + §3(f) tax expenditure add-back |
| Effort-laundering (gaming vector) | Art X §3(l)-(m) — minimum tax effort + phantom revenue adjustment |
| Corporate headquarters shell | Art X §3(r) — apportionment by sales/payroll/assets, not headquarters |

### Related Gaps

| Related Gap | Relationship |
|-------------|-------------|
| Gap 93 (Race to Bottom Subsidy) | Subsidy predation; Gap 124 addresses tax predation — both use §3(f)-(k) |
| Gap 107 (Ghost Residency) | Capacity manipulation via population; Gap 124 via taxation |
| Gap 110 (Equalization Extortion) | Formula leverage; Gap 124 addresses formula gaming |

## 2026-02-06: Gap 93 — Race to the Bottom Regional Tax/Subsidy Competition Resolved (Article X, Section 3(t)-(w))

One fiscal equalization gap resolved through new Article X, Section 3(t)-(w) (Predatory Subsidy Enforcement) in `02-design/constitution/04-fiscal-system.md` and amendment of §17(f)(5) (whistleblower protection expansion). Drafted via multi-LLM protocol: briefing generated by coordinator with 5 enforcement gaps identified and 9 design questions, reviewed by 2 external LLMs. Reviewer 1 identified 2 High, 4 Medium, 2 Low findings. Reviewer 2 identified 3 structural findings with statistical context ($70B annual US corporate subsidies). Coordinator synthesized 7 agreements and 2 divergences. Human resolved both divergences plus added 4 additional design refinements (D10-D13). Convergence in 1 round.

### Problem

**Gap 93 (Race to Bottom):** The constitution comprehensively defines what Regions cannot do (§3(i) predatory prohibition, §3(j) relocation definition, §3(k) subsidy ceiling) and how to detect gaming (§3(g)-(h) reporting, §16 forensic audit, §17 IST), but does not specify what happens when a Region is caught engaging in predatory subsidy competition. The prohibition has no teeth: a Region violating §3(i) gains the industry, faces subsidy-neutrality adjustment (which it already anticipated and factored in), and pays no additional penalty. The ceiling in §3(k) has no enforcement consequences. Losing Regions have no petition mechanism and no path to compensation.

### Key Design Decisions

| ID | Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----|----------|--------|-----------|
| D1 | Placement | Expand §3 directly (§3(t)-(w)) | Rules + consequences in same section |
| D2 | Disclosure trigger | Materiality threshold ($10M / 0.01% GDP; IFC sets by rule) | Filters noise |
| D3 | Disclosure failure | Rebuttable presumption of predation | Changes incentives |
| D4 | Petition standing | Affected Region + IFC sua sponte | Regulatory safety net |
| D5 | Predation consequences | 3-year equalization deduction + transition costs; 200% annual cap | "Pay twice" deterrent; bounded |
| D6 | Ceiling enforcement | Hybrid: escrow + redistribute + freeze; capped at 200% | Compensate + penalize + freeze |
| D7 | Whistleblower | Extend §17(f)(5) to all fiscal integrity reporting | One-line expansion |
| D8 | Compacts | Leave statutory (Art I §5) | Sufficient existing authority |
| D9 | Firm repayment | No constitutional mandate; statutory/contractual | Avoids Takings litigation |
| D10 | Local attribution | Municipal/county subsidies attributed to Region | Closes laundering |
| D11 | In-kind scope | Land, infrastructure, training, regulatory waivers | Closes in-kind evasion |
| D12 | Functional relocation | 30% capacity/workforce in 36 months | Closes shell game |
| D13 | Emergency certifier | IFC sole certifier; 5% GDP contraction threshold | Prevents political abuse |

### Resolution

New subsections §3(t)-(w) added to Article X, Section 3 in 4 parts:

**Part 1 — Relocation Subsidy Disclosure (§3(t)):**

- §3(t)(1): Mandatory disclosure to IFC within 60 days of relocation; materiality threshold ($10M / 0.01% GDP, whichever less; IFC sets)
- §3(t)(2)(A): Functional relocation definition — 30% operational capacity or workforce transfer in 36 months, regardless of entity restructuring
- §3(t)(2)(B): Broad subsidy definition — tax expenditures, direct financial assistance, in-kind infrastructure, below-market land, targeted training, regulatory waivers
- §3(t)(2)(C): Local-government subsidy attribution to Region for disclosure, ceiling, and predation purposes
- §3(t)(3): Rebuttable presumption of predation for non-disclosure

**Part 2 — Predation Petition and Investigation (§3(u)):**

- §3(u)(1): Standing — affected Region or IFC sua sponte
- §3(u)(2): IFC investigation with 4-part factual report (subsidies, relocation condition, capital investment comparison, bidding war pattern)
- §3(u)(3): 120-day IFC investigation + 90-day ARB expedited hearing
- §3(u)(4): Presumptive predation for subsidies exceeding capital investment (rebuttable by clear and convincing evidence)

**Part 3 — Predation Finding Consequences (§3(v)):**

- §3(v)(1): 3-year equalization deduction equal to predatory subsidy amount
- §3(v)(2): Transition cost compensation (unemployment, tax base loss, infrastructure stranding)
- §3(v)(3): Additive to §3(f) subsidy-neutrality but capped at 200% of annualized subsidy value
- §3(v)(4): No constitutional firm repayment; Congress may establish statutory clawback

**Part 4 — Subsidy Ceiling Enforcement (§3(w)):**

- §3(w)(1): Excess placed in IFC-administered escrow
- §3(w)(2): Redistribution to Regions meeting minimum tax effort under §3(l)
- §3(w)(3): New subsidy program freeze until 2-year compliance
- §3(w)(4): IFC-only emergency exception (5% GDP contraction or natural disaster; no relocating-firm subsidies; 2-year max)
- §3(w)(5): Anti-double-counting — escrow IS the equalization adjustment for ceiling violations

**Whistleblower Protection (§17(f)(5) amendment):**

- Extended to cover "any person reporting suspected violations of this Article — including predatory subsidy activity, equalization manipulation, subsidy ceiling violations, or tax effort misrepresentation"

### Coverage Map

| Gap Component | Constitutional Coverage |
|---------------|----------------------|
| No enforcement teeth for §3(i) | Art X §3(u)-(v) — predation petition → IFC investigation → ARB finding → 3-year deduction + transition costs |
| No initiation path for affected Regions | Art X §3(u)(1) — affected Region or IFC sua sponte petition standing |
| No consequences for §3(k) ceiling violation | Art X §3(w) — escrow + redistribution + program freeze |
| Subsidy structuring to evade detection | Art X §3(t)(2)(A)-(C) — functional relocation (30%/36mo), broad subsidy definition, local-government attribution |
| No disclosure obligation at relocation | Art X §3(t)(1) — 60-day mandatory disclosure above materiality threshold |
| Non-disclosure gaming | Art X §3(t)(3) — rebuttable presumption of predation |
| Emergency exception abuse | Art X §3(w)(4) — IFC sole certifier; 5% GDP contraction; no relocating-firm subsidies |
| Double-counting risk | Art X §3(v)(3) — 200% annual cap; §3(w)(5) — escrow = adjustment |
| No whistleblower protection for subsidy reporting | Art X §17(f)(5) — expanded to all fiscal integrity reporting |

### Related Gaps

| Related Gap | Relationship |
|-------------|-------------|
| Gap 124 (Internal Tax Haven) | RESOLVED — 60-70% overlap; tax-policy gaming covered by §3(f)-(o); Gap 93 adds subsidy-specific enforcement |
| Gap 107 (Ghost Residency) | Proposal Available — 35-40% overlap; different vector (residency vs. subsidies); independent resolution |
| Gap 110 (Equalization Extortion) | Proposal Available — 20-25% overlap; formula update process; tangential |
| Gap 133 (Strategic Incompetence) | Proposal Available — 10-15% overlap; cost-side gaming; complementary |

## 2026-02-06: Gap 107 — Ghost Residency and Equalization Formula Gaming Marked RESOLVED (Already Integrated)

Gap 107 (Ghost Residency and Equalization Formula Gaming) found to be fully covered by existing Article X provisions. All four gaming vectors (ghost residency, tax haven within, corporate headquarters shell, service export) are blocked by structural constitutional mechanisms. The proposal's three-part solution (consumption-based capacity verification, residency manipulation prohibition, enforcement and accountability) maps entirely to existing provisions, with constitutional enforcement actually more severe than proposed (25%/5yr vs. 20%/3yr).

## 2026-02-06: Gap 31 — Criminal Justice Coordination Beyond Extradition Marked RESOLVED (Already Integrated)

Gap 31 (Criminal Justice Coordination Beyond Extradition) found to be fully covered by existing constitutional provisions. The proposal file itself explicitly states "No constitutional amendment required." All four gap components (sentence portability, criminal records, sex offender registry coordination, parole/probation transfer) are covered by existing Art I §12 law enforcement cooperation framework and supporting provisions. Remaining coordination details are appropriately statutory.

### Coverage Map

| Sex offender registry coordination | Art I §12(a) (cooperation mandate), §12(f) (no sanctuary), §12(r)-(w) (federal extradition enforcement) |
| Parole/probation supervision | Art I §12(a) (cooperation mandate), §12(i) (anti-evasion), §12(k) (ARB mediation), Art I §13 (compact authority) |
| Institutional enforcement | Art I §12(r)-(w) (federal escalation: notice → judicial order → marshals → contempt → receivership), Art IV §8-9 (conviction prerequisite, extradition shield) |

### Related Gaps
