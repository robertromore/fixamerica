## 2026-02-06: Gap 59 — State-Regional Preemption Deadlock Resolved (Article II, Section 25)

One intergovernmental gap resolved through new Article II, Section 25 (Regional-State Supremacy and Implementation) in `02-design/constitution/02-powers-and-rights.md`. Drafted via multi-LLM protocol: briefing generated by coordinator with overlap analysis (30% overlap) and 8 design questions, reviewed by 2 external LLMs. First reviewer integrated directly (bypassing protocol Step 3-6). Second reviewer identified 2 High, 2 Medium, 1 Low findings. Coordinator verified all claims, synthesized divergences, presented 5 design decisions to human. Human resolved all 5, coordinator applied corrections. Convergence in 1 effective round after corrections.

### Problem

**Gap 59 (State-Regional Preemption Deadlock):** The constitution declares Regional supremacy over State law (Article III §3(b)) but provides zero enforcement machinery. States can exercise a de facto veto over Regional policy through administrative non-compliance — refusing to issue permits, conduct environmental reviews, or process land use changes. Regional Exclusive Domains become "Domains in Name Only."

### Placement Correction

Original proposal targeted Article III §7(a-w). Corrected to Article II §25 for two reasons:

1. Article III §7 is occupied (Digital Habeas Corpus / Gap 209)
2. Article III is "Rights Floors and Subsidiarity" — wrong topical home; related resolved gaps (96, 114, 139, 265, 269) are all in Article II / II-RF

### Resolution

New Section 25 added to Article II with 23 subsections (a)-(w):

- **§25(a) Scope:** Operationalizes Art III §3(b) for Regional-State relations
- **§25(b) Tiered Classification:** Full Preemption / Cooperative Implementation / Concurrent Authority with ARB classification
- **§25(c) Federal Exclusive Domains:** Cross-reference to §1(e)(1) (not re-enumerated)
- **§25(d) Regional Development Banking:** Limited authority with non-discrimination floor via Art III §5 cross-reference and IFC lending pattern monitoring
- **§25(e) Default Classification:** Cooperative Implementation for Regional Exclusive Domains; Concurrent Authority for Structured Concurrent Domains
- **§25(f) Full Preemption Criteria:** Physical continuity, ineffectiveness of State variation, no reasonable flexibility — clear and convincing evidence standard
- **§25(g) Direct Implementation:** Eminent domain, permits, contracting, agencies — with scope limitation (g)(5) and National Necessity priority (g)(6) per §17(d)
- **§25(h)-(i) Cooperative Implementation:** Performance standards, 180-day State plans, ARB dispute resolution
- **§25(j) Funding:** 70/30 default split, IFC-adjudicated Disproportionate Burden petitions with IFC-published B/C methodology, anti-gaming provision
- **§25(k) Anti-Obstruction Ladder:** 90-day notice → 180-day withholding → 365-day direct implementation → reclassification
- **§25(l) Local Government Obstruction:** State responsibility; Gap 96 Local Autonomy Floor preserved for Cooperative/Concurrent domains via explicit Art II-RF §3 cross-reference
- **§25(m) "Working On It" Prohibition:** 24-month environmental review cap, 12-month permitting cap, constructive denial
- **§25(n) Cost Recovery:** 15% surcharge; Anti-Coercion Rule (Art X §4) not a defense
- **§25(o) Sovereign Immunity Waiver:** Self-executing, limited to this Section, reassertion is independent violation
- **§25(p)-(r) State Constitutional Challenge:** NCC jurisdiction, 60-day filing, no State-court stays; post-ratification strict scrutiny; anti-manipulation safeguards
- **§25(s) State Discretion:** Retained even in Full Preemption for local aspects and alternative methods
- **§25(t)-(u) Subsidiarity Review:** ARB petition with anti-centralization presumption; Region bears burden of proof
- **§25(v) Adversarial Fact-Finding:** Independent data collection, perjury certification, asymmetric factual sabotage penalties
- **§25(w) Filing Management:** Disputes count under §4-A limits; ARO procedures apply

### Additional Provisions

- **Article XVIII §3(e):** Formal definition of "National Constitutional Court" as the Supreme Court exercising constitutional review jurisdiction
- **Article III §3(b):** Forward reference to Art II §25 for enforcement mechanisms

### Design Decisions (10 total)

## 2026-02-06: Gap 60 — Para-Diplomacy Conflict Resolved (Article VI, Section 5)

One intergovernmental gap resolved through new Article VI, Section 5 (Structured Para-Diplomacy Framework) in `02-design/constitution/03-regional-governance.md`. Drafted via multi-LLM protocol: briefing generated by coordinator with overlap analysis (~45% overlap) and 8 design questions, reviewed by 2 external LLMs. Round 1 produced 11 findings (4 High, 5 Medium, 2 Low) and 5 new design decisions (D9a-D13). Round 2 confirmed all 16 corrections with 2 Medium and 2 Low residual findings. Convergence achieved in 2 rounds.

### Problem

**Gap 60 (Para-Diplomacy Conflict):** Regions are designed to manage cross-border realities (climate, labor, energy) but the Constitution grants the Federal government exclusive foreign policy authority (Art II §1; Art VI §4), creating a "Multiple Voices" crisis. The One Voice Doctrine (Art VI §4) is prohibition-only — it says what Regions cannot do but does not affirmatively authorize what they can do. The Treaty Power can be used as a backdoor to bypass the 60% House supermajority requirement for Regional Domain legislation.

### Placement Correction

Original proposal targeted Article I §9(a-cc). Corrected to Article VI §5 for two reasons:

1. Article I §9 is occupied (Mutual Recognition — professional credentials, family status portability)
2. Article I is "Regional Structure" — wrong topical home; Article VI is "Foreign Affairs and Regional Limitations" where the One Voice Doctrine (§4, Gap 266) already resides

### Resolution

New Section 5 added to Article VI with 30 subsections (a)-(dd) in 6 parts:

**Part 1 — Regional Foreign Engagement Authorization (a)-(d):**

- **§5(a) Authorized Engagement:** Transboundary coordination, treaty implementation, information sharing, emergency response — builds on §4(c) permitted activities
- **§5(b) Prohibited Engagement:** Cross-references Art VI §4(a-b) and Art I §5(f)-(h); adds binding commitments, recognition, diplomatic missions
- **§5(c) Notification:** 30-day State Department notification for substantive discussions, agreements, and proposals
- **§5(d) Facilitative Coordinator:** State Department designee with facilitative-only mandate; explicit anti-gatekeeping safeguards; auto-suspension by operation of law upon ARB finding of misconduct (D13)

**Part 2 — Treaty Consultation with Parallel Threshold (e)-(i):**

- **§5(e) Mandatory Consultation:** 90-day pre-signature draft text; written comment; consultation meeting
- **§5(f) Regional Impact Statement:** Submitted with treaty to Senate
- **§5(g) Parallel Threshold:** Pre-signature 60% House vote for treaties that would require 60% House if enacted domestically (D8); ARB certification with deemed-triggered default on inaction (D10); House inaction = deemed not approved (D10)
- **§5(h) Emergency Exception:** Presidential certification; 30-day House vote; no domestic effect on failure; once-per-Congress limit
- **§5(i) Anti-Circumvention:** 5-year lookback; characterization test; executive agreement notification with 30-day no-domestic-effect period (D12); cause of action with burden shift (D11)

**Part 3 — Conflict Resolution (j)-(o):**

- **§5(j) Supersession:** §4(d) procedures do not apply to §5 engagements (D9a)
- **§5(k)-(l) Procedural Verification:** ARB determines specific treaty contradiction, binding commitments, procedural compliance — NOT material impairment
- **§5(m) Material Impairment:** NCC in camera review with rehearing; classified materials and expert testimony (D4)
- **§5(n) Standard of Review:** ARB procedural (specific contradiction); NCC material (substantially undermine active initiative, concrete/demonstrable, no alternative means)
- **§5(o) Protected Activities:** Same subject matter, stricter standards, communication on Regional matters, policy preference expression

**Part 4 — National Security Exception (p)-(s):**

- **§5(p) Classified Negative-Key:** Secretary personal certification; 48-hour classified ARB briefing; 30-day temporary stay
- **§5(q) Standard:** Intelligence-supported; identified risk; specific to engagement
- **§5(r) In Camera Judicial Review:** NCC review; extend/permanent/lift options (D4)
- **§5(s) Anti-Abuse:** Personal certification; generic intelligence committee reporting (D2); 2-strike prior-approval rule; impeachment for false certification

**Part 5 — Foreign Influence Safeguards (t)-(y):**

- **§5(t) Funding Prohibition:** Cross-reference to §4(e-1) (D5); $100K in-kind threshold; infrastructure review; anti-favorable-terms
- **§5(u) IFC Valuation:** Self-contained authority (D7); market-rate, replacement cost, licensing fee methodologies; presumption of high value; anti-structuring
- **§5(v)-(w) Disclosure and Counterintelligence:** Annual reporting; cooperation requirement
- **§5(x) Foreign Capture Split:** ARB factual findings (undisclosed funding, counterintelligence refusal); NCC political determinations (coordinating against policy, Systemic Symbolic Contradiction) (D3); 5-year suspension
- **§5(y) Systemic Symbolic Contradiction:** Presidential declaration + Congressional majority within 30 days; 3-of-5 pattern; ARB Cease and Desist pending NCC determination

**Part 6 — Subnational Coordination (z)-(cc):**

- **§5(z) Authorization:** "Notwithstanding Art I §5(f)-(h)" — standards harmonization, emergency, environmental, infrastructure, cultural (D9b)
- **§5(aa) Limits:** No binding foreign national government; no tariff arrangements; no federal law violations
- **§5(bb) National Common Market Bridge:** Compatibility with Federal Floors; 60-day ARB review; ministerial equivalency pathway (90 days / $5,000 cap)
- **§5(cc) Model Agreements:** State Department published; presumed compliant

**Jurisdiction — §5(dd):** Explicit ARB jurisdiction grant; §4-A filing limits apply

### Cross-References Added

- **Art VI §4(c):** Forward reference to §5 for structured engagement framework
- **Art I §5(g):** Carve-out: "Except as authorized under Article VI, Section 5(z)"

### Design Decisions (13 total)

| ID | Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----|----------|--------|-----------|
| D1 | Placement | Art VI §5 standalone | Adjacent to One Voice Doctrine; foreign affairs article |
| D2 | Intelligence Committees | Generic language | Survives restructuring; constitutional pattern |
| D3 | Foreign Capture scope | ARB factual / NCC political split | Maintains procedural/material split |
| D4 | NCC classified proceedings | "In camera review" | Matches existing judicial practice |
| D5 | Overlap handling | Cross-reference existing prohibitions | Avoids duplication |
| D6 | Coordinator model | Two-track (prohibitive regulatory / facilitative diplomatic) | Matches risk profiles |
| D7 | IFC valuation authority | Self-contained in §5(u) | Cleaner than amending Art X §5 |
| D8 | Parallel Threshold scope | Only where 60% House needed domestically | Precisely targets backdoor |
| D9a | §4(d) conflict | Explicit supersession in §5(j) | Clean resolution |
| D9b | Art I §5(g) conflict | Both-direction carve-out | Bidirectional clarity |
| D10 | Default on inaction | ARB deemed triggered; House deemed not approved | Conservative defaults |
| D11 | Anti-circumvention | Cause of action with burden shift | Legally operative |
| D12 | Executive agreements | Notification + petition + no domestic effect until 30 days | Closes blind spot |
| D13 | Coordinator enforcement | Auto-suspension by operation of law | Self-executing |

### Reviewer Divergences Resolved

| Issue | Reviewer 1 | Reviewer 2 | Resolution |
|-------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| IFC placement (D7) | Centralize in Art X §5 | Self-contained in Art VI §5 | Human chose: self-contained (Option A) |

## 2026-02-06: Gap 54 — Expert Capture Marked RESOLVED (Already Integrated in Art II §7)

Gap 54 (Expert Capture / Administrative Law Variation and Due Process) found to be fully integrated into Art II §7 (Allocation Review Board). All five parts of the proposed Adversarial Governance framework were already present: Part 1 Compositional Safeguards (§7(b)-(f)), Part 2 Adversarial Review Office (§7(s)-(v)), Part 3 Regional Override (§7(w)-(y)), Part 4 Systematic Bias Detection (§7(z)-(bb)), Part 5 Budgetary Independence (§7(cc)-(ee)), plus Anti-Consolidation Safeguards (§7(ff)-(ff-4)).

## 2026-02-06: Gap 58 — Geographic Defense Penalty Resolved (Article XI-RF, Section 8)

One intergovernmental gap resolved through new Article XI-RF, Section 8 (Defense Burden Equalization Framework) in `02-design/constitution/10-armed-forces.md`. Drafted via multi-LLM protocol: briefing generated by coordinator with overlap analysis (~25% overlap) and 8 design questions, reviewed by 2 external LLMs. Round 1 produced 7 findings (3 High, 3 Medium, 1 Low) and 4 new design decisions (D9-D12). Round 2 confirmed all 15 corrections with 4 Medium and 3 Low residual findings. Convergence achieved in 2 rounds.

### Problem

**Gap 58 (Geographic Defense Penalty):** The Three-Tier armed forces structure creates an unacknowledged fiscal asymmetry where border and coastal Regions bear disproportionate defense costs while interior Regions enjoy "free rider" benefits. Pacific Region has 7,600+ miles of coastline; South has the entire southern border (~1,900 miles); Plains and Heartland have no international borders.

### Placement Correction

Original proposal targeted Art XI §11. Corrected to Art XI-RF §8 because existing sections only go to §7 (Cyber Operations); §8 is the next available section number.

### Resolution

New Section 8 added to Art XI-RF with 21 subsections (a)-(u) in 6 parts, plus §6(b) forward reference for defense/disaster track separation:

**Part 1 — Defense Burden Assessment (a)-(d):**

- **§8(a) Annual Calculation:** DoD provides threat data (border miles, coastline, critical infrastructure, Threat Environment Assessment including Hostile Intent and Mobilization factor); IFC calculates Defense Burden Index; DoD has no authority over final fiscal determinations
- **§8(b) Deterrence Credit:** 10% bonus for 3 years for measurable improvement; not reduced for adversary buildup in response to effective deterrence
- **§8(c) National Defense Baseline:** Minimum capacity, Excess Defense Burden, Shared Benefit Infrastructure categories
- **§8(d) Methodology Transparency:** Published, ARB-reviewed for objectivity, 5-year update cycle

**Part 2 — Defense Equalization Fund (e)-(h):**

- **§8(e) Establishment:** Federal capitalization for 3 years; Regional phase-in years 4-5
- **§8(f) Contributions:** 40% equal per-Region base + 60% fiscal capacity proportional
- **§8(g) Disbursements:** Excess Burden, Shared Benefit maintenance, surge capacity
- **§8(h) Limits:** 150% cap over 5 years; emergency override via Presidential declaration + Congressional majority; emergency powers cross-reference

**Part 3 — Minimum Readiness and Mutual Aid (i)-(m):**

- **§8(i) Minimum Readiness:** Category 3 disaster response, interoperability certification, annual multi-Regional exercise
- **§8(j) Standing Defense Mutual Aid Compact:** Separate defense/disaster tracks; "qualifying defense emergency" defined; Governor authorization required; rebuttable presumption; ARB refusal review; anti-commandeering (30-day limit + Congressional certification for 30-90 day extensions)
- **§8(k) Cost-Sharing:** 60% requesting Region, 40% DBEF for deployments >14 days
- **§8(l) Free Rider Penalty:** Non-Coercion Standard does not apply (germane to compact); suspension of aid and disbursements
- **§8(m) Readiness Certification:** ARB annual ministerial function; field-verified exercises

**Part 4 — Shared Benefit Infrastructure (n)-(p):**

- **§8(n) Designation:** Presidential nomination + ARB certification (clear and convincing evidence) + NCC de novo review; national-scope assets presumptively qualify; regional-scope requires adjacency or demonstrable benefit; 10-year sunset; 5-year challenge
- **§8(o) Cost Allocation:** 70/30 construction, 60/40 operating
- **§8(p) Access Guarantee:** Triple Lock for federal operational assumption (ARB + NCC + Congress)

**Part 5 — Anti-Gaming (q)-(s):**

- **§8(q) Prohibited Burden Inflation:** Artificial inflation, misclassification, incident manipulation; 20% excess threshold with prior certification
- **§8(r) Audit Authority:** GAO biennial audits
- **§8(s) Penalty:** Repayment + 25% penalty + 5-year enhanced scrutiny + prosecution referral

**Part 6 — Coordination and Savings (t)-(u):**

- **§8(t) National Necessity Savings Clause:** Art II §17 not limited; no Triple Lock required for National Necessity access
- **§8(u) IFC Methodology:** IFC data primacy; ARB reviews objectivity not fiscal methodology

### Cross-References Added

- **Art XI-RF §6(b):** Forward reference to §8 for defense-related mutual aid

### Design Decisions (12 total)

| ID | Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----|----------|--------|-----------|
| D1 | Mutual aid duration | Separate defense/disaster tracks with Congressional certification for 30-90 day extensions | Preserves existing §6(b) for disaster; defense needs longer windows |
| D2 | National Necessity deconfliction | Savings clause; DBEF does not limit Art II §17 | Existing NNE already has its own safeguards |
| D3 | Non-Coercion Standard | Belt-and-suspenders (explicit carve-out + germaneness argument) | Conservative approach for constitutional certainty |
| D4 | Cost allocation | 70/30 construction, 60/40 operating | Host Region retains operational control |
| D5 | DoD fiscal role | DoD provides threat data only; IFC calculates; DoD has no final fiscal authority | Prevents executive branch fiscal capture |
| D6 | Institutional placement | IFC fiscal, ARB objectivity, DoD threat data | Three-body separation of functions |
| D7 | Deterrence Credit cap | No cap; not reduced for adversary buildup | Prevents perverse penalty for success |
| D8 | Excess capacity threshold | 20% above Minimum Readiness with prior certification | Blocks gold-plating while allowing reasonable cushion |
| D9 | Standing Compact | All Regions auto-enrolled; no opt-out | Defense is non-excludable public good |
| D10 | Hostile Intent factor | Explicit inclusion in Threat Environment Assessment | Closes deterrence paradox feedback loop |
| D11 | Geographic scope test | National-scope presumptive; regional-scope requires adjacency or demonstrable benefit | Prevents abuse while covering genuine cases |
| D12 | Filing management | SBI challenges count under §4-A; readiness certification ministerial (exempt) | Prevents ARB overload |

### Reviewer Divergences Resolved

| Issue | Reviewer 1 | Reviewer 2 | Resolution |
|-------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Mutual aid duration (D1) | Align at 30 days for both tracks | Separate tracks with Congressional certification | Human chose: separate tracks (Option B) |
| DoD fiscal role (D5) | Remove DoD from fiscal process | Limit to data provision | Both agree DoD must not control transfers |
| Deterrence feedback loop (D10) | Not identified | Hostile Intent factor needed | Added per R2 recommendation |

## 2026-02-06: Gap 25 — Climate Emergency Coordination Marked RESOLVED (Already Integrated)

Gap 25 (Climate Emergency Coordination) found to be fully covered by existing constitutional provisions across four articles. The proposal file (`proposals/05-environment-infrastructure/climate-emergency-coordination.md`) itself confirms: "Constitutional amendment is not required; the framework uses existing constitutional authorities." All four gap components mapped to existing text; remaining elements are appropriately statutory.

Also corrected description mismatch in `00-index.md` (previously listed as "Cross-regional water rights during scarcity" — actual scope is broader climate emergency coordination).

### Coverage Map

| Gap Component | Constitutional Coverage |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Water scarcity allocation | Art I §7 (WRCB, National Water Court, equitable apportionment) |
| Emergency resource access | Art I §11(m) (declaration, anti-hoarding, treble damages, fair market compensation) |
| Environmental coordination | Art I §11(a)-(j) (transboundary harm, cumulative impact, shared ecosystems, carrying capacity) |
| Climate migration | Art I §8(f)-(m) (Migration Surge Stabilization, 3% trigger, automatic fiscal transfers) |
| Catastrophic displacement | Art XVII-RF §5 (IFC-certified declaration, voluntary allocation, Climate Displacement Reserve) |
| Carbon policy coordination | Art I §5 (inter-regional cooperation compact authority — statutory) |
| Adaptation infrastructure | Art I §5A (joint authority template — statutory) |
| Resource-restrictive standards | Art I §11(k) (certification, 4-part proportionality test, pretext finding) |

## 2026-02-06: Gap 130 — Audit-Capacity Freeze of the National Election Court Resolved (Article VII, Section 11)

One electoral/judicial gap resolved through new Article VII, Section 11 (NEC Operational Independence) in `02-design/single-topic/election-reform.md` and amendment of Article XIV-RF §2(b) from "may" to "shall" in `02-design/constitution/09-judiciary.md`. Drafted via multi-LLM protocol: briefing generated by coordinator with overlap analysis (35% overlap with ARB budget template and Gap 87) and 8 design questions, reviewed by 2 external LLMs. Reviewer 1 identified 2 High, 2 Medium, 2 Low findings. Reviewer 2 identified 2 High, 2 Medium findings. Coordinator synthesized 5 agreements and 3 divergences, presented to human for resolution. Human resolved all 3 divergences. Convergence in 1 round.

### Problem

**Gap 130 (Audit-Capacity Freeze):** The NEC has extensive mandatory functions (48-hour emergency panels, 14-day preliminary determinations, 28-day final determinations, Day 66 audit, obstruction findings, redistricting compliance) but zero constitutional operational capacity guarantees. A hostile Congress could zero out investigative staff while preserving judicial salaries, creating a "skeleton court" that cannot investigate fraud, audit counts, or evaluate evidence within required timelines.

### Placement Correction

Original proposal targeted Article XIV-RF, Section 5. Corrected to Article VII, Section 11 for three reasons:

1. Art XIV-RF §5 is occupied (Standing to Enforce the Constitution — Gaps 247, 175)
2. Art XIV-RF §6 is occupied (Shadow Stay Prevention — Gap 111)
3. All NEC powers and procedures are in Article VII (§§7-8, 10); operational capacity belongs with the powers it supports

### Budget Calibration Correction

Original proposal set budget floor at 0.05% of federal revenue (~$2.5B). This was 25x the ARB budget and comparable to a quarter of the FBI's entire budget — grossly miscalibrated for election forensics. Corrected to 0.002% base (~$100M) with automatic surge to 0.005% (~$250M) during federal general election years.

### Key Design Decisions

| ID | Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----|----------|--------|-----------|
| D1 | Placement | Art VII §11 | Co-locate with NEC powers |
| D2 | Budget model | ARB pattern (fixed %) | Proven constitutional template |
| D3 | Gap 87 interaction | Self-contained + savings clause | Election integrity too critical to depend on unresolved gap |
| D4 | Budget floor | 0.002% base / 0.005% election surge | Covers presidential + midterm; avoids off-year over-funding |
| D5 | NEC establishment | Amend "may" to "shall" | Mandatory existence required for mandatory jurisdiction |
| D6 | Investigative authority | Permanent staff + private experts; NO requisition | Eliminates separation-of-powers risk |
| D7 | Staffing | Budget + GAO fiscal adequacy | GAO certifies fiscal adequacy, not headcounts |
| D8 | Internal allocation | Chief proposes / panel approves / GAO audits | Three-layer defense against capture |

### Resolution

New Section 11 added to Article VII with 15 subsections (a)-(o) in 4 parts:

**Part 1 — NEC Budget Floor (a)-(d):**

- §11(a): Dedicated budget — 0.002% of federal revenue (base); 0.005% in federal general election years
