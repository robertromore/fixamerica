## 2026-02-06: Gap 59 — State-Regional Preemption Deadlock Resolved (Article II, Section 25)

One intergovernmental gap resolved through new Article II, Section 25 (Regional-State Supremacy and Implementation) in `02-design/constitution/02-powers-and-rights.md`. Drafted via multi-LLM protocol: briefing generated by coordinator with overlap analysis (30% overlap) and 8 design questions, reviewed by 2 external LLMs. First reviewer integrated directly (bypassing protocol Step 3-6). Second reviewer identified 2 High, 2 Medium, 1 Low findings. Coordinator verified all claims, synthesized divergences, presented 5 design decisions to human. Human resolved all 5, coordinator applied corrections. Convergence in 1 effective round after corrections.

### Problem

**Gap 59 (State-Regional Preemption Deadlock):** The constitution declares Regional supremacy over State law (Article III §3(b)) but provides zero enforcement machinery. States can exercise a de facto veto over Regional policy through administrative non-compliance — refusing to issue permits, conduct environmental reviews, or process land use changes. Regional Exclusive Domains become "Domains in Name Only."

### Placement Correction

Original proposal targeted Article III §7(a-w). Corrected to Article II §25 for two reasons:

1. Article III §7 is occupied (Digital Habeas Corpus / Gap 209)
2. Article III is "Rights Floors and Subsidiarity" — wrong topical home; related resolved gaps (96, 114, 139, 265, 269) are all in Article II / II-RF

### Resolution

New Section 25 added to Article II with 23 subsections (a)-(w):

- **§25(a) Scope:** Operationalizes Art III §3(b) for Regional-State relations
- **§25(b) Tiered Classification:** Full Preemption / Cooperative Implementation / Concurrent Authority with ARB classification
- **§25(c) Federal Exclusive Domains:** Cross-reference to §1(e)(1) (not re-enumerated)
- **§25(d) Regional Development Banking:** Limited authority with non-discrimination floor via Art III §5 cross-reference and IFC lending pattern monitoring
- **§25(e) Default Classification:** Cooperative Implementation for Regional Exclusive Domains; Concurrent Authority for Structured Concurrent Domains
- **§25(f) Full Preemption Criteria:** Physical continuity, ineffectiveness of State variation, no reasonable flexibility — clear and convincing evidence standard
- **§25(g) Direct Implementation:** Eminent domain, permits, contracting, agencies — with scope limitation (g)(5) and National Necessity priority (g)(6) per §17(d)
- **§25(h)-(i) Cooperative Implementation:** Performance standards, 180-day State plans, ARB dispute resolution
- **§25(j) Funding:** 70/30 default split, IFC-adjudicated Disproportionate Burden petitions with IFC-published B/C methodology, anti-gaming provision
- **§25(k) Anti-Obstruction Ladder:** 90-day notice → 180-day withholding → 365-day direct implementation → reclassification
- **§25(l) Local Government Obstruction:** State responsibility; Gap 96 Local Autonomy Floor preserved for Cooperative/Concurrent domains via explicit Art II-RF §3 cross-reference
- **§25(m) "Working On It" Prohibition:** 24-month environmental review cap, 12-month permitting cap, constructive denial
- **§25(n) Cost Recovery:** 15% surcharge; Anti-Coercion Rule (Art X §4) not a defense
- **§25(o) Sovereign Immunity Waiver:** Self-executing, limited to this Section, reassertion is independent violation
- **§25(p)-(r) State Constitutional Challenge:** NCC jurisdiction, 60-day filing, no State-court stays; post-ratification strict scrutiny; anti-manipulation safeguards
- **§25(s) State Discretion:** Retained even in Full Preemption for local aspects and alternative methods
- **§25(t)-(u) Subsidiarity Review:** ARB petition with anti-centralization presumption; Region bears burden of proof
- **§25(v) Adversarial Fact-Finding:** Independent data collection, perjury certification, asymmetric factual sabotage penalties
- **§25(w) Filing Management:** Disputes count under §4-A limits; ARO procedures apply

### Additional Provisions

- **Article XVIII §3(e):** Formal definition of "National Constitutional Court" as the Supreme Court exercising constitutional review jurisdiction
- **Article III §3(b):** Forward reference to Art II §25 for enforcement mechanisms

### Design Decisions (10 total)

| ID | Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----|----------|--------|-----------|
| D1 | Placement | Art II §25 standalone | Scope warrants standalone; related gaps all in Art II |
| D2 | Federal Exclusive Domains | Cross-reference to §1(e)(1) | Avoids dual-entry maintenance risk |
| D3 | NCC terminology | Keep NCC; define in Art XVIII §3(e) | NCC appears corpus-wide; selective rename creates inconsistency |
| D4 | Gap 96 harmonization | Explicit cross-reference; Full Preemption overrides; Cooperative/Concurrent preserve Local Autonomy Floor | Tiered interaction resolves catch-22 |
| D5 | Fiscal methodology | Delegate B/C ratio methodology to IFC | Avoids hard-coding assumptions |
| D6 | Sovereign immunity | Standalone waiver in §25(o) | Extends existing §4(r)(4) pattern |
| D7 | ARB caseload | Defer to §4-A provisions | Existing caps/consolidation/hardship apply via §25(w) |
| D8 | National Necessity conflict | Federal wins with §17(d) accommodation | Consistent with existing framework |
| D9 | Mediation | No additional cooling-off | §25(k) already provides 90+90 day runway |
| D10 | Bank non-discrimination | Cross-reference Art III §5 + IFC monitoring | Existing protections bind; IFC monitors lending patterns |

### Reviewer Divergences Resolved

| Issue | Reviewer 1 | Reviewer 2 | Resolution |
|-------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| NCC terminology | Keep NCC, add definition | Change to "Supreme Court" | Human chose: keep NCC, add definition |
| Bank non-discrimination | Cross-reference existing protections | Add specific non-discrimination floor | Human chose: cross-reference + IFC monitoring |
| Gap 96 harmonization | Savings clause (partial) | Explicit cross-reference (full) | Both agree on explicit; coordinator strengthened |
