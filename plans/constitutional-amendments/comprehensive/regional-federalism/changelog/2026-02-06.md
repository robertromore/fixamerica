## 2026-02-06: Gap 59 — State-Regional Preemption Deadlock Resolved (Article II, Section 25)

One intergovernmental gap resolved through new Article II, Section 25 (Regional-State Supremacy and Implementation) in `02-design/constitution/02-powers-and-rights.md`. Drafted via multi-LLM protocol: briefing generated by coordinator with overlap analysis (30% overlap) and 8 design questions, reviewed by 2 external LLMs. First reviewer integrated directly (bypassing protocol Step 3-6). Second reviewer identified 2 High, 2 Medium, 1 Low findings. Coordinator verified all claims, synthesized divergences, presented 5 design decisions to human. Human resolved all 5, coordinator applied corrections. Convergence in 1 effective round after corrections.

### Problem

**Gap 59 (State-Regional Preemption Deadlock):** The constitution declares Regional supremacy over State law (Article III §3(b)) but provides zero enforcement machinery. States can exercise a de facto veto over Regional policy through administrative non-compliance — refusing to issue permits, conduct environmental reviews, or process land use changes. Regional Exclusive Domains become "Domains in Name Only."

### Placement Correction

Original proposal targeted Article III §7(a-w). Corrected to Article II §25 for two reasons:

1. Article III §7 is occupied (Digital Habeas Corpus / Gap 209)
2. Article III is "Rights Floors and Subsidiarity" — wrong topical home; related resolved gaps (96, 114, 139, 265, 269) are all in Article II / II-RF

### Resolution

New Section 25 added to Article II with 23 subsections (a)-(w):

- **§25(a) Scope:** Operationalizes Art III §3(b) for Regional-State relations
- **§25(b) Tiered Classification:** Full Preemption / Cooperative Implementation / Concurrent Authority with ARB classification
- **§25(c) Federal Exclusive Domains:** Cross-reference to §1(e)(1) (not re-enumerated)
- **§25(d) Regional Development Banking:** Limited authority with non-discrimination floor via Art III §5 cross-reference and IFC lending pattern monitoring
- **§25(e) Default Classification:** Cooperative Implementation for Regional Exclusive Domains; Concurrent Authority for Structured Concurrent Domains
- **§25(f) Full Preemption Criteria:** Physical continuity, ineffectiveness of State variation, no reasonable flexibility — clear and convincing evidence standard
- **§25(g) Direct Implementation:** Eminent domain, permits, contracting, agencies — with scope limitation (g)(5) and National Necessity priority (g)(6) per §17(d)
- **§25(h)-(i) Cooperative Implementation:** Performance standards, 180-day State plans, ARB dispute resolution
- **§25(j) Funding:** 70/30 default split, IFC-adjudicated Disproportionate Burden petitions with IFC-published B/C methodology, anti-gaming provision
- **§25(k) Anti-Obstruction Ladder:** 90-day notice → 180-day withholding → 365-day direct implementation → reclassification
- **§25(l) Local Government Obstruction:** State responsibility; Gap 96 Local Autonomy Floor preserved for Cooperative/Concurrent domains via explicit Art II-RF §3 cross-reference
- **§25(m) "Working On It" Prohibition:** 24-month environmental review cap, 12-month permitting cap, constructive denial
- **§25(n) Cost Recovery:** 15% surcharge; Anti-Coercion Rule (Art X §4) not a defense
- **§25(o) Sovereign Immunity Waiver:** Self-executing, limited to this Section, reassertion is independent violation
- **§25(p)-(r) State Constitutional Challenge:** NCC jurisdiction, 60-day filing, no State-court stays; post-ratification strict scrutiny; anti-manipulation safeguards
- **§25(s) State Discretion:** Retained even in Full Preemption for local aspects and alternative methods
- **§25(t)-(u) Subsidiarity Review:** ARB petition with anti-centralization presumption; Region bears burden of proof
- **§25(v) Adversarial Fact-Finding:** Independent data collection, perjury certification, asymmetric factual sabotage penalties
- **§25(w) Filing Management:** Disputes count under §4-A limits; ARO procedures apply

### Additional Provisions

- **Article XVIII §3(e):** Formal definition of "National Constitutional Court" as the Supreme Court exercising constitutional review jurisdiction
- **Article III §3(b):** Forward reference to Art II §25 for enforcement mechanisms

### Design Decisions (10 total)

| ID | Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----|----------|--------|-----------|
| D1 | Placement | Art II §25 standalone | Scope warrants standalone; related gaps all in Art II |
| D2 | Federal Exclusive Domains | Cross-reference to §1(e)(1) | Avoids dual-entry maintenance risk |
| D3 | NCC terminology | Keep NCC; define in Art XVIII §3(e) | NCC appears corpus-wide; selective rename creates inconsistency |
| D4 | Gap 96 harmonization | Explicit cross-reference; Full Preemption overrides; Cooperative/Concurrent preserve Local Autonomy Floor | Tiered interaction resolves catch-22 |
| D5 | Fiscal methodology | Delegate B/C ratio methodology to IFC | Avoids hard-coding assumptions |
| D6 | Sovereign immunity | Standalone waiver in §25(o) | Extends existing §4(r)(4) pattern |
| D7 | ARB caseload | Defer to §4-A provisions | Existing caps/consolidation/hardship apply via §25(w) |
| D8 | National Necessity conflict | Federal wins with §17(d) accommodation | Consistent with existing framework |
| D9 | Mediation | No additional cooling-off | §25(k) already provides 90+90 day runway |
| D10 | Bank non-discrimination | Cross-reference Art III §5 + IFC monitoring | Existing protections bind; IFC monitors lending patterns |

### Reviewer Divergences Resolved

| Issue | Reviewer 1 | Reviewer 2 | Resolution |
|-------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| NCC terminology | Keep NCC, add definition | Change to "Supreme Court" | Human chose: keep NCC, add definition |
| Bank non-discrimination | Cross-reference existing protections | Add specific non-discrimination floor | Human chose: cross-reference + IFC monitoring |
| Gap 96 harmonization | Savings clause (partial) | Explicit cross-reference (full) | Both agree on explicit; coordinator strengthened |

## 2026-02-06: Gap 60 — Para-Diplomacy Conflict Resolved (Article VI, Section 5)

One intergovernmental gap resolved through new Article VI, Section 5 (Structured Para-Diplomacy Framework) in `02-design/constitution/03-regional-governance.md`. Drafted via multi-LLM protocol: briefing generated by coordinator with overlap analysis (~45% overlap) and 8 design questions, reviewed by 2 external LLMs. Round 1 produced 11 findings (4 High, 5 Medium, 2 Low) and 5 new design decisions (D9a-D13). Round 2 confirmed all 16 corrections with 2 Medium and 2 Low residual findings. Convergence achieved in 2 rounds.

### Problem

**Gap 60 (Para-Diplomacy Conflict):** Regions are designed to manage cross-border realities (climate, labor, energy) but the Constitution grants the Federal government exclusive foreign policy authority (Art II §1; Art VI §4), creating a "Multiple Voices" crisis. The One Voice Doctrine (Art VI §4) is prohibition-only — it says what Regions cannot do but does not affirmatively authorize what they can do. The Treaty Power can be used as a backdoor to bypass the 60% House supermajority requirement for Regional Domain legislation.

### Placement Correction

Original proposal targeted Article I §9(a-cc). Corrected to Article VI §5 for two reasons:

1. Article I §9 is occupied (Mutual Recognition — professional credentials, family status portability)
2. Article I is "Regional Structure" — wrong topical home; Article VI is "Foreign Affairs and Regional Limitations" where the One Voice Doctrine (§4, Gap 266) already resides

### Resolution

New Section 5 added to Article VI with 30 subsections (a)-(dd) in 6 parts:

**Part 1 — Regional Foreign Engagement Authorization (a)-(d):**

- **§5(a) Authorized Engagement:** Transboundary coordination, treaty implementation, information sharing, emergency response — builds on §4(c) permitted activities
- **§5(b) Prohibited Engagement:** Cross-references Art VI §4(a-b) and Art I §5(f)-(h); adds binding commitments, recognition, diplomatic missions
- **§5(c) Notification:** 30-day State Department notification for substantive discussions, agreements, and proposals
- **§5(d) Facilitative Coordinator:** State Department designee with facilitative-only mandate; explicit anti-gatekeeping safeguards; auto-suspension by operation of law upon ARB finding of misconduct (D13)

**Part 2 — Treaty Consultation with Parallel Threshold (e)-(i):**

- **§5(e) Mandatory Consultation:** 90-day pre-signature draft text; written comment; consultation meeting
- **§5(f) Regional Impact Statement:** Submitted with treaty to Senate
- **§5(g) Parallel Threshold:** Pre-signature 60% House vote for treaties that would require 60% House if enacted domestically (D8); ARB certification with deemed-triggered default on inaction (D10); House inaction = deemed not approved (D10)
- **§5(h) Emergency Exception:** Presidential certification; 30-day House vote; no domestic effect on failure; once-per-Congress limit
- **§5(i) Anti-Circumvention:** 5-year lookback; characterization test; executive agreement notification with 30-day no-domestic-effect period (D12); cause of action with burden shift (D11)

**Part 3 — Conflict Resolution (j)-(o):**

- **§5(j) Supersession:** §4(d) procedures do not apply to §5 engagements (D9a)
- **§5(k)-(l) Procedural Verification:** ARB determines specific treaty contradiction, binding commitments, procedural compliance — NOT material impairment
- **§5(m) Material Impairment:** NCC in camera review with rehearing; classified materials and expert testimony (D4)
- **§5(n) Standard of Review:** ARB procedural (specific contradiction); NCC material (substantially undermine active initiative, concrete/demonstrable, no alternative means)
- **§5(o) Protected Activities:** Same subject matter, stricter standards, communication on Regional matters, policy preference expression

**Part 4 — National Security Exception (p)-(s):**

- **§5(p) Classified Negative-Key:** Secretary personal certification; 48-hour classified ARB briefing; 30-day temporary stay
- **§5(q) Standard:** Intelligence-supported; identified risk; specific to engagement
- **§5(r) In Camera Judicial Review:** NCC review; extend/permanent/lift options (D4)
- **§5(s) Anti-Abuse:** Personal certification; generic intelligence committee reporting (D2); 2-strike prior-approval rule; impeachment for false certification

**Part 5 — Foreign Influence Safeguards (t)-(y):**

- **§5(t) Funding Prohibition:** Cross-reference to §4(e-1) (D5); $100K in-kind threshold; infrastructure review; anti-favorable-terms
- **§5(u) IFC Valuation:** Self-contained authority (D7); market-rate, replacement cost, licensing fee methodologies; presumption of high value; anti-structuring
- **§5(v)-(w) Disclosure and Counterintelligence:** Annual reporting; cooperation requirement
- **§5(x) Foreign Capture Split:** ARB factual findings (undisclosed funding, counterintelligence refusal); NCC political determinations (coordinating against policy, Systemic Symbolic Contradiction) (D3); 5-year suspension
- **§5(y) Systemic Symbolic Contradiction:** Presidential declaration + Congressional majority within 30 days; 3-of-5 pattern; ARB Cease and Desist pending NCC determination

**Part 6 — Subnational Coordination (z)-(cc):**

- **§5(z) Authorization:** "Notwithstanding Art I §5(f)-(h)" — standards harmonization, emergency, environmental, infrastructure, cultural (D9b)
- **§5(aa) Limits:** No binding foreign national government; no tariff arrangements; no federal law violations
- **§5(bb) National Common Market Bridge:** Compatibility with Federal Floors; 60-day ARB review; ministerial equivalency pathway (90 days / $5,000 cap)
- **§5(cc) Model Agreements:** State Department published; presumed compliant

**Jurisdiction — §5(dd):** Explicit ARB jurisdiction grant; §4-A filing limits apply

### Cross-References Added

- **Art VI §4(c):** Forward reference to §5 for structured engagement framework
- **Art I §5(g):** Carve-out: "Except as authorized under Article VI, Section 5(z)"

### Design Decisions (13 total)

| ID | Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----|----------|--------|-----------|
| D1 | Placement | Art VI §5 standalone | Adjacent to One Voice Doctrine; foreign affairs article |
| D2 | Intelligence Committees | Generic language | Survives restructuring; constitutional pattern |
| D3 | Foreign Capture scope | ARB factual / NCC political split | Maintains procedural/material split |
| D4 | NCC classified proceedings | "In camera review" | Matches existing judicial practice |
| D5 | Overlap handling | Cross-reference existing prohibitions | Avoids duplication |
| D6 | Coordinator model | Two-track (prohibitive regulatory / facilitative diplomatic) | Matches risk profiles |
| D7 | IFC valuation authority | Self-contained in §5(u) | Cleaner than amending Art X §5 |
| D8 | Parallel Threshold scope | Only where 60% House needed domestically | Precisely targets backdoor |
| D9a | §4(d) conflict | Explicit supersession in §5(j) | Clean resolution |
| D9b | Art I §5(g) conflict | Both-direction carve-out | Bidirectional clarity |
| D10 | Default on inaction | ARB deemed triggered; House deemed not approved | Conservative defaults |
| D11 | Anti-circumvention | Cause of action with burden shift | Legally operative |
| D12 | Executive agreements | Notification + petition + no domestic effect until 30 days | Closes blind spot |
| D13 | Coordinator enforcement | Auto-suspension by operation of law | Self-executing |

### Reviewer Divergences Resolved

| Issue | Reviewer 1 | Reviewer 2 | Resolution |
|-------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| IFC placement (D7) | Centralize in Art X §5 | Self-contained in Art VI §5 | Human chose: self-contained (Option A) |
