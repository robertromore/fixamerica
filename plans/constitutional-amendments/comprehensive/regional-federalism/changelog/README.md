The original `../CHANGELOG.md` became unwieldy at 4100+ lines. This dated structure provides:

- **Easier navigation** - Find changes by specific date
- **Better performance** - Smaller files load faster
- **Cleaner organization** - Related changes grouped together
- **Preserved history** - No information lost in the reorganization
