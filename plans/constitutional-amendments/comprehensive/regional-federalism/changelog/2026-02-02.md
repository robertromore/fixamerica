## 2026-02-02: Gap 199 — Family Fracture (Status Portability) Resolved (Article I §9, §10)

Resolved Gap 199 (Family Fracture / Status Portability) through Art I §9(b) expanded enumeration, six new subsections Art I §9(v)-(aa), and Art I §10(a)(4) vital statistics expansion in `02-design/constitution/01-regional-structure.md`. This was the thirty-ninth "Requires Development" gap resolved through the multi-LLM review process on 2026-02-01/02-02.

### Problem

Regions control family law within their Exclusive Domains (Art II §1(e)(2)(iv)). A Region could refuse to recognize marriages, adoptions, or parentage established in other Regions, effectively dissolving families when they cross Regional borders. Pre-*Obergefell*, same-sex couples faced exactly this reality. The adoption variant is more severe: a parent legally adopts in Region A; Region B refuses recognition; the parent loses parental rights; the child becomes a legal orphan. Art I §9(b) mandated recognition of marriages, divorces, adoptions, and name changes, but did not define "recognition" as including all legal incidents, did not enumerate civil unions/domestic partnerships/parentage/surrogacy, and did not address the Exclusive Domain tension with Art II §1(e)(2)(iv).

### Resolution Approach

**Placement:** Art I §9 (Mutual Recognition) — consolidates all recognition provisions in existing framework rather than creating new Art III-RF §8. Six new subsections plus amendments to §9(b) and §10(a)(4).

**External review convergence:** Two independent reviewers converged on all 13 design questions plus 2 additional questions. Full agreement on: expanded enumeration with catch-all (D2-D), full incidents with equivalence principle (D3-C), explicit Exclusive Domain limitation (D4-A), enumerated anti-discrimination (D5-A), validity-from-establishing/incidents-from-residence conflict of laws (D6-A), strengthened children's protection with adoption finality (D7-B+D), automatic provisional recognition plus expedited judicial remedy (D8-D), explicit selective recognition prohibition with anti-circumvention (D9-D), vital records through existing §10 expansion (D10-B), explicit retroactivity plus anti-nullification (D11-C), combination enforcement (D12-D), multi-Regional family recognition (D13-A).

### Constitutional Text Changes

**Art I §9(b) — Expanded Enumeration:**

- Added: civil unions, domestic partnerships, parentage determinations, surrogacy agreements, custody orders, guardianship orders

- Equivalence principle: recognized status receives same incidents as most comparable in-Region status
- Selective recognition prohibited
- Re-characterization to lesser legal category prohibited
- Functional non-recognition through procedural barriers prohibited

**Art I §9(w) — Continuity of Parentage:**

- Parent-child relationship inviolable once established by birth, adoption, parentage determination, surrogacy agreement, or court order

- No child may be rendered a legal orphan through interstate relocation
- Termination only through due process in court with jurisdiction
- Custody orders and child support orders enforceable across Regional borders

**Art I §9(x) — Conflict of Laws:**

- Validity governed by establishing Region
- Incidents governed by residence Region but may not extinguish the fundamental legal relationship or discriminate between in-Region and out-of-Region status
- Modifications by jurisdictionally competent court; no Region may assert jurisdiction solely to modify or nullify status established elsewhere
- Retroactivity: status established before effective date receives same recognition
- Anti-nullification: no Region may retroactively nullify previously recognized family status

**Art I §9(y) — Exclusive Domain Limitation:**

- Regional Exclusive Domain over family law governs creation and modification for the Region's own domiciliaries
- Does NOT include authority to refuse recognition of family status validly established in other Regions
- Where recognition obligations and Exclusive Domain conflict, recognition prevails

**Art I §9(z) — Anti-Discrimination:**

- Recognition applies regardless of sex, gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, age, disability, or any other characteristic
- Public policy exception abolished: no Region may invoke "public policy," "public order," or equivalent doctrines except for status involving non-consenting parties or minors below federal age of consent
- Delegated bodies bound: all entities exercising delegated family law authority (public, private, religious) are subject to recognition and anti-discrimination obligations

**Art I §9(aa) — Enforcement and Emergency Relief:**

- Automatic provisional recognition upon presentation of valid vital record from any Region; provisional recognition conclusive in medical and custodial emergencies
- Private right of action in federal court with compensatory damages and attorney fees
- 14-day expedited review by Constitutional Court under §9(o) procedures
- 48-hour TRO from any federal court upon showing valid status and imminent harm
- DOJ authority: three or more denials within 24 months creates presumption of systematic violation
- Status follows the person: if a person has civil status valid in any Region, that status is recognized in every Region regardless of which Region the person is physically present in, traveling through, or relocating to

**Art I §10(a)(4) — Vital Statistics Expansion:**

- Expanded from "birth, death, marriage" to "birth, death, marriage, divorce, adoption, parentage"

## 2026-02-02: Gap 185 — Race to the Bottom (Deregulation Trap) Resolved (Article II §4)

Resolved Gap 185 (Race to the Bottom / Deregulation Trap) through Art II §4(h)-(k) (Constitutional Labor and Safety Minimums) in `02-design/constitution/02-powers-and-rights.md`. This was the fortieth "Requires Development" gap resolved through the multi-LLM review process.

### Problem

A Region abolishes labor protections and environmental controls, producing goods at dramatically lower cost. The Common Market prevents other Regions from imposing tariffs. High-standard Regions face de-industrialization. The proposal framed this as a consequence of "exclusive" Regional control over labor, but labor standards are actually a Structured Concurrent Domain (Art II §1(e)(3)(iii)) with federal floor authority under Art II §4. The real gap: no constitutional labor floor exists independent of congressional action, and the congressional mechanism requires 3/5 supermajority + ARB spillover certification + 10-year sunset.

### Resolution Approach

**Placement:** Art II §4(h)-(k) — extends the Concurrent Authority Framework with permanent constitutional minimums rather than creating a standalone Art XVI §13. Both reviewers converged on this placement and on the hybrid approach (constitutional minimums for egregious abuses + §4 mechanism for standards above the floor).

**Key design decisions:** constitutional minimums for forced labor (including prison labor for commercial advantage), child labor under 16, IFC-determined subsistence wage, and imminent hazard; functional worker definition via economic reality test (including algorithmic direction); universal territorial application (no SEZ exemptions); inalienable rights (no waiver); supply chain accountability; social dumping prohibition with rebuttable presumption; permanence (not subject to sunset or variance); combination enforcement.

### Constitutional Text Changes

- **Art II §4(h)** — Constitutional Labor Minimums: forced labor + prison labor prohibition, child labor under 16, IFC Regional Subsistence Floor, imminent hazard right to refuse, Art I §11 cross-reference
- **Art II §4(i)** — Anti-Circumvention: universal territorial application (no SEZ exemptions), functional worker definition (economic reality test including algorithmic direction), no waiver, supply chain accountability
- **Art II §4(j)** — Social Dumping Prohibition: rebuttable presumption of spillover, congressional commerce authority for goods produced in violation, Art I §11 cross-reference for environmental dimension
- **Art II §4(k)** — Enforcement and Permanence: permanence (exempt from sunset/variance), federal backstop inspections, private right of action for workers and competing businesses, IFC annual monitoring, relationship to congressional floors

### Gaming Vectors Addressed

- G1 "Special Economic Zone" → §4(i)(1) universal territorial application
- G2 "Independent Contractor Dodge" → §4(i)(2) economic reality test
- G3 "Environmental Exemption" → Art I §11 existing coverage + §4(j)(3) cross-reference
- G4 "Youth Apprenticeship Loophole" → §4(h)(2) prohibition regardless of designation
- G5 "Variance Exploit" → §4(k)(1) minimums not subject to variance
- G6 "Sunset Trap" → §4(k)(1) minimums not subject to sunset
- G7 "Spillover Stall" → §4(j)(1) rebuttable presumption eliminates certification delay
- G8 "Intra-Regional Defense" → §4(j)(1) presumption applies regardless of commerce flows
- G9 "Piece-Rate Evasion" → §4(h)(3) subsistence floor based on actual compensation
- G10 "Prison Labor Arbitrage" → §4(h)(1) prison labor for commercial advantage prohibited
- G11 "Gig Economy Shield" → §4(i)(2) economic reality test including algorithmic direction
- G12 "Cost-of-Living Justification" → §4(h)(3) IFC determines Regional floor indexed to cost of living
- G13 "Voluntary Waiver" → §4(i)(3) rights inalienable
- G14 "Student Classification" → §4(i)(2) "student" label irrelevant under economic reality test
