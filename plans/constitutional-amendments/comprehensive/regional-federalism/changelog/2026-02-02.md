## 2026-02-02: Gap 199 — Family Fracture (Status Portability) Resolved (Article I §9, §10)

Resolved Gap 199 (Family Fracture / Status Portability) through Art I §9(b) expanded enumeration, six new subsections Art I §9(v)-(aa), and Art I §10(a)(4) vital statistics expansion in `02-design/constitution/01-regional-structure.md`. This was the thirty-ninth "Requires Development" gap resolved through the multi-LLM review process on 2026-02-01/02-02.

### Problem

Regions control family law within their Exclusive Domains (Art II §1(e)(2)(iv)). A Region could refuse to recognize marriages, adoptions, or parentage established in other Regions, effectively dissolving families when they cross Regional borders. Pre-*Obergefell*, same-sex couples faced exactly this reality. The adoption variant is more severe: a parent legally adopts in Region A; Region B refuses recognition; the parent loses parental rights; the child becomes a legal orphan. Art I §9(b) mandated recognition of marriages, divorces, adoptions, and name changes, but did not define "recognition" as including all legal incidents, did not enumerate civil unions/domestic partnerships/parentage/surrogacy, and did not address the Exclusive Domain tension with Art II §1(e)(2)(iv).

### Resolution Approach

**Placement:** Art I §9 (Mutual Recognition) — consolidates all recognition provisions in existing framework rather than creating new Art III-RF §8. Six new subsections plus amendments to §9(b) and §10(a)(4).

**External review convergence:** Two independent reviewers converged on all 13 design questions plus 2 additional questions. Full agreement on: expanded enumeration with catch-all (D2-D), full incidents with equivalence principle (D3-C), explicit Exclusive Domain limitation (D4-A), enumerated anti-discrimination (D5-A), validity-from-establishing/incidents-from-residence conflict of laws (D6-A), strengthened children's protection with adoption finality (D7-B+D), automatic provisional recognition plus expedited judicial remedy (D8-D), explicit selective recognition prohibition with anti-circumvention (D9-D), vital records through existing §10 expansion (D10-B), explicit retroactivity plus anti-nullification (D11-C), combination enforcement (D12-D), multi-Regional family recognition (D13-A).
