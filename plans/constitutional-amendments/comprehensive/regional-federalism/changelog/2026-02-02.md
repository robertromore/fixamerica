## 2026-02-02: Gap 199 — Family Fracture (Status Portability) Resolved (Article I §9, §10)

Resolved Gap 199 (Family Fracture / Status Portability) through Art I §9(b) expanded enumeration, six new subsections Art I §9(v)-(aa), and Art I §10(a)(4) vital statistics expansion in `02-design/constitution/01-regional-structure.md`. This was the thirty-ninth "Requires Development" gap resolved through the multi-LLM review process on 2026-02-01/02-02.

### Problem

Regions control family law within their Exclusive Domains (Art II §1(e)(2)(iv)). A Region could refuse to recognize marriages, adoptions, or parentage established in other Regions, effectively dissolving families when they cross Regional borders. Pre-*Obergefell*, same-sex couples faced exactly this reality. The adoption variant is more severe: a parent legally adopts in Region A; Region B refuses recognition; the parent loses parental rights; the child becomes a legal orphan. Art I §9(b) mandated recognition of marriages, divorces, adoptions, and name changes, but did not define "recognition" as including all legal incidents, did not enumerate civil unions/domestic partnerships/parentage/surrogacy, and did not address the Exclusive Domain tension with Art II §1(e)(2)(iv).

### Resolution Approach

**Placement:** Art I §9 (Mutual Recognition) — consolidates all recognition provisions in existing framework rather than creating new Art III-RF §8. Six new subsections plus amendments to §9(b) and §10(a)(4).

**External review convergence:** Two independent reviewers converged on all 13 design questions plus 2 additional questions. Full agreement on: expanded enumeration with catch-all (D2-D), full incidents with equivalence principle (D3-C), explicit Exclusive Domain limitation (D4-A), enumerated anti-discrimination (D5-A), validity-from-establishing/incidents-from-residence conflict of laws (D6-A), strengthened children's protection with adoption finality (D7-B+D), automatic provisional recognition plus expedited judicial remedy (D8-D), explicit selective recognition prohibition with anti-circumvention (D9-D), vital records through existing §10 expansion (D10-B), explicit retroactivity plus anti-nullification (D11-C), combination enforcement (D12-D), multi-Regional family recognition (D13-A).

### Constitutional Text Changes

**Art I §9(b) — Expanded Enumeration:**

- Added: civil unions, domestic partnerships, parentage determinations, surrogacy agreements, custody orders, guardianship orders
- Added catch-all: "and all other legal determinations of family status or relationship"

**Art I §9(v) — Full Incidents of Recognition:**

- Recognition includes all legal incidents, rights, benefits, obligations, and privileges
- Enumerated minimum incidents: spousal benefits, inheritance, survivorship, hospital visitation, medical decision-making, emergency contact, parental rights, custody, child support, property rights, joint ownership, community property, testimonial privileges, confidential communications, immigration benefits, tax filing, insurance coverage, pension/retirement, next-of-kin
- Equivalence principle: recognized status receives same incidents as most comparable in-Region status
- Selective recognition prohibited
- Re-characterization to lesser legal category prohibited
- Functional non-recognition through procedural barriers prohibited

**Art I §9(w) — Continuity of Parentage:**

- Parent-child relationship inviolable once established by birth, adoption, parentage determination, surrogacy agreement, or court order
- Relationship travels with relocation
- Adoption finality: adoption decree valid in establishing Region may not be re-adjudicated; no re-adoption required
- No child may be rendered a legal orphan through interstate relocation
- Termination only through due process in court with jurisdiction
- Custody orders and child support orders enforceable across Regional borders

**Art I §9(x) — Conflict of Laws:**

- Validity governed by establishing Region
- Incidents governed by residence Region but may not extinguish the fundamental legal relationship or discriminate between in-Region and out-of-Region status
- Modifications by jurisdictionally competent court; no Region may assert jurisdiction solely to modify or nullify status established elsewhere
- Retroactivity: status established before effective date receives same recognition
- Anti-nullification: no Region may retroactively nullify previously recognized family status

**Art I §9(y) — Exclusive Domain Limitation:**

- Regional Exclusive Domain over family law governs creation and modification for the Region's own domiciliaries
- Does NOT include authority to refuse recognition of family status validly established in other Regions
- Where recognition obligations and Exclusive Domain conflict, recognition prevails

**Art I §9(z) — Anti-Discrimination:**

- Recognition applies regardless of sex, gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, age, disability, or any other characteristic
- Public policy exception abolished: no Region may invoke "public policy," "public order," or equivalent doctrines except for status involving non-consenting parties or minors below federal age of consent
- Delegated bodies bound: all entities exercising delegated family law authority (public, private, religious) are subject to recognition and anti-discrimination obligations

**Art I §9(aa) — Enforcement and Emergency Relief:**

- Automatic provisional recognition upon presentation of valid vital record from any Region; provisional recognition conclusive in medical and custodial emergencies
- Private right of action in federal court with compensatory damages and attorney fees
- 14-day expedited review by Constitutional Court under §9(o) procedures
- 48-hour TRO from any federal court upon showing valid status and imminent harm
- DOJ authority: three or more denials within 24 months creates presumption of systematic violation
- Status follows the person: if a person has civil status valid in any Region, that status is recognized in every Region regardless of which Region the person is physically present in, traveling through, or relocating to

**Art I §10(a)(4) — Vital Statistics Expansion:**

- Expanded from "birth, death, marriage" to "birth, death, marriage, divorce, adoption, parentage"
- Inter-Regional verification through existing §10(b)-(c) interoperability mandates

## 2026-02-02: Gap 185 — Race to the Bottom (Deregulation Trap) Resolved (Article II §4)

Resolved Gap 185 (Race to the Bottom / Deregulation Trap) through Art II §4(h)-(k) (Constitutional Labor and Safety Minimums) in `02-design/constitution/02-powers-and-rights.md`. This was the fortieth "Requires Development" gap resolved through the multi-LLM review process.

### Problem

A Region abolishes labor protections and environmental controls, producing goods at dramatically lower cost. The Common Market prevents other Regions from imposing tariffs. High-standard Regions face de-industrialization. The proposal framed this as a consequence of "exclusive" Regional control over labor, but labor standards are actually a Structured Concurrent Domain (Art II §1(e)(3)(iii)) with federal floor authority under Art II §4. The real gap: no constitutional labor floor exists independent of congressional action, and the congressional mechanism requires 3/5 supermajority + ARB spillover certification + 10-year sunset.

### Resolution Approach

**Placement:** Art II §4(h)-(k) — extends the Concurrent Authority Framework with permanent constitutional minimums rather than creating a standalone Art XVI §13. Both reviewers converged on this placement and on the hybrid approach (constitutional minimums for egregious abuses + §4 mechanism for standards above the floor).

**Key design decisions:** constitutional minimums for forced labor (including prison labor for commercial advantage), child labor under 16, IFC-determined subsistence wage, and imminent hazard; functional worker definition via economic reality test (including algorithmic direction); universal territorial application (no SEZ exemptions); inalienable rights (no waiver); supply chain accountability; social dumping prohibition with rebuttable presumption; permanence (not subject to sunset or variance); combination enforcement.

### Constitutional Text Changes

- **Art II §4(h)** — Constitutional Labor Minimums: forced labor + prison labor prohibition, child labor under 16, IFC Regional Subsistence Floor, imminent hazard right to refuse, Art I §11 cross-reference
- **Art II §4(i)** — Anti-Circumvention: universal territorial application (no SEZ exemptions), functional worker definition (economic reality test including algorithmic direction), no waiver, supply chain accountability
- **Art II §4(j)** — Social Dumping Prohibition: rebuttable presumption of spillover, congressional commerce authority for goods produced in violation, Art I §11 cross-reference for environmental dimension
- **Art II §4(k)** — Enforcement and Permanence: permanence (exempt from sunset/variance), federal backstop inspections, private right of action for workers and competing businesses, IFC annual monitoring, relationship to congressional floors

### Gaming Vectors Addressed

- G1 "Special Economic Zone" → §4(i)(1) universal territorial application
- G2 "Independent Contractor Dodge" → §4(i)(2) economic reality test
- G3 "Environmental Exemption" → Art I §11 existing coverage + §4(j)(3) cross-reference
- G4 "Youth Apprenticeship Loophole" → §4(h)(2) prohibition regardless of designation
- G5 "Variance Exploit" → §4(k)(1) minimums not subject to variance
- G6 "Sunset Trap" → §4(k)(1) minimums not subject to sunset
- G7 "Spillover Stall" → §4(j)(1) rebuttable presumption eliminates certification delay
- G8 "Intra-Regional Defense" → §4(j)(1) presumption applies regardless of commerce flows
- G9 "Piece-Rate Evasion" → §4(h)(3) subsistence floor based on actual compensation
- G10 "Prison Labor Arbitrage" → §4(h)(1) prison labor for commercial advantage prohibited
- G11 "Gig Economy Shield" → §4(i)(2) economic reality test including algorithmic direction
- G12 "Cost-of-Living Justification" → §4(h)(3) IFC determines Regional floor indexed to cost of living
- G13 "Voluntary Waiver" → §4(i)(3) rights inalienable
- G14 "Student Classification" → §4(i)(2) "student" label irrelevant under economic reality test

### Files Modified

- `02-design/constitution/02-powers-and-rights.md` — Art II §4(h)-(k) added (4 subsections)
- `04-meta/gaps/10-interstate-commerce.md` — Gap 185 status: PROPOSAL AVAILABLE → RESOLVED with coverage table

## 2026-02-02: Gap 167 — Lame Duck Sabotage (Transition Vulnerability) Resolved (Article V §4-A)

Resolved Gap 167 (Lame Duck Sabotage / Transition Vulnerability) through Art V §4-A (Regional Executive Transition Integrity) in `02-design/constitution/03-regional-governance.md`. This was the forty-first "Requires Development" gap resolved through the multi-LLM review process.

### Problem

Article XI-RF grants Regional Governors power to refuse Guard federalization and declare States of Emergency. No provisions addressed the transition period between election and inauguration. A defeated Governor retained full constitutional powers during the 60-90 day lame duck period with zero political accountability, enabling "scorched earth" strategies: refusing lawful Guard federalization, declaring emergencies, locking successors into unfavorable contracts, purging officials, and flooding clemency. Art II §12 comprehensively addresses this for the President (pardon limits, executive action restrictions, records preservation, cooperation duties, void-ab-initio enforcement) but no equivalent existed for Regional Governors.

### Resolution Approach

**Placement:** Art V §4-A (new section after Regional Executive definition) — rather than Art XI-RF as proposed, because the lame duck problem extends beyond Guard/emergency powers to contracts, appointments, clemency, records, and executive orders. Both reviewers converged on Art III §4-A placement (Art V in the file's article numbering) and on a full mirror of Art II §12 adapted for Regional context.

**Key design decisions:** Five transition triggers (including "statistical certainty" to prevent certification delay gaming); comprehensive restricted actions requiring Governor-Elect concurrence or 2/3 legislature (Guard refusal, emergency, compacts including non-renewal, officials, contracts with aggregation, clemency mirroring Art II §12(b), EOs/regulations); duty of continuity (inaction as violation); three-judge panel emergency exception with 72-hour expiration; 48-hour Governor-Elect response deadline with legislative fallback; records preservation with felony destruction; mandatory transition cooperation; anti-circumvention (delegation attribution, 60-day pre-transition retroactive review, contract aggregation); void-ab-initio enforcement with criminal penalties and permanent disqualification; successor ratification option.

### Constitutional Text Changes

- **Art V §4-A(a)** — Transition Period: five triggers (election certification, non-re-election announcement, final 90 days, recall/impeachment, statistical certainty >1%)
- **Art V §4-A(b)** — Restricted Authority: seven categories requiring concurrence or 2/3 legislature; applies to "any person exercising gubernatorial powers" (covers resignation handoff)
- **Art V §4-A(c)** — Duty of Continuity: status quo ante for routine operations; willful inaction as violation
- **Art V §4-A(d)** — Emergency Exception: three-judge panel, 72-hour expiration, anti-ratcheting cross-reference
- **Art V §4-A(e)** — Governor-Elect Response: 48-hour deadline, legislative fallback, court petition
- **Art V §4-A(f)** — Records Preservation: mandatory preservation, destruction is felony
- **Art V §4-A(g)** — Transition Cooperation: written summary, agency access, security transfer, personal meeting
- **Art V §4-A(h)** — Anti-Circumvention: delegation attribution, 60-day pre-transition retroactive review, contract aggregation
- **Art V §4-A(i)** — Enforcement: void ab initio, standing for Governor-Elect/legislature/AG, 50-500 FPU criminal penalties, permanent disqualification, successor ratification option

### Gaming Vectors Addressed

- G1 "Scorched Earth Emergency" → §4-A(b)(2) restricts new declarations
- G2 "Guard Refusal Crisis" → §4-A(b)(1) restricts refusal
- G3 "Contract Lock-In" → §4-A(b)(5) threshold + aggregation
- G4 "Personnel Purge" → §4-A(b)(4) restricts termination and appointment
- G5 "Policy Entrenchment" → §4-A(b)(7) restricts prospective EOs/regulations
- G6 "Pre-Certification Sprint" → §4-A(a)(3) final-90-days trigger + §4-A(h)(2) retroactive review
- G7 "Certification Delay" → §4-A(a)(5) statistical certainty trigger
- G8 "Governor-Elect Unavailability" → §4-A(e) response deadline + legislative path
- G9 "Allied Legislature" → two-thirds threshold
- G10 "Contract Split" → §4-A(b)(5) aggregation + §4-A(h)(3)
- G11 "Non-Renewal Sabotage" → §4-A(b)(3) non-renewal + §4-A(c) duty of continuity
- G12 "Resignation Handoff" → §4-A(b) "any person exercising gubernatorial powers"
- G13 "Clemency Flood" → §4-A(b)(6) clemency restrictions
- G14 "Delegated Action" → §4-A(h)(1) delegation attribution
- G15 "Emergency Grandfathering" → §4-A(b)(2) "materially expand"
- G16 "Rulemaking Rush" → §4-A(b)(7) regulation restriction
- G17 "Settlement Payout" → §4-A(b)(5) settlements covered

## 2026-02-02: Gap 168 — Acting Official Loophole (Bypassing Confirmation) Resolved (Article IV §4-C, Article X §5(f))

Resolved Gap 168 (Acting Official Loophole / Bypassing Confirmation) through Art IV §4-C (Acting Official Limitations, 11 subsections) in `02-design/constitution/03-regional-governance.md` and Art X §5(f) (IFC Vacancy Filling) in `02-design/constitution/04-fiscal-system.md`. This was the forty-second "Requires Development" gap resolved through the multi-LLM review process.

### Problem

The Constitution empowers specific offices to exercise critical constitutional powers: the Regional Governor commands Guard forces (Art XI-RF §2(d)) and declares emergencies (Art XVII-RF §1); the IFC certifies equalization formulas (Art X §5); the ARB resolves power-allocation disputes (Art II §7). No provisions addressed officials serving in "Acting," "Interim," or temporary capacity. An unconfirmed acting official could exercise full constitutional powers indefinitely, circumventing the entire checks-and-balances system. Article IV §4-B(i) explicitly cross-referenced "limitations on acting officials established elsewhere in this Constitution" — but those limitations were never written. The cross-reference pointed to an empty slot. Additionally, Art X §5 (IFC) had no vacancy-filling procedure at all, enabling quorum starvation.

### Resolution Approach

**Placement:** Art IV §4-C (after §4-B Confirmation Procedures) — fulfills the §4-B(i) cross-reference. IFC-specific vacancy-filling in Art X §5(f) — keeps body-specific procedure with the body's definition. Both reviewers converged on Art IV §4-C placement and on the combination approach (general principle in §4-C + IFC-specific in Art X §5).

**Key design decisions:** 120-day time limit from vacancy date (not appointment date); tolling during active confirmation proceedings (narrow, resumes upon withdrawal/rejection); mandatory 60-day nomination with automatic consequences; three-tier fallback (succession → panel → suspension); multi-member body quorum protection with emergency filling; anti-circumvention (revolving door prohibition, delegation prohibition, dual-hat prohibition, functional coverage regardless of title); federal constitutional floor for Regional acting officials exercising federal constitutional powers; 180-day limit for temporary judicial officers; auto-suspension enforcement (self-executing, void ab initio); bounded 30-day emergency exception for enumerated critical powers only requiring confirming body concurrence; §4-A/§4-B coordination with stricter-governs rule.

**External review convergence:** Two independent reviewers converged on 8 of 13 design questions. Resolved divergences: D1 — 120 days (R2) over 90 days (R1) for operational buffer with tolling; D5 — both §4-C general + Art X §5(f) specific (R1); D6 — hybrid vacancy-based clock (R2) + tolling during confirmation (R1); D7 — functional test (R2) with enumerated critical examples; D10 — full powers until limit (R2) with mandatory disclosure; D12 — 30-day extension (R2) limited to enumerated critical powers (R1) with confirming body concurrence. R2 contributed: revolving door finding (CRITICAL), IFC void finding (CRITICAL), receiver power concern, regional asymmetry finding, G15 "Recess Reset" vector, G16 "First Assistant Trick" vector, delegation prohibition, functional coverage clause.

### Constitutional Text Changes

## Gap 186 — Judicial Monoculture (Court Packing by Geography)

**Source:** `04-meta/gaps/08-electoral-judicial.md`, line 2586
**Severity:** High
**Overlap with existing provisions:** ~30-35% (LOW-MODERATE)
**Resolution:** Art III-RF §5-A (Supreme Court Regional Diversity) — 11 subsections

### Problem

A coalition of 4 aligned Regions controlling the Presidency and Senate could systematically fill every Supreme Court vacancy with Justices from their own Regions. Over 3-4 Presidential terms, the Court becomes geographically homogeneous. Excluded Regions view the Court as a partisan body and stop complying with adverse rulings — soft secession through judicial non-recognition.

The existing §5(g) explicitly cross-referenced a "Regional Diversity requirement (Article III-RF, Section 1)" that was never written — another constitutional TODO slot (same pattern as the §4-B(i)/§4-C phantom reference resolved in Gap 168).

### Convergence Decisions

| Question | R1 | R2 | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 Seat allocation | B (formula) | A (formula + safety) | Formula: one per Region + at-large within 9; ceiling of 11 if Regions exceed 9 |

| D3 Commission control | A (list controls) | A (list controls) | A: Commission submits 3-5 candidates; President selects from list |
| D4 At-large constraint | A (no two same Region) | A (no two same Region) | A: No two at-large Justices from same Region |
| D5 Regional court integration | B (cross-reference) | B (cross-reference) | B: §5-A(i) coordination clause with Art XIV-RF |
| D6 Chief Justice rotation | C (no consecutive same-Region) | C (no consecutive same-Region) | C: No successive Chief Justices from same Region |
| D7 Transition | D (hybrid) | B (assign + full future) | D adapted: Assign by domicile; most recent becomes at-large if overlap; full mandate for future |
| D8 Domicile verification | D (commission cert) | D (commission cert) | D: Commission certifies domicile standard compliance |
| D9 Qualification shortfall | C (temp at-large) | D (expand + fallback) | D+C hybrid: Expanded search (3yr) first; temp at-large for one term if still insufficient |
| D10 Early departure | B (same Region) | C (same Region + at-large rule) | B/C combined: Same Region for Regional seats; at-large diversity rule for at-large seats |
| D11 Court size | B (formula within 9) | B (formula + ceiling) | B with ceiling: Formula within 9; Congress may expand to 11 if Regions >9 |
| D12 Party balance | A (no) | A (no) | A: No party balance requirement |
| D13 Confirmation integration | C (commission cert prerequisite) | C (commission cert prerequisite) | C: Commission certification completes before §4-B confirmation clock begins |
