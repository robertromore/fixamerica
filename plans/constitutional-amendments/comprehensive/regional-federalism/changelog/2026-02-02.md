## 2026-02-02: Gap 199 — Family Fracture (Status Portability) Resolved (Article I §9, §10)

Resolved Gap 199 (Family Fracture / Status Portability) through Art I §9(b) expanded enumeration, six new subsections Art I §9(v)-(aa), and Art I §10(a)(4) vital statistics expansion in `02-design/constitution/01-regional-structure.md`. This was the thirty-ninth "Requires Development" gap resolved through the multi-LLM review process on 2026-02-01/02-02.

### Problem

Regions control family law within their Exclusive Domains (Art II §1(e)(2)(iv)). A Region could refuse to recognize marriages, adoptions, or parentage established in other Regions, effectively dissolving families when they cross Regional borders. Pre-*Obergefell*, same-sex couples faced exactly this reality. The adoption variant is more severe: a parent legally adopts in Region A; Region B refuses recognition; the parent loses parental rights; the child becomes a legal orphan. Art I §9(b) mandated recognition of marriages, divorces, adoptions, and name changes, but did not define "recognition" as including all legal incidents, did not enumerate civil unions/domestic partnerships/parentage/surrogacy, and did not address the Exclusive Domain tension with Art II §1(e)(2)(iv).

### Resolution Approach

**Placement:** Art I §9 (Mutual Recognition) — consolidates all recognition provisions in existing framework rather than creating new Art III-RF §8. Six new subsections plus amendments to §9(b) and §10(a)(4).

**External review convergence:** Two independent reviewers converged on all 13 design questions plus 2 additional questions. Full agreement on: expanded enumeration with catch-all (D2-D), full incidents with equivalence principle (D3-C), explicit Exclusive Domain limitation (D4-A), enumerated anti-discrimination (D5-A), validity-from-establishing/incidents-from-residence conflict of laws (D6-A), strengthened children's protection with adoption finality (D7-B+D), automatic provisional recognition plus expedited judicial remedy (D8-D), explicit selective recognition prohibition with anti-circumvention (D9-D), vital records through existing §10 expansion (D10-B), explicit retroactivity plus anti-nullification (D11-C), combination enforcement (D12-D), multi-Regional family recognition (D13-A).

### Constitutional Text Changes

**Art I §9(b) — Expanded Enumeration:**

- Added: civil unions, domestic partnerships, parentage determinations, surrogacy agreements, custody orders, guardianship orders
- Added catch-all: "and all other legal determinations of family status or relationship"

**Art I §9(v) — Full Incidents of Recognition:**

- Recognition includes all legal incidents, rights, benefits, obligations, and privileges
- Enumerated minimum incidents: spousal benefits, inheritance, survivorship, hospital visitation, medical decision-making, emergency contact, parental rights, custody, child support, property rights, joint ownership, community property, testimonial privileges, confidential communications, immigration benefits, tax filing, insurance coverage, pension/retirement, next-of-kin
- Equivalence principle: recognized status receives same incidents as most comparable in-Region status
- Selective recognition prohibited
- Re-characterization to lesser legal category prohibited
- Functional non-recognition through procedural barriers prohibited

**Art I §9(w) — Continuity of Parentage:**

- Parent-child relationship inviolable once established by birth, adoption, parentage determination, surrogacy agreement, or court order
- Relationship travels with relocation
- Adoption finality: adoption decree valid in establishing Region may not be re-adjudicated; no re-adoption required
- No child may be rendered a legal orphan through interstate relocation
- Termination only through due process in court with jurisdiction
- Custody orders and child support orders enforceable across Regional borders

**Art I §9(x) — Conflict of Laws:**

- Validity governed by establishing Region
- Incidents governed by residence Region but may not extinguish the fundamental legal relationship or discriminate between in-Region and out-of-Region status
- Modifications by jurisdictionally competent court; no Region may assert jurisdiction solely to modify or nullify status established elsewhere
- Retroactivity: status established before effective date receives same recognition
- Anti-nullification: no Region may retroactively nullify previously recognized family status

**Art I §9(y) — Exclusive Domain Limitation:**

- Regional Exclusive Domain over family law governs creation and modification for the Region's own domiciliaries
- Does NOT include authority to refuse recognition of family status validly established in other Regions
- Where recognition obligations and Exclusive Domain conflict, recognition prevails

**Art I §9(z) — Anti-Discrimination:**

- Recognition applies regardless of sex, gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, age, disability, or any other characteristic
- Public policy exception abolished: no Region may invoke "public policy," "public order," or equivalent doctrines except for status involving non-consenting parties or minors below federal age of consent
- Delegated bodies bound: all entities exercising delegated family law authority (public, private, religious) are subject to recognition and anti-discrimination obligations

**Art I §9(aa) — Enforcement and Emergency Relief:**

- Automatic provisional recognition upon presentation of valid vital record from any Region; provisional recognition conclusive in medical and custodial emergencies
- Private right of action in federal court with compensatory damages and attorney fees
- 14-day expedited review by Constitutional Court under §9(o) procedures
- 48-hour TRO from any federal court upon showing valid status and imminent harm
- DOJ authority: three or more denials within 24 months creates presumption of systematic violation
- Status follows the person: if a person has civil status valid in any Region, that status is recognized in every Region regardless of which Region the person is physically present in, traveling through, or relocating to

**Art I §10(a)(4) — Vital Statistics Expansion:**

- Expanded from "birth, death, marriage" to "birth, death, marriage, divorce, adoption, parentage"
- Inter-Regional verification through existing §10(b)-(c) interoperability mandates

## 2026-02-02: Gap 185 — Race to the Bottom (Deregulation Trap) Resolved (Article II §4)

Resolved Gap 185 (Race to the Bottom / Deregulation Trap) through Art II §4(h)-(k) (Constitutional Labor and Safety Minimums) in `02-design/constitution/02-powers-and-rights.md`. This was the fortieth "Requires Development" gap resolved through the multi-LLM review process.

### Problem

A Region abolishes labor protections and environmental controls, producing goods at dramatically lower cost. The Common Market prevents other Regions from imposing tariffs. High-standard Regions face de-industrialization. The proposal framed this as a consequence of "exclusive" Regional control over labor, but labor standards are actually a Structured Concurrent Domain (Art II §1(e)(3)(iii)) with federal floor authority under Art II §4. The real gap: no constitutional labor floor exists independent of congressional action, and the congressional mechanism requires 3/5 supermajority + ARB spillover certification + 10-year sunset.

### Resolution Approach

**Placement:** Art II §4(h)-(k) — extends the Concurrent Authority Framework with permanent constitutional minimums rather than creating a standalone Art XVI §13. Both reviewers converged on this placement and on the hybrid approach (constitutional minimums for egregious abuses + §4 mechanism for standards above the floor).

**Key design decisions:** constitutional minimums for forced labor (including prison labor for commercial advantage), child labor under 16, IFC-determined subsistence wage, and imminent hazard; functional worker definition via economic reality test (including algorithmic direction); universal territorial application (no SEZ exemptions); inalienable rights (no waiver); supply chain accountability; social dumping prohibition with rebuttable presumption; permanence (not subject to sunset or variance); combination enforcement.

### Constitutional Text Changes

- **Art II §4(h)** — Constitutional Labor Minimums: forced labor + prison labor prohibition, child labor under 16, IFC Regional Subsistence Floor, imminent hazard right to refuse, Art I §11 cross-reference
- **Art II §4(i)** — Anti-Circumvention: universal territorial application (no SEZ exemptions), functional worker definition (economic reality test including algorithmic direction), no waiver, supply chain accountability
- **Art II §4(j)** — Social Dumping Prohibition: rebuttable presumption of spillover, congressional commerce authority for goods produced in violation, Art I §11 cross-reference for environmental dimension
- **Art II §4(k)** — Enforcement and Permanence: permanence (exempt from sunset/variance), federal backstop inspections, private right of action for workers and competing businesses, IFC annual monitoring, relationship to congressional floors

### Gaming Vectors Addressed

- G1 "Special Economic Zone" → §4(i)(1) universal territorial application
- G2 "Independent Contractor Dodge" → §4(i)(2) economic reality test
- G3 "Environmental Exemption" → Art I §11 existing coverage + §4(j)(3) cross-reference
- G4 "Youth Apprenticeship Loophole" → §4(h)(2) prohibition regardless of designation
- G5 "Variance Exploit" → §4(k)(1) minimums not subject to variance
- G6 "Sunset Trap" → §4(k)(1) minimums not subject to sunset
- G7 "Spillover Stall" → §4(j)(1) rebuttable presumption eliminates certification delay
- G8 "Intra-Regional Defense" → §4(j)(1) presumption applies regardless of commerce flows
- G9 "Piece-Rate Evasion" → §4(h)(3) subsistence floor based on actual compensation
- G10 "Prison Labor Arbitrage" → §4(h)(1) prison labor for commercial advantage prohibited
- G11 "Gig Economy Shield" → §4(i)(2) economic reality test including algorithmic direction
- G12 "Cost-of-Living Justification" → §4(h)(3) IFC determines Regional floor indexed to cost of living
- G13 "Voluntary Waiver" → §4(i)(3) rights inalienable
- G14 "Student Classification" → §4(i)(2) "student" label irrelevant under economic reality test

### Files Modified

- `02-design/constitution/02-powers-and-rights.md` — Art II §4(h)-(k) added (4 subsections)
- `04-meta/gaps/10-interstate-commerce.md` — Gap 185 status: PROPOSAL AVAILABLE → RESOLVED with coverage table

## 2026-02-02: Gap 167 — Lame Duck Sabotage (Transition Vulnerability) Resolved (Article V §4-A)

Resolved Gap 167 (Lame Duck Sabotage / Transition Vulnerability) through Art V §4-A (Regional Executive Transition Integrity) in `02-design/constitution/03-regional-governance.md`. This was the forty-first "Requires Development" gap resolved through the multi-LLM review process.

### Problem

Article XI-RF grants Regional Governors power to refuse Guard federalization and declare States of Emergency. No provisions addressed the transition period between election and inauguration. A defeated Governor retained full constitutional powers during the 60-90 day lame duck period with zero political accountability, enabling "scorched earth" strategies: refusing lawful Guard federalization, declaring emergencies, locking successors into unfavorable contracts, purging officials, and flooding clemency. Art II §12 comprehensively addresses this for the President (pardon limits, executive action restrictions, records preservation, cooperation duties, void-ab-initio enforcement) but no equivalent existed for Regional Governors.

### Resolution Approach

**Placement:** Art V §4-A (new section after Regional Executive definition) — rather than Art XI-RF as proposed, because the lame duck problem extends beyond Guard/emergency powers to contracts, appointments, clemency, records, and executive orders. Both reviewers converged on Art III §4-A placement (Art V in the file's article numbering) and on a full mirror of Art II §12 adapted for Regional context.

**Key design decisions:** Five transition triggers (including "statistical certainty" to prevent certification delay gaming); comprehensive restricted actions requiring Governor-Elect concurrence or 2/3 legislature (Guard refusal, emergency, compacts including non-renewal, officials, contracts with aggregation, clemency mirroring Art II §12(b), EOs/regulations); duty of continuity (inaction as violation); three-judge panel emergency exception with 72-hour expiration; 48-hour Governor-Elect response deadline with legislative fallback; records preservation with felony destruction; mandatory transition cooperation; anti-circumvention (delegation attribution, 60-day pre-transition retroactive review, contract aggregation); void-ab-initio enforcement with criminal penalties and permanent disqualification; successor ratification option.

### Constitutional Text Changes

- **Art V §4-A(a)** — Transition Period: five triggers (election certification, non-re-election announcement, final 90 days, recall/impeachment, statistical certainty >1%)
- **Art V §4-A(b)** — Restricted Authority: seven categories requiring concurrence or 2/3 legislature; applies to "any person exercising gubernatorial powers" (covers resignation handoff)
- **Art V §4-A(c)** — Duty of Continuity: status quo ante for routine operations; willful inaction as violation
- **Art V §4-A(d)** — Emergency Exception: three-judge panel, 72-hour expiration, anti-ratcheting cross-reference
- **Art V §4-A(e)** — Governor-Elect Response: 48-hour deadline, legislative fallback, court petition
- **Art V §4-A(f)** — Records Preservation: mandatory preservation, destruction is felony
- **Art V §4-A(g)** — Transition Cooperation: written summary, agency access, security transfer, personal meeting
- **Art V §4-A(h)** — Anti-Circumvention: delegation attribution, 60-day pre-transition retroactive review, contract aggregation
- **Art V §4-A(i)** — Enforcement: void ab initio, standing for Governor-Elect/legislature/AG, 50-500 FPU criminal penalties, permanent disqualification, successor ratification option

### Gaming Vectors Addressed

- G1 "Scorched Earth Emergency" → §4-A(b)(2) restricts new declarations
- G2 "Guard Refusal Crisis" → §4-A(b)(1) restricts refusal
- G3 "Contract Lock-In" → §4-A(b)(5) threshold + aggregation
- G4 "Personnel Purge" → §4-A(b)(4) restricts termination and appointment
- G5 "Policy Entrenchment" → §4-A(b)(7) restricts prospective EOs/regulations
- G6 "Pre-Certification Sprint" → §4-A(a)(3) final-90-days trigger + §4-A(h)(2) retroactive review
- G7 "Certification Delay" → §4-A(a)(5) statistical certainty trigger
- G8 "Governor-Elect Unavailability" → §4-A(e) response deadline + legislative path
- G9 "Allied Legislature" → two-thirds threshold
- G10 "Contract Split" → §4-A(b)(5) aggregation + §4-A(h)(3)
- G11 "Non-Renewal Sabotage" → §4-A(b)(3) non-renewal + §4-A(c) duty of continuity
- G12 "Resignation Handoff" → §4-A(b) "any person exercising gubernatorial powers"
- G13 "Clemency Flood" → §4-A(b)(6) clemency restrictions
- G14 "Delegated Action" → §4-A(h)(1) delegation attribution
- G15 "Emergency Grandfathering" → §4-A(b)(2) "materially expand"
- G16 "Rulemaking Rush" → §4-A(b)(7) regulation restriction
- G17 "Settlement Payout" → §4-A(b)(5) settlements covered

## 2026-02-02: Gap 168 — Acting Official Loophole (Bypassing Confirmation) Resolved (Article IV §4-C, Article X §5(f))

Resolved Gap 168 (Acting Official Loophole / Bypassing Confirmation) through Art IV §4-C (Acting Official Limitations, 11 subsections) in `02-design/constitution/03-regional-governance.md` and Art X §5(f) (IFC Vacancy Filling) in `02-design/constitution/04-fiscal-system.md`. This was the forty-second "Requires Development" gap resolved through the multi-LLM review process.

### Problem

The Constitution empowers specific offices to exercise critical constitutional powers: the Regional Governor commands Guard forces (Art XI-RF §2(d)) and declares emergencies (Art XVII-RF §1); the IFC certifies equalization formulas (Art X §5); the ARB resolves power-allocation disputes (Art II §7). No provisions addressed officials serving in "Acting," "Interim," or temporary capacity. An unconfirmed acting official could exercise full constitutional powers indefinitely, circumventing the entire checks-and-balances system. Article IV §4-B(i) explicitly cross-referenced "limitations on acting officials established elsewhere in this Constitution" — but those limitations were never written. The cross-reference pointed to an empty slot. Additionally, Art X §5 (IFC) had no vacancy-filling procedure at all, enabling quorum starvation.

### Resolution Approach

**Placement:** Art IV §4-C (after §4-B Confirmation Procedures) — fulfills the §4-B(i) cross-reference. IFC-specific vacancy-filling in Art X §5(f) — keeps body-specific procedure with the body's definition. Both reviewers converged on Art IV §4-C placement and on the combination approach (general principle in §4-C + IFC-specific in Art X §5).

**Key design decisions:** 120-day time limit from vacancy date (not appointment date); tolling during active confirmation proceedings (narrow, resumes upon withdrawal/rejection); mandatory 60-day nomination with automatic consequences; three-tier fallback (succession → panel → suspension); multi-member body quorum protection with emergency filling; anti-circumvention (revolving door prohibition, delegation prohibition, dual-hat prohibition, functional coverage regardless of title); federal constitutional floor for Regional acting officials exercising federal constitutional powers; 180-day limit for temporary judicial officers; auto-suspension enforcement (self-executing, void ab initio); bounded 30-day emergency exception for enumerated critical powers only requiring confirming body concurrence; §4-A/§4-B coordination with stricter-governs rule.

**External review convergence:** Two independent reviewers converged on 8 of 13 design questions. Resolved divergences: D1 — 120 days (R2) over 90 days (R1) for operational buffer with tolling; D5 — both §4-C general + Art X §5(f) specific (R1); D6 — hybrid vacancy-based clock (R2) + tolling during confirmation (R1); D7 — functional test (R2) with enumerated critical examples; D10 — full powers until limit (R2) with mandatory disclosure; D12 — 30-day extension (R2) limited to enumerated critical powers (R1) with confirming body concurrence. R2 contributed: revolving door finding (CRITICAL), IFC void finding (CRITICAL), receiver power concern, regional asymmetry finding, G15 "Recess Reset" vector, G16 "First Assistant Trick" vector, delegation prohibition, functional coverage clause.

### Constitutional Text Changes

## Gap 186 — Judicial Monoculture (Court Packing by Geography)

**Source:** `04-meta/gaps/08-electoral-judicial.md`, line 2586
**Severity:** High
**Overlap with existing provisions:** ~30-35% (LOW-MODERATE)
**Resolution:** Art III-RF §5-A (Supreme Court Regional Diversity) — 11 subsections

### Problem

A coalition of 4 aligned Regions controlling the Presidency and Senate could systematically fill every Supreme Court vacancy with Justices from their own Regions. Over 3-4 Presidential terms, the Court becomes geographically homogeneous. Excluded Regions view the Court as a partisan body and stop complying with adverse rulings — soft secession through judicial non-recognition.

The existing §5(g) explicitly cross-referenced a "Regional Diversity requirement (Article III-RF, Section 1)" that was never written — another constitutional TODO slot (same pattern as the §4-B(i)/§4-C phantom reference resolved in Gap 168).

### Convergence Decisions

| Question | R1 | R2 | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 Seat allocation | B (formula) | A (formula + safety) | Formula: one per Region + at-large within 9; ceiling of 11 if Regions exceed 9 |

| D3 Commission control | A (list controls) | A (list controls) | A: Commission submits 3-5 candidates; President selects from list |
| D4 At-large constraint | A (no two same Region) | A (no two same Region) | A: No two at-large Justices from same Region |
| D5 Regional court integration | B (cross-reference) | B (cross-reference) | B: §5-A(i) coordination clause with Art XIV-RF |
| D6 Chief Justice rotation | C (no consecutive same-Region) | C (no consecutive same-Region) | C: No successive Chief Justices from same Region |
| D7 Transition | D (hybrid) | B (assign + full future) | D adapted: Assign by domicile; most recent becomes at-large if overlap; full mandate for future |
| D8 Domicile verification | D (commission cert) | D (commission cert) | D: Commission certifies domicile standard compliance |
| D9 Qualification shortfall | C (temp at-large) | D (expand + fallback) | D+C hybrid: Expanded search (3yr) first; temp at-large for one term if still insufficient |
| D10 Early departure | B (same Region) | C (same Region + at-large rule) | B/C combined: Same Region for Regional seats; at-large diversity rule for at-large seats |
| D11 Court size | B (formula within 9) | B (formula + ceiling) | B with ceiling: Formula within 9; Congress may expand to 11 if Regions >9 |
| D12 Party balance | A (no) | A (no) | A: No party balance requirement |
| D13 Confirmation integration | C (commission cert prerequisite) | C (commission cert prerequisite) | C: Commission certification completes before §4-B confirmation clock begins |

## Gap 205 — Regulatory Sediment (Legislative Entropy)

**Source:** `04-meta/gaps/11-institutional-governance.md`, line 2645
**Severity:** High
**Overlap with existing provisions:** ~35-40% (MODERATE)
**Resolution:** Art II §24 (Regulatory Sunset and Review) — 11 subsections

### Problem

Federal regulations accumulate without systematic review. The CFR has grown from 10,000 pages (1950) to 180,000+ pages today (~2.5% annual growth). Each regulation has a constituency defending it; sunset provisions are routinely extended; courts interpret expansively over time; new regulations pile on old without consolidation. The system seizes up through sclerosis, not tyranny.

The constitution already demonstrates extensive use of sunset mechanisms for specific domains (Art II §4 concurrent authority 10yr, Art II §18(i) secret law 5yr, Art IV §6(b) IFC/ARB 12yr, Art XI-RF §6(k) security compacts 2yr, Art XVII-RF emergency powers) but never applies the concept universally to the general regulatory stock.

### Convergence Decisions

| Question | R1 | R2 | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 Duration | D (tiered 10/20yr) | E (10yr uniform) | 10 years uniform — aligns with Art II §4; simplicity over tiered complexity |
| D2 Scope | A (regs + guidance) | D (regs + delegated authority) | D adapted: regs, guidance, binding agency actions + statutory delegations; statutes themselves exempt |
| D3 Reg budget | E (tracking + cap) | E (Pay-Go) | R2 Pay-Go: one-in-one-out by cost; self-enforcing; IFC certification |
| D4 Cost calc | D (CBO pre + IFC post) | B (IFC only) | R1: CBO pre-enactment per Art IV §3; IFC post-enactment monitoring |
| D5 Staggered | E (risk-based) | A (subject cohorts) | R2 subject-matter cohorts; IFC/CBO sequence highest-burden first |
| D6 Failure | E (graduated) | A (hard cliff) | R1 graduated: 1yr extension + mandatory review; second failure = expiration |
| D7 Judicial interp | D (survive unless repudiated) | B (clean slate) | Modified B: clean slate default; Congress may incorporate prior interpretations |
| D8 Regional | B (constitutional floor) | B (constitutional floor) | B: Regions must adopt periodic review; design is Regional |
| D9 Exemptions | D (constitutional minimums) | B (constitutional/rights) | Combined: exempt constitutional provisions; presumptive retention for rights-implementing regs |
| D10 §4 interaction | B (shorter governs) | A (shorter governs) | Shorter period governs; moot at 10yr but coordination clause included |
| D11 Process | C (tiered) | A (full legislative) | R2: full legislative; single-subject cohorts make this workable |
| D12 Anti-gaming | D (IFC/CBO certification) | A (single-subject rule) | Both: single-subject/agency/Title + IFC certification prerequisite |
| D13 Conversion | B (anti-conversion) | C (not a problem) | R2: statutory conversion IS democratic review; Pay-Go constrains total burden |
| D14 Constitutional floor | C (presumptive retention) | C (presumptive retention) | C: rights-implementing regulations get presumptive retention |

### Constitutional Text Added

**Art II §24 (Regulatory Sunset and Review)** — 11 subsections:

**§24(a) — Principle of Impermanence:**

- All federal regulations, rules, guidance, and binding agency actions expire 10 years after effective date

**§24(e) — Staggered Implementation:**

- 10 subject-matter cohorts assigned within 2 years
- One cohort reviewed per year beginning year 3; highest-burden first
- All existing regulations through one complete cycle by year 12

**§24(f) — Graduated Expiration:**

- First failure: 1-year mandatory review extension (regulation enforceable)
- Second failure: void and unenforceable; no funds for enforcement
- Expiration does not preclude future regulation of same subject

**§24(g) — Compliance Cost Monitoring:**

- CBO pre-enactment estimates (per Art IV §3)
- IFC post-enactment monitoring; annual Regulatory Burden Report
- No agency self-certification of compliance costs

**§24(h) — Anti-Circumvention:**

- Covers all binding agency actions regardless of label (guidance, FAQ, enforcement manual)
- Enforcement discretion shadow prohibited (cannot enforce expired regulation substance)
- Incorporated-by-reference private standards expire with incorporating regulation
- Vague statutory delegation renewal does not restart clock for existing regulations

- IFC includes Regional data in annual Regulatory Burden Report

**§24(j) — Coordination:**

- §4 and §24: shorter period governs
- §18(i) secret law sunset operates independently
- Sector-specific sunsets continue independently; §24 is a floor

**§24(k) — Enforcement and Emergency Suspension:**

- Standing for any person subject to expired regulation
- Presidential 180-day emergency suspension; renewal requires Congress
- Self-executing; Congress may supplement

### Gaming Vectors Addressed

- G1 "Safety Defense" → §24(c)(3) IFC cost-benefit certification; §24(d) Pay-Go forces tradeoffs
- G2 "Extension Habit" → §24(c)(1) full legislative process, not voice vote
- G3 "Regulatory Ratchet" → §24(d) Pay-Go one-in-one-out

- G9 "Regulatory Conversion" → Accepted: statutory conversion IS democratic review; Pay-Go constrains
- G10 "Complexity Shield" → §24(c)(3) IFC certification of individual review
- G11 "GDP Manipulation" → Eliminated: Pay-Go uses actual compliance costs, not GDP ratio
- G12 "Cost Undercount" → §24(g)(3) no agency self-certification; IFC independent

## Gap 166 — Stuffed Pool Attack (Panel Selection Manipulation)

**Source:** `04-meta/gaps/08-electoral-judicial.md`, line 2336
**Severity:** Medium
**Overlap with existing provisions:** ~10-15% (LOW)
**Resolution:** Art IV §3(g-1)(6)-(7), §3(g-3)(2)(b)-(c), §3(i)(2), §3(i-1)(2)(a) — 11 provisions

### Problem

The Special Senate Panel (§3(g-1)) and Circuit Resolution Panel (§3(g-3)) rely on former officials selected by lot. No minimum service requirement existed, allowing pool manipulation: a faction instructs loyalists to win Senate seats or accept judgeships, serve minimally (one session or less), then resign. The "retired" pool is flooded with partisans. Even the cryptographically fair randomization protocol (§3(i-1)) then favors the faction that stuffed the pool. The Independent Adjudication Panel (§3(i)(2)) faced the same vulnerability through its use of "retired federal appellate judges selected by lot."

### Convergence Decisions

| Question | R1 | R2 | Resolution |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 Elected service | A/D (6yr or 4yr appointed) | A (6yr) | A: 6 years for elected Senators |
| D2 Appointed service | C (4yr) | C (4yr) | C: 4 cumulative years for appointed |
| D3 Extend to §3(i)(2) | A (yes) | A (yes) | A: extend to all random-selection panels |
| D4 Investigation def | A+C (formal + lift) | B (formal charges) | R2: formal charges/indictment + restoration clause |
| D5 Age cap | A (no caps) | B (min 50) | A: no age cap; 6yr service already filters |
| D6 Participation | A+D (tenure + standing) | A (tenure only) | A: tenure only; D4/D12 handle fitness |
| D7 Small pool | A/D (strict + transition) | A (accept fallback) | A: strict; existing §3(g-1)(5) fallback |
| D8 Transition | B (12yr sunset) | A (U.S. Senators) | B: former U.S. Senators 12yr post-ratification |
| D9 Weaponized investigation | A+B (opened-before + lift) | A (resolution) | Mooted by D4 formal charges + restoration |
| D10 Judicial minimum | B (uniform all) | B (10yr all) | B: 10 years Article III for all panel judges |
| D11 Protocol update | B+C (post-filter + census) | B (update protocol) | B: update §3(i-1) for post-filter pool |
| D12 Censure | D (integrity only) | D (conduct only) | D: integrity/fitness censure disqualifies |
| D13 Pool diversity | D (panel 3-Region) | A (no, existing sufficient) | A: existing party-Region filter sufficient |

### Constitutional Text Changes

- **§3(g-1)(6)(a)** — Minimum service: 6yr elected or 4yr appointed
- **§3(g-1)(6)(b)** — Clean departure: not removed by expulsion, impeachment, or recall
- **§3(g-1)(6)(c)** — Not resigned under formal charges (Ethics Committee) or criminal indictment
- **§3(g-1)(6)(d)** — Integrity-based censure disqualification (policy censure excluded)
- **§3(g-1)(6)(e)** — Restoration clause: cleared charges/indictment lift disqualification
- **§3(g-1)(6)(f)** — Resign-for-office carve-out: resignation to take another government office is not a dirty departure
- **§3(g-1)(7)** — Transition: former U.S. Senators eligible 12yr post-ratification
- **§3(g-3)(2)(a)** — Existing composition text preserved (restructured from single paragraph)
- **§3(g-3)(2)(b)** — Judicial eligibility: 10yr Article III service, not resigned under misconduct charges, restoration clause
- **§3(g-3)(2)(c)** — Transition: former U.S. chief judges eligible 12yr post-ratification
- **§3(i)(2)** — Cross-reference: retired appellate judges must meet (g-3)(2)(b) criteria
- **§3(i-1)(2)(a)** — Pool announcement clarified: post-filter eligible pool

### Gaming Vectors Addressed

- G1 "Minimal Service Stuffing" → §3(g-1)(6)(a) 6yr/4yr minimum
- G2 "Resignation Flood" → §3(g-1)(6)(a) minimum service blocks mass short-service resign
- G3 "Pool Dilution" → §3(g-1)(6)(a) raises stuffing cost from 1 session to 4-6 years
- G4 "Long-Game Capture" → §3(g-1)(6)(a)+(b)+(c)+(d) multi-factor eligibility
- G5 "Investigation Weaponization" → §3(g-1)(6)(c) formal charges only (not investigation) + (e) restoration
- G6 "Vacancy Appointment Pipeline" → §3(g-1)(6)(a) 4yr minimum for appointed
- G7 "Age Arbitrage" → 6yr minimum ensures oldest-possible youngest pool member is ~36; 12yr lookback limits to 48
- G8 "Attendance Shell" → Accepted risk; tenure-only standard avoids subjective participation metrics
- G9 "Cascading Capture" → §3(g-3)(2)(b) + §3(i)(2) extend protections to all three panels
- G10 "Pool Exhaustion via Recusal" → Existing §3(g-1)(4)-(5) fallback mechanism handles
- G11 "Transition Window" → §3(g-1)(7) + §3(g-3)(2)(c) former U.S. officials bridge
- G12 "Chief Judge Rotation Exploit" → §3(g-3)(2)(b)(i) 10yr minimum blocks short-rotation gaming
- G13 "Shadow Candidate" → §3(g-1)(6)(a) 4yr appointed minimum blocks
- G14 "Ethics Pardon" → §3(g-1)(6)(e) restoration requires actual dismissal/no adverse finding

### Files Modified

## 2026-02-02: Index Triage and Data Integrity Correction

Performed comprehensive triage of 42 remaining "Requires Development" gaps. Discovered that index descriptions for all RD gaps were stale — generic policy categories from an older version rather than the specific constitutional attack vectors described in the thematic gap files.

### Key Findings

1. **Index descriptions stale**: All 42 RD entries in 00-index.md had outdated generic descriptions (e.g., "Aviation authority and regional airports") that didn't match actual file content (e.g., "Interregional transit fee-gouging loophole"). Updated all descriptions to match authoritative file titles.

2. **Category III gaps 17-22 already resolved**: Six gaps in the index were marked "Requires Development" but had been resolved by constitutional provisions (Art I §§6-11) documented in 03-under-specified.md. Updated to ✅ Resolved.

3. **Category III gaps 5-7, 16 reclassified**: Four gaps had status "Requires Development" but file content shows they are partially mitigated or accepted by design:
    - Gap 5 (Media/information power) → Partially Mitigated
    - Gap 6 (Political party evolution) → Accepted by Design
    - Gap 7 (Implementation act dependency) → Partially Mitigated
    - Gap 16 (Inter-regional cooperation) → Partially Mitigated

4. **Gaps 26-28, 31 have proposals**: Four intergovernmental gaps had implementing proposals developed but were still marked RD. Updated to "Proposal Available."

5. **Gap 88 = Gap 122 (duplicate)**: Both titled "Two-Key Bypass via Military Officer Corps Purge" in 09-emergency-military.md.

### Triage Categories (28 remaining RD gaps)

**Constitutional (22):** Need new constitutional text to close structural vulnerabilities.

- High priority (7): 88/122, 49, 61, 106, 117, 125, 126
- Medium priority (15): 56, 59, 67, 75, 79, 90, 92, 93, 99, 100, 102, 118, 121, 124, 128, 132

**Statutory (11):** Can be closed through implementing legislation under existing framework.

- Gaps: 60, 70, 104, 107, 109, 111, 112, 116, 130, 142

**Deferred (5):** Intentionally under-specified or accepted.

- Gaps: 5, 6, 7, 13, 16 (already reclassified from RD)

### Count Changes

| Status | Before | After | Delta |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| Requires Development | 42 | 28 | -14 |
| Partially Mitigated | 36 | 39 | +3 |
| Accepted by Design | 12 | 13 | +1 |
| Proposal Available | 0 | 4 | +4 |
| Resolved | 138 | 144 | +6 |

### Files Modified

- `04-meta/gaps/00-index.md` — 49 description updates, 14 status changes, added Proposal Available status category, version 1.4→1.5
- `04-meta/02-identified-gaps.md` — Statistics updated

## Gap 88/122 — Two-Key Bypass via Military Officer Corps Purge (Counter-Deployment Protocol)

**Source:** `04-meta/gaps/09-emergency-military.md`, Gap 88 (line ~1304), Gap 122 (line ~1845)
**Severity:** Critical (88), High (122 — duplicate)
**Overlap with existing provisions:** ~60% (MODERATE-HIGH — Section 15 covers officer independence but lacks operational detail)
**Resolution:** Art XI §15(i)-(k) additions + new Art XI §16 (Counter-Deployment Operations Protocol) — 14 subsections total

### Problem

Article XI, Section 15 establishes officer corps independence: loyalty oath prohibition (§15(a)), protected refusal of unlawful orders (§15(b)), mass removal trigger (§15(c)), purge consequences (§15(d)), counter-deployment authority (§15(e)), commander accountability (§15(f)), pardon limitation (§15(g)), and Joint Chiefs independence (§15(h)). However, §15(e) grants counter-deployment authority without operationalizing it. Eight residual gaps remained: no activation determination procedure, no authorized actions enumeration, no rules of engagement, no federal personnel status provisions, no expedited judicial review pathway, no post-crisis adjudication mechanism, no chain of command integrity provisions, and no faster congressional notification than the existing 48-hour requirement.

Gap 122 proposed Art XI-RF §2(f-i) for the same problem — duplicate of Gap 88.

### Resolution Approach

**Placement:** Art XI §15(i)-(k) (three additions to existing Officer Independence section) + Art XI §16 (new Counter-Deployment Operations Protocol with 11 subsections). Both sections placed in the standalone Military Civilian Control Amendment (`02-design/single-topic/military-civilian-control.md`) with compatibility clause updates in Art XI-RF (`02-design/constitution/10-armed-forces.md`).

**External review process:** Two rounds of independent review by two LLMs.

**Round 1 convergence:** Full agreement on: detention too aggressive (narrowed to surrendered/defecting personnel), 48-hour merits timeline unrealistic (expanded to two-stage review), chain of command integrity needs scoping (limited to domestic deployment context), mass removal threshold gameable (cumulative per presidential term with routine-rotation exclusion). Disagreement on activation threshold (R1: too low; R2: appropriate) — resolved by keeping 3-governor minimum with affected-jurisdiction requirement and frivolous activation penalties. R1-only findings: checkpoint/civilian contradiction, undefined "unauthorized deployment," positions undefined, documentation fragile, Senate committee partisan. R2-only findings: nuclear/strategic asset ambiguity, shadow commander loophole, human shield gaming vector, automatic freeze on filing.

**Round 2 convergence:** R1 identified 1 CRITICAL (cross-reference errors), 2 HIGH (TRO weaponization, documentation standard conflict), 5 MEDIUM, 1 LOW. R2 approved text as ready for integration. All R1 findings resolved in v3.

### Constitutional Text Changes

**Art XI §15(i) — Chain of Command Integrity:**

- Scoped to domestic deployment context
- No officer may be ordered to bypass normal chain of command to facilitate unauthorized domestic deployment
- Officers receiving such orders have duty to report to next superior and IG
- Closed civilian advisor loophole: applies to "any person, whether military or civilian, acting under color of executive authority"

**Art XI §15(j) — Court of Military Appeals Review:**

- Officers disciplined for protected refusal may appeal to Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces
- 30-day expedited review with full remedies (reinstatement, back pay, record expungement)
- Pattern of retaliatory discipline triggers §15(c) mass removal review

**Art XI §15(k) — Cumulative Mass Removal Threshold:**

- Measured per presidential term (not rolling window)
- Routine rotation, voluntary retirement, and scheduled end-of-service excluded
- Two-thirds of Senate Armed Services Committee AND ARB review when threshold reached
- ARB participation prevents single partisan committee from certifying purge

**Art XI §16 — Counter-Deployment Operations Protocol (11 subsections):**

**§16(a) — Definitions and Authorization Status:**

- "Unauthorized deployment" defined: domestic military deployment lacking Two-Key authorization, congressional declaration, Insurrection Act compliance, or judicial order
- Documentation failure gives rise to rebuttable presumption of unauthorized status
- Cross-references to §16(h) judicial review and §16(g) documentation timeline

**§16(b) — Activation Determination:**

- Three or more Regional Governors (including at least one whose jurisdiction is directly affected) must concur
- President pro tempore of Senate and Speaker notify Congress within 6 hours
- Fallback: if presiding officers fail to notify within 6 hours, any 5 Senators or 20 Representatives may notify directly

**§16(c) — Authorized Counter-Deployment Actions:**

- 10 enumerated actions: civilian bypass routes, interposition of Guard forces, control of Regional infrastructure, narrowed custody (surrendered/defecting/obstructing), secure communications, mutual aid compacts, evidence preservation, logistics coordination, public communication, cooperation with federal personnel
- Nuclear/strategic exclusion: no interference with nuclear weapons, ICBMs, strategic submarine forces, or nuclear command and control
- Proportionality and minimum-force requirements

**§16(d) — Rules of Engagement:**

- Defensive posture only; no offensive operations against federal forces
- Lethal force only when necessary to prevent imminent death or serious bodily harm
- Prohibited: offensive strikes, aerial combat against federal aircraft, blockade of federal installations, interference with nuclear/strategic assets
- Civilian protection paramount; operations cease if civilian harm unavoidable

**§16(e) — Federal Personnel Status:**

- O-6 and above: affirmative duty to inquire into deployment authorization
- Protected refusal for personnel who decline participation in unauthorized deployment
- Stand-down immunity: narrowed to unauthorized deployment or reasonable reliance on counter-deployment authority
- No criminal liability, discharge, or adverse action for good-faith refusal or stand-down

**§16(f) — Interim Operational Restrictions:**

- "Positions held" defined: all command assignments, staff positions, advisory roles, and institutional appointments
- Frozen pending judicial review; no reassignment, removal, or forced retirement
- Applies to military and civilian defense personnel

**§16(g) — Expedited Congressional Notification:**

- 6-hour notification to Armed Services committees, leadership, and full membership
- Documentation to DoD Inspector General (not Chief Justice): deployment orders, authorization chain, legal opinions, force composition
- Documentation fraud: knowing falsification, destruction, or concealment is a federal felony; no presidential pardon

**§16(h) — Two-Stage Judicial Review:**

- Stage 1: automatic temporary freeze upon Governor petition (affected-jurisdiction requirement); status quo preserved
- Stage 2: 72-hour preliminary order hearing before three-judge Constitutional Court panel; standard is likelihood of success
- Stage 3: 14-day full merits determination
- Magistrate fallback: if no Constitutional Court judge available within 48 hours, federal magistrate may issue preliminary order with automatic transfer within 48 hours
- §16(j) sanctions apply to frivolous petitions

**§16(i) — Post-Crisis Adjudication (Special Civil-Military Review Tribunal):**

- 3 retired federal judges (10yr+ Article III service, clean departure, 15yr recency) + 2 retired general officers (5yr+ service, clean departure) selected by lot
- Eligibility filter: no appointee of the President under review
- Full subpoena, contempt, and classified material authority
- Binding findings on lawfulness; advisory recommendations on policy
- 180-day completion deadline

**§16(j) — Frivolous Activation and Abuse:**

- Governors who activate counter-deployment in bad faith subject to impeachment and criminal liability
- Frivolous petition penalties: filing fees, sanctions, disqualification from future petitions for stated period
- Officers who invoke counter-deployment authority to advance personal or partisan objectives subject to court-martial

**§16(k) — Anti-Gaming Provisions:**

- No Governor may use counter-deployment to resist lawful federal authority (judicial orders, congressional subpoenas, valid Two-Key deployments)
- Counter-deployment authority automatically suspends if the deployment is subsequently validated by judicial review
- Shadow commander prohibition: no civilian official may direct military operations through counter-deployment; operational command remains with uniformed officers

## Gap 49 — House Majoritarianism and Consensus Floor Problem (Equivalence Shield Completion)

**Source:** `04-meta/gaps/08-electoral-judicial.md`, Gap 49 (line ~187)
**Severity:** Medium
**Overlap with existing provisions:** ~70% (HIGH — Parts 1 and 3 fully integrated; Part 2 partially integrated as §6(a)-(c))
**Resolution:** Art II §6(d)-(f) additions — 3 subsections with 20 paragraphs total

### Problem

Gap 49 proposed a three-part solution to prevent mega-Region tyranny through the House: (1) 60% consensus rule for domain-affecting legislation, (2) outcome-based equivalence shield, and (3) mandatory pre-legislative ARB certification. Parts 1 and 3 were fully integrated (Art II §5(c) and §5(d)(1)-(12)). Part 2 was partially integrated (Art II §6(a)-(c): petition mechanism, outcome metrics, provisional compliance) but missing three critical subsections: determination timeline, renewal/review cycle, and anti-circumvention safeguards. Without these, the ARB had no deadline to rule on equivalence petitions, granted exemptions persisted permanently without re-verification, and the equivalence mechanism could be weaponized as a deregulation loophole.

### Resolution Approach

**Placement:** Art II §6(d)-(f) inserted after existing §6(c)(4) and before §6-A (Infrastructure Prioritization Transparency) in `02-design/constitution/02-powers-and-rights.md`.

**External review process:** Two rounds of independent review by two LLMs.

**Round 1 convergence:** R1 identified 2 HIGH (auto-approval too strong, asymmetry with §5(d)(7)), 4 MEDIUM (no tolling, 90% threshold too blunt, exogenous exception too broad, private enforcement lacks limits), 1 LOW (cross-ref fix). R2 endorsed draft, called auto-approval "correctly biased against federal obstruction." Disagreement resolved: auto-approval changed from final to provisional + mandamus (preserves R2's principle while closing R1's gaming vector). All R1 findings accepted.

**Round 2 convergence:** R1 identified 1 HIGH (indefinite provisional still possible), 2 MEDIUM (metric directionality ambiguity, exogenous cause stall), 1 LOW (damages standing scope). R2 approved v2 as ready for integration. All R1 findings resolved in v3: mandamus broadened to any standing party + provisional suspension backstop, metric polarity designation added, exogenous cause deemed-denied default added, damages explicitly limited to residents.

### Constitutional Text Changes

**Art II §6(d) — Board Determination Timeline (7 paragraphs):**

- 270-day determination deadline with 120-day preliminary assessment
- Tolling for Region non-cooperation with data requests
- Provisional approval on timeout (not final); mandamus available to any standing party
- Provisional suspension backstop: if no mandamus sought within 90 days after 180-day post-timeout period, provisional status suspended
- Expedited 90-day track for renewals, similar petitions, and first-year National Floors
- Good-cause extension (90 days, one per petition, published rationale)
- Non-cooperation penalty: 3-year expedited disqualification + additional bond

**Art II §6(e) — Renewal and Review (6 paragraphs):**

- 5-year exemption duration with renewal window (12 months to 6 months before expiration)
- Annual monitoring: Region reports + Board assessment, publicly available
- Mid-term review triggered by 2 consecutive years of material divergence
- Domain-sensitive divergence thresholds: Board specifies per-metric within 85-95% range with polarity designation; default 90%; "materially below" means worse in designated direction
- Exogenous cause exception: requires Board certification within 60 days (deemed denied on failure to act), limited to 2-year exclusion, publicly reported
- Lapse and transition: clear expiration + 180-day compliance + limited late-filing grace

**Art II §6(f) — Anti-Circumvention and Integrity (7 paragraphs):**

- No race to bottom: equivalence requires equal or superior outcomes, not formal compliance
- Serial refiling prohibition: 12-month cooling period unless materially redesigned
- Provisional abuse prevention: no provisional status on refiling; compliance clock continues
- Outcome measurement integrity: Board specifies measurement; raw data access; independent verification; fraud = revocation + 5-year disqualification
- Exemption stacking: cumulative impact assessed at initial grant and renewal
- Constitutional minimum exclusion: §4(h) minimums exempt per §4(k)(1) permanence; Art III-RF rights; Art I obligations
- Enforcement: standing enumerated (residents, regulated entities, affected Regions); administrative exhaustion required; damages limited to residents; injunctive relief available to all standing parties

### Gaming Vectors Addressed

- G1 "Permanent Provisional" → 270-day deadline + mandamus (any standing party) + provisional suspension backstop
- G2 "Outcome Degradation" → annual monitoring + mid-term review at 2yr divergence
- G3 "Serial Refiling" → 12-month prohibition unless materially redesigned
- G4 "Provisional Loop" → no provisional on refiling; compliance clock continues
- G5 "Data Manipulation" → Board specifies measurement; raw data access; independent verification
- G6 "Metric Cherry-Pick" → Board specifies metrics and methodology in preliminary assessment
- G7 "Exemption Stacking" → cumulative impact at initial grant and renewal
- G8 "Constitutional Minimum Bypass" → §4(h) excluded citing §4(k)(1) permanence
- G14 "Data Drag" → tolling + non-cooperation penalty
- G15 "Benchmark Gaming" → ARB fills metric gaps; outcome equivalence not formal compliance
- G16 "Litigation Shield" → administrative exhaustion + standing limits
- G17 "Exogenous Stall" → deemed denied after 60 days
- G18 "Metric Inversion" → polarity designation + directional "worse than" standard

### Files Modified

- `04-meta/gaps/08-electoral-judicial.md` — Gap 49 status: PROPOSAL AVAILABLE → RESOLVED
- `04-meta/gaps/00-index.md` — Gap 49 status: Requires Development → Resolved
- `04-meta/02-identified-gaps.md` — Statistics updated (Requires Development 26→25, Resolved 146→147)
