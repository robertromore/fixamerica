## 2026-02-03: Triage Fix — Reclassify 30 Gaps from Requires Development to Proposal Available

Systematic audit of all 30 gaps listed as "Requires Development" in the index priority tables (`04-meta/gaps/00-index.md`) revealed that all 30 have detailed proposals ("PROPOSAL AVAILABLE") in their respective thematic files. The index had never been updated to reflect the proposal work.

### Root Cause

Proposals were written into the thematic gap files (Categories 07-18) but the index priority tables and summary statistics were not updated in parallel. The discrepancy accumulated across multiple drafting sessions.

### Changes

- `04-meta/gaps/00-index.md` — All 30 `Requires Development` entries changed to `Proposal Available`; version bumped to 1.6
- `04-meta/02-identified-gaps.md` — Statistics updated: RD 23 to 0, PA 4 to 27

### Impact

- Requires Development: 23 to 0
- Proposal Available: 4 to 27
- Total gap count unchanged (235)

## 2026-02-03: Gaps 67 + 75 — Infrastructure Ransom + Fee-Gouging Confirmed Resolved (Article I Section 6)

Detailed comparison of Gap 67 and 75 proposals against existing constitutional text in Article I, Section 6 revealed that **both gaps were already fully integrated** into the constitutional text. The proposals match the existing subsections (d)-(z) exactly (with enhancements), as documented in the integration map at `04-meta/05-article-i-section-6-integration.md` (dated 2026-01-25).

### Problem

**Gap 67 (Infrastructure Ransom):** Article I, Section 6 prohibits "unreasonable conditioning" of infrastructure access but did not define "unreasonable" for maintenance shutdowns, enabling Regions to strangle neighbors' economies through prolonged closures, rolling maintenance blockades, inspection slowdowns, and rate manipulation.

**Gap 75 (Fee-Gouging Loophole):** "Reasonable and non-discriminatory" fee standard was subjective, enabling gatekeeper Regions to extract rents through maintenance premiums, climate surcharges, variable rates, and ancillary fee multiplication.

### Finding

All proposal elements are present in the existing constitutional text:

**Gap 67 mapping (5 parts):**

| Proposal | Integrated Location | Status |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| Part 1: Emergency Shutdown Review (72-hr trigger, safety necessity standard, 7-day presumption) | Art I Section 6(d)-(f) | Full match + enhanced (automatic referral for failure to file) |
| Part 2: Anti-Cumulative Obstruction (cumulative assessment, rolling maintenance limits, processing standards) | Art I Section 6(g)-(i) | Full match + enhanced (alternative route requirements at Section 6(h)) |
| Part 3: Rate Regulation (rate reasonableness, cost-based rates, dispute freeze) | Art I Section 6(j)-(l) | Full match + enhanced (void provision for restriction-period increases) |
| Part 4: Remedies and Escalation (damages, federal operation, repeat offender) | Art I Section 6(m)-(p) | Full match + enhanced (treble damages for bad faith, personal liability) |
| Part 5: NITS (transparency system) | Art I Section 6(q)-(t) | Full match + enhanced (fee data consolidated from Gap 75) |

**Gap 75 mapping (3 parts):**

| Proposal | Integrated Location | Status |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| Part 1: Cost-Plus Maximum (110% ceiling, prohibited inclusions, ancillary aggregation) | Art I Section 6(u)-(v) | Full match (prohibited inclusions merged into aggregate limitation) |
| Part 2: ARB Summary Authority (fee review, expedited timeline, burden of proof) | Art I Section 6(w) | Full match (consolidated into single 5-clause subsection) |
| Part 3: Anti-Retaliation and Transparency (non-retaliation, challenger protection, whistleblower) | Art I Section 6(x)-(z) | Full match (fee transparency integrated into NITS at Section 6(q)-(t)) |

### Design Enhancements Found in Constitutional Text

The integrated text includes improvements beyond the original proposals:

- **Treble damages** for bad-faith restrictions with personal liability for officials (Section 6(n))
- **Alternative route requirements** during closures at Region's expense (Section 6(h))
- **Unified NITS** consolidating closure and fee transparency (Section 6(q)(5)-(6), (t)(2)(6))
- **Aggregate fee limitation** explicitly closing multiplication via multiple fee categories (Section 6(v))
- **Summary suspension** with detailed 5-part burden-shifting framework (Section 6(w))

### Additional Finding: Art I Section 6(aa)-(hh) Maintenance Standards

The constitutional text also contains subsections (aa)-(hh) covering minimum maintenance standards, critical corridor designation, manufactured safety necessity doctrine, federal maintenance backstop, and private right of action for manufactured decay. These provisions substantially correspond to Gap 83 (Infrastructure Decay) proposals. Gap 83 resolution status should be investigated separately (note: index Gap 83 description "Pipeline and hazardous material transport" does not match thematic file Gap 83 "Infrastructure Decay as Regional Coercion" — numbering discrepancy to resolve).

## 2026-02-03: Gaps 128 + 132 + 142 — Proxy Blockade + Foreign Divestment + Stigma Barrier Resolved (Article I Section 6)

Three interstate commerce gaps resolved through new constitutional text in Article I-RF, Section 6, subsections (ii)-(rr). Drafted via multi-LLM protocol: v1 → Round 1 review (2 reviewers, 11 convergent findings) → v2 → Round 2 review (2 reviewers, 5 surgical fixes) → v3 (FINAL) → integration. Former subsection (hh) renumbered to (ss).

### Problem

**Gap 128 (Mercenary Proxy Blockade):** Article I, Section 6 prohibits direct Regional infrastructure blockades but does not address privatized coercion. Regions could subsidize private security contractors, community associations, or licensed businesses to conduct "voluntary safety inspections" of interstate freight, achieving de facto blockade while claiming no direct command over private actors.

**Gap 132 (Sovereignty Dilution via Foreign Divestment):** Regions could sell critical inter-Regional infrastructure to foreign entities, rendering constitutional enforcement provisions unenforceable. Foreign owners operating under bilateral investment treaties or sovereign immunity could bypass ARB orders, NITS reporting, and federal operational assumption.

**Gap 142 (Secondary Boycott Stigma Barrier):** Regions could weaponize mandatory labeling to stigmatize other Regions' goods — requiring labels like "Produced under exploitative labor conditions" or "From a Region that restricts reproductive rights" — achieving de facto trade barriers through information warfare while claiming consumer protection.

### Solution

10 new subsections added to Article I-RF, Section 6:

**Gap 128 mapping (3 subsections):**

| Proposal Part | Integrated Location | Status |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| Part 1: Regional Attribution Rule (strict liability for private actor blockades; narrowed nexus to material support, contracts, delegated functions, special privileges) | Art I §6(ii) | Full match + enhanced (cumulative delay aggregation; ARB methodology delegation) |
| Part 2: Proxy Entity Designation (ARB designation with constructive coordination; scoped attribution per designation order) | Art I §6(jj) | Full match + enhanced (split foreign proxy remedies: corridor-controlling → §6(oo) emergency operation; non-corridor → expedited §6(kk) injunction with doubled penalties) |
| Part 3: Federal Injunction Authority (DOJ enforcement; penalty scaled to greater of $10M or 3x damages) | Art I §6(kk) | Full match + enhanced (cross-references to §6(n) treble damages and §6(p) repeat offender) |

**Gap 132 mapping (4 subsections):**

| Proposal Part | Integrated Location | Status |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| Part 1: Divestment Approval (Senate approval with tiered threshold: 25% general / 10% SOE) | Art I §6(ll) | Full match + enhanced (retroactive review mandate with due process: notice, 90-day response, oral testimony; deemed-denied default) |
| Part 2: Treaty Subordination (domestic constitutional supremacy; takings reconciliation) | Art I §6(mm) | Full match + enhanced (explicit domestic due process preserved) |
| Part 3: Ownership Transparency (beneficial ownership disclosure; successor liability) | Art I §6(nn) | Full match + enhanced (NITS publication) |
| Part 4: Emergency Federal Operation (federal operation of foreign-owned infrastructure during compliance deadlock) | Art I §6(oo) | Full match (cross-reference to §6(o) standards) |

**Gap 142 mapping (3 subsections):**

| Proposal Part | Integrated Location | Status |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| Part 1: Political Labeling Prohibition (political/social/moral/ideological characterization labels prohibited; per se violation) | Art I §6(pp) | Full match + enhanced (characterization definition; NITS reporting) |
| Part 2: Permissible Consumer Disclosures (objective federally-verified product metrics only) | Art I §6(qq) | Full match + enhanced (two-track ARB review: 14-day emergency injunction + 60-day final determination; named verifying agencies: FDA, CPSC, EPA) |
| Part 3: Stigma Barrier Enforcement (penalty scaled to greater of $10M or 3x economic harm; rulemaking authority suspension) | Art I §6(rr) | Full match + enhanced (federally-verified product metrics requirement) |

### Key Design Decisions

- **Attribution nexus narrowed** (v2): Material support, contracts, delegated functions, special privileges — excludes ordinary licensed businesses
- **Constructive coordination** (v2): Entities without formal ties captured via coordination-with-Region standard
- **Foreign proxy split** (v3): Corridor-controlling proxies get emergency federal operation (§6(oo)); non-corridor proxies get expedited injunction with doubled penalties
- **Retroactive review due process** (v3): Formal notice, 90-day response period, oral testimony opportunity
- **Two-track ARB review** (v3): 14-day emergency injunction + 60-day final determination
- **Named verifying agencies** (v3): FDA, CPSC, EPA specified rather than generic "federal" reference

### Files Modified

## 2026-02-03: Gaps 92 + 116 — Technical Standards Interoperability Resolved (Article II Section 4)

Two interstate commerce gaps resolved through new constitutional text in Article II-RF, Section 4, subsections (l)-(s). Drafted via multi-LLM protocol: v1 → Round 1 review (2 reviewers, 10 findings: 2 convergent, 7 complementary, 0 contradictions) → v2 → Round 2 review (1 reviewer, 5 findings) → v3 (FINAL) → integration. Gap 116 consolidated into Gap 92 as supplement.

### Problem

**Gap 92 (Technical Standards as de facto Secession):** Article I, Section 6 guarantees the Right of Transit and Article II, Section 4 establishes the Concurrent Authority Framework with "Floors, Not Ceilings." However, a Region could adopt proprietary technical standards for its power grid (unique voltage/frequency/connector), rail signaling (incompatible gauge), or digital credentials (proprietary identity systems) that are "technically superior" but physically impossible for neighboring Regions to interface with — achieving functional secession through engineering rather than law.

**Gap 116 (Administrative Veto via Technical Standard-Setting):** Supplement to Gap 92. Without a federal standard-setting authority with backward compatibility requirements and pre-implementation review, Regions could fragment the National Common Market through uncoordinated technical standards.

### Solution

8 new subsections added to Article II-RF, Section 4:

| Proposal Part | Integrated Location | Status |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| Infrastructure Interoperability Mandate | Art II §4(l) | Permanent prohibition on material barriers |
| Critical Infrastructure Definition (6 categories + NIST expandable) | Art II §4(m) | Power, rail, highways, digital identity, telecom, pipeline |
| Material Barrier Standard (5 tests, tiered thresholds) | Art II §4(n) | 2hr physical, 5sec digital, NIST-calibrated energy, 30min telecom |
| Federal Interoperability Floors (NIST) | Art II §4(o) | 5-year review cycle, interim standards with precedence rule |
| Regional Innovation + Pre-Implementation Certification | Art II §4(p)-(q) | Backward compatibility, deemed approval with provisional status |
| Enforcement and Remediation | Art II §4(r) | 180-day remediation, federal implementation, repeat offender with split tie-breaker |
| Anti-Circumvention + Innovation Protection | Art II §4(s)(1)-(4) | Cybersecurity patch exemption, vendor lock-in prohibition, permanence |
| Data Sovereignty Deconfliction | Art II §4(s)(5) | Privacy-preserving protocols, 90-day joint resolution clock, Constitutional Court referral |

### Key Design Decisions

- **NIST as technical arbiter** (v2): "Acting through NIST" specified rather than generic "Commerce" — domain expertise over political maneuvering
- **Deemed approval with provisional status** (v2+v3): Silence = certification prevents administrative veto (Gap 116's core vulnerability); provisional status with "DEEMED — NOT REVIEWED" designation and interim injunction authority prevents bad-standard lock-in
- **Tiered delay thresholds** (v2): 2hr physical freight, 5sec digital credentials, NIST-calibrated energy with 100ms/5sec interim floor, 30min telecom — applies distinct physical laws to distinct infrastructure types
- **Cybersecurity patch exemption** (v2): Security updates that don't alter interoperability characteristics excluded from annual change limit
- **Repeat offender default + tie-breaker** (v3): 120-day clock deemed approval with ARB monitoring conditions; ARB prevails on barrier questions, NIST on technical feasibility
- **Open-standards safety exception** (v3): NIST-certified proprietary adoption when no open equivalent exists, with mandatory open-standard development obligation
- **Data sovereignty 90-day clock** (v3): Privacy-preserving interim mode pending judicial review; Constitutional Court referral for unresolved disputes

### Files Modified
