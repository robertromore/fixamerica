## 2026-02-03: Triage Fix — Reclassify 30 Gaps from Requires Development to Proposal Available

Systematic audit of all 30 gaps listed as "Requires Development" in the index priority tables (`04-meta/gaps/00-index.md`) revealed that all 30 have detailed proposals ("PROPOSAL AVAILABLE") in their respective thematic files. The index had never been updated to reflect the proposal work.

### Root Cause

Proposals were written into the thematic gap files (Categories 07-18) but the index priority tables and summary statistics were not updated in parallel. The discrepancy accumulated across multiple drafting sessions.

### Changes

- `04-meta/gaps/00-index.md` — All 30 `Requires Development` entries changed to `Proposal Available`; version bumped to 1.6
- `04-meta/02-identified-gaps.md` — Statistics updated: RD 23 to 0, PA 4 to 27

### Impact

- Requires Development: 23 to 0
- Proposal Available: 4 to 27
- Total gap count unchanged (235)

## 2026-02-03: Gaps 67 + 75 — Infrastructure Ransom + Fee-Gouging Confirmed Resolved (Article I Section 6)

Detailed comparison of Gap 67 and 75 proposals against existing constitutional text in Article I, Section 6 revealed that **both gaps were already fully integrated** into the constitutional text. The proposals match the existing subsections (d)-(z) exactly (with enhancements), as documented in the integration map at `04-meta/05-article-i-section-6-integration.md` (dated 2026-01-25).

### Problem

**Gap 67 (Infrastructure Ransom):** Article I, Section 6 prohibits "unreasonable conditioning" of infrastructure access but did not define "unreasonable" for maintenance shutdowns, enabling Regions to strangle neighbors' economies through prolonged closures, rolling maintenance blockades, inspection slowdowns, and rate manipulation.

**Gap 75 (Fee-Gouging Loophole):** "Reasonable and non-discriminatory" fee standard was subjective, enabling gatekeeper Regions to extract rents through maintenance premiums, climate surcharges, variable rates, and ancillary fee multiplication.

### Finding

All proposal elements are present in the existing constitutional text:

**Gap 67 mapping (5 parts):**

| Proposal | Integrated Location | Status |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| Part 1: Emergency Shutdown Review (72-hr trigger, safety necessity standard, 7-day presumption) | Art I Section 6(d)-(f) | Full match + enhanced (automatic referral for failure to file) |
| Part 2: Anti-Cumulative Obstruction (cumulative assessment, rolling maintenance limits, processing standards) | Art I Section 6(g)-(i) | Full match + enhanced (alternative route requirements at Section 6(h)) |
| Part 3: Rate Regulation (rate reasonableness, cost-based rates, dispute freeze) | Art I Section 6(j)-(l) | Full match + enhanced (void provision for restriction-period increases) |
| Part 4: Remedies and Escalation (damages, federal operation, repeat offender) | Art I Section 6(m)-(p) | Full match + enhanced (treble damages for bad faith, personal liability) |
| Part 5: NITS (transparency system) | Art I Section 6(q)-(t) | Full match + enhanced (fee data consolidated from Gap 75) |

**Gap 75 mapping (3 parts):**

| Proposal | Integrated Location | Status |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| Part 1: Cost-Plus Maximum (110% ceiling, prohibited inclusions, ancillary aggregation) | Art I Section 6(u)-(v) | Full match (prohibited inclusions merged into aggregate limitation) |
| Part 2: ARB Summary Authority (fee review, expedited timeline, burden of proof) | Art I Section 6(w) | Full match (consolidated into single 5-clause subsection) |
| Part 3: Anti-Retaliation and Transparency (non-retaliation, challenger protection, whistleblower) | Art I Section 6(x)-(z) | Full match (fee transparency integrated into NITS at Section 6(q)-(t)) |

### Design Enhancements Found in Constitutional Text

The integrated text includes improvements beyond the original proposals:

- **Treble damages** for bad-faith restrictions with personal liability for officials (Section 6(n))
- **Alternative route requirements** during closures at Region's expense (Section 6(h))
- **Unified NITS** consolidating closure and fee transparency (Section 6(q)(5)-(6), (t)(2)(6))
- **Aggregate fee limitation** explicitly closing multiplication via multiple fee categories (Section 6(v))
- **Summary suspension** with detailed 5-part burden-shifting framework (Section 6(w))

### Additional Finding: Art I Section 6(aa)-(hh) Maintenance Standards

The constitutional text also contains subsections (aa)-(hh) covering minimum maintenance standards, critical corridor designation, manufactured safety necessity doctrine, federal maintenance backstop, and private right of action for manufactured decay. These provisions substantially correspond to Gap 83 (Infrastructure Decay) proposals. Gap 83 resolution status should be investigated separately (note: index Gap 83 description "Pipeline and hazardous material transport" does not match thematic file Gap 83 "Infrastructure Decay as Regional Coercion" — numbering discrepancy to resolve).
