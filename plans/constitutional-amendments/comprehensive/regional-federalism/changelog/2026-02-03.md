# Changelog: February 3, 2026

## 2026-02-03: Triage Fix — Reclassify 30 Gaps from Requires Development to Proposal Available

Systematic audit of all 30 gaps listed as "Requires Development" in the index priority tables (`04-meta/gaps/00-index.md`) revealed that all 30 have detailed proposals ("PROPOSAL AVAILABLE") in their respective thematic files. The index had never been updated to reflect the proposal work.

### Root Cause

Proposals were written into the thematic gap files (Categories 07-18) but the index priority tables and summary statistics were not updated in parallel. The discrepancy accumulated across multiple drafting sessions.

### Changes

- `04-meta/gaps/00-index.md` — All 30 `Requires Development` entries changed to `Proposal Available`; version bumped to 1.6
- `04-meta/02-identified-gaps.md` — Statistics updated: RD 23 to 0, PA 4 to 27

### Impact

- Requires Development: 23 to 0
- Proposal Available: 4 to 27
- Total gap count unchanged (235)

## 2026-02-03: Gaps 67 + 75 — Infrastructure Ransom + Fee-Gouging Confirmed Resolved (Article I Section 6)

Detailed comparison of Gap 67 and 75 proposals against existing constitutional text in Article I, Section 6 revealed that **both gaps were already fully integrated** into the constitutional text. The proposals match the existing subsections (d)-(z) exactly (with enhancements), as documented in the integration map at `04-meta/05-article-i-section-6-integration.md` (dated 2026-01-25).

### Problem

**Gap 67 (Infrastructure Ransom):** Article I, Section 6 prohibits "unreasonable conditioning" of infrastructure access but did not define "unreasonable" for maintenance shutdowns, enabling Regions to strangle neighbors' economies through prolonged closures, rolling maintenance blockades, inspection slowdowns, and rate manipulation.

**Gap 75 (Fee-Gouging Loophole):** "Reasonable and non-discriminatory" fee standard was subjective, enabling gatekeeper Regions to extract rents through maintenance premiums, climate surcharges, variable rates, and ancillary fee multiplication.

### Finding

All proposal elements are present in the existing constitutional text:

**Gap 67 mapping (5 parts):**

| Proposal | Integrated Location | Status |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| Part 1: Emergency Shutdown Review (72-hr trigger, safety necessity standard, 7-day presumption) | Art I Section 6(d)-(f) | Full match + enhanced (automatic referral for failure to file) |
| Part 2: Anti-Cumulative Obstruction (cumulative assessment, rolling maintenance limits, processing standards) | Art I Section 6(g)-(i) | Full match + enhanced (alternative route requirements at Section 6(h)) |
| Part 3: Rate Regulation (rate reasonableness, cost-based rates, dispute freeze) | Art I Section 6(j)-(l) | Full match + enhanced (void provision for restriction-period increases) |
| Part 4: Remedies and Escalation (damages, federal operation, repeat offender) | Art I Section 6(m)-(p) | Full match + enhanced (treble damages for bad faith, personal liability) |
| Part 5: NITS (transparency system) | Art I Section 6(q)-(t) | Full match + enhanced (fee data consolidated from Gap 75) |

**Gap 75 mapping (3 parts):**

| Proposal | Integrated Location | Status |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| Part 1: Cost-Plus Maximum (110% ceiling, prohibited inclusions, ancillary aggregation) | Art I Section 6(u)-(v) | Full match (prohibited inclusions merged into aggregate limitation) |
| Part 2: ARB Summary Authority (fee review, expedited timeline, burden of proof) | Art I Section 6(w) | Full match (consolidated into single 5-clause subsection) |
| Part 3: Anti-Retaliation and Transparency (non-retaliation, challenger protection, whistleblower) | Art I Section 6(x)-(z) | Full match (fee transparency integrated into NITS at Section 6(q)-(t)) |

### Design Enhancements Found in Constitutional Text

The integrated text includes improvements beyond the original proposals:

- **Treble damages** for bad-faith restrictions with personal liability for officials (Section 6(n))
- **Alternative route requirements** during closures at Region's expense (Section 6(h))
- **Unified NITS** consolidating closure and fee transparency (Section 6(q)(5)-(6), (t)(2)(6))
- **Aggregate fee limitation** explicitly closing multiplication via multiple fee categories (Section 6(v))
- **Summary suspension** with detailed 5-part burden-shifting framework (Section 6(w))

### Additional Finding: Art I Section 6(aa)-(hh) Maintenance Standards

The constitutional text also contains subsections (aa)-(hh) covering minimum maintenance standards, critical corridor designation, manufactured safety necessity doctrine, federal maintenance backstop, and private right of action for manufactured decay. These provisions substantially correspond to Gap 83 (Infrastructure Decay) proposals. Gap 83 resolution status should be investigated separately (note: index Gap 83 description "Pipeline and hazardous material transport" does not match thematic file Gap 83 "Infrastructure Decay as Regional Coercion" — numbering discrepancy to resolve).

## 2026-02-03: Gaps 128 + 132 + 142 — Proxy Blockade + Foreign Divestment + Stigma Barrier Resolved (Article I Section 6)

Three interstate commerce gaps resolved through new constitutional text in Article I-RF, Section 6, subsections (ii)-(rr). Drafted via multi-LLM protocol: v1 → Round 1 review (2 reviewers, 11 convergent findings) → v2 → Round 2 review (2 reviewers, 5 surgical fixes) → v3 (FINAL) → integration. Former subsection (hh) renumbered to (ss).

### Problem

**Gap 128 (Mercenary Proxy Blockade):** Article I, Section 6 prohibits direct Regional infrastructure blockades but does not address privatized coercion. Regions could subsidize private security contractors, community associations, or licensed businesses to conduct "voluntary safety inspections" of interstate freight, achieving de facto blockade while claiming no direct command over private actors.

**Gap 132 (Sovereignty Dilution via Foreign Divestment):** Regions could sell critical inter-Regional infrastructure to foreign entities, rendering constitutional enforcement provisions unenforceable. Foreign owners operating under bilateral investment treaties or sovereign immunity could bypass ARB orders, NITS reporting, and federal operational assumption.

**Gap 142 (Secondary Boycott Stigma Barrier):** Regions could weaponize mandatory labeling to stigmatize other Regions' goods — requiring labels like "Produced under exploitative labor conditions" or "From a Region that restricts reproductive rights" — achieving de facto trade barriers through information warfare while claiming consumer protection.

### Solution

10 new subsections added to Article I-RF, Section 6:

**Gap 128 mapping (3 subsections):**

| Proposal Part | Integrated Location | Status |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| Part 1: Regional Attribution Rule (strict liability for private actor blockades; narrowed nexus to material support, contracts, delegated functions, special privileges) | Art I §6(ii) | Full match + enhanced (cumulative delay aggregation; ARB methodology delegation) |
| Part 2: Proxy Entity Designation (ARB designation with constructive coordination; scoped attribution per designation order) | Art I §6(jj) | Full match + enhanced (split foreign proxy remedies: corridor-controlling → §6(oo) emergency operation; non-corridor → expedited §6(kk) injunction with doubled penalties) |
| Part 3: Federal Injunction Authority (DOJ enforcement; penalty scaled to greater of $10M or 3x damages) | Art I §6(kk) | Full match + enhanced (cross-references to §6(n) treble damages and §6(p) repeat offender) |

**Gap 132 mapping (4 subsections):**

| Proposal Part | Integrated Location | Status |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| Part 1: Divestment Approval (Senate approval with tiered threshold: 25% general / 10% SOE) | Art I §6(ll) | Full match + enhanced (retroactive review mandate with due process: notice, 90-day response, oral testimony; deemed-denied default) |
| Part 2: Treaty Subordination (domestic constitutional supremacy; takings reconciliation) | Art I §6(mm) | Full match + enhanced (explicit domestic due process preserved) |
| Part 3: Ownership Transparency (beneficial ownership disclosure; successor liability) | Art I §6(nn) | Full match + enhanced (NITS publication) |
| Part 4: Emergency Federal Operation (federal operation of foreign-owned infrastructure during compliance deadlock) | Art I §6(oo) | Full match (cross-reference to §6(o) standards) |

**Gap 142 mapping (3 subsections):**

| Proposal Part | Integrated Location | Status |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| Part 1: Political Labeling Prohibition (political/social/moral/ideological characterization labels prohibited; per se violation) | Art I §6(pp) | Full match + enhanced (characterization definition; NITS reporting) |
| Part 2: Permissible Consumer Disclosures (objective federally-verified product metrics only) | Art I §6(qq) | Full match + enhanced (two-track ARB review: 14-day emergency injunction + 60-day final determination; named verifying agencies: FDA, CPSC, EPA) |
| Part 3: Stigma Barrier Enforcement (penalty scaled to greater of $10M or 3x economic harm; rulemaking authority suspension) | Art I §6(rr) | Full match + enhanced (federally-verified product metrics requirement) |

### Key Design Decisions

- **Attribution nexus narrowed** (v2): Material support, contracts, delegated functions, special privileges — excludes ordinary licensed businesses
- **Constructive coordination** (v2): Entities without formal ties captured via coordination-with-Region standard
- **Foreign proxy split** (v3): Corridor-controlling proxies get emergency federal operation (§6(oo)); non-corridor proxies get expedited injunction with doubled penalties
- **Retroactive review due process** (v3): Formal notice, 90-day response period, oral testimony opportunity
- **Two-track ARB review** (v3): 14-day emergency injunction + 60-day final determination
- **Named verifying agencies** (v3): FDA, CPSC, EPA specified rather than generic "federal" reference

### Files Modified

- `02-design/constitution/01-regional-structure.md` — Art I §6 expanded: 10 new subsections (ii)-(rr) inserted; former (hh) renumbered to (ss); three new section group headers added
- `02-design/drafts/gap-128-132-142-art-i-s6-expansion.md` — Draft file created (v1 → v2 → v3 FINAL)

## 2026-02-03: Gaps 92 + 116 — Technical Standards Interoperability Resolved (Article II Section 4)

Two interstate commerce gaps resolved through new constitutional text in Article II-RF, Section 4, subsections (l)-(s). Drafted via multi-LLM protocol: v1 → Round 1 review (2 reviewers, 10 findings: 2 convergent, 7 complementary, 0 contradictions) → v2 → Round 2 review (1 reviewer, 5 findings) → v3 (FINAL) → integration. Gap 116 consolidated into Gap 92 as supplement.

### Problem

**Gap 92 (Technical Standards as de facto Secession):** Article I, Section 6 guarantees the Right of Transit and Article II, Section 4 establishes the Concurrent Authority Framework with "Floors, Not Ceilings." However, a Region could adopt proprietary technical standards for its power grid (unique voltage/frequency/connector), rail signaling (incompatible gauge), or digital credentials (proprietary identity systems) that are "technically superior" but physically impossible for neighboring Regions to interface with — achieving functional secession through engineering rather than law.

**Gap 116 (Administrative Veto via Technical Standard-Setting):** Supplement to Gap 92. Without a federal standard-setting authority with backward compatibility requirements and pre-implementation review, Regions could fragment the National Common Market through uncoordinated technical standards.

### Solution

8 new subsections added to Article II-RF, Section 4:

| Proposal Part | Integrated Location | Status |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| Infrastructure Interoperability Mandate | Art II §4(l) | Permanent prohibition on material barriers |
| Critical Infrastructure Definition (6 categories + NIST expandable) | Art II §4(m) | Power, rail, highways, digital identity, telecom, pipeline |
| Material Barrier Standard (5 tests, tiered thresholds) | Art II §4(n) | 2hr physical, 5sec digital, NIST-calibrated energy, 30min telecom |
| Federal Interoperability Floors (NIST) | Art II §4(o) | 5-year review cycle, interim standards with precedence rule |
| Regional Innovation + Pre-Implementation Certification | Art II §4(p)-(q) | Backward compatibility, deemed approval with provisional status |
| Enforcement and Remediation | Art II §4(r) | 180-day remediation, federal implementation, repeat offender with split tie-breaker |
| Anti-Circumvention + Innovation Protection | Art II §4(s)(1)-(4) | Cybersecurity patch exemption, vendor lock-in prohibition, permanence |
| Data Sovereignty Deconfliction | Art II §4(s)(5) | Privacy-preserving protocols, 90-day joint resolution clock, Constitutional Court referral |

### Key Design Decisions

- **NIST as technical arbiter** (v2): "Acting through NIST" specified rather than generic "Commerce" — domain expertise over political maneuvering
- **Deemed approval with provisional status** (v2+v3): Silence = certification prevents administrative veto (Gap 116's core vulnerability); provisional status with "DEEMED — NOT REVIEWED" designation and interim injunction authority prevents bad-standard lock-in
- **Tiered delay thresholds** (v2): 2hr physical freight, 5sec digital credentials, NIST-calibrated energy with 100ms/5sec interim floor, 30min telecom — applies distinct physical laws to distinct infrastructure types
- **Cybersecurity patch exemption** (v2): Security updates that don't alter interoperability characteristics excluded from annual change limit
- **Repeat offender default + tie-breaker** (v3): 120-day clock deemed approval with ARB monitoring conditions; ARB prevails on barrier questions, NIST on technical feasibility
- **Open-standards safety exception** (v3): NIST-certified proprietary adoption when no open equivalent exists, with mandatory open-standard development obligation
- **Data sovereignty 90-day clock** (v3): Privacy-preserving interim mode pending judicial review; Constitutional Court referral for unresolved disputes

### Files Modified

- `02-design/constitution/02-powers-and-rights.md` — Art II §4 expanded: 8 new subsections (l)-(s) inserted after existing (k); section group header "Critical Infrastructure Interoperability" added
- `02-design/drafts/gap-092-116-infrastructure-interoperability.md` — Draft file created (v1 → v2 → v3 FINAL)

## 2026-02-03: Gap 99 — Tribal Veto via Infrastructure Entrapment Resolved (Article XX Section 3)

One interstate commerce gap resolved through new constitutional text in Article XX-RF, Section 3, subsections (g)-(t). Drafted via multi-LLM protocol: v1 → Round 1 review (2 reviewers, 11 findings: 1 convergent, 7 complementary, 1 partial contradiction) → v2 → Round 2 review (2 reviewers, 5 findings: 4 surgical fixes, 1 design choice retained) → v3 (FINAL) → integration.

### Problem

**Gap 99 (Tribal Veto via Infrastructure Entrapment):** Article XX, Section 3 protects tribal sovereignty and Article XXIII establishes "free, prior, and informed consent" for any federal action diminishing tribal sovereignty. Hostile actors could exploit these protections by encouraging Tribal Nations to withhold consent for National Interest Corridors traversing tribal land, achieving proxy blockade through sovereignty rather than direct action — while the Tribal Nation bears the political cost and the manipulating Region enjoys the economic benefit.

### Solution

14 new subsections added to Article XX-RF, Section 3, organized in 4 parts:

**Part 1: NIC Definition and Sovereign Mediation Panel (g-k):**

| Proposal Part | Integrated Location | Status |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| NIC Definition (Joint Resolution + unified feasibility standard) | Art XX §3(g) | Full match + enhanced (⅗ Senate vote, NIST cross-reference to §3(m)(2) feasibility) |
| Sovereign Mediation Panel (retired Art III judge, multi-tribal, multi-Region) | Art XX §3(h) | Full match + enhanced (Chief Justice roster, §3(h)(5) consolidated multi-tribal panel, §3(h)(6) multi-Region representation) |
| Mediation Timeline (180 days + tolling) | Art XX §3(i) | Full match + enhanced (60-day expedited interlocutory appeal with tolling at §3(i)(5)) |
| Scope Limitation | Art XX §3(j) | Full match |
| Good Faith (300% base-FMV-only threshold, bad-faith asymmetry) | Art XX §3(k) | Full match |

**Part 2: Resolution Mechanisms (l-n):**

| Proposal Part | Integrated Location | Status |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| Negotiated Resolution Preference | Art XX §3(l) | Full match |
| Re-routing Obligation ("reasonably constructible," quantified burden assessment) | Art XX §3(m) | Full match + enhanced (panel quantified assessment for "unreasonable burden") |
| Constitutionally Authorized Transit Easement (5/7 + neutral mediator, termination/reversion) | Art XX §3(n) | Full match |

**Part 3: Sovereignty Protection and Compensation (o-q):**

| Proposal Part | Integrated Location | Status |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| Tribal Jurisdiction Preservation (law enforcement, no scope expansion) | Art XX §3(o) | Full match |
| Compensation (FMV + 50-200% sovereignty premium + dual-floor revenue share + employment preferences + direct payment) | Art XX §3(p) | Full match + enhanced (2% replacement cost default for non-revenue infrastructure) |
| Scope Limitation with Art XXIII Deconfliction | Art XX §3(q) | Full match + enhanced (explicit "Notwithstanding Art XXIII §4(a)" clause) |

**Part 4: Anti-Manipulation and Transparency (r-t):**

| Proposal Part | Integrated Location | Status |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| Foreign Influence Prohibition (expanded to NGOs, clear-and-convincing, expedited appeal with tolling) | Art XX §3(r) | Full match + enhanced (interlocutory appeal tolling) |
| Inter-Regional Manipulation (= Non-Blockade violation) | Art XX §3(s) | Full match |
| Transparency (NITS, 12-month aggregation, anti-structuring) | Art XX §3(t) | Full match |

### Key Design Decisions

- **Joint Resolution with ⅗ Senate** (v2): Replaced ⅔ Senate-only NIC designation — reduces bottleneck while maintaining supermajority protection for tribal sovereignty
- **Retired Art III judge from Chief Justice roster** (v2): Replaced generic "senior judge" — ensures independence and judicial caliber without active docket conflicts
- **Multi-tribal consolidated panel** (v2): Single mediation with proportional representation when corridor crosses multiple tribal territories — prevents serial veto stacking
- **Multi-Region corridor representation** (v3): When corridor traverses multiple Regions, all affected Regions may participate — prevents manipulation via non-party Regions
- **"Reasonably constructible within standard engineering practice"** (v2): Unified feasibility standard replacing mixed language — prevents gaming via unreasonable technical specifications
- **Quantified burden assessment** (v2): Panel decides "unreasonable burden" via specific quantified criteria — prevents subjective determinations
- **5/7 supermajority + neutral mediator's affirmative vote** (v2): Structural safeguard ensuring neither side can dominate while preventing tribal veto (the vulnerability Gap 99 solves) — design choice retained across both review rounds
- **Sovereignty premium cap 200%** (v2): Expanded from 150% — provides adequate compensation for sovereignty encumbrance
- **Dual-floor revenue share** (v2): 2% gross OR 10% net, whichever greater — convergent finding from both reviewers; non-revenue default at 2% replacement cost (v3)
- **Explicit "Notwithstanding Art XXIII §4(a)"** (v2): Direct constitutional deconfliction rather than implicit exception — reviewed by both rounds, confirmed necessary
- **60-day expedited interlocutory appeal with tolling** (v3): Addresses gap where appeal proceedings could run indefinitely during easement construction
- **12-month aggregation + anti-structuring** (v2): Prevents evasion of NITS transparency thresholds via transaction splitting

### Files Modified

- `02-design/constitution/06-supremacy.md` — Art XX §3 expanded: 14 new subsections (g)-(t) inserted after existing (f); section group header "National Interest Corridor Dispute Resolution" added
- `02-design/drafts/gap-099-tribal-infrastructure-entrapment.md` — Draft file created (v1 → v2 → v3 FINAL)
- `04-meta/gaps/10-interstate-commerce.md` — Gap 99 status: PROPOSAL AVAILABLE to RESOLVED with integration mapping table
- `04-meta/gaps/00-index.md` — Gap 99: Proposal Available to Resolved
- `04-meta/02-identified-gaps.md` — Statistics updated (PA 20 to 19, Resolved 156 to 157)
- `02-design/constitution/article-crosswalk.md` — Art XX entry expanded with §3(g)-(t) subsection descriptions; citation guidance added

## 2026-02-03: Gap 104 — Predatory Infrastructure Licensing (Labor Chokepoints) Resolved (Article I Section 9)

One interstate commerce gap resolved through new constitutional text in Article I-RF, Section 9, subsections (bb)-(dd). Drafted via multi-LLM protocol: v1 → Round 1 review (2 reviewers, 11 findings: 0 convergent, 5 complementary, 0 contradictions, 6 single-reviewer) → v2 → Round 2 review (2 reviewers, 5 findings: all surgical fixes) → v3 (FINAL) → integration.

### Problem

**Gap 104 (Predatory Infrastructure Licensing — Labor Chokepoints):** Article I, Section 9 provides comprehensive credential portability through the Mutual Recognition framework — rebuttable presumption of competency (§9(g)), Essential for Public Safety standard (§9(h)), ARB pre-approval (§9(j)-(l)), anti-protectionism with strict scrutiny (§9(m)-(n)), anti-retaliation (§9(t)), and federal backstop (§9(u)). However, a Region could comply with all general credential requirements while manipulating workforce composition on federally-funded infrastructure projects through cumulative micro-barriers: project-specific "safety orientations," informal contractor preferences for Regional residents, mandatory Regional business registration as a bid evaluation factor, and leveraging the gap between credential recognition (covered) and actual project hiring (not covered).

### Pre-Existing Coverage

3 of 4 gaming vectors from the Gap 104 proposal were already closed by existing §9(a)-(aa):

| Gaming Vector | Status | Existing Coverage |
|---------------|--------|-------------------|
| Regional Safety Certification | Closed | §9(g)-(l): presumption + EPS + ARB |
| Expedited Local Track | Closed | §9(c), (m), (n): fees, strict scrutiny, prohibited practices |
| Continuous Renewal | Substantially closed | §9(n)(1), (q), (s): CE prohibition, 30-day processing, 90-day supervised cap |
| Federal Funds Capture | **Open** | §9(u) reactive only; no proactive federal project workforce rules |

### Solution

3 new subsections added to Article I-RF, Section 9:

| Subsection | Content | Key Provisions |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| §9(bb) | Infrastructure Labor Reciprocity | Art II §4(m) critical infrastructure definition; infrastructure-specific credential recognition; National Infrastructure Worker Credential (DOT/DOL/DOE/FCC, optional); operational safety measures with OSHA exception and ARB certification for >4hr; 3-year minimum validity with anti-circumvention |
| §9(cc) | Federal Project Labor Mobility | Federal project access with (cc)(2) exception cross-reference; 4-hour orientation cap with OSHA exception and off-site carve-out; 5% local preference cap with tribal carve-out (Art XX §3); zero residency evaluation weight with tax registration clarification; "Notwithstanding Art X §4" anti-coercion override; $10M monitoring threshold |
| §9(dd) | Infrastructure Funds Enforcement | "Notwithstanding Art X §4"; fund suspension/proportional repayment/direct federal admin with tribal preservation; treble damages (greater of $5K or 3x lost wages); DOJ authority with substantiated-complaint presumption |

### Key Design Decisions

- **Narrow scope** (v1): 3 new subsections covering residual gap only (5 of 9 proposal elements retained; 4 already covered by existing text)
- **Art II §4(m) critical infrastructure definition** (v2): 6 categories + NIST expandable — broader than Art I §6 corridors
- **5% local preference cap** (v2): Reduced from 20% — 5% allows legitimate local training without enabling protectionism
- **Zero residency weight in contractor evaluation** (v2): Outright prohibition on residency/credential-holding as scored factors
- **Explicit "Notwithstanding Art X §4"** (v2): Anti-coercion override in both §9(cc)(5) and §9(dd)(1)
- **OSHA-certified hazard exception** (v2): 4-hour cap with exception for specialized hazards
- **Tribal hiring carve-out** (v2): 5% cap does not apply to Art XX §3 preferences on tribal land
- **Treble damages floor** (v2): Greater of $5,000 or 3x lost wages
- **ARB certification for >4hr safety measures** (v3): Closes bypass where Regions could self-certify
- **OSHA off-site training carve-out** (v3): Accredited OSHA facilities exempt from non-project-site ban
- **Business registration: prerequisite vs. scored factor** (v3): Tax compliance registration is ministerial prerequisite, not scored factor
- **Tribal preservation in direct federal admin** (v3): Art XX §3 preferences survive transition to federal project administration
- **(cc)(1)/(cc)(2) cross-reference** (v3): Resolves internal conflict with explicit exception clause

### Files Modified

- `02-design/constitution/01-regional-structure.md` — Art I §9 expanded: 3 new subsections (bb)-(dd) inserted after existing (aa); section group header "Infrastructure Labor Protection" added

## 2026-02-03: Gap 109 — Resource Hoarding via Regional Environmental Protection Resolved (Article I Section 11)

One interstate commerce gap resolved through new constitutional text in Article I-RF, Section 11 (Environmental Border Protection), subsections (k)-(m). Drafted via multi-LLM protocol: v1 → Round 1 review (2 reviewers, 10 findings: 1 convergent, 1 complementary, 1 rejected, 6 single-reviewer accepted) → v2 → Round 2 review (1 reviewer, 5 findings: all surgical fixes) → v3 (FINAL) → integration.

### Problem

**Gap 109 (Resource Hoarding via Regional Environmental Protection):** Article I, Section 11(c) permits Regions to "establish more protective [environmental] standards provided they do not discriminate against interstate commerce," but provides no mechanism to detect or remedy pretextual environmental standards designed to hoard shared natural resources rather than protect the environment. A Region could set extreme "Water Purity" standards for shared waterways, impose endless environmental assessments on resource transfers, lock resources behind pretextual habitat designations, or use cumulative impact claims to block any resource access — all framed as "exceeding a federal floor" while functioning as de facto resource embargo. Note: Original proposal targeted Art I §10, but §10 is Data Sovereignty; corrected to Art I §11.

### Pre-Existing Coverage

All 4 gaming vectors had residual risk (unlike Gap 104 where 3/4 were already closed):

| Gaming Vector | Status | Existing Coverage |
|---------------|--------|-------------------|
| Purity Standard Embargo | Partially closed | §7(a)-(b) water only; §11(c) anti-discrimination but no pretext mechanism |
| Environmental Assessment Delay | Open | No existing provisions |
| Habitat Protection Lock | Partially closed | §11(f) ecosystem designation for pollution, not pretext prevention |
| Cumulative Impact Doctrine | Open (reverse concern) | §11(e)-(j) prevents cumulative harm; Gap 109 prevents using cumulative claims to block access |

### Solution

3 new subsections added to Article I-RF, Section 11, completing a three-layer framework: direct harm (a)-(d), cumulative harm (e)-(j), pretextual regulation (k)-(m):

| Subsection | Content | Key Provisions |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| §11(k) | Resource-Restrictive Environmental Standard Certification | "Substantially limiting" + "material reduction in interstate availability" definition; multi-body certification (WRCB/DOE+EPA/ARB); 4-part proportionality test; 90-day deemed-denial with mandamus remedy; pretext finding with compensation + pattern presumption (2 in 5 years); 12-month assessment cap with interim conditions fallback; Emergency Environmental Exception (60-day safe harbor, 7-day submission, 30-day extensions) |
| §11(l) | Shared National Resource Designation | Water cross-ref to §7(a); energy resources; DOI minerals with ARB concurrence; ARB expansion with cross-Regional significance criteria and 60-day notice; National Resource Doctrine (trust) with Exclusive Regional Domain deconfliction; Environmental Authority Preservation; §7 cross-reference |
| §11(m) | Emergency Resource Access | Emergency override with FMV compensation; quantified transferring Region priority (baseline for survival, sanitation, critical infrastructure per federal standards); emergency collision deconfliction (environmental emergency survives resource emergency unless greater irreversible harm); coordination body allocation with 21-day judicial review; anti-hoarding with treble damages; water emergency deferral to §7/WRCB |

### Key Design Decisions

- **Section correction** (v1): Proposal targeted §10 (Data Sovereignty); corrected to §11 (Environmental Border Protection)
- **Cross-reference to §7, not duplication** (v1): Water framework leveraged, not recreated
- **Multi-body certification with EPA consultation** (v1+v2): WRCB for water, DOE+EPA for energy, ARB for others
- **Deemed-denial + mandamus** (v1+v2): Prevents certification-by-silence; mandamus compels action from captured agencies
- **"Resource-restrictive" narrowed** (v2, convergent finding): "Substantially limiting" + "material reduction in interstate availability"
- **Emergency Environmental Exception** (v2): 60-day safe harbor with 7-day submission; closes "Suicide Pact" scenario
- **Deconfliction with Exclusive Regional Domains** (v2): National Resource Doctrine preserves environmental regulation as Regional authority
- **ARB concurrence for minerals** (v2) + **designation criteria** (v3): Prevents unilateral/unbounded nationalization
- **Quantified transferring Region priority** (v2): Federal baseline standards, not fixed percentages
- **Emergency collision deconfliction** (v3): Environmental emergency survives resource emergency; comparative irreversible harm assessment
- **Interim conditions fallback** (v3): 30-day deadline or most recently applicable conditions
- **21-day expedited judicial review** (v3): Prevents emergency allocations stuck in litigation

## 2026-02-03: Gap 56 — Zombie Executive Incentive (Caretaker Obstruction) Resolved (Article VII Section 8)

One institutional governance gap resolved through modified §8(c)(4) + 5 new subsections §8(d)-(h) in Article VII (Elections and Democratic Legitimacy), Section 8 (Caretaker Governance). Drafted via multi-LLM protocol: v1 → Round 1 review (2 reviewers, 10 findings: 0 convergent, 1 complementary, 0 contradictions, 8 single-reviewer accepted) → v2 → Round 2 review (1 reviewer, 5 findings: all surgical fixes) → v3 (FINAL) → integration.

### Problem

**Gap 56 (Zombie Executive Incentive — Caretaker Obstruction Dynamics):** Article VII, Section 8 provides Caretaker Governance during certification deadlocks with disqualified caretaker rules (§8(a)), selection hierarchy (§8(b)), and declining authority (§8(c)). However, the existing text had five residual vulnerabilities: (1) no external confirmation of caretaker selection, (2) no bipartisan committee fallback after Day 91 termination, (3) no anti-obstruction framework for deliberate certification delay, (4) no caretaker-specific accelerated timeline, (5) no NEC audit default or Failure of Choice mechanism.

### Pre-Existing Coverage

Parts 1-2 of the Gap 56 proposal were already integrated in §8(a)-(c). The delta covered external confirmation, committee fallback, anti-obstruction, accelerated timeline, and NEC audit default.

### Solution

Modified §8(c)(4) + 5 new subsections added to Article VII, Section 8:

| Subsection | Content | Key Provisions |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| §8(c)(4) modified | Automatic Termination (Day 91) | Caretaker authority terminates → governance transfers to Temporary Executive Committee; Failure of Choice → special election; no Failure of Choice → NEC default certification within 7 days |
| §8(d) | External Confirmation of Caretaker | Adjacent Governor majority vote within 72 hours; silence = affirmation; longest-tenure + oldest-by-age tie-breaker (v3); hierarchy exhaustion → Governor direct selection → circuit judge backstop with "Notwithstanding §8(a)(4) and (a)(6)" override (v3); anti-conditioning |
| §8(e) | Temporary Executive Committee | Bipartisan composition (presiding officers + minority leaders); unicameral/nonpartisan/bicameral-nonpartisan fallbacks (v3 specifies both chambers' presiding officers); supermajority when legislature affiliated with candidate; limited authority; anti-abuse with 1,000 FPU contract cap + emergency/election exception |
| §8(f) | Anti-Obstruction Mechanisms | 7-category obstruction definition with Brandenburg narrowing; NEC finding with heightened scrutiny cross-case trigger (v3 corrected from "strict scrutiny"); candidate disqualification (4-year/permanent); federal obstruction terminates executive/administrative involvement with judicial/election-security carve-outs; frivolous challenge deterrence |
| §8(g) | Accelerated Resolution Timeline | "Notwithstanding §7(k)"; caretaker-specific Day 0-66 timeline (certification → challenge → NEC hearing → NEC ruling → SC appeal → SC ruling); automatic transfer on missed deadlines; SC terminal step to NEC audit (v2) |
| §8(h) | Default Resolution and Special Election | NEC audit determination within 7 days of Day 66; default certification if count reliable; Failure of Choice if unreliable/margin smaller than unresolvable ballots; 30-day special election; terminal fallback: legislature 2/3 vote → committee with mandatory special election within 1 year (v3) |

### Key Design Decisions

- **Circuit judge carve-out expanded** (v3): "Notwithstanding subsections (a)(4) and (a)(6)" — covers both federal appointee and incumbent-appointed judicial officer disqualifications
- **Nonpartisan bicameral specified** (v3): Both chambers' presiding officers + cross-chamber diversity for longest-serving members
- **Oldest-by-age secondary tie-breaker** (v3): Fully deterministic chain for equal-tenure Governors
- **"Heightened scrutiny" corrected** (v3): "Strict scrutiny of standing" replaced with doctrinally precise formulation
- **Mandatory special election at 1-year** (v3): Prevents indefinite committee governance regardless of general election timing

### Files Modified

- `02-design/single-topic/election-reform.md` — Art VII §8 expanded: modified (c)(4) + new subsections (d)-(h)
- `02-design/drafts/gap-056-zombie-executive-caretaker.md` — Draft file created (v1 → v2 → v3 FINAL)
- `04-meta/gaps/11-institutional-governance.md` — Gap 56 status: PROPOSAL AVAILABLE to RESOLVED with gaming vector coverage table
- `04-meta/gaps/00-index.md` — Gap 56: Proposal Available to Resolved

## 2026-02-03: Gap 79 — Executive Caretaker Perpetualism Resolved (Article VII Section 8)

One institutional governance gap resolved through modified §8(c)(4)(v), new §8(f)(6), and 3 new subsections §8(i)-(k) in Article VII (Elections and Democratic Legitimacy), Section 8 (Caretaker Governance). Drafted via multi-LLM protocol: v1 → Round 1 review (2 reviewers, 8 findings: 0 convergent, 1 complementary, 0 contradictions, 7 single-reviewer accepted) → v2 → Round 2 review (2 reviewers, 4 findings: all surgical fixes) → v3 (FINAL) → integration.

### Problem

**Gap 79 (Executive Caretaker Perpetualism):** Article VII, Section 8 provides Caretaker Governance during certification deadlocks. After Gap 56 resolved caretaker obstruction dynamics, five residual vulnerabilities remained: (1) no explicit prohibition on extending the Day 91 termination date, (2) no mechanism to combat serial litigation designed to delay certification, (3) no emergency limitations specific to caretaker governance, (4) no transition protection for the Apparent Winner, (5) no criminal accountability for refusal to vacate.

### Pre-Existing Coverage

10 of 15 Gap 79 proposal components were already covered by existing Art VII §8(a)-(h) (including Gap 56 integration). The delta covered: non-extension clause, serial litigation consolidation, caretaker emergency limitations, transition protection, and accountability for caretaker abuse.

### Solution

Modified §8(c)(4)(v) + new §8(f)(6) + 3 new subsections added to Article VII, Section 8:

| Subsection | Content | Key Provisions |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| §8(c)(4)(v) modified | Non-Extension Clause | Termination date may not be extended, stayed, or modified by any authority including emergency, judicial order, or executive action |
| §8(f)(6) new | Serial Litigation Finding | NEC consolidation with jurisdictional transfer (excluding SC cases, v3); pre-approval requirement; public record; linked to obstruction; re-litigation as prima facie indicator |
| §8(i) | Caretaker and Committee Emergency Limitations | Legislative concurrence with court certification coordination clause (v3); 48-hour immediate response exception with anti-re-declaration (v3); prohibited election-related uses; 14-day duration with 2 renewals; investigation limitation with successor termination authority |
| §8(j) | Transition Protection | Apparent Winner designation by canvass or NEC (sole arbiter on conflicting canvasses); classified briefing equivalence; transition facilities and funding; anti-impairment; 24-hour access revocation on change of AW |
| §8(k) | Accountability for Caretaker Abuse | Refusal to vacate as high crime with immediate removal; void ab initio orders; subordinate priority hierarchy (certified winner > Committee > AW > successor entity, v3) with safe harbor; non-stayable self-executing termination |

### Key Design Decisions

- **Subordinate priority includes Committee** (v3): Certified winner > Committee (during active governance) > Apparent Winner (after Committee terminates) > successor entity; AW directs transition only during Committee governance
- **Emergency coordination clause** (v3): Legislative concurrence is additional to court certification; 48-hour grace applies only to concurrence requirement
- **Supreme Court carve-out** (v3): Serial litigation transfer excludes matters already before SC
- **Serial re-declaration as renewal** (v3): Same-event re-declarations count toward renewal cap

### Files Modified

- `02-design/single-topic/election-reform.md` — Art VII §8 expanded: modified (c)(4)(v) + new (f)(6) + new subsections (i)-(k)
- `02-design/drafts/gap-079-caretaker-perpetualism.md` — Draft file created (v1 → v2 → v3 FINAL)
- `04-meta/gaps/11-institutional-governance.md` — Gap 79 status: PROPOSAL AVAILABLE to RESOLVED with gaming vector coverage table

## 2026-02-03: Gap 118 — Caretaker Cabinet (Constitutional Shadow-Government) Resolved (Article VII Section 8)

One institutional governance gap resolved through modified §8(c)(1) + new subsection §8(l) in Article VII (Elections and Democratic Legitimacy), Section 8 (Caretaker Governance). Drafted via multi-LLM protocol: v1 → Round 1 review (2 reviewers, 7 findings: 1 convergent, 1 complementary, 0 contradictions, 5 single-reviewer accepted) → v2 → Round 2 review (2 reviewers, 3 findings: all single-reviewer surgical fixes) → v3 (FINAL) → integration. Completes the caretaker cluster (Gaps 56, 79, 118).

### Problem

**Gap 118 (Caretaker Cabinet — Constitutional Shadow-Government):** Article VII, Section 8 provides Caretaker Governance during certification deadlocks. After Gap 56 resolved caretaker obstruction and Gap 79 resolved caretaker perpetualism, one critical vulnerability remained: §8(c)(1) grants "full executive authority" during Days 1-30 with no appointment restrictions. A Caretaker could pack institutions with loyalists before the Day 31 freeze at §8(c)(2)(i), and no removal restrictions existed at any phase. The existing text had no delegation prohibition, no acting official protocol, no during-period void provision, and no inducement prohibition.

### Pre-Existing Coverage

7 of 10 proposal components had some existing coverage (3 partial, 1 mostly, 1 fully covered, 2 broad but time-limited). True delta: 6 components needed new constitutional text (Day 1 appointment freeze, removal power suspension, delegation prohibition, acting official protocol, during-period void provision, inducement prohibition).

### Solution

Modified §8(c)(1) + new §8(l) with 6 paragraphs added to Article VII, Section 8:

| Subsection | Content | Key Provisions |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| §8(c)(1) modified | Initial Period restriction | "except that the appointment and removal restrictions of subsection (l) apply from the commencement of Caretaker Governance" |
| §8(l)(1) | General Rule | System-wide appointment freeze including ARB/IFC/NEC regardless of authority source; removal freeze with pre-existing cause + during-period misconduct exceptions (court-certified); delegation prohibition; shadow staff prohibition with AW/acting/emergency carve-outs (v3 D1) |
| §8(l)(2) | Vacancy Management | Statutory succession with seniority fallback; temporal authority scope ("binding effect beyond" period); termination on certified winner taking office |
| §8(l)(3) | Emergency Vacancy | Supreme Court authorization with narrowed scope (life, property, public order, disputed election); party affiliation restriction; NEC review; adjudicatory body carve-out with narrowed disqualification to (a)(1)/(a)(3)/(a)(5) (v3 D2); oversight body quorum preservation from former members (v3 D3) |
| §8(l)(4) | Void Acts | Void ab initio; default rescission (silence = void; written ratification required within 30 days); sovereign obligation back pay without further appropriation; obstruction linkage to §8(f)(1) |
| §8(l)(5) | Pending Nominations | Suspension during caretaker/committee governance; confirmation body freeze; certified winner's withdrawal/resubmission authority |
| §8(l)(6) | Inducement Prohibition | Inducement ban; position restructuring/reclassification ban; obstruction linkage to §8(f)(1) |

### Key Design Decisions

- **System-wide freeze** (v2 S1): Applies "regardless of whether authority vested in Caretaker, department head, board, commission, or any other official" — closes proxy appointment loophole
- **Shadow staff prohibition with carve-outs** (v2 S2 + v3 D1): Functional ban on delegating authority/records access to non-officeholders; explicit carve-outs for AW transition access (§8(j)), acting officials (§8(l)(2)), and emergency appointees (§8(l)(3))
- **During-period misconduct exception** (v2 S3): Court-certified emergency removal for misconduct discovered during caretaker governance — balances freeze against genuine safety concerns
- **Narrowed emergency scope** (v2 C2): "Immediate protection of life, property, public order, or the conduct of the disputed election" — prevents misuse for political policy roles
- **Adjudicatory body carve-out with narrowed disqualification** (v2 C2 + v3 D2): §8(a) designed for Caretaker eligibility, not judicial designees; (a)(4) federal appointee and (a)(6) recent judicial appointee criteria dropped — only (a)(1) candidate, (a)(3) party affiliation, (a)(5) financial/familial retained
- **Oversight body quorum preservation** (v3 D3): Presiding officer designates temporary member from former members with court approval — addresses ARB/IFC quorum loss
- **Default rescission rule** (v2 C1): Silence = void; affirmative written ratification required within 30 days
- **Sovereign obligation** (v2 S4): Back pay payable from treasury without further legislative appropriation — prevents hostile legislature from weaponizing appropriations
