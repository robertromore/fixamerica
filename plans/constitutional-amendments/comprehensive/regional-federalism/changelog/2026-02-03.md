## 2026-02-03: Triage Fix — Reclassify 30 Gaps from Requires Development to Proposal Available

Systematic audit of all 30 gaps listed as "Requires Development" in the index priority tables (`04-meta/gaps/00-index.md`) revealed that all 30 have detailed proposals ("PROPOSAL AVAILABLE") in their respective thematic files. The index had never been updated to reflect the proposal work.

### Root Cause

Proposals were written into the thematic gap files (Categories 07-18) but the index priority tables and summary statistics were not updated in parallel. The discrepancy accumulated across multiple drafting sessions.

### Changes

- `04-meta/gaps/00-index.md` — All 30 `Requires Development` entries changed to `Proposal Available`; version bumped to 1.6
- `04-meta/02-identified-gaps.md` — Statistics updated: RD 23 to 0, PA 4 to 27

### Impact

- Requires Development: 23 to 0
- Proposal Available: 4 to 27
- Total gap count unchanged (235)

## 2026-02-03: Gaps 67 + 75 — Infrastructure Ransom + Fee-Gouging Confirmed Resolved (Article I Section 6)

Detailed comparison of Gap 67 and 75 proposals against existing constitutional text in Article I, Section 6 revealed that **both gaps were already fully integrated** into the constitutional text. The proposals match the existing subsections (d)-(z) exactly (with enhancements), as documented in the integration map at `04-meta/05-article-i-section-6-integration.md` (dated 2026-01-25).

### Problem

**Gap 67 (Infrastructure Ransom):** Article I, Section 6 prohibits "unreasonable conditioning" of infrastructure access but did not define "unreasonable" for maintenance shutdowns, enabling Regions to strangle neighbors' economies through prolonged closures, rolling maintenance blockades, inspection slowdowns, and rate manipulation.

**Gap 75 (Fee-Gouging Loophole):** "Reasonable and non-discriminatory" fee standard was subjective, enabling gatekeeper Regions to extract rents through maintenance premiums, climate surcharges, variable rates, and ancillary fee multiplication.

### Finding

All proposal elements are present in the existing constitutional text:

**Gap 67 mapping (5 parts):**

| Proposal | Integrated Location | Status |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| Part 1: Emergency Shutdown Review (72-hr trigger, safety necessity standard, 7-day presumption) | Art I Section 6(d)-(f) | Full match + enhanced (automatic referral for failure to file) |
| Part 2: Anti-Cumulative Obstruction (cumulative assessment, rolling maintenance limits, processing standards) | Art I Section 6(g)-(i) | Full match + enhanced (alternative route requirements at Section 6(h)) |
| Part 3: Rate Regulation (rate reasonableness, cost-based rates, dispute freeze) | Art I Section 6(j)-(l) | Full match + enhanced (void provision for restriction-period increases) |
| Part 4: Remedies and Escalation (damages, federal operation, repeat offender) | Art I Section 6(m)-(p) | Full match + enhanced (treble damages for bad faith, personal liability) |
| Part 5: NITS (transparency system) | Art I Section 6(q)-(t) | Full match + enhanced (fee data consolidated from Gap 75) |

**Gap 75 mapping (3 parts):**

| Proposal | Integrated Location | Status |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| Part 1: Cost-Plus Maximum (110% ceiling, prohibited inclusions, ancillary aggregation) | Art I Section 6(u)-(v) | Full match (prohibited inclusions merged into aggregate limitation) |
| Part 2: ARB Summary Authority (fee review, expedited timeline, burden of proof) | Art I Section 6(w) | Full match (consolidated into single 5-clause subsection) |
| Part 3: Anti-Retaliation and Transparency (non-retaliation, challenger protection, whistleblower) | Art I Section 6(x)-(z) | Full match (fee transparency integrated into NITS at Section 6(q)-(t)) |

### Design Enhancements Found in Constitutional Text

The integrated text includes improvements beyond the original proposals:

- **Treble damages** for bad-faith restrictions with personal liability for officials (Section 6(n))
- **Alternative route requirements** during closures at Region's expense (Section 6(h))
- **Unified NITS** consolidating closure and fee transparency (Section 6(q)(5)-(6), (t)(2)(6))
- **Aggregate fee limitation** explicitly closing multiplication via multiple fee categories (Section 6(v))
- **Summary suspension** with detailed 5-part burden-shifting framework (Section 6(w))

### Additional Finding: Art I Section 6(aa)-(hh) Maintenance Standards

The constitutional text also contains subsections (aa)-(hh) covering minimum maintenance standards, critical corridor designation, manufactured safety necessity doctrine, federal maintenance backstop, and private right of action for manufactured decay. These provisions substantially correspond to Gap 83 (Infrastructure Decay) proposals. Gap 83 resolution status should be investigated separately (note: index Gap 83 description "Pipeline and hazardous material transport" does not match thematic file Gap 83 "Infrastructure Decay as Regional Coercion" — numbering discrepancy to resolve).

## 2026-02-03: Gaps 128 + 132 + 142 — Proxy Blockade + Foreign Divestment + Stigma Barrier Resolved (Article I Section 6)

Three interstate commerce gaps resolved through new constitutional text in Article I-RF, Section 6, subsections (ii)-(rr). Drafted via multi-LLM protocol: v1 → Round 1 review (2 reviewers, 11 convergent findings) → v2 → Round 2 review (2 reviewers, 5 surgical fixes) → v3 (FINAL) → integration. Former subsection (hh) renumbered to (ss).

### Problem

**Gap 128 (Mercenary Proxy Blockade):** Article I, Section 6 prohibits direct Regional infrastructure blockades but does not address privatized coercion. Regions could subsidize private security contractors, community associations, or licensed businesses to conduct "voluntary safety inspections" of interstate freight, achieving de facto blockade while claiming no direct command over private actors.

**Gap 132 (Sovereignty Dilution via Foreign Divestment):** Regions could sell critical inter-Regional infrastructure to foreign entities, rendering constitutional enforcement provisions unenforceable. Foreign owners operating under bilateral investment treaties or sovereign immunity could bypass ARB orders, NITS reporting, and federal operational assumption.

**Gap 142 (Secondary Boycott Stigma Barrier):** Regions could weaponize mandatory labeling to stigmatize other Regions' goods — requiring labels like "Produced under exploitative labor conditions" or "From a Region that restricts reproductive rights" — achieving de facto trade barriers through information warfare while claiming consumer protection.

### Solution

10 new subsections added to Article I-RF, Section 6:

**Gap 128 mapping (3 subsections):**

| Proposal Part | Integrated Location | Status |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| Part 1: Regional Attribution Rule (strict liability for private actor blockades; narrowed nexus to material support, contracts, delegated functions, special privileges) | Art I §6(ii) | Full match + enhanced (cumulative delay aggregation; ARB methodology delegation) |
| Part 2: Proxy Entity Designation (ARB designation with constructive coordination; scoped attribution per designation order) | Art I §6(jj) | Full match + enhanced (split foreign proxy remedies: corridor-controlling → §6(oo) emergency operation; non-corridor → expedited §6(kk) injunction with doubled penalties) |
| Part 3: Federal Injunction Authority (DOJ enforcement; penalty scaled to greater of $10M or 3x damages) | Art I §6(kk) | Full match + enhanced (cross-references to §6(n) treble damages and §6(p) repeat offender) |

**Gap 132 mapping (4 subsections):**

| Proposal Part | Integrated Location | Status |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| Part 1: Divestment Approval (Senate approval with tiered threshold: 25% general / 10% SOE) | Art I §6(ll) | Full match + enhanced (retroactive review mandate with due process: notice, 90-day response, oral testimony; deemed-denied default) |
| Part 2: Treaty Subordination (domestic constitutional supremacy; takings reconciliation) | Art I §6(mm) | Full match + enhanced (explicit domestic due process preserved) |
| Part 3: Ownership Transparency (beneficial ownership disclosure; successor liability) | Art I §6(nn) | Full match + enhanced (NITS publication) |
| Part 4: Emergency Federal Operation (federal operation of foreign-owned infrastructure during compliance deadlock) | Art I §6(oo) | Full match (cross-reference to §6(o) standards) |

**Gap 142 mapping (3 subsections):**

| Proposal Part | Integrated Location | Status |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| Part 1: Political Labeling Prohibition (political/social/moral/ideological characterization labels prohibited; per se violation) | Art I §6(pp) | Full match + enhanced (characterization definition; NITS reporting) |
| Part 2: Permissible Consumer Disclosures (objective federally-verified product metrics only) | Art I §6(qq) | Full match + enhanced (two-track ARB review: 14-day emergency injunction + 60-day final determination; named verifying agencies: FDA, CPSC, EPA) |
| Part 3: Stigma Barrier Enforcement (penalty scaled to greater of $10M or 3x economic harm; rulemaking authority suspension) | Art I §6(rr) | Full match + enhanced (federally-verified product metrics requirement) |

### Key Design Decisions

- **Attribution nexus narrowed** (v2): Material support, contracts, delegated functions, special privileges — excludes ordinary licensed businesses
- **Constructive coordination** (v2): Entities without formal ties captured via coordination-with-Region standard
- **Foreign proxy split** (v3): Corridor-controlling proxies get emergency federal operation (§6(oo)); non-corridor proxies get expedited injunction with doubled penalties
- **Retroactive review due process** (v3): Formal notice, 90-day response period, oral testimony opportunity
- **Two-track ARB review** (v3): 14-day emergency injunction + 60-day final determination
- **Named verifying agencies** (v3): FDA, CPSC, EPA specified rather than generic "federal" reference

### Files Modified

## 2026-02-03: Gaps 92 + 116 — Technical Standards Interoperability Resolved (Article II Section 4)

Two interstate commerce gaps resolved through new constitutional text in Article II-RF, Section 4, subsections (l)-(s). Drafted via multi-LLM protocol: v1 → Round 1 review (2 reviewers, 10 findings: 2 convergent, 7 complementary, 0 contradictions) → v2 → Round 2 review (1 reviewer, 5 findings) → v3 (FINAL) → integration. Gap 116 consolidated into Gap 92 as supplement.

### Problem

**Gap 92 (Technical Standards as de facto Secession):** Article I, Section 6 guarantees the Right of Transit and Article II, Section 4 establishes the Concurrent Authority Framework with "Floors, Not Ceilings." However, a Region could adopt proprietary technical standards for its power grid (unique voltage/frequency/connector), rail signaling (incompatible gauge), or digital credentials (proprietary identity systems) that are "technically superior" but physically impossible for neighboring Regions to interface with — achieving functional secession through engineering rather than law.

**Gap 116 (Administrative Veto via Technical Standard-Setting):** Supplement to Gap 92. Without a federal standard-setting authority with backward compatibility requirements and pre-implementation review, Regions could fragment the National Common Market through uncoordinated technical standards.

### Solution

8 new subsections added to Article II-RF, Section 4:

| Proposal Part | Integrated Location | Status |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| Infrastructure Interoperability Mandate | Art II §4(l) | Permanent prohibition on material barriers |
| Critical Infrastructure Definition (6 categories + NIST expandable) | Art II §4(m) | Power, rail, highways, digital identity, telecom, pipeline |
| Material Barrier Standard (5 tests, tiered thresholds) | Art II §4(n) | 2hr physical, 5sec digital, NIST-calibrated energy, 30min telecom |
| Federal Interoperability Floors (NIST) | Art II §4(o) | 5-year review cycle, interim standards with precedence rule |
| Regional Innovation + Pre-Implementation Certification | Art II §4(p)-(q) | Backward compatibility, deemed approval with provisional status |
| Enforcement and Remediation | Art II §4(r) | 180-day remediation, federal implementation, repeat offender with split tie-breaker |
| Anti-Circumvention + Innovation Protection | Art II §4(s)(1)-(4) | Cybersecurity patch exemption, vendor lock-in prohibition, permanence |
| Data Sovereignty Deconfliction | Art II §4(s)(5) | Privacy-preserving protocols, 90-day joint resolution clock, Constitutional Court referral |

### Key Design Decisions

- **NIST as technical arbiter** (v2): "Acting through NIST" specified rather than generic "Commerce" — domain expertise over political maneuvering
- **Deemed approval with provisional status** (v2+v3): Silence = certification prevents administrative veto (Gap 116's core vulnerability); provisional status with "DEEMED — NOT REVIEWED" designation and interim injunction authority prevents bad-standard lock-in
- **Tiered delay thresholds** (v2): 2hr physical freight, 5sec digital credentials, NIST-calibrated energy with 100ms/5sec interim floor, 30min telecom — applies distinct physical laws to distinct infrastructure types
- **Cybersecurity patch exemption** (v2): Security updates that don't alter interoperability characteristics excluded from annual change limit
- **Repeat offender default + tie-breaker** (v3): 120-day clock deemed approval with ARB monitoring conditions; ARB prevails on barrier questions, NIST on technical feasibility
- **Open-standards safety exception** (v3): NIST-certified proprietary adoption when no open equivalent exists, with mandatory open-standard development obligation
- **Data sovereignty 90-day clock** (v3): Privacy-preserving interim mode pending judicial review; Constitutional Court referral for unresolved disputes

### Files Modified

- `02-design/constitution/02-powers-and-rights.md` — Art II §4 expanded: 8 new subsections (l)-(s) inserted after existing (k); section group header "Critical Infrastructure Interoperability" added
- `02-design/drafts/gap-092-116-infrastructure-interoperability.md` — Draft file created (v1 → v2 → v3 FINAL)

## 2026-02-03: Gap 99 — Tribal Veto via Infrastructure Entrapment Resolved (Article XX Section 3)

One interstate commerce gap resolved through new constitutional text in Article XX-RF, Section 3, subsections (g)-(t). Drafted via multi-LLM protocol: v1 → Round 1 review (2 reviewers, 11 findings: 1 convergent, 7 complementary, 1 partial contradiction) → v2 → Round 2 review (2 reviewers, 5 findings: 4 surgical fixes, 1 design choice retained) → v3 (FINAL) → integration.

### Problem

**Gap 99 (Tribal Veto via Infrastructure Entrapment):** Article XX, Section 3 protects tribal sovereignty and Article XXIII establishes "free, prior, and informed consent" for any federal action diminishing tribal sovereignty. Hostile actors could exploit these protections by encouraging Tribal Nations to withhold consent for National Interest Corridors traversing tribal land, achieving proxy blockade through sovereignty rather than direct action — while the Tribal Nation bears the political cost and the manipulating Region enjoys the economic benefit.

### Solution

14 new subsections added to Article XX-RF, Section 3, organized in 4 parts:

**Part 1: NIC Definition and Sovereign Mediation Panel (g-k):**

| Proposal Part | Integrated Location | Status |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| NIC Definition (Joint Resolution + unified feasibility standard) | Art XX §3(g) | Full match + enhanced (⅗ Senate vote, NIST cross-reference to §3(m)(2) feasibility) |
| Sovereign Mediation Panel (retired Art III judge, multi-tribal, multi-Region) | Art XX §3(h) | Full match + enhanced (Chief Justice roster, §3(h)(5) consolidated multi-tribal panel, §3(h)(6) multi-Region representation) |
| Mediation Timeline (180 days + tolling) | Art XX §3(i) | Full match + enhanced (60-day expedited interlocutory appeal with tolling at §3(i)(5)) |
| Scope Limitation | Art XX §3(j) | Full match |
| Good Faith (300% base-FMV-only threshold, bad-faith asymmetry) | Art XX §3(k) | Full match |

**Part 2: Resolution Mechanisms (l-n):**

| Proposal Part | Integrated Location | Status |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| Negotiated Resolution Preference | Art XX §3(l) | Full match |
| Re-routing Obligation ("reasonably constructible," quantified burden assessment) | Art XX §3(m) | Full match + enhanced (panel quantified assessment for "unreasonable burden") |
| Constitutionally Authorized Transit Easement (5/7 + neutral mediator, termination/reversion) | Art XX §3(n) | Full match |

**Part 3: Sovereignty Protection and Compensation (o-q):**

| Proposal Part | Integrated Location | Status |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| Tribal Jurisdiction Preservation (law enforcement, no scope expansion) | Art XX §3(o) | Full match |
| Compensation (FMV + 50-200% sovereignty premium + dual-floor revenue share + employment preferences + direct payment) | Art XX §3(p) | Full match + enhanced (2% replacement cost default for non-revenue infrastructure) |
| Scope Limitation with Art XXIII Deconfliction | Art XX §3(q) | Full match + enhanced (explicit "Notwithstanding Art XXIII §4(a)" clause) |

**Part 4: Anti-Manipulation and Transparency (r-t):**

| Proposal Part | Integrated Location | Status |
|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| Foreign Influence Prohibition (expanded to NGOs, clear-and-convincing, expedited appeal with tolling) | Art XX §3(r) | Full match + enhanced (interlocutory appeal tolling) |
| Inter-Regional Manipulation (= Non-Blockade violation) | Art XX §3(s) | Full match |
| Transparency (NITS, 12-month aggregation, anti-structuring) | Art XX §3(t) | Full match |

### Key Design Decisions

- **Joint Resolution with ⅗ Senate** (v2): Replaced ⅔ Senate-only NIC designation — reduces bottleneck while maintaining supermajority protection for tribal sovereignty
- **Retired Art III judge from Chief Justice roster** (v2): Replaced generic "senior judge" — ensures independence and judicial caliber without active docket conflicts
- **Multi-tribal consolidated panel** (v2): Single mediation with proportional representation when corridor crosses multiple tribal territories — prevents serial veto stacking
- **Multi-Region corridor representation** (v3): When corridor traverses multiple Regions, all affected Regions may participate — prevents manipulation via non-party Regions
- **"Reasonably constructible within standard engineering practice"** (v2): Unified feasibility standard replacing mixed language — prevents gaming via unreasonable technical specifications
- **Quantified burden assessment** (v2): Panel decides "unreasonable burden" via specific quantified criteria — prevents subjective determinations
- **5/7 supermajority + neutral mediator's affirmative vote** (v2): Structural safeguard ensuring neither side can dominate while preventing tribal veto (the vulnerability Gap 99 solves) — design choice retained across both review rounds
- **Sovereignty premium cap 200%** (v2): Expanded from 150% — provides adequate compensation for sovereignty encumbrance
- **Dual-floor revenue share** (v2): 2% gross OR 10% net, whichever greater — convergent finding from both reviewers; non-revenue default at 2% replacement cost (v3)
- **Explicit "Notwithstanding Art XXIII §4(a)"** (v2): Direct constitutional deconfliction rather than implicit exception — reviewed by both rounds, confirmed necessary
- **60-day expedited interlocutory appeal with tolling** (v3): Addresses gap where appeal proceedings could run indefinitely during easement construction
- **12-month aggregation + anti-structuring** (v2): Prevents evasion of NITS transparency thresholds via transaction splitting

### Files Modified

- `02-design/constitution/06-supremacy.md` — Art XX §3 expanded: 14 new subsections (g)-(t) inserted after existing (f); section group header "National Interest Corridor Dispute Resolution" added
- `02-design/drafts/gap-099-tribal-infrastructure-entrapment.md` — Draft file created (v1 → v2 → v3 FINAL)
- `04-meta/gaps/10-interstate-commerce.md` — Gap 99 status: PROPOSAL AVAILABLE to RESOLVED with integration mapping table
- `04-meta/gaps/00-index.md` — Gap 99: Proposal Available to Resolved
- `04-meta/02-identified-gaps.md` — Statistics updated (PA 20 to 19, Resolved 156 to 157)
- `02-design/constitution/article-crosswalk.md` — Art XX entry expanded with §3(g)-(t) subsection descriptions; citation guidance added

## 2026-02-03: Gap 104 — Predatory Infrastructure Licensing (Labor Chokepoints) Resolved (Article I Section 9)

One interstate commerce gap resolved through new constitutional text in Article I-RF, Section 9, subsections (bb)-(dd). Drafted via multi-LLM protocol: v1 → Round 1 review (2 reviewers, 11 findings: 0 convergent, 5 complementary, 0 contradictions, 6 single-reviewer) → v2 → Round 2 review (2 reviewers, 5 findings: all surgical fixes) → v3 (FINAL) → integration.

### Problem

**Gap 104 (Predatory Infrastructure Licensing — Labor Chokepoints):** Article I, Section 9 provides comprehensive credential portability through the Mutual Recognition framework — rebuttable presumption of competency (§9(g)), Essential for Public Safety standard (§9(h)), ARB pre-approval (§9(j)-(l)), anti-protectionism with strict scrutiny (§9(m)-(n)), anti-retaliation (§9(t)), and federal backstop (§9(u)). However, a Region could comply with all general credential requirements while manipulating workforce composition on federally-funded infrastructure projects through cumulative micro-barriers: project-specific "safety orientations," informal contractor preferences for Regional residents, mandatory Regional business registration as a bid evaluation factor, and leveraging the gap between credential recognition (covered) and actual project hiring (not covered).

### Pre-Existing Coverage

3 of 4 gaming vectors from the Gap 104 proposal were already closed by existing §9(a)-(aa):

| Gaming Vector | Status | Existing Coverage |
|---------------|--------|-------------------|
| Regional Safety Certification | Closed | §9(g)-(l): presumption + EPS + ARB |
| Expedited Local Track | Closed | §9(c), (m), (n): fees, strict scrutiny, prohibited practices |
| Continuous Renewal | Substantially closed | §9(n)(1), (q), (s): CE prohibition, 30-day processing, 90-day supervised cap |
| Federal Funds Capture | **Open** | §9(u) reactive only; no proactive federal project workforce rules |

### Solution

3 new subsections added to Article I-RF, Section 9:

| Subsection | Content | Key Provisions |
|------------|---------|----------------|
| §9(bb) | Infrastructure Labor Reciprocity | Art II §4(m) critical infrastructure definition; infrastructure-specific credential recognition; National Infrastructure Worker Credential (DOT/DOL/DOE/FCC, optional); operational safety measures with OSHA exception and ARB certification for >4hr; 3-year minimum validity with anti-circumvention |
| §9(cc) | Federal Project Labor Mobility | Federal project access with (cc)(2) exception cross-reference; 4-hour orientation cap with OSHA exception and off-site carve-out; 5% local preference cap with tribal carve-out (Art XX §3); zero residency evaluation weight with tax registration clarification; "Notwithstanding Art X §4" anti-coercion override; $10M monitoring threshold |
| §9(dd) | Infrastructure Funds Enforcement | "Notwithstanding Art X §4"; fund suspension/proportional repayment/direct federal admin with tribal preservation; treble damages (greater of $5K or 3x lost wages); DOJ authority with substantiated-complaint presumption |

### Key Design Decisions

- **Narrow scope** (v1): 3 new subsections covering residual gap only (5 of 9 proposal elements retained; 4 already covered by existing text)
- **Art II §4(m) critical infrastructure definition** (v2): 6 categories + NIST expandable — broader than Art I §6 corridors
- **5% local preference cap** (v2): Reduced from 20% — 5% allows legitimate local training without enabling protectionism
- **Zero residency weight in contractor evaluation** (v2): Outright prohibition on residency/credential-holding as scored factors
- **Explicit "Notwithstanding Art X §4"** (v2): Anti-coercion override in both §9(cc)(5) and §9(dd)(1)
- **OSHA-certified hazard exception** (v2): 4-hour cap with exception for specialized hazards
- **Tribal hiring carve-out** (v2): 5% cap does not apply to Art XX §3 preferences on tribal land
- **Treble damages floor** (v2): Greater of $5,000 or 3x lost wages
- **ARB certification for >4hr safety measures** (v3): Closes bypass where Regions could self-certify
- **OSHA off-site training carve-out** (v3): Accredited OSHA facilities exempt from non-project-site ban
- **Business registration: prerequisite vs. scored factor** (v3): Tax compliance registration is ministerial prerequisite, not scored factor
- **Tribal preservation in direct federal admin** (v3): Art XX §3 preferences survive transition to federal project administration
- **(cc)(1)/(cc)(2) cross-reference** (v3): Resolves internal conflict with explicit exception clause
