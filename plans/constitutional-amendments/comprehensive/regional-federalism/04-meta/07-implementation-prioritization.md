## Classification Methodology

### Implementation Tiers

| Tier | Definition | Criteria |
|------|------------|----------|
| **CONSTITUTIONAL** | Must be entrenched in constitutional text | Creates fundamental structural constraint; Cannot be waived by legislation; Defines inter-Regional relations; Establishes rights against government |
| **CONSTITUTIONAL + STATUTORY** | Framework in constitution, details in statute | Core principle requires entrenchment; Implementation details need flexibility; May need periodic adjustment |
| **STATUTORY** | Implementing legislation sufficient | Operationalizes constitutional provisions; Can be amended by normal legislative process; Technical/procedural in nature |
| **ADMINISTRATIVE** | Agency regulation adequate | Procedural details; Reporting requirements; Operational standards |

### Urgency Levels

| Level | Timeline | Criteria |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **CRITICAL** | At adoption | Prevents immediate gaming; Closes day-one vulnerabilities; Required for system launch |
| **HIGH** | Within 2 years | Prevents predictable abuse; Establishes key enforcement; Blocks known attack vectors |
| **MEDIUM** | Within 5 years | Addresses emerging risks; Refines initial framework; Responds to experience |
| **LOW** | Ongoing development | Optimization; Edge cases; Long-term improvements |

1. **Entrench all Tier 1 gaps** in constitutional text
2. **Establish constitutional frameworks** for Tier 2 gaps
3. **Mandate implementing legislation** deadlines for Tier 3 gaps

### Year 1

4. **Pass core implementing statutes** for Tier 2 gaps
5. **Establish regulatory frameworks** for Tier 4 gaps
6. **Activate enforcement mechanisms** (IFC, ARB, NEC)

### Years 2-5

7. **Refine statutory frameworks** based on experience
8. **Develop administrative procedures** for edge cases
9. **Amendment process** for any constitutional gaps identified
