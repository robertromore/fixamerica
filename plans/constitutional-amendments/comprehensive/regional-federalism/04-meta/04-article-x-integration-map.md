## Resolution of Identified Collisions

### Collision 1: Section 6 (Gaps 45 vs. 137)
**Resolution:** Consolidated into unified Section 6 with solvency provisions (137) preceding receivership provisions (45). Solvency certification is preventive; receivership is remedial.

### Collision 2: Section 7 (Gaps 61 vs. 138)
**Resolution:** Section 7 divided into Part A (Stabilization, Gap 61) and Part B (Tax Coordination, Gap 138). Subsections (a-g) for stabilization; (h-j) for tax coordination.

### Collision 3: Subsection Lettering
**Resolution:** Gap 52's "Section 3-B through 3-E" converted to standard subsections 3(b-e). All gaps now use consistent (a), (b), (c) lettering within their assigned sections.
