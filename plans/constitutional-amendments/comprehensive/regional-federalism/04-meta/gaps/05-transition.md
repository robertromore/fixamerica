# Category V: Implementation and Transition Risks

> These gaps describe risks specific to the constitutional transition period—the vulnerable phase between adoption and stable operation when institutions are newly formed, capacities are uneven, and legitimacy has not yet been established through practice.

## Gap 12 — Constitutional Transition Vulnerability

**Description:**
The transition from the current constitution to this system:

- creates temporary ambiguity,
- invites elite maneuvering,
- heightens legitimacy contestation.

**Risk:**
Destabilization during adoption phase.

**Status:**
RESOLVED. Article I, Section 4-A(b-1) and (b-2) (Accelerated Initial Review and Transition-Period State Transfer Facilitation) and Article XXI, Section 8 (Transition-Period Boundary Adaptability) establish: accelerated initial boundary review within 7 years (conditioned on Commission maturity, with census-data safeguard), reduced State Transfer waiting period (2 years) with coordinated-transfer consolidation, boundary-adaptive statutory design mandate for implementation acts (permanent), IFC boundary-adaptability review, fiscal succession protocol, anti-lock-in for inter-Regional agreements, Boundary Sensitivity Assessment with anti-stigma protections, capacity investment safe harbor, capacity tier adjustment for boundary changes, and anti-entrenchment directive in Schedule A(d-1). See [briefing-gap-012.md](briefing-gap-012.md).

## Gap 13 — Uneven Regional Capacity at Inception

**Description:**
Regions may begin with:

- unequal administrative maturity,
- uneven public trust,
- inconsistent institutional quality.

**Risk:**
Early performance disparities undermine legitimacy.

**Status:**
RESOLVED. Article XXI, Section 7 (Regional Institutional Capacity Development) establishes a three-tier capacity framework (Foundational, Operational, Full Capacity), graduated authority transfer with 7-year hard bridge limit, Federal Capacity Development Program with anti-conditionality protections, judicial borrowing provisions, inter-Regional technical assistance with brain-drain safeguards, early warning and remediation ladder with mandatory Year 6 intervention, anti-stigma protections, and 15-year absolute sunset.
