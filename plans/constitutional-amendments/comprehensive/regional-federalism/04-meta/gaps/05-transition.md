# Category V: Implementation and Transition Risks

> These gaps describe risks specific to the constitutional transition period—the vulnerable phase between adoption and stable operation when institutions are newly formed, capacities are uneven, and legitimacy has not yet been established through practice.

## Gap 12 — Constitutional Transition Vulnerability

**Description:**
The transition from the current constitution to this system:

- creates temporary ambiguity,
- invites elite maneuvering,
- heightens legitimacy contestation.

**Risk:**
Destabilization during adoption phase.

**Status:**
Outside scope of stable-state design; requires separate transition protocol.

## Gap 13 — Uneven Regional Capacity at Inception

**Description:**
Regions may begin with:

- unequal administrative maturity,
- uneven public trust,
- inconsistent institutional quality.

**Risk:**
Early performance disparities undermine legitimacy.

**Status:**
Mitigated over time; cannot be equalized instantly.
