# Category III: Under-Specified Domains

## Introduction

This document catalogs constitutional gaps where the Regional Federal Framework intentionally stops short of detailed specification. Unlike structural vulnerabilities or missing safeguards, these under-specified domains represent deliberate design choices where constitutional silence serves important purposes:

- **Avoiding overreach** into areas where federal prescription would be inappropriate or counterproductive
- **Allowing experimentation** so Regions can develop diverse approaches suited to their populations
- **Preserving flexibility** for future adaptation as circumstances evolve
- **Respecting contested domains** where premature constitutional settlement might undermine legitimacy

For each gap, this document provides the description, associated risks, current status (including any available proposals or resolutions), and residual concerns. Some gaps have been fully resolved through constitutional provisions and implementing proposals; others remain intentionally under-specified with guidance available; still others represent accepted tradeoffs inherent in the system's design.

## Gaps 5-8: Core Under-Specified Domains

### Gap 5 — Media and Information Power

**Description:**
The system does not deeply constitutionalize:

- media ownership limits,
- platform governance,
- disinformation countermeasures.

**Risk:**
Narrative domination without formal institutional capture.

**Status:**
Accepted by Design. Partially addressed by [Article XVI, Section 7](../../02-design/constitution/00-index.md) (foreign source disclosure requirements).
Intentional under-specification for domestic speech to avoid overreach — constitutional regulation of media ownership, platform governance, or domestic disinformation deemed riskier than the gap itself.
Foreign information operations subject to transparency requirements but not content control.

See [Foreign Information Warfare Stress Test](../../03-analysis/06-foreign-information-warfare.md) for detailed analysis.

---

### Gap 6 — Political Party Evolution

**Description:**
The system shapes party incentives but does not control:

- party structure,
- factional discipline,
- leadership dynamics.

**Risk:**
Entrenched regional machines or cartelization.

**Status:**
Left to political evolution; constitutional regulation deemed riskier.

---

### Gap 7 — Implementation Act Dependency and Statutory Capture

**Description:**
The constitutional system depends on three major implementation acts:

- Allocation Framework Act (defining jurisdictional boundaries and spillover criteria)
- Fiscal Equalization Act (establishing transfer formulas and the Independent Fiscal Council)
- Elections Implementation Act (specifying procedures for federal elections)

[Article XXI](../../02-design/constitution/00-index.md) provides default rules if Congress fails to enact these acts, but defaults are designed as emergency backstops, not optimal governance.

**Risk:**

- Prolonged operation under defaults degrades system performance and legitimacy.
- Implementation acts, once enacted, may be captured or weaponized by future majorities.
- Many design assumptions depend on statutory detail not yet defined.

**Status:**
RESOLVED. [Article XXI, Section 2-A](../../02-design/constitution/07-implementation.md) (Implementation Act Integrity) extends anti-obstruction and poison pill protections to all three implementation acts (previously Fiscal Equalization Act only), establishes 15-year supermajority protection against repeal or material weakening (with phase-in and one renewal), constitutionalizes institutional independence floors (appointment diversity, removal for cause, budgetary floor, operational autonomy), bars appropriations conditioning on unrelated policy, requires independent institutional designation for each act's core functions, and creates a default operation escalation mechanism (Implementation Failure Finding after 10 years, binding IFC/ARB interim regulations with 2-year sunset). Mixed-bill gaming, technical-correction abuse, lame-duck poison pills, successor-legislation capture, and cumulative piecemeal erosion all addressed with specific anti-gaming provisions. ARB determines material weakening with de novo Supreme Court review.

---

### Gap 8 — Rights-Floor Content and Enforcement Detail

**Description:**
The constitution establishes rights floors as a structural principle ([Article III](../../02-design/constitution/00-index.md)) but does not enumerate specific floor content. Analysis documents assume:

- baseline bodily autonomy protections,
- core gun rights,
- labor rights floors,
- anti-discrimination guarantees.

Actual floor definitions require implementation legislation and judicial interpretation.

**Risk:**

- Rights floors may be defined narrowly or unevenly across administrations.
- Judicial interpretation may diverge from design intent.
- Political conflict over floor content may replicate current nationalized battles.

**Status:**
**RESOLVED.** The Dual-Legitimacy Rights-Floor Statute (DLRS) mechanism has been incorporated into the Regional Federal Constitution as **Article III, Section 10** (subsections (a)-(jj)), with a surgical amendment to **Article II, Section 3-A(a)(iii)** recognizing DLRS-established rights as enumerated. Key features:

- Dual consent (national popular referendum + two-thirds of Regions) for establishing or raising floors
- Five enumerated domains (voting, due process, anti-discrimination, labor, public integrity); expansion requires constitutional amendment
- Two-tier ratchet: raise by standard dual consent; lower only by elevated dual consent (60% referendum + 3/4 Regions); ordinary legislation cannot touch floors
- Sunset limitations: substantive floors cannot sunset; sunsets permitted only for funding, administrative bodies, and pilot programs
- Effective compliance standard: functional implementation, not merely formal legal conformity
- Mandatory appropriation for DLRS administration and enforcement, cross-referenced to Art XXI §2-A
- ARB determines substantial similarity for cooling-off period with de novo judicial review
- Tribal provisions harmonized with Art XXIII §11 (partial consent, same consent/revocation process)

See the [DLRS Proposal](../../proposals/01-foundations/dual-legitimacy-rights-floor-statute.md) for implementing guidance, model floor examples, and hostile reinterpretation stress testing. See [briefing-gap-008.md](../../04-meta/gaps/briefing-gap-008.md) for the full resolution analysis.

**Residual risk:** DLRS process may still generate political conflict, and the five enumerated domains do not cover all areas where floor content is contested (e.g., bodily autonomy, gun rights). Expansion of domains requires constitutional amendment.

---

## Gaps 16-32: Inter-Regional and Specialized Domains

### Gap 16 — Inter-Regional Cooperation Mechanisms

**Description:**
[Article I, Section 5](../../02-design/constitution/00-index.md) provides a framework for voluntary inter-regional cooperation, but the constitution does not specify:

- governance structures for multi-regional institutions,
- dispute resolution between cooperating Regions,
- fiscal arrangements for shared programs,
- accountability mechanisms for joint bodies.

**Risk:**

- Ad hoc arrangements may lack democratic accountability.
- Asymmetric bargaining power between Regions in negotiations.
- Unclear legal status of inter-regional agreements.
- Potential for wealthy Regions to dominate cooperative arrangements.

**Status:**
Accepted by Design. The constitution provides extensive inter-Regional cooperation infrastructure across 13+ provisions: Art I §5 (core cooperation framework with governance, cost-sharing, dispute resolution, withdrawal), Art I §6 (transit rights and non-blockade), Art I §7 (Water Resources Coordination Board), Art I §8 (freedom of movement), Art I §9 (mutual recognition and credential portability), Art I §§10-11 (environmental coordination and shared resources), Art I §12 (law enforcement cooperation), Schedule A(f) (small Region cooperation requirements), Art X §3 (fiscal equalization enabling cooperation), Art XXI §7(k)-(m) (inter-Regional technical assistance with brain-drain safeguards), and Art XX §3(d) (tribal-Regional mandatory compacts).

The remaining implementation details (governance structures for multi-regional institutions, fiscal arrangements for shared programs, accountability mechanisms for joint bodies) are appropriately delegated to legislation and inter-Regional practice. This is proper federalism — the constitution provides the framework and constraints while leaving operational details to the political process. Voluntary cooperation supplements rather than replaces the primary constitutional architecture.

---

### Gap 17 — Inter-Regional Infrastructure Coercion (RESOLVED)

**Description:**
Could a Region use control over infrastructure (roads, rail, energy transmission) to blockade or coerce another Region, particularly one whose only viable connection to other Regions passes through the blocking Region?

**Risk (prior to resolution):**

- Economic coercion through infrastructure denial
- Landlocked-style vulnerability for certain Regions
- Escalation of inter-regional disputes into crises

**Resolution:**
[Article I, Section 6](../../02-design/constitution/01-regional-structure.md) (Right of Transit and Non-Blockade) addresses this constitutionally. Implementation details are in the [National Common Market Access Act](../../proposals/03-economy-commerce/national-common-market-access-act.md), which provides:

- Explicit prohibition on infrastructure blockades and coercion
- Non-discriminatory, cost-based fee standards
- Expedited mediation (14 days) and judicial resolution
- Federal enforcement including operational control authority
- Equalization transfer sanctions for willful violations

**Status:**
Fully resolved by constitutional provision with implementing proposal.

---

### Gap 18 — Water Rights and Shared Waterways (RESOLVED)

**Description:**
Could a Region use control over water resources (rivers, aquifers, dams) to harm downstream or adjacent Regions through diversion, pollution, or over-appropriation?

**Risk (prior to resolution):**

- Economic coercion through water denial
- Agricultural and municipal water crises in downstream Regions
- Environmental damage crossing Regional boundaries
- Escalation of water disputes into broader inter-Regional conflict

**Resolution:**
[Article I, Section 7](../../02-design/constitution/01-regional-structure.md) (Water Rights and Shared Waterways) addresses this constitutionally. Implementation details are in the [Interstate Water Resources Coordination Act](../../proposals/05-environment-infrastructure/water-resources-coordination-act.md), which provides:

- Establishment of interstate waters as shared resources
- Prohibition on unilateral diversion, damming, or pollution
- Equitable apportionment criteria and procedures
- Water Resources Coordination Board for monitoring and mediation
- National Water Court for adjudication
- Federal enforcement including cessation orders and sanctions
- Preservation of existing compacts and tribal water rights

**Status:**
Fully resolved by constitutional provision with implementing proposal.

---

### Gap 19 — Freedom of Movement Between Regions (RESOLVED)

**Description:**
Could a Region impose barriers to entry, exit, or transit for residents of other Regions, creating internal borders within the United States?

**Risk (prior to resolution):**

- Internal travel restrictions or documentation requirements
- Discriminatory waiting periods for public services
- Employment or housing discrimination based on Region of origin
- Effective creation of second-class citizenship for newcomers

**Resolution:**
[Article I, Section 8](../../02-design/constitution/00-index.md) (Freedom of Movement) addresses this by:

- Guaranteeing rights to travel, reside, work, and access services in any Region
- Prohibiting border controls, checkpoints, and discriminatory waiting periods
- Limiting permissible durational residency requirements (30 days voting, 90 days services, 12 months tuition)
- Providing expedited judicial relief (7 days) for movement restrictions

**Status:**
Fully resolved by constitutional provision. This gap was identified during stress-testing and immediately addressed.

---

### Gap 20 — Mutual Recognition of Legal Status (RESOLVED)

**Description:**
Could a Region refuse to recognize marriages, professional licenses, business registrations, or other legal statuses from other Regions?

**Risk (prior to resolution):**

- Marriages or adoptions invalid upon crossing Regional lines
- Professionals unable to practice in new Regions
- Businesses unable to operate across Regional boundaries
- Legal uncertainty for mobile citizens

**Resolution:**
[Article I, Section 9](../../02-design/constitution/01-regional-structure.md) (Mutual Recognition) addresses this constitutionally. Implementation details for professional credentials are in the [Interstate Professional Licensing Reciprocity Act](../../proposals/04-social-policy-labor/interstate-professional-licensing-act.md), which provides:

- Full faith and credit among Regions
- Recognition of marriages, adoptions, business registrations, and other legal statuses
- Professional credential recognition with minimal registration requirements ($100 cap, 14-day processing)
- Anti-circumvention provisions preventing protectionist barriers
- Expedited dispute resolution (14 days) with attorney's fees for prevailing challengers

**Status:**
Fully resolved by constitutional provision with implementing proposal.

---

### Gap 21 — Environmental Border Dumping (RESOLVED)

**Description:**
Could a Region site polluting facilities near its borders to export environmental harms (air pollution, water contamination, hazardous waste) to neighboring Regions?

**Risk (prior to resolution):**

- Strategic placement of pollution sources at Regional boundaries
- Transboundary air and water pollution without accountability
- Competitive pressure on environmental standards for border areas
- Public health crises in downwind/downstream Regions

**Resolution:**
[Article I, Section 10](../../02-design/constitution/01-regional-structure.md) (Environmental Border Protection) addresses this constitutionally. Implementation details are in the [Transboundary Environmental Harm Prevention Act](../../proposals/05-environment-infrastructure/transboundary-environmental-protection-act.md), which provides:

- Prohibition on pollution siting near boundaries (50-mile buffer, adjustable)
- Prohibition on emissions or discharges causing measurable transboundary harm
- EPA monitoring authority at jurisdictional boundaries
- Injunctive relief, compensatory damages, and remediation orders
- Federal enforcement including cessation orders, sanctions, and cost recovery

**Status:**
Fully resolved by constitutional provision with implementing proposal.

---

### Gap 22 — Cross-Regional Law Enforcement Cooperation (RESOLVED)

**Description:**
Could a Region refuse to extradite fugitives, cooperate in investigations, or allow hot pursuit, creating safe havens for criminals?

**Risk (prior to resolution):**

- Fugitives escaping justice by crossing Regional lines
- Investigation stalemates due to non-cooperation
- Confusion during cross-boundary pursuit of fleeing suspects
- Regions strategically refusing extradition for political reasons

**Resolution:**
[Article I, Section 11](../../02-design/constitution/01-regional-structure.md) (Cross-Jurisdictional Law Enforcement Cooperation) addresses this constitutionally. Implementation details are in the [Interstate Law Enforcement Cooperation Act](../../proposals/06-security-justice/interstate-law-enforcement-cooperation-act.md), which provides:

- Mandatory extradition for serious crimes (violence, harm to minors, fraud, corruption)
- Limited exceptions only for rights-floor violations or persecution risk
- 60-day extradition deadline with federal takeover on failure
- Hot pursuit authorization across boundaries
- Mutual legal assistance (subpoenas, evidence sharing, witness testimony)
- Safe harbor prohibition for violent crimes and fraud
- Protection against pretextual or politically motivated requests

**Status:**
Fully resolved by constitutional provision with implementing proposal.

---

### Gap 23 — Regional Guard Force Accountability

**Description:**
Article XI (Armed Forces amendment) establishes divided military command between federal forces and Regional Guards, but does not specify:

- civilian oversight structures for Regional Guard forces,
- accountability mechanisms for Guard misconduct,
- prohibitions on Regional Guard use against civilian political activity,
- standards for Guard commander appointment and removal.

**Risk:**

- Regional executives could capture their Guards and use them for political intimidation.
- Guards could become instruments of regional authoritarianism.
- Lack of uniform training or accountability standards creates variation in professionalism.
- Guards used against peaceful protests or political opposition.

**Status:** **RESOLVED** — Already Integrated. The standalone Military Civilian Control Amendment (Art XI §§4-5, 7) provides all constitutional-level protections: prohibited uses (§4(a)(1)-(8)), duty to refuse (§5), transparency/IG (§7), cause of action with no qualified immunity (§7(d)). Art XI-RF §§1-3 add Governor command, force classification, and registry/inspections. Compatibility Clause applies all provisions to Regional Guard Forces. Remaining details (training, regional IG, use-of-force policies) are appropriately statutory.

See [Regional Guard Force Accountability Proposal](../../proposals/06-security-justice/regional-guard-accountability.md) for implementing legislation.

---

### Gap 24 — Public Health Emergency Coordination

**Description:**
COVID-19 revealed critical gaps in multi-jurisdictional disease response. The constitution addresses emergency powers ([Article XVII](../../02-design/constitution/00-index.md)) but does not specify:

- coordination mechanisms for multi-regional disease outbreaks,
- medical supply chain coordination during emergencies,
- health data sharing protocols across regional boundaries,
- uniform quarantine or movement restriction authorities.

**Risk:**

- Patchwork regional responses to pandemics undermine effectiveness.
- Multi-key authorization requirements may be too slow for rapidly spreading diseases.
- Medical supply competition between Regions during shortages.
- Inconsistent public health messaging creates confusion.

**Status:**
RESOLVED. All four elements covered by Art XVII §11 (Bio-Security Emergency Escalation: federal override, mandatory 24-hour data sharing, enforcement cascade, 90-day auto-expiration) + Art XVII-RF §4 (Regional Bio-Security Cooperation: Governor duty, data infrastructure, Guard constraints, federal supersession) + Art XVII §3(b) (enumerated public health emergency powers including quarantine and supply allocation) + Art I §8(d) (quarantine exception to right of travel). See primary entry in [09-emergency-military.md](09-emergency-military.md).

---

### Gap 25 — Climate Emergency Coordination

**Description:**
While [Article I, Section 10](../../02-design/constitution/00-index.md) addresses environmental border dumping and [Article I, Section 7](../../02-design/constitution/00-index.md) addresses water rights, the constitution does not specify:

- coordinated climate emergency response mechanisms,
- carbon policy coordination across regions,
- climate migration within the union,
- shared climate adaptation infrastructure governance.

**Risk:**

- Inconsistent regional climate policies undermine national emissions targets.
- Climate refugees moving between Regions strain receiving areas.
- Regions may defect from cooperative climate commitments.
- Adaptation infrastructure (sea walls, fire management) crossing boundaries lacks governance.

**Status:**
Under-specified but **PROPOSAL AVAILABLE**. Environmental provisions provide foundation; coordination could be built through inter-regional cooperation mechanisms ([Article I, Section 5](../../02-design/constitution/00-index.md)) and federal enabling legislation. Long-horizon risk that intensifies over time.

See [Climate Emergency Coordination Framework](../../proposals/05-environment-infrastructure/climate-emergency-coordination.md) for voluntary carbon coordination, climate migration management, and adaptation infrastructure governance.

---

### Gap 26 — Digital/AI Governance Framework

**Description:**
[Article XVI](../../02-design/constitution/00-index.md) addresses cyber defense but does not address:

- AI governance frameworks for government decision-making,
- algorithmic accountability in public services,
- digital identity and credential systems,
- emerging technology regulation coordination across Regions.

**Risk:**

- Regions develop incompatible digital identity systems.
- AI used in government decisions without adequate oversight.
- Algorithmic bias in criminal justice, benefits, or other systems varies by Region.
- No framework for regulating powerful AI systems that cross regional boundaries.

**Status:**
Under-specified but **PROPOSAL AVAILABLE**. This is an emerging domain where constitutional silence may be appropriate to allow experimentation, but basic rights protections against algorithmic harm could be established as floors.

See [Digital and AI Governance Framework](../../proposals/06-security-justice/digital-ai-governance.md) for algorithmic accountability provisions, digital identity coordination, and emerging technology governance.

---

### Gap 27 — Tribal-Regional Relations

**Description:**
The constitution preserves federal trust responsibilities to tribal nations, but does not specify:

- how tribes interact with Regional governments,
- governance when tribal territories span multiple Regions,
- tribal representation in regional decision-making,
- Regional government obligations to tribes within their boundaries.

**Risk:**

- Tribes caught between federal and regional authorities with unclear jurisdiction.
- Regional governments hostile to tribal interests with limited recourse.
- Split tribal territories creating administrative complexity.
- Erosion of tribal sovereignty through regional action.

**Status:**
Under-specified but **PROPOSAL AVAILABLE**. Federal-tribal relations are preserved but Regional-tribal relations are undefined.

See [Tribal-Regional Relations Framework](../../proposals/08-special-jurisdictions/tribal-regional-relations.md) for constitutional provisions, consultation requirements, and coordination mechanisms preserving tribal sovereignty.

---

### Gap 28 — Nuclear Facilities and Hazardous Materials Governance

**Description:**
The constitution does not specify governance for:

- nuclear power plants near regional boundaries,
- interstate transport of hazardous materials,
- radioactive waste storage siting,
- emergency response zones spanning multiple Regions.

**Risk:**

- NIMBY dynamics push nuclear facilities to regional borders.
- Hazardous material transport creates liability ambiguity.
- No Region wants waste storage, creating gridlock.
- Emergency planning zones crossing boundaries lack coordination.

**Status:**
Under-specified but **PROPOSAL AVAILABLE**. Allocation of Powers ([Article II](../../02-design/constitution/00-index.md)) probably places this under federal authority due to interstate nature.

See [Nuclear and Hazardous Materials Governance](../../proposals/05-environment-infrastructure/nuclear-hazardous-materials.md) for jurisdictional clarification, siting coordination, waste management, and emergency planning provisions.

---

### Gap 29 — Reproductive Rights Regional Divergence

**Description:**
Reproductive rights (abortion, contraception, fertility treatment) are among the most contested policy domains. The constitution:

- does not enumerate reproductive rights as a federal floor,
- does not address travel for medical procedures across regions,
- does not address liability for providers serving out-of-region patients,
- does not address medication access across regional boundaries.

**Risk:**

- Immediate, severe divergence in reproductive healthcare access.
- Regions criminalizing travel for procedures legal elsewhere.
- Providers facing liability in restrictive Regions for services in permissive ones.
- Medication shipped across boundaries creating legal conflict.

**Status:**
**ACCEPTED TRADEOFF** with **GUIDANCE AVAILABLE**. This domain is highly contested and constitutional silence allows regional experimentation. If adopted, the proposed DLRS mechanism (see [DLRS Proposal](../../proposals/01-foundations/dual-legitimacy-rights-floor-statute.md)) could establish floors if dual-legitimacy threshold is met, but reproductive rights are not among the five enumerated floor domains. Freedom of movement ([Article I, Section 8](../../02-design/constitution/00-index.md)) provides some protection for travel.

See [Contested Domains Guidance](../../proposals/01-foundations/contested-domains-guidance.md) for explanation of constitutional silence, existing protections, and paths to resolution.

---

### Gap 30 — Firearms Policy Coordination

**Description:**
Firearms regulation is highly contested. The constitution:

- does not specify whether gun rights have regional floor protections,
- does not address concealed carry reciprocity across Regions,
- does not address firearms transport across regional boundaries,
- does not address background check coordination.

**Risk:**

- Significant regional divergence in firearms access.
- Confusion about legal carry when crossing regional boundaries.
- Background check systems not coordinated across Regions.
- Black markets emerging at regional boundaries with different restrictions.

**Status:**
**ACCEPTED TRADEOFF** with **GUIDANCE AVAILABLE**. The constitution establishes rights floors but leaves firearms policy to regional discretion within those floors. If adopted, the proposed DLRS mechanism (see [DLRS Proposal](../../proposals/01-foundations/dual-legitimacy-rights-floor-statute.md)) could theoretically establish labor or safety floors touching firearms in workplaces, but direct gun rights are not among the enumerated floor domains.

See [Contested Domains Guidance](../../proposals/01-foundations/contested-domains-guidance.md) for explanation of constitutional silence, Second Amendment preservation, and coordination mechanisms available.

---

### Gap 31 — Criminal Justice Coordination Beyond Extradition

**Description:**
[Article I, Section 11](../../02-design/constitution/00-index.md) addresses extradition and law enforcement cooperation, but does not specify:

- sentence portability (person sentenced in one Region, serves time in another),
- criminal records portability and access,
- sex offender registry coordination,
- parole and probation supervision across boundaries.

**Risk:**

- Offenders gaming system by relocating between Regions.
- Criminal history invisible to employers or landlords in new Region.
- Sex offenders disappearing by moving across regional lines.
- Parole violations difficult to enforce across boundaries.

**Status:** **RESOLVED** — Already Integrated. The proposal file itself confirms "No constitutional amendment required." Constitutional framework provides: Art I §12(a) cooperation mandate, §12(f) no sanctuary, §12(h) witness compulsion, §12(i) anti-evasion, §12(k) ARB mediation, §12(r)-(w) federal extradition enforcement, Art I §9 Full Faith and Credit, Art I §13 compact authority, Art IV §8-9 conviction prerequisite and extradition shield. Remaining coordination is appropriately statutory.

See [Criminal Justice Coordination Framework](../../proposals/06-security-justice/criminal-justice-coordination.md) for implementing legislation.

---

### Gap 32 — Educational Standards Divergence

**Description:**
Education is a regional competency. The constitution does not address:

- science education standards (evolution, climate science),
- history and civics curricula divergence,
- higher education accreditation coordination,
- student credential portability.

**Risk:**

- Students educated in one Region unprepared for universities in another.
- Science education varying dramatically by Region.
- Civics education producing incompatible understandings of constitutional order.
- Accreditation fragmentation undermining higher education mobility.

**Status:**
**ACCEPTED TRADEOFF** with **GUIDANCE AVAILABLE**. Regional control of education is a core feature of the system. Risk is mitigated by freedom of movement ([Article I, Section 8](../../02-design/constitution/00-index.md)) and mutual recognition ([Article I, Section 9](../../02-design/constitution/00-index.md)). Long-horizon divergence risk accepted as tradeoff for regional autonomy.

See [Contested Domains Guidance](../../proposals/01-foundations/contested-domains-guidance.md) for explanation of constitutional silence, existing protections through mutual recognition, and voluntary coordination mechanisms.
