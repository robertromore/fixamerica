# Briefing: Gap 137 — "Financial Dumping" via Mutual Recognition

## 1. The Problem

**Gap 137** identifies a structural vulnerability at the intersection of mutual recognition (Article I-RF, Section 9) and Regional fiscal architecture (Article X-RF, Section 6). Section 9 requires Regions to recognize business registrations and legal statuses, but does not specify treatment of Regional Development Bank (RDB) assets or specialized financial instruments. A Region facing systemic banking crisis could authorize its RDB to "launder" toxic assets into highly-rated Regional Bonds, then invoke mutual recognition to force pension funds or banks in neighboring Regions to accept these instruments as valid collateral — effectively exporting economic collapse to stable neighbors.

### The Attack Vectors

| Vector | Mechanism | Effect |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Toxic Bond Laundering** | Region's RDB packages non-performing loans into "Regional Infrastructure Bonds" with Regional government guarantee; mutual recognition forces neighbor banks to accept as collateral | Toxic assets laundered through sovereign guarantee; losses exported when underlying assets fail |
| **Pension Fund Trap** | Failing Region issues high-yield Regional bonds; neighboring Region's pension funds required to recognize as valid investment grade | Bonds default; catastrophic pension losses in stable Regions caused by distant Regional fiscal collapse |
| **Collateral Chain** | Toxic instruments used as collateral for interstate commercial transactions; when underlying assets fail, transactions unwind | Cascading failures across Regional banking systems; common market becomes contagion vector |

### Why Existing Protections Are Insufficient

| Protection | What It Covers | What It Misses |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Art X-RF §6(a)-(d) (Debt Ceilings) | Limits on total Regional debt as percentage of revenue | Does not address quality of individual financial instruments or their interstate recognition |
| Art X-RF §6(e)-(h) (Sustainability Monitoring) | IFC monitoring of debt trajectories | Reactive monitoring, not proactive certification; does not condition mutual recognition on fiscal health |
| Art X-RF §6(i)-(k) (No-Bailout / Resolution) | Structured resolution for insolvent Regions | Addresses consequences of failure, not prevention of contagion before failure |
| Art X-RF §6(o)-(r) (Off-Balance-Sheet Controls) | Consolidated reporting, IFC piercing authority | Captures hidden debt but does not prevent recognized instruments from becoming contagion vectors |
| Art X-RF §6(s)-(t) (Market Discipline / Liquidity) | Market pricing of Regional bonds; emergency liquidity | Market discipline operates ex post; emergency liquidity addresses the failing Region, not neighbors harmed by contagion |
| Art X-RF §10 Stage 3 (Solvency Suspension) | Solvency certification suspension, asset quality floors, contagion firewalls — as escalation measures for Regions already in fiscal distress | Reactive — triggered only after fiscal distress is identified; does not establish proactive certification or standing quality floors for all Regions |
| Art I-RF §9(b) (Legal Status Recognition) | Recognition of business registrations, corporate registrations, property titles | Extends to "all other legal determinations" without carve-out for financial instruments; may force recognition of toxic debt instruments |

### The Critical Gap: Reactive vs. Proactive

The existing fiscal architecture addresses financial contagion only *reactively* — Section 10's escalation hierarchy suspends solvency certification and imposes asset quality floors only after the IFC has already identified fiscal distress. Gap 137 exploits the window *before* distress is formally identified: a Region can issue and export toxic instruments through mutual recognition channels while still appearing fiscally healthy. By the time the Section 10 escalation triggers, neighboring Regions' pension funds and banking systems have already absorbed toxic exposure.

## 2. Existing Coverage Analysis

### What Exists

- **Art X-RF §6**: Comprehensive Regional debt discipline — ceilings, monitoring, no-bailout, intergenerational protection, off-balance-sheet controls, market discipline, emergency liquidity
- **Art X-RF §7**: Financial Conservatorship — IFC assumption of control over Regional borrowing during crisis
- **Art X-RF §10**: IFC Fiscal Intervention Hierarchy — five-stage escalation including solvency certification suspension (Stage 3) and contagion firewalls as reactive measures
- **Art I-RF §9(b)**: Mutual recognition of legal status including business registrations
- **Art I-RF §9(e)**: Anti-discrimination in recognition — prohibits refusal based on "economic protectionism"

### What Does Not Exist

- No proactive solvency certification requirement conditioning mutual recognition of financial instruments on demonstrated fiscal health
- No standing asset quality floors for instruments eligible for interstate recognition (floors exist only as escalation measures in Section 10 Stage 3)
- No automatic contagion firewall triggered by objective indicators rather than IFC discretionary escalation
- No explicit carve-out in §9 distinguishing financial instruments from general legal status recognition
- No anti-repackaging provision preventing laundering of toxic assets through creative restructuring
- No stress-testing requirement for cross-Regional financial exposure

## 3. Related Gaps

| Gap | Relationship |
|-----|-------------|
| **94** (Emergency Debt Issuance) | Resolved — Regional debt crisis; Gap 137 addresses cross-Regional financial contagion from such crises |
| **124** (Internal Tax Haven Arbitrage) | Resolved — fiscal gaming; Gap 137 addresses financial instrument gaming (different domain) |
| **129** (Data Poisoning) | Resolved — audit manipulation; Gap 137 addresses financial data integrity through disclosure requirements |
| **133** (Strategic Incompetence) | PA — cost-shifting via negligence; Gap 137 addresses cost-exporting via financial instruments |
| **138** (Double-Taxation Border Blockade) | PA — related fiscal coercion; different mechanism |
| **147** (Financial Contagion as Coercive Leverage) | PA — intentional weaponization of contagion risk; hierarchically escalated version of Gap 137's structural vulnerability |

### Position in IFC Fiscal Intervention Hierarchy

Gap 137's provisions establish the *proactive baseline framework* that Section 10's escalation hierarchy references at Stage 3. The relationship is:

- **Gap 137 (new §6(u)-(w))**: Standing solvency certification, permanent asset quality floors, automatic contagion firewall — applies to *all Regions at all times*
- **Section 10 Stage 3**: *Suspension* of solvency certification, *enhanced* asset quality floors, *escalated* contagion firewalls — applies to Regions *already in fiscal distress*

---

## 4. Proposed Approach: Financial Instrument Recognition and Contagion Prevention

Three new subsections — **Art X-RF §6(u)-(w)** — establishing proactive solvency certification, standing asset quality floors, and automatic contagion firewalls within the existing Regional Debt Discipline framework. Additionally, an explicit carve-out in **Art I-RF §9(ee)** clarifying that financial instruments are governed by §6(u)-(w) rather than general mutual recognition.

### Design Principles

1. **Proactive, not reactive**: Annual certification with mid-cycle triggers prevents contagion before crisis, rather than activating firewalls after damage is done.
2. **Mutual recognition conditioned on fiscal health**: Financial instruments are not entitled to automatic recognition under §9; recognition is contingent on the issuing Region's solvency certification status.
3. **Objective triggers**: Contagion firewalls activate automatically on objective indicators (IFC certification failure, conservatorship entry); published findings required for discretionary determinations.
4. **Anti-evasion**: Explicit prohibition on repackaging toxic assets to evade quality floors, including synthetic instruments, derivatives, and special purpose vehicles; IFC piercing authority extended to financial instrument structures.
5. **Preserves market function**: Asset quality floors set minimums for interstate recognition, not maximums for intra-Regional markets. Regions may issue instruments below quality floors for their own internal markets.
6. **Constitutional categories, delegated thresholds**: Floor categories are constitutionally mandated; IFC sets specific numerical standards within those categories, balancing permanence with adaptability.

## 5. Proposed Constitutional Text

### Art X-RF §6(u)-(w). Financial Instrument Recognition and Contagion Prevention

*Resolves Gap 137 — "Financial Dumping" via Mutual Recognition. These subsections prevent Regions from weaponizing mutual recognition to export financial contagion by establishing proactive solvency certification, standing asset quality floors for interstate financial instrument recognition, and automatic contagion firewalls.*

Add new subsections (u) through (w) to Section 6, under a new heading "Financial Instrument Recognition and Contagion Prevention":

#### Financial Instrument Recognition and Contagion Prevention

(u) **Solvency Certification.**

- (1) The Independent Fiscal Council shall conduct annual Systemic Risk Audits of each Region's financial instruments, including Regional Development Bank assets, Regional bonds, and any financial instrument issued by or guaranteed by a Regional government or its instrumentalities. The audit shall assess solvency, asset quality, and systemic risk exposure. In addition to annual audits, the IFC may initiate an interim audit of any Region when objective indicators of material adverse fiscal change are present, including but not limited to: an increase in the Region's debt-to-GDP ratio exceeding five (5) percentage points in any quarter, a downgrade by two or more nationally recognized rating organizations within a six (6) month period, or notification from the Region's auditors of material restatement of financial position. Interim audits shall follow the same standards and procedures as annual audits.
- (2) Regions passing the annual or interim audit receive Solvency Certification valid for one (1) fiscal year from the date of certification. The IFC shall publish certification results within sixty (60) days of the audit's completion.
- (3) Interstate recognition of Regional financial instruments — including bonds, notes, certificates, and any obligation issued by or guaranteed by a Regional government, Regional Development Bank, or Regional instrumentality — is contingent upon the issuing Region holding current Solvency Certification. This contingency applies notwithstanding the general mutual recognition requirements of Article I-RF, Section 9. Financial instruments issued by a Region without current Solvency Certification are not entitled to mutual recognition and may be refused by any financial institution, pension fund, or governmental entity in any other Region.
- (4) Solvency Certification under this subsection does not constitute a federal guarantee of the certified Region's financial instruments. Certification attests to minimum solvency standards, not creditworthiness, and does not alter the market discipline provisions of subsection (s).
- (5) Upon lapse or revocation of a Region's Solvency Certification: (A) existing instruments issued during a valid certification period retain their interstate recognition status for ninety (90) days following the date of lapse or revocation; after the ninety-day period, recognition of existing instruments is suspended until the Region obtains new certification; (B) new instruments issued after certification lapse are not entitled to interstate recognition; (C) if the IFC determines that a Region issued a materially disproportionate volume of financial instruments during the ninety (90) days preceding certification lapse — as evidenced by issuance volumes exceeding one hundred fifty percent (150%) of the Region's average quarterly issuance over the preceding two (2) years — the IFC may retroactively de-recognize instruments issued during the spike period; (D) a Region whose Solvency Certification has lapsed or been revoked may petition the IFC for expedited re-certification, which the IFC shall complete within thirty (30) days.
- (6) If the IFC fails to complete an annual audit within ninety (90) days of its scheduled commencement, or fails to complete an expedited re-certification within the thirty (30) day period specified in paragraph (5)(D), the Region's existing Solvency Certification is automatically extended pending completion. A Region may petition the Constitutional Court if IFC delay in completing certification appears targeted or discriminatory; the Court may order the IFC to complete the audit within a specified period not to exceed thirty (30) days.

(v) **Asset Quality Floors.**

- (1) The Independent Fiscal Council shall establish and publish Asset Quality Floors — minimum standards for financial instruments eligible for interstate mutual recognition. Asset Quality Floors shall include the following constitutionally mandated categories, with specific numerical thresholds set by the IFC: (A) minimum capital adequacy ratios for Regional Development Banks whose instruments are offered for interstate recognition; (B) maximum non-performing loan ratios for loan portfolios underlying recognized instruments; (C) disclosure requirements for underlying assets, including independent valuation and risk assessment; (D) independent credit rating requirements from at least two nationally recognized rating organizations. The IFC may not eliminate any of these categories. Congress may by two-thirds vote of both chambers add categories but may not remove constitutionally mandated categories.
- (2) Financial instruments that fail to meet Asset Quality Floors are not subject to mutual recognition under Article I-RF, Section 9 and may be refused by any financial institution, pension fund, or governmental entity in any other Region.
- (3) Packaging, restructuring, repackaging, or synthesizing assets to evade Asset Quality Floors is prohibited. This prohibition extends to: synthetic instruments including credit default swaps, collateralized debt obligations, and derivative instruments whose value is derived from Regional financial instruments; instruments routed through special purpose vehicles, shell entities, or private conduit vehicles with Regional government guarantees, backstops, or implicit support; and any other structure whose practical effect is to present non-compliant assets in a form that appears to meet Asset Quality Floors. The IFC may pierce the structure of any financial instrument — including corporate structures of nominally private entities — and evaluate the quality of underlying assets regardless of the instrument's nominal form, guarantee status, or legal characterization. If the IFC determines that an instrument has been structured to evade Asset Quality Floors, the instrument shall be classified as non-compliant and the issuing Region shall be placed on Warning status under subsection (r).
- (4) The IFC shall review and update Asset Quality Floors at least every three (3) years to reflect evolving financial practices and systemic risk conditions. Updated floors may not be set below the initial standards; they may be tightened but not loosened except upon a two-thirds vote of the IFC with published findings that loosening is necessary to accommodate legitimate financial innovation without increasing systemic risk.
- (5) Asset Quality Floors apply only to instruments offered for interstate recognition. Regions retain full authority to issue and regulate financial instruments within their own borders for intra-Regional markets, subject to the general debt discipline provisions of this Section.
- (6) Financial instruments issued by private entities with Regional government guarantees, backstops, credit enhancements, or implicit support — including instruments issued by entities in which a Regional government or its instrumentalities hold a controlling interest or provide a material portion of operating revenue — are subject to the same Asset Quality Floors as direct Regional instruments. The IFC may pierce corporate structures to identify de facto Regional obligations regardless of the issuing entity's nominal private status.

(w) **Contagion Firewall.**

- (1) Upon IFC finding that a Region's financial instruments pose systemic risk to other Regions — as evidenced by: (A) failure of Solvency Certification under subsection (u); (B) a pattern of Asset Quality Floor violations under subsection (v); (C) the Region entering Financial Conservatorship under Section 7; or (D) objective indicators of imminent default, as certified by published IFC finding identifying the specific indicators, their factual basis, and the systemic risk they pose to other Regions — automatic contagion prevention measures activate without further action required. Triggers (A) through (C) activate automatically upon the triggering event; trigger (D) requires a published IFC finding.
- (2) Upon activation: (A) mutual recognition of the affected Region's new financial instruments is suspended; no new bonds, notes, or obligations issued by or guaranteed by the Region or its instrumentalities are entitled to interstate recognition until the IFC certifies that the systemic risk condition has been resolved; (B) financial institutions holding existing instruments from the affected Region shall disclose their exposure within thirty (30) days to the IFC and to their Regional regulators; (C) cross-Regional financial institutions with exposure to the affected Region's instruments shall be subject to tiered stress-testing requirements: institutions with exposure exceeding three percent (3%) of assets shall disclose their exposure and conduct internal stress tests within sixty (60) days, reporting results to the IFC and their Regional regulators; institutions with exposure exceeding five percent (5%) of assets shall conduct and publish stress tests within sixty (60) days.
- (3) The affected Region may not use common market mechanisms, mutual recognition requirements, or interstate commerce provisions to export losses to other Regions. Any transaction designed to shift financial losses arising from the Region's fiscal distress to financial institutions, pension funds, or governmental entities in other Regions is voidable upon petition by the receiving party or by the IFC. This prohibition extends to transactions routed through private conduit vehicles, special purpose vehicles, interstate shell entities, or any other intermediary structure designed to circumvent the loss export prohibition.
- (4) The IFC shall coordinate contagion resolution with the objective of containing systemic risk while preserving interstate commerce and essential government functions in the affected Region. The IFC may authorize continued recognition of specific instruments upon finding that the instruments individually meet Asset Quality Floors notwithstanding the Region's general certification failure.
- (5) Contagion firewall measures under this subsection supplement the IFC Fiscal Intervention Hierarchy of Section 10. Subsections (u) through (w) establish the standard operating environment for financial instrument recognition applicable to all Regions at all times; Section 10 Stage 3 constitutes the emergency response for Regions already in fiscal distress, imposing enhanced measures including certification suspension, elevated asset quality floors, and escalated contagion firewalls. Where the escalation provisions of Section 10 and the automatic firewalls of this subsection overlap, both apply; the more protective provision governs. Nothing in this subsection limits the IFC's authority to impose enhanced measures under Section 10 Stage 3 or to initiate Financial Conservatorship under Section 7.
- (6) **Interaction with Mutual Recognition.** The financial instrument recognition framework of subsections (u) through (w) governs interstate recognition of Regional financial instruments and is independent of the general mutual recognition framework of Article I-RF, Section 9. Section 9's recognition of legal status, professional credentials, and family status is not affected by this subsection. Where a financial instrument could be characterized as a "legal determination" under Section 9(b), the standards of this subsection prevail for purposes of interstate recognition. An explicit carve-out is established in Article I-RF, Section 9(ee).

### Art I-RF §9(ee). Financial Instrument Carve-Out

*Cross-reference for Gap 137 — establishes explicit carve-out in §9 to prevent §9(b) arguments for financial instrument recognition.*

Add new subsection (ee) to Section 9:

(ee) **Financial Instrument Carve-Out.** Interstate recognition of financial instruments — including bonds, notes, certificates, and any obligation issued by or guaranteed by a Regional government, Regional Development Bank, or Regional instrumentality — is governed exclusively by Article X-RF, Section 6, subsections (u) through (w), and is not subject to the general mutual recognition requirements of this Section. No financial instrument may claim recognition under subsection (b) or any other provision of this Section as an alternative to compliance with the solvency certification and asset quality requirements of Article X-RF, Section 6. This carve-out does not affect the recognition of general business registrations, corporate registrations, or property titles under subsection (b), except insofar as such registrations are used as a vehicle for obtaining interstate recognition of financial instruments that would otherwise be subject to Article X-RF, Section 6(u)-(w).

---

## 6. Design Questions for Reviewers

1. **§9 carve-out**: Should there also be an explicit carve-out in Art I-RF §9 stating that financial instruments are governed by Art X-RF §6(u)-(w), or is the interaction clause in §6(w)(6) sufficient to prevent §9(b) arguments?

2. **Annual certification frequency**: Is annual solvency certification the right frequency? Should it be semi-annual (more protective but more burdensome) or biennial (less burdensome but larger window for deterioration)?

3. **IFC-set vs. constitutional floors**: The proposal delegates asset quality floor-setting to the IFC. Should minimum floor standards be constitutional (harder to weaken) rather than delegated (more adaptable)?

4. **Automatic vs. discretionary firewall**: The proposal uses automatic triggers. Should the contagion firewall require an affirmative IFC finding (more deliberate) or activate automatically upon certification failure (faster but potentially over-inclusive)?

5. **Existing instruments grandfathering**: The proposal allows existing instruments issued during valid certification to retain recognition. Could this be gamed by issuing massive volumes of instruments just before certification lapses?

6. **Stress-testing threshold**: Is 5% of assets the right threshold for mandatory stress testing? Should it be lower (3%) for more protective coverage or higher (10%) to reduce compliance burden?

7. **Interaction with Section 10 Stage 3**: The proposal says both frameworks apply and the more protective governs. Is this clearly non-contradictory, or does it need sharper reconciliation language?

## 7. Interaction with Existing Provisions

| New Provision | Interacts With | Relationship |
|---|---|---|
| §6(u) Solvency Certification | Art I-RF §9(b) Legal Status Recognition | Overrides — financial instruments not subject to automatic §9 mutual recognition; certification required |
| §6(u) Solvency Certification | Art X-RF §10 Stage 3 | Baseline/escalation — §6(u) establishes proactive certification; §10 Stage 3 suspends it reactively |
| §6(u)(1) Mid-Cycle Trigger | Art X-RF §6(e)-(h) Sustainability Monitoring | Supplements — sustainability monitoring provides general tracking; mid-cycle trigger enables certification response to rapid deterioration |
| §6(u)(4) No Federal Guarantee | Art X-RF §6(s) Market Discipline | Reinforces — certification does not create moral hazard by implying federal backing |
| §6(u)(6) Certification Hostage Protection | Art XIV-RF Constitutional Court | Safeguard — prevents IFC from weaponizing certification delay against a Region |
| §6(v) Asset Quality Floors | Art X-RF §6(o)-(r) Off-Balance-Sheet Controls | Supplements — consolidated reporting captures hidden debt; quality floors ensure recognized instruments meet minimums |
| §6(v)(3) Anti-Repackaging | Art X-RF §6(p) IFC Piercing Authority | Extends — existing piercing authority for debt attribution expanded to financial instrument quality assessment, including synthetic instruments and SPVs |
| §6(v)(4) Floor Ratchet | Art X-RF §6(s) Market Discipline | Compatible — floors set minimums for interstate recognition; market pricing operates independently |
| §6(v)(6) Private Conduit Vehicles | Art X-RF §6(o) Consolidated Reporting | Supplements — consolidated reporting captures hidden debt; conduit vehicle piercing captures hidden Regional obligations in nominally private entities |
| §6(w) Contagion Firewall | Art X-RF §7 Conservatorship | Triggered by — Conservatorship is one of four triggers for automatic firewall activation |
| §6(w)(2)(C) Tiered Stress Testing | Art X-RF §6(e)-(h) Sustainability Monitoring | Supplements — sustainability monitoring tracks Regional fiscal health; stress testing assesses cross-Regional exposure impact |
| §6(w)(3) Loss Export Prohibition | Art X-RF §6(i) No-Bailout Commitment | Parallel — no-bailout prevents federal rescue; loss export prohibition prevents neighbor exploitation, including through intermediary structures |
| §6(w)(5) Section 10 Interaction | Art X-RF §10 Fiscal Intervention Hierarchy | Explicit harmonization — §6(u)-(w) is standard operating environment; §10 Stage 3 is emergency response; more protective provision governs |
| §6(w)(6) §9 Interaction | Art I-RF §9 Mutual Recognition | Explicit override — financial instruments governed by §6(u)-(w), not §9(b) |
| §9(ee) Financial Instrument Carve-Out | Art I-RF §9(b) Legal Status Recognition | Explicit carve-out — prevents §9(b) arguments for financial instrument recognition; directs to §6(u)-(w) |

## 8. Review Findings Incorporated

Two independent reviews were conducted. All findings have been incorporated into the revised text in Section 5 above.

### Finding Summary

| ID | Severity | Finding | Resolution |
|----|----------|---------|------------|
| F1 | HIGH | Grandfathering creates dumping window — Region could issue massive volumes of instruments just before certification lapses, exploiting unlimited recognition of existing instruments | Replaced unlimited grandfathering with 90-day recognition window in §6(u)(5)(A); added issuance spike de-recognition authority in §6(u)(5)(C): IFC may retroactively de-recognize instruments issued during spike period (>150% of average quarterly issuance) in the 90 days preceding lapse. R2's 90-day window adopted as cleaner than R1's volume cap; R1's spike detection refinement incorporated |
| F2 | MEDIUM | IFC-only floor-setting risks regulatory capture or political weakening; purely delegated floors lack constitutional permanence | Adopted hybrid approach in §6(v)(1): four floor categories (capital adequacy, NPL ratios, disclosure, independent rating) are constitutionally mandated; IFC sets specific numerical thresholds within categories. Categories cannot be eliminated; Congress may add categories by 2/3 vote but may not remove constitutional categories. Both reviewers agreed on this approach |
| F3 | MEDIUM | Prong (D) "objective indicators as determined by IFC" too vague — grants broad discretionary power without accountability standards | Added published finding requirement for prong (D) in §6(w)(1): IFC must publish finding identifying specific indicators, factual basis, and systemic risk posed. Prongs (A)-(C) remain automatic. R1 refinement adopted; R2 agrees automatic triggers are correct for prongs (A)-(C) |
| F4 | MEDIUM | Uniform 5% stress-test threshold may be too high for initial detection of exposure risk; institutions with 3-5% exposure go unmonitored | Adopted tiered approach in §6(w)(2)(C): 3% triggers disclosure + internal stress test; 5% triggers mandatory publication. R1 refinement prevails; R2's preference for uniform 5% provides insufficient early detection |
| F5 | LOW | §9 interaction clause in §6(w)(6) alone may be insufficient to prevent §9(b) arguments — defensive litigants may argue §9(b) creates independent recognition right | Added explicit carve-out as Art I-RF §9(ee) directing financial instrument recognition exclusively to §6(u)-(w). Both reviewers agree belt-and-suspenders approach is warranted |
| F6 | LOW | Private conduit vehicle / interstate shell company vector — Region could route toxic instruments through nominally private SPVs or shell entities to evade direct-instrument quality floors | Extended anti-repackaging in §6(v)(3) to cover SPVs, shell entities, and private conduit vehicles; added §6(v)(6) for instruments issued by private entities with Regional government backing; extended loss export prohibition in §6(w)(3) to intermediary structures. Both reviewers identified this vector |
| F7 | LOW | Certification hostage — IFC could delay certification to de facto punish a Region or manipulate financial markets | Added §6(u)(6): automatic extension of existing certification if IFC misses audit deadline (90 days) or expedited review deadline (30 days); Constitutional Court petition available if delay appears targeted. R2 vector; no R1 objection |
| F8 | LOW | Synthetic/derivative exposure — credit default swaps and derivatives whose value derives from Regional instruments could evade quality floors by nominally not being "Regional financial instruments" | Extended §6(v)(3) anti-repackaging to explicitly cover synthetic instruments, credit default swaps, collateralized debt obligations, and derivatives derived from Regional instruments. R1 identified vector |
| F9 | LOW | Annual certification frequency leaves up to 12-month window for fiscal deterioration between audits | Added mid-cycle Material Change Trigger in §6(u)(1): IFC may initiate interim audit upon debt-to-GDP increase exceeding 5 percentage points per quarter, dual rating downgrade within 6 months, or material restatement notification. Both reviewers agree on annual + trigger approach; R2's specific threshold adopted |

### Design Questions Resolved

| Question | Resolution |
|----------|------------|
| 1. §9 carve-out | Add explicit carve-out in §9(ee) — both reviewers agree. Interaction clause in §6(w)(6) provides primary override; §9(ee) provides belt-and-suspenders protection against §9(b) arguments |
| 2. Annual certification frequency | Annual + mid-cycle Material Change Trigger — both reviewers agree. Annual provides baseline; mid-cycle triggers on objective indicators (debt-to-GDP spike, dual downgrade, material restatement) close the deterioration window without imposing routine semi-annual burden |
| 3. IFC-set vs. constitutional floors | Hybrid — both reviewers agree. Four categories constitutionally mandated (capital adequacy, NPL ratios, disclosure, independent rating); IFC sets specific numerical standards within categories. Categories cannot be eliminated; Congress may add by 2/3 vote. Balances constitutional permanence with adaptive threshold-setting |
| 4. Automatic vs. discretionary firewall | Automatic for prongs (A)-(C); published finding for prong (D) — R1 refinement adopted. Certification failure, pattern violation, and conservatorship entry are objective events requiring no discretion. "Objective indicators of imminent default" requires published IFC finding with specific factual basis to prevent subjective overreach |
| 5. Existing instruments grandfathering | 90-day recognition window — R2 prevails. Cleaner and more predictable than R1's volume cap approach. Combined with issuance spike de-recognition authority (>150% of average quarterly issuance in 90 days pre-lapse) to prevent front-running |
| 6. Stress-testing threshold | Tiered: 3% disclosure + internal test; 5% mandatory publication — R1 prevails. Uniform 5% provides insufficient early detection; tiered approach captures at-risk institutions at lower threshold without imposing full publication burden on modest exposures |
| 7. Interaction with Section 10 Stage 3 | Explicit harmonization — R2 phrasing adopted. §6(u)-(w) is "standard operating environment" for all Regions at all times; §10 Stage 3 is "emergency response" for Regions in fiscal distress. Both apply where they overlap; more protective provision governs |
