# Category IV: Long-Horizon Systemic Risks

> These gaps describe risks that develop over decades rather than years—gradual divergence, institutional wear, and identity crystallization that may erode the system's foundations even if acute crises are successfully managed.

## Gap 9 — Inter-Regional Divergence Over Time

**Description:**
Even with equalization, regions may diverge economically and culturally.

**Risk:**
Resentment narratives, regional identity hardening, legitimacy strain.

**Status:**
Mitigated by mobility, benefits floor, amendment adaptability; not eliminable.

---

## Gap 10 — Institutional Fatigue and Complexity

**Description:**
The system is administratively complex and demanding.

**Risk:**
Implementation fatigue, uneven capacity, bureaucratic erosion.

**Status:**
Accepted tradeoff in exchange for survivability.

## Gap 11 — Boundary Revision Politics and Regional Identity Crystallization

**Description:**
Regional boundaries are subject to periodic review ([Article I, Section 4](../../02-design/constitution/01-regional-structure.md)), but the political dynamics of boundary revision are unpredictable.

**Risk:**

- Regional identities may harden around current boundaries, making revision politically toxic.
- Boundary revision commissions may become sites of partisan conflict.
- Proposals perceived as advantaging one party may delegitimize the process.
- "Winners and losers" narratives around map changes could undermine regional cooperation.

**Status:**
Mitigated by supermajority and popular referendum requirements; long-horizon risk that may intensify as regional identities mature. Implementation details including Commission composition, appointment procedures, and anti-manipulation provisions are in the [Regional Boundary Review and Revision Act](../../proposals/01-foundations/boundary-review-act.md).
