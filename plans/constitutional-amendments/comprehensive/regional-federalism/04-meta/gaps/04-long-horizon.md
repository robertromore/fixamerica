# Category IV: Long-Horizon Systemic Risks

> These gaps describe risks that develop over decades rather than years—gradual divergence, institutional wear, and identity crystallization that may erode the system's foundations even if acute crises are successfully managed.

## Gap 9 — Inter-Regional Divergence Over Time

**Description:**
Even with equalization, regions may diverge economically and culturally.

**Risk:**
Resentment narratives, regional identity hardening, legitimacy strain.

**Status:**
Mitigated by mobility, benefits floor, amendment adaptability; not eliminable.

---

## Gap 10 — Institutional Fatigue and Complexity

**Description:**
The system is administratively complex and demanding.

**Risk:**
Implementation fatigue, uneven capacity, bureaucratic erosion.

**Status:**
Accepted tradeoff in exchange for survivability.

## Gap 11 — Boundary Revision Politics and Regional Identity Crystallization

**Description:**
Regional boundaries are subject to periodic review ([Article I, Section 4](../../02-design/constitution/01-regional-structure.md)), but the political dynamics of boundary revision are unpredictable.

**Risk:**

- Regional identities may harden around current boundaries, making revision politically toxic.
- Boundary revision commissions may become sites of partisan conflict.
- Proposals perceived as advantaging one party may delegitimize the process.
- "Winners and losers" narratives around map changes could undermine regional cooperation.

**Status:**
RESOLVED. Key anti-manipulation safeguards constitutionalized as [Article I, Section 4-A](../../02-design/constitution/01-regional-structure.md) (Boundary Revision Governance): mandatory 20-year review cycle tied to decennial census, Commission independence floor (multi-source appointments, party balance cap with 10-year affiliation definition, disqualification period, removal for cause, 90-day vacancy auto-fill, interim Commission trigger), budget floor with surge model (0.0002% base / 0.001% review-cycle surge with carryover), constitutionalized prohibited criteria (partisan advantage, racial advantage, retaliatory punishment), anti-obstruction mechanism (18-month congressional deadline with Commission bypass to direct referendum), 4-year cooling-off period, extended election blackout to all federal general elections, Region dissolution consent requirement, and anti-retaliation enforcement. Statutory detail remains in the [Regional Boundary Review and Revision Act](../../proposals/01-foundations/boundary-review-act.md); constitutional text sets floors Congress cannot lower. Residual sociological risk of identity hardening is inherent and not eliminable by constitutional text.
