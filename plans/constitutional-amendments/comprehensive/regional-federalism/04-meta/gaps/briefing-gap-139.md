# Briefing: Gap 139 — State-Level "Abolition" of Cooperating Sub-units

## 1. The Problem

**Gap 139** identifies a structural vulnerability in the State-local-Regional triangle. Article II-RF, Section 3 reserves "local government law" to States — meaning States have plenary authority over the existence, structure, and powers of local governments within their territory. A State that opposes a Regional project could exploit this authority by abolishing, restructuring, or incapacitating the very local government unit that has entered into a coordination agreement for the project, effectively vetoing Regional authority through the back door of local government law.

### The Attack Vectors

| Vector | Mechanism | Effect |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **"Direct Management" Dissolution** | City enters coordination agreement for Regional rail project; State dissolves city, creates "Direct State Management District" with no authority to honor Regional agreements | No legal entity remains to implement Regional agreement; project loses implementation partner |
| **"Merger" Nullification** | County cooperates with Regional energy coordination; State forces merger with non-cooperating adjacent county; new merged entity repudiates prior agreements | Regional project loses implementation partner through entity replacement |
| **"Charter Revision" Veto** | Municipality's charter enables Regional cooperation; State revokes home rule, imposes state-drafted charter prohibiting Regional coordination agreements | Cooperation legally impossible without dissolution; functional veto achieved |

### Why Existing Protections Are Insufficient

| Protection | What It Covers | What It Misses |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Art II-RF §3 (State and Local Powers) | Reserves local government law to States | Precisely the vulnerability — States can use this reservation to destroy cooperating units |
| Art II-RF §4(l) (Local Government Obstruction) | Local governments that *refuse* cooperation | Opposite problem — addresses non-cooperation by locals, not State destruction of cooperating locals |
| Art II-RF §4(k) (Administrative Non-Compliance) | State failure to submit implementation plans | Addresses State delay and refusal, not State destruction of the implementing entity |
| Art II-RF §4(r) (Anti-Manipulation Safeguard) | State constitutional amendments to block Regional authority | Addresses State constitutional gaming, not State exercise of existing local-government-law authority |
| Art II-RF §1(f) (Federal Enforcement Immunity) | Federal personnel licensing and permitting barriers | Protects federal enforcement operations, not local government cooperation with Regional projects |

### The Critical Interaction: §4(l) References a Non-Existent Protection

Article II-RF, Section 4(l) states that "the Local Autonomy Floor established in Article II-RF, Section 3 is preserved" — but Section 3 currently contains no such floor. This forward reference anticipates a protection that has never been enacted, leaving a gap in the framework: §4(l) assumes cooperating locals are protected from State interference, but no such protection exists.

---

## 2. Existing Coverage Analysis

### What Exists

- **Art II-RF §3**: Reserves local government law to States; local governments retain authority over implementation and service delivery — but no constraints on State exercise of this authority
- **Art II-RF §4(l)**: Holds States responsible when their local delegates refuse cooperation; references undefined "Local Autonomy Floor"
- **Art II-RF §4(k)**: Administrative non-compliance escalation (notice → funding withholding → direct implementation → reclassification)
- **Art II-RF §4(n)**: Cost recovery for non-compliance, including 15% surcharge
- **Art II-RF §4(o)**: Waiver of State sovereign immunity for actions under Section 4
- **Art II-RF §4(r)**: Anti-manipulation safeguard — prohibits State constitutional circumvention of Regional authority
- **Art II-RF §1(f)**: Federal Enforcement Operational Immunity — parallel pattern of ARB obstruction identification with escalating remedies

### What Does Not Exist

- No protection against retaliatory abolition of cooperating local government units
- No project continuity mechanism preserving coordination agreements through restructuring
- No registration system to identify which agreements are protected
- No successor liability ensuring project obligations survive unit dissolution
- No State Bad Faith finding for pattern abuse of local-government-law authority
- No legitimate restructuring safe harbor allowing genuine reorganization while ensuring project continuity
- The "Local Autonomy Floor" referenced by §4(l) does not exist in Section 3

## 3. Related Gaps

| Gap | Relationship |
|-----|-------------|
| **96** (Local Hollowing Out via Regional Preemption) | PA — Regional preemption of locals; Gap 139 addresses State abolition of locals cooperating with Regions |
| **59** (State-Regional Preemption) | Resolved — vertical supremacy between State and Region; Gap 139 addresses the State-local-Regional triangle |
| **99** (Tribal Veto) | Resolved — third-party project obstruction; Gap 139 addresses State-level project obstruction through local abolition |
| **135** (Licensing of Federal Operations) | Resolved — Art II §1(f); parallel pattern of ARB obstruction identification and escalating consequences |

---

## 4. Proposed Approach: Sub-Unit Cooperation Protection

A new **Section 3-B** added to Article II-RF, establishing project continuity protection through ARB registration, prohibited State actions with a legitimate restructuring safe harbor, and successor liability with escalating consequences for pattern abuse.

### Design Principles

1. **Protection on notice, not registration**: Protection attaches when the sub-Regional unit delivers notice to the State — closing the pre-registration dissolution window. Registration remains ministerial, with post-registration State challenge for sham or fraud.
2. **Scope limited by proximate nexus**: Protected functions must have a direct and proximate nexus to project implementation. The ARB may narrow overbroad registrations. States retain full authority over non-project matters.
3. **Effect-based test**: Prohibited interference is determined by practical effect, not stated purpose — consistent with the Art II §1(f) pattern.
4. **Legitimate restructuring preserved**: States may reorganize local governments for genuine reasons if project continuity is ensured through objective "but-for" criteria and binding successor commitments. The ARB serves as gatekeeper, not blocker.
5. **Successor liability with capacity assurance**: Dissolution of a protected unit does not terminate project obligations — they transfer to successor entities and ultimately to the State. Where successor entities lack equivalent capacity, the State must provide supplemental resources.
6. **Escalating consequences**: First Bad Faith Finding triggers advisory-body suspension and enhanced protection; second finding within ten years permits Full Preemption reclassification.
7. **Anti-retaliation lookback**: State actions taken within ninety days before notice delivery are presumptively retaliatory, preventing pre-registration ambush attacks.

## 5. Proposed Constitutional Text

### Art II-RF §3-B. Sub-Unit Cooperation Protection

*Resolves Gap 139 — State-Level "Abolition" of Cooperating Sub-units. This section prevents States from vetoing Regional projects by abolishing, restructuring, or incapacitating local government units that have entered into coordination agreements for Regional project implementation, while preserving legitimate State restructuring authority.*

Add new Section 3-B after Section 3-A:

(a) **Project Continuity Protection.**

(1) When a sub-Regional unit — including any municipality, county, township, special district, or other local government entity — enters into a formal coordination agreement for a project within a Regional Exclusive Domain or Cooperative Implementation domain, the unit may register the agreement with the Allocation Review Board. Registration requires: (A) a copy of the executed coordination agreement; (B) identification of the project and the Regional authority under which it is undertaken; (C) identification of the local governmental functions having a direct and proximate nexus to project implementation; and (D) written notice to the State in which the unit is located, provided at least fourteen (14) days before registration.

(2) **Interim Protection.** Protection under this section attaches upon delivery of written notice to the State under paragraph (1)(D), not upon ARB registration. From the date of notice delivery until ARB registration or denial, the State may not take any action described in subsection (b)(1) with respect to the notified unit. A State action taken against a sub-Regional unit within ninety (90) days before the unit delivers notice under paragraph (1)(D) is presumed retaliatory and subject to review under subsection (b)(4); the State may rebut this presumption by clear and convincing evidence that the action was initiated before the coordination agreement was contemplated.

(3) Upon registration, the sub-Regional unit's legal existence and the governmental functions identified in the registration as having a direct and proximate nexus to project implementation are protected under this section. Protection does not extend to governmental functions unrelated to the registered project.

(4) Protection continues until the earliest of: (A) completion of the project; (B) mutual termination of the coordination agreement by the sub-Regional unit and the Region; (C) deregistration by the ARB under subsection (c)(3); or (D) ARB approval of a State restructuring that ensures project continuity under subsection (b)(3).

(5) Registration is ministerial; the ARB shall register any agreement that meets the requirements of paragraph (1) within thirty (30) days. The ARB may not refuse registration based on the merits of the underlying project or the desirability of the coordination agreement. However, the ARB shall review whether the governmental functions identified under paragraph (1)(C) have a direct and proximate nexus to project implementation and may narrow the scope of protected functions to those satisfying this standard. The State may challenge a registration within ninety (90) days of registration on the ground that the coordination agreement is a sham or that the registration was procured by fraud. The ARB shall rule on such challenges within sixty (60) days.

(b) **Prohibited State Actions.**

(1) During the protection period, the State in which the protected unit is located may not, without ARB approval: (A) dissolve, merge, or consolidate the protected unit; (B) revoke or materially alter the unit's home rule authority, charter, or enabling statute insofar as the alteration would impair the unit's capacity to perform its obligations under the coordination agreement; (C) transfer functions necessary for project implementation from the protected unit to a State agency or different local entity; (D) impose mandates, conditions, or restrictions that have the practical effect of preventing or materially impeding project implementation, regardless of facial neutrality; or (E) create or expand a parallel governmental entity with overlapping regulatory, permitting, or veto authority over the protected unit's project-related functions, where the practical effect is to nullify or circumvent the protected unit's capacity to implement the coordination agreement.

(2) State actions that fall within paragraph (1) are suspended as applied to the protected project. The protected unit's legal existence and project-related authority continue notwithstanding any State law, order, or administrative action to the contrary. Suspension under this paragraph does not affect the State action's validity as applied to governmental functions unrelated to the protected project.

(3) **Legitimate Restructuring.** A State may petition the ARB for approval to restructure a protected unit. The ARB shall grant the petition if the State demonstrates that: (A) the restructuring would have been undertaken regardless of the Regional project, as evidenced by a documented record of the restructuring rationale predating the coordination agreement or arising from circumstances unrelated to Regional cooperation; (B) the successor entity will assume all obligations under the coordination agreement through a binding written commitment filed with the ARB as a condition of approval, with equivalent or superior institutional capacity to perform the protected functions — and where the successor entity lacks equivalent capacity, the State shall provide supplemental resources, personnel, or technical assistance sufficient to ensure equivalent capacity; and (C) the restructuring will not materially impair or delay project implementation. The ARB shall act on restructuring petitions within sixty (60) days. Approval may include conditions ensuring project continuity. The binding successor commitment filed under this paragraph is enforceable by the Region directly against the successor entity and the State.

(4) The ARB shall determine whether a State action constitutes prohibited interference under paragraph (1). The determination shall be based on the practical effect of the State action, regardless of its stated purpose or facial neutrality. The criteria of paragraph (1)(A)-(E) are disjunctive; satisfaction of any one is sufficient. Temporal proximity between the State action and the coordination agreement or project milestones constitutes evidence of prohibited purpose.

(c) **Successor Liability, Enforcement, and Deregistration.**

(1) If a State takes action prohibited under subsection (b) without ARB approval, or in violation of conditions imposed by the ARB: (A) any successor entity — including State agencies, newly created districts, or merged entities — assumes all obligations of the dissolved or restructured unit under the coordination agreement, and where the successor entity lacks the institutional capacity to perform the protected functions, the State shall provide the resources, personnel, and technical assistance necessary to ensure equivalent capacity; (B) the Region may enforce the coordination agreement directly against the State; (C) the State is liable for all project delays and additional costs attributable to the prohibited action; and (D) cost recovery shall follow the procedures of Section 4(n) of this Article, including the fifteen percent (15%) administrative surcharge.

(2) **State Bad Faith Finding.** If the ARB determines that a State has taken prohibited action under subsection (b) on two (2) or more occasions within any five (5) year period — whether involving the same or different sub-Regional units — or that a single prohibited action has impacted two (2) or more registered projects, the ARB may issue a State Bad Faith Finding. Upon issuance: (A) the State's participation in Regional governance advisory bodies is suspended for the duration of the finding; (B) all coordination agreements registered by sub-Regional units within that State receive enhanced protection, requiring a two-thirds (2/3) supermajority of the ARB for approval of any State restructuring petition under subsection (b)(3) for the duration of the finding; (C) the finding is subject to judicial review by the Constitutional Court upon petition within thirty (30) days; and (D) the finding may be lifted when the ARB certifies that the State has adopted structural reforms sufficient to prevent recurrence, including legislation or constitutional amendments protecting local government cooperation with Regional projects. If a second State Bad Faith Finding is issued within ten (10) years of a prior finding, the ARB may recommend reclassification of the affected project domains from Cooperative Implementation to Regional Exclusive Domain under the procedures of Article II-RF, Section 2, removing State implementation discretion entirely.

(3) **Deregistration.** The ARB may deregister a coordination agreement upon finding that: (A) the project has been abandoned by the Region or the sub-Regional unit; or (B) the sub-Regional unit has materially breached the coordination agreement, provided that the breach was not caused or substantially contributed to by State action prohibited under subsection (b). Before deregistration for breach, the ARB shall provide the sub-Regional unit with written notice specifying the breach and a ninety (90) day cure period. Where the alleged breach results from State interference — including funding reductions, staffing restrictions, or regulatory burdens imposed on the sub-Regional unit — the breach shall be attributed to the State rather than the sub-Regional unit, and the State's action shall be evaluated under subsection (b).

(4) **Interaction with Local Government Obstruction.** This section addresses State interference with cooperating sub-units and is complementary to Section 4(l), which addresses local refusal to cooperate. Where a State dissolves a cooperating unit and the successor unit ceases cooperation, the State action shall be treated as prohibited interference under subsection (b), and the State remains responsible for project implementation under Section 4(l)(1)-(2). The protections established by this section constitute the Local Autonomy Floor referenced in Section 4(l).

(d) **Transition.**

(1) Sub-Regional units that have entered into coordination agreements before the ratification of this section may register such agreements under subsection (a) within one hundred eighty (180) days of ratification. Interim protection under subsection (a)(2) applies from the date of notice delivery under the registration process.

(2) State restructuring actions completed before the ratification of this section are not subject to review under this section, but obligations under coordination agreements that survived such restructuring may be registered and protected prospectively.

## 6. Design Questions for Reviewers

1. **Registration trigger**: Should protection require ARB registration (creating a clear trigger but adding bureaucracy), or should it attach automatically to any formal coordination agreement? The proposal uses registration for clarity — is this the right tradeoff?

2. **State notification period**: Is 30 days before registration sufficient for State input, or should the State have an opportunity to object before registration takes effect? Should the State be able to block registration?

3. **Bad Faith window**: Is 10 years the right period for the State Bad Faith Finding? Should it be shorter (5 years, aligning with §1(f)'s pattern obstruction threshold) or is 10 years appropriate given the longer timescale of infrastructure projects?

4. **Governance suspension scope**: The proposal suspends State participation in "Regional governance advisory bodies" upon a Bad Faith Finding. Should this extend to more significant consequences (e.g., State representation in Regional legislative bodies), or is advisory-body suspension proportionate?

5. **Legitimate restructuring standard**: Should the standard be "reasons unrelated to the Regional project" (intent-based) or "restructuring that ensures project continuity" (effect-based)? The proposal uses both — is this clear?

6. **Scope of protected domains**: Should protection extend to Cooperative Implementation domains as well as Regional Exclusive Domains? The proposal covers both — should it be limited to Exclusive Domains only?

7. **Ministerial registration**: Making registration ministerial prevents ARB gatekeeping but could enable gaming through frivolous registrations. Should there be a minimal substantive review, or is ministerial registration the right approach?

## 8. Review Findings Incorporated

Two independent reviews were conducted. All findings have been incorporated into the revised text in Section 5 above.

### Finding Summary

| ID | Severity | Finding | Resolution |
|----|----------|---------|------------|
| F1 | CRITICAL | Pre-registration dissolution window — 30-day notice period is a kill switch; State can dissolve unit during notice period before protection attaches | Protection now attaches on notice delivery, not registration (§3-B(a)(2)). Notice reduced from 30 to 14 days. Anti-retaliation 90-day lookback with clear-and-convincing rebuttal standard added. Both reviewers agree pre-registration window is the most critical vulnerability |
| F2 | CRITICAL | "Void as applied" is unenforceable for dissolution — once a unit is dissolved, there is no entity left to restore; voiding the State action does not recreate the entity | Replaced "void as applied" with "suspended as applied" in §3-B(b)(2). Protected unit's legal existence continues notwithstanding State law. Suspension is the operative remedy, not post-hoc voiding. Both reviewers agree dissolution requires preventive rather than restorative remedy |
| F3 | HIGH | Ministerial registration enables gaming — sub-Regional units could register overbroad function lists to immunize entire governmental operations from State oversight | Added scope limitation: functions must have "direct and proximate nexus" to project implementation (§3-B(a)(1)(C), (a)(3), (a)(5)). ARB may narrow scope during registration. Post-registration State challenge within 90 days for sham/fraud (§3-B(a)(5)). R1's scope limitation combined with R2's post-registration challenge |
| F4 | HIGH | Functional transfer workaround — State creates parallel entity with overlapping authority, draining protected unit's effective power without formally dissolving it | Added §3-B(b)(1)(E): prohibition on creating or expanding parallel entities with overlapping regulatory, permitting, or veto authority over project-related functions. Both reviewers identified this "structural hollowing" vector |
| F5 | HIGH | Legitimate restructuring standard vague — "reasons unrelated to the Regional project" is intent-based and easily gamed | Replaced with objective "but-for" test (§3-B(b)(3)(A)): restructuring must have been undertaken regardless of the Regional project, evidenced by documented record predating the agreement. Added binding written successor commitment as condition of approval (§3-B(b)(3)(B)). R2's objective criteria adopted over R1's dual test |
| F6 | HIGH | Bad Faith Finding threshold too lenient — 10-year window allows States to space out prohibited actions; consequences insufficient to deter | Reduced to 5-year window (§3-B(c)(2)), aligning with §1(f)(4)'s pattern obstruction threshold. Added project-impact counting: single action affecting 2+ registered projects also triggers finding. Both reviewers agree 5 years is the right period |
| F7 | MEDIUM | Governance suspension insufficient — advisory body suspension is a minor consequence that does not meaningfully deter pattern abuse | Implemented escalating consequences: first finding suspends advisory participation (§3-B(c)(2)(A)); second finding within 10 years permits Full Preemption reclassification from Cooperative to Exclusive Domain (§3-B(c)(2) final sentence). R1's escalation framework combined with R2's reclassification recommendation |
| F8 | MEDIUM | Successor liability assumes fungible capacity — successor entity may lack technical expertise, institutional relationships, or operational capability of the dissolved unit | Added capacity assurance: where successor lacks equivalent capacity, State must provide supplemental resources, personnel, or technical assistance (§3-B(b)(3)(B), §3-B(c)(1)(A)). Applies both in legitimate restructuring (as condition) and in prohibited action (as obligation) |
| F9 | MEDIUM | Deregistration standard missing — no defined process for deregistration, and State-caused breach could be weaponized to trigger deregistration | Added §3-B(c)(3) with explicit deregistration procedure: 90-day cure period before deregistration for breach; State-caused breach (funding reductions, staffing restrictions, regulatory burdens) attributed to State rather than sub-Regional unit. R2's State-causation attribution adopted |
| F10 | MEDIUM | No transition provision — pre-existing coordination agreements have no path to protection under the new framework | Added §3-B(d): 180-day registration window for pre-ratification agreements; interim protection applies from notice delivery during registration process; pre-ratification State restructuring not retroactively reviewable but surviving obligations may be registered prospectively |
| F11 | MEDIUM | Successor commitment not binding — restructuring approval lacks enforceable obligation on successor entity | Added binding written commitment as condition of ARB restructuring approval (§3-B(b)(3)(B)). Commitment is enforceable by the Region directly against both the successor entity and the State (§3-B(b)(3) final sentence). Both reviewers agree enforceable commitment is necessary |

### Design Questions Resolved

| Question | Resolution |
|----------|------------|
| 1. Registration trigger | Protection attaches on notice delivery; ARB registration remains ministerial but with scope review. State may challenge within 90 days for sham/fraud. Combines R1's ministerial approach with R2's post-registration challenge. Registration creates clarity; notice delivery closes the pre-registration window |
| 2. State notification period | 14 days — compromise between R1 (retain 30 days) and R2 (eliminate or reduce to 7 days). Protection on notice delivery eliminates the kill-switch vulnerability regardless of period length. 14 days provides adequate State awareness without enabling delay gaming |
| 3. Bad Faith window | 5 years — both reviewers agree. Aligns with §1(f)(4)'s pattern obstruction threshold. Added project-impact counting: single action affecting 2+ projects also triggers finding. Five-year window prevents waiting out election cycles |
| 4. Governance suspension scope | Escalating — R1's approach adopted with R2's reclassification as ultimate consequence. First finding: advisory body suspension. Second finding within 10 years: Full Preemption reclassification recommendation. Proportionate escalation avoids disproportionate first-instance consequences while providing meaningful deterrent for pattern abuse |
| 5. Legitimate restructuring standard | Objective "but-for" test — R2 prevails. "Would have been undertaken regardless" with documented evidence, rather than intent-based "unrelated to" standard. Combined with binding successor commitment and capacity assurance for comprehensive protection |
| 6. Scope of protected domains | Both Exclusive and Cooperative domains — R1 prevails. Both domain types involve formal coordination agreements with sub-Regional units. Limiting to Exclusive Domains would leave the most common cooperation modality unprotected |
| 7. Ministerial registration | Combined approach — ministerial registration with scope review and post-registration challenge. ARB cannot refuse on merits but can narrow function scope to "direct and proximate nexus." State can challenge sham registrations within 90 days. Prevents both ARB gatekeeping and registration gaming |
