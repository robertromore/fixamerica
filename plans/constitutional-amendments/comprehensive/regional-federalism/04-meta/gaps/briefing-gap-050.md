# Briefing: Gap 50 — The "Safety Add-On" Protectionism Trap (Regulatory Labor Barriers)

## 1. Problem

The constitution prohibits explicit internal trade barriers and establishes comprehensive credential recognition (Art I §9(a)-(u)), but Regions can still erect de facto labor mobility barriers through non-credential regulatory mechanisms — zoning, insurance mandates, continuing education requirements, business licensing — that technically comply with mutual recognition while functionally blocking cross-regional labor movement. The "Safety Add-On" framing makes these barriers difficult to challenge: each individual requirement appears reasonable, but the cumulative effect creates a protectionist wall.

**Risks:**

- Workers cannot freely move across Regional boundaries despite Common Market promises
- Policy arbitrage returns — workers cannot escape poor Regional governance
- Labor shortages in high-demand Regions cannot be filled from surplus Regions
- Regulatory barriers are instantaneous; legal challenges take years (Axiom 7 violation)
- Existing credential protections (§9(g)-(u)) can be circumvented by imposing barriers outside the credential framework

## 2. Coverage Analysis

**Existing provisions:**

| Provision | What It Does | What It Lacks |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Art I §9(c) Professional Credentials | Mutual recognition with supplementary requirements | Supplementary requirements lack hard cost/time caps |
| Art I §9(g)-(i) Presumption/ESS/Prohibitions | Shifts burden, narrows permissible requirements | Applies only to credential supplements, not non-credential barriers |
| Art I §9(j)-(k) ARB Certification | Pre-approval for supplementary requirements | No legislative approval requirement; no sunset |
| Art I §9(m) Facially Neutral Discrimination | Strict scrutiny for disparate impact | Requires individual challenge; no quantitative trigger |
| Art I §9(n) Prohibited Practices | Bans conditioning on concessions, in-Region CE only | Does not address cumulative barrier stacking or non-credential regulations |
| Art I §9(bb)-(dd) Infrastructure Labor | Critical infrastructure credential reciprocity | Limited to infrastructure workers; no general labor market protection |
| Art I §6 Right of Transit | Physical transit; non-discriminatory fees | Does not address labor market entry barriers |

**What's missing:**

- Hard ceiling on equivalence cost and time (bridge pathway)
- Legislative accountability for divergence from mutual recognition
- Periodic renewal requirement for supplementary requirements (sunset)
- Cumulative barrier prohibition across related occupations
- Quantitative trigger for non-credential regulatory barriers to labor mobility
- Annual benchmark data enabling self-enforcement without ARB proceedings
- Protection against coordinated multi-Regional barrier adoption
- Data transparency and concealment penalties
- Regional purchasing power parity adjustment for cost-based thresholds
- Sub-Regional barrier accountability (municipal/county regulations)
- Private right of action for workers harmed by invalid barriers

## 3. Related Gaps

| Gap | Description | Interaction |
|-----|-------------|-------------|
| 65 | Regional "Credentialing Protectionism" | **Substantially resolved** — Gap 65 proposed credential-specific protections that are now largely adopted at §9(g)-(u). Residual elements (national credential floor standard, credential portability fund) deferred to legislative action. Gap 50 extends beyond Gap 65's scope to non-credential barriers and structural mechanisms (Divergence Declaration, Market Entry Disparity Standard). This resolution notes Gap 65 as substantially addressed. |
| 83 | "Infrastructure Decay" as Regional Coercion | Infrastructure barriers; Gap 50 addresses labor mobility barriers through regulatory complexity |
| 138 | "Double-Taxation" Border Blockade | Tax-based labor barriers; Gap 50 addresses regulatory labor barriers |
| 142 | Labeling pretexts | Product labeling protectionism; Gap 50 addresses labor market protectionism |
| 146 | "Administrative Exhaustion" Veto | Administrative delay; Gap 50 addresses regulatory complexity barriers to labor entry |

## 4. Proposed Approach

Add new subsections **(jj)-(mm)** to Article I, Section 9, under a new sub-heading "**Labor Market Mobility Protection**." These subsections extend beyond the existing credential-specific framework (§9(g)-(u)) to address:

1. **Divergence Declaration** (jj): Formalizes the supplementary requirement mechanism with legislative approval, hard cost/time caps, sunset, cumulative limits, sub-Regional accountability, and emergency-declaration prohibition — building on the existing ESS standard
2. **Market Entry Disparity Standard** (kk): Creates a quantitative trigger — adjusted for Regional Purchasing Power Parity — for non-credential regulatory barriers to labor mobility, with self-executing decertification, a private right of action, and a cumulative total-cost cap
3. **Coordinated Barrier Prohibition** (ll): Prevents multi-Regional regulatory cartelization with population-weighted triggers and safe harbors for federal standards
4. **Annual Benchmark Publication** (mm): Enables data-driven self-enforcement with mid-year challenge mechanism and graduated data-concealment escalation

**Design Principles:**

1. **Self-executing:** Worker presents credential and works; Region must affirmatively justify barriers (consistent with §9(f)). ARB maintains real-time Divergence Declaration Registry for institutional support.
2. **Quantitative triggers:** 20% RPPP-adjusted disparity threshold enables automatic identification without ARB proceedings
3. **Legislative accountability:** Barriers require legislative approval, not just agency action
4. **Cumulative protection:** Total barrier load across related occupations is capped — for both credential and non-credential requirements
5. **Builds on existing framework:** ESS standard (§9(h)), ARB certification (§9(j)), and prohibited justifications (§9(i)) remain operative; new provisions supplement with explicit subordination of (j)-(k) to the Divergence Declaration process

## 5. Proposed Constitutional Text

### Art I-RF §9(jj)-(mm). Labor Market Mobility Protection

*Resolves Gap 50 — The "Safety Add-On" Protectionism Trap. These subsections prevent Regions from using non-credential regulatory complexity to erect de facto labor mobility barriers, by establishing a formal Divergence Declaration mechanism with hard caps, a quantitative market entry disparity standard for non-credential barriers (adjusted for Regional purchasing power parity), an anti-cartelization clause, and mandatory annual benchmark data publication. Gap 65 (Regional "Credentialing Protectionism") is substantially resolved by the existing credential-specific protections at §9(g)-(u); the provisions below supplement that framework for non-credential barriers.*

#### Divergence Declaration Framework

(jj) **Divergence Declaration.**

(1) **Formal Mechanism.** A Region that seeks to impose any supplementary requirement on out-of-Region professionals beyond the requirements of the credential-issuing Region shall file a Divergence Declaration with the Allocation Review Board. No supplementary requirement may be imposed or enforced without a valid, unexpired Divergence Declaration. Subsections (j) and (k) continue in full force as components of the Divergence Declaration process; no supplementary requirement may be imposed through subsection (j) alone without also satisfying the requirements of this subsection.

(2) **Declaration Requirements.** A Divergence Declaration must:

- (A) identify the specific credential and the specific supplementary requirement;
- (B) document, with empirical evidence, a safety rationale meeting the Essential for Public Safety standard of subsection (h) and tied to conditions specific to the declaring Region — including geography, climate, population density, or infrastructure characteristics;
- (C) be approved by the Regional Legislature by majority vote — administrative agencies may not unilaterally impose supplementary requirements, and a supplementary requirement imposed by an agency without legislative approval is void;
- (D) include a bridge pathway permitting out-of-Region credential holders to achieve equivalence within sixty (60) days — measured from the date of application, including any wait time for enrollment, scheduling, or provider availability — and at a cost not exceeding one percent (1%) of the Regional median annual wage as published by the Independent Fiscal Council, as defined in Article XXI (Federal Price Unit and Indexing); the Allocation Review Board may, upon certification that a bridge pathway genuinely cannot be completed within sixty (60) days due to the nature of the subject matter, grant a single extension of up to thirty (30) additional days for occupations designated as High-Complexity — provided that no more than ten percent (10%) of all occupations with active Divergence Declarations may hold High-Complexity designation at any time;
- (E) demonstrate that the bridge pathway is accessible — including availability through at least two (2) approved providers within the Region (at least one of which must be accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting body, not solely by the Region's own licensing authority), online options where the subject matter permits, and wait times for enrollment not exceeding thirty (30) days from the date the worker applies; and the ARB shall publish pass/fail rates for each bridge pathway disaggregated by in-Region and out-of-Region candidates — a statistically significant disparity in pass rates triggers ARB investigation of provider fairness; and
- (F) receive ARB certification under subsection (j) that the supplementary requirement meets the Essential for Public Safety standard, subject to the ninety (90) day deemed-non-certified rule of subsection (k).

(3) **Self-Executing Recognition.** A worker holding a valid credential from any Region may present that credential and immediately commence work in any other Region. The burden is on the destination Region to demonstrate a valid, unexpired Divergence Declaration; absent such demonstration, the credential shall be honored without delay. The Allocation Review Board shall maintain a real-time, publicly accessible Divergence Declaration Registry; any supplementary requirement not listed in the Registry is presumptively void. Any enforcement action taken pursuant to a void or expired supplementary requirement — including denial of practice, fine, or disciplinary action — is unlawful and gives rise to the remedies of subsection (t).

(4) **Sunset and Renewal.** Each Divergence Declaration expires five (5) years after its effective date. Renewal requires the full declaration process under paragraph (2), including updated empirical evidence, renewed legislative approval, and fresh ARB certification. The renewal process shall include a sixty (60) day public comment period during which out-of-Region credential holders may submit evidence regarding the barrier's impact on cross-regional mobility. The ARB's renewal certification shall include analysis of the barrier's actual impact on cross-regional mobility since the prior certification, using the annual benchmark data from subsection (mm), and the ARB shall recommend against renewal unless the Region demonstrates continued necessity by updated evidence. Expired Divergence Declarations are void; the supplementary requirement ceases to be enforceable and Default Mutual Recognition applies immediately.

(5) **Cumulative Barrier Prohibition.** A Region may not impose multiple Divergence Declarations on related occupations where the cumulative bridge pathway across all related occupations exceeds ninety (90) days total or the cost equivalent of two percent (2%) of the Regional median annual wage total. If a new Divergence Declaration would cause the cumulative total to exceed either threshold, the Region must consolidate its supplementary requirements into a single bridge pathway that complies with the cumulative limits. Occupations are "related" under this paragraph if they share a common licensing root, overlapping scopes of practice, or sequential certification requirements; occupations are also related if a practitioner credentialed in one occupation in a majority of other Regions would be authorized to perform work classified under the other occupation in the declaring Region. A Region may not avoid the cumulative limits by splintering a single occupation into multiple sub-specialties or reclassifying existing occupations.

(6) **Interaction with Existing Framework.** The Divergence Declaration is the exclusive mechanism for imposing supplementary requirements under subsection (c). All supplementary requirements in effect at the effective date of this subsection — whether or not previously certified under subsection (l) — must be submitted as Divergence Declarations under paragraph (2) within two (2) years. Previously certified supplementary requirements remain enforceable during the transition period but expire if not resubmitted as Divergence Declarations. Supplementary requirements not submitted or not certified under this subsection are void upon expiration of the transition period. This subsection supersedes subsection (l) in its entirety upon the expiration of the transition period.

(7) **Sub-Regional Accountability.** The obligations of this subsection apply to supplementary requirements imposed by any governmental entity within a Region, including States, counties, municipalities, and special districts, regardless of whether such entities exercise delegated Regional authority or independent authority. The Region is responsible for ensuring compliance by all governmental entities within its jurisdiction.

(8) **Emergency Declaration Prohibition.** A Regional emergency declaration may not be used to reimpose, continue, or enforce a supplementary requirement that has been voided for lack of a valid Divergence Declaration, that has expired under paragraph (4), or that has been decertified under subsection (kk). Any emergency measure that has the effect of restoring a voided, expired, or decertified labor market barrier is void ab initio.

#### Market Entry Disparity Standard

(kk) **Market Entry Disparity Standard.**

(1) **Presumptive Invalidity.** A Regional regulation affecting cross-regional labor mobility — including but not limited to office or practice-location zoning, insurance or bonding mandates (regardless of the regulatory framework under which they are imposed), continuing education requirements, business licensing, equipment or technology mandates, and regulatory fee schedules — is presumptively invalid if it increases the cost or time of market entry for the regulated occupation by more than twenty percent (20%) compared to the National Median for the same occupation, as published by the Allocation Review Board under subsection (mm), after adjustment for Regional Purchasing Power Parity as calculated by the Independent Fiscal Council. Disparities of less than fifty (50) Federal Price Units (as defined in Article XXI) are not subject to this paragraph regardless of percentage.

(2) **Critical Shortage Standard.** For occupations designated as "Critical Shortage" by the Independent Fiscal Council — in consultation with the Department of Labor and relevant federal safety agencies — based on documented cross-regional demand-supply imbalance (including vacancy rates, cross-regional demand-supply ratios, and wage premium data), the relevant benchmark is the Validated National Floor — the lowest cost or time among Regions whose standards for the occupation have been certified by the ARB as meeting the Essential for Public Safety standard — rather than the National Median. If a Regional requirement exceeds the Validated National Floor by more than twenty percent (20%) after RPPP adjustment, the requirement is presumptively decertified. The Region may rebut the presumption under paragraph (4); absent successful rebuttal, Default Mutual Recognition under subsection (jj)(3) applies.

(3) **Decertification Process.** Decertification under paragraph (2) does not require an ARB proceeding to initiate. The ARB shall issue a formal Decertification Notice within seven (7) days of data publication showing threshold exceedance. The worker or employer may proceed under Default Mutual Recognition upon issuance of the Decertification Notice. A Region seeking to restore a requirement decertified under this paragraph shall petition the Allocation Review Board within sixty (60) days of decertification. The ARB shall rule within ninety (90) days. Pending the ARB's ruling, the decertified requirement is unenforceable and Default Mutual Recognition applies. No interim injunctive relief preserving the decertified requirement shall issue. If the ARB does not rule within ninety (90) days, decertification is confirmed. If a Region refuses to honor decertification, affected workers may obtain Federal Practice Credentials under subsection (u) as a fallback enforcement mechanism.

(4) **Rebuttal.** A Region may rebut the presumption of invalidity under paragraph (1) or the presumption of decertification under paragraph (2) by demonstrating, by clear and convincing evidence, that:

- (A) the regulation addresses a genuine safety risk specific to Regional conditions — including geography, climate, population density, or infrastructure — that is not present in Regions with lower costs or times; AND
- (B) no less restrictive alternative would adequately address the identified risk.

(5) **Scope.** This subsection applies to regulations that affect the ability of a worker credentialed in one Region to practice or conduct business in another Region, including regulations imposed by any governmental entity within a Region (States, counties, municipalities, and special districts) regardless of whether such entities exercise delegated Regional authority or independent authority. It does not apply to generally applicable health and safety regulations that apply equally to in-Region and out-of-Region workers without disparate impact on cross-regional mobility, nor to tax or fiscal provisions governed by Article X. A regulation that is facially applicable to all workers but that, due to Region-specific compliance infrastructure, creates a materially longer compliance timeline or materially higher compliance cost for out-of-Region workers than for in-Region workers is not "generally applicable without disparate impact" and is subject to this subsection. The characterization of a requirement as "financial regulation," "insurance regulation," or any other regulatory category does not exempt it from this subsection if it has the practical effect of increasing the cost or time of market entry for an out-of-Region credentialed professional.

(6) **Interaction with Credential Framework.** The Market Entry Disparity Standard supplements the credential-specific protections of subsections (g)-(u) and the Divergence Declaration framework of subsection (jj). Where a non-credential regulation exceeds the disparity threshold and is decertified under this subsection, the Region may not reimpose an equivalent barrier through a supplementary credential requirement.

(7) **Cumulative Total-Cost Cap.** The total cost and time of market entry — including all credential requirements, supplementary requirements subject to Divergence Declarations under subsection (jj), and non-credential regulatory requirements subject to this subsection — for any occupation in any Region may not exceed the RPPP-adjusted National Median by more than thirty percent (30%). If the total exceeds this threshold, the Region must reduce its requirements or submit a comprehensive justification under paragraph (4) for the total barrier, not for each component individually.

(8) **Private Right of Action.** A worker or employer harmed by enforcement of a requirement that is presumptively invalid under paragraph (1), decertified under paragraphs (2)-(3), or that exceeds the cumulative cap of paragraph (7) may bring suit for injunctive relief, compensatory damages, and attorney fees. Enforcement of a decertified or presumptively invalid requirement constitutes a per se violation of this Section and is subject to the remedies of subsection (t).

#### Coordinated Barrier Prohibition

(ll) **Prohibition on Coordinated Regulatory Barriers.**

(1) **Presumption of Coordination.** If three (3) or more Regions adopt regulatory requirements achieving substantially the same regulatory effect — imposing substantially the same cost and time burdens and addressing the same occupational scope, regardless of differences in textual formulation, numbering, or organization — affecting the same occupation within any twenty-four (24) month period, there is a rebuttable presumption that the requirements constitute a coordinated regulatory barrier to labor mobility. The same presumption applies if two (2) or more Regions representing, in the aggregate, more than thirty percent (30%) of the national population adopt such requirements within the same period.

(2) **Consequences of Coordination Finding.** Upon a finding of coordinated barrier by the Allocation Review Board:

- (A) each Region must independently justify its requirement under subsection (kk)(4) without reference to other Regions' adoption of the same or similar requirements;
- (B) "other Regions have the same requirement" does not constitute valid justification, whether characterized as industry standard, national norm, or consensus best practice — nor does adoption of a model regulation drafted by a non-governmental organization constitute independent justification absent Region-specific evidence;
- (C) the Board shall impose enhanced scrutiny on future regulatory proposals from participating Regions for the same occupation for a period of five (5) years; enhanced scrutiny requires: (i) the Region to demonstrate independent ESS-standard justification before adoption, not merely before enforcement; (ii) ARB pre-approval within sixty (60) days (rather than the standard ninety (90) days under subsection (k)); and (iii) any new regulatory requirement affecting the same occupation adopted within twelve (12) months of a similar requirement by any other Region subject to enhanced scrutiny is presumptively a coordinated barrier.

(3) **Safe Harbor for Independent Adoption.** This subsection does not prohibit Regions from adopting genuinely similar requirements for independent, evidence-based reasons. A Region may rebut the presumption of coordination by demonstrating, with contemporaneous documentation, that:

- (A) the requirement was developed through an independent regulatory process without reference to or coordination with other Regions' regulatory actions;
- (B) the requirement is supported by Region-specific evidence of the safety or regulatory need; and
- (C) the timing of adoption is explained by independent factors — such as response to a Region-specific incident, response to a nationally documented safety incident, a federal safety directive or advisory, a scientific consensus as documented by a federal agency or nationally recognized professional body, a scheduled regulatory review cycle, or compliance with a federal statute or regulation — rather than by coordination with other Regions.

(4) **Inter-Regional Regulatory Communication.** Regions are not prohibited from sharing information about regulatory approaches or participating in voluntary best-practice discussions. Coordination becomes prohibited only when it produces functionally equivalent requirements designed or functioning as labor mobility barriers.

#### Annual Benchmark Publication

(mm) **Annual Benchmark Publication and Data Transparency.**

(1) **Annual Publication.** By January 31 of each year, the Allocation Review Board shall publish:

- (A) the RPPP-adjusted National Median cost and time of market entry for the one hundred (100) occupations with the highest cross-regional mobility and the fifty (50) occupations with the largest disparity in cost or time of market entry across Regions (regardless of current mobility levels), as determined by IFC labor mobility and labor market data;
- (B) the Validated National Floor — the lowest cost and time among Regions whose standards meet the ESS standard — for all Critical Shortage occupations designated by the Independent Fiscal Council;
- (C) each Region's cost and time data for each listed occupation, including a breakdown of credential requirements, non-credential regulatory requirements, and total cost and time, with RPPP adjustment factors;
- (D) identification of any Regions exceeding the twenty percent (20%) RPPP-adjusted disparity threshold under subsection (kk)(1) for any listed occupation; and
- (E) if the RPPP-adjusted National Median for any listed occupation has increased by more than the Consumer Price Index plus three percentage points in the prior year, a flag requiring ARB investigation of whether the increase reflects genuine cost changes or strategic inflation.

(2) **Mid-Year Challenge.** A worker, employer, or the ARB acting on its own initiative may file a mid-year challenge asserting that a Region's market-entry costs for a listed occupation exceed the disparity threshold based on data published since the most recent annual publication. The ARB shall rule on the challenge within sixty (60) days. If the challenge is sustained, subsection (kk) applies immediately without waiting for the next annual publication cycle.

(3) **Data Submission.** Each Region shall submit accurate, complete processing time and cost data to the Board within thirty (30) days of request. Data shall include all costs and time requirements imposed by the Region, its agencies, and sub-Regional entities exercising regulatory authority over the occupation. All costs that a reasonable out-of-Region professional would necessarily incur to achieve market entry — including costs imposed by entities whose services are practically necessary to obtain licensure, regardless of whether the services are formally required by law — shall be included in reported costs.

(4) **Graduated Data Non-Compliance Escalation.** If a Region fails to provide accurate data within thirty (30) days:

- (A) **First failure**: the Board shall apply the Validated National Floor as the benchmark for all that Region's challenged occupations — effectively treating the Region as having the most permissive standard; this presumption continues until the Region achieves data compliance;
- (B) **Second failure within five (5) years**: the Region additionally loses the benefit of the rebuttal mechanism under subsection (kk)(4) for all occupations for which data is missing — meaning any presumptively invalid requirement is automatically decertified rather than rebuttable;
- (C) **Third failure within five (5) years**: the Board shall issue a ninety (90) day cure notice; if the Region achieves data compliance within ninety (90) days, no further escalation occurs; if the Region fails to cure within ninety (90) days, the Board shall revoke Divergence Declarations for occupations in which the data deficiency exists; system-wide revocation of all Divergence Declarations occurs only upon a Board finding that the data non-compliance is willful and systematic, not merely the result of administrative failure; and
- (D) revocation under subparagraph (C) continues until data compliance is restored and the Region resubmits affected Divergence Declarations under subsection (jj)(2).

(5) **Data Integrity.** Data manipulation for purposes of this subsection — including systematic underreporting of costs, exclusion of indirect costs imposed by sub-Regional entities, or misclassification of regulatory requirements — is subject to the Adversarial Data Audit and penalty provisions applicable to the Independent Statistical Trust under Article X-RF, Section 17. The ARB shall conduct random verification audits of at least two (2) Regions per year, including interviews with recent out-of-Region entrants to identify unreported costs.

(6) **Public Accessibility.** All data published under this subsection shall be freely accessible online in machine-readable format. The ARB shall maintain a searchable database enabling workers and employers to determine, for any listed occupation, the cost and time of market entry in each Region and whether any Region exceeds the disparity threshold.

## 6. Design Question Resolutions

*The following design questions were posed in v1 and have been resolved through four-source review (User, External Reviewer, R1 constitutional specialist, R2 adversarial stress-tester).*

1. **Divergence Declaration vs. existing framework (DQ-1)**: **Resolved — supplement with explicit subordination.** The Divergence Declaration layers legislative accountability, hard cost/time caps, and mandatory sunset on top of the existing ARB certification mechanism. Subsections (j)-(k) remain operative as components of the Divergence Declaration process but are explicitly subordinated — no supplementary requirement may be imposed through (j) alone. See (jj)(1).

2. **Bridge pathway caps (DQ-2)**: **Resolved — indexed ceiling with ARB extension.** Bridge pathway cost is indexed to one percent (1%) of Regional median annual wage (rather than a fixed FPU amount) to maintain real value and adjust for Regional cost-of-living. The 60-day clock explicitly includes wait time. The ARB may grant a single 30-day extension for High-Complexity occupations (capped at 10% of all occupations). See (jj)(2)(D).

3. **20% disparity threshold (DQ-3)**: **Resolved — 20% uniform threshold with RPPP adjustment and de minimis exception.** A uniform 20% threshold maintains constitutional simplicity; the RPPP adjustment prevents cost-of-living false positives; a 50-FPU de minimis exception prevents trivial-amount proceedings. A cumulative 30% total-cost cap (kk)(7) catches stacking of below-threshold barriers. See (kk)(1), (kk)(7).

4. **Critical Shortage designation (DQ-4)**: **Resolved — IFC with DOL consultation.** The IFC designates based on quantitative criteria, with mandatory consultation with the Department of Labor and relevant federal safety agencies. See (kk)(2).

5. **Anti-cartelization threshold (DQ-5)**: **Resolved — 3 Regions / 24 months with population-weighted alternative.** The 3-Region trigger is retained with an alternative trigger for 2+ Regions representing >30% of national population (addressing bilateral coordination by large Regions). Safe harbor expanded to cover federal standards, nationally documented safety incidents, and scientific consensus. See (ll)(1), (ll)(3)(C).

6. **Data concealment escalation (DQ-6)**: **Resolved — graduated escalation with cure period.** Three-step graduated escalation: (1) National Floor benchmark; (2) loss of rebuttal rights; (3) 90-day cure notice before occupation-specific Divergence Declaration revocation. System-wide revocation only upon finding of willful/systematic non-compliance. See (mm)(4).

7. **Interaction with Gap 65 (DQ-7)**: **Resolved — substantially addressed.** Gap 65's four-part proposal is largely adopted at §9(g)-(u). Residual elements (national credential floor standard, credential portability fund) are deferred to legislative action; IFC mobility reporting is addressed by (mm). Gap 65 status should be updated to "SUBSTANTIALLY RESOLVED" in the gap register.

## 8. Review History

**v1** (initial draft): Four-part framework (Divergence Declaration, Actuarial Disparity Standard, Coordinated Barrier Prohibition, Annual Benchmark Publication).

**v2** (current): Comprehensive revision incorporating findings from four-source review:

- **User**: Auto-decertification destabilizing (F1 HIGH); bridge caps too rigid (F2 MEDIUM); 20% may need tiering (F3); anti-cartelization may catch convergence (F4); IFC with DOL consultation (F5); Gap 65 substantially addressed (F6). DQ recommendations for all 7 questions.
- **External Reviewer**: Cost-of-living false positives — need RPPP adjustment (F1 CRITICAL); "Actuarial" misnomer — rename to "Market Entry Disparity" (F2 CRITICAL); bridge cost indexed to median wage (F3 HIGH); data latency — mid-year challenge (F4 MEDIUM); "related occupations" anti-splintering (F5 MEDIUM).
