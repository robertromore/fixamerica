## Corrected Constitutional Text

### Section 8. Defense Burden Equalization Framework

*Resolves Gap 58 — The Geographic Defense Penalty (Defense Burden Asymmetry). Ensures equitable cost-sharing for Regions bearing disproportionate defense burdens due to geographic exposure, while preserving Two-Key authorization and preventing both federal commandeering through Mutual Aid abuse and Regional infrastructure hostage-taking.*

#### Part 1 — Defense Burden Assessment

(a) **Annual Defense Burden Calculation.** The Department of Defense shall annually provide to the Independent Fiscal Council threat data and operational requirements for each Region, including:

- (i) International border miles requiring active monitoring;
- (ii) Coastline miles requiring maritime defense capability;
- (iii) Critical infrastructure of national significance located within the Region (ports, air defense installations, nuclear facilities, strategic reserves);
- (iv) **Threat Environment Assessment**, comprising:
    - (A) Geographic proximity to foreign military installations, naval bases, and staging areas;
    - (B) Assessed capabilities of proximate foreign forces, as published by the Director of National Intelligence. The DNI assessment shall be treated as advisory; the Allocation Review Board may reject a DNI assessment upon a finding, by clear and convincing evidence, that the assessment is clearly erroneous;
    - (C) Historical pattern of foreign reconnaissance, probing, or incursion *attempts*, as classified under a validated incident-classification standard jointly established by the Department of Defense and the Allocation Review Board, including deterred attempts and hostile intent indicators;
    - (D) **Hostile Intent and Mobilization**, comprising adversary force buildup, staging activity, and declared or assessed hostile intent directed at or proximate to the Region, regardless of whether such activity has resulted in kinetic incidents;
    - (E) Volume and risk profile of cross-border traffic (commercial, migratory, maritime);
    - (F) Presence of high-value targets attractive to foreign adversaries.

The Independent Fiscal Council shall, based on the threat data and operational requirements provided by the Department of Defense, calculate each Region's "Defense Burden Index" using a published fiscal methodology. The Department of Defense shall have no authority to make final fiscal determinations affecting inter-Regional transfers under this Section.

(b) **Deterrence Credit.** A Region demonstrating measurable improvement in deterrence effectiveness — as measured by reduced successful incursions relative to validated attempt volume, including hostile intent and mobilization indicators under subsection (a)(iv)(D) — shall receive a ten percent (10%) bonus to its Defense Burden Index for the following three (3) years. The Deterrence Credit shall not be reduced solely because an adversary increases force buildup in response to effective deterrence.

(c) **National Defense Baseline.** The calculation shall establish:

- (i) A "National Defense Baseline" — the minimum Regional Guard capacity required for national security coordination;
- (ii) "Excess Defense Burden" — costs above the Baseline attributable to geographic exposure;
- (iii) "Shared Benefit Infrastructure" — defense assets that provide protection beyond the host Region, as determined under subsection (n).

(d) **Methodology Transparency.** The calculation methodology shall be:

- (i) Published and subject to public comment;
- (ii) Reviewed by the Allocation Review Board for objectivity. Any Region may petition the Allocation Review Board to review Defense Burden Index calculations within sixty (60) days of publication. The Board shall defer to Independent Fiscal Council determinations on methodology absent clear error;
- (iii) Updated every five (5) years to reflect changing threat assessments.

---

#### Part 2 — Defense Burden Equalization Fund

(e) **Establishment of Fund.** There is hereby established a Defense Burden Equalization Fund ("DBEF") within the Treasury of the United States. Initial capitalization shall be provided from the federal Treasury for the first three (3) years following ratification. Beginning in year four (4), Regional contributions shall phase in, reaching full Regional funding by year five (5). The transition schedule shall be established by Congress in implementing legislation.

(f) **Contributions.** Each Region shall contribute to the DBEF based on:

- (i) **Base Contribution**: Equal per-Region share of forty percent (40%) of total Fund;
- (ii) **Capacity Contribution**: Proportional to Regional fiscal capacity (as calculated by the Independent Fiscal Council under Article X, Section 5) for remaining sixty percent (60%) of total Fund.

(g) **Disbursements.** The DBEF shall reimburse Regions for:

- (i) Excess Defense Burden costs, as certified by the Independent Fiscal Council;
- (ii) Shared Benefit Infrastructure maintenance and operation;
- (iii) Surge capacity costs during national security emergencies affecting the Region disproportionately.

(h) **Disbursement Limits.**

- (i) No Region shall receive disbursements exceeding one hundred fifty percent (150%) of its total contributions over any five-year period, absent a declared national emergency;
- (ii) Disbursements shall not fund Regional Guard activities unrelated to national defense or interstate mutual aid;
- (iii) **Emergency Override.** Upon a declaration of national emergency by the President and approval by a majority vote of both chambers of Congress, the one hundred fifty percent cap under clause (i) may be suspended for the duration of the declared emergency plus one (1) fiscal year.

---

#### Part 3 — Minimum Readiness Standards with Two-Key Compliant Mutual Aid

(i) **National Minimum Readiness.** Each Regional Guard, regardless of geographic exposure, shall maintain:

- (i) Personnel levels sufficient to respond to a Category 3 disaster within the Region;
- (ii) Interoperability certification with federal forces and all adjacent Regional Guards;
- (iii) Annual participation in at least one multi-Regional defense exercise.

(j) **Standing Defense Mutual Aid Compact.** All Regions are deemed parties to a standing Defense Mutual Aid Compact for defense-related emergencies only. Disaster relief and non-defense mutual aid remain subject to the limitations of Section 6(b) of this Article. The Compact provides:

- (i) **Pre-Authorized Readiness.** Upon declaration of a qualifying defense emergency by any Region or the federal government, Guard units in other Regions shall be placed on deployment-ready status within twenty-four (24) hours;

- (ii) **Governor Authorization Required.** Actual deployment of Guard units requires affirmative authorization by the Governor of the assisting Region. This requirement may not be waived, suspended, or deemed satisfied by federal declaration;

- (iii) **Rebuttable Presumption of Authorization.** A Governor's failure to authorize deployment within seventy-two (72) hours of request creates a rebuttable presumption of bad faith, unless the Governor certifies one of the following:
    - (A) **Superior Domestic Need**: The assisting Region faces an emergency of equal or greater severity requiring retention of Guard capacity;
    - (B) **Inadequate Remaining Capacity**: Deployment would reduce the Region's Guard below Minimum Readiness Standards;
    - (C) **Pretextual Request**: The Governor has substantial evidence that the defense emergency declaration is pretextual or that deployment would be used for purposes other than the declared defense emergency.

- (iv) **ARB Review of Refusal.** If a Governor refuses deployment under clause (iii)(C), the Allocation Review Board shall review the refusal within seven (7) days:
    - (A) If the Board finds the refusal unjustified, the Governor shall authorize deployment within forty-eight (48) hours;
    - (B) The refusing Region shall bear one hundred percent (100%) of costs for any alternative assistance required;
    - (C) Repeated unjustified refusals (three within five years) shall suspend the Region's eligibility to receive Defense Mutual Aid.

- (v) **Anti-Commandeering Safeguard.** Deployment under this Compact:
    - (A) Shall not exceed thirty (30) days without Congressional certification of a "Sustained Regional Defense Emergency." Extensions beyond thirty (30) days and up to ninety (90) days require such certification. No deployment under this Compact shall exceed ninety (90) days total;
    - (B) Shall not be used for law enforcement against citizens of the assisting Region;
    - (C) Shall terminate immediately upon Governor recall, subject to seventy-two (72) hour orderly withdrawal period;
    - (D) Shall not constitute grounds for federal assumption of command over remaining assisting-Region Guard units;
    - (E) Shall not constitute a "permanent unified command," "standing joint staff," or military confederation prohibited by Section 6(a) of this Article.

(k) **Cost-Sharing for Extended Deployments.** For deployments exceeding fourteen (14) days:

- (i) The requesting Region shall bear sixty percent (60%) of costs;
- (ii) The DBEF shall bear forty percent (40%) of costs;
- (iii) No costs shall be borne by the assisting Region.

(l) **Free Rider Penalty.** A Region that fails to meet Minimum Readiness Standards for two consecutive years:

- (i) Shall be ineligible to receive Defense Mutual Aid until standards are met;
- (ii) Shall have its DBEF disbursements suspended;
- (iii) Shall bear one hundred percent (100%) of costs for any federal assistance required due to its underinvestment.

Enforcement of Minimum Readiness Standards under this subsection constitutes conditions on participation in a mutual defense compact, not conditional spending within the meaning of Article X, Section 4. The Non-Coercion Standard of Article X, Section 4 does not apply to DBEF contribution requirements or disbursement conditions, which are germane to the administration of the defense equalization program within the meaning of Article X, Section 4(i)(2).

(m) **Readiness Certification.** The Allocation Review Board shall annually certify each Region's compliance with Minimum Readiness Standards based on Department of Defense assessment. Annual Readiness Certification is a ministerial administrative function and does not count against the filing limits of Article II, Section 4-A.

#### Part 4 — Shared Benefit Infrastructure with Triple-Lock Protection

(n) **Designation Process.** Infrastructure may be designated as "Shared Benefit Infrastructure" only through the following procedure:

- (i) **Presidential Nomination.** The President, upon recommendation of the Secretary of Defense, may nominate infrastructure for Shared Benefit designation by submitting to the Allocation Review Board:
    - (A) A detailed justification addressing each criterion in clause (ii);
    - (B) An assessment of the designation's impact on the host Region;
    - (C) A proposed cost-sharing arrangement.

- (ii) **ARB Certification Required.** The Allocation Review Board shall certify the designation only if it finds, by clear and convincing evidence, that:
    - (A) For national-scope assets — including intercontinental ballistic missile systems, early warning radar, satellite ground stations, and strategic command infrastructure — the asset provides defense capability extending to the nation as a whole. National-scope assets are presumptively Shared Benefit Infrastructure, subject to rebuttal by the host Region;
    - (B) For regional-scope assets, the asset provides defense capability extending beyond the host Region to at least two (2) geographically adjacent Regions, or to Regions that demonstrate specific, concrete defense benefit from the asset;
    - (C) The asset is essential to national security coordination and cannot be replicated at reasonable cost;
    - (D) Denial of access to the asset would materially impair defense of other Regions;
    - (E) The designation is not pretextual — i.e., not primarily intended to gain federal influence over the host Region's non-defense activities.

- (iii) **Host Region Challenge.** The host Region may challenge a proposed designation in the National Constitutional Court within thirty (30) days of ARB certification:
    - (A) The Court shall apply de novo review to the Board's findings;
    - (B) Designation shall not take effect until the Court rules or the challenge period expires;
    - (C) If the Court finds the designation pretextual, it shall be void and the President may not re-nominate the same asset for five (5) years.

- (iv) **Sunset and Review.** All Shared Benefit designations:
    - (A) Shall expire after ten (10) years unless renewed through the same process;
    - (B) May be challenged by the host Region every five (5) years on grounds of changed circumstances;
    - (C) Shall terminate automatically if the asset no longer meets the criteria in clause (ii).

Shared Benefit Infrastructure designation challenges under clause (iii) and mutual aid refusal reviews under subsection (j)(iv) are disputes that count against the filing limits of Article II, Section 4-A.

(o) **Cost Allocation for Shared Benefit Infrastructure.**

- (i) Construction costs: Seventy percent (70%) DBEF, thirty percent (30%) host Region;
- (ii) Operating costs: Sixty percent (60%) DBEF, forty percent (40%) host Region;
- (iii) Host Region retains operational control subject to emergency access provisions.

(p) **Access Guarantee with Triple-Lock Protection.**

- (i) A Region hosting Shared Benefit Infrastructure shall not deny access to federal forces or other Regional Guards during declared emergencies affecting the infrastructure's defense function;

- (ii) Access denial for non-emergency purposes, or conditioning access on unrelated concessions, shall be grounds for:
    - (A) Suspension of DBEF disbursements to the host Region;
    - (B) Civil penalties not exceeding two hundred percent (200%) of the annual operating cost share;

- (iii) **Federal Operational Assumption requires Triple Lock:**
    - (A) Allocation Review Board finding of systematic access denial; AND
    - (B) National Constitutional Court order; AND
    - (C) Congressional authorization by majority vote;

- (iv) Federal assumption of operational control:
    - (A) Shall be limited to the specific infrastructure, not broader Regional Guard or civil assets;
    - (B) Shall terminate upon restoration of access compliance;
    - (C) Shall not authorize federal personnel to access non-defense data or systems co-located with the infrastructure.

#### Part 5 — Anti-Gaming Provisions

(q) **Prohibited Burden Inflation.** A Region shall not:

- (i) Artificially inflate Defense Burden calculations through unnecessary infrastructure or personnel;
- (ii) Classify non-defense activities as defense-related to claim DBEF reimbursement;
- (iii) Manipulate incident reporting to increase historical frequency calculations;
- (iv) Acquire capabilities or incur costs that exceed the National Minimum Readiness Standards established under subsection (i) by more than twenty percent (20%) without prior fiscal certification by the Independent Fiscal Council and operational certification by the Allocation Review Board. Costs exceeding this threshold without prior certification are ineligible for DBEF reimbursement.

(r) **Audit Authority.** The Government Accountability Office shall:

- (i) Conduct biennial audits of DBEF contributions and disbursements;
- (ii) Review Defense Burden calculations for accuracy;
- (iii) Report findings to Congress and the Allocation Review Board.

(s) **Penalty for Fraud.** A Region found to have engaged in Prohibited Burden Inflation:

- (i) Shall repay all excess disbursements plus twenty-five percent (25%) penalty;
- (ii) Shall be subject to enhanced scrutiny for five (5) years;
- (iii) Officials responsible shall be referred for prosecution under federal fraud statutes.

---

#### Part 6 — Coordination and Savings

(t) **National Necessity Savings Clause.** Nothing in this Section shall be construed to limit federal eminent domain authority under Article II, Section 17 (National Necessity Easement). Where a certified National Necessity project requires access to infrastructure designated as Shared Benefit under subsection (n), the host Region shall provide access upon request, subject to the accommodation requirements of Article II, Section 17(d).

(u) **Independent Fiscal Council Methodology.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall publish, annually, the methodology for calculating Excess Defense Burden, DBEF contribution schedules, and disbursement certifications. Any Region may petition the Council to review Defense Burden Index calculations within sixty (60) days of publication. The Allocation Review Board shall defer to Independent Fiscal Council determinations on methodology absent clear error.
