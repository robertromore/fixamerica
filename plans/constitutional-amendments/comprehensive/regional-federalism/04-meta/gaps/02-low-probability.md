# Category II: High-Risk but Low-Probability Scenarios

> These gaps describe catastrophic failure modes that the system cannot fully prevent, but which require extraordinary circumstances to materialize.

## Gap 3 — Coordinated Capture Across All Levels

**Description:**
If a single authoritarian coalition simultaneously captures:

- federal executive,
- Congress,
- sufficient regional governments,
- courts,
- and senior security leadership,

institutional redundancy can be overwhelmed.

**Risk:**
Power consolidation becomes possible despite safeguards.

**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED.** Mitigated by fragmentation and dual legitimacy requirements; not eliminable. Three-tier power distribution (Article II, Section 1(e) in 02-powers-and-rights.md), dual legitimacy amendment ratification (Article XIII, Section 6 in 05-safeguards.md), coordinated threat response provisions including cross-institutional alert system, judicial surge capacity, hardened communications, and multi-vector stress testing (Article XII, Section 4 in 05-safeguards.md), and two-key authorization for domestic military deployment (Article XI, Section 3 in military-civilian-control.md; Article XI-RF in 10-armed-forces.md). Verified 2026-01-31.

See [Authoritarian Consolidation Scenario](../../03-analysis/05-authoritarian-scenario.md) for detailed analysis of this failure mode.

**Severity:** High | **Mitigability:** Medium | **Resolved:** 2026-01-31

## Gap 4 — Sustained, Mass Political Violence

**Description:**
Large-scale, persistent violence can:

- overwhelm de-escalation mechanisms,
- justify emergency powers,
- force centralization by necessity.

**Risk:**
Emergency normalization despite safeguards.

**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED.** Mitigated by emergency powers framework (Article XVII) with multi-key authorization, sunset enforcement, and Regional Guard accountability provisions; not eliminable by constitutional design alone. Article XVII (single-topic/emergency-powers-reform.md) establishes categorized emergencies with enumerated powers, strict automatic expiration time limits, congressional oversight, independent judicial review, restoration mandate, and explicit prohibition on emergency expansion of power (Section 10). Two-key authorization for domestic deployment (Article XI, Section 3 in military-civilian-control.md). Regional Guard accountability under Regional Governor command with federalization restrictions (Article XI-RF in 10-armed-forces.md). Regional emergency authority with anti-ratcheting, cooling-off periods, and cumulative duration tracking (Article XVII-RF in 11-emergency-powers.md). Verified 2026-01-31.

See [Authoritarian Consolidation Scenario](../../03-analysis/05-authoritarian-scenario.md) for analysis of violence-driven consolidation pathways.

**Severity:** High | **Mitigability:** Low | **Resolved:** 2026-01-31
