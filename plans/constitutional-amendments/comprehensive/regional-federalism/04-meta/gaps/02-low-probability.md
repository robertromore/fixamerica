# Category II: High-Risk but Low-Probability Scenarios

> These gaps describe catastrophic failure modes that the system cannot fully prevent, but which require extraordinary circumstances to materialize.

### Gap 3 — Coordinated Capture Across All Levels

**Description:**
If a single authoritarian coalition simultaneously captures:

- federal executive,
- Congress,
- sufficient regional governments,
- courts,
- and senior security leadership,

institutional redundancy can be overwhelmed.

**Risk:**
Power consolidation becomes possible despite safeguards.

**Status:**
Mitigated by fragmentation and dual legitimacy requirements; not eliminable.

See [Authoritarian Consolidation Scenario](../../03-analysis/05-authoritarian-scenario.md) for detailed analysis of this failure mode.

**Severity:** Critical | **Mitigability:** Medium

### Gap 4 — Sustained, Mass Political Violence

**Description:**
Large-scale, persistent violence can:

- overwhelm de-escalation mechanisms,
- justify emergency powers,
- force centralization by necessity.

**Risk:**
Emergency normalization despite safeguards.

**Status:**
Unpreventable by constitutional design alone.

See [Authoritarian Consolidation Scenario](../../03-analysis/05-authoritarian-scenario.md) for analysis of violence-driven consolidation pathways.

**Severity:** Critical | **Mitigability:** Low
