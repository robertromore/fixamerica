# Briefing: Gap 143 — The "Utility Siege" of Federal Assets

## 1. The Problem

**Gap 143** identifies a structural vulnerability in federal facility protection during resource scarcity. Article II-RF, Section 10 comprehensively protects Vital Federal Operations from utility denial, infrastructure neglect, and regulatory harassment under normal conditions. However, during a declared utility emergency — drought, grid stress, fuel shortage — some resource rationing is necessary, and Section 10's protections do not establish a priority level for federal facilities relative to other users. A Region could declare a "Regional Utility Emergency" under Article XVII-RF and "deprioritize" federal installations through "administrative load management," effectively sieging federal property while claiming legitimate emergency resource allocation.

### The Attack Vectors

| Vector | Mechanism | Effect |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **"Load Management" Siege** | Region declares drought emergency; military base "deprioritized" for water allocation below hospitals and schools but above commercial users | Base cannot sustain operations; federal government faces capitulation or confrontation |
| **"Infrastructure Upgrade" Blockade** | Region claims grid capacity insufficient for federal facility expansion; refuses capacity upgrade; existing connection "fails" due to "deferred maintenance" during peak demand emergency | Federal installation isolated from power grid during emergency; operations impossible |
| **"Waste Management" Squeeze** | Region terminates waste collection contracts with federal facilities; claims "capacity constraints" during declared waste-management emergency | Federal property drowns in waste; health violations force operational curtailment |
| **Quality Degradation** | Region provides nominal utility quantity at emergency-services level but degrades quality — voltage fluctuations, contaminated water, intermittent telecom — rendering service operationally useless | Federal facility technically "receives" service but cannot operate; Region claims compliance |
| **Circuit Topology Trap** | Region places federal facility on shared distribution circuit with low-priority users, then sheds entire circuit during emergency claiming technical infeasibility of selective priority | Federal facility loses power despite priority status; Region blames grid topology |

### Why Existing Protections Are Insufficient

| Protection | What It Covers | What It Misses |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Art II-RF §10(b)(1) (Minimum Operating Guarantee) | Regions may not "deny, restrict, or condition" utility services | Prohibition operates in normal conditions; during genuine emergency, some rationing is necessary — Region argues "deprioritization" is emergency management, not restriction |
| Art II-RF §10(f) (Anti-Hostage Provision) | Prohibits using regulatory burdens as leverage in "unrelated disputes" | During a genuine utility emergency, the deprioritization is facially related to resource management, not an "unrelated" dispute |
| Art II-RF §10(g) (Emergency Federal Authority) | President may assume temporary operational control of Regional infrastructure | Nuclear option — escalates to federal takeover of Regional infrastructure; no intermediate self-provision step |
| Art II-RF §10(i)(3) (Infrastructure Maintenance) | Regions must maintain infrastructure at parity | Addresses neglect of existing infrastructure, not allocation of scarce resources during emergency |
| Art II-RF §10(l)(3) (Water Allocation) | Water decisions may not "materially impair" operations; prior appropriation treatment | Addresses individual water disputes through certification/arbitration; does not establish general priority during system-wide emergency |
| Art II-RF §8 (National Security Override) | Suspends Regional regulations impeding defense operations | Addresses regulatory impediments, not utility allocation decisions during emergency |

### The Critical Interaction: Emergency Declarations as Cover

The key vulnerability is the intersection of Article XVII-RF emergency powers and Section 10's utility protections. Section 10(b)(1) prohibits utility denial, but a Region invoking emergency powers argues it is not "denying" service — it is managing genuinely scarce resources under emergency authority. The federal facility receives *some* water, *some* electricity — just not enough to operate effectively. The Region claims this is no different from reducing supply to hospitals during a water emergency. Without an explicit priority level, the federal facility has no constitutional basis to demand allocation above other critical users.

## 2. Existing Coverage Analysis

### What Exists

- **Art II-RF §10(a)-(b)**: Defines Vital Federal Operations; prohibits utility denial, restriction, or conditioning under normal conditions
- **Art II-RF §10(c)-(e)**: Certification of Vital Operations Necessity with 90-day suspension and negotiation/arbitration process — but designed for regulatory interference, not resource allocation during emergency
- **Art II-RF §10(f)**: Anti-hostage provision — but facially inapplicable when deprioritization is tied to genuine emergency
- **Art II-RF §10(g)**: Emergency federal authority — Presidential takeover of Regional infrastructure; too escalatory for gray-area utility allocation disputes
- **Art II-RF §10(i)**: Physical access and infrastructure maintenance at parity — addresses infrastructure neglect, not scarcity allocation
- **Art II-RF §10(j)**: Operational-effect standard — presumptive voiding of regulations materially impairing operations; designed for regulatory context, not emergency resource allocation
- **Art II-RF §10(l)**: Utility pricing (lowest institutional rate); water allocation (prior appropriation treatment) — addresses individual disputes, not system-wide emergency allocation
- **Art II-RF §10(m)**: Personal liability (civil), targeted fund suspension, de-escalation relation — enforcement mechanisms without priority-setting authority
- **Art II-RF §8**: National Security Operations Override — regulatory suspension for defense operations; does not address utility allocation

### What Does Not Exist

- No explicit priority level for federal facilities during resource scarcity or declared emergencies
- No intermediate self-provision authority between negotiation (§10(d)) and Presidential infrastructure takeover (§10(g))
- No "Utility Siege" finding mechanism for pattern abuse of emergency declarations to deprioritize federal facilities
- No suspension of Regional emergency allocation authority upon finding of abuse
- No explicit prohibition on using emergency declarations as cover for federal facility deprioritization
- No protection against quality degradation (as distinct from quantity reduction) during emergency
- No duration limit on emergency rationing affecting federal facilities
- No circuit integrity protection for shared distribution infrastructure

## 4. Proposed Approach: Emergency Utility Priority and Self-Provision

Three new subsections — **§10(n)-(p)** — added to the existing Vital Federal Operations Protection section, establishing emergency utility priority, federal self-provision authority as an intermediate step, and a Utility Siege finding mechanism with category-specific emergency-power suspension.

### Design Principles

1. **Build on existing §10 framework**: Section 10 already covers the normal-conditions case comprehensively. The amendment addresses only the emergency/scarcity gap.
2. **Explicit priority, not absolute immunity**: Federal facilities receive priority equal to emergency services (hospitals, fire stations) — not absolute immunity from rationing. During genuine system-wide emergencies, federal facilities share the burden proportionally with other critical infrastructure. Priority level defined by reference to the Region's own emergency allocation plan.
3. **Quality and quantity parity**: Priority covers both the volume and the quality of service — voltage stability, water quality, signal integrity — not merely nominal delivery.
4. **Circuit integrity**: Where selective load-shedding is technically infeasible on a shared distribution circuit, the entire circuit receives the priority level of the protected facility, preventing topology-based gaming.
5. **Intermediate self-provision step**: Between negotiation (§10(d)) and Presidential takeover (§10(g)), federal agencies may establish independent utility connections — reducing dependency without escalating to infrastructure seizure.
6. **Impracticability exceptions**: Genuine system-critical events (imminent grid collapse, cascading failure) permit temporary emergency shedding with rapid restoration and mandatory incident reporting.
7. **Duration limits**: Emergency rationing affecting federal facilities is capped at thirty days without ARB recertification, preventing indefinite emergency declarations.
8. **Emergency declaration gaming prevention**: The Utility Siege finding mechanism specifically addresses abuse of Article XVII-RF emergency declarations to create cover for federal facility deprioritization, including manufactured emergencies through deliberate infrastructure neglect.
9. **Category-specific enforcement**: Emergency-power suspension applies to the specific utility category affected, not all utility categories, maintaining proportionality.
10. **Escalating consequences**: First instance triggers priority restoration and cost recovery; pattern abuse triggers category-specific emergency-power suspension and interim ARB oversight.

## 5. Proposed Constitutional Text

### Art II-RF §10(n)-(p). Emergency Utility Priority and Self-Provision

*Resolves Gap 143 — The "Utility Siege" of Federal Assets. These subsections prevent Regions from weaponizing declared emergencies to deprioritize federal facilities through "administrative load management" by establishing explicit emergency utility priority, intermediate self-provision authority, and a Utility Siege finding mechanism with category-specific emergency-power suspension.*

Add new subsections (n), (o), and (p) to Section 10:

(n) **Emergency Utility Priority.**

(1) During any declared emergency under Article XVII-RF, resource scarcity event, or utility rationing program — however denominated — facilities protected under this section and Section 8 shall receive utility services (water, electricity, natural gas, telecommunications, and waste management) at a priority level no lower than the highest priority assigned to any Regional emergency service in the Region's emergency allocation plan, including hospitals, emergency medical facilities, fire stations, and law enforcement facilities. If the Region has not established a written emergency allocation plan with defined priority levels, federal facilities shall receive priority equal to the highest-priority user category. This priority applies regardless of whether the emergency is declared by the Region, a local government, or a utility provider. Priority encompasses both the quantity and quality of service — including voltage stability, water quality, signal integrity, and waste collection frequency — not merely nominal delivery. Where a protected facility shares a distribution circuit, feeder, or pipeline segment with non-priority users and selective load-shedding or service reduction is technically infeasible, the entire shared infrastructure segment shall be accorded the priority level of the protected facility.

(2) A Region may reduce utility services to federal facilities during a genuine emergency only if: (A) the same proportional reduction — in both quantity and quality of service — is simultaneously applied to all users at or above the emergency-services priority level; (B) the reduction is the minimum necessary to address the emergency; (C) the Region has provided the affected federal agency with written notice of the emergency and the proposed allocation plan at least forty-eight (48) hours before implementation, or as soon as practicable if the emergency precludes advance notice — in which case the Region shall provide written notice within twelve (12) hours of implementation; and (D) notwithstanding the foregoing, if a utility provider certifies in writing that maintaining federal facility priority would cause imminent grid collapse, cascading system failure, or loss of life-safety systems, the provider may implement immediate load-shedding or service reduction affecting federal facilities for the minimum duration necessary to prevent system failure — the provider shall restore priority service within four (4) hours and submit an incident report to the ARB within twenty-four (24) hours documenting the technical justification for the emergency action. Any allocation plan that reduces federal facility service below the level provided to Regional emergency services — whether in quantity, quality, or reliability — is presumptively a violation of this subsection.

(3) The prohibition on deprioritization under this subsection applies to all utility providers operating within the Region, whether public, private, cooperative, or municipal. A Region may not circumvent this subsection by delegating allocation authority to a private utility provider, special district, or emergency management authority. Utility allocation decisions made by any entity pursuant to, in response to, or in coordination with Regional emergency orders, allocation directives, or regulatory guidance are attributable to the Region for purposes of this section.

(4) Upon written notification by the head of the affected federal agency that a federal facility is receiving utility service below the emergency-services priority level, the Region shall restore priority within twenty-four (24) hours, or as soon as technically practicable if physical infrastructure damage or system-wide capacity constraints make restoration within twenty-four hours infeasible — in which case the Region shall provide the federal agency and the ARB with a written explanation of the impediment and a timeline for restoration not to exceed seventy-two (72) hours. Failure to restore priority within the applicable period constitutes a violation of subsection (b)(1) and triggers the enforcement mechanisms of subsection (m). The federal agency may simultaneously invoke the certification process of subsection (c), the self-provision authority of subsection (o), and the interim ARB order mechanism of subsection (p)(2)(F).

(5) No emergency rationing program affecting facilities protected under this section shall continue for more than thirty (30) days without recertification by the ARB that the underlying emergency conditions persist and that the rationing remains the minimum necessary to address the emergency. The Region bears the burden of demonstrating continued necessity. If the ARB does not recertify within five (5) days of the thirty-day expiration, the rationing program as applied to federal facilities is automatically suspended until recertification.

(o) **Federal Self-Provision Authority.**

(1) When the ARB finds that a Region has violated subsection (n), or when the certification and arbitration process of subsections (c) through (e) has not produced adequate accommodation within the ninety (90) day suspension period, federal agencies may establish independent utility infrastructure for facilities protected under this section and Section 8, including: (A) independent water supply (wells, desalination, storage) on federal property; (B) independent power generation (solar, wind, natural gas, nuclear) on federal property, subject to paragraph (2); (C) independent waste management on federal property; (D) direct utility contracts with providers located outside the obstructing Region, including construction of transmission, pipeline, or transportation infrastructure connecting federal property to out-of-Region providers; and (E) telecommunications infrastructure including independent fiber, microwave, and satellite connections, with rights-of-way access for connecting infrastructure without Regional franchise fees or carrier-selection restrictions.

(2) Federal self-provision infrastructure may be constructed on federal property without Regional permitting, zoning, or environmental review, subject to the following: (A) nuclear power generation on federal property shall comply with all applicable Nuclear Regulatory Commission safety standards, and the exemption from Regional permitting does not extend to NRC licensing requirements; (B) water self-provision infrastructure (wells, desalination) on federal property is exempt from Regional water withdrawal permits, discharge permits, and thermal discharge standards that would otherwise prevent or materially delay self-provision, but shall comply with generally applicable federal water quality and environmental standards; and (C) all self-provision infrastructure shall comply with generally applicable federal safety standards. Construction on non-federal land (including easements and rights-of-way) is subject to the National Necessity Easement provisions of Section 17.

(3) The costs of federal self-provision infrastructure shall be recovered from the obstructing Region's equalization transfers under the cost recovery procedures of Section 4(n), including the fifteen percent (15%) administrative surcharge. Cost recovery under this paragraph is in addition to, not in lieu of, any other enforcement consequences under this section.

(4) Self-provision authority under this subsection is an intermediate measure. It does not preclude the President from invoking the emergency authority of subsection (g) if self-provision is insufficient to maintain operations, nor does it require exhaustion of self-provision before invoking subsection (g).

(p) **Utility Siege Finding.**

(1) The ARB may find that a Region is conducting a "Utility Siege" against federal property if: (A) the Region has declared an emergency under Article XVII-RF or invoked utility rationing authority, and has deprioritized federal facilities below the emergency-services priority level established in subsection (n), whether through reduction in quantity, quality, or reliability of service; (B) the Region has failed to maintain or has deliberately degraded utility infrastructure serving federal facilities during a declared emergency, resulting in service levels below those provided to comparable non-federal users — including where the Region has manufactured or prolonged an emergency through deliberate deferral of infrastructure maintenance or capacity investment; or (C) a pattern of utility-related obstruction — including two (2) or more violations of subsection (n) within any five (5) year period, whether during the same or different declared emergencies — demonstrates that the Region is using emergency declarations or scarcity management as a pretext for deprioritizing federal facilities. These criteria are disjunctive; satisfaction of any one is sufficient.

(2) Upon a Utility Siege Finding: (A) all utility services to affected federal facilities shall be immediately restored to the emergency-services priority level, in both quantity and quality; (B) the Region's authority to modify utility allocation to federal facilities in the affected utility category during declared emergencies is suspended for the duration of the finding — during this suspension, any utility allocation decision in the affected category that would reduce service to federal facilities requires prior ARB approval; (C) the Region is liable for all operational costs, project delays, and self-provision expenditures attributable to the siege, with cost recovery following the procedures of Section 4(n) including the fifteen percent (15%) administrative surcharge; (D) the personal liability provisions of subsection (m)(1) apply to Regional officials who directed, authorized, or knowingly failed to prevent the deprioritization; and (E) if the ARB has made two (2) or more Utility Siege Findings against the same Region within any ten (10) year period, the suspension under paragraph (B) extends to all utility categories, not only the affected category. (F) **Interim ARB Order.** Upon receipt of a written complaint from the head of a federal agency alleging a violation of subsection (n), the ARB may issue an interim order within forty-eight (48) hours directing the Region to restore priority service pending full investigation. The interim order remains in effect until the ARB issues a final determination. A Region that fails to comply with an interim order is subject to the enforcement mechanisms of subsection (m).

(3) A Utility Siege Finding is subject to judicial review by the Constitutional Court upon petition by the affected Region within thirty (30) days. During judicial review, the priority restoration of paragraph (2)(A) and any interim order under paragraph (2)(F) remain in effect. The Region bears the burden of demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that its emergency declaration and allocation decisions served a legitimate emergency management purpose and were not pretextual. The court shall consider: (A) temporal proximity between the emergency declaration and federal-Regional disputes; (B) whether comparable non-federal users received proportionally similar reductions in both quantity and quality; (C) whether the emergency conditions justified the degree of deprioritization imposed on federal facilities; (D) statements or actions by Regional officials indicating that deprioritization was intended to create leverage; and (E) whether the Region took reasonable steps to prevent or mitigate the emergency through infrastructure maintenance and capacity investment.

(4) A Utility Siege Finding may be lifted when the ARB certifies that the Region has: (A) restored utility services to federal facilities at the emergency-services priority level in both quantity and quality; (B) adopted structural reforms ensuring that future emergency allocation plans treat federal facilities at parity with Regional emergency services; and (C) compensated the federal government for all costs attributable to the siege. If the finding has been in effect for more than two (2) years and the Region demonstrates sustained compliance with paragraphs (A) and (B), the ARB shall lift the finding upon satisfaction of paragraph (C).

## 6. Design Questions Resolved

| Question | Resolution | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| 1. Priority level | **Parity with emergency services** — not absolute priority | Prevents appearance of federal supremacy over public health during genuine emergencies; both reviewers and convergence analysis agree parity is appropriate |
| 2. 48-hour advance notice | **48 hours retained** with imminent-stability exception in §10(n)(2)(D) and post-hoc notice within 12 hours | Balances federal preparation time against genuine sudden-onset emergencies; imminent grid stability exception prevents the rule from causing cascading failures |
| 3. Self-provision scope (nuclear) | **Nuclear included** with NRC safety gate in §10(o)(2)(A) | Federal property may include nuclear generation but must comply with NRC licensing; Regional permitting exemption does not override federal nuclear safety regulation |
| 4. Emergency-power suspension scope | **Category-specific** — suspension applies to affected utility category only; extends to all categories upon second finding within 10 years | Proportionate response that avoids overbroad suspension while maintaining escalation path for pattern abuse |
| 5. Criminal referral | **Civil only** — relies on §10(m)(1) personal liability and disqualification | Criminalizing utility allocation disputes risks lawfare and politicized prosecution; civil liability with 5-year disqualification provides adequate deterrence without criminal justice risks |
| 6. Private utility attribution | **Retained but narrowed** — attribution applies to actions pursuant to, in response to, or in coordination with Regional emergency orders | Prevents attribution of genuinely independent private utility decisions while closing the delegation loophole; avoids Fifth Amendment takings concerns for independently acting utilities |
| 7. Interaction with §10(g) | **Independent availability** — self-provision is not a prerequisite for Presidential takeover | Both remedies available simultaneously; self-provision reduces dependency, while §10(g) addresses infrastructure seizure for severe cases |

---

## 7. Interaction with Existing Provisions

| New Provision | Interacts With | Relationship |
|---|---|---|
| §10(n)(1) Emergency Priority | §10(b)(1) Minimum Operating Guarantee | Supplements — §10(b) prohibits denial under normal conditions; §10(n) establishes priority during emergency/scarcity |

| §10(n)(4) 24-Hour Restoration | §10(c) Vital Operations Necessity | Parallel — both provide immediate response mechanisms; §10(n)(4) adds specific timeline for priority restoration with impracticability exception |
| §10(n)(5) Duration Cap | Art XVII-RF Emergency Duration | Constrains — prevents indefinite emergency rationing; requires ARB recertification after 30 days |
| §10(o)(1) Self-Provision | §10(g) Emergency Federal Authority | Intermediate — §10(o) provides less escalatory self-provision; §10(g) provides infrastructure takeover; both independently available |
| §10(o)(1)(E) Telecom ROW | Art II-RF §17 National Necessity Easement | Supplements — §10(o)(1)(E) provides franchise-fee-free ROW for telecom; §17 governs easements on non-federal land |
| §10(o)(2)(A) Nuclear Self-Provision | Federal NRC Standards | Preserves — Regional permitting exemption does not override NRC licensing requirements |
| §10(o)(2)(B) Water Self-Provision | §10(l)(3) Water Allocation | Supplements — §10(l)(3) addresses allocation disputes; §10(o)(2)(B) preempts Regional permits blocking self-provision |

| §10(o)(2) Non-Federal Land | Art II-RF §17 National Necessity Easement | Integration — self-provision on non-federal land uses existing easement framework |
| §10(o)(3) Cost Recovery | Art II-RF §4(n) Cost Recovery | Direct reference — uses existing cost recovery procedures including 15% surcharge |
| §10(p)(1) Utility Siege Finding | Art II-RF §1(f)(2) Obstruction Identification | Parallel pattern — both use ARB to identify obstruction with disjunctive criteria |
| §10(p)(1)(B) Manufactured Emergency | §10(i)(3) Infrastructure Maintenance | Extends — §10(i)(3) addresses infrastructure neglect generally; §10(p)(1)(B) addresses deliberate neglect to manufacture emergencies |
| §10(p)(1)(C) Pattern Finding | Art II-RF §1(f)(4) Pattern Obstruction | Parallel — both use 2+ instances in 5 years as pattern threshold |
| §10(p)(2)(B) Category-Specific Suspension | Art II-RF §3-B(c)(2) State Bad Faith Finding | Parallel escalation — both suspend governmental authority upon pattern abuse finding; §10(p)(2)(B) scoped to affected utility category |
| §10(p)(2)(E) Escalation to All Categories | §10(p)(2)(B) Category-Specific Suspension | Escalation — second finding within 10 years broadens suspension from single category to all utility categories |
| §10(p)(2)(F) Interim ARB Order | §10(c) Vital Operations Necessity | Complementary — §10(c) provides certification process; §10(p)(2)(F) provides rapid interim relief pending investigation |
| §10(p)(2)(D) Personal Liability | §10(m)(1) Enforcement | Direct reference — applies existing personal liability framework |
| §10(p)(3) Judicial Review | Art XIV-RF §4 Expedited Review | Uses existing Constitutional Court review infrastructure; burden on Region |
| §10(p)(3) Pretext Analysis | Art II-RF §1(f)(2) Obstruction Identification | Parallel — both use practical-effect test with temporal proximity as evidence |
| §10(p)(4) Finding Duration | §10(p)(2)(B) Suspension | Constrains — two-year sustained-compliance pathway for lifting finding prevents indefinite suspension |

## 8. Review Findings Incorporated

Two independent reviews were conducted. All findings have been incorporated into the revised text in Section 5 above.

### Finding Summary

| ID | Source | Severity | Finding | Resolution |
|----|--------|----------|---------|------------|
| C1 | Convergence | CRITICAL | **Imminent Grid Collapse** — §10(n)(2) prohibits all deprioritization during emergency but genuine imminent grid collapse requires immediate load-shedding; rigid prohibition could cause cascading failure and loss of life | Added §10(n)(2)(D): Imminent Grid Stability Exception — allows immediate shedding when maintaining priority would cause grid collapse, cascading failure, or loss of life-safety systems; requires 4-hour restoration and 24-hour incident report to ARB |
| C2 | Convergence | CRITICAL | **Circuit Topology Trap** — Region places federal facility on shared distribution circuit with low-priority users; sheds entire circuit during emergency claiming selective priority is technically infeasible | Added circuit integrity clause to §10(n)(1): where selective load-shedding is technically infeasible on shared infrastructure, entire segment receives priority level of protected facility |
| C3 | Convergence | HIGH | **Nuclear/Water Permit Loophole** — §10(o)(2) exempts self-provision from Regional permitting but nuclear generation and water self-provision raise distinct safety and environmental concerns | Added §10(o)(2)(A): nuclear self-provision subject to NRC safety standards; §10(o)(2)(B): water self-provision exempt from Regional permits but subject to federal water quality standards |
| C4 | Convergence | MEDIUM | **Emergency Duration Gaming** — Region declares emergency, implements 30% reduction to federal facilities, renews emergency declaration indefinitely; no time limit on emergency rationing | Added §10(n)(5): 30-day duration cap without ARB recertification; Region bears burden of demonstrating continued necessity; automatic suspension if ARB does not recertify within 5 days |
| C5 | Convergence | MEDIUM | **Telecom ROW Denial** — Region could block telecom self-provision by requiring franchise fees or denying rights-of-way for connecting infrastructure | Added §10(o)(1)(E): ROW access for connecting telecom infrastructure without Regional franchise fees or carrier-selection restrictions |
| C6 | Convergence | LOW | **Generally Applicable Codes Ambiguity** — original text referenced "generally applicable federal safety and environmental standards" without clarity on what qualifies | Clarified §10(o)(2)(C): all self-provision infrastructure shall comply with generally applicable federal safety standards; Regional permitting exemption is explicit |
| R1-F1 | R1 | CRITICAL | **Emergency Services Priority Undefined** — "emergency-services priority level" lacks operational definition; Regions could game by defining their own priority levels | §10(n)(1) now defines priority by reference to Region's own emergency allocation plan; if no plan exists, federal facilities receive highest-priority user category |
| R1-F2 | R1 | CRITICAL | **Post-Hoc Notification Gap** — 48-hour advance notice has "as soon as practicable" exception but no deadline for post-hoc notification | Added 12-hour post-hoc notification deadline in §10(n)(2)(C) when advance notice is impracticable |
| R2-F2 | R2 | CRITICAL | **Quality Degradation vs. Quantity Reduction** — Region could provide nominal quantity at emergency-services level but degrade quality (voltage, water purity, signal integrity) | §10(n)(1) now explicitly covers both quantity and quality of service; §10(n)(2) requires proportional reduction in both; §10(p)(1)(A) includes quality degradation as siege criterion |
| R2-F5 | R2 | CRITICAL | **Private Utility Attribution Escape Hatch** — original attribution covered all private utility decisions during emergency; too broad (Fifth Amendment concerns) and simultaneously too narrow (doesn't require nexus to Regional orders) | Narrowed §10(n)(3): attribution applies to actions "pursuant to, in response to, or in coordination with" Regional emergency orders, allocation directives, or regulatory guidance — not all private actions during emergency |
| R2-F6 | R2 | CRITICAL | **Manufactured Emergency Safe Harbor** — Region could deliberately defer infrastructure maintenance to create genuine emergency, then use emergency as cover for deprioritization | Added §10(p)(1)(B): manufactured or prolonged emergency through deliberate deferral of infrastructure maintenance or capacity investment is a Utility Siege criterion |
| R2-F10 | R2 | CRITICAL | **Judicial Review Burden of Proof** — original text did not specify burden of proof for pretext analysis; Region could shift burden to federal government | §10(p)(3): Region bears burden of demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that emergency declaration served legitimate purpose; added infrastructure maintenance history as pretext factor |
| R1-F4 | R1 | HIGH | **Proportional Reduction Imprecision** — "same proportional reduction" lacked clarity on whether it means quantity, quality, or both | §10(n)(2)(A) now specifies "same proportional reduction — in both quantity and quality of service" |
| R1-F5 | R1 | HIGH | **Nuclear Self-Provision Safety** — nuclear generation enumerated without safety framework reference | Resolved by §10(o)(2)(A): NRC safety standards apply; Regional permitting exemption does not extend to NRC licensing |
| R1-F10 | R1 | MEDIUM | **No Preliminary Finding Mechanism** — ARB Utility Siege Finding requires full investigation; no rapid interim relief | Added §10(p)(2)(F): Interim ARB Order within 48 hours directing priority restoration pending full investigation |
| R2-F3 | R2 | HIGH | **Simultaneous Application Loophole** — Region could time-shift reductions (reduce federal facilities Monday, emergency services Tuesday) to avoid "simultaneous" requirement | §10(n)(2)(A) "simultaneously applied" prevents temporal gaming; the 12-hour post-hoc notification requirement and ARB incident review provide enforcement mechanism |
| R2-F4 | R2 | HIGH | **48-Hour Notice as Asymmetric Preparation** — 48-hour notice gives Region time to prepare for confrontation while federal facility scrambles | Retained 48-hour notice as minimum; Imminent Grid Stability Exception (§10(n)(2)(D)) and interim ARB order (§10(p)(2)(F)) provide counter-mechanisms |
| R2-F9 | R2 | HIGH | **Pattern Threshold Gaming** — 5-year window allows Region to space violations > 5 years apart to avoid pattern finding | Retained 2-in-5-year threshold for individual Utility Siege Findings; added 2-in-10-year escalation to all-category suspension in §10(p)(2)(E) for broader pattern detection |
| User-F1 | User | HIGH | **Suspension Scope Too Broad** — suspending all utility allocation authority disproportionate when only water allocation was abused | §10(p)(2)(B) now scopes suspension to affected utility category; §10(p)(2)(E) extends to all categories only upon second finding within 10 years |
| User-F2 | User | MEDIUM | **24-Hour Restoration Too Rigid** — physical infrastructure damage or system-wide capacity constraints may make 24-hour restoration infeasible | §10(n)(4) now includes impracticability exception: written explanation to federal agency and ARB, restoration timeline not to exceed 72 hours |
| User-F3 | User | MEDIUM | **Nuclear Safety Gate** — nuclear self-provision should be gated by existing nuclear safety provisions | §10(o)(2)(A): NRC safety standards apply; Regional permitting exemption does not extend to NRC licensing requirements |
| User-F4 | User | MEDIUM | **Private Utility Attribution Narrowing** — attribution should be limited to actions pursuant to emergency orders | §10(n)(3) narrowed: attribution limited to actions pursuant to, in response to, or in coordination with Regional emergency orders |
| R1-F12 | R1 | LOW | **No Sunset for Emergency-Power Suspension** — suspension could continue indefinitely after finding | §10(p)(4) adds two-year sustained-compliance pathway: if finding in effect > 2 years and Region demonstrates sustained compliance, ARB shall lift upon cost satisfaction |
| R2-F7 | R2 | MEDIUM | **24-Hour Restoration Cycling** — Region restores within 24 hours, then deprioritizes again after 25 hours, cycling indefinitely | Pattern threshold (2 violations in 5 years) captures cycling behavior; each cycle counts as separate violation triggering Utility Siege Finding |
| R2-F11 | R2 | HIGH | **Environmental Compliance as Self-Provision Barrier** — Region could weaponize environmental review to block self-provision on federal property | §10(o)(2) exempts self-provision from Regional environmental review; water self-provision exempt from Regional withdrawal/discharge permits; compliance with federal environmental standards only |

### Design Questions Resolved

| Question | Resolution |
|----------|------------|
| 1. Priority level | Parity with emergency services — both reviewers agree; prevents appearance of federal supremacy over public health. R2 suggested tiered approach (absolute for defense, parity for civilian); convergence retains uniform parity to avoid complexity and classification disputes |
| 2. 48-hour advance notice | 48 hours retained with imminent-stability exception (§10(n)(2)(D)) and 12-hour post-hoc notification deadline. R1 recommended post-hoc deadline; R2 flagged asymmetric preparation; convergence adds both imminent exception and post-hoc requirement |
| 3. Self-provision scope (nuclear) | Nuclear included with NRC safety gate — R1 recommended NRC compliance requirement; convergence adopts. Water self-provision adds preemption of Regional withdrawal/discharge permits per convergence finding C3 |
| 4. Emergency-power suspension scope | Category-specific — user finding; R1 recommended limiting to affected category. Convergence adds escalation to all categories upon second finding within 10 years (§10(p)(2)(E)) |
| 5. Criminal referral | Civil only — user directive. Criminalizing utility allocation disputes risks lawfare and politicized prosecution. R1 recommended criminal referral for pattern findings; R2 recommended criminal for willful repeated conduct; user overrules as policy risk outweighs deterrence benefit |
| 6. Private utility attribution | Retained but narrowed to actions pursuant to emergency orders — user finding. R1 flagged Fifth Amendment concerns; R2 flagged escape hatch. Convergence narrows nexus requirement while maintaining delegation prohibition |
| 7. Interaction with §10(g) | Independent availability — both reviewers agree. Self-provision not prerequisite for Presidential takeover; both remedies available simultaneously |
