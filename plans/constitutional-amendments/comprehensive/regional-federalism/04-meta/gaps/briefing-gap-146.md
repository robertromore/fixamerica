# Briefing: Gap 146 — The "Administrative Exhaustion" Veto

## 1. The Problem

**Gap 146** identifies a structural vulnerability in the enforcement of inter-regional cooperation and infrastructure coordination. Article I-RF, Section 9 requires mutual recognition and cooperation, and Section 6 establishes transit and non-blockade rights, but neither specifies maximum processing times for Regional administrative actions affecting inter-regional projects. A Region seeking to block a National Interest Corridor, inter-regional infrastructure project, or cooperative domain implementation could establish labyrinthine review processes requiring dozens of impact studies and public hearings that take years. The project dies by a thousand delays — the Region effectively exercises a veto without ever issuing a formal denial that could be challenged in the ARB.

### The Attack Vectors

| Vector | Mechanism | Effect |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **"Environmental Review Cascade"** | Region requires environmental impact study; study reveals "secondary impacts" requiring additional studies; each study triggers 90-day public comment period | Decade passes without formal decision; project abandoned |
| **"Community Input Marathon"** | Region requires public hearings in every affected municipality; each hearing requires 60-day notice; hearings generate "concerns" requiring "further analysis" | Process loops indefinitely with no final determination |
| **"Inter-Agency Referral Loop"** | Regional agency claims project requires approval from multiple departments; each department refers to others for "coordination"; no single point of authority | Project trapped in bureaucratic limbo; no decision-maker |
| **"Incomplete Application" Rejection** | Region rejects applications as "incomplete" on technicalities; applicant corrects; Region finds new deficiency; clock resets with each resubmission | Years consumed without substantive review ever beginning |
| **"Pre-Application Gauntlet"** | Region requires mandatory pre-application conferences, scoping sessions, and preliminary reviews before accepting an application; process takes 6-12 months | Shotclock never starts; no "complete application" is ever filed |
| **"Tier Inflation"** | Region publishes review requirements that classify routine permits as requiring comprehensive environmental impact assessment | Every project defaults to the longest possible timeline |

### Why Existing Protections Are Insufficient

| Protection | What It Covers | What It Misses |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Art I-RF §6(i) (Processing Time Standards) | Transit infrastructure inspections: processing times shall not exceed national median | Addresses routine inspections, not project permitting or environmental review; median benchmark may itself be gamed if all Regions delay |
| Art I-RF §9(q) (Processing Timeline) | Credential recognition: 30-day shotclock with automatic recognition | Addresses professional credentials only; not project permits, environmental review, or zoning decisions |
| Art I-RF §9(u) (Federal Backstop) | Systematic credential recognition failure: Federal Practice Credentials | Addresses credential non-compliance; not project permitting obstruction |
| Art II-RF §1(f) (Federal Enforcement Operational Immunity) | Federal enforcement personnel: licensing immunity | Addresses personnel licensing; not project permitting or environmental review |
| Art II-RF §4(m) ("Working On It" Defense Prohibited) | 24-month environmental review and 12-month permitting deadlines for State implementation | Addresses State-context delay with constructive denial; does not cover Regional administrative review of inter-regional projects |
| Art XX §3(g)-(t) (NIC Dispute Resolution) | Tribal-corridor disputes: Sovereign Mediation Panel | Addresses tribal consent; not Regional administrative delay in processing permits for projects outside tribal land |

### The Critical Distinction: Delay vs. Denial

The existing framework handles denial well — the ARB can review and overturn denials under various provisions. But the framework does not handle *delay* because delay produces no reviewable decision. A Region that never says "no" but never says "yes" creates no administrative action for the ARB to review. The absence of a decision is not, under existing provisions, itself a violation.

## 2. Existing Coverage Analysis

### What Exists

- **Art I-RF §6(i)**: Processing time standards for transit infrastructure — national median benchmark, 50% deviation creates presumption of obstruction, ARB may mandate improvements
- **Art I-RF §9(q)**: 30-day processing timeline for credential recognition — automatic recognition on expiration
- **Art I-RF §9(u)**: Federal Backstop — Federal Practice Credentials for systematic credential non-compliance
- **Art II-RF §4**: Project implementation provisions — cooperative domain implementation without specific processing timelines
- **Art II-RF §4(m)**: "Working On It" Defense Prohibited — 24-month environmental review / 12-month permitting deadlines with constructive denial in State-implementation context
- **Art XX §3(g)-(t)**: NIC dispute resolution — mediation framework for tribal-corridor disputes
- **Art XIV-RF §7**: Docket Protection — addresses judicial docket clogging; parallel problem in administrative rather than judicial domain

### What Does Not Exist

- No mandatory processing deadline for Regional administrative review of inter-regional projects, National Interest Corridor permits, or cooperative domain implementation
- No constructive approval mechanism when a Region fails to decide within a deadline (constructive *denial* exists in §4(m) but not constructive *approval*)
- No anti-circumvention provisions for serial delay tactics in project permitting (cascading studies, inter-agency loops, incomplete-application cycling, pre-application gauntlets)
- No concurrent processing mandate requiring all required approvals to run simultaneously
- No published-requirements lock preventing post-submission changes to approval criteria
- No pattern-finding mechanism for administrative obstruction of project permitting
- No escalating consequences for repeat administrative delay obstruction
- No proportionality check on application requirements
- No protection against tier designation gaming

| Gap | Relationship |
|-----|-------------|
| **18** (Legislative Nullification) | Resolved — substantive obstruction; Gap 146 addresses procedural obstruction through administrative delay |
| **67** (Infrastructure Ransom) | Resolved — infrastructure leverage through closure/access denial; Gap 146 addresses permitting leverage through administrative delay |
| **83** (Infrastructure Decay as Coercion) | PA — passive infrastructure neglect; Gap 146 addresses active delay tactics in project approvals |
| **135** (Licensing of Federal Operations) | Resolved — Art II §1(f); licensing barriers to federal enforcement; Gap 146 addresses permitting barriers to inter-regional projects |
| **145** (Docket Clogging) | Resolved — Art XIV-RF §7; judicial docket obstruction; Gap 146 addresses administrative process obstruction (parallel problem, different domain) |
| **143** (Utility Siege) | Resolved — Art II-RF §10(n)-(p); utility deprioritization during emergency; Gap 146 addresses infrastructure permitting obstruction during project development |

## 4. Proposed Approach: Administrative Shotclock Framework

Four new subsections — **§9(ff)-(ii)** — added to the Mutual Recognition section, establishing mandatory decision deadlines for project-related administrative actions, constructive approval on deadline expiration, anti-circumvention provisions, and an expedited delay challenge procedure with escalating consequences.

### Design Principles

1. **Build on existing §9(q) pattern**: Section 9(q) already establishes a processing shotclock with automatic consequence (30-day credential timeline + automatic recognition). The amendment extends this pattern from credential recognition to project permitting.
2. **Scope: inter-regional cooperation and federal projects**: The shotclock applies to administrative actions affecting National Interest Corridors, inter-regional reciprocity agreements, cooperative domain implementation, and federally funded infrastructure projects — not all Regional permitting.
3. **Four tiered timelines with objective definitions**: Tier A (120 days), Tier B (180 days), Tier C (270 days), Tier D (365 days for mega-projects) — reflecting genuine differences in review complexity. Tiers defined by objective project characteristics, not by the Region's review requirements.
4. **Constructive approval with safety valves**: Deadline expiration triggers constructive approval with generally applicable standards. Good-faith progress exception for Tier C/D allows ARB to order 30-day compelled-decision window. Emergency Safety Stay for imminent threat to public safety or irreversible environmental harm.
5. **Concurrent processing mandate with transparency**: All required approvals must run simultaneously. Region must identify all reviewing entities within 14 days. Sub-Regional entities covered.
6. **Published requirements lock with proportionality**: Requirements fixed at submission; ARB may strike disproportionate requirements; safety data exception with capped tolling.
7. **Robust pattern consequences**: 3-in-5-years baseline (or 2-in-3 with bad-faith finding); cross-category and concerted obstruction aggregation; single-violation escalation for deliberate policy; first violation triggers enhanced monitoring.
8. **Federal agency transfer, not ARB**: Permitting authority transfers to the federal agency with relevant expertise, not the ARB. Region funds transfer costs.
9. **Integration with existing enforcement**: Cost recovery through §4(n); bespoke personal liability with supervisory presumption; ARB oversight consistent with §1(f) pattern.

## 5. Proposed Constitutional Text

### Art I-RF §9(ff)-(ii). Administrative Shotclock Framework

*Resolves Gap 146 — The "Administrative Exhaustion" Veto. These subsections prevent Regions from exercising de facto vetoes over inter-regional projects through indefinite administrative delay by establishing mandatory decision deadlines, constructive approval, anti-circumvention provisions, and escalating consequences for pattern delay.*

Add new subsections (ff), (gg), (hh), and (ii) to Section 9:

#### §9(ff). Administrative Shotclock

(ff) **Administrative Shotclock.**

(1) **Scope and Timelines.** Any Regional administrative action — including permitting, zoning, environmental review, impact assessment, public hearing, or regulatory approval — affecting a National Interest Corridor designated under Article XX, Section 3(g), an inter-regional infrastructure project undertaken pursuant to a cooperation agreement under Section 5, a cooperative domain implementation project under Article II-RF, Section 4, or a federally funded infrastructure project, shall be completed within the applicable timeline from the date of complete application as determined under this subsection.

(2) **Tier Definitions.** For purposes of this subsection: (A) **Tier A** (one hundred twenty (120) days) encompasses administrative actions that involve no environmental assessment under applicable Regional or federal law, do not require public hearing, and involve a single reviewing agency or authority; (B) **Tier B** (one hundred eighty (180) days) encompasses administrative actions that require environmental assessment, public comment, or coordination among two or more agencies, but do not involve preparation of a comprehensive environmental impact statement or resolution of novel regulatory questions without established precedent; (C) **Tier C** (two hundred seventy (270) days) encompasses administrative actions requiring preparation of a comprehensive environmental impact statement, coordination among five or more agencies, or resolution of novel regulatory questions for which no established Regional or federal precedent exists; (D) **Tier D** (three hundred sixty-five (365) days) encompasses administrative actions involving major facility siting, new industrial facilities handling hazardous materials, or projects requiring concurrent approvals from more than three Regions. The tier is determined by the nature and characteristics of the project, not by the scope of review the Region elects to impose.

(3) **Tier Determination.** (A) If the Region has published tier classifications for the applicable category of administrative action, the published classification governs, subject to ARB proportionality review under paragraph (9). (B) If no published classification exists, the applicant shall designate the applicable tier at filing. (C) Any party may petition the ARB for reclassification within seven (7) days of filing. The ARB shall resolve the dispute within fourteen (14) days. During a tier dispute, the clock runs under the higher of the two disputed tiers. If the ARB reclassifies the action to a lower tier than the one under which the clock was running, the applicant receives credit for all elapsed time. (D) An applicant that designates a tier more than one level below the tier ultimately determined by the ARB forfeits the tolling credit and the clock resets at the correct tier. (E) A Region may not reclassify a category of administrative action to a higher tier within two (2) years of a pattern administrative obstruction finding under subsection (hh)(7) for that category.

(4) **Complete Application.** (A) A complete application is deemed achieved when the applicant has submitted all materials specified in the Region's published application requirements as of the date of submission. The Region shall publish clear, comprehensive application requirements for each category of administrative action subject to this subsection. (B) If the Region has not published specific requirements for the applicable category, the application is deemed complete upon submission of the materials required for the most analogous category for which published requirements exist. If no analogous published requirements exist, the applicant shall submit the materials specified in any applicable federal requirements for the same type of project, and the application is deemed complete upon such submission. (C) Pre-application conferences, pre-submission reviews, or other pre-filing processes may not be mandatory conditions of filing an application. Any process a Region requires before it will accept an application as filed is deemed part of the application process and is subject to the shotclock.

(5) **Information Requests.** The Region may request additional information from the applicant as follows: (A) one (1) time for Tier A and Tier B actions, within thirty (30) days of application submission; (B) up to two (2) times for Tier C and Tier D actions, within thirty (30) days of application submission for the first request and within thirty (30) days of receipt of the first response for the second request. Each request tolls the deadline for the period the applicant takes to respond, but total tolling across all requests may not exceed sixty (60) days. Information requests must be proportionate to the complexity of the project and reasonably responsive within the tolling period. An applicant may challenge an information request to the ARB as disproportionate; if the ARB agrees, the tolling does not apply and the clock resumes. If the applicant fails to respond to any request within sixty (60) days, the application is deemed withdrawn without prejudice to refiling. Requests after the first must identify why the information could not reasonably have been requested earlier.

(6) **Hard Cap.** The total processing time for any administrative action subject to this subsection — including all tolling periods, extensions, and supplementary review — may not exceed the applicable tier deadline plus sixty (60) days for Tiers A through C, or the applicable tier deadline plus ninety (90) days for Tier D. This hard cap is not subject to further extension by any Regional authority.

(7) **Definitions.** For purposes of subsections (ff) through (ii): (A) "Federally funded infrastructure project" means any project receiving direct or indirect federal financial support — including grants, loans, loan guarantees, tax credits, or in-kind contributions — of any amount for the construction, improvement, or maintenance of physical infrastructure. (B) "Regional administrative action" includes any administrative action by a State, county, municipality, or other sub-Regional governmental entity within the Region that is required for a project subject to this subsection, regardless of whether the sub-Regional entity exercises delegated Regional authority or independent authority. The Region is responsible for ensuring that all governmental entities within its jurisdiction process their required actions within the applicable shotclock. Delegation of review authority to a sub-Regional entity does not extend or restart the shotclock.

(8) **Scope Lock.** A project that is within the scope of this subsection at the date of application filing remains within scope regardless of subsequent changes to the project's funding structure, organizational structure, or other characteristics that would otherwise remove it from scope.

(9) **Proportionality of Application Requirements.** Published application requirements shall be proportionate to the complexity and potential impact of the category of administrative action. The ARB may, upon petition by any applicant or on its own initiative, review the published application requirements for any category subject to this subsection and strike requirements that are not reasonably related to the legitimate regulatory purpose of the review. Requirements struck by the ARB may not be reimposed for three (3) years. An applicant who has submitted all non-struck requirements has a complete application regardless of other published requirements.

#### §9(gg). Constructive Approval

(gg) **Constructive Approval.**

(1) **Automatic Approval.** Failure to issue a final written decision within the applicable Administrative Shotclock period results in Constructive Approval by operation of law. Constructive Approval has the same legal effect as express approval and is immediately effective upon expiration of the deadline. The approved project shall comply with all generally applicable safety, environmental, and building standards in effect in the Region at the date of application submission. The Region may not impose project-specific conditions after a Constructive Approval except as provided in paragraph (5).

(2) **Final Written Decision Defined.** A "final written decision" — whether approval, denial, or conditional approval — must include: (A) identification of the decision-maker; (B) a statement of the decision; (C) findings of fact supporting the decision, including, for a denial, identification of each specific deficiency in the application with reference to the applicable published requirement; (D) identification of all conditions, if the decision is a conditional approval; and (E) notice of appeal rights. A communication lacking any of these elements is not a final written decision for purposes of subsection (ff).

(3) **Certificate.** Upon request by the applicant, the ARB shall issue a Certificate of Constructive Approval within seven (7) days, documenting the application date, the applicable deadline, the expiration date, and the absence of a timely decision. The Certificate is conclusive evidence of approval for purposes of project implementation.

(4) **Good-Faith Progress Exception.** For Tier C and Tier D actions, if the Region demonstrates to the ARB — before the shotclock expires — that it has made substantial good-faith progress toward a decision and that the specific technical analysis remaining cannot reasonably be completed within the deadline, the ARB may order a Compelled Decision Window of thirty (30) days. During the Compelled Decision Window, the Region shall issue a final written decision. Failure to issue a decision within the Compelled Decision Window results in Constructive Approval. The Good-Faith Progress Exception may be invoked only once per application and operates as an alternative to the immediate triggering of Constructive Approval.

(5) **Emergency Safety Stay.** (A) The Region may petition the ARB within fourteen (14) days of a Constructive Approval for an Emergency Safety Stay upon a showing — supported by specific, documented evidence — that project implementation without review would create an imminent threat to public safety or irreversible environmental harm that cannot be remedied after the fact. Policy disagreements, fiscal concerns, or political opposition to the project do not qualify. (B) The ARB shall rule on Emergency Safety Stay petitions within seven (7) days. In evaluating the petition, the ARB shall consider whether the Region raised the safety or environmental concern during the original shotclock period; failure to raise the concern creates a rebuttable presumption against the Stay. (C) If the ARB grants a Stay, the Region shall complete its substantive review within sixty (60) days of the Stay. The Region may petition the ARB for a single thirty (30) day extension upon a showing that the specific technical analysis required to resolve the identified threat cannot reasonably be completed in sixty days. No further extensions are permitted. Failure to complete review within the applicable period results in reinstatement of the Constructive Approval. (D) A denial issued during an Emergency Safety Stay period must be supported by clear and convincing evidence of the safety or environmental grounds that justified the Stay. (E) An applicant may commence project implementation immediately upon Constructive Approval. If the Region subsequently obtains an Emergency Safety Stay, work completed before the Stay order is not subject to reversal, and the applicant is not liable for proceeding in reliance on the Constructive Approval. (F) If the ARB denies an Emergency Safety Stay petition and finds that the petition was not supported by a reasonable, good-faith basis in fact, the Region shall reimburse the applicant's documented costs attributable to the period of uncertainty, following the cost recovery procedures of Article II-RF, Section 4(n). A frivolous Stay petition counts as a violation for purposes of the pattern administrative obstruction provision of subsection (hh)(7).

(6) **Deadline Notice.** The applicant shall provide written notice to the Region at least thirty (30) days before the expiration of the applicable shotclock period, and again upon expiration, identifying the application, the applicable deadline, and the impending or actual Constructive Approval. Failure to provide the thirty-day advance notice does not invalidate the Constructive Approval but extends the Emergency Safety Stay petition window of paragraph (5)(A) from fourteen (14) to twenty-eight (28) days. Failure to provide the expiration notice tolls the Constructive Approval until notice is given.

(7) **Conclusivity.** Any challenge to the validity of a Constructive Approval — including challenges to application completeness, project scope, or tier designation — must be raised within thirty (30) days of the approval taking effect. After thirty (30) days, the Constructive Approval is conclusive and may not be collaterally attacked.

(8) **Exclusive Jurisdiction.** Any legal challenge to a Constructive Approval, a Certificate of Constructive Approval, or any project proceeding under such approval — whether brought by the Region, a sub-Regional entity, or any third party — shall be filed exclusively in the National Constitutional Court or the ARB. No Regional, State, or local court has jurisdiction over challenges to projects proceeding under Constructive Approval. This provision does not limit enforcement of generally applicable safety and environmental standards during construction and operation, but such enforcement may not take the form of injunctive relief halting the project without ARB authorization.

(9) **Ongoing Compliance.** Constructive Approval does not exempt the project from generally applicable safety and environmental standards that apply during construction and operation. The approval relates to the administrative decision to permit the project, not to ongoing compliance with operational standards.

(10) **Applicant Good Faith.** An applicant that knowingly misrepresents the nature, scope, or potential impacts of a project in its application or tier designation forfeits Constructive Approval. The Region may petition the ARB at any time for a finding of applicant bad faith. Upon such a finding, the ARB shall void the Constructive Approval, the applicant shall bear all costs of remediation, and the applicant is barred from invoking the Administrative Shotclock for any application for a period of two (2) years.

#### §9(hh). Deadline Integrity

(hh) **Deadline Integrity.**

(1) **Prohibited Circumvention.** Regions may not circumvent the Administrative Shotclock by: (A) issuing "preliminary," "conditional," or "interim" approvals that require subsequent review before the project may proceed — any approval that does not authorize project implementation is not a "final written decision" for purposes of subsection (ff); (B) requiring serial rather than concurrent approval from multiple agencies, departments, or authorities — all required approvals shall run concurrently, and the shotclock applies to the entire approval process, not each agency individually; (C) claiming an application is "incomplete" on grounds not specified in published requirements as of the date of submission; (D) creating, amending, or imposing new review requirements, studies, impact assessments, or conditions after the application has been submitted — requirements are fixed at the date of submission; (E) transferring review authority to a different agency, department, or entity after application submission without the applicant's consent; (F) requiring the applicant to obtain approval from non-governmental entities — homeowners' associations, business improvement districts, or other private bodies — as a condition of Regional approval; (G) imposing mandatory pre-application conferences, pre-submission reviews, or other pre-filing processes as conditions of application acceptance — any such process is optional, and the shotclock begins upon submission of the required documentary materials regardless of whether a pre-application process has been completed; or (H) coercing the applicant to withdraw and refile — if an applicant refiles a substantially similar application within ninety (90) days of withdrawal, the clock is deemed to have continued running from the original filing date, and inducing withdrawal is deemed a circumvention violation.

(2) **Concurrent Processing Transparency.** Within fourteen (14) days of application submission, the Region shall provide the applicant with a written identification of all agencies, departments, authorities, and entities whose approval or review is required, the name and contact information of the responsible official in each, and confirmation that each has received the application. The concurrent processing mandate applies to any entity exercising public authority over any aspect of the project, regardless of its structural independence, delegation status, or nominal classification.

(3) **Requirements Lock.** If a Region amends its published application requirements during the pendency of an application, the amendment does not apply to that application or to any application filed within one hundred eighty (180) days of the amendment. New requirements apply only to applications filed after the amendment plus the one hundred eighty (180) day grace period.

(4) **Safety Data Exception.** If genuinely new safety or environmental information — not available at the date of application submission and not reasonably discoverable by the applicant — materially affects the project's impact assessment, the Region may petition the ARB for a tolling period not to exceed sixty (60) days to evaluate the new information. The ARB shall rule on the tolling petition within fourteen (14) days. Tolling under this paragraph counts toward the hard cap of subsection (ff)(6).

(5) **Novel Regulatory Questions.** The absence of a specific regulatory framework for a category of project does not suspend the shotclock. The Region shall evaluate the application under existing general standards, analogous frameworks, or applicable federal standards. If the Region determines that new regulations are needed, the rulemaking process shall proceed concurrently with the shotclock and does not toll or suspend the deadline.

(6) **Pretextual Denial.** If the ARB finds that a denial was not supported by substantial evidence or did not address the specific deficiencies required by subsection (gg)(2)(C), the ARB may: (A) convert the denial into a Constructive Approval; (B) treat the pretextual denial as a violation for purposes of the pattern administrative obstruction provision of paragraph (7); and (C) order the Region to approve the application with such conditions as the ARB deems necessary to address any legitimate concern identified in the record. A second pretextual denial of the same application is a per se pattern violation.

(7) **Pattern Administrative Obstruction.** (A) The ARB may find pattern administrative obstruction upon any of the following: (i) three (3) or more violations of the Administrative Shotclock, or three (3) or more Constructive Approvals, within any five (5) year period for the same category of administrative action; (ii) two (2) or more violations or Constructive Approvals within any three (3) year period, if the ARB finds by clear and convincing evidence that any violation resulted from bad faith or deliberate obstruction by Regional officials; (iii) a single violation, if the ARB finds by clear and convincing evidence that the violation resulted from a deliberate policy or directive by Regional officials to obstruct or delay the specific project or category of projects; (iv) four (4) or more violations across any categories of administrative action within any five (5) year period, regardless of category (cross-category aggregation). (B) For purposes of this paragraph, "violation" includes: shotclock expiration resulting in Constructive Approval, ARB findings of delay tactics under subsection (ii)(2), pretextual denial findings under paragraph (6), and frivolous Emergency Safety Stay petition findings under subsection (gg)(5)(F). (C) The first violation of the Administrative Shotclock — even if below the pattern threshold — triggers enhanced ARB monitoring of the Region's processing of all projects subject to this subsection for a period of three (3) years. (D) **Concerted Obstruction.** If multiple Regions delay the same project, their actions are aggregated for pattern-finding purposes. Two or more Regions each contributing one or more violations to the same project's delay constitutes pattern obstruction for all participating Regions. (E) Upon a pattern finding, the ARB may impose an accelerated shotclock of ninety (90) days for all administrative actions in the affected category for a period of two (2) years. During the accelerated period, the Region may petition the ARB for standard-timeline reinstatement upon demonstrating structural reforms sufficient to ensure timely processing.

#### §9(ii). Delay Challenge Procedure

(ii) **Delay Challenge Procedure.**

(1) **Expedited Review.** An applicant may petition the ARB for expedited review at any time after an application has been pending for more than half the applicable shotclock period without a final written decision or substantive response from the Region. The ARB shall rule on the petition within twenty-one (21) days. If the ARB fails to rule within twenty-one (21) days, a Provisional Approval issues automatically, subject to the conditions of paragraph (2).

(2) **Provisional Approval.** Upon finding that the Region is engaged in delay tactics — including but not limited to the conduct described in subsection (hh)(1), unexplained failure to act, or repeated requests for information not specified in published requirements — the ARB may issue a Provisional Approval. Provisional Approval permits project commencement pending the ARB's final determination. Provisional Approval may be conditioned on compliance with specific safety or environmental standards identified by the ARB. A finding of delay tactics counts as a violation for purposes of subsection (hh)(7).

(3) **Escalating Consequences.** A Region found to have engaged in pattern administrative obstruction under subsection (hh)(7) is subject to: (A) the accelerated shotclock of subsection (hh)(7)(E); (B) reimbursement of all documented project delay costs — including carrying costs, contract penalties, and opportunity costs — to the affected applicant, following the cost recovery procedures of Article II-RF, Section 4(n), including the fifteen percent (15%) administrative surcharge; (C) personal liability for Regional officials who directed, authorized, or knowingly participated in the delay pattern — any official with supervisory authority over the agency responsible for the delay is rebuttably presumed to have knowingly participated unless the official demonstrates affirmative steps taken to ensure compliance with the shotclock; liability attaches under the standards and procedures applicable to willful obstruction of constitutionally protected activity and is limited to civil penalties; (D) if administrative obstruction persists after imposition of the accelerated shotclock, the Region's permitting authority over the affected project category shall be temporarily transferred to the federal agency with primary jurisdiction over the subject matter of the permit — or, if no single federal agency has primary jurisdiction, to an interagency panel designated by the President — for a period not to exceed five (5) years. During transferred authority, the designated federal agency shall process applications under applicable federal environmental, safety, and regulatory standards within the timelines established by subsection (ff). The ARB shall monitor compliance with processing timelines during the transfer period. The Region shall fund the designated federal agency's permitting operations during the transfer period through equalization transfer offsets.

(4) **Interaction with National Interest Corridors.** For administrative actions affecting designated National Interest Corridors under Article XX, Section 3(g), the Administrative Shotclock of this subsection operates concurrently with and independently of the Sovereign Mediation process of Article XX, Section 3(h)-(n). A Region may not delay administrative processing pending the outcome of tribal mediation, and tribal mediation may not delay Regional administrative processing. Where both processes apply, the project may proceed with respect to any component covered by the completed process that is not materially dependent on the outcome of the pending process. If a project cannot be disaggregated into independent components, the applicant proceeds at its own risk and is not entitled to cost recovery from either the Region or the tribal nation for modifications required by the subsequently completed process. The ARB may, upon petition by any party, issue a determination of disaggregability within twenty-one (21) days.

(5) **Judicial Review.** (A) A Region may petition the National Constitutional Court for review of a pattern administrative obstruction finding under subsection (hh)(7) or a permitting authority transfer under paragraph (3)(D) within thirty (30) days of the ARB's order. (B) During judicial review, the accelerated shotclock or authority transfer remains in effect unless the Court finds a substantial likelihood that the ARB's finding was clearly erroneous. (C) The Court shall issue a final determination within ninety (90) days.

(6) **Voluntary Expansion.** A Regional Legislature may, by law, extend the Administrative Shotclock framework of subsections (ff) through (ii) to categories of purely intra-Regional administrative actions. Such extension is voluntary, self-imposed, and may be repealed by the Regional Legislature.

(7) **Limitations.** (A) Subsections (ff) through (ii) do not apply to judicial proceedings, legislative action, or review conducted directly by a federal agency under a federal statute. State or Regional reviews conducted under state or Regional authority — even if they parallel, implement, or are authorized by federal law — remain subject to the shotclock. (B) Nothing in these subsections limits the authority of federal agencies to conduct their own environmental or safety reviews of federally funded projects on timelines established by federal law. (C) Constructive Approval under subsection (gg) does not preempt or satisfy federal review requirements that apply independently to the project.

## 7. Summary of Changes from v1 to v2

| Change | Source | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Add Tier D (365 days) for mega-projects | User, R1-Q1 | Prevents Tier C overload for genuinely complex projects |

| Expand Emergency Safety Stay to "imminent threat or irreversible environmental harm" | User | Broader than original but narrower than R1's "substantial risk" |
| Rebuttable presumption against Stay if concern not raised during shotclock | R2-V03 | Prevents deliberate run-the-clock-then-Stay tactic |
| 30-day extension after Stay for technical analysis | R1-F05 | Genuine safety concerns may need more than 60 days |

## 8. Review Findings Incorporated

### 8.1 Review Process

- **Reviewer 1** (Constitutional Law Specialist): 9 text findings (F-01 through F-09), 6 gaming vectors (GV-01 through GV-06), 7 design question answers. Overall assessment: "well-conceived and structurally sound" with critical fixes needed for tier designation, standard conditions, and due process.
- **Reviewer 2** (Adversarial Stress-Tester): 17 gaming vectors (V-01 through V-17), 12 text findings (F-01 through F-12), 7 design question answers. Overall assessment: three CRITICAL issues share a root cause — "the Region controls the inputs that determine when and whether the shotclock starts running."
- **User**: Two convergence assessments with 10 directives plus 2 additional gaming vectors (Superficial Denial, Local Zoning Proxy).

### 8.2 Convergence Points (All Three Sources Agree)

| ID | Finding | Resolution |
|----|---------|------------|
| C1 | Constructive approval is the correct default consequence | Retained; hardened with generally applicable standards, good-faith exception, safety valves |
| C2 | Tier designation mechanism is gameable | Objective tier definitions tied to project characteristics; published classifications subject to ARB review |
| C3 | "Standard conditions" undefined and exploitable | Replaced with "generally applicable safety, environmental, and building standards" |
| C4 | Permitting authority transfer should go to federal agency, not ARB | Transferred to federal agency with primary jurisdiction; ARB oversight; Region funds costs |
| C5 | Narrow scope (inter-regional + federal) is correct | Retained with anti-restructuring and voluntary Regional opt-in |
| C6 | NIC concurrent operation model is correct | Retained with disaggregability clarification |

### 8.6 Findings Noted But Not Adopted

| Finding | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| R2: Two tiers (120/240) instead of four | User directive: four tiers. Objective definitions mitigate tier-gaming concern that motivated R2's recommendation. |
| R2: Keep "imminent threat" standard for Stay (not "irreversible environmental harm") | User directive: expanded standard. Middle ground between R2's narrow "imminent threat" and R1's broad "substantial risk." |
| R2-V04: Anti-retaliation enforcement-rate metrics (200% comparison) | Over-engineering. Post-approval enforcement warfare addressed indirectly through exclusive jurisdiction (§9(gg)(8)) requiring ARB authorization for injunctive relief, which covers retaliatory stop-work orders. |
| R1-F08: Fix "reasonable applicant" standard via analogous-category rule | Adopted in substance through §9(ff)(4)(B) but using analogous-category approach rather than R1's exact formulation. |
| R2-F10: Extend to sub-national applicants (intra-Regional government-to-government) | Outside scope. R2 itself acknowledged this. Voluntary expansion (§9(ii)(6)) allows Regions to extend coverage. |
| R2-F05: Hard cap and Stay stacking | The Stay is a post-constructive-approval safety valve, not an extension of the regular process. Stacking is bounded: hard cap covers pre-approval; Stay covers post-approval emergency review. Total maximum (Tier D): 455 + 104 = 559 days. Acceptable for genuine mega-project emergencies. |
| R1-GV04 full formulation: State/local constructive approval extends to sub-Regional approval | Partially adopted. Sub-Regional entities are covered within the Region's shotclock (§9(ff)(7)(B)), but extending constructive approval to independent sub-Regional approvals raises federalism concerns beyond the scope of this gap. |
