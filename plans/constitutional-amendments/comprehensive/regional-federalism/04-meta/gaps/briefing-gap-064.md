# Gap 64 Briefing: The "Ghost Region" Successor Crisis

## Integration Plan for Key-Holder Continuity Framework

**Date:** 2026-02-06
**Gap:** 64 — The "Ghost Region" Successor Crisis
**Source:** `04-meta/gaps/13-intergovernmental.md` (lines 1194-1362)
**Target:** Article XI-RF, Section 2 (`02-design/constitution/10-armed-forces.md`)
**Index Correction:** Index says "Interstate pollution and externality resolution" — actual gap is "Ghost Region Successor Crisis" (Two-Key Rule denominator manipulation and key-holder succession)

---

## 1. The Problem

The Two-Key Rule (President + Majority of Regional Governors for domestic military deployment) has no provisions for:

- **Fixed denominator**: What happens when Governor positions are vacant or disputed? Does the denominator shrink?
- **Key-holder succession**: Who exercises the Two-Key authority when a Governor dies, is incapacitated, or is disputed?
- **Anti-manipulation**: Can the Federal Executive manipulate which Governors count?
- **Mass incapacity**: What happens if multiple Governors and their succession chains are eliminated simultaneously?

### Gaming Vectors

| Vector | Attack | Consequence |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Denominator Manipulation | Challenge legitimacy of 3 Governors | Shrinks denominator, fewer keys needed |
| Decapitation Strike | Multiple Governors killed/incapacitated | No clear key-holders, federal claims emergency |
| Succession Dispute | Competing Governor claimants | Federal Executive picks preferred claimant |
| Puppet Governor | Federally-backed coup installs ally | Two-Key nominally satisfied, substantively gutted |

## 2. Existing Coverage Analysis

### What §2 Already Covers

| Subsection | Content | Addresses Gap 64? |
|---|---|---|
| §2(d) | Governor refusal of federalization | No — covers refusal, not consent |
| §2(e) | Vacancy successor for *refusal* authority only | **Partial** — succession for refusal only, not for key-holding consent |
| §2(g) | Default Two-Key Authorization | **Gap** — says "majority of Regional Governors" but no fixed denominator |
| §2(h)(1) | 48-hour deemed consent for infrastructure attacks | No — expedited procedure, not succession |
| §2(h)(2) | 5-of-7 supermajority override | No — doesn't address vacancies/disputes |
| §2(h)(3) | Judicial Emergency Key (72hr bridge) | **Partial** — addresses unreachable Governors but not disputed/vacant |
| §2(h)(4) | Anti-brinkmanship | No — addresses policy conditioning, not succession |

### Key Gap: §2(e) vs. Gap 64

§2(e) establishes succession for *refusal* authority under §2(d). But no equivalent succession exists for the *affirmative consent* function under §2(g). A Governor can refuse via successor, but the key-holding consent function has no succession chain. This is the core vulnerability.

## 3. Proposed Constitutional Text

New subsections added to Art XI-RF §2 after the Congressional Key Override subsection (q), under a new header "Key-Holder Continuity Framework." Uses subsection letters (r) through (bb).

### Interaction with Existing Provisions

| New Provision | Interacts With | Relationship |
|---|---|---|
| §2(r-s) Fixed Denominator | §2(g) Two-Key Authorization | Clarifies "majority" calculation |
| §2(s)(3) Judicial Key Clarification | §2(h)(3) Judicial Emergency Key | Explicit: bridge only, not a Governor key |
| §2(t-v) Key-Holder Succession | §2(e) Refusal succession | Extends succession from refusal to consent |
| §2(w) Federal Non-Recognition | §2(h)(4) Anti-Brinkmanship | Prevents different manipulation vector |
| §2(x) Judicial Determination | §2(h)(3) Judicial Emergency Key | Supreme Court for disputes vs. Chief Justice for bridge |
| §2(z) Mass Incapacity | §2(h)(3) Judicial Emergency Key | More severe scenario (full chain failure) |
| §2(bb) Nuclear Exception | Art XI §3 (standalone) | Narrow carve-out with cross-reference |

## 4. Review Findings Incorporated

The following changes were made based on external LLM review:

### High Priority

- **Judicial Emergency Key / Fixed Denominator interaction**: Added §2(s)(3) making explicit that the Judicial Emergency Key is a temporary bridge authorization, does not count as a Governor key, and does not reduce the fixed denominator
- **Dynamic denominator reference**: §2(r)(1) now references "as determined under Article I-RF, Section 4" rather than relying solely on hardcoded number

### Medium Priority

- **Supreme Court instead of "Constitutional Court"**: All references changed to "Supreme Court" for consistency with existing constitutional text
- **Unreachability standard replaces 72-hour absence**: §2(u)(3) now uses "unreachability for forty-eight hours during a pending Two-Key request" instead of physical absence from the Region
- **Anti-puppet scope limited to Two-Key purposes**: §2(y) now explicitly states "For purposes of Two-Key authority under this section" and adds scope-limiting final sentence
- **"Most recently undisputed" tied to Regional certification**: §2(v)(1) and §2(x)(2) now reference "Regional certification of succession order" / "Regional certification records"
- **Chief Justice as last-resort successor**: §2(aa)(4) designates Regional Chief Justice as fallback when all COG-designated successors are unavailable

### Low Priority

- **Mass incapacity interim keys and denominator**: §2(z)(4) explicitly states interim key-holders do not alter the Fixed Denominator
- **Nuclear exception cross-reference**: §2(bb) now cites "consistent with Article XI, Section 3" to prevent overlap/contradiction

## 5. Revised Constitutional Text

### Key-Holder Continuity Framework

*Resolves Gap 64 — The "Ghost Region" Successor Crisis. Prevents denominator manipulation, establishes automatic key-holder succession, bars federal recognition manipulation, and provides continuity protocols for mass incapacity scenarios.*

(r) **Fixed Denominator.** For purposes of the Two-Key Rule under subsection (g):

- (1) The denominator for "Majority of Regional Governors" shall be the total number of established Regions as determined under Article I-RF, Section 4, regardless of vacancies, disputes, or incapacities;
- (2) As of ratification, the denominator is seven (7);
- (3) The denominator changes only upon formal admission or dissolution of a Region pursuant to Article I-RF, Section 4.

(s) **Majority Calculation.** "Majority" means more than half of the fixed denominator:

- (1) Abstentions, vacancies, and incapacities count as non-approvals, not as reductions in the denominator;
- (2) No military deployment may proceed without affirmative approval from the required number of key-holders;
- (3) The Judicial Emergency Key under subsection (h)(3) is a temporary bridge authorization and does not count as a Governor key, does not reduce the fixed denominator, and automatically terminates unless affirmative Governor-key majority consent is obtained within seventy-two (72) hours.

(t) **Key-Holder Succession.** If the Regional Governor is unable to exercise the Two-Key authority due to death, incapacity, vacancy, or dispute:

- (1) **First Successor:** The Lieutenant Governor (or equivalent under Regional law);
- (2) **Second Successor:** The presiding officer of the Regional Legislature;
- (3) **Third Successor:** The Chief Justice of the Regional Supreme Court;
- (4) Each Region's Continuity of Government plan under subsection (aa) may extend this chain to additional designated officials.

(u) **Automatic Activation of Key-Holder Succession.** Succession under subsection (t) is automatic and immediate upon:

- (1) Certified death of the Governor;
- (2) Written certification of incapacity by the Regional Chief Justice and presiding legislative officer;
- (3) Unreachability of the Governor for forty-eight (48) hours during a pending Two-Key authorization request, as certified by the presiding officer of the Regional Legislature;
- (4) Any judicial stay or injunction preventing the Governor from exercising official duties.

(v) **Disputed Succession.** If key-holder succession itself is disputed:

- (1) The most senior undisputed successor in the chain, as determined by the most recent Regional certification of the succession order, exercises the key;
- (2) If all successors are disputed, the key remains "locked" (non-approval) until resolution;
- (3) A locked key counts against deployment under the Fixed Denominator Rule in subsection (r);
- (4) Any party may petition the Supreme Court for expedited determination under subsection (x), which shall be rendered within seventy-two (72) hours.

(w) **Federal Non-Recognition Irrelevant.** The Federal Executive's recognition or non-recognition of a Regional Governor or successor:

- (1) Has no effect on that official's authority to exercise the Two-Key power;
- (2) Is not a defense to unlawful military deployment without proper Governor keys;
- (3) Does not alter the Fixed Denominator or succession order.

(x) **Judicial Determination of Key-Holder Disputes.** Disputes regarding who holds valid key-holder authority:

- (1) Shall be determined by the Supreme Court;
- (2) Pending determination, the most recently undisputed key-holder (or their successor), as reflected in Regional certification records, retains authority;
- (3) The Court shall issue expedited ruling within seventy-two (72) hours during active military deployment requests.

(y) **Anti-Puppet Provisions.** For purposes of Two-Key authority under this section, a Governor or successor installed through:

- (1) Federal military intervention without valid Two-Key approval;
- (2) Coup, insurrection, or unconstitutional removal of predecessor;
- (3) Election certified only by federal authorities over Regional objection;

shall not be recognized as a valid key-holder. The predecessor or their valid successor retains key-holder authority until legitimate succession occurs. This subsection does not affect recognition of such officials for any purpose other than the Two-Key authority.

(z) **Mass Incapacity Protocol.** If three (3) or more Regional Governors and their entire succession chains under subsection (t) are simultaneously incapacitated:

- (1) The Supreme Court shall convene emergency session within twenty-four (24) hours;
- (2) The Court may designate interim key-holders from among Regional officials not in the normal succession chain;
- (3) Interim key-holders serve only until legitimate succession is restored;
- (4) The designation of interim key-holders does not alter the Fixed Denominator under subsection (r).

(aa) **Continuity of Government Integration.** Each Region shall maintain a Continuity of Government plan that:

- (1) Extends the key-holder succession chain to at least five (5) designated officials;
- (2) Ensures geographic dispersal of successors;
- (3) Is filed with the Supreme Court and updated annually;
- (4) Designates the Chief Justice of the Regional Supreme Court as successor of last resort if all designated successors are unavailable.

(bb) **Nuclear/WMD Exception.** Notwithstanding the Two-Key Rule, the President retains sole authority for response to imminent nuclear attack on United Regions territory, consistent with Article XI, Section 3. This exception does not extend to any other military deployment, regardless of emergency characterization.

## 6. Design Questions — Resolved

| Question | Resolution |
|---|---|
| §2(r)(2) hardcodes "seven" | Keep hardcoded with dynamic reference to Art I-RF §4 in §2(r)(1) and explicit update mechanism in §2(r)(3) |
| §2(t) regional variation | "Or equivalent under Regional law" is sufficient; COG plan in §2(aa) extends chain |
| §2(u)(3) absence trigger | Changed to unreachability standard (48hr) tied to pending Two-Key request, certified by legislative presiding officer |
| §2(x) court forum | Supreme Court (not Constitutional Court or ARB) — consistent with existing §2(h)(3) |
| §2(bb) nuclear exception | Cross-references Art XI §3 explicitly to prevent overlap |
| §2(h)(3) interaction | Resolved via §2(s)(3): Judicial Key is temporary bridge, does not count as Governor key |
