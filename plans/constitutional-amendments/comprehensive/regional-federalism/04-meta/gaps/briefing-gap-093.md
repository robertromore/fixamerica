# Gap 93 Briefing: Race to the Bottom — Regional Tax/Subsidy Competition Enforcement

## For Multi-LLM Constitutional Review

---

## 1. Gap Description

**Gap 93** (Category VII: Fiscal Equalization) identifies four gaming vectors through which Regions exploit the equalization system via predatory subsidies:

1. **Tax Base Suppression** — Region offers massive tax credits, industries relocate in, measured capacity declines, equalization formula sends more money to the Region, and other Regions subsidize their own deindustrialization.
2. **Double Dip** — Region gives Company X $500M in credits, revenue falls, equalization partially compensates, so the Region effectively gets a federal subsidy for a private giveaway.
3. **Relocation Bidding War** — Regions compete with escalating subsidies, industries play Regions against each other, total subsidy exceeds efficiency gain, winner's curse dynamic.
4. **Strategic Poverty** — Region deliberately forgoes efficient taxation, appears "poor" on paper, receives equalization transfers as if genuinely disadvantaged.

**Severity:** Medium
**Current status:** Proposal Available

## 2. Existing Constitutional Framework

### What Is Already Constitutionalized (Art X §3)

The core **prevention** framework is comprehensive:

| Subsection | Provision | Gaming Vector Blocked |
|------------|-----------|----------------------|
| §3(f) | Subsidy-Neutrality Adjustment — tax expenditures >2% GDP added back to capacity | Tax Base Suppression, Double Dip |
| §3(g) | Tax Expenditure Reporting — annual disclosure by category, beneficiary, rationale | Tax Base Suppression (transparency) |
| §3(h) | IFC Verification — verify reports, apply adjustments, publish comparisons | All vectors (monitoring) |
| §3(i) | Predatory Subsidy Prohibition — three-part ban (relocation-conditioned, Region-specific, bidding wars) | Relocation Bidding War |
| §3(j) | Relocation Subsidy Definition — three-factor test (references location, new-only, origin-varying) | Relocation Bidding War (definitional) |
| §3(k) | Total Subsidy Ceiling — 5% GDP / 15% revenue, lower applies | All vectors (hard cap) |
| §3(l)-(m) | Minimum Tax Effort + Phantom Revenue — 75% national average floor; shortfall subtracted from transfers | Strategic Poverty |
| §3(n) | Genuine Low Capacity Exception — protects truly disadvantaged Regions from §3(l) | (safety valve) |
| §3(o) | Anti-Haven Fiscal Consequence — >50% below average → deemed average capacity; no new-resident-only incentives | Strategic Poverty, Tax Base Suppression |
| §3(q)-(r) | Residence Standards + Corporate Apportionment — 183-day rule; sales/payroll/assets formula | Residence arbitrage, HQ gaming |

### Enforcement Provisions (Generic)

| Subsection | Provision | Scope |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| §10(a)(1) | Stage 1: Capacity-Based Equalization Adjustment — IFC may adjust capacity; predatory prohibition enforcement; tax expenditure reporting | General enforcement trigger |
| §10(a)(2)-(5) | Stages 2-5: Negligence finding → clawback → solvency suspension → conservatorship → receivership | Escalation path (not subsidy-specific) |
| §16 | Forensic Audit Authority — unannounced audits, perjury for false certification, 3-year Exclusive Domain suspension for falsification | Data integrity |
| §17 | Independent Statistical Trust — statistical fraud = 5-20 year imprisonment, 25% equalization cut for 5 years | Data integrity |
| §11-A | Tax Exportation Prohibition — 25% revenue ceiling on exported taxes, Monopoly Rents finding, escrow/redistribution | Adjacent protection |

### Related Institutional Bodies

| Body | Established | Role for Gap 93 |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| **IFC** (Independent Fiscal Council) | Art X §2 | Verifies tax expenditures, applies subsidy-neutrality, publishes comparisons, certifies tax effort, conducts audits |
| **ARB** (Allocation Review Board) | Art II §7 | Resolves inter-Regional disputes; jurisdiction includes "disputes between Regions concerning allocation of powers" — could hear predation disputes |
| **IST** (Independent Statistical Trust) | Art X §17 | Certifies economic data; fraud penalties |

## 3. The Core Vulnerability: Enforcement Gap

**The problem:** The constitution comprehensively defines what Regions *cannot do* (§3(i)-(k)) and how to *detect* gaming (§3(f)-(h), §16, §17), but does not fully specify what happens when a Region is caught engaging in predatory subsidy competition.

**What the Constitution currently provides:**

- Prohibition exists (§3(i)) ✅
- Definition exists (§3(j)) ✅
- Ceiling exists (§3(k)) ✅
- Detection mechanism exists (§3(g)-(h), §16) ✅
- Generic escalation path exists (§10) ✅

**What the Constitution does NOT provide:**

1. **No affirmative disclosure obligation on relocation.** §3(g) requires annual tax expenditure reporting, but there is no requirement for the *receiving Region* to disclose subsidies *at the point of relocation* — enabling subsidies to be structured to evade annual reporting categories.
2. **No predation petition mechanism.** When a Region loses an industry to predatory subsidies, how does enforcement begin? The ARB has general jurisdiction (Art II §7(g)(1)) but no specific process for predatory subsidy complaints. The IFC has audit authority (§16) but no trigger mechanism for affected Regions.
3. **No specific consequences for predation findings.** §10(a)(1) allows "capacity-based adjustment" — but this merely recalculates equalization. There are no consequences that make predatory behavior costly *beyond* the equalization adjustment already applied by §3(f). A Region caught violating §3(i) faces no penalty; the subsidy-neutrality adjustment just treats it "as if" the revenue were collected.
4. **No consequences for exceeding the subsidy ceiling.** §3(k) sets the 5% GDP / 15% revenue ceiling but does not specify what happens when a Region exceeds it. Contrast with §3(m) (phantom revenue) and §3(o) (anti-haven), which both have explicit consequences. The ceiling is a rule without a penalty.
5. **No whistleblower protection for subsidy manipulation.** §17(f)(5) penalizes retaliation against *IST* whistleblowers. But subsidy gaming may be discovered by Regional officials, IFC auditors, corporate employees, or community members who are not IST personnel. No equivalent safe-harbor exists for subsidy-related whistleblowing.

**The net effect:** A Region violating §3(i) gains the industry, faces subsidy-neutrality adjustment (which it already anticipated and factored in), and pays no additional penalty. The losing Region has no formal complaint mechanism and no path to compensation. The ceiling in §3(k) has no teeth.

## 4. Related Gaps and Overlap Analysis

| Related Gap | Severity | Status | Relationship | Overlap % |
|-------------|----------|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Gap 124 (Internal Tax Haven) | High | **RESOLVED** | Highest overlap — addresses permanent low-tax policy; Gap 93 addresses targeted subsidies conditioned on relocation | 60-70% |
| Gap 107 (Ghost Residency / Capacity Gaming) | Medium | Proposal Available | Same layer (capacity measurement); different vector (residency vs. subsidies) | 35-40% |
| Gap 110 (Equalization Formula Extortion) | Low-Med | Proposal Available | Parallel (formula exploitation); different mechanism (blocking updates) | 20-25% |
| Gap 133 (Strategic Incompetence Cost-Shift) | Medium | Proposal Available | Complementary — cost-side gaming vs. Gap 93's revenue-side gaming | 10-15% |
| Gap 137 (Financial Dumping) | High | Proposal Available | Tangential — similar logic, different domain (debt instruments) | 5-10% |
| Gap 138 (Double-Taxation Barrier) | Medium | Proposal Available | Minimal — worker mobility barriers vs. employer incentives | 5% |

**Key insight:** Gap 124 (RESOLVED) shares 60-70% overlap and was resolved by confirming that §3(f)-(k) and §3(l)-(o) adequately address *tax-policy-based* competition. What Gap 93 adds is the enforcement layer for *subsidy-based* predation — the operational question of "what happens next?" after the prohibition is violated.

**Existing enforcement patterns (templates):**

- **§3(m) Phantom Revenue:** Explicit consequence — shortfall subtracted from equalization transfers
- **§3(o) Anti-Haven:** Explicit consequence — deemed average capacity, enhanced threshold
- **§16(c) Falsification:** Explicit consequence — Exclusive Domain suspended 3 years, federal takeover, reimbursement + penalties
- **§11-A(d) Tax Exportation:** Explicit consequence — escrow, redistribution, IFC rate-setting after 3 years

## 5. Proposed Approach: Add Enforcement Mechanisms to Existing §3 Framework

Add new subsections to Art X §3 (after §3(s), before Section 3-A) that provide enforcement teeth for the existing prohibition, ceiling, and disclosure framework. The approach follows the enforcement patterns already used elsewhere in Article X.

### Proposed Constitutional Additions

**Part A — Relocation Subsidy Disclosure (§3(t)):**

- When a firm relocates between Regions within [timeframe], the receiving Region shall disclose to the IFC all subsidies, tax expenditures, and non-tax incentives provided to that firm
- Disclosure deadline tied to relocation event, not annual reporting cycle
- Failure to disclose: rebuttable presumption that undisclosed subsidies are predatory under §3(i)

**Part B — Predation Petition and Finding (§3(u)-(v)):**

- Standing: Any Region that loses a significant employer to another Region's subsidies may petition the ARB for a predation finding
- IFC role: IFC conducts investigation, prepares factual report, transmits to ARB
- ARB hearing: Expedited process with defined timeline
- Predation finding triggers: Subsidies exceed firm's capital investment; subsidies conditioned on relocation under §3(j); subsidies part of documented bidding war pattern
- Presumptions: Subsidies exceeding capital investment are presumptively predatory (rebuttable)

**Part C — Predation Finding Consequences (§3(w)):**

- The predating Region's equalization eligibility is reduced by the subsidy amount for [3 years?]
- The predating Region shall compensate the losing Region for documented transition costs (unemployment, tax base loss, infrastructure stranding)
- The firm receiving the predatory subsidy shall repay the amount exceeding legitimate incentive
- Deduction is in addition to (not duplicative of) the subsidy-neutrality adjustment under §3(f)

**Part D — Subsidy Ceiling Enforcement (§3(x)):**

- Regions exceeding the §3(k) ceiling: excess amount deducted from equalization eligibility
- Two-year compliance period to reduce subsidies to ceiling level
- New subsidy programs prohibited until compliance achieved
- Emergency exception for certified economic emergencies (recession, natural disaster)

**Part E — Whistleblower Protection (§3(y)):**

- Protection for any person reporting suspected predatory subsidy activity, equalization manipulation, or subsidy ceiling violations
- Covers Regional officials, IFC/ARB auditors, corporate employees, and community members
- Anti-retaliation: employment protection, anonymity, and treble damages for retaliation
- Cross-reference to §17(f)(5) IST protections (extend same model)

## 6. Design Questions for Reviewers

### D1: Placement

Should new enforcement provisions be added as additional subsections within §3 (as §3(t)-(y) after existing §3(s)), or as a new Section 3-B?

- **Option A:** Expand §3 directly (§3(t)-(y)) — keeps all equalization anti-gaming provisions in one section; continues existing pattern
- **Option B:** New Section 3-B ("Equalization Enforcement") — separates prohibition (§3) from enforcement (§3-B); avoids further extending an already long section

### D2: Relocation Disclosure Trigger

What triggers the affirmative disclosure obligation?

- **Option A:** Any firm relocation between Regions where the firm received any subsidy or incentive — broad but potentially burdensome
- **Option B:** Firm relocation where cumulative subsidies exceed a threshold (e.g., $10M or 0.01% of Regional GDP) — targeted to significant cases
- **Option C:** IFC-initiated disclosure demand upon relocation pattern detection — reactive rather than mandatory

### D3: Disclosure Failure Consequences

What happens if a Region fails to disclose subsidies upon firm relocation?

- **Option A:** Rebuttable presumption of predation under §3(i) — shifts burden of proof to receiving Region
- **Option B:** Automatic referral to ARB for investigation — process-based, not presumptive
- **Option C:** Enhanced IFC audit authority for the non-disclosing Region — monitoring-based

### D4: Predation Petition Standing

Who may petition the ARB for a predation finding?

- **Option A:** Any affected Region (lost significant employer) — narrow, government-to-government
- **Option B:** Any affected Region OR the IFC acting sua sponte — adds regulatory initiation
- **Option C:** Any affected Region, the IFC, OR affected workers/communities — broadest standing

### D5: Predation Finding Consequences — Duration and Severity

How severe should consequences be for a predation finding?

- **Option A (Strong):** Subsidy amount deducted from equalization for 3 years + transition cost compensation + firm repayment — the original proposal
- **Option B (Moderate):** Subsidy amount deducted for 2 years + transition cost compensation — no firm repayment (may be unenforceable against private parties)
- **Option C (Mild):** Enhanced capacity-based adjustment (§3(f) applied at penalty rate) for 2 years — builds on existing mechanism rather than creating new penalty

### D6: Subsidy Ceiling Enforcement Model

How should §3(k) ceiling violations be enforced?

- **Option A (§3(o) pattern):** Excess deducted from equalization + new subsidy programs frozen until compliance — mirrors anti-haven consequences
- **Option B (§11-A(d) pattern):** Excess placed in escrow and redistributed to affected Regions — mirrors tax exportation remedy
- **Option C (§10 integration):** Ceiling violation triggers Stage 2 (Negligence Finding) in the intervention hierarchy — uses existing escalation ladder

### D7: Whistleblower Protection Scope

Should whistleblower protection be specific to subsidy manipulation, or broader?

- **Option A (Broad — new §3(y)):** Cover all equalization-related manipulation (subsidies, tax effort, capacity reporting, ceiling compliance) — comprehensive
- **Option B (Narrow):** Cover only predatory subsidy reporting — targeted to Gap 93
- **Option C (Extend §17(f)):** Amend existing IST whistleblower protections in §17(f)(5) to cover all fiscal integrity reporting — one-line amendment rather than new subsection

### D8: Non-Aggression Compact Framework

Should the voluntary non-aggression compact framework be constitutionalized?

- **Option A:** Constitutional authorization for Regions to enter subsidy-limitation compacts — elevates the concept but keeps details statutory
- **Option B:** Leave entirely statutory — Congress and Regions can create compacts under existing Art I §5 compact authority
- **Option C:** Constitutional encouragement clause (precatory) — signals intent without creating enforceable right

### D9: Firm Repayment Enforceability

Should the constitution require firms to repay predatory subsidies?

- **Option A:** Yes — firms receiving subsidies found predatory shall repay amounts exceeding legitimate incentive; enforceable by the losing Region or IFC
- **Option B:** No — constitutional enforcement against private parties is problematic; leave to statutory/contractual remedies; focus constitutional consequences on the predating Region
- **Option C:** Conditional — firm repayment applies only if the firm was a knowing participant in the predatory scheme (knowledge standard)

## 7. Gaming Vectors

| # | Vector | Mechanism | Severity | Addressed By |
|---|--------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| G1 | Subsidy structuring | Structure subsidies to evade §3(j) three-factor test (e.g., "generally available" programs designed for one firm) | High | Relocation disclosure + IFC audit |
| G2 | Delayed relocation | Firm receives subsidy, waits beyond disclosure window to relocate | Medium | Disclosure trigger design (D2) |
| G3 | Subsidiary shell game | Firm creates new subsidiary in receiving Region rather than "relocating" | Medium | Functional relocation definition |
| G4 | Ceiling evasion via non-tax subsidies | Provide subsidies through infrastructure, land grants, workforce training rather than tax expenditures | Medium | Existing §3(k) covers "direct subsidies" — may need explicit enumeration |
| G5 | Retaliatory predation finding | Region files frivolous petition to harass competitor Region | Low | ARB screening + cooling-off after failed petition |
| G6 | Predation finding evasion via timing | Region structures subsidies across fiscal years to stay below detection thresholds | Medium | IFC multi-year analysis authority |
| G7 | Whistleblower weaponization | Bad-faith whistleblower reports to disrupt economic development | Low | ARB/IFC screening for frivolous reports |
| G8 | Emergency exception abuse | Declare "economic emergency" to bypass ceiling enforcement | Medium | Certification requirement (who certifies?) |

## 8. Constraints

1. **Art X §3(f)-(s) is authoritative.** New text must complement, not contradict, the existing subsidy-neutrality, predatory prohibition, ceiling, and tax effort provisions.
2. **Art X §10 is occupied.** The fiscal intervention hierarchy (5-stage escalation) should not be disrupted. New enforcement can reference §10 or add specific triggers but should not restructure the ladder.
3. **Art X §16-§17 are occupied.** Forensic audit and IST provisions should not be duplicated. Cross-reference where appropriate.
4. **Art X §11-A is occupied.** Tax exportation prohibition has its own enforcement model (escrow/redistribution). New enforcement should be compatible but distinct.
5. **Gap 124 is RESOLVED.** Tax-policy-based competition (permanent low rates, zero-tax havens) is covered. New text targets subsidy-based predation enforcement specifically.
6. **Gap 107, 110, 133 remain PROPOSAL AVAILABLE.** New text should not foreclose their future resolution. Check for compatibility.
7. **The original four-part proposal is partially integrated.** Parts 1 (subsidy-neutrality) and 3 (ceiling) are substantially in place. Part 4 (non-aggression compacts, federal coordination) may be appropriately statutory. The work concentrates on Part 2 (enforcement) plus ceiling enforcement and whistleblower protection.
8. **ARB jurisdiction exists but is generic.** Art II §7(g)(1) gives the ARB jurisdiction over "disputes between Regions concerning allocation of powers." Predatory subsidy disputes arguably fall within this, but an explicit grant or cross-reference would eliminate ambiguity.

## 9. Reviewer Instructions

Please evaluate:

1. Whether the proposed approach (adding enforcement mechanisms to the existing §3 prohibition/ceiling framework) is the right strategy for Gap 93, or whether the existing provisions plus the generic §10 escalation ladder are sufficient and the gap should be reclassified.
2. For each design question (D1-D9), recommend an option with reasoning.
3. Identify any gaming vectors missed or any that are over-weighted.
4. Flag any interactions with existing constitutional text that could create conflicts.
5. Assess whether the proposed additions would create over-rigidity or impose disproportionate administrative burden relative to the Medium severity rating.
6. Consider whether some elements (particularly D8 non-aggression compacts and D9 firm repayment) should remain statutory rather than constitutional.
