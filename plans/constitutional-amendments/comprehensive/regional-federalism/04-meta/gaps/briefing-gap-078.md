# Briefing: Gap 78 — Asymmetric "Rights Floor" Regulatory Arbitrage

## For External LLM Review

---

## 1. Context

This briefing supports multi-LLM review of Gap 78 in the Regional Federal Constitutional system. The constitution establishes "floors, not ceilings" (Art XVIII §2) — Regions may exceed federal standards but not go below them. Gap 78 concerns Regions adopting technically "higher" standards that are mutually incompatible, creating de facto trade barriers under the guise of exceeding protections.

**Gap Severity:** Medium | **Status:** Proposal Available | **Theme:** Intergovernmental

---

## 2. The Problem

Art XVIII §2 states: "Rights and standards shall be construed as floors unless explicitly stated otherwise." This permits Regions to adopt unlimited "higher" standards. Four gaming vectors were identified:

1. **"Incompatible Excellence" Barrier** — Two Regions adopt mutually incompatible EV charging standards, both "exceeding" the federal floor; EVs cannot charge across Regions
2. **"Professional Credential Fork"** — Two Regions require different 1,000-hour Region-specific coursework, both "exceeding" the federal floor; neither recognizes the other
3. **"Environmental Excellence" Fragmentation** — Two Regions require mutually exclusive technologies (different catalytic converter types) to exceed the same emissions standard
4. **"Consumer Protection" Product Ban** — Region sets "higher" product safety standard only locally-made products meet; facially about safety, functionally protectionist

## 3. Overlap Analysis (~80-85%)

### 3.1 Already Covered (DO NOT DUPLICATE)

| Provision | Location | Coverage |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Infrastructure interoperability mandate — no Region may adopt standards creating material barriers to energy transit, goods movement, credential portability, or telecom interconnection | Art II §4(l) in `02-powers-and-rights.md` | COVERS gaming vector 1 for infrastructure categories |
| Critical infrastructure definition (electric power, rail, highways, digital identity, telecom, pipelines) + NIST expandable | Art II §4(m) | Defines scope of infrastructure interoperability |
| Material barrier standard — quantified thresholds (5% cost, 2-hour freight delay, etc.) + cumulative 36-month pattern | Art II §4(n) | MORE DEVELOPED than Gap 78 Part 1 |
| Federal interoperability floors — NIST establishes minimum interoperability standards per infrastructure category | Art II §4(o) | IDENTICAL to Gap 78 concept of ensuring federal-floor products function |
| Regional innovation within floors — must maintain backward compatibility + no additional burden on interstate users | Art II §4(p) | EXCEEDS Gap 78 Part 1 (Gap 78 allows 5% adaptation; §4(p) requires zero additional burden) |
| Pre-implementation NIST certification — 120-day review, Technical Impact Assessment, deemed certification with provisional status | Art II §4(q) | MORE DEVELOPED than Gap 78 Part 2 (60-day ARB review) |
| Enforcement — 180-day remediation, compensation, federal takeover, repeat offender designation, treble damages for bad faith | Art II §4(r) | MORE DEVELOPED than Gap 78 Part 2 |
| Anti-circumvention — prohibited strategies (innovation/security pretexts), standards arms race presumption, proprietary mandate prohibition, open standards requirement | Art II §4(s) | EXCEEDS Gap 78 (no anti-circumvention in proposal) |
| Permanence — interoperability mandate inviolable, not subject to sunset or variance | Art II §4(s)(4) | NOT IN Gap 78 |
| Professional credential recognition — presumption of competency, Essential for Public Safety standard, ARB pre-approval, automatic recognition on ARB inaction | Art I §9(g)-(o) in `01-regional-structure.md` | COVERS gaming vector 2 for credentials |
| Divergence Declaration mechanism — formal mechanism with legislative approval, bridge pathway (60-day/1% wage), 5-year sunset, cumulative barrier prohibition | Art I §9(jj) [Gap 50] | EXCEEDS Gap 78 Part 3 for credentials |
| Market entry disparity standard — presumptive invalidity if >20% above national median, critical shortage standard, private right of action | Art I §9(kk) [Gap 50] | NOT IN Gap 78 |
| Prohibited justifications — "higher standards," economic impact, Region-specific knowledge | Art I §9(i) | IDENTICAL to Gap 78 Part 1(d) |
| Pretextual resource regulation prevention — certification before enforcing resource-restrictive environmental standards, 4-part proportionality test, pretext finding | Art I §11(k)-(m) | PARTIAL coverage of gaming vector 3 (for resource-restrictive standards only) |
| Right of transit — non-blockade, genuine safety necessity standard, treble damages for bad faith, repeat offender, NITS transparency | Art I §6 | ENFORCEMENT FRAMEWORK precedent |
| Anti-social-dumping — prohibition on competitive advantage via lower labor/safety standards | Art II §4(j)-(k) | Related anti-arbitrage |

### 3.2 Elements Where Proposal is WEAKER Than Existing Law

| Proposal Element | Existing Law | Issue |
|------------------|-------------|-------|
| 60-day ARB pre-implementation review (Part 2(f)) | Art II §4(q): 120-day NIST certification with Technical Impact Assessment | Proposal's timeline too short for technical standards review |
| $5,000 adaptation pathway cap (Part 3(j)(ii)) | Art I §9(jj)(2)(D): 1% of Regional median annual wage + 60-day timeline | Proposal uses fixed dollar amount; existing law uses relative measure |
| ARB as reviewing body (Part 2(e)) | Art II §4(q): NIST as certifier with ARB as enforcer | NIST has technical expertise; ARB handles arbitration |
| 90-day automatic approval (Part 2(g)(iii)) | Art II §4(q)(3): 90-day deemed certification with 180-day provisional period | Existing law adds provisional oversight period |

### 3.3 Genuinely Additive Elements (~15-20%)

| Element | Why Additive | Notes |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| **Non-infrastructure product standards interoperability** | Art II §4(l)-(s) covers only "Critical Infrastructure" as defined in §4(m). General product standards (consumer goods, manufacturing, environmental compliance for products) are NOT covered | Main additive element |
| **Environmental product compatibility** | Art I §11(k)-(m) covers resource-restrictive standards only, not product-manufacturing standards (e.g., different catalytic converter types) | Gaming vector 3 partially uncovered |
| **Equivalency presumption for products** | Art I §9 has presumption for credentials; no parallel for products/services meeting any above-floor standard | Extends credential pattern to products |
| **General harmonization authority** | Art II §4(h) has harmonization for infrastructure incompatibilities; no equivalent for non-infrastructure standards | If non-infrastructure standards fragment |
| **National Standards Registry for non-infrastructure** | NITS covers infrastructure; no general registry for product/service/environmental standards | Transparency gap |

---

## 4. Placement Analysis

### 4.1 Proposed Placement (INCORRECT)

The proposal targets Art III, Section 9(a)-(l). This is WRONG because:

- Art III §9 is **occupied** — it is "Remedial Supremacy" (resolves Gap 66), addressing state civil law frustration of higher-jurisdiction enforcement
- Art III is "Rights Floors and Subsidiarity" — wrong topical home for market interoperability standards
- Most proposed elements already exist in Art II §4(l)-(s) and Art I §9

### 4.2 Corrected Placement Options

**For Non-Infrastructure Product/Service Standards Interoperability:**

| Option | Location | Rationale |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| A | Extend Art II §4 — add subsections after §4(s) in `02-powers-and-rights.md` | Keeps ALL interoperability provisions together; extends existing infrastructure framework to general products/services; leverages existing NIST/ARB enforcement structure |
| B | New Art I §11-A in `01-regional-structure.md` | Adjacent to Environmental Border Protection and National Common Market; separate section for product/service market interoperability |
| C | Amend Art XVIII §2 in `06-supremacy.md` | Add interoperability clause to "floors not ceilings" — conceptually elegant but wrong level (too fundamental for procedural details) |

## 5. Key Interactions and Collisions

### 5.1 Art II §4(l)-(s) Boundary Question

Art II §4(m) defines "Critical Infrastructure" as a closed list (electric power, rail, highways, digital identity, telecom, pipelines) with NIST expansion authority. Gap 78's product standards scenarios (EV charging connectors, catalytic converters, consumer products) may or may not fall within this definition:

- EV charging → arguably "electric power... distribution systems" under §4(m)(1)
- Catalytic converters → NOT infrastructure
- Consumer products → NOT infrastructure
- Environmental compliance standards for manufactured goods → NOT infrastructure

**INTERACTION**: If Gap 78 is placed at Art II §4(t)-(x), the relationship to §4(l)-(s) must be explicitly defined. Products vs. infrastructure boundary must be clear.

### 5.2 Art I §9 vs. Gap 78 for Credential-as-Product-Standard

Gap 78 Part 3(l) identifies the scenario: "only Region-certified engineers may design products sold in Region." This crosses from credential recognition (§9) into product market access (Gap 78). The existing credential framework addresses the engineer's right to practice but NOT the product market access barrier created by the credential-as-gatekeeping mechanism.

### 5.3 Art I §11(c) vs. Gap 78

Art I §11(c): "Jurisdictions may establish more protective standards provided they do not discriminate against interstate commerce." This is the general anti-discrimination principle. Gap 78 argues that facially non-discriminatory but functionally incompatible standards can evade this test. The question is whether §11(c) already covers functional incompatibility or whether "discriminate" is read narrowly (facial discrimination only).

### 5.4 NIST vs. ARB Jurisdiction

Art II §4(l)-(s) uses **NIST** for technical certification and **ARB** for enforcement/disputes. Gap 78's proposal assigns everything to the **ARB**. For non-infrastructure product standards, the question is whether NIST has appropriate jurisdiction or whether a different body (e.g., FDA for consumer products, EPA for environmental standards) should certify.

### 5.5 Gap 50 (Safety Add-On) Interaction

Gap 50's resolution (Art I §9(jj)-(mm)) created the most developed anti-protectionism framework in the constitution — for LABOR mobility. The Market Entry Disparity Standard (§9(kk)) uses RPPP-adjusted national median comparisons and presumptive invalidity thresholds. Gap 78 should adopt parallel structures for PRODUCT/SERVICE market entry.

## 6. Gaming Vectors (Post-Overlap Residual)

These are risks NOT addressed by existing provisions:

1. **"Clean Air Converter Lock-In"** — Region requires specific catalytic converter technology to exceed federal emissions standard. Not "Critical Infrastructure" under §4(m). Not resource-restrictive under §11(k). Product cannot be sold in Region without Region-specific conversion. Art I §11(c) "do not discriminate against interstate commerce" may not catch facially neutral technical requirement.

2. **"Organic Plus" Product Fragmentation** — Region creates "Organic Plus" food standard exceeding federal organic standard. Requires Region-specific certification process. Products meeting federal organic OR other Regions' enhanced organic cannot use "Organic Plus" label, effectively excluding them from premium market segments.

3. **"Building Code Balkanization"** — Region adopts building code with unique material requirements (e.g., specific seismic standards exceeding federal floor using proprietary technology). Builders cannot use standard materials. Not "Critical Infrastructure" (buildings aren't in §4(m) list).

4. **"Insurance Compatibility Wall"** — Region requires specific insurance coverage type that only in-Region insurers offer. Products/services from other Regions cannot obtain necessary coverage. Not a credential issue (§9); not infrastructure (§4(l)-(s)).

5. **"Testing and Certification Monopoly"** — Region requires product testing by Region-accredited labs only. Federal-floor products pass testing; but Region-specific testing is available only from one lab with 6-month backlog. Functional market exclusion without facial discrimination.

6. **"Compounding Standards Creep"** — Region adds small incremental product requirements every 6 months, none individually meeting any threshold, but cumulatively creating barrier. Art II §4(n)(5) has 36-month cumulative pattern provision — but ONLY for Critical Infrastructure.

7. **"Environmental Excellence as Trade Barrier"** — Region adopts genuinely environmentally beneficial standard that incidentally (but predictably) excludes all out-of-Region manufactured goods. Legitimate environmental purpose but protectionist effect. Art I §11(k) only covers "resource-restrictive" standards, not general environmental standards for products.

8. **"Digital Service Fragmentation"** — Region requires specific data format, API standard, or privacy compliance framework for digital services. Not "Critical Infrastructure" telecommunications under §4(m)(5) because it's application-layer, not network-layer. Different Regions require incompatible compliance frameworks.

## 7. Design Questions

**D1: Placement of non-infrastructure product/service interoperability**
- A: Extend Art II §4 after §4(s) — keep all interoperability together
- B: New Art I §11-A — adjacent to environmental and common market provisions
- C: New Art III §11 — in rights floors article (maintains Gap 78's conceptual framing)

**D2: Scope — which standards categories should be covered?**
- A: All Regional standards exceeding federal floors (broadest)
- B: Product, service, and environmental standards only (exclude professional credentials, already covered by §9)
- C: Only standards with demonstrated inter-Regional trade impact (narrowest; requires showing market effect)

**D3: Certification body for non-infrastructure standards**
- A: NIST (consistent with §4(q); technical expertise but limited product-standard jurisdiction)
- B: ARB (as proposed; broad jurisdiction but no technical expertise)
- C: Domain-specific agencies (EPA for environmental, FDA for consumer products, etc.) with ARB as appellate
- D: NIST for technical interoperability + domain agencies for safety adequacy + ARB for disputes

**D4: Interoperability standard — how strict?**
- A: Full backward compatibility (§4(p) pattern) — federal-floor products must function without ANY modification
- B: Reasonable adaptation pathway (Gap 78 proposal) — up to $5,000 and 30 days
- C: Material barrier standard (§4(n) pattern) — quantified thresholds for cost/delay
- D: Equivalency presumption only — products meeting any above-floor standard presumptively equivalent; burden on excluding Region

**D5: Pre-implementation review**
- A: Mandatory NIST/agency certification before implementation (§4(q) pattern)
- B: Notice-and-comment with ARB stay authority (Gap 78 proposal)
- C: Post-implementation review only (lighter touch; Region may implement, subject to challenge)
- D: Hybrid — mandatory certification for standards exceeding material barrier threshold; post-implementation review otherwise

**D6: Harmonization authority for non-infrastructure standards**
- A: ARB harmonization with 180-day deadline and interim requirements (as proposed)
- B: Domain-specific agencies convene harmonization with ARB backstop
- C: No federal harmonization — equivalency presumption and market forces resolve
- D: Congressional authority to mandate harmonization for specific product categories

**D7: Cumulative barrier provision**
- A: Extend §4(n)(5) pattern — 36-month cumulative pattern provision applies to all standards
- B: Separate threshold for non-infrastructure (longer lookback, different metrics)
- C: Not needed — individual standard review sufficient

**D8: Relationship to Art II §4(l)-(s)**
- A: Cross-reference — new provisions supplement §4(l)-(s) for non-infrastructure categories; §4(l)-(s) framework controls for infrastructure
- B: Unified framework — amend §4(l)-(s) to expand scope beyond Critical Infrastructure
- C: Separate framework — distinct standards and enforcement for product/service vs. infrastructure

## 8. Verification Questions

V1: Does Art II §4(m) "Critical Infrastructure" definition cover EV charging standards? (Electric power distribution under §4(m)(1)?)

V2: Does Art I §11(c) "do not discriminate against interstate commerce" currently cover facially neutral but functionally incompatible standards, or only facial discrimination?

V3: Can NIST's expansion authority under §4(m) last paragraph ("add categories by regulation") expand Critical Infrastructure to cover consumer products, environmental compliance, or building codes?

V4: Does Art I §11(k) "resource-restrictive environmental standard" cover general environmental product standards (catalytic converters), or only standards restricting resource extraction/transfer?

V5: Does the Gap 50 Market Entry Disparity Standard (§9(kk)) apply to product market entry or only labor/credential market entry?

## 9. Related Resolved Gaps

| Gap | Relevance |
|-----|-----------|
| 92 | "Technical Standards" as de facto Secession — source of Art II §4(l)-(s); infrastructure interoperability mandate |
| 116 | "Administrative Veto" via Technical Standard-Setting — co-source of Art II §4(l)-(s) |
| 65 | Credentialing Protectionism — source of Art I §9(g)-(o); credential recognition framework |
| 50 | Safety Add-On Protectionism Trap — source of Art I §9(jj)-(mm); Divergence Declaration, market entry disparity |
| 66 | Remedial Supremacy — occupies Art III §9; NOT available for Gap 78 |

## 10. Instructions for Reviewer

1. Evaluate the overlap analysis. Is ~80-85% accurate? Are there provisions I missed?
2. Assess each additive element: Is it genuinely needed given existing coverage?
3. Identify additional gaming vectors not listed — particularly for non-infrastructure product/service standards
4. Provide D1-D8 recommendations with rationale
5. Flag any collisions or interactions with existing provisions
6. Assess whether NIST's §4(m) expansion authority makes product standards a subset of infrastructure interoperability (rendering Gap 78 less additive)
7. Note: The proposal placement at Art III §9 is WRONG — §9 is occupied by Remedial Supremacy. Evaluate corrected placement options.
8. Consider whether the "Environmental Excellence" gaming vector (vector 7) requires special treatment given Art I §11's existing environmental provisions
