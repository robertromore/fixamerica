## 1. Problem Statement

The Constitution establishes a Supreme Court of nine Justices with 18-year staggered terms (Art XIV §1, Art III-RF §5). The President appoints with Senate confirmation. A coalition of 4 aligned Regions controlling the Presidency and Senate could systematically appoint only Justices from their own Regions. Over 3-4 Presidential terms (12-16 years), the Court becomes composed entirely of jurists from coalition Regions who rule systematically in favor of those Regions in inter-Regional disputes. The excluded Regions (3 of 7) view the Court as a hostile partisan body and eventually stop complying with adverse rulings — soft secession through judicial non-recognition.

The Regional Federalism framework dramatically increases the stakes of Supreme Court composition. The Court decides power-allocation disputes (Art II §7 appeals), equalization formula challenges (Art X), Regional boundary disputes, and federal floor interpretation (Art XIV-RF §3). A geographically captured Court could systematically favor its home Regions across all these domains.

Art III-RF §5(g) already states: "The Regional Diversity requirement for Supreme Court composition (Article III-RF, Section 1) remains in effect." **That Section 1 was never written.** The constitution was designed with this provision in mind — the cross-reference exists, but the substance is missing.

## 2. Existing Provisions (Overlap ~30-35%, LOW-MODERATE)

### 2.1 Provisions that provide infrastructure

| Provision | What it covers | What it misses |
|---|---|---|
| **Art XIV §1** — Court Structure | 9 Justices locked; no statutory court-packing; en banc requirement | No geographic composition requirement |
| **Art III-RF §5** — Term Reform | 18-year terms; staggered vacancies (one every 2 years); two appointments per Presidential term | No Regional seat allocation; regular vacancies create opportunity for geographic capture if no diversity mandate |
| **Art III-RF §5(g)** — Regional Diversity Reference | Explicitly states "The Regional Diversity requirement for Supreme Court composition (Article III-RF, Section 1) remains in effect" | **THE REFERENCED PROVISION DOES NOT EXIST** — constitutional TODO |
| **Art XIV §14** — Judicial Nominating Commissions | Regional commissions submit lists of 3+ candidates; President must select from list; auto-nomination after 60-day inaction; diversity monitoring | Commissions operate at Regional level but no mandate that SCOTUS seats be allocated by Region |
| **Art XIV §14(d)** — Diversity Monitoring | Judicial Conference monitors vacancy duration and nomination patterns; auto-acceleration if vacancies exceed 50% | Applies to lower courts; not explicitly extended to SCOTUS geographic diversity |
| **Art IV §4-B** — Confirmation Procedures | 90-day mandatory vote; deemed confirmation; simple majority; no filibuster | Prevents blocking but cannot prevent geographic stacking through legitimate confirmations |
| **Art IV §4-C(h)** — Temporary Judicial Officers | 180-day limit on temporary judges | Prevents circumventing confirmation but not geographic capture |
| **Art II §7(b)-(d)** — ARB Composition Model | Party balance (no more than 4 of same party); experience diversity; geographic component (Regional Governors elect 2 members, no self-voting) | Model exists but is NOT applied to the Supreme Court |
| **Art III-RF §5(c)** — Appointment Timing | President nominates within 30 days of scheduled vacancy; Senate hearings and vote within 90 days | Timing is covered; geographic requirement is not |

### 2.2 The §5(g) cross-reference gap

Art III-RF §5(g) reads: "The Regional Diversity requirement for Supreme Court composition (Article III-RF, Section 1) remains in effect. The 18-year term ensures each Region's seat rotates more frequently than under life tenure."

This cross-reference establishes three facts:

1. The drafters intended a Regional Diversity requirement for the Supreme Court
2. The requirement was meant to allocate seats by Region ("each Region's seat")
3. The 18-year term system was designed to work WITH Regional seat allocation

The new provision fulfills this cross-reference. The natural placement is Art III-RF §5-A (between §5 Term Reform and §6 Trial Penalty Prohibition), with §5(g) updated to reference §5-A.

## 3. Proposed Placement

### Primary option: Art III-RF §5-A (Supreme Court Regional Diversity)

- Art III-RF §5 already contains SCOTUS structural reforms
- §5(g) already cross-references a Regional Diversity requirement
- §5-A sits naturally between §5 (Term Reform) and §6 (Trial Penalty)
- Fulfills the phantom §5(g) cross-reference
- All SCOTUS structural provisions consolidated in Art III-RF §5/§5-A

### Alternative A: Art XIV §1 expansion (standalone judicial reform)

- Pro: Adds diversity requirement to the provision that locks Court size at 9
- Con: Art XIV is the standalone judicial reform (works with or without Regional Federalism); geographic diversity is specifically Regional Federalism

### Alternative B: Art XIV §14 expansion (nominating commissions)

- Pro: Integrates diversity mandate with the nomination mechanism
- Con: Nominating commissions are about process; Regional seat allocation is about structure

### Recommendation: Art III-RF §5-A — Supreme Court Regional Diversity

Fulfills the §5(g) cross-reference. Keeps all SCOTUS structural provisions together. Coordinates with §5 term reform (staggered vacancies), Art XIV §14 (nominating commissions), and Art IV §4-B (confirmation procedures).

## 4. Design Questions

### D1. Should the framework use fixed Regional seats (7 Regional + 2 at-large) or a formula?

The proposal allocates 7 seats to Regions and 2 at-large. But the number of Regions may change (Art XX allows boundary adjustments; Art XXI allows new Regions). Options:

- (A) **Fixed: 7 Regional + 2 at-large** — as proposed; clear and simple; requires amendment if Region count changes
- (B) **Formula: one seat per Region, remainder at-large** — scales automatically; currently 7+2, but if Regions increase to 8, becomes 8+1; at 9 Regions, all seats are Regional
- (C) **Formula with minimum at-large: one seat per Region, at least 1 at-large, Court size adjusts** — guarantees geographic coverage AND flexibility; but changes Court size (which Art XIV §1 locks at 9)
- (D) **Supermajority of seats Regional: at least 2/3 of Justices must satisfy Regional diversity** — 6 of 9 must be from different Regions; remaining 3 are at-large

### D2. What domicile standard prevents gaming?

The proposal requires 5 years continuous residence OR birth + 10 cumulative years. Consider:

- (A) **5-year continuous** — as proposed; prevents last-minute relocation; but a 5-year plan to qualify is feasible
- (B) **10-year continuous** — stronger anti-gaming; but limits the eligible pool significantly; may exclude genuinely qualified candidates who recently relocated
- (C) **Birth + cumulative years** — alternative path for people born in a Region who left and returned; but "birth" is arbitrary (parents' location at time of birth)
- (D) **Primary professional practice** — 10 years of primary legal/judicial practice in the Region; harder to game; directly relevant to judicial expertise
- (E) **Combination: 5-year continuous PLUS primary professional practice in the Region for 10+ years** — two independent requirements; very hard to game

### D3. How should Regional seats interact with the Judicial Nominating Commission system?

Art XIV §14 already establishes Regional nominating commissions that submit candidate lists. Options:

- (A) **Commission controls the list** — when a Regional seat is vacant, the commission for THAT Region submits candidates; President must select from the list; auto-nomination after 60 days (extends existing §14 mechanism)
- (B) **Commission advises, President selects** — commission submits list from the Region; President may select from list or nominate any qualified person domiciled in the Region; weakens commission role but preserves Presidential prerogative
- (C) **Multiple commissions submit** — the affected Region's commission submits primary list; other Regions' commissions may submit supplemental recommendations; broadens pool while maintaining Regional focus
- (D) **Governor submits after Presidential inaction** — as proposed: 90-day Presidential deadline; Governor submits 3 nominees; President must select from Governor's list or nominate alternative from Region within 60 days

### D4. How should at-large seats be constrained?

The proposal restricts at-large Justices from sharing domicile with each other, the Chief Justice, or the most recently confirmed Regional Justice. Options:

- (A) **No two at-large from same Region** — simplest restriction; prevents stacking
- (B) **At-large may not duplicate any sitting Regional Justice's Region** — stronger; ensures at-large seats add diversity rather than reinforcing existing Regions
- (C) **At-large seats unrestricted** — relies on political norms; no constitutional mandate
- (D) **At-large seats filled by different mechanism** — e.g., Judicial Conference recommendation rather than Presidential appointment; insulates from geographic politics

### D5. How should vacancies for Regional seats be filled?

The proposal gives the President 90 days to nominate from the Region, then the Governor submits nominees. Consider interaction with §5 staggered terms and §4-B confirmation:

- (A) **As proposed** — 90-day Presidential deadline; Governor submits 3 nominees; President selects or nominates alternative from Region within 60 days
- (B) **Integrate with Art XIV §14** — when Regional seat vacates, that Region's Judicial Nominating Commission submits list; standard §14 process applies (President selects from list; auto-nomination after 60 days)
- (C) **Dual path** — both the commission and the Governor may submit candidates; President selects from either list
- (D) **Commission primary, Governor fallback** — commission submits list under §14; if President fails to nominate, Governor's nominees as secondary fallback

### D6. Should the Chief Justice designation be constrained by Regional diversity?

Art III-RF §5(h) says the President designates the Chief Justice from among sitting Justices. Should diversity apply?

- (A) **No constraint** — any sitting Justice may be designated Chief; Regional seat assignment is sufficient
- (B) **Rotation preference** — Chief Justice should not be from the same Region as the most recent Chief; soft constraint
- (C) **No same-Region consecutive Chiefs** — hard constraint; ensures rotation
- (D) **Chief Justice from at-large seat only** — insulates the Chief from Regional association; but limits the pool to 2 of 9 Justices

### D7. How should the transition from current Court work?

The proposal assigns sitting Justices to Regional or at-large seats based on current domicile. But current Justices were not appointed with Regional diversity in mind. Options:

- (A) **As proposed** — assign based on domicile at ratification; most senior gets Regional seat if duplicates; others become at-large; future vacancies follow diversity rules
- (B) **Prospective only** — diversity requirement applies only to vacancies occurring after ratification; no reassignment of current Justices
- (C) **Gradual implementation** — diversity requirement becomes mandatory only after all 9 seats have turned over (could be up to 18 years)
- (D) **Hybrid** — assign existing Justices by domicile (prospective labeling); diversity requirement is "should" for next 18 years, then "shall" (hard mandate); allows transition without immediately constraining nominations

### D8. Should there be a "genuine connection" standard beyond domicile?

The proposal prohibits "nominal domicile established primarily to satisfy this requirement." But enforcement is difficult. Options:

- (A) **Domicile standard alone** — 5-year continuous residence; presume genuine if duration met; challenger bears burden of proving sham
- (B) **Multi-factor test** — domicile PLUS: voter registration, tax filing, professional practice, property ownership, children's school enrollment; must satisfy majority of factors
- (C) **Professional nexus** — in addition to domicile, nominee must have practiced law or served on the bench in the Region for at least 5 years
- (D) **Commission certification** — the Regional Judicial Nominating Commission certifies that the nominee has genuine Regional ties; certification is rebuttable but shifts burden

### D9. What happens if no qualified candidate exists in a Region?

Small or new Regions might have thin judicial talent pools. Options:

- (A) **Mandatory appointment from Region** — even if pool is thin; incentivizes developing Regional legal talent
- (B) **Waiver with supermajority** — if the President certifies that no qualified candidate exists in the Region, 2/3 Senate vote can waive the Regional requirement for that seat
- (C) **Temporary at-large with Regional priority** — seat filled at-large if no Regional candidate found; next vacancy from that Region takes priority when a qualified candidate emerges
- (D) **Expanded definition of "domiciled"** — if 5-year continuous isn't met, allow birth + cumulative years as alternative path; expands pool

### D10. Should the provision address strategic retirement timing?

The proposal identifies the "Vacancy Timing" gaming vector: coalition Justices retire when their allies control appointments. 18-year terms mitigate this (scheduled vacancies), but early departures still occur. Options:

- (A) **No additional provision** — 18-year terms with staggered vacancies (§5) largely solve this; early departures are inherently unpredictable
- (B) **Early departure stays in Region** — if a Justice departs before term completion, the replacement must be from the SAME Region (prevents strategic retirement to shift a Regional seat)
- (C) **Remainder-of-term appointments from same Region** — under §5(d), the successor serves only the remainder of the departed Justice's term; require the replacement to be from the same Region
- (D) **Anti-strategic retirement provision** — a Justice may not resign effective during the term of a President from the same political party as the President who appointed them (modeled on judicial ethics constraints)

### D11. How many at-large seats should there be if the Region count changes?

Art XX and XXI allow boundary adjustments and new Regions. With 7 Regions and 9 seats, there are 2 at-large. If Regions change:

- (A) **Fixed at 2 at-large** — Region count can change but Court stays 9 with 2 at-large; if Regions exceed 7, some Regions share a seat or a rotation system applies
- (B) **Formula: at-large = 9 minus Regions** — scales automatically; at 8 Regions, 1 at-large; at 9 Regions, 0 at-large; but 0 at-large removes flexibility
- (C) **Minimum 1 at-large** — formula as (B) but floor of 1; if Regions = 9, Court expands to 10 (conflicts with Art XIV §1 lock at 9)
- (D) **Regional seat rotation if Regions exceed at-large capacity** — with 8 Regions and 2 at-large, one Region waits for next vacancy; rotation ensures all Regions have representation over time

### D12. Should party balance apply to the Supreme Court?

The ARB has a 4-of-9 party balance limit (Art II §7(c)). Should similar constraints apply to SCOTUS?

- (A) **No party balance** — geographic diversity is the focus; adding party balance would be novel and controversial for the Court
- (B) **Mirror ARB** — no more than 5 of 9 Justices affiliated with the same political party
- (C) **Soft constraint** — Senate may consider party balance as a factor but no hard cap
- (D) **Separate question** — party balance for SCOTUS is addressed in the standalone judicial reform (Art XIV), not in the Regional Federalism supplement

### D13. How should this interact with the §4-B confirmation system?

Art IV §4-B provides 90-day deemed confirmation. For Regional seats, the nomination may need to satisfy the diversity requirement before the confirmation clock starts. Options:

- (A) **Diversity is a prerequisite** — a nomination that does not satisfy the Regional seat requirement is not a valid nomination; §4-B clock does not start; President must nominate from the correct Region
- (B) **Diversity is challengeable** — nomination starts §4-B clock regardless; any Senator or the affected Region may challenge the nominee's Regional qualification; challenge heard by the Court (minus the departing Justice and the nominee) within 30 days
- (C) **Commission certification prerequisite** — the Regional Nominating Commission must certify the nominee's domicile before §4-B clock starts; certification is ministerial (not discretionary) for nominees who meet the standard
- (D) **Deemed-confirmation savings** — if a nominee is deemed confirmed under §4-B but later found to not meet the domicile requirement, the confirmation is voidable by the Court upon challenge

## 5. Gaming Vectors

### From the proposal (4)

| # | Vector | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | Residential Migration | Coalition nominee establishes nominal 5-year residence in excluded Region to satisfy domicile; maintains actual ties to coalition Region |
| G2 | Vacancy Timing | Coalition Justices strategically retire when allies control appointments; excluded Region Justices pressured to stay; accelerates capture |
| G3 | Ideological Screen | Coalition claims all qualified candidates happen to be from coalition Regions; "merit-based" selection that excludes by geography through proxy factors |
| G4 | At-Large Stacking | Coalition fills all at-large seats from aligned Regions; maximizes coalition representation within diversity rules |

### Additional gaming vectors (9)

| # | Vector | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| G5 | The "Commission Capture" | Coalition controls a Region's Judicial Nominating Commission through political appointments; commission submits only coalition-aligned candidates from the Region; Regional seat technically filled from correct Region but ideologically captured |
| G6 | The "Thin Pool Waiver" | Coalition argues no qualified candidates exist in excluded Region; obtains waiver; fills seat from coalition Region under exception; repeated waivers gut the diversity mandate |
| G7 | The "Professional Carpetbagger" | Federal judge from coalition Region accepts appointment to district court in excluded Region; serves 5 years to establish domicile; nominated to SCOTUS "from" the excluded Region; technically qualifies but has no genuine Regional perspective |
| G8 | The "Chief Justice Anchor" | Coalition ensures Chief Justice is always from a coalition Region; Chief has outsized procedural and agenda-setting power; even with geographic diversity, the most powerful seat stays captured |
| G9 | The "Early Departure Swap" | Coalition Justice in a Regional seat resigns early; President fills with another coalition loyalist technically domiciled in that Region; Regional seat nominally preserved but ideologically unchanged |
| G10 | The "At-Large Rotation Block" | Coalition blocks nominations for at-large seats until a coalition-aligned candidate is available; uses §4-B's 90-day deemed confirmation only for favored nominees |
| G11 | The "Boundary Manipulation" | Coalition pushes boundary changes (Art XX) that incorporate excluded Region's judicial talent pool into coalition Regions; the "Region" label shifts but the people don't move |
| G12 | The "Dual Domicile" | Nominee maintains residences in two Regions; claims domicile in whichever Region has a vacancy; exploits ambiguity in "primary residence" |
| G13 | The "Senate Block" | Senate controlled by coalition rejects all nominees from excluded Regions on "qualifications" grounds; §4-B's deemed confirmation prevents indefinite blocking, but coalition can reject by vote within 90 days and repeat |

## 6. Verification Questions

### V1. Does the new text fulfill the §5(g) cross-reference?

Art III-RF §5(g) says "The Regional Diversity requirement for Supreme Court composition (Article III-RF, Section 1) remains in effect." The new text must be the provision that §5(g) points to. It should update §5(g) to reference the correct section number (§5-A rather than the phantom "Section 1").

### V2. Does the new text prevent the "residential migration" gaming vector?

A coalition nominee who establishes a 5-year nominal residence in an excluded Region technically satisfies a simple domicile requirement. The new text must require genuine Regional connection beyond mere residence.

### V3. Does the new text coordinate with Art XIV §14 (Nominating Commissions)?

The Judicial Nominating Commission system already provides Regional-level candidate screening. The new text should integrate with — not duplicate or undermine — the commission process.

### V4. Does the new text address vacancy timing for early departures?

If a Justice departs before term completion, the replacement under §5(d) serves only the remainder. The new text must ensure the replacement comes from the same Region to prevent strategic retirement from shifting Regional balance.

### V5. Does the new text handle the possibility that the number of Regions changes?

The framework allows boundary adjustments and new Regions. If Regions increase from 7 to 8 or 9, the seat allocation formula must scale without requiring a new amendment.

### V6. Does the new text protect the at-large seats from coalition capture?

At-large seats without constraints become the primary avenue for geographic stacking. The new text must restrict at-large seats sufficiently to prevent them from undermining the diversity mandate.

---

## 7. Draft Text Direction

The amendment should:

1. **Create Art III-RF §5-A (Supreme Court Regional Diversity)** — fulfilling the §5(g) cross-reference, establishing Regional seat allocation for the 9-Justice Court

2. **Use a scaling formula** — one seat per Region, remainder at-large; currently 7+2; scales automatically if Regions change; minimum 1 at-large seat

3. **Define domicile with anti-gaming** — multi-factor standard: continuous residence (5+ years) PLUS genuine Regional connection (professional practice, voter registration, tax filing); prohibit nominal domicile; Regional Nominating Commission certifies Regional ties

4. **Integrate with Art XIV §14** — when Regional seat vacates, that Region's commission submits candidates under existing §14 process; commission certification of domicile is a prerequisite for §4-B confirmation clock

5. **Constrain at-large seats** — no two at-large Justices from the same Region; at-large Justices may not be from a Region already holding a Regional seat unless no other qualified candidates exist

6. **Lock early departures to same Region** — under §5(d), replacement for early departure serves remainder of term AND must be from the same Region

7. **Address vacancy timing** — 18-year staggered terms (§5) provide the primary protection; add Regional-seat-stays-in-Region rule for early departures

8. **Provide transition** — prospective labeling of current Justices by domicile; diversity requirement applies to all future vacancies; hard mandate after first full cycle (18 years)

9. **Update §5(g)** — change cross-reference from "Article III-RF, Section 1" to "Section 5-A of this Article"

10. **Add enforcement** — challenge mechanism for nominees who do not meet Regional domicile; standing for the affected Region, Regional Nominating Commission, and any Senator; expedited resolution before confirmation vote
