## 1. Problem Statement

Each Region can establish its own professional licensing requirements. Without mutual recognition obligations, professionals cannot effectively exercise their migration rights — they can move, but they cannot work. A licensed nurse, teacher, lawyer, or electrician in Region A faces years of re-licensing in Region B. ~25% of the US workforce requires occupational licenses. Migration rights become meaningless for professionals, and Regional labor markets balkanize into 7 isolated pools.

## 2. Existing Provisions (Overlap ~75-80%, HIGH)

### 2.1 Provisions that substantially address the concern

The constitution already contains a **comprehensive mutual recognition framework** in Art I §9 that addresses the core of this gap.

| Provision | What it covers | What it misses |
|---|---|---|
| **Art I §8(a)** — Freedom of Movement | Right to seek employment in any Region | Does not guarantee right to *practice a licensed profession* in any Region |
| **Art I §8(b)** — Movement Prohibitions | Explicitly prohibits conditioning "professional licensure or credentialing on Region of prior residence" | Prohibits origin-based discrimination; does not mandate recognition of out-of-Region credentials |
| **Art I §9(c)** — Professional Credentials | "Professional licenses shall be recognized for practice in all jurisdictions, subject only to registration, reasonable fees, and verification of good standing" | "Reasonable fees" is vague; does not cap fees at administrative cost |
| **Art I §9(g)** — Presumption of Competency | Credential creates "rebuttable presumption of competency to practice in all Regions"; receiving Region bears burden; standard is "Essential for Public Safety" | Strong — tighter than the Gap 191 proposal's standard |
| **Art I §9(h)** — Essential for Public Safety Standard | Four-part test: specific documented risk, unique to receiving Region, narrowly tailored, less restrictive alternatives inadequate | Comprehensive; addresses the core problem |
| **Art I §9(i)** — Prohibited Justifications | General assertions of higher standards, economic impact on existing practitioners, accreditation differences, Region-specific knowledge not related to competency | Directly addresses the "Regional Standards Shield" gaming vector |
| **Art I §9(j)** — ARB Certification Required | Before imposing ANY supplementary requirement, Region must submit to ARB, demonstrate Essential for Public Safety, receive certification within 90 days | Pre-approval mechanism — stronger than the proposal's post-hoc enforcement |
| **Art I §9(k)** — Automatic Recognition | If ARB fails to rule in 90 days, supplementary requirement deemed not certified; credential must be recognized without supplement | Powerful default — addresses "Administrative Delay" gaming vector |
| **Art I §9(l)** — Grandfathering | Existing supplementary requirements valid for 2 years; must seek ARB certification in 1 year; uncertified requirements void after 2 years | Directly addresses the "Grandfather Wall" gaming vector |
| **Art I §9(m)** — Facially Neutral Discrimination | Strict scrutiny for facially neutral requirements with disparate impact on out-of-Region professionals; rebuttable presumption of protectionist intent if adopted within 24 months of significant credential migration | Addresses the "Scope Limitation" gaming vector |
| **Art I §9(n)** — Prohibited Practices | Cannot require CE obtainable only within Region; cannot impose "cultural competency" beyond professional necessity; cannot condition reciprocity on political/policy concessions; cannot revoke reciprocity for unrelated reasons | Addresses "Credential Creep" gaming vector |
| **Art I §9(o)** — Expedited Judicial Review | Appeal to Constitutional Court; 60-day expedited ruling; provisional recognition pending appeal | Provides judicial enforcement with interim practice right |
| **Art I §14** — Professional Credential Protection | Comprehensive protection against retaliatory licensing actions for federal officers and cooperators; treble damages; federal preemption after pattern of retaliation | **Only covers federal officers/cooperators**, not general professionals |
| **Art I §5(a),(c)** — Inter-Regional Cooperation | Regions may enter cooperative agreements and establish joint institutions | Enables voluntary licensing compacts but does not mandate them |

### 2.2 Six specific gaps in the existing framework

| Gap | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| **No hard cap on supervised practice periods** | Art I §9(h)(3) requires "narrowly tailored" but doesn't set a maximum duration. A Region could argue 12 months of supervised practice is "narrowly tailored" for a specific safety risk. The proposal caps this at 90 days. |
| **No mandatory Interstate Licensing Compact** | Art I §5 allows voluntary compacts; §9(f) references "implementing legislation." But there is no constitutional mandate that Regions *must* participate in a unified licensing system. A recalcitrant Region can refuse to join. |
| **No federal backstop for compact failure** | If Regions fail to establish a compact or one refuses to participate, Art I §9(c)-(o) provides individual recognition rights but no systemic federal intervention authority. |
| **No interim license during scope resolution** | Art I §9(o)(3) provides provisional recognition *during appeal*, but not during the initial scope-difference resolution process under §9(h). A professional facing a legitimate scope difference has no practice right until the supplemental requirement is satisfied. |
| **No anti-retaliation for general professionals** | Art I §14 protects federal officers from retaliatory licensing actions. Art I §9(n)(4) prohibits revoking *reciprocity* for unrelated reasons. But there is no protection for a general professional who exercises their §9 recognition rights against workplace or licensing-board retaliation. |
| **No fee cap beyond "reasonable"** | Art I §9(c) allows "reasonable fees" for registration, but does not define "reasonable" or cap at administrative cost. A Region could charge $5,000 "registration fees" for out-of-Region professionals. |

### 2.3 Provision that creates TENSION

| Provision | Tension |
|---|---|
| **Art I §9(c) vs. §9(h)** — Recognition mandate vs. safety standard | §9(c) mandates recognition "subject only to registration, reasonable fees, and verification of good standing." But §9(g)-(h) allows supplementary requirements under the "Essential for Public Safety" standard. A broad reading of §9(c) would make §9(h) unnecessary; a broad reading of §9(h) could swallow §9(c). The relationship between these provisions needs to be clarified — §9(c) is the rule, §9(h) is the narrow exception. |
| **Art I §9(f)** — "Implementation procedures" reference | §9(f) says "Implementation procedures are established by statute" and references proposed legislation. This creates ambiguity: is the §9(c)-(o) framework self-executing, or does it require implementing legislation to take effect? If the latter, a hostile Congress could delay implementation. |

## 3. Proposed Placement

### Primary option: Amend Art I §9 with targeted new subsections

- Art I §9 is the natural home — already contains the entire mutual recognition framework
- Add subsections after §9(o) for (1) supervised practice cap, (2) interim licenses, (3) fee cap, (4) general anti-retaliation, (5) mandatory compact with federal backstop
- Preserves the existing architecture and fills specific gaps
- §9(c) remains the foundational rule; new subsections close gaming vectors

### Alternative A: Art I §8, new subsections (as proposed by Gap 191)

- Pro: Keeps credential portability with Freedom of Movement protections
- Con: Art I §9 already contains the comprehensive credential framework — adding parallel provisions in §8 would create duplication and potential conflicts
- Con: Gap 191 proposes "Art III-RF, Section 7" which does not exist and would fragment the framework

### Alternative B: Statutory implementation under Art I §9(f)

- Pro: Many of the remaining gaps (fee caps, practice caps, compact procedures) could be statutory
- Con: Constitutional text provides stronger protection against erosion
- Con: Self-execution ambiguity of §9(f) means statutory path may never materialize

### Recommendation: Art I §9(p)-(t), five new subsections

Extends the Mutual Recognition section with supervised-practice cap, interim licenses, fee cap, general anti-retaliation, and mandatory compact with federal backstop. Adds one clarifying amendment to §9(c) confirming self-execution. Keeps all credential provisions consolidated in §9.

## 4. Design Questions

### D1. Is the existing Art I §9 framework sufficient with minor clarification?

Art I §9(c)-(o) already provides: mandatory recognition, presumption of competency, Essential for Public Safety standard, ARB pre-approval, auto-recognition, grandfathering sunset, anti-protectionism, and judicial review. Options:

- (A) Sufficient — add only targeted amendments for the six identified gaps
- (B) Insufficient — the gap's proposed Art III-RF §7 is needed alongside §9
- (C) Sufficient for the core, but the six gaps are important enough to warrant constitutional (not statutory) treatment

### D2. Should supervised practice be capped at 90 days (as proposed) or some other duration?

Art I §9(h)(3) requires "narrowly tailored" but sets no hard cap. Options:

- (A) 90 days — aligns with the Gap 191 proposal and the §8(b) 90-day waiting period cap for public services
- (B) 60 days — shorter cap reflecting that a narrowly tailored supplement should not require extended practice
- (C) 180 days — more generous for genuinely complex scope differences (e.g., a Region allowing nurse practitioners to prescribe controlled substances when the originating Region does not)
- (D) No fixed cap — "narrowly tailored" in §9(h)(3) is sufficient; let the ARB and courts develop doctrine

### D3. Should the Interstate Licensing Compact be constitutionally mandated?

Art I §5 allows voluntary compacts; §9(f) references statutory implementation. Options:

- (A) Mandate a compact within 2 years (as proposed), with federal backstop at 3 years
- (B) Mandate a compact but with longer timeline (4-5 years) given administrative complexity
- (C) Do not mandate — Art I §9(c)-(o) provides individual recognition rights that function without a compact
- (D) Mandate federal minimum standards immediately; compact optional for enhanced cooperation

### D4. What should the federal backstop look like?

If Regions fail to establish a compact or one refuses to participate:

- (A) Federal preemption of non-compliant Regional licensing barriers (as proposed)
- (B) Federal license recognition — professionals denied Regional recognition receive federal credential valid in all Regions
- (C) ARB assumes direct licensing authority for the non-compliant Region
- (D) No backstop needed — §9(j)-(k) ARB pre-approval with automatic recognition IS the backstop

### D5. Should there be interim/provisional licenses during scope resolution?

Art I §9(o)(3) provides provisional recognition during appeal but not during scope resolution:

- (A) Extend provisional recognition to scope resolution period — professional practices within common scope while supplemental requirements are resolved
- (B) Automatic interim license valid for 6 months upon filing for recognition
- (C) No interim license — the 90-day ARB window plus provisional recognition during appeal is sufficient
- (D) Interim license for safety-critical professions only (medical, engineering) where gaps in workforce create their own public safety risk

### D6. How should "reasonable fees" be defined?

Art I §9(c) allows "reasonable fees" for registration:

- (A) Cap at administrative processing cost (as proposed) — prevents fee-as-barrier gaming
- (B) Cap at a fixed dollar amount (e.g., $200) indexed to inflation
- (C) Cap at the fee charged to in-Region license renewals — equality principle
- (D) Leave "reasonable" to ARB/court interpretation — avoids constitutional specificity on dollar amounts

### D7. Should anti-retaliation extend to general professionals?

Art I §14 covers federal officers; §9(n)(4) covers reciprocity revocation. Options:

- (A) Extend Art I §14-style protection to any professional exercising §9 recognition rights — treble damages, federal preemption after pattern
- (B) Add a narrower anti-retaliation to §9 — prohibition on heightened scrutiny, targeted audits, discriminatory enforcement (matching the Gap 191 proposal §(h))
- (C) No extension needed — §9(o) judicial review with provisional recognition is sufficient protection
- (D) Add anti-retaliation but limit to licensing-board actions, not general workplace retaliation (which is a labor law issue)

### D8. Should the framework address telehealth and remote professional services?

The proposal does not address cross-Regional remote practice. Consider:

- (A) Explicit provision: professional licensed in Region A may provide remote services to clients in Region B without Region B licensure
- (B) Apply §9(c) recognition to remote practice — if you're recognized for in-person practice, you're recognized for remote
- (C) Separate framework — remote services raise different regulatory concerns (consumer protection, malpractice jurisdiction)
- (D) Leave to statutory implementation

### D9. Should the framework address emergency/temporary practice?

Art I §9 does not provide a temporary practice right for emergencies (e.g., a disaster requiring out-of-Region medical professionals). Options:

- (A) Add automatic 90-day temporary practice right upon arrival in any Region, without any recognition process
- (B) Add emergency practice authority during declared emergencies only
- (C) Not needed — §9(c) already mandates recognition subject only to registration; expedited registration is the mechanism
- (D) Both: 90-day temporary right + extended emergency authority

### D10. Should the framework address workforce depletion / brain drain?

Gap 191's proposal does not address this, but related Gap 98 (Predatory Credentialing Warfare) identifies the risk of wealthy Regions deliberately draining professionals from poorer Regions. Options:

- (A) Address in this amendment — prohibit targeted recruitment subsidies, require compensation for workforce depletion
- (B) Separate concern — workforce movement is the *point* of labor mobility; restrictions would undermine portability
- (C) Address through fiscal equalization (Art X) rather than credential restrictions
- (D) Add reporting requirements only — IFC monitors professional workforce flows and flags imbalances

### D11. Is §9(f) self-executing or does it require implementing legislation?

Art I §9(f) says "Implementation procedures are established by statute" and references proposed legislation. This creates ambiguity:

- (A) Add explicit self-execution clause — "This section is self-executing and does not require implementing legislation to take effect"
- (B) Retain §9(f) as-is — implementing legislation provides helpful procedures but §9(c)-(o) operates independently
- (C) Remove §9(f) reference to "established by statute" — replace with "may be supplemented by statute"

### D12. Should the ARB's 90-day certification window be shortened for individual recognition?

Art I §9(j)-(k) gives the ARB 90 days to certify supplementary requirements. But this applies to the *requirement itself*, not individual recognition applications. A professional seeking recognition faces:

- Region processing time (undefined)
- Plus potential ARB challenge time (90 days)
- Plus potential judicial review (60 days)

Total could exceed 6 months. Options:

- (A) Add individual processing deadline — Regions must process recognition applications within 30 days
- (B) Automatic recognition after 30 days of inaction (similar to §9(k) for ARB)
- (C) Existing framework sufficient — §9(j)-(k) pre-approves requirements; individual recognition should be administrative
- (D) Add both processing deadline AND automatic recognition default

## 5. Gaming Vectors

### From the proposal (5)

| # | Vector | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | The "Regional Standards" Shield | Region claims "unique population" requires "specialized training"; creates Region-specific exam; out-of-Region professionals systematically fail |
| G2 | The "Grandfather Wall" | Region recognizes only pre-ratification licenses; new arrivals must complete full licensing from scratch |
| G3 | The "Credential Creep" | Region continuously adds certifications, CE, supervised practice; moving target prevents qualification |
| G4 | The "Administrative Delay" | Region accepts applications but processing takes 18-24 months "due to backlog"; professional cannot work |
| G5 | The "Scope Limitation" | Region recognizes license but limits scope; advanced practice requires "Regional certification" |

### Additional gaming vectors (7)

| # | Vector | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| G6 | The "Registration Fee Gouge" | §9(c) allows "reasonable fees"; Region charges $5,000-$10,000 "registration and verification" fees for out-of-Region professionals; in-Region renewals are $100 |
| G7 | The "CE Localization" | Region requires all continuing education credits from Region-accredited providers; out-of-Region CE not accepted; professionals must physically travel to Region for CE even before relocating |
| G8 | The "Professional Association Gate" | Region delegates licensure to private professional association; association requires membership, dues, and Region-specific ethics pledge; association not subject to §9 because it's "private" |
| G9 | The "Reciprocity Revocation Cascade" | Region A retaliates against Region B by revoking all reciprocity; Region B retaliates against Region A; cascade spreads; mutual recognition framework collapses through tit-for-tat |
| G10 | The "Scope Inflation" | Region expands definition of "regulated profession" to include occupations not traditionally licensed; hair braiders, interior designers, tour guides now require Regional licenses; creates barriers for common occupations |
| G11 | The "Insurance Lock" | Region requires profession-specific malpractice insurance from Region-licensed carriers only; out-of-Region professionals cannot obtain required insurance; technically not a "licensing" barrier |
| G12 | The "Dual-Track System" | Region creates two tiers: "Full Regional License" (in-Region trained) and "Recognized Credential" (out-of-Region); both can practice but only Full License holders can supervise, teach, or hold administrative positions; creates permanent second-class status |

## 6. Verification Questions

### V1. Does the existing §9 framework adequately address the core proposal?

Art I §9(c)-(o) already provides mandatory recognition, presumption of competency, Essential for Public Safety standard, ARB pre-approval, auto-recognition, anti-protectionism, and judicial review. The reviewer should assess whether the remaining six gaps are significant enough to require constitutional amendment or can be addressed through statutory implementation under §9(f).

### V2. Does the new text close the "registration fee gouge" vector?

Art I §9(c) says "reasonable fees." The new text must either define "reasonable" or cap fees at a specific standard (administrative cost, parity with in-Region fees, fixed amount).

### V3. Does the new text address the "professional association gate" vector?

Regions could delegate licensing authority to private associations that are arguably not bound by §9. The new text must clarify that §9 applies to any entity exercising licensing authority, whether governmental or delegated.

### V4. Does the new text address individual processing timelines?

Art I §9(j)-(k) addresses ARB certification of supplementary *requirements* (systemic). There is no timeline for processing individual *applications* for recognition. A Region that has no supplementary requirements can still delay individual applications indefinitely.

### V5. Does the new text preserve legitimate scope differences?

Art I §9(h) allows supplementary requirements under the Essential for Public Safety standard. The new text must not eliminate this exception — Regions have legitimate reasons for different scope definitions (e.g., nurse practitioner prescribing authority, scope of engineering practice). The goal is to prevent abuse, not eliminate all supplementary requirements.

## 7. Draft Text Direction

Given the ~75-80% overlap, the new subsections should be targeted amendments filling specific gaps rather than a parallel framework:

1. **Amend Art I §9(c)** to add explicit fee cap — "fees not exceeding the cost charged to in-Region license renewals for the same profession"
2. **Add §9(p) — Supervised Practice Cap** — maximum 90 days for any ARB-certified supplementary requirement involving supervised practice
3. **Add §9(q) — Interim Practice During Scope Resolution** — professional may practice within common scope while supplemental requirements for differing scope elements are satisfied; no gap in practice authority
4. **Add §9(r) — Individual Processing Timeline** — Regions must process individual recognition applications within 30 days; inaction beyond 30 days constitutes automatic recognition; continued practice right during processing
5. **Add §9(s) — Anti-Retaliation** — no heightened scrutiny, targeted audits, or discriminatory enforcement against professionals exercising §9 recognition rights; extends to delegated licensing bodies and professional associations
6. **Add §9(t) — Self-Execution and Federal Backstop** — this section is self-executing; Congress may establish supplementary procedures but the recognition mandate operates independently of implementing legislation
7. **Clarify §9(f)** — replace "established by statute" with "may be supplemented by statute"
8. **Preserve §9(g)-(o)** intact — the existing Essential for Public Safety standard, ARB pre-approval, and judicial review framework is strong and should not be weakened or duplicated
