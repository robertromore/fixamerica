# Gap 231 Briefing: Sovereign Shield (Government Accountability)

## For External Review — Multi-LLM Gap Resolution Protocol, Step 2

---

## Problem Statement

The doctrine of "sovereign immunity" holds that the government cannot be sued without its consent. This medieval relic — "the King can do no wrong" — persists in American law, meaning victims of government negligence, misconduct, or constitutional violations often have no remedy.

**Current obstacles for victims of government harm:**

- **Federal Tort Claims Act** requires permission to sue (with massive exceptions)
- **State sovereign immunity** often provides total protection
- **Feres doctrine** bars military personnel from suing for service-related injuries
- **Discretionary function exception** shields negligent "policy decisions" from liability
- **Absolute immunity** protects many officials completely
- **Eleventh Amendment** bars suits against states in federal court without consent
- **Damage caps** limit recovery below actual harm even when suit is allowed
- **Exhaustion requirements** impose bureaucratic barriers that defeat claims through attrition

**The injustice:** Any private corporation causing equivalent harm faces unlimited compensatory damages, punitive damages, criminal prosecution, and regulatory sanctions. Government alone operates outside this accountability structure.

**Companion to Gap 225 (resolved):** Gap 225 (Article XIV §17) abolished qualified immunity for *individual officials*. Gap 231 addresses the *entity-level* immunity that shields government *institutions* from liability. Together, §17-§18 form a complete accountability framework — you can sue both the officer who broke your arm and the department that trained him to do it.

## Existing Provisions

### Entity-Level Sovereign Immunity Waivers Already in Constitution

The constitution currently contains **3 topic-specific sovereign immunity waivers** scattered across different articles:

**Waiver 1 — Infrastructure Violations** (Article I §6(m)(3)):

> "(3) No sovereign immunity defense available for infrastructure violations."

*Context: Applies when ARB finds an infrastructure restriction was not supported by genuine safety necessity.*

**Waiver 2 — Official Falsehoods** (Article II, Truth-in-Government §(f)(iv)):

> "(iv) Civil Liability: Citizens harmed by official falsehoods may bring civil actions; sovereign immunity is waived for this purpose."

*Context: Part of the "Fiduciary Duty of Candor" framework in Article II.*

**Waiver 3 — Bio-Security Data Suppression** (Emergency Powers §11(c)(4)):

> "(4) officials responsible for data suppression or falsification are personally liable and may not claim sovereign immunity or official immunity."

*Context: Emergency Powers Reform Amendment, bio-security transparency provisions.*

### Gap 156 — Partially Overlapping UNRESOLVED Gap

Gap 156 proposes sovereign immunity abrogation for **Regions and States only** (not federal government). Its key provisions:

- §(c): Abrogates sovereign immunity for constitutional claims, monetary damages, prospective relief, preemption challenges
- §(d): **Preserves qualified immunity** for individual officials — *already superseded by §17(l)*
- §(e): Enforcement mechanisms (attorney fees, appropriation protection, federal mandamus)
- §(f): Anti-retaliation
- §(g): Jurisdictional coordination (concurrent jurisdiction, removal option)

**Gap 156 is completely subsumed by Gap 231.** Gap 231's universal waiver (all levels of government) covers everything Gap 156 addresses and more. Gap 156's §(d) QI preservation is already superseded by §17(l). When §18 is integrated, Gap 156 should be marked ABSORBED.

### Article XIV §17 — The Companion Provision (Just Resolved)

Gap 225 was resolved as Article XIV §17 (Abolition of Qualified Immunity). Key provisions relevant to §18 coordination:

- §17(a): Abolishes QI, anti-reconstruction clause
- §17(b): Personal liability standard (negligence, no identical-facts requirement)
- §17(c): "Under color of law" definition
- §17(d): Good faith mitigates damages quantum, defense to punitive only
- §17(e): Indemnification with 10% personal floor (2% hardship minimum)
- §17(f): Financial responsibility requirement
- §17(h): Supervisory liability
- §17(i): Attorney fees (mandatory fee-shifting for prevailing plaintiffs)
- §17(j): Statute of limitations (discovery rule, concealment tolling)
- §17(k): Non-dischargeability in bankruptcy
- §17(l): Supersession of all topic-specific QI waivers
- §17(m): Preserved immunities (legislative, judicial — limited to "in nature")
- §17(n): Federal floor (minimum standard, all levels of government)
- §17(o): Implementing legislation

### Article XIV-RF §5 — Standing to Enforce

Provides broad constitutional standing (injury = constitutional violation; no particularized harm required). This provision provides the *standing* to bring §18 claims but does not address the *sovereign immunity defense*.

### Eleventh Amendment — NOT ADDRESSED ANYWHERE

**Critical finding:** The existing constitution does not mention the Eleventh Amendment anywhere in its design documents. The Eleventh Amendment currently reads:

> "The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State."

This is the constitutional foundation for state sovereign immunity in federal court. **§18 must explicitly abrogate or supersede the Eleventh Amendment**, or courts will argue §18's general waiver does not override a specific constitutional bar.

---

## Proposed Resolution (from Gap Entry)

The gap entry proposes "Article III-RF, Section 16" with 8 subsections:

- (a) Waiver of sovereign immunity (5 categories: torts, constitutional violations, breach of contract, unjust enrichment, private-party parity catch-all)
- (b) Abolition of immunity exceptions (discretionary function, Feres, absolute immunity, any private-party-parity shield)
- (c) Liability standard (negligence/gross negligence/recklessness, respondeat superior, strict liability, vicarious liability for contractors)
- (d) Damages (full compensatory without cap, punitive, attorney fees, prejudgment interest)
- (e) Exhaustion limitations (90-day max, one level, deemed exhausted, constitutional claims bypass)
- (f) Statute of limitations (discovery rule, concealment tolling, disability tolling, parity with private claims)
- (g) Judgment Fund (Congress maintains sufficient fund; agencies charged for their liability)
- (h) Regional application (all levels of government; floor not ceiling)

### Placement Errors (Quadruple Error — Same Pattern as Gap 225)

The proposed placement "Article III-RF, Section 16" contains **four errors**:

1. **Wrong article designator.** Article III-RF is the RF supplement for federal judicial reform (Supreme Court term limits, trial penalty, defense parity, etc.). Sovereign immunity waiver is not a judicial process reform.

2. **Wrong architectural category.** Article III-RF only applies when Regional Federalism is adopted. Sovereign immunity waiver works standalone — it applies to all governments regardless of RF adoption.

3. **Section gap.** Article III-RF ends at §12 (Civilian Court Supremacy). Jumping to §16 leaves sections 13-15 empty.

4. **Subject matter mismatch.** Article III-RF sections reform how courts work (procedural). Gap 231 creates a cause of action and waives governmental immunity (substantive/remedial). This belongs with §17 (Official Accountability).

**Corrected placement: Article XIV §18** — completing the §17-§18 accountability pair in the standalone Judicial Reform Amendment.

## Design Questions

For each question, the reviewer should recommend option A, B, C, or D and explain reasoning.

### D1: Scope of the Waiver

The proposal includes a catch-all: "any harm caused by government action or inaction for which a private party would be liable." Should this be:

- **A. Keep the catch-all.** "Private-party parity" is the simplest and most comprehensive standard. If a private party would be liable, the government should be too.
- **B. Enumerate only.** List specific categories (torts, constitutional violations, breach of contract, unjust enrichment) without catch-all, for clarity and predictability.
- **C. Catch-all with enumerated safe harbors.** Keep the catch-all but explicitly identify categories of government action NOT subject to private-party parity (e.g., foreign affairs, military strategy).
- **D. Modified catch-all.** "Any harm for which a private entity performing the same function would be liable" — ties parity to functional equivalence rather than abstract comparison.

### D2: Discretionary Function Exception

The current FTCA discretionary function exception (28 U.S.C. §2680(a)) shields "any claim based upon the exercise or performance or the failure to exercise or perform a discretionary function or duty." The proposal abolishes this entirely. Should this be:

- **A. Total abolition.** The exception swallows the rule. Government characterizes virtually everything as "discretionary" to escape liability. Private entities cannot avoid negligence liability by calling decisions "discretionary."
- **B. Narrow retention for core sovereign functions.** Preserve immunity only for genuinely policy-level decisions (e.g., decision to go to war, level of diplomatic recognition, allocation of foreign aid) while abolishing it for execution and implementation.
- **C. Replace with negligence standard.** Abolish the categorical exception but preserve protection for decisions that a reasonable policymaker could have made — essentially converting discretionary function from immunity to negligence standard.
- **D. Retain but flip the burden.** Government must prove the decision was genuinely discretionary (not just labeled so) and that liability would impair policy-making, not just create cost.

### D3: Feres Doctrine

The Feres doctrine (*Feres v. United States*, 1950) bars military personnel from suing for service-related injuries. The proposal abolishes this entirely. Should this be:

- **A. Total abolition.** Military personnel are the only Americans categorically barred from suing for government malpractice. A soldier can sue a private hospital but not a military one. The doctrine was judicially created, never enacted by Congress.
- **B. Abolition with combat exclusion.** Abolish Feres for medical malpractice, training injuries, toxic exposure, and administrative harm, but preserve immunity for decisions made in active combat situations where liability could impair tactical decision-making.
- **C. Abolition with administrative review alternative.** Abolish judicial immunity but create a mandatory administrative compensation system (like workers' compensation) for service-related injuries, preserving judicial review for constitutional violations.

### D4: Absolute Immunity Residual

The proposal preserves absolute immunity for "judges in judicial proceedings and legislators in legislative proceedings." §17(m) contains identical language for individual immunity. Should §18:

- **A. Cross-reference §17(m).** Simply state: "The preserved immunities in Section 17(m) apply to entity liability claims as well." Avoids duplication.
- **B. Restate independently.** Repeat the same preserved immunities in §18 for completeness, since §18 addresses different defendants (entities vs. individuals).
- **C. Narrow further for entities.** Even where judicial/legislative immunity shields the individual, the *entity* should still be liable for harm caused by judicially or legislatively immune conduct. (Private analogy: corporation is liable for employee acts even when employee has personal defenses.)
- **D. Distinguish entity and individual.** Preserve absolute immunity for the individual official (§17(m)) but allow entity liability (§18) even for judicially/legislatively immune acts, creating a compensation pathway without personal deterrent.

### D5: Damage Caps

The proposal prohibits all statutory caps on damages for government tortfeasors. Should this be:

- **A. Total prohibition.** No caps of any kind. Government should face the same exposure as any private defendant.
- **B. Allow non-economic caps only.** Permit caps on non-economic damages (pain and suffering, emotional distress) consistent with state tort reform, but prohibit caps on economic damages (medical bills, lost wages, property damage).
- **C. Prohibit caps but allow proportionality review.** No statutory caps, but courts may reduce grossly disproportionate awards through remittitur, same as in private tort cases.
- **D. Prohibit federal caps; allow regional/state.** Federal government faces unlimited liability; Regions and States may impose caps no lower than what applies to private defendants in their jurisdiction.

### D6: Exhaustion Requirements

The proposal caps administrative exhaustion at 90 days, one level of review, deemed exhausted on failure to respond, and exempts constitutional claims entirely. Should this be:

- **A. Accept as proposed.** 90-day limit prevents bureaucratic attrition; one level prevents endless appeals; deemed exhaustion prevents delay-as-denial; constitutional bypass ensures structural claims aren't delayed.
- **B. Shorten to 60 days.** 90 days is still too long for many victims. Government should respond faster.
- **C. Exempt additional categories.** Beyond constitutional claims, also exempt: claims involving ongoing physical harm, claims by incarcerated persons, claims involving government concealment.
- **D. Eliminate exhaustion entirely for government liability.** Exhaustion of administrative remedies is a judge-created doctrine that protects government at plaintiff's expense. Direct court access for all claims.

### D7: Judgment Fund Mechanics

The proposal requires Congress to "maintain a Judgment Fund sufficient to pay all judgments" and charge responsible agencies. Should the constitutional text:

- **A. Mandate the outcome only.** "All judgments against government entities shall be satisfied in full." Defer fund structure to legislation.
- **B. Constitutionalize the fund.** Create a permanent, mandatory appropriation judgment fund in the constitutional text. Prevents Congress from underfunding.
- **C. Require budget charging only.** Don't mandate a specific fund; instead require that all liability costs are charged against the responsible agency's appropriations, creating direct accountability.
- **D. Hybrid.** Mandate that judgments be paid within a specific timeframe (e.g., 180 days), require agency budget charging, and authorize federal courts to enforce payment through contempt if necessary.

### D8: Agency Budget Charging

Charging liability against responsible agency budgets creates accountability but risks operational starvation. Should §18:

- **A. Direct charging without cap.** Agency pays from its budget. If a single judgment bankrupts the agency, that is a political problem (Congress must replenish) and an accountability signal.
- **B. Charging with operational floor.** Agency budget is charged but essential operations are protected — liability above a threshold (e.g., 5% of annual appropriation) is absorbed by the Judgment Fund, with the agency facing budget reprogramming requirements.
- **C. Insurance model.** Require agencies to maintain liability insurance (or equivalent reserve). Premiums create continuous incentive; large judgments don't destroy operational capacity.
- **D. Defer to legislation.** Mandate the principle (agencies face budget consequences for liability) but defer the mechanism entirely to implementing legislation.

### D9: §17-§18 Coordination

How should individual official liability (§17) and entity liability (§18) interact?

- **A. Joint and several.** Official and entity are jointly and severally liable. Plaintiff can collect from either or both. Prevents either from hiding behind the other.
- **B. Independent causes of action.** §17 and §18 create separate claims. Plaintiff may pursue both but total recovery may not exceed actual harm (no double recovery).
- **C. Entity as primary, official as secondary.** Entity pays first (deeper pockets, fewer collection problems). Official's personal liability (§17(e) 10% floor) applies only when entity judgment insufficient or for punitive damages.
- **D. Defer coordination to implementing legislation.** Constitutional text establishes both causes of action; statute coordinates recovery.

### D10: Gap 156 Disposition

Gap 156 (sovereign immunity abrogation for Regions/States) is completely subsumed by Gap 231's universal waiver. How to handle:

- **A. Full absorption.** Mark Gap 156 ABSORBED into Gap 231/§18. All Gap 156 provisions are covered by §18. Gap 156 §(d) QI preservation is already superseded by §17(l).
- **B. Partial retention.** Keep Gap 156's anti-retaliation provision §(f) as a separate requirement, since §18 doesn't explicitly include anti-retaliation.
- **C. Retain as RF-specific supplement.** Keep Gap 156 as an RF-specific provision addressing Region-specific concerns (federal mandamus for Regional compliance, receivership triggers), with §18 as the general standalone provision.

### D11: Government Contractor Liability

The proposal includes vicarious liability for "government contractors acting under government direction." How far should this extend?

- **A. Broad vicarious liability.** Government is vicariously liable for all harm caused by contractors performing government functions, regardless of level of direction. Prevents outsourcing as an immunity strategy.
- **B. Direction-based.** Vicarious liability only when government specifically directed the harmful conduct or the contractor was following government specifications/instructions.
- **C. Abolish government contractor defense.** Instead of making government liable for contractors, make contractors fully liable for their own conduct — abolish the *Boyle v. United Technologies* government contractor defense that shields contractors.
- **D. Both.** Government vicariously liable for directed conduct; contractor independently liable (no *Boyle* defense) for non-directed conduct. Complete accountability.

### D12: Eleventh Amendment Supersession

The Eleventh Amendment bars suits against states in federal court. §18 must address this. How:

- **A. Explicit supersession.** "This section supersedes the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution and all judicial interpretations thereof insofar as they would bar claims authorized by this section."
- **B. Abrogation by enumerated power.** Frame §18 as exercising Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment power to abrogate state sovereign immunity — the only currently recognized path.
- **C. Both.** Explicit supersession plus Fourteenth Amendment grounding, to foreclose any doctrinal objection.
- **D. Silent.** The later-in-time amendment implicitly supersedes the earlier. No need for explicit language.

### D13: Strict Liability

The proposal states "strict liability applies where private defendants would face strict liability." Should §18 go further?

- **A. Accept private-party parity.** Government faces strict liability only in areas where private entities do (e.g., abnormally dangerous activities, defective products, ultrahazardous materials).
- **B. Expand to inherently governmental.** Add strict liability for categories of harm unique to government: wrongful imprisonment, wrongful deportation, wrongful denial of constitutionally protected benefits.
- **C. Strict liability for all constitutional violations.** Constitutional violation itself establishes liability; no negligence showing required. (This would parallel §17(a)'s standard for individual liability.)
- **D. Defer.** Let "private-party parity" catch-all handle strict liability determination case by case.

### D14: Retroactivity

Should §18 apply to claims arising before ratification?

- **A. Prospective only.** Applies only to claims arising after ratification. Government could not have anticipated liability for past conduct under prior immunity regime.
- **B. Limited retroactivity.** Applies to claims where injury is ongoing at ratification, even if initial harm occurred earlier. Discovery rule means many existing injuries are not yet time-barred.
- **C. Full retroactivity.** Applies to all pending claims and any claim not yet extinguished by statute of limitations at ratification. Maximum accountability.
- **D. Transitional window.** Prospective generally, but create a 3-year "lookback window" allowing claims for past harm discovered within 3 years of ratification.

### D15: Supersession of Existing Entity-Level Waivers

Like §17(l) for QI waivers, should §18 supersede the 3 existing topic-specific sovereign immunity waivers?

- **A. Full supersession.** §18 supersedes all prior topic-specific sovereign immunity waivers. Universal standard replaces patchwork. Prevents "negative pregnant" inference.
- **B. Subsumption without supersession.** §18 establishes the general standard; topic-specific waivers remain in place as specific applications (belt and suspenders).
- **C. Supersession with savings clause.** §18 supersedes prior waivers but any provision in a topic-specific waiver that provides *greater* accountability than §18 remains in force (e.g., Article I §6(n)'s treble damages for bad faith infrastructure violations).

## Verification Questions

### V1: Placement

The corrected placement is Article XIV §18 (Standalone Judicial Reform). Does this placement correctly:

- Follow §17 (Official Accountability) as its entity-level companion?
- Remain in the standalone architecture (works without Regional Federalism)?
- Avoid section gaps or conflicts with existing sections?

### V2: Gap 156 Absorption

Does §18 fully absorb Gap 156? Specifically:

- Does §18's universal waiver (all levels of government) cover Gap 156's Region/State-only waiver?
- Is Gap 156's anti-retaliation provision §(f) adequately addressed by §18?
- Is Gap 156's jurisdictional coordination §(g) (concurrent jurisdiction, removal, consolidation) needed in §18?

### V3: §17-§18 Completeness

Do §17 (individual) and §18 (entity) together close ALL immunity gaps? Is there any scenario where:

- A government entity causes harm but neither the individual official (§17) nor the entity (§18) is liable?
- A victim can identify the institutional failure but not the specific official — is entity liability sufficient?
- Multiple officials across multiple entities collaborate in harm — is cross-entity joint and several liability addressed?

### V4: Eleventh Amendment

Is explicit supersession of the Eleventh Amendment sufficient? Or does §18 need to also address:

- *Hans v. Louisiana* (extending 11th Amendment to bar states' own citizens from suing in federal court)?
- *Seminole Tribe v. Florida* (limiting Congress's power to abrogate state sovereign immunity)?
- *Alden v. Maine* (extending sovereign immunity to state courts)?
- The interaction between §18 and the Spending Clause/Commerce Clause abrogation debate?

---

## Gaming Vectors

Reviewers should identify mitigations for each vector.

### G1: Subsidiary Dodge

Government creates nominally "private" entities (government-sponsored enterprises, public-private partnerships, special purpose entities) to perform government functions, then claims those entities are neither "government" (no §18 liability) nor truly "private" (limited assets). **Risk: Medium-High.**

### G2: Outsourcing Shield

Government outsources high-risk activities to judgment-proof contractors, retaining control but disclaiming liability. Contractor goes bankrupt; government claims no respondeat superior because contractor was "independent." **Risk: High.**

### G3: Definitional Narrowing

Courts could define "sovereign immunity" narrowly, preserving other governmental immunity doctrines under different names (e.g., "governmental immunity," "official immunity," "intergovernmental immunity," "discretionary immunity"). **Risk: Medium.**

### G4: Damage Calculation Gaming

Without statutory caps, government litigates damage calculations aggressively — excluding categories of harm (emotional distress, loss of consortium, dignitary harm), demanding impossibly precise economic modeling, challenging expert testimony. Makes plaintiffs accept settlements below actual harm. **Risk: High.**

### G5: Exhaustion Manipulation

Government creates administrative processes that technically comply with 90-day/one-level limits but are designed to discourage pursuit — requiring complex forms, refusing legal representation, scheduling hearings at inconvenient locations, "losing" filings. **Risk: Medium.**

### G6: Jurisdiction Stripping

Congress restricts federal court jurisdiction over certain categories of government liability claims, forcing them into specialized courts (e.g., Court of Federal Claims, tax court) with less favorable procedures or into state courts where states may be hostile to claims against the state. **Risk: Medium.**

### G7: Budget Starvation Paradox

Large judgments charged against agency budgets lead to cuts in the very programs victims depend on (e.g., large VA malpractice judgment causes cuts to VA services). Creates perverse incentive against suing the agencies you depend on. **Risk: Medium-High.**

### G8: Discovery Resistance

Government claims national security, deliberative process privilege, state secrets doctrine, or law enforcement privilege to prevent discovery of facts supporting liability claims. Effectively makes claims unprovable even where immunity is waived. **Risk: High.**

### G9: Intergovernmental Finger-Pointing

In multi-level government failures (federal agency + state implementation + local execution), each level claims the other is the responsible party. Plaintiff must sue all three and litigate proportional liability — cost prohibitive for most victims. **Risk: Medium.**

### G10: Settlement Coercion

Government offers lowball settlements with conditions (confidentiality, no-precedent stipulation, release of all future claims). Plaintiffs — often victims with immediate needs — accept below-market settlements. Judgments never establish deterrent precedent. **Risk: High.**

| Article I §6(m)(3) | Infrastructure violations | Entity |
| Article II, Truth-in-Government §(f)(iv) | Official falsehoods | Entity |
| Emergency Powers §11(c)(4) | Bio-security data suppression | Both (entity + individual) |
| Gap 156 (UNRESOLVED) | Constitutional violations by Regions/States | Entity (Regions/States only) |

All 3 existing waivers are narrow, topic-specific. §18 would establish the universal standard.
