# Gap 12 Resolution Briefing: Constitutional Transition Vulnerability

## 1. The Problem

**Gap 12** identifies that the transition from the current constitution to the Regional Federal system creates path dependency from initial boundary decisions. The concern has three dimensions:

1. **Temporal entrenchment**: Initial boundaries set at ratification (Schedule A) become entrenched through identity crystallization and institutional adaptation long before the first mandatory review under §4-A(a) (up to 20 years)
2. **Statutory lock-in**: Implementation acts (Allocation Framework, Fiscal Equalization, Elections Implementation) will be designed around initial boundaries; their formulas, allocation criteria, and institutional structures may become boundary-dependent and resist revision
3. **Institutional sunk costs**: Regions will invest in headquarters, court systems, administrative infrastructure, and cultural institutions during Years 0-10, creating practical barriers to boundary change

### The Asymmetry

| Protection | When It Activates | Gap |
|---|---|---|
| §4-A Mandatory Review | First decennial census (up to 20 years) | Allows a generation of entrenchment |
| State Transfer (§4(f)-(r)) | After 3-year waiting period | Individual States only; requires objective criteria |
| Capacity Development (§7) | Years 0-15 | Addresses capacity, not boundary flexibility |
| Implementation Act Integrity (§2-A) | Upon enactment | Protects act integrity, not boundary adaptability |

**The gap**: The constitution provides excellent mechanisms for correcting boundaries *after* entrenchment but does nothing to prevent entrenchment *during* the critical first decade.

### Status Contradiction

The source file (05-transition.md) says "Outside scope of stable-state design; requires separate transition protocol." The index classifies it as "Partially Mitigated." These are inconsistent — the provisions cited above do partially mitigate, but the source text hasn't been updated.

## 2. Existing Coverage Analysis

**What already helps:**

- **§4-A(a) Mandatory Review**: Forces boundary reconsideration, but the first instance could be up to 20 years away
- **§4(f)-(r) State Transfer**: Provides an individual-State exit mechanism with objective criteria (but doesn't address boundary-wide revision)
- **§4-A(n) Prohibited Criteria**: Prevents partisan manipulation of boundary revision criteria
- **§4-A(p)-(q) Anti-Obstruction**: Prevents Congress from blocking Commission-recommended boundary changes
- **Schedule A(d)**: States "these initial boundaries are based on geographic, economic, and demographic considerations as of ratification" — acknowledges non-permanence but without force
- **§7 Capacity Development**: Creates flexible transition framework with tiered assessment, but addresses capacity not boundaries

**What's missing:**

1. No accelerated initial boundary review (first review waits for standard 20-year cycle)
2. No requirement that implementation acts be designed with boundary flexibility
3. No explicit constitutional recognition that initial boundaries are provisional
4. No safeguard against boundary-dependent statutory design that resists later revision

## 3. Related Gaps

| Gap | Severity | Status | Relationship | Overlap |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 11 (Boundary revision politics) | High | RESOLVED (§4-A) | Addresses ongoing boundary revision politics | 20% |
| 13 (Institutional capacity gaps) | High | RESOLVED (§7) | Addresses capacity during transition | 15% |
| 57 (Boundary Petrification Paradox) | Medium | Proposal Available | Addresses long-term boundary rigidity | 30% |
| 9 (Demographic divergence) | Medium | Requires Monitoring | Creates the conditions for misalignment | 10% |

**Relationship to Gap 57**: Gap 57 (Boundary Petrification Paradox) addresses long-term boundary rigidity after the system stabilizes. Gap 12 addresses the initial transition period specifically. The accelerated initial review proposed here partially mitigates Gap 57's concern as well, but Gap 57 requires its own resolution for the steady-state period.

## 4. Proposed Approach: Targeted Anti-Entrenchment Provisions

Three focused additions, each placed where it fits best constitutionally:

### Addition 1: Accelerated Initial Review (Art I §4-A, new subsection after (b))

Add a constitutional requirement for the first boundary review to occur within 7 years of ratification (conditioned on Commission maturity), not waiting for the standard 20-year decennial cycle. This is the highest-impact protection — it dramatically reduces the entrenchment window.

### Addition 2: Boundary Adaptability Mandate (Art XXI, new §8)

Require implementation acts to include automatic adjustment mechanisms for boundary changes. Formulas, allocation criteria, and institutional structures must not hardcode specific regional compositions. This prevents statutory lock-in.

### Addition 3: Initial Boundary Provisional Status (Schedule A, strengthen note (d))

Strengthen Schedule A(d) from a descriptive note to a constitutional directive: initial boundaries are explicitly provisional pending the first mandatory review. This creates an interpretive framework that prevents courts from treating initial boundaries as vested interests.

---

## 5. Proposed Constitutional Text

### Art I §4-A — New subsections (insert after subsection (b))

(b-1) **Accelerated Initial Review.** Notwithstanding the twenty-year cycle established in subsection (a), the Commission shall commence the first boundary review within seven (7) years of ratification. This accelerated review:

- (1) shall use the first decennial census data available after ratification, supplemented by interim data from the Census Bureau, Bureau of Economic Analysis, and Bureau of Labor Statistics;
- (2) shall apply the same criteria, procedures, and approval requirements as any other boundary review under Section 4 and this section;
- (3) shall explicitly evaluate whether the initial boundaries established in Schedule A remain consistent with current geographic, economic, and demographic conditions;
- (4) may recommend no changes if the Commission determines that initial boundaries remain appropriate — the accelerated review is a mandatory evaluation, not a mandatory revision;
- (5) shall include a specific assessment of path dependency effects during the transition period, including institutional investments, statutory boundary-dependence in implementation acts, and identity crystallization patterns.

(b-2) **Transition-Period State Transfer Facilitation.** During the first ten (10) years following ratification:

- (1) the three-year waiting period for Unilateral Departure under Section 4(h) is reduced to two (2) years, with the ARB verification of continued Fundamental Misalignment occurring at Year 1 rather than Year 2;
- (2) the ARB shall resolve transfer disputes within sixty (60) days rather than the ninety (90) days specified in Section 4(l);
- (3) States that petition for transfer within five (5) years of ratification may rely on pre-ratification economic and demographic data to establish Fundamental Misalignment, provided such data is no more than three (3) years old at the time of petition.

### Art XXI — New Section 8 (after Section 7)

### Section 8. Transition-Period Boundary Adaptability

*Resolves Gap 12 — Constitutional Transition Vulnerability. This section prevents initial boundary decisions from creating irreversible path dependency during the transition period by requiring boundary-adaptive statutory design and limiting boundary-dependent commitments.*

(a) **Boundary-Adaptive Statutory Design.** Each implementation act required by Section 1 shall include automatic adjustment mechanisms ensuring that:

- (1) equalization formulas, allocation criteria, and funding mechanisms reference "the Regions as constituted at the time of application" rather than specific Regional compositions established in Schedule A;
- (2) institutional structures can accommodate boundary changes without requiring new legislation — where a boundary change alters Regional membership, the implementation act's provisions shall apply to the reconstituted Regions without interruption;
- (3) data collection, reporting, and certification systems are designed to operate at the State level as well as the Regional level, permitting recalculation upon boundary revision;
- (4) no implementation act may define eligibility for equalization transfers, fiscal allocations, or institutional representation by reference to specific States within a specific Region, except as necessary for transition-period calculations under Section 7.

(b) **Anti-Lock-In for Inter-Regional Agreements.** During the first ten (10) years following ratification:

- (1) inter-Regional agreements under Article I, Section 5 that exceed ten (10) years in duration shall include a boundary-revision adjustment clause specifying how the agreement adapts if a participating Region's boundaries change;
- (2) an inter-Regional agreement that lacks such a clause is voidable upon boundary revision by any affected Region;
- (3) this requirement does not apply to agreements of ten (10) years or shorter duration, or to agreements exclusively between States within a single Region.

(c) **Institutional Investment Notice.** During the first ten (10) years following ratification, any Regional capital investment exceeding one percent (1%) of the Region's annual budget that is location-dependent and would be materially affected by boundary revision shall be accompanied by a published Boundary Sensitivity Assessment:

- (1) prepared by the Region and filed with the ARB;
- (2) identifying how the investment would be affected if the Region's boundaries changed under Section 4;
- (3) specifying any adaptation measures the Region has planned.

This requirement is informational only — it does not restrict Regional investment decisions, but ensures that boundary-dependent commitments are made with awareness and transparency.

(d) **Savings Clause.** Nothing in this section:

- (1) restricts the constitutional authority of Regions to make investment, policy, or institutional decisions within their enumerated powers;
- (2) creates a private right of action based on failure to comply with this section, except that any Region, State, or the ARB may petition for a declaratory judgment regarding compliance;
- (3) extends beyond the first ten (10) years following ratification, except for subsection (a), which applies permanently to implementation acts;
- (4) diminishes the protections established in Section 2-A (Implementation Act Integrity).

### Schedule A — Strengthened note (d)

Replace existing Schedule A(d) with:

(d) **Provisional Character of Initial Boundaries.** These initial boundaries are based on geographic, economic, and demographic considerations as of ratification. They are explicitly provisional pending the first mandatory boundary review under Article I, Section 4-A(b-1). Future boundary revisions shall follow the process established in Article I, Section 4. No vested interest, institutional claim, or identity-based argument shall be recognized as a constitutional basis for resisting boundary revision conducted pursuant to the established process. This subsection is an interpretive directive and does not create independent grounds for legal challenge.

## 6. Design Questions for Reviewers

| # | Question | Options | Trade-Off |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Should the accelerated initial review be 7 years or 10 years? | 7 years (proposed) vs. 10 years | Shorter = less entrenchment but may precede first decennial census; longer = more data but more entrenchment |
| 2 | Should the boundary-adaptability mandate (§8(a)) apply permanently or sunset? | Permanent for implementation acts (proposed) vs. 10-year sunset for all | Permanent prevents long-term statutory lock-in; sunset reduces ongoing constraint |
| 3 | Is the Boundary Sensitivity Assessment requirement (§8(c)) too burdensome? | Keep (informational only) vs. remove | Transparency value vs. administrative overhead during already-difficult transition |
| 4 | Should the State Transfer facilitation (§4-A(b-2)) reduce the waiting period further? | 2 years (proposed) vs. 1 year vs. keep at 3 years | Shorter waiting period = easier exit but risk of hasty transfers |
| 5 | Does the "no vested interest" language in Schedule A(d) create litigation risk? | Keep (interpretive directive only) vs. soften | Strong signal against entrenchment vs. potential for frivolous challenges |
| 6 | Should §8(b) anti-lock-in apply to all inter-Regional agreements or only those exceeding a certain budget threshold? | Duration-based (proposed) vs. budget-based vs. both | Duration captures the path-dependency concern; budget threshold adds complexity |

## 7. Interaction with Existing Provisions

| New Provision | Interacts With | Relationship |
|---|---|---|
| §4-A(b-1) Accelerated Initial Review | §4-A(a) Decennial Review Mandate | Supplements standard cycle with earlier first review |
| §4-A(b-1) Accelerated Initial Review | §4-A(b) Census Data Provision | Uses census + supplementary data |
| §4-A(b-2) Transfer Facilitation | §4(f)-(r) State Transfer Mechanism | Temporarily shortens timelines |
| §8(a) Boundary-Adaptive Design | §2-A Implementation Act Integrity | Complements — §2-A protects integrity, §8(a) ensures flexibility |
| §8(b) Anti-Lock-In | Art I §5 Inter-Regional Cooperation | Adds a temporary condition to long-term agreements |
| §8(c) Investment Notice | §7 Capacity Development | Ensures capacity investments consider boundary flexibility |
| Schedule A(d) Provisional Status | §4-A(n) Prohibited Criteria | Reinforces that initial boundaries carry no vested constitutional status |

## 8. Review Findings Incorporated

The following changes were made based on external LLM review:

### HIGH Priority

- **Section 4(m) permanence clash**: Added §4-A(b-2)(4) clarifying that State Transfers under §4(f)-(r) are not subject to §4(m)'s irrevocability provision, and that the accelerated review under §4-A(b-1) constitutes a "decennial review" for §4(m) purposes
- **Census data timing manipulation**: Added §4-A(b-1)(6) requiring the Commission to accord dispositive weight to decennial census data when available; preliminary findings on interim data only, final recommendations require either decennial data or 3-year elapsed review time
- **Commission independence gap**: Added §4-A(b-1)(7) conditioning the accelerated review on Commission maturity — review may not commence until the Commission has been constituted for at least two years; budget guaranteed at review-window rate
- **Capacity-investment paradox**: Added §8(e) bridge clause — capacity investments under §7 shall not be characterized as path dependency effects; Commission must identify transition mechanisms for preserving investment value rather than treating investments as barriers to revision
- **Parameter entrenchment**: Added §8(a)(5) requiring IFC boundary-adaptability review within one year of implementation act enactment, with recommendations to Congress if material boundary dependency is identified

### MEDIUM Priority

- **Boundary-adaptive design as litigation weapon**: Strengthened §8(d)(4) — challenge to §8(a) compliance results in declaratory judgment only, not invalidation; existing provisions remain in force during 2-year congressional amendment period
- **"No vested interest" language narrowed**: Schedule A(d-1) revised to specify that initial boundary assignments do not create vested rights to specific Regional compositions; evidence of revision costs/disruption explicitly permitted in Commission analysis
- **Notwithstanding clause scope clarified**: Added to §4-A(b-1) — accelerated review satisfies first review requirement of §4-A(a); next review scheduled from completion of accelerated review, not from ratification
- **Policy Continuity Rule preserved**: Added to §4-A(b-2) — subsection modifies only §4(h) waiting period and §4(l) dispute resolution timeline; does not affect §4(i) Policy Continuity, §4(j) Anti-Arbitrage, or other substantive provisions
- **Coordinated transfer rush prevention**: Added §4-A(b-2)(5) — if three or more States from a single Region file Unilateral Departure petitions within 12 months during the first 5 years, ARB consolidates and assesses under boundary-revision criteria
- **Election blackout clarification**: Added §4-A(b-1)(8) — Commission deliberations and data gathering may proceed during blackout periods; only public proposals, referendum scheduling, and effectuation are subject to blackout
- **Boundary-adaptive design cannot delay implementation**: Added §8(a)(6) — compliance shall not constitute grounds for extending enactment deadlines; requirement satisfied by dynamic references rather than anticipation of specific changes
- **Tiered assessment conflict with transfers**: Added §8(f) — if a State transfer causes a Region to fall below a previously achieved capacity tier, ARB recalculates baselines and provides a one-year grace period
- **Federal regulatory entrenchment**: Added §8(a)(7) — federal agencies administering Transitional Regional Law under §6(c) shall organize bridge administration at State level to the maximum extent practicable
- **Ratchet effect prevention**: Added §8(d)(5) — modifying a boundary-adaptive provision is not "material weakening" under §2-A(e) if the amendment substitutes an alternative mechanism satisfying §8(a)

### LOW Priority

- **Schedule A note character**: Split operative directive into separate (d-1) subsection to maintain informational character of Schedule Notes
- **Cascading departure limit**: Covered by the consolidated coordinated-transfer provision in §4-A(b-2)(5)
- **BSA threshold for small Regions**: Added two-tier threshold — 1% of annual budget or $50 million (inflation-adjusted), whichever is greater
- **Commission budget during accelerated review**: Added to §4-A(b-1)(7) — Commission budget calculated at review-window rate (0.001%) during accelerated review
- **Incumbent officeholder standing**: Added to §4-A(b-1)(9) — Commission shall not accord incumbent Regional officeholders greater standing than any citizen in the review process
- **Fiscal succession protocol**: Added to §8(a)(5-A) — for financial obligations, implementation acts shall establish fiscal succession protocols for boundary changes
- **Capacity Development Program extension**: Added §8(f)(2) — if boundary revision takes effect during the Capacity Development Program, duration extends by up to 3 years for affected Regions

---

## 9. Revised Constitutional Text

### Art I §4-A — New subsections (insert after subsection (b))

(b-1) **Accelerated Initial Review.** Notwithstanding the twenty-year cycle established in subsection (a), the Commission shall commence the first boundary review within seven (7) years of ratification. The accelerated review conducted under this subsection satisfies the first review requirement of subsection (a); the next review under the cycle established by subsection (a) or by statute shall be scheduled from the date of the accelerated review's completion, not from the date of ratification. This accelerated review:

- (1) shall use the first decennial census data available after ratification, supplemented by interim data from the Census Bureau, Bureau of Economic Analysis, and Bureau of Labor Statistics;
- (2) shall apply the same criteria, procedures, and approval requirements as any other boundary review under Section 4 and this section;
- (3) shall explicitly evaluate whether the initial boundaries established in Schedule A remain consistent with current geographic, economic, and demographic conditions;
- (4) may recommend no changes if the Commission determines that initial boundaries remain appropriate — the accelerated review is a mandatory evaluation, not a mandatory revision;
- (5) shall include a specific assessment of transition-period effects, including statutory boundary-dependence in implementation acts and demographic and economic trends since ratification;
- (6) if the first post-ratification decennial census has not been completed before the commencement of the accelerated review, the Commission shall accord dispositive weight to decennial census data over interim data when decennial data becomes available during the review. The Commission may issue preliminary findings based on interim data but shall not issue final recommendations until either: (A) decennial census data is available, or (B) three (3) years have elapsed since the commencement of the accelerated review, whichever occurs first;
- (7) the accelerated review may not commence until the Commission has been constituted for at least two (2) years. If Congress delays Commission establishment beyond year five (5), the interim Commission convened under subsection (h) shall conduct the review. During the accelerated review period, the Commission's budget shall be calculated under subsection (i)(2) (review-window rate) regardless of whether the review coincides with decennial census data release;
- (8) Commission deliberations, data gathering, analysis, and recommendation development may proceed during the election blackout periods established in Section 4(d) and subsection (s). Only the public proposal of boundary revisions, the scheduling of referenda, and the effectuation of approved revisions are subject to the blackout;
- (9) the Commission shall not accord incumbent Regional officeholders greater standing than any citizen in the accelerated review process. Elected officials may submit testimony on the same basis as other interested parties.

(b-2) **Transition-Period State Transfer Facilitation.** During the first ten (10) years following ratification:

- (1) the three-year waiting period for Unilateral Departure under Section 4(h) is reduced to two (2) years, with the ARB verification of continued Fundamental Misalignment occurring at Year 1 rather than Year 2;
- (2) the ARB shall resolve transfer disputes within sixty (60) days rather than the ninety (90) days specified in Section 4(l);
- (3) States that petition for transfer within five (5) years of ratification may rely on pre-ratification economic and demographic data to establish Fundamental Misalignment, provided such data is no more than three (3) years old at the time of petition;
- (4) for purposes of Section 4(m), the accelerated initial review under subsection (b-1) constitutes a "decennial review," and State Transfers approved under Section 4(f)-(h), as modified by this subsection, are not subject to the irrevocability provision of Section 4(m). This subsection modifies only the waiting period established in Section 4(h) and the dispute resolution timeline established in Section 4(l). It does not modify the Policy Continuity Rule of Section 4(i), the Anti-Arbitrage Certification of Section 4(j), or any other substantive provision of Section 4;
- (5) if three (3) or more States from a single Region file Unilateral Departure petitions within the same twelve (12) month period during the first five (5) years following ratification, the ARB shall assess whether the petitions reflect coordinated action that is functionally equivalent to a boundary revision. If so, the petitions shall be consolidated and assessed under the boundary-revision criteria of Section 4-A, not the individual State Transfer mechanism.

### Art XXI — New Section 8 (after Section 7)

### Section 8. Transition-Period Boundary Adaptability

*Resolves Gap 12 — Constitutional Transition Vulnerability. This section prevents initial boundary decisions from creating irreversible path dependency during the transition period by requiring boundary-adaptive statutory design and limiting boundary-dependent commitments.*

(a) **Boundary-Adaptive Statutory Design.** Each implementation act required by Section 1 shall include automatic adjustment mechanisms ensuring that:

- (1) equalization formulas, allocation criteria, and funding mechanisms reference "the Regions as constituted at the time of application" rather than specific Regional compositions established in Schedule A;
- (2) institutional structures can accommodate boundary changes without requiring new legislation — where a boundary change alters Regional membership, the implementation act's provisions shall apply to the reconstituted Regions without interruption;
- (3) data collection, reporting, and certification systems are designed to operate at the State level as well as the Regional level, permitting recalculation upon boundary revision;
- (4) no implementation act may define eligibility for equalization transfers, fiscal allocations, or institutional representation by reference to specific States within a specific Region, except as necessary for transition-period calculations under Section 7;
- (5) the Independent Fiscal Council shall review each implementation act's boundary adaptability within one (1) year of enactment and publish an assessment of whether the act's formulas and parameters would produce materially different outcomes under plausible alternative boundary configurations. If the IFC identifies material boundary dependency, it shall recommend specific amendments to Congress;
- (6) compliance with this subsection shall not constitute grounds for extending the congressional enactment deadlines established in Section 1 and Section 2. The boundary-adaptive design requirement may be satisfied by formulas that reference Regional composition dynamically and does not require Congress to anticipate or model specific boundary changes;
- (7) federal agencies administering Transitional Regional Law under Section 6(c) shall organize their bridge administration at the State level, not the Regional level, to the maximum extent practicable, ensuring that administrative reorganization following boundary revision does not require restructuring federal bridge operations.

(b) **Fiscal Succession Protocol.** For financial obligations of Regions, including bonds, pension commitments, and contractual liabilities, each implementation act shall establish a fiscal succession protocol specifying how obligations are apportioned between reconstituted Regions following a boundary revision.

(c) **Anti-Lock-In for Inter-Regional Agreements.** During the first ten (10) years following ratification:

- (1) inter-Regional agreements under Article I, Section 5 that exceed ten (10) years in duration shall include a boundary-revision adjustment clause specifying how the agreement adapts if a participating Region's boundaries change;
- (2) an inter-Regional agreement that lacks such a clause is voidable upon boundary revision by any affected Region;
- (3) this requirement does not apply to agreements of ten (10) years or shorter duration, or to agreements exclusively between States within a single Region.

(d) **Institutional Investment Notice.** During the first ten (10) years following ratification, any Regional capital investment exceeding the greater of one percent (1%) of the Region's annual budget or fifty million dollars ($50,000,000) adjusted for inflation that is location-dependent and would be materially affected by boundary revision shall be accompanied by a published Boundary Sensitivity Assessment:

- (1) prepared by the Region and filed with the ARB;
- (2) identifying how the investment would be affected if the Region's boundaries changed under Section 4;
- (3) specifying any adaptation measures the Region has planned.

This requirement is informational only — it does not restrict Regional investment decisions, but ensures that boundary-dependent commitments are made with awareness and transparency. The ARB shall not rank, compare, or aggregate Boundary Sensitivity Assessments across Regions. No federal official shall characterize a Region's investment decisions as evidence of boundary instability.

(e) **Capacity Investment Safe Harbor.** Institutional investments made pursuant to the Capacity Development Program under Section 7 shall not be characterized as path dependency effects for purposes of the accelerated review under Article I, Section 4-A(b-1)(5). Where boundary revision would affect capacity investments, the Commission shall identify transition mechanisms for preserving the value of such investments (including transfer of facilities to successor Regions, shared-services agreements, and inter-Regional facility sharing) rather than treating investments as barriers to revision or as reasons to avoid revision. No Region shall be disadvantaged in capacity assessment under Section 7 for making investments that would be affected by potential boundary revision, provided such investments are consistent with the Region's capacity development objectives.

(f) **Capacity Tier Adjustment for Boundary Changes.**

- (1) If a State transfer under Section 4(f)-(r) or Section 4-A(b-2), or a boundary revision under Section 4 and Section 4-A, results in a Region falling below a previously achieved capacity tier, the ARB shall: (A) recalculate capacity baselines for the reconstituted Region; (B) provide a grace period of not less than one (1) year before applying tier regression consequences under Section 7(n); (C) make supplementary Capacity Development Program resources available to the affected Region.
- (2) If boundary revision under Section 4-A(b-1) takes effect during the Capacity Development Program's operational period under Section 7(j), the Program's duration for affected Regions shall be extended by the lesser of three (3) years or the time remaining until all affected Regions achieve Tier 2 certification.

(g) **Savings Clause.** Nothing in this section:

- (1) restricts the constitutional authority of Regions to make investment, policy, or institutional decisions within their enumerated powers;
- (2) creates a private right of action based on failure to comply with this section, except that any Region, State, or the ARB may petition for a declaratory judgment regarding compliance;
- (3) extends beyond the first ten (10) years following ratification, except for subsection (a), which applies permanently to implementation acts, and subsection (b), which applies whenever boundary revision occurs;
- (4) diminishes the protections established in Section 2-A (Implementation Act Integrity). A challenge to an implementation act's compliance with subsection (a) shall not result in invalidation of any provision of the act. The sole remedy for non-compliance with subsection (a) shall be a declaratory judgment requiring Congress to amend the non-compliant provision within two (2) years, during which the existing provision remains in full force;
- (5) an amendment to an implementation act that modifies a boundary-adaptive provision required by subsection (a) shall not be deemed "material weakening" under Section 2-A(e) if the amendment substitutes an alternative boundary-adaptive mechanism that satisfies the requirements of subsection (a).

### Schedule A — Strengthened notes (d) and new (d-1)

Replace existing Schedule A(d) with:

(d) These initial boundaries are based on geographic, economic, and demographic considerations as of ratification. They are explicitly provisional pending the first mandatory boundary review under Article I, Section 4-A(b-1). Future boundary revisions shall follow the process established in Article I, Section 4.

(d-1) **Anti-Entrenchment Directive.** Initial boundary assignments under this Schedule do not create vested rights to a specific Regional composition, nor do institutional investments made after ratification constitute an independently cognizable constitutional interest in maintaining existing boundaries. This directive does not prohibit parties from presenting evidence regarding the costs of boundary revision, institutional disruption, or community interests as factors in the Commission's analysis under Section 4-A. This subsection is an interpretive directive applicable in proceedings arising under Section 4 and Section 4-A; it does not create a freestanding cause of action and may not be invoked except as a defense to claims that boundary revision violates vested interests.

## 10. Design Questions — Resolved

| Question | Resolution |
|----------|------------|
| 7-year vs. 10-year accelerated review | 7 years, conditioned on Commission maturity (at least 2 years constituted); with census-data safeguard requiring decennial data before final recommendations |
| Boundary-adaptability permanent or sunset | Permanent for implementation acts; other provisions (§8(c), (d)) sunset at 10 years |
| Boundary Sensitivity Assessment burden | Keep, with two-tier threshold ($50M floor) and anti-stigma protections; informational only |
| State Transfer waiting period | 2 years (reduced from 3), with coordinated-transfer consolidation to prevent mass departure gaming |
| "No vested interest" language | Narrowed to specific anti-entrenchment directive in separate (d-1); evidence of revision costs explicitly permitted |
| Anti-lock-in scope | Duration-based (10 years), as proposed; captures the path-dependency concern without adding budget-threshold complexity |
