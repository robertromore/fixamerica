# Gap 215 — Internal Refugee (Climate Displacement)

## External Review Briefing

**Date**: 2026-02-01
**Gap**: 215 — Internal Refugee (Climate Displacement)
**Severity**: Critical
**Category**: Emerging Technology / Emergency Powers
**Overlap with existing provisions**: ~35-40% (MODERATE)
**Recommendation**: New constitutional text required, but significantly less than proposal suggests — existing Migration Surge Stabilization framework covers substantial ground

---

## 1. Gap Summary

The Regional Federalism framework protects the Right to Travel (Art I §8(a-e)) and provides fiscal stabilization for receiving Regions experiencing migration surges (Art I §8(f-o)). However, the framework assumes migration is voluntary, temporary, and manageable in scale. It does not anticipate **catastrophic displacement** where an entire metropolitan area becomes permanently uninhabitable due to climate events (sea-level rise, mega-drought, repeated catastrophic storms), forcing millions of citizens to relocate simultaneously.

**The core failure**: The Migration Surge Stabilization framework (Art I §8(f-o)) treats migration as a demand-side problem (receiving Region needs fiscal support) but catastrophic climate displacement is a supply-side catastrophe (origin Region ceases to exist as habitable territory). The 3% surge threshold is a lagging indicator — by the time Census certifies it, millions are already displaced. No mechanism exists to coordinate resettlement across all Regions, allocate displaced citizens by capacity, or protect displaced citizen rights (voting, pensions, credentials) when their origin Region is permanently uninhabitable.

### Proposed resolution

Add emergency displacement authority (placement TBD — see D1). Eight subsections:

- **(a)** Displacement Emergency declaration (President + Congress, 100K+ threshold)
- **(b)** Federal plenary resettlement authority (planning, allocation, housing, integration)
- **(c)** Regional border closure prohibition during displacement emergency
- **(d)** Capacity-based allocation formula with 5% cap
- **(e)** Federal reimbursement (100% direct costs 5 years, 75% ongoing 10 years)
- **(f)** Displaced citizen rights (voting retention, credential recognition, no "transient" treatment)
- **(g)** Origin Region obligations (pension responsibility, record transfer, no exit penalties)
- **(h)** Climate Adaptation Fund (carbon-fee funded, 30-year projections)

## 2. Overlap Analysis

**This gap has the highest overlap of any Emerging Technology gap.** The existing Migration Surge Stabilization framework (Art I §8(f-o)) already provides extensive infrastructure. However, it was designed for a qualitatively different scenario — voluntary migration surges, not catastrophic involuntary displacement.

| Proposal Element | Existing Provision | Coverage | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Displacement Emergency declaration (a) | Art XVII §2(a)(1) (Natural Disaster category); Art XVII-RF §1 (Regional Governor declaration); Art I §8(f-g) (Migration Surge definition + early warning) | ~30% | Natural Disaster powers exist but cover rescue/relief/temporary housing, not long-term resettlement. Migration Surge trigger (3%) is volume-based and Census-certified — a lagging indicator for catastrophic events |
| Federal Resettlement Authority (b) | Art I §8(h-i) (emergency equalization transfers + service capacity assistance) | ~35% | Fiscal support and technical assistance for receiving Regions exist, but no plenary authority to coordinate cross-Regional resettlement or allocate displaced citizens among Regions |
| Border Closure Prohibition (c) | Art I §8(a-b) (freedom of movement, no border controls); Art I §8(j) (anti-degradation mandate); Art I §8(n) (preservation of freedom of movement) | ~70% | Freedom of movement already constitutionally protected. Anti-degradation prevents service denial. But no explicit prohibition on using emergency declarations (Art XVII-RF §1) to limit absorption |
| Capacity-Based Allocation (d) | None | ~5% | Entirely new concept. Equalization formula distributes money, not people. No precedent for federal allocation of citizens among Regions |
| Federal Reimbursement (e) | Art I §8(h) (emergency equalization transfers from Asymmetric Shock Fund); Art I §8(i) (infrastructure grants, technical assistance, temporary federal personnel); Art X §9(c-d) (Cyclical Stabilization Fund at 0.5% GDP) | ~40% | Fiscal transfer mechanisms exist but are formula-driven (equalization) or shock-triggered (2 SD deviation). No 100%/75% reimbursement schedule for displacement-specific costs |
| Displaced Citizen Rights (f) | Art I §8(a-c) (travel, residence, employment, service access); Art I §9 (mutual recognition of credentials); Art I §8(b) (30-day max voting registration) | ~40% | Basic movement and credential rights covered. But: voting retention in origin Region (10 years), expedited registration, no "transient" treatment, emergency housing entitlement not addressed |
| Origin Region Obligations (g) | Art I §8(l) (origin Region contribution to surge costs); Art I §8(o) (exit penalty prohibition) | ~50% | Financial contribution mechanism and exit penalty prohibition exist. But: pension transfer obligation, record facilitation duty not specified |
| Climate Adaptation Fund (h) | Art I §8(m) (Migration Surge Stabilization Fund at 0.1% federal revenue); Art X §9(c) (Cyclical Stabilization Fund at 0.5% GDP) | ~25% | General-purpose funds exist but are not climate-specific, not carbon-fee funded, not sized to 30-year climate projections |

**Institutions available**: IFC (Art X §5) — already certifies migration surges, manages equalization, administers Shock Fund. Census Bureau — already monitors migration patterns. ARB (Art IV) — dispute resolution. No new institution needed.

## 3. Architectural Context

### Three Existing Layers

The existing framework addresses displacement-adjacent scenarios across three layers:

| Layer | Provisions | What It Handles | What It Misses |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Emergency** (Art XVII + Art XVII-RF) | Natural Disaster category; Regional Governor declarations; enumerated powers (rescue, relief, temporary housing) | Immediate disaster response | Long-term resettlement; cross-Regional coordination; permanent uninhabitability |
| **Migration** (Art I §8(f-o)) | 3% surge trigger; Census certification; automatic equalization transfers; service capacity assistance; anti-degradation; origin contribution; Surge Fund | Medium-term fiscal stabilization for receiving Regions | Federal allocation authority; permanent displacement; capacity-based distribution; displaced citizen voting/pension rights |
| **Fiscal** (Art X §9) | Asymmetric Shock recognition (2 SD); automatic stabilizer transfers; Cyclical Stabilization Fund (0.5% GDP); countercyclical tools | Economic divergence from national average | Climate-specific displacement costs; resettlement infrastructure; origin Region dissolution |

### Placement Options

**Art XVII-RF (Regional Emergency Authority)**:

| Section | Content | Status |
|---|---|---|
| §1 | Regional Governor Declaration Authority | Existing |
| §2 | Regional Legislature Reauthorization | Existing |
| §3 | Coordination with Federal Emergency Powers | Existing |
| §4 | Regional Bio-Security Cooperation (Gap 206) | Existing |
| **§5** | **Next available** | **Candidate for Gap 215** |

**Art XVII (Emergency Powers Reform, single-topic)**:

| Section | Content | Status |
|---|---|---|
| §1-§10 | Core emergency framework | Existing |
| §11 | Bio-Security Emergency Escalation (Gap 206) | Existing |
| §12 | Serial Emergency Prevention | Existing |
| §13 | Legacy Emergency Transition | Existing |
| **§14** | **Next available** | **Alternative placement** |

**Art I §8 (Freedom of Movement)**:

| Subsection | Content | Status |
|---|---|---|
| (a)-(e) | Core movement rights | Existing |
| (f)-(o) | Migration Surge Stabilization | Existing |
| **(p)** | **Next available** | **Alternative: displacement-specific amendments** |

## 4. Cross-Gap Interactions

| Related Gap | Status | Connection |
|---|---|---|
| Gap 11 (Climate Displacement) | Context | Long-horizon climate risk acknowledgment — the underlying threat |
| Gap 113 (Evacuation Authority) | Partially Mitigated | Cross-Regional emergency evacuation — immediate phase; Gap 215 addresses aftermath |
| Gap 181 (Benefit Serfdom / fiscal Berlin Wall) | High / Requires Development | Benefit portability is critical for displaced citizens — if benefits don't travel, citizens are trapped |
| Gap 199 (Family Fracture / status portability) | High / Requires Development | Family status portability during displacement — marriage, custody, guardianship recognition |
| Gap 203 (Indentured Student / brain drain tax) | ✅ Resolved (Art I §8(o)) | Exit penalty prohibition already prevents financial penalties on relocation |
| Gap 206 (Petri Dish / bio-security) | ✅ Resolved (Art XVII §11 + Art XVII-RF §4) | Architectural precedent: federal supersession of Regional authority during declared emergency |

## 5. Design Questions

Reviewers should address:

**D1: Placement.** The proposal targets Art XVII §9, but §§1-13 are occupied in single-topic and §§1-4 in RF supplement. Options:

- (a) Art XVII-RF §5 (next available in Regional Emergency Authority) — keeps displacement authority with other Regional emergency provisions; follows the pattern of §4 (bio-security cooperation)
- (b) Art XVII §14 (next available in single-topic Emergency Powers Reform) — if displacement is primarily a federal emergency power, not a Regional supplement
- (c) Art I §8 expansion (subsections (p)-(z) within Freedom of Movement) — extends the existing migration framework; keeps all movement/displacement provisions together
- (d) Hybrid: emergency declaration authority in Art XVII-RF §5 (or Art XVII §14), displacement rights and fiscal provisions as Art I §8(p)-(t)
- (e) Split across three locations: emergency declaration in Art XVII, allocation/fiscal in Art X, citizen rights in Art I §8
- Which placement is most consistent with the existing architecture? Consider that the Bio-Security gap used a hybrid (Art XVII §11 for federal authority + Art XVII-RF §4 for Regional cooperation).

**D2: Relationship to Migration Surge Stabilization.** The existing Art I §8(f-o) framework overlaps significantly. Options:

- (a) Gap 215 supplements §8(f-o) — displacement emergency activates enhanced provisions on top of existing surge framework
- (b) Gap 215 supersedes §8(f-o) during displacement emergencies — displacement declaration overrides normal surge mechanisms
- (c) Gap 215 is independent — separate framework that operates in parallel
- (d) Amend §8(f-o) to add displacement-specific provisions rather than creating new framework
- Should the existing surge framework be the "entry ramp" that escalates to displacement authority when overwhelmed?

**D3: "Permanently uninhabitable" definition.** The proposal's declaration threshold is 100,000+ citizens displaced by events rendering areas "permanently or long-term uninhabitable." Issues:

- (a) "Permanently uninhabitable" is a geological/climatological judgment — who certifies this? IFC? NOAA? A scientific panel?
- (b) "Long-term uninhabitable" is ambiguous — 5 years? 20 years? 100 years?
- (c) 100,000 threshold is arbitrary — 99,999 displaced citizens get no federal coordination?
- (d) Should the trigger be cause-based (climate/environmental) or effect-based (displacement volume + origin uninhabitability)?
- (e) How does this interact with the existing 3% migration surge trigger? If 2 million people leave Florida, the surge trigger fires in multiple receiving Regions simultaneously — does the displacement declaration add anything the surge framework doesn't already provide?

**D4: Federal plenary resettlement authority.** The proposal grants the federal government "plenary power" over resettlement planning, allocation, temporary housing, and integration. Issues:

- (a) "Plenary power" is an extraordinary constitutional grant — is it proportionate?
- (b) This effectively overrides Regional sovereignty over housing, zoning, land use, and local planning — all normally Regional domains
- (c) Should the authority be "coordination authority" rather than "plenary power"?
- (d) Should Regions retain any role in resettlement planning, or does federal coordination require federal supremacy?
- (e) How does this interact with Art II §1(e) (Exclusive Regional Domains)? If housing and land use are Regional domains, can a displacement emergency override them?
- (f) Should there be a sunset on plenary authority (e.g., 5 years from declaration, with renewal)?

**D5: Capacity-based allocation formula.** The proposal allocates displaced citizens based on housing vacancy, labor market capacity, infrastructure surplus, and geographic/cultural proximity, with a 5% cap. Issues:

- (a) Should the allocation formula be constitutional or statutory? Constitutional formulas are inflexible.
- (b) "Geographic and cultural proximity" is a euphemism that could enable racial/ethnic sorting — should this criterion be removed?
- (c) The 5% cap creates a mathematical constraint: if 5 million people are displaced and no Region has more than 20 million people, you need at least 5 Regions to absorb them. What if capacity-constrained Regions all hit 5%?
- (d) "Absent consent" — a Region can consent to exceed 5%. But can consent be coerced through fiscal incentives?
- (e) Who administers the allocation — IFC, a new Displacement Authority, or FEMA-equivalent?
- (f) Can displaced citizens choose their destination, or is allocation mandatory? Mandatory allocation of citizens raises serious liberty concerns.

**D6: Reimbursement schedule.** The proposal specifies 100% federal reimbursement for direct costs (5 years), 100% for infrastructure expansion, and 75% for ongoing service costs (10 years). Issues:

- (a) Constitutional specificity of dollar percentages is unusual and inflexible — what if costs patterns differ from projections?
- (b) 100% reimbursement creates moral hazard — receiving Region has no incentive to control costs
- (c) Should the constitution establish the principle (full federal reimbursement for displacement costs) and leave the schedule to statute?
- (d) How does this interact with Art X equalization? If displaced citizens are counted in receiving Region's population, equalization transfers adjust automatically — is separate reimbursement double-counting?
- (e) The 5-year / 10-year timeline is arbitrary — displacement integration may take longer or shorter depending on scale

**D7: Displaced citizen voting rights.** The proposal allows voting retention in origin Region for 10 years or until establishing new permanent residence, plus expedited registration in receiving Region. Issues:

- (a) Voting retention in origin Region is problematic if the origin is permanently uninhabitable — who are they electing? A Regional government over uninhabitable territory?
- (b) If a Region loses 50% of its population, its remaining political representation is distorted — 5 million displaced voters control a Region with 5 million remaining residents
- (c) Should displaced citizens vote in their receiving Region immediately? The 30-day registration limit (Art I §8(b)) already applies.
- (d) Can a displaced citizen vote in both origin and receiving Region? The proposal suggests either/or, but the transition is ambiguous.
- (e) If the origin Region is dissolved or merged due to population collapse, where do voting rights attach?

**D8: Climate Adaptation Fund.** The proposal creates a constitutionalized fund with carbon-fee linkage and 30-year projections. Issues:

- (a) Constitutionalizing a specific revenue source (carbon fees) is unusual and locks in one policy approach
- (b) The existing Surge Fund (Art I §8(m), 0.1% federal revenue) and Shock Fund (Art X §9(c), 0.5% GDP) already provide disaster fiscal capacity — is a third fund necessary?
- (c) Should the constitution establish the principle (pre-funded displacement response) and delegate fund design to statute?
- (d) "Available without further appropriation" creates automatic spending authority — does this conflict with congressional appropriations power?
- (e) 30-year projections require climate science modeling — who certifies the projections? IFC? NOAA? A scientific panel?
- (f) Could the existing funds be amended to include climate displacement as a covered scenario, rather than creating a new fund?

**D9: Interaction with Art XVII §2 emergency categories.** The existing emergency framework has five categories: Natural Disaster, Public Health, Economic, National Security, Constitutional Crisis. Issues:

- (a) Climate displacement fits within "Natural Disaster" (Art XVII §2(a)(1)) but the enumerated powers (Art XVII §3(a)) are limited to rescue, relief, recovery, and temporary housing — not long-term resettlement
- (b) Should a new emergency category be added: "Mass Displacement" or "Climate Displacement"?
- (c) Or should Art XVII §3(a) Natural Disaster powers be expanded to include resettlement coordination?
- (d) If a new category is added, should it have its own time limits and oversight requirements under §§4-5?

**D10: Escalation from surge to displacement.** The existing Migration Surge framework (Art I §8(f-o)) and the proposed Displacement Emergency framework could create confusion about which applies when. Issues:

- (a) Should the Displacement Emergency explicitly supersede the Migration Surge framework when declared, or operate in addition to it?
- (b) Should the surge framework be the "entry ramp" — IFC certifies surge, then if cause is environmental catastrophe, escalates to displacement declaration?
- (c) What prevents a surge from being reclassified as displacement (or vice versa) for political reasons?
- (d) Should there be a clear handoff protocol: Census certifies surge → IFC determines cause → if climate/environmental → President declares displacement emergency?

**D11: Origin Region dissolution.** If a Region is permanently uninhabitable and loses most of its population, what happens to the Region itself? Issues:

- (a) Does the Region continue to exist constitutionally with 10% of its former population? 1%? 0%?
- (b) Who manages the uninhabitable territory — federal government, neighboring Region, a custodial authority?
- (c) How are the origin Region's assets (infrastructure, public lands, mineral rights) distributed?
- (d) How are the origin Region's debts handled? Art X §6 (Regional Debt Discipline) doesn't address Region dissolution.
- (e) Should the constitution provide for Regional merger or dissolution procedures triggered by displacement events?
- (f) This interacts with Art I §2 (Regional boundaries) and the boundary modification procedures

**D12: Anti-gaming for "infrastructure emergency" defense.** The first gaming vector (G1) identifies Regions claiming infrastructure overwhelm to exclude displaced citizens. Issues:

- (a) How is legitimate capacity concern distinguished from pretextual exclusion?
- (b) Should the IFC independently verify capacity claims?
- (c) Should Regions that have historically under-invested in infrastructure be treated differently from Regions that are genuinely at capacity?
- (d) The anti-degradation mandate (Art I §8(j)) addresses intentional service degradation but doesn't address legitimate infrastructure limits

**D13: International climate refugees.** The proposal is entirely domestic. Issues:

- (a) Climate displacement will also create international refugees seeking entry to the US
- (b) Should the framework distinguish between internal displacement and international climate migration?
- (c) Should there be a coordinated framework for both, or is international climate migration a separate immigration policy question?
- (d) How does this interact with federal immigration authority?

## 6. Gaming Vectors

### From the Proposal

| # | Vector | Description |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | Infrastructure Emergency Defense | Receiving Region claims infrastructure genuinely overwhelmed — hospitals, schools, water at capacity. Legitimate concern weaponized to exclude displaced citizens |
| G2 | Residency Requirement Wall | Region doesn't "close" border but requires proof of residency for all services. Displaced citizens excluded through administrative barriers |
| G3 | "Temporary" Permanent Closure | Emergency border closure declared for 30 days, extended indefinitely "until infrastructure catches up." Temporary measures become permanent policy |
| G4 | Economic Migrant Reframe | Region argues climate refugees are "economic migrants" seeking opportunities, not fleeing disaster. Denies emergency character to justify exclusion |

### Additional Gaming Vectors

| # | Vector | Description |
|---|---|---|
| G5 | Capacity Measurement Gaming | Region underreports housing vacancy, inflates infrastructure utilization, or reclassifies available capacity as "committed" to reduce allocation under §(d). IFC capacity assessments become adversarial. |
| G6 | Origin Region Fiscal Escape | Origin Region declares uninhabitability to shed pension obligations, unfunded liabilities, and debt. "Our Region is underwater, so our $50B in pension obligations are too." |
| G7 | Strategic Non-Preparation | Region refuses to invest in climate adaptation (sea walls, flood control, drought resilience), knowing that federal displacement framework will cover costs. Moral hazard for origin Regions. |
| G8 | Allocation Cherry-Picking | Receiving Region accepts allocation but concentrates displaced citizens in undesirable areas — flood plains, industrial zones, remote locations. Technically compliant, practically hostile. |
| G9 | Political Displacement | Regional government exaggerates climate threat or accelerates evacuation timeline to trigger displacement declaration for political advantage — e.g., to dilute opposing political constituency in other Regions. |
| G10 | 5% Cap Bottleneck | Multiple Regions simultaneously hit the 5% cap. Remaining Regions lack capacity. Displaced citizens have nowhere to go despite federal coordination. The cap creates a mathematical impossibility. |
| G11 | Benefit Tourism | Non-displaced citizens relocate to receiving Region and claim displacement status for enhanced services (100% reimbursed housing, employment services). Verification of genuine displacement becomes administrative challenge. |
| G12 | Pre-emptive Evacuation Gaming | Region declares areas "uninhabitable" prematurely — before actual climate event — to access Climate Adaptation Fund resources or to trigger displacement for strategic reasons. |
| G13 | Perpetual Emergency | Displacement Emergency declared and never terminated. Federal plenary authority over resettlement becomes permanent federal power over Regional housing and land use. Emergency becomes normal governance. |
| G14 | Credential Arbitrage | Displaced professionals claim credential recognition in receiving Region for credentials that would normally require supplemental requirements under Art I §9. Displacement used to circumvent ARB-certified supplemental standards. |
| G15 | Congressional Non-Concurrence | President declares Displacement Emergency; Congress fails to concur within 30 days (political obstruction). Declaration expires while millions remain displaced. Political hostage-taking through procedural delay. |

## 7. Verification Questions

**V1: Does Art I §8(f-o) (Migration Surge Stabilization) provide any mechanism for federal coordination of migration distribution across Regions, or only fiscal support to individual receiving Regions?**

**Answer**: FISCAL SUPPORT ONLY. Art I §8(h) provides equalization transfers, §8(i) provides infrastructure grants and federal personnel, §8(l) provides origin Region contribution. No provision coordinates distribution or allocation of migrants among Regions. Each receiving Region is supported independently.

**V2: Does Art XVII §3(a) (Natural Disaster emergency powers) authorize resettlement planning, cross-Regional coordination, or population allocation?**

**Answer**: NO. Art XVII §3(a) authorizes: (1) deployment of federal resources for rescue, relief, and recovery; (2) waiver of administrative requirements; (3) coordination of response efforts; (4) temporary housing and shelter assistance. "Coordination of response efforts" could arguably extend to cross-Regional coordination, but "population allocation" is not enumerated.

**V3: Does Art I §8(j) (Anti-Degradation Mandate) prevent a Region from using Art XVII-RF §1 emergency declaration to limit absorption of displaced citizens?**

**Answer**: AMBIGUOUS. Art I §8(j) prohibits intentional service degradation "for the purpose of deterring in-migration." But Art XVII-RF §1 authorizes Regional Governors to declare emergencies for matters within Regional authority. A Region could argue its emergency declaration is about infrastructure capacity, not migration deterrence. The interaction between anti-degradation and emergency powers is not resolved.

**V4: Does the existing 30-day maximum voting registration period (Art I §8(b)) already ensure displaced citizens can vote in receiving Regions?**

**Answer**: YES, for receiving Region voting. Art I §8(b) states voting registration waiting periods shall not exceed 30 days. Displaced citizens can register in receiving Regions within 30 days. However, this does not address voting retention in origin Region (for citizens who have not yet established new permanent residence), dual-voting prevention, or origin Region representation collapse.

**V5: Could the existing Cyclical Stabilization Fund (Art X §9(c), 0.5% GDP) and Migration Surge Fund (Art I §8(m), 0.1% federal revenue) be used for climate displacement costs without a new fund?**

**Answer**: PARTIALLY. The Cyclical Stabilization Fund (Art X §9(c)) is triggered by economic divergence (2 SD from national mean) and is "dedicated exclusively to asymmetric shock response." Climate displacement would likely trigger the economic shock indicator. However, the Fund's purpose is cyclical economic stabilization, not displacement infrastructure. The Migration Surge Fund (Art I §8(m)) is more directly applicable but is sized at 0.1% federal revenue — likely insufficient for catastrophic displacement (5 million people). Neither fund is pre-funded based on climate projections or linked to carbon revenue.

- **Capacity-based allocation** (D5) — is mandatory allocation of citizens consistent with individual liberty?
- **Displaced citizen voting** (D7) — origin Region retention vs. immediate receiving Region integration
- **Climate Fund constitutionalization** (D8) — should the fund or only the principle be constitutional?
- **Anti-gaming for infrastructure defense** (D12, G1, G5) — how to distinguish legitimate capacity limits from pretextual exclusion
- **Origin Region dissolution** (D11) — what happens to the Region itself?
