## 1. Problem Statement

Regions could design social benefits (pensions, health trusts, educational accounts) with forfeiture provisions that strip citizens of vested benefits if they move to another Region. A wealthy Region establishes a generous "Regional Pension" funded by decades of payroll taxes, then writes law requiring continuous residency to maintain benefits. Citizens with 20+ years of contributions cannot afford to leave — the Right to Travel exists on paper but is economically nullified through coercion rather than legal barriers.

## 2. Existing Provisions (Overlap ~45-50%, MODERATE)

### 2.1 Provisions that partially address the concern

| Provision | What it covers | What it misses |
|---|---|---|
| **Art I §8(o)** — Exit Penalty Prohibition | "tax, fee, debt obligation, or financial penalty" conditioned on relocation; tuition assistance contracts limited to actual principal + interest | Does NOT cover benefit forfeiture — a Region can argue pension loss is not a "penalty" but simply the end of a residency-based program |
| **Art I §8(a)-(b)** — Freedom of Movement | Right to travel, establish residence, seek employment; 90-day waiting period cap for public services | Protects incoming access; silent on outgoing benefit retention |
| **Art I §8(d)** — Transition Periods | "reasonable transition periods for benefit eligibility where portability is ensured" | Permissive language — allows transition periods, does not mandate portability |
| **Art X §20** — Pension Discipline | Full accrual funding, actuarial honesty, ARC requirements, IFC oversight, automatic contribution triggers | Ensures pensions are *funded*, not *portable*; disciplined funding actually makes retention leverage stronger |
| **Art X §20(h)(2)** — Earned Benefits | Benefits already earned may not be retroactively modified in insolvency | Only in Sovereign Reorganization context; does not cover voluntary forfeiture clauses in benefit design |
| **Art X §20(e)(2)** — Pension Spiking | Prohibits artificial inflation of final average salary | Addresses one gaming vector but not residency-based forfeiture |
| **Art X §15(b-1)** — Legacy Burden Factor | Equalization for Regions with high pension loads | Aggregate fiscal support for Regions; does not address individual benefit portability |
| **Art I §8(ff)-(jj)** — Tax Residency/Arbitrage | Tax residency rules, benefit arbitrage prohibition | Prevents gaming the system for benefit *shopping*; silent on benefit *forfeiture* |

### 2.2 Provision that ENABLES the vulnerability

| Provision | How it enables the attack vector |
|---|---|
| **Art II §2(3)** — Regional Exclusive Domains | Regions have "plenary authority" over social programs, public health, education — creating the autonomy to design forfeiture provisions |
| **Art I §8(d)** — Transition Period Allowance | "reasonable transition periods for benefit eligibility" could be read as permitting extended vesting periods that function as traps |

### 2.3 Provision that creates TENSION

| Provision | Tension |
|---|---|
| **Art I §8(o)** — Exit Penalty language | The word "penalty" is the crux. If forfeiture of vested benefits is a "penalty," it's already prohibited. If it's merely the end of a program, it's not. Constitutional text should not depend on this ambiguity. |
| **Art X §20(h)(2)** — Insolvency protection | Protects earned benefits in insolvency but not in voluntary relocation. Creates an anomaly: your pension is safer if your Region goes bankrupt than if you move. |

## 3. Proposed Placement

### Primary option: Art I §8, new subsections after §8(o)

- **Natural home:** §8 is the Freedom of Movement section; §8(o) already addresses exit penalties; benefit portability is the logical extension
- §8(o) currently covers "tax, fee, debt obligation, or financial penalty" — new subsections would close the benefit forfeiture gap
- Keeps all mobility protections consolidated in one location
- Pattern: §8(o) = exit penalty prohibition (stick), new subsections = benefit portability mandate (substance)

### Alternative A: Art X §20, new subsections

- Pro: §20 is the pension discipline section, IFC oversight is already specified
- Con: §20 addresses fiscal management of pensions, not citizen mobility rights; portability is a rights issue, not a funding discipline issue
- Con: Would fragment mobility protections across two articles

### Alternative B: Art III §8 (new section in Rights Floors)

- Pro: The proposal targets this location; benefit portability is a rights floor
- Con: Art III currently has Sections 1-7 with no §8; creating it here separates the provision from both the Freedom of Movement framework (Art I §8) and the pension discipline framework (Art X §20)
- Con: Art III §1 already establishes that rights are "floors not ceilings" — the mechanism belongs in Art I where the mobility floor is operationalized

### Recommendation: Art I §8(q)-(v) (new subsections after existing §8(p))

Extends the Freedom of Movement section with benefit portability provisions, keeping the exit penalty prohibition (§8(o)) and the new portability mandate together as a coherent package. Cross-reference to Art X §20 for actuarial standards.

## 4. Design Questions

### D1. Is Art I §8(o) already sufficient if read broadly?

"Financial penalty conditioned upon a person's decision to leave" could encompass benefit forfeiture. But:

- (A) If yes, just add a clarifying sentence to §8(o) stating forfeiture of vested benefits is included
- (B) If no, create new subsections with explicit portability mandate and anti-gaming provisions
- (C) Even if legally sufficient, the gaming vectors (loyalty bonus, administrative barrier) require specific prophylactic text

### D2. Scope — public benefits only, or include private pensions?

The proposal extends to "private pension plans operating under Regional regulatory authority." Consider:

- (A) Public pensions only — Regions cannot be held responsible for private employer decisions
- (B) Public + private pensions under Regional regulatory authority — prevents Regions from outsourcing forfeiture to private plans
- (C) Public + private + any employer operating in the Region — broadest scope, but raises Commerce Clause concerns

### D3. Which institution for actuarial disputes?

The proposal assigns valuation methodology to the Federal Reserve Board. But:

- (A) **IFC (Independent Fiscal Council)** — already handles pension actuarial standards under Art X §20, has the Pension Actuarial Division, established expertise
- (B) Federal Reserve Board — proposed by Gap 181, but the Fed's expertise is monetary policy, not pension valuation
- (C) ARB (Allocation Review Board) — mediates inter-Regional disputes, could handle actuarial disputes
- (D) IFC sets methodology, ARB resolves individual disputes

### D4. Vesting schedule — 5-year cap appropriate?

The proposal sets 5-year maximum vesting. Consider:

- ERISA (current federal law) requires 3-year cliff or 6-year graded vesting for employer contributions
- 5-year cap is within the ERISA range
- But public pension systems often have longer vesting (10-20 years currently)
- Too short may burden Regions with immediate liabilities for short-term residents
- Too long enables the "vesting marathon" gaming vector

### D5. Loyalty bonus cap — 10% maximum appropriate?

The proposal caps "loyalty bonuses" at 10%. Consider:

- Any differential creates some retention incentive — where to draw the line?
- 10% means a $50,000/year pension can only offer $5,000/year residency bonus
- Is 10% enough to deter, or will Regions set it at exactly 10%?
- Alternative: ban residency-differential benefits entirely (0% cap)
- Alternative: tie to cost-of-living differential (portable but adjusted for local cost)

### D6. Portability mechanism — continue payment or transfer value?

The proposal offers two options: (i) continue payment regardless of residence, or (ii) transfer actuarial value to destination. Consider:

- Continued payment is simpler (no valuation dispute) but creates ongoing liability for originating Region
- Transfer eliminates ongoing liability but creates valuation disputes
- What if destination Region has no equivalent system?
- What about partial vesting — pro-rata transfer?
- Real-world model: Social Security is federally portable; state pensions are generally not

### D7. How to distinguish portability from benefit arbitrage?

Art I §8(ff)-(jj) prohibits benefit arbitrage. New portability mandates must not enable:

- Contributing in a low-cost Region, then transferring to a high-benefit Region
- "Benefit shopping" across Regional systems
- The "destination penalty" gaming vector exploits this tension

### D8. What about healthcare trust portability?

The proposal mentions "health trusts" alongside pensions. Healthcare portability raises different issues:

- Healthcare benefits are typically current (not vested/accrued)
- A Region might require residents to use its healthcare system
- Portability of healthcare trusts could mean continuing care out-of-network
- Should healthcare be treated differently from pensions?

### D9. What about educational accounts?

The proposal mentions "educational accounts." Consider:

- 529-type education savings accounts
- Regional scholarship programs with residency requirements
- Are these "vested benefits" or conditional grants?
- Current law: 529 accounts are already portable

### D10. Administrative barrier anti-gaming — what standard?

The proposal prohibits "administrative barriers that make portability impractical." But:

- Some administrative process is inevitable (verification, calculation, transfer)
- What time limit for processing? (30 days? 60 days? 90 days?)
- What happens if processing is delayed? (automatic approval? continued payment?)
- Who determines if a barrier is "impractical"?

### D11. Interaction with Art X §20(h) — earned benefit protection in insolvency?

Art X §20(h)(2) says earned benefits may not be retroactively modified in insolvency. Should the portability mandate:

- (A) Apply the same protection outside insolvency (benefits earned = benefits kept, regardless of where you live)
- (B) Make cross-reference: "For purposes of this section, vested benefits have the same earned-benefit protection as under Art X §20(h)(2)"
- (C) Create an independent standard

### D12. Enforcement — private right of action sufficient?

The proposal provides private right of action with treble damages. Consider:

- (A) Private right of action only — citizen sues in federal court
- (B) IFC enforcement — systematic monitoring through pension audits
- (C) AG enforcement — injunctive authority against non-compliant Regional benefit systems
- (D) Combination: IFC detects through audits, AG enjoins, citizen sues for damages

### D13. Should there be a de minimis exception?

Should very small benefit programs be exempt?

- Small municipal pension supplements
- One-time relocation bonuses from local governments
- Amounts below a threshold (e.g., $500/year)
- Risk: creates gaming vector ("divide big program into many small ones")

## 5. Gaming Vectors

### From the proposal (4)

| # | Vector | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| G1 | The "Loyalty Bonus" | 25% residency bonus added to benefits; technically not forfeiture since you get base amount; strong disincentive to move |
| G2 | The "Administrative Barrier" | Benefits "portable" in theory but transfer requires extensive paperwork, approvals; processing takes years; benefits suspended during review |
| G3 | The "Vesting Marathon" | Full vesting requires 40 years of continuous residency; moving resets clock entirely; most citizens never fully vest |
| G4 | The "Destination Penalty" | Benefits reduced based on destination Region; "cost-of-living adjustment" claimed as preventing arbitrage; actually punishes Right to Travel |

### Additional gaming vectors (8)

| # | Vector | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| G5 | The "Employer Match Retention" | Employee contributions portable (they're "yours"), but employer match forfeited; "employer contributed, employer's rules"; effectively halves benefit upon departure |
| G6 | The "Cost-of-Living Adjustment" | Benefits recalculated for "lower cost" destination Region; $60K pension becomes $35K when moving from Northeast to Southeast; framed as actuarial fairness, actually penalizes migration |
| G7 | The "Successor Plan Gap" | Originating Region transfers value, but destination Region's plan has its own enrollment waiting period (90 days, 1 year); citizen has neither old benefits nor new during the gap |
| G8 | The "Defined Contribution Switch" | Region converts defined-benefit pension to defined-contribution on departure; employee bears all investment risk; actuarial value "preserved" but risk profile dramatically worsened |
| G9 | The "Spousal Trap" | Benefits tied to both spouses' residency; one spouse leaving forfeits other's benefits too; traps entire families rather than individuals |
| G10 | The "Retiree Return Requirement" | Benefits continue after departure, but recipient must "verify eligibility" in person annually; travel burden creates de facto residency requirement for elderly and disabled |
| G11 | The "Retroactive Reclassification" | After citizen announces departure, Region retroactively reclassifies their benefit category; "your contributions were actually toward Program B which requires continuous residency" |
| G12 | The "Private Plan Outsourcing" | Region mandates all employers use Region-designed pension template; template includes residency forfeiture; Region claims "private employers set their own terms" |

## 6. Verification Questions

### V1. Does the new text close the Art I §8(o) ambiguity?

Art I §8(o) covers "tax, fee, debt obligation, or financial penalty." The new text must make clear that forfeiture of vested benefits IS covered, either by amending §8(o)'s language or by creating a standalone prohibition that removes any argument that benefit loss is not a "penalty."

### V2. Does the new text prevent the loyalty bonus vector?

A residency-differential benefit that technically preserves the "base" amount while adding a large bonus for staying creates the same retention effect as forfeiture. The cap must be precise and enforceable.

### V3. Does the new text address administrative barriers with specific deadlines?

"Portability" is meaningless if processing takes years. Specific time limits for transfer processing and continued-payment obligations during processing are essential.

### V4. Does the new text reconcile with the benefit arbitrage prohibition?

Art I §8(ff)-(jj) prohibits benefit arbitrage (shopping for the best deal). New portability rules must not enable strategic migration to maximize benefits. The line between "portability" and "arbitrage" must be precise.

### V5. Does the new text address private pensions without overreaching?

Extending to private plans is necessary to prevent outsourcing, but the scope must respect the distinction between Regional regulatory authority and private contract law.

## 7. Draft Text Direction

The new subsections should:

1. **Amend Art I §8(o)** to explicitly include "forfeiture or reduction of vested benefits" in the exit penalty definition
2. **Mandate portability** — originating Region must either continue payment or transfer actuarial value (citizen's choice)
3. **Cap vesting schedules** at [5] years with proportional partial vesting; departure may not reset clocks
4. **Prohibit residency-differential benefits** exceeding [10%] of base benefit value
5. **Set processing deadlines** with automatic continued-payment during transfer
6. **Assign IFC** (not Federal Reserve) for actuarial methodology and dispute resolution
7. **Extend to private plans** regulated by the Region, with safe harbor for nationally-regulated plans
8. **Address gaming vectors** — employer match portability, cost-of-living adjustments, successor plan gaps, spousal traps, verification requirements, retroactive reclassification
9. **Enforce** through IFC audit detection, AG injunctive authority, private right of action with fee-shifting

Recommended structure: Art I §8(q)-(v), five subsections covering portability mandate, forfeiture prohibition with anti-gaming, vesting limits, actuarial procedures, and enforcement. Plus amend §8(o) to add "forfeiture or reduction of vested benefits" to the covered categories.
