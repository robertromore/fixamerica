# Briefing: Gap 8 — Rights-Floor Content and Enforcement Detail

## 1. Problem

The constitution establishes rights floors as a structural principle (Article III, Section 1: "Federal rights and standards establish minimum protections only") but does not enumerate specific floor content or provide a sub-constitutional mechanism for establishing new floors. Analysis documents assume baseline bodily autonomy protections, core gun rights, labor rights floors, and anti-discrimination guarantees, but actual floor definitions require implementation legislation and judicial interpretation.

**Risks:**

- Rights floors may be defined narrowly or unevenly across administrations
- Judicial interpretation may diverge from design intent
- Political conflict over floor content may replicate current nationalized battles
- Without a defined process, the "floors, not ceilings" principle remains aspirational rather than operational

## 2. Coverage Analysis

**Existing provisions:**

| Provision | What It Does | What It Lacks |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Art III §1 (Floors, Not Ceilings) | Structural principle | No process for establishing floors |
| Art III §2 (Subsidiarity) | General authority principle | No floor-specific mechanism |
| Art III §3 (Hierarchy of Law) | Supremacy structure | No floor-setting process |
| Art III §4 (Unwaivable Core) | Specific enumerated rights against contractual waiver | Not a general floor-setting mechanism |
| Art II §3-A (Rights Floor Enforcement Constraints) | Limits congressional enforcement to enumerated rights | No mechanism for creating new enumerated floor standards |
| Art II §4(h)-(k) (Constitutional Labor/Safety Minimums) | Self-executing constitutional provisions for labor | Limited to labor/safety; no expandable process |
| Art XXIII §11 (DLRS and Transition - Tribal) | Tribal applicability provisions | References DLRS as a mechanism that doesn't yet exist in the constitution |

**What's missing:**

- Process for establishing NEW rights floors below the constitutional amendment threshold
- Enumeration of which domains may have sub-constitutional floors
- Procedural safeguards for floor-setting (dual consent, ratification, judicial review)
- Ratchet mechanism ensuring floors cannot be lowered by ordinary legislation
- Registry and transparency infrastructure for floor standards
- Coordination between DLRS and existing Art II §3-A enforcement constraints

## 3. Related Gaps

| Gap | Description | Interaction |
|-----|-------------|-------------|
| 7 | Implementation act dependency and statutory capture | DLRS process parallels Art XXI §2-A anti-obstruction provisions |
| 16 | Inter-regional cooperation mechanisms | DLRS floors apply uniformly across Regions, reducing cooperation friction |
| 27 | Tribal-Regional relations | Art XXIII §11 already provides DLRS opt-in provisions for tribal nations; subsection (s)(3) cross-references |
| 217 | Terms of Service Trap (Contractual Feudalism) | Art III §4 (Unwaivable Core) protects against contractual waiver; DLRS floors supplement |
| 226 | Citizenship Void | Art III §5 citizenship provisions interact with DLRS standing provisions |

## 4. Proposed Approach

Incorporate the Dual-Legitimacy Rights-Floor Statute (DLRS) mechanism as **Article III, Section 10** of the Regional Federal Constitution. This follows the existing [DLRS Proposal](../../proposals/01-foundations/dual-legitimacy-rights-floor-statute.md) with format conversion to constitutional style, coordination provisions, and hardening based on four-source review synthesis.

Additionally, add a one-line surgical amendment to **Article II, Section 3-A(a)** to explicitly recognize DLRS-established rights.

**Changes from proposal to constitutional text (v2):**

1. **Format conversion**: 32 DLRS provisions from decimal notation (3.1-3.32) to standard constitutional subsection format (a)-(jj)
2. **Internal cross-reference update**: All internal references converted to subsection format
3. **Ratchet revised**: Two-tier system — raising floors by standard DLRS dual consent; lowering by elevated dual consent (60% referendum + 3/4 Regions); ordinary legislation cannot touch floors
4. **Sunsets restricted**: Substantive rights floors may not sunset; sunsets permitted only for funding, administrative bodies, and pilot programs
5. **Art II §3-A surgical amendment**: New subparagraph (iii) explicitly recognizing DLRS-established rights
6. **"Lowering" defined**: Explicit definition covering scope narrowing, exemption expansion, and definitional contraction
7. **Effective compliance standard**: Compliance assessed by functional implementation, not merely formal legal conformity
8. **IEC role slimmed**: Substantial similarity determinations moved to ARB; IEC retains referendum administration
9. **Tribal provisions harmonized**: With Art XXIII §11 (removed 24-month notice; added partial consent)
10. **15 additional hardening provisions** from four-source review

The statutory template, domain selection rationale, model examples, and hostile reinterpretation stress test remain in the [proposals directory](../../proposals/01-foundations/dual-legitimacy-rights-floor-statute.md) as implementing guidance.

## 5. Proposed Constitutional Text

### Art II §3-A(a) Amendment

Add new subparagraph (iii) to Article II, Section 3-A(a):

- (iii) The right has been established through the Dual-Legitimacy Rights-Floor process of Article III, Section 10.

### Art III §10. Dual-Legitimacy Rights-Floor Statute

*Resolves Gap 8 — Rights-Floor Content and Enforcement Detail. Establishes a sub-constitutional dual-consent process for setting rights floors within five enumerated domains, requiring both national popular referendum approval and two-thirds Regional ratification. Floors may be raised by standard DLRS dual consent, and lowered only by DLRS with elevated dual consent (sixty percent referendum plus three-fourths Regional ratification), creating a democratic ratchet that protects minimum standards while preserving Regional authority to exceed them and permitting correction of unworkable floors without requiring full constitutional amendment.*

#### Definition and Scope

(a) **Definition.** A Dual-Legitimacy Rights-Floor Statute (DLRS) is a federal law that sets minimum rights or protections within the enumerated floor domains in subsection (h). A DLRS may not set ceilings, preempt higher Regional or State standards, or reallocate powers beyond floors.

(b) **Floor and Ceiling Distinction.** For purposes of this Section:

- (1) A floor establishes a minimum standard that Regions and States must meet or exceed.
- (2) A ceiling restricts the ability of Regions or States to provide greater protections, broader access, or more stringent standards than the DLRS mandates.
- (3) A provision that mandates a specific method, excludes alternatives, or prohibits stricter standards constitutes a ceiling and is beyond DLRS authority, except that a provision mandating a specific method does not constitute a ceiling if Regions or States may employ alternative methods that provide demonstrably equivalent or superior protection of the underlying right, as certified by the Allocation Review Board.
- (4) A provision that establishes minimum access, minimum protections, or minimum procedural safeguards while permitting Regions and States to exceed those minimums constitutes a floor.

#### Initiation and Ratification

(c) **Initiation.** A DLRS may be proposed by:

- (1) a three-fifths vote of the House of Representatives; or
- (2) two-thirds of Regional Legislatures acting jointly.

(d) **Dual Consent.** A DLRS that raises floor standards or establishes new floor standards takes effect only upon:

- (1) approval by a majority of votes cast in a national popular referendum, administered by Regions pursuant to Article VII, Section 1, with results certified by the Independent Election Commission; and
- (2) ratification by two-thirds of Regions.

(e) **Regional Method (Hybrid).** Each Region may ratify by either:

- (1) Regional Legislature; or
- (2) Regional Referendum.

Each Region must fix its chosen method by public law at least 12 months before any DLRS proposal; no method changes may occur during an active ratification window. If a Region has not fixed its ratification method at the time of proposal, ratification shall require approval by the Regional Legislature.

(f) **Ratification Window.** Ratification must occur within two years of proposal. If dual consent is not achieved, the DLRS fails.

(g) **Cooling-Off Period.** A DLRS that fails ratification may not be re-proposed in substantially similar form for 24 months following the close of the failed ratification window.

- (1) The Allocation Review Board shall determine substantial similarity through a public notice-and-comment process.
- (2) Upon receiving a new DLRS proposal, the Board shall publish the proposal and invite public comment for 30 days on whether it is substantially similar to a failed proposal within the cooling-off period.
- (3) The Board shall issue a written determination with findings within 60 days of proposal submission.
- (4) A proposal is substantially similar if it meets any of the following criteria:
    - (i) addresses the same floor domain and establishes floor standards that, for numerical standards, differ by less than 20 percent from the failed proposal's standards;
    - (ii) addresses the same floor domain and establishes floor standards that are functionally equivalent or differ only in minor procedural details without changing the substantive protection provided;
    - (iii) does not address materially different circumstances or evidence but serves the same specific policy objective through materially identical means, regardless of minor variations in numerical standards; or
    - (iv) when assessed in its totality, achieves a net substantive protection materially equivalent to the failed proposal notwithstanding individual variations in specific provisions.
- (5) The Board's determination is subject to de novo judicial review within 30 days of publication.
- (6) If no challenge is filed within 30 days, the determination is final.

#### Enumerated Domains and Substantive Rules

(h) **Enumerated Floor Domains.** DLRS authority is limited to:

- (1) voting access and election process floors;
- (2) due process and basic civil procedure floors;
- (3) anti-discrimination and equal protection floors;
- (4) labor rights and minimum safety floors; and
- (5) public integrity and anti-corruption floors.

Additional domains require constitutional amendment.

(i) **Ratchet.**

- (1) Floors may be raised by DLRS enacted through the dual-consent process of subsection (d).
- (2) Floors may be lowered by DLRS enacted through an elevated dual-consent process requiring: (A) approval by not less than sixty percent (60%) of votes cast in a national popular referendum; and (B) ratification by three-fourths of Regions.
- (3) Floors may not be lowered, suspended, or repealed by ordinary federal legislation, executive order, regulation, or any mechanism other than subsection (i)(2) or constitutional amendment.
- (4) For purposes of this subsection, "lowering" is defined in subsection (ii).

(j) **Judicial Review.** Courts may review DLRS for:

- (1) procedural compliance with this Section;
- (2) domain scope — whether the DLRS falls within an enumerated floor domain;
- (3) single-subject compliance under subsection (k);
- (4) ceiling conversion — whether any provision constitutes a ceiling under subsection (b); and
- (5) conflict with other constitutional provisions.

All DLRS challenges are subject to mandatory jurisdiction and time-bound review as defined in Article XIV.

(k) **Single Subject.** Each DLRS shall address one floor domain only. A DLRS that addresses multiple domains is void in its entirety.

(l) **Regional Ratification Duty.** Each Region shall conduct its ratification process within 18 months of proposal.

- (1) If a Region fails to complete ratification within this period, the Region is deemed to have abstained.
- (2) Abstention counts neither for nor against the ratification threshold; the threshold is calculated based on Regions that have ratified or rejected.
- (3) A DLRS achieves regional ratification only if ratified by the required proportion of participating Regions and by at least a majority of all Regions. This absolute majority requirement may not be circumvented by abstention.
- (4) If fewer than five Regions have ratified or rejected by the 18-month deadline, the ratification window is extended by 6 months.
- (5) The Independent Election Commission shall publish monthly compliance reports on regional ratification progress beginning 6 months after proposal.

(m) **Emergency Non-Suspension.** Rights floors established by DLRS may not be suspended, waived, or diminished during any emergency declared under Article XVII.

- (1) Any emergency measure that conflicts with a DLRS floor is void to the extent of the conflict.
- (2) This prohibition applies regardless of the nature, scope, or duration of the emergency.
- (3) Courts shall have mandatory jurisdiction to hear claims that emergency measures violate DLRS floors, with expedited review as provided in Article XIV.

(n) **DLRS Conflicts.** Where two or more DLRS provisions conflict:

- (1) the provision that provides greater protection to the individual prevails;
- (2) if relative protection is indeterminate, the more recently ratified DLRS prevails;
- (3) courts shall construe DLRS provisions to harmonize where possible before finding conflict;
- (4) a finding of conflict does not invalidate either DLRS; it determines which provision governs in the specific circumstance.

(o) **Pre-Ratification Review.**

- (1) No court may enjoin or invalidate a DLRS proposal before dual consent is achieved, except as provided in paragraph (5).
- (2) Pre-ratification challenges to DLRS proposals are not justiciable, except as provided in paragraph (5).
- (3) Challenges to DLRS validity may be brought only after certification of dual consent and only within 180 days of the effective date.
- (4) A DLRS that has been in effect for more than 180 days without successful challenge is presumptively valid; subsequent challenges must demonstrate clear constitutional violation.
- (5) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), a court may enjoin a DLRS proposal before dual consent if the proposal facially and indisputably falls outside the enumerated floor domains of subsection (h). Such challenges must be filed within 30 days of proposal and resolved within 60 days.
- (6) For purposes of this subsection, the effective date of a DLRS is the date on which the Independent Election Commission certifies dual consent under subsection (p)(5), unless the DLRS itself specifies a later effective date, in which case the later date governs.

(p) **Timing of Dual Consent.**

- (1) The national referendum and regional ratification may proceed concurrently or sequentially within the ratification window.
- (2) Neither form of consent is contingent on the other being completed first.
- (3) If one form of consent is achieved before the other, the achieved consent remains valid for the duration of the ratification window.
- (4) Certification of dual consent occurs when both requirements have been met, regardless of sequence.
- (5) The Independent Election Commission shall certify dual consent within 14 days of the later of the two consent events.

(q) **Proposal Limits.**

- (1) No more than three DLRS proposals may be placed on a national ballot in any 12-month period.
- (2) If more than three proposals are pending, the Independent Election Commission shall schedule them for successive referendum dates in order of proposal date.
- (3) This limitation does not extend the ratification window for delayed proposals; proposals that cannot be scheduled within their ratification window fail.
- (4) Congress may by two-thirds vote waive this limitation for a specific proposal upon finding exceptional circumstances.

#### Applicability, Standing, and Transition

(r) **Transition Period.**

- (1) No DLRS may be proposed until Phase V of the Constitutional Transition Act is complete and full activation has occurred.
- (2) During Phases III and IV, Congress may prepare draft DLRS for consideration upon full activation; such drafts have no legal effect until formally proposed.
- (3) The first DLRS proposals may be submitted beginning 90 days after Phase V completion.
- (4) Draft DLRS prepared during transition are not subject to the cooling-off period provisions of subsection (g).

(s) **Territorial Applicability.**

- (1) DLRS floors apply to the District of Columbia and incorporated territories.
- (2) Unincorporated territories may opt in to DLRS coverage by resolution of their legislature; such opt-in is irrevocable for the duration of the DLRS.
- (3) Tribal nations are not subject to DLRS unless they consent by formal action of their governing body as provided in Article XXIII, Section 11. Consent may be revoked by the same formal process. Partial consent to specific DLRS provisions is permitted as provided in Article XXIII, Section 11(a)(3). A Tribal Nation that partially consents is subject to the consented provisions for purposes of standing, enforcement, and compliance under this Section.
- (4) For purposes of regional ratification, territories assigned to Regions under Article XX participate through their Region's ratification process.
- (5) Nothing in this Section diminishes tribal sovereignty or self-governance rights.

(t) **Standing.**

- (1) Any person subject to a DLRS floor standard has standing to challenge its validity or seek its enforcement.
- (2) Any Region or State has standing to challenge a DLRS on procedural or domain-scope grounds.
- (3) Standing is not limited by the political question doctrine; DLRS challenges are justiciable.
- (4) Organizational standing is permitted where members would have individual standing.
- (5) The responsible federal agency has standing to enforce DLRS against non-compliant Regions or States.

#### Interpretation and Amendment

(u) **Interpretation.**

- (1) DLRS provisions shall be construed liberally to effectuate their protective purpose.
- (2) Ambiguities shall be resolved in favor of greater protection for individuals.
- (3) DLRS floors establish minimums, not optimal standards; higher standards are presumptively valid.
- (4) Legislative history and pre-referendum impact statements may be consulted but are not dispositive.
- (5) Subsequent DLRS in the same domain shall be construed to supplement, not replace, prior DLRS unless explicit repeal language is included.

(v) **Amendment and Replacement.**

- (1) A DLRS may be amended to raise specific floor standards without replacing the entire statute; such amendments require full dual consent under subsection (d).
- (2) A DLRS may be replaced by a subsequent DLRS in the same domain; the replacement must explicitly identify provisions superseded. The Independent Election Commission shall publish a certified side-by-side comparison of the replacement and superseded DLRS during the pre-referendum comment period.
- (3) A replacement DLRS may not add sunset provisions under subsection (w) to any floor standard that was not already subject to sunset in the DLRS it supersedes. Floor standards carried forward from a prior DLRS retain their non-sunset status.
- (4) Implicit repeal is disfavored; courts shall harmonize overlapping DLRS where possible under subsection (n).
- (5) Technical corrections may be made by concurrent resolution of Congress and two-thirds of Regional Legislatures without referendum, subject to certification by the Independent Election Commission that the correction does not alter substantive floor standards. A technical correction may change only typographical errors, grammatical errors, internal cross-reference numbering, and formatting. A technical correction may not change any word or number that appears in a substantive floor standard, compliance deadline, threshold, penalty, or definition.
- (6) Proposed technical corrections shall be published for 60-day public comment before the concurrent resolution takes effect. Any person or Region may file an objection, which triggers automatic judicial review within 30 days.

(w) **Sunset Limitations.**

- (1) Substantive rights floors established by DLRS may not be subject to sunset provisions.
- (2) Sunset provisions are permitted only for:
    - (i) specific funding appropriations attached to the DLRS;
    - (ii) temporary administrative bodies created to implement the DLRS; or
    - (iii) pilot programs explicitly designated as temporary, provided the pilot program does not itself establish a floor standard.
- (3) The expiration of funding or administrative provisions under this subsection does not extinguish the underlying right or floor standard.
- (4) Sunset provisions permitted under paragraph (2) shall not exceed 15 years from effective date.
- (5) Sunset provisions may not be added by technical correction; they must be included in the original DLRS or added by amendment under subsection (v).

(x) **External Standards References.**

- (1) A DLRS may incorporate external standards by reference only if:
    - (i) the external standard is publicly available at no cost or at reasonable cost with public library access;
    - (ii) the reference specifies either a fixed version (static incorporation) or permits updates (dynamic incorporation);
    - (iii) the reference includes a floor fallback if the external standard is discontinued or becomes unavailable.
- (2) Dynamic incorporation of external standards that would lower floors below the highest level previously in effect under the dynamic incorporation is void; the highest previously effective floor level continues in effect.
- (3) The DLRS Registry shall track incorporated external standards and their current versions.
- (4) The responsible federal agency shall notify Congress and Regional Legislatures within 30 days if an incorporated external standard is materially revised or discontinued.

(y) **Regional Boundary Changes.**

- (1) If a Region splits during a DLRS ratification window:
    - (i) the original Region's ratification status applies to successor Regions until they independently act;
    - (ii) successor Regions may independently ratify or reject within 6 months of formal recognition as separate Regions.
- (2) If Regions merge during a DLRS ratification window:
    - (i) if both predecessor Regions ratified, the merged Region is deemed to have ratified;
    - (ii) if neither predecessor Region ratified, the merged Region is deemed not to have ratified;
    - (iii) if ratification status differed, the merged Region must affirmatively act within 6 months of merger.
- (3) Boundary adjustments not affecting Regional identity do not alter ratification status.
- (4) For DLRS already in effect, boundary changes do not affect applicability; DLRS floors apply to all territory within recognized Regions.

(z) **Minority Rights Protection.**

- (1) No DLRS floor standard shall be construed or applied to:
    - (i) diminish existing constitutional protections for discrete and insular minorities;
    - (ii) authorize discrimination prohibited elsewhere in this Constitution;
    - (iii) prevent Regions from providing heightened protections to vulnerable populations.
- (2) Courts reviewing DLRS challenges shall apply heightened scrutiny where a floor standard is alleged to have disparate impact on constitutionally protected groups.
- (3) The pre-referendum impact statement shall include analysis of potential disparate impacts on protected groups.
- (4) If a court finds that a DLRS provision has unjustified disparate impact, it may sever that provision while preserving the remainder of the DLRS.

(aa) **Treaty Obligations.**

- (1) DLRS floor standards shall be construed consistently with binding treaty obligations of the United States where possible.
- (2) Where a treaty establishes a higher standard than a DLRS floor, the treaty standard governs.
- (3) Where a DLRS floor establishes a higher standard than a treaty minimum, the DLRS floor governs domestically.
- (4) Nothing in this Section affects the constitutional status of treaties or the treaty-making powers as provided in this Constitution.
- (5) A DLRS may not be used to circumvent treaty obligations or to effectively withdraw from treaty commitments without following constitutional procedures.

#### Administration and Transparency

(bb) **DLRS Registry.**

- (1) The Independent Election Commission shall maintain a public DLRS Registry containing:
    - (i) all proposed, pending, ratified, and failed DLRS;
    - (ii) full text, ratification history, and effective dates;
    - (iii) indexed standard values and adjustment history;
    - (iv) compliance status by Region as certified under each DLRS.
- (2) The Registry shall be publicly accessible online at no cost.
- (3) Official DLRS text is the version in the Registry; any conflict with other publications is resolved in favor of the Registry.
- (4) The Registry shall be updated within 7 days of any change in status.

(cc) **Turnout Disclosure.**

- (1) The Independent Election Commission shall publish, alongside referendum results:
    - (i) total votes cast;
    - (ii) turnout as percentage of registered voters;
    - (iii) turnout as percentage of voting-eligible population;
    - (iv) turnout compared to most recent federal election.
- (2) Low turnout does not invalidate a DLRS that achieves the required approval threshold under subsection (d)(1) or (i)(2)(A).
- (3) Congress may commission studies on turnout patterns but may not impose retroactive turnout requirements.
- (4) If turnout falls below 25 percent of voting-eligible population, the Independent Election Commission shall include in its certification a notation of low turnout and a recommendation for civic engagement measures.

(dd) **Referendum Administration.**

- (1) National referendums under subsection (d)(1) shall be administered by Regions pursuant to Article VII, Section 1.
- (2) DLRS referendums shall be scheduled to coincide with regularly scheduled federal elections to minimize costs and maximize turnout. A standalone referendum date may be designated by the Independent Election Commission only upon certification that no federal election will occur within the ratification window.
- (3) The federal government shall reimburse Regions for the reasonable costs of DLRS referendum administration within 90 days of certification. Referendum administration costs are mandatory spending not subject to annual discretionary appropriation. If Congress fails to appropriate funds within 90 days, the obligation is enforceable under Article XXI, Section 2-A.
- (4) Referendum administration costs shall be appropriated from general revenues and may not be charged against DLRS-specific funding.

(ee) **Ballot Language.**

- (1) The Independent Election Commission shall prepare official ballot language for each DLRS referendum.
- (2) Ballot language shall be neutral in tone and framing, presenting the DLRS without advocacy for or against, and shall:
    - (i) summarize the DLRS in plain language not exceeding 150 words;
    - (ii) accurately describe the floor standards being established;
    - (iii) note that higher regional or state standards are permitted;
    - (iv) identify the floor domain addressed.
- (3) Proposed ballot language shall be published for 30-day public comment before finalization.
- (4) Legal challenges to ballot language accuracy or neutrality must be filed within 30 days of finalization and resolved within 30 days.
- (5) Ballot language shall be available in all languages required for federal elections in each Region.

(ff) **Referendum Campaign Finance.**

- (1) Campaign finance disclosure requirements applicable to federal elections apply to DLRS referendum campaigns.
- (2) Foreign nationals and foreign governments may not contribute to or spend on DLRS referendum campaigns.
- (3) The Independent Election Commission shall maintain a public database of referendum campaign contributions and expenditures exceeding $10,000.
- (4) Nothing in this Section limits individual speech about DLRS proposals.
- (5) Coordination between referendum campaigns and foreign actors is prohibited and subject to penalties under federal election law.

#### Enforcement and Coordination

(gg) **Enforcement Authority.**

- (1) Rights floors established pursuant to this Section are self-executing and enforceable in all federal and Regional courts.
- (2) For all purposes of this Constitution, including but not limited to Article II, Section 3-A, rights floors established through the dual-consent process of this Section have the same constitutional status as rights established by constitutional amendment. Article II, Section 3-A(a)(iii) applies. Congressional enforcement of DLRS floor standards is not subject to the prerequisites of Article II, Section 3-A(c), provided the enforcement action is limited to the scope of the specific DLRS floor standard.
- (3) This provision does not expand congressional enforcement authority beyond the scope of the specific DLRS floor standard established through the dual-consent process.
- (4) The enforcement mechanisms established in the DLRS implementing statute (compliance certification, federal enforcement, enforcement escalation) operate as provided therein. Congress may not amend or repeal enforcement mechanisms of a DLRS implementing statute in a manner that diminishes the enforceability of floor standards without the dual-consent process of subsection (d).
- (5) Compliance with DLRS floor standards shall be assessed based on effective implementation, not merely formal legal conformity. A floor standard is not met if systemic resource deprivation, administrative obstruction, or practical inaccessibility renders the standard non-operative for a significant portion of the protected population.
- (6) Appropriations necessary for the administration and enforcement of DLRS, including the DLRS Registry, compliance certification, and enforcement escalation, are mandatory spending not subject to annual discretionary appropriation. Failure to appropriate funds for DLRS administration and enforcement constitutes obstruction of constitutional processes under Article XXI, Section 2-A.

(hh) **Relationship to Constitutional Minimums.**

- (1) DLRS floor standards supplement and do not replace the constitutional labor and safety minimums established in Article II, Section 4(h)-(k).
- (2) Where a DLRS floor standard and a constitutional minimum address the same subject matter, the higher standard governs. Where a DLRS floor standard and a constitutional minimum interact without directly conflicting, both shall be given full effect; neither shall be construed to narrow or condition the other.
- (3) DLRS authority in the labor rights domain (subsection (h)(4)) may not be construed to lower, narrow, or reclassify the constitutional minimums of Article II, Section 4(h)-(k), which are permanent and exempt from variance. DLRS may not define terms in a manner that narrows the scope of constitutional minimums.
- (4) A DLRS floor standard that exceeds a constitutional minimum of Article II, Section 4(h)-(k) is subject to the ratchet of subsection (i) with respect to the DLRS-established increment. The constitutional minimum itself remains governed by Article II, Section 4(k)(1) and is not affected by the DLRS ratchet.

(ii) **Definition of Lowering.**

- (1) For purposes of this Section, "lowering" includes any of the following relative to an existing DLRS floor standard:
    - (i) reduction in any numerical standard;
    - (ii) narrowing of the scope of protected persons, protected activities, or protected categories;
    - (iii) expansion of exemptions, exclusions, or exceptions;
    - (iv) contraction of coverage, including geographic, temporal, or subject-matter contraction;
    - (v) narrowing of definitions used in the floor standard;
    - (vi) reduction in available remedies or enforcement mechanisms;
    - (vii) any other change that, assessed by its practical effect, diminishes the protection afforded to individuals by the floor standard.
- (2) The determination of whether a change constitutes "lowering" shall be based on practical effect, not formal characterization.
- (3) A replacement DLRS under subsection (v)(2) that narrows any existing floor standard relative to the DLRS it supersedes is subject to the elevated dual-consent requirement of subsection (i)(2), not the standard dual-consent process.

(jj) **Severability.** If any subsection, paragraph, or provision of this Section is held invalid, the remaining provisions continue in full force and effect. Invalidity of a provision as applied to one Region or circumstance does not affect its validity in other Regions or circumstances.

## 6. Interaction with Existing Provisions

| Provision | Interaction |
|-----------|-------------|
| Art II §3-A (Rights Floor Enforcement) | Amended: new (a)(iii) explicitly recognizes DLRS-established rights as enumerated; subsection (gg)(2) provides belt-and-suspenders override |
| Art III §1 (Floors, Not Ceilings) | DLRS operationalizes this principle by providing a specific mechanism for establishing floors |
| Art III §2 (Subsidiarity) | DLRS respects subsidiarity — floors are minimums, Regions retain authority above floors |
| Art III §4 (Unwaivable Core) | Unwaivable Core protects against contractual waiver; DLRS protects against governmental lowering of standards; independent mechanisms |
| Art II §4(h)-(k) (Constitutional Labor Minimums) | Subsection (hh) clarifies DLRS supplements but cannot lower constitutional minimums; layered ratchet clarification |
| Art XXIII §11 (DLRS and Transition - Tribal) | Subsection (s)(3) harmonized with Art XXIII §11; uses same consent/revocation process; partial consent acknowledged |
| Art XIV (Judicial Reform) | Subsections (j), (m)(3) invoke mandatory jurisdiction and time-bound review |
| Art VII §1 (Elections) | Subsections (d)(1), (dd)(1) invoke IEC and election administration |
| Art XVII (Emergency Powers) | Subsection (m) prohibits DLRS suspension during emergencies |
| Art XIII (Constitutional Amendments) | Domain expansion requires constitutional amendment per subsection (h) |
| Art XXI §2-A (Implementation Act Integrity) | DLRS implementing statutes subject to anti-obstruction; mandatory appropriation cross-referenced in (gg)(6) and (dd)(3) |
| Art II §7 (Allocation Review Board) | ARB gains substantial similarity determination authority under (g); ceiling equivalency certification under (b)(3) |

## 7. Design Questions Resolved

| Question | Resolution |
|----------|------------|
| DQ-1 (Ratchet/Sunset) | Ratchet revised to two-tier: raise by standard dual consent, lower by elevated dual consent (60% + 3/4). Sunsets eliminated for substantive floors. Replacement DLRS cannot add sunset to carried-forward standards. Addresses all four sources: U's constraint options, ER's flexibility concern, R1/R2's gaming vector closure |
| DQ-2 (Enforcement Authority) | Belt-and-suspenders: Art II §3-A(a)(iii) added (R1 recommendation — cleanest fix) plus strengthened (gg)(2) with explicit constitutional-status language. Four-of-four sources agree the original (gg) was insufficient standing alone |
| DQ-3 (Domain Scope) | Five domains retained. All four sources agree: adding contentious domains would destabilize DLRS legitimacy. Expansion requires constitutional amendment — correct calibration |
| DQ-4 (IEC Role) | Substantial similarity moved to ARB (U/ER/R1/R2 agree). IEC retains: referendum admin, ballot language, registry, certification, campaign finance. ARB gets: similarity determinations with de novo judicial review (replacing abuse-of-discretion). Technical correction certification remains with IEC as administrative function |
| DQ-5 (Constitutional Minimums) | Subsection (hh) expanded with: (a) interaction without conflict clause, (b) anti-definitional-narrowing, (c) layered ratchet clarification for DLRS increment vs. constitutional minimum. Addresses R1 F-08 and U's anti-narrowing directive |
| DQ-6 (Turnout) | No minimum turnout threshold — boycott-to-block vector too dangerous. All four sources agree. Disclosure-only at 25%. Referendum timing requirement (coincide with general elections) structurally ensures reasonable turnout |
| DQ-7 (Cooling-Off) | R1's approach adopted: "and" → "or" so any single similarity factor triggers; holistic totality-of-proposal test added; "same policy objective" clause per ER. Moved to ARB with de novo review |

### Items Not Adopted

| Source | Recommendation | Reason Not Adopted |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| R2 V-06 (Coordinated regional abstention) | Additional anti-coordination penalties | Absolute majority requirement in (l)(3) is sufficient; anti-coordination penalties difficult to enforce and risk chilling legitimate political coordination |
| R2 F-06 partial (pre-ratification full scope review) | Broader pre-ratification review beyond domain scope | Would undermine democratic process protection; domain-scope is the only category where unconstitutionality is "facial and indisputable" |
| R1 DQ-4 (structural independence for IEC similarity staff) | IEC personnel independence requirement | Moot — similarity function moved to ARB entirely |
