# Briefing: Gap 74 -- Regional Guard "Shadow Mobilization" via State Defense Forces

## Context

You are reviewing a proposed resolution for a gap in a Regional Federal Constitution that reorganizes the United States into ~6-8 Regions between federal and state levels. The constitutional text lives in `02-design/constitution/` (numbered article files). Gap tracking lives in `04-meta/gaps/` (thematic files + master index).

**Key files for this gap:**

- `02-design/single-topic/military-civilian-control.md` — Standalone Military Civilian Control Amendment (Art XI), including Art XI §13 (SDF Limitations) and §14 (Congressional Key Override)
- `02-design/constitution/10-armed-forces.md` — Art XI-RF (Regional Federal supplement to Art XI), including §3(h) Subnational Force Registry, §4 Monopoly on Force, §5 Autonomous Systems, §6 Inter-Regional Military Confederations, §6-A Law Enforcement Command Exclusivity, §7 Cyber Operations
- `04-meta/gaps/09-emergency-military.md` — Gap 74 entry with full proposal

**Gap severity:** Critical
**Gap status:** Proposal Available

## The Problem

Article XI-RF distinguishes between the Regional Guard (subject to Two-Key authorization) and State Defense Forces (exclusive State Governor control). SDFs are prohibited from "independent combat roles," but this definition is poorly specified in a cyber/hybrid warfare context. The gap enables States to build paramilitary proxies that circumvent the Two-Key safeguard.

**Four gaming vectors identified:**

1. **"Disaster Response" Build-Up** — State massively funds SDF labeled as disaster response; personnel trained in combat; equipment includes armored vehicles; force available for instant conversion to combat role.

2. **"Cyber Militia" Loophole** — State creates "Cyber Defense Force" as SDF; offensive cyber capabilities not clearly "combat"; force can disable critical infrastructure in other States/Regions.

3. **"Coordinated State Action"** — Multiple States within a Region coordinate SDF build-ups; each State force is "small"; combined force is army-sized; Regional Governor coordinates without invoking Two-Key Rule.

4. **"Equipment Stockpile"** — SDF limited in personnel, but State stockpiles weapons/vehicles/equipment "for emergency use"; in crisis, equipment distributed to "volunteers"; instant paramilitary force without formal SDF.

## Why This Is Worse in This System

In the current US system, the Governor controls both the National Guard (which can be federalized) and any State Defense Force. The federal government can federalize the Guard as a check on state military power.

In the Regional Federal system:
- The Two-Key Rule means domestic deployment requires *both* federal and Regional/State authorization — a critical safeguard against tyranny
- SDFs sit outside the Two-Key framework entirely — Governor-only control
- Regions create a new coordination layer: a Regional Governor could orchestrate multiple State SDFs into a de facto army without triggering Two-Key
- The stakes are higher because the constitution creates genuine Regional autonomy, making Regional defection (backed by SDF force) a realistic scenario

## The Original Proposal (Four Parts, 13 Subsections)

The gap entry proposes a State Defense Force Limitation Framework targeting Art XI-RF §4(a-m). The full proposal:

**Part 1 — Scale and Capability Caps (proposed §4(a-d)):**
- (a) Personnel Cap: 0.5% of population or 10,000, whichever smaller
- (b) Prohibited Capabilities: heavy weapons, armored vehicles, combat aircraft, offensive cyber, CBRN
- (c) Permitted Capabilities: personal firearms, defensive equipment, transport, comms, defensive cyber
- (d) Equipment Stockpile Prohibition: no "emergency reserves," surplus transfers prohibited

**Part 2 — Automatic Reclassification (proposed §4(e-g)):**
- (e) Automatic Reclassification Trigger: exceeds cap by >10%, possesses prohibited capabilities, engages in combat, coordinates >5,000 combined personnel
- (f) Consequences of Reclassification: subject to Two-Key, State loses unilateral command, federalization authorized, personal liability
- (g) ARB Reclassification Authority: petition by federal government/Region/State, 30-day expedited review, effective immediately pending judicial review

**Part 3 — Cyber and Hybrid Warfare Clarification (proposed §4(h-j)):**
- (h) Combat Role Definition: armed confrontation, offensive cyber, info warfare supporting kinetic objectives, "act of war" test
- (i) Hybrid Warfare Prohibition: no psyops against other States/federal, no troll farms/disinformation, no support to non-state actors
- (j) Defensive Cyber Clarification: monitoring, protection, incident response only; no "active defense" counter-attacks

**Part 4 — Coordination and Transparency (proposed §4(k-m)):**
- (k) Multi-State Coordination Limits: no joint exercises >1,000 without ARB notification, no unified command, no intelligence sharing, no coordination through Regional channels
- (l) Annual Reporting: personnel, equipment, training, budget to ARB
- (m) Public Registry: status, reports, violation history

## Overlap Analysis Results (CRITICAL — READ CAREFULLY)

**This is the most important section of the briefing.** The original proposal was drafted before the standalone Military Civilian Control Amendment (Art XI §13) was fully developed. Subsequent gap resolutions (192, 214, 179, 113, 102) have filled in most of the territory this proposal originally targeted.

### Coverage Table

| Proposal Element | Existing Coverage | Location | Overlap % |
|---|---|---|---|
| §4(a) Personnel Cap: 0.5%/10,000 | **Identical.** "One-half of one percent (0.5%) of the State's population; or ten thousand personnel, whichever is smaller; personnel includes all full-time, part-time, and volunteer members, and autonomous system equivalents" | Art XI §13(a)(1)-(3) | 100% |
| §4(b) Prohibited Capabilities: heavy weapons, armored vehicles, combat aircraft, offensive cyber, CBRN | **Identical plus one.** Same five categories plus "autonomous lethal systems as defined in Article XI-RF, Section 5(a)" | Art XI §13(b)(1)-(6) | 100% |
| §4(c) Permitted Capabilities: firearms, defensive equipment, transport, comms, defensive cyber | **Not replicated as positive list.** Art XI §13 defines only prohibitions, not permitted capabilities. However, anything not prohibited is implicitly permitted. The only potentially additive element is the defensive cyber positive definition. | — | 80% |
| §4(d) Equipment Stockpile Prohibition | **Partially covered.** Art XI §13(b) prohibits SDFs from "possessing or operating" prohibited capabilities. Art XI-RF §5(e) has a constructive control doctrine for autonomous systems (funding, commandeering, directing = possession). But NO equivalent constructive possession doctrine for conventional weapons (e.g., State-owned warehouse of rifles not formally assigned to SDF). Art XI-RF §6(c) prohibits inter-Regional equipment pre-positioning. | Art XI §13(b), Art XI-RF §5(e), §6(c) | 50% |
| §4(e) Automatic Reclassification Trigger | **Identical.** "Any State Defense Force that exceeds the personnel cap by more than ten percent (including autonomous system equivalents), possesses prohibited capabilities (including autonomous lethal systems), or engages in independent combat roles is automatically reclassified as a National Guard unit subject to federalization." | Art XI §13(d) | 95% |
| §4(f) Consequences of Reclassification (Two-Key, loss of command, federalization, personal liability) | **Mostly covered.** Reclassification as National Guard unit subject to federalization = Two-Key + loss of unilateral command. BUT: personal liability for SDF cap/capability violations is NOT in §13(d). Personal liability exists for autonomous systems (§5(h)(4)) and military confederations (§6(j)(2)) but not for plain SDF violations. | Art XI §13(d), Art XI-RF §5(h)(4), §6(j)(2) | 75% |
| §4(g) ARB Reclassification Authority (petition, 30-day review, immediate effect) | **Not covered for SDFs specifically.** Art XI §13(d) triggers automatic reclassification but doesn't provide a petition mechanism for the federal government, Regions, or States to initiate ARB review. Art XI-RF §6(j)(4) provides this for inter-Regional confederations but not for plain SDF violations. Art XI-RF §3(h) provides DoD registry/inspection but no formal reclassification petition path. | — | 20% |
| §4(h) Combat Role Definition | **Identical.** Same four-part definition: armed confrontation, offensive cyber, info warfare supporting kinetic objectives, "act of war" test. | Art XI §13(c)(1)-(4) | 100% |
| §4(i) Hybrid Warfare Prohibition: psyops, troll farms, disinformation, non-state actor support | **Partially covered.** Art XI §13(c)(3) covers "information warfare operations designed to support kinetic military objectives." BUT: a State SDF running troll farms or disinformation campaigns to influence elections or destabilize another State — without any kinetic military connection — falls OUTSIDE §13(c)(3). The "designed to support kinetic military objectives" qualifier creates a gap for pure information warfare. Art XI-RF §7 (Cyber Operations) deals with government cyber operations generally but through a Two-Key framework, not SDF-specific prohibitions. | Art XI §13(c)(3), Art XI-RF §7 | 40% |
| §4(j) Defensive Cyber Clarification | **Partially covered.** Art XI-RF §7(b)(4) has a "Defensive Operations Carve-Out" for emergency cyber operations that are "purely defensive — limited to blocking incoming attacks against federal networks and critical infrastructure." But this is a Two-Key exemption, not a positive definition of what SDFs may do. No provision specifically defines the scope of permitted SDF defensive cyber. | Art XI-RF §7(b)(4) | 30% |
| §4(k) Multi-State Coordination Limits | **Nearly identical.** "State Defense Forces from different States may not conduct joint exercises exceeding one thousand combined personnel without federal notification, establish unified command structures, or coordinate operations that would constitute de facto military force." | Art XI §13(e) | 95% |
| §4(l) Annual Reporting to ARB | **Covered by DoD, not ARB.** Art XI-RF §3(h) requires DoD to maintain a comprehensive registry, conduct annual inspections, report to Congress/Regional Governor/Constitutional Court, and certify compliance. The proposal says "ARB"; existing text says "DoD." Functionally similar but different institution. | Art XI-RF §3(h) | 85% |
| §4(m) Public Registry | **Covered.** Art XI-RF §3(h) registry. Art XI-RF §6(h) compact registration. | Art XI-RF §3(h), §6(h) | 90% |

### Overall Overlap: ~90-95%

### Genuinely Additive Elements (~5-10%)

**Element 1: Constructive Possession for Conventional Weapons**
Art XI §13(b) prohibits SDFs from "possessing or operating" prohibited capabilities. Art XI-RF §5(e) extends this with a constructive control doctrine — but only for autonomous systems. There is NO equivalent doctrine for conventional weapons. A State could maintain a warehouse of rifles, armored vehicles, or heavy weapons that are state-property (not SDF-assigned) and claim the SDF doesn't "possess" them. In a crisis, the Governor transfers them to the SDF or distributes to "volunteers."

**Element 2: Non-Kinetic Information Warfare Prohibition**
Art XI §13(c)(3) covers "information warfare operations designed to support kinetic military objectives." A State SDF running troll farms, coordinated inauthentic behavior campaigns, or disinformation networks to destabilize another State or influence federal elections — without any kinetic military connection — falls outside this definition. The "designed to support kinetic military objectives" qualifier is the gap.

**Element 3: Personal Liability for SDF Cap/Capability Violations**
Art XI §13(d) provides automatic reclassification but does NOT impose personal liability on officials who authorized the violations. Personal liability exists for:
- Autonomous systems violations: Art XI-RF §5(h)(4)
- Military confederation violations: Art XI-RF §6(j)(2)
- PMC violations: Art XI-RF §4(h)(2)
But NOT for plain SDF cap or capability violations under Art XI §13.

**Element 4: ARB/Region/State Petition Authority for Reclassification**
Art XI §13(d) is self-executing ("automatically reclassified") but provides no mechanism for a petitioner to formally trigger review when a State contests the finding. Art XI-RF §6(j)(4) provides this for confederations ("Any non-participating Region, the Attorney General, or the Department of Defense may petition the Constitutional Court for a declaration that a compact violates this Section"). No equivalent for SDF violations.

**Element 5: SDF Defensive Cyber Positive Definition**
Art XI §13(b)(4) prohibits "offensive cyber capabilities designed to disrupt, damage, or destroy systems." Art XI-RF §7(b)(4) exempts "purely defensive" cyber operations from Two-Key. But no provision positively defines what SDFs *may* do in cyber space. The gap proposal's §4(j) lists: monitoring State networks, protecting State critical infrastructure, incident response/recovery, and explicitly excludes "active defense" counter-attacks.

---

## Placement Verification

**Original proposal target:** Art XI-RF §4(a-m)

**Why this is wrong:** Art XI-RF §4 is "Monopoly on Force" — a complete 8-subsection provision (§4(a)-(h)) covering PMC prohibition, UCMJ extension, foreign operations, Regional PMC prohibition, transparency, and enforcement. All subsection letters (a)-(h) are occupied.

**Corrected placement options (for reviewer evaluation):**

- **Option A: Art XI §13(f)-(j)** in `single-topic/military-civilian-control.md` — Extends the standalone SDF Limitations section (currently §13(a)-(e)) with the additive elements. Pro: keeps all SDF rules in one place. Con: the standalone amendment is supposed to work without the RF supplement.

- **Option B: Art XI-RF §9** in `10-armed-forces.md` — New section in the RF supplement after §8 (Defense Mutual Aid and Cost-Sharing). Pro: keeps RF-specific elaboration in the RF file. Con: splits SDF rules across two files.

**Note on section numbering in 10-armed-forces.md:** After the current §8, the next available section number is §9. (There is no existing §9 in this file.)

## Proposed Narrowed Resolution (~3-4 Subsections)

Given the ~90-95% overlap, the resolution should contain ONLY the genuinely additive elements. Proposed draft (placement TBD per design question D1):

> **(f) Constructive Possession of Military Equipment.** The prohibitions of Section 13(b) extend to any weapons, vehicles, equipment, or materiel subject to the effective control or direction of a State government, regardless of whether such items are formally assigned to a State Defense Force:
>
> (1) State-owned or State-funded weapons, vehicles, equipment, or materiel stored, maintained, or stockpiled for potential distribution to State Defense Force personnel, volunteers, or any other persons are treated as possessed by the State Defense Force for purposes of this Section;
>
> (2) Federal military surplus transfers to State governments shall not include items that would be prohibited under Section 13(b) if possessed by a State Defense Force, unless the transferred items are assigned exclusively to federally supervised National Guard units;
>
> (3) This subsection incorporates and extends the constructive control principles of Article XI-RF, Section 5(e) to conventional weapons and military equipment.
>
> **(g) Non-Kinetic Information Warfare Prohibition.** State Defense Forces may not conduct, sponsor, or provide personnel for:
>
> (1) psychological operations, disinformation campaigns, or coordinated inauthentic behavior targeting other States, Regions, federal institutions, or the general public, regardless of whether such operations support kinetic military objectives;
>
> (2) troll farms, bot networks, or coordinated social media manipulation campaigns;
>
> (3) providing personnel, infrastructure, or technical support to non-state actors engaged in information warfare against United States entities.
>
> For purposes of this subsection, "information warfare" includes operations conducted through digital means, traditional media, or any combination thereof, designed to manipulate public opinion, undermine institutional legitimacy, or destabilize governance. This subsection does not restrict the individual speech rights of SDF members acting in their personal capacity.
>
> **(h) Personal Liability and Petition Authority.**
>
> (1) Any State official who knowingly authorizes, directs, or permits a State Defense Force to exceed the personnel cap of Section 13(a), possess prohibited capabilities under Section 13(b), or engage in independent combat roles under Section 13(c) is personally liable and subject to removal from office and prosecution under federal law;
>
> (2) The federal government, any Region, any State, or the Department of Defense may petition the Constitutional Court for a declaration that a State Defense Force has triggered automatic reclassification under Section 13(d). The Court shall conduct an expedited review within thirty (30) days. A reclassification finding is effective immediately pending further judicial review;
>
> (3) During the pendency of a reclassification petition, the State Defense Force shall be subject to federal inspection and monitoring. Refusal to submit to inspection constitutes prima facie evidence of violation.
>
> **(i) Defensive Cyber Scope.** Permitted "defensive cyber capabilities" for State Defense Forces under Section 13 are limited to:
>
> (1) monitoring State government networks for intrusions;
>
> (2) protecting State critical infrastructure from cyber attack;
>
> (3) incident response and recovery operations; and
>
> (4) cooperation with federal agencies on cyber defense coordination.
>
> Defensive cyber capabilities may not include "active defense" operations involving counter-attacks, offensive intrusion into external networks, or any operation that would constitute a "cyber operation with domestic effect" under Article XI-RF, Section 7(a)(1).

## Gaming Vectors to Verify Against (Post-Overlap)

These are second-order attacks against the *narrowed* resolution, assuming existing Art XI §13(a)-(e) and Art XI-RF §§3(h), 4(d), 5, 6 remain in force:

1. **"Not Our Equipment" Shell Game** — State creates a nominally independent "Emergency Preparedness Authority" that owns the weapons stockpile. The Authority is not a State Defense Force and is not formally a State agency. Does §13(f)(1) "subject to the effective control or direction of a State government" capture this? What about a private foundation funded by State tax breaks?

2. **"Research Institution" Cyber Capability** — State university's "Cybersecurity Research Center" develops offensive cyber tools. SDF personnel are also adjunct researchers. The center is not the SDF but SDF personnel have access. Does §13(g) reach this?

3. **"Personal Capacity" Speech Loophole** — §13(g) carves out "individual speech rights of SDF members acting in their personal capacity." Could a State organize SDF members into a "private" coordinated inauthentic behavior campaign, with each member technically acting "in their personal capacity"?

4. **Slow-Walk Reclassification** — §13(h)(2) gives the Constitutional Court 30 days for expedited review. What happens if the Court is overloaded or the State stalls? Is the SDF free to continue operating during the petition? (§13(h)(3) provides inspection/monitoring but not suspension.)

5. **"Defensive" Counter-Attack Mission Creep** — §13(i)(3) prohibits "active defense" counter-attacks. But what about "threat hunting" on external networks that is technically defensive intelligence but involves persistent access to non-State networks?

6. **Federal Surplus Laundering** — §13(f)(2) prohibits surplus transfers to States for SDF-prohibited items. But what if the federal government transfers to a State's National Guard, the Governor then "decommissions" from the Guard and "redeploys" to a State agency, which then supplies the SDF?

7. **Volunteer Force End-Run** — Art XI §13(a) caps SDF personnel. But what about a State "Volunteer Emergency Corps" that is technically not the SDF, receives no SDF training, but gets mobilized alongside the SDF in a crisis? Does Art XI-RF §4(d) Functional Classification catch this? (It catches forces with military equipment/structures but maybe not unarmed volunteers used for logistics support.)

8. **Information Warfare via Contractors** — §13(g) prohibits SDF from conducting information warfare. But a State hires a private PR firm or data analytics company to run influence campaigns. The firm has no SDF affiliation. Does §13(g) reach State-funded but non-SDF information warfare?

9. **Cross-State Defensive Cyber "Cooperation"** — Multiple State SDFs share "defensive" threat intelligence that, aggregated, constitutes offensive intelligence capability. Each State is individually "defensive" but the collective creates an intelligence fusion center. Does Art XI §13(e) multi-state coordination limit + §13(i) defensive cyber scope address this?

10. **Reclassification as Leverage** — A politically hostile federal government files reclassification petitions against State SDFs in opposition states, not because they've violated §13 but to harass and force inspection/monitoring during the 30-day review. What prevents weaponized petitions?

## Design Questions

**D1: Placement — Standalone Art XI §13(f)-(j) vs. RF Supplement Art XI-RF §9?**

- Option A: Art XI §13(f)-(j) in `military-civilian-control.md`. Keeps all SDF rules in one section. The standalone amendment already has §13(a)-(e) covering SDF limitations. But the standalone amendment is supposed to function without the RF supplement — does adding constructive possession (which cross-references §5(e)) violate that principle?
- Option B: Art XI-RF §9 in `10-armed-forces.md`. Keeps RF-specific elaboration in the RF file. The additive elements cross-reference existing RF provisions (§5(e), §7(a)(1)) which only exist in the RF supplement. This is more architecturally correct. But splits SDF rules across two files.
- Option C: Split — put personal liability and petition authority in §13(f)-(g) (standalone, no RF cross-references needed) and put constructive possession, info warfare, defensive cyber in Art XI-RF §9 (these need RF cross-references).

**D2: Constructive Possession Scope — How far should "effective control or direction" reach?**

- Option A: State government only. Covers State-owned, State-funded, State-stored equipment. Simple and defensible.
- Option B: State government plus entities receiving >50% State funding. Catches quasi-governmental entities but may create compliance burden for legitimate disaster relief organizations.
- Option C: Functional test — any entity whose equipment a State official could legally or practically direct, commandeer, or distribute to SDF personnel within 72 hours. Catches shell entities but harder to enforce.

**D3: Non-Kinetic Information Warfare — Scope of the SDF-specific prohibition?**

- Option A: SDF-only prohibition. The proposed §13(g) only prohibits SDF from conducting information warfare. A State's civilian agencies could still run influence campaigns. This is narrower but defensible — SDFs are the military concern.
- Option B: Extend to any State-funded information warfare using SDF-trained personnel, regardless of which agency employs them. Catches the "SDF members moonlighting" vector.
- Option C: Extend to all State-government-directed information warfare. This is broader than SDF-specific but may conflict with state speech rights and commercial activity.

**D4: Personal Liability — Should it extend to negligent oversight or only knowing violations?**

- Option A: "Knowingly authorizes, directs, or permits" — requires knowledge. Catches intentional violators. Officials who genuinely didn't know are exempt.
- Option B: "Knowingly or recklessly" — adds recklessness. A Governor who appoints an SDF commander known for extremist views and then ignores reports of stockpiling would be liable.
- Option C: Strict liability for exceeding numerical caps (these are objective), knowledge standard for capability/combat violations (these involve judgment calls).

**D5: Petition Authority — Should there be a threshold to prevent weaponized petitions?**

- Option A: Any petitioner (federal government, Region, State, DoD) may petition without threshold. Simple, maximizes access. Risk: harassment through frivolous petitions.
- Option B: Require prima facie evidence standard — petitioner must present initial evidence of violation. Reduces harassment but adds procedural burden.
- Option C: Prima facie evidence + loser-pays costs if petition is found frivolous. Strongest deterrent against weaponization.

**D6: Defensive Cyber — Should "threat hunting" on external networks be explicitly addressed?**

- Option A: Silence — let the "active defense" prohibition cover it by implication. Simpler text.
- Option B: Explicitly prohibit "persistent access to networks not owned or operated by the State" as part of the "active defense" exclusion.
- Option C: Allow threat hunting on external networks only with federal authorization (CISA coordination requirement).

**D7: Federal Surplus Transfers — How to prevent laundering through National Guard?**

- Option A: Prohibit surplus transfers to States for SDF-prohibited items (as proposed). Relies on existing Art XI-RF §3(h) inspections to catch laundering.
- Option B: Require that surplus items transferred to State National Guard units are tracked in the DoD registry and may not be transferred to any other State entity without DoD approval.
- Option C: Omit this provision — the constructive possession doctrine + existing inspection regime is sufficient.

---

## Verification Questions

1. **Cross-reference accuracy:** Does Art XI §13(d) actually say "automatically reclassified as a National Guard unit subject to federalization"? Or does it use different terminology? (This matters for whether the petition authority in §13(h)(2) uses the right trigger language.)

2. **Scope question:** Does Art XI-RF §4(d) Functional Classification (which catches any force "regardless of its designation") already close the "Volunteer Emergency Corps" vector in Gaming Vector 7? Specifically, subsection (d)(3) catches forces "organized in military-style command and control structures" — but what about forces that are NOT military-organized but ARE mobilized alongside the SDF?

3. **Institutional jurisdiction:** The original proposal assigns reporting/registry to the ARB. The existing regime (Art XI-RF §3(h)) assigns this to the Department of Defense. Which institution should the petition authority in §13(h)(2) route through — the Constitutional Court (as proposed), the ARB, or the DoD? Does the ARB have jurisdiction over military force classification?

4. **Cyber scope interaction:** Does Art XI-RF §7(a)(1)'s definition of "cyber operation with domestic effect" — "any government-directed action using digital means that monitors, intercepts, filters, blocks, degrades, disrupts, or otherwise affects the communications, data, or digital activity of persons" — already cover SDF information warfare? If a State SDF runs a troll farm, is that a "government-directed action using digital means that affects the digital activity of persons"?

## Related Resolved Gaps

- **Gap 192 (Paramilitary Loophole / Shadow Army):** Resolved as Art XI-RF §3(g)-(h). Created the Subnational Force Registry with DoD annual inspections and proactive detection. The resolution note says it "ensures the cap-and-reclassify framework in Art XI §13(d) has proactive detection rather than relying on reactive discovery."

- **Gap 214 (Autonomous Weapons Loophole):** Resolved as Art XI-RF §5(a)-(h). Created autonomous systems prohibition, force equivalence counting, constructive control doctrine (§5(e)), and personal liability (§5(h)(4)).

- **Gap 179 (Shadow Confederation):** Resolved as Art XI-RF §6(a)-(k). Prohibited inter-Regional unified command, limited mutual aid, banned equipment pre-positioning, established functional classification test (§6(d)), banned intelligence compacts, created petition authority for confederations (§6(j)(4)).

- **Gap 113 (Emergency Pincer via Law Enforcement):** Resolved as Art XI-RF §6-A. Prevents Two-Key circumvention through mass deputization of State/local police.

- **Gap 102 (Emergency Loophole for Information Warfare):** Resolved as Art XI-RF §7. Extends Two-Key to cyber operations, defines "cyber operation with domestic effect," creates defensive operations carve-out, limits proxy designations.

- **Gap 235 (Privatized War / PMC Prohibition):** Resolved as Art XI-RF §4(a)-(h). Monopoly on Force — PMC prohibition, limited contractor authorization, UCMJ extension, foreign operations restriction.

## Your Task

Please review the proposed narrowed resolution above and provide:

1. **Findings** — Verify the overlap analysis. Identify conflicts with existing provisions cited above. Identify gaming vectors not addressed. Flag ambiguous or undefined terms. Assess whether the five "genuinely additive elements" are truly additive or already covered.

2. **Open Questions / Assumptions** — Questions that need design decisions before integration. Address the seven design questions (D1-D7) with your recommendation and rationale.

**Severity levels:**
- **High** — Contradicts existing constitutional text or creates a new critical vulnerability
- **Medium** — Ambiguous, undefined, or potentially conflicting; needs clarification
- **Low** — Minor gaming risk or style issue
