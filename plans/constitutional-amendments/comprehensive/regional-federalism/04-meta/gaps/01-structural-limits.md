# Category I: Unsolvable Structural Limits

> These gaps represent fundamental constraints that no constitutional design can eliminate. They exist because constitutions operate within human societies, not above them.

---

### Gap 1 — Civic Culture and Democratic Norms

**Description:**
The system cannot manufacture democratic commitment, truthfulness, or nonviolence.

**Risk:**
If a large portion of the population:

- rejects electoral legitimacy entirely,
- embraces political violence,
- or abandons constitutional loyalty,

no institutional design can fully compensate.

**Status:**
Unavoidable. Managed only through time-buying and visibility, not prevention.

**Severity:** High | **Mitigability:** Low

### Gap 2 — Total Breakdown of Shared Reality

**Description:**
The system does not centrally regulate:

- epistemic authority,
- truth arbitration,
- or belief formation.

**Risk:**
Information collapse can delegitimize institutions faster than law can respond.

**Status:**
Deliberately under-constrained to avoid censorship and authoritarian drift.

Foreign information operations are addressed through disclosure requirements ([Article XVI, Section 7](../../02-design/constitution/00-index.md)), but domestic speech and belief formation remain intentionally unregulated. See [Foreign Information Warfare Stress Test](../../03-analysis/06-foreign-information-warfare.md) for related analysis.

**Severity:** High | **Mitigability:** Low
