# Briefing: Gap 123 — "Automatic Fiscal Continuation" as Hostage Tool

## 1. The Problem

**Gap 123** identifies a structural vulnerability in the Automatic Continuing Resolution (Article X, Section 19). The constitution prohibits government shutdowns by automatically continuing prior-year appropriations at 98% (declining monthly). However, a hostile congressional majority can weaponize this very mechanism by *refusing to appropriate* during changed circumstances — locking spending at obsolete levels while maintaining the appearance of government function.

### The Attack Vectors

| Vector | Mechanism | Effect |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Crisis Freeze** | Emergency requires dramatically increased spending; Congress refuses to act | Prior-year continuation locks funding at pre-crisis levels; §19(e) prohibits new programs or expansions during continuation |
| **Inflation Erosion** | Non-essential functions get 98% of nominal prior year, declining monthly | During high inflation (5-10%), real purchasing power erodes rapidly without any affirmative vote to cut |
| **New Administration Strangle** | Outgoing party retains House; refuses to fund new President's priorities | New administration locked to predecessor's spending priorities indefinitely |
| **Compounding Decay** | Monthly 98% recalculation under §19(c) | After 12 months: ~78% of original; after 24 months: ~61% — slow-motion starvation |

### Why Existing Protections Are Insufficient

| Protection | What It Covers | What It Misses |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|
| Art X §19(a) (shutdown prohibition) | Prevents cessation of operations | Continuation at obsolete levels is not a "shutdown" |
| Art X §19(d) (essential functions protection) | CPI-adjusted full funding for enumerated functions | Non-enumerated functions degrade; emergency needs not covered; list is finite and gameable |
| Art X §19(e) (no new programs) | Prevents expansion during continuation | Also prevents emergency response scaling — the vulnerability |
| Art X §19(j)-(o) (disbursement timelines) | Prevents executive delay of already-appropriated funds | Addresses executive obstruction, not legislative hostage-taking |
| IFC (general fiscal oversight) | Monitoring and reporting | No adjustment authority over appropriation levels |

### Key Interaction: §19(d) vs. Non-Essential Functions

The existing essential functions list in §19(d) already provides CPI-adjusted full funding for: border security, interstate commerce regulation, federal courts, elections, equalization payments, and debt service. These are inflation-protected. The vulnerability is:

1. **Non-essential functions** — everything not on the §19(d) list gets 98% declining without inflation adjustment
2. **Emergency scaling** — even essential functions are locked at *prior-year levels*, which may be inadequate during a crisis requiring dramatically increased spending
3. **List gaming** — Congress controls the essential functions list (2/3 vote to add; constitutional amendment to remove), creating a long-term capture risk

## 2. Existing Coverage Analysis

### What Exists

- **Art X §19(a)-(c)**: Core ACR mechanism — 98% declining monthly for non-essential; full CPI for essential
- **Art X §19(d)**: Essential functions enumeration with CPI adjustment
- **Art X §19(e)**: No new programs during continuation (creates the vulnerability)
- **Art X §19(j)-(o)**: Comprehensive anti-delay framework for disbursement (resolves Gap 112)
- **Art X §19(i)**: Unauthorized military operations exclusion
- **IFC general authority**: Monitoring, reporting, fiscal analysis — no adjustment authority

### What Does Not Exist

- No authority to adjust continuation levels upward during genuine emergencies
- No inflation indexing for non-essential function continuation
- No mechanism to distinguish "Congress hasn't acted yet" from "Congress is intentionally weaponizing inaction"
- No hard floor below which non-essential functions cannot fall through pure non-appropriation
- No override mechanism when continuation levels become inadequate due to changed circumstances

## 3. Related Gaps

| Gap | Relationship |
|-----|-------------|
| **86** (Fiscal Starvation of ARB/Councils) | Resolved — oversight body budget protection; Gap 123 addresses broader fiscal weaponization |
| **112** (Budgetary Midnight / Disbursement Delay) | Resolved — executive delay via §19(j)-(o); Gap 123 addresses legislative hostage-taking |
| **94** (Emergency Debt Issuance) | Resolved — debt-ceiling crisis; Gap 123 addresses appropriation freeze |
| **170** (Government Shutdown) | Resolved — §19 core mechanism; Gap 123 addresses weaponization of that mechanism |

---

## 4. Proposed Approach: Emergency Fiscal Adjustment Authority

Three new subsections — **Art X §19(p)-(r)** — amending the existing Automatic Continuing Resolution to close the hostage-taking vulnerability while preserving the core incentive structure.

### Design Principles

1. **Preserve the incentive**: The 98% declining haircut is by design — it creates pressure to appropriate. The fix must not eliminate this incentive during normal budget disputes.
2. **Distinguish crisis from dispute**: Normal partisan disagreement over spending levels is democracy working. Crisis freeze during genuine emergencies is weaponization. The trigger must be objective.
3. **Independent body, democratic override**: The IFC provides politically independent judgment; Congress retains ultimate authority via override.
4. **Inflation protection as baseline**: Non-essential functions should not erode in real terms through the passive mechanism of inaction.
5. **No backdoor expansion**: Emergency adjustment is temporary and narrow — it cannot be used to permanently increase spending or create new programs.

## 5. Proposed Constitutional Text

### Art X §19(p)-(r). Emergency Fiscal Adjustment Authority

*Resolves Gap 123 — "Automatic Fiscal Continuation" as Hostage Tool. These subsections prevent weaponization of the Automatic Continuing Resolution by providing limited emergency adjustment authority, inflation protection for continuation amounts, and a hard floor for essential government functions.*

(p) **Emergency Fiscal Adjustments.** During any period of automatic appropriation under this Section:

- (1) If the President declares a National Emergency under Article XVII, or if concurrent Regional emergencies have been declared in three (3) or more Regions, the Independent Fiscal Council may certify that automatic continuation levels are inadequate at the federal level to address the emergency. The IFC certification shall assess fiscal inadequacy based on federal appropriation needs, not merely on the existence of emergency declarations;
- (2) Upon certification by supermajority vote (five (5) of seven (7) members), the IFC may authorize Emergency Fiscal Adjustments increasing automatic continuation levels by up to twenty percent (20%) for specific appropriation categories directly related to the certified emergency. The IFC shall publish written findings identifying: (A) the specific appropriation categories requiring adjustment; (B) the factual basis for inadequacy of continuation levels; (C) the amount of each adjustment and its relationship to emergency needs;
- (3) Emergency Fiscal Adjustments take effect immediately upon certification and expire upon the earlier of: (A) termination of the emergency declaration; (B) enactment of regular appropriations for the affected categories; or (C) one hundred eighty (180) days, unless renewed by the IFC under the same supermajority and findings requirements;
- (4) Congress may override any Emergency Fiscal Adjustment by joint resolution enacted within thirty (30) days of the IFC certification. Congressional override authority under this paragraph is unconditional and not subject to judicial review as to its reasoning. If Congress overrides during an active emergency declaration, it shall within forty-five (45) days either: (A) enact appropriations for the affected categories; or (B) adopt a Fiscal Continuity Resolution explaining why continuation levels are adequate notwithstanding the certified emergency. Failure to take either action within forty-five (45) days restores the IFC's authority to reissue an Emergency Fiscal Adjustment on the same factual basis;
- (5) Emergency Fiscal Adjustments may not be used to fund new programs or agencies not authorized prior to the emergency. Adjustments shall be limited to increasing funding levels for existing programs whose prior-year appropriations are demonstrably insufficient to meet emergency demands;
- (6) The IFC shall report to Congress monthly on all active Emergency Fiscal Adjustments, including expenditure data and continued necessity analysis. If the IFC determines that continuation levels have become adequate — whether through changed circumstances, partial appropriation, or emergency abatement — it shall terminate the adjustment without waiting for the 180-day expiration;
- (7) Nothing in this subsection authorizes the IFC to reduce automatic continuation levels below those established by subsections (b) through (d). The IFC's authority under this subsection is limited to upward adjustment during certified emergencies;
- (8) Emergency Fiscal Adjustment funds certified by the IFC under this subsection are subject to the mandatory disbursement timelines and anti-delay protections of subsections (j) through (o). Executive impoundment or delay of IFC-certified emergency funds constitutes a disbursement violation under subsection (j).

(q) **Inflation Indexing for Continuation.** Automatic continuation amounts under subsection (b):

- (1) Shall be calculated using the prior fiscal year's appropriation adjusted by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or by a successor index designated by statute. The ninety-eight percent (98%) haircut of subsection (b) shall be applied to the inflation-adjusted amount, not the nominal prior-year amount. The inflation adjustment preserves the real-value incentive of the ninety-eight percent (98%) haircut while preventing nominal-value erosion from functioning as a de facto spending reduction absent any affirmative legislative decision;
- (2) If annual CPI-U exceeds five percent (5%), the IFC shall publish an assessment of real purchasing power erosion for each major appropriation category and transmit it to Congress within thirty (30) days of CPI-U publication;
- (3) Congress may appropriate below inflation-adjusted continuation levels only by affirmative vote of both chambers. Failure to appropriate does not constitute affirmative authorization to reduce spending in real terms;
- (4) This subsection does not affect the CPI-U adjustment for essential functions under subsection (d), which continues to apply at the full prior-year level without the ninety-eight percent (98%) haircut.

(r) **Appropriation Floor for Government Functions.**

- (1) No department or agency of the federal government shall receive automatic continuation funding below seventy-five percent (75%) of its inflation-adjusted prior-year appropriation, regardless of the duration of the automatic appropriation period. When the compounding reduction under subsection (c) would cause any department or agency's funding to fall below this floor, continuation funding shall be maintained at the floor level. This floor constrains only the automatic continuation mechanism and does not reduce pressure on Congress to enact regular appropriations at adequate levels;
- (2) Constitutional Oversight Bodies — including the Independent Fiscal Council, the Allocation Review Board, the National Election Court, the Judicial Conduct Council, the Inspector General system, and the Independent Electoral Commission — shall be treated as essential functions under subsection (d) for purposes of automatic appropriation, regardless of whether Congress has added them to the essential functions list. This designation is self-executing and may not be overridden by statute;
- (3) If automatic appropriation continues for more than twelve (12) consecutive months, the IFC shall certify to Congress a Fiscal Adequacy Assessment identifying: (A) any government function operating below adequate levels due to continuation; (B) specific risks to public safety, constitutional governance, or treaty obligations; (C) recommended appropriation levels for each affected function. Congress shall hold hearings on the Assessment within thirty (30) days of certification;
- (4) The floor established by paragraph (1) may be reduced below seventy-five percent (75%) only by a two-thirds vote of both chambers accompanied by specific findings that the reduction is necessary for fiscal responsibility and will not impair constitutionally mandated functions;
- (5) Nothing in this subsection limits Congress's authority to appropriate at any level through regular legislation. This subsection constrains only the automatic continuation mechanism, not affirmative appropriations decisions.

## 6. Design Questions for Reviewers

1. **Emergency adjustment cap**: Is 20% the right ceiling for IFC emergency adjustment authority? Should it be lower (15%) to limit IFC power, or higher (25-30%) to ensure adequacy during severe crises?

2. **Congressional override period**: Is 30 days appropriate for Congress to override an emergency adjustment? The gap proposal suggested 14 days — is that too short for deliberation, or is 30 days too long given the political dynamics?

3. **IFC composition risk**: The IFC is given significant new power. Is the 5-of-7 supermajority sufficient safeguard, or should the threshold be higher (e.g., unanimous)?

4. **Floor level**: Is 75% the right floor for the compounding decline? The gap proposal suggested 80% for "essential functions" specifically. Should the floor be different for different categories?

5. **Inflation indexing interaction**: The current §19(b) haircut is designed as an incentive to appropriate. Does applying CPI before the 98% haircut undermine this incentive, or merely prevent the unintended inflation erosion attack?

6. **Constitutional Oversight Bodies protection**: Should the self-executing essential function designation for oversight bodies (§19(r)(2)) extend to other categories, or is the enumerated list appropriately narrow?

7. **180-day renewal**: Is 180 days the right expiration for emergency adjustments, or should it be shorter (90 days) to maintain pressure?

## 7. Interaction with Existing Provisions

| New Provision | Interacts With | Relationship |
|---|---|---|
| §19(p) Emergency Adjustment | Art XVII Emergency Powers | Triggered by same emergency declarations |
| §19(p)(4) Congressional Override | Art X §19(h) Termination | Parallel mechanism — override terminates adjustment as enactment terminates continuation |
| §19(p)(5) No New Programs | Art X §19(e) No New Programs | Reinforces existing constraint within emergency adjustment context |
| §19(q) Inflation Indexing | Art X §19(d) Essential Functions CPI | Extends CPI protection to non-essential functions (with 98% haircut) |
| §19(q)(4) Essential Functions Carve-Out | Art X §19(d) Essential Functions | Preserves existing full CPI protection for essential functions |
| §19(r)(1) Appropriation Floor | Art X §19(c) Monthly Continuation | Limits compounding decline to 75% floor |
| §19(r)(2) Oversight Bodies | Art X §19(d) Essential Functions List | Constitutionally embeds oversight body protection beyond legislative control |
| §19(r)(3) Fiscal Adequacy Assessment | Art X §19(j)-(o) Disbursement Framework | Supplements disbursement enforcement with adequacy monitoring |
| §19(p)(4) Fiscal Continuity Resolution | Art X §19(h) Termination | Forces Congress to either appropriate or explain after override during emergency |
| §19(p)(8) Emergency Disbursement | Art X §19(j)-(o) Disbursement Framework | Extends mandatory disbursement protections to IFC-certified emergency funds |
| §19(r)(4) Supermajority Waiver | Art X §19(d) Amendment Requirement | Parallel pattern — 2/3 to modify essential list; 2/3 to breach floor |

## 8. Review Findings Incorporated

Two independent reviews were conducted. All findings have been incorporated into the revised text in Section 5 above.

### Finding Summary

| ID | Severity | Finding | Resolution |
|----|----------|---------|------------|
| F1 | HIGH | IFC emergency adjustment authority risks shifting the power of the purse from Congress; override language must be unconditional | Strengthened §19(p)(4): override is unconditional and not subject to judicial review as to reasoning. Added Fiscal Continuity Resolution requirement so Congress must either appropriate or explain after override |
| F2 | MEDIUM | Inflation indexing and 75% floor could reduce pressure to appropriate; incentive preservation must be explicit | Added explicit incentive-preservation language to §19(q)(1); added clarification to §19(r)(1) that floor constrains only automatic continuation mechanism |
| F3 | MEDIUM | "Override-Blockade" — Congress could override emergency adjustment during crisis and then take no further action, leaving agencies with inadequate continuation funding | Added §19(p)(4) Fiscal Continuity Resolution: Congress must within 45 days either enact appropriations or adopt findings; failure restores IFC reissuance authority |
| F4 | MEDIUM | Executive could impound IFC-certified emergency funds, rendering emergency adjustment meaningless | Added §19(p)(8): emergency funds are subject to §19(j)-(o) disbursement protections; impoundment constitutes a disbursement violation |
| F5 | LOW | Regional emergency declarations could be manufactured to trigger IFC certification | Strengthened §19(p)(1): IFC must certify fiscal inadequacy "at the federal level" based on "federal appropriation needs, not merely on the existence of emergency declarations" |
| F6 | LOW | Oversight bodies list in §19(r)(2) could expand through judicial interpretation | No change needed — enumerated list is already closed; "including" is followed by exhaustive list; R2 confirms scope is appropriately narrow |

### Design Questions Resolved

| Question | Resolution |
|----------|------------|
| 1. Emergency adjustment cap | 20% — both reviewers agree sufficient; higher cap risks IFC as shadow budget authority |
| 2. Congressional override period | 30 days — R2 prevails; allows time for deliberation and alternative appropriation. Supplemented with 45-day Fiscal Continuity Resolution requirement |
| 3. IFC supermajority | 5-of-7 — both agree sufficient safeguard given unconditional congressional override |
| 4. Floor level | 75% uniform — both agree appropriate. Clarified as automatic-continuation-only constraint |
| 5. Inflation indexing interaction | CPI before haircut preserves real-value incentive while preventing unintended nominal erosion. Explicit incentive-preservation language added |
| 6. Oversight bodies protection | Enumerated list is appropriately narrow — both agree. No expansion needed |
| 7. 180-day renewal | 180 days — R2 prevails; monthly necessity findings already provide accountability; 90 days creates perpetual re-certification burden without additional value |
