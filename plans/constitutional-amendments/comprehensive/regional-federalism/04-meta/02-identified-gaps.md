## Purpose

This document catalog known **gaps**—areas where:

- constitutional structure cannot fully guarantee outcomes,
- risk is reduced but not eliminated,
- or design intentionally stops short to avoid greater harm.

These gaps are:

- explicitly acknowledged,
- bounded where possible,
- and preferable to the silent assumptions of most constitutions.

---

## Summary: Why These Gaps Do Not Invalidate the System

These gaps:

- are known rather than hidden,
- are bounded rather than ignored,
- reflect human limits rather than design errors.

Most constitutional failures arise from **unacknowledged assumptions**, not explicit tradeoffs.

This system is credible because it:

- names its limits,
- resists magical thinking,
- and focuses on survivability rather than perfection.

> **A constitution does not need to be gapless.
> It needs to fail honestly, slowly, and visibly.**

That is what this system is designed to do.
