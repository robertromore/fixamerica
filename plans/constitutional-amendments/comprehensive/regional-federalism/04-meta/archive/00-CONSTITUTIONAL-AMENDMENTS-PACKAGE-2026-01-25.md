## PREAMBLE TO AMENDMENTS

These amendments establish a Regional Federalism framework designed to preserve democratic governance, prevent authoritarian consolidation, ensure fiscal sustainability, and protect the constitutional order against both overt and covert erosion.

The design philosophy rests on seven core axioms:

1. **Axiom 1 (Assume Bad Faith):** Constitutional structures must function even when occupied by actors seeking to subvert them.
2. **Axiom 2 (Distribute Power):** No single actor or level should control sufficient levers to fundamentally alter the system.
3. **Axiom 3 (Automatic Triggers):** Critical protections activate automatically without requiring discretionary action.
4. **Axiom 4 (Sunset and Review):** Extraordinary powers expire by default.
5. **Axiom 5 (Remove Ambiguity):** Provisions must be specific enough to prevent interpretive manipulation.
6. **Axiom 6 (One Bite Then Automatic):** After one violation, automatic enforcement replaces discretionary enforcement.
7. **Axiom 7 (Law Moves Faster):** Constitutional mechanisms must outpace bad-faith actors.

# ARTICLE I-RF: REGIONAL STRUCTURE AND INTERSTATE RELATIONS

## Section 6. Right of Transit and Non-Blockade

### Part A. Emergency Shutdown Review (Subsections d-f)

**(d) Expedited Federal Review.** Any Regional emergency declaration that results in closure of inter-Regional transit corridors, energy transmission lines, or pipeline infrastructure for more than seventy-two (72) hours:

- (i) Triggers mandatory expedited review by the federal Department of Transportation (for transit), Department of Energy (for energy), or relevant agency;
- (ii) The reviewing agency and the ARB shall jointly assess necessity within forty-eight (48) hours of trigger;
- (iii) The declaring Region bears the burden of proving "Safety Necessity" by clear and convincing evidence.

**(e) Safety Necessity Standard.** "Safety Necessity" requires demonstration that:

- (i) A specific, identified safety hazard exists;
- (ii) Continued operation poses imminent risk of serious injury, death, or catastrophic infrastructure failure;
- (iii) The scope and duration of closure is no greater than necessary to address the hazard;
- (iv) Alternative measures (reduced capacity, speed restrictions, enhanced monitoring) are inadequate.

**(f) Presumption Against Extended Closure.** Closures exceeding seven (7) days are presumptively unreasonable:

- (i) The declaring Region must demonstrate extraordinary circumstances justifying extended closure;
- (ii) The reviewing agency may impose conditions, partial reopening requirements, or alternative routing obligations;
- (iii) Failure to comply with agency conditions constitutes violation of Article I-RF, Section 6.

### Part B. Anti-Cumulative Obstruction (Subsections g-i)

**(g) Cumulative Impact Assessment.** The ARB shall monitor cumulative infrastructure disruptions:

- (i) If total disruption (closures, slowdowns, capacity reductions) exceeds thirty (30) days within any twelve-month period, the ARB shall initiate review;
- (ii) The declaring Region must justify cumulative impact, not merely each individual action;
- (iii) Pattern of disruptions during periods of inter-Regional dispute creates rebuttable presumption of bad faith.

**(h) Rolling Maintenance Limits.** Scheduled maintenance that cumulatively reduces inter-Regional infrastructure capacity:

- (i) May not exceed 20% average capacity reduction over any thirty-day period without ARB approval;
- (ii) Must be coordinated with affected Regions at least ninety (90) days in advance;
- (iii) May not be concentrated during periods of peak demand or known inter-Regional disputes.

**(i) Inspection and Processing Standards.** Processing times for cargo, vehicles, or energy flows crossing Regional boundaries:

- (i) May not exceed historical averages by more than 50% without documented cause;
- (ii) Systematic delays create rebuttable presumption of unreasonable conditioning;
- (iii) The IFC shall publish quarterly inter-Regional transit time data for transparency.

### Part C. Rate Regulation for Critical Infrastructure (Subsections j-l)

**(j) Rate Reasonableness.** Charges for inter-Regional infrastructure access shall be:

- (i) Based on actual cost of provision plus reasonable return;
- (ii) Non-discriminatory between in-Region and out-of-Region users;
- (iii) Subject to IFC review upon complaint by any affected Region or user.

**(k) Rate Manipulation Presumption.** Rate increases exceeding 25% within any twelve-month period:

- (i) Create rebuttable presumption of unreasonable conditioning;
- (ii) Require cost-based justification to the IFC;
- (iii) May be enjoined pending IFC review.

**(l) Emergency Rate Freeze.** During declared inter-Regional disputes:

- (i) Infrastructure rates are frozen at pre-dispute levels;
- (ii) Rate increases require ARB approval;
- (iii) Retroactive rate adjustments prohibited.

### Part D. Remedies and Escalation (Subsections m-p)

**(m) Compensatory Damages.** Regions or parties injured by unreasonable infrastructure conditioning may recover:

- (i) Actual economic damages;
- (ii) Consequential damages for supply chain disruption;
- (iii) Reasonable costs of alternative routing or supply.

**(n) Injunctive Relief.** The ARB or National Constitutional Court may order:

- (i) Immediate reopening of unreasonably closed infrastructure;
- (ii) Capacity restoration for cumulative obstruction;
- (iii) Rate rollback for manipulation.

**(o) Federal Operation Authority.** If a Region refuses to comply with reopening orders:

- (i) The federal government may assume temporary operational control of affected infrastructure;
- (ii) Federal operation continues until the Region demonstrates compliance;
- (iii) Costs of federal operation are charged to the non-compliant Region.

**(p) Repeat Offender Designation.** Regions found to have engaged in unreasonable infrastructure conditioning three (3) or more times within ten (10) years:

- (i) Lose unilateral authority over inter-Regional infrastructure;
- (ii) All future maintenance, closures, and rate changes require ARB pre-approval;
- (iii) Designation continues for ten (10) years or until the Region demonstrates reformed practices.

### Part E. National Infrastructure Transparency System (Subsections q-t)

**(q) National Infrastructure Transparency System.** The Department of Transportation, in coordination with the Department of Energy, the Independent Fiscal Council, and the ARB, shall maintain a publicly accessible National Infrastructure Transparency System (NITS) containing:

- (i) Real-time operational status of all inter-Regional transit corridors, energy transmission lines, and pipeline infrastructure;
- (ii) All emergency declarations, maintenance schedules, and capacity restrictions affecting inter-Regional infrastructure;
- (iii) Complete technical justifications for any closure, restriction, or capacity reduction;
- (iv) Historical data on infrastructure availability, maintenance frequency, and processing times by corridor and Region.

**(r) Mandatory Real-Time Disclosure.** When a Region declares an emergency shutdown, initiates maintenance, or imposes capacity restrictions on inter-Regional infrastructure:

- (i) The Region shall upload complete technical justification to NITS within four (4) hours;
- (ii) Justification must include specific hazard identification, engineering assessments, and estimated duration;
- (iii) Supporting data (inspection reports, sensor readings, engineering analyses) must be made publicly available;
- (iv) Updates shall be filed every twenty-four (24) hours during ongoing closures.

**(s) No Classified Infrastructure Justifications.** Regions may not invoke national security, proprietary information, or any confidentiality doctrine to withhold infrastructure closure justifications:

- (i) All safety and maintenance justifications are inherently public information;
- (ii) If a closure involves genuinely classified federal security matters, only the federal government (not the Region) may invoke classification, and must assume operational responsibility for the closure;
- (iii) Regional invocation of "classified" justification creates irrebuttable presumption of bad faith and triggers immediate federal review.

**(t) Public Accountability Metrics.** NITS shall publish monthly:

- (i) "Infrastructure Reliability Scores" for each Region based on closure frequency, duration, and justification adequacy;
- (ii) Comparison of stated maintenance needs to industry benchmarks;
- (iii) Economic impact estimates of closures on affected Regions;
- (iv) Identification of patterns suggesting strategic rather than safety-motivated closures.

### Part F. Cost-Plus Fee Regulation (Subsections u-w)

    - (C) Reasonable administrative overhead not exceeding 10% of direct costs;
- (ii) The IFC shall establish uniform accounting standards for transit fee cost calculation;
- (iii) Regions shall submit annual audited cost reports to the IFC.

**(v) Prohibited Cost Inclusions.** The following may not be included in fee calculations:

- (i) General Regional government expenses unrelated to infrastructure;
- (ii) "Climate adaptation" or "resilience" costs beyond those directly improving the specific infrastructure;
- (iii) Reserves exceeding two (2) years of projected maintenance costs;
- (iv) Debt service for bonds issued for non-infrastructure purposes.

**(w) Ancillary Fee Aggregation.** For purposes of the cost-plus ceiling:

- (i) All fees, charges, and assessments related to transit shall be aggregated;
- (ii) The aggregate may not exceed the 110% cost-plus ceiling;
- (iii) Fee multiplication through separate charges for related services is prohibited.

### Part G. Anti-Retaliation and Whistleblower Protection (Subsections x-z)

**(x) Non-Retaliation.** Regions may not:

- (i) Increase fees in response to fee challenges by specific users;
- (ii) Impose selective enforcement of ancillary requirements against challengers;
- (iii) Delay processing of challengers' transit relative to non-challengers;
- (iv) Impose new requirements targeting entities that filed ARB complaints.

## Section 9. Mutual Recognition of Credentials

### Part A. Rebuttable Presumption of Competency (Subsections d-f)

**(d) Presumption of Competency.** A credential validly issued by any Region creates a rebuttable presumption of competency to practice in all Regions:

- (i) The receiving Region bears the burden of demonstrating that supplementary requirements are necessary;
- (ii) "Demonstrably exceed" is replaced with "Essential for Public Safety";
- (iii) Convenience, preference, or economic protection do not constitute public safety necessity.

**(e) Essential for Public Safety Standard.** A supplementary requirement is "Essential for Public Safety" only if:

- (i) It addresses a specific, documented risk to public health, safety, or welfare;
- (ii) The risk is unique to the receiving Region and not adequately addressed by the issuing Region's standards;
- (iii) The requirement is narrowly tailored to address only that specific risk;
- (iv) Less restrictive alternatives are inadequate.

**(f) Prohibited Justifications.** The following do not constitute public safety necessity:

- (i) General assertions that Regional standards are "higher" or "more rigorous";
- (ii) Economic impact on existing Regional practitioners;
- (iii) Differences in educational institution accreditation;
- (iv) Requirements for Region-specific knowledge not directly related to professional competency.

### Part B. ARB Pre-Approval for Supplementary Requirements (Subsections g-i)

**(g) ARB Certification Required.** Before imposing any supplementary credential requirement on out-of-Region professionals, a Region must:

- (i) Submit the proposed requirement to the Allocation Review Board;
- (ii) Demonstrate that the requirement meets the "Essential for Public Safety" standard;
- (iii) Receive ARB certification within ninety (90) days.

**(h) Automatic Recognition.** If the ARB fails to rule within ninety (90) days:

- (i) The supplementary requirement is deemed not certified;
- (ii) The out-of-Region credential must be recognized without supplement;
- (iii) The Region may resubmit with additional justification.

**(i) Grandfathering.** Supplementary requirements in effect at ratification:

- (i) Remain valid for two (2) years;
- (ii) Must be submitted for ARB certification within one (1) year;
- (iii) Uncertified requirements become void after the two-year transition period.

### Part C. Anti-Protectionism Provisions (Subsections j-l)

**(j) Facially Neutral Discrimination.** A credential requirement that is facially neutral but has disparate impact on out-of-Region professionals:

- (i) Is subject to strict scrutiny;
- (ii) Must be justified by compelling public safety interest;
- (iii) Creates rebuttable presumption of protectionist intent if adopted within twenty-four (24) months of significant credential migration.

**(k) Prohibited Practices.** Regions may not:

- (i) Require continuing education obtainable only within the Region;
- (ii) Impose "cultural competency" or "regional knowledge" requirements beyond those directly necessary for professional practice;
- (iii) Condition reciprocity on political, economic, or policy concessions;
- (iv) Revoke reciprocity for reasons unrelated to credential standards.

**(l) Expedited Judicial Review.** Professionals denied credential recognition may:

- (i) Appeal directly to the National Constitutional Court;
- (ii) Receive expedited ruling within sixty (60) days;
- (iii) Practice under provisional recognition pending appeal if they demonstrate valid out-of-Region credential.

**(h) Technical Obstruction as Violation.** Providing data in deliberately unusable formats, imposing unreasonable technical requirements, or maintaining "legacy systems" that prevent interoperability without documented modernization plans:

- (i) Constitutes constructive denial;
- (ii) Is subject to the same penalties as outright refusal;
- (iii) Creates rebuttable presumption of bad faith if the obstructing level has opposed the requesting level's exercise of constitutional authority.

### Part C. Data Access Hierarchy (Subsections u-w)

**(u) Specialized Data Access Provisions.** Nothing in this section limits:

- (i) Rights enforcement data supremacy under Article II-RF, Section 1;
- (ii) Forensic audit authority under Article X-RF, Section 3;
- (iii) Algorithmic transparency requirements under Article VII-RF, Section 3;
- (iv) Transition data requirements under the Transition Framework.

---

## Section 4. Regional Equivalence Exemptions

**(a) Equivalence Petition.** A Region may petition the Allocation Review Board for an "Equivalence Exemption" from a specific National Floor. The Board shall grant the exemption if the Region demonstrates, by clear and convincing evidence, that its alternative policy achieves the same or superior outcome as intended by the National Floor while better suiting regional economic, geographic, or demographic conditions.

**(b) Outcome Metrics.** For each National Floor, Congress shall specify measurable outcome metrics by which equivalence may be assessed. If Congress fails to specify metrics, the Allocation Review Board shall determine appropriate metrics based on the stated legislative purpose.

**(c) Provisional Compliance.** Pending Allocation Review Board determination on an Equivalence Petition:

---

## Section 5. Allocation Review Board

### Part A. Composition (Subsection b)

**(b) Allocation Review Board Composition.**

(1) The Board shall consist of nine members appointed as follows:

# ARTICLE III-RF: RIGHTS AND MOBILITY PROTECTIONS

## Section 3. Credential and Labor Mobility

### Part A. Default Recognition (Subsections f-h)

**(f) Credential Mutual Recognition.**

(1) **Default Recognition.** A professional credential issued by any Region shall be valid in all Regions for the same scope of practice, unless the destination Region has filed a valid "Divergence Declaration" with the Allocation Review Board.

(2) **Self-Executing Effect.** A worker holding a valid credential from any Region may present that credential and immediately commence work in any other Region. The burden is on the destination Region to demonstrate a valid Divergence Declaration; absent such demonstration, the credential shall be honored.

(3) **Divergence Declaration Requirements.** A Divergence Declaration must:

- (a) Identify the specific credential and the specific Regional variation required;
- (b) Document, with empirical evidence, a safety rationale tied to conditions unique to that Region (geography, climate, population density, infrastructure);
- (c) Be approved by the Regional legislature by majority vote (not administrative agency alone);
- (d) Include a "bridge pathway" allowing out-of-region credential holders to achieve equivalence within 60 days and $500 maximum cost.

(4) **Sunset and Renewal.** Each Divergence Declaration expires after five years and must be renewed through the same legislative process with updated empirical justification.

(5) **Prohibition on Cumulative Barriers.** A Region may not impose multiple sequential Divergence Declarations on related occupations to achieve cumulative delays exceeding 90 days total.

**(g) Regulatory Neutrality in Labor Markets.**

(1) A Regional regulation affecting cross-regional labor mobility shall be presumptively invalid if it increases the cost or time of market entry by more than 20% compared to the National Median for the same occupation.

(2) **Calculation of National Median.** The Allocation Review Board shall calculate and publish:

- (a) The National Median cost and time of entry for the 100 occupations with highest cross-regional mobility, updated annually by January 31;
- (b) The National Floor (lowest cost/time among all Regions) for occupations designated as "Critical Shortage" by the Department of Labor.

(3) **Critical Shortage Standard.** For Critical Shortage occupations, the relevant benchmark shall be the National Floor, not the National Median. If a Regional requirement exceeds the National Floor by more than 20%, the requirement is automatically decertified and Default Mutual Recognition applies.

**(h) Prohibition on Coordinated Regulatory Barriers.**

(1) If three or more Regions adopt materially identical regulatory requirements affecting the same occupation within any 24-month period, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that the requirements constitute a coordinated regulatory barrier.

(2) Upon a finding of coordinated barrier:

- (a) Each Region must independently justify its requirement without reference to other Regions' adoption;
- (b) "Other Regions have the same requirement" shall not constitute valid justification;
- (c) The Allocation Review Board may impose enhanced scrutiny on future regulatory proposals from participating Regions.

---

## Section 6. Boundary Adjustment Framework

### Part A. State Transfer Mechanism (Subsections a-d)

**(a) Tiered Transfer Approval.** A State may transfer from one Region to another pursuant to the following procedures:

| Transfer Type | Threshold | Requirements |
|---------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Bilateral Agreement** | Supermajority (2/3) of both Regional legislatures + State referendum (55%) | Consent from all affected parties |
| **Unilateral Departure** | State referendum (60%) + ARB certification + 5-year waiting period | Higher bar for non-consensual departure |
| **Contested Transfer** | Supreme Court determination | Prevents hostage-taking by blocking Region |

**(b) Fundamental Misalignment Standard.** The ARB shall certify "Fundamental Misalignment" if, for three consecutive years:

- (i) The State's primary economic trading partners are greater than sixty percent (60%) outside its current Region; OR
- (ii) The State's labor market integration (cross-border commuting, migration) is greater than fifty percent (50%) with an adjacent Region; OR
- (iii) The State's policy preferences (as measured by statewide referendum results) diverge from the Regional median by more than two (2) standard deviations on three or more major policy domains.

**(c) Waiting Period.** A State initiating Unilateral Departure shall complete a five (5) year waiting period during which:

- (i) The State remains subject to all origin-Region obligations;
- (ii) The ARB shall verify continued Fundamental Misalignment at Year 3;

**(d) Policy Continuity Rule.** A transferring State shall remain subject to its former Region's regulatory and tax floors for a period of five (5) years following transfer, with floors declining by twenty percent (20%) annually toward the new Region's standards.

### Part B. Anti-Region-Shopping Provisions (Subsections e-g)

**(e) Anti-Arbitrage Certification.** No transfer shall be approved if the ARB determines that the primary purpose is to evade:

- (i) Environmental regulations applicable in the origin Region;
- (ii) Labor standards or minimum wage requirements;
- (iii) Tax obligations, including equalization contributions.

**(f) Burden of Proof.** Where the destination Region maintains lower floors in any domain enumerated in subsection (e), the transferring State bears the burden of demonstrating non-arbitrage purpose by clear and convincing evidence.

**(g) Regional Membership Permanence.** Once assigned, Regional membership is irrevocable until the next decennial review; selective coordination withdrawal does not exempt a State from Regional authority.

## Section 8. Remedial Supremacy Framework

### Part A. Remedial Supremacy Clause (Subsections a-c)

**(a) Remedial Supremacy.** Where a Region establishes a standard pursuant to its enumerated powers:

- (i) States may not enact civil, procedural, or remedial barriers that substantially frustrate the enforcement of that standard;
- (ii) Regional standards include an implied right of private enforcement unless the Region explicitly provides otherwise;
- (iii) State civil law applies to Regional standard enforcement only to the extent it does not conflict with Regional policy.

**(b) Substantial Frustration Standard.** A State law "substantially frustrates" Regional enforcement if it:

- (i) Eliminates or caps damages for violations of Regional standards below levels that deter violations;
- (ii) Creates procedural barriers that make enforcement impractical for typical claimants;
- (iii) Permits contractual waiver of Regional protections designated as "non-waivable" by Regional law;

### Part B. Provisional Truncation for RCV (Subsection e)

**(e) Provisional Truncation for RCV Tabulation.**

**(1) Mathematical Insufficiency Standard.** The National Certification Board may proceed with RCV elimination rounds if:

- (a) at least six (6) of seven (7) Regions have certified results (or placed results in Escrow with provisional inclusion); and
- (b) the outstanding ballots from non-certifying Region(s) are mathematically insufficient to change the current round's elimination result.

**(2) Calculation of Mathematical Insufficiency.** Outstanding ballots are "mathematically insufficient" when, even if all such ballots were allocated to the candidate currently facing elimination, that candidate would still have fewer votes than the next-lowest candidate.

### Part C. Preemptive Federal Election Jurisdiction (Subsections g-k)

**(g) Federal Jurisdiction Timeline.** In federal elections, if a Regional Court has not issued a final, non-appealable decision within seven (7) days of the election:

- (i) Jurisdiction automatically and exclusively transfers to the National Election Court;

- (iii) Creates priority schemes that systematically subordinate Regional tax collection to State collection;
- (iv) Offers location-based incentives designed to erode the Regional tax base within the State.

**(i) Rebuttable Presumption.** A State tax provision shall be presumed to violate subsection (h) if:

- (i) It was enacted within twenty-four (24) months of a Regional tax increase or new Regional tax;
- (ii) Its fiscal impact falls disproportionately (>75%) on Regional revenue rather than Federal or general State revenue;
- (iii) Legislative history or public statements by sponsors reference Regional tax policy.

**(j) Permitted State Tax Policy.** Nothing in this section shall prevent States from:

- (i) Establishing general tax credits, deductions, or exemptions that apply regardless of Regional tax status;

---

## Section 3. Equalization and Benefits

### Part A. National Benefits Spine Fiscal Alignment (Subsections 3-B)

**(3-B) National Benefits Spine Fiscal Alignment.**

(1) **Co-Payment Requirement.** For any program funded through the National Benefits Spine, the administering Region shall contribute a co-payment from Regional own-source revenue according to the following schedule:

- (a) Regions with fiscal capacity above 110% of national median: 20% co-payment;
- (b) Regions with fiscal capacity between 90-110% of national median: 15% co-payment;
- (c) Regions with fiscal capacity below 90% of national median: 10% co-payment;
- (d) Small Regions receiving equalization transfers under Section 3-A: 5% co-payment (minimum).

(2) **Effect on Incentives.** The co-payment requirement ensures that Regional governments bear marginal fiscal consequences for program expansion decisions, aligning authority over administration with responsibility for costs.

### Part B. Efficiency-Indexed Federal Contributions (Subsection 3-C)

**(3-C) Efficiency-Indexed Federal Contributions.**

(1) **Outcome-Based Funding.** The federal government shall provide National Benefits Spine funding sufficient to achieve specified outcome floors at the National Median cost-per-outcome, adjusted for Regional Purchasing Power Parity.

(2) **Purchasing Power Parity Adjustment.** The Independent Fiscal Council shall annually calculate a Regional Cost Index reflecting differences in labor costs, real estate costs, and input prices across Regions. All efficiency comparisons shall use PPP-adjusted figures.

(3) **Funding Adjustment Based on Efficiency.**

- (a) **Efficient Regions:** If a Region achieves outcome floors at below-median PPP-adjusted cost, the Region retains 50% of the savings as unrestricted Regional revenue;
- (b) **Inefficient Regions:** If a Region exceeds median PPP-adjusted cost while achieving outcome floors, federal funding covers only the median cost; the Region must fund the excess from own-source revenue;
- (c) **Underperforming Regions:** If a Region fails to achieve outcome floors regardless of spending, the Region enters Performance Improvement Status.

### Part C. Subsidy-Neutrality Adjustment (Subsections g-n)

**(g) Subsidy-Neutrality Adjustment.** Equalization formulas shall account for Regional tax expenditures:

- (i) Explicitly conditioned on relocation from another Region;
- (ii) Available only to firms relocating from specific other Regions;
- (iii) Structured to match or exceed subsidies offered by other Regions in bidding wars.

**(l) Relocation Subsidy Definition.** A subsidy is "conditioned on relocation" if:

- (i) The subsidy agreement references the firm's current location;
- (ii) The subsidy is available only to firms not currently operating in the Region;

---

## Section 6. Administrative Receivership

**(a) Trigger Conditions.** If a Region's own-source revenue falls below forty percent (40%) of its total expenditures for three consecutive fiscal years, the Independent Fiscal Council shall declare that Region to be in a state of Administrative Receivership.

**(b) Receivership Powers.** During Administrative Receivership, the Independent Fiscal Council shall have authority to:

- (1) conduct comprehensive audits of Regional finances, including all revenue sources, expenditures, and obligations;
- (2) require the Region to submit quarterly fiscal reports in a form prescribed by the Council;

- (1) reduce, condition, or otherwise affect the Region's representation in the Senate or any other legislative body;
- (2) reduce, condition, or otherwise affect the voting rights of the Region's citizens in federal elections;
- (3) assume direct control of Regional government operations beyond fiscal matters;
- (4) mandate specific spending cuts to particular programs (the Region retains discretion over expenditure priorities within approved budget levels); or
- (5) impose receivership for reasons other than the objective fiscal trigger in subsection (a).

**(d) Exit from Receivership.** Administrative Receivership terminates automatically when the Region's own-source revenue exceeds fifty percent (50%) of its total expenditures for two consecutive fiscal years.

**(e) Democratic Representation Preserved.** For the avoidance of doubt, a Region in Administrative Receivership retains full and equal representation in the Senate, full participation in all constitutional processes, and all rights of self-governance except as specifically limited by this section. Fiscal dependency shall never be grounds for reducing a Region's democratic voice in the Union.

- (2) 90 days pass without the Federal Supreme Court granting certiorari; or
- (3) the Federal Supreme Court affirms the Regional interpretation.

**(b) Expanded Trigger.** For purposes of this Section, a ruling "effectively exempts" if it:

- (1) interprets the scope, applicability, or meaning of a Federal Floor or Framework;
- (2) makes a factual finding that a Federal Floor does not apply to specific conditions, actors, or geographic areas;
- (3) determines that local circumstances render a Federal Floor's specific metrics inapplicable; or
- (4) has the practical effect of suspending Federal Floor enforcement for a class of actors, regardless of doctrinal label.

**(c) Automatic Certiorari for Circuit Splits.** If two or more Regional courts have issued conflicting rulings on the same Federal Floor or Framework provision, the Federal Supreme Court shall grant certiorari within 30 days of the second conflicting ruling.

- (i) affirm the stay pending full litigation;
- (ii) vacate the stay and require immediate enforcement; or
- (iii) modify the stay with conditions.

(3) Failure to transmit a stay order within 48 hours renders the stay void.

### Part C. Anti-Reliance Rule (Subsections f-h)

**(f) Reliance Prohibited.** No party may claim vested rights, grandfather status, detrimental reliance, or equitable estoppel based on a Regional court interpretation of a Federal Floor or Framework if:

- (2) the interpretation conflicts with interpretations issued by other Regional courts;
- (3) a petition for Federal Supreme Court review is pending or has been filed; or
- (4) the Federal Supreme Court has granted certiorari.

**(g) Investment Risk Notice.** Permits, licenses, and authorizations issued during contested interpretation periods shall bear a "Contested Interpretation Notice" warning that:

**(h) Good Faith Requirement.** Congress shall negotiate Fiscal Equalization Acts in good faith:

- (i) Demands clearly outside constitutional parameters constitute bad faith;
