# Article I, Section 6 Integration Map

## Consolidated Infrastructure Authority Structure

**Purpose:** This document reconciles Gap proposals affecting Article I, Section 6 (Infrastructure Rights) and creates a unified National Infrastructure Transparency System.

**Date:** 2026-01-25
**Status:** Draft for Review

---

## Overview

Three gaps propose amendments to infrastructure authority with overlapping registry requirements:

| Gap | Topic | Proposed Subsections |
|-----|-------|---------------------|
| 67 | Infrastructure Ransom (closures, restrictions) | (d-f), (g-i), (j-l), (m-p), (q-t) |
| 75 | Fee Gouging (excessive transit charges) | (u-w), (x-z), (aa-cc) |
| 83 | Infrastructure Decay (passive neglect) | Article IX-RF, Section 8 (separate article) |

**Key Integration Issue:** Gaps 67 and 75 each propose separate registries:
- Gap 67: "National Infrastructure Status Registry" (subsection q-t)
- Gap 75: "National Infrastructure Fee Registry" (subsection bb-cc)

**Resolution:** Consolidate into unified "National Infrastructure Transparency System"

## Integrated Article I, Section 6 Structure

### Subsections (a-c): [Existing Content - Reserved]

---

### Subsections (d-l): Infrastructure Closure Review [Gap 67, Parts 1-3]

> **(d) Emergency Shutdown Expedited Review.** When any Region declares an emergency shutdown, initiates unscheduled maintenance, or imposes capacity restrictions on inter-Regional infrastructure:
>   - (i) The declaration shall automatically trigger an expedited review by the Allocation Review Board within seventy-two (72) hours;
>   - (ii) The declaring Region bears the burden of demonstrating genuine safety necessity by clear and convincing evidence;
>   - (iii) Failure to demonstrate necessity results in mandatory reopening within forty-eight (48) hours.

> **(e) Genuine Safety Necessity Standard.** To satisfy the "genuine safety necessity" requirement:
>   - (i) The Region must identify a specific, documented hazard;
>   - (ii) The closure must be proportionate to the hazard (full closure only if partial measures insufficient);
>   - (iii) The estimated repair timeline must be technically justified;
>   - (iv) Economic impact on affected Regions must be considered as a factor, though not dispositive.

> **(f) Prolonged Closure Presumption.** Any infrastructure closure or restriction exceeding seven (7) days creates a rebuttable presumption of unreasonableness:
>   - (i) The Region must file detailed justification with the ARB every seven (7) days;
>   - (ii) Each seven-day extension requires renewed demonstration of necessity;
>   - (iii) Failure to file creates automatic referral for federal operational assumption.

> **(g) Cumulative Obstruction Assessment.** The ARB shall assess patterns of infrastructure restriction:
>   - (i) Three (3) or more closures affecting the same corridor within twelve (12) months triggers cumulative review;
>   - (ii) "Rolling maintenance" schedules that cumulatively exceed thirty (30) days annually create presumption of strategic obstruction;
>   - (iii) Pattern finding shifts burden to Region for all future closures.

> **(h) Alternative Route Requirements.** During any closure or restriction:
>   - (i) The Region shall provide functional alternative routing at equivalent or lower cost;
>   - (ii) Increased costs for alternative routing borne by the closing Region;
>   - (iii) Failure to provide alternatives constitutes per se violation.

> **(i) Processing Time Standards.** For infrastructure subject to inspection, certification, or processing requirements:
>   - (i) Processing times shall not exceed national median for comparable facilities;
>   - (ii) Deviation exceeding 50% from median creates presumption of obstruction;
>   - (iii) ARB may mandate processing timeline improvements.

> **(j) Rate Regulation for Constrained Corridors.** Rates for transit through partially closed or capacity-restricted infrastructure:
>   - (i) Shall not exceed rates in effect prior to the restriction;
>   - (ii) No "scarcity premium" or "congestion pricing" permitted during capacity emergencies;
>   - (iii) Any rate increase during restriction period is void.

> **(k) Cost-Based Rate Requirement.** Infrastructure user fees shall be based solely on:
>   - (i) Documented maintenance and operational costs;
>   - (ii) Capital recovery for improvements directly benefiting users;
>   - (iii) Reasonable administrative overhead not exceeding 15% of direct costs.

> **(l) Rate Dispute Freeze.** When a fee is challenged:
>   - (i) The pre-dispute rate remains in effect until ARB resolution;
>   - (ii) No retroactive collection permitted for disputed amounts;
>   - (iii) Resolution within sixty (60) days required.

---

### Subsections (m-p): Remedies and Enforcement [Gap 67, Part 4]

> **(m) Full Damages for Unreasonable Restrictions.** When the ARB finds an infrastructure restriction was not supported by genuine safety necessity:
>   - (i) Affected Regions and private parties may recover full economic damages;
>   - (ii) Damages include direct losses, consequential damages, and litigation costs;
>   - (iii) No sovereign immunity defense available for infrastructure ransom.

> **(n) Treble Damages for Bad Faith.** When the ARB finds a restriction was imposed in bad faith—i.e., for purposes of economic coercion rather than safety:
>   - (i) Treble damages are mandatory;
>   - (ii) Regional officials responsible for the decision are personally liable;
>   - (iii) Pattern bad faith triggers federal operational assumption.

> **(o) Federal Operational Assumption.** When a Region refuses to comply with ARB order to reopen or de-restrict infrastructure:
>   - (i) Federal agencies may assume operational control;
>   - (ii) Federal operation continues until the Region demonstrates compliance;
>   - (iii) Costs of federal operation are charged to the non-compliant Region.

> **(p) Repeat Offender Designation.** Regions found to have engaged in unreasonable infrastructure conditioning three (3) or more times within ten (10) years:
>   - (i) Lose unilateral authority over inter-Regional infrastructure;
>   - (ii) All future maintenance, closures, and rate changes require ARB pre-approval;
>   - (iii) Designation continues for ten (10) years or until the Region demonstrates reformed practices.

### Subsections (q-w): National Infrastructure Transparency System [CONSOLIDATED - Gaps 67 + 75]

> **(q) National Infrastructure Transparency System Established.** The Department of Transportation, in coordination with the Department of Energy, the Independent Fiscal Council, and the Allocation Review Board, shall maintain a publicly accessible National Infrastructure Transparency System (NITS) containing:
>   - (i) Real-time operational status of all inter-Regional transit corridors, energy transmission lines, and pipeline infrastructure;
>   - (ii) All emergency declarations, maintenance schedules, and capacity restrictions affecting inter-Regional infrastructure;
>   - (iii) Complete technical justifications for any closure, restriction, or capacity reduction;
>   - (iv) Historical data on infrastructure availability, maintenance frequency, and processing times by corridor and Region;
>   - (v) All inter-Regional transit fee schedules with cost justification summaries;
>   - (vi) Fee challenge status, pending disputes, and resolution outcomes.

> **(r) Mandatory Real-Time Disclosure.** When a Region declares an emergency shutdown, initiates maintenance, imposes capacity restrictions, or changes fee schedules:
>   - (i) The Region shall upload complete technical or cost justification to NITS within four (4) hours for emergencies, thirty (30) days for fee changes;
>   - (ii) Justification must include specific hazard identification, engineering assessments, estimated duration, or audited cost documentation;
>   - (iii) Supporting data (inspection reports, sensor readings, engineering analyses, financial records) must be made publicly available;
>   - (iv) Updates shall be filed every twenty-four (24) hours during ongoing closures.

> **(s) No Classified Infrastructure Justifications.** Regions may not invoke national security, proprietary information, or any confidentiality doctrine to withhold infrastructure closure or fee justifications:
>   - (i) All safety, maintenance, and cost justifications are inherently public information;
>   - (ii) If a closure involves genuinely classified federal security matters, only the federal government (not the Region) may invoke classification, and must assume operational responsibility for the closure;
>   - (iii) Regional invocation of "classified" or "proprietary" justification creates irrebuttable presumption of bad faith and triggers immediate federal review.

> **(t) Public Accountability Metrics.** NITS shall publish monthly:
>   - (i) "Infrastructure Reliability Scores" for each Region based on closure frequency, duration, and justification adequacy;
>   - (ii) "Fee Reasonableness Scores" for each Region comparing fees to cost-plus standards;
>   - (iii) Comparison of stated maintenance needs to industry benchmarks;
>   - (iv) Economic impact estimates of closures and fees on affected Regions;
>   - (v) Identification of patterns suggesting strategic rather than safety-motivated closures;
>   - (vi) Historical fee trends and comparisons across Regions.

> **(u) Cost-Plus Fee Ceiling.** Inter-Regional transit fees shall not exceed one hundred ten percent (110%) of documented costs:
>   - (i) "Documented costs" means actual operating costs plus capital recovery plus reasonable administrative overhead;
>   - (ii) The IFC shall establish uniform accounting standards for cost calculation;
>   - (iii) Costs shall be audited annually and published in NITS.

> **(v) Aggregate Fee Limitation.** The aggregate of all fees, charges, and assessments imposed on inter-Regional transit shall not exceed the 110% cost-plus ceiling:
>   - (i) Regions may not circumvent the ceiling through multiple fee categories;
>   - (ii) "Environmental," "climate adaptation," "safety," and "modernization" charges count toward the aggregate;
>   - (iii) The IFC shall monitor for fee multiplication strategies.

> **(w) Summary Suspension Authority.** The ARB may summarily suspend fee collection when:
>   - (i) Prima facie evidence suggests the fee exceeds the 110% ceiling;
>   - (ii) Suspension remains in effect pending full review;
>   - (iii) The charging Region bears the burden of proving cost compliance;
>   - (iv) Failure to provide audited cost documentation creates rebuttable presumption of violation;
>   - (v) The ARB may access Regional financial records for verification.

### Subsections (x-z): Anti-Retaliation [Gap 75, Part 3]

> **(x) Non-Retaliation.** Regions may not:
>   - (i) Increase fees in response to fee challenges by specific users;
>   - (ii) Impose selective enforcement of ancillary requirements against challengers;
>   - (iii) Delay processing of challengers' transit relative to non-challengers;
>   - (iv) Impose new requirements targeting entities that filed ARB complaints.

> **(y) Challenger Protection.** Entities filing infrastructure or fee challenges:
>   - (i) Shall have access to expedited ARB review;
>   - (ii) May recover attorney fees and costs if challenge is successful;
>   - (iii) Are protected from any adverse action by the challenged Region.

> **(z) Whistleblower Provisions.** Regional employees who report infrastructure abuse:
>   - (i) Are protected from termination, demotion, or adverse action;
>   - (ii) May file directly with ARB under seal;
>   - (iii) May receive a portion of any damages recovered.

## Coordination with Article IX-RF, Section 8 (Gap 83)

Gap 83 (Infrastructure Decay) proposes amendments to a **different Article** (Article IX-RF, Section 8) establishing the Critical Interstate Infrastructure Trust framework. This does not collide with Article I, Section 6 but should cross-reference it:

**Recommended Cross-Reference in Gap 83:**

> "(e) **Integration with NITS.** Infrastructure condition reports required under subsection (d) shall be submitted to and published through the National Infrastructure Transparency System established under Article I, Section 6(q). Trust funding levels, maintenance expenditures, and condition assessments shall be included in NITS public accountability metrics."

|-------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Registry Duplication | Two separate registries (status + fees) | Single unified NITS |
| Data Fragmentation | Closure data separate from fee data | Integrated view of infrastructure health |
| Compliance Burden | Two reporting systems | One reporting portal |
| Public Accessibility | Multiple sources to check | Single authoritative source |
| Subsection Economy | 13 subsections across two gaps | 10 unified subsections |

## Relationship to Other Integration Maps

- **Article X Integration Map:** Infrastructure funding relates to fiscal provisions (Gap 83's trust funding interacts with equalization)
- **Article VII Integration Map:** Electoral timelines may be affected by infrastructure emergencies
- **Article II Integration Map:** ARB authority defined in Article II applies throughout
