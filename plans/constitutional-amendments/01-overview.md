# Constitutional Amendments

## Purpose

This directory contains proposed constitutional amendments to address structural dysfunction in American government. Each proposal includes draft constitutional text and implementation guidance.

## Design Philosophy

These amendments share common principles:

1. **Distribute power** - Prevent concentration in any single institution
2. **Create enforceable limits** - Self-executing provisions with judicial enforcement
3. **Anticipate bad faith** - Design for adversarial conditions, not cooperation
4. **Prefer restoration over punishment** - De-escalation when crises occur
5. **Lower political stakes** - Reduce winner-take-all dynamics

## File Structure

Each reform follows a consistent structure:

```text
<reform-name>/
├── 01-overview.md           # Problem statement and summary
├── 02-constitutional-text.md # Draft amendment language
└── 03-implementation.md     # Enabling legislation outline
```

Regional Federalism has extensive additional documentation including design rationale, stress testing, and implementation legislation.

## Relationship to Analysis

These amendments build on problem analysis in `analysis/political/`:

- [Electoral Reform](../../analysis/political/electoral-reform/)
- [Judicial Reform](../../analysis/political/judicial-reform/)
- [Congressional Reform](../../analysis/political/congressional-reform/)
- [Executive Reform](../../analysis/political/executive-reform/)
- [Campaign Finance](../../analysis/political/campaign-finance/)
- [Lobbying](../../analysis/political/lobbying/)

## Why Constitutional?

Statutory reforms are insufficient because:

- Presidents claim inherent authority to ignore statutes
- Courts defer to executive on "political questions"
- Congress lacks will to enforce limits on itself
- Norms have eroded without formal enforcement mechanisms

Constitutional amendments provide:

- Supreme law status
- Judicial enforceability
- Structural permanence
- Clear boundaries

## Status

**Developed proposals:**

- Regional Federalism - extensively stress-tested with implementation legislation
- 11 single-topic reforms - draft constitutional text and implementation guidance

**Concept stage proposals:**

- 5 comprehensive frameworks - overview and future development directions only

Single-topic reforms were extracted from Regional Federalism to allow independent adoption. Comprehensive frameworks represent different philosophical approaches that could be developed further.
