## Approach

Plans in this directory are designed to be:

- **Actionable:** Specific mechanisms, not just goals
- **Realistic:** Grounded in the analysis of what's possible
- **Contingent:** Dependent on preconditions being met
- **Adaptable:** Modular components that can work under various scenarios

## Note on Feasibility

As documented in the [analysis](../../../analysis/international/israel-palestine/04e-comparative-assessment.md), no solution framework is currently achievable under existing political conditions. Plans here describe what *would* be implemented *if* conditions changed to make resolution possible. They are contingency plans, not predictions.
