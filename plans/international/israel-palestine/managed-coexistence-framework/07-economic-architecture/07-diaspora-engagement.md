# Diaspora Engagement Framework

**Parent Document:** [00-overview.md](00-overview.md)

**Applies To:** All Phases (expanding scope over time)

**Objective:** Enable non-refugee diaspora populations to participate in, invest in, and support MCF without prejudicing refugee-specific claims or implying political normalization.

**Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope

### 1.1 Rationale

Both Israeli and Palestinian diaspora communities represent significant human, financial, and political resources that could support MCF success. However, diaspora engagement raises distinct sensitivities:

- **For Palestinians:** Diaspora engagement must not undermine refugee right-of-return claims or substitute for addressing displacement
- **For Israelis:** Diaspora engagement must not imply acceptance of occupation or normalize unjust conditions
- **For both:** Diaspora involvement must not give external populations undue influence over local governance

This framework enables constructive diaspora participation while respecting these constraints.

### 1.2 Distinction from Refugee Framework

| Dimension | Refugee Framework | Diaspora Framework |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Target population** | Registered refugees and descendants with displacement claims | Non-refugee diaspora with no active displacement claims |
| **Rights addressed** | Return, compensation, resettlement | Participation, investment, advocacy |
| **Political sensitivity** | Final-status question (deferred) | Not a final-status question |
| **Legal basis** | UNRWA registration, international law | Voluntary affiliation |
| **MCF role** | Structured postponement (per [04-refugees-diaspora.md](../06-sensitive-issues/04-refugees-diaspora.md)) | Active engagement framework |

### 1.3 Eligible Diaspora Populations

**Israeli Diaspora:**
- Israeli citizens residing abroad
- Former Israeli citizens
- Jewish diaspora with demonstrated connection to Israel (Birthright participation, organizational membership, family ties)

**Palestinian Diaspora (non-refugee):**
- Palestinians in diaspora not registered with UNRWA
- Descendants of 1948/1967 displaced persons who do not hold refugee status
- Palestinian citizens of other countries with demonstrated connection

**Dual/Mixed Heritage:**
- Individuals with both Israeli and Palestinian family connections
- Joint diaspora families

---

## 7. Safeguards and Limitations

### 7.1 Non-Prejudice Principle

**Core Rule:** Diaspora engagement does not:
- Prejudice refugee right-of-return claims
- Substitute for addressing displacement
- Imply acceptance of territorial status quo
- Affect any party's political claims

**Implementation:**
- Explicit non-prejudice language in all diaspora agreements
- Separate tracking of diaspora vs. refugee matters
- No conflation in reporting or statistics
- Clear communication to all participants

### 7.2 Local Primacy

**Core Rule:** Local populations retain primacy in MCF governance:

| Domain | Local Role | Diaspora Role |
|--------|-----------|---------------|
| Governance decisions | Voting authority | Advisory only |
| Economic priorities | Primary beneficiaries | Investors, supporters |
| Cultural programs | Design and control | Participation, support |
| Political representation | Full rights | None through MCF |

**Rationale:** MCF serves those living with the conflict daily; diaspora support is welcome but cannot substitute for local agency.

### 7.3 Demographic Balance

**Concern:** Diaspora investment in land or real estate could affect demographic balance in contested areas.

**Safeguards:**
- No diaspora real estate investment in Jerusalem (excluded from MCF)
- SAZ territorial restrictions apply equally to diaspora investors
- No agricultural land acquisition by diaspora without local partner
- Residency rights not conferred by investment

### 7.4 Political Manipulation Prevention

**Risk:** Diaspora engagement could be weaponized for political purposes.

**Countermeasures:**
- Transparency requirements for all diaspora organizations
- Political activity guidelines with enforcement
- Balanced diaspora advisory structure
- Regular review of diaspora program impact
