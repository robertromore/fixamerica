# Infrastructure Coordination

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md)

**Phase:** All Phases

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## Purpose

Infrastructure Coordination defines MCF's approach to **shared and cross-boundary infrastructure**—telecommunications, transportation networks, utilities, and ports/airports—that require coordination for economic activity regardless of political boundaries.

Infrastructure determines what economic activity is possible. Without reliable telecommunications, CMS benefits cannot be delivered. Without accessible transportation, employment mobility is theoretical. MCF establishes minimum infrastructure coordination to enable economic integration without determining infrastructure ownership.

---

## Design Principles

### 1. Access Over Ownership

MCF ensures infrastructure access for economic activity without determining who owns or controls infrastructure.

**What This Means:**

- Focus on functional access
- Multiple providers acceptable
- Ownership disputes not resolved
- Access arrangements operational

### 2. Reliability Standards

Economic integration requires predictable infrastructure. MCF establishes reliability expectations without taking operational control.

**What This Means:**

- Minimum reliability thresholds
- Accountability for disruptions
- Redundancy where possible
- Emergency provisions

### 3. Non-Weaponization

Infrastructure cannot be weaponized against civilian economic activity within MCF.

**What This Means:**

- Infrastructure shutoffs as economic coercion prohibited
- Civilian infrastructure protected
- Maintenance access guaranteed
- Emergency restoration priority

### 4. Technical Interoperability

Different systems must work together. MCF establishes technical standards for interoperability.

**What This Means:**

- Standard interfaces
- Data format alignment
- Technical cooperation
- No forced system integration

## Telecommunications

### 1. Current Landscape

**Israeli Telecommunications:**

- Advanced infrastructure
- Multiple providers
- Full international connectivity
- Comprehensive mobile coverage

**Palestinian Telecommunications:**

- Limited spectrum access
- Infrastructure constraints
- Dependency on Israeli connections
- Gaza connectivity challenges

**Cross-Border Issues:**

- Spectrum allocation disputes
- International gateway access
- Roaming arrangements
- Equipment import restrictions

### 2. MCF Telecommunications Principles

**Access Guarantees:**

| Element | Standard |
|---------|----------|
| **CMS connectivity** | CMS holders must have reliable connectivity for benefit access |
| **Business connectivity** | Cross-community business requires reliable communication |
| **Emergency communication** | Emergency services must function across boundaries |
| **MCF operations** | MCF institutions require secure communications |

**Non-Interference:**

- No jamming or interference with civilian communications
- No bulk surveillance through MCF (parties retain own authorities)
- No communication shutoffs as coercion
- Emergency exceptions narrowly defined

### 3. Spectrum Coordination

**Challenge:**

Spectrum is finite; allocations affect coverage on both sides.

**MCF Role:**

| Function | Scope |
|----------|-------|
| **Coordination** | Facilitate technical spectrum discussions |
| **Interference resolution** | Technical dispute resolution |
| **Information** | Share coverage and interference data |
| **No allocation** | MCF does not allocate spectrum |

**Technical Arrangements:**

- Interference mitigation
- Border area coordination
- Emergency frequency reservation
- Technical working group

### 4. Connectivity Requirements

**For CMS Benefits:**

- Internet access sufficient for service delivery
- Mobile coverage for communication
- Data services for economic activity
- Voice services for emergencies

**For Business:**

- Reliable bandwidth
- Reasonable latency
- International connectivity
- Payment system connectivity

### 5. Gaza Telecommunications

- Coordinate schedules
- Not operate services directly

### 3. Commercial Transport

**Goods Movement:**

| Type | Arrangements |
|------|--------------|
| **Raw materials** | Defined crossings; inspection protocols |
| **Finished goods** | Commercial corridors; customs coordination |
| **Agricultural** | Perishable goods priority |
| **Industrial** | Regular commercial access |

**Logistics Coordination:**

- Crossing schedules
- Inspection protocols
- Documentation standards
- Dispute resolution for delays

### 4. Gaza Transportation

**Specific Challenges:**

- Closure restrictions
- Limited exit points
- Goods import constraints
- Person movement restrictions

**MCF Approach:**

| Element | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Crossing coordination** | Predictable crossing operations |
| **Commercial access** | Defined commercial transport |
| **Person movement** | CMS holder exit coordination |
| **Emergency** | Medical and humanitarian access |

**Note:** MCF cannot override Israeli or Egyptian border controls but can facilitate coordination and predictability.
