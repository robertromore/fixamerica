# Economic Architecture: Overview

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#economic-architecture-functional-economic-shell-without-sovereignty)

**Applies To:** All Phases (expanding scope over time)

**Objective:** Create functional economic integration that delivers material benefits without requiring sovereignty resolution.

## Purpose of This Section

This directory contains detailed implementation documents for MCF's economic architecture. The economic layer provides **material incentives for participation** and creates **shared interests that survive political volatility**.

The economic architecture is explicitly designed to operate **beneath** rather than **instead of** existing national economies. It creates a supplementary layer, not a replacement.

## Core Design Principles (from Introduction)

**Functional Shell Without Sovereignty:**

- Economic mechanisms operate without resolving sovereignty disputes
- Participation does not imply acceptance of any territorial claims
- Benefits flow from institutional participation, not political alignment

**Regional Integration Compatibility:**

- MCF economic layer designed to plug into regional initiatives
- Abraham Accords, Arab Peace Initiative compatible without dependency
- Non-exclusivity: MCF economic mechanisms do not require regional participation, and regional participation does not require MCF
