# Credential Portability Framework

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#phase-1-years-520-opt-in-civic-membership-without-territorial-change)

**Phase:** Phase 1 onwards

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## Purpose

The Credential Portability Framework enables **recognition of educational and professional qualifications** across participating institutions and jurisdictions. It facilitates labor mobility and economic participation by ensuring that credentials earned in one system are not rendered valueless in another.

The design target is **recognition without gatekeeping**: clear standards and procedures that enable credential holders to demonstrate qualification without discretionary barriers based on where credentials were earned.

---

## Core Principle: Recognition, Not Equivalence

Credential portability operates on the principle of **functional recognition**, not formal equivalence:

- **Recognition** acknowledges that a credential demonstrates competence for specific purposes within MCF domains
- **Equivalence** would require declaring credentials identical to domestic qualifications (which MCF cannot compel)
- MCF establishes its own recognition standards that participating institutions accept
- National systems retain authority over their own credential requirements

---

## 1. Portability Principles

### 1.1 Recognition Standards

**MCF Recognition Criteria**

| Criterion | Standard |
|-----------|----------|
| **Authenticity** | Credential issued by recognized institution |
| **Validity** | Credential current and not revoked |
| **Relevance** | Credential relates to claimed competence |
| **Sufficiency** | Credential meets MCF baseline for category |

**Recognition Does NOT Require**

- National government endorsement
- Bilateral recognition agreement
- Identical curriculum or standards
- Cultural or political compatibility assessment

### 1.2 Quality Assurance

Quality assurance focuses on **institutional capacity**, not political acceptability:

| Quality Indicator | Assessment Method |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Institutional accreditation** | Recognized by national accreditation body or international equivalent |
| **Program standards** | Curriculum meets international benchmarks for field |
| **Assessment integrity** | Examination and evaluation standards documented |
| **Ongoing oversight** | Institution subject to regular quality review |

### 1.3 Fraud Prevention

**Verification Mechanisms**

| Mechanism | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Direct verification** | MCF contacts issuing institution |
| **Database verification** | Cross-reference with credential databases |
| **Document authentication** | Physical and digital security features |
| **Holder verification** | Identity confirmation through CMS |

### 1.4 Progressive Expansion

Credential coverage expands over MCF phases:

| Phase | Credential Categories |
|-------|----------------------|
| **Phase 1** | Educational certificates, core professional licenses, vocational qualifications |
| **Phase 2** | Expanded professional licenses, specialized credentials, SAZ-specific recognition |
| **Phase 3** | Comprehensive recognition, potential integration with successor frameworks |
