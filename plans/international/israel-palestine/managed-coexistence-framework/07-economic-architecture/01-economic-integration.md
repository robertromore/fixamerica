# Economic Integration Model

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#economic-architecture-functional-economic-shell-without-sovereignty)

**Phase:** All Phases (expanding scope)

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## Purpose

The Economic Integration Model defines how MCF's economic layer interfaces with existing national economies without requiring sovereignty resolution. It establishes **mandatory procedural rules** for customs and banking that minimize discretion and prevent informal capture, while remaining technology-agnostic and adaptable.

The design target is **procedural determinism without technical lock-in**: detailed enough that abuse is hard, flexible enough that adaptation is possible.

---

## Core Principle: Functional Shell, Not Economic Union

MCF creates a **supplementary economic layer** beneath, not instead of, existing national economies. This layer:

- Enables economic activity that would otherwise be blocked by conflict
- Does not replace national currency, taxation, or trade policy
- Does not require sovereignty resolution to function
- Grows through demonstrated value, not political negotiation

The economic shell is explicitly **non-sovereign**: it facilitates transactions without claiming jurisdiction over territory or populations.

---

## 1. MCF Economic Domain

### 1.1 Included Activities

The MCF economic layer governs:

| Activity | Description | Phase |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **PCC commerce** | Goods and services moving through Protected Civic Corridors | 0+ |
| **CMS employment** | Employment of CMS holders under MCF protections | 1+ |
| **Corridor banking** | Financial services within MCF framework | 1+ |
| **Confederal arbitration** | Commercial dispute resolution | 1+ |
| **SAZ economy** | Full economic activity within Special Administrative Zones | 2+ |

### 1.2 Excluded Activities

The following remain under national authority:

- Sovereign currency issuance
- National taxation (except within SAZ internal governance)
- National trade agreements and tariffs
- National labor law (except where MCF provides higher floor)
- Monetary policy

### 1.3 Dual Jurisdiction Principle

Where MCF and national economic authority overlap:

- **More protective standard applies** (for worker/consumer rights)
- **MCF procedures apply** within MCF domains
- **National law applies** outside MCF domains
- **Conflicts escalate** to confederal arbitration, then guarantor review

---

## 2. Customs Protocols

### 2.1 Governing Principle

Customs within MCF corridors operates on the principle of **presumptive permission**: goods are permitted unless specifically prohibited, rather than prohibited unless specifically permitted.

Discretionary denial is the primary vector for economic sabotage. These protocols exist to eliminate it.

### 2.2 Classification System

**Tier 1: Automatically Permitted**

| Category | Examples | Inspection Requirement |
|----------|----------|----------------------|
| Food and agriculture | Fresh produce, grains, processed foods | Random sampling only |
| Medical supplies | Medicines, equipment, consumables | Documentation verification |
| Consumer goods | Clothing, electronics, household items | Random sampling only |
| Industrial inputs | Raw materials, components, machinery | Documentation verification |
| Services equipment | Tools, repair supplies, professional equipment | Random sampling only |

**Tier 2: Permitted with Documentation**

| Category | Examples | Inspection Requirement |
|----------|----------|----------------------|
| Dual-use items | Fertilizers, chemicals, communications equipment | Manifest verification + random inspection |
| High-value goods | Jewelry, art, large equipment | Valuation documentation |
| Regulated substances | Pharmaceuticals, controlled chemicals | Licensing verification |

**Tier 3: Prohibited**

| Category | Examples | Exception Process |
|----------|----------|------------------|
| Weapons | Firearms, explosives, ammunition | None |
| Military equipment | Combat vehicles, body armor, night vision | None |
| Sanctioned items | Per international sanctions lists | None |

**Classification Authority**

- Initial classification by MCF Corridor Authority
- Appeal to Customs Review Panel within 48 hours
- Final appeal to confederal arbitration
- Classification list published and updated quarterly

### 2.3 Inspection Procedures

**Time Limits**

| Inspection Type | Maximum Duration | Extension Authority |
|-----------------|------------------|---------------------|
| **Document check** | 30 minutes | None |
| **Random sampling** | 2 hours | Supervisor approval (max 4 hours) |
| **Secondary inspection** | 8 hours | Director approval (max 24 hours) |
| **Extended hold** | 72 hours | Corridor Authority + documented cause |

**Mandatory Release Rule**

If inspection is not completed within the applicable time limit:

- Goods are released with documentation
- Post-release audit may occur
- Shipper is not penalized for release
- Inspector must document reason for delay

**Release may NOT be conditioned on:**

- Payment of unofficial fees
- Political statements or compliance
- Identity of shipper beyond documentation
- Destination use beyond classification

### 2.4 Secondary Inspection Triggers

Secondary inspection may be triggered **only** by:

| Trigger | Documentation Required |
|---------|----------------------|
| Manifest discrepancy | Specific discrepancy identified in writing |
| Random selection | Selection methodology documented and auditable |
| Intelligence information | Specific, documented threat (not generalized risk) |
| Prior violation | Within 12 months, documented in system |

**Prohibited Triggers**

Secondary inspection may **NOT** be triggered by:

- Shipper identity, ethnicity, or community
- Political affiliation or CMS status
- Generalized "security concerns"
- Quota pressure or throughput management
- Request from party authorities without documented cause

### 2.5 Documentation Requirements

**Standard Manifest**

All shipments require:

- Shipper identification (individual or firm)
- Consignee identification
- Goods description per classification
- Declared value
- Origin declaration

**MCF provides standardized forms** in Arabic, Hebrew, and English. Non-standard documentation may be accepted if content is equivalent.

**Electronic Submission**

- Electronic manifest submission available and encouraged
- Electronic submission does not waive inspection rights
- Electronic confirmation constitutes presumptive approval
- Physical inspection may still occur per procedures

### 2.6 Fees and Charges

**Permitted Fees**

| Fee Type | Cap | Purpose |
|----------|-----|---------|
| Processing fee | $25/shipment | Administrative costs |
| Inspection fee | $50/secondary inspection | Inspection staff costs |
| Storage fee | $10/day after 48 hours | Storage costs |

**Prohibited Charges**

- Expedited processing fees (creates two-tier system)
- Security deposits (except for extended hold appeals)
- Unofficial payments of any kind
- Fees tied to goods value (percentage-based)

**Fee Schedule**

- Published quarterly
- Uniform across all corridors
- Subject to audit
- Revenue dedicated to corridor operations

### 2.7 Appeal and Remedy

**Immediate Appeal**

- Shipper may appeal any detention to on-site supervisor
- Supervisor decision within 2 hours

| 24-72 hours over limit | $100/day + storage waived |
| 72+ hours over limit | $250/day + full costs + expedited processing for 6 months |

### 2.8 Audit and Oversight

**Internal Audit**

- Monthly random audit of 5% of inspection decisions
- Quarterly pattern analysis
- Annual comprehensive review

**External Audit**

- Guarantor access to inspection records
- Annual third-party audit
- Civil society observation permitted

**Performance Metrics**

| Metric | Target | Reporting |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Average clearance time | < 4 hours | Monthly |
| Secondary inspection rate | < 10% | Monthly |
| Appeal rate | < 2% | Quarterly |
| Wrongful detention rate | < 0.5% | Quarterly |

## 3. Banking and Financial Access Protocols

### 3.1 Governing Principle

Banking within MCF operates on the principle of **universal basic access**: all compliant individuals and firms have the right to basic financial services. Banking exclusion is a form of economic coercion that can collapse the entire framework silently.

These protocols therefore contain **stronger procedural protections** than customs, reflecting the structural (rather than episodic) nature of financial exclusion.

### 3.2 Guaranteed Access Rights

**Individual Account Rights**

Every CMS holder has the right to:

| Service | Standard | Timeline |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Transaction account | Deposit, withdraw, transfer | 14 days from application |
| Wage receipt | Employer direct deposit | Included in transaction account |
| Basic savings | Interest-bearing option | Available upon request |
| Domestic transfers | Within MCF banking system | Same-day |
| International transfers | To permitted destinations | 3 business days |

**Business Account Rights**

Every MCF-registered business has the right to:

| Service | Standard | Timeline |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Business account | Commercial transaction account | 30 days from application |
| Payment processing | Receive customer payments | Included in business account |
| Trade finance | Letters of credit, documentary collections | Available from licensed providers |
| Payroll services | Wage disbursement to employees | Available from licensed providers |

### 3.3 Prohibited Practices

**Blanket De-Risking**

The following are **categorically prohibited**:

| Practice | Definition | Why Prohibited |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| **Territory-wide exclusion** | Refusing services to all applicants from a territory | Collective punishment |
| **Category-based denial** | Refusing services based on ethnicity, religion, nationality | Discrimination |
| **Political screening** | Conditioning services on political views or affiliations | Coercion |
| **CMS-based denial** | Refusing services because applicant holds (or doesn't hold) CMS | MCF capture |

**Individual De-Risking Without Cause**

Account denial or closure requires:

- Specific, documented reason tied to individual conduct
- Written notification to account holder
- Opportunity to respond before closure (except emergency freeze)
- Appeal pathway

### 3.4 Account Lifecycle Procedures

**Application**

| Step | Timeline | Documentation |
|------|----------|---------------|
| Application submitted | Day 0 | Standard form + identity verification |
| Initial review | 7 days | Automated + manual compliance check |
| Decision | 14 days | Approval or denial with reasons |
| Appeal (if denied) | 14 days from denial | Written appeal to Review Panel |

**Denial may be based only on:**

- Identity verification failure
- Documented prior financial crime conviction
- Current sanctions listing (international, not party-specific)
- Outstanding MCF compliance violation

**Denial may NOT be based on:**

- Residence location
- Community membership
- Political views or affiliations
- Family associations

### 3.5 Transaction Monitoring

**AML/CTF Framework**

MCF banking operates under a **standardized AML/CTF framework** that:

- Applies uniformly to all accounts
- Uses objective, auditable criteria
- Does not permit selective enforcement
- Reports to MCF compliance authority (not party authorities)

**Transaction Thresholds**

| Threshold | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| < $1,000 equivalent | No additional documentation |
| $1,000 - $10,000 | Purpose declaration |
| > $10,000 | Enhanced documentation + 24-hour review |
| > $50,000 | Director approval + 72-hour review |

**Pattern Monitoring**

Automated monitoring for:

- Structuring (splitting transactions to avoid thresholds)
- Unusual volume changes
- High-risk destination patterns
- Known typologies

**Escalation Pathway**

1. Automated flag → Compliance review (48 hours)
2. Compliance concern → Enhanced monitoring (30 days)
3. Confirmed concern → Account restriction + notification
4. Serious concern → Referral to MCF compliance authority
5. Criminal referral → Only through MCF authority (not direct to parties)

### 3.6 Data Protection and Sharing

**Data Collection Limits**

Banks may collect only:

- Identity verification data
- Transaction records
- Compliance documentation

| Guarantor auditors | Aggregated, anonymized data | Audit purposes only |
| Account holder | All own-account data | Upon request |
| Party authorities | **Prohibited** except via MCF process | Court order required |
| Third parties | **Prohibited** | No exceptions |

**Inference Prohibition**

- Is not a currency itself
- Provides transparent exchange rates
- Reduces conversion costs

**Settlement Principles**

- Real-time gross settlement for large transactions
- Batch settlement for small transactions
- Published exchange rates (no hidden spreads)
