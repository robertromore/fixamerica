# Labor Mobility Framework

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#phase-1-years-520-opt-in-civic-membership-without-territorial-change)

**Phase:** Phase 1 onwards

**Status:** Draft

---

## Purpose

The Labor Mobility Framework establishes how **CMS holders access protected employment** across community boundaries. It provides material incentives for MCF participation while ensuring that employment access cannot be weaponized as a tool of collective punishment or individual coercion.

The design target is **employment as economic right, not political lever**: detailed procedural rules that prevent discretionary denial while maintaining legitimate security functions.

---

## Core Principle: Employment Access Is a Right, Not a Privilege

For CMS holders within MCF domains, access to employment opportunities is a **right with procedural protections**, not a discretionary privilege that can be withdrawn for political reasons. This framework exists because employment denial has historically been a primary vector for economic coercion against civilian populations.

---

## 1. Labor Mobility Principles

### 1.1 Protected Access

CMS holders have the right to:

- Apply for employment with MCF-registered employers
- Receive non-discriminatory consideration for positions they are qualified for
- Work under MCF labor protections regardless of community origin
- Move through corridors for employment purposes

### 1.2 Equal Treatment

Within MCF employment:

- Compensation must be equal for equal work regardless of community origin
- Working conditions must be uniform across community origins
- Advancement opportunities must be available without community-based barriers
- Discipline and termination must follow identical procedures

### 1.3 Security Compatibility

The framework includes security measures that:

- Use objective, auditable criteria
- Operate within defined time limits
- Are subject to appeal
- Cannot serve as pretext for economic exclusion

### 1.4 Benefit Sustainability

Employment protections are structured to:

- Create employer incentive for participation
- Generate economic value that sustains the system
- Withstand political pressure from parties
- Scale with MCF growth

## 2. Employment Access

### 2.1 Eligible Employment

**Sector Coverage**

| Sector | Phase 1 | Phase 2 (SAZ) | Notes |
|--------|---------|---------------|-------|
| **Agriculture** | Full | Full | High demand, low security sensitivity |
| **Construction** | Full | Full | Major employment pathway |
| **Manufacturing** | Full | Full | Industrial zones priority |
| **Healthcare** | Licensed positions | Full | Credential portability required |
| **Retail/Services** | Registered employers | Full | Customer-facing positions |
| **Technology** | Registered employers | Full | Remote work enabled |
| **Professional services** | Licensed positions | Full | Credential portability required |
| **Public sector** | MCF institutions only | SAZ administration | Limited scope |

**Employer Types**

| **Israeli firm** | MCF registration required | Upon registration |
| **Palestinian firm** | MCF registration required | Upon registration |
| **International firm** | MCF registration required | Upon registration |
| **SAZ enterprise** (Phase 2+) | SAZ business registration | Automatic eligibility |

**Geographic Scope**

| Phase | Employment Locations |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Phase 1** | MCF-registered employer sites, corridor facilities, remote work |
| **Phase 2** | Above + full SAZ territory |
| **Phase 3** | Expanded based on convergence progress |

### 2.2 Access Procedures

**Work Authorization**

CMS holders require **MCF Work Authorization** to access protected employment. This is distinct from any national work permit requirements.

| Component | Requirement | Duration |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **CMS status** | Valid, not suspended | Concurrent with CMS |
| **MCF Work Authorization** | Issued upon CMS grant | 1 year, renewable |
| **Employer registration** | Employer registered with MCF | N/A |
| **Security clearance** | Included in CMS vetting | Concurrent with CMS |

**Work Authorization Process**

| Step | Timeline | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| CMS granted | Day 0 | Automatic Work Authorization eligibility |
| Work Authorization application | With CMS or separately | Submit through MCF portal |
| Processing | 7 days maximum | Automated verification |
| Issuance | Day 7 | Digital authorization + physical card |
| Renewal | 30 days before expiration | Streamlined renewal process |

**Denial Grounds** (exhaustive list)

Work Authorization may be denied only for:

- CMS status invalid or suspended
- Active security investigation (not generalized concern)
- Outstanding MCF compliance violation

**Work Authorization may NOT be denied for:**

- Political views or affiliations
- Family associations
- Community origin
- Previous employment with either party's government
- Refusal to provide non-required information

### 2.3 Movement for Employment

**Corridor Access for Work**

CMS holders with Work Authorization may:

- Transit corridors for employment purposes
- Present Work Authorization at corridor checkpoints
- Access employer facilities within corridor-connected areas
- Return home via corridors after work hours

**Transit Procedures**

| Checkpoint Type | Documentation | Processing Time |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Corridor entry** | CMS + Work Authorization + employer verification | 15 minutes maximum |
| **Corridor exit** | CMS + Work Authorization | 10 minutes maximum |
| **Employer site entry** | Work Authorization | Per employer security |

**Transit Denial Grounds** (exhaustive list)

- Invalid CMS status
- Invalid Work Authorization
- Specific, documented security alert (not generalized risk)
- Corridor closure (affects all traffic)

**Transit may NOT be denied for:**

- Quota limitations
- Political events unrelated to security
- Employer-specific issues (handled separately)
- Generalized "security concerns"

### 2.4 Restrictions

**Security-Sensitive Employment**

Certain positions are excluded from MCF employment protections:

| Category | Examples | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| **National security positions** | Military, intelligence, law enforcement | Sovereign function |
| **Classified access** | Positions requiring security clearances | National security |
| **Critical infrastructure** | Nuclear, major utilities (non-MCF) | Security sensitivity |

**Geographic Limitations**

| Phase | Limitations |
|-------|------------|
| **Phase 1** | Employment at registered sites only; commute via designated corridors |
| **Phase 2** | Above + full SAZ access; reduced corridor restrictions |
| **Phase 3** | Expanded based on convergence |

**Sector Limitations**

During Phase 1, certain sectors require additional procedures:

| Sector | Additional Requirement | Rationale |
|--------|----------------------|-----------|
| **Healthcare** | Credential verification via portability system | Patient safety |
| **Education** | Credential verification via portability system | Quality assurance |
| **Finance** | MCF banking compliance check | AML/CTF |

### 2.7 Interaction with Existing Movement Regimes

MCF Work Authorization operates alongside, not in replacement of, existing national movement control systems. This section addresses the operational reality that CMS holders in the West Bank and Gaza must navigate Israeli-controlled checkpoints, permits, and crossings that MCF does not control.

**Operating Scenarios:**

| Scenario | Description | MCF Role |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **PCC available** | CMS holder transits through a Protected Civic Corridor | MCF controls access; national checkpoints bypassed |
| **Mixed transit** | CMS holder uses national crossings with MCF authorization | MCF authorization supplements but does not replace national permits |
| **No PCC available** | CMS holder relies entirely on national movement systems | MCF authorization adds credential value but does not guarantee physical access |

**For PCC-available transit:**

- Standard PCC processing times apply (15 minutes entry, 10 minutes exit)
- No national permit required for PCC transit **where PCC designation includes a negotiated legal carve-out**; otherwise national permits still apply with expedited processing targets
- PCC coverage expansion is a priority metric for Phase 0→1 transition

**For mixed transit:**

- MCF Work Authorization is a recognized employment credential that supports national permit applications
- Guarantor-facilitated transit protocols: guarantors negotiate expedited processing at designated crossings for CMS Work Authorization holders
- Target: CMS holders wait no longer than 150% of average crossing time for non-CMS travelers at the same checkpoint
- Transit time monitoring is a JSVC reporting metric; sustained average transit times exceeding targets trigger guarantor engagement

**For no-PCC-available transit:**

- MCF Work Authorization provides employer confidence, legal protections, and arbitration access
- MCF honestly acknowledges that authorization does not guarantee physical access in this scenario
- MCF documents access denials and delays as part of its verification function
- Documented access barriers feed into phase transition assessment (Operational Parity Assessment per [Phase Transitions](../08-operational-procedures/02-phase-transitions.md))

**What This Section Acknowledges:**

The existing Israeli-controlled permit system governs approximately 170,000 Palestinian workers' access to employment in Israel. MCF cannot abolish this system. What MCF can do:

1. **Create alternatives** (PCC corridors that bypass checkpoints)
2. **Negotiate improvements** (guarantor-facilitated expedited processing)
3. **Document the gap** (systematic recording of access barriers)
4. **Make the gap costly** (access disparity feeds into transition assessment)
5. **Provide value regardless** (legal protections, arbitration, credential recognition operate even when physical access is constrained)

The single most likely failure mode for labor mobility is a CMS holder with valid MCF Work Authorization who is denied passage at an Israeli checkpoint that MCF does not control. MCF's response is not to pretend this won't happen, but to minimize its frequency (through PCC expansion), document its occurrence (through verification), and create diplomatic costs (through guarantor engagement).

**Employer-Specific Security**

For positions with specific security requirements:

| Requirement | Process |
|-------------|---------|
| **Additional clearance** | Request to MCF, processed within 14 days |
| **Position-specific** | Tied to specific position, not worker generally |
| **Appealable** | Denial appealable to MCF Security Review |
| **Documented** | Specific grounds required |

| **Extended closure** (1-7 days) | Wages continue at 80%; alternative work offered |
| **Prolonged closure** (> 7 days) | Unemployment benefit activation; job protection for 90 days |

**Security Emergency**

During declared security emergencies:

- Employment protections remain in effect
- Work Authorization not mass-suspended
- Individual security actions require specific cause
- Post-emergency review of all employment-related security actions

### 6.4 Security Communication

**Information Flow**

| Direction | Content | Restrictions |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **MCF → Employer** | Threat alerts, corridor status, general guidance | No individual worker information |
| **Employer → MCF** | Incident reports, security concerns | Specific concerns, not profiling |
| **JSVC → MCF Labor** | Verified threat information | Security-specific, not political |
| **MCF Labor → Workers** | Corridor status, safety alerts | Direct notification |

**Prohibited Communications**

- Party security services may not request worker information from employers
