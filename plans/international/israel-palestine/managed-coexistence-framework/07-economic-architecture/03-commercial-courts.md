# Confederal Commercial Courts

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#phase-1-years-520-opt-in-civic-membership-without-territorial-change)

**Phase:** Phase 1 onwards

**Status:** Draft

---

## Purpose

Confederal Commercial Courts provide **dispute resolution for business, commercial, and labor matters** within MCF domains. They enable economic activity by providing predictable, enforceable resolution mechanisms that do not require national courts to recognize each other's authority.

The design target is **adjudicative predictability without jurisdictional dependency**: disputes are resolved through transparent procedures with enforceable outcomes, regardless of the parties' national legal systems.

---

## Core Principle: Jurisdiction by Participation, Not Territory

The Commercial Courts derive jurisdiction from **participation in MCF**, not from territorial sovereignty. This means:

- Courts operate without requiring either party to recognize the other's courts
- Jurisdiction attaches to MCF activity, not to persons or territory
- Enforcement operates through MCF mechanisms, supplemented by guarantor support
- Judgments are portable within MCF but do not automatically bind national courts
