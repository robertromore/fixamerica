# Phase 3 Voluntary Convergence: Overview

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#phase-3-years-50100-voluntary-convergence)

**Phase Duration:** Years 50-100+ (no fixed endpoint)

**Objective:** Enable political integration only if repeatedly chosen by affected populations.

**Status:** Draft

---

## Purpose of This Section

This directory contains detailed implementation documents for Phase 3 (Voluntary Convergence). Unlike Phases 0-2, which are **procedurally mandatory** when conditions are met, Phase 3 is **political choice-based** and has no predetermined path.

Phase 3 represents the point where MCF could transform from a conflict-management mechanism into a permanent political arrangement—or continue indefinitely as the managed coexistence status quo.

---

## Core Principle: Non-Predetermination

**MCF does not define success as reaching Phase 3.**

Phase 3 is optional. The framework enables choice but does not require any particular outcome. Success is measured by:

- Violence durably reduced (70%+ from baseline over 10+ years)
- Institutions remaining stable under stress
- Political options remaining **open** rather than foreclosed

Documents in this section define procedures for choosing, not which choice to make.

## Possible Outcomes

### Three End States

| End State | Definition | Sovereignty |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| **Confederation** | MCF institutions become permanent fixtures alongside national governments | Both retain full sovereignty |
| **Federation** | Populations merge into a single federal state | Shared sovereignty |
| **Enhanced Dual-State** | Two fully independent states with strong cooperation derived from MCF | Separate sovereignty |

### Fourth Option: Indefinite Continuation

MCF may never reach Phase 3 referendum approval. This is **not failure**—managed coexistence as a long-term condition is a legitimate outcome if it produces:

- Sustained civilian safety
- Predictable access to resources
- Declining escalation frequency
- Normalization of non-violent civic participation across generations

## Entry Requirements

Phase 3 may only be entered after sustained Phase 2 success. Per [Phase Transitions](../08-operational-procedures/02-phase-transitions.md):

### SAZ Stability Metrics (60+ months)

- Crime/violence rates in SAZs ≤ 50% of surrounding areas
- Waiting list or full occupancy (demand exceeds capacity)
- ≥ 70% resident satisfaction in annual surveys
- No major governance crises

### Institutional Metrics (continuous)

- All Phase 0/1 metrics maintained above threshold
- Core institutions fully operational (full charter compliance for 24 months)
- Effective inter-SAZ coordination (if multiple SAZs)
- ≥ 80% of judicial rulings accepted without appeal

### Convergence Demand Indicators

- ≥ 50% of CMS holders support deeper integration (survey data)
- Cross-community leadership support
- Positive political conditions assessment from guarantors

### Authorization Process

1. JSVC certifies Phase 2 success criteria are met
2. Referendum approval required (see [01-referenda-procedures.md](01-referenda-procedures.md))
3. 90-day notice period
4. Guarantor formal endorsement
5. Transition implementation per Phase 3 design documents

---

## Referendum Requirements Summary

Phase 3 is the **first phase requiring a framework-wide referendum** among all CMS holders on the political direction of MCF. (Phase 1→2 includes localized SAZ Local Consent Plebiscites for specific SAZ locations, which are community-level consent processes rather than framework-level political mandates.) Key thresholds:

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| Eligibility | CMS holders in good standing ≥ 24 months |
| Participation threshold | ≥ 60% of eligible voters |
| Approval threshold | ≥ 60% of votes cast |
| Community thresholds | ≥ 40% support in each major community |
| Campaign period | Minimum 90 days |
| Observation | International observation mandatory |

Detailed procedures in [01-referenda-procedures.md](01-referenda-procedures.md).

## Design Principles for Phase 3

### 1. Equal Treatment of Paths

All three end states are described with equal rigor. MCF does not favor any particular outcome—the choice belongs to the affected populations.

### 2. Rights Protection

CRC protections carry forward to any end state. Rights cannot be stripped; they can only expand. See [06-rights-continuity.md](06-rights-continuity.md).

### 3. Community Balance

Dual-community representation is maintained throughout Phase 3 processes. No single community can impose an outcome on the other.

### 4. Reversibility

Exit options exist at each stage of Phase 3 transition. Populations can pause, reverse, or abandon transformation if conditions change.

### 5. Incrementalism

Transformation timelines are measured in years to decades, not months. Rapid change is avoided to allow course correction.

### 6. International Involvement

Guarantors and international observers maintain roles throughout Phase 3, transitioning only as new arrangements stabilize.

---

## Relationship to Other Phases

### Phase 2 Continuation

Phase 2 (SAZ) mechanisms remain operational until Phase 3 transformation is complete. There is no gap in governance.

### Phase Regression

If Phase 3 transformation fails, MCF can regress to stable Phase 2 operations. Regression is procedural, not catastrophic.

### Parallel Processes

Nothing in Phase 3 precludes parallel political negotiations outside MCF. Phase 3 is one pathway; it does not claim exclusivity.
