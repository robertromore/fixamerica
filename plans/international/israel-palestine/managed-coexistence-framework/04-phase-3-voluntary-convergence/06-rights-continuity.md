# Rights Continuity Framework

**Parent Document:** [00-overview.md](00-overview.md)

**Applies To:** All Phase 3 transitions and end states

**Objective:** Ensure CRC protections carry forward to any end state without diminution.

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## 1. Core Principle

### 1.1 Non-Retrogression

**CRC protections cannot be stripped.** They can only expand.

Regardless of which end state is chosen—confederation, federation, or dual-state—the rights established in the Confederal Rights Compact (CRC) form the floor of protection. No Phase 3 transition may reduce individual rights below CRC levels.

### 1.2 Rationale

Rights continuity serves multiple purposes:

1. **Legitimacy:** Protects those who invested trust in MCF
2. **Stability:** Prevents fear-driven opposition to transition
3. **Incentive:** Encourages CMS enrollment despite uncertainty
4. **Minority protection:** Guards against majoritarian rollback

### 1.3 Binding Force

Rights continuity is:
- Embedded in all Phase 3 transition documents
- Certified by guarantors before transition proceeds
- Enforceable by international mechanisms post-transition
- Protected by supermajority requirements for modification

## 3. Translation to End States

### 3.1 Confederation

**Mechanism:** CRC remains binding confederal law

**Details:**
- CRC text incorporated by reference in confederal charter
- CRC Review Panel continues as primary CRC adjudication body
- National governments may not derogate from CRC in their territories
- CRC amendments require supermajority in Confederal Council + community vetoes

**Enforcement (aligned with [Confederation Path](02-confederation-path.md)):**

| Matter Type | Primary Forum | Appellate Forum |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| CRC rights disputes | CRC Review Panel | Confederal Judicial Body (only after CRC Review Panel exhaustion) |
| Confederal charter interpretation | Confederal Judicial Body | None (final) |
| Constitutional Floor matters | Confederal Judicial Body | None (final) |

- Individual right of action preserved
- Guarantor oversight during transition; phased reduction over 10 years
- International reporting obligations

### 3.2 Federation

**Mechanism:** CRC becomes constitutional rights chapter

**Details:**
- CRC rights enumerated in federal constitution
- Constitutional status provides highest protection
- Federal courts enforce rights against all levels of government
- Amendment requires supermajority + approval in both communities

**Constitutional Requirements:**
- CRC rights are entrenched (cannot be amended by simple majority)
- Constitutional court with parity representation
- Individual standing to bring constitutional challenges
- State of emergency provisions cannot suspend core CRC rights

**Enforcement:**
- Federal constitutional court
- Regional courts apply CRC/constitutional rights
- International treaty commitments reinforce domestic protection
- Human rights commission monitors implementation

### 3.3 Dual-State

**Mechanism:** CRC becomes bilateral treaty obligations

**Details:**
- CRC rights codified in bilateral treaty between the two states
- Treaty registered with UN; creates international obligations
- Domestic implementation required in both states
- Joint monitoring mechanism

**Treaty Structure:**
- Core rights provisions (non-derogable)
- Implementation provisions
- Monitoring and reporting
- Dispute resolution (international arbitration)
- Amendment procedures (mutual consent)

**Enforcement:**
- Domestic courts apply treaty provisions
- Bilateral arbitration for inter-state disputes
- International court jurisdiction for treaty breaches
- Individual petition to international bodies (ICCPR, regional mechanisms)

## 4. Minority Protections

### 4.1 Guaranteed Representation

Regardless of end state, minority community guaranteed:

| Mechanism | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Reserved seats | Minimum representation in legislature |
| Community veto | Block measures affecting core identity interests |
| Proportional allocation | Fair share of appointments, resources |
| Cultural autonomy | Self-governance over community-specific matters |

### 4.2 Community Veto Procedures

**Scope:** Community veto applies to measures affecting identity-related matters, classified as follows:

| Category | Examples | Override Permitted? |
|----------|----------|---------------------|
| **Non-Overrideable (Absolute Veto)** | | |
| Religious practice | Freedom of worship, religious observance | No |
| Holy site access | Entry to religious sites, worship at sites | No |
| Language recognition | Official status of community language | No |
| Community-specific family law | Marriage, divorce, inheritance under religious law | No |
| **Overrideable (2/3 Supermajority)** | | |
| Educational curriculum details | Historical narrative emphasis, required texts | Yes |
| Cultural heritage resource allocation | Funding levels, preservation priorities | Yes |
| Language service levels | Translation services, signage requirements | Yes |
| Cultural program funding | Arts, media, cultural institution support | Yes |

**Procedure:**

1. Measure proposed through normal legislative process
2. Community caucus may invoke veto within 14 days
3. Veto triggers mandatory consultation (30 days)
4. For overrideable matters: modified proposal requires community caucus approval OR supermajority override (2/3)
5. For non-overrideable matters: community caucus consent is required; no override available

### 4.3 Exit Option

**Individual Exit:**
- CMS holders may exit MCF successor arrangement
- 180-day window after each Phase 3 transition stage
- Exit preserves underlying citizenship
- No penalty for exit
- Re-enrollment possible after 24 months

**Collective Concerns:**

- If referendum shows >50% opposition within either community (per [Referenda Procedures Section 9.3](01-referenda-procedures.md#93-exit-option)):
  - Additional safeguards negotiated before implementation
  - Guarantor involvement in transition monitoring
  - Periodic review of minority satisfaction

### 4.4 Supermajority Requirements

**Fundamental Changes Require:**

| Change Type | Threshold |
|-------------|-----------|
| CRC rights modification | 2/3 supermajority + both community caucuses |
| Elimination of any CRC right | Prohibited (non-retrogression) |
| Reduction of minority protections | 3/4 supermajority + affected community consent |
| Constitutional/treaty amendment on rights | 2/3 + community ratification |

### 7.3 Settlements

CRC protections apply to individuals regardless of settlement status:
