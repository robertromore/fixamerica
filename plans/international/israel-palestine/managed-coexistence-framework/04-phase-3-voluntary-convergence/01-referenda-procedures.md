# Phase 3 Referenda Procedures

**Parent Document:** [00-overview.md](00-overview.md)

**Applies To:** Phase 3 decisions requiring popular approval

**Objective:** Establish fair, transparent, and internationally observed referendum procedures for Phase 3 transitions.

**Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope

### 1.1 Rationale

Phase 3 represents fundamental choices about political futures. Unlike earlier phases where transitions are procedurally automatic when criteria are met, Phase 3 requires explicit popular consent through referendum.

Referendum procedures must be:

- **Fair:** Equal opportunity for all positions
- **Transparent:** Open to scrutiny at every stage
- **Inclusive:** All invested participants (CMS holders) can participate
- **Credible:** Results accepted by losers as legitimate

**Why CMS-Only Eligibility:** Phase 3 referenda determine the future of MCF institutions. CMS holders have demonstrated sustained investment in the coexistence framework (24+ months in good standing). Non-CMS residents within SAZs have had opportunity to obtain CMS but chose not to; they benefit from MCF governance without committing to its future. This eligibility design mirrors the principle that constitutional choices belong to those who have joined the constitutional community.

### 1.2 Referendum Types

| Type | Purpose | When Used |
|------|---------|-----------|
| **Transition Referendum** | Approve entry into Phase 3 | Phase 2→3 transition |
| **End-State Referendum** | Choose among confederation, federation, dual-state | After Phase 3 entry |
| **Ratification Referendum** | Approve specific constitutional/treaty text | Before implementation |
| **Confirmation Referendum** | Reaffirm commitment at milestones | During transformation |

## 2. Eligibility

### 2.1 Voter Eligibility

**Eligible Voters:**
- CMS holders in good standing for ≥ 24 continuous months
- Age 18+ at referendum date
- Not subject to active CMS suspension

**Eligibility Verification:**
- CMS Registry provides voter roll 90 days before referendum
- 60-day challenge period for eligibility disputes
- Final voter roll certified 30 days before referendum
- JSVC certifies voter roll accuracy

### 2.2 Registration

**Automatic Registration:**
- All eligible CMS holders automatically registered
- No separate voter registration required
- CMS Registry serves as voter registry

**Opt-Out:**

- CMS holders may declare opt-out (formal abstention)
- Opt-outs **are counted in the participation denominator** (preventing gaming of turnout thresholds)
- Opt-out is revocable until 90 days before referendum (early deadline prevents strategic coordination)
- Opt-out does not affect CMS status
- Opt-out is not counted as a vote against any option (distinct from casting a "no" or "status quo" vote)

**Anti-Gaming Rationale:** If opt-outs were removed from the denominator, a motivated faction could artificially lower turnout requirements by coordinating mass opt-outs. By counting opt-outs in the denominator (but not as votes), the participation threshold retains its legitimacy function.

### 2.3 Disputed Eligibility

**Challenge Procedure:**
1. Written challenge with supporting evidence
2. CMS Registry initial determination (7 days)
3. Appeal to CMS Appeals Board (14 days)
4. Final appeal to Confederal Judicial Body (14 days)
5. No further appeal; decision binding

## 5. Threshold Framework

### 5.1 Participation Thresholds

Minimum voter turnout required for valid referendum:

| Referendum Type | Participation Threshold |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Transition (Phase 2→3) | 60% of eligible voters |
| End-State Selection | 65% of eligible voters |
| Ratification (Confederation) | 60% of eligible voters |
| Ratification (Federation) | 70% of eligible voters |
| Ratification (Dual-State) | 60% of eligible voters |

If participation threshold not met: referendum fails; may be re-scheduled after 12-month cooling-off period.

### 5.2 Approval Thresholds

Minimum support required for option to pass:

| Referendum Type | Approval Threshold |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Transition (Phase 2→3) | 60% of votes cast |
| End-State: Confederation | 55% of votes cast |
| End-State: Federation | 60% of votes cast |
| End-State: Dual-State | 55% of votes cast |
| End-State: Deliberate Dissolution | 60% of votes cast |
| Constitutional Ratification | 60% of votes cast |

### 5.3 Community Thresholds

Protection against one community imposing outcome on another:

**Minimum Community Support:** ≥ 40% support required in each major community

**Community Definition:**
- Israeli-origin CMS holders (regardless of current residence)
- Palestinian-origin CMS holders (regardless of current residence)
- Community affiliation determined by CMS registration

**If Community Threshold Not Met:**
- Referendum fails even if overall threshold met
- Result indicates need for further dialogue
- 12-month cooling-off period before re-vote

### 5.4 Threshold Rationale

| Threshold | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Participation | Ensures decision has legitimacy; prevents motivated minority from deciding |
| Approval | Ensures clear mandate; prevents bare majorities on fundamental questions |
| Community | Prevents demographic tyranny; ensures cross-community buy-in |

## 6. Multi-Option Referenda

### 6.1 When Used

Multi-option format used when:
- More than two options are viable
- Voters should express preferences among options
- Binary choice would artificially constrain options

### 6.2 Ranked Choice Procedure

**Ballot:**
- List all options (randomized order)
- Include "Status Quo" option (remain in Phase 2)
- Voter ranks options 1, 2, 3, etc. (partial ranking permitted)

**Counting:**

1. Count first-preference votes
2. If any option exceeds its approval threshold (see Section 5.2) → wins
3. If no option exceeds threshold → eliminate lowest option
4. Transfer eliminated option's votes to next preference
5. Repeat until one option exceeds threshold or only two options remain
6. **Final round with two options:**
   - If either option exceeds its required threshold → that option wins
   - If neither exceeds threshold → **referendum fails** (status quo prevails)

**Hard Threshold Requirement:** An option cannot win merely by having more votes in the final round; it must meet its specific approval threshold (55% for confederation/dual-state, 60% for federation/dissolution). This prevents implementing major constitutional changes without genuine supermajority support. A failed multi-option referendum triggers the 12-month cooling-off period per Section 5.1.

**Option-Specific Thresholds in Ranked-Choice:** Different end-states have different thresholds. In each round:

| Option | Required Threshold |
|--------|-------------------|
| Confederation | 55% of votes cast |
| Federation | 60% of votes cast |
| Dual-State | 55% of votes cast |
| Deliberate Dissolution | 60% of votes cast |
| Status Quo | None (wins only if all others fail) |

If the final two options have different thresholds (e.g., Federation vs Confederation), the higher-threshold option must meet its own threshold to win; it cannot win with only 56% against a lower-threshold option that also failed.

### 6.3 Tie-Breaking

If final round is exact tie and both options meet their thresholds:

1. Option with more first-preference votes wins
2. If still tied: option with more second-preference votes
3. If still tied: runoff election within 60 days

2. Investigation (no time limit; expedited as feasible)
3. If fraud proven affecting outcome → referendum annulled
4. New referendum scheduled after investigation complete
5. Criminal referral for individuals involved

### 7.4 Result Certification

**Preliminary Results:** Within 48 hours of poll closure

**Challenge Period:** 14 days from preliminary results

## 8. Failed Referendum Procedures

### 8.1 Threshold Not Met

If participation or approval threshold not met:
- Referendum fails; status quo continues
- 12-month cooling-off period before new referendum on same question
- No penalty for failure; Phase 2 continues normally
- Post-mortem analysis by Referendum Commission

### 8.2 Community Threshold Not Met

If overall threshold met but community threshold failed:
- Referendum fails despite overall approval
- Result indicates cross-community gap
- Mandatory dialogue period (6 months) before new attempt
- Modified proposals may be developed

### 8.3 Re-Vote Conditions

After cooling-off period, new referendum may be called if:
- Original conditions for referendum still met
- Confederal Council approves by supermajority
- Evidence of changed conditions or improved proposal
- JSVC certifies readiness

---

## 9. Minority Protections

### 9.1 Campaign Protections

- Minority positions guaranteed equal media access
- Security for minority position advocates
- Anti-intimidation protections apply to referendum activities
- Anonymous voting protects minority voters

### 9.2 Post-Referendum Protections

Regardless of referendum outcome:
- CRC protections remain in force
- CMS holders may exit without penalty
- Minority representation guaranteed in transition bodies
- Core rights require supermajority to modify

### 9.3 Exit Option

**Individual Exit:**
- CMS holders may renounce CMS within 180 days of certified result
- No penalty for exit
- Exit does not affect underlying citizenship
- Re-enrollment possible after 24 months

**Community Concerns:**

If majority of a community (>50%) votes against the winning option (i.e., the 40% community threshold was met but support was below 50%):

- Additional consultation with that community required before implementation
- Modified implementation may address specific concerns
- Guarantor involvement in transition monitoring
- Community representatives given enhanced voice in transition planning

**Rationale:** The 40% community threshold prevents majoritarian capture, but a winning option with only 40-49% support in one community indicates genuine concern. The consultation trigger applies only when a community's majority opposed the outcome, making it an exceptional measure rather than a routine requirement.

**Note:** If support in a community exceeds 50%, no additional consultation is required—the community has majority buy-in.
