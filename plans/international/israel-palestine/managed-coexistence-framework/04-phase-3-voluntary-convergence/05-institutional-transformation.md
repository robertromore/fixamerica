# Institutional Transformation Framework

**Parent Document:** [00-overview.md](00-overview.md)

**Applies To:** All Phase 3 end-state transitions

**Objective:** Define how MCF institutions evolve or sunset based on the chosen end state.

**Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Purpose

### 1.1 Transformation Necessity

MCF institutions were designed for conflict management, not permanent governance. Phase 3 transitions require these institutions to:
- Transform into permanent successor bodies, OR
- Merge into new governmental structures, OR
- Be dissolved with functions transferred elsewhere

### 1.2 Principles

**Continuity:** No gap in essential services during transformation

**Rights Protection:** CRC enforcement continues regardless of institutional form

**Staff Protection:** MCF personnel treated fairly during transition

**Knowledge Preservation:** Institutional memory and records maintained

**Gradual Transition:** Phased approach allows course correction

## 2. Institution-by-End State Matrix

### 2.1 Overview Matrix

| Institution | Confederation | Federation | Dual-State |
|-------------|--------------|------------|------------|
| JSVC | Permanent security body | Federal security agency | Joint bilateral committee |
| UVB | Verification office | Federal ombudsman | Bilateral observers |
| Confederal Council | Permanent council | Federal legislature | Dissolved |
| Commercial Courts | Confederal courts | Federal courts | Bilateral arbitration |
| CMS Registry | Permanent registry | Citizenship records | Archived |
| Guarantor Forum | Reduced role → dissolved | Observer → dissolved | Dissolved |
| MCF Secretariat | Confederal secretariat | Federal administration | Bilateral secretariat |
| CRC enforcement | Confederal body | Constitutional court | Treaty mechanism |

### 2.2 JSVC Transformation

**To Confederation:**
- Becomes Permanent Security Coordination Body
- Retains core verification functions
- Enhanced mandate for confederal security
- Community balance maintained
- International observers phased out

- Absorbed into Federal Security Agency
- Verification function becomes inspection role
- Personnel integrated into federal service
- Community balance through federal diversity
- International observers phased out

**To Dual-State:**
- Becomes Joint Security Committee
- Bilateral body with equal representation
- Coordination function only (no operational authority)
- Each state has own security apparatus
- Liaison offices in each capital

### 2.3 UVB Transformation

**To Confederation:**
- Becomes Confederal Verification Office
- Monitors compliance with confederal agreements
- Reports to Confederal Council
- Reduced international staff over time

**To Federation:**
- Absorbed into Federal Ombudsman Office
- Rights verification becomes ombudsman function
- Personnel integrated or transitioned
- Community balance in ombudsman staff

**To Dual-State:**
- Becomes Bilateral Monitoring Unit
- Small secretariat supporting joint observation
- Each state has own monitoring capacity
- Joint missions for treaty compliance

### 2.4 Confederal Council Transformation

**To Confederation:**
- Becomes Permanent Confederal Legislature
- Enhanced powers over confederal matters
- Formalized relationship to national legislatures
- Permanent secretariat and facilities

**To Federation:**
- Members may transition to federal legislature candidacy
- Institution dissolved when federal legislature convenes
- Records transferred to federal archives
- Secretariat absorbed into federal administration

**To Dual-State:**
- Institution dissolved
- Records archived in both states
- Secretariat personnel offered positions in successor bodies
- No direct successor institution

### 2.5 Commercial Courts Transformation

**To Confederation:**
- Become Permanent Confederal Courts
- Expanded jurisdiction over confederal economic matters
- Appeal to confederal judicial body
- Integration with national court systems

**To Federation:**
- Absorbed into Federal Court System
- Judges may be appointed to federal courts
- Cases transferred to federal courts
- Commercial expertise retained in specialized division

**To Dual-State:**
- Becomes Bilateral Commercial Arbitration
- Treaty-based jurisdiction
- Panel of arbitrators from both states
- Enforcement through domestic courts

### 2.6 CMS Registry Transformation

**To Confederation:**
- Becomes Permanent Confederal Status Registry
- CMS continues as permanent status
- Integration with national citizenship records
- Data protection continues

**To Federation:**
- Data transferred to Federal Citizenship Authority
- CMS status converted to federal citizenship records
- Historical records preserved
- Registry dissolved after transfer

**To Dual-State:**
- Records archived in both states
- CMS status discontinued
- Historical records available for reference
- Privacy protections continue for archived data

### 2.7 Guarantor Forum Transformation

**All End States:**
- Phased reduction of guarantor role
- Transition to bilateral diplomatic relations
- No permanent successor institution
- Treaty relationship replaces guarantor framework

**Timeline by End State:**

| End State | Active Monitoring | Advisory Role | Observer Only | Dissolution |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| Confederation | Years 1-5 | Years 5-10 | Years 10-15 | Year 15+ |
| Federation | Years 1-5 | Years 5-10 | Years 10-15 | Year 15+ |
| Dual-State | Years 1-2 | Years 2-3 | Years 3-4 | Year 5 |

**Dual-State Exception:** Because dual-state results in two fully independent states with bilateral treaty relationships (not an integrated governance structure), the Guarantor Forum winds down faster. Guarantors transition to normal diplomatic relations with each state. If parties request continued observation, guarantors may maintain a minimal treaty observer role beyond Year 5, but this is not a continuation of MCF authority.

## 3. Staff Transition

### 3.1 Principles

**No Involuntary Termination During Transition:**
- Staff retained through transformation period
- Positions in successor bodies offered
- Severance for those not continuing
- Priority hiring in related institutions

**Community Balance:**
- Successor bodies maintain community balance
- No demographic shift through transformation
- Both communities represented in transition planning

**Skills Preservation:**
- Critical skills identified and retained
- Knowledge transfer programs
- Documentation of institutional memory
- Training for new responsibilities

### 3.2 Transition Options for Staff

| Option | Description | Eligibility |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| Transfer | Move to successor institution | All staff in continuing functions |
| Secondment | Temporary assignment to new body | Skills match with new needs |
| Retraining | Training for new role | Staff with transferable skills |
| Early retirement | Enhanced pension for early departure | Staff near retirement age |
| Severance | Lump sum and transition support | Staff not continuing |

### 3.3 Severance Package

**Standard Severance:**
- 2 weeks salary per year of service
- Health coverage continuation (12 months)
- Career transition support
- Priority hiring in public sector

**Enhanced Severance (long-term staff):**
- 3 weeks salary per year of service
- Health coverage continuation (24 months)
- Pension enhancement
- Extended career support

### 3.4 Transition Timeline for Staff

| Phase | Duration | Activities |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Planning | 6 months | Skills inventory, successor structure design |
| Notification | 1 month | Individual consultation, option presentation |
| Decision | 3 months | Staff decisions, assignments made |
| Transfer | 12 months | Gradual move to successor positions |
| Completion | 3 months | Final transitions, documentation |

**Per-Unit Timeline:** The 25-month timeline above applies to each institutional unit undergoing transformation. For longer overall transformations (e.g., federation at 60-120 months), different units begin their transition cycles at staggered intervals. A unit begins its 25-month cycle when its successor body reaches "Formation" status (see Section 6.1). This prevents simultaneous disruption across all institutions while ensuring each unit has adequate transition time.

| Mid transition | Reduced scope | Expanding capacity |
| Late transition | Maintenance only | Full operation |
| Completion | Dissolved | Operating |

### 6.2 Service Continuity

**Essential Services:**
- Never interrupted during transition
- Clear responsibility at each phase
- Backup arrangements if needed
- Public communication about changes

**Non-Essential Services:**
- May be suspended during transition
- Restoration in successor body
- Notice to affected parties
- Alternative arrangements where possible

### 6.3 Decision Authority

**During Transition:**
- MCF decisions binding until successor authority
- Successor body decisions binding once authorized
- Conflict resolution through transition committee
- Guarantor involvement if needed

### 7.3 Dual-State Transformation

**Duration:** 24-48 months

**Key Milestones:**
1. Bilateral treaties ratified (Month 0)
2. Joint bodies established (Month 6)
3. CMS enrollment freeze—no new enrollments (Month 12)
4. SAZ transitions completed (Month 24)
5. MCF functions transferred (Month 30)
6. MCF formally dissolved (Month 36-48)
