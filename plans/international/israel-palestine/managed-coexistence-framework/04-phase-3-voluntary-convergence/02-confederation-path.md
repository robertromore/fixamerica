# Confederation Path

**Parent Document:** [00-overview.md](00-overview.md)

**Applies To:** Phase 3 end-state selection and implementation

**Objective:** Define the permanent confederation option where MCF institutions become fixtures alongside national governments.

**Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Definition

### 1.1 What Confederation Means

**Permanent Confederation:** MCF institutions become permanent fixtures of regional governance, operating **alongside** (not replacing) Israeli and Palestinian national governments.

Both national governments retain full sovereignty. The confederal layer provides:
- Shared security coordination
- Economic integration infrastructure
- Cross-community rights protection
- Dispute resolution mechanisms

### 1.2 Key Characteristics

| Dimension | Confederation Approach |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Sovereignty | Both states retain full sovereignty |
| Status | National citizenship + confederal status layer (not dual citizenship) |
| Territory | Existing territories unchanged; SAZs become permanent |
| Government | Three layers: national, confederal, SAZ |
| Military | Coordinated but separate national forces |
| Currency | Coordination; possibly shared or linked |

**Confederal Status (Not Citizenship):** Confederal status is an additional layer providing rights within the confederation (similar to EU citizenship) but does not create dual citizenship. National citizenship remains exclusive to each state; confederal status attaches to all CMS holders automatically and provides cross-community rights, not a second citizenship with separate obligations.

### 1.3 Comparison to Alternatives

| Feature | Confederation | Federation | Dual-State |
|---------|--------------|------------|------------|
| Sovereignty | Dual (retained) | Single (merged) | Separate |
| National armies | Yes | No | Yes |
| National foreign policy | Yes | No | Yes |
| Confederal layer | Permanent | Superseded | Bilateral only |
| Political merger | No | Yes | No |

## 2. Transition Requirements

### 2.1 Pre-Conditions

Before confederation path can be selected:

| Requirement | Verification |
|-------------|--------------|
| Phase 2 success criteria sustained 60+ months (per [Phase 3 Overview](00-overview.md#entry-requirements)) | JSVC certification |
| All MCF institutions fully operational | Institutional audit |
| CMS enrollment stable or growing | CMS Registry data |
| Cross-community economic integration functional | Economic indicators |
| Guarantor endorsement | Formal statement |

**Note:** The 60+ month requirement is the minimum for Phase 3 entry eligibility. Confederation does not have a higher duration threshold than other end-state options; all paths share the same entry requirements per the Phase 3 Overview.

### 2.2 Referendum Approval

**Stage 1: Entry Referendum**
- Approve Phase 3 entry (general)
- Thresholds per [01-referenda-procedures.md](01-referenda-procedures.md)

**Stage 2: End-State Referendum**
- Choose confederation among options
- 65% participation threshold
- 55% approval threshold
- 40% community threshold in each community

**Stage 3: Charter Ratification**
- Approve specific confederal charter text
- 60% participation threshold
- 60% approval threshold
- 40% community threshold

### 2.3 Governmental Agreement

Confederation requires formal agreement from both party governments:

**Israeli Government:**
- Knesset approval of confederal charter
- Constitutional/Basic Law amendments if required
- Treaty ratification procedures

**Palestinian Government:**
- PLC approval (or successor legislature)
- Constitutional amendments if required
- Executive endorsement

**Timeline:** Government approvals occur **after** charter ratification referendum passes (see Section 4.3 Adoption sequence: steps 5-6). This ensures governments approve a charter that has already received popular mandate, preventing scenarios where governments block a popularly-approved charter or approve a charter later rejected by referendum.

### 2.4 Guarantor Endorsement

Guarantors must:
- Certify that confederal charter protects CRC rights
- Commit to transition monitoring role
- Endorse confederal institutions as successor to MCF
- Agree to phased withdrawal timeline (10-year default)

---

## 3. Confederal Institutions

### 3.1 Confederal Council (Permanent)

**Evolution from MCF Confederal Council:**
- Permanent status formalized in charter
- Enhanced authority over confederal matters
- Clearer separation from national legislatures

**Composition:**
- Equal representation from both communities
- Proportional within each community's delegation
- Fixed terms with staggered renewal

**Powers:**
- Legislation on confederal matters
- Budget approval for confederal institutions
- Treaty ratification for confederal agreements
- Oversight of confederal executive

**Decision-Making:**
- Ordinary matters: simple majority
- Significant matters: 60% supermajority
- Fundamental matters: 2/3 + dual-community majority

### 3.2 Confederal Executive

**Structure:**
- Co-Presidents (one from each community)
- Rotating chair (annual)
- Joint decision-making on all matters
- Veto by either requires Council resolution

**Functions:**
- Implementation of confederal legislation
- Representation of confederation externally
- Coordination of confederal agencies
- Emergency response coordination

**Appointments:**
- Selected by Confederal Council supermajority
- 5-year terms; renewable once
- Removal requires 2/3 Council vote

### 3.3 Confederal Judicial Body

**Evolution from MCF Dispute Resolution:**
- Permanent confederal court
- Jurisdiction over confederal law
- Rights enforcement under CRC/charter
- Dispute resolution between communities

**Composition:**
- Parity representation: equal judges from each community
- Plus international judges (3) for tie-breaking and credibility
- 10-year terms; staggered renewal
- Independent appointments commission

**Jurisdiction:**

- Confederal charter interpretation
- Inter-community disputes
- Appeals from SAZ tribunals on confederal law matters (see appeal chain clarification below)
- Review of national laws for confederal compliance

**Appeal Chain Clarification (preserving Phase 2 structure):**

The Confederal Judicial Body does **not** replace the CRC Review Panel for CRC rights matters. The Phase 2 appeal chain continues:

| Matter Type | Appeal Chain |
|-------------|--------------|
| **CRC rights** | SAZ courts → CRC Review Panel → Confederal Judicial Body (only after CRC Review Panel exhaustion) |
| **Confederal charter/law** | SAZ courts → Confederal Judicial Body (direct) |
| **Constitutional Floor** | SAZ courts → Confederal Judicial Body (direct) |
| **Inter-community disputes** | Confederal Judicial Body (original jurisdiction) |

The CRC Review Panel continues as the primary forum for CRC interpretation. The Confederal Judicial Body handles confederal charter interpretation and serves as final appellate authority after CRC Review Panel exhaustion for CRC matters. This preserves institutional continuity and specialized CRC expertise while adding confederal charter jurisdiction.

### 3.4 Confederal Agencies

| Agency | Function | Evolution From |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| Security Coordination | Joint security operations, intelligence sharing | JSVC |
| Verification Unit | Monitoring, compliance verification | UVB |
| Economic Integration | Trade, labor, commercial courts | MCF economic institutions |
| Rights Commission | Anti-discrimination, rights monitoring | CRC enforcement bodies |
| Environmental Authority | Shared environmental governance | Environmental cooperation bodies |

2. Confederal law prevails within confederal competencies
3. National law prevails within national competencies
4. Shared competencies: proportionality analysis
5. Appeal to international arbitration if unresolved

### 5.3 National Sovereignty Preservation

Confederation explicitly preserves:
- National foreign ministry and embassies

## 6. Funding and Fiscal Arrangements

### 6.1 Confederal Budget

**Revenue Sources:**
- Contributions from national governments (formula-based)
- Confederal fees and charges
- SAZ taxation (portion allocated to confederal level)
- Endowment income (MCF endowment becomes confederal)
- International grants (during transition)

**Contribution Formula:**
- Base: Equal contribution from each national government
- Adjustment: GDP-weighted for economic capacity
- Floor: Minimum to sustain core institutions
- Ceiling: Maximum to prevent dependence

### 6.2 Fiscal Coordination

**Coordination Mechanisms:**
- Confederal Finance Committee
- Annual budget negotiation
- Multi-year financial framework (5 years)
- Independent audit of confederal finances

**National Fiscal Autonomy:**
- National governments retain taxation authority
- No confederal income tax on individuals
- Trade taxation coordinated but not merged
- Capital markets remain nationally regulated

### 6.3 SAZ Fiscal Arrangements

SAZs under confederation:
- Retain local taxation authority
- Contribute to confederal budget (formula)
- Receive confederal transfers (if net recipients)
- Financial relationship with national governments (negotiated)
