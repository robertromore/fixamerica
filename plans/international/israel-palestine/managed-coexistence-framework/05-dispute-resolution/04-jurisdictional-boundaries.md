# Jurisdictional Boundaries and Excluded Matters

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#dispute-resolution-mechanics)

**Phase:** All Phases

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## Purpose

Jurisdictional Boundaries define **what MCF dispute resolution can and cannot address**. These limits prevent dispute mechanisms from becoming sovereignty battlegrounds while ensuring credible, bounded dispute resolution.

Strict jurisdictional limits are essential to MCF's conflict-management function. Without them, dispute resolution would inevitably expand into territory adjudication, sovereignty claims, and political warfare—destroying the framework's utility.

---

## Foundational Principle: Non-Prejudice

### The Non-Prejudice Rule

**No dispute resolution outcome may be used to assert or deny sovereignty, territorial claims, or final-status rights.**

This rule is absolute and applies across all MCF dispute mechanisms.

### What Non-Prejudice Means

**MCF proceedings cannot establish:**
- Territorial sovereignty
- Boundary legitimacy
- State recognition
- Population sovereignty
- Resource ownership
- Final political status

**MCF proceedings cannot deny:**
- Existing sovereignty claims
- Prior rights
- Legal positions
- Political aspirations
- Historical claims

### How Non-Prejudice Is Implemented

**Procedural safeguards:**
- Explicit non-prejudice statements in all determinations
- Prohibition on sovereignty-adjacent reasoning
- Review for prejudice violations
- Determination invalidation if prejudice found

**Substantive limits:**
- Excluded subject matters (below)
- Jurisdictional screening
- Scope limitations in proceedings

**Interpretive rules:**
- Ambiguous matters resolved toward non-prejudice
- Narrow construction of jurisdiction
- Deference to political processes for political questions

---

## Excluded Subject Matters

### 1. Criminal Matters

**Excluded:**
- Criminal prosecution
- Criminal investigation
- Criminal penalties
- Criminal procedural matters

**Rationale:**
- MCF lacks enforcement capacity for criminal law
- Criminal jurisdiction is sovereign function
- Due process requirements exceed MCF capacity
- International criminal law provides external mechanisms

**Where Criminal Matters Go:**
- National criminal courts
- International Criminal Court (where applicable)
- International humanitarian law mechanisms
- National prosecution services

**MCF Role:**
- Documentation and preservation
- Referral to appropriate authorities
- Witness protection support (where possible)
- No adjudication

### 2. Security Operations

**Excluded:**
- Military operational decisions
- Security force deployments
- Intelligence operations
- Counter-terrorism actions
- Armed response decisions

**Rationale:**
- Security operations require operational autonomy
- Judicial review inappropriate for military decisions
- Separate security accountability mechanisms exist
- MCF civilian dispute resolution not designed for security matters

**Where Security Matters Go:**
- Security protocols (separate process)
- Military justice systems
- International humanitarian law
- Guarantor security oversight

**MCF Role:**
- Civilian consequence complaints (to review panels)
- Documentation of civilian impact
- Coordination with security mechanisms
- No operational adjudication

### 3. Military Conduct

**Excluded:**
- Laws of armed conflict compliance
- Military discipline
- Command decisions
- Armed conflict conduct

**Rationale:**
- International humanitarian law governs
- Military justice systems apply
- MCF civilian framework inappropriate
- Expertise and authority limitations

**Where Military Matters Go:**
- Military courts
- International humanitarian law mechanisms
- ICC (where applicable)
- National military justice

**MCF Role:**
- Civilian protection documentation
- Referral to appropriate mechanisms
- No adjudication of military conduct

### 4. Sovereignty Claims

**Excluded:**
- Territorial sovereignty disputes
- State recognition questions
- Self-determination claims
- National identity determinations
- Political status questions

**Rationale:**
- Sovereignty is political question
- MCF designed to operate without resolving sovereignty
- Resolution would collapse framework
- Parties retain sovereign claims unaffected

**Where Sovereignty Matters Go:**
- Political negotiations
- International diplomatic processes
- Parties' own political processes
- Future final-status resolution

**MCF Role:**
- Operates alongside unresolved sovereignty
- No prejudice to any position
- Preserves all claims intact

### 5. Territorial Boundaries

**Excluded:**
- Border demarcation
- Boundary disputes
- Territorial allocation
- Land ownership (as sovereignty question)

**Rationale:**
- Boundaries are sovereignty questions
- Adjudication would prejudice final status
- MCF operates across boundaries, not on them
- Political resolution required

**MCF Role:**
- Operational arrangements that don't prejudice boundaries
- Functional cooperation across boundaries
- No boundary adjudication

### 6. Jerusalem Status

**Excluded:**
- Jerusalem sovereignty
- Holy site control
- Jerusalem governance
- Jerusalem boundary questions

**Rationale:**
- Explicitly excluded from MCF institutional authority
- Most sensitive final-status issue
- Any MCF involvement would be framework-collapsing
- Requires dedicated political process

**MCF Role:**
- May operate programs in Jerusalem (separate provisions)
- No governance or adjudication authority
- Explicit exclusion in all dispute mechanisms

### 7. Refugee Final Status

**Excluded:**
- Right of return adjudication
- Refugee compensation determination
- Refugee political status
- Refugee resettlement rights

**Rationale:**
- Final-status issue requiring political resolution
- MCF not designed to resolve refugee question
- Adjudication would prejudice negotiations
- Parties retain positions on refugee rights

**MCF Role:**
- Refugee participation in CMS (voluntary)
- Service provision to refugees (humanitarian)
- No adjudication of final-status rights

### 8. Religious Authority

**Excluded:**
- Religious site control
- Religious law interpretation
- Religious community governance
- Inter-religious disputes (theological)

**Rationale:**
- Religious authority outside MCF mandate
- Highly sensitive to all communities
- Existing religious authority structures
- MCF secular framework inappropriate

**MCF Role:**
- Protection of religious freedom (CRC)
- Access facilitation (operational)
- No religious authority adjudication
