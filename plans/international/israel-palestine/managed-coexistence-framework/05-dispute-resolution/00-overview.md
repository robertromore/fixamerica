# Dispute Resolution Mechanics: Overview

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#dispute-resolution-mechanics)

**Applies To:** All Phases

**Objective:** Provide credible, predictable dispute resolution without allowing disputes to become sovereignty battlegrounds or mechanisms for political capture.

---

## Purpose of This Section

This directory contains detailed implementation documents for MCF dispute resolution mechanisms. Dispute resolution is treated as a **core stabilizing function**, not a peripheral service.

The fundamental design principle is **containment without absorption**: resolve disputes within the smallest competent forum, apply remedies that stabilize participation, and export unresolved legal or political questions to external systems rather than absorbing them.

## Key Components

| Component | Document | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Arbitration Courts | [01-arbitration-courts.md](01-arbitration-courts.md) | Individual-to-individual dispute resolution |
| Review Panels | [02-review-panels.md](02-review-panels.md) | Individual-to-authority grievance mechanisms |
| Institutional Disputes | [03-institutional-disputes.md](03-institutional-disputes.md) | Institution-to-institution conflict resolution |
| Jurisdictional Boundaries | [04-jurisdictional-boundaries.md](04-jurisdictional-boundaries.md) | Scope limits and excluded matters |

## Three Categories of Disputes

MCF differentiates between three categories of disputes, each handled through distinct but interoperable mechanisms:

### 1. Individual–Individual Disputes

**Examples:** Commercial conflicts, labor disagreements, contractual breaches, CMS-related conduct issues.

**Mechanism:** Confederal arbitration courts—civil, non-criminal bodies with standardized procedural codes.

**Jurisdiction:** Voluntary, benefit-linked. Participants opt-in by participating in CMS or Framework programs.

**Enforcement:** Within MCF benefit scope only (contract enforcement, credential suspension, access revocation).

### 2. Individual–Authority Disputes

**Examples:** Discrimination allegations, procedural abuse, wrongful PCC exclusion, CMS revocation.

**Mechanism:** Review-and-remedy model through independent review panels operating under the Confederal Rights Compact.

**Jurisdiction:** Framework procedures and rights guarantees. Does not invalidate national laws or sovereign acts.

**Enforcement:** Framework-internal remedies (reinstatement, record correction, compensation, guarantor referral).

### 3. Institution–Institution Disputes

**Examples:** Disagreements between JSVC units, host states, guarantors, SAZ administrators.

**Mechanism:** Tiered mediation and certification process, escalating to guarantor review panels if unresolved.

**Jurisdiction:** Mandate interpretation, procedural compliance, trigger certifications.

**Enforcement:** Binding procedural clarifications, mandate adjustments. No sovereignty adjudication.

## Core Principles

### 1. Non-Prejudice Rule

No dispute resolution outcome may be used to assert or deny sovereignty, territorial claims, or final-status rights.

This is the most fundamental constraint on MCF dispute resolution. It ensures that:
- Participating in arbitration does not create legal precedent for territorial claims
- Review panel findings cannot be cited to establish sovereignty
- Institutional dispute outcomes do not prejudice political negotiations

### 2. Containment Without Absorption

MCF resolves disputes by:
- **Containing them within the smallest competent forum**
- **Applying remedies that stabilize participation** rather than punish identity
- **Exporting unresolved legal or political questions** to external systems

This prevents dispute resolution from becoming a proxy battlefield.

### 3. Graduated and Reversible Resolution

- Sanctions and remedies escalate only with repeated non-compliance
- Good-faith correction restores standing
- First-time procedural errors do not trigger punitive responses

### 4. Forum Integrity

Strict jurisdictional limits prevent:
- Forum shopping (seeking favorable venues)
- Politicization (using disputes for political warfare)
- Scope creep (quiet expansion into sovereignty adjudication)

## Excluded Matters

MCF dispute resolution explicitly excludes:

| Category | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Criminal matters | National jurisdiction; MCF lacks enforcement capacity |
| Security operations | Handled by security protocols, not civil dispute mechanisms |
| Military conduct | International humanitarian law; outside MCF competence |
| Sovereignty claims | Final-status issues reserved for political negotiation |
| Territorial boundaries | Non-prejudice rule prohibits adjudication |
| Jerusalem status | Explicitly excluded from MCF institutional authority |
| Refugee final status | Political question beyond MCF mandate |

---

## Interoperability

Dispute resolution mechanisms are designed to interoperate:

**Escalation paths:**
- Arbitration court → Review panel (if authority conduct implicated)
- Review panel → Guarantor review (if systemic issues identified)
- Institutional dispute → Guarantor review panel (if mediation fails)

**Information sharing:**
- Findings documented and preserved
- Cross-referral for related matters
- Unified records system

**External coordination:**
- Recognition agreements with domestic courts where applicable
- Documentation transmitted to international bodies for accountability
- Preserves external legal options without claiming superior authority

---

## Relationship to Other Components

### JSVC/UVB
- Verification findings may inform dispute proceedings
- Dispute resolution cannot override verification conclusions
- Verification bodies not parties to disputes about their findings (separate review process)

### CMS
- CMS participation conditions include arbitration opt-in
- CMS revocation subject to review panel process
- Dispute outcomes may affect CMS standing

### SAZ Governance
- SAZ courts handle internal SAZ disputes
- Appeals may go to confederal mechanisms
- Institutional disputes involving SAZ administrators follow institutional process

### Confederal Rights Compact
- CRC violations trigger review panel jurisdiction
- Guarantors may be involved in CRC enforcement
- Dispute resolution implements CRC procedural guarantees

### Guarantors
- Guarantor review panels adjudicate escalated institutional disputes
- Guarantors enforce dispute outcomes where MCF capacity insufficient
- Guarantors themselves subject to dispute mechanisms (with recusal rules)

---

## Design Rationale

### Why Not National Courts?

National courts cannot provide:
- Neutral venue for cross-jurisdictional disputes
- Predictable procedures across different legal systems
- Enforcement across community boundaries
- Protection from politicized adjudication

MCF arbitration offers what national courts cannot in a contested environment.

### Why Not International Courts?

International courts are:
- Too distant for routine dispute resolution
- Overwhelmed with existing caseloads
- Designed for state-level disputes, not individual conflicts
- Expensive and time-consuming

MCF mechanisms handle the volume and immediacy that international courts cannot.

### Why Such Strict Limits?

Overly broad dispute resolution would:
- Become a sovereignty battleground
- Attract political capture attempts
- Create precedents that prejudice negotiations
- Undermine the non-resolution premise of MCF

Strict limits preserve MCF's conflict-management function.
