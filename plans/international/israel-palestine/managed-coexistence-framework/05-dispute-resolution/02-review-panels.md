# Independent Review Panels

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#dispute-resolution-mechanics)

**Phase:** All Phases

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## Purpose

Independent Review Panels handle **disputes between individuals and authorities**—allegations of discrimination, procedural abuse, wrongful exclusion, or CMS revocation.

The review-and-remedy model does not claim authority over sovereign acts. It determines whether Framework procedures and rights guarantees were followed and provides Framework-internal remedies. This preserves individual protection without creating a parallel government claiming superior legal authority.

---

## Review Panel Principles

### 1. Review, Not Adjudication of Sovereignty

Review panels do not:
- Invalidate national laws
- Override sovereign orders
- Declare government acts unlawful
- Impose external authority on states

Review panels do:
- Determine whether MCF procedures were followed
- Assess compliance with Confederal Rights Compact
- Provide Framework-internal remedies
- Document violations for external accountability

### 2. Rights-Based Framework

Review is anchored in the Confederal Rights Compact (CRC):
- Due process guarantees
- Non-discrimination standards
- Procedural fairness requirements
- Participation protection

CRC violations trigger review panel jurisdiction.

### 3. Remedial Focus

The goal is remedy, not punishment:
- Restore access that was wrongly denied
- Correct records that are inaccurate
- Compensate harm from procedural failures
- Refer systemic issues for broader action

Remedies stabilize participation rather than punish actors.

### 4. Independence and Neutrality

Review panels are:
- Structurally independent from authorities subject to review
- Staffed by qualified professionals
- Subject to conflict-of-interest rules
- Protected from political interference

Independence ensures credible review.

## Panel Structure

### 1. Panel Composition

**Standard Panel:**
- Three reviewers
- Community balance (one from each major community, one neutral/international)
- Professional qualifications required
- Rotating composition from qualified pool

**Specialized Panels:**

- CMS Review Panel (CMS revocation, suspension, credential disputes—post-grant actions only; see Section 2.3 for denial vs. process complaint distinction)
- Employment panel (authority as employer)
- Security-civilian panel (security-related complaints)
- Data/Privacy Panel (data access, correction, deletion requests; appeals of data retention decisions; privacy complaints per [Data/IT Systems Section 3](../08-operational-procedures/09-data-it-systems.md))

**Data/Privacy Panel Scope:** This panel handles individual data-rights appeals including: denied access requests, disputed correction requests, refused deletion requests (where deletion rights apply), complaints about unauthorized data use, and appeals of data retention classifications. The panel may order access, correction, or annotation but cannot order deletion of accountability records exempt under Data/IT Systems Section 3. Appeals from Data/Privacy Panel decisions follow the standard Review Panel appellate path (see Section 7.2).

**Security-Civilian Panel Scope:** This panel handles complaints about security personnel conduct toward civilians (misconduct, procedural violations, discrimination, excessive force claims). It does not review security operational decisions (deployment, tactics, threat assessments). The distinction: *how* security personnel treated an individual (reviewable) versus *whether* to conduct a security operation (not reviewable). Complaints about operational decisions are excluded per Section 3 ("Excluded Complaints").

### 2. Reviewer Qualifications

**Required:**
- Legal or human rights training
- 7+ years relevant professional experience
- Human rights adjudication experience
- Language proficiency (Arabic, Hebrew, English)
- No current employment by authority under review

**Preferred:**
- Administrative law expertise
- International human rights experience
- Dispute resolution training
- Government oversight experience

### 3. Reviewer Pool

**Pool Composition:**
- Minimum 20 qualified reviewers
- Community balance maintained
- International representation
- Specialty coverage

**Pool Administration:**
- MCF Secretariat maintains pool
- Annual qualification verification
- Performance evaluation
- Removal for cause

### 4. Administrative Support

**Secretariat Functions:**
- Complaint intake
- Panel assignment
- Investigation support
- Record keeping
- Decision publication
- Remedy implementation tracking

## Jurisdiction

### 1. Complaints Against Authorities

**Which Authorities:**
- MCF institutions (JSVC, UVB, Secretariat)
- SAZ administrations
- CMS administration
- Guarantor operations (in MCF capacity)
- National authorities implementing MCF procedures

**Note:** Complaints against national authorities are limited to MCF-related conduct, not general government activity.

### 2. Types of Complaints

#### 2.1 Discrimination

**Covered:**
- Community-based discrimination in MCF programs
- Religious discrimination in access
- Political discrimination (based on political views)
- Gender discrimination in MCF contexts

**Standard:**
- Differential treatment without legitimate basis
- Pattern or practice evidence
- Individual instances if sufficiently severe

#### 2.2 Procedural Abuse

**Covered:**
- Denial of due process in MCF procedures
- Arbitrary decision-making
- Failure to follow published procedures

#### 2.3 Wrongful Exclusion

**Covered:**

- Program exclusion without justification (non-CMS programs)
- Benefit denial contrary to eligibility
- PCC (Personal Conduct Code) exclusion without proper process

**CMS Application Denials:** CMS application rejections are handled through the CMS Appeals Board per [CMS Framework](../02-phase-1-civic-membership/01-cms-framework.md), not through Review Panels. However, Review Panels retain jurisdiction over *process complaints* about CMS application handling (e.g., discrimination by vetting staff, procedural abuse during application review). The distinction: challenging the *denial decision* → CMS Appeals Board; challenging *how* the application was processed → Review Panel.

**Standard:**

- Complainant met eligibility criteria
- Exclusion lacked procedural basis
- No legitimate security or conduct justification

#### 2.4 CMS Revocation

**Covered:**
- Revocation without proper process
- Revocation based on impermissible grounds
- Failure to provide appeal opportunity
- Factual errors in revocation basis

**Standard:**
- Procedural requirements not followed
- Grounds not within permitted categories
- Appeal rights not afforded

### 3. Excluded Complaints

**Outside Jurisdiction:**

- Criminal allegations (national/international jurisdiction)
- General government conduct (not MCF-related)
- Security operations decisions (deployment, tactics, threat assessments—see Section 1 "Security-Civilian Panel Scope" for the conduct/operations distinction)
- Disputes between individuals (arbitration courts)
- Sovereignty or territorial claims
- Final status matters
