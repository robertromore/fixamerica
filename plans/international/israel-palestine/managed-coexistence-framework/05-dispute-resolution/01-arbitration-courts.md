# Confederal Arbitration Courts

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#dispute-resolution-mechanics)

**Phase:** All Phases

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## Purpose

Confederal Arbitration Courts provide **neutral, predictable dispute resolution** for conflicts between individuals participating in MCF programs.

Arbitration does not replace national courts. It offers a venue where cross-jurisdictional disputes would otherwise be unresolvable—where different legal systems, different enforcement mechanisms, and different political loyalties make national courts inadequate for disputes crossing community boundaries.

---

## Arbitration Principles

### 1. Civil, Non-Criminal Jurisdiction

Arbitration courts handle civil matters only:
- Commercial disputes
- Contractual conflicts
- Labor disagreements
- Property disputes
- CMS-related conduct issues

Criminal matters remain outside MCF jurisdiction.

### 2. Voluntary, Benefit-Linked Participation

Arbitration is opt-in:
- Participation linked to CMS membership or program enrollment
- Opting in is a condition of certain Framework benefits
- Parties choose arbitration; it is not imposed

This voluntary character preserves sovereignty while providing dispute resolution access.

### 3. Procedural Neutrality

Arbitration procedures are:
- Standardized across all cases
- Anchored in due process principles
- Transparent in evidence handling
- Equal in access regardless of community

No procedural advantage for either party based on identity.

### 4. Limited Enforcement

Enforcement is limited to MCF benefit scope:
- Contract enforcement within Framework
- Credential suspension
- Access revocation
- Benefit withholding

Arbitration cannot enforce beyond MCF's own authority.
