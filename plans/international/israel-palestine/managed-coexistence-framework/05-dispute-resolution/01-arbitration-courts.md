# Confederal Arbitration Courts

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#dispute-resolution-mechanics)

**Phase:** All Phases

**Status:** Draft

## Purpose

Confederal Arbitration Courts provide **neutral, predictable dispute resolution** for conflicts between individuals participating in MCF programs.

Arbitration does not replace national courts. It offers a venue where cross-jurisdictional disputes would otherwise be unresolvable—where different legal systems, different enforcement mechanisms, and different political loyalties make national courts inadequate for disputes crossing community boundaries.

---

## Arbitration Principles

### 1. Civil, Non-Criminal Jurisdiction

Arbitration courts handle civil matters only:
- Commercial disputes
- Contractual conflicts
- Labor disagreements
- Property disputes
- CMS-related conduct issues

Criminal matters remain outside MCF jurisdiction.

### 1.1 Relationship to Commercial Courts

**Forum Priority:** For commercial disputes and labor disputes within [Confederal Commercial Court](../07-economic-architecture/03-commercial-courts.md) jurisdiction, Commercial Courts are the primary forum unless parties explicitly agree to arbitration.

**When Arbitration Applies:**

| Scenario | Forum |
|----------|-------|
| Parties' contract specifies arbitration | Arbitration |
| Parties' contract specifies Commercial Court or is silent | Commercial Court |
| Dispute involves MCF-registered employer labor claim | Commercial Court (primary) |
| Dispute involves CMS-related conduct or credentials | Arbitration (unless CMS revocation—see Review Panels) |
| Property disputes between participants | Arbitration |
| Parties mutually agree to arbitrate after dispute arises | Arbitration |

**Rationale:** Commercial Courts provide full adjudicative procedures with appellate review and detailed choice-of-law rules. Arbitration provides flexibility for parties who prefer it, and serves as the forum for dispute categories outside Commercial Court scope.

### 2. Voluntary, Benefit-Linked Participation

Arbitration access is linked to CMS membership or program enrollment, but use of arbitration requires explicit agreement:

- CMS membership provides *eligibility* for arbitration, not automatic submission
- For commercial and labor disputes within [Commercial Court](../07-economic-architecture/03-commercial-courts.md) jurisdiction, Commercial Courts are primary unless parties explicitly agree to arbitrate (per Section 1.1)
- Explicit arbitration agreement means: contract clause specifying arbitration, or mutual post-dispute agreement to arbitrate
- CMS enrollment alone does not constitute an arbitration agreement for commercial/labor matters

This preserves CCC primacy while ensuring arbitration remains available for disputes outside Commercial Court scope or where parties prefer it.

### 3. Procedural Neutrality

Arbitration procedures are:
- Standardized across all cases
- Anchored in due process principles
- Transparent in evidence handling
- Equal in access regardless of community

No procedural advantage for either party based on identity.

### 4. Limited Enforcement

Enforcement is limited to MCF benefit scope:

- Contract enforcement within Framework
- Program access revocation
- Benefit withholding
- CMS credential actions (suspension, notation, revocation) → referred to CMS Review Panel; arbitration recommends, Review Panel decides

Arbitration cannot enforce beyond MCF's own authority.

## Choice of Law

### 1. Applicable Law Hierarchy

Arbitration adopts the same choice-of-law hierarchy as [Confederal Commercial Courts](../07-economic-architecture/03-commercial-courts.md#5-choice-of-law):

| Priority | Source | Application |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **1** | MCF Commercial Code | Where MCF has specific rules |
| **2** | Party agreement | Contract choice of law clause |
| **3** | Closest connection | Law of jurisdiction with closest connection |
| **4** | International commercial law | CISG, UNIDROIT Principles as gap-filler |

### 2. Application in Arbitration

**Party Autonomy:** Parties may specify applicable law in their arbitration agreement. Absent such specification, arbitrators apply the hierarchy above.

**MCF Rules Primary:** For disputes arising from MCF programs (CMS, SAZ, labor mobility), MCF rules apply as primary source regardless of party choice.

**Legal Conclusions in Awards:** Awards that include legal conclusions (per Procedures Section 4, "Decision and Award") must identify the applicable law applied. Appeals for "manifest error of law" are assessed against the correct source in the hierarchy.

## Enforcement

Arbitration may recommend CMS credential actions as part of an award, but implementation authority rests with [CMS Review Panel](02-review-panels.md). Review Panel considers arbitration award as binding on facts but retains discretion on proportionality of credential action.
