# Institution-to-Institution Dispute Resolution

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#dispute-resolution-mechanics)

**Phase:** All Phases

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## Purpose

Institution-to-Institution Dispute Resolution handles **conflicts between MCF institutions**—disagreements between JSVC units, host states, guarantors, SAZ administrators, and other Framework bodies.

The tiered mediation and certification process prevents institutional disputes from paralyzing MCF operations while respecting the distinct mandates and authorities of different institutions.

---

## Institutional Dispute Principles

### 1. Operational Continuity Priority

Disputes must not halt MCF operations:
- Interim arrangements during resolution
- Essential functions continue
- Deadlines for resolution
- Default positions if unresolved

### 2. Mandate Respect

Each institution has legitimate authority:
- Disputes involve mandate interpretation
- No institution claims superior authority over others
- Resolution clarifies boundaries
- Autonomy within mandates preserved

### 3. No Sovereignty Adjudication

Institutional disputes cannot:
- Determine territorial sovereignty
- Establish political claims
- Prejudice final status
- Create legal precedent for sovereignty

### 4. Collective Interest

Resolution serves MCF as a whole:
- Not zero-sum between institutions
- Framework success is shared goal
- Compromise orientation
- Creative solutions encouraged
