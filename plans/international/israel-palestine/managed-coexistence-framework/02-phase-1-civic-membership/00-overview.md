## Purpose of This Section

This directory contains detailed implementation documents for the Civic Membership Status (CMS) system and supporting institutions established during Phase 1. Phase 1 introduces **voluntary individual participation** while preserving existing sovereignty structures.

Phase 1 does not require territorial change, national identity transformation, or mutual governmental agreement. It operates through individual opt-in choices protected by institutional safeguards.
