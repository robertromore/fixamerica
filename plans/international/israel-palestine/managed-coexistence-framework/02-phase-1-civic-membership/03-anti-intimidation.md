# Anti-Intimidation Architecture

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#phase-1-years-520-opt-in-civic-membership-without-territorial-change)

**Phase:** Phase 1 onwards (begins with CMS implementation)

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## Purpose

The Anti-Intimidation Architecture protects individuals who choose to participate in MCF from retaliation by their own communities, employers, or authorities. Without such protection, CMS would attract only those who have nothing to lose—excluding the very populations whose participation could build a constituency for coexistence.

This architecture addresses the reality that participation in cross-community programs is often more dangerous from "your own side" than from the adversary. Social pressure, economic retaliation, and violence against "collaborators" or "normalizers" has historically undermined peace-building initiatives.

---

## Core Principle: Protection Without Exposure

Effective anti-intimidation requires a paradox: providing protection that does not itself become a source of exposure. MCF addresses this through:

- **Layered confidentiality**: Information shared only on need-to-know basis
- **Distributed reporting**: Multiple channels so no single point reveals participation
- **Graduated response**: Protection scales with threat severity
- **Community alternatives**: Exit pathways that do not require abandoning community entirely

The goal is not to make participation invisible—that would undermine CMS legitimacy—but to raise the cost of intimidation while providing genuine protection when it occurs.

## 1. Threat Landscape

### 1.1 Categories of Intimidation

| Category | Description | Severity | Prevalence |
|----------|-------------|----------|------------|
| **Social Ostracism** | Exclusion from community, family rejection, reputation damage | Variable | High |
| **Economic Retaliation** | Job loss, business boycott, denial of services | Medium-High | High |
| **Legal Harassment** | Frivolous charges, bureaucratic obstruction, selective enforcement | Medium | Medium |
| **Physical Threats** | Verbal threats, property damage, stalking | High | Medium |
| **Violence** | Assault, attacks on family, murder | Extreme | Low but catastrophic |

### 1.2 Sources of Intimidation

**Community-Based Sources:**

- Social networks and extended families
- Religious institutions
- Neighborhood associations
- Social media groups

**Organized Sources:**

- Political factions and parties
- Militant organizations
- Criminal networks
- Vigilante groups

**Institutional Sources:**

- Employers and businesses
- Educational institutions
- Government agencies
- Security services (of either party)

### 1.3 Vulnerable Populations

Some populations face heightened intimidation risk and require additional protections:

| Population | Specific Vulnerabilities | Additional Considerations |
|------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Women** | Family law constraints, honor-based retaliation, limited economic independence | Gender-sensitive response protocols |
| **Youth** | Parental/family control, educational dependence, social media exposure | Age-appropriate consent, guardian considerations |
| **LGBTQ+** | Criminalization risk, social rejection, limited asylum options | Confidentiality paramount, external relocation options |
| **Economic Dependents** | Unable to absorb economic retaliation | Economic support mechanisms |
| **Public Figures** | High visibility makes protection difficult | Different protection model (deterrence vs. concealment) |
| **Former Security Personnel** | "Traitor" framing, detailed personal information known | Enhanced security protocols |

---

## 2. Confidentiality Framework

### 2.1 Information Classification

| Level | Description | Access |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **Public** | CMS holder chooses to be publicly known | Unrestricted |
| **Standard** | CMS status known to MCF institutions | MCF staff with need-to-know |
| **Protected** | CMS status confidential even within MCF | Designated protection officers only |
| **Maximum** | Identity protected, participation through alias | Single case manager only |

### 2.2 Default Settings

- New CMS holders default to **Standard** confidentiality
- Holders may request **Protected** or **Maximum** with justification
- Downgrade (toward Public) requires holder consent
- Upgrade (toward Maximum) can be initiated by holder or MCF protection staff

### 2.3 Information Security

**Technical Measures:**

- Encrypted databases with role-based access
- Access logging for all CMS records
- Regular security audits
- Air-gapped systems for Maximum protection cases

**Procedural Measures:**

- Background checks for all staff accessing CMS data
- Compartmentalization by need-to-know
- Mandatory breach reporting
- Regular confidentiality training

**Physical Measures:**

- Secure facilities for in-person services
- Multiple access points to facilities
- Counter-surveillance protocols for high-risk meetings
- Secure communication devices for protected holders

### 2.4 Data Minimization

MCF collects and retains only information necessary for:

- Eligibility verification
- Benefit provision
- Security protection
- Program evaluation (anonymized/aggregated)

Information not necessary for these purposes is not collected. Historical information is purged per retention schedules unless holder requests retention.

## 3. Reporting Mechanisms

### 3.1 Multi-Channel Reporting

CMS holders and potential participants can report intimidation through:

| Channel | Description | Best For |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **Hotline** | 24/7 phone/text line with multilingual operators | Immediate threats, verbal reporting preference |
| **Online Portal** | Encrypted web submission | Documentation, written preference, evidence upload |
| **Mobile App** | Secure app with panic button and location sharing | Personal safety, real-time threats |
| **In-Person** | MCF offices, PCC staff, designated safe locations | Complex situations, protected populations |
| **Third-Party** | Lawyers, NGOs, journalists authorized to report on behalf | Anonymity, fear of direct contact |
| **Community Contact** | Trusted community members trained as intermediaries | Populations with limited tech access or trust |

### 3.2 Report Processing

**Initial Response:**

1. Report received and logged (24/7 operations center)
2. Threat assessment within 2 hours (immediate threats) or 24 hours (other)
3. Reporter contacted (unless anonymous) with case number

**Investigation:**

1. Case assigned to protection officer
2. Evidence gathered and verified
3. Pattern analysis (connected incidents)
