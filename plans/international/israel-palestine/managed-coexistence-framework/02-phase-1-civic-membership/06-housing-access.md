# Housing Access Framework

**Parent Document:** [00-overview.md](00-overview.md)

**Applies To:** Phase 1 (initial), Phase 2 (expanded), Phase 3 (integrated)

**Objective:** Enable CMS holders to access housing across community boundaries while respecting property rights, demographic sensitivities, and non-prejudice principles.

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope

### 1.1 Rationale

Housing access is a critical component of functional coexistence. CMS holders who can work across communities need somewhere to live. However, housing in this context carries exceptional sensitivity:

- **Demographic concerns:** Both communities fear demographic shifts that could affect political outcomes
- **Property rights:** Competing claims to property from displacement, confiscation, and purchase
- **Security concerns:** Integrated neighborhoods may face security challenges
- **Settlement sensitivity:** Any housing mechanism must not normalize or expand settlements

This framework creates carefully bounded housing access that enables CMS benefits while respecting these constraints.

### 1.2 Scope

**Covered:**

- Rental housing access for CMS holders working across communities
- Temporary accommodation for cross-community employment
- SAZ residential development (Phase 2+)
- Property rights within MCF institutional framework

**Not Covered:**

- Final-status property claims (deferred per [04-refugees-diaspora.md](../06-sensitive-issues/04-refugees-diaspora.md))
- Jerusalem housing (excluded from MCF)
- Settlement expansion or contraction (deferred per [05-settlements.md](../06-sensitive-issues/05-settlements.md))
- Refugee return housing (separate framework)

### 1.3 Guiding Principles

1. **Non-prejudice:** Housing access does not affect any party's territorial or property claims
2. **Voluntary listing, non-discriminatory access:** Landlords choose whether to list properties for rent; once listed, non-discrimination rules apply (no forced cohabitation in shared-living arrangements)
3. **Market-based with protections:** Housing operates through markets but with anti-discrimination and safety protections
4. **Graduated expansion:** Housing access expands as trust develops across phases
5. **Settlement neutrality:** MCF housing mechanisms do not support settlement expansion or normalization (see Section 1.4)

### 1.4 Settlement Exclusion Rule

**Operational Prohibition:** MCF housing programs shall not:

| Prohibited Action | Rationale |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Register properties in settlements established after 1967 | Avoids normalizing disputed territory |
| Provide bond pool coverage for settlement rentals | Prevents MCF financial stake in settlement housing |
| Include settlement listings in MCF Housing Portal | No MCF marketing for settlement properties |
| Approve SAZ designation in settlement areas | Settlement expansion excluded from MCF territorial mechanisms |
| Fund infrastructure improvements to settlement housing | No MCF resource flow to settlement development |

**Boundary Definition:** Properties excluded under this rule are those located in:

- Israeli settlements in the West Bank as recognized by international law
- East Jerusalem (excluded from MCF entirely per Section 1.2)
- Properties on land designated as "State Land" post-1967 absent Palestinian consent

**Clarification:** This rule does not require MCF to take a position on the legality or permanence of settlements. MCF simply excludes them from its housing mechanisms to maintain non-prejudice and avoid becoming entangled in final-status issues.

**Cross-Reference:** See [05-settlements.md](../06-sensitive-issues/05-settlements.md) for MCF's broader settlement policy.

## 2. Phase 1: Cross-Community Rental Access

### 2.1 CMS Housing Rights

CMS holders gain the right to:

| Right | Scope | Limitations |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Non-discrimination | Cannot be refused housing solely based on community membership | Legitimate non-discriminatory reasons permitted (see below) |
| Lease protection | Standard lease terms apply regardless of community | Subject to local landlord-tenant law |
| Security deposit limits | Maximum deposit capped at 2 months rent | Additional guarantees via CMS bond pool |
| Eviction protection | Due process required for all evictions | Emergency eviction for serious violations permitted |

**Legitimate Non-Discriminatory Reasons:** Landlords may refuse tenancy based on:

- Credit history and rental payment history
- Employment verification and income sufficiency
- Negative references from prior landlords (verified, not community-based)
- Household size relative to unit capacity
- Pet restrictions uniformly applied
- Smoking restrictions uniformly applied

**Not Legitimate Reasons:** The following are pretextual and prohibited:

- "Security concerns" without individualized documented threat assessment
- Community-based stereotypes or generalizations
- Concerns about neighborhood reaction
- Religious or cultural practices that do not affect property use

### 2.2 Rental Registration System

**MCF Registered Rental Program:**

Landlords may voluntarily register properties with MCF:

**Registration Benefits:**

- Access to CMS Housing Bond Pool (guarantees against default)
- MCF mediation for disputes
- Verification of tenant CMS status
- Insurance subsidies for cross-community rentals

**Registration Requirements:**

- Property inspection for habitability standards
- Non-discrimination commitment
- Acceptance of MCF dispute resolution
- Reporting of occupancy data (aggregated, privacy-protected)

**Incentives for Registration:**

- Tax benefits where available
- Priority access to MCF infrastructure improvements
- Guarantor-backed insurance products
- Marketing through MCF housing portal

### 2.3 Worker Accommodation

**Temporary Worker Housing:**

For CMS holders with employment across community boundaries:

| Accommodation Type | Duration | Eligibility |
|-------------------|----------|-------------|
| Employer-provided housing | Duration of employment | Employer-sponsored CMS workers |
| MCF worker hostels | Up to 6 months | CMS holders with verified employment |
| Shared apartments | Renewable annually | CMS holders with stable employment |

**Worker Hostel Standards:**

- Single and shared room options
- Basic amenities (cooking, laundry, recreation)
- Security measures appropriate to location
- Transportation links to employment zones
- Gender-separated wings available where culturally requested; mixed-gender and gender-inclusive options also available; individuals housed according to self-identified gender

### 2.4 Anti-Discrimination Enforcement

**Prohibited Discrimination:**

- Refusing to rent based on community membership, religion, or ethnicity
- Different terms or conditions based on protected characteristics
- Harassment or intimidation of tenants
- Retaliatory actions against tenants exercising CMS rights

**Enforcement Mechanism:**

1. Complaint to MCF Housing Office
2. Investigation (14-day timeline)
3. Mediation attempt
4. Adjudication by MCF Housing Tribunal if mediation fails (see Section 6.1)
5. Remedies: damages, injunctive relief, registration revocation

**Limitations and Carve-Outs:**

| Carve-Out | Scope | Criteria | Review | Duration |
|-----------|-------|----------|--------|----------|
| Owner-occupied spare rooms | Landlord shares living space | Landlord's primary residence; shared common areas | Self-certified | Permanent |
| Religious institution housing | Seminaries, monasteries, religious schools | Religious function documented; not general rental | MCF Housing Office annual certification | Renewable annually |
| Individualized security restriction | Specific threat against property or landlord | Documented threat assessment; specific to individual, not community | JSVC review within 14 days | 12-month maximum; renewable with fresh assessment |

**Security Restriction Safeguards:**

- Security-based refusals require individualized threat assessment, not community generalizations
- JSVC must review and approve within 14 days; if not reviewed, restriction lapses
- Tenant may appeal to MCF Housing Tribunal
- Landlord may not cite "security" for more than 3 different applicants per year without audit trigger
- All security refusals logged (anonymized) for pattern analysis

---

## 3. CMS Housing Bond Pool

### 3.1 Purpose

The CMS Housing Bond Pool provides financial security that enables cross-community housing:

- **For landlords:** Guarantees against tenant default, damage, abandonment
- **For tenants:** Reduces security deposit requirements, enables access
- **For the market:** Creates confidence in cross-community transactions

### 3.2 Structure

**Funding Sources:**

- CMS member contributions (small annual fee)
- MCF institutional allocation
- Guarantor backing for catastrophic losses
- Premium payments from participating landlords

**Coverage:**

| Risk | Coverage | Maximum |
|------|----------|---------|
| Rent default | Up to 3 months unpaid rent | $5,000 |
| Property damage | Beyond normal wear | $10,000 |
| Abandonment | Vacancy costs and re-letting | $3,000 |
| Legal costs | Eviction and collection | $2,000 |

**Claims Process:**

1. Landlord documents claim with evidence
2. MCF Housing Office verifies claim
3. Payment within 30 days of approval
4. MCF recovers from tenant through CMS mechanisms (see Recovery Procedures below)

**Recovery Procedures (Due Process):**

| Stage | Action | Timeline | Tenant Rights |
|-------|--------|----------|---------------|
| Notice | MCF notifies tenant of verified claim and amount | Within 7 days of payment to landlord | Written notice with itemization |
| Contest | Tenant may contest claim accuracy | 30 days from notice | Hearing before MCF Housing Tribunal (Section 6.1) |
| Agreement | MCF proposes repayment plan | After contest period or hearing | Income-based affordability assessment |
| Recovery | Deductions from CMS benefits or direct payment | Per agreed schedule | Maximum 15% of monthly CMS benefits; hardship exemptions available |
| Default | Willful non-payment may affect CMS standing | After 6 months (see Willful Non-Payment below) | Hearing before CMS Review Panel; appeal to CMS Appeals Board |

**Willful Non-Payment Definition:**

"Willful non-payment" means refusal to engage with repayment despite demonstrated ability to pay. It does **not** include:

- Inability to pay due to poverty, job loss, or hardship (these trigger hardship review, not default)
- Disputes over claim validity (these are resolved through MCF Housing Tribunal)
- Good-faith engagement with repayment plan, even if payments are missed

**Determination Process:**

1. After 6 months of non-payment, MCF Housing Office initiates willfulness assessment
2. Tenant receives notice and opportunity to demonstrate hardship or engagement
3. MCF Housing Tribunal determines whether non-payment is willful
4. Only if willful: matter referred to CMS Review Panel for CMS standing review (appeal available to CMS Appeals Board)

**Protections:** Recovery actions cannot:

- Revoke CMS status solely for inability to pay (poverty is not grounds for revocation)
- Exceed affordable repayment limits
- Proceed without opportunity to contest underlying claim
- Affect CMS standing without willfulness determination by MCF Housing Tribunal

### 3.3 Tenant Obligations

CMS holders using bond pool benefits:

- Must maintain valid CMS status
- Must comply with lease terms
- Subject to bond pool recovery for legitimate claims
- May lose bond pool eligibility for repeated defaults

---

## 4. Phase 2: SAZ Residential Development

### 4.1 SAZ Housing Authority

Each SAZ establishes a Housing Authority responsible for:

- Residential zoning within SAZ boundaries
- Development approval and standards
- Affordable housing allocation
- Tenant protection enforcement
- Integration with MCF housing systems

### 4.2 SAZ Residential Zones

**Mixed-Community Zones:**

- Designated areas for integrated residential development
- Neutral design standards (not favoring either community's aesthetic)
- Shared community facilities (parks, schools, commercial)
- Enhanced security measures

**Community-Identified Zones:**

- Areas designated for specific community residential character
- Community can maintain cultural/religious institutions
- Still subject to CMS non-discrimination for rental access
- No forced demographic mixing

**Transitional Zones:**

- Buffer areas between community-identified zones
- Commercial/light industrial preference
- Limited residential (worker housing, hostels)

### 4.3 Affordable Housing Requirements

SAZ development subject to affordable housing mandates:

| Development Size | Affordable Requirement | Tenure |
|-----------------|----------------------|--------|
| 10-50 units | 15% affordable | 20-year deed restriction |
| 51-100 units | 20% affordable | 20-year deed restriction |
| 100+ units | 25% affordable | 30-year deed restriction |

**Affordable Definition:**

- Rental: Monthly rent ≤30% of area median income
- Purchase: Price ≤3x area median income
- Priority for CMS holders in cross-community employment

### 4.4 SAZ Property Rights

**Clear Title Requirement:**

- All SAZ property must have clear, MCF-verified title
- Disputed properties excluded from SAZ development
- Title insurance required for all transactions
- MCF title registry maintained

**Transaction Rules:**

- SAZ property transactions recorded in MCF registry
- Transfer taxes fund SAZ Housing Authority
- Anti-speculation measures (minimum hold periods, flip taxes)
- Non-CMS holder ownership restrictions (see below)

**Non-CMS Holder Ownership Restrictions:**

| Category | Restriction | Rationale |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Non-CMS individuals (Israeli or Palestinian) | May purchase with registration; no MCF bond pool; no standalone dispute initiation (see Section 6.1) | Encourages CMS enrollment without barring ownership |
| Foreign nationals (non-Israeli, non-Palestinian) | Maximum 10% of SAZ residential units; registration and use restrictions | Prevents SAZ from becoming investment vehicle for outside parties |
| Corporate/institutional owners | Prohibited for residential; permitted for commercial with SAZ Housing Authority approval | Maintains residential character for individuals |
| Guarantor-affiliated entities | Permitted for institutional housing (worker hostels, transitional housing) | Enables guarantor-supported housing programs |

**Note:** "No standalone dispute initiation" means non-CMS owners cannot bring MCF Housing Tribunal claims against other non-CMS parties. They **can** participate in tribunal proceedings when the dispute involves a CMS holder (as plaintiff or defendant). See Section 6.1 for full forum access rules.

**Enforcement:** SAZ Housing Authority maintains ownership registry; transfers violating restrictions are void; penalties include forced divestiture within 24 months.

**Non-Prejudice:**

- SAZ property rights do not prejudice final-status territorial claims
- SAZ dissolution procedures address property acquired during SAZ operation
- No implications for broader territorial sovereignty

---

## 5. Special Populations

### 5.1 Cross-Community Families

**Definition:** Households with members from both Israeli and Palestinian communities.

**Special Provisions:**

- Priority access to mixed-community housing zones
- Expedited registration for rental properties
- Family unity protection in eviction proceedings
- Child welfare considerations in housing disputes

### 5.2 CMS Workers with Families

CMS holders may bring immediate family (spouse, minor children) for employment-related housing:

- Family members need not hold individual CMS
- Family housing larger than single worker accommodation
- School access for children (per [10-vulnerable-populations.md](../08-operational-procedures/10-vulnerable-populations.md))
- Healthcare access for family members

### 5.3 Elderly and Disabled

Priority access and accommodations for:

- Ground-floor or elevator-accessible units
- Proximity to healthcare facilities
- Modified lease terms for medical needs
- Care provider accommodation

### 5.4 Vulnerable Populations

Per [10-vulnerable-populations.md](../08-operational-procedures/10-vulnerable-populations.md):

- Emergency housing for GBV survivors
- Safe houses with confidential locations
- LGBTQ+ protection in housing access
- Human trafficking victim housing

---

## 6. Property Disputes

### 6.1 MCF Housing Tribunal

Specialized tribunal for housing-related disputes:

**Jurisdiction:**

- Landlord-tenant disputes involving CMS holders
- Discrimination claims in housing
- SAZ property disputes
- Bond pool claim disputes
- Willfulness determinations for bond pool defaults (Section 3.2)

**Forum Routing:**

| Dispute Type | Forum | Notes |
|--------------|-------|-------|
| Housing discrimination | MCF Housing Tribunal | All housing discrimination claims |
| Landlord-tenant disputes | MCF Housing Tribunal | If either party is CMS holder |
| Bond pool claims | MCF Housing Tribunal | Claim accuracy and repayment disputes |
| Security restriction appeals | MCF Housing Tribunal | JSVC decisions appealable here |
| SAZ property disputes | MCF Housing Tribunal | Ownership, title, transaction disputes |
| Willfulness determination | MCF Housing Tribunal | Required before CMS status referral |
| CMS status changes | CMS Review Panel → CMS Appeals Board | Only after Housing Tribunal willfulness finding |

**Non-CMS Party Access:**

Non-CMS holders may access the MCF Housing Tribunal when:

- The dispute involves a CMS holder as counterparty (landlord or tenant)
- The dispute concerns SAZ property (regardless of CMS status)

Non-CMS holders **may not**:

- Initiate standalone complaints without CMS counterparty involvement
- Access bond pool benefits (claims or coverage)
- Use MCF Housing Tribunal for disputes with other non-CMS holders (use national courts)

**Clarification:** The "no MCF dispute resolution access" restriction for non-CMS owners (Section 4.4) means non-CMS owners cannot initiate MCF proceedings without a CMS counterparty. It does not bar them from responding to tribunal proceedings or participating when a CMS holder initiates.

**Composition:**

- Professional judges (not community-based)
- Housing law expertise required
- Expedited procedures (decision within 60 days)

**Remedies:**

- Monetary damages
- Specific performance (lease enforcement)
- Injunctive relief
- Registration/license revocation

### 6.2 Excluded from MCF Jurisdiction

**Final-Status Property Claims:**

- 1948/1967 displacement property
- Confiscated land claims
- Refugee property claims
- Jerusalem property

These claims are preserved for future resolution; MCF housing mechanisms do not adjudicate them.

### 6.3 Emergency Procedures

**Urgent Housing Situations:**

- Emergency housing orders (24-hour turnaround)
- Lockout prevention
- Utility shutoff protection
- Domestic violence relocation

---

## 7. Phase 3: Integrated Housing

### 7.1 Phase 3 Possibilities

If Phase 3 convergence occurs, housing framework may evolve to:

- Full freedom of residence across territories
- Unified property law and registration
- Integrated mortgage and financing markets
- Abolition of community-specific restrictions

These developments depend on convergence outcomes and are not predetermined.

### 7.2 Transition Provisions

Any Phase 2→3 transition includes:

- Continuity of existing leases and ownership
- Property rights acquired in earlier phases honored
- Gradual integration rather than sudden change
- Referendum approval for major changes

---

## 8. Operational Infrastructure

### 8.1 MCF Housing Portal

Online platform providing:

- Registered rental listings searchable by CMS holders
- Landlord registration and management
- Dispute filing and tracking
- Bond pool claims and status
- Market information (rent indices, availability)

### 8.2 Housing Office

MCF institutional unit responsible for:

- Registration administration
- Dispute intake and triage
- Bond pool management
- Data collection and reporting
- Policy development

**Staffing:** Mixed community composition following MCF personnel standards.

### 8.3 Verification Systems

Integration with:

- CMS status verification (real-time)
- Employment verification (for worker housing)
- Property title verification (for SAZ transactions)
- Background checks (for specific housing types)

---

## 9. Safeguards

### 9.1 Demographic Monitoring

**Purpose:** Monitor housing patterns to detect potential demographic manipulation.

**Mechanisms:**

- Anonymized residency data collection
- Geographic distribution analysis
- Trend reporting to MCF institutions
- Triggers for policy review if concerning patterns emerge

**Limitations:**

- No individual targeting
- No demographic quotas or caps
- Monitoring is for awareness, not control
- Privacy protections per [09-data-it-systems.md](../08-operational-procedures/09-data-it-systems.md)

### 9.2 Anti-Speculation Measures

**Concern:** Housing could be used for speculative investment rather than residency.

**Countermeasures:**

- Minimum occupancy requirements for SAZ purchase
- Flip taxes on rapid resales
- Vacancy penalties
- Priority for owner-occupants in new development

### 9.3 Security Concerns

**Integrated Housing Security:**

- MCF security coordination for mixed areas
- Rapid response protocols
- Community liaison officers
- Incident reporting and response

**Tenant Safety:**

- Emergency contacts
- Safe egress requirements
- Communication with local authorities
- Integration with anti-intimidation framework
