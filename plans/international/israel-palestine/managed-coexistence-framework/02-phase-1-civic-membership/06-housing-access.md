# Housing Access Framework

**Parent Document:** [00-overview.md](00-overview.md)

**Applies To:** Phase 1 (initial), Phase 2 (expanded), Phase 3 (integrated)

**Objective:** Enable CMS holders to access housing across community boundaries while respecting property rights, demographic sensitivities, and non-prejudice principles.

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope

### 1.1 Rationale

Housing access is a critical component of functional coexistence. CMS holders who can work across communities need somewhere to live. However, housing in this context carries exceptional sensitivity:

- **Demographic concerns:** Both communities fear demographic shifts that could affect political outcomes
- **Property rights:** Competing claims to property from displacement, confiscation, and purchase
- **Security concerns:** Integrated neighborhoods may face security challenges
- **Settlement sensitivity:** Any housing mechanism must not normalize or expand settlements

This framework creates carefully bounded housing access that enables CMS benefits while respecting these constraints.

### 1.2 Scope

**Covered:**
- Rental housing access for CMS holders working across communities
- Temporary accommodation for cross-community employment
- SAZ residential development (Phase 2+)
- Property rights within MCF institutional framework

**Not Covered:**
- Final-status property claims (deferred per [04-refugees-diaspora.md](../06-sensitive-issues/04-refugees-diaspora.md))
- Jerusalem housing (excluded from MCF)
- Settlement expansion or contraction (deferred per [05-settlements.md](../06-sensitive-issues/05-settlements.md))
- Refugee return housing (separate framework)

### 1.3 Guiding Principles

1. **Non-prejudice:** Housing access does not affect any party's territorial or property claims
2. **Voluntary participation:** No one is required to rent to or live with members of other communities
3. **Market-based with protections:** Housing operates through markets but with anti-discrimination and safety protections
4. **Graduated expansion:** Housing access expands as trust develops across phases

---

## 2. Phase 1: Cross-Community Rental Access

### 2.1 CMS Housing Rights

CMS holders gain the right to:

| Right | Scope | Limitations |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Non-discrimination | Cannot be refused housing solely based on community membership | Landlords retain discretion for legitimate reasons |
| Lease protection | Standard lease terms apply regardless of community | Subject to local landlord-tenant law |
| Security deposit limits | Maximum deposit capped at 2 months rent | Additional guarantees via CMS bond pool |
| Eviction protection | Due process required for all evictions | Emergency eviction for serious violations permitted |

### 2.2 Rental Registration System

**MCF Registered Rental Program:**

Landlords may voluntarily register properties with MCF:

**Registration Benefits:**
- Access to CMS Housing Bond Pool (guarantees against default)
- MCF mediation for disputes
- Verification of tenant CMS status
- Insurance subsidies for cross-community rentals

**Registration Requirements:**
- Property inspection for habitability standards
- Non-discrimination commitment
- Acceptance of MCF dispute resolution
- Reporting of occupancy data (aggregated, privacy-protected)

**Incentives for Registration:**
- Tax benefits where available
- Priority access to MCF infrastructure improvements
- Guarantor-backed insurance products
- Marketing through MCF housing portal

### 2.3 Worker Accommodation

**Temporary Worker Housing:**

For CMS holders with employment across community boundaries:

| Accommodation Type | Duration | Eligibility |
|-------------------|----------|-------------|
| Employer-provided housing | Duration of employment | Employer-sponsored CMS workers |
| MCF worker hostels | Up to 6 months | CMS holders with verified employment |
| Shared apartments | Renewable annually | CMS holders with stable employment |

**Worker Hostel Standards:**
- Single and shared room options
- Basic amenities (cooking, laundry, recreation)
- Security measures appropriate to location
- Transportation links to employment zones
- Separated by gender where culturally appropriate

### 2.4 Anti-Discrimination Enforcement

**Prohibited Discrimination:**
- Refusing to rent based on community membership, religion, or ethnicity
- Different terms or conditions based on protected characteristics
- Harassment or intimidation of tenants
- Retaliatory actions against tenants exercising CMS rights

**Enforcement Mechanism:**
1. Complaint to MCF Housing Office
2. Investigation (14-day timeline)
3. Mediation attempt
4. Adjudication by CMS Dispute Tribunal if mediation fails
5. Remedies: damages, injunctive relief, registration revocation

**Limitations:**
- Does not apply to owner-occupied properties (spare room rentals)
- Religious institutions may maintain community-specific housing for religious purposes
- Security-based restrictions permitted with documented justification

---

## 3. CMS Housing Bond Pool

### 3.1 Purpose

The CMS Housing Bond Pool provides financial security that enables cross-community housing:

- **For landlords:** Guarantees against tenant default, damage, abandonment
- **For tenants:** Reduces security deposit requirements, enables access
- **For the market:** Creates confidence in cross-community transactions

### 3.2 Structure

**Funding Sources:**
- CMS member contributions (small annual fee)
- MCF institutional allocation
- Guarantor backing for catastrophic losses
- Premium payments from participating landlords

**Coverage:**

| Risk | Coverage | Maximum |
|------|----------|---------|
| Rent default | Up to 3 months unpaid rent | $5,000 |
| Property damage | Beyond normal wear | $10,000 |
| Abandonment | Vacancy costs and re-letting | $3,000 |
| Legal costs | Eviction and collection | $2,000 |

**Claims Process:**
1. Landlord documents claim with evidence
2. MCF Housing Office verifies claim
3. Payment within 30 days of approval
4. MCF recovers from tenant through CMS mechanisms

### 3.3 Tenant Obligations

CMS holders using bond pool benefits:
- Must maintain valid CMS status
- Must comply with lease terms
- Subject to bond pool recovery for legitimate claims
- May lose bond pool eligibility for repeated defaults

## 4. Phase 2: SAZ Residential Development

- Tenant protection enforcement
- Integration with MCF housing systems

### 4.2 SAZ Residential Zones

**Mixed-Community Zones:**
- Designated areas for integrated residential development
- Neutral design standards (not favoring either community's aesthetic)
- Shared community facilities (parks, schools, commercial)
- Enhanced security measures

**Community-Identified Zones:**
- Areas designated for specific community residential character
- Community can maintain cultural/religious institutions
- Still subject to CMS non-discrimination for rental access
- No forced demographic mixing

**Transitional Zones:**
- Buffer areas between community-identified zones
- Commercial/light industrial preference
- Limited residential (worker housing, hostels)

### 4.3 Affordable Housing Requirements

SAZ development subject to affordable housing mandates:

| Development Size | Affordable Requirement | Tenure |
|-----------------|----------------------|--------|
| 10-50 units | 15% affordable | 20-year deed restriction |
| 51-100 units | 20% affordable | 20-year deed restriction |
| 100+ units | 25% affordable | 30-year deed restriction |

**Affordable Definition:**
- Rental: Monthly rent ≤30% of area median income
- Purchase: Price ≤3x area median income
- Priority for CMS holders in cross-community employment

### 4.4 SAZ Property Rights

**Clear Title Requirement:**
- All SAZ property must have clear, MCF-verified title
- Disputed properties excluded from SAZ development

- MCF title registry maintained

**Transaction Rules:**
- SAZ property transactions recorded in MCF registry
- Transfer taxes fund SAZ Housing Authority
- Anti-speculation measures (minimum hold periods, flip taxes)
- Foreign ownership restrictions (non-CMS holders limited)

**Non-Prejudice:**
- SAZ property rights do not prejudice final-status territorial claims
- SAZ dissolution procedures address property acquired during SAZ operation
- No implications for broader territorial sovereignty

## 9. Safeguards

### 9.1 Demographic Monitoring

**Concern:** Housing could be used for speculative investment rather than residency.

**Countermeasures:**
- Minimum occupancy requirements for SAZ purchase
- Flip taxes on rapid resales
- Vacancy penalties
- Priority for owner-occupants in new development

### 9.3 Security Concerns

**Integrated Housing Security:**
- MCF security coordination for mixed areas
