# Confederal Rights Compact (CRC)

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#phase-1-years-520-opt-in-civic-membership-without-territorial-change)

**Phase:** Phase 0 onwards (expanded application in Phase 2)

**Status:** Draft

---

## Purpose

The Confederal Rights Compact (CRC) is a **binding civilian rights charter** that governs all MCF institutions and Special Administrative Zones (SAZs). It is not a constitution, not a sovereignty claim, and not a substitute for final-status arrangements. Its purpose is narrower and more practical: to establish a **non-negotiable minimum set of rights and protections** within MCF domains, independent of factional control, citizenship status, or participation history.

The CRC functions as a **floor, not a ceiling**. No authority operating within MCF domains may provide fewer rights than the CRC guarantees, but they may provide more. Importantly, CRC rights do not depend on recognition, allegiance, or ideological compliance.

**Scope Note:** CRC application expands over phases. In Phase 0-1, CRC rights attach to **participants** (CMS holders, PCC users, MCF program participants). In Phase 2+, CRC rights attach to **presence**—all persons within SAZ boundaries hold CRC rights regardless of CMS status. See Section 1.1 for the full phased application framework.

---

## Core Principle: Irreducible Civilian Contract

The CRC is the irreducible civilian contract underlying MCF: a rules-based guarantee that life inside MCF domains is governed by law rather than discretion, regardless of who holds power outside. Its legitimacy rests not on political consensus, but on **enforceability, clarity, and symmetry**.

Without a fully articulated CRC, SAZs are administrative experiments. With it, they become rights-bearing civilian spaces capable of surviving political hostility, security shocks, and transitional ambiguity.

---

## 1. Application and Scope

### 1.1 Phased Application

| Phase | Application Scope |
|-------|------------------|
| **Phase 0** | Applies to UVB/JSVC operations, PCC users, and all MCF institutional activities |
| **Phase 1** | Applies to all CMS holders, MCF programs, arbitration proceedings, and benefit systems |
| **Phase 2** | Preempts inconsistent local/municipal rules within SAZ territory; applies to all persons present regardless of CMS status (see hierarchy note below) |
| **Phase 3** | Baseline for any convergence arrangements; may be constitutionalized |

**Legal Hierarchy Note (Phase 2+):** CRC preempts inconsistent local ordinances, municipal rules, and administrative regulations within SAZs. CRC does **not** preempt national constitutional rights, which continue to provide protections alongside CRC. Where conflict exists between CRC and national constitutional protections, the more protective standard applies (see Section 9.5). CRC operates as a **floor above local rules** but **alongside, not above, national constitutions**.

### 1.2 Territorial vs. Personal Application

**Personal Application (Phase 0-1):**

- CRC rights attach to individuals who are CMS holders or participants in MCF programs
- Rights are portable across territories while engaged with MCF institutions
- National law continues to apply outside MCF program contexts

**Territorial Application (Phase 2+):**

- Within SAZ boundaries, CRC rights attach to **presence**, not status
- All persons within an SAZ—residents, visitors, workers, refugees—hold CRC rights while present
- SAZ exit does not terminate rights claims for violations that occurred inside

### 1.3 What the CRC Explicitly Does NOT Do

The CRC:

- Does **not** confer citizenship, nationality, or sovereign rights
- Does **not** recognize or deny claims to land, borders, or statehood
- Does **not** require recognition of any political authority
- Does **not** resolve final-status disputes or substitute for international law claims
- Does **not** create immunity from national criminal law for conduct outside MCF domains

This negative definition is as important as the positive one. By refusing to adjudicate sovereignty, the CRC protects itself from being read as normalization, annexation, or interim statehood by stealth.

## 2. Personal Security and Physical Integrity

### 2.1 Right to Life and Security

All individuals within MCF domains have the right to protection from violence, whether perpetrated by state actors, non-state actors, or private individuals. This includes protection from:

- Collective punishment
- Retaliatory harm
- Indiscriminate use of force
- Targeted assassination without lawful authority
- Violence based on identity, affiliation, or participation status

### 2.2 Use of Force Limitations

Use of force by any security actor within MCF domains is strictly limited to:

- **Necessity**: Force only when no alternative exists
- **Proportionality**: Minimum force required to address the threat
- **Documentation**: All use of force must be recorded
- **Independent review**: Subject to mandatory after-action assessment

### 2.3 Absolute Prohibitions

The following are categorically prohibited within MCF domains, with no exceptions:

| Prohibition | Definition |
|-------------|------------|
| **Arbitrary detention** | Detention without legal basis or judicial review |
| **Enforced disappearance** | Unacknowledged detention or concealment of fate |
| **Torture** | Intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering |
| **Cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment** | Treatment causing serious suffering below torture threshold |
| **Extrajudicial killing** | Deliberate killing outside lawful authority |

These prohibitions apply equally to MCF security, IDF forces operating under override conditions, PA forces, or any other actor. No emergency, security threat, or political circumstance justifies violation.

### 2.4 Protection from Non-State Violence

MCF institutions have an affirmative duty to protect individuals from violence by non-state actors, including:

- Intimidation by community members
- Factional retaliation
- Criminal violence
- Honor-based violence

Protection obligations are subject to resource constraints but require good-faith effort and transparent prioritization.

---

## 3. Legal Status and Due Process

### 3.1 Status Clarity Guarantee

Individuals within MCF domains may not be left in undefined or liminal legal conditions as a coercive tool. All persons must have:

- Clearly defined civilian status while present
- Documentation of that status upon request
- Pathway to regularize status if initially unclear

**Status ambiguity as punishment is prohibited.**

### 3.2 Due Process Rights

No individual may be deprived of liberty, status, or access to basic services without due process. Due process includes:

| Component | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Notice** | Timely notification of reasons for any adverse action |
| **Hearing** | Opportunity to be heard before a neutral decision-maker |
| **Evidence** | Access to evidence relied upon (with limited security exceptions) |
| **Representation** | Right to assistance or representation |
| **Appeal** | Access to independent review of adverse decisions |
| **Timeliness** | Resolution within reasonable time periods |

### 3.3 Detention Safeguards

Any detention within MCF domains must comply with:

- Maximum 48 hours before judicial review (24 hours for minors)
- Access to legal counsel within 24 hours
- Notification to family or designated contact within 24 hours
- Humane conditions meeting minimum standards
- Regular review of continued necessity
- Clear end date or release pathway

### 3.4 Fair Trial Guarantees

Any adjudicative proceeding within MCF institutions must provide:

- Independent and impartial decision-maker
- Presumption of innocence (where applicable)
- Right to present evidence and witnesses
- Right to confront adverse evidence
- Reasoned written decision
- Right of appeal

---

## 4. Movement and Access Rights

### 4.1 Internal Movement

Within SAZ boundaries (Phase 2+), the CRC guarantees freedom of movement, subject only to:

- Neutral, published safety restrictions
- Equal application regardless of identity
- Time-limited duration
- Regular review and justification

### 4.2 Entry and Exit

Entry to and exit from SAZs must be governed by:

- Transparent, published rules
- Non-arbitrary application
- Individual rather than collective assessment
- Reviewable denial decisions
- Emergency exit guarantees

### 4.3 Prohibited Restrictions

The following movement restrictions are prohibited **under normal operations**:

- **Collective closure**: Closing SAZ access as response to individual acts
- **Identity-based denial**: Restricting movement based on ethnicity, religion, or political belief
- **Punitive restriction**: Using movement denial as punishment without due process
- **Indefinite restriction**: Movement limits without defined duration or review

**Emergency Exception:** During formally declared emergencies (per Section 8.2), time-limited, geographically bounded movement restrictions may be imposed through [Shock-Absorber Protocols](../01-phase-0-institutions/04-shock-absorber-protocols.md). Such restrictions must be:

- Formally declared with specific duration (max 30 days per shock-absorber caps)
- Applied neutrally (not identity-based)
- Proportionate to the security threat
- Subject to regular review and guarantor oversight
- Reported to guarantors within 24 hours

Emergency movement restrictions do **not** permit: indefinite closures, identity-based targeting, or punitive application. The prohibitions on identity-based denial and indefinite restriction remain absolute even during emergencies.

### 4.4 Extra-SAZ Movement

The CRC does **not** guarantee unrestricted movement beyond SAZ boundaries. However, it does guarantee that any movement restrictions imposed by MCF institutions are:

- Rule-based and published
- Reviewable through appeal
- Non-punitive in character
- Subject to periodic reassessment

---

## 5. Economic Rights and Material Security

### 5.1 Right to Work and Economic Participation

Individuals within MCF domains have the right to:

- Seek and engage in employment
- Enter into contracts
- Receive wages for work performed
- Access financial services
- Participate in economic programs

**Work Authorization Note:** The right to seek and engage in employment operates within applicable legal frameworks. For cross-community employment, CMS holders must obtain work permits through the [MCF employment program](01-cms-framework.md#42-employment-access), which facilitates but does not override national work authorization requirements. CRC guarantees non-discriminatory access to the permit process and protection from arbitrary denial, but does not create unconditional work authorization independent of national law. See [Labor Mobility](../07-economic-architecture/02-labor-mobility.md) for permit procedures.

Economic participation may not be denied on the basis of:

- Political belief or expression
- Factional affiliation (current or former)
- Non-participation in optional MCF programs
- Family relationships or associations
- Religious practice or identity

### 5.2 Property Protection

Property within MCF domains is protected from:

- Arbitrary seizure without lawful authority
- Destruction without military necessity and compensation
- Confiscation as collective punishment
- Unlawful expropriation

Property disputes are subject to arbitration and appeal procedures.

### 5.3 Financial Access

The CRC establishes a baseline financial access mandate:

- Transaction accounts for receiving wages and making payments
- Savings mechanisms
- Access to credit on non-discriminatory terms
- Protection from arbitrary account closure

De-risking practices that lead to blanket account closures based on identity or territory are **explicitly prohibited** within MCF domains.

### 5.4 Non-Extraction Principle

Economic rights are framed to prevent extraction and dependency:

- Fees, tariffs, and service charges must be transparent
- Charges must be capped and directly linked to service provision
- Fee schedules must be public and audited
- Surplus must be reinvested, not extracted

---

## 6. Civic and Social Rights

### 6.1 Access to Basic Services

All individuals within MCF domains have the right to access basic civilian services without discrimination:

| Service | Standard |
|---------|----------|
| **Healthcare** | Emergency care guaranteed; routine care on equal terms |
| **Education** | Access to educational facilities on non-discriminatory basis |
| **Utilities** | Water, electricity, sanitation on equal terms |
| **Emergency response** | Fire, medical emergency, disaster response |

Service access may not be conditioned on political compliance or program participation.

### 6.2 Freedom of Expression

The CRC protects freedom of expression, including:

- Political speech and opinion
- Criticism of MCF institutions
- Opposition to MCF itself
- Cultural and artistic expression
- Religious expression

**Limitations**: Expression may be restricted only when it constitutes:

- Direct incitement to imminent violence
- Credible threats against specific individuals
- Disclosure of protected security information

### 6.3 Freedom of Association

Individuals may freely associate for:

- Political organizing
- Labor unions and professional associations
- Religious communities
- Cultural organizations
- Civic groups

**Protected opposition**: Holding, expressing, or organizing around political positions—including opposition to MCF itself—does not constitute a violation, so long as conduct remains nonviolent within civilian spaces.

### 6.4 Freedom of Religion

The CRC guarantees:

- Freedom to practice religion (or no religion)
- Access to religious sites within MCF domains on equal terms
- Protection from religious coercion
- Non-discrimination based on religious identity

Religious practice may not be used to override other CRC rights (e.g., gender equality within MCF institutions).

### 6.5 Participation Rights

CMS holders have the right to participate in MCF governance through:

- Voting in applicable elections or referenda
- Standing for elected positions where eligible
- Petitioning MCF institutions
- Participating in public consultations
- Accessing information about MCF operations

---

## 7. Administrative and Data Protections

### 7.1 Data Collection Limits

MCF institutions may collect only information necessary for:

- Eligibility verification
- Benefit provision
- Security protection
- Program evaluation (anonymized/aggregated)

Information not necessary for these purposes may not be collected.

### 7.2 Use Restrictions

Information gathered for civilian administration may not be repurposed for:

- Intelligence collection beyond defined threats
- Political profiling
- Coercive enforcement outside clearly defined threats to life
- Transfer to parties for non-MCF purposes

### 7.3 Inference Prohibitions

The following may not be used to infer risk, disloyalty, or intent:

- Participation history
- Withdrawal from programs
- Refusal to participate
- Family or community associations
- Political beliefs or expressions

### 7.4 Administrative Legibility

Administrative decisions must be:

- Documented in writing
- Based on stated criteria
- Explained to affected individuals
- Reversible through defined appeal mechanisms

### 7.5 Data Retention and Deletion

- Retention limited to period necessary for stated purpose
- Automatic deletion schedules for routine data
- Right to request deletion upon program exit (subject to retention schedules; see note below)
- No adverse annotation for withdrawal

**Retention Schedule Note:** The right to request deletion operates within MCF data retention requirements. [CMS data policy](01-cms-framework.md#71-data-collection) specifies retention periods (e.g., identity information: duration of CMS + 7 years; vetting records: duration + 10 years) necessary for audit, accountability, and fraud prevention. Upon program exit, data enters retention-only mode (no active sharing), and individuals may request deletion after the applicable retention period expires. Security exceptions permit extended retention only when specific, documented threats exist.

## 8. Limitations and Derogation

### 8.1 Permissible Limitations

CRC rights may be limited only when:

- Prescribed by published rule
- Necessary for legitimate objective (security, public health, rights of others)
- Proportionate to the objective
- Non-discriminatory in application
- Subject to review and appeal

### 8.2 Emergency Derogation

During declared emergencies, additional limitations may apply:

- Emergency must be formally declared with defined duration
- Derogation must be proportionate to emergency
- Derogation must be reported to guarantors
- Regular review required for continuation

### 8.3 Non-Derogable Rights

The following rights may **never** be suspended, even in emergency:

| Right | Reason |
|-------|--------|
| Right to life | Fundamental to human dignity |
| Prohibition of torture | Absolute under international law |
| Prohibition of enforced disappearance | Absolute under international law |
| Status clarity | Prevents coercion through ambiguity |
| Access to judicial review | Prevents arbitrary detention |
| Non-discrimination in application | Prevents selective persecution |

### 8.4 Proportionality Test

All limitations must satisfy a four-part test:

1. **Legitimate aim**: Serves a recognized protective purpose
2. **Necessity**: No less restrictive means available
3. **Proportionality**: Limitation proportionate to aim
4. **Non-discrimination**: Applied equally

---

## 9. Enforcement Architecture

### 9.1 Standing

CRC rights are enforceable by:

- Any individual within MCF domains (personal standing)
- Organizations on behalf of affected individuals (representational standing)
- MCF institutions (institutional standing for systemic violations)

Standing belongs to individuals, not factions. Any person may invoke CRC protections without requiring organizational sponsorship.

### 9.2 Enforcement Bodies

**Primary Enforcement:**

- CRC Review Panel: Independent body for individual complaints
- SAZ judicial mechanisms (Phase 2+)
- MCF arbitration for economic and contractual matters

**Appellate Enforcement:**

- MCF Appeals Body
- Guarantor review for systemic violations
- International documentation for external accountability

### 9.3 Remedies

Available remedies for CRC violations include:

| Remedy | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| **Declaratory relief** | Formal finding of violation |
| **Injunctive relief** | Order to cease violation |
| **Reinstatement** | Restoration of access or status |
| **Compensation** | Monetary damages from MCF funds |
| **Correction** | Modification of records |
| **Operational consequences** | Suspension of violator's privileges |

### 9.4 Consequences for Violators

Repeated or systemic CRC violations may result in:

- Suspension of specific authority's operational privileges within SAZs
- Removal of personnel
- Guarantor intervention
- Public documentation
- Referral to external accountability mechanisms

Consequences apply to authorities and personnel, **not** to civilian populations.

### 9.5 Relationship to National Enforcement

**Legal Hierarchy:**

| Level | Authority | CRC Relationship |
|-------|-----------|------------------|
| National constitutions | Highest domestic authority | CRC operates alongside; more protective standard applies |
| National statutes | Below constitution | CRC operates alongside; more protective standard applies |
| Local/municipal rules | Below statutes | CRC preempts inconsistent rules within SAZs (Phase 2+) |
| MCF administrative rules | MCF internal | Must comply with CRC |

**Key Principles:**

- CRC does not displace national constitutional rights
- National courts retain jurisdiction over national law matters
- CRC provides an additional protective layer, not a replacement
- Where CRC and national constitutional rights conflict, the **more protective standard** applies to the individual
- CRC enforcement bodies may not override national court judgments, but may document violations for external accountability
- Individuals may invoke CRC protections in MCF proceedings regardless of national court outcomes

**Clarification:** "Preempts inconsistent local rules" (Phase 2+) means CRC standards control over municipal ordinances, local administrative regulations, and SAZ-specific rules that would provide lesser protections. It does **not** mean CRC overrides national constitutional protections, which continue to apply alongside CRC.

---

## 10. Amendment Procedures

### 10.1 Floor Expansion

The CRC floor may be raised (additional rights added) through:

1. Proposal by MCF institutions, participating parties, or guarantors
2. Review period with public comment
3. Approval by CRC Review Panel
4. Confirmation by guarantor consensus
5. Publication and implementation

Floor expansion is designed to be achievable; CRC should improve over time.

### 10.2 Floor Reduction

Reduction of CRC rights is subject to heightened requirements:

1. Proposal with detailed justification
2. Extended review period (minimum 12 months)
3. Supermajority approval by guarantors
4. Non-objection by affected party populations
5. Phase regression assessment

Floor reduction should be rare and difficult.

### 10.3 Interpretation Authority

**Primary interpreter**: CRC Review Panel

**Binding precedent**: Panel decisions create binding precedent for future cases

**Guarantor role**: Guarantors may issue interpretive guidance but may not override Panel decisions in individual cases

**Consistency**: Interpretation must be consistent across SAZs and phases

---

## 11. Relationship to Other MCF Components

### 11.1 CMS Framework

- CRC defines rights attached to CMS
- CMS revocation does not terminate CRC claims for prior violations
- CMS benefits may exceed CRC floor

### 11.2 SAZ Constitutional Floor

- CRC serves as constitutional floor for all SAZs
- SAZ governance may not reduce CRC protections
- SAZ-specific rights may supplement CRC

### 11.3 Anti-Intimidation Architecture

- Anti-intimidation mechanisms enforce CRC security rights
- Protection levels correspond to CRC guarantees
- Reporting channels provide CRC enforcement access

### 11.4 Shock-Absorber Protocols

- Protocol restrictions may not violate CRC non-derogable rights
- Tier responses must satisfy CRC proportionality
- Medical PCC exemptions reflect CRC health rights

### 11.5 Dispute Resolution

- CRC Review Panel integrates with MCF dispute resolution
- Appeal pathways connect to MCF appeals architecture
- Arbitration applies CRC standards

---

## 12. Relationship to International Law

### 12.1 Compatibility, Not Displacement

CRC is designed to be compatible with but not dispositive of international law. It operates **alongside** international human rights and humanitarian law rather than above or in defiance of it.

### 12.2 Minimum Standards

CRC standards are deliberately framed to be **at least as restrictive as** minimum international norms, without claiming to define those norms. Compliance with CRC does not substitute for compliance with international law.

### 12.3 Documentation for External Use

CRC enforcement records are designed to be usable by external legal bodies should states or courts choose to rely on them. MCF does not claim exclusive authority over accountability.
