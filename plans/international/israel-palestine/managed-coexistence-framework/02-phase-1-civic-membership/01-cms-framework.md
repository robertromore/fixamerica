# Civic Membership Status (CMS) Framework

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#phase-1-years-520-opt-in-civic-membership-without-territorial-change)

**Phase:** Phase 1 onwards

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## Purpose

Civic Membership Status (CMS) is a **voluntary legal status layered on top of existing citizenship**. It provides access to MCF benefits without altering national identity, citizenship, or requiring territorial change.

CMS is the mechanism through which MCF builds a **constituency for coexistence**—individuals who have demonstrated commitment to peaceful interaction and who benefit materially from the framework's success. Unlike citizenship, CMS does not imply political allegiance or identity transformation. It is a practical status that enables participation in specific programs and protections.

---

## Core Principle: Layered Status, Not Alternative Identity

CMS operates **alongside** existing citizenship and legal status, not as a replacement:

- A Palestinian with CMS remains a Palestinian
- An Israeli with CMS remains an Israeli
- CMS adds rights and access within MCF domains
- CMS does not alter rights or obligations under national law
- CMS can be acquired without abandoning any existing status

---

## 1. CMS Definition

### 1.1 Legal Nature

CMS is a **sui generis status** that exists only within the MCF framework:

| Characteristic | CMS | Citizenship | Residency |
|----------------|-----|-------------|-----------|
| Confers identity | No | Yes | No |
| Confers nationality | No | Yes | No |
| Grants domestic voting rights | No | Yes | Sometimes |
| Grants territorial residency rights | No | Usually | Yes |
| Layerable on other statuses | Yes | Sometimes | Sometimes |
| Voluntary acquisition | Yes | Sometimes | Sometimes |
| Voluntary renunciation | Yes | Sometimes | Yes |

### 1.2 What CMS Is

- A registration with MCF institutions confirming eligibility and commitment
- A basis for accessing MCF-specific benefits and protections
- A legal status recognized by guarantors and participating institutions
- A credential portable across MCF programs regardless of location

### 1.3 What CMS Is Not

- Citizenship of any state
- Residency permit for any territory
- Recognition of any political claim
- Endorsement of any final status position
- Membership in any political organization

### 1.4 International Legal Analogues

CMS draws conceptually from:

| Analogue | Similarity | Difference |
|----------|------------|------------|
| EU citizenship | Layered on national citizenship, grants cross-border rights | EU citizenship requires member state citizenship; CMS does not |
| Schengen participation | Functional integration without political merger | Schengen is state-level; CMS is individual-level |
| Professional licensure | Portable credential enabling specific activities | CMS is broader than professional scope |
| Refugee status | International status with specific protections | Refugee status is involuntary; CMS is voluntary |

---

## 2. Eligibility and Application

### 2.1 Basic Eligibility

**Who May Apply**

Any natural person who:

- Is at least 18 years of age
- Resides within the MCF operational area OR is a member of the recognized diaspora population

CMS applicants must complete three requirements:

1. **Security Vetting** (Section 2.3)
2. **Civic Education Curriculum** (Section 2.4)
3. **Nonviolence Pledge** (Section 2.5)

All three must be completed; order is flexible.

### 2.3 Security Vetting

**Purpose**

Security vetting ensures that CMS holders do not pose a security threat within MCF domains. It is not a political loyalty test.

**Scope**

Vetting covers:

- Criminal history (both parties' records, international databases)
- Security service records (both parties, with appropriate access agreements)
- Open-source review (social media, public statements)
- Reference verification (where applicable)

**Vetting Does Not Include**

- Political opinions or affiliations (unless linked to violence)
- Religious practice or belief
- Family members' status (except direct security relevance)
- Historical residence or travel (unless security-relevant)

**Conducting Authority**

- Vetting is conducted by a **CMS Vetting Unit** under MCF institutional authority
- Vetting Unit staff are international personnel (not party nationals)
- Vetting Unit may request information from parties but makes independent determinations
- Guarantors provide oversight of vetting standards and processes

**Vetting Process**

1. Applicant submits application with identity documentation
2. Vetting Unit conducts records check (target: 30 days)
3. If concerns arise, applicant is notified and may respond
4. Vetting Unit issues determination: Cleared, Denied, or Pending (with explanation)
5. Denied or Pending applicants may appeal (Section 2.7)

**Vetting Standards**

| Finding | Result |
|---------|--------|
| No disqualifying information | Cleared |
| Disqualifying conviction | Denied |
| Active security concern | Denied or Pending |
| Unverifiable identity | Pending (awaiting documentation); Denied after 90 days if not resolved |
| Minor concerns, mitigated | Cleared with notation |

**Pending Status Time Limits**

"Pending" determinations are subject to strict time limits:

| Pending Reason | Maximum Duration | Resolution |
|----------------|------------------|------------|
| Active security investigation | 180 days | Must resolve to Cleared or Denied |
| Awaiting additional documentation | 90 days | Denied if documentation not provided |
| Inter-agency consultation | 120 days | Must resolve to Cleared or Denied |

- Applicant receives written notification at 30, 60, and 90 days with status update
- After maximum duration, Vetting Unit must issue final determination (Cleared or Denied)
- Applicant may appeal continued Pending status after 90 days using standard appeal process (Section 2.7)
- Guarantor ombudsman may intervene if Pending status exceeds 180 days without resolution

### 2.4 Civic Education Curriculum

**Purpose**

Civic education ensures CMS holders understand:

- MCF framework, institutions, and their rights and obligations
- Practical procedures for accessing benefits and reporting problems
- The context of coexistence without requiring agreement on narratives

**Curriculum Content**

The curriculum covers (approximately 20 hours total):

| Module | Content | Hours |
|--------|---------|-------|
| MCF Overview | Framework purpose, phases, institutions | 3 |
| CMS Rights and Obligations | What CMS provides and requires | 3 |
| Practical Procedures | How to access benefits, report issues, seek help | 4 |
| Conflict Context | Factual presentation of conflict history (multiple narratives acknowledged) | 4 |
| Coexistence Skills | Communication, de-escalation, cross-community interaction | 4 |
| Assessment | Knowledge verification | 2 |

**Curriculum Principles**

- **Narrative neutrality**: Curriculum acknowledges contested narratives without endorsing any
- **Practical focus**: Emphasis on what CMS holders need to know to participate
- **Accessibility**: Available in Arabic, Hebrew, and English; accommodations for disabilities
- **No indoctrination**: Curriculum does not require accepting any political position

**Delivery Methods**

- In-person courses at MCF facilities
- Online self-paced modules with proctored assessment
- Community-based delivery through certified organizations
- Hybrid formats combining online and in-person elements

**Assessment**

- Written or oral assessment (applicant choice)
- Pass threshold: 70% on knowledge components
- Unlimited retakes permitted (after 7-day waiting period)
- Assessment focuses on practical knowledge, not political views

### 2.5 Nonviolence Pledge

**Purpose**

The nonviolence pledge establishes a behavioral commitment as a condition of CMS participation. It is a commitment to act, not a statement of belief.

**Pledge Text**

> I pledge that while holding Civic Membership Status:
>
> 1. I will not use violence against any person within MCF domains except in immediate self-defense or defense of others from imminent physical harm.
>
> 2. I will not plan, assist, finance, or encourage violence against any person within MCF domains.
>
> 3. I will not use my CMS status or MCF access to facilitate violence or harm to others.
>
> 4. I will report credible threats of violence that I become aware of through MCF channels. (See Threat Reporting Protections below.)
>
> 5. I understand that violation of this pledge may result in CMS suspension or revocation.
>
> This pledge applies to my conduct within MCF domains and programs. It does not alter my rights or obligations under national law outside MCF domains.

**Threat Reporting Protections**

CMS holders who report threats under pledge item 4 receive:

- **Confidentiality**: Reporter identity protected from disclosure; reports anonymized before any external sharing
- **Safe harbor**: Good-faith reports cannot be grounds for CMS action, even if threat proves unfounded
- **Retaliation protection**: Retaliation against reporters is a high-severity Anti-Intimidation violation
- **No obligation to self-incriminate**: Reporting requirement does not compel disclosure of information that would expose reporter to criminal liability

**Imminent Threat Exception**: When MCF receives a threat report indicating imminent risk to life (attack expected within 72 hours), MCF may share actionable threat information with relevant authorities without reporter identity and without holder consent. This exception is narrowly construed: only the specific threat information necessary to prevent harm may be shared.

**Scope of Pledge**

The pledge applies to:

- Conduct within MCF programs and facilities
- Conduct affecting other CMS holders
- Conduct within SAZs (Phase 2+)
- Use of MCF benefits or credentials

The pledge does not apply to:

- Conduct entirely outside MCF domains
- Lawful self-defense under applicable law
- Political speech or advocacy (unless inciting imminent violence)
- Actions required by national law (though such actions may trigger CMS review)

**Pledge Administration**

- Pledge is signed as part of CMS application
- Pledge is renewed with each CMS renewal
- Pledge text is provided in applicant's language of choice
- Applicant may ask questions before signing

### 2.6 Application Process

**Application Submission**

1. Applicant obtains application form (online, at MCF facilities, through partner organizations)
2. Applicant provides:
   - Identity documentation (ID card, passport, or UNRWA registration)
   - Contact information

## 4. CMS Benefits

### 4.1 Benefits Overview

CMS holders gain access to benefits that grow over MCF phases:

| Phase | Benefits |
|-------|----------|
| Phase 1 | Employment access, dispute resolution (Commercial Courts primary; arbitration by agreement), due process, credential portability |
| Phase 2 | SAZ residency eligibility, civic dividends, enhanced services |
| Phase 3 | Expanded political participation in convergence processes |

### 4.2 Employment Access

**Protected Employment Programs**

CMS holders may participate in MCF-facilitated employment:

- Wage and labor protection under MCF standards
- Dispute resolution through [Confederal Commercial Courts](../07-economic-architecture/03-commercial-courts.md) (primary) or arbitration (by explicit agreement)
- Protection from discrimination based on community origin

**Work Authorization**

MCF employment programs operate within a negotiated work authorization framework:

- Guarantors facilitate work permit arrangements with both parties as part of MCF establishment
- MCF-registered employers receive streamlined permit processing for CMS employees
- CMS credential serves as eligibility documentation for MCF employment permit applications
- Permits are issued under national authority but processed through MCF employment program
- See [Labor Mobility](../07-economic-architecture/02-labor-mobility.md) for detailed permit procedures

*Note: CMS alone does not authorize employment; CMS holders must obtain applicable work permits through the MCF employment program. MCF facilitates but does not override national work authorization requirements.*

**Employment Protections**

CMS holders in MCF-facilitated employment receive:

- Minimum wage guarantees (set by MCF, pegged to regional standards)
- Working hour limits and rest requirements
- Health and safety standards
- Protection from arbitrary termination

### 4.3 Dispute Resolution Access

CMS holders have access to MCF dispute resolution forums:

**Commercial Courts (Primary Forum):**

See: [Arbitration Courts](../05-dispute-resolution/01-arbitration-courts.md)

**Forum Priority:** For commercial and labor disputes, Commercial Courts are the primary forum. Arbitration is available only by explicit party agreement (contract clause or post-dispute mutual consent).
