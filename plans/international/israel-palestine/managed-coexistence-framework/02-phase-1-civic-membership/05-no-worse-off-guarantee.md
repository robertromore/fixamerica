## 1. Guarantee Principles

### 1.1 Core Commitment

The No Worse Off Guarantee ensures that **participation in MCF creates upside-only optionality**:

| Scenario | Guarantee |
|----------|-----------|
| **Never participate** | Framework cannot reduce existing legal status, material conditions, or security |
| **Participate then withdraw** | Withdrawal returns individual to same baseline as if never participated |
| **Participate continuously** | Benefits accrue; withdrawal option always available |

### 1.2 Why This Guarantee Is Essential

Without the No Worse Off Guarantee, MCF faces critical vulnerabilities:

| Risk | Consequence Without Guarantee |
|------|------------------------------|
| **Coercion perception** | Participation seen as coerced if non-participation is penalized |
| **Exit deterrence** | People who want to leave feel trapped |
| **Opposition weaponization** | Critics can point to "punishment" for non-participation |
| **Trust collapse** | Initial participants fear they're creating a trap |

**The guarantee is not just ethical—it's operationally essential for voluntary participation.**

### 1.3 Guarantee as Design Constraint

The guarantee operates as a **hard constraint** on MCF design:

- No MCF program may be structured to penalize non-participation
- No benefit may be conditioned on irreversible commitment
- No data may be used to disadvantage former participants
- No messaging may frame non-participation as disloyalty

### 1.4 Relationship to Incentive Structure

The guarantee and incentive structure are **complementary, not contradictory**:

| Incentive Structure | No Worse Off Guarantee |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| Creates benefits for participation | Prohibits penalties for non-participation |
| Rewards sustained commitment | Protects right to withdraw |
| Compounds value over time | Preserves accrued benefits upon exit |

Together, they create **asymmetric optionality**: participation can improve conditions but cannot worsen them.

## 2. Guarantee Scope

### 2.1 Who Is Covered

| Category | Coverage |
|----------|----------|
| **Eligible non-participants** | Full protection; cannot be harmed by MCF existence |
| **Active participants** | Full protection; can withdraw at any time |
| **Former participants (voluntary withdrawal)** | Full protection; treated externally as if never participated (see note below) |
| **Former participants (revocation/issues)** | Protection from external disclosure; re-application per Section 5.5 |
| **Family members** | Protected from retaliation based on family member's participation |
| **Employers** | Cannot be penalized for employing participants or non-participants |

**Note on "treated as if never participated":** For voluntary withdrawals, MCF does not disclose participation history externally, and former participants face no external penalties or differential treatment. MCF retains internal records (sealed audit data) per retention schedules for fraud prevention and accountability, but this data is non-disclosable and cannot be used for **external adverse action** (employment, legal status, service access, etc.). Internal MCF eligibility restrictions (re-application waiting periods for revocations, fraud exclusions) are not "adverse action" under this guarantee—they are consequences of specific conduct, not participation itself. See Section 8 for data handling details.

### 2.2 What Is Guaranteed

#### 2.2.1 Status Protections

| Protection | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Legal status** | No change to citizenship, residency, or legal standing |
| **Security status** | No enhanced surveillance, profiling, or targeting |
| **Administrative status** | No adverse annotation in government records |
| **Social status** | No official framing as disloyal or suspicious |

#### 2.2.2 Material Protections

| Protection | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Economic access** | No loss of employment, business, or economic opportunity |
| **Service access** | No reduction in government or public services |
| **Movement access** | No new restrictions on movement or travel |
| **Documentation** | No loss of documents or credentials |

#### 2.2.3 Information Protections

| Protection | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Confidentiality** | Participation history not disclosed externally without consent |
| **Non-inference** | Participation history not used to infer disloyalty |
| **Data deletion** | Right to data deletion after applicable retention periods (see [CMS Framework Section 7](01-cms-framework.md#7-data-and-privacy)) |
| **Record neutrality** | No adverse annotation in external records; internal audit data sealed and non-disclosable |

### 2.3 Temporal Scope

The guarantee operates:

- **Prospectively**: From MCF establishment forward
- **During participation**: Continuous protection while participating
- **Upon withdrawal**: Immediate reversion to non-participant baseline
- **Permanently**: No future use of participation history against former participants

### 2.4 Geographic Scope

The guarantee applies:

- **Within MCF domains**: Full enforcement authority
- **Within party jurisdictions**: Monitoring and advocacy; enforcement through guarantors
- **Internationally**: Documentation and reporting; guarantor diplomatic support

---

## 3. Baseline Establishment

### 3.1 Why Baselines Matter

The guarantee promises no worsening "compared to what." Establishing clear baselines prevents:

- Disputes about what conditions existed before MCF
- Manipulation of baseline definitions
- Unfounded claims of guarantee violation

### 3.2 Pre-Framework Baseline Documentation

#### 3.2.1 Population-Level Baselines

MCF documents population-level conditions at framework launch:

| Category | Documentation |
|----------|---------------|
| **Legal framework** | Laws, regulations, policies affecting population |
| **Economic conditions** | Employment, income, access statistics |
| **Service access** | Healthcare, education, utilities availability |
| **Movement regime** | Permits, restrictions, access patterns |
| **Security environment** | Incident rates, enforcement patterns |

#### 3.2.2 Documentation Standards

- Neutral, third-party documentation where possible
- Multi-source verification
- Timestamped and archived
- Publicly accessible (with privacy protections)
- Updated periodically

### 3.3 Individual Baseline Assessment

For participants, individual baseline is documented:

| Element | Documentation | Purpose |
|---------|---------------|---------|
| **Legal status** | Citizenship, residency, permits at enrollment | Verify no change upon withdrawal |
| **Employment** | Job, income, benefits at enrollment | Compare upon withdrawal |
| **Service access** | Services accessible at enrollment | Verify continued access |
| **Documentation** | Documents held at enrollment | Verify no loss |

### 3.4 Baseline Dispute Resolution

When disputes arise about baseline conditions:

```text
BASELINE DISPUTE PROCESS

Claim: Individual claims baseline was different than documented

Step 1: Evidence Review
├── MCF baseline documentation
├── Individual-provided evidence
├── Third-party verification where available
└── Contemporaneous records

Step 2: Assessment
├── If MCF documentation error: Correct documentation
├── If individual claim unsupported: Explain decision
├── If genuinely unclear: Apply benefit of the doubt to individual

Step 3: Resolution
├── Adjust baseline if warranted
├── Document decision and reasoning
└── Apply adjusted baseline to guarantee assessment
```

---

## 4. Non-Participant Protections

### 4.1 Prohibition on New Restrictions

MCF's existence cannot be accompanied by new restrictions that disadvantage non-participants **with respect to pre-existing services and conditions**:

| Prohibited | Example | Clarification |
|------------|---------|---------------|
| **Conditional access to pre-existing services** | Healthcare, education, utilities conditioned on CMS | MCF-created programs (employment facilitation, civic dividends) may be CMS-only |
| **Preferential treatment in existing services** | Non-participants deprioritized for pre-MCF services | MCF-funded new services may prioritize participants |
| **New requirements for existing access** | Permits required only for non-CMS to access pre-existing services | CMS requirements for MCF-specific programs are permitted |
| **Indirect pressure** | Employers pressured to hire only CMS holders | Employer participation in MCF employment programs is voluntary |

**Key Distinction:** The guarantee protects non-participants from losing access to what they had before MCF. It does **not** require that MCF-created benefits be extended to non-participants. MCF may create new programs (employment facilitation, training, civic dividends, SAZ residency) available only to CMS holders—this is the incentive structure, not a penalty for non-participation. See [Incentive Structure](04-incentive-structure.md) for CMS-specific benefits.

### 4.1a Relative Deprivation and Community Spillovers

**Acknowledged Dynamic:** As MCF matures and CMS-linked economic activity grows, non-participants may experience **relative deprivation** even without absolute degradation. If the best employment programs, functioning commercial courts, credential portability, and (in Phase 2) SAZ residency and civic dividends are all CMS-linked, non-participation becomes an increasingly costly choice regardless of the guarantee's technical provisions.

This is a design tradeoff, not an oversight. Incentive structures require differential benefits—if participation offered no advantage, there would be no reason to participate and accept the associated risks. The question is whether the resulting economic divergence creates an untenable social dynamic.

**How MCF Differs from Historical Collaborator-Class Dynamics:**

MCF's structure differs fundamentally from historical models (such as the 1980s Village Leagues) that created stigmatized collaborator classes:

| Factor | Village Leagues | MCF |
|--------|----------------|-----|
| **Governance role** | Proxy governance on behalf of occupying power | No proxy role; CMS holders have no security or governance function |
| **Voluntary character** | Coerced participation for access to permits and employment | Fully voluntary; no penalty for non-participation |
| **Security function** | Participants served as informants and enforcement auxiliaries | No security function; anti-intimidation protections for participants |
| **Identity** | Public identification with occupying power | Layered confidentiality; participation can be private |
| **Benefit distribution** | Benefits flowed only to collaborators | Community spillover benefits designed for all residents (see below) |

**Community Spillover Mitigations:**

To reduce the perception of a privileged class and ensure MCF success benefits non-participants:

1. **PCC infrastructure benefits all users.** Protected Civic Corridors carry utilities, medical transport, and commercial goods that serve all residents of the operational area, not just CMS holders
2. **MCF-funded medical facilities serve all patients.** Healthcare infrastructure funded through MCF economic activity operates on a universal basis within the service area
3. **Employer participation improves workplace standards broadly.** Employers participating in MCF employment programs adopt MCF labor standards that apply to all workers, not just CMS holders
4. **Community Development Fund.** A defined percentage of MCF economic activity revenue funds a Community Development Fund accessible regardless of CMS status, supporting local infrastructure, education, and health improvements. This allows CMS holders to frame participation as contributing to collective community benefit, not personal enrichment at others' expense

See [Incentive Structure Section 10.2a](04-incentive-structure.md#102a-community-spillover-design) for implementation details.

### 4.2 Existing Service Preservation

Non-participants retain access to:

| Service | Guarantee |
|---------|-----------|
| **Healthcare** | Same access as before MCF |
| **Education** | Same access as before MCF |
| **Utilities** | Same access as before MCF |
| **Government services** | Same access as before MCF |
| **Employment** | Same access as before MCF |

### 4.3 Protection from Indirect Coercion

Indirect coercion prohibited:

| Coercion Type | Prohibition |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Social pressure** | MCF may not organize pressure campaigns |
| **Employer pressure** | MCF may not pressure employers to favor participants |
| **Family pressure** | MCF may not communicate with family to pressure participation |
| **Economic pressure** | MCF may not structure economy to disadvantage non-participants |

### 4.4 Non-Participant Monitoring

MCF monitors non-participant conditions:

| Monitoring | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| **Service access audits** | Verify no degradation |
| **Economic indicators** | Track non-participant economic conditions |
| **Complaint channels** | Receive reports of guarantee violations |
| **Survey sampling** | Regular assessment of non-participant conditions |
| **Institutional capacity indicators** | Track PA/municipal institutional staffing and service quality (see below) |

### 4.4a Institutional Capacity Monitoring

The No Worse Off guarantee protects individual access to pre-existing services. However, MCF wage differentials may gradually drain skilled professionals from PA and municipal institutions (see [Labor Mobility](../07-economic-architecture/02-labor-mobility.md)), degrading service quality even if formal access is preserved. To prevent the guarantee from becoming hollow, MCF monitors institutional capacity in operational areas:

**Indicators Tracked:**

| Indicator | Source | Frequency |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **Hospital staffing levels** | PA Ministry of Health; facility reports | Quarterly |
| **Teacher-student ratios** | PA Ministry of Education; school reports | Annual |
| **Ministry vacancy rates** | PA civil service data | Quarterly |
| **UNRWA staffing** | UNRWA reports (where applicable) | Annual |
| **Municipal service quality** | Survey sampling of non-participants | Annual |

**Threshold and Response:**

If institutional capacity in MCF operational areas degrades beyond baseline by >15% on any indicator:

1. MCF documents the degradation and assesses MCF contribution to the trend
2. If MCF activity is a significant contributing factor, mitigation obligations activate:
    - Human Capital Replacement Levy collection increases (see [Incentive Structure Section 10.2b](04-incentive-structure.md))
    - Rotation secondment program expanded
    - CDF allocation to institutional support increased
3. Guarantor states increase PA institutional capacity support in development assistance
4. MCF Annual Report includes institutional capacity assessment

## 5. Withdrawal Protections

### 5.1 Right to Withdraw

Withdrawal is an **absolute right**:

- No justification required
- No cooling-off period
- No counseling or discouragement
- No retention efforts beyond neutral information
- **Legally effective upon request** (benefits cease, CMS credential deactivated); administrative processing completes within 7 days

### 5.2 Withdrawal Process

```text
WITHDRAWAL PROCESS

Step 1: Request (immediate legal effect)
├── Written or verbal request to any MCF facility
├── No justification required
├── Confirmation of identity
├── Acknowledgment of request
└── CMS status legally terminated upon acknowledgment

Step 2: Administrative Processing (target: 7 days)
├── CMS credential deactivated in systems
├── Benefit wind-down initiated
├── Data handling procedures triggered
└── Exit information package provided

Step 3: Data Handling
├── Contact information and active benefit data: deleted immediately
├── Internal audit record: sealed (non-disclosable, internal use only)
├── Identity/vetting/proceedings data: retained per retention schedule, then deleted
└── Upon retention period expiry: holder may request full deletion

Step 4: Confirmation
├── Written confirmation of withdrawal
├── List of any retained data (with retention periods and justification)
├── Contact for future questions
└── Re-application rights confirmed
```

### 5.3 Status Upon Withdrawal

| Element | Status After Withdrawal |
|---------|------------------------|
| **Legal status** | Unchanged from pre-participation |
| **MCF internal records** | Sealed audit record (non-disclosable; for fraud prevention and accountability only) |
| **External records** | No disclosure of participation history; treated externally as if never participated |
| **Party government records** | No notification of withdrawal; no disclosure of CMS history |
| **Employment** | No notification to employers |
| **Benefits** | Cease; no clawback of accrued benefits |
| **Credentials** | Retained; recognized regardless of CMS status |

**Sealed Audit Record:** MCF retains a sealed internal record of former participants for audit, fraud prevention, and accountability purposes. This record is: (1) non-disclosable to external parties under any circumstances; (2) accessible only to internal audit personnel and guarantor oversight; (3) cannot be used for **external** adverse action against the former participant (employment, legal status, service access, government records); (4) deleted after the longest applicable retention period expires (see Section 8.2).

*Note: The sealed audit record **may** be used for internal MCF purposes including re-application eligibility determination (waiting periods for revocations, fraud exclusions). This is not "adverse action" under the guarantee—it is a consequence of specific conduct during participation, not of participation itself.*

### 5.4 No Retroactive Clawback

Benefits accrued during participation are **not clawed back** upon withdrawal:

| Benefit Type | Upon Withdrawal |
|--------------|-----------------|
| **Wages earned** | Retained |
| **Credentials earned** | Retained and recognized |
| **Training completed** | Retained |
| **Property acquired** | Retained |
| **Credit history built** | Retained |
| **Networks developed** | Retained |

**Exception**: Benefits obtained through fraud may be subject to clawback through due process.

### 5.5 Re-Application Rights

Former participants may re-apply:

| Scenario | Re-Application | External Treatment |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Voluntary withdrawal** | No waiting period; standard process | Treated externally as if never participated |
| **Withdrawal with issues** | May have waiting period based on issues | No external disclosure; internal record for re-application only |
| **Revocation for cause** | Waiting period per [CMS Framework Section 6](01-cms-framework.md#6-withdrawal-and-revocation) | No external disclosure; waiting period applies |
| **Fraud** | Permanent or extended exclusion | No external disclosure; exclusion documented internally |

**Clarification:** "Treated as if never participated" applies to **voluntary withdrawals** with respect to external disclosure and external treatment. Waiting periods and re-application restrictions for revocation or issues are internal MCF matters that do not affect external legal status, employment, or service access—they affect only re-enrollment eligibility within MCF.
