## 1. Incentive Philosophy

### 1.1 Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Compounding over time** | Benefits increase with sustained participation; loyalty rewarded |
| **Opt-in design** | All participation voluntary; no coercion or penalty for abstention |
| **Upside-only optionality** | Participation can improve conditions; cannot make them worse |
| **Material foundation** | Incentives are concrete and material, not merely symbolic |
| **Asymmetric risk** | Participants bear minimal risk; framework bears implementation risk |

### 1.2 Why Material Incentives Matter

MCF cannot rely on ideological commitment alone:

| Challenge | Incentive Response |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Participation is risky** | Benefits must outweigh perceived risks |
| **Trust is absent** | Material benefits are verifiable; trust builds through delivery |
| **Opposition is organized** | Participants need tangible reasons to resist pressure |
| **Time horizon is long** | Benefits must be immediate enough to sustain engagement |

**The calculus for participation must be individually rational, not dependent on collective optimism.**

### 1.3 Compounding vs. One-Time Benefits

| Benefit Type | Example | Effect |
|--------------|---------|--------|
| **One-time** | Initial signing bonus | Attracts initial interest; no sustained incentive |
| **Recurring** | Monthly wage supplement | Sustains participation; vulnerable to interruption |
| **Compounding** | Seniority-based benefits, credential accumulation | Increases value of continued participation over time |

MCF emphasizes **compounding benefits** that make departure increasingly costly in opportunity terms (not penalty terms).

### 1.4 Relationship to No Worse Off Guarantee

The incentive structure operates within the No Worse Off Guarantee:

- **Participation**: Access to benefits
- **Non-participation**: No penalty; no loss of pre-existing conditions
- **Withdrawal**: Reversion to non-participant baseline; no clawback of accrued benefits

See [No Worse Off Guarantee](05-no-worse-off-guarantee.md) for guarantee implementation.

## 2. Phase 0 Benefits

Phase 0 benefits accrue to **all residents** of MCF operational areas, regardless of individual participation status. They demonstrate framework value before requiring individual commitment.

### 2.1 Physical Safety

| Benefit | Mechanism | Measurement |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Reduced incident frequency** | Shock-absorber protocols prevent escalation | Incident rate per capita |
| **Reliable emergency response** | JSVC coordination ensures rapid containment | Response time statistics |
| **De-escalation predictability** | Pre-negotiated response ladders | Escalation-to-containment ratio |
| **Attribution credibility** | JSVC verification reduces false claims | Attribution acceptance rates |

**Value proposition**: Life is safer and more predictable under MCF than under ad hoc conflict management.

### 2.2 Medical Access

| Benefit | Mechanism | Measurement |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Medical supply reliability** | Medical PCC ensures consistent supply chains | Supply availability rates |
| **Patient transfer access** | Protected medical transfers across lines | Transfer completion rates |
| **Emergency treatment** | Medical PCC absolute protection | Emergency response availability |
| **Chronic care continuity** | Reduced disruption to ongoing treatment | Treatment interruption rates |

**Value proposition**: Healthcare access becomes reliable regardless of political conditions.

### 2.3 Infrastructure Reliability

| Benefit | Mechanism | Measurement |
|---------|-----------|-------------|

**Value proposition**: Daily life functions reliably; economic planning becomes possible.

### 2.4 Phase 0 Benefit Distribution

Phase 0 benefits are **universal** within operational areas:

- No registration required
- No individual tracking
- Benefits flow from institutional performance
- Success measured at population level

This universality demonstrates MCF value before asking for individual commitment.

### 4.2 Civic Dividends

#### 4.2.1 Dividend Concept

SAZ residents share in economic returns from MCF programs:

| Source | Distribution Mechanism |
|--------|------------------------|
| **Economic activity taxes** | Per-capita distribution to residents |
| **MCF enterprise revenues** | Community investment fund |
| **Infrastructure value appreciation** | Long-term resident benefits |
| **Guarantor development funds** | Community-selected projects |

#### 4.2.2 Dividend Calculation

```text
ANNUAL CIVIC DIVIDEND

Base Component: Fixed amount per resident ($X)
├── Equal for all SAZ residents regardless of income

Duration Component: Multiplier based on SAZ residency length
├── Year 1: 1.0x
├── Year 2-3: 1.1x
├── Year 4-5: 1.2x
├── Year 6+: 1.3x (maximum)

Need Adjustment: Supplemental for qualifying households
├── Based on household composition and income
├── Ensures minimum living standard
```

**Note on Multiplier Basis:** Civic dividend multipliers are calculated using **SAZ residency length** (time as resident within an SAZ), not CMS tenure. This differs from other seniority benefits (employment priority, training access, credit terms) which use CMS tenure. The distinction reflects that civic dividends are a return on SAZ-specific investment, while other seniority benefits reward overall MCF participation. See Section 6.1 for CMS-based seniority multipliers and Annex B for the combined reference table.

#### 4.2.3 Community Investment

Portion of civic dividends directed to community-selected projects:

- Infrastructure improvements
- Public spaces and amenities
- Educational facilities
- Healthcare access points
- Cultural and recreational facilities

Residents participate in project selection through participatory budgeting.

### 4.3 Enhanced Services

| Service | SAZ Standard | Non-SAZ Comparison |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| **Healthcare** | Integrated delivery, no cross-community barriers | Fragmented, access barriers |
| **Education** | Quality standards, credential recognition | Variable quality, recognition issues |
| **Utilities** | Reliable, maintained infrastructure | Variable reliability |
| **Public safety** | Community policing, CRC protections | Variable protection |
| **Administrative** | Streamlined, single-window services | Multiple bureaucracies |

### 4.4 Phase 2 Benefit Compounding

*Note: Duration refers to SAZ residency length for dividend-related benefits.*

| Duration | Accumulated Benefits |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Year 1** | SAZ residency, basic civic dividend (1.0x), enhanced services |
| **Year 2-3** | Increased dividend multiplier (1.1x), community participation |
| **Year 4-5** | Higher dividend multiplier (1.2x), housing assistance eligibility, priority services, governance participation eligibility |
| **Year 6+** | Maximum dividend multiplier (1.3x), long-term resident benefits, community leadership opportunities |

---

## 5. Phase 3 Benefits

Phase 3 benefits relate to **voluntary convergence** mechanisms—political agency expansion for populations that have demonstrated sustained commitment to coexistence.

### 5.1 Political Agency Expansion

| Benefit | Description | Prerequisite |

## 6. Benefit Compounding Mechanisms

### 6.1 Seniority System

CMS participation duration creates compounding value through a tiered multiplier system:

```text
BENEFIT SENIORITY LADDER (CMS-Based)

CMS Duration:
├── 0-2 years: Entry tier (1.0x)
├── 2-5 years: Established tier (1.2x)
├── 5-10 years: Senior tier (1.4x)
├── 10+ years: Veteran tier (1.6x maximum)

CMS-based multiplier applies to:
├── Employment priority
├── Training access
├── Credit terms
└── Governance eligibility
```

**Note:** Civic dividend multipliers use **SAZ residency length**, not CMS tenure (see Section 4.2.2). This reflects that dividends are returns on SAZ-specific residency, while other benefits reward overall CMS participation.

### 6.2 Credential Accumulation

Credentials earned under MCF create lasting value:

| Credential Type | Accumulation | Long-Term Value |
|-----------------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Education** | Degrees, certificates | Career advancement |
| **Professional** | Licenses, certifications | Employment options |
| **Training** | MCF program completion | Skill portfolio |
| **Experience** | Verified employment history | Reputation building |

Credentials are **portable** and **recognized** regardless of political conditions.

### 6.3 Relationship Networks

MCF participation builds cross-community networks:

| Network Type | Value | Durability |
|--------------|-------|------------|
| **Professional** | Business opportunities, referrals | Survives regression |
| **Educational** | Collaboration, mentorship | Long-term relationships |
| **Community** | Social support, shared experience | Resilient networks |

### 6.4 Economic Integration

Economic participation creates compounding integration:

| Integration Level | Mechanisms | Lock-In Effect |
|-------------------|------------|----------------|
| **Employment** | Salary, benefits, career progression | Job-specific investment |
| **Business** | Customer relationships, supply chains | Business continuity |
| **Investment** | Property, savings, pension | Asset accumulation |
| **Credit** | Credit history, relationship banking | Financial infrastructure |

## 7. Benefit Funding and Sustainability

### 7.1 Funding Sources

| Source | Contribution | Stability |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| **Guarantor commitments** | Multi-year pledged funding | High (treaty-bound) |
| **Economic activity** | Tax revenue from MCF programs | Growing over time |
| **User fees** | Program participation fees (where appropriate) | Moderate |
| **Development funds** | International development assistance | Variable |
| **Investment returns** | Endowment and reserve fund returns | Moderate |

### 7.2 Funding Architecture

```text
MCF BENEFIT FUNDING FLOW

├── Multi-year pledges
├── Disbursement per performance metrics
└── Reserve fund contribution

Economic Activity
├── Program revenues
├── Transaction fees

Distribution:
├── Phase 0 universal benefits (from general fund)
├── Phase 1 individual benefits (from program accounts)
├── Phase 2 SAZ benefits (from SAZ economic activity + transfers)
└── Reserve fund (for sustainability)
```

### 7.3 Sustainability Trajectory

| Phase | Funding Mix |
|-------|-------------|
| **Phase 0-1** | 70% guarantor, 20% development, 10% local |
| **Phase 1-2** | 50% guarantor, 25% development, 25% local |
| **Phase 2-3** | 30% guarantor, 20% development, 50% local |
| **Mature** | 10% guarantor (reserve), 10% development, 80% local |

**Goal**: Self-sustaining economic system by Phase 3 maturity.

### 7.4 Benefit Cost Management

| Mechanism | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Tiered eligibility** | Match benefit costs to participation commitment |
| **Means-testing (selected benefits)** | Concentrate resources on need |
| **Co-payment (selected services)** | Share costs with beneficiaries |
| **Efficiency requirements** | Regular program evaluation and optimization |
| **Sunset provisions** | Phase out transitional benefits as conditions normalize |

---

## 8. Equity and Cross-Community Balance

### 8.1 Balance Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Proportional benefit** | Benefits distributed in proportion to population |
| **Need-based adjustment** | Greater need receives greater support |
| **Equal access** | No discrimination in benefit eligibility |
| **Transparent allocation** | Benefit distribution publicly reported |

### 8.2 Cross-Community Monitoring

| Metric | Target | Monitoring |
|--------|--------|------------|
| **CMS enrollment ratio** | Reflects population ratio (±10%) | Quarterly |
| **Benefit utilization** | Similar rates across communities | Quarterly |
| **Employment distribution** | Proportional to labor force | Monthly |
| **SAZ residency** | Mixed communities per SAZ design | Annual |

### 8.3 Addressing Imbalances

**Threshold Framework:**

| Zone | Deviation | Response |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Acceptable** | ±10% or less | Normal monitoring, no intervention |
| **Warning** | 10-15% | Enhanced monitoring, preliminary assessment |
| **Intervention** | >15% | Formal imbalance response protocol triggered |

The two-tier threshold allows for natural variation within the ±10% target range, flags emerging concerns in the 10-15% warning zone, and triggers formal intervention only when imbalances exceed 15%.

When intervention threshold is exceeded:

```text
IMBALANCE RESPONSE PROTOCOL

Detection: Monitoring identifies >15% deviation from proportionality

Assessment:
├── Is deviation due to preferences? (No intervention needed)
├── Is deviation due to barriers? (Barrier removal)
├── Is deviation due to discrimination? (Enforcement)
└── Is deviation due to design? (Program adjustment)

Response:
├── Barrier removal: Targeted outreach, access improvement
├── Enforcement: CRC Review Panel, accountability measures
├── Program adjustment: Eligibility criteria, benefit design
└── Communication: Public explanation of imbalance and response
```

### 8.4 Regional Variation

Benefits may vary by region based on:

- Local economic conditions
- Cost of living differences
- Development status
- Security environment

Variation must be:

- Transparent and published
- Based on objective criteria
- Regularly reviewed
- Subject to equity audit
