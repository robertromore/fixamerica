# Guarantor Selection Criteria

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#external-guarantor-architecture)

**Phase:** All Phases

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## Purpose

Guarantor Selection Criteria define **who qualifies to serve as an external guarantor** for MCF and through what process guarantors are identified and approved.

The selection of guarantors is among the most consequential decisions in MCF architecture. Wrong choices—guarantors too weak to enforce, too conflicted to remain neutral, or too unreliable to sustain commitments—can doom the framework. Right choices create a credibility foundation that enables trust-building during periods when domestic trust remains fragile.

---

## Core Selection Principles

### 1. Credibility Over Power

Raw power matters less than credible commitment. A mid-sized state with genuine commitment to MCF success provides more value than a great power with divided attention or ulterior motives.

### 2. Diversity Over Homogeneity

A diverse guarantor coalition—across geography, political orientation, and relationship to parties—provides resilience against any single guarantor's defection and credibility with all MCF participants.

### 3. Capacity Plus Commitment

Capacity without commitment is unreliable. Commitment without capacity is ineffective. Both are required.

### 4. Neutrality With Stakes

Pure neutrality (no relationship to either party) may mean no stake in success. Ideal guarantors have relationships with both sides that give them incentive to see MCF succeed without giving either side undue influence.
