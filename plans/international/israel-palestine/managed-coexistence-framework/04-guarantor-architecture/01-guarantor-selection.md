# Guarantor Selection Criteria

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#external-guarantor-architecture)

**Phase:** All Phases

**Status:** Draft

---

## Purpose

Guarantor Selection Criteria define **who qualifies to serve as an external guarantor** for MCF and through what process guarantors are identified and approved.

The selection of guarantors is among the most consequential decisions in MCF architecture. Wrong choices—guarantors too weak to enforce, too conflicted to remain neutral, or too unreliable to sustain commitments—can doom the framework. Right choices create a credibility foundation that enables trust-building during periods when domestic trust remains fragile.

---

## Core Selection Principles

### 1. Credibility Over Power

Raw power matters less than credible commitment. A mid-sized state with genuine commitment to MCF success provides more value than a great power with divided attention or ulterior motives.

### 2. Diversity Over Homogeneity

A diverse guarantor coalition—across geography, political orientation, and relationship to parties—provides resilience against any single guarantor's defection and credibility with all MCF participants.

### 3. Capacity Plus Commitment

Capacity without commitment is unreliable. Commitment without capacity is ineffective. Both are required.

### 4. Neutrality With Stakes

Pure neutrality (no relationship to either party) may mean no stake in success. Ideal guarantors have relationships with both sides that give them incentive to see MCF succeed without giving either side undue influence.

## Guarantor Qualifications

### 1. Capacity Requirements

**Role-Based Application:** Capacity thresholds apply based on the guarantor's assigned roles:

| Role | Required Thresholds |
|------|---------------------|
| Primary funder | Full financial capacity (Section 1.1) |
| Security guarantor | Full security capacity (Section 1.2) |
| Verification provider | Technical capacity (Section 1.4); financial/security thresholds reduced |
| Diplomatic facilitator | Diplomatic capacity (Section 1.3); financial/security thresholds reduced |
| Regional legitimacy | Diplomatic capacity + regional presence; financial/security thresholds reduced |

Regional states (e.g., Jordan, Egypt) and neutral states (e.g., Norway) may not meet full financial/security thresholds but provide essential diplomatic, verification, or legitimacy functions. Their inclusion is evaluated against relevant role-specific requirements.

#### 1.1 Financial Capacity

**Minimum Requirements (for primary funding roles):**

| Capacity | Threshold | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| GDP | >$500 billion | Sustained funding without domestic strain |
| Credit rating | Investment grade | Reliable long-term commitments |
| Aid budget | >$1 billion annually | Demonstrated international commitment |
| Fiscal stability | Debt/GDP <120% | Capacity not compromised by domestic crisis |

**Demonstrated by:**
- Multi-year international funding commitments (previous track record)
- Stable development assistance budget
- Capacity to absorb funding shortfalls from other guarantors temporarily

#### 1.2 Security Capacity

**Minimum Requirements (for security guarantor roles):**

| Capacity | Threshold | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Deployable forces | Battalion-level (500+) | Rapid response capability |
| Power projection | Regional capability | Can reach MCF territory |
| Peacekeeping experience | 5+ missions | Demonstrated capacity |
| Sustainability | 12+ month deployment | Not just initial response |

**Demonstrated by:**
- Participation in UN peacekeeping operations
- Regional security commitments
- Training and equipment adequate for contested environments

#### 1.3 Diplomatic Capacity

**Minimum Requirements:**
- Relations with both Israel and Palestine (or capacity to establish)
- Regional diplomatic presence
- Multilateral engagement (UN, regional organizations)
- Conflict mediation experience

**Demonstrated by:**
- Embassy or equivalent in both territories
- Track record in conflict mediation
- Reputation for diplomatic reliability

#### 1.4 Technical Capacity

**Minimum Requirements:**
- Verification expertise (arms control, elections, human rights)

- Administrative capacity (program management, institution building)

**Demonstrated by:**
- Technical assistance programs
- Election observation experience
- Human rights monitoring capacity

### 2. Independence Requirements

#### 2.0 Categorical Exclusions

The following entities **cannot serve as guarantors**:

| Excluded Entity | Rationale |
|-----------------|-----------|
| Israel | Conflict party |
| Palestine (PA, PLO, or successor) | Conflict party |
| States with mutual defense treaty with either party | Cannot be neutral enforcer |
| States hosting significant military bases of either party | Operational conflict of interest |
| States under sanctions by either party | Cannot engage both sides |

**Note:** "Immediate allies" (e.g., states with mutual defense obligations) are excluded because guarantor enforcement authority may require action against a party, which treaty obligations would prohibit or complicate.

#### 2.1 Relationship to Parties

**Balance Requirements:**
- No security alliance exclusive to one party
- No territorial claims involving either party
- No active conflict with either party
- Diplomatic relations with both (or capacity to establish)

**Acceptable:**
- Historic relationships with one party (if balanced by commitment to both)
- Arms sales to one party (if within limits and disclosed)
- Political alignment preferences (if not precluding fair dealing)

**Disqualifying:**
- Active military conflict with either party
- Formal security guarantee exclusive to one party without balancing commitment
- Territorial claims overlapping MCF territory
- Sanctions or non-recognition of either party

#### 2.2 Conflict of Interest Limits

**Conflicts Requiring Disclosure:**
- Arms sales to either party
- Trade dependencies on either party
- Diaspora populations with strong political positions
- Religious institutional connections

**Conflicts Requiring Recusal from Specific Decisions:**
- Direct economic interest in outcome
- Institutional involvement in disputed matters
- Personnel conflicts

**Conflicts Disqualifying Guarantor Status:**
- Documented interference in MCF processes
- Use of guarantor position for unrelated political leverage
- Persistent bias demonstrated in verification or enforcement

#### 2.3 Neutrality Standards

**What Neutrality Requires:**
- Even-handed engagement with both communities
- Verification findings based on evidence, not politics
- Enforcement actions applied consistently
- Public communications balanced

**What Neutrality Does Not Require:**
- Moral equivalence between all positions
- Silence on violations
- Acceptance of all outcomes
- Abandonment of own values

### 3. Commitment Requirements

#### 3.1 Duration Commitments

**Minimum Commitment Periods:**

| Phase | Minimum Commitment |
|-------|-------------------|
| Phase 0 | 10 years |
| Phase 1-2 | 15 years |
| Full MCF | 25 years |

**Commitment Demonstrated By:**
- Treaty-level undertaking
- Legislative authorization (where required)
- Multi-administration continuity (track record)
- Institutional embedment (not personal commitment of leaders)

#### 3.2 Resource Commitments

**Minimum Resource Pledges:**
- Financial: Specific annual contribution commitment
- Personnel: Minimum staffing for assigned functions
- Security: Force commitment for assigned contingencies
- Technical: Expert deployment for assigned functions

**Resource Commitment Verification:**
- Annual verification of actual vs. pledged resources
- Advance notice of shortfalls
- Contingency coverage arrangements

#### 3.3 Political Sustainability

**Assessment Factors:**
- Domestic political support for MCF involvement
- Cross-party consensus (not dependent on single party in power)
- Public awareness and support
- Institutional embedding (foreign ministry, defense, etc.)

**Red Flags:**
- Commitment dependent on single political leader
- Significant domestic opposition to involvement
- History of abandoning international commitments
- Politicization of international engagements

## Guarantor Types

### 1. State Guarantors

#### 1.1 Major Power Involvement

**Why Major Powers Matter:**
- Credibility through capability
- Deterrence of external interference
- Financial capacity
- Diplomatic weight

**Major Power Considerations:**

- US, China, potentially Russia
- None individually essential if others present
- Major power involvement adds deterrence
- Major power rivalries can complicate coordination
- Note: EU has major power capacity but is classified as a regional organization (see Section 2.2)

**Major Power Limitations:**
- Global distractions may reduce attention
- Domestic politics may shift commitment
- Rivalry among major powers can infect MCF
- Over-reliance on any single major power is risky

#### 1.2 Regional State Involvement

**Why Regional States Matter:**
- Proximity enables rapid response
- Regional credibility with parties
- Understanding of local dynamics
- Sustained interest in regional stability

**Potential Regional Guarantors:**
- Jordan, Egypt (existing relationships with both sides)
- Saudi Arabia, UAE (normalization context)
- Turkey (complex but influential)
- Morocco (post-normalization)

**Regional State Considerations:**
- Own interests in outcome
- Domestic political constraints
- Relationships with factions
- Capacity limitations

#### 1.3 Neutral State Involvement

**Why Neutral States Matter:**
- Credibility as honest brokers
- No ulterior motives
- Experience with mediation
- Moral authority

**Potential Neutral Guarantors:**
- Norway, Sweden, Finland (Nordic model)
- Switzerland (neutrality tradition)
- Singapore (successful multiethnic state)
- Japan (reconstruction expertise)

**Neutral State Considerations:**
- May lack enforcement capacity
- Limited stakes may reduce commitment
- Distance may limit engagement
- Smaller capacity

### 2. International Organizations

#### 2.1 UN Agencies

**UN Roles:**
- UNRWA (refugee expertise, local presence)
- UNDP (development programming)
- OHCHR (human rights monitoring)
- UN Secretariat (coordination, good offices)

**UN Advantages:**
- Legitimacy
- Institutional continuity
- Specialized expertise
- Established presence

**UN Limitations:**
- Security Council politics may paralyze action
- Bureaucratic constraints
- Limited enforcement capacity
- Funding dependencies

#### 2.2 Regional Organizations

**Potential Roles:**

- EU (major funding, institutional support, diplomatic weight)
- Arab League (regional legitimacy)
- African Union (peacekeeping experience)
- OSCE (verification expertise)

**EU as Major Power Capacity:** The EU is a regional organization, not a state, but possesses major power capacity (financial resources, diplomatic weight, institutional continuity). For composition targets, EU satisfies the "organization with major power capacity" requirement rather than the "state major power" requirement.

**Regional Organization Considerations:**

- Collective action problems
- Member state politics
- Capacity variations
- Mandate limitations

#### 2.3 Specialized Bodies

**Potential Roles:**
- World Bank/IMF (economic development, technical assistance)
- ICRC (humanitarian, protection)
- ICC (accountability backstop)
- Specialized agencies (health, education, etc.)

**Specialized Body Considerations:**
- Narrow mandates
- Political constraints on action
- Dependence on state cooperation
- Limited enforcement

### 3. Non-State Actors

#### 3.1 NGO Roles

**Appropriate Roles:**
- Technical assistance
- Monitoring support
- Civil society capacity building
- Humanitarian delivery

**Limitations:**
- Cannot serve as principal guarantors
- No enforcement capacity
- Limited accountability mechanisms
- Variable quality

#### 3.2 Private Sector Roles

**Appropriate Roles:**
- Economic development investment
- Technical expertise
- Employment creation
- Infrastructure development

**Limitations:**
- Profit motive may conflict with MCF goals
- Limited accountability to MCF
- Not appropriate for governance functions
- Risk of capture

#### 3.3 Clear Exclusions

**Not Eligible as Guarantors:**
- Individual philanthropists (no institutional continuity)
- Religious institutions (perception of bias)
- Political parties (partisan)
- Commercial entities (profit motive)

## Selection Process

### 0. Initial Guarantor Selection

**Pre-Formation Context:** Before MCF institutions exist, the standard nomination/vetting process cannot operate because Guarantor Forum and Confederal Council have not been established.

**Initial Selection Path:**

| Stage | Activity | Authority | Duration |
|-------|----------|-----------|----------|
| 1 | Convening coalition proposes initial guarantor set | Lead convener(s), with parties invited to comment | — |
| 2 | UN Secretary-General endorses proposed set | UN SG | 30 days |
| 3 | Proposed guarantors confirm participation | Each proposed guarantor | 60 days |
| 4 | Initial Guarantor Forum convenes | Confirmed guarantors | — |
| 5 | Standard selection process governs all subsequent additions | Guarantor Forum + Confederal Council | Per Section 1-4 below |

**Initial Selection Requirements:**

- The initial guarantor set is proposed by the convening coalition (see [Introduction: Launch Sequence](../00-introduction.md#preconditions-and-launch-sequence)) and presented to Israel and the Palestinian authorities (Gaza and West Bank) for comment. Party objections are documented and considered but do not constitute a veto over initial guarantor composition. This is consistent with the framework's design principle that Phase 0 operates without requiring mutual consent.
- UN Secretary-General endorsement provides international legitimacy
- Minimum composition requirements (Section "Minimum Guarantor Requirements") must be met
- Once Initial Guarantor Forum convenes, it assumes authority for subsequent selections

**Design Note:** Earlier versions of this document required joint party approval of the initial guarantor set, which created a bilateral consent dependency at launch -- contradicting the framework's core principle of beginning without mutual agreement. The revised process allows parties to raise objections (which carry weight and are documented) without granting either party a veto over who monitors the conflict.

**Transition:** After Confederal Council is constituted (Phase 1), standard nomination and approval procedures apply for all new guarantor additions or changes.

### 1. Nomination Procedures

**Who Can Nominate (post-formation):**

| 4 | Guarantor Forum review | 30 days |
| 5 | Party consultation | 30 days |
| 6 | Final approval | 30 days |

**Vetting Authority:**
- Technical vetting: MCF Secretariat
