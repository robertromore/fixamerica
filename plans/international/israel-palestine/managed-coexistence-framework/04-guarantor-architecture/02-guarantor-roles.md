# Guarantor Roles and Limitations

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#external-guarantor-architecture)

**Phase:** All Phases

**Status:** Draft

---

## Purpose

Guarantor Roles and Limitations define **what guarantors can and cannot do** within the MCF architecture, ensuring they provide credibility without governance control.

The fundamental design principle is that guarantors provide the external credibility, enforcement capacity, and security backstop that MCF needs during low-trust phases—but they do not govern. MCF institutions retain operational autonomy. Guarantors are scaffolding, not structure.

---

## Core Role Principles

### 1. Credibility Without Control

Guarantors lend credibility to MCF processes—verification, enforcement, security—but do not control those processes. MCF institutions make decisions; guarantors verify, support, and backstop.

### 2. Capacity Without Dependency

Guarantor capacity supplements MCF capacity during development phases. The goal is MCF capacity growth, not permanent guarantor dependency.

### 3. Enforcement Without Governance

Guarantors can enforce the Constitutional Floor and respond to security threats, but they cannot set policy, appoint officials, or override democratic processes.

### 4. Presence Without Occupation

Guarantors may be present for specific functions, but their presence is limited, temporary, and subject to MCF invitation. This is not international administration or trusteeship.
