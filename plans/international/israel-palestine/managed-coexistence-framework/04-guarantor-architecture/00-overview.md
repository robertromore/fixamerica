# External Guarantor Architecture: Overview

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#external-guarantor-architecture)

**Applies To:** All Phases

**Objective:** Provide external credibility, enforcement capacity, and escape-valve mechanisms without granting governance control to outside actors.

---

## Purpose of This Section

This directory contains detailed implementation documents for the external guarantor system. Guarantors provide the **credibility bridge** that allows MCF to function during periods of low domestic trust.

Guarantors are explicitly **not governors**. They provide verification, enforcement backstops, and financial support—but MCF institutions retain operational autonomy.

## Guarantor Functions (from Introduction)

**What Guarantors Provide:**

- Verification credibility when domestic trust is low
- Financial commitment that survives domestic political cycles
- Enforcement backstop for Confederal Rights Compact
- External rapid-response capacity for SAZ security
- Diplomatic pressure on state-level spoilers

**What Guarantors Do NOT Provide:**

- Governance control over MCF institutions
- Veto power over domestic policy decisions
- Military occupation or territorial control
- Permanent presence requirements

---

## Funding Architecture Principles (from Introduction)

- Diversified funding sources to prevent single-donor capture
- Multi-year commitments insulated from annual political cycles
- Transparent allocation tied to verified outcomes
- Local economic integration to reduce aid dependency over time

---

## Relationship to State-Level Spoilers

Guarantors are the primary channel for responding to external interference. When MCF verification bodies document state-level sabotage, guarantors take action in their own domains:

- Diplomatic pressure
- Financial restrictions
- Arms interdiction
- Cyber countermeasures
- Regional security responses
