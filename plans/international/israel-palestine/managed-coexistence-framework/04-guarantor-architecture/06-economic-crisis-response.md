# Economic Crisis Response Framework

**Parent Document:** [03-funding-architecture.md](03-funding-architecture.md)

**Phase:** All Phases

**Objective:** Establish protocols for MCF institutional and operational continuity during severe economic shocks.

**Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope

### 1.1 Rationale

MCF's long-term viability depends on financial sustainability. Economic crises—whether global, regional, or local—can threaten MCF's ability to deliver services, maintain institutions, and fulfill commitments to participants. Without pre-planned crisis response protocols, economic shocks could trigger cascading failures that undermine years of progress.

This framework establishes:
- Early warning indicators for economic threats
- Graduated response levels
- Resource prioritization during crisis
- Stakeholder communication protocols
- Recovery pathways

### 1.2 Scope

**Covered Scenarios:**
- Global economic recession affecting donor capacity
- Regional economic crisis (Middle East/Gulf)
- Local economic collapse (Israeli or Palestinian economy)
- Currency crisis affecting MCF operations
- Hyperinflation in operating environment
- Trade disruption affecting economic programs
- Donor withdrawal or default
- Banking system failure affecting MCF accounts

**Not Covered:**
- Routine budget shortfalls (addressed in annual planning)
- Individual program underfunding (addressed in reallocation procedures)
- Security crises (see [01-risk-management.md](../08-operational-procedures/01-risk-management.md))
- Political crises not primarily economic (see [04-spoiler-response.md](../08-operational-procedures/04-spoiler-response.md))

### 1.3 Relationship to Other Frameworks

| Framework | Relationship |
|-----------|--------------|
| Funding Architecture | Crisis response draws on reserves and mechanisms established there |
| Risk Management | Economic crises may be triggered by or trigger other crisis types |
| Phase Regression | Severe economic crisis may trigger phase regression |
| Guarantor Withdrawal | Guarantor economic distress may trigger withdrawal provisions |

## 7. Recovery and Lessons Learned

### 7.1 Crisis Exit Criteria

**Criteria for De-escalation:**

| From → To | Criteria |
|-----------|----------|
| Crisis → Alert | Reserve >6 months; funding gap <15%; stable indicators 30 days |
| Alert → Warning | Reserve >7.5 months; funding gap <10%; stable indicators 45 days |
| Warning → Watch | Reserve >9 months; no funding gap; stable indicators 60 days |
| Watch → Normal | All indicators within normal range 90 days |

**Threshold Design Note:** De-escalation thresholds are set above entry thresholds (Crisis entry at <6 months; Crisis exit at >6 months) to prevent oscillation between levels. Each level requires a meaningful buffer above its entry threshold before de-escalation is permitted.

### 7.2 Recovery Planning

**Immediate Recovery (0-6 months post-crisis):**
- Reserve replenishment priority
- Staff recovery and hiring
- Program reactivation planning
- Partner relationship restoration
- Lessons learned review

**Medium-term Recovery (6-24 months):**
- Full program restoration
- Deferred investments resumed
- New initiatives considered
- Resilience improvements implemented
- Donor relationship rebuilding

**Long-term Strengthening (24+ months):**
- Diversification improvements
- Reserve target increases
- Governance adjustments
- Framework updates

### 7.3 After-Action Review

**Review Process:**
1. Initiate within 30 days of crisis de-escalation
2. Document timeline and decisions
3. Assess response effectiveness
4. Identify improvement areas
5. Update protocols accordingly

**Review Components:**
- Chronological event documentation
- Decision review (what worked, what didn't)
- Early warning assessment (did indicators provide warning?)
- Resource allocation review
- Stakeholder feedback collection
- Comparison to similar crises elsewhere

**Reporting:**
- Internal after-action report (confidential)
- Summary report to Confederal Council
- Briefing to Guarantor Forum
- Public summary if appropriate

### 7.4 Protocol Updates

**Update Triggers:**
- After-action review recommendations
- Significant crisis not covered by protocols

- New risks identified
- Guarantor feedback

**Update Process:**
- Finance Office drafts updates
- Executive Committee review
- Confederal Council approval for major changes
- Annual protocol review regardless of events

## 8. Scenario Planning

### 8.1 Reference Scenarios

The following scenarios guide crisis planning and exercises:

**Scenario A: Global Financial Crisis**
- Trigger: Major global recession (2008-level or worse)
- Duration: 2-4 years
- Impact: 30-40% reduction in donor capacity
- Response: Full Level 3 activation; 50% program reduction

**Scenario B: Regional Economic Collapse**
- Trigger: Gulf state fiscal crisis or regional conflict expansion
- Duration: 1-3 years
- Impact: Regional donors withdraw; 40% funding loss
- Response: Level 3 with accelerated guarantor requests

**Scenario C: Local Hyperinflation**
- Trigger: Currency collapse in operating environment
- Duration: 1-2 years
- Impact: Operational cost explosion; local revenue collapse
- Response: Currency hedging; international procurement; salary adjustments

**Scenario D: Major Donor Withdrawal**
- Trigger: Principal donor (US or EU) withdrawal
- Duration: 12-24 months transition
- Impact: 25-35% sudden funding loss
- Response: Emergency diversification; reserve drawdown; program prioritization

**Scenario E: Banking System Failure**
- Trigger: Major bank holding MCF funds fails
- Duration: 3-12 months recovery
- Impact: Liquidity crisis; account access lost
- Response: Guarantor emergency bridge; alternative banking; payment disruption management

**Scenario F: State-Level Clearing Denial**

- Trigger: Israel severs ILS clearing for MCF-licensed banks or pressures correspondent banks to de-risk MCF-connected institutions under national security regulations
- Duration: Indefinite (political, not market-driven)
- Impact: ILS-denominated transactions within MCF domains seize; CMS benefit disbursement disrupted; SAZ salary payments stalled; corridor commerce halted
- Response: MVTP activation (see [Economic Integration Section 4.4](../07-economic-architecture/01-economic-integration.md)); USD-only settlement mode; guarantor bridge banking; guarantor diplomatic pressure and escalation to spoiler response protocols

**Scenario F Response Sequence:**

| Phase | Timeline | Actions |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Immediate** | 0-72 hours | Assess scope; activate backup correspondent channels; notify Guarantor Forum |
| **MVTP activation** | 72 hours-7 days | CFO certification; Executive Committee authorization; MVTP transitions to primary settlement |
| **Stabilization** | 7-30 days | MCF operations continue via MVTP + USD channels; guarantor diplomatic pressure on Israel |
| **Resolution or adaptation** | 30+ days | If clearing restored: MVTP deactivation per protocol. If sustained: permanent USD/MVTP operations; guarantor escalation to sanctions |

**Distinction from Scenario E:** Scenario E is a market/institutional failure requiring liquidity substitution. Scenario F is deliberate state-level interference requiring both operational adaptation (MVTP) and political response (guarantor enforcement). Documentation of the clearing denial feeds into spoiler response protocols as state-level economic warfare (see [Spoiler Response Section 2.2](../08-operational-procedures/04-spoiler-response.md)).

**Scenario G: Tax Revenue Withholding**

- Trigger: Israel withholds customs duties and VAT collected on behalf of the Palestinian Authority (approximately $188M/month at 2023 levels). This has been deployed repeatedly as political leverage and can be triggered without any formal crisis declaration.

**Early Warning Indicators:**

- Israeli political rhetoric targeting PA financial transfers
- Partial withholding or delayed transfers (often precedes full withholding)
- Escalation in political tensions that historically correlate with revenue withholding

**Trigger:** Withheld revenue exceeds one calendar month's equivalent without security justification accepted by the guarantor coordination body.

**Scenario G Response Sequence:**

| Timeframe | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **24 hours** | Guarantor coordination body convenes; formal documentation of withholding |
| **72 hours** | Guarantor bridge funding activated from MCF emergency reserves |
| **7 days** | Diplomatic escalation: guarantors engage Israel bilaterally on revenue release |
| **30 days** | If unresolved: guarantor joint statement; formal violation documentation; compensation claim initiated |
| **60 days** | If unresolved: enhanced guarantor financial support; assessment of impact on MCF operations; phase transition freeze in affected area |

**MCF-Specific Impacts:**

- CMS benefit delivery may be affected if PA co-funds MCF programs
- SAZ operations in PA-administered areas face fiscal pressure
- CMS holder confidence may decline if economic conditions deteriorate

**Mitigation:** MCF operational budget is ring-fenced from PA fiscal accounts per [Funding Architecture](03-funding-architecture.md). Direct MCF operations are not dependent on PA revenue. However, indirect effects (PA salary delays, reduced public services) affect CMS holder welfare.

---

**Scenario H: Selective Border and Crossing Degradation**

- Trigger: Israel increases inspection times, reduces checkpoint throughput, limits crossing operating hours, or selectively closes commercial crossings. These actions degrade MCF economic activity without triggering the ILS clearing denial scenario or constituting a formal closure.

**Early Warning Indicators:**

- Average crossing time increases >25% above 30-day rolling baseline
- Commercial shipment volume drops >15% without corresponding demand change
- New inspection procedures announced without security incident justification
- Operating hours reduced at key crossings

**Trigger:** Average commercial crossing time exceeds 200% of 90-day baseline for 14+ consecutive days at any major crossing, OR total commercial throughput drops below 70% of baseline for 21+ consecutive days.

**Scenario H Response Sequence:**

| Timeframe | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **Immediate** | JSVC documents crossing conditions; baseline comparison published |
| **7 days** | Guarantor engagement with Israeli authorities requesting explanation |
| **14 days** | Jordan Corridor activation for diverted shipments where feasible |
| **30 days** | If unresolved: guarantor direct procurement for critical supplies; formal documentation as economic coercion |
| **60 days** | Sustained degradation factored into phase transition assessment |

**Interaction with Labor Mobility:**

- Crossing degradation directly impacts CMS Work Authorization holders' ability to reach employment
- Transit time monitoring (per [Labor Mobility Section 2.7](../07-economic-architecture/02-labor-mobility.md)) feeds into this scenario's early warning system
- PCC expansion may be accelerated as a response to crossing degradation

---

**Scenario I: Dual-Use Material Reclassification**

- Trigger: Israel reclassifies construction materials (cement, steel, pipes) as dual-use, blocking SAZ construction and infrastructure projects without any overt economic "crisis." This is targeted obstruction rather than general economic coercion.

**Early Warning Indicators:**

- Israeli security announcements regarding construction material classification
- Import permit delays for specific material categories
- Pattern of permit approvals followed by last-minute blocks

**Trigger:** Construction material import volume drops below 60% of project-required baseline for 30+ consecutive days without a specific, documented security incident justifying the reclassification.

**Scenario I Response Sequence:**

| Timeframe | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **7 days** | Independent assessment of dual-use classification validity (guarantor-appointed technical panel) |
| **14 days** | If classification not supported: guarantor engagement requesting reversal |
| **30 days** | Jordan Corridor activation for alternative supply chain |
| **45 days** | Guarantor direct procurement for critical infrastructure materials |
| **60 days** | If pattern continues: formal documentation as obstruction; integration into phase transition assessment |

**SAZ-Specific Impact:**

- SAZ construction timelines delayed
- Infrastructure coordination plans ([05-infrastructure-coordination.md](../07-economic-architecture/05-infrastructure-coordination.md)) require revision
- Independent SAZ infrastructure provisions (off-grid power, independent water) prioritized to reduce dependency

### 8.2 Exercise Schedule
