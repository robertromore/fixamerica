# Funding Architecture

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#funding-architecture)

**Phase:** All Phases

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## Purpose

The Funding Architecture establishes how MCF is **financially sustained** through diversified sources, multi-year commitments, and mechanisms that prevent donor capture.

Funding is the lifeblood of MCF. Without reliable, sustained, and politically insulated funding, MCF institutions cannot function, incentives cannot be delivered, and the entire framework collapses. The funding architecture must be as carefully designed as the governance architecture.

---

## Funding Principles

### 1. Diversification Requirement

No single funding source can dominate. Dependence on any single donor creates vulnerability to political shifts in that donor and enables donor capture of MCF priorities.

**Diversification Rules:**
- No single donor >30% of total funding
- No single category (states, IOs, private) >60%
- Minimum 5 significant funding sources
- Geographic diversification required

### 2. Multi-Year Commitment Structure

Annual funding decisions subject to political cycles create instability. MCF requires multi-year commitments that survive changes in government.

**Commitment Requirements:**
- Minimum 5-year funding cycles
- 10-year commitments for core institutional funding
- Binding mechanisms (treaties, legislation, escrow)
- Predictable disbursement schedules

### 3. Outcome-Based Allocation

Funding should incentivize MCF success, not create dependency or perpetuate institutions that aren't working.

**Outcome Linkages:**
- Core institutional funding: Unconditional (within framework)
- Program funding: Tied to verified outputs
- Development funding: Tied to measurable outcomes
- Incentive funding: Tied to participation metrics

### 4. Local Economic Integration

Long-term sustainability requires reducing aid dependency through economic development that generates local revenue.

**Integration Pathway:**
- SAZ economic development priority
- Trade facilitation
- Employment creation
- Tax base development
- Transition to self-financing

### 5. Capture Prevention

MCF must resist both donor capture (donors dictating priorities) and internal capture (factions controlling funding for political purposes).

**Anti-Capture Mechanisms:**
- Diversification
- Transparent allocation
- Independent financial governance
- Regular audits
