# Guarantor Coordination Protocol

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#external-guarantor-architecture)

**Phase:** All Phases

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## Purpose

The Guarantor Coordination Protocol defines how **multiple guarantors work together** to support MCF without creating coordination failures or conflicts among guarantors.

Multiple guarantors provide redundancy, credibility, and diverse capacity—but they also create coordination challenges. Without clear protocols, guarantors may duplicate efforts, work at cross-purposes, or create confusion about roles. This document establishes the coordination architecture that prevents these failures.

---

## Coordination Principles

### 1. Collective Responsibility

All guarantors share responsibility for MCF success. No guarantor can claim success alone, and no guarantor can disclaim responsibility for collective failures.

**Collective Responsibility Means:**
- Shared commitment to MCF outcomes
- Mutual support among guarantors
- Gap coverage when one falters
- Collective accountability for results

### 2. Specialized Roles

While responsibility is collective, execution is specialized. Different guarantors lead on different functions based on capacity and comparative advantage.

**Specialization Means:**
- Lead guarantor assignments by function
- Clear role delineation
- Expertise concentration
- Accountability clarity

### 3. Non-Interference Among Guarantors

Guarantors do not interfere in each other's assigned functions or use guarantor coordination to pursue bilateral disputes unrelated to MCF.

**Non-Interference Means:**
- Respect assigned roles
- No undermining of other guarantors
- Bilateral disputes stay bilateral
- MCF focus maintained

### 4. MCF Institutional Primacy

Guarantors support MCF institutions; they do not replace them. Coordination among guarantors serves MCF institutional needs, not guarantor preferences.

**MCF Primacy Means:**
- MCF institutions set priorities
- Guarantors respond to MCF needs
- No guarantor diktat to MCF
- MCF outcome focus

## Decision-Making

### 1. Consensus Procedures

**Default Decision Mode: Consensus**

**Consensus Defined:**
- No guarantor formally objects
- Silence = assent after reasonable opportunity to object
- Concerns recorded even without objection

**Consensus Process:**
- Proposal circulated
- Discussion period (7 days minimum for significant decisions)
- Revision based on input
- Final proposal for adoption
- Adoption if no objection

### 2. Voting Procedures

**When Voting Applies:**
- Consensus not achievable after good-faith effort
- Time-sensitive decisions
- Matters designated for voting

**Voting Thresholds (computed by weighted vote):**

| Decision Type | Threshold |
|--------------|-----------|
| Routine coordination | Simple majority |
| Resource allocation | 2/3 majority |
| New guarantor admission | 2/3 majority |
| Guarantor sanction/removal | 3/4 majority |
| Framework amendments | Consensus preferred, 3/4 fallback |

**Voting Weights:**

- One guarantor, one vote (state guarantors)
- IO guarantors: Proportional to contribution (capped)
- No single guarantor >20% of weighted vote

**Threshold Calculation:** Thresholds are calculated against total weighted vote, not headcount. For example, if total weighted votes equal 100, a 2/3 threshold requires 67+ weighted votes in favor.

### 3. Deadlock Resolution

**If Deadlock Persists:**
1. Escalate to ministerial/principal level
2. Mediation by neutral party
3. Refer to MCF Confederal Council for input
4. Default to status quo if no resolution

**Deadlock Prevention:**
- Early consultation on sensitive issues
- Shuttle diplomacy by Chair
- Small group pre-negotiation
- Trade-off packaging

### 4. Emergency Decisions

**Emergency Decision Authority:**
- Chair + 2 other guarantors can authorize emergency action
- Full Forum ratification within 72 hours
- Emergency defined: Imminent threat requiring immediate response

**Emergency Scope:**
- Security responses
- Humanitarian emergencies
- Financial emergencies
- Political crises
