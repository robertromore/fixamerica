# Guarantor Withdrawal Procedures

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#external-guarantor-architecture)

**Phase:** All Phases

**Status:** Draft

---

## Purpose

Guarantor Withdrawal Procedures define how **guarantors can exit their role** in an orderly manner that preserves MCF stability and enables replacement.

Guarantor withdrawal is inevitable over decades-long timeframes. Political changes, capacity constraints, or strategic shifts may lead guarantors to exit. The question is not whether withdrawal will happen, but whether it will happen in ways that preserve MCF or ways that destabilize it. These procedures ensure orderly transitions.

---

## Withdrawal Principles

### 1. Orderly Transition Priority

Withdrawal must be orderly. Abrupt departure without transition creates gaps that harm MCF. Even in difficult circumstances, structured handoff is required.

**Orderly Means:**
- Advance notice
- Transition planning
- Responsibility handoff
- Gap coverage

### 2. Successor Arrangement Requirement

Withdrawing guarantors should facilitate successor arrangements. Withdrawal without ensuring continuity of critical functions is irresponsible.

**Successor Arrangement Means:**
- Identify potential successors
- Facilitate successor engagement
- Transfer knowledge and relationships
- Support successor onboarding

### 3. Minimum Threshold Maintenance

Withdrawal cannot reduce guarantor capacity below minimum thresholds. If withdrawal would breach minimums, additional measures are required (see "Minimum Threshold Procedures" section).

**Threshold Maintenance Means:**

- No withdrawal that breaches minimum guarantor count (withdrawal paused until replacement secured)
- No withdrawal that eliminates critical capacity
- Emergency measures if thresholds threatened
- MCF adaptation if minimums cannot be maintained

### 4. Surviving Obligations

Some obligations survive withdrawal. Guarantors cannot exit all responsibilities immediately even upon formal withdrawal.

**Surviving Obligations:**
- Financial commitments through current cycle
- Confidentiality obligations
- Transition cooperation
- Liability for pre-withdrawal actions

## Replacement Process

### 1. Replacement Identification

**Replacement Sources:**
- Existing guarantor capacity increase
- New guarantor recruitment
- IO role expansion
- Function modification

**Replacement Criteria:**
- Capacity to fill gap
- Credibility in function
- Commitment level
- Stakeholder acceptance

### 2. Replacement Approval

**Approval Process:**

- Nomination (self or other)
- Capacity verification
- Guarantor Forum approval (2/3 majority; expedited timeline for replacements)
- Confederal Council concurrence (supermajority; same threshold as new guarantor admissions per [Guarantor Selection](01-guarantor-selection.md#3-approval-requirements))

**Expedited Approval:**

- Faster timeline for replacements (vetting compressed from 180 to 90 days)
- Pre-approved reserve pool (candidates pre-vetted for rapid activation)
- Temporary approval pending full vetting (for urgent gaps; full approval within 6 months)

### 3. Capacity Verification

**Verification Elements:**
- Stated capacity confirmed
- Resources committed
- Timeline agreed
- Performance standards accepted

**Verification Method:**
- Document review
- Capacity assessment
- Reference check
- Trial period (if appropriate)

### 4. Gap Coverage

**If No Replacement Available:**
- Other guarantors increase capacity
- MCF adapts operations
- Reduced scope if necessary
- Continued recruitment efforts

**Gap Coverage Duration:**

- Maximum 12 months without replacement
- Review at 6 months
- Escalation if gap persists
- MCF adaptation consideration

**Relationship to Minimum Thresholds:** This 12-month gap coverage applies to function-specific gaps where minimum guarantor thresholds (Section 1) are still met. If a withdrawal would breach minimum thresholds, the breach-prevention procedures (Section 2) take precedence—withdrawal is paused and emergency recruitment activated before the 12-month gap coverage clock begins.
