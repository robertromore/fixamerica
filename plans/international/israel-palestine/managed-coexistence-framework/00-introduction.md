## Executive Summary

The **Managed Coexistence Framework (MCF)** is a security-first, sovereignty-respecting, multi-generational governance architecture designed to reduce violent conflict, stabilize daily life, and gradually enable voluntary political convergence between historically opposed populations. This Framework assumes the persistence of conflict and is designed to manage it downward, not to declare it resolved.

MCF does **not** assume rapid reconciliation, forced unity, or immediate state transformation. Instead, it treats conflict as a long-term condition to be *managed downward* through durable institutions, verified procedures, and opt-in participation. Political integration, if it occurs, is the *result* of sustained stability—not its prerequisite.

The framework is explicitly designed to:

- Survive periods of renewed violence
- Withstand extremist sabotage
- Preserve existing national sovereignty and identity
- Reward peaceful participation without punishing non-participation
- Operate on generational timescales (50–100+ years)

---

## Core Design Principles

1. **Security First**
   Physical safety, predictability, and de-escalation procedures precede all political integration.

2. **Sovereignty Preservation**
   Existing states retain flags, borders, courts, and ultimate authority throughout all early and mid phases.

3. **Procedural Trust Over Intentional Trust**
   Institutions are designed to function without assuming goodwill or shared narratives.

4. **Voluntary Participation**
   All civic integration mechanisms are opt-in; no penalties exist for abstention.

5. **Incremental, Reversible Progress**
   Each phase contains off-ramps and review mechanisms to prevent irreversible failure.

6. **Generational Time Horizon**
   Identity change and political convergence are expected to take decades, not election cycles.

---

## Structural Overview

MCF is implemented through **four sequential phases**, each building on the verified success of the previous phase.

---

## Phase 0 (Years 0–5): Hardened Confederal Security Layer

**Objective:** Prevent escalation spirals and establish reliable, shared procedures for managing incidents.

### Key Institutions

#### Joint Security Verification Commission (JSVC)

- Permanent, joint verification and deconfliction body
- Responsibilities:

    - Incident attribution
    - Evidence collection standards
    - Secure communication channels
    - Mandatory clarification timelines
- Explicit limitations:

    - No command authority
    - No arrest powers
    - No territorial control

#### Protected Civic Corridors (PCCs)

- Narrow, single-purpose shared systems
- Initial focus areas:

    - Utilities (water, electricity)
    - Medical transfers and supply chains
- Features:

    - Heavy monitoring
    - Automatic suspension protocols
    - Time-limited, reviewable restrictions

#### Shock-Absorber Protocols

- Pre-negotiated response ladders to violent incidents
- Designed to prevent emotional or unilateral escalation
- Responses are:

    - Automatic
    - Proportionate
    - Temporarily bounded
    - Independently reviewed

**Success Criteria:**

- Reduced escalation frequency
- Improved incident attribution credibility
- Infrastructure reliability under stress

---

## Phase 1 (Years 5–20): Opt-In Civic Membership Without Territorial Change

**Objective:** Build a protected constituency for coexistence without redrawing borders or altering national identity.

### Civic Membership Status (CMS)

A voluntary legal status layered on top of existing citizenship.

**Eligibility Requirements:**

- Security vetting
- Completion of civic education curriculum
- Formal nonviolence pledge within confederal domains

**Benefits:**

- Protected access to shared employment programs
- Use of confederal arbitration courts
- Due process guarantees within confederal systems
- Credential portability across participating institutions

**Limitations:**

- No voting rights in the other side’s national elections
- No automatic residency rights
- Full compliance with national law remains mandatory

### Confederal Arbitration & Commercial Courts

- Jurisdiction limited to:

    - Business disputes
    - Labor conflicts within MCF programs
    - Contract enforcement
- Purpose:

    - Increase economic predictability
    - Anchor peace incentives in material benefits

### Anti-Intimidation Architecture

- Protected reporting channels
- Anonymous testimony mechanisms
- Confederal-level witness protection
- External guarantor support for relocation if necessary

**Success Criteria:**

- Growing voluntary participation
- Economic participation stability
- Declining intimidation effectiveness

---

## Phase 2 (Years 20–50): Special Administrative Zone (SAZ) Pilot

**Objective:** Test mixed civic governance on a defined territory without permanent sovereignty transfer.

### Legal Status

- Territory leased or mandated for a fixed term (e.g., 30–50 years)
- Renewable only by mutual consent
- Symbolic sovereignty claims preserved

### Governance Structure

- Locally elected council
- Independent judiciary
- Integrated civil police force under strict external audit

### Constitutional Floor

- Confederal Rights Compact supersedes local law
- Guarantees:

    - Equal protection
    - Due process
    - Anti-discrimination enforcement

### Security Model

- Demilitarized zone
- No armed factions
- External rapid-response guarantees
- Zero tolerance for paramilitary activity

**Success Criteria:**

- Sustained safety advantage over surrounding areas
- High residency demand
- Institutional legitimacy across communities

---

## Phase 3 (Years 50–100+): Voluntary Convergence

**Objective:** Enable political integration only if repeatedly chosen by affected populations.

### Trigger Metrics

- Multi-year stability benchmarks
- Peaceful electoral cycles
- Judicial trust metrics
- Economic convergence indicators
- Declining reliance on external guarantors

### Mechanism

- Periodic local referenda
- Supermajority thresholds
- Minority veto protections
- Reversibility clauses

### Possible End States

- Permanent confederation
- Federation
- Dual-state system with strong confederal layer
- Partial rollback to earlier phases if conditions deteriorate

---

## Incentive Structure Overview

MCF relies on **compounding incentives**, not coercion:

- Phase 0: Physical safety, medical access, infrastructure reliability
- Phase 1: Employment, education, legal predictability
- Phase 2: Residency access, civic dividends, quality-of-life gains
- Phase 3: Political agency through consent-based integration

At no stage are participants made worse off for disengaging.

---

## The "No Worse Off" Guarantee

The "no worse off" guarantee must apply **equally and explicitly** to both categories: individuals who never participate at all, and individuals who participate and later withdraw. If the guarantee applies only to non-participants, the system creates a hidden penalty for experimentation. If it applies only to former participants, it creates resentment and inequity among those who never joined. Either asymmetry would undermine trust and suppress participation.

### Non-Participants Who Never Join

For individuals who never participate, "no worse off" means the framework must not reduce their existing legal status, material conditions, or security relative to the pre-framework baseline. They must retain whatever rights, access, and protections they had before Phase 1 existed.

The creation of Civic Membership Status cannot be accompanied by new restrictions, punitive measures, or exclusionary policies that function as indirect coercion. Non-participation may limit access to *new* benefits created by the framework, but it must not trigger loss of preexisting ones.

### Former Participants Who Withdraw

For individuals who participate and later withdraw, "no worse off" must mean **reversion to the same baseline status** enjoyed by non-participants—not a degraded or suspicious status.

Withdrawal must not trigger:

- Enhanced surveillance
- Punitive reclassification
- Loss of civil protections
- Retrospective sanctions for lawful activity during participation

The act of disengagement must be treated as administratively neutral rather than as a signal of disloyalty or risk.

### Formal and Informal Harms

The guarantee must cover both **formal and informal harms**:

**Formal harms:**

- Legal penalties
- Loss of documentation
- Movement restrictions
- Denial of services

**Informal harms:**

- Retaliation
- Social targeting enabled by state disclosure
- Hints to third parties that an individual is untrustworthy because they withdrew

To satisfy the "no worse off" principle, the system must:

- Limit data retention
- Prohibit adverse annotations tied to withdrawal
- Ensure that participation history is not used to infer intent or affiliation after exit

### No Retroactive Clawback

Benefits accrued during participation are not clawed back retroactively, except in narrowly defined cases of fraud or violent wrongdoing.

A participant who lawfully accessed work authorization, services, or mobility while enrolled should not face penalties simply because they later disengaged. Retroactive punishment would convert participation into a risk-bearing gamble rather than a reversible civic option.

### Symmetry in Social Signaling

The framework must communicate publicly that participation and non-participation are both legitimate civilian choices under the system.

If official messaging frames participation as moral advancement and non-participation as obstruction, the "no worse off" guarantee becomes hollow, even if formally preserved. **Neutral framing is essential** to avoid coercive pressure through stigma.

### The Core Principle: Upside-Only Optionality

From a design perspective, the correct interpretation of "no worse off" is this: participation creates **upside-only optionality**.

- It offers access to additional rights, protections, or opportunities while enrolled
- It does not alter the risk floor
- Entry does not raise the stakes of exit
- Abstention does not impose penalties

This principle must be codified, auditable, and enforceable—not merely aspirational.

If this symmetry is not maintained, the system will fail quietly rather than loudly. People will rationally avoid participation, not because they oppose the framework's goals, but because the downside risk is asymmetric and irreversible. The "no worse off" rule exists precisely to prevent that outcome, and it only works if it applies fully, equally, and credibly to both non-participants and former participants.

---

## Risk Management & Failure Containment

- Extremist sabotage anticipated at all phases
- No single leader can collapse the framework unilaterally
- Automatic procedural responses replace ad hoc political reactions
- External guarantors provide credibility without governance control

---

## State-Level Spoilers and External Interference

The Managed Coexistence Framework (MCF) is explicitly designed on the assumption that **state-level spoilers will attempt to undermine it**, not merely that non-state extremists will. Interference by external states—most plausibly through proxies, financing, arms transfers, cyber operations, or information warfare by actors such as Iran—is treated as a **baseline condition**, not an aberration.

MCF therefore does not rely on goodwill, deterrence by rhetoric, or appeals to international norms; it relies on **procedural insulation, attribution, and cost-shifting**.

### Eliminating Capture Points

MCF deliberately **de-links its core functions from territorial control and mass mobilization**, which sharply reduces the payoff of proxy warfare.

Because early and mid phases focus on verification, narrow corridors, and individual opt-in participation rather than state-building or armed control, there is no single institutional "capture point" for a spoiler state to seize.

Sabotage does not collapse the system; it triggers documentation, isolation, and rollback. This makes proxy escalation **less strategically valuable** than in traditional peace processes, where derailing talks produces maximal political gain.

### Pattern Attribution

The verification architecture (UVB/JSVC) is explicitly tasked with **pattern attribution**, not just incident recording.

While it does not assign legal blame, it documents recurring signatures of external interference over time:

- Weapon types
- Funding flows
- Coordination patterns
- Information narratives

These findings are designed to be usable by guarantors and third states independently of the Framework itself. MCF externalizes the cost of proxy warfare by **making interference legible, persistent, and reputationally cumulative**, rather than episodic and deniable.

### Response Separation

MCF's guarantor stack is structured so that **responses to state-level interference occur outside the Framework's operational core**.

The Framework itself does not:

- Sanction Iran
- Conduct counter-operations
- Retaliate militarily

Instead, documented interference triggers action by guarantors in their own domains:

- Diplomatic pressure
- Financial restrictions
- Arms interdiction
- Cyber countermeasures
- Regional security responses

This separation is critical. It prevents MCF from becoming a battlefield between states while ensuring that interference is not consequence-free. Spoiler states face **external costs**, not internal veto power.

### Information Warfare Resilience

MCF treats information warfare as a **primary threat**, not a secondary one.

Anti-intimidation architecture includes **narrative resilience mechanisms**:

- Rapid factual clarification
- Pre-agreed incident reporting standards
- Public transparency that denies spoilers the ability to manufacture ambiguity

By stabilizing facts—even when violence occurs—MCF reduces the effectiveness of disinformation campaigns aimed at provoking overreaction or delegitimizing participation.

Spoilers thrive on confusion; MCF starves them of it.

### Rollback as Strategic Denial

Rollback mechanisms are a **feature, not a vulnerability**, in the face of state-level sabotage.

If external interference succeeds in degrading conditions beyond safe thresholds, MCF regresses procedurally rather than collapsing politically. This denies spoiler states the strategic victory of total derailment.

The framework survives by:

- Shrinking its footprint
- Preserving institutional memory
- Waiting out interference cycles

This is something proxy-driven strategies are historically ill-suited to sustain over long horizons.

### The Core Principle: Changing the Cost-Benefit Equation

MCF does not attempt to defeat state-level spoilers directly. It **changes the cost-benefit equation**:

- Interference becomes visible
- Disruption is less decisive
- Costs are externally punishable
- Strategic rewards diminish over time

The framework's resilience lies not in preventing disruption, but in ensuring that disruption fails to determine outcomes.

---

## Israeli Domestic Opposition: Government-Resilient Design

Israeli domestic opposition cannot be treated as an external risk or an implementation detail; it is a **core structural constraint** on MCF's durability. Any framework that assumes stable Israeli political support across election cycles, coalition reshuffles, or shifts in public sentiment will fail. MCF therefore must be designed as **government-resilient rather than government-dependent**, capable of surviving partial hostility, passive resistance, or active attempts at rollback.

### Institutional Anchoring Beyond a Single Government

The first design principle is **institutional anchoring beyond a single Israeli government**. MCF commitments cannot rely solely on executive discretion or ministerial goodwill.

Wherever possible, participation in MCF should be embedded in:

- Formal legal instruments
- Administrative regulations
- International commitments

These mechanisms raise the political and procedural cost of unilateral withdrawal. The goal is not to make reversal impossible, but to make it **slow, visible, and costly** rather than immediate and quiet. Domestic opposition thrives on rapid disruption; durability depends on friction.

### Government Changes Affect Tempo, Not Existence

Changes in Israeli government should affect **tempo and scope**, not the existence of the framework itself.

A hostile or skeptical government may:

- Slow corridor expansion
- Tighten eligibility reviews
- Limit funding

But it should not be able to dissolve Phase 0 institutions or revoke existing civilian protections without triggering predefined consequences.

**Consequence mechanisms** (not necessarily punitive):

- Automatic international review
- Suspension of expansion rather than contraction
- Reversion to baseline obligations that preserve "no worse off" guarantees

### Settler Pressure as a Rule-of-Law Issue

Settler political pressure presents a distinct challenge because it operates both inside and outside formal government channels.

MCF must explicitly treat settler violence and obstruction as **security and rule-of-law issues**, not as political expression entitled to deference.

**Design requirements:**

- Phase 0 and Phase 1 institutions must be designed so that settler interference with SAZs, corridors, or civilian participants is categorically out of bounds
- Interference triggers mandatory response protocols
- If settler pressure can shut down zones through intimidation or violence without consequence, the framework will be read as selectively enforced and illegitimate

### Instrumental Framing, Not Ideological

MCF should avoid framing itself domestically as a moral or ideological project. Israeli domestic movements that reject the framework will often do so on identity, sovereignty, or security grounds.

The framework's public justification inside Israel must be **instrumental rather than normative**:

- Security stabilization and risk-reduction mechanism
- Limits escalation
- Reduces IDF burden
- Restores predictability

**Not:**

- A concession
- A peace process
- A final-status pathway

The more MCF is rhetorically tied to ideological outcomes, the more vulnerable it becomes to domestic backlash.

### Israeli Nonparticipation Cannot Mean Palestinian Punishment

MCF must be structured so that **Israeli nonparticipation does not translate into Palestinian punishment**.

If a new government withdraws political support, the framework defaults to **freeze-in-place rather than rollback**:

- Existing SAZs continue operating
- Existing participants retain status
- Expansion pauses rather than reverses

This removes the incentive for domestic opponents to use civilian harm as leverage and reassures participants that their safety is not hostage to Israeli electoral cycles.

### Countering Selective Enforcement

Domestic opposition often manifests not as outright rejection, but as **uneven application of rules**:

- Stricter scrutiny of Palestinian participants
- Lax response to settler violations
- Administrative slow-walking

To counter this, MCF requires:

- Independent monitoring
- Public reporting that makes asymmetries visible

The point is not to shame Israeli institutions, but to prevent quiet erosion. **Sunlight is a stabilizer when political consensus is weak.**

### Off-Ramps for Israeli Security Institutions

One reason domestic opposition hardens is institutional fatigue or fear of constraint. If the IDF and security services perceive MCF as permanently binding their hands without review or exit, they will resist it bureaucratically even if political leadership nominally agrees.

**Design features to reduce institutional hostility:**

- Clear review cycles
- Emergency override clauses with strict procedural safeguards
- Sunset-with-renewal mechanisms

These reduce institutional resistance without hollowing out civilian protections.

### Political Rejection vs. Operational Sabotage

The framework must distinguish between **political rejection and operational sabotage**.

- Israeli citizens and movements retain **full freedom to oppose MCF politically**
- Physical obstruction, violence, or intimidation aimed at SAZs, corridors, or participants must be treated as **criminal acts regardless of ideological justification**

Blurring this line would effectively grant veto power through coercion.

### Creating Domestic Constituencies with Material Stakes

MCF's resilience depends on **creating domestic Israeli constituencies with a material stake in its continuation**.

This does not mean manufacturing consent, but recognizing political reality. If the following groups experience tangible benefits, they become informal stabilizers:

- Logistics firms
- Employers
- Local municipalities near corridors
- Security professionals

**Benefits that create stakes:**

- Reduced volatility
- Clearer rules
- Lower escalation risk

Frameworks survive opposition not by eliminating it, but by making reversal inconvenient for enough actors.

### The Core Principle: Outlasting Disagreement

MCF must assume that Israeli domestic consensus will fracture repeatedly. Its design response should not be to chase consensus, but to **outlast disagreement**:

- Embed commitments procedurally
- Freeze gains rather than roll them back
- Insulate civilians from political swings
- Frame the framework as a pragmatic security instrument rather than an ideological wager

**If MCF requires Israeli political harmony to function, it is already dead.**

---

## Phase Transition Criteria

Phase 0 cannot rely on vague or impressionistic indicators of "calm," because ambiguity over success would itself become a political weapon. If "reduced escalation" is undefined, every actor will either claim premature success or permanent failure depending on their interests. For Phase 0 to function as a credible gateway rather than a holding pattern, success must be defined **procedurally, quantitatively, and institutionally**.

### Escalation Metrics

"Reduced escalation frequency" should not be measured as a simple count of attacks year over year. A single high-casualty event can outweigh dozens of low-level incidents in political and social impact, and raw frequency alone invites perverse incentives to reclassify or downplay events.

Instead, escalation should be measured using a **composite index** that includes:

- Frequency of incidents
- Severity (casualties, infrastructure damage)
- Geographic spread
- Duration of incident chains

Success is defined as a sustained reduction in aggregate escalation intensity over a fixed observation window (e.g., six to nine months), rather than a binary comparison like "one major attack instead of two." This prevents trivial improvements from being overstated as structural progress.

### Severity Thresholds

Phase 0 must distinguish between:

- Isolated acts by unaffiliated individuals
- Coordinated operations by organized armed groups

A reduction in large-scale, coordinated attacks or cross-border escalations carries far more weight than marginal changes in lone-actor incidents. Success is not the absence of violence, but evidence that **violence is becoming less organized, less scalable, and less politically instrumental**.

### Attribution Credibility Standards

"Improved incident attribution credibility" is not about eliminating disagreement over responsibility—which is unrealistic—but about **narrowing the range of plausible denial**.

Success means that, for a supermajority of significant incidents, independent observers converge on attribution within a defined confidence band and time window. Indicators include:

- Percentage of incidents for which multiple independent monitoring bodies agree on attribution
- Speed with which credible preliminary attribution is produced
- Degree to which subsequent evidence materially revises initial findings

The goal is not truth in an absolute sense, but **trust in the attribution process as a shared reference point**.

### Independent Certification Authority

Neither side to the conflict should be the sole arbiter of whether thresholds have been met. If Israel, a Palestinian faction, or any single external sponsor decides unilaterally, Phase 0 becomes hostage to political incentives rather than empirical conditions.

Decision authority must rest with an **independent, predefined oversight body** whose mandate, metrics, and procedures are agreed upon before Phase 0 begins. This body's role is not to pass moral judgment, but to certify whether predefined technical criteria have been satisfied.

### Automatic Transition Trigger

The transition from Phase 0 to Phase 1 should be **automatic once thresholds are met**, not discretionary.

Phase 0 includes a rule such as: *If escalation metrics and attribution credibility meet defined benchmarks for a continuous observation period, Phase 1 triggers by default unless a clearly specified emergency exception is invoked.*

This removes the temptation to indefinitely delay progress for political leverage while still allowing for narrowly defined safety overrides.

### Provisional Success Framing

Success in Phase 0 should be framed as **provisional rather than definitive**. Meeting the criteria does not mean:

- The conflict is "under control"
- Underlying grievances have been resolved
- Permanent peace has been achieved

It means only that the environment has become **predictable and legible enough** to safely introduce individual civic participation mechanisms without exposing participants to unacceptable risk.

This distinction matters: overclaiming success would provoke backlash, while underclaiming it would stall momentum.

### The Threshold Test

In practical terms, Phase 0 success is best understood as the point at which **violence no longer dominates the information environment or decision-making tempo**.

When incidents can be attributed with reasonable confidence, escalation patterns are measurably dampened, and civilians can assess risk without relying solely on rumor or factional messaging, the system has achieved its minimal purpose.

At that point, delaying Phase 1 would no longer be a safety measure but a political choice—which is precisely what Phase 0's design is meant to avoid.

---

## Phase Regression Triggers

The Managed Coexistence Framework (MCF) treats **rollback as a first-class design feature**, not a failure state. Advancement and regression are **procedurally symmetric but substantively asymmetric**: advancement requires affirmative certification, while rollback is triggered by **objective failure thresholds** combined with **graduated discretion**.

This prevents both automatic collapse after shocks and political paralysis when deterioration is clear.

### Failure Categories

Rollback from **Phase 2 (Special Administrative Zone implementation)** to **Phase 1 (non-territorial civic participation)** is triggered by three categories of failure:

#### Security Breach

- Sustained loss of civilian safety advantage within the SAZ
- Repeated armed infiltration
- Breakdown of demilitarization
- Inability of policing arrangements to prevent organized violence

Verification occurs over defined review windows rather than single incidents.

#### Institutional Capture

Evidence that the SAZ's governing bodies or enforcement mechanisms have been taken over by:

- Armed factions
- Nationalist movements
- State proxies

Such capture defeats neutrality or equal protection and triggers regression review.

#### Systemic Non-Compliance

Persistent, documented violation of Confederal Rights Compact standards across multiple audit cycles:

- Discriminatory enforcement
- Intimidation of participants
- Routine disregard for JSVC procedures

### Presumption-Based Rollback Model

Rollback is **not purely automatic**, but it is also **not discretionary in a political sense**.

MCF uses a **presumption-based rollback model**: when predefined failure thresholds are met and certified by the verification layer, rollback procedures are automatically initiated unless an override is jointly affirmed by the guarantor stack under heightened standards.

This flips the burden of proof. Instead of asking "should we roll back?", the system asks **"can rollback be safely delayed?"**—and delay requires:

- Explicit justification
- Time limits
- Enhanced monitoring

This design prevents leaders from ignoring deterioration out of sunk-cost bias or reputational fear.

### Modular and Proportional Regression

Rollback is **modular and proportional**, not binary.

A Phase 2 regression may involve:

- Suspension of territorial governance functions
- Preservation of civic membership, arbitration, and non-territorial economic mechanisms

**What rollback does NOT do:**

- Expel residents
- Nullify rights
- Revoke prior CMS status (unless individual misconduct warrants)

The goal is **containment, not punishment**.

### Institutional Memory Preservation

Rollback does **not** invalidate earlier verification findings or reset institutional memory.

Records, standards, and eligibility histories persist so that re-advancement does not require starting over. The framework maintains continuity even through regression cycles.

### Rollback as Normal System Behavior

MCF explicitly treats rollback as **normal system behavior**, not evidence of bad faith.

Framework language must state that:

- Regression reflects environmental volatility, not moral failure
- Repeated advance-rollback cycles are expected in long-running asymmetric conflicts
- Progress is measured over decades, not single phase transitions

By making regression predictable, bounded, and survivable, MCF avoids the fatal flaw of prior peace architectures: the assumption that progress must be linear or it is meaningless.

---

## Entry Point: How MCF Begins Under Current Conditions

A core design challenge of the Managed Coexistence Framework (MCF) is that its initial institutions—particularly the Joint Security Verification Commission (JSVC) and Protected Civic Corridors (PCCs)—appear to require mutual agreement between parties that currently reject joint institutions outright.

MCF resolves this by **decoupling functional cooperation from political agreement**. The framework does not begin with a negotiated accord. It begins with **unilateral, externally scaffolded actions** that are difficult to reject and easy to justify domestically.

---

## Principle: Joint Function Does Not Require Joint Consent

MCF assumes that early-stage cooperation must be:

- Asymmetric rather than symmetric
- Functional rather than political
- Reversible rather than permanent
- Defensive rather than reconciliatory

No actor is asked to recognize the other, concede legitimacy, or endorse coexistence narratives in order to participate.

---

## Step 1: Externalized Unilateral Verification Body (UVB)

**Who creates it:**
A small coalition of credible third parties (states and technical institutions) trusted primarily for competence and neutrality rather than ideology.

**Mandate (intentionally narrow):**

- Collect and preserve technical evidence of incidents
- Verify damage to civilian infrastructure, utilities, and medical facilities
- Document compliance or non-compliance with humanitarian deconfliction norms

**Key constraints:**

- No political judgments
- No attribution of moral or legal blame
- No enforcement powers

**Framing:**
The UVB exists to protect civilians, infrastructure, and factual accuracy—not to mediate peace.

Participation is voluntary. Non-participation does not imply wrongdoing.

---

## Step 2: Humanitarian and Utility Anchors

MCF deliberately begins with domains that are hardest to publicly reject:

- Water and electricity infrastructure
- Medical evacuation and hospital access
- Repair access for civilian technicians

These functions are framed as **operational deconfliction**, not cooperation.

Rejecting them requires publicly accepting civilian harm, which raises domestic and international political costs.

---

## Step 3: Parallel Commitments, Not Joint Declarations

Early PCCs are established through **parallel unilateral commitments**, not shared agreements.

Each side commits only to its own behavior, for example:

- "We will not target medical convoys during specified windows"
- "We will allow repair crews access to infrastructure during defined periods"

There is no joint statement, no shared signing ceremony, and no mutual recognition.

The UVB verifies compliance after the fact.

---

## How the JSVC Emerges Without Being Named

### Phase A: Observation and Hotlines

- UVB operates secure communication channels with each side separately
- Incident clarification occurs privately
- Public reporting remains technical and descriptive

### Phase B: Liaison Officers

- Israel, Gaza, and West Bank each appoint liaison officers to the UVB
- Officers represent only their own side’s interests
- No cross-recognition occurs

### Phase C: Functional Jointness

- Shared evidence standards emerge
- Joint incident reviews occur quietly
- Common terminology stabilizes
- Gaza and West Bank coordinate through a **Palestinian Joint Liaison** when a unified position is required, while remaining operationally distinct

At this point, the JSVC exists **in function**, even if not acknowledged politically.

Formal naming and treaty recognition lag behind operational reality.

---

## Political Survivability of the Entry Strategy

### Israeli Government Optics

- Participation framed as protecting national infrastructure and preventing misinformation
- No recognition of Gaza or West Bank authorities required
- No constraint on broader military policy

### Palestinian Faction Optics

- Participation framed as civilian protection and documentation
- No recognition of Israel required
- No surrender of resistance narratives

Both sides join to **defend their own interests**, not to reconcile.

---

## Design Safeguards

All early mechanisms are:

- Time-limited
- Narrowly scoped
- Reversible
- Reviewable by domestic authorities

This allows leaders to characterize participation as a test, not a concession.

---

## What Will Break the Entry Point (and Must Be Avoided)

- Moral or reconciliatory language in early phases
- Broad mandates covering final-status issues
- Public ceremonies or symbolic gestures
- Attempts to force symmetry or simultaneity

MCF begins with containment, not agreement.

---

## Entry Point and Power Asymmetry

MCF is explicitly designed to operate under **asymmetric power conditions**, including scenarios of continued occupation and the absence of a fully sovereign Palestinian state. The Framework does **not** assume a prior two-state agreement.

For Israel, sovereignty preservation refers to the retention of formal state attributes: borders, armed forces, courts, and international legal personality. For Palestinians, sovereignty preservation is defined as **non-preclusion**: the Framework must not permanently foreclose future political outcomes, including statehood, confederation, or other self-determination arrangements.

MCF neither confers nor denies sovereignty. It preserves political options while reducing violence and administrative burden under existing realities.

---

## Preconditions and Launch Sequence

MCF's operational design is detailed, but a framework without a plausible path to existence is theoretical. This section identifies the enabling conditions and likely first-mover scenarios.

### Enabling Conditions

MCF does not require a peace agreement, but it does require a *launch environment* -- a combination of political conditions that makes initiation feasible. The most plausible enabling conditions include:

**External Shock:** A sustained escalation that demonstrates the status quo's unsustainability to domestic opinion in Israel, the US, or both. Historical pattern: Oslo followed the First Intifada; the Disengagement followed the Second. MCF's modular, incremental design makes it deployable in post-crisis windows that do not support comprehensive negotiations.

**US Policy Shift:** A US administration that conditions elements of the bilateral relationship on conflict management cooperation -- not requiring Israeli acceptance of MCF specifically, but creating costs for reflexive rejection of all institutional mechanisms. This shift need not be dramatic: even linking supplemental aid requests to verified compliance with existing humanitarian obligations creates political space.

**Regional Realignment:** Normalization agreements (Abraham Accords model) that include conflict management conditions. Regional states with their own interests in stability -- particularly Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE -- may find MCF's institutional architecture useful for managing risks that normalization creates.

**Guarantor Initiative:** A small coalition of credible third parties -- most plausibly Norway (Oslo precedent, institutional expertise), the EU (funding capacity, institutional credibility), or a Nordic-plus grouping -- takes the initiative to establish the UVB and initial infrastructure. This does not require party consent; it requires party non-obstruction and guarantor political will.

No single enabling condition is sufficient. The realistic launch scenario combines at least two: most likely a post-crisis window combined with guarantor initiative and at minimum tacit US acquiescence.

### First-Mover Identification

MCF's entry mechanism -- the UVB -- requires a specific initiator. The framework's documents describe what the UVB does but not who creates it.

**Most Plausible Conveners:**

| Actor | Strengths | Limitations |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Norway | Oslo precedent, diplomatic credibility, track record | Limited leverage, small resource base |
| EU (EEAS) | Institutional capacity, funding, existing programs | Slow decision-making, internal divisions on conflict |
| Nordic-plus grouping | Combined credibility and resources | Coordination complexity |
| UN Secretary-General | Legitimacy, mandate | US veto risk, institutional constraints |

**Launch Sequence:**

1. **Convening phase**: A lead convener (or small coalition) develops the UVB establishment plan, identifies initial personnel, and secures guaranteed funding for 3-5 years of UVB operations
2. **Diplomatic preparation**: Convener engages Israel and the Palestinian authorities -- not seeking consent, but providing notification, explaining the mechanism, and offering participation. Engagement with the US to secure non-opposition (not endorsement)
3. **Guarantor assembly**: Convener recruits the initial guarantor set. Per Section 6.5 below, the initial guarantor set is proposed by the convening coalition and presented to parties for comment, not jointly proposed by them
4. **UVB deployment**: Physical deployment of UVB personnel and infrastructure, beginning with least sensitive areas (e.g., agricultural zones, water infrastructure) to demonstrate capability before expanding to more contested areas
5. **Demonstration period**: 18-24 months of UVB operation building institutional credibility and demonstrating verification value to both populations and the international community

### Honest Assessment of Israeli Non-Cooperation

The most likely initial scenario is Israeli non-cooperation -- not active obstruction, but deliberate non-engagement combined with bureaucratic friction (delayed visas, restricted access, non-response to requests).

MCF is designed for this scenario:

- The UVB operates unilaterally and does not require Israeli participation
- UVB verification creates a factual record regardless of party cooperation
- Diplomatic costs of actively obstructing a neutral verification body are higher than the costs of ignoring it
- The framework's value proposition to Israel -- reduced IDF burden, international legitimacy, predictable rules -- becomes more compelling as UVB demonstrates competence over time

However, the framework cannot force Israeli cooperation. If Israel actively prevents UVB physical access (denying entry to personnel, blocking equipment, physically preventing site visits), the framework depends on guarantor diplomatic leverage to secure access. This is an acknowledged dependency: MCF begins without consent but cannot operate without non-obstruction. The entry strategy section above addresses mechanisms for managing this gap.

### What This Section Does Not Claim

This section does not claim MCF launch is imminent or likely under current conditions. It identifies the conditions under which launch becomes feasible and the actors who could initiate it. The framework is designed to be ready when the political window opens, not to create that window.

## Geographic Differentiation: Gaza and the West Bank

The Managed Coexistence Framework (MCF) does **not** assume identical operating conditions across Gaza and the West Bank, and Phase 0 institutions are deliberately designed to function **asymmetrically** across the two arenas. Treating them identically would be both unrealistic and destabilizing.

Gaza and the West Bank differ fundamentally in governance, security control, territorial fragmentation, and civilian exposure:

- **Gaza:** Governed by Hamas with no Israeli civilian presence and near-total Israeli external control
- **West Bank:** Governed in part by the Palestinian Authority under the layered Area A/B/C structure, with extensive Israeli military presence and large settlement populations

MCF explicitly adapts to these differences rather than forcing symmetry.

**Representation Implication (Hybrid Model):** For joint security institutions (UVB liaison and JSVC governance), Gaza and the West Bank are treated as **distinct operational entities** but participate through a **Palestinian Joint Delegation** that casts a single concurrence on security-sensitive decisions. This preserves operational differentiation while avoiding “two‑against‑one” dynamics at the top level.

### Gaza: High-Intensity Containment Mode

In Gaza, Phase 0 institutions operate in a **high-intensity containment mode**.

The Unilateral Verification Body (UVB) and eventual JSVC focus narrowly on:

- Incident verification
- Infrastructure damage assessment
- Humanitarian deconfliction
- Escalation attribution

There is no assumption of routine cooperation or integrated enforcement. Hamas is not treated as a partner or recognized authority, but as a *de facto controlling actor whose behavior is documented, constrained procedurally, and linked to consequences*.

**Protected Civic Corridors (PCCs)** in Gaza are limited almost exclusively to:

- Utilities
- Medical access
- Repair windows

These operate with tight monitoring and automatic suspension rules.

**Civic Membership Status (CMS)** uptake is expected to be minimal initially due to intimidation risk. Anti-intimidation architecture is therefore more externally anchored:

- Offshore processing
- External SAZ use
- Remote arbitration

In Gaza, MCF's purpose is not integration but **damage containment and escalation dampening**.

### West Bank: Low-Intensity Governance-Overlay Mode

In the West Bank, Phase 0 institutions operate in a **low-intensity governance-overlay mode**.

The presence of PA security forces, Israeli civil administration structures, and municipal governance allows for more granular procedural layering.

The JSVC interacts with multiple security actors, not just one dominant force, and focuses heavily on:

- Incident attribution
- Settler–Palestinian violence documentation
- Deconfliction failures in Areas B and C

**Protected Civic Corridors (PCCs)** in the West Bank are more numerous but more tightly scoped, often facility-based rather than corridor-based (e.g., specific hospitals, substations, or road segments).

**Civic Membership Status (CMS)** uptake is expected to be significantly higher in the West Bank, including among Palestinians and a small subset of Israeli settlers under strict individual, non-territorial eligibility rules.

Anti-intimidation mechanisms focus less on armed group coercion and more on community-level retaliation and political pressure.

### Asynchronous Phase Advancement

Critically, **Phase 0 does not require synchronization** between Gaza and the West Bank.

MCF allows the framework to advance at different speeds, with different functional emphases, and even temporary suspension in one theater without invalidating progress in the other.

Gaza may remain in a long-term containment posture while the West Bank moves toward deeper civic and economic participation, or vice versa.

This decoupling is intentional: tying the two arenas together mechanically would hand veto power to the most volatile actor at any given moment.

### Structural Identity, Operational Differentiation

In short, Phase 0 institutions are **structurally identical but operationally differentiated**.

The same verification standards, reporting rules, and escalation logic apply across both territories, but their deployment reflects radically different security and governance realities.

The framework's credibility depends precisely on this asymmetry: it manages conflict where it is violent, builds capacity where it is possible, and refuses to let failure in one arena collapse progress in the other.

---

## Water and Critical Resources: Operational Equity Without Sovereign Resolution

The Managed Coexistence Framework (MCF) **does not attempt to resolve resource sovereignty or historical allocation disputes**, particularly around water, in its early or mid phases. Aquifer ownership, allocation ratios, and long-term control—especially in the Mountain Aquifer and Gaza's desalination dependency—are treated as **final-status political questions** that cannot be technocratically solved without collapsing the framework.

MCF therefore draws a hard line between **operational equity** and **sovereign equity**. It manages the former aggressively while explicitly deferring the latter.

### Phase 0–1: Life-Critical Operational Protection

In Phase 0–1, water falls under Protected Civic Corridors (PCCs) strictly as a **life-critical operational system**, not as a distributive justice project. This includes protection of:

- Pumping stations
- Desalination plants
- Pipelines
- Power inputs to water facilities
- Repair access during hostilities

The objective is **continuity and harm reduction**, not reallocation.

JSVC verification focuses on whether water infrastructure is being deliberately targeted, obstructed, or withheld in ways that violate agreed deconfliction rules—not on whether underlying allocations are fair. This avoids turning PCCs into implicit adjudicators of sovereignty or rights.

### Structural Inequality: Acknowledged but Sequenced

MCF does **not treat structural water inequality as irrelevant**. Instead, it creates a **sequenced pathway** from deconfliction to conditional capacity equalization, without asserting ownership claims.

In Phase 1, MCF permits **capacity-building projects** that increase total available supply rather than redistribute existing shares:

- Desalination expansion
- Wastewater recycling
- Leakage reduction
- Grid reliability improvements

These projects are financed and governed separately from PCC operations, precisely to avoid conflating humanitarian protection with political bargaining.

**The principle is additive:** increase the pie before arguing about slices.

### Later Phases: Procedural Resource Review

Only in later phases—if and when sustained stability exists—does MCF allow **procedural resource review mechanisms** to emerge.

These are not binding allocation authorities but **data-standardization and transparency bodies** that establish shared baselines:

- Extraction volumes
- Recharge rates
- Consumption patterns
- Infrastructure losses

The purpose is to make future negotiations possible without forcing them prematurely.

**Critical safeguard:** Participation in such mechanisms does not concede legal claims or prejudge outcomes. It preserves the option for future sovereign bargaining by preventing data warfare in the present.

### Gaza: Containment Priority

In Gaza specifically, MCF treats water vulnerability as a **containment priority** rather than a leverage point.

Desalination and power-water coupling are protected as civilian-critical systems regardless of governance disputes. Interruption of water as coercion is treated as a **high-severity deconfliction violation**, triggering rapid escalation within the Framework's response ladder.

This does not resolve Gaza's structural dependency, but it reduces the likelihood that water becomes a weapon while political conditions remain hostile.

### The Core Principle: Stabilize, Expand, Standardize, Defer

MCF addresses water inequity **indirectly and sequentially**:

1. **Stabilize access first** - Operational protection through PCCs
2. **Expand capacity second** - Additive infrastructure projects
3. **Standardize information third** - Shared data baselines
4. **Defer allocation politics** - Until they can be argued without violence

This is not a moral resolution—it is a governance strategy designed to keep water from remaining a permanent accelerant of conflict while preserving all parties' future claims intact.

MCF does not pretend that operational deconfliction equals justice, but it refuses to let unresolved sovereignty disputes justify civilian deprivation.

---

## Jerusalem: Special Exclusion with Individual Participation

The Managed Coexistence Framework (MCF) treats **Jerusalem** as a **special exclusion zone in its early and mid phases**, precisely because of its unparalleled symbolic, legal, and religious sensitivity.

### Territorial Exclusion

Jerusalem is **explicitly excluded from Special Administrative Zone (SAZ) consideration** in Phases 0–2.

This exclusion is not an oversight but a deliberate stabilizing choice: any attempt to pilot shared governance, international administration, or territorial experimentation in Jerusalem would instantly collapse the framework by forcing premature final-status implications.

MCF therefore treats Jerusalem as *procedurally exceptional*:

- No SAZ designation
- No pilot sovereignty arrangements
- No symbolic reconfiguration

These restrictions remain in place until and unless far later convergence phases are voluntarily triggered by all affected populations.

### Individual Civic Participation

Exclusion from SAZ consideration does not mean exclusion from the Framework entirely. MCF distinguishes sharply between **territorial governance** and **individual civic participation**.

**East Jerusalem Palestinian residents**—who occupy a legally anomalous position as permanent residents under Israeli law rather than citizens—**are eligible for Civic Membership Status (CMS)** on the same individual, opt-in, non-territorial basis as any other applicant.

CMS eligibility is tied to personal conduct and acceptance of the Confederal Rights Compact, not to claims over Jerusalem's sovereignty or municipal control.

Participation confers access to Framework benefits (such as arbitration, credential portability, or protected participation in shared institutions outside Jerusalem), but **does not alter residency status, citizenship claims, or municipal authority** within the city.

### Avoiding Normalization and Exclusion Traps

CMS for East Jerusalem residents is designed to **avoid both normalization and exclusion traps**:

- **Denying eligibility** would reinforce political marginalization and incentivize disengagement or radicalization
- **Granting collective or territorial recognition** would be seen by Israel as a sovereignty breach

MCF resolves this by allowing **individual civic participation without collective political inference**.

CMS holders in Jerusalem:

- Gain no special privileges inside the city
- Have no policing role
- Receive no corridor designation
- Hold no municipal veto

Violations of nonviolence or anti-intimidation standards result in revocation, just as elsewhere.

### The Core Principle

In short, Jerusalem is treated as **off-limits for territorial experimentation but not for human participation**.

The Framework freezes the city spatially while allowing its residents—on both sides of the Green Line—to engage civically beyond it.

This asymmetry is intentional: MCF preserves Jerusalem as a deferred final-status question while refusing to make its residents hostages to perpetual political paralysis.

---

## Religious Sites Beyond Jerusalem: Containment Without Integration

The Managed Coexistence Framework (MCF) treats **religious flashpoints outside Jerusalem**—such as **Cave of the Patriarchs**, **Rachel's Tomb**, and **Joseph's Tomb**—as **security-sensitive exclusion zones for political experimentation**, but **not as exclusions from procedural protection**. Unlike Jerusalem, these sites are not deferred wholesale from the Framework; instead, they are governed under a **containment-without-integration doctrine**. MCF explicitly avoids introducing new governance arrangements, shared administration, or symbolic reforms at these locations in early and mid phases, recognizing that any perceived alteration to control, access, or status quo would almost certainly trigger escalation.

### Operational Deconfliction, Not Governance Reform

In Phase 0–1, MCF's role at these sites is limited to **operational deconfliction and harm prevention**, not governance reform. Protected Civic Corridors (PCCs) may apply only in the narrowest sense—such as time-bound protection for emergency medical access, utility repair, or civilian evacuation routes during periods of heightened tension—but **never to routine access control, worship scheduling, or security arrangements**. Existing control regimes remain in place, whether Israeli, Palestinian, or mixed, and MCF does not attempt to arbitrate competing religious or historical claims. This avoids turning the Framework into a de facto referee of sacred sovereignty disputes.

### Verification Without Adjudication

Verification mechanisms (UVB/JSVC) are nevertheless **fully active around these sites**. Incidents occurring at or near them—clashes, provocations, use of force, access restrictions—are documented with heightened scrutiny because of their known escalation potential. The purpose is not to adjudicate sanctity or rights, but to **prevent narrative weaponization** by establishing clear factual records when violence occurs. These records feed into escalation management, rollback triggers, and external guarantor responses, rather than into local policy changes.

### Protecting People, Not Restructuring Control

Crucially, MCF draws a bright line between **protecting people** and **restructuring control**. Individual participation—such as CMS eligibility for residents, workers, or pilgrims—remains possible where safety and voluntariness can be assured, but CMS confers **no special access rights, security privileges, or standing related to religious sites**. Any attempt to use Framework participation to advance claims over holy places is grounds for revocation. This applies symmetrically: neither settlers nor Palestinians may leverage MCF mechanisms to alter the status quo at these locations.

### The Core Principle: Insulation Over Integration

In effect, MCF treats non-Jerusalem religious flashpoints as **escalation amplifiers that must be insulated, not integrated**. The Framework stabilizes the perimeter—through monitoring, deconfliction, and documentation—while refusing to touch the core political and theological disputes that make these sites combustible. This approach is intentionally conservative: it prioritizes preventing religious sites from becoming routine triggers for broader violence, without pretending that technocratic governance can resolve questions of sacred space.

---

## Refugees and Diaspora: Structured Postponement

The Managed Coexistence Framework (MCF) **intentionally separates refugee and diaspora questions from in-territory conflict management**, because collapsing them into a single track has historically paralyzed both.

MCF does **not** attempt to resolve the Palestinian refugee issue or the right of return, nor does it implicitly negate them. Instead, it adopts a doctrine of **explicit deferral with non-preclusion**: nothing in the framework forecloses future refugee claims, but nothing in the framework operationalizes them in early or mid phases.

This is a conscious design choice to prevent the most intractable final-status issue from vetoing conflict-management mechanisms meant to reduce present-day violence.

### CMS Eligibility for Refugees

Palestinian refugees residing in **Jordan**, **Lebanon**, or **Syria** are **not categorically excluded** from Civic Membership Status (CMS), but their eligibility is **functionally constrained and phased**.

In early stages, CMS is primarily designed for individuals who can safely and meaningfully participate in Framework institutions without triggering demographic, security, or sovereignty crises.

For most refugees in host countries, CMS eligibility—if offered at all—would initially be limited to **non-residential, non-territorial participation**:

- Professional credentialing
- Arbitration access
- Training programs
- Institutional roles tied to external SAZs

### What CMS Does Not Confer

CMS for refugees:

- Does **not** confer residency rights inside Israel or the occupied territories
- Does **not** alter refugee legal status under host-country or international law
- Does **not** constitute a mechanism of return

### Avoiding Two Destabilizing Errors

MCF is careful to avoid two opposite but equally destabilizing errors:

1. **Treating refugees as irrelevant** - which would delegitimize the framework among Palestinians
2. **Treating CMS as a backdoor right of return** - which would collapse Israeli participation

Explicit language is required—and assumed—that **CMS participation by refugees does not prejudice, satisfy, waive, or adjudicate claims related to return, compensation, or restitution**.

### Right of Return as Deferred Political Question

Right of return remains a **deferred political question**, not a technocratic one, and is reserved for a later phase of voluntary convergence or final-status negotiation.

This deferral is not silence; it is a guardrail against premature foreclosure. The framework acknowledges that:

- Refugee claims exist
- These claims are legitimate to many Palestinians
- They cannot be resolved by administrative integration alone

### Refugees as Future Political Constituency

In practical terms, MCF treats refugees and diaspora Palestinians as a **future political constituency**, not an early operational driver.

Their inclusion is designed to be:

- Incremental
- Optional
- Non-territorial

This approach continues until conditions exist where mass return or resettlement discussions would not collapse security, governance, or regional stability.

### The Core Principle: Structured Postponement

MCF's stance on refugees is therefore neither resolution nor denial, but **structured postponement**—on the premise that unmanaged violence today makes just outcomes tomorrow less likely, not more.

By separating present-day conflict management from future political resolution, MCF avoids transforming conflict management into demographic warfare while still preserving refugees' political claims intact.

---

## Framework Entry Point: How Institutions Begin Without Mutual Agreement

MCF does not begin with negotiated consent or joint recognition. It begins with **unilateral, externally scaffolded mechanisms** that evolve into functional cooperation over time.

### Externalized Unilateral Verification Body (UVB)

A coalition of technically credible third parties establishes an initial **Unilateral Verification Body (UVB)**. Its mandate is intentionally narrow:

- Technical incident verification
- Civilian infrastructure damage assessment
- Evidence preservation and reporting

The UVB does not assign political blame or exercise enforcement powers. Participation is voluntary and non-recognitional.

### Parallel Commitments and Humanitarian Anchors

Early cooperation is anchored in domains that are difficult to reject publicly:

- Utilities (water, electricity)
- Medical evacuation and hospital access
- Repair access for civilian technicians

Each party makes **parallel unilateral commitments** regarding its own conduct. No joint declarations or symbolic agreements are required.

Over time, liaison officers, shared evidence standards, and incident review procedures emerge, at which point the UVB evolves functionally into the **Joint Security Verification Commission (JSVC)**.

---

## Security Provision and Enforcement Architecture

### Separation of Roles

MCF explicitly separates **verification** from **kinetic enforcement**.

- The JSVC verifies, standardizes, and documents incidents.
- National forces retain all kinetic authority.
- External guarantors apply diplomatic, legal, and economic pressure.

### Who Provides Security

- Israeli security forces continue to provide security where they currently operate.
- Palestinian security actors operate where capacity exists.
- No new army or police force is created in Phases 0–1.

MCF does not delay or constrain immediate self-defense actions.

### Enforcement Without Command Authority

JSVC enforcement is indirect and procedural:

- Violations trigger automatic non-kinetic consequences
- Access to Framework benefits is suspended or revoked
- Corridor privileges, permits, and programs are rolled back
- Persistent violations escalate to external guarantors

Accountability is procedural rather than coercive.

---

## Protected Civic Corridors (PCCs)

PCCs are **function-based**, not territorial or population-based.

### Core Characteristics

- Single-purpose (utilities, medical, repair)
- Heavily monitored
- Time-bound and reviewable
- Automatically suspendable upon violation

### Relationship to Settlements

Settlements are **not designated PCC endpoints** in Phases 0–1.

While shared infrastructure may incidentally serve multiple populations, PCC designation applies to **facilities**, not communities. This prevents normalization of settlement expansion or territorial claims.

---

## Civic Membership Status (CMS)

CMS is an **individual, opt-in legal status**, layered on top of existing citizenship or residency.

### Eligibility Requirements

- Security vetting
- Civic education completion
- Acceptance of the Confederal Rights Compact
- Formal nonviolence commitment within MCF domains

### Scope and Limits

- CMS confers access to Framework benefits and institutions
- CMS does not grant land rights, political recognition, or immunity
- CMS participation is reversible and privilege-based

### Applicability to Settlers

Residents of Israeli settlements may apply for CMS **only as individuals**, subject to enhanced scrutiny and explicit constraints:

- No collective settlement participation
- No use of CMS to assert territorial or political claims
- Full compliance with non-discrimination and nonviolence rules

No settlement entity, governing body, or collective is recognized through MCF mechanisms.

---

## Palestinian Buy-In and Collaboration Concerns

Phase 1's design deliberately avoids requiring formal agreement from Hamas or the Palestinian Authority in order to prevent factional veto over civilian participation. However, this creates a legitimacy risk if requirements such as civic education and nonviolence pledges are perceived as ideological conditioning or collaboration. Addressing this risk requires clear design boundaries that separate civic functionality from political allegiance.

### Civic Education Curriculum Design

The civic education curriculum cannot be designed or controlled by any single party to the conflict without undermining credibility. If Israel, the PA, Hamas, or a patron state is perceived as the author, the program will be rejected as indoctrination rather than preparation for civilian participation.

To avoid this, the curriculum must be developed by an **independent, multilateral consortium** composed of:

- Non-aligned constitutional scholars
- International civil society educators
- Human rights organizations with credibility beyond the immediate conflict

While conflict parties may review the curriculum for compliance with basic humanitarian standards, they must not have editorial control. The curriculum must be publicly available, uniform for all participants, and narrowly scoped to practical civic competencies rather than political narratives.

### Content Scope

The content of civic education must focus on **how individuals function within a civilian system**, not on what political positions they are expected to hold. This means emphasizing:

- Noncombatant protections
- Nonviolent dispute resolution
- Local governance processes
- Labor and municipal rights
- Access to civilian services

It must **explicitly exclude**:

- Recognition clauses
- Historical interpretations
- Sovereignty claims
- Requirements to endorse any party's legitimacy

Transparency is critical: secrecy or individualized screening would convert education into a loyalty test.

### Eligibility Criteria: Behavior Over Affiliation

Eligibility for Civic Membership Status must be based on **individual behavior rather than factional identity**. Excluding applicants solely on the basis of Hamas affiliation would disqualify a significant portion of the population, politicize the system, and guarantee widespread rejection.

Organizational affiliation, whether past or present, should not automatically disqualify participation. Instead, eligibility should hinge on:

- A personal commitment to nonviolence in civilian life
- Willingness to operate within civilian legal structures
- The absence of active participation in armed operations

This approach aligns with established **Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration (DDR) frameworks**, which prioritize future conduct over past association. Importantly, this does not require Hamas as an organization to endorse the system; it prevents factional politics from determining civilian access to stability.

### Preventing Collaboration Accusations

The greatest risk to Phase 1 is the perception that participation constitutes collaboration. If civic status signals ideological submission or acceptance of an imposed political framework, individuals risk social ostracism, retaliation, and loss of dignity. No program can succeed under those conditions.

Preventing this requires a design that frames participation as **contractual and reciprocal** rather than coercive.

#### Reciprocal Obligations

Civic pledges made by participants must be paired with **explicit obligations placed on the administering authority**. While participants commit to nonviolence and civic conduct, the authority must formally commit to:

- Due process
- Protection from collective punishment
- Non-retaliation for lawful political speech
- Clearly defined pathways to expanded rights

A one-sided pledge structure would be read as submission; a reciprocal framework establishes mutual obligation and accountability.

#### Immediate, Tangible Benefits

Civic Membership Status must deliver immediate, tangible benefits that are visible and meaningful in daily life:

- Work authorization
- Defined freedom of movement within designated areas
- Access to civilian courts or ombudsman mechanisms
- Protection from arbitrary detention

If participation produces only symbolic recognition without material improvement, it will be dismissed as loyalty theater.

#### Collective Entry Options

Participation should be structured to allow **collective entry** rather than forcing isolated individual compliance. Enabling enrollment through neighborhoods, unions, professional associations, or municipal bodies:

- Reduces the social cost of participation
- Reframes the program as communal civic reconstruction rather than individual defection
- Lowers stigma and increases legitimacy

#### No Ideological Policing

The system must explicitly reject ideological policing. It should state clearly that:

- Political beliefs are not monitored
- Participants are not required to renounce resistance as a concept
- Lawful political expression is protected

The nonviolence pledge must be limited strictly to **conduct in civilian life**, not belief, identity, or historical interpretation. This distinction is critical in avoiding cultural and political backlash.

#### Reversibility

Participation must be reversible. Individuals must be able to withdraw from the program without criminal penalties or retaliation, with the only consequence being the loss of associated benefits. If exit carries risk, entry will be rare. Reversibility signals that participation is pragmatic rather than coercive.

### Legitimacy Through Lived Experience

It is important to acknowledge that no design can entirely eliminate accusations of normalization or collaboration at the outset. Legitimacy in such systems does not emerge through persuasion or elite endorsement but through **lived experience**.

As civilian life becomes more stable, predictable, and materially viable, participation becomes socially normalized. Over time, the system's legitimacy grows bottom-up, independent of factional approval.

---

## Organizational Transformation Pathways

The Managed Coexistence Framework (MCF) treats participation as **individual-only by default**. There is no automatic pathway by which an organization—particularly an armed organization such as Hamas—gains institutional standing, negotiating status, or veto power within the Framework simply by announcing acceptance or undergoing internal reform.

### No Recognition by Declaration

MCF does not create a fast track for organizational legitimacy. An armed group cannot transition into Framework participation through:

- Declaration of intent
- Political transformation at the leadership level
- Electoral success
- International endorsement

This is not because transformation is impossible, but because **declarations are cheap, reversible, and frequently deceptive**. History is littered with armed organizations that declared ceasefires, signed agreements, and then resumed violence when conditions shifted.

MCF therefore adopts a **behavioral, not declaratory** standard: organizational transformation is assessed by conduct over time, not by statements or formal restructuring.

### Individual Participation Pathway

Individuals formerly affiliated with armed organizations—including Hamas—**are not categorically excluded** from Civic Membership Status (CMS). Affiliation alone is not a bar.

However, CMS eligibility remains strictly individual:

- Personal acceptance of the nonviolence pledge
- Personal conduct review
- Personal revocation upon violation

Former combatants, political operatives, or members who meet individual eligibility standards can participate in MCF institutions. This does not confer any benefit or standing to the organization itself.

### Late-Stage Conditional Organizational Participation

In late convergence phases (Phase 2 or later), the Framework may open a **conditional, functional, and limited** track for organizational participation—but only under stringent conditions:

1. **Verified Disarmament:** The organization must demonstrably divest itself of military capacity through verifiable, externally monitored disarmament
2. **Demobilization:** Armed wings must be disbanded, not merely renamed or reassigned
3. **Sustained Compliance:** A multi-year track record of nonviolence, non-interference, and respect for Framework institutions must be established before any organizational engagement is considered
4. **No Veto Power:** Even if admitted, organizational participation does not confer veto rights, negotiating equivalence, or sovereignty claims

### Functional, Not Political Integration

Organizational participation, if it occurs at all, is:

- **Functional:** Limited to specific roles (e.g., humanitarian coordination, local governance liaison) rather than political representation
- **Reversible:** Subject to suspension or termination upon violation
- **Probationary:** Ongoing, not permanent; continued participation is contingent on continued compliance

This structure ensures that transformation is **earned through sustained behavior**, not granted through political recognition.

### The Core Principle

MCF refuses to let armed organizations use the Framework as a vehicle for legitimacy laundering. Individual participation remains open; organizational participation is deferred, conditional, and revocable.

The Framework's value lies precisely in its refusal to trade procedural inclusion for political recognition—because doing so would replicate the failures of past agreements that empowered armed factions without securing durable behavioral change.

---

## Dispute Resolution Mechanics

The Managed Coexistence Framework (MCF) treats **dispute resolution as a core stabilizing function**, not a peripheral service. It deliberately differentiates between **three categories of disputes**, each handled through distinct but interoperable mechanisms with strict jurisdictional limits to prevent forum shopping, politicization, or quiet expansion into sovereignty adjudication.

### Individual–Individual Disputes

For disputes between individuals (e.g., commercial conflicts, labor disagreements, contractual breaches, or CMS-related conduct issues), MCF relies on **confederal arbitration courts**.

**Structure:**

- Civil, non-criminal bodies
- Standardized procedural code anchored in due process
- Evidentiary transparency
- Appeal rights

**Access:**

- Participation is opt-in and benefit-linked
- Access to arbitration is a condition of CMS participation or specific Framework programs

**Enforcement:**

- Decisions enforceable only within MCF benefit scope (contract enforcement, credential suspension, access revocation)
- Recognition agreements with domestic courts where applicable

Arbitration does not replace national courts; it offers a predictable, neutral venue where cross-jurisdictional disputes would otherwise be unresolvable.

### Individual–Authority Disputes

For disputes between individuals and authorities (e.g., allegations of discrimination, procedural abuse, wrongful PCC exclusion, or CMS revocation), MCF employs a **review-and-remedy model** rather than direct adjudication of sovereign acts.

**Process:**

- Individuals file complaints with an independent review panel operating under the Confederal Rights Compact
- The panel does not invalidate national laws or orders
- It determines whether Framework procedures and rights guarantees were followed

**Remedies (framework-internal only):**

- Reinstatement of access
- Correction of records
- Compensation from framework funds
- Referral for guarantor review

Where violations implicate domestic law or international humanitarian norms, MCF documentation is preserved and transmitted outward rather than adjudicated internally. This preserves accountability without claiming superior legal authority.

### Institution–Institution Disputes

For disputes between institutions (e.g., disagreements between JSVC units, host states, guarantors, or SAZ administrators), MCF uses a **tiered mediation and certification process**.

**Initial stage:** Structured mediation led by the institutional continuity body, focused on mandate interpretation and procedural compliance.

**Escalation:** If unresolved, disputes escalate to a guarantor review panel composed of functionally distinct guarantors (verification, leverage, regional). No guarantor may adjudicate disputes in which they are directly implicated.

**Outcomes:**

- Binding procedural clarifications
- Mandate adjustments
- Trigger certifications

There is no mechanism for institutions to sue one another for sovereignty claims or territorial authority within MCF.

### Jurisdictional Boundaries

Across all categories, MCF enforces strict limits:

**Non-prejudice rule:** No dispute resolution outcome may be used to assert or deny sovereignty, territorial claims, or final-status rights.

**Excluded matters:**

- Criminal matters
- Security operations
- Military conduct

These remain outside MCF jurisdiction and are handled by national or international mechanisms as applicable.

### Graduated and Reversible Resolution

Dispute resolution is **graduated and reversible**:

- Sanctions and remedies escalate only with repeated non-compliance
- Good-faith correction restores standing
- First-time procedural errors do not trigger punitive responses

### The Core Principle: Containment Without Absorption

MCF resolves disputes by:

- **Containing them within the smallest competent forum**
- **Applying remedies that stabilize participation** rather than punish identity
- **Exporting unresolved legal or political questions** to external systems rather than absorbing them

This prevents dispute resolution from becoming a proxy battlefield while still giving participants a credible, fair, and predictable way to resolve conflicts without violence.

## External Special Administrative Zone (SAZ) as a Surrogate Pilot

Where in-territory implementation is politically infeasible, MCF permits a **temporary, externally hosted SAZ** in a neighboring or partner state.

### Purpose

- Institutional incubation
- JSVC headquarters
- Civic membership processing
- Arbitration and training

### Constraints

- Host state retains full sovereignty
- SAZ is time-limited and non-precedential
- No refugee resettlement or permanent relocation
- Explicit prohibition on serving as final-status substitute

External SAZs function as **pressure-controlled staging areas**, not political end states.

---

## Internal SAZ Site Selection (Phase 2)

Internal SAZ implementation is deferred until long-term procedural stability is demonstrated.

### Site Selection Principles

- No prejudgment of final-status claims
- Temporary, leased, and reversible arrangements
- Voluntary residency with demographic caps
- Functional justification over symbolic geography

### Site Archetypes

- Non-contiguous, purpose-built zones (preferred)
- Border-adjacent infrastructure corridors (conditional)
- Symbolic or sacred urban areas (explicitly excluded initially)

Rejection of a proposed SAZ site does not invalidate the Framework.

## Security Force Relationships in SAZs

Security arrangements in SAZs are one of the most failure-prone elements of any civilian framework, because ambiguity around policing and command almost always resolves itself through force rather than law. If the MCF does not define security relationships explicitly, SAZs will default to the most powerful actor's rules, destroying civilian legitimacy. The security architecture therefore prioritizes **clarity of roles, strict limits on authority, and pre-agreed incident command logic**, even under asymmetric power conditions.

### Layered Security Responsibility

SAZs should not be policed as extensions of existing military control, nor as zones of full autonomous self-policing. Instead, they must be treated as **civilian-protected spaces with layered security responsibility**.

**MCF Civilian Security Service:**

Day-to-day policing inside SAZs is conducted by an **MCF civilian security service** whose mandate is limited to:

- Public order
- Crime prevention
- Protection of civilians and infrastructure

**Characteristics:**

- Lightly armed
- Trained explicitly in civilian policing rather than counterinsurgency
- Structurally prohibited from intelligence-gathering for any party outside the framework

Its legitimacy depends on being seen as neither an occupying force nor a factional militia.

### IDF Role: External Security Authority

The **IDF's role** in SAZs must be clearly circumscribed. The IDF retains **external security authority**—meaning responsibility for threats originating outside the SAZ that pose immediate risk to life—but not routine policing powers inside the zone.

**Entry conditions:**

- Governed by predefined trigger conditions (verified imminent threats)
- Subject to post-incident review

**Explicitly excluded:**

- Routine patrols inside SAZs
- Arrests for ordinary crime
- Intelligence sweeps

These activities would collapse the civilian character of the zone and are prohibited except under emergency override provisions.

### PA Security Force Coordination (West Bank)

In the **West Bank**, the relationship with PA security forces requires special care.

- PA forces may be permitted a role in coordination and information-sharing, but **not unilateral operational control** inside SAZs
- Where PA forces already exercise policing authority (primarily Areas A and B), the MCF civilian security service functions as a **parallel civilian authority**, not a subordinate one
- This prevents SAZs from being absorbed into factional security competition while allowing coordination on crime, traffic, and emergency response where practical

### Gaza: No Formal Cooperation with Hamas Forces

In **Gaza**, where Hamas maintains de facto security control, the framework avoids formal security cooperation with Hamas forces altogether.

**Alternative approach:**

- External monitoring
- MCF civilian security presence
- Tightly defined IDF perimeter authority

### Incident Command: Sequential Authority, Not Joint Command

Chain of command during incidents must be **predefined, automatic, and scenario-specific**.

**Routine civilian incidents** (crime, disputes, traffic, public order):

- MCF civilian security service has sole authority

**Escalations involving armed actors inside an SAZ:**

- Priority: containment, evacuation, and de-escalation by MCF forces
- IDF involvement only if predefined thresholds are crossed (confirmed presence of heavy weapons or imminent mass-casualty risk)
- PA security forces do not assume command during such incidents, even in Areas A or B

**Critical principle: No joint command structures during live incidents.**

Joint command sounds cooperative on paper but fails in practice under stress, especially between forces with asymmetric power and conflicting mandates. Instead, the framework relies on **sequential authority**:

1. MCF civilian security leads within the SAZ
2. External military forces intervene only if and when clearly defined conditions are met
3. All interventions are subject to after-action review by an independent oversight mechanism

### Information Flow: Threat-Specific Only

Intelligence sharing is limited to **threat-specific alerts**, not general surveillance or profiling of participants.

MCF security does **not** function as an intelligence arm of the IDF, PA, or any other actor. Once civilian security is perceived as an intelligence pipeline, civilian cooperation evaporates.

### Accountability Mechanisms

Any use of force inside an SAZ—by MCF security, IDF, or PA forces—must trigger:

- Mandatory documentation
- Civilian notification
- Independent review

This is not primarily about punishment; it is about maintaining the credibility of the claim that SAZs are governed by rules rather than discretion. Without visible accountability, the distinction between "protected zone" and "temporary exception" disappears.

### The Core Principle: Procedurally Bound Power

The framework must acknowledge the underlying asymmetry honestly. The IDF will always retain overwhelming force capacity. The purpose of the SAZ security architecture is not to deny that reality, but to **bind it procedurally** so that power is exercised predictably and rarely, rather than arbitrarily and routinely.

SAZs succeed only if civilians believe that security decisions are rule-bound, not contingent on political mood or factional pressure.

**Summary:**

- SAZs are policed by a civilian MCF security service with primary authority inside the zone
- PA coordination is permitted where appropriate, but not PA command
- IDF retains tightly constrained external security authority
- Chain of command is linear, not joint
- Intervention thresholds are explicit
- Accountability is unavoidable

Anything less will turn SAZs into symbolic spaces that collapse the first time real violence tests them.

---

## Settlements: Explicit Treatment

MCF adopts a **non-prejudicial, non-normalizing posture** toward settlements:

- No endorsement
- No dismantlement mandate
- No legalization or expansion authority
- No integration into Palestinian governance

Settlements are treated as existing civilian populations under Israeli law, without conferring permanence or legitimacy through the Framework.

---

## External Guarantor Architecture

No single external guarantor can credibly underwrite a long-term conflict-management framework under asymmetric conditions. Each obvious candidate fails in a different way if asked to act alone:

- **United States:** Has the security leverage Israel accepts, but lacks Palestinian trust and policy continuity across administrations
- **European Union:** Offers procedural legitimacy and legal credibility, but has limited coercive leverage and slow decision-making
- **Regional Arab states:** Provide cultural and political legitimacy with Palestinians, but raise Israeli concerns about bias and proxy agendas
- **United Nations:** Supplies formal international legitimacy, but is politically unacceptable to Israel and operationally constrained

Any single guarantor becomes either a veto point, a legitimacy sink, or a hostage to its own domestic politics.

### Layered Guarantor Architecture

The Managed Coexistence Framework relies on a **layered guarantor architecture**, in which different actors anchor different functions rather than attempting to impose a unitary sponsor.

#### Security Leverage: United States

Security leverage and deterrence credibility are provided primarily by the United States, but strictly as a **backstop rather than a manager**. The U.S. does not chair institutions, control verification, or arbitrate outcomes; its role is to signal consequences, provide diplomatic insulation, and ensure that violations carry costs Israel takes seriously. This preserves Israeli buy-in without allowing American politics to dominate daily governance.

#### Verification and Standards: European Union

Verification, evidentiary standards, and rights compliance are anchored by European actors—primarily the European Union and select member states—whose institutional strength lies in law, auditing, and procedural legitimacy rather than force. Their mandate is deliberately narrow: to ensure credibility of findings, consistency of standards, and continuity of records. They do not command forces, impose sanctions, or mediate political disputes. This separation protects neutrality while making MCF outputs usable in courts, donor systems, and diplomatic forums.

#### Regional Legitimacy: Rotating Anchor States

Regional legitimacy and interface are supplied by **rotating regional anchor states**—such as Jordan, Egypt, Morocco, or the UAE—each participating in limited, function-specific roles (hosting liaison offices, supporting external SAZs, facilitating regional coordination). No regional guarantor holds a permanent seat or unilateral veto, and participation is time-limited and modular. This avoids overburdening any single state and prevents the framework from becoming an extension of regional power politics.

#### Institutional Continuity: Treaty-Chartered Body

Crucially, long-term continuity is **not entrusted to any state at all**. Instead, the framework depends on a purpose-built, treaty-chartered institutional body responsible for:

- Record-keeping
- Certification of triggers
- Archival integrity
- Procedural memory

This institution is staffed by career professionals rather than political appointees, funded through firewalled mechanisms, and insulated from electoral turnover. It does not make political decisions; it preserves the system's continuity so that decisions made in Year 5 still bind in Year 50.

### Binding Mechanisms

Guarantors are not bound for 50–100 years through promises, but through **structure and cost**:

- **Phase-based commitments:** Renewable with defined notice periods
- **Exit costs:** Withdrawal is expensive but not impossible
- **Sunk institutional investments:** Built infrastructure and trained personnel create inertia
- **Reputational exposure:** Reliance on MCF outputs for diplomacy and legal positioning creates incentives to remain engaged

Longevity emerges from **repeated recommitment and distributed ownership**, not from any single actor's goodwill or dominance.

### The Core Insight

Neutrality and durability are achieved not by choosing the "right" guarantor, but by **fragmenting authority, distributing legitimacy, and preventing capture**. The framework survives precisely because no guarantor is indispensable—and none is powerful enough to collapse it alone.

---

## Funding Architecture

The Managed Coexistence Framework (MCF) cannot rely on a single funder without undermining either neutrality or durability. Each obvious funding source fails in a predictable way if asked to carry the burden alone:

- **United States funding:** Creates dependency that Palestinians distrust and subjects the framework to American electoral cycles
- **European Union funding:** Provides legitimacy but insufficient leverage; perceived as soft power without teeth
- **Party-funded systems:** Any arrangement where Israel or Palestine directly funds operations creates veto power and accusations of capture
- **Gulf state funding:** Raises concerns about proxy agendas and conditions that compromise neutrality

MCF resolves this through a **firewalled, multi-source funding architecture** that separates money from authority.

### Tier 1: Treaty-Chartered Endowment (Core Functions)

A permanent endowment funds the framework's essential institutional infrastructure:

- JSVC operations and staffing
- Record-keeping and archival systems
- Certification and verification procedures
- Career professional salaries

**Funding sources:**

- Initial capitalization from multilateral donors
- Sovereign wealth fund contributions (structured as grants, not loans)
- Private foundation endowments with explicit non-interference clauses

**Governance:**

- Endowment is legally separate from operational institutions
- Disbursement follows pre-agreed formulas, not discretionary decisions
- No single contributor controls more than 15% of endowment capital
- Withdrawal requires multi-year notice and forfeiture of governance participation

The endowment exists to ensure **institutional continuity independent of political cycles**. Core functions continue even during periods of reduced voluntary participation.

### Tier 2: Benefit-Linked Party Contributions

Optional services that provide direct benefits to participants are funded through **escrowed fees** paid by the parties themselves:

- Work permit processing fees
- Arbitration court filing fees
- Credential verification services
- Commercial corridor access fees

**Structure:**

- Fees are deposited into escrow accounts managed by the treaty-chartered body
- Neither party can withhold payment to leverage the other
- Services are self-sustaining once participation reaches threshold levels
- Surplus funds flow to the endowment, not back to contributors

This creates **buy-in through investment**: parties fund services they actually use, which aligns incentives without creating dependency.

### Tier 3: Project-Based Competitive Streams

Specific initiatives—infrastructure projects, training programs, pilot zones—are funded through **competitive grant mechanisms**:

- Multiple donors contribute to pooled funds
- Projects are selected by technical criteria, not political preference
- Implementation is contracted to neutral operators
- Evaluation is independent and public

**Examples:**

- PCC infrastructure upgrades funded by World Bank pooled facility
- Civic education curriculum development funded by EU competitive grants
- SAZ pilot construction funded by consortium of regional development banks

This tier provides **flexibility without capture**: funding can scale up or down without affecting core operations.

### Legal Separation of Money from Authority

The funding architecture is designed so that **no contributor can convert financial leverage into operational control**:

- Donors do not sit on operational boards
- Funding agreements are multi-year and cannot be withdrawn mid-cycle
- Earmarking is prohibited for core functions
- Financial audits are conducted by rotating, independent auditors

The principle is simple: **those who pay do not decide, and those who decide do not pay**. This prevents the framework from becoming an instrument of any funder's foreign policy.

### Sustainability Over Time

MCF funding is designed for generational timescales:

- Endowment principal is never spent; only returns fund operations
- Benefit-linked fees grow with participation
- Project funding is episodic and supplementary
- No single funding stream is essential to survival

The framework can operate in degraded mode during funding downturns without institutional collapse.

## Economic Architecture: Functional Economic Shell Without Sovereignty

The MCF cannot remain credible if it treats economic life as an afterthought layered on top of security and mobility. Trade, customs, currency, banking, and development are not peripheral frictions; they are the mechanisms through which daily coercion, rent-seeking, and dependency are reproduced. If these domains are left undefined, informal power will fill the gaps and undermine the framework from within. The economic architecture must therefore be **explicit, modular, and deliberately transitional** rather than aspirational.

### Framing: Stabilization, Not State-Building

At the outset, MCF does **not attempt to establish full economic sovereignty** for participating populations. Doing so would immediately collide with final-status disputes and trigger political vetoes. Instead, the economic layer is framed as a **civilian economic stabilization and normalization regime** that operates alongside existing sovereign claims without resolving them.

The goal is functional economic life under constraint, not premature state-building.

### Trade: Corridors as Semi-Autonomous Conduits

MCF corridors should be treated as **semi-autonomous economic conduits** rather than extensions of existing border regimes.

**Key principles:**

- Goods moving through corridors are subject to a simplified, standardized trade classification system focused on civilian and commercial categories, not security risk profiling by origin or political authority
- Emphasis on **predictability and speed** rather than volume
- Trade permissions tied to **product classes and firms**, not ad hoc approvals per shipment
- Reduction of discretionary choke points that invite corruption or political pressure

### Customs Administration: Independence and Legibility

Customs administration is handled by an **independent, corridor-level customs authority** operating under predefined tariff schedules and inspection protocols.

**Structural safeguards:**

- Not subordinated to Israeli, PA, or Hamas customs systems (though revenue-sharing or remittance arrangements can be negotiated separately)
- Customs rules inside the corridor must be **legible, stable, and insulated** from daily political leverage
- Inspection regimes prioritize **randomization and automation** over discretionary holds
- Clear timelines for release to prevent customs from becoming an instrument of collective punishment

### Currency: Multi-Currency Environment Without Monetary Sovereignty

The framework explicitly **avoids introducing a new sovereign currency** in early phases.

**Approach:**

- Formalize a **multi-currency environment** using existing currencies already in circulation (shekel, dollar, dinar)
- Prohibit arbitrary restrictions on their use within the corridor economy
- Support a **corridor-based digital settlement layer** that operates as a clearing mechanism rather than a currency
- Enable wages, fees, and trade payments to be settled transparently without requiring monetary sovereignty or central banking authority

### Banking and Financial Access: Preventing Exclusion

Banking and financial access are among the most sensitive friction points and require particular care.

**Corridor-licensed financial services framework:**

- Vetted domestic and international banks, credit unions, and fintech providers may operate within the system under a unified compliance regime
- Anti–money laundering and counterterrorism financing standards strict enough to maintain international access but **standardized to prevent selective enforcement** as a political weapon
- Account access tied to **individual and business compliance**, not collective identity or territory-wide risk classification

**Baseline financial access mandate:**

- Transaction accounts, wage receipt, and savings mechanisms guaranteed for participants
- De-risking practices that lead to blanket account closures **explicitly prohibited** within the corridor regime

Without reliable banking, work permits and trade access collapse into cash economies that are both exploitative and opaque.

### Economic Development: Densification Over Grand Reconstruction

MCF avoids grand reconstruction promises in early phases and instead focuses on **economic densification**:

- Enabling small- and medium-scale enterprise formation
- Supply chain repair and labor specialization within and across corridors
- Priority sectors with low capital barriers and high employment multipliers: logistics, light manufacturing, repair services, food processing, digital services
- Development incentives **rules-based and automatic** rather than discretionary grants, minimizing patronage and political capture

**Infrastructure investment:**

- Corridor-linked and civilian-facing, not territory-wide or symbolic
- Power reliability, data connectivity, cold-chain logistics, and water access inside corridors yield immediate productivity gains without entangling sovereignty claims
- External donors required to channel development funding through the corridor economic framework rather than parallel systems

### Non-Extractiveness: Reinvestment Over Rent-Seeking

A critical cross-cutting principle is **non-extractiveness**.

**Requirements:**

- Corridor fees, tariffs, and service charges transparently capped and directly reinvested into corridor operations and civilian services
- Fee schedules public, audited, and linked to service delivery metrics
- If MCF becomes a revenue extraction mechanism rather than a value-creation system, it will replicate the dynamics it claims to replace

### Asymmetric but Convergent Design

The economic architecture must be **asymmetric but convergent**:

- Gaza and the West Bank may require different initial trade mixes, customs throughput, and banking risk profiles
- Long-term structure allows economic rules to **converge rather than diverge permanently**
- Preserves optionality for future political arrangements without freezing economic fragmentation into the system's design

### The Core Principle: Functional Economic Shell

MCF's economic layer is a **functional economic shell**: it enables trade, finance, and development to occur predictably under constraint, without pretending to resolve sovereignty or final-status questions.

Success is measured not by growth statistics alone, but by:

- Reduced arbitrariness
- Lower transaction costs
- Gradual replacement of informal power with legible civilian economic life

---

## Regional Integration: Civilian Stabilization Substrate

MCF should be designed to **interact with regional initiatives without being subsumed by them**, and without requiring their success as a precondition.

The Framework must remain viable whether or not the broader regional environment cooperates, and must avoid becoming a hostage to external political alignments it cannot control.

### Abraham Accords: Orthogonal, Not Dependent

The Abraham Accords represent a significant shift in regional diplomacy, but MCF should treat them as **orthogonal rather than foundational**.

**Design principles:**

- MCF does not require Abraham Accords participation by any party for its institutions to function
- The Framework should not be framed as an extension of normalization, nor should it be presented as an obstacle to it
- Countries participating in the Accords (UAE, Bahrain, Morocco) may engage with MCF institutions (as SAZ hosts, guarantor contributors, or economic partners) without conflating the two processes
- MCF does not take a position on whether normalization is desirable, premature, or conditional—it simply avoids structural dependency on its continuation

**Rationale:** Tying MCF's viability to normalization politics would make it vulnerable to backlash from Palestinian constituencies who reject normalization as illegitimate, and to volatility if Accords relationships shift under changing administrations or regional crises.

### Arab Peace Initiative: Neutrality Without Rejection

The Arab Peace Initiative (API) remains the most comprehensive multilateral Arab proposal for ending the conflict, and its framing (withdrawal, refugee resolution, normalization) has shaped diplomatic expectations for two decades.

MCF adopts an **API-neutral stance**:

- It neither endorses nor rejects the API as a framework for final-status resolution
- Its institutions are designed to be **compatible with an eventual API-based settlement** if parties pursue one, but do not presuppose that outcome
- MCF does not treat the API as the only legitimate Arab voice on the conflict, nor does it privilege alternative frameworks

**Rationale:** Explicit alignment with or rejection of API would politicize MCF's institutional architecture unnecessarily and invite contestation over whether the Framework is a substitute for, a path toward, or an obstacle to API principles.

### Regional Economic Interface: Plug-In Platform

MCF's economic architecture (corridors, customs, banking access) should be designed as a **plug-in platform for regional economic integration** rather than a closed loop.

**Structural features:**

- Trade corridors can extend to link with Jordanian logistics networks, Egyptian industrial zones, and Gulf investment pipelines—but MCF does not require these linkages to function
- Customs harmonization is designed to be **interoperable with existing regional trade agreements** (e.g., GAFTA, bilateral FTAs) without demanding membership
- The corridor banking regime is structured to **interface with regional financial systems** (Jordanian dinars, Egyptian pounds, Gulf-based correspondent banks) on a bilateral or multilateral basis as relationships evolve

**Rationale:** Economic viability should not be held hostage to grand regional integration schemes. MCF builds the platform; regional actors choose whether to plug in.

### Non-Exclusivity Posture

MCF explicitly rejects any claim to being the **sole legitimate framework** for conflict management or resolution in the region.

**Coexistence with other tracks:**

- If parallel diplomatic efforts (e.g., Track II negotiations, UN-led processes, bilateral Israeli-Palestinian talks) advance, MCF is designed to **stand down, merge, or hand off functions** rather than compete
- MCF institutions may operate alongside other stabilization mechanisms without requiring primacy
- The Framework does not claim to be the only path forward; it claims to be **one viable path forward** that does not require others to fail

**Rationale:** Asserting exclusivity would invite opposition from actors invested in alternative approaches and would politicize MCF's institutional legitimacy unnecessarily.

### The Core Principle: Civilian Stabilization Substrate

MCF positions itself as a **civilian stabilization substrate beneath regional politics**, not as a competitor to regional diplomatic initiatives or a vehicle for any particular alignment.

Its success does not depend on:

- Abraham Accords expansion or collapse
- Arab Peace Initiative revival or abandonment
- Any particular regional power configuration

It depends only on:

- Sustained operational functionality
- Credible verification
- Gradual institutional trust-building among affected populations

Regional integration is welcome but not required. MCF builds the floor; others may choose to build on top of it.

---

## International Law Compatibility: Parallel Compliance Without Adjudication

The Managed Coexistence Framework (MCF) is designed to be **legally compatible but not legally dispositive** with respect to existing international law. It neither replaces nor adjudicates obligations arising from **United Nations resolutions**, **International Court of Justice advisory opinions**, or the **Geneva Conventions**.

MCF adopts a doctrine of **parallel compliance with explicit non-prejudice**: participation in the Framework does not constitute acceptance, rejection, or modification of any party's legal positions under international law. This is essential to prevent legal disagreement from becoming a veto on operational conflict management.

### Operating Alongside International Law

In practical terms, MCF operates **alongside** international law rather than above or in defiance of it.

Its verification bodies (UVB/JSVC) document facts, procedures, and compliance with deconfliction standards, but they do **not**:

- Issue legal findings
- Determine state responsibility
- Interpret treaty law

This separation is intentional. By avoiding legal adjudication, MCF prevents its institutions from becoming battlegrounds over the applicability or meaning of UN resolutions, ICJ opinions, or occupation law—disputes that have historically paralyzed multilateral mechanisms.

At the same time, MCF does not shield any actor from international law. Its factual records are explicitly designed to be **usable by external legal bodies** should states or courts choose to rely on them.

### Humanitarian Law Compatibility

With respect to humanitarian law, MCF assumes that **Geneva Convention obligations continue to apply independently of the Framework**, regardless of whether parties agree on their interpretation.

PCC protections, civilian infrastructure safeguards, and anti-intimidation mechanisms are deliberately framed to be **at least as restrictive as minimum humanitarian norms**, without claiming to define those norms.

This allows MCF to reinforce humanitarian behavior in practice while remaining neutral on contested legal classifications such as:

- Occupation status
- Proportionality assessments
- Lawful targets

**Critical principle:** Compliance with MCF procedures does not substitute for compliance with international humanitarian law, nor does non-participation excuse violations.

### Non-Normalization and Non-Waiver

MCF explicitly rejects the idea that engagement in the Framework constitutes **legal normalization or waiver**.

The charter language must state that no action taken under MCF—whether participation in corridors, CMS enrollment, or SAZ administration—shall be interpreted as:

- Consent to territorial claims
- Acceptance of annexation
- Sovereignty determinations
- Acknowledgment of the permanent legality of existing arrangements

This protects Palestinians from claims that cooperation extinguishes legal rights, and protects Israel from claims that procedural participation constitutes admission of illegality.

In this sense, MCF functions as a **conflict-management layer beneath unresolved legal disputes**, not a mechanism for settling them.

### The Core Principle: Governance Under Legal Disagreement

MCF is neither a substitute for international law nor an alternative legal order. It is a **governance framework that assumes legal disagreement will persist** and designs around it.

By separating:

- Factual verification from legal judgment
- Operational restraint from legal resolution
- Participation from recognition

MCF remains compatible with existing international legal instruments while refusing to let their contested interpretation prevent harm reduction and institutional stabilization in the present.

---

## Amendment and Evolution: Layered Change Without Capture

The Managed Coexistence Framework (MCF) is explicitly designed to be **evolvable without being easily capturable**, and its amendment logic is treated as a core governance problem rather than an afterthought. The framework assumes that conditions, actors, and political constraints will change over decades, and that rigidity would be as dangerous as instability.

MCF separates **what can change easily**, **what can change conditionally**, and **what can only change under heightened consensus**, rather than relying on a single amendment rule.

### Operational Level: Routine Adaptation

**Procedural and technical elements** are designed to be updated routinely:

- Monitoring technologies
- Reporting formats
- Audit cycles
- Staffing structures
- Corridor management protocols

These changes are proposed by the institutional continuity body (the treaty-chartered authority that preserves records and standards), reviewed by verification guarantors, and adopted on fixed review cycles unless formally objected to.

This allows MCF to adapt to new technologies, tactics (e.g., cyber or information warfare), and humanitarian realities without reopening political questions or requiring high-level renegotiation.

### Structural Level: Qualified Multi-Layer Approval

**Functional scope and phase mechanics** are amendable only through qualified, multi-layer approval:

- Eligibility criteria for Civic Membership Status
- The menu of PCC functions
- Thresholds for phase advancement and rollback

Proposals may originate from multiple sources: guarantors, participating parties, host states, or the institutional body itself. Adoption requires concurrence across distinct categories:

- At least one security-leverage guarantor
- At least one verification guarantor
- No formal objection from participating parties within defined notice periods

This prevents unilateral drift while allowing deliberate recalibration as conditions improve or deteriorate.

### Constitutional Level: Protected Core Principles

**Core principles** are intentionally hard to amend:

- Non-prejudice to sovereignty claims
- Individual-first participation
- Separation of verification from enforcement
- Reversibility of phases
- Exclusion of early final-status adjudication

Changes to these elements require heightened thresholds, extended review periods, and often explicit re-ratification by guarantors and participating parties.

This guards against mission creep, politicization, or quiet transformation of MCF into a de facto settlement mechanism without consent.

### Mandatory Periodic Review

To prevent stagnation, MCF embeds **mandatory periodic review moments** that force reassessment without forcing change.

Every phase includes sunset reviews at which continuation must be affirmatively certified, even if no amendment is proposed. Required inputs to these reviews include:

- Independent "lessons learned" reports
- Red-team critiques
- External audits

This ensures that the framework cannot persist unchanged simply because altering it is difficult. Inertia is treated as a risk to be managed, not a default virtue.

### Experimental Adaptation

MCF explicitly normalizes **experimental adaptation** through pilots and optional modules.

New mechanisms can be tested in bounded settings without being universalized:

- Limited corridors
- External SAZ functions
- Time-limited eligibility expansions

Successful pilots can be codified; failed ones expire without destabilizing the whole system. This allows evolution through evidence rather than ideology.

### The Core Principle: Procedural, Reversible, Survivable Change

MCF avoids rigidity by:

- **Layering amendment authority** across operational, structural, and constitutional levels
- **Forcing periodic reconsideration** through mandatory sunset reviews
- **Making change incremental rather than existential** through pilots and modules

The framework is neither frozen nor fluid by default. It changes the same way it manages conflict: procedurally, reversibly, and with bias toward survival over elegance.

---

## Exit Conditions: Success Without a Single End State

The Managed Coexistence Framework (MCF) is **deliberately agnostic about a single end state**, because insisting on one would recreate the same veto dynamics that have repeatedly collapsed prior peace efforts.

"Success" in MCF is defined **functionally, not ideologically**. The framework does not measure success by whether a particular political outcome (two states, one state, confederation) is achieved, but by whether:

- Violence is durably reduced
- Institutions remain stable under stress
- Political options remain open rather than foreclosed

Success is not the resolution of conflict, but the creation of conditions under which resolution becomes possible without coercion.

### Multiple Legitimate Success Pathways

MCF recognizes **multiple legitimate success pathways**, each of which can trigger transformation or wind-down:

#### Graduated Convergence

Sustained stability, trusted institutions, and voluntary participation lead populations to repeatedly choose deeper integration through referenda or negotiated political arrangements.

In this scenario, MCF does not abruptly end; it is **absorbed into successor governance structures** (e.g., a confederation or federation), with its verification and rights mechanisms either constitutionalized or retired as redundant.

#### Stable Separation

Coexistence mechanisms function well enough that parties opt to maintain political separation while relying permanently on shared conflict-management infrastructure.

Here, MCF does not "fail" by persisting; it **succeeds by preventing deterioration** and making separation non-violent and governable.

#### Managed Handoff to Negotiated Settlement

If at any point a comprehensive political agreement is reached outside the framework, MCF is designed to **stand down in stages**, transferring functions to the agreed institutions while preserving records, certifications, and continuity.

MCF does not claim ownership over peace; it is explicitly subordinate to any consensual political settlement. Wind-down in this case is procedural and audited, not symbolic or celebratory, to avoid destabilizing expectations.

#### Long-Term Managed Coexistence

MCF anticipates the possibility that **managed coexistence becomes the long-term condition**. This is not treated as failure.

In conflicts with deep asymmetry, identity entrenchment, and regional interference, indefinite conflict management may be the most humane and realistic outcome available. Success is measured by:

- Sustained civilian safety
- Predictable access to resources
- Declining escalation frequency
- Normalization of non-violent civic participation across generations

Permanence here is not stagnation; the framework continues to evolve, shrink, or expand functionally as conditions warrant.

### Exit Is Always Deliberate

**MCF never ends by collapse.** Exit is always **deliberate and certified**, not forced by exhaustion or sabotage.

Even rollback is treated as a temporary contraction, not an existential failure. The framework winds down only when it is no longer needed—or transforms when populations voluntarily choose something stronger.

Until then, managed coexistence is not a holding pattern; it is the success condition itself.

### The Core Principle: Plural Success

MCF's answer to "what does success look like?" is intentionally plural:

- **Peace, if possible**
- **Stability, if not**
- **Always the preservation of choice**

The framework ends not when conflict disappears, but when managing it is no longer necessary—or no longer desired by those living within it.

---

## Conclusion

The Managed Coexistence Framework is designed for conditions where power is unequal, trust is absent, and political resolution is not immediately achievable.

It begins with containment, verification, and procedural restraint. It preserves Israeli sovereignty, Palestinian political options, and individual safety without demanding premature agreement.

MCF does not promise peace. It builds the conditions under which peace remains possible—and prevents futures that are demonstrably worse.
