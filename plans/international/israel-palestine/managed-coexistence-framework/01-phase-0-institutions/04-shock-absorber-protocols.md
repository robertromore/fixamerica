# Shock-Absorber Protocols

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#phase-0-years-05-hardened-confederal-security-layer)

**Phase:** Phase 0 onwards

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## Purpose

Shock-Absorber Protocols are **pre-negotiated response ladders to violent incidents** designed to prevent emotional or unilateral escalation. They replace ad hoc political reactions with automatic, proportionate, and bounded responses.

The protocols exist because **escalation spirals are predictable**. When violence occurs, political pressure demands immediate, visible response. Without pre-defined constraints, each response risks provoking counter-response, creating cycles that exceed the original incident's severity. Shock-absorbers interrupt this cycle by making responses automatic, proportionate, time-limited, and subject to independent review.

---

## Core Principle: Procedural De-escalation

Shock-absorbers work by **removing discretion at moments of maximum emotional pressure**:

- Responses are defined before incidents occur
- Implementation follows protocol, not political calculation
- Duration is fixed, not extended by political demand
- Review is independent, not controlled by affected parties

This does not mean responses are weak—it means they are **predictable and bounded**, which is precisely what prevents spirals.

---

## 1. Protocol Philosophy

### 1.1 Why Automatic Responses Reduce Escalation

**The Escalation Dynamic**

After violent incidents, political leaders face pressure to:

- Demonstrate strength
- Satisfy domestic anger
- Deter future attacks
- Avoid appearing weak

This pressure pushes toward responses that exceed proportionality, which in turn triggers counter-pressure on the other side, creating escalation spirals.

**How Shock-Absorbers Intervene**

Shock-absorbers interrupt this dynamic by:

| Pressure | Shock-Absorber Response |
|----------|------------------------|
| "We must respond strongly" | "We are responding per protocol—the response is automatic and proportionate" |
| "We should do more" | "Protocol caps prevent over-response; this protects us from counter-escalation" |
| "The response is too weak" | "This response has been pre-negotiated as adequate; changing it undermines credibility" |
| "We must act immediately" | "Immediate action is happening; protocol ensures it's the right action" |

**Credibility Through Constraint**

Counter-intuitively, **constraints increase credibility**:

- Because responses are automatic, the other side knows they will happen
- Because responses are bounded, the other side knows they will end
- Because responses are reviewed, false attribution is detected
- Because protocols are published, manipulation is visible

### 1.2 Relationship to Procedural Trust

Shock-absorbers are a **trust substitute**, not a trust requirement:

- They do not require parties to trust each other's intentions
- They require only that parties recognize the protocol reduces mutual harm
- Over time, successful protocol operation may build trust
- But protocol function does not depend on trust

### 1.3 Limitations of Shock-Absorbers

Shock-absorbers are **incident management tools**, not conflict resolution:

- They do not address root causes
- They do not prevent all violence
- They do not substitute for political progress
- They only interrupt escalation spirals

**What Shock-Absorbers Cannot Do:**

- Prevent determined attacks by spoilers
- Stop incidents from occurring
- Satisfy demands for "decisive" action
- Substitute for long-term conflict resolution

**What Shock-Absorbers Can Do:**

- Prevent incidents from spiraling into wider conflict
- Maintain framework continuity through violent periods
- Demonstrate that alternatives to escalation exist
- Create space for investigation and attribution

## 2. Incident Classification

### 2.1 Classification Authority

**Primary Classification**

- UVB/JSVC classifies incidents based on verified information
- Classification occurs within 24 hours of incident report
- Preliminary classification triggers protocol; final classification may adjust

**Disputed Classification**

- Either party may dispute classification
- Dispute does not delay protocol activation
- Review occurs in parallel with protocol implementation
- Reclassification adjusts remaining protocol duration

### 2.2 Severity Tiers

| Tier | Definition | Examples |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Tier 1: Minor** | Property damage, threats, non-lethal violence with minor injury | Vandalism, intimidation, scuffles without hospitalization |
| **Tier 2: Moderate** | Injuries requiring medical treatment, significant property destruction | Stabbings with recovery, arson, vehicular attacks without fatalities |
| **Tier 3: Serious** | Fatalities (1-5), mass injury, critical infrastructure damage | Shootings, bombings with limited casualties, infrastructure sabotage |
| **Tier 4: Major** | Mass casualties (6+), coordinated attacks, existential infrastructure threats | Mass shootings, major bombings, coordinated multi-site attacks |

### 2.3 Classification Criteria

**Factors Considered:**

- Casualties (deaths, serious injuries, minor injuries)
- Property damage (value, criticality, replaceability)
- Infrastructure impact (scope, duration, affected population)
- Coordination evidence (single actor vs. organized attack)
- Target type (civilian, military, infrastructure, MCF institution)
- Location (within MCF domains, outside MCF domains, border areas)

**Classification Matrix:**

| Factor | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 | Tier 4 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Deaths | 0 | 0 | 1-5 | 6+ |
| Serious injuries | 0-2 | 3-10 | 11-50 | 50+ |
| Infrastructure | Cosmetic | Functional damage | Critical disruption | Catastrophic |
| Coordination | None evident | Possible | Confirmed | Multi-actor |

### 2.4 Attribution Requirements

**For Protocol Activation:**

- Protocols activate based on incident classification, **not attribution**
- Attribution is not required for protocol implementation
- Protocols are symmetric—they apply regardless of who is responsible

**For Protocol Modification:**

- Attribution may affect protocol duration or scope
- Confirmed external (spoiler) attribution may reduce protocol intensity
- Confirmed MCF-participant attribution may extend protocol duration

**Attribution Standards:**

- Preliminary attribution: reasonable basis (within 72 hours)
- Confirmed attribution: preponderance of evidence (within 30 days)
- Final attribution: clear and convincing evidence (within 90 days)

## 4. Proportionality Constraints

### 4.1 Maximum Response Caps

**The Cap Principle:**
No protocol response may exceed defined maximums, regardless of incident severity or political pressure.

| Measure | Absolute Maximum |
|---------|------------------|
| PCC closure | 7 days (medical PCCs: 0 days) |
| Movement restriction | 30 days |
| Employment pause | 30 days |
| CMS processing pause | 30 days |
| Enhanced verification | 60 days |

**Rationale:**
Caps exist because unlimited responses enable collective punishment, undermine framework credibility, and provide spoilers with disproportionate impact from single attacks.

### 4.2 Civilian Protection Requirements

**Non-Targeting Principle:**
Protocol responses may not target individuals or communities based on identity rather than conduct.

**Prohibited Responses:**

- Collective punishment of communities
- Identity-based movement restrictions
- Blanket CMS revocations
- Community-wide benefit suspensions

**Required Protections:**

- Individual review before any status change
- Alternative access for essential services
- Documentation of restriction impact
- Remedy procedures for wrongful restriction

### 4.3 PCC Impact Limitations

**Essential Services Protection:**

| PCC Type | Maximum Restriction |
|----------|---------------------|
| Medical | No closure; throughput reduction only (max 25%) |
| Water | No closure; throughput reduction only (max 50%) |
| Electricity | No deliberate restriction (security measures only) |
| General goods | Closure permitted per tier limits |

**Restoration Priority:**
PCC restoration follows reverse severity—medical first, then water, then electricity, then general goods.

### 4.4 CMS Holder Protections

**Individual Rights During Protocols:**

- CMS status may not be suspended based solely on incident location
- CMS holders retain grievance access during restrictions
- Employment protections continue during program pauses
- No adverse annotation for protocol-related restrictions

**CMS Holder Obligations During Protocols:**

- Compliance with movement restrictions
- Cooperation with enhanced verification
- Reporting of relevant information
- Patience with service disruptions

## 5. Duration and Restoration

### 5.1 Default Durations

| Tier | Default Duration | Extension Possible |
|------|------------------|-------------------|
| Tier 1 | 72 hours | Up to 7 days |
| Tier 2 | 7 days | Up to 14 days |
| Tier 3 | 14 days | Up to 30 days |
| Tier 4 | 30 days | Up to 60 days (guarantor approval) |

### 5.2 Extension Criteria

Extensions require:

- Documented continuing threat
- Review of initial response effectiveness
- Assessment of extension impact
- Guarantor notification (Tier 2+) or approval (Tier 3+)

Extensions may not exceed:

- Original duration (Tier 1-2)
- Double original duration (Tier 3-4)
- Absolute maximums (Section 4.1)

### 5.3 Restoration Triggers

**Automatic Restoration:**

- Duration expires without extension
- Attribution shows external (non-party) actor
- Investigation shows incident was accidental/unintentional
- Party takes verified corrective action

**Accelerated Restoration:**

- Perpetrator identified and detained
- Party demonstrates enhanced prevention measures
- No related incidents during restriction period
- Community cooperation in investigation

### 5.4 Automatic De-escalation

**De-escalation Schedule:**

| Day | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Duration - 3 | Review initiated |
| Duration - 1 | Restoration plan confirmed |
| Duration | Restrictions lift unless extended |
| Duration + 1 | Monitoring continues at reduced level |
| Duration + 7 | Return to baseline |

**De-escalation Sequence:**

1. Movement restrictions lift first
2. Employment programs resume
3. PCC throughput returns to normal
4. Enhanced monitoring reduces
5. Return to baseline operations

---

## 6. Review and Accountability

### 6.1 JSVC Review Procedures

**Incident Review (All Tiers):**

- Initial classification review (24 hours)
- Mid-period review (halfway through duration)
- End-period review (before restoration)
- Lessons-learned review (30 days post-restoration)

**Review Content:**

- Was classification appropriate?
- Were responses proportionate?
- Were caps respected?
- Were protections maintained?
- What improvements are needed?

### 6.2 Post-Incident Analysis

**Mandatory Analysis (Tier 3-4):**

- Comprehensive incident reconstruction
- Attribution analysis
- Response effectiveness assessment
- Community impact assessment
- Protocol improvement recommendations

**Analysis Publication:**

- Summary published within 60 days
- Full report to guarantors
- Recommendations to protocol revision process

### 6.3 Protocol Refinement

**Annual Protocol Review:**

- Analysis of all incidents and responses
- Assessment of cap adequacy
- Community feedback integration
- Guarantor input
- Protocol updates as needed

**Emergency Protocol Amendment:**

- Triggered by demonstrated protocol failure
- Requires guarantor approval
- Published with explanation
- Subject to next annual review

### 6.4 Abuse Investigation

**Abuse Types:**

- False incident reporting to trigger protocols
- Exaggerated classification to increase restrictions
- Protocol manipulation for political purposes
- Selective enforcement

**Investigation Triggers:**

- Pattern of disputed classifications
- Party complaint of abuse
- Statistical anomalies
- Whistleblower reports

**Investigation Process:**

- Independent investigation team
- Access to all relevant records
- Party cooperation required
- Findings published
- Corrective action required

**Consequences of Confirmed Abuse:**

- Personnel accountability
- Protocol modification
- Guarantor notification
- Public documentation

## 7. Relationship to Phase Regression

### 7.1 When Incidents Trigger Regression

Shock-absorber protocols are **not** phase regression. They are temporary responses within a phase.

**Phase regression may be triggered when:**

- Tier 4 incidents occur repeatedly (3+ in 12 months)
- Protocol responses prove ineffective
- Framework viability is threatened
- Guarantors assess that phase conditions no longer hold

See: [Phase Regression Triggers](../08-operational-procedures/03-phase-regression.md)

### 7.2 Shock-Absorber vs. Structural Change

| Shock-Absorber | Phase Regression |
|----------------|------------------|
| Temporary | Semi-permanent |
| Automatic restoration | Requires re-qualification |
| Within-phase adjustment | Between-phase transition |
| Protocol-driven | Criteria-driven |
| Incident-specific | Pattern-based |

### 7.3 Recovery Pathways

**After Protocol Restoration:**

- Monitoring returns to baseline
- Programs resume normal operation
- Incident is documented for pattern analysis
- Framework continues at current phase

**After Phase Regression:**

- Different (reduced) protocol set applies
- Recovery requires meeting phase advancement criteria
- Longer timeline for restoration
- Structural changes may be required

---

## 8. Communication

### 8.1 Protocol Activation Communication

**Internal Communication:**

- All MCF institutions notified immediately
- Party liaisons notified per timeline
- Guarantors notified per tier requirements

**Public Communication:**

- Protocol activation announced within 24 hours
- Restrictions clearly communicated
- Duration and restoration criteria published
- Updates provided at key milestones

### 8.2 Communication Principles

- **Factual:** Report what happened and what responses are activated
- **Neutral:** Avoid inflammatory language or blame before attribution
- **Practical:** Focus on what people need to know and do
- **Consistent:** Same message to all audiences
