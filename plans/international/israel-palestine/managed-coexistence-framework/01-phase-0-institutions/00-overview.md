# Phase 0 Institutions: Overview

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#phase-0-years-05-hardened-confederal-security-layer)

**Phase Duration:** Years 0-5

**Objective:** Prevent escalation spirals and establish reliable, shared procedures for managing incidents.

## Purpose of This Section

This directory contains detailed implementation documents for the institutions and mechanisms established during Phase 0 of the Managed Coexistence Framework. Phase 0 creates the **hardened confederal security layer**—the foundation upon which all subsequent phases build.

Phase 0 is deliberately limited in scope: it does not attempt political integration, territorial change, or identity transformation. It focuses exclusively on **procedural stability and incident management**.

## Key Institutions

| Institution | Document | Purpose |
|-------------|----------|---------|
| Unilateral Verification Body (UVB) | [01-uvb-charter.md](01-uvb-charter.md) | Initial verification mechanism before JSVC |
| Joint Security Verification Commission (JSVC) | [02-jsvc-charter.md](02-jsvc-charter.md) | Permanent verification and deconfliction body |
| Protected Civic Corridors (PCCs) | [03-pcc-protocols.md](03-pcc-protocols.md) | Narrow, single-purpose shared infrastructure systems |
| Shock-Absorber Protocols | [04-shock-absorber-protocols.md](04-shock-absorber-protocols.md) | Pre-negotiated response ladders to violent incidents |

---

## Success Criteria (from Introduction)

- Reduced escalation frequency
- Improved incident attribution credibility
- Infrastructure reliability under stress

---

## Transition to Phase 1

Phase 0 institutions remain operational throughout all subsequent phases. The transition to Phase 1 occurs when Phase 0 success criteria are met and verified by external guarantors.
