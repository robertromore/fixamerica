# Protected Civic Corridors (PCCs) Protocols

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#protected-civic-corridors-pccs)

**Phase:** Phase 0 onwards

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## Purpose

Protected Civic Corridors (PCCs) are **narrow, single-purpose shared infrastructure systems** designed to deliver tangible civilian benefits while minimizing political exposure and security risk. They represent the physical and operational layer of MCF—the infrastructure through which framework benefits actually flow.

PCCs exist because **infrastructure reliability is a civilian interest that transcends political conflict**. When water stops flowing or medical supplies cannot move, civilians suffer regardless of which side they support. PCCs create protected channels for essential services that both sides have material interest in preserving, even during conflict.

---

## Core Principle: Function-Based Protection

PCCs are **function-based**, not territorial or population-based:

- PCC designation applies to **facilities and conduits**, not communities or areas
- Protection follows the **function**, not the user's identity
- PCCs serve whoever uses the infrastructure, without implying political recognition
- PCC operations do not adjudicate sovereignty, allocation rights, or territorial claims

This principle ensures that PCCs can operate without requiring resolution of political disputes.

---

## 1. PCC Definition and Scope

### 1.1 What Qualifies as a PCC

**Eligibility Criteria**

A facility, conduit, or system may be designated as a PCC if it meets ALL of the following criteria:

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Essential civilian function** | Provides services critical to civilian life (utilities, medical, food security) |
| **Cross-boundary relevance** | Serves populations across community boundaries or conflict lines |
| **Operational viability** | Can be protected and monitored without requiring territorial control |
| **Political neutrality** | Operation does not inherently advantage one party's political claims |
| **Harm reduction potential** | Protection demonstrably reduces civilian harm during conflict |

**What Does NOT Qualify**

| Exclusion | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Military facilities** | Not civilian function |
| **Settlement infrastructure** | Would normalize disputed territorial claims |
| **Political institutions** | Would imply recognition |
| **Commercial facilities** | Not essential services (until Phase 1+) |
| **Religious sites** | Require separate sensitive-site protocols |

### 1.2 PCC Designation Process

**Proposal Sources**

| Source | Pathway |
|--------|---------|
| **JSVC** | Direct recommendation based on operational assessment |
| **Guarantors** | Proposal through guarantor coordination mechanism |
| **Parties** | Request through liaison (unilateral request sufficient for assessment) |
| **International organizations** | Recommendation through JSVC liaison |

**Assessment Process**

| Step | Timeline | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| Proposal received | Day 0 | Initial screening |
| Eligibility assessment | Days 1-14 | Verify criteria compliance |
| Operational + Security assessment | Days 7-45 | Evaluate protection feasibility and risk profile (concurrent) |
| Stakeholder consultation | Days 30-55 | Parties, guarantors, affected populations (overlaps with assessments) |
| Designation decision | Day 60 maximum | JSVC recommendation, guarantor approval |

**Note:** Assessments run concurrently, not sequentially. Total timeline is 60 days maximum from proposal to decision.

**Designation Requirements**

- JSVC affirmative recommendation
- Guarantor supermajority approval (2/3 of guarantors; no single-guarantor veto)
- Party notification (consent not required)
- Operational plan approved
- Monitoring system in place

### 1.3 PCC Characteristics

**Narrow Scope**

Each PCC has a **single, defined function**:

| PCC Type | Function | NOT Included |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| **Water PCC** | Water supply and distribution | Water allocation decisions |
| **Electricity PCC** | Power transmission and distribution | Pricing or quota decisions |
| **Medical Transfer PCC** | Patient and supply movement | Healthcare policy |
| **Medical Facility PCC** | Hospital/clinic operations | Staffing or admission policy |

**Operational Boundaries**

| Boundary | Specification |
|----------|--------------|
| **Geographic** | Defined facility footprint or conduit route |
| **Functional** | Only designated function protected |
| **Temporal** | Continuous unless suspended per protocol |
| **Personnel** | Designated operators and authorized visitors |

### 1.4 Relationship to Existing Infrastructure

**Overlay Model**

PCCs operate as an **overlay** on existing infrastructure:

| Aspect | Existing Infrastructure | PCC Overlay |
|--------|-------------------------|-------------|
| **Ownership** | Unchanged | N/A |
| **Operations** | Unchanged or coordinated | Monitoring and protection |
| **Maintenance** | Existing operator | Existing operator with monitoring |
| **Expansion** | Normal processes | May require PCC expansion |

**Non-Displacement Principle**

PCC designation does NOT:

- Transfer ownership
- Change operational authority
- Alter legal status
- Imply recognition of claims
- Create precedent for future arrangements

## 5. Suspension and Restoration

### 5.1 Integration with Shock-Absorber Protocols

**Relationship to Incident Classification**

PCC suspension is governed by [Shock-Absorber Protocols](04-shock-absorber-protocols.md):

| Incident Tier | PCC Impact | Duration Limit |
|---------------|------------|----------------|
| **Tier 1** | No suspension; enhanced monitoring only | N/A |
| **Tier 2** | Throughput reduction permitted (up to 25%) | 7 days |
| **Tier 3** | Throughput reduction (up to 50%); temporary suspension possible | 72 hours suspension max |
| **Tier 4** | Extended restrictions; guarantor authorization for suspension >72 hours | 7 days max (medical: no closure) |

*Note: Duration limits shown are standard maximums before extension. See [Section 5.5](#55-time-limits-and-caps) for extension requirements and absolute caps (14 days standard, 30 days maximum with escalating approval).*

**Medical PCC Absolute Protection**

Medical PCCs are **never subject to full closure**, even during security incidents:

| Medical PCC Type | Maximum Restriction | During Attack/Emergency |
|------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Patient transfer** | Throughput reduction up to 50%; never closed | Secure alternate route; never closed |
| **Medical supply** | Throughput reduction up to 25%; never closed | Reroute if needed; never closed |
| **Medical facility** | No operational restriction; security enhancement only | Perimeter security; never closed |

**Medical PCC Override Rule:** Automatic suspension triggers (Section 5.2) apply to medical PCCs as **segment restrictions only**, never full closure. If an attack renders one medical PCC segment inoperable, an alternate route or facility must be activated within 4 hours. Medical access is a non-derogable protection.

### 5.2 Automatic Suspension Triggers

**Triggers Requiring Suspension**

| Trigger | Response | Duration | Medical PCC Exception |
|---------|----------|----------|----------------------|
| **Direct attack on PCC** | Immediate suspension of affected segment | Until secure (max 72 hours without extension) | Segment restriction + alternate activation |
| **Credible imminent attack threat** | Precautionary suspension | Until threat cleared (max 48 hours without extension) | Enhanced security only; no closure |
| **Technical failure making operation unsafe** | Technical suspension | Until repaired (max 72 hours without extension) | Alternate activation required |
| **Discovery of weaponization** | Immediate suspension + investigation | Until cleared (max 7 days without extension) | Segment restriction + alternate activation |

**Triggers NOT Requiring Suspension**

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **Political tension** | Enhanced monitoring; no suspension |
| **Incident elsewhere** | Per shock-absorber protocols; PCC continues unless directly affected |
| **Party request for closure** | Documented; no automatic compliance |
| **General security alert** | Enhanced security; no suspension |

### 5.3 Suspension Procedures

**Suspension Decision Authority**

| Suspension Type | Authority | Approval Required |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Technical** (safety) | PCC Directorate | Immediate, JSVC notification |
| **Security** (threat) | Emergency Response Cell | JSVC concurrence |
| **Protocol** (shock-absorber) | JSVC | Per shock-absorber protocols |
| **Extended** (>72 hours) | JSVC | Guarantor approval |

**Suspension Process**

| Step | Timeline | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| Trigger identified | T=0 | Initial assessment |
| Decision | T+1 hour max | Suspend or continue |
| Notification | T+2 hours | Parties, guarantors, affected populations |
| Implementation | T+4 hours | Suspension in effect |
| Review scheduled | T+24 hours | Mandatory first review |

**Suspension Documentation**

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Trigger** | Specific cause documented |
| **Scope** | Exactly what is suspended |
| **Duration** | Expected timeline |
| **Restoration criteria** | What must happen to restore |
| **Review schedule** | When reviews will occur |

### 5.4 Restoration Criteria

**Automatic Restoration Triggers**

| Trigger | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **Duration expires** | Automatic restoration unless extended |
| **Threat cleared** | Restoration within 24 hours |
| **Technical repair complete** | Restoration upon verification |
| **Shock-absorber de-escalation** | Restoration per de-escalation schedule |

**Restoration Process**

| Step | Timeline | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| Restoration trigger | T=0 | Criteria met |
| Verification | T+6 hours | Confirm safe to restore |
| Preparation | T+12 hours | Operational readiness |
| Restoration | T+24 hours max | PCC operations resume |
| Monitoring | T+24 hours+ | Enhanced monitoring post-restoration |

**Partial Restoration**

When full restoration is not possible:

| Scenario | Partial Restoration |
|----------|---------------------|
| **Segment damage** | Restore undamaged segments; repair ongoing |
| **Continuing threat to portion** | Restore safe portions; enhanced security on remainder |
| **Capacity limitation** | Restore at reduced capacity; expand as possible |

### 5.5 Time Limits and Caps

**Standard Maximums (Without Extension)**

| PCC Type | Maximum Suspension Without Extension |
|----------|-------------------------------------|
| **Medical PCCs** | NO full closure permitted (segment restrictions only) |
| **Water PCCs** | 72 hours (throughput reduction only beyond 24 hours) |
| **Electricity PCCs** | 72 hours (except for technical necessity) |
| **Transportation PCCs** (Phase 1+) | 7 days |

**Extension Requirements**

Extensions beyond standard maximums require escalating approval:

| Extension | Requirement | Absolute Cap |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Beyond 24 hours** | JSVC documented justification | — |
| **Beyond 72 hours** | Guarantor supermajority approval | 14 days |
| **Beyond 7 days** | Guarantor supermajority approval + restoration plan | 14 days |
| **Beyond 14 days** | Guarantor unanimous approval + restoration plan + daily review | 30 days |

**Note:** No non-medical PCC may remain suspended beyond 30 days under any circumstances; if restoration is not possible, the PCC is reclassified as inoperable and alternative infrastructure must be designated.

**Proportionality Review**

Every suspension undergoes proportionality review:

- Is suspension necessary to address the trigger?
- Is suspension scope limited to affected infrastructure?
- Is suspension duration minimized?
- Are alternatives to suspension exhausted?
- Is civilian harm from suspension proportionate to threat?

| Mechanism | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Redundancy** | Backup systems for critical components |
| **Segmentation** | Failures isolated to segments |
| **Bypass** | Alternative routing where possible |
| **Rapid repair** | Pre-positioned equipment and personnel |

**Security Failure Containment**

| Mechanism | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Incident isolation** | Affected segment suspended, others continue |
| **Enhanced protection** | Increased security on unaffected PCCs |
| **Investigation** | Root cause analysis |
| **Response adjustment** | Protocol modification if needed |

**Operational Failure Containment**

| Mechanism | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Redundant coordination** | Multiple communication channels |
| **Escalation** | Guarantor intervention |
| **Alternative operators** | Backup operational capacity |
| **Documentation** | Record for accountability |

### 7.3 Cross-PCC Isolation

**Independence Principle**

Each PCC operates independently:

- Failure in one PCC does not require closure of others
- Security incidents in one area do not automatically affect distant PCCs
- Party non-cooperation at one PCC does not justify closure of others
- Resource shortfalls addressed without sacrificing operational PCCs

**Isolation Protocols**

| Scenario | Isolation Response |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Attack on one PCC** | Affected PCC protocols; others on enhanced alert |
| **Technical failure** | Affected segment isolated; others continue |
| **Party obstruction at one point** | Document, escalate; others continue |
| **Regional incident** | Assess each PCC individually per shock-absorber |

### 7.4 Cascading Failure Prevention

**Interdependency Management**

| Interdependency | Prevention |
|-----------------|------------|
| **Power-dependent PCCs** | Backup power required |
| **Personnel overlap** | Reserve personnel capacity |
| **Communication systems** | Redundant communications |
| **Single-source resources** | Diversified supply chains |

**Cascade Triggers**

| Trigger | Prevention | Response |
|---------|------------|----------|
| **Mass attack** | Geographic distribution of PCCs | Individual assessment, not blanket closure |
| **Guarantor failure** | Multi-guarantor structure | Remaining guarantors assume load |
| **Economic crisis** | Reserve funding | Draw on reserves, reduce non-essential |
| **Political crisis** | Operational independence | Continue per protocols |

## 8. Geographic Specifications

### 8.1 Gaza PCCs

**Context**

PCCs in Gaza operate under severe constraints:

- De facto control by entity not participating in MCF
- Blockade conditions affecting access
- High civilian need for essential services
- Elevated security environment

**Gaza PCC Scope (Phase 0)**

| PCC Type | Components | Limitations |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| **Water** | Desalination plants, main pipelines, pumping stations | Distribution beyond PCC scope |
| **Electricity** | Grid connections, generation facilities | Supply capacity limited by external factors |
| **Medical supply** | Crossing-point lanes, cold chain facilities | Volume limited by security conditions |
| **Medical transfer** | Emergency crossings, referral pathways | Volume limited by security conditions |

**Gaza-Specific Protocols**

| Protocol | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| **Access arrangements** | Via designated crossings; JSVC observation |
| **Monitoring** | Remote monitoring prioritized; limited on-site presence |
| **Coordination** | Through international organizations where needed |
| **Suspension** | Higher threshold given civilian dependence |

### 8.2 West Bank PCCs

**Context**

PCCs in the West Bank are more numerous but more tightly scoped:

- Multiple administrative zones (A, B, C)
- Settlement presence complicates routing
- Greater operational feasibility
- Higher CMS uptake expected

**West Bank PCC Scope (Phase 0)**

| PCC Type | Components | Limitations |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| **Water** | Shared aquifer infrastructure, major pipelines | Does not address allocation |
| **Electricity** | Grid connections, substations | Existing arrangements continue |
| **Medical** | Major hospitals, referral routes | Facility-based rather than corridor-based |

**West Bank-Specific Protocols**

| Protocol | Specification |
|----------|---------------|
| **Settlement non-inclusion** | Settlements not designated as PCC endpoints |
| **Facility focus** | PCCs centered on specific facilities |
| **Route designation** | Specific road segments rather than areas |
| **Coordination** | Direct party liaison |

### 8.3 Cross-Boundary PCCs

**Cross-Boundary Designation**

PCCs crossing conflict lines require:

- Defined handover points
- Consistent standards across boundary
- Monitoring on both sides
- Unified incident response

**Cross-Boundary Coordination**

| Element | Protocol |
|---------|----------|
| **Handover points** | Documented transfer of monitoring responsibility |
| **Standards** | Identical operational standards throughout |
| **Communication** | Real-time coordination across boundary |
| **Incident response** | Unified response regardless of incident location |
