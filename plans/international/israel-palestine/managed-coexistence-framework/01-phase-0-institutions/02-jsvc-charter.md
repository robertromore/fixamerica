# Joint Security Verification Commission (JSVC) Charter

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#phase-0-years-05-hardened-confederal-security-layer)

**Phase:** Phase 0 onwards (permanent institution)

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## Purpose

The Joint Security Verification Commission (JSVC) is the **permanent verification and deconfliction body** at the heart of MCF's security architecture. It provides procedural trust when interpersonal trust does not exist.

The JSVC succeeds the UVB once both parties consent to joint verification mechanisms. Unlike the UVB, which operates unilaterally, the JSVC involves both parties in governance while maintaining operational independence. This joint structure increases legitimacy and enables deeper cooperation—but only becomes possible after the UVB has demonstrated the value of impartial verification.

---

## Core Principle: Joint Governance, Independent Operation

The JSVC embodies a critical distinction:

- **Governance is joint**: Both parties participate in oversight, policy, and leadership selection
- **Operations are independent**: Neither party controls investigations, findings, or reporting
- **Findings are authoritative**: JSVC determinations are the official MCF record, though not legally binding on national courts

This structure allows parties to share ownership of the verification system while preventing either from manipulating its outputs.

---

## 2. Core Functions

### 2.1 Incident Attribution

**Scope**

JSVC investigates and attributes:

- Security incidents within the MCF operational area
- Incidents affecting MCF institutions, personnel, or participants
- Incidents referred by parties or guarantors
- Patterns of activity suggesting coordination

**Attribution Standards**

| Level | Standard | Requirements |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| **Confirmed Attribution** | Clear and convincing evidence | Multiple independent sources, physical evidence, technical verification |
| **Probable Attribution** | Preponderance of evidence | Strong circumstantial evidence, corroborated sources |
| **Possible Attribution** | Reasonable basis | Credible evidence suggesting involvement |
| **Undetermined** | Insufficient evidence | Investigation complete, attribution not possible |

**Attribution Process**

1. Incident reported or detected
2. Initial assessment (24 hours)
3. Investigation assigned
4. Evidence collection (per Section 2.2)
5. Analysis and attribution determination
6. Commission review (Tier 3-4 incidents)
7. Finding publication

**Incident Tier Definitions**

| Tier | Criteria | Examples |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Tier 1** | Minor incidents, no casualties, limited property damage | Vandalism, minor altercations, verbal threats |
| **Tier 2** | Moderate incidents, injuries (non-fatal), significant property damage | Assaults, arson, infrastructure damage |
| **Tier 3** | Serious incidents, fatalities (1-4), major property destruction | Shootings, bombings with limited casualties, major infrastructure attacks |
| **Tier 4** | Mass casualty events (5+), strategic attacks, cross-border operations | Mass shootings, rocket attacks, military operations, terrorism |

Tier classification determines investigation priority, approval requirements, and publication timelines.

**Attribution Determinations**

JSVC attribution determines:

- What happened (incident description)
- Who was involved (to extent determinable)
- What evidence supports the finding
- Confidence level
- Pattern context (if applicable)

JSVC attribution does **not** determine:

- Legal guilt or innocence
- Appropriate punishment
- Political responsibility
- Compensation obligations

### 2.2 Evidence Collection

**Evidence Authority**

JSVC has authority to:

- Request access to incident sites
- Interview witnesses (voluntary)
- Collect physical evidence
- Request documents from parties
- Receive information from guarantors
- Monitor open sources

JSVC does **not** have authority to:

- Compel testimony
- Execute search warrants
- Seize property
- Arrest individuals
- Access classified national security information (without party consent)

**Chain of Custody**

All evidence is subject to:

- Documentation at collection
- Secure storage with access logging
- Transfer protocols with signatures
- Preservation for minimum 25 years (aligned with UVB retention policy per [Annex E](01-uvb-charter.md#annex-e-data-management))
- Defense access for resulting proceedings, subject to:
    - Source identity redaction (sources may consent to disclosure)
    - Witness protection review before disclosure
    - Court-supervised access where proceedings require
    - No bulk disclosure; case-specific authorization required

**Technical Standards**

Evidence collection follows international standards:

- ISO 17025 for forensic laboratories
- ISO 17020 for inspection bodies
- INTERPOL standards for digital evidence
- ICRC standards for conflict documentation

**Site Access**

- JSVC requests access through party liaison
- Standard response: 24 hours (routine), 6 hours (urgent)
- Access includes reasonable perimeter
- Party security escort permitted but may not restrict JSVC movement
- Denial documented and reported

### 2.3 Secure Communication Channels

**Hotline System**

JSVC operates secure hotlines between:

- Party security commands
- JSVC operations center
- Guarantor security liaisons

Hotlines are:

- Operational 24/7
- Encrypted and recorded
- Staffed by trained personnel
- Subject to response time requirements

**Response Requirements**

| Communication Type | Response Requirement |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Imminent threat notification | Immediate acknowledgment, 15-minute substantive response |
| Active incident coordination | Continuous communication until resolved |
| Investigation request | 24-hour acknowledgment, 72-hour initial response |
| Clarification request | 48-hour response |
| Routine communication | 5-business-day response |

**Escalation**

Non-response triggers escalation:

1. Reminder at response deadline
2. Escalation to senior party liaison (deadline + 24 hours)
3. Escalation to Commission (deadline + 48 hours)
4. Guarantor notification (deadline + 72 hours)
5. Public documentation (deadline + 7 days)

### 2.4 Clarification Requests

**Clarification Authority**

JSVC may request clarification from parties on:

- Force movements and activities
- Incidents and operations
- Policy and procedures
- Individual actions by party personnel

**Clarification Process**

1. JSVC issues written clarification request
2. Party has 72 hours to respond (routine) or 24 hours (urgent)
3. Response is documented and assessed
4. Follow-up questions if needed
5. Final assessment incorporated into findings

**Non-Response Consequences**

- Documented in incident record
- Noted in public reporting
- May affect attribution confidence level
- Pattern of non-response reported to guarantors

### 2.5 Deconfliction

**Operational Deconfliction**

JSVC facilitates deconfliction of:

- Security force operations near boundaries
- MCF program activities
- Emergency response coordination
- Infrastructure maintenance in sensitive areas

**Deconfliction Process**

1. Party notifies JSVC of planned activity
2. JSVC assesses potential conflicts
3. JSVC notifies other party (if appropriate)
4. Parties coordinate through JSVC or directly
5. Activity proceeds with reduced friction risk

**Deconfliction Limitations**

JSVC deconfliction is:

- Voluntary (parties choose whether to participate)
- Advisory (JSVC does not approve or prohibit operations)
- Confidential (notifications not shared beyond need)
- Non-binding (parties retain operational authority)

---

## 3. Decision-Making

### 3.1 Commission Decisions

**Decision Categories**

| Category | Voting Requirement |
|----------|-------------------|
| Operational policies | Simple majority of voting members |
| Personnel appointments | 5 of 7 (all commissioners vote) |
| Budget approval | 5 of 7 (all commissioners vote) |
| Charter amendments | 6 of 7 + guarantor approval (all commissioners vote) |
| Incident findings (Tier 3-4) | 5 of 7 (all commissioners vote) |
| Emergency actions | Chair + 2 commissioners (subject to full Commission review) |

**Voting Procedures**

- Each commissioner has one vote
- **Simple majority items:** Chair votes only to break ties
- **Supermajority items (5 of 7 or 6 of 7):** All commissioners including Chair vote; threshold is of total Commission (7)
- Votes are recorded and archived
- Commissioners may submit written dissents

### 3.2 Operational Decisions

**Director Authority**

The Director may:

- Initiate investigations
- Assign resources
- Issue preliminary findings
- Manage day-to-day operations

Without Commission approval for:

- Routine operations within approved policies
- Investigations of Tier 1-2 incidents
- Administrative decisions within budget
- Emergency responses (subject to Commission review)

**Commission Review**

Commission reviews and approves:

- Tier 3-4 incident findings before publication
- New investigation policies
- Budget reallocations above threshold
- Personnel actions above Deputy Director level

### 3.3 Deadlock Procedures

**Definition**

Deadlock occurs when:

- Commission cannot reach required majority after two votes
- Dispute persists for more than 14 days
- Parties or commissioners request deadlock resolution

**Resolution Process (Policy, Budget, Personnel)**

For deadlocks on policy, budget, or personnel matters:

1. Chair attempts mediation (7 days)
2. Guarantor observer invited to facilitate (7 days)
3. If unresolved, guarantor panel decision (14 days)
4. Guarantor panel decision is binding for that matter

**Deadlock on Incident Findings (Special Rule)**

For deadlocks on incident findings specifically, guarantor panel resolution does **not** apply. Instead:

- Finding is issued as "Commission divided"
- All positions documented with supporting evidence
- No attribution assigned
- Pattern analysis may note the dispute

**Rationale:** Attribution findings carry significant political weight. Guarantor-imposed attribution could undermine JSVC credibility and be perceived as external interference in fact-finding. "Commission divided" preserves the evidentiary record without forcing attribution where genuine disagreement exists.

### 3.4 Minority Opinions

Commissioners may:

- Submit written dissents attached to decisions
- Request dissent be included in public reporting
- Not be penalized for dissent
- Not disclose confidential deliberations

## 8. Phase Transition Certification Authority

### 8.1 Institutional Basis

The JSVC serves as the **certification authority for MCF phase transitions**. This function emerges organically from the JSVC's core mandate: the body that measures stability is the body best positioned to certify when predefined stability thresholds have been met.

**Why JSVC, Not a Separate Body:**

- Already embedded in the system with established credibility
- Already producing trusted data on incidents, compliance, and patterns
- Already subject to transparency and multi-party oversight
- Already understood by all parties as neutral and rule-bound

Creating a separate phase transition authority would invite legitimacy challenges, political capture attempts, and accusations of artificiality. Embedding the function within JSVC makes certification feel inevitable rather than imposed.

### 8.2 Certification vs. Decision

**Critical Distinction:**

The JSVC **certifies** whether predefined criteria have been met. It does not **decide** whether phase transitions should occur.

| JSVC Does | JSVC Does Not |
|-----------|---------------|
| Measure against predefined metrics | Set the metrics |
| Certify threshold achievement | Vote on whether to advance |
| Document compliance status | Negotiate political conditions |
| Trigger automatic processes | Exercise discretionary authority |

Once JSVC certifies that criteria are met, transition triggers automatically unless a narrowly defined emergency override is invoked through a separate, higher-friction process.

This design prevents:

- Political bargaining inside the oversight body
- Quiet delays due to external pressure
- Accusations that JSVC is "choosing sides"

The JSVC becomes a referee, not a gatekeeper.

### 8.3 Phase Transition Criteria

> **Note:** This section summarizes transition criteria for JSVC certification purposes. The authoritative detailed criteria, assessment methodology, and threshold interpretation rules are in [Phase Transitions](../08-operational-procedures/02-phase-transitions.md).

**Phase 0 → Phase 1 Criteria:**

| Category | Metric | Threshold | Observation Window |
|----------|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Incident frequency** | Tier 3-4 incidents | ≤ 2 per month (rolling avg) | 24 months |
| **Escalation containment** | Contained within 48 hours | ≥ 80% | 24 months |
| **Attribution rate** | Incidents attributed with confidence | ≥ 70% | 24 months |
| **Attribution acceptance** | Findings accepted by both parties | ≥ 60% | 24 months |
| **PCC functionality** | Corridors operational | ≥ 95% uptime | 12 months |
| **Party cooperation** | JSVC requests honored | ≥ 80% | 18 months |
| **Guarantor assessment** | Positive stability rating | All guarantors | Current |

**Phase 1 → Phase 2 Criteria:**

| Category | Metric | Threshold | Observation Window |
|----------|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **CMS enrollment** | Active holders | ≥ 50,000 | 24 months |
| **CMS retention** | Annual renewal rate | ≥ 80% | 24 months |
| **Employment integration** | CMS holders employed cross-community | ≥ 10,000 | 24 months |
| **Arbitration resolution** | Commercial disputes resolved | ≥ 90% | 24 months |
| **CMS holder incidents** | Serious incidents against holders | ≤ 10 per year | 24 months |
| **SAZ interest** | Expressed interest in SAZ residency | ≥ 5,000 | Current |
| **Phase 0 metrics** | All Phase 0 metrics maintained | Above threshold | Continuous |

**Phase 2 → Phase 3 Criteria:**

| Category | Metric | Threshold | Observation Window |
|----------|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| **SAZ safety** | Crime/violence vs surrounding areas | ≤ 50% | 60 months |
| **SAZ demand** | Waiting list or full occupancy | Continuous | 60 months |
| **Resident satisfaction** | Positive annual survey response | ≥ 70% | 36 months |
| **Governance stability** | No major governance crises | Continuous | 60 months |
| **Referendum support** | CMS holders support integration | ≥ 60% each community | As conducted |
| **All prior metrics** | Phase 0/1/2 metrics maintained | Above threshold | Continuous |

### 8.4 Certification Process

**Step 1: Data Collection**

- JSVC continuously monitors all metrics
- Quarterly metric reports published
- Trend analysis maintained

**Step 2: Threshold Assessment**

When metrics approach threshold:

- JSVC Analysis Unit prepares formal assessment
- Assessment reviewed by Director
- Preliminary finding submitted to Commission

**Step 3: Commission Review**

- Commission reviews assessment against criteria
- No discretionary judgment on whether to transition
- Only verification that criteria are accurately measured
- 5 of 7 vote required to certify (or reject certification as inaccurate)

**Step 4: Publication and Trigger**

- Certification published with full supporting data
- 30-day notice period before transition takes effect
- Emergency override window (see Section 8.6)
- Automatic transition at end of notice period unless override invoked

### 8.5 Regression Certification

Phase regression follows similar but **asymmetric** rules:

**Regression Triggers** (any one sufficient):

- Tier 4 incident with confirmed coordination
- Pattern of Tier 3 incidents (> 3 in 6 months)
- Sustained PCC breakdown (> 30 days)
- Mass CMS revocations (> 10% of holders)
- Guarantor withdrawal from certification

**Regression Process:**

1. JSVC certifies trigger condition met
2. 7-day notice period (shorter due to urgency)
3. Automatic regression unless trigger is resolved
4. Regression scope determined by trigger severity

**Regression is Not Permanent:**

- Regression resets observation windows
- Criteria for re-advancement remain unchanged
- Prior progress is not negated, only paused

### 8.6 Emergency Override

**Purpose:**

Emergency override exists for rare circumstances where mechanical certification would produce clearly destabilizing results despite metric achievement.

**Override Authority:**

- Unanimous guarantor invocation required
- Both parties must not object (abstention permitted)
- JSVC Commission must concur (5 of 7)

**Override Limitations:**

- Maximum duration: 6 months
- Must be publicly documented with specific justification
- Subject to automatic review at 3 months
- Renewal requires same supermajority
- May not be invoked more than twice for same transition

**Override May NOT:**

- Suspend CRC protections
- Reverse completed transitions
- Delay transition indefinitely
- Be invoked for political convenience

**Override Expires Automatically:**

If not renewed, transition proceeds at override expiration regardless of circumstances.

### 8.7 Asymmetric Protective Design

JSVC's phase authority flows **in one direction**: certifying readiness to expand rights and participation, not suspending them. When JSVC certifies a regression trigger, the resulting benefit suspension is an automatic consequence of the regression protocol, not a JSVC order. JSVC certifies conditions; it does not direct operational changes.

**JSVC May:**

- Certify advancement conditions met
- Certify regression triggers present
- Recommend (not require) emergency caution

**JSVC May NOT:**

- Suspend CRC rights
- Halt civilian protections
- Freeze CMS benefits
- Close PCCs unilaterally

This asymmetry protects against politicization. The JSVC cannot be pressured to "delay" a transition by threatening to withdraw cooperation, because withdrawal would trigger regression criteria, not delay advancement.

### 8.8 Independence Guarantees

JSVC phase certification independence is protected through:

| Mechanism | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Fixed terms | Commissioners cannot be removed for unwelcome certifications |
| Mixed appointment | No single authority controls all appointments |
| Public reporting | All metrics and certifications are public |
| Disqualification rules | Conflicts of interest prevent participation |
| No operational control | JSVC cannot be threatened with operational consequences |
| Guarantor oversight | Guarantors review process, not outcomes |
