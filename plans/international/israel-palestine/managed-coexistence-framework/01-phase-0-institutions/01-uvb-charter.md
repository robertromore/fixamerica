# Unilateral Verification Body (UVB) Charter

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#framework-entry-point-how-institutions-begin-without-mutual-agreement)

**Phase:** Phase 0 (initial mechanism, transitions to JSVC)

**Status:** Final Draft (Annexes pending implementation)

---

## Purpose

The Unilateral Verification Body (UVB) serves as the **initial verification mechanism** before the Joint Security Verification Commission (JSVC) can be established. It is designed to begin operating **without requiring mutual agreement** between the parties.

The UVB exists because MCF cannot wait for negotiated consent to establish credible verification. Traditional peace processes require both parties to agree on monitoring mechanisms before those mechanisms can operate—but that agreement is often the hardest part to achieve and the first casualty of renewed violence. The UVB inverts this logic: it builds verification credibility first, creating the conditions under which joint mechanisms become possible.

---

## Core Principle: Verification Before Agreement

The UVB operates on the principle that **credible verification can precede political agreement**. By establishing factual baselines and demonstrating impartial documentation capacity, the UVB creates value that both parties can recognize even without endorsing the framework that provides it.

---

## 1. Legal Foundation

### 1.1 Authority Derivation

The UVB does not derive its authority from bilateral agreement between the conflict parties. Instead, it operates under a combination of:

**Guarantor Authorization**

- Guarantor states and international organizations establish the UVB through their own legal instruments
- The UVB is constituted as an international body with guarantor-conferred mandate
- This mandate is legally sufficient within guarantor jurisdictions and international law

**Unilateral Consent**

- Either party may unilaterally consent to UVB operations within territory it controls
- Consent from one party is sufficient for UVB to operate in that party's territory
- Consent may be granted, modified, or withdrawn, but withdrawal does not invalidate findings made during the consent period

**International Law Basis**

- UVB operations comply with international humanitarian law and human rights law
- Verification activities are consistent with UN Charter principles
- UVB does not claim authority that would require bilateral agreement under international law

### 1.2 Relationship to Existing Mechanisms

The UVB is designed to complement, not replace, existing international monitoring:

| Existing Mechanism | UVB Relationship |
|-------------------|------------------|
| UN agencies (UNRWA, OCHA, etc.) | Coordination, information sharing, non-duplication |
| ICRC | Complementary mandates, deconfliction of access |
| Bilateral monitoring (if any) | UVB provides independent baseline |
| NGO monitoring | UVB may incorporate NGO data with verification |

The UVB's distinctive contribution is **pattern documentation over time**—building cumulative records that existing episodic monitoring does not provide.

### 1.3 Guarantor Role in Establishment

Guarantors are responsible for:

- Adopting the UVB Charter through their own legal processes
- Providing initial funding and personnel secondment
- Granting UVB access to guarantor-controlled resources (satellites, intelligence where appropriate)
- Defending UVB's legitimacy in international forums
- Ensuring UVB findings are usable in guarantor policy responses

## 3. Verification Mandate

### 3.0 Mandate Area Definition

**Geographic Scope:**

The UVB mandate area encompasses:

- **Gaza Strip:** Full territory within internationally recognized boundaries
- **West Bank:** Full territory within the 1949 Armistice Line (Green Line), including East Jerusalem
- **Israel:** Territory within the Green Line, limited to incidents with cross-boundary implications or affecting CMS holders

**Operational Notes:**

- Gaza and West Bank may operate under different modes (see [Geographic Differentiation](../00-introduction.md#geographic-differentiation-gaza-and-the-west-bank))
- Jerusalem operates under special protocols (see [Jerusalem](../06-sensitive-issues/02-jerusalem.md))
- Mandate area may expand to include External SAZ locations when established
- Cross-border incidents (e.g., rocket attacks, airstrikes) are within mandate regardless of origin point

### 3.1 What UVB Verifies

The UVB's verification mandate encompasses:

**Security Incidents**

- Violent incidents causing death or injury
- Property destruction
- Weapons use (type, origin where determinable)
- Force movements and deployments
- Ceasefire or agreement violations (where agreements exist)

**Infrastructure Status**

- Utility infrastructure condition (water, electricity, communications)
- Transportation corridor accessibility
- Medical facility functionality
- Damage assessment following incidents

**Pattern Indicators**

- Escalation/de-escalation trends
- Geographic concentration of incidents
- Temporal patterns (time of day, correlation with events)
- Actor identification where evidence permits

### 3.2 What UVB Does Not Verify

The UVB explicitly excludes from its mandate:

| Exclusion | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| Legal determinations of guilt | UVB documents facts, not legal conclusions |
| Sovereignty claims | UVB operates regardless of territorial disputes |
| Political legitimacy | UVB does not assess which actors are legitimate |
| Compliance with national law | UVB uses international standards only |
| Historical claims | UVB documents present and recent past only |

### 3.3 Evidence Standards

**Tiered Confidence Levels**

| Level | Standard | Use |
|-------|----------|-----|
| **Confirmed** | Multiple independent sources, physical evidence, technical verification | Public reporting, guarantor action |
| **Probable** | Strong single source or multiple corroborating sources | Internal analysis, pattern documentation |
| **Possible** | Single credible source, circumstantial evidence | Monitoring, further investigation |
| **Unverified** | Report received but not corroborated | Record only, no attribution |

**Evidence Types**

- Physical evidence (collected by UVB or provided by parties)
- Imagery (satellite, aerial, ground-based)
- Electronic data (communications intercepts only from guarantor sources with legal authorization)
- Witness testimony (recorded, assessed for credibility)
- Documentary evidence (official statements, records)
- Open-source information (media, social media with verification)

### 3.4 Pattern Analysis

Beyond individual incident documentation, the UVB conducts **pattern analysis** to identify:

- Recurring signatures suggesting common actors or methods
- Escalation dynamics and trigger events
- Correlation between political events and security incidents
- Long-term trends in violence levels and types

Pattern analysis findings are reported separately from incident documentation, with explicit acknowledgment of analytical uncertainty.

## 4. Operating Procedures

### 4.1 Information Gathering

**Passive Collection**

- Monitoring of open sources (media, official statements, social media)
- Receipt of reports from parties, NGOs, and public
- Satellite imagery review (regular and triggered)
- Guarantor-provided intelligence (with source protection)

**Active Collection**

**Access Conditions**

- UVB personnel operate unarmed
- Security escort may be provided by controlling party but cannot restrict UVB movement within agreed site
- UVB may decline escort if it compromises verification integrity
- UVB carries distinctive identification and vehicles

**Access Denial Consequences**

- Denial is itself documented as a finding
- Repeated denial may trigger guarantor diplomatic response
- Denial does not prevent UVB from reporting based on other sources
- Pattern of denial is reported in aggregate assessments

### 4.3 Communication with Parties

**Formal Channels**

- Each party designates a UVB liaison office
- UVB provides advance notification of routine operations (except rapid response)
- **Rapid response** is triggered by: mass casualty events (≥5 deaths), infrastructure attacks, or JSVC/guarantor urgent request; no advance notification required
- Parties may submit information and requests through liaison
- UVB responds to party inquiries within defined timelines

**Incident Notification**

- UVB notifies relevant party within 48 hours of documenting an incident attributed to that party's forces or territory
- Party has 7 days to provide response or additional information
- Response is incorporated into final documentation

**Neutrality in Communication**

- UVB uses identical procedures with all parties
- Communications are documented and archived
- No informal or back-channel arrangements

### 4.4 Reporting Timelines

| Report Type | Timeline | Distribution |
|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Flash Report (major incident) | Within 24 hours | Guarantors, parties |
| Incident Report | Within 14 days | Guarantors, parties, public (redacted) |
| Weekly Summary | Every Monday | Guarantors, parties, public |

- Aggregate statistics are published in machine-readable formats

**Limitations Transparency**

- UVB explicitly states confidence levels
- Access denials and their impact on findings are documented
- Analytical uncertainty is acknowledged
- Corrections are issued promptly when errors are identified

### 5.3 Contested Findings

**Party Challenge Process**

1. Party submits written challenge within 14 days of report
2. UVB reviews challenge and any new evidence provided
3. UVB issues response within 14 days:
   - Affirm original finding
   - Modify finding based on new evidence
   - Acknowledge uncertainty and note disputed status
4. Challenge and response are appended to original report

**Guarantor Review**

- Guarantors may request UVB to re-examine specific findings
- Re-examination follows same process as party challenge

**No External Override**

- Neither parties nor guarantors can compel UVB to change findings
- Disputed findings remain in the record with dispute notation
- Persistent disputes are noted in pattern assessments

---

## 6. Transition to JSVC

### 6.1 Transition Criteria

The UVB transitions to JSVC when the following conditions are met:

**Necessary Conditions (all required)**

- Both parties formally consent to joint verification mechanism
- Both parties agree to JSVC Charter (or substantially similar terms)
- Guarantors certify that joint operations are feasible
- At least 18 months of UVB operation demonstrating verification value

**Sufficient Conditions (indicators of readiness)**

- Parties regularly engaging with UVB findings (even if disputing them)
- Access denial rate below 20% for both parties
- Both parties providing information to UVB voluntarily
- No UVB personnel security incidents caused by parties in prior 6 months

### 6.2 Transition Process

**Pre-Transition (6 months)**

1. Guarantors initiate JSVC Charter negotiation with parties
2. UVB continues normal operations
3. UVB prepares transition documentation and institutional memory
4. JSVC personnel recruitment begins (including potential UVB staff retention)

**Transition (3 months)**

1. JSVC formally established
2. UVB and JSVC operate in parallel for overlap period
3. Case files and archives transferred to JSVC
4. UVB staff offered JSVC positions or separation packages
5. JSVC assumes primary verification responsibility

**Post-Transition**

1. UVB formally dissolved
2. UVB archives preserved under JSVC custody
3. UVB findings remain valid and citable
4. Former UVB Director available for 6 months consultancy to JSVC

### 6.3 Institutional Continuity

**What Transfers to JSVC**

- All verified findings and evidence archives
- Methodology documentation and lessons learned
- Ongoing investigations (with status documentation)
- Relationships with sources (with consent)
- Technical infrastructure and equipment

**What Changes with JSVC**

- Governance becomes joint (party participation in oversight)
- Staffing may include party nationals (with safeguards)
- Mandate may expand based on party agreement
- Reporting may include additional party-specific channels

**What Remains Constant**

- Evidence standards and methodology
- Independence of findings from political pressure
- Transparency requirements
- Guarantor oversight role

### 6.4 Relationship to Phase Transitions

**Institutional vs. Phase Transition**

The UVB → JSVC transition is an **institutional evolution**, distinct from but related to MCF **phase transitions**:

| Transition Type | What Changes | Trigger |
|-----------------|--------------|---------|
| **UVB → JSVC** | Governance structure, staffing, mandate scope | Party consent to joint mechanism |
| **Phase 0 → Phase 1** | MCF-wide expansion of programs and protections | JSVC certification of stability criteria |

**Sequencing**

- UVB → JSVC transition typically precedes or accompanies Phase 0 → Phase 1
- JSVC must be operational before it can certify phase transitions
- Phase 0 → Phase 1 criteria (see [JSVC Charter Section 8.3](02-jsvc-charter.md#83-phase-transition-criteria)) assume JSVC is functioning

**Phase Certification Authority**

Once JSVC is established, it assumes responsibility for certifying MCF phase transitions. This authority grows organically from UVB's core function: the body that measures stability is best positioned to certify when stability thresholds are met.

See [JSVC Charter Section 8: Phase Transition Certification Authority](02-jsvc-charter.md#8-phase-transition-certification-authority) for detailed criteria and procedures.

## 7. Security and Risk Management

### 7.1 Personnel Security

**Risk Assessment**

- Continuous threat assessment by UVB security unit
- Coordination with guarantor security services
- Party notification of personnel movements (as appropriate)

**Protective Measures**

- Armored vehicles for field operations
- Secure communications
- Safe houses in multiple locations
- Emergency extraction procedures
- Medical support and evacuation capability

**Incident Response**

- All security incidents involving UVB personnel documented and reported
- Incidents against UVB personnel trigger guarantor response
- Patterns of targeting documented in public reporting

### 7.2 Information Security

**Classification and Tiered Access**

| Classification | Internal | Guarantors | Parties | Public |
|----------------|----------|------------|---------|--------|
| Source identities | Yes | No (except life-threatening emergency with Director approval) | No | No |
| Raw/unverified evidence | Yes | No | No | No |
| Verified evidence | Yes | Yes (source-redacted) | No | No |
| Draft findings | Yes | No | No | No |
| Final findings | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes (redacted) |

- Source identities are strictly protected at all levels
- Guarantors receive verified evidence only, with source identities redacted
- Raw/unverified evidence remains internal until verification complete

**Cybersecurity**

- Isolated networks for sensitive data
- Encryption for all communications
- Regular security audits
- No party-provided IT equipment or services

### 7.3 Operational Security

- Field team movements unpredictable where possible (applies to timing, routes, and team composition—not to the fact of a visit, which is notified per Section 4.3)
- Advance notification specifies date and general area only; exact timing and approach routes remain operational discretion
- Multiple communication redundancy
- Abort procedures for compromised operations
- Regular security briefings for all personnel

---

## 8. Accountability

- Response to guarantor inquiries within 30 days
- External evaluation every 3 years

### 8.3 Public Accountability

- Published methodology and standards
- Public reporting on findings
- Response to public inquiries (within mandate)
- Correction of errors in public record

---

## 9. Deployment Logistics

### 9.1 Personnel Entry

UVB international personnel must physically enter the mandate area to conduct operations. This section addresses deployment logistics, including scenarios where one party blocks entry.

**Primary Entry Routes**

| Route | Controller | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Ben Gurion International Airport | Israel | Primary route; subject to Israeli visa/entry policy |
| Allenby/King Hussein Bridge (Jordan) | Israel/Jordan (Israeli security control on western side) | Alternative; subject to Israeli security screening |
| Rafah Crossing (Egypt) | Egypt/variable | Gaza access; availability depends on political conditions |
| Erez Crossing | Israel | Gaza access; Israeli-controlled |

**Entry Denial Scenarios**

If Israel denies visas or entry to UVB personnel:

1. **Guarantor diplomatic facilitation**: Guarantor states use diplomatic channels to secure entry. This is the primary response and is a core guarantor obligation under the framework agreement
2. **Alternative entry via Jordan/Egypt**: Where the PA or other cooperating party controls or can facilitate access through non-Israeli-controlled crossings, UVB deploys through those routes
3. **Minimum viable deployment**: UVB begins operations within cooperating party territory only, documenting the access denial as a finding per Section 4.2

### 9.2 Asymmetric Start

UVB may initially operate on one side only. This is an acknowledged limitation, not a framework failure.

**Single-Territory Operation**

If confined to Palestinian-controlled territory:

- UVB documents incidents within accessible areas
- Incidents in inaccessible areas documented from external sources (satellite imagery, witness testimony from border areas, open-source monitoring)
- Access denial is itself documented and reported to guarantors
- UVB credibility established in operating territory creates pressure for access in non-cooperating territory

**Expansion Pathway**

- Guarantor diplomatic pressure for access expansion is continuous
- Demonstrated UVB professionalism and impartiality in operating territory provides basis for non-cooperating party to grant access
- Access expansion may be incremental (specific sites, specific incident types) before full mandate-area access is achieved

### 9.3 Guarantor Facilitation Obligations

Guarantor states commit, as part of the framework agreement, to:

- Facilitate visa issuance for UVB personnel through their own diplomatic processes
- Exert diplomatic pressure on parties that block UVB entry
- Provide transit arrangements through guarantor-accessible territory where applicable
- Include UVB access in bilateral diplomatic agendas with conflict parties

Entry facilitation is a **concrete, measurable guarantor obligation**, not a general aspiration. Failure to actively facilitate UVB entry is documented in guarantor performance assessments (see [Guarantor Coordination](../04-guarantor-architecture/04-guarantor-coordination.md)).
