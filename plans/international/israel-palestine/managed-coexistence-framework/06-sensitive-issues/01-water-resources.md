# Water and Critical Resources

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#water-and-critical-resources-operational-equity-without-sovereign-resolution)

**Phase:** All Phases

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## Purpose

Water and Critical Resources defines MCF's approach to **resource-related conflicts without resolving resource sovereignty**.

MCF does not attempt to resolve water ownership, allocation ratios, or historical distribution disputes. These are final-status political questions. Instead, MCF establishes operational deconfliction and harm prevention mechanisms that allow civilian life to continue while preserving all parties' future claims.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Operational Equity, Not Sovereign Resolution

MCF addresses how water systems operate day-to-day without determining who owns the water or what the "fair" allocation should be.

**What This Means:**
- Protected infrastructure regardless of who controls it
- Emergency access provisions
- Deconfliction protocols
- No allocation adjudication

### 2. Deconfliction, Not Distribution

MCF prevents water from being weaponized or disrupted, but does not redistribute water according to any formula.

**What This Means:**
- Targeting water infrastructure is a violation
- Withholding water as coercion is prohibited
- Existing allocations continue (no MCF change)
- Future distribution is a political question

### 3. Life-Critical Protection

Water is treated as a civilian-critical system requiring special protection regardless of political disputes.

**What This Means:**
- Protected Civic Corridors for water infrastructure
- Verification of water-related incidents
- Emergency response protocols
- Humanitarian minimums enforced

### 4. Non-Preclusion of Claims

MCF arrangements do not prejudice any party's claims to water resources.

**What This Means:**
- Operational cooperation does not validate allocations
- Claims to aquifer sovereignty preserved
- Historical grievances remain political questions
- Future renegotiation unaffected

## Water Resources Context

### 1. Key Water Sources

**Mountain Aquifer:**
- Shared Israeli-Palestinian water source
- Contested allocation and extraction rights
- Israeli infrastructure controls most access
- Palestinian access severely limited

**Coastal Aquifer:**
- Gaza primary groundwater source
- Severe depletion and contamination
- Seawater intrusion
- Barely potable

**Jordan River:**
- Minimal Palestinian access
- Israeli-Jordanian allocation agreements
- Symbolic and practical significance

**Desalination:**
- Gaza increasingly dependent on desalinated water
- Energy-intensive, electricity-dependent
- Israeli desalination capacity significant
- Palestinian capacity limited

### 2. Current Inequities

**Consumption Disparity:**
- Israeli per capita consumption: ~250 liters/day
- West Bank Palestinian: ~70 liters/day
- Gaza: ~80 liters/day (much non-potable)
- WHO minimum: 100 liters/day

**Infrastructure Control:**
- Israel controls most water infrastructure
- Palestinian Authority limited extraction permits
- Gaza infrastructure degraded
- Distribution subject to Israeli approval

**Note:** MCF documents these facts without adjudicating the justice of current arrangements.

### 3. Weaponization Risk

Water has been used as leverage:
- Infrastructure damage during military operations
- Access restrictions during tensions
- Permit denials affecting supply
- Power cuts affecting desalination

MCF treats deliberate civilian water deprivation as a high-severity violation.

## Protected Civic Corridor Application

### 1. Water Infrastructure as PCC

**Covered Infrastructure:**
- Treatment plants
- Pumping stations
- Distribution networks
- Storage facilities
- Power inputs to water systems
- Maintenance access routes

**Protection Level:**
- Highest protection within PCC framework
- Immediate escalation for violations
- Guarantor notification
- International documentation

### 2. PCC Limitations for Water

**PCCs Do Not:**
- Change ownership or control
- Alter allocation formulas
- Grant new extraction rights
- Redistribute resources

**PCCs Do:**
- Protect infrastructure from attack
- Enable emergency maintenance
- Document incidents
- Prevent coercive shutoffs

### 3. Emergency Access

**Emergency Protocols:**
- Maintenance crew access during crises
- Repair authorization expedited
- Verification of emergency character
- Security coordination

**Emergency Defined:**
- Infrastructure damage threatening supply
- Contamination requiring response
- System failure affecting population
- Not routine maintenance disputes

---

## Verification Mechanisms

### 1. Water-Related Verification

**JSVC/UVB Verification Covers:**
- Deliberate infrastructure targeting
- Coercive supply restriction
- Access denial without security basis
- Disproportionate water measures

**Verification Does Not Cover:**
- Whether allocation is "fair"
- Ownership of water sources
- Historical distribution disputes
- Future allocation negotiations

### 2. Verification Standards

**Violation Determination:**
- Was infrastructure deliberately targeted?
- Was supply deliberately restricted as coercion?
- Was access denied without proportionate security justification?
- Did action cause civilian water deprivation?

**Evidence Standards:**
- Physical evidence of damage
- Supply data analysis
- Contemporaneous documentation
- Pattern analysis

### 3. Documentation Without Adjudication

**What Is Documented:**
- Incidents and facts
- Impact on civilian water access
- Response adequacy
- Pattern identification

**What Is Not Adjudicated:**
- Justice of underlying allocation
- Sovereignty over resources
- Historical claims
- Future entitlements

## Gaza Water Crisis

### 1. Containment Priority

Gaza's water crisis is treated as a **containment priority**—an ongoing humanitarian emergency requiring immediate stabilization, not a leverage point in political disputes.

**Current Situation:**
- Aquifer over-extracted and contaminated
- Desalination dependent on electricity
- Electricity supply unreliable
- 97% of groundwater unfit for drinking

### 2. MCF Approach

**Desalination Protection:**
- Desalination facilities treated as protected infrastructure
- Power inputs to desalination protected
- Emergency fuel provisions
- Maintenance access guaranteed

**Power-Water Coupling:**
- Water treatment electricity needs recognized
- Power shutoffs affecting water are high-severity violations
- Redundancy planning supported
- International attention to nexus

**Humanitarian Minimum:**
- Verification of minimum supply maintenance
- Emergency water provision during crises
- Documentation of shortfalls
- Guarantor engagement if thresholds breached

### 3. What MCF Does Not Resolve

**Not Resolved:**
- Gaza's long-term water security
- Aquifer rehabilitation
- Distribution infrastructure development
- Sustainable water source

**Rationale:**
- These require political agreements MCF cannot provide
- Infrastructure investment requires stability
- Long-term solutions depend on political track
- MCF provides stabilization, not resolution

---

## Phased Approach

### Phase 0-1: Deconfliction Only

**Activities:**
- PCC protection for water infrastructure
- Incident verification
- Emergency access protocols
- Documentation

**Not Undertaken:**
- Allocation review
- Infrastructure development
- Distribution reform
- Governance changes

### Phase 2: Expanded Cooperation

**If Stability Achieved:**
- Joint technical committees (voluntary)
- Infrastructure maintenance cooperation
- Emergency response coordination
- Capacity sharing (voluntary)

**Still Not Undertaken:**
- Allocation renegotiation
- Sovereignty determination
- Ownership changes

### Phase 3+: Procedural Review Mechanisms

**If Sustained Stability:**
- Voluntary technical review of allocations
- Agreed methodologies
- Expert assessment
- Non-binding recommendations

**Process Requirements:**
- Both parties consent
- International facilitation
- Technical (not political) framing
- Recommendations, not binding determinations

**Future Resolution:**
- Full allocation resolution remains political
- MCF facilitates but does not determine
- Final status negotiations remain primary track

- Beyond MCF: Political resolution of allocation

### 2. Investment Facilitation

**If Stability Achieved:**
- International investment in infrastructure
- Technical assistance for development
- Capacity building support
- Guarantor funding for shared systems

**Investment Does Not:**
- Determine ownership
- Resolve allocation
- Create sovereignty precedent
