# Settlements: Operational Pragmatism Without Legitimization

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md)

**Phase:** All Phases

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## Purpose

Settlements addresses how MCF provides **explicit treatment of Israeli settlements** in the West Bank without requiring their removal or legitimization as a precondition for MCF operation.

MCF cannot ignore settlements—they are home to over 700,000 Israelis and constitute a major physical and political reality. Equally, MCF cannot legitimize settlements—this would delegitimize the framework among Palestinians and violate international legal consensus. The approach is **operational pragmatism without legal endorsement**.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Explicit Acknowledgment

MCF explicitly acknowledges settlements exist rather than pretending they don't or treating them as invisible.

**What This Means:**
- Settlements are named and discussed
- Settlement residents are real people
- Settlement infrastructure exists
- Operational planning accounts for settlements

### 2. No Legal Position

MCF takes no position on settlement legality. It neither legitimizes nor delegitimizes settlements through its operations.

**What This Means:**
- No MCF statement on legality
- International law positions preserved
- No endorsement of sovereignty claims
- No foreclosure of future removal

### 3. Operational Pragmatism

MCF operates in a world where settlements exist, regardless of their legal status.

**What This Means:**
- Security incidents involving settlements documented
- Movement between areas accounted for
- Economic interactions addressed
- Civilian protection applies to all civilians

### 4. Future Resolution Non-Foreclosure

Nothing in MCF forecloses any future settlement resolution—removal, annexation, land swaps, or other outcomes.

**What This Means:**
- MCF participation doesn't validate settlements
- MCF operations don't create permanence claims
- All political outcomes remain possible
- Framework adapts to whatever parties agree

---

## Legal Position

### 1. International Law Context

**International Consensus:**
- UN Security Council Resolution 2334 (2016): Settlements have "no legal validity"
- Fourth Geneva Convention Article 49: Prohibits transfer of civilian population into occupied territory
- ICJ Advisory Opinion (2004): Settlements violate international law
- Most states do not recognize Israeli sovereignty over settlements

**Israeli Position:**
- Disputes applicability of Fourth Geneva Convention
- Claims historical and legal rights to territory
- Some settlements authorized by Israeli law
- Political spectrum ranges from annexation to evacuation

### 2. MCF Non-Determination

**MCF Does Not:**
- Declare settlements legal or illegal
- Endorse any state's position
- Apply international humanitarian law determinations
- Adjudicate sovereignty

**MCF Does:**
- Operate in factual reality
- Protect all civilians as civilians
- Document incidents without legal characterization
- Preserve all parties' legal positions

### 3. Language Standards

**MCF Uses:**
- "Settlements" (factual term)
- "Settlement residents" (factual term)
- Geographic coordinates and names
- Neutral descriptive language

**MCF Avoids:**
- "Illegal settlements" (legal determination)
- "Jewish communities" (political framing)
- "Liberated territories" (political framing)
- "Occupied territories" (uses without legal determination)

## Operational Treatment by Phase

### Phase 0: Verification and Documentation

**JSVC/UVB Coverage:**
- Incidents in, near, or involving settlements are documented
- Verification applies to all areas, including settlements
- No sovereignty determination in verification
- Factual documentation only

**What Is Documented:**
- Violence involving settlers or Palestinians
- Settlement expansion activities
- Access and movement restrictions
- Security force actions

**Documentation Limitations:**
- Factual record, not legal adjudication
- No determination of lawfulness
- Incident-focused, not policy-focused
- Pattern identification without legal characterization

**Protected Civic Corridors:**
- PCCs may transit near settlements where necessary
- Settlement areas not PCC destinations
- Emergency routes may cross settlement areas
- Coordination with relevant security forces

### Phase 1: Civic Membership

**Settler CMS Eligibility:**
- Settlement residents eligible for CMS on same basis as others
- Individual conduct standards apply equally
- No categorical exclusion based on residence location
- No categorical inclusion based on residence location

**Eligibility Requirements:**
- Personal conduct code acceptance
- CRC commitment
- No security disqualifications
- Voluntary participation

**What CMS Provides Settlers:**
- Framework benefit access
- Credential portability
- Arbitration access
- Economic program participation

**What CMS Does Not Provide:**
- Validation of settlement legality
- Enhanced security status
- Claims to territory through MCF
- Protection from future political outcomes

**Vetting Considerations:**
- Settlement residence not automatic disqualification
- Violent activity is disqualifying (as for anyone)
- Settler violence history reviewed
- Same standards as Palestinian applicants

### Phase 2: SAZ Relationship

**SAZ Site Selection:**
- Settlements explicitly excluded as SAZ sites
- Settlement areas not candidates for MCF territorial governance
- Proximity to settlements considered in site selection
- SAZ boundaries avoid settlement friction

**Why Settlements Excluded:**
- Would constitute implicit legitimization
- Security complexity unmanageable
- Palestinian participation impossible
- Framework credibility destroyed

**Proximity Considerations:**
- SAZ sites selected to minimize settlement friction
- Buffer zones where appropriate
- Access routes avoid settlement transit where possible
- Security coordination required regardless

## Settler Participation

### 1. Individual Participation Framework

**Basic Principle:**
Settlers are individuals who can participate in MCF based on personal conduct, not based on where they live.

**Participation Means:**
- Access to CMS (if eligible)
- Access to arbitration
- Credential portability
- Economic program participation

**Participation Does Not Mean:**
- Settlement legitimization
- Territorial rights through MCF
- Enhanced legal status
- Protection from political outcomes

### 2. Conduct Standards

**Same Standards Apply:**
- Non-violence commitment
- CRC acceptance
- Procedural compliance
- Good faith participation

**Disqualifying Conduct:**
- Violence against Palestinians
- Property destruction
- Intimidation activities
- Spoiler actions against MCF

**Settler-Specific Risks:**
- "Price tag" violence participation
- Harassment of Palestinians
- Obstruction of Palestinian movement
- Settlement expansion enforcement

### 3. Benefit Parity

**Equal Benefits:**
- If eligible, settlers receive same benefits as other participants
- No enhanced benefits based on location
- No reduced benefits based on location
- Individual merit basis

**Benefit Limitations:**
- Benefits tied to MCF programs, not settlement status
- No territorial implications
- No sovereignty claims
- No permanent residence rights through MCF

### 4. Participation Complexity

**Challenges:**
- Palestinian perception of legitimization
- Settler perception of delegitimization
- Security coordination complexity
- Political sensitivity

**Mitigation:**
- Clear non-legitimization language
- Equal treatment documentation
- Transparent criteria application
- Separate from political track

## Settlement Expansion

### 1. MCF Position on Expansion

**MCF Does Not:**
- Endorse settlement expansion
- Oppose settlement expansion (as MCF)
- Monitor expansion as MCF mandate
- Condition MCF on expansion freeze

**MCF Does:**
- Document expansion when relevant to verification
- Note expansion effects on civilian population
- Account for expansion in operational planning
- Preserve expansion as political question

### 2. Why MCF Doesn't Address Expansion Directly

**Practical Reasons:**
- Expansion freeze demands have paralyzed past negotiations
- MCF would become hostage to expansion politics
- Neither party would accept MCF authority over expansion
- Focus is conflict management, not political resolution

**Principled Reasons:**
- Expansion is political question for political track
- MCF operates in current reality, doesn't determine future
- International community addresses expansion through other mechanisms
- MCF non-prejudice requires not taking sides

### 3. Operational Implications of Expansion

**What MCF Accounts For:**
- New settlement areas in verification coverage
- Changed access routes
- Modified security dynamics
- Updated population data

**What MCF Does Not Do:**
- Validate new expansion
- Oppose new expansion
- Provide services to new expansion
- Include new expansion in SAZ planning

### 4. Documentation Without Endorsement

**Verification Documents:**
- Construction activity (factual)
- Land changes (factual)
- Access modifications (factual)
- Population movements (factual)

**Documentation Avoids:**
- Legality determinations
- Policy recommendations
- Political characterizations
- Advocacy positions

---

## Settler Violence

### 1. Documentation and Response

**Settler Violence Documented:**
- Attacks on Palestinians
- Property destruction
- Agricultural damage (olive trees, etc.)
- Intimidation and harassment

**Documentation Standards:**
- Same evidentiary standards as other violence
- Attribution based on evidence
- Pattern identification
- Impact assessment

### 2. MCF Response Mechanisms

**For CMS Participants:**
- Violent conduct grounds for revocation
- Pattern of violence disqualifying
- CRC violations addressed
- Accountability through MCF mechanisms

**For Non-Participants:**
- Documentation and referral
- International accountability
- Guarantor attention
- External mechanisms

### 3. Symmetry Principle

**Equal Documentation:**
- Palestinian violence against settlers equally documented
- Same standards apply
- Same response mechanisms
- No asymmetric treatment

**Recognition:**
Violence occurs from multiple directions. MCF documents all without political characterization.

## Future Resolution Interface

### 1. Resolution Scenarios

**Possible Outcomes (Not MCF Determination):**
- Settlement removal (two-state)
- Settlement annexation with land swaps
- Settlement integration under Palestinian sovereignty
- Continued status quo
- Other negotiated outcomes

**MCF Neutral On:**
- Which outcome is preferable
- Which outcome is likely
- Which outcome is just
- Timeline for resolution

### 2. MCF Contribution to Resolution

**MCF Can Provide:**
- Reduced violence environment for negotiations
- Demonstrated coexistence (through CMS)
- Trust-building experience
- Operational precedents

**MCF Cannot Provide:**
- Settlement determination
- Territorial boundaries
- Sovereignty resolution
- Political outcome

### 3. Phase 3 Implications

**If Political Resolution Achieved:**
- MCF adapts to agreed outcome
- Settlement residents transition as agreed
- Framework supports implementation
- Only at parties' request

**MCF Flexibility:**
- Framework designed for multiple outcomes
- No built-in assumption about settlement future
- Adaptable to party agreements
- Supports whatever parties decide

### 4. Transition Support

**If Resolution Requires Settlement Changes:**
- MCF could support orderly transition
- Population movement management
- Economic transition support
- Only at parties' explicit request

**MCF Is Not:**
- Mechanism for forced removal
- Mechanism for forced integration
- Predetermined outcome vehicle
- Substitute for political agreement

---

## Non-Prejudice Implementation

### 1. Document Language

**All MCF Documents:**
- Use neutral settlement terminology
- Include non-prejudice statements
- Avoid legal characterizations
- Preserve all parties' positions

**Standard Language:**
> "MCF operations involving settlements do not constitute endorsement or rejection of any legal position regarding settlements. All parties' positions on settlement legality, permanence, and future status remain entirely unaffected."

### 2. Operational Boundaries

**MCF Does Not:**
- Provide settlement governance
- Validate settlement boundaries
- Recognize settlement municipal authority
- Integrate settlements into MCF territorial structures

**MCF Does:**
- Protect settlers as civilians
- Document incidents involving settlements
- Allow individual settler participation
- Account for settlements in operations

### 3. Communication Standards

**Public Communication:**
- Factual references to settlements
- No legal characterizations
- No political advocacy
- Balanced treatment

**Avoid:**
- Statements implying legitimacy
- Statements implying illegitimacy
- Political framing
- Advocacy positions

- Clear jurisdictional limits
- Resistance to political capture
- Balanced documentation

### 4. Operational Complexity

**Risk:**
Settlement geography creates operational complications.

**Mitigation:**
- Careful route planning
- Security coordination
- Flexible procedures
- Reality-based operations
