# Refugees and Diaspora: Structured Postponement

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#refugees-and-diaspora-structured-postponement)

**Phase:** All Phases

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## Purpose

Refugees and Diaspora defines MCF's approach to Palestinian refugee and diaspora questions through **structured postponement**—explicitly deferring resolution while preserving all claims and allowing limited, non-territorial participation.

MCF does not attempt to resolve the Palestinian refugee issue or the right of return. Instead, it separates present-day conflict management from future political resolution, on the premise that unmanaged violence today makes just outcomes tomorrow less likely.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Explicit Deferral with Non-Preclusion

Nothing in MCF forecloses future refugee claims. Nothing in MCF operationalizes those claims in early or mid phases.

**What This Means:**
- Right of return remains a political question
- Compensation claims preserved
- Restitution options unaffected
- Future negotiation space maintained

### 2. Separation of Tracks

Refugee questions are intentionally separated from in-territory conflict management.

**What This Means:**
- MCF focuses on current violence reduction
- Refugee resolution is a separate political track
- Neither track hostage to the other
- Progress possible on both independently

### 3. Limited Participation Without Territorial Rights

Refugees can participate in MCF in limited ways without that participation conferring territorial rights.

**What This Means:**
- Non-residential program access possible
- Credential portability available
- Institutional participation permitted
- No residency or return rights through MCF

### 4. Avoiding Two Errors

MCF avoids treating refugees as irrelevant (delegitimizing) and treating CMS as backdoor return (destabilizing).

**What This Means:**
- Refugees acknowledged as part of conflict
- Limited participation available
- Clear limits on what participation means
- Balance between inclusion and stability

## CMS Eligibility Framework

### 1. General Principle

Palestinian refugees are **not categorically excluded** from CMS, but eligibility is **functionally constrained and phased**.

### 2. Initial Phase Eligibility

**Phase 0-1:**
- CMS primarily for in-territory participants
- Limited refugee eligibility
- Focus on stable populations
- Careful expansion

**Refugee Eligibility (Limited):**
- Professional credentialing participation
- Arbitration access (for relevant disputes)
- Training programs
- Institutional roles in external SAZs

### 3. What CMS Provides Refugees

**Available:**
- Framework benefit access (non-residential)
- Credential portability
- Arbitration access
- Professional development
- Institutional participation (outside Israel/Palestine)

**Not Available:**
- Residency rights in Israel
- Residency rights in Palestinian territories (through MCF)
- Return mechanism
- Territorial claims

### 4. What CMS Does Not Alter

**Unchanged:**
- Refugee legal status under UNRWA
- Host-country legal status
- International law rights
- Political claims

**Explicit Statement Required:**
> "CMS participation by refugees does not prejudice, satisfy, waive, or adjudicate claims related to return, compensation, or restitution."

---

## Non-Preclusion Guarantees

### 1. Claim Preservation

**MCF Explicitly Preserves:**
- Right of return claims
- Compensation claims
- Restitution claims
- All legal positions

**Mechanism:**

- No MCF authority over refugee questions
- Deferred to political track

### 2. No Implicit Resolution

**MCF Does Not:**
- Constitute a mechanism of return
- Substitute for return rights
- Provide alternative to return
- Satisfy return claims

**MCF Does Not:**
- Deny return rights
- Foreclose return options
- Create precedent against return
- Prejudice negotiations

### 3. Future Political Process

**Refugee Resolution Requires:**
- Political negotiation between parties
- International support and facilitation
- Comprehensive agreement
- Separate from MCF

**MCF Role:**
- Provides stability for negotiations
- Does not determine outcome
- Supports whatever parties agree
- Preserves all options

---

## Phased Expansion

### 1. Phase 0-1: Minimal Engagement

**Focus:**
- In-territory conflict management
- Limited refugee participation
- Non-territorial benefits only
- Careful eligibility screening

**Eligible Activities:**
- Professional credentialing
- Training programs
- External SAZ participation
- Arbitration (limited)

### 2. Phase 2: Expanded Access

**If Stability Achieved:**
- Broader credential portability
- More training access
- Economic program participation
- Institutional roles expansion

**Still Limited:**
- No residential rights
- No territorial claims
- No return mechanism

### 3. Phase 3+: Political Track Convergence

**If Political Progress:**
- MCF could support implementation of agreements
- Refugee return management (if agreed)
- Integration support (if agreed)
- Only at parties' explicit request

**MCF Alone Cannot:**
- Create return mechanism
- Determine refugee outcomes
- Override political negotiations

## Avoiding Destabilization

### 1. No Demographic Manipulation

**MCF Does Not:**
- Encourage refugee movement
- Facilitate demographic changes

**Balance:**
Individual participation available without creating collective demographic dynamics.

### 2. No Political Weaponization

**MCF Does Not:**
- Use refugees as political leverage
- Create refugee-dependent policies
- Make refugees MCF success metric
- Tie MCF progress to refugee resolution

**Independence:**
MCF conflict management success separate from refugee question resolution.

### 3. No False Hopes

**MCF Does Not:**
- Promise return through MCF
- Suggest CMS leads to return
- Create expectation of territorial rights

## Diaspora Engagement

### 1. Non-Residential Participation

**Available:**
- Professional credentialing
- Economic program participation (remote/external)

Engagement that doesn't require physical presence in contested territory.

### 2. External SAZ Participation

**If External SAZ Established:**

**No Permanent Relocation:**
External SAZ is not resettlement mechanism.

### 3. Economic Integration

**Supported:**

---

## Institutional Safeguards

### 1. Eligibility Screening

**Screening Ensures:**
- Individual meets conduct standards
- No security concerns
- Understanding of CMS limitations
- Voluntary participation

**Not a Barrier:**
Screening is for MCF integrity, not to exclude refugees categorically.

### 2. Clear Terms

**CMS Terms for Refugees:**

- Claim preservation acknowledgment
- Limitation acceptance
- Voluntary participation confirmation

### 3. Monitoring

**Monitor For:**
- Misuse of CMS for territorial claims
- False promises about return
- Political manipulation
- Expectation management failure

---

## Future Political Constituency

### 1. Long-Term Vision

MCF treats refugees as a **future political constituency**, not an early operational driver.

**What This Means:**
- Refugee voice matters for political resolution
- Political negotiations will address refugees
- MCF doesn't substitute for that voice
- Inclusion is goal, timing is strategic

### 2. Incremental Inclusion

**Inclusion Is:**
- Incremental (phased)
- Optional (voluntary)
- Non-territorial (no residency rights)
- Expandable (as conditions permit)

### 3. Conditions for Expansion

**Expansion When:**
- In-territory stability demonstrated
- Political track active
- Host countries engaged
- Security concerns manageable

**Expansion Not:**
- Automatic
- Guaranteed
- MCF-determined alone
