# Sensitive Issues: Overview

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md)

**Applies To:** All Phases

**Objective:** Establish principled approaches to the most politically sensitive dimensions of the conflict—water, Jerusalem, religious sites, refugees, and settlements—that allow MCF to function without resolving these final-status questions.

---

## Purpose of This Section

This directory contains detailed implementation documents for MCF's approach to sensitive issues that cannot be resolved through technocratic governance alone.

The fundamental design principle is **structured deferral with non-preclusion**: MCF neither resolves nor precludes resolution of these issues. It creates operational arrangements that allow conflict management to proceed while preserving all parties' claims intact.

## Why These Issues Are Treated Separately

### 1. Final-Status Character

Each of these issues is a recognized **final-status question** in Israeli-Palestinian diplomacy:
- Water allocation ratios and aquifer sovereignty
- Jerusalem sovereignty and governance
- Religious site control and access
- Refugee return, compensation, and resettlement
- Settlement permanence, removal, or integration

MCF cannot resolve these issues without becoming a de facto political negotiation that would collapse under the weight of competing claims.

### 2. Escalation Potential

Each issue has demonstrated capacity to **trigger large-scale violence**:
- Water shutoffs during crises
- Jerusalem provocations (Temple Mount/Al-Aqsa)
- Religious site flashpoints (Hebron, Joseph's Tomb)
- Demographic fears around return

MCF must prevent these issues from becoming operational triggers while avoiding implicit resolution.

### 3. Symbolic Weight

Each issue carries **symbolic significance** beyond its practical dimensions:
- Water as existential resource and occupation symbol
- Jerusalem as religious and national capital
- Holy sites as sacred heritage
- Refugees as displacement memory and identity

Technical solutions alone cannot address symbolic dimensions without risking delegitimization.

## Core Principles for Sensitive Issues

### 1. Non-Preclusion

Nothing in MCF forecloses future resolution of any sensitive issue. All parties' positions, claims, and rights remain intact regardless of MCF participation.

**Implementation:**
- Explicit non-prejudice language in all documents
- Prohibition on using MCF proceedings to establish claims
- Preservation of external legal and political options
- Clear statement that MCF is not final-status resolution

### 2. Operational Deconfliction

MCF addresses operational aspects of sensitive issues—preventing immediate harm, protecting civilian access, maintaining life-critical systems—without addressing underlying political questions.

**Implementation:**
- Protected Civic Corridors for life-critical infrastructure
- Emergency access provisions
- Incident documentation without adjudication
- Harm prevention without sovereignty claims

### 3. Individual Participation Without Collective Resolution

Individuals from affected populations can participate in MCF without that participation resolving collective questions.

**Implementation:**
- CMS eligibility independent of final-status positions
- Individual benefits without territorial implications
- Participation does not waive or satisfy claims
- Voluntary, non-coerced engagement

### 4. Phased Approach

Sensitive issues are addressed incrementally as trust develops, with more ambitious arrangements deferred to later phases.

**Implementation:**
- Phase 0-1: Minimal intervention, deconfliction only
- Phase 2: Expanded operational cooperation
- Phase 3+: Procedural review mechanisms if stability permits
- No automatic progression; stability-dependent

### 5. Containment Over Integration

Where issues are too sensitive for any MCF involvement, they are explicitly excluded and insulated from Framework operations.

**Implementation:**
- Jerusalem excluded from SAZ consideration
- Religious site governance unchanged
- No MCF adjudication of sovereignty
- Clear boundaries around Framework authority

## Common Challenges

### 1. Accusation of Normalization

**Risk:** MCF operational arrangements may be attacked as normalizing occupation or unjust status quo.

**Response:**
- Explicit non-normalization statements
- Preservation of all legal claims
- No endorsement of current arrangements
- Focus on civilian protection, not political legitimation

### 2. Accusation of Backdoor Resolution

**Risk:** MCF may be attacked as secretly resolving final-status issues through administrative means.

**Response:**
- Explicit deferral statements
- No MCF authority over final-status questions
- Clear jurisdictional boundaries
- Political questions reserved for political processes

### 3. Operational Pressure Weaponization

**Risk:** Parties may use sensitive issues to pressure MCF or other parties.

**Response:**
- Clear escalation triggers and responses
- Guarantor involvement
- Documentation and accountability
- Resistance to coercion

### 4. Precedent Fears

**Risk:** Parties may fear that operational arrangements create precedents for final resolution.

**Response:**
- Explicit non-precedent language
- Temporary, reversible arrangements
- No implications for final status
- Arrangements can be unwound

## Relationship to Other Components

### Verification (JSVC/UVB)
- Verification bodies document incidents at sensitive sites
- No adjudication of underlying claims
- Factual record for accountability
- Escalation prevention focus

### Protected Civic Corridors
- Limited application to sensitive areas
- Life-critical systems only
- No routine governance
- Emergency deconfliction

### Civic Membership System
- Individual participation regardless of sensitive issue positions
- CMS does not resolve collective questions
- Benefits portable across boundaries
- Non-prejudice to claims

### Guarantors
- Monitor sensitive issue flashpoints
- Respond to escalation
- Support operational deconfliction
- No sovereignty adjudication role

### Dispute Resolution
- Sensitive issues excluded from adjudication
- Non-prejudice rule applies absolutely
- Individual disputes separated from collective questions
- Documentation without resolution

## Design Rationale

### Why Not Resolve These Issues First?

Historical experience demonstrates that conditioning conflict management on resolution of these issues produces:
- Perpetual paralysis
- Continued violence
- No progress on any dimension
- Deteriorating conditions for eventual resolution

MCF operates on the premise that reducing violence today creates better conditions for resolution tomorrow.

### Why Not Ignore These Issues?

Ignoring sensitive issues would:
- Undermine legitimacy with affected populations
- Create operational gaps at flashpoints
- Allow escalation without response capacity
- Pretend these issues don't affect daily operations

MCF addresses operational dimensions while deferring political resolution.

### Why Not Let Parties Resolve Bilaterally?

Bilateral resolution has failed for decades. MCF provides:
- Operational stability while political talks continue (or don't)
- Third-party verification and documentation
- Reduced pressure to resolve everything before anything
- Incremental trust-building
