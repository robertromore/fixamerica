# Post-Conflict Justice Interface

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md)

**Phase:** All Phases

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## Purpose

Post-Conflict Justice Interface defines MCF's relationship with **accountability and reconciliation mechanisms**—truth commissions, criminal tribunals, reparations programs, and memorialization—that may address historical and ongoing harms.

MCF does not establish or operate transitional justice mechanisms. It is a conflict management framework, not a justice framework. However, MCF must interface with justice processes without obstructing them or being destabilized by them.

---

## Design Principles

### 1. Non-Obstruction

MCF does not obstruct justice processes, whether national, international, or transitional.

**What This Means:**

- Evidence preserved, not destroyed
- Witnesses not silenced
- Accountability not impeded
- Documentation available

### 2. Non-Substitution

MCF is not a substitute for justice. Participation in MCF does not satisfy accountability requirements.

**What This Means:**

- MCF participation not amnesty
- CMS does not immunize
- MCF proceedings not justice proceedings
- Accountability remains external

### 3. Operational Separation

MCF operations are separated from justice processes to prevent politicization of either.

**What This Means:**

- MCF does not conduct criminal investigations
- MCF does not adjudicate war crimes
- Justice processes do not control MCF participation
- Parallel tracks, not integrated

### 4. Future Facilitation

MCF preserves options for future justice processes without establishing them.

**What This Means:**

- Documentation preserved
- Testimony not foreclosed
- Options not prejudiced
- Support available if requested
