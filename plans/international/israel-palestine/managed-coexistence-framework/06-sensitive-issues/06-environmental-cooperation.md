# Environmental Cooperation

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md)

**Phase:** All Phases

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## Purpose

Environmental Cooperation defines MCF's approach to **shared environmental challenges**—pollution, waste management, conservation, and climate adaptation—that cross political boundaries and require coordination regardless of political status.

Environmental problems do not respect borders. Sewage flows downhill; air pollution drifts; aquifers extend across territories; ecosystems span boundaries. MCF enables operational environmental cooperation without resolving environmental sovereignty questions.

---

## Design Principles

### 1. Operational Coordination, Not Sovereignty Resolution

MCF addresses environmental operations without determining who owns or controls environmental resources.

**What This Means:**

- Pollution response regardless of jurisdiction
- Shared monitoring without territorial claims
- Coordination mechanisms without governance integration
- Technical cooperation without political integration

### 2. Harm Prevention Priority

Environmental harm prevention takes priority over political considerations within MCF's limited scope.

**What This Means:**

- Urgent environmental threats addressed immediately
- No environmental hostage-taking
- Health emergencies prioritize rapid response coordination
- Environmental infrastructure protected

**Voluntary Framework Consistency:** Environmental cooperation remains voluntary per Section "Cooperation Limits." During health emergencies, MCF prioritizes coordination and facilitates rapid response—but cannot compel participation. Parties may withdraw from environmental cooperation with notice; however, withdrawing during an active health emergency would be documented and reported to guarantors.

### 3. Technical Over Political

Environmental cooperation framed technically, not politically, to reduce conflict.

**What This Means:**

- Scientific standards over political standards
- Technical experts lead coordination
- Data-driven decision-making
- Depoliticized operational space

### 4. Non-Preclusion

Environmental cooperation does not prejudice environmental sovereignty claims or future political arrangements.

**What This Means:**

- No ownership determination through cooperation
- All parties' environmental claims preserved
- Future political resolution unaffected
- Cooperation withdrawable (with notice)

- Guarantor observer
- International expert support

**Functions:**

- Data exchange coordination
- Emergency response coordination
- Technical issue resolution
- Cooperation facilitation

**Limitations:**

- No regulatory authority
- No binding decisions on parties
- Technical, not political mandate
- Voluntary participation

### 2. Working Groups

**Potential Working Groups:**

| Topic | Scope |
|-------|-------|
| **Air quality** | Monitoring; alerts; health response |
| **Water quality** | Pollution monitoring; emergency response |
| **Waste management** | Coordination; emergency response |
| **Conservation** | Shared species; habitat coordination |

**Operation:**

### 3. Dispute Resolution

**Environmental Disputes:**

**Individual Complaints:** Environmental complaints from CMS holders (e.g., pollution exposure, health impacts, access to environmental information) follow standard MCF dispute resolution procedures—Review Panel for initial review, then Arbitration if unresolved. The mechanisms above apply to inter-party or institutional environmental disputes, not individual grievances.

**Limitations:**

- No environmental sovereignty adjudication
- No resource allocation determination
- Operational issues only
- Political issues excluded
