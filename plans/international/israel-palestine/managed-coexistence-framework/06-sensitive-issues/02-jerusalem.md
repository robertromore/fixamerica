# Jerusalem: Special Exclusion with Individual Participation

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#jerusalem-special-exclusion-with-individual-participation)

**Phase:** All Phases

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## Purpose

Jerusalem: Special Exclusion with Individual Participation defines MCF's approach to the most sensitive location in the conflict—treating Jerusalem as **procedurally exceptional** while allowing Jerusalem residents to participate in MCF programs.

Jerusalem is explicitly excluded from SAZ consideration in Phases 0-2. This exclusion is not an oversight but a deliberate stabilizing choice: any attempt to pilot shared governance, international administration, or territorial experimentation in Jerusalem would instantly collapse the framework.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Explicit Territorial Exclusion

Jerusalem is **not** subject to MCF territorial governance mechanisms:
- No SAZ in Jerusalem
- No MCF administrative authority
- No governance experiments
- No sovereignty adjudication

### 2. Individual Participation Permitted

Jerusalem residents can participate in MCF as individuals:
- CMS eligibility available
- Framework benefits accessible
- Arbitration available
- Credential portability applies

### 3. Non-Prejudice Absolute

MCF involvement has zero implications for Jerusalem's final status:
- No recognition of any sovereignty claim
- No endorsement of current arrangements
- No precedent for future resolution
- All parties' positions preserved

### 4. Asymmetric Design

This creates an intentional asymmetry:
- Residents can participate individually
- Territory is excluded from governance
- Human rights without territorial implications
- Participation without status determination

---

## Exclusion Scope

### 1. What Is Excluded

**Territorial Governance:**
- SAZ establishment in any part of Jerusalem
- MCF administrative authority
- Shared governance experiments
- International administration

**Sovereignty Adjudication:**
- Determination of Jerusalem sovereignty
- Recognition of municipal authority
- Endorsement of boundary claims
- Final status prejudice

**Symbolic Interventions:**
- Status quo changes at holy sites
- Governance restructuring
- New institutional arrangements
- Political statements on Jerusalem

### 2. What Is Not Excluded

**Individual Rights:**
- CMS eligibility for Jerusalem residents
- Access to Framework benefits
- Arbitration availability
- Credential portability

**Operational Coordination (coordination and documentation only—no MCF personnel deployment or operational authority):**
- Emergency humanitarian response (coordination with existing authorities)
- Life-critical infrastructure protection (coordination and external-source documentation only)
- Incident documentation (from external sources, not direct monitoring)
- Medical evacuation coordination (if needed)

**External Activities:**
- Jerusalem residents participating in institutions outside Jerusalem
- Training programs
- Professional credentialing
- Arbitration proceedings (held outside Jerusalem)

### 3. Geographic Scope

**Excluded Territory:**
- Municipal Jerusalem (Israeli-defined)
- Areas claimed as East Jerusalem
- Holy Basin/Old City
- Adjacent contested areas

**Note:** The geographic scope of exclusion does not constitute MCF recognition of any boundary claims.

## East Jerusalem Residents

### 1. Legal Status Context

**Current Situation:**
- East Jerusalem annexed by Israel (not internationally recognized)
- Palestinian residents have permanent residency, not citizenship
- Residency can be revoked
- Limited political rights
- Access to Israeli social services

**MCF Does Not Change:**
- Residency status
- Citizenship claims
- Municipal authority
- Political rights under Israeli law

### 2. CMS Eligibility

**Eligibility:**
- East Jerusalem Palestinian residents eligible for CMS
- Same criteria as any other applicant
- Personal conduct standards
- CRC acceptance

**What CMS Provides:**
- Framework benefit access
- Credential portability
- Arbitration access
- Participation in institutions outside Jerusalem

**What CMS Does Not Provide:**
- Special status in Jerusalem
- Access privileges to restricted areas
- Security exemptions
- Municipal authority changes

### 3. Voluntary Participation

**Opt-In Character:**
- Participation entirely voluntary
- No pressure to participate
- No disadvantage from non-participation
- Individual choice respected

**Non-Coercion:**
- No employment requirements tied to CMS
- No service access requirements
- No legal consequences for non-participation

## Avoiding Normalization and Exclusion Traps

### 1. The Normalization Risk

**Concern:**
MCF participation might be seen as legitimizing Israeli control of East Jerusalem or the occupation more broadly.

**Safeguards:**
- Explicit non-recognition statements
- No MCF endorsement of current arrangements
- Preservation of all legal claims
- Participation does not constitute acceptance

**Language:**
Explicit in all documents:
> "Participation in MCF by Jerusalem residents does not constitute recognition of any sovereignty claim over Jerusalem, acceptance of current governance arrangements, or prejudice to final status negotiations."

### 2. The Exclusion Risk

**Concern:**
Excluding Jerusalem residents from MCF would punish them for political circumstances beyond their control and undermine MCF legitimacy.

**Safeguards:**
- Individual participation permitted
- Benefits available to eligible residents
- No collective punishment for location
- Human dimension separated from territorial

**Balance:**
MCF threads the needle by allowing individual participation while excluding territorial governance.

### 3. The Precedent Risk

**Concern:**
Any MCF involvement in Jerusalem might create precedents for final status resolution.

**Safeguards:**
- Explicit non-precedent statements
- No MCF authority over Jerusalem territory
- Temporary, reversible individual arrangements
- Clear separation from political negotiations

## CMS Participation Details

### 1. What CMS Holders in Jerusalem Can Do

**Within MCF Framework:**

### 2. What CMS Holders Cannot Use CMS For

**Prohibited Uses:**
- Claims to special status in Jerusalem
- Challenges to Jerusalem governance within MCF

- Medical emergency response support
- Documentation of humanitarian situations
- Communication facilitation

**Limited:**

- No independent MCF action in Jerusalem
- No MCF personnel deployment (per Section "Operational Boundaries")
- Coordination role only—MCF facilitates communication between existing authorities
- Deference to existing mechanisms

### 2. Incident Documentation

**JSVC/UVB Role:**
- Document incidents in Jerusalem (from accessible sources)
- No operational authority in Jerusalem
- Information preservation
- Patterns analysis

**Limitations:**

- No enforcement capacity

### 3. Holy Sites

**Explicit Exclusion:**

## Future Considerations

### 1. Phase Progression

**Phases 0-2:**
- Jerusalem exclusion maintained
- Individual participation continues
- No territorial governance

**Phase 3+:**
- Review possible if parties agree
- Any change requires explicit political agreement
- MCF alone cannot alter Jerusalem exclusion
- External negotiation required

### 2. Political Track

**MCF Does Not:**
- Negotiate Jerusalem status
- Propose Jerusalem solutions
- Mediate Jerusalem disputes
- Prejudice Jerusalem negotiations

**MCF Does:**
- Preserve all parties' positions
- Document conditions
- Support individuals regardless of location
- Remain available if parties request

### 3. Scenario Planning

**If Political Agreement:**
- MCF could potentially support implementation
- Only at parties' explicit request
- Framework adaptation required
- Separate authorization needed

**If Continued Impasse:**
- Jerusalem exclusion continues
- Individual participation continues
- No MCF deterioration from Jerusalem situation
- Stability maintained in other areas

---

## Implementation Safeguards

### 1. Language Standards

**All Documents Must:**
- Include Jerusalem non-prejudice statement
- Specify Jerusalem exclusion where relevant
- Avoid implied recognition
- Maintain neutral terminology

**Standard Language:**
> "This document does not apply to Jerusalem, which is explicitly excluded from MCF territorial governance mechanisms. Individual Jerusalem residents may participate in MCF programs on the same basis as other eligible participants, without prejudice to the status of Jerusalem."

### 2. Operational Boundaries

**Clear Lines:**
- No MCF personnel deployment to Jerusalem
- No MCF facilities in Jerusalem
- No MCF-branded activities in Jerusalem
- Participation occurs outside Jerusalem

**Exceptions:**
- Emergency humanitarian coordination (limited)
- Transit through Jerusalem (practical necessity)
- Individual participant residence (their choice)

### 3. Political Sensitivity

**Awareness Required:**
- Staff training on Jerusalem sensitivity
- Clear escalation for Jerusalem-related issues
- Consultation before any Jerusalem-adjacent decisions
- Conservative approach to ambiguity
