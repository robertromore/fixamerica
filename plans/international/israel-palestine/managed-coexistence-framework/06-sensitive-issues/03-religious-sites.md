# Religious Sites Beyond Jerusalem: Containment Without Integration

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#religious-sites-beyond-jerusalem-containment-without-integration)

**Phase:** All Phases

**Status:** Draft

---

## Purpose

Religious Sites Beyond Jerusalem defines MCF's approach to religious flashpoints outside Jerusalem—such as Cave of the Patriarchs, Rachel's Tomb, and Joseph's Tomb—treating them as **escalation amplifiers that must be insulated, not integrated**.

Unlike Jerusalem, these sites are not deferred wholesale from the Framework. Instead, they are governed under a **containment-without-integration doctrine**: MCF stabilizes the perimeter while refusing to touch the core political and theological disputes that make these sites combustible.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Insulation Over Integration

MCF explicitly avoids introducing new governance arrangements, shared administration, or symbolic reforms at these locations. Any perceived alteration to control, access, or status quo would almost certainly trigger escalation.

### 2. Operational Deconfliction, Not Governance Reform

MCF's role at these sites is limited to operational deconfliction and harm prevention, not governance reform. Existing control regimes remain in place.

### 3. Protecting People, Not Restructuring Control

MCF protects individuals—residents, workers, pilgrims—without using that protection to advance governance changes.

### 4. Verification Without Adjudication

Verification mechanisms document incidents without adjudicating sanctity, rights, or legitimate control.

---

## Containment Approach

### 1. No Governance Changes

**MCF Does Not:**
- Propose new administrative arrangements
- Suggest shared governance models
- Recommend access changes
- Advocate for control transfers

**Rationale:**
Any perceived change to status quo at these sites would:
- Be seen as precedent for sovereignty
- Trigger defensive reactions from both communities
- Risk immediate escalation
- Undermine MCF credibility

### 2. No Symbolic Reforms

**MCF Does Not:**
- Propose renaming or terminology changes
- Suggest ritual modifications
- Advocate for worship arrangements
- Address religious claims

**Rationale:**
Symbolic interventions carry theological weight that MCF cannot manage and would politicize the framework.

### 3. Perimeter Stabilization

**MCF Does:**
- Support deconfliction in surrounding areas
- Facilitate emergency response
- Document incidents
- Maintain communication channels

**Focus:**
Preventing violence that begins at these sites from spreading, without addressing the sites themselves.

---

## Protected Civic Corridor Application

### 1. Extremely Limited Application

**PCCs Apply Only For:**
- Time-bound emergency medical access
- Utility repair access
- Civilian evacuation routes during tensions
- Emergency humanitarian response

**PCCs Do Not Apply For:**
- Routine access control
- Worship scheduling
- Security arrangements
- Pilgrimage facilitation

### 2. Emergency-Only Character

**PCC Activation:**
- Genuine emergency required
- Time-limited
- Specific route/purpose
- Coordinated with existing security

**Not Routine:**
PCCs cannot become routine mechanisms that effectively alter access arrangements.

### 3. Coordination Requirements

**Emergency PCCs Require:**
- Notification to relevant authorities
- Coordination with security forces
- Clear termination point
- Documentation

---

## Verification Mechanisms

### 1. Heightened Documentation

**Documentation Focus:**
- Incidents at or near these sites
- Use of force
- Access restrictions
- Provocations
- Damage to property

**Heightened Because:**
- Known escalation potential
- Pattern importance
- International interest
- Accountability needs

### 2. Verification Purpose

**Purpose Is:**
- Establish clear factual record
- Prevent narrative weaponization
- Feed escalation management
- Support external accountability

**Purpose Is Not:**
- Adjudicate sanctity claims
- Determine legitimate control
- Resolve access disputes
- Propose governance changes

### 3. Information Flow

**Verification Feeds:**
- MCF escalation management
- Rollback trigger assessment
- Guarantor notification
- External documentation

**Verification Does Not Feed:**
- Local policy changes
- Governance recommendations
- Access modifications

---

## Individual Participation

### 1. CMS Eligibility

**Eligible (if they meet standard CMS criteria per [CMS Framework](../02-phase-1-civic-membership/01-cms-framework.md#21-basic-eligibility)):**
- Residents near religious sites
- Workers at religious sites (if resident or recognized diaspora)
- Religious officials (if resident or recognized diaspora; personally, not institutionally)

**Not Separately Eligible:**
- Pilgrims who do not meet residency or recognized diaspora criteria
- Religious officials from outside MCF operational area
- Visitors whose sole connection is pilgrimage

**Clarification:** CMS eligibility requires residence within MCF operational area (standard CMS) OR membership in recognized diaspora population (CMS-D per [CMS Framework Section 2.9](../02-phase-1-civic-membership/01-cms-framework.md#29-diaspora-eligibility)). Location near or connection to religious sites does not create independent eligibility. Pilgrims and religious officials from outside these categories access sites through existing arrangements (visas, religious access protocols), not through CMS.

**Same Basis:**
CMS eligibility based on residency/diaspora status and personal conduct standards, not religious role or site connection.

### 2. What CMS Does Not Confer

**No Special Rights:**
- No special access to religious sites
- No security privileges at sites
- No standing regarding site control
- No claims regarding site governance

**Prohibition:**
Any attempt to use CMS to advance claims over holy places is grounds for revocation. This applies symmetrically to all communities.

### 3. Individual Protection

**CMS Provides:**
- General CRC protections (not site-specific)
- Access to arbitration (for non-site disputes)
- Credential portability
- Framework benefits

**Protection Limits:**
CMS does not provide special protection at religious sites beyond general CRC standards.

## Escalation Prevention

### 1. Early Warning

**Monitoring:**
- Tension indicators tracked
- Holiday/anniversary awareness
- Political event correlation
- Social media monitoring

**Notification:**
- MCF internal notification

- Order access changes
- Impose solutions
- Override existing authorities

### 3. Post-Incident Response

**After Incidents:**
- Rapid verification
- Documentation
- Escalation assessment
- Support for humanitarian response

**Focus:**
Preventing incidents from triggering broader violence.

- Settler-Palestinian tensions: Verification focus
- Military presence: Coordinated deconfliction

**Particular Challenges:**
- Integrated urban environment
- Civilian population on both sides
- Daily friction potential
- International attention

### 2. Rachel's Tomb

**Approach:**
- Barrier area: Not MCF focus
- Site access: No MCF role
- Adjacent Bethlehem: Potential CMS participation
- Pilgrimage routes: Not PCC subject

**Particular Challenges:**
- Physical separation from surrounding area
- Limited Palestinian access concern
- Symbolic significance

### 3. Joseph's Tomb

**Approach:**
- Worship visits: Not MCF coordinated
- Military escort: No MCF involvement
- Nablus context: Potential CMS participation
- Site protection: Not MCF mandate

**Particular Challenges:**
- Inside PA area
- Coordinated visit system
- Repeated damage history
- Symbolic flashpoint

## Future Considerations

### 1. Phase Progression

**Phases 0-2:**
- Containment approach maintained
- No governance changes
- Individual participation continues
- Verification ongoing

**Phase 3+:**
- Review possible only if parties agree
- Any change requires political agreement
- MCF alone cannot alter approach
- Extremely conservative progression

### 2. Confidence Building

**If Trust Develops:**
- Parties might bilaterally address access
- MCF could potentially support implementation
- Only at parties' explicit request
- Separate from MCF core operations

### 3. Deterioration Scenario

**If Situation Worsens:**
- MCF maintains containment focus
- Verification continues
- Individual participation continues
- Framework insulated from site-specific crises

---

## Implementation Safeguards

### 1. Staff Training

**Training Covers:**
- Religious site sensitivity
- Historical context
- Escalation indicators
- Appropriate responses

**Core Message:**
These sites are explicitly outside MCF governance. Staff avoid any perception of MCF authority over them.

### 2. Communication Standards

**In Communications:**
- Neutral terminology for sites
- No governance language
- No access recommendations
- No control assertions

**Avoid:**
Any statement that could be interpreted as MCF position on site governance.

### 3. Incident Response

**Response Standards:**
- Document factually
- Avoid attribution of rights
- Focus on civilian protection
- Support de-escalation

**Avoid:**
Any response that implies MCF authority or governance role.
