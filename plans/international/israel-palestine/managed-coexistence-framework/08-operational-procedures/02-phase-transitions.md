# Phase Transition Criteria

**Parent Document:** [00-overview.md](00-overview.md)

**Applies To:** Phase boundaries (0→1, 1→2, 2→3)

**Objective:** Define when and how MCF advances between phases, ensuring transitions are evidence-based, procedurally automatic upon certification, and protected from political manipulation.

## 1. Transition Principles

### 1.1 Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Evidence-based** | Transitions require verified achievement of quantitative benchmarks, not impressionistic judgments |
| **Automatic upon certification** | Meeting criteria triggers transition by default; delay requires affirmative override |
| **Non-discretionary** | Certification authority verifies metrics, not whether transition is politically convenient |
| **Asymmetrically protective** | Advancement requires certification; regression is triggered by failure thresholds |
| **Geographic differentiation** | Transitions may occur at different speeds in different territories |

### 1.2 Why Automaticity Matters

If transitions require discretionary approval, they become hostage to political incentives:

| Risk | Consequence |
|------|-------------|
| **Indefinite delay** | Progress blocked regardless of actual stability |
| **Premature advancement** | Political pressure forces transition before conditions warrant |
| **Gaming the system** | Parties manipulate metrics to force preferred outcomes |
| **Legitimacy erosion** | Perceived political control undermines framework credibility |

**Automaticity removes these incentives:** Once thresholds are met for required duration, transition occurs unless a narrowly defined emergency override is invoked.

### 1.3 What Transitions Do and Don't Mean

**Transition signifies:**

- Defined criteria have been met for required duration
- Environment supports next-phase mechanisms
- Framework can safely expand scope

**Transition does NOT signify:**

- Conflict is resolved
- Trust has been established
- Underlying grievances are addressed
- Permanent stability is guaranteed

Success is **provisional, not definitive**. Regression remains possible at all phases.

### 1.4 Relationship to Phase Regression

Transitions and regressions are **procedurally symmetric but substantively asymmetric**:

| Dimension | Advancement | Regression |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Trigger type** | Positive achievement of thresholds | Negative breach of thresholds |
| **Default** | Automatic upon certification | Automatic upon breach confirmation |
| **Override** | Emergency delay possible | Emergency continuation possible |
| **Standard** | Affirmative demonstration required | Presumption of continuation until failure |

See [Phase Regression Protocols](03-phase-regression.md) for regression criteria and procedures.

## 2. Certification Architecture

### 2.1 JSVC as Certification Authority

The JSVC serves as the **certification authority** for phase transitions. This function is embedded in JSVC because:

- JSVC already measures security, incident, and stability metrics
- JSVC has established neutrality and credibility with all parties
- Creating a separate authority would invite legitimacy challenges
- Embedding makes certification feel procedural rather than imposed

See [JSVC Charter Section 8](../01-phase-0-institutions/02-jsvc-charter.md#8-phase-transition-certification-authority) for detailed institutional provisions.

### 2.2 Certification vs. Decision

**Critical distinction:**

| JSVC Certification | JSVC Does NOT |
|--------------------|---------------|
| Measures whether criteria are met | Decide whether transition is desirable |
| Verifies data accuracy | Exercise political judgment |
| Certifies threshold achievement | Negotiate transition terms |
| Triggers automatic processes | Exercise discretionary authority |

The JSVC is a **referee, not a gatekeeper**.

### 2.3 Certification Process

```text
PHASE TRANSITION CERTIFICATION

Step 1: Data Collection (Continuous)
├── JSVC collects metrics per defined methodology
├── Data verified by guarantor observers
├── Metrics published in monthly stability reports
└── Rolling assessment windows maintained

Step 2: Threshold Assessment (Triggered)
├── When preliminary data suggests threshold achievement
├── JSVC initiates formal assessment period
├── 90-day verification window
└── Enhanced data collection and external audit

Step 3: Commission Vote
├── JSVC Commission reviews assessment
├── No discretionary judgment on whether to transition
├── Only verification that criteria accurately measured
├── 5 of 7 vote required to certify

Step 4: Publication and Trigger
├── Certification published with full data
├── 30-day formal notice period*
├── Emergency override window opens
└── Automatic transition at notice period end

*The 30-day formal notice period is the final step in the Phase 0→1 and Phase 1→2 transition process. Per [Communication Protocols Section 9.3](07-communication-protocols.md), transition communication begins earlier: Phase 0→1 requires 60 days advance notice + 30 days consultation; Phase 1→2 requires 90 days advance notice + 45 days consultation; Phase 2→3 requires 90 days advance notice + 60 days consultation. The formal notice period (30 days for Phase 0→1/1→2, 90 days for Phase 2→3) is the final trigger window, not the total communication timeline.

Step 5: Transition Implementation
├── Per Transition Implementation procedures (Section 7)
├── Resource mobilization
├── Public communication
└── Enhanced monitoring during transition
```

### 2.4 Guarantor Role

Guarantors participate in certification through:

| Function | Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|
| **Data verification** | Observer access to JSVC data collection |
| **Assessment review** | Consultation during formal assessment period |
| **Override authority** | Unanimous guarantor concurrence required for emergency override |
| **Implementation support** | Resource commitment for transition implementation |

Guarantors do NOT have veto power over certification itself.

---

## 3. Phase 0 to Phase 1 Transition

### 3.1 Transition Meaning

**Phase 0** establishes security deconfliction and procedural reliability.

**Phase 1** introduces voluntary individual civic participation.

The 0→1 transition signifies that the environment is **predictable and legible enough** to safely introduce individual participation mechanisms without exposing participants to unacceptable risk.

### 3.2 Success Criteria

#### 3.2.1 Escalation Metrics

| Metric | Threshold | Duration |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Major incident frequency** | ≤ 2 per month (rolling average) | 24 months |
| **Escalation-to-containment ratio** | ≥ 80% contained within 48 hours | 24 months |
| **Cross-community retaliation** | ≤ 1 confirmed cycle per quarter | 24 months |
| **Civilian casualty trend** | Declining or stable (not increasing) | 24 months |

**Major incident definition:** Any incident classified Tier 3 or above per Shock-Absorber Protocols.

#### 3.2.2 Attribution Credibility Metrics

| Metric | Threshold | Duration |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Attribution rate** | ≥ 70% of incidents attributed with confidence | 24 months |
| **Attribution accuracy** | ≤ 5% of attributions later revised | 24 months |
| **Attribution acceptance** | Both parties accept ≥ 60% of attributions | 24 months |
| **Information environment** | JSVC reports considered credible by independent monitors | 24 months |

#### 3.2.3 Infrastructure Reliability Metrics

| Metric | Threshold | Duration |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **PCC uptime** | ≥ 95% operational time | 12 months |
| **Utility PCC delivery** | ≥ 90% of scheduled deliveries completed | 12 months |
| **Medical PCC access** | ≥ 98% of emergency transfers completed | 12 months |
| **Repair response** | Average PCC repair time ≤ 72 hours | 12 months |

#### 3.2.4 Institutional Stability Metrics

| Metric | Threshold | Duration |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **JSVC operational continuity** | No major operational disruption | 18 months |
| **Party cooperation** | Both parties respond to ≥ 80% of JSVC requests | 18 months |
| **Guarantor assessment** | Positive stability rating from all guarantors | Current |

### 3.3 Assessment Methodology

#### 3.3.1 Data Sources

| Metric Type | Primary Source | Verification |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| Incident data | JSVC incident database | Guarantor observers; external monitors |
| Attribution data | JSVC attribution reports | Party response records; external audit |
| PCC data | PCC Directorate operational logs | JSVC inspection; guarantor spot-checks |
| Institutional data | JSVC internal records | External audit; party feedback |

#### 3.3.2 Rolling Windows

All duration requirements use **rolling windows**, not fixed periods:

- 24-month metrics: assessed on rolling 24-month basis
- 18-month metrics: assessed on rolling 18-month basis
- 12-month metrics: assessed on rolling 12-month basis

This prevents gaming through temporary compliance followed by relapse.

#### 3.3.3 Threshold Interpretation

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| **Borderline cases** | If metric is within 5% of threshold, extended observation required |
| **Trend direction** | Improving trend weighted positively; deteriorating trend weighted negatively |
| **Outlier events** | Single extreme events reviewed for systemic vs. isolated classification |
| **Data gaps** | Gaps exceeding 30 days require period extension |

### 3.4 Geographic Differentiation

Phase 0→1 transition may occur **asynchronously** between Gaza and West Bank:

| Scenario | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| **Both meet criteria** | Unified transition |
| **West Bank only** | West Bank transitions; Gaza remains Phase 0 |
| **Gaza only** | Gaza transitions; West Bank remains Phase 0 (unlikely but possible) |
| **Neither meets criteria** | No transition; continued Phase 0 operation |

Asynchronous transition requires:

- Clear communication that Phase 1 in one territory does not imply criteria achievement in other
- Maintained Phase 0 institutions in non-transitioning territory
- No penalty for participants in transitioning territory based on other territory's status

---

## 4. Phase 1 to Phase 2 Transition

### 4.1 Transition Meaning

**Phase 1** establishes individual civic participation without territorial change.

**Phase 2** introduces territorial pilot governance through Special Administrative Zones (SAZs).

The 1→2 transition signifies that:

- Individual participation has achieved critical mass
- Demand exists for enhanced living arrangements
- Institutional capacity exists for territorial governance
- Security environment supports defined territorial zones

### 4.2 Success Criteria

#### 4.2.1 Participation Metrics

| Metric | Threshold | Duration |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **CMS enrollment** | ≥ 50,000 active holders | 24 months |
| **Enrollment growth** | Positive net growth | 36 months |
| **Retention rate** | ≥ 80% annual renewal | 24 months |
| **Benefit utilization** | ≥ 60% of holders use at least one benefit | 24 months |

#### 4.2.2 Economic Metrics

| Metric | Threshold | Duration |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Employment access** | ≥ 10,000 CMS holders employed cross-community | 24 months |
| **Commercial Court usage** | ≥ 100 cases adjudicated | 24 months |
| **Arbitration resolution** | ≥ 90% of commercial disputes resolved | 24 months |
| **Banking access** | ≥ 70% of CMS holders with confederal banking access | 24 months |

#### 4.2.3 Security Metrics

|--------|-----------|----------|
| **CMS holder incidents** | ≤ 10 serious incidents per year against CMS holders | 24 months |
| **Anti-intimidation effectiveness** | ≥ 90% of intimidation reports processed | 24 months |
| **Protection effectiveness** | ≤ 5% of protected persons experience harm | 24 months |
| **Phase 0 metrics maintained** | All Phase 0 metrics remain above threshold | Continuous |

#### 4.2.4 Demand Indicators

| Metric | Threshold | Duration |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **SAZ interest registration** | ≥ 5,000 expressed interest in SAZ residency | Current |
| **Employer SAZ interest** | ≥ 50 employers interested in SAZ operation | Current |
| **Survey demand** | ≥ 40% of CMS holders express SAZ interest | Current |

### 4.3 SAZ Readiness Criteria

Before any SAZ can be established, additional readiness criteria must be met:

#### 4.3.1 Site Identification

| Requirement | Standard |
|-------------|----------|
| **Site selection** | At least one site identified meeting SAZ criteria |
| **Territorial clarity** | Clear boundaries with no active territorial disputes |
| **Infrastructure baseline** | Basic utilities, roads, and services present or funded |
| **Environmental assessment** | No major environmental obstacles |

#### 4.3.2 Governance Capacity

| Requirement | Standard |
|-------------|----------|
| **Administrative framework** | SAZ governance structure defined and approved |
| **Personnel identification** | Key positions identified with qualified candidates |
| **Legal framework** | SAZ-specific legal provisions enacted |
| **Judicial capacity** | Dispute resolution mechanisms established |

#### 4.3.3 Security Arrangements

| Requirement | Standard |
|-------------|----------|
| **Security plan** | Comprehensive SAZ security plan approved |
| **Force composition** | Mixed security force trained and ready |
| **External guarantee** | Guarantor security commitment in place |
| **Emergency protocols** | SAZ-specific emergency protocols established |

#### 4.3.4 Community Consent

| Requirement | Standard |
|-------------|----------|
| **Consultation completed** | Affected communities consulted per defined process |
| **Referendum approval** | Per [SAZ Selection](../03-phase-2-saz/06-internal-saz-selection.md#23-voluntary-participation-rates): ≥50% participation, ≥55% approval, ≥30% approval in each community present |
| **No majority opposition** | Referendum implies: no more than 45% oppose (since ≥55% must approve) |
| **Displacement provisions** | Relocation assistance available for those who prefer |
| **Ongoing voice** | Mechanisms for resident input established |

*Threshold note: The SAZ selection referendum (≥55% approval) is the operative standard. The "no more than 40% oppose" formulation in earlier drafts is superseded by the referendum threshold—which is more restrictive (≥55% approval = ≤45% opposition at most).*

### 4.4 Authorization Process

Phase 1→2 transition requires:

1. **JSVC certification** that Phase 1 success criteria are met
2. **SAZ Readiness certification** for at least one site
3. **30-day notice period**
4. **Guarantor concurrence** (not veto; formal expression of support)
5. **Automatic transition** unless emergency override invoked

---

## 5. Phase 2 to Phase 3 Transition

### 5.1 Transition Meaning

**Phase 2** tests territorial governance through SAZ pilots.

**Phase 3** enables voluntary political convergence if repeatedly chosen by populations.

The 2→3 transition signifies that:

- SAZ governance has demonstrated sustained success
- Populations express genuine demand for deeper integration
- Institutional capacity exists for federal-level arrangements
- Political conditions support convergence conversations

### 5.2 Success Criteria

#### 5.2.1 SAZ Stability Metrics

| Metric | Threshold | Duration |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **SAZ safety advantage** | Crime/violence rates ≤ 50% of surrounding areas | 60 months |
| **Residency demand** | Waiting list or full occupancy | 60 months |
| **Resident satisfaction** | ≥ 70% positive in annual surveys | 36 months |
| **Governance stability** | No major governance crises | 60 months |

#### 5.2.2 Institutional Metrics

| Metric | Threshold | Duration |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **All Phase 0/1 metrics maintained** | Above threshold | Continuous |
| **Core institutions fully operational** | Full compliance with charters | 24 months |
| **Inter-SAZ coordination** | If multiple SAZs, effective coordination demonstrated | 24 months |
| **Judicial legitimacy** | ≥ 80% of rulings accepted without appeal | 24 months |

#### 5.2.3 Convergence Demand Indicators

| Metric | Threshold | Duration |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Survey support** | ≥ 50% of CMS holders support deeper integration | Current |
| **Elite support** | Cross-community leadership support | Current |
| **Guarantor assessment** | Positive political conditions assessment | Current |

### 5.3 Referendum Requirements

Phase 2→3 transition requires **referendum approval**:

#### 5.3.1 Referendum Procedures

| Requirement | Standard |
|-------------|----------|
| **Eligibility** | All CMS holders in good standing for ≥ 24 months |
| **Administration** | International observation; JSVC certification of fairness |
| **Campaign period** | Minimum 90 days; equal access to media |
| **Information provision** | Neutral information materials on implications |

#### 5.3.2 Threshold Requirements

| Threshold Type | Standard |
|----------------|----------|
| **Participation** | ≥ 60% of eligible voters participate |
| **Approval** | ≥ 60% of votes cast support transition |
| **Community thresholds** | ≥ 40% support in each major community |

#### 5.3.3 Minority Protections

| Protection | Mechanism |
|------------|-----------|
| **CRC continuity** | All CRC protections remain in force |
| **Exit option** | CMS holders may exit without penalty |
| **Guaranteed representation** | Minority seats in Phase 3 institutions |
| **Veto on core rights** | Supermajority required for fundamental changes |

### 5.4 Authorization Process

Phase 2→3 transition requires:

1. **JSVC certification** that Phase 2 success criteria are met
2. **Referendum approval** per referendum requirements
3. **90-day notice period** (longer due to significance)
4. **Guarantor formal endorsement** (stronger than concurrence)
5. **Transition implementation** per Phase 3 design documents

---

## 6. Partial and Geographic Transitions

### 6.1 Geographic Differentiation Principles

MCF allows **asynchronous advancement** across territories:

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Independent assessment** | Each territory assessed separately |
| **No contamination** | Failure in one territory doesn't prevent advancement in another |
| **No false equivalence** | Success in one doesn't imply success in another |
| **Maintained coverage** | Earlier-phase institutions continue in non-transitioning territories |

### 6.2 Gaza-West Bank Differentiation

Given fundamental differences between Gaza and West Bank:

| Factor | Gaza | West Bank |
|--------|------|-----------|
| **Governance context** | De facto Hamas control; limited PA presence | PA security presence; fragmented Israeli control |
| **Operating mode** | High-intensity containment | Low-intensity governance overlay |
| **Transition likelihood** | May lag due to security environment | May lead if conditions stabilize |

### 6.3 Sector-Specific Advancement

Within a phase, some sectors may advance faster than others:

| Example | Conditions |
|---------|------------|
| **Medical cooperation first** | Medical PCCs achieve reliability before other PCCs |
| **Employment access first** | Labor mobility achieves stability before commercial courts |
| **Specific SAZ first** | One SAZ site ready before others |

Sector-specific advancement:

- Does not require formal phase transition
- Operates within existing phase framework
- Demonstrates capability for broader expansion
- Subject to normal monitoring

### 6.4 Pilot Approaches

MCF permits **pilot approaches** for testing mechanisms before full rollout:

| Pilot Type | Characteristics |
|------------|-----------------|
| **Geographic pilot** | Test in limited area before expansion |
| **Population pilot** | Test with subset of eligible population |
| **Function pilot** | Test specific function before full package |
| **Time-limited pilot** | Test with defined evaluation period |

Pilot success criteria are defined before pilot launch.

## 7. Transition Implementation

### 7.1 Transition Planning

Upon certification, a **Transition Plan** is developed:

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Timeline** | Phased implementation schedule |
| **Resource requirements** | Personnel, funding, infrastructure |
| **Institutional changes** | New institutions, expanded mandates, retired functions |
| **Communication strategy** | Stakeholder and public communication |
| **Risk mitigation** | Transition-specific risks and responses |
| **Success metrics** | How transition success will be measured |

### 7.2 Resource Mobilization

| Resource Type | Mobilization Mechanism |
|---------------|----------------------|
| **Personnel** | Hiring, training, redeployment |
| **Funding** | Budget allocation; guarantor contributions |
| **Infrastructure** | Construction, renovation, procurement |
| **Technical capacity** | System development; technical assistance |

Guarantors commit to transition resource support as part of framework agreement.

### 7.3 Communication Strategy

#### 7.3.1 Pre-Transition Communication

| Audience | Message Focus |
|----------|---------------|
| **MCF participants** | What changes; what stays the same; new opportunities |
| **General public** | What transition means; what to expect |
| **Parties** | Institutional changes; cooperation requirements |
| **Guarantors** | Implementation support; monitoring arrangements |
| **International community** | Progress narrative; continued needs |

#### 7.3.2 During-Transition Communication

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Regular updates** | Progress on implementation |
| **Issue acknowledgment** | Honest reporting of challenges |
| **Success highlighting** | Evidence of benefits materializing |
| **Feedback channels** | Mechanisms for input and concerns |

### 7.4 Monitoring During Transition

Transitions are **high-risk periods** requiring enhanced monitoring:

| Monitoring Focus | Mechanism |
|------------------|-----------|
| **Security** | Enhanced JSVC monitoring; guarantor presence |
| **Institutional** | Daily reporting during acute transition period |
| **Public perception** | Sentiment monitoring; rapid response to concerns |
| **Spoiler activity** | Heightened vigilance for sabotage attempts |

Transition period ends when:

- All planned institutional changes are operational
- Stability metrics return to baseline or improve
- Enhanced monitoring can be reduced to normal levels

---

## 8. Emergency Override Procedures

### 8.1 Override Purpose

Emergency override exists for rare circumstances where mechanical certification would produce clearly destabilizing results despite metric achievement.

**Override is NOT for:**

- Political inconvenience
- Preference to delay
- Negotiating leverage
- Uncertainty about wisdom of transition

**Override IS for:**

- Imminent security threat not yet reflected in metrics
- Institutional crisis during transition period
- External shock affecting transition viability

### 8.2 Override Authority

| Requirement | Standard |
|-------------|----------|
| **Invocation** | Requires formal request from JSVC Executive Director OR any guarantor |
| **Approval** | Requires 5 of 7 JSVC Commissioners AND unanimous guarantor concurrence |
| **Duration** | Maximum 90 days initial; renewable once with same requirements |
| **Public justification** | Written justification published within 48 hours |

### 8.3 Override Limitations

**Override May NOT:**

| Prohibition | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------|
| Suspend CRC protections | Individual rights not conditional on phase |
| Reverse completed transitions | No retroactive regression via override |
| Delay indefinitely | Maximum two invocations per transition |
| Be invoked for political convenience | Must demonstrate genuine emergency |
| Be renewed indefinitely | Two 90-day periods maximum |

### 8.4 Override Expiration

If override is not renewed with required approvals:

- Transition proceeds automatically at override expiration
- No additional delay mechanism available
- Override cannot be re-invoked for same transition after expiration

### 8.5 Override Review

All overrides are subject to:

| Review | Timing |
|--------|--------|
| **Automatic review** | 3-month review of continued necessity |
| **Post-override assessment** | After expiration, assess whether override was warranted |
| **Pattern review** | If multiple overrides, systemic review of criteria validity |

## 9. Integration with Other Protocols

### 9.1 Phase Regression Integration

| Integration Point | Relationship |
|-------------------|--------------|
| **Criteria symmetry** | Transition criteria inform regression thresholds |
| **JSVC role** | Same body certifies transitions and regressions |
| **Override asymmetry** | Transition override delays; regression override continues |
| **Recovery pathway** | Regression preserves path to re-advancement |

### 9.2 Risk Management Integration

| Integration Point | Relationship |
|-------------------|--------------|
| **Transition risk** | Phase transitions identified as high-risk periods |
| **Enhanced monitoring** | Risk monitoring intensified during transitions |
| **Spoiler response** | Transition-targeted sabotage addressed per spoiler protocols |
| **Contingency planning** | Transition plans include failure contingencies |

### 9.3 Communication Protocols Integration

| Integration Point | Relationship |
|-------------------|--------------|
| **Certification announcement** | Per public communication procedures |
| **Transition updates** | Regular updates per communication standards |
| **Override communication** | Immediate notification per emergency procedures |
| **Party notification** | Formal notification per party communication protocols |

### 9.4 JSVC Charter Integration

The detailed institutional provisions for phase transition certification are contained in [JSVC Charter Section 8](../01-phase-0-institutions/02-jsvc-charter.md#8-phase-transition-certification-authority).

This document provides operational detail for those provisions.
