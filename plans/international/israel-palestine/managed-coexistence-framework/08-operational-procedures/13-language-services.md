**Parent Document:** [00-overview.md](00-overview.md)

**Applies To:** All Phases

**Objective:** Ensure effective multilingual communication across all MCF institutions and operations.

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## 1. Purpose and Scope

### 1.1 Rationale

MCF operates across communities with different primary languages:
- **Hebrew:** Primary language of Israeli participants
- **Arabic:** Primary language of Palestinian participants (multiple dialects)
- **English:** Common second language, international legal/diplomatic standard

Effective language services are essential for:
- Equal access to MCF institutions and benefits
- Accurate understanding of rights and obligations
- Fair dispute resolution and legal proceedings
- Inclusive participation regardless of language background

### 1.2 Scope

**Covered:**
- Official MCF documents and communications
- MCF institutional proceedings (hearings, tribunals, councils)
- Public-facing services (applications, information, complaints)
- Inter-institutional communication
- Training and educational materials

**Not Covered:**
- Private communications between individuals
- Media content (subject to [11-media-civil-society.md](11-media-civil-society.md))
- Commercial transactions (parties choose their own language)

## 2. Official Languages

### 2.1 Core Languages

MCF operates in three official languages with equal status:

| Language | ISO Code | Script | Primary Users |
|----------|----------|--------|---------------|
| Arabic (Modern Standard) | ar | Arabic | Palestinian participants |
| Hebrew | he | Hebrew | Israeli participants |
| English | en | Latin | International, legal, diplomatic |

### 2.2 Language Equality Principle

**Equal Status:**
- All three languages have equal official status
- No language takes precedence in legal interpretation
- Participants may use any official language in MCF proceedings
- All binding documents must exist in all three languages

**Conflict Resolution:**
- Where translations differ in meaning, all three versions are consulted
- Legal interpretation considers intent across all versions
- Arbitration clause may specify tie-breaking language for specific documents
- Default: English for international law matters, Arabic/Hebrew for domestic law references

### 2.3 Dialect Considerations

**Arabic Dialects:**
- Official documents use Modern Standard Arabic (MSA)
- Interpretation services available for Palestinian colloquial dialects
- Gaza and West Bank dialect differences accommodated
- Levantine Arabic competency required for frontline staff

**Hebrew Variations:**
- Standard Modern Hebrew for official documents
- Accommodation for religious/traditional terminology where relevant
