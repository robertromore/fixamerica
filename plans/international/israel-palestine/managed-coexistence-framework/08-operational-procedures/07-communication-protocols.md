# Communication Protocols

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md)

**Phase:** All Phases

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## Purpose

Communication Protocols establish **how MCF institutions communicate** with each other, with parties, with guarantors, and with the public. Effective communication is foundational to MCF operations—it enables coordination, maintains credibility, and prevents misunderstandings that could escalate into crises.

The design target is **clarity without manipulation**: communication systems that are secure, timely, and resistant to disinformation while remaining transparent and accessible.

---

## Core Principle: Procedural Communication

MCF communication follows **procedural rules**, not ad hoc decisions:

- Communication channels and protocols are predefined
- Messaging follows templates and approval processes
- Timing requirements are specified and auditable
- Authenticity is verifiable through technical and procedural means

This procedural approach ensures that communication cannot be weaponized, delayed, or manipulated for political purposes.

## 1. Communication Architecture

### 1.1 Communication Domains

| Domain | Purpose | Primary Audience |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| **Internal** | MCF institution coordination | MCF personnel |
| **Party liaison** | Operational coordination with parties | Party officials |
| **Guarantor** | Oversight and support coordination | Guarantor representatives |
| **Public** | Transparency and notification | General public, media |
| **Emergency** | Crisis response and rapid notification | All stakeholders |

### 1.2 Communication Principles

**Clarity**

- Messages are unambiguous and complete
- Technical jargon is explained or avoided
- Key information is highlighted
- Languages are Arabic, Hebrew, and English (all equally authoritative)

**Timeliness**

- Time requirements are specified for each communication type
- Delays are documented and explained
- Urgent communications have expedited channels
- Non-urgent communications follow regular schedules

**Consistency**

- Messaging is consistent across audiences (adapted for audience, not contradictory)
- Templates ensure consistent format and completeness
- Approval processes prevent unauthorized messaging
- Archives enable verification of past communications

**Security**

- Sensitive communications are encrypted
- Authentication prevents impersonation
- Access controls limit who can send official communications
- Audit trails document all communications
