## Purpose

Personnel Standards defines the **hiring, training, vetting, and conduct requirements** for MCF institutional staff. MCF's credibility depends on personnel who are competent, impartial, and accountable.

Unlike national institutions, MCF cannot rely on national loyalty or existing civil service systems. It must build personnel systems from scratch that serve a multi-community framework without favoring any party.

**What This Means:**
