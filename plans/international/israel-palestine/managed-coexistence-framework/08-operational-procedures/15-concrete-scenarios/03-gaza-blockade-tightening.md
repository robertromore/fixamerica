# Scenario 03: Gaza Blockade Tightening

**Parent Document:** [Concrete Scenarios Overview](00-overview.md)

**Timeline:** Month 18 of Phase 1

**Incident Type:** Humanitarian crisis during security escalation

**Status:** Draft

---

## Background

Month 18 of Phase 1. Following a security incident (rocket attack that killed Israeli civilians), Israel announces comprehensive tightening of Gaza border restrictions. Egypt coordinates by restricting Rafah crossing.

**Security Context:**

- Recent rocket attack: 3 Israeli civilians killed
- Israeli government faces domestic pressure for "decisive response"
- Hamas and other factions remain active
- No ground operation—blockade tightening presented as "proportionate response"

**Restrictions Announced:**

1. Fuel imports reduced by 80%
2. Medical supplies subject to "security review" with indefinite processing times
3. Dual-use goods list expanded; construction materials suspended
4. Water treatment supplies categorized as dual-use
5. Civilian crossings suspended indefinitely
6. Fishing zone reduced to 3 nautical miles

**Key Test:** Security response creates humanitarian crisis. MCF must maintain humanitarian floor without endorsing actions of either party.

## Hour 0-6: Blockade Announcement

### Automatic Triggers

| System | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **PCC assessment** | All Gaza PCCs evaluated for impact |
| **Humanitarian threshold monitoring** | Baseline data collection on current stocks |
| **JSVC notification** | Emergency consultation requested |
| **Guarantor alert** | Preliminary notification of potential humanitarian impact |

### UVB First Tasks

1. Document current Gaza stockpiles (fuel, medical, water treatment)
2. Calculate runway before critical shortages (per pre-established thresholds)
3. Assess which MCF PCCs are directly affected
4. Request clarification from Israeli authorities on duration and scope

### Initial Assessment

| Category | Pre-Blockade Stock | Daily Consumption | Runway |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Fuel (electricity)** | 5-day reserve | 450,000 liters | 5 days |
| **Medical supplies** | Variable by item | Variable | 7-30 days |
| **Water treatment chemicals** | 14-day reserve | Standard | 14 days |

---

## Day 1-3: Humanitarian Threshold Approach

### PCC Protection Mode Activation

Per [PCC Protocols](../../01-phase-0-institutions/03-pcc-protocols.md), medical and water PCCs cannot be fully closed:

| PCC Type | Restriction Limit | Current Status |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Medical supply** | Max 25% reduction | Approaching limit (review delays = effective reduction) |
| **Water** | Max 50% throughput reduction | Within limit but trending |
| **Fuel (medical facilities)** | Protected allocation | Not being honored |

### JSVC Emergency Consultation

JSVC convenes emergency session per [JSVC Charter Section 3](../../01-phase-0-institutions/02-jsvc-charter.md#3-decision-making):

**Agenda:**

1. Verify humanitarian threshold data
2. Assess compliance with PCC floor requirements
3. Determine appropriate framework response
4. Coordinate guarantor engagement

**Finding:**

> "Current restrictions, if maintained, will breach MCF humanitarian thresholds within [X] days. Medical PCC throughput is below agreed floor due to review delays. Fuel allocation for protected facilities is not being honored."

### Guarantor Notification (Formal)

| Content | Distribution |
|---------|--------------|
| **Threshold breach warning** | All guarantors within 24 hours |
| **Specific violations** | Medical PCC, fuel allocation |
| **Projected timeline** | Critical shortage dates |
| **Requested action** | Guarantor intervention on PCC compliance |

---

## Day 4-7: Humanitarian Deterioration

### Situation Development

| Factor | Status |
|--------|--------|
| **Hospital fuel** | Reserves at 48 hours; generators running on rationing |
| **Water treatment** | Operating at reduced capacity; quality declining |
| **Medical supplies** | Critical shortages emerging in specific categories |
| **Civilian deaths** | First deaths attributable to medical access failure |

### UVB Documentation

**Daily situation reports include:**

- Hospital generator status (operational hours remaining)
- Water quality measurements
- Medical supply inventory by critical category
- Deaths with documented causal link to shortages

**Attribution standard:**

> "Patient [ID] died at [time]. Hospital records indicate: [condition], [required treatment], [treatment unavailable due to: supply shortage/power failure]. UVB assessment: Death is attributable to shortage conditions with [high/medium/low] confidence."

### Israeli Position

Israeli government maintains:

- Restrictions are security necessity
- Hamas is responsible for civilian conditions
- Humanitarian supplies are entering "as permitted by security"
- MCF has no authority to override security decisions

### MCF Response: Factual Without Political

**What MCF says:**

> "The following conditions exist: [factual findings]. These conditions breach the following MCF thresholds: [specific thresholds]. The framework documents these findings without prejudice to security decisions, which remain Israeli sovereign authority."

**What MCF does NOT say:**

- Israel is committing war crimes
- Israel must lift the blockade
- Hamas bears no responsibility
- The blockade is illegal

---

## Day 7-14: Threshold Breach and Response

### Formal Threshold Breach Declaration

JSVC formally declares:

> "MCF humanitarian thresholds have been breached as of [date]. Specifically:
>
> - Medical PCC throughput: Below floor (currently at [X]% of minimum)
> - Fuel for protected facilities: Below allocation (currently at [X]% of requirement)
> - Water treatment capacity: Below threshold (quality measurements at [X])
>
> This declaration triggers: [specific procedural consequences per framework agreements]."

### Procedural Consequences

| Consequence | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Threshold breach documented** | Permanent record |
| **Guarantor notification** | Formal breach report |
| **Compliance clock starts** | 72-hour compliance restoration window per [Shock-Absorber Protocols Section 4](../../01-phase-0-institutions/04-shock-absorber-protocols.md#4-proportionality-constraints) |
| **Public reporting** | Breach made public with factual basis |

### Guarantor Engagement

| Guarantor | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| **U.S.** | Private demarche to Israeli government |
| **EU** | Statement on humanitarian concerns |
| **Regional guarantors** | Coordination on alternative supply routes |
| **UN** | Briefing on humanitarian situation |

### What Guarantors Can Do

| Mechanism | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Diplomatic pressure** | Direct communication with Israeli leadership |
| **Conditionality** | Specific support elements conditioned on threshold restoration |
| **Alternative supply** | Coordinate humanitarian supplies through alternative routes |
| **Public position** | If private pressure fails, public statements |

## Day 14-21: Resolution Branches

### Branch A: Israel Restores Humanitarian Floor

**Israeli Action:**

- Fuel allocation for hospitals restored
- Medical supply review expedited (24-hour processing)
- Water treatment supplies exempted from dual-use list
- Broader restrictions maintained for "security"

**Framework Response:**

| Action | Scope |
|--------|-------|
| **Compliance restoration documented** | Breach clock stops |
| **Threshold breach remains on record** | Permanent documentation |
| **Ongoing monitoring** | Daily verification of floor compliance |
| **Guarantor notification** | Positive trajectory reported |

**Outcome:**

Framework survives. Humanitarian floor restored. Broader blockade continues but MCF-protected minimums maintained. Documentation record shows breach + restoration.

---

### Branch B: Israel Maintains Restrictions; Guarantors Provide Alternative

**Israeli Position:**

- Restrictions maintained as security necessity
- Rejects MCF threshold requirements as exceeding framework authority
- Accepts guarantor humanitarian supplies through specific channels

**Guarantor Action:**

- Direct humanitarian supply through naval corridor (if Egypt cooperates)
- Airdrops of critical medical supplies
- Coordination with UN agencies
- Public statement on Israeli non-compliance with MCF thresholds

**Framework Response:**

| Action | Scope |
|--------|-------|
| **Non-compliance documented** | Permanent record of Israeli position |
| **Alternative supply acknowledged** | Framework credits guarantor intervention |
| **Threshold assessment** | If humanitarian floor restored through alternative means, breach partially remediated |
| **Framework authority question** | Israeli rejection of threshold requirements documented |

**Outcome:**

Framework survives through guarantor intervention. Israeli-MCF relationship damaged. Precedent set for guarantor bypass of party non-compliance. Humanitarian floor restored through external means.

---

### Branch C: Sustained Humanitarian Crisis

**Situation:**

- Israel maintains restrictions
- Guarantors unable to provide sufficient alternative supply
- Humanitarian floor breached for extended period (>14 days)
- Civilian deaths mount

**Framework Response:**

| Phase | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **Day 14-21** | Continued documentation; daily death counts; guarantor escalation |
| **Day 21+** | Phase regression assessment triggered |
| **JSVC vote** | 4-of-7 threshold for regression determination |

### Phase Regression Assessment

Per [Phase Regression](../03-phase-regression.md):

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Humanitarian threshold breach** | Sustained (>14 days) |
| **Party compliance** | Israel: non-compliant with humanitarian floor |
| **Framework function** | Documentation continues; corridor protection failing |
| **Guarantor position** | Unable to restore conditions |

### Regression Options

| Option | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| **Maintain Phase 0** | Only if restoration imminent |
| **Partial regression** | Suspend non-humanitarian PCCs; maintain verification |
| **Full regression** | Framework contracts to documentation-only |

### What Regression Looks Like

1. Non-humanitarian PCCs formally suspended (they're already not functioning)
2. CMS enrollment paused in Gaza (conditions prevent normal operation)
3. UVB documentation continues (core function preserved)
4. JSVC verification continues (factual record maintained)
5. Arbitration paused (conditions prevent normal operation)

**Critical point:** Regression does not mean framework abandons Gaza. It means framework acknowledges reality that full operation is impossible while maintaining core verification function.

**Outcome:**

Framework contracts to humanitarian-core/documentation mode. Violence against civilians documented. Path to restoration preserved. Framework credibility maintained through honest acknowledgment of limits.

## Success Criteria

After a sustained blockade crisis, the framework:

- [ ] Still exists
- [ ] Still documents humanitarian conditions (deaths, shortages, causes)
- [ ] Still maintains threshold standards (even if breached and documented)
- [ ] Still has guarantor engagement
- [ ] Still has path to restoration when conditions permit

**What MCF Does NOT Do:**

- Lift the blockade
- Override Israeli security decisions
- Provide humanitarian supplies (that's guarantors/UN)
- Declare war crimes

**What MCF Prevents:**

- Undocumented humanitarian deterioration
- Disputed death counts
- Narrative free-for-all on cause of deaths
- Total collapse of shared factual basis

---

## Key Design Validation

This scenario validates:

1. **Humanitarian floor design:** Thresholds create benchmarks even when violated
2. **Documentation persistence:** Facts accumulate even during crisis
3. **Guarantor role:** External leverage matters when parties don't comply
4. **Regression as feature:** Framework survives by acknowledging limits
5. **Attribution methodology:** Deaths can be attributed to conditions without legal judgments
6. **Breach clock mechanism:** Compliance restoration has defined timeline
