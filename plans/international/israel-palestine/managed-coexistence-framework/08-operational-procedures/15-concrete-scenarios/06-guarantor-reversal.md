# Scenario 06: Guarantor Policy Reversal

**Parent Document:** [Concrete Scenarios Overview](00-overview.md)

**Timeline:** Month 30 of Phase 1

**Incident Type:** Major guarantor withdraws support mid-operation

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## Background

Month 30 of Phase 1. MCF has operated for over two years. CMS enrollment is substantial; PCCs are functioning; trust is building. Then: U.S. administration change results in dramatic policy shift.

**Political Context:**

- New U.S. administration takes office
- Campaign promised "different approach" to Israel-Palestine
- Key advisors skeptical of MCF as "constraint on Israeli sovereignty"
- Domestic political calculation favors distancing from framework

**Policy Reversal Announcement:**

1. U.S. withdraws from Guarantor Forum
2. U.S. funding for MCF suspended
3. U.S. declares MCF "does not reflect American interests"
4. U.S. signals it will not enforce compliance conditionality

**Key Test:** Primary guarantor withdrawal during operational phase. Framework must survive loss of major supporter without collapse.

---

## Day 1: Reversal Announcement

### Immediate Impact Assessment

| System | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| **Funding** | ~30% of MCF budget at risk (U.S. contribution at diversification cap) |
| **Political cover** | Israeli participation loses U.S. endorsement |
| **Leverage mechanism** | U.S. compliance conditionality removed |
| **International credibility** | Major blow to framework legitimacy |

### JSVC Emergency Session

**Agenda:**

1. Assess operational continuity capacity
2. Determine replacement funding sources
3. Evaluate remaining guarantor commitment
4. Plan communication strategy

### What MCF Does Immediately

| Action | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Acknowledge change** | "MCF has been informed of U.S. policy change. We are assessing implications." |
| **No panic** | Framework continues normal operations |
| **Guarantor consultation** | Emergency consultation with remaining guarantors |
| **Participant reassurance** | "MCF operational status unchanged pending full assessment" |

### What MCF Does NOT Do

- Attack U.S. decision publicly
- Declare framework in crisis
- Suspend operations immediately
- Make political statements about U.S. administration

---

## Day 1-7: Stabilization Assessment

### Remaining Guarantor Capacity

| Guarantor | Capacity | Willingness |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **EU** | Substantial funding capacity; political weight | High—differentiation from U.S. |
| **Regional (Jordan, Egypt, UAE, Qatar)** | Moderate funding; regional legitimacy | Variable—depends on U.S. pressure |
| **UN agencies** | Limited direct funding; operational support | High—institutional mandate |
| **Other (Norway, Switzerland, etc.)** | Moderate funding; neutral credibility | High—traditional peace support |

### Funding Gap Analysis

| Category | Pre-Reversal | Post-Reversal | Gap |
|----------|--------------|---------------|-----|
| **Core operations** | 100% funded | ~70% funded | 30% |
| **CMS administration** | 100% funded | ~75% funded | 25% |
| **PCC operations** | 100% funded | ~70% funded | 30% |
| **UVB/JSVC** | 100% funded | ~85% funded (UN support) | 15% |

### Guarantor Forum Response

Remaining guarantors convene emergency session:

| Outcome | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Commitment reaffirmation** | EU, regional guarantors reaffirm support |
| **Burden redistribution** | Gap-filling discussions begin |
| **Operational continuity** | Agreement to maintain operations during transition |
| **Political coordination** | Joint statement on MCF continuation |

---

## Day 7-30: Operational Adaptation

### Funding Adaptation

| Strategy | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| **EU increase** | EU increases contribution to cover 15% of gap |
| **Regional pooling** | Regional guarantors pool contributions for 10% |
| **Efficiency measures** | Non-essential operations reduced (5% savings) |
| **Reserve deployment** | 6-month operational reserve covers transition |

### Political Adaptation

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **Israeli skepticism** | Reduced U.S. cover may actually reduce Israeli domestic criticism |
| **Palestinian skepticism** | U.S. withdrawal may increase Palestinian trust |
| **International perception** | Framework survives major blow; demonstrates resilience |

### Leverage Adaptation

Without U.S. compliance conditionality:

| Previous Mechanism | Replacement |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **U.S. diplomatic pressure** | EU diplomatic pressure; less weight but still meaningful |
| **U.S. military conditionality** | None; gap cannot be fully replaced |
| **U.S. economic leverage** | EU trade relationships; regional economic ties |

### Operational Continuity

| Function | Status |
|----------|--------|
| **UVB verification** | Continues with reduced resources |
| **JSVC operations** | Continues; U.S. seat may be filled by observer or remain vacant |
| **CMS administration** | Continues with efficiency measures |
| **PCC operations** | Continues; may reduce coverage to priority routes |

---

## Branches: Outcome Variations

### Branch A: Successful Transition—Framework Stabilizes

**Conditions:**

- Remaining guarantors fill funding gap within 90 days
- Israeli participation continues (domestic criticism manageable)
- Palestinian participation increases (U.S. departure welcomed by some)
- Operational capacity maintained at 85%+ level

**Framework Response:**

| Action | Scope |
|--------|-------|
| **Adaptation documented** | Transition lessons captured |
| **Diversified funding** | Less dependent on single guarantor |
| **Political reframing** | Framework positioned as multilateral, not U.S.-led |
| **Continued operations** | Normal operations resume |

**Long-term implications:**

- Framework more resilient to future U.S. policy changes
- Reduced U.S. leverage means reduced U.S. ability to shape outcomes
- Regional guarantors gain relative influence
- Framework survives as genuinely multilateral institution

**Outcome:**

Framework survives and potentially strengthens. U.S. withdrawal creates precedent for framework independence from any single guarantor.

---

### Branch B: Partial Adaptation—Reduced Scope

**Conditions:**

- Funding gap partially filled (60-70%)
- Operations must contract to match resources
- Priority functions maintained; expansion halted
- Some PCC routes suspended

**Framework Response:**

| Action | Scope |
|--------|-------|
| **Triage** | Core functions (verification, humanitarian PCCs) prioritized |
| **Expansion pause** | CMS enrollment halted in expansion zones |
| **PCC reduction** | Non-priority routes suspended |
| **Staff reduction** | Non-essential positions eliminated |

**Operational Scope:**

| Function | Status |
|----------|--------|
| **UVB verification** | Maintained at reduced capacity |
| **JSVC operations** | Maintained |
| **CMS (pilot zones)** | Maintained |
| **CMS (expansion zones)** | Suspended |
| **Medical/water PCCs** | Maintained |
| **General goods PCCs** | Reduced or suspended |

**Long-term implications:**

- Framework operates in contracted mode indefinitely
- Path to expansion preserved but delayed
- Pressure to restore U.S. support continues
- Guarantor Forum seeks alternative arrangements

**Outcome:**

Framework survives in reduced form. Core functions maintained. Expansion capacity depends on future funding restoration.

---

### Branch C: Cascading Withdrawal—Multiple Guarantors Exit

**Conditions:**

- U.S. pressure causes regional guarantors to distance
- EU faces internal divisions on continued support
- Israeli government sees opportunity to exit
- Framework faces existential crisis

**Warning Indicators:**

| Indicator | Observation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Regional guarantor statements** | Hedging language; reduced commitment |
| **EU internal debates** | Member states questioning contribution |
| **Israeli political shift** | Government signals MCF is "failed experiment" |
| **Funding collapse** | Gap exceeds 50% |

**Framework Response:**

| Phase | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **Emergency assessment** | JSVC evaluates operational viability |
| **Core preservation** | UVB function maintained regardless |
| **Participant protection** | CMS holders' interests protected in wind-down |
| **Documentation** | All records preserved |

### Phase Regression Assessment

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Funding viability** | Below operational threshold |
| **Guarantor commitment** | Insufficient for continued operation |
| **Party cooperation** | Insufficient without guarantor backing |
| **Framework function** | Core verification may continue; full operations cannot |

### Regression Options

| Option | Trigger |
|--------|---------|
| **Operational pause** | Funding below 40%; suspend operations pending restoration |
| **Verification-only mode** | UVB continues documentation; all other functions suspended |
| **Orderly wind-down** | If restoration unlikely, structured closure protecting participants |

### What Orderly Wind-Down Looks Like

1. **CMS transition:** Participants given 180 days to adjust; status protections continue during transition
2. **Record preservation:** All documentation transferred to neutral repository (UN, academic institution)
3. **PCC closure:** Structured return to pre-MCF arrangements with humanitarian protections where possible
4. **Staff transition:** Severance and placement support
5. **Lessons documentation:** Comprehensive record for future initiatives

**Outcome:**

Framework closes but does not collapse chaotically. Participants protected during transition. Records preserved. Path to future revival documented.

---

## Day 30-90: Long-Term Adaptation

### Regardless of Branch

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Documentation continues** | UVB function survives in all scenarios |
| **Participant dignity** | CMS holders never abandoned |
| **Record preservation** | Facts survive institutional change |
| **Learning captured** | Lessons documented for future |

### Political Dynamics

**U.S. pressure options:**

| Pressure | MCF Response |
|----------|--------------|
| **Active opposition** | Document interference; maintain operations |
| **Passive withdrawal** | Adapt to reduced resources; continue |
| **Conditional return** | Evaluate conditions; accept if consistent with framework principles |

**Future U.S. re-engagement:**

| Condition | MCF Position |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Unconditional return** | Welcome; seat restored |
| **Conditional return** | Evaluate conditions; reject if inconsistent with principles |
| **Partial engagement** | May accept observer status without full commitment |

---

## Success Criteria

After a major guarantor reversal, the framework:

- [ ] Still exists (in some form)
- [ ] Still documents facts
- [ ] Still protects current participants (even in wind-down)
- [ ] Still preserves institutional record
- [ ] Still maintains path to restoration

**What MCF Does NOT Do:**

- Prevent guarantor policy changes
- Guarantee funding perpetuity
- Force U.S. participation
- Collapse chaotically abandoning participants

**What MCF Prevents:**

- Chaotic collapse without participant protection
- Loss of documented factual record
- Permanent destruction of institutional capacity
- Spoiler victory through sponsor withdrawal

---

## Key Design Validation

This scenario validates:

1. **Guarantor diversification:** No single guarantor can collapse framework by withdrawal
2. **Operational resilience:** Core functions survive funding reduction
3. **Participant protection:** CMS holders protected even in wind-down
4. **Record preservation:** Documentation survives institutional change
5. **Political independence:** Framework not hostage to any guarantor's domestic politics
6. **Orderly regression:** Structured contraction better than chaotic collapse

---

## Guarantor Architecture Implications

This scenario reveals critical design requirements:

| Requirement | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------|
| **No >30% single-guarantor funding** | Prevents single-point funding failure per [Funding Architecture](../../04-guarantor-architecture/03-funding-architecture.md) |
| **Reserve requirement** | 6-month operational reserve mandatory |
| **Diversified political backing** | Multiple regional and international guarantors |
| **Independent operational capacity** | Core functions not dependent on any single guarantor |
| **Record externalization** | Documentation housed in multiple repositories |
