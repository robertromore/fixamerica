# Scenario 01: Rocket Barrage + Airstrikes + Contested Hospital Incident

**Parent Document:** [Concrete Scenarios Overview](00-overview.md)

**Timeline:** Month 6 of Phase 0

**Incident Type:** Mass-casualty attack with disputed attribution and protected infrastructure impact

**Status:** Draft

---

## Background

Month 6 of Phase 0. It's a normal weekday until early afternoon, when a large rocket barrage is launched from Gaza toward southern and central Israel. Some rockets are intercepted, some land in open areas, and a few hit populated zones, causing Israeli civilian casualties.

Within minutes, Israel declares a major security incident; the IDF begins immediate defensive and offensive actions as it does today.

**Critical principle:** Under MCF, nothing delays self-defense. Israel responds on its own authority, and Hamas (or other armed factions) continues acting on its own motives. The MCF layer activates **in parallel**, not instead.

---

## Hour 0-2: Rapid Lane Activation

### Automatic Triggers

| System | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Incident classification** | Tier 4 (mass casualties) automatically triggered |
| **UVB/JSVC rapid lane** | Activated per pre-defined severity protocols |
| **Deconfliction hotlines** | Opened with Israeli authorities; Gaza-side intermediaries contacted where feasible |
| **Evidence preservation** | Requests issued for hospital logs, telecom records, emergency service data |

### UVB/JSVC First Tasks

The first task is not moral judgment but **stabilizing facts before narratives harden**:

1. Open incident case files with strict chain-of-custody
2. Pull time-synced intercept data where available
3. Collect open-source video with provenance tags
4. Request preservation of logs from hospitals, telecoms, emergency services
5. Initiate private deconfliction channels

### Public Communication (within 2 hours)

UVB/JSVC issues a short statement:

> "A high-severity incident has occurred. A rapid factual review is underway. Preliminary findings will be published within 24 hours; interim attribution assessment within 72 hours. Updates will follow this timeline unless circumstances require acceleration."

**Key principle:** Publish process and time bounds immediately. Nobody can credibly claim "silence means cover-up" when the timeline is precommitted.

---

## Hour 2-12: Airstrikes and Hospital Incident

### Military Operations

Israel conducts airstrikes against what it says are launch sites and command nodes. During this window, a strike hits near (or impacts) a hospital complex in Gaza, causing deaths and chaos.

### Competing Claims Explode

- One side says it was a deliberate Israeli attack on a hospital
- The other says it was a misfired rocket or secondary explosion

### MCF Response (Dual Track)

| Track | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **PCC Protection Mode** | Medical evacuation lanes and critical repair access explicitly preserved; if immediate security threat exists, segment-level restrictions with alternate route activation per [PCC Protocols Section 5.1](../../01-phase-0-institutions/03-pcc-protocols.md#51-integration-with-shock-absorber-protocols) (medical PCCs are never fully closed) |
| **Shock-Absorber Ladder** | Narrowing only discretionary corridors (trade windows, non-essential transit) for fixed period; medical and core utilities prioritized |

### What Gets Restricted

- Non-essential transit: Suspended
- Trade windows: Narrowed to critical supplies only
- General goods PCCs: Throughput reduced per tier protocols

### What Stays Protected

- Medical PCCs: Patient transfer (max 50% reduction), medical supply (max 25% reduction), facilities (no restriction)
- Water PCCs: Throughput reduction only (max 50%)
- Medical evacuation lanes: Explicitly maintained
- Emergency repair access: Preserved

### Design Logic

This prevents total humanitarian collapse from becoming the accelerant for wider escalation. The framework contracts but does not disappear.

---

## Hour 12-24: Preliminary "What We Know" Publication

### UVB/JSVC Publishes Standardized Update

| Category | Content |
|----------|---------|
| **Time window** | Specific time range of hospital incident |
| **Blast signature** | Initial observations with confidence levels |
| **Casualty sources** | Which reporting entities provided data |
| **Deconfliction status** | Whether notifications were attempted through any channels |
| **PCC compliance** | Whether repair access was requested; whether emergency movement was obstructed |

### What UVB/JSVC Does NOT Do

- Rule on legality
- Determine intent
- Assign blame

### Internal Flags

UVB/JSVC flags whether the event triggers a "procedural breach":

- [ ] Failure to notify per deconfliction protocols
- [ ] Striking within defined protected radius without procedure
- [ ] Interference with medical evacuation
- [ ] Obstruction of emergency repair access

### Credibility Mechanism

The framework's credibility depends on disciplined stance: it can say "uncertain" without looking evasive because it has **precommitted to a timeline and method**. Uncertainty with process is credible; uncertainty without process is evasion.

---

## Day 2 (24-48 Hours): Technical Attribution and Political Pressure

### UVB/JSVC Rapid Lane Attribution Work

| Method | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| **Radar/intercept traces** | If shared by parties or guarantors |
| **Crater analysis** | If physical access possible |
| **Munition fragment provenance** | Where credible samples obtained |
| **Geolocated video triangulation** | Open-source verification |

### Political Pressure Peak

- Israeli leaders face demands to "finish Hamas"
- Palestinians face rage and claims the framework is "laundering violence"
- Both domestic audiences demand maximal response

### MCF Containment Logic

Prevent political surge from destroying the procedural layer by making responses **automatic and time-limited**:

| Mechanism | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Automatic corridor tightening** | Leaders can claim they are "getting tougher" without burning down framework |
| **Time-limited suspensions** | Built-in restoration prevents indefinite shutdown |
| **Pre-negotiated responses** | No one can claim the framework is "too soft" or "too hard"—it follows protocol |

### Anti-Intimidation Activation

| Trigger | Response |
|---------|----------|
| Threats against CMS participants | High-severity violation; documented |
| Threats against aid workers | High-severity violation; documented |
| Coercion of moderate voices | Processing channels shift outward (JSVC-facilitated emergency coordination, guarantor-arranged remote processing, remote arbitration) |

### Design Logic

Keep moderate participation from being terrorized into silence. Participation channels must survive the political storm.

---

## Day 3 (48-72 Hours): Interim Finding on Hospital Incident

### UVB/JSVC Issues Substantive Interim Finding

The finding is carefully scoped but substantive:

**If evidence points to Israeli strike:**

> "Based on [specific evidence types], the hospital incident is assessed with [confidence level] to have resulted from an Israeli airstrike. The following deconfliction steps were [documented/not documented]. Protected-infrastructure safeguards were [followed/not followed] in the following respects: [specific findings]."

**If evidence points to misfire or secondary explosion:**

> "Based on [specific evidence types], the hospital incident is assessed with [confidence level] to have resulted from [rocket misfire/secondary explosion/other]. Evidence basis: [specific findings]. Confidence limitations: [specific uncertainties]."

**In Either Case:**

- Confidence level explicitly stated
- Specific evidentiary basis published in non-classified form
- Methodology documented
- Limitations acknowledged

### Why This Matters

This is the decisive moment. The framework's purpose is to **prevent the conflict from becoming a pure narrative war** where each side can deny reality indefinitely.

---

## Procedural Consequences: The "Teeth"

The framework's enforcement at this stage is not arrests. It is **procedural consequences**.

### If Israel Found to Have Violated PCC Rules

| Finding | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Strike on protected medical node without required procedure | Guarantors may tighten diplomatic cover |
| Failure to issue deconfliction notification | Certain forms of support conditioned on procedural compliance |
| Pattern of protected-infrastructure violations | Escalating conditionality through guarantor mechanisms |

### If Hamas/Factions Found to Have Violated Framework

| Finding | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Launching from protected civilian sites | Sanctions-like consequences through guarantors |
| Obstructing medical corridors | Sharp restriction of discretionary benefits |
| Intimidation of CMS participants | Network-level benefit denial |

### Key Principle

Consequences are **external** (diplomatic, financial, legal exposure through guarantors) rather than internal grandstanding. The framework documents; guarantors apply leverage.

---

## End of Week 1: Formal Severity Review

### Review Question

Not "who won the battle," but **whether the incident has crossed rollback thresholds**.

### Rollback Assessment Criteria

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Corridor violations | Single incident vs. repeated pattern |
| Intimidation of participants | Isolated vs. sustained campaign |
| Protected infrastructure strikes | Procedural compliance vs. systematic noncompliance |
| Framework cooperation | Parties engaging vs. parties obstructing |

### Rollback Is

- Not automatic after one catastrophe
- Presumption-based and pattern-sensitive
- Designed to preserve core functions

### If Rollback Thresholds Crossed

| Action | Scope |
|--------|-------|
| Non-essential PCCs pause | Trade, general goods, discretionary transit |
| CMS expansions halt | No new enrollments; existing status maintained |
| System returns to "humanitarian core" mode | Medical, water, verification, record continuity |

### If Procedures Mostly Followed Despite Violence

| Action | Scope |
|--------|-------|
| Framework holds footprint steady | No contraction |
| Restoration priority | Power-water coupling, medical supply chains first |
| Verification continues | Full documentation maintained |

---

## Success Criteria

The key success criterion is boring but profound:

**After a mass-casualty week, the framework:**

- [ ] Still exists
- [ ] Still publishes facts
- [ ] Still protects at least one corridor
- [ ] Still has participants who believe it can outlast the crisis

**What MCF Does NOT Do:**

- Prevent the barrage
- Prevent retaliation
- "Solve" the war

**What MCF Prevents:**

- Total narrative free-for-all
- Total humanitarian shutdown
- Total collapse of any shared procedure

**Core Functions Maintained:**

1. **Verification:** Facts continue to be documented
2. **Medical/utility protection:** At least humanitarian core preserved
3. **Predictable consequence ladders:** Responses remain bounded and time-limited

---

## Attribution Branches

*The following branches show divergent outcomes based on hospital incident attribution.*

---

## Branch A: Hospital Incident Attributed to Israeli Strike (High Confidence)

### Attribution Finding

**Day 3 Publication:**

> "The UVB/JSVC rapid assessment finds with **high confidence** (>80% certainty) that the hospital complex incident resulted from an Israeli airstrike. This finding is based on:
>
> - Munition fragment analysis (identified as [munition type])
> - Radar track data provided by [source]
> - Crater characteristics inconsistent with rocket propellant
> - Absence of secondary explosion signature
>
> **Procedural compliance assessment:**
>
> - Deconfliction notification: Not issued prior to strike
> - Protected-radius protocol: Strike occurred within 500m of designated medical facility (protected-radius distances are defined in facility-specific deconfliction agreements per [PCC Protocols Section 3.2](../../01-phase-0-institutions/03-pcc-protocols.md); 500m is illustrative)
> - Medical evacuation: Obstructed for [X] hours post-incident"

### Immediate Procedural Consequences

| Consequence | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Procedural breach documented** | Permanent record in JSVC database |
| **Guarantor notification** | Formal breach report to all guarantors within 24 hours |
| **Compliance conditionality activated** | Guarantors notified that future [specific support category] conditioned on corrective measures |

### What Gets Suspended

| Category | Duration | Restoration Condition |
|----------|----------|-----------------------|
| **Discretionary PCCs** | 7 days (Tier 4 protocol; guarantor approval required for >72 hours per [Shock-Absorber Protocols](../../01-phase-0-institutions/04-shock-absorber-protocols.md)) | Procedural compliance review |
| **Non-essential transit** | 14 days (within 30-day maximum per [Shock-Absorber Protocols Section 4.1](../../01-phase-0-institutions/04-shock-absorber-protocols.md#41-maximum-response-caps)) | Restoration plan accepted |
| **CMS expansion in affected zone** | Until compliance assessment complete | Guarantor certification |

**CMS Expansion Clarification:** "CMS expansion" pause is a zone-specific, compliance-conditional measure—distinct from the general 30-day processing pause cap in [Shock-Absorber Protocols Section 4.1](../../01-phase-0-institutions/04-shock-absorber-protocols.md#41-maximum-response-caps). This measure halts *new enrollments in the affected zone* until guarantor certification of compliance, not general CMS processing across MCF.

### What Stays Protected

| Category | Status |
|----------|--------|
| **Medical PCCs** | Maintained (throughput reduction only) |
| **Water PCCs** | Maintained (throughput reduction only) |
| **Emergency repair access** | Explicitly preserved |
| **CMS holder protections** | Continued for existing participants |

### Guarantor Response Options

| Guarantor Action | Trigger |
|------------------|---------|
| Diplomatic cover reduction | Single high-confidence breach |
| Support conditionality | Pattern of breaches (2+ in 30 days) |
| Funding adjustment | Systematic noncompliance finding |
| Public statement | At guarantor discretion |

### Israeli Response Options Under Framework

Israel retains full options but faces procedural exposure:

| Option | Framework Consequence |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Accept finding, implement corrective measures** | Compliance restored; breach remains on record but no escalation |
| **Dispute finding through JSVC review process** | 14-day review; finding may be modified |
| **Reject framework authority** | Guarantor leverage escalates; framework contracts but continues |

### Week 1 Review Outcome (Branch A)

**Finding:** Single high-severity procedural breach; framework does not roll back but:

- Documents breach permanently
- Triggers guarantor consultation
- Conditions future support on compliance improvements
- Maintains humanitarian core at full operation
- Suspends discretionary expansion until compliance review

**Framework Status:** Contracted but operational. Humanitarian core preserved. Verification continues.

---

## Branch B: Hospital Incident Attributed to Rocket Misfire (High Confidence)

### Attribution Finding

**Day 3 Publication:**

> "The UVB/JSVC rapid assessment finds with **high confidence** (>80% certainty) that the hospital complex incident resulted from a rocket misfire or premature detonation. This finding is based on:
>
> - Munition fragment analysis (identified as [rocket type] consistent with Gaza-origin projectiles)
> - Trajectory analysis inconsistent with Israeli flight paths
> - Propellant residue pattern consistent with rocket fuel
> - No radar track of Israeli aircraft in incident timeframe
>
> **Associated findings:**
>
> - Launch site identified within [X] meters of civilian infrastructure
> - Medical corridor obstruction: [Yes/No] during evacuation period"

### Immediate Procedural Consequences

| Consequence | Mechanism |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Launch-site documentation** | Permanent record of civilian-proximity launch |
| **Guarantor notification** | Formal report on civilian infrastructure use |
| **Benefit conditionality** | Discretionary benefits to networks associated with launch restricted |

### What Gets Suspended

| Category | Duration | Restoration Condition |
|----------|----------|-----------------------|
| **Discretionary PCCs** | 7 days (Tier 4 protocol; guarantor approval required for >72 hours per [Shock-Absorber Protocols](../../01-phase-0-institutions/04-shock-absorber-protocols.md)) | Standard restoration |
| **Non-essential transit** | 7 days (within 30-day maximum per [Shock-Absorber Protocols Section 4.1](../../01-phase-0-institutions/04-shock-absorber-protocols.md#41-maximum-response-caps)) | Security assessment |
| **Benefits to associated networks** | Indefinite | Compliance verification |

### What Stays Protected

| Category | Status |
|----------|--------|
| **Medical PCCs** | Maintained (individual participants protected) |
| **Water PCCs** | Maintained |
| **CMS holder protections** | Continued (individual basis) |
| **Humanitarian access** | Preserved |

### Framework Response to Civilian Infrastructure Use

| Finding | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| **Documented launch near protected site** | Pattern report to guarantors |
| **Repeated use of civilian proximity** | Escalating benefit restrictions |
| **Obstruction of medical corridors** | High-severity violation; network-level consequences |

### Palestinian Response Options Under Framework

| Option | Framework Consequence |
|--------|----------------------|
| **Accept finding** | No further escalation; pattern monitoring continues |
| **Dispute finding through JSVC review process** | 14-day review; finding may be modified |
| **Reject framework authority** | Individual CMS holders protected; organizational benefits restricted |

### Narrative Containment

**Critical function:** The high-confidence finding prevents indefinite "false flag" narrative:

- Evidence published in non-classified form
- Methodology documented
- Independent verification possible
- Guarantors have factual basis for policy

### Week 1 Review Outcome (Branch B)

**Finding:** Hospital incident attributed to misfire; Israeli procedural compliance adequate; framework holds position:

- Documents incident and launch-site pattern
- Maintains full humanitarian core
- Restricts discretionary benefits to associated networks
- Preserves individual CMS holder protections
- Continues verification at full capacity

**Framework Status:** Steady state. No rollback. Discretionary restrictions applied to networks; individual protections preserved.

---

## Branch C: Hospital Incident Attribution Uncertain

### Attribution Finding

**Day 3 Publication:**

> "The UVB/JSVC rapid assessment is **unable to determine with confidence** (confidence <60%) the cause of the hospital complex incident. Evidentiary limitations:
>
> - Physical access to site denied/delayed
> - Conflicting radar data from multiple sources
> - Fragment analysis inconclusive (insufficient samples)
> - Video evidence shows impact but not origin
>
> **What is known:**
>
> - Time of incident: [timestamp]
> - Casualty count: [number] (per [sources])
> - Deconfliction notification status: [issued/not issued]
> - Medical evacuation status: [obstructed/not obstructed]
>
> **Assessment continues. Updated finding will be issued within 14 days or when evidence threshold is met.**"

### Framework Response to Uncertainty

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Uncertainty with process is credible** | Timeline and methodology published; limitations acknowledged |
| **Procedures assessed independently** | Deconfliction compliance evaluated regardless of attribution |
| **Humanitarian core protected** | Medical/water PCCs maintained regardless of attribution |

### Procedural Consequences Despite Uncertainty

Even without attribution, procedures can be assessed:

| Finding | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| **Deconfliction notification not issued** | Procedural breach documented (regardless of who caused incident) |
| **Medical evacuation obstructed** | Procedural breach documented |
| **Evidence access denied** | Pattern documented; guarantor notification |

### Extended Assessment Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Action |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Day 3-14** | Continued evidence collection | Physical access pursued; additional sources sought |
| **Day 14** | Updated assessment | Revised confidence level; may reach threshold |
| **Day 30** | Final assessment | Determination or permanent "inconclusive" with documented limitations |

### Narrative Management

**Key message:** "We don't know yet" is acceptable when paired with:

- Documented process
- Published timeline
- Acknowledged limitations
- Continued investigation
- Procedural assessment independent of attribution

### Week 1 Review Outcome (Branch C)

**Finding:** Attribution uncertain; procedural compliance partially assessed; framework holds position:

- Maintains humanitarian core
- Applies standard Tier 4 restrictions (time-limited)
- Continues evidence collection
- Documents procedural findings that don't depend on attribution
- Preserves verification credibility by acknowledging uncertainty honestly

**Framework Status:** Steady state with ongoing assessment. Credibility maintained through transparency about limitations.

---

## Cross-Branch Observations

### What Remains Constant Across All Branches

| Function | Status |
|----------|--------|
| **Medical PCC protection** | Maintained in all scenarios |
| **Verification continuity** | Facts documented regardless of attribution |
| **Time-limited restrictions** | Automatic restoration unless extended |
| **Individual CMS protections** | Preserved even when networks restricted |
| **Guarantor notification** | Occurs in all scenarios |

### What Varies by Attribution

| Element | Israeli Attribution | Misfire Attribution | Uncertain |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| **Primary consequence target** | Israeli procedural compliance | Network benefit restrictions | Procedural findings only |
| **Guarantor leverage focus** | Compliance conditionality | Benefit conditionality | Evidence access |
| **Narrative outcome** | Israeli responsibility documented | Misfire documented | Honest uncertainty |
| **Framework posture** | Contracted, documenting breach | Steady, restricting networks | Steady, continuing assessment |

### Key Design Validation

This scenario validates core MCF design principles:

1. **Decoupling:** Security response proceeds independently; framework operates in parallel
2. **Bounded responses:** Restrictions are automatic, proportionate, and time-limited
3. **Procedural focus:** Framework assesses compliance, not legality
4. **External consequences:** Teeth come from guarantors, not internal enforcement
5. **Uncertainty tolerance:** Framework can function without immediate attribution
6. **Humanitarian floor:** Medical and water PCCs protected in all scenarios
