# Scenario 02: Settler Violence Escalation

**Parent Document:** [Concrete Scenarios Overview](00-overview.md)

**Timeline:** Month 14 of Phase 1

**Incident Type:** Sustained violence with perceived official tolerance

**Status:** Draft

---

## Background

Month 14 of Phase 1. MCF mechanisms are operational: UVB/JSVC verification active, PCCs functioning, CMS enrollment underway with several thousand participants. Relations are tense but manageable—until a series of settler attacks in the West Bank triggers escalation.

**Incident Sequence:**

1. Day 1: Armed settlers attack Palestinian village near MCF pilot zone; property destroyed, several Palestinians injured
2. Day 2: Retaliatory stone-throwing; IDF responds with crowd control
3. Day 3: Larger settler group attacks adjacent village; one Palestinian killed
4. Day 4-7: Daily attacks on Palestinian farmers, vehicles, and homes; IDF presence inconsistent
5. Day 8: Attack on Palestinian CMS holder's business; anti-MCF graffiti

**Key Test:** Violence where the attacking party's government is perceived (rightly or wrongly) as tolerating or enabling the violence. The framework must document facts without losing credibility with either side.

---

## Hour 0-6: Initial Attack Documentation

### Automatic Triggers

| System | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Incident classification** | Tier 2 initially (serious harm, single incident) |
| **UVB field notification** | Local monitors alerted |
| **Evidence preservation** | Video, testimony collection begins |
| **CMS registry check** | Verify whether any MCF participants affected |

### UVB First Tasks

1. Dispatch field observers to incident site
2. Collect witness statements with chain-of-custody protocols
3. Request IDF incident reports through deconfliction channels
4. Document damage with geotagged imagery
5. Check whether incident affects any PCC route

### What UVB Does NOT Do

- Intervene in security operations
- Provide protection (that's IDF's role)
- Make political statements about "settler violence" in general
- Assign collective responsibility

---

## Day 1-3: Pattern Development

### Escalation to Tier 3

As attacks continue and fatality occurs:

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Severity** | Elevated to Tier 3 (fatality + pattern) |
| **Pattern** | Multiple incidents in 72 hours indicates coordinated or tolerated activity |
| **MCF participant impact** | Day 8 attack directly targets CMS holder |

### UVB Documentation Protocol

| Category | Content |
|----------|---------|
| **Incident log** | Each attack documented separately with timestamp, location, casualties, property damage |
| **IDF response assessment** | Response times, interventions, arrests documented factually |
| **Perpetrator identification** | Where possible; limitation: most attackers unidentified |
| **Pattern analysis** | Geographic clustering, timing correlation, tactical similarities |

### Critical Stance: Response Assessment

**What UVB documents:**

> "IDF was notified of attack at [time]. Response arrived at [time] ([X] minutes after notification). During the incident, [specific observations]. Following the incident, [arrest/no arrest/other action]."

**What UVB does NOT say:**

- "IDF allowed the attack"
- "Government is complicit"
- "Settlers are terrorists"

**Key principle:** Facts speak. Interpretations are left to readers.

---

## Day 4-7: Sustained Violence and Political Pressure

### Framework Operation During Sustained Attacks

| Mechanism | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Continued documentation** | Each incident recorded; database grows |
| **Response-time tracking** | Creates factual record of intervention patterns |
| **PCC impact assessment** | If routes affected, documented; coordination with Israeli authorities attempted |

### Palestinian Pressure

Palestinian leaders and populations demand MCF "do something":

- Calls to "name and shame" Israel
- Pressure to declare framework failure
- Threats that Palestinian CMS holders will withdraw

### Israeli Pressure

Israeli officials push back:

- Claims UVB is biased toward Palestinian narratives
- Demands equal documentation of Palestinian provocations
- Arguments that violence is response to terrorism, not MCF matter

### MCF Response: Principled Neutrality

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Document everything** | Palestinian stone-throwing documented alongside settler attacks |
| **Response-time equity** | Same methodology applied to all parties |
| **No editorializing** | Facts without adjectives |
| **Timeline commitment** | Regular updates regardless of political pressure |

---

## Day 8: Attack on MCF Participant

### Incident

Armed settlers attack a business owned by a Palestinian CMS holder. The business is damaged; anti-MCF graffiti ("Traitors serve the enemy") sprayed on walls. The CMS holder is assaulted but survives with injuries.

### Elevated Classification

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Severity** | Tier 3 (targeting of MCF participant) |
| **Anti-intimidation trigger** | Explicit targeting of framework participation |
| **Framework integrity** | Direct threat to core MCF function |

### Anti-Intimidation Protocol Activation

Per [Anti-Intimidation Architecture](../../02-phase-1-civic-membership/03-anti-intimidation.md):

| Action | Responsible Party |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Incident documentation** | UVB priority processing |
| **Victim support coordination** | CMS support services activated |
| **Pattern documentation** | Attack linked to anti-MCF motivation |
| **Guarantor notification** | Formal report within 24 hours |

### What Framework Provides

| Support | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| **Documentation** | Attack enters permanent record with anti-intimidation flag |
| **Remote processing** | If local participation unsafe, alternative channels available |
| **Guarantor attention** | Enhanced monitoring of intimidation patterns |
| **No retaliation risk** | CMS status protected regardless of whether participant continues |

### What Framework Does NOT Provide

- Physical protection (remains Israeli responsibility)
- Relocation (not an MCF function)
- Compensation (not an MCF function at Phase 0)

---

## Day 9-14: JSVC Assessment and Findings

### JSVC Week 1 Review

| Assessment Area | Finding Format |
|-----------------|----------------|
| **Incident count** | [X] documented incidents over [Y] days |
| **Casualty summary** | [Deaths], [Injuries], [Property damage] |
| **Response pattern** | Average response time: [X] minutes; arrests: [Y] of [Z] identified perpetrators |
| **PCC impact** | [Specific routes affected/not affected] |
| **MCF participant targeting** | [Number] incidents with anti-MCF motivation documented |

### Publication Standards

**Factual findings published:**

> "Between [dates], UVB documented [X] incidents of violence in [geographic area]. These incidents resulted in [casualties] and [property damage]. IDF response was requested [X] times; response occurred within [timeframe] in [percentage] of cases. [Y] arrests were made. [Z] incidents showed evidence of targeting MCF participation specifically."

**What is NOT published:**

- Characterization of violence as "ethnic cleansing" or similar
- Attribution of motive to Israeli government
- Comparison to other conflicts
- Predictions about future violence

---

## Procedural Consequences

### Consequences for Documented Non-Response

If response-time pattern shows systematic delay or non-intervention:

| Finding | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| **Average response time exceeds threshold** | Guarantor consultation triggered |
| **Pattern of non-arrest despite identified perpetrators** | Pattern report to guarantors |
| **Evidence of coordination with security forces** | Highest-severity finding; immediate guarantor notification |

### Consequences for Anti-MCF Targeting

| Finding | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| **Attacks specifically targeting CMS holders** | Enhanced monitoring; guarantor attention |
| **Pattern of intimidation** | Potential Phase regression assessment |
| **Government tolerance of anti-MCF violence** | Guarantor leverage engagement |

### Guarantor Response Options

| Level | Trigger | Response |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Concern** | Single incident of MCF targeting | Statement of concern; enhanced monitoring |
| **Warning** | Pattern of targeting + inadequate response | Formal demarche; compliance discussion |
| **Conditionality** | Systematic failure to protect MCF participants | Support conditioned on corrective measures |

---

## Branch A: Israeli Government Takes Corrective Action

### Government Response

Following JSVC findings and guarantor pressure:

1. IDF increases presence in affected areas
2. Arrests made of identified perpetrators
3. Public statement condemning attacks on MCF participants
4. Coordination with JSVC on prevention measures

### Framework Response

| Action | Scope |
|--------|-------|
| **Documentation continues** | Improvement documented alongside violations |
| **Compliance assessment** | Updated to reflect corrective measures |
| **Guarantor notification** | Positive trajectory reported |
| **PCC operation** | Normal operation maintained |

### Outcome

**Framework Status:** Steady state. Violence documented; correction documented; credibility maintained with both sides.

---

## Branch B: Israeli Government Denies/Minimizes

### Government Response

Following JSVC findings:

1. Dismisses UVB documentation as biased
2. Blames Palestinian "provocations" for violence
3. No arrests; no enhanced presence
4. Attacks UVB credibility publicly

### Framework Response

| Action | Scope |
|--------|-------|
| **Documentation continues** | Government statements documented alongside facts |
| **Pattern accumulates** | Each incident adds to record |
| **Guarantor engagement** | Formal compliance discussions |
| **Public record** | Facts vs. denials clearly documented |

### Guarantor Leverage

| Mechanism | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Diplomatic** | Private pressure on Israeli government |
| **Conditionality** | Specific support elements conditioned on MCF protection |
| **Public** | If private fails, guarantors may issue public statements |

### Palestinian Response Pressure

Palestinian leaders pressure to declare framework failure. MCF response:

> "The framework documents facts. Those facts show [specific findings]. The framework continues to operate because documentation itself is a service—even when findings are uncomfortable for one party."

### Outcome

**Framework Status:** Contracted credibility with Israeli public; enhanced credibility with Palestinian public; factual record accumulates; guarantor leverage activates. Framework survives but operates under strain.

---

## Branch C: Escalation to Mass Violence

### Scenario Extension

Violence escalates beyond Tier 3:

- Pogrom-style attack on Palestinian village
- Multiple fatalities
- IDF does not intervene despite presence

### Tier 4 Activation

| System | Action |
|--------|--------|
| **Classification** | Tier 4 (mass-casualty event) |
| **JSVC rapid lane** | Activated |
| **Guarantor emergency consultation** | Within 24 hours |
| **Phase regression assessment** | Triggered |

### Phase Regression Consideration

Per [Phase Regression](../03-phase-regression.md), factors assessed:

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Safety threshold breach** | Yes—mass casualties with documented non-intervention |
| **Pattern vs. isolated** | Pattern established over 14+ days |
| **Framework function** | Documentation continues but participation threatened |
| **Voluntary participation** | CMS holders expressing fear of continued participation |

### Regression Options

| Option | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| **Maintain Phase 0** | If violence contained and corrective action credible |
| **Partial rollback** | Suspend CMS expansion in affected zones; maintain verification |
| **Full Phase regression** | If violence systematic and framework cannot function |

### What Regression Looks Like

If 4-of-7 JSVC commissioners certify regression per [Phase Regression Section 3.4](../03-phase-regression.md#34-formal-assessment-process):

1. CMS enrollment paused (not terminated) in affected zones
2. PCCs maintained at humanitarian-only level
3. Verification continues (UVB function preserved)
4. Arbitration paused for non-essential matters
5. Clear restoration conditions published

### Outcome

**Framework Status:** Regression to humanitarian-core mode. Violence succeeded in contracting framework but not destroying it. Documentation continues; restoration path preserved.

## Success Criteria

After a sustained settler violence episode, the framework:

- [ ] Still exists
- [ ] Still publishes facts (including uncomfortable ones for Israel)
- [ ] Still protects participating CMS holders' status (even if physical protection failed)
- [ ] Still has participants willing to continue (even if numbers decline)
- [ ] Still has guarantor engagement

**What MCF Does NOT Do:**

- Prevent settler attacks
- Provide physical protection
- Force Israeli government to act
- "Solve" settler violence

**What MCF Prevents:**

- Total narrative free-for-all where facts are disputed indefinitely
- Permanent undocumented impunity
- Complete collapse of any shared procedural framework

---

## Key Design Validation

This scenario validates:

1. **Procedural neutrality:** Documentation standards apply equally regardless of perpetrator identity
2. **Fact-based credibility:** "IDF responded in [X] minutes" is more useful than "IDF allowed violence"
3. **Anti-intimidation function:** Targeting MCF participants triggers elevated response
4. **Guarantor leverage:** External consequences matter when internal cooperation fails
5. **Regression as feature:** Framework survives by contracting rather than collapsing
6. **Documentation persistence:** Facts accumulate even when denied
