# Concrete Scenarios

**Parent Document:** [Stress Testing](../14-stress-testing.md)

**Phase:** Phase 0-1 (institutional setup through early civic membership)

**Objective:** Detailed operational walkthroughs showing how MCF mechanisms respond to specific crisis scenarios.

**Status:** Draft

---

## Purpose

This directory translates stress tests into concrete operational timelines. Where [Stress Testing](../14-stress-testing.md) asks "What breaks?", these scenarios ask "What happens hour by hour?"

**Design Philosophy:**

MCF does not prevent violence. It prevents violence from destroying the procedural layer. These scenarios show the framework operating during its worst days—not succeeding by stopping attacks, but surviving by maintaining verification, protecting core corridors, and preserving options for the day after.

## Common Elements

### What All Scenarios Test

1. **Decoupling:** Does security response proceed while framework operates in parallel?
2. **Bounded Responses:** Are restrictions automatic, proportionate, and time-limited?
3. **Verification Continuity:** Does factual documentation continue?
4. **Humanitarian Floor:** Are medical and water PCCs protected?
5. **Uncertainty Tolerance:** Can framework function without immediate attribution?

### Standard Timeline Phases

| Phase | Duration | Focus |
|-------|----------|-------|
| **Immediate** | 0-2 hours | Activation, deconfliction, evidence preservation |
| **Short-term** | 2-24 hours | PCC protection mode, preliminary reporting |
| **Medium-term** | 24-72 hours | Attribution work, interim findings |
| **Review** | Day 3-7 | Formal severity assessment, rollback evaluation |
| **Restoration** | Week 2+ | De-escalation, service restoration |

### Success Criteria

After any crisis, the framework:

- [ ] Still exists
- [ ] Still publishes facts
- [ ] Still protects at least one corridor
- [ ] Still has participants who believe it can outlast the crisis
