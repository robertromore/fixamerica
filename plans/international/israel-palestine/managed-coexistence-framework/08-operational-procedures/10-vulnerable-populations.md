# Vulnerable Populations Protections

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md)

**Phase:** All Phases

**Status:** Draft

---

## Purpose

Vulnerable Populations Protections defines MCF's approach to **population groups with heightened protection needs**—children, women, disabled persons, and elderly individuals who face additional barriers to participation or risks within the conflict environment.

MCF's general protections apply to all participants. This document specifies additional measures for populations where standard protections are insufficient due to power imbalances, physical vulnerability, or discriminatory social structures.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Baseline Plus Enhancement

Vulnerable populations receive all standard CRC protections plus additional measures tailored to their circumstances.

**What This Means:**

- No reduction of general rights for vulnerable populations
- Additional protections layered on top
- Enhanced access to services
- Priority in protection decisions

### 2. Agency Preservation

Protections enhance rather than replace individual agency. Vulnerable does not mean incapable.

**What This Means:**

- Supported decision-making over substituted judgment
- Consent still required (with appropriate support)
- Participation encouraged where safe
- No paternalistic exclusion

### 3. Intersectionality Recognition

Individuals may belong to multiple vulnerable categories. Protections address compound vulnerability.

**What This Means:**

- Disabled women face different barriers than disabled men
- Elderly Palestinians face different risks than elderly Israelis
- Children with disabilities require combined protections
- Assessment considers full context

### 4. Non-Discrimination in Protection

Protection measures do not create new discrimination or stigma.

**What This Means:**

- Confidential accommodation processes
- No public identification of vulnerability status
- Protection without isolation
- Integration as goal

## Women's Protections

### 1. Gender-Based Violence Response

**Covered:**

**Response Mechanisms:**

| Element | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| **Reporting** | Confidential channels; female responders available |
| **Protection** | Emergency safe housing; relocation assistance |
| **Justice** | Specialized investigation; trauma-informed process |
| **Support** | Medical care; psychosocial support; legal aid |

**Cross-Community Dimension:**

- MCF provides gap-filling where community systems fail

### 2. Family Law Interface

**Challenge:**

Israeli and Palestinian family law systems differ significantly on marriage, divorce, custody, and inheritance. MCF cannot override either system.

**MCF Approach:**

| Issue | MCF Role |
|-------|----------|
| **Marriage** | Recognition for MCF purposes of marriages valid in either system |
| **Divorce** | No MCF authority; support access to appropriate forum |
| **Custody** | Enforce existing orders; not adjudicate disputes |
| **Inheritance** | No MCF authority; facilitate access to appropriate forum |

**Protections Within Family Law Limits:**

- GBV protection regardless of family law status
- Economic rights (employment, property) independent of marital status
- CMS independent of spousal status
- Exit support without requiring divorce

### 3. Participation Barriers

**Identified Barriers:**

- Mobility restrictions (social, security)
- Caregiving responsibilities
- Economic dependence
- Social pressure against participation

**MCF Responses:**

| Barrier | Response |
|---------|----------|
| **Mobility** | Women-priority PCC schedules; female escorts available |
| **Caregiving** | Childcare support for MCF participation |
| **Economic** | Independent economic benefits access |
| **Social pressure** | Confidential participation options |

### 4. Representation

**In MCF Institutions:**

- Gender balance targets in MCF staffing
- Female representation on all panels affecting women
- Gender expertise in relevant positions
- Gender impact assessment for policies

**Not Required:**

- Gender quotas in party delegations (party decision)
- Parity in all circumstances
- Gender balance over competence
