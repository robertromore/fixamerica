# Operational Procedures: Overview

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md) (Parts III and VII)

**Applies To:** All Phases

**Objective:** Provide detailed procedures for risk management, phase transitions, crisis response, and framework evolution.

---

## Purpose of This Section

This directory contains operational procedures that govern MCF's day-to-day functioning and long-term evolution. These are the **implementation details** that translate MCF principles into actionable protocols.

These procedures are designed to be **automatic and predictable**, reducing the scope for political manipulation and ensuring institutional continuity across leadership changes.

## Risk Management Principles (from Introduction)

- Extremist sabotage anticipated at all phases
- No single leader can collapse the framework unilaterally
- Automatic procedural responses replace ad hoc political reactions
- External guarantors provide credibility without governance control

---

## Phase Transition Criteria (from Introduction)

Transitions require:

- Multi-year stability benchmarks
- Verified achievement of phase success criteria
- Demand for next-phase mechanisms
- Guarantor certification

Transitions are **not automatic**: meeting criteria enables transition but does not require it.

---

## Phase Regression Triggers (from Introduction)

Regression occurs when:

- Safety thresholds are breached
- Institutional legitimacy collapses
- External interference exceeds manageable levels
- Voluntary participation declines below viability

Regression is **procedural, not political**: it follows pre-defined protocols, not ad hoc decisions.

---

## Rollback as Feature (from Introduction)

Rollback mechanisms are a **feature, not a vulnerability**:

- Framework survives by shrinking its footprint
- Institutional memory is preserved
- Spoilers are denied the victory of total derailment
- Recovery pathways remain open

---

## Amendment and Evolution (from Introduction)

MCF can evolve through:

- Layered change mechanisms at different levels
- Supermajority requirements for fundamental changes
- Guarantor oversight of amendment processes
- Minority protections against majoritarian capture

---

## Exit Conditions (from Introduction)

MCF does not define a single end state. Possible outcomes include:

- Permanent confederation
- Federation
- Dual-state system with strong confederal layer
- Partial rollback to earlier phases
- Full dissolution if conditions warrant

Success is defined as **sustained stability and voluntary participation**, not achievement of any particular political outcome.
