## 1. Risk Management Principles

### 1.1 Core Philosophy

MCF risk management operates on the principle that **failure is inevitable but collapse is preventable**. The framework is designed to:

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Anticipate** | Identify risks before they materialize; never assume good faith from all actors |
| **Absorb** | Design systems that bend without breaking; contain failures at their origin |
| **Adapt** | Learn from failures and near-misses; continuously improve resilience |
| **Preserve** | Protect institutional memory and capacity even during contraction |

### 1.2 Design Assumptions

MCF risk management assumes:

1. **Hostile actors exist**: Extremists on both sides will attempt sabotage
2. **Leaders change**: Political support is not guaranteed across election cycles
3. **Crises occur**: Natural, health, and economic emergencies are inevitable
4. **Guarantors vary**: External support may fluctuate based on their domestic politics
5. **Institutions fail**: Any single institution may be captured, corrupted, or incapacitated

### 1.3 Resilience Architecture

Resilience is built through:

| Mechanism | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Redundancy** | No single point of failure for critical functions |
| **Modularity** | Components can fail independently without cascading collapse |
| **Reversibility** | Phase regression preserves institutional capacity |
| **Externalization** | Guarantor backing provides resources beyond local capacity |
| **Proceduralism** | Automatic responses reduce scope for political manipulation |

### 1.4 Risk Ownership

| Risk Domain | Primary Owner | Secondary Owner |
|-------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Security risks | JSVC | Guarantor security coordinators |
| Political risks | MCF Executive | Guarantor diplomatic liaisons |
| Institutional risks | JSVC Executive Director | Audit and oversight functions |
| External risks | Guarantor committee | MCF Executive |

## 3. Risk Assessment Methodology

### 3.1 Assessment Framework

MCF uses a standardized risk assessment framework:

#### 3.1.1 Probability Scale

| Rating | Description | Indicative Frequency |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Very Low** | Unlikely to occur during MCF lifespan | <5% in 10 years |
| **Low** | Possible but not expected | 5-20% in 10 years |
| **Medium** | Reasonably likely to occur | 20-50% in 10 years |
| **High** | Expected to occur | 50-80% in 10 years |
| **Very High** | Almost certain to occur | >80% in 10 years |

#### 3.1.2 Impact Scale

| Rating | Description | Indicators |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Minor** | Localized effect; routine response sufficient | Single incident; <10 affected; normal capacity handles |
| **Moderate** | Significant effect; enhanced response required | Multiple incidents or locations; 10-100 affected; strain on capacity |
| **Severe** | Major effect; emergency response required | Widespread impact; 100-1,000 affected; capacity overwhelmed |
| **Catastrophic** | Existential threat to MCF or mass casualties | >1,000 affected; institutional survival threatened; phase regression required |

#### 3.1.3 Risk Matrix

|  | Minor | Moderate | Severe | Catastrophic |
|--|-------|----------|--------|--------------|
| **Very High** | Medium | High | Critical | Critical |
| **High** | Low | Medium | High | Critical |
| **Medium** | Low | Medium | High | Critical |
| **Low** | Negligible | Low | Medium | High |
| **Very Low** | Negligible | Negligible | Low | Medium |

### 3.2 Assessment Process

#### 3.2.1 Continuous Monitoring

| Monitoring Type | Frequency | Responsibility |
|-----------------|-----------|----------------|

## 4. Prevention and Mitigation

### 4.1 Mitigation Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Defense in depth** | Multiple layers of protection; no single barrier relied upon |
| **Fail-safe design** | Failure modes that minimize harm; safe defaults |
| **Active monitoring** | Early warning systems; continuous observation |
| **Rapid response** | Pre-positioned resources; pre-authorized actions |

### 4.2 Security Risk Mitigation

#### 4.2.1 Anti-Sabotage Measures

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Violence against participants** | Anti-intimidation architecture; confidentiality protections; rapid response teams |
| **Mass casualty attacks** | Intelligence sharing; security coordination; mass casualty protocols |
| **Assassination** | Personal security for key figures; succession planning; distributed leadership |
| **Infrastructure sabotage** | Physical security; redundant systems; rapid repair capacity |

#### 4.2.2 Escalation Prevention

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Tit-for-tat cycles** | Shock-absorber protocols; automatic de-escalation triggers; JSVC coordination |
| **Regional spillover** | Guarantor engagement with regional actors; diplomatic channels |
| **Miscalculation** | Clear communication protocols; verification before response; hotlines |

### 4.3 Political Risk Mitigation

#### 4.3.1 Government-Resilience Design

MCF is designed to survive hostile governments through:

| Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| **Guarantor lock-in** | International commitments create exit costs |
| **Domestic constituencies** | Participation creates stakeholders who resist rollback |
| **Procedural entrenchment** | Amendment procedures require supermajorities |
| **Institutional inertia** | Operating institutions resist discontinuation |
| **Information transparency** | Public awareness of MCF benefits creates political cost to abandonment |

#### 4.3.2 Policy Reversal Prevention

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Formal withdrawal** | Withdrawal procedures with cooling-off periods; guarantor involvement |
| **Passive non-implementation** | Monitoring and reporting; guarantor pressure; graduated responses |
| **Regulatory obstruction** | Clear legal frameworks; appeal mechanisms; guarantor certification |

### 4.4 Institutional Risk Mitigation

#### 4.4.1 Anti-Capture Measures

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Staff capture** | Balanced recruitment; rotation policies; external oversight |
| **Process capture** | Dual-key requirements; audit trails; guarantor verification |
| **Information capture** | Multiple information sources; external verification; transparency requirements |

#### 4.4.2 Anti-Corruption Measures

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Financial corruption** | Auditing; segregation of duties; guarantor financial oversight |
| **Procurement corruption** | Competitive bidding; external procurement agents; audit |
| **Access corruption** | Standardized criteria; appeal mechanisms; random audits |

### 4.5 External Risk Mitigation

#### 4.5.1 Guarantor Resilience

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Guarantor withdrawal** | Diversified guarantor base; no single-guarantor dependency |
| **Guarantor conflict** | Consensus mechanisms with fallback to rotation; mediation |
| **Guarantor distraction** | Institutional continuity; professional staff; reduced dependence on political attention |

#### 4.5.2 Economic Resilience

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Global recession** | Reserve funds; reduced ambition during downturns; essential-only operations |
| **Aid dependency** | Diversified funding sources; local revenue generation; graduated self-sufficiency |
| **Trade disruption** | Strategic reserves; alternative suppliers; local production capacity |

### 4.6 Early Warning Indicators

MCF maintains early warning indicators for major risk categories:

| Risk Category | Key Indicators |
|---------------|----------------|
| **Security escalation** | Incident frequency; severity trends; rhetoric intensity; troop movements |
| **Political reversal** | Polling data; coalition stability; key figure statements; legislative activity |
| **Institutional health** | Staff morale; turnover rates; complaint volumes; audit findings |
| **External stability** | Guarantor domestic politics; regional tensions; economic indicators |

## 5. Failure Containment

### 5.1 Containment Principles

When failures occur, MCF prioritizes:

| Priority | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Life safety** | Protect lives first; accept institutional damage if necessary |
| **Scope limitation** | Prevent failure from spreading to unaffected areas or functions |
| **Institutional preservation** | Maintain core capacity for recovery |
| **Information preservation** | Protect records and institutional memory |

### 5.2 Automatic Containment Triggers

Certain failures trigger **automatic containment procedures** without requiring deliberation:

| Trigger | Automatic Response |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Tier 4+ security incident** | Shock-absorber full activation; PCC emergency mode |
| **Level 3+ humanitarian crisis** | EOC activation; humanitarian coordinator appointment |
| **Communication system failure** | Backup system activation; emergency protocols |
| **Critical personnel incapacitation** | Succession procedures; alternate authority activation |

### 5.3 Manual Containment Authority

For failures not meeting automatic triggers, containment decisions are made by:

| Failure Scope | Authority | Consultation Required |
|---------------|-----------|----------------------|
| **Localized** | JSVC Operations Chief | Notification to Executive Director |
| **Multi-area** | JSVC Executive Director | Notification to parties and guarantors |
| **Institution-wide** | JSVC + party representatives | Guarantor notification |
| **Framework-threatening** | Guarantor committee | Full stakeholder notification |

### 5.4 Containment Mechanisms

#### 5.4.1 Operational Containment

| Mechanism | Description | Authority |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Activity suspension** | Temporary halt to specific MCF activities | Operations Chief |
| **Geographic isolation** | Limit operations in affected area | Executive Director |
| **Personnel evacuation** | Remove MCF personnel from danger | Operations Chief |
| **System isolation** | Disconnect compromised systems | IT Security |

#### 5.4.2 Institutional Containment

| Mechanism | Description | Authority |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Authority delegation** | Transfer authority to unaffected unit | Executive Director |
| **Resource reallocation** | Redirect resources from affected to unaffected functions | Executive Director |
| **External handover** | Transfer functions to guarantor or external actor | Guarantor committee |

#### 5.4.3 Phase Regression

The ultimate containment mechanism is **phase regression**—contracting MCF scope to preserve core functions. See [Phase Regression Protocols](03-phase-regression.md).

Phase regression is containment, not failure:

- Regression preserves institutional capacity
- Recovery pathways remain open
- Spoilers are denied total victory
- Framework survives by shrinking

### 5.5 Containment Communication

During containment:

| Audience | Communication Priority | Timeline |
|----------|----------------------|----------|
| **Affected personnel** | Safety instructions | Immediate |
| **All MCF personnel** | Situation awareness | Within 1 hour |
| **Parties** | Formal notification | Within 2 hours |
| **Guarantors** | Situation report | Within 4 hours |
| **Public** | As appropriate | Per communication protocols |

### 5.6 Mass Casualty Event Protocols

Mass casualty events require specialized response beyond standard containment. This section covers terrorism, natural disasters, and epidemics.

#### 5.6.1 Terrorism/Mass Attack Events

**Definition:** Deliberate attack causing or intended to cause casualties exceeding 50, or targeting symbolic MCF locations/personnel.

**Immediate Response (0-6 hours):**

| Action | Authority | Timeline |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Scene security** | JSVC Security; party coordination | Immediate |
| **Casualty triage** | Medical coordinators; PCCs to medical | Immediate |
| **MCF personnel accountability** | All units report to EOC | Within 2 hours |
| **Communication lockdown** | Verified information only | Immediate |
| **Guarantor notification** | Emergency channel activation | Within 1 hour |

**Stabilization Phase (6-72 hours):**

| Action | Authority | Timeline |
|--------|-----------|----------|
| **Family notification** | Coordinated with parties | Within 24 hours |
| **Evidence preservation** | Documentation for accountability | Immediate |
| **Public communication** | Factual, verified information | Per protocol |
| **Escalation prevention** | Shock-absorber full activation | Automatic |
| **Victim support** | Medical, psychological, logistical | Ongoing |

**Special Considerations:**

- Mass attacks designed to trigger escalation require immediate de-escalation messaging
- Attribution process must be rigorous—rushed attribution enables manipulation
- Victim lists verified before release; no speculation
- MCF operations continue in unaffected areas

#### 5.6.2 Natural Disasters

**Definition:** Earthquake, severe weather, flooding, or other natural events causing significant casualties or infrastructure damage.

**Earthquake Protocols:**

| Phase | Actions |
|-------|---------|
| **Immediate (0-24 hours)** | Personnel safety check; damage assessment; search and rescue coordination |
| **Short-term (24-72 hours)** | Shelter coordination; medical surge; infrastructure assessment |
| **Medium-term (72+ hours)** | Operations resumption; reconstruction planning |

**Severe Weather/Flooding:**

| Phase | Actions |
|-------|---------|
| **Warning** | Early warning dissemination; PCC closure if needed; shelter activation |
| **During event** | Emergency services coordination; evacuation support |
| **Post-event** | Damage assessment; humanitarian response; operations resumption |

**MCF-Specific Concerns:**

- PCC infrastructure damage assessment and repair priority
- Cross-community search and rescue coordination
- Humanitarian response that doesn't discriminate by community
- Operations continuity in unaffected areas

#### 5.6.3 Epidemic/Pandemic Protocols

**Definition:** Disease outbreak requiring public health emergency response.

**Activation Levels:**

| Level | Criteria | Response |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **Watch** | Disease outbreak in region; no local cases | Enhanced monitoring; preparation |
| **Alert** | Local cases confirmed; limited spread | Precautionary measures; coordination |
| **Emergency** | Widespread transmission; MCF operations affected | Modified operations; full response |

**Response Measures:**

| Measure | Trigger | Authority |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| **Enhanced hygiene** | Watch level | Automatic |
| **Screening at PCCs** | Alert level | JSVC Health |
| **PCC modifications** | Alert level | Operations Chief |
| **Remote operations** | Emergency level | Executive Director |
| **Facility closures** | Emergency level; health authority guidance | Executive Director |
| **Personnel protection** | Emergency level | All supervisors |

**MCF-Specific Epidemic Concerns:**

- PCCs as potential disease transmission points—modification, not closure if possible
- Cross-community health coordination essential
- CMS holders' access to healthcare regardless of location
- Quarantine measures that don't become collective punishment
- Epidemic cannot become pretext for permanent access restrictions

**Post-Epidemic Recovery:**

- Graduated reopening per health authority guidance
- Trust rebuilding if measures were contentious
- Lessons learned for future preparedness

#### 5.6.4 Mass Casualty Coordination

**Coordination Structure:**

| Function | Lead | Support |
|----------|------|---------|
| **Overall coordination** | JSVC Executive Director | EOC staff |
| **Security** | JSVC Security Chief | Party security liaison |
| **Medical** | MCF Medical Coordinator | Health facility coordination |
| **Communication** | Communication Director | Press Office |
| **Logistics** | Operations Chief | Guarantor logistics |
| **Family/victims** | Designated liaison | Counseling support |

**Inter-Party Coordination:**

Mass casualty events require coordination between Israeli and Palestinian response systems. MCF facilitates but does not command:

| Function | MCF Role |
|----------|----------|
| **Information sharing** | Real-time situation updates |
| **Access coordination** | PCC emergency access |
| **Resource coordination** | Cross-community medical surge |
| **Communication** | Unified factual messaging |

**Guarantor Support Activation:**

| Resource | Trigger | Timeline |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **Medical teams** | Casualty threshold exceeded | 24-48 hours |
| **Logistics support** | Infrastructure damage | 24-48 hours |
| **Financial support** | Emergency expenses | 72 hours |
| **Expert support** | Specialized needs | As arranged |
