## 1. Regression Principles

### 1.1 Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Rollback as feature** | Regression is a designed survival mechanism, not evidence of failure |
| **Presumption-based** | Threshold breach triggers regression unless override is affirmatively justified |
| **Modular and proportional** | Regression can be geographic, sector-specific, or component-limited |
| **Memory-preserving** | Institutional records, eligibility histories, and verification findings survive regression |
| **Recovery-oriented** | Regression preserves pathways for re-advancement without starting over |

### 1.2 Why Rollback Is a Feature

Traditional peace processes treat any reversal as catastrophic failure. This creates:

| Problem | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| **Escalation lock-in** | Parties cannot retreat from untenable positions |
| **Spoiler triumph** | Single derailment destroys entire framework |
| **All-or-nothing psychology** | Progress must be linear or is perceived as meaningless |
| **Political paralysis** | Fear of reversal prevents initial engagement |

**MCF inverts this logic:** Regression is expected, bounded, and survivable. Spoilers cannot win by causing temporary setbacks. The framework shrinks its footprint during instability rather than collapsing entirely.

### 1.3 Presumption-Based Model

Regression is **not purely automatic**, but it is also **not discretionary in a political sense**.

When predefined failure thresholds are met and certified by the verification layer:

```text
PRESUMPTION-BASED REGRESSION

Default: Regression procedures automatically initiated

Override requires:
├── Joint affirmation by ≥5/7 JSVC commissioners
├── Unanimous guarantor concurrence
├── Published justification explaining:
│   ├── Why threshold breach is temporary/anomalous
│   ├── What specific conditions justify delay
│   └── What timeline for conditions to resolve
├── Maximum override duration: 90 days
└── One extension permitted (90 days additional maximum)

If override expires without resolution: Regression proceeds automatically
```

This **flips the burden of proof**: The system asks "can rollback be safely delayed?" rather than "should we roll back?"

### 1.4 What Regression Does and Does Not Do

**Regression Does:**

- Shrink active MCF scope to sustainable level
- Preserve core institutional capabilities
- Protect participant safety during drawdown
- Maintain verification and documentation functions
- Deny spoilers the victory of total framework collapse

**Regression Does NOT:**

- Invalidate earlier verification findings
- Reset institutional memory or eligibility records
- Punish participants for environmental factors
- Require starting over for re-advancement
- Signal moral judgment about communities or parties

Regression reflects **environmental volatility, not moral failure**.

### 1.5 Relationship to Phase Transitions

Transitions and regressions are **procedurally symmetric but substantively asymmetric**:

| Dimension | Advancement | Regression |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **Trigger type** | Positive achievement of thresholds | Negative breach of thresholds |
| **Default action** | Automatic upon certification | Automatic upon breach confirmation |
| **Override** | Emergency delay possible | Emergency continuation possible |
| **Standard** | Affirmative demonstration required | Presumption of failure until resolved |
| **Recovery** | N/A | Accelerated re-advancement available |

See [Phase Transition Criteria](02-phase-transitions.md) for advancement procedures.

## 3. Trigger Assessment Architecture

### 3.1 Assessment Authority

The JSVC serves as the **assessment authority** for regression triggers, consistent with its role in phase transitions.

| Function | JSVC Does | JSVC Does NOT |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| **Measurement** | Collect and verify threshold metrics | Exercise political judgment |
| **Certification** | Certify when thresholds are breached | Decide whether regression is desirable |
| **Process initiation** | Trigger automatic procedures | Have discretionary delay authority |

The JSVC is a **referee, not a gatekeeper** for regression as for advancement.

### 3.2 Continuous Monitoring

```text
REGRESSION MONITORING SYSTEM

Daily:
├── Incident tracking and classification
├── PCC operational status
├── Emergency alert monitoring
└── Real-time security dashboard

Weekly:
├── Escalation pattern analysis
├── Participation metrics update
├── Guarantor status check
└── Threshold proximity assessment

Monthly:
├── Comprehensive stability report
├── Trend analysis (rolling averages)
├── External interference assessment
└── Resource status review

Quarterly:
├── Full threshold audit
├── Institutional legitimacy assessment
├── Guarantor capacity review

```

### 3.3 Threshold Proximity Warnings

| Status | Definition | Action |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **Green** | All metrics ≥20% margin from thresholds | Normal operations |
| **Yellow** | Any metric within 20% of threshold | Enhanced monitoring; preventive measures |
| **Orange** | Any metric within 10% of threshold | Warning published; contingency planning activated |
| **Red** | Any metric at or past threshold | Formal assessment initiated |

Proximity warnings are published in monthly stability reports and trigger escalating notification protocols.

### 3.4 Formal Assessment Process

```text
REGRESSION ASSESSMENT PROCESS

Trigger: Metric crosses threshold level (Red status)

Step 1: Data Verification (7 days)
├── JSVC verifies measurement accuracy
├── External auditor review
├── Data quality assessment
└── Preliminary report

Step 2: Pattern Assessment (14 days)
├── Is breach temporary/anomalous or sustained?
├── What is trajectory (improving, stable, worsening)?
├── Are multiple thresholds affected?
└── What is likely duration?

Step 3: Scope Determination (7 days)
├── Which phases/components are affected?
├── What regression depth is appropriate?
├── What geographic scope applies?
└── What can be preserved?

Step 4: Commission Decision (7 days)
├── JSVC Commission reviews assessment
├── Vote on threshold certification
├── 4 of 7 required to certify breach
└── If certified: Regression procedures initiated

Step 5: Override Window (30 days)
├── Override requires ≥5/7 JSVC + unanimous guarantors
├── Published justification required
├── If no override: Regression proceeds at day 30
└── If override: Maximum 90-day delay; one extension permitted

Total Assessment Timeline: 35-65 days (absent override)
```

### 3.5 Emergency Assessment

For emergency regression triggers (active widespread conflict, guarantor evacuation), the standard assessment process is compressed:

```text
EMERGENCY REGRESSION ASSESSMENT

Trigger: Emergency threshold crossed

Step 1: Emergency Verification (48 hours)
├── JSVC Executive Director confirms trigger condition
├── Guarantor military/security liaisons consulted
└── Preliminary scope determination

Step 2: Emergency Commission Decision (72 hours)
├── JSVC Commission emergency session (virtual permitted)
├── 5 of 7 required for emergency certification
└── If certified: Emergency regression implemented immediately

Step 3: Retroactive Review (30 days post-implementation)
├── Full assessment of decision appropriateness
├── Documentation for institutional learning
└── Recovery planning initiated

Total Emergency Timeline: ≤5 days
```

## 4. Phase-Specific Regression Criteria

### 4.1 Phase 3 to Phase 2 Regression

**Context:** Phase 3 involves voluntary convergence mechanisms—potential path to deeper political integration. Regression means suspending convergence mechanisms while preserving SAZ operations.

#### 4.1.1 Specific Triggers

| Trigger | Threshold | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **Convergence referendum rejection** | <40% approval or <50% participation in scheduled referendum | Insufficient mandate for convergence path |
| **Integration mechanism failure** | ≥3 convergence pilots fail within 24 months | Convergence not operationally viable |
| **Political consensus collapse** | Parties formally withdraw from convergence negotiations | No basis for continued convergence work |
| **Inter-SAZ conflict** | Sustained conflict between SAZs not resolved by confederal mechanisms | Convergence premature |

#### 4.1.2 What Regresses

- Convergence referendum scheduling suspended
- Joint sovereignty pilots suspended
- Political integration negotiations paused
- Convergence planning bodies dormant

#### 4.1.3 What Persists

- All SAZ operations continue
- Phase 2 governance unchanged
- CMS system continues
- All verification and arbitration functions

### 4.2 Phase 2 to Phase 1 Regression

**Context:** Phase 2 involves territorial SAZ operations. Regression means suspending SAZ governance while preserving individual civic participation.

#### 4.2.1 Specific Triggers

| Category | Triggers |
|----------|----------|
| **Security** | SAZ internal security failure; violence exceeding baseline thresholds; protection guarantees unenforceable |
| **Governance** | SAZ governance capture; electoral manipulation; judicial system collapse |
| **Participation** | Population exodus; residency below viability threshold |
| **External** | Surrounding governments withdraw access; regional conflict engulfs SAZ |

#### 4.2.2 Regression Scope Options

Regression can be:

| Scope | Description | When Applied |
|-------|-------------|--------------|
| **Full SAZ regression** | All SAZs suspended | Systemic failure affecting all SAZs |
| **Specific SAZ regression** | One or more SAZs suspended; others continue | Localized failure |
| **SAZ function regression** | Specific SAZ functions suspended (e.g., residential) while others continue | Partial failure |

#### 4.2.3 What Regresses (Full SAZ Regression)

- SAZ territorial governance suspended
- SAZ councils dissolved or dormant
- SAZ-specific residency benefits suspended
- SAZ police forces restructured or dissolved

#### 4.2.4 What Persists

- CMS status of former SAZ residents preserved
- CMS benefits continue (employment, arbitration, credential portability)
- Verification bodies continue
- Eligibility records preserved for potential re-advancement

### 4.3 Phase 1 to Phase 0 Regression

**Context:** Phase 1 involves individual CMS participation. Regression means suspending civic membership operations while preserving security infrastructure.

#### 4.3.1 Specific Triggers

| Category | Triggers |
|----------|----------|
| **Security** | CMS holders systematically targeted; participation creates unacceptable risk |
| **Participation** | Enrollment collapse below viability; mass voluntary withdrawal |
| **Legitimacy** | CMS system perceived as captured or illegitimate by one or both communities |
| **Infrastructure** | Confederal courts non-functional; credential portability systems failed |

#### 4.3.2 What Regresses

- New CMS enrollment suspended
- CMS benefit programs suspended
- Confederal arbitration courts suspended (new cases)
- Employment programs suspended

#### 4.3.3 What Persists

- Existing CMS status preserved (dormant)
- Eligibility records preserved
- JSVC verification continues
- PCC operations continue
- Shock-absorber protocols continue

#### 4.3.4 Participant Protection

CMS holders during Phase 1→0 regression receive:

| Protection | Mechanism |
|------------|-----------|
| **Non-retaliation** | Status confidentiality maintained; no disclosure to authorities |
| **Benefit wind-down** | Orderly termination of ongoing benefits; no abrupt cutoffs |
| **Employer notification** | Employers notified that worker status is suspended, not revoked |
| **Record preservation** | Participation history preserved for potential restoration |

### 4.4 Phase 0 Suspension

**Context:** Phase 0 involves security deconfliction infrastructure. Suspension means MCF operational pause while preserving institutional existence.

#### 4.4.1 Specific Triggers

| Trigger | Threshold | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **Complete guarantor withdrawal** | All guarantors withdraw | No external credibility or enforcement capacity |
| **Active war** | Conventional military conflict between parties | MCF cannot operate during active warfare |
| **Institutional collapse** | JSVC unable to function for 6+ months | No verification capacity |
| **Catastrophic security failure** | PCC network destroyed or abandoned | No operational infrastructure |

#### 4.4.2 What Suspends

- All MCF operations paused
- Personnel evacuated or reassigned
- Facilities placed in caretaker status
- Active programs terminated

#### 4.4.3 What Persists (Minimum Preservation)

- JSVC legal existence preserved
- Institutional documentation archived
- Guarantor treaty obligations remain (even if suspended)
- Re-activation procedures defined
- Personnel database maintained

### 4.5 Regression Depth Summary

```text
REGRESSION DEPTH LADDER

Phase 3 (Convergence)
    ↓ Convergence mechanisms suspended
Phase 2 (SAZ)
    ↓ Territorial governance suspended
Phase 1 (CMS)
    ↓ Individual participation suspended
Phase 0 (Security Infrastructure)
    ↓ Security coordination suspended
Suspension (Institutional Preservation Only)
```

## 6. Partial and Modular Regression

### 6.1 Principle of Proportionality

Regression is **modular and proportional**, not binary.

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Minimum necessary scope** | Regress only what is required to address the trigger |
| **Preserve what works** | Functioning components continue even if others regress |
| **Geographic differentiation** | Regression can apply to some territories but not others |
| **Function differentiation** | Regression can apply to some functions but not others |

### 6.2 Geographic Regression

When failure is localized, regression can be geographically limited:

| Scenario | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| **Single SAZ failure** | Regress that SAZ only; others continue |
| **Regional instability** | Regress affected region; stable regions continue |
| **Gaza/West Bank divergence** | Regression in one territory; other continues |
| **External SAZ failure** | External SAZ regresses; internal operations continue |

#### 6.2.1 Geographic Regression Requirements

- Clear geographic boundaries for regression scope
- Mechanisms to prevent spillover
- Continued verification in regressed areas
- Recovery pathways specific to regressed geography

### 6.3 Functional Regression

When failure is sector-specific, regression can be functionally limited:

| Function | Can Regress Independently? | Example |
|----------|---------------------------|---------|
| **SAZ residential** | Yes | Security failure affecting residential areas only |
| **SAZ commercial** | Yes | Commercial governance failure |
| **Employment programs** | Yes | Employment verification compromise |
| **Credential portability** | Yes | Credential fraud or system failure |
| **Arbitration courts** | Yes | Judicial capture or capacity collapse |

#### 6.3.1 Functional Regression Requirements

- Clear functional boundaries
- Mechanisms to continue related functions
- User communication about partial functionality
- Recovery pathways specific to regressed function

### 6.4 Asymmetric Regression

Regression can apply asymmetrically across communities:

| Scenario | Approach |
|----------|----------|
| **One-sided spoiler success** | Regression may affect one community's participation more than other |
| **Geographic asymmetry** | Gaza regression does not require West Bank regression |
| **Institutional asymmetry** | Israeli-side institutions may regress while Palestinian-side continues or vice versa |

**Constraint:** Asymmetric regression must not:

- Permanently disadvantage one community
- Create irreversible disparities
- Reward spoiler behavior with captured territory or institutions

---

## 7. Institutional Preservation

### 7.1 Preservation Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Memory over activity** | Even suspended institutions preserve records and knowledge |
| **Legal continuity** | Institutional legal existence preserved through regression |
| **Personnel retention** | Core personnel retained in reduced capacity when possible |
| **Infrastructure caretaking** | Physical assets maintained even if not operational |

### 7.2 What Must Be Preserved

#### 7.2.1 Documentation Preservation

| Category | Preservation Requirement |
|----------|-------------------------|
| **Verification records** | All JSVC findings archived; never destroyed |
| **Eligibility histories** | CMS eligibility records preserved indefinitely |
| **Incident documentation** | Complete incident records preserved |
| **Institutional decisions** | All governance decisions documented and archived |
| **Legal proceedings** | Court records and decisions preserved |

#### 7.2.2 Institutional Capability Preservation

| Capability | Minimum Preservation |
|------------|---------------------|
| **JSVC** | Core staff; verification methodology; external relationships |
| **Confederal courts** | Legal framework; precedent database; judicial roster |
| **PCC network** | Infrastructure in caretaker status; maintenance protocols |
| **CMS registry** | Database preserved; security maintained |

### 7.3 Personnel During Regression

| Category | Treatment |
|----------|-----------|
| **Essential personnel** | Retained at reduced scope; may be redeployed |
| **Program personnel** | Transition support; priority rehiring upon recovery |
| **Local staff** | Enhanced protection; employment transition support |
| **International staff** | Repatriation support; standby arrangements for recall |

### 7.4 Asset Preservation

| Asset Category | Regression Treatment |
|----------------|---------------------|
| **Physical facilities** | Caretaker status; security maintained; maintenance continued |
| **IT systems** | Preserved in secure state; data integrity maintained |
| **Financial reserves** | Preserved for recovery; not distributed |
| **Equipment** | Secure storage; inventory maintained |

---

## 8. Recovery Pathways

### 8.1 Recovery Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Recovery is expected** | Regression is temporary; re-advancement is normal |
| **Accelerated pathway** | Prior achievement can accelerate recovery |
| **Learning integration** | Recovery incorporates lessons from regression |
| **Confidence rebuilding** | Recovery proceeds gradually to rebuild trust |

### 8.2 Recovery Criteria

Recovery (re-advancement) requires demonstrating that:

| Category | Requirement |
|----------|-------------|
| **Trigger resolved** | The condition that caused regression is no longer present |
| **Stability restored** | Relevant metrics have returned to acceptable levels |
| **Sustainability** | Conditions suggest stability is sustainable, not temporary |
| **Capacity restored** | Institutional capacity to operate at higher phase exists |

### 8.3 Accelerated Recovery

Prior achievement can accelerate recovery through:

| Acceleration Mechanism | Effect |
|------------------------|--------|
| **Reduced observation periods** | 50% reduction in stability demonstration periods |
| **Preserved eligibility** | Prior CMS holders do not repeat eligibility process |
| **Institutional continuity** | Institutions restart rather than rebuild |
| **Relationship preservation** | Guarantor and partner relationships continue |

#### 8.3.1 Accelerated Recovery Conditions

Accelerated recovery applies when:

- Regression was short-term (≤12 months)
- Trigger was external rather than internal failure
- Institutional integrity was preserved
- No evidence of systematic fraud or capture during prior phase

### 8.4 Recovery Process

```text
RECOVERY ASSESSMENT AND RE-ADVANCEMENT

Step 1: Recovery Eligibility Assessment
├── Trigger resolution verified
├── Stability metrics assessed
├── Institutional capacity evaluated
└── Guarantor capacity confirmed

Step 2: Recovery Plan Development
├── Scope of re-advancement determined
├── Timeline established
├── Resource requirements identified
└── Risk mitigation planned

Step 3: Graduated Recovery
├── Initial limited re-activation
├── Monitoring during recovery period
├── Expansion if stability confirmed
└── Full re-advancement when criteria met

Step 4: Post-Recovery Monitoring
├── Enhanced monitoring for 12 months post-recovery
├── Rapid response protocols active
├── Lower thresholds for early warning
└── Learning integration ongoing
```

### 8.5 Learning Integration

Every regression triggers mandatory learning processes:

| Process | Purpose | Timeline |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Immediate debrief** | Capture real-time observations | Within 7 days of regression |
| **Causal analysis** | Understand what triggered regression | Within 60 days |
| **System review** | Identify systemic improvements | Within 90 days |
| **Protocol revision** | Update procedures based on learning | Within 180 days |

Learning outputs are integrated into:

- Risk Management Framework updates
- Threshold calibration
- Early warning indicators
- Recovery planning
