## 1. Amendment Principles

### 1.1 Core Philosophy

MCF is designed to be **evolvable without being easily capturable**. Amendment logic is a core governance problem, not an afterthought.

| Challenge | MCF Response |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Rigidity** | Layered amendment authority; mandatory periodic review |
| **Instability** | Graduated thresholds; minority protections |
| **Capture** | Supermajority requirements; guarantor oversight |
| **Stagnation** | Forced reconsideration; experimental adaptation |

### 1.2 Guiding Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Adaptability** | Framework can evolve with changing conditions over decades |
| **Stability** | Core functions protected from casual modification |
| **Capture prevention** | No single actor can reshape framework to their advantage |
| **Minority protection** | Changes cannot strip protections from vulnerable groups |
| **Transparency** | All amendments documented and publicly accessible |
| **Reversibility** | Most changes can be reversed if they fail |

### 1.3 Layered Amendment Authority

MCF separates what can change easily, conditionally, or only under heightened consensus:

| Level | Scope | Authority | Standard |
|-------|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Operational** | Day-to-day procedures, technical standards | JSVC / designated body | Simple majority |
| **Structural** | Institutional design, phase mechanics | JSVC + parties + guarantors | Supermajority |
| **Fundamental** | Core principles, protected rights | Full consensus | Near-unanimity |

This prevents:

- Trivial changes requiring excessive deliberation
- Fundamental changes proceeding without adequate scrutiny
- Any single actor controlling the amendment process

### 1.4 What Amendments Cannot Do

No amendment, regardless of threshold, may:

| Prohibition | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------|
| Strip existing CRC protections retroactively | Participant reliance; good faith |
| Impose new conditions on existing CMS holders without consent | Contract integrity |
| Transfer MCF authority to a single party | Capture prevention |
| Eliminate guarantor oversight entirely | External legitimacy |
| Remove voluntary participation principle | Coercion prevention |

---

## 2. Amendment Categories

### 2.1 Category Overview

| Category | Examples | Threshold | Process Duration |
|----------|----------|-----------|------------------|
| **Operational** | Technical standards, procedural timelines, form updates | Simple majority | 30-90 days |
| **Structural** | Institutional charters, phase transition criteria, new institutions | Supermajority | 6-12 months |
| **Fundamental** | Core principles, protected rights, amendment procedures | Near-unanimity | 12-24 months |

### 2.2 Category Assignment

When a proposed amendment's category is disputed:

1. **Initial classification** by proposing body
2. **Review** by JSVC Legal Office
3. **Appeal** to Guarantor Legal Review (if disputed)
4. **Final determination** binding on all parties

**Default rule:** If category is uncertain, apply the higher threshold.

### 2.3 Compound Amendments

Amendments touching multiple categories:

- Are separated into component parts where possible
- Apply the highest applicable threshold to each component
- May not bundle unrelated changes to circumvent thresholds

---

## 6. Protected Elements

### 6.1 Unamendable Elements

Certain elements are **unamendable** regardless of threshold:

| Element | Rationale |
|---------|-----------|
| **Voluntary participation** | Core framework identity; coercion defeats purpose |
| **Non-retroactive harm** | Participant reliance; good faith |
| **Access to exit** | Voluntary participation requires exit option |
| **Basic human dignity** | Minimum non-negotiable |

Proposals purporting to amend these elements are **void ab initio**.

### 6.2 Enhanced Protection Elements

These elements require **fundamental amendment procedures plus additional safeguards**:

| Element | Additional Safeguard |
|---------|---------------------|
| **CRC core rights** | Affected community consent (60%+) |
| **Anti-discrimination provisions** | Minority group consultation |
| **Guarantor oversight** | Guarantor committee formal approval |
| **Appeal/grievance rights** | Participant petition opportunity |
| **Confidentiality protections** | Anti-intimidation review |

### 6.3 Protection Enforcement

If an amendment is proposed that allegedly violates protected elements:

1. **Objection** may be raised by any party, guarantor, or 100+ participants
2. **Review** by JSVC Legal Office within 14 days
3. **Determination** published with reasoning
4. **Appeal** to Guarantor Legal Review if disputed
5. **Final determination** by Guarantor Legal Review is binding

---

## 7. Mandatory Periodic Review

### 7.1 Purpose

To prevent stagnation, MCF embeds **mandatory periodic review moments** that force reassessment without forcing change.

Inertia is treated as a **risk to be managed**, not a default virtue.

### 7.2 Review Schedule

| Review Type | Frequency | Scope |
|-------------|-----------|-------|
| **Operational review** | Annual | All operational procedures |
| **Institutional review** | Every 3 years | Institutional charters and mandates |
| **Phase review** | Per phase duration | Phase success, transition readiness |
| **Comprehensive review** | Every 10 years | Full framework assessment |

### 7.3 Review Requirements

Each review must include:

| Input | Source |
|-------|--------|
| **Performance data** | JSVC monitoring and reporting |
| **Lessons learned report** | Independent assessment |
| **Participant feedback** | Surveys, assemblies, submissions |
| **External audit** | Guarantor-commissioned |
| **Expert analysis** | Academic, technical, legal |

### 7.4 Affirmative Continuation

At each phase review and comprehensive review:

- Continuation must be **affirmatively certified**, not assumed
- Certification requires assessment of whether framework still serves its purpose
- If certification is denied, transition or dissolution procedures triggered

### 7.5 Review-Generated Amendments

Reviews may generate amendment proposals:

- Review body may propose amendments in any category
- Proposals follow standard procedures for their category
- Review body recommendation carries weight but does not override thresholds

---

## 8. Experimental Adaptation

### 8.1 Purpose

MCF allows **evolution through evidence rather than ideology** by permitting controlled experiments.

### 8.2 Pilot Programs

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Scope** | Limited geographic, population, or functional scope |
| **Duration** | Time-limited (typically 12-36 months) |
| **Metrics** | Pre-defined success criteria |
| **Evaluation** | Independent assessment |
| **Outcome** | Codification if successful; expiration if not |

### 8.3 Pilot Approval

| Pilot Type | Approval Authority |
|------------|-------------------|
| **Operational pilot** | JSVC Executive Director (notification to Commission) |
| **Institutional pilot** | JSVC Commission (simple majority) |
| **Structural pilot** | JSVC Commission (5 of 7) + guarantor notification |

### 8.4 Pilot Protections

All pilots must:

| Requirement | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| **Not reduce existing protections** | Participants not made worse off |
| **Include opt-out** | Affected participants may decline |
| **Define success criteria** | Objective evaluation possible |
| **Specify end conditions** | Clear termination regardless of outcome |
| **Provide for reversal** | If pilot fails, status quo ante restored |

### 8.5 Codification of Successful Pilots

If pilot succeeds:

1. **Evaluation report** with data and recommendation
2. **Codification proposal** following standard amendment procedures
3. **Category determination** based on scope of proposed permanent change
4. **Standard thresholds** apply to codification

Pilot success does not guarantee codification; it only enables proposal.

## 9. Emergency Amendments

### 9.1 Emergency Criteria

Emergency amendment procedures may only be invoked when:

| Criterion | Standard |
|-----------|----------|
| **Imminent threat** | Documented threat to framework viability or participant safety |
| **Time-critical** | Standard procedures would result in irreparable harm |
| **Proportionate** | Amendment is narrowly tailored to address emergency |
| **Temporary** | Amendment is time-limited pending regular review |

### 9.2 Emergency Authority

| Function | Authority |
|----------|-----------|
| **Declaration** | JSVC Executive Director + any guarantor representative |
| **Approval** | 5 of 7 JSVC Commissioners + guarantor majority |
| **Implementation** | Immediate upon approval |
| **Review** | Within 30 days; within 90 days for extension |

### 9.3 Emergency Scope Limitations

Emergency amendments may NOT:

| Limitation | Rationale |
|------------|-----------|
| Modify protected elements | Emergencies cannot justify stripping core protections |
| Create permanent changes | Maximum 180-day duration |
| Be renewed more than once | After 360 days, regular procedures required |
| Reduce participant protections | May not use emergency to harm participants |

### 9.4 Emergency Process

├── Guarantor majority approval

Hour 24+: Implementation and Review
├── Immediate implementation
├── 7-day effectiveness report
├── 30-day formal review
├── Termination, extension, or regular procedure
```

### 9.5 Post-Emergency Review

All emergency amendments undergo:

| Review | Timeline |
|--------|----------|
| **Effectiveness review** | 7 days |
| **Formal review** | 30 days |
| **Extension decision** | If needed, before 180 days |
| **Conversion or termination** | Before 360 days |

If emergency amendment should become permanent, regular amendment procedures apply.
