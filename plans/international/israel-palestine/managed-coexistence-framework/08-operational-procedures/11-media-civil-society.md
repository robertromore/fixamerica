# Media and Civil Society Framework

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md)

**Phase:** All Phases

**Status:** Draft

---

## Purpose

Media and Civil Society Framework defines MCF's relationship with **non-governmental actors**—journalists, media organizations, NGOs, and civil society organizations—who operate within or report on the conflict environment.

MCF neither controls nor ignores these actors. It establishes clear rules for access, protection, and accountability while respecting press freedom and civil society independence.

---

## Design Principles

### 1. Press Freedom Protection

MCF protects journalists and enables press access without controlling narrative or content.

**What This Means:**

- No MCF censorship of reporting
- Access facilitation, not restriction
- Protection from violence
- Independence from MCF messaging

### 2. Civil Society Independence

NGOs and CSOs operate independently of MCF while receiving protection and access.

**What This Means:**

- No MCF control of civil society
- Operational space protection
- Funding channel independence
- Accountability for misconduct, not viewpoint

### 3. Transparency Over Control

MCF provides information transparency rather than attempting to control information environment.

**What This Means:**

- Proactive MCF information release
- Access to MCF proceedings
- Data publication
- Response to inquiries

### 4. Accountability for Harm

Actors who cause harm (disinformation, incitement, fraud) face accountability without viewpoint discrimination.

**What This Means:**

- Harm-based standards, not content-based
- Due process before action
- Proportionate responses
- Appeal mechanisms

## Media Framework

### 1. Journalist Accreditation

**Purpose:**

Accreditation enables journalist access to MCF facilities, PCCs, and events. It does not license journalism or restrict non-accredited reporting.

**Accreditation Process:**

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Eligibility** | Professional journalists; media organization affiliation or demonstrated independent work |
| **Application** | MCF Press Office; basic identification; work sample |
| **Approval** | Administrative process; no political vetting |
| **Duration** | One year; renewable |
| **Revocation** | Only for cause (security breach, fraud); appeal available |

**Accreditation Benefits:**

- Access to MCF briefings
- PCC press access
- MCF event attendance
- Information request priority

**Without Accreditation:**

- General public information access
- No restriction on reporting
- Standard PCC access
- Public event attendance

### 2. Press Access

**MCF Facility Access:**

| Facility | Access Level |
|----------|--------------|
| **Public areas** | Open to all |
| **Press briefing rooms** | Accredited journalists |
| **Operational areas** | Escorted access by arrangement |
| **Restricted areas** | No press access (security) |

**PCC Press Access:**

- Accredited journalists may use press-designated PCCs
- Embedding arrangements for specific coverage
- No restriction on reporting from public areas
- Security coordination for conflict zone coverage

**Incident Access:**

- Press access to incident sites after security clearance
- No MCF restriction on reporting incidents
- Facilitated access where safe
- Protection of evidence and privacy

### 3. Journalist Protection

**Physical Protection:**

| Threat | Response |
|--------|----------|
| **Violence** | Priority evacuation; security assistance; incident documentation |
| **Detention** | MCF advocacy for release; legal support information |
| **Harassment** | Anti-intimidation architecture access |
| **Equipment seizure** | Documentation; advocacy for return |

**Professional Protection:**

- Source confidentiality respected by MCF
- No compelled disclosure of sources
- Work product protection
- Editorial independence

**Limitations:**

- MCF cannot override party security authorities
- Protection is best-effort, not guaranteed
- Journalists accept inherent risks
- MCF not responsible for party actions

### 4. MCF Communication

**Proactive Communication:**

| Type | Frequency |
|------|-----------|
| **Press briefings** | Weekly (or as events warrant) |

| **Policy announcements** | As developed |

**Reactive Communication:**

- Press inquiry response within 24 hours
- On-record spokesperson available
- Background briefings by arrangement
- Correction of factual errors

**Information Standards:**

- Factual accuracy
- Timeliness

### 5. Information Warfare Interface

**Challenge:**

Press freedom must coexist with information warfare resilience. MCF cannot restrict legitimate journalism to counter disinformation.

**Approach:**

| Threat | Response |
|--------|----------|
| **Disinformation about MCF** | Rapid factual correction; transparent rebuttal |
| **Propaganda operations** | Attribution and exposure (not suppression) |
| **Journalist impersonation** | Verification of credentials; exposure of fakes |
| **Manipulated content** | Technical analysis; clarification |

**What MCF Does Not Do:**

- Label legitimate criticism as disinformation
- Restrict reporting based on viewpoint
- Create official truth standards
- Penalize unfavorable coverage
