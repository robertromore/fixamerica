# Stress Testing Suite

**Parent Document:** [01-risk-management.md](01-risk-management.md)

**Phase:** Phase 0-1 (UVB/JSVC + PCCs + early CMS + arbitration + anti-intimidation)

**Objective:** Probe framework failure modes under adversarial conditions and define containment responses.

**Status:** Draft

---

## Purpose

This document applies a hostile reviewer's lens to MCF: "What breaks? How does the system respond? What is the containment plan?" Most conflict management frameworks fail in Phase 0-1, so these stress tests focus on that critical period.

**Design Philosophy:**

MCF does not assume good faith, stable politics, or favorable conditions. It assumes adversarial actors, asymmetric power, information warfare, and periodic violence. The framework survives not by preventing bad events but by containing their damage to the procedural layer.

---

## Stress Test 1: Mass-Casualty Attack with Disputed Attribution

### Scenario

A major attack (Gaza → Israel or West Bank → Israel) triggers public rage and demands for maximal retaliation. Each side contests responsibility. Attribution is unclear for days or weeks.

### Why This Kills Frameworks

The classic kill-shot. Emotional pressure demands immediate, visible response. Political leaders cannot appear to defer to "process" while bodies are counted. If MCF is perceived as constraining response, it becomes the enemy.

### MCF Response

**Principle:** Decouple immediate security response from collapse of the procedural layer.

| Component | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **Military action** | Israeli forces act immediately as they do today; MCF does not delay force |
| **Verification** | UVB/JSVC activates pre-defined "rapid verification lane" (tight evidence chain, timestamps, fragment analysis, comms deconfliction) |
| **PCCs** | Do not fully collapse; only relevant corridors tighten under time-limited severity protocol |
| **Medical PCCs** | Remain protected—no closure; throughput reduction varies by type (patient transfer: max 50%, medical supply: max 25%, facilities: no restriction) per [PCC Protocols](../01-phase-0-institutions/03-pcc-protocols.md#medical-pcc-absolute-protection) |
| **Discretionary benefits** | Mobility benefits may pause; utility repair windows may narrow |
| **Attribution timeline** | Preliminary (72 hours), confirmed (30 days), final (90 days) |

**Win Condition:**

Not preventing retaliation, but:

- Preventing the narrative vacuum from driving *maximal* escalation
- Preventing the entire framework from being politically torched
- Maintaining factual record that becomes authoritative over time

### Failure Mode

Leaders frame MCF as weakness—"We're under attack and bureaucrats want paperwork."

### Mitigation

Automatic, pre-negotiated procedural responses that leaders can point to as **"security hardening"**, not "cooperation":

- Shock-absorber protocols activate without negotiation
- Response is framed as "enhanced security posture" per standing protocol
- Leaders can say "we activated maximum security measures" rather than "we consulted with the other side"
- Protocols are published in advance; no one can claim surprise

---

## Stress Test 2: Major Israeli Operation Causes High Civilian Casualties

### Scenario

An Israeli military operation in Gaza or the West Bank causes significant civilian deaths. Palestinians claim PCCs and the rights compact are a sham—"What good is your corridor if bombs fall on hospitals?"

### Why This Kills Frameworks

This tests neutrality and legitimacy at the hardest point. MCF cannot adjudicate legality of military operations. If it tries, Israel withdraws. If it doesn't, Palestinians see it as complicit.

### MCF Response

**Principle:** MCF adjudicates procedure and fact, not legality.

| Function | Action |
|----------|--------|
| **UVB/JSVC publishes** | Factual record: warnings issued or not, corridor notifications attempted or not, protected infrastructure impacted, compliance with deconfliction windows |
| **Enforcement mechanism** | Not "punish Israel" internally; guarantors condition future insulation and funding on procedural compliance |
| **CMS/arbitration** | Remain intact for Palestinian participants even if corridor functions regress |
| **Anti-intimidation** | Protections continue operating |

**Containment Approach:**

Prevent Palestinian participation from collapsing by keeping individual-level benefits intact even during operational periods:

- CMS status continues
- Arbitration access continues
- Anti-intimidation protections continue
- Some corridor functions may regress temporarily per shock-absorber protocols

### Failure Mode

Palestinians perceive the framework as laundering harm—"You document atrocities but change nothing."

### Mitigation

MCF must be:

1. **Explicitly non-prejudicial:** Does not make legal determinations about military operations
2. **Ruthlessly transparent:** Publishes factual compliance record regardless of political pressure
3. **Consequential externally:** Compliance failures create diplomatic, financial, and legal exposure through guarantor mechanisms—not internal grandstanding

The framework does not "judge" Israel; it documents facts that others use for judgment.

---

## Stress Test 3: Settler Violence Spike with Perceived Official Tolerance

### Scenario

Settler violence spikes dramatically in the West Bank. Israeli authorities appear to tolerate or inadequately prosecute perpetrators. Palestinians see MCF as irrelevant to their daily safety.

### Why This Kills Frameworks

Make-or-break test. MCF claims to operate under asymmetry without normalizing domination. If it cannot reduce violence against participants, it validates criticism that cooperation is surrender.

### MCF Response

**Principle:** Treat settler violence as a high-severity deconfliction failure with escalating consequences.

| Track | Response |
|-------|----------|
| **Anti-intimidation** | Individual CMS revocations for perpetrators (if enrolled); exclusion from arbitration benefits; documented in permanent record |
| **Verification** | Enhanced monitoring in flashpoint zones; pattern documentation |
| **External pressure** | Documented pattern reports raise external costs for non-enforcement |
| **PCC integrity** | PCCs remain facility-based; do not become settlement endpoints |
| **Rollback triggers** | "Participant intimidation and vigilante violence" is a primary trigger for local expansion rollback |
| **Guarantor leverage** | Violence patterns become primary conditionality target |

**Critical Constraint:**

MCF must **never** be used as a security multiplier for settlement expansion:

- PCCs do not serve settlements
- MCF infrastructure does not extend to settlement roads or facilities
- Participant protection focuses on individuals, not territorial claims

### Failure Mode

Framework becomes irrelevant to Palestinians because it cannot reduce the violence they actually experience.

### Mitigation

- Make settler violence a **primary** (not secondary) framework concern
- Automatic escalation to guarantor attention when patterns emerge
- Clear public reporting that attributes patterns, not just individual incidents
- Expansion conditioned on violence reduction—no new CMS processing in areas with active intimidation patterns

---

## Stress Test 4: Organizational Capture Attempt

### Scenario

Hamas (or a successor organization) attempts to capture the framework by:

- Demanding organizational representation in MCF bodies
- Using intimidation to monopolize CMS uptake in Gaza
- Treating CMS as a factional credential

### Why This Kills Frameworks

If CMS becomes a Hamas membership card, Israel will terminate cooperation. If MCF resists, it may be attacked. Either way, factional capture destroys the framework's premise.

### MCF Response

**Principle:** Participation is individual-first; organizational integration is a late-stage, behavior-verified transformation endpoint.

| Mechanism | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Eligibility** | Individual application only; no organizational sponsorship |
| **Intake channels** | JSVC-facilitated coordination; guarantor-arranged remote processing; remote arbitration intake; anonymized pipelines where possible (External SAZ channels available in Phase 1-2 per [External SAZ](../03-phase-2-saz/05-external-saz.md)) |
| **Coercion response** | Rapid revocation plus benefit denial for coercive behavior toward applicants |
| **Geographic flexibility** | Gaza may remain in containment mode while institutional progress continues elsewhere |
| **Processing throttle** | Local participation can be throttled without ending the framework |

**Acceptance:**

MCF must accept that **Gaza may operate in limited mode for extended periods**. This is not framework failure—it is framework resilience. Progress in the West Bank or external SAZs continues independently.

### Failure Mode

CMS becomes a factional credential—either Hamas controls it or fears it.

### Mitigation

- Strict individual eligibility (no organizational enrollment)
- Multiple intake channels (harder to monitor/control)
- Anonymized processing where feasible
- Zero tolerance for coercion (immediate revocation)
- Geographic differentiation (Gaza and West Bank operate independently)

---

## Stress Test 5: Guarantor Withdrawal or Policy Flip

### Scenario

A major guarantor withdraws or flips policy:

- U.S. administration change leads to disengagement
- EU fatigue after prolonged crisis
- Regional guarantor faces domestic pressure to exit

### Why This Kills Frameworks

If guarantors are essential and one becomes unreliable, cascade failure follows. Remaining guarantors may exit to avoid being last out. Funding collapses. Legitimacy evaporates.

### MCF Response

**Principle:** No guarantor is indispensable; core functions survive through firewalled continuity.

| Mechanism | Function |
|-----------|----------|
| **Distributed roles** | Each guarantor function has backups; no single point of failure |
| **Multi-year commitments** | Funding commitments are multi-year, legally binding |
| **Endowment** | Long-term endowment covers core operations independent of annual contributions |
| **Degradation modes** | Pre-defined operational contractions that preserve core functions |
| **Modular structure** | Donor replacement possible because functions are standardized |

**Degradation Hierarchy:**

If funding contracts severely, preserve in this order:

1. **Core (never cut):** Verification (UVB/JSVC), basic humanitarian PCCs (medical, water)
2. **Priority:** Anti-intimidation protections, CMS registry maintenance
3. **Reducible:** Optional programs, corridor expansion, staffing levels
4. **Suspendable:** New SAZ development, discretionary benefits

### Failure Mode

Cascading legitimacy loss—one exit triggers others.

### Mitigation

- **Distributed guarantor architecture:** 3-5 guarantors minimum; no >40% dependence on any single guarantor
- **Transition procedures:** Orderly handoff when guarantors exit
- **Institutional continuity body:** Preserves records, standards, and minimal operations during transitions
- **Multi-source verification:** Even degraded MCF maintains factual documentation

---

## Stress Test 6: Coordinated Information Warfare

### Scenario

Coordinated campaigns claim:

- **In Israel:** "MCF is a surrender plot, legitimizing terrorists, constraining IDF"
- **Among Palestinians:** "MCF normalizes occupation, launders apartheid, betrays resistance"

### Why This Kills Frameworks

Political capture through narrative. If MCF is successfully framed as betrayal by both sides, participation becomes politically toxic. Moderates cannot defend engagement.

### MCF Response

**Principle:** MCF does not sell hope; it sells procedures.

| Approach | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| **Communications posture** | Deliberately boring; evidentiary; procedural |
| **Rapid factual clarification** | UVB/JSVC publishes standardized incident timelines, compliance reports |
| **Counterfeit resistance** | Reports are hard to fake (timestamps, evidence chains, multi-source verification) |
| **No moralized language** | Framework communications avoid emotional framing that can be easily inverted |
| **Predictable cadence** | Regular reporting schedule creates baseline; deviations are news, consistency is not |

**Doctrine:**

You don't "win" the information war. You deny it oxygen by:

- Stabilizing facts
- Maintaining predictable procedures
- Keeping benefits compounding for participants

### Failure Mode

Narrative capture—framework becomes a political football rather than an operational reality.

### Mitigation

- **Transparency:** Everything possible is published; conspiracy theories require hidden facts
- **Boring consistency:** Regular, procedural, technical reporting that resists dramatization
- **Participant testimony:** Individual beneficiaries (with consent and protection) can speak to concrete benefits
- **Refusal to engage:** MCF does not debate political legitimacy; it documents and operates

---

## Stress Test 7: Funding Weaponization

### Scenario

Parties attempt to weaponize funding:

- Israel or PA threatens to stop paying stakeholder fees
- Donors threaten to condition funds on political concessions unrelated to MCF operations
- One party attempts to "buy" favorable treatment

### Why This Kills Frameworks

If parties can defund operations or donors can purchase outcomes, institutional independence collapses. Framework becomes a tool of the highest bidder.

### MCF Response

**Principle:** No party can defund the core; donors cannot purchase control.

| Mechanism | Protection |
|-----------|------------|
| **Stakeholder fees** | Benefit-linked and escrowed; nonpayment suspends access but does not stop verification |
| **Donor funds** | Firewalled from governance; donors fund, they do not direct |
| **Conditionality level** | Applied at guarantor-policy level, not within institutional decision chain |
| **Multi-year budgets** | Core staff and monitoring funded through precommitted multi-year budgets |
| **Endowment** | Independent endowment provides baseline regardless of annual funding |

**Charter-Level Separation:**

MCF charter explicitly separates:

- **Finance authority:** Who provides funding
- **Governance authority:** Who makes operational decisions
- **Verification authority:** Who determines facts

These cannot be collapsed. Funders do not govern. Governors do not verify.

### Failure Mode

Institutional capture—whoever pays, controls.

### Mitigation

- **Diversified funding:** No single source >30% of budget (per [Funding Architecture](../04-guarantor-architecture/03-funding-architecture.md#1-diversification-requirement))
- **Governance firewalls:** Funding decisions do not affect operational decisions
- **Public budget transparency:** All funding sources and amounts published
- **Precommitted core budget:** Essential functions funded for multiple years regardless of annual negotiations

---

## Stress Test 8: Premature or Explosive SAZ Attempt

### Scenario

Political pressure or overconfidence leads to SAZ initiation:

- In a contested location (near Jerusalem, major settlement, refugee camp)
- Before security conditions support it
- As a political symbol rather than operational pilot

### Why This Kills Frameworks

If an SAZ fails spectacularly, the entire framework is discredited. "They tried shared governance and it collapsed in three months."

### MCF Response

**Principle:** Governance discipline—resist the temptation to "show success" by planting flags.

| Safeguard | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Enhanced thresholds** | SAZ initiation requires higher criteria than standard phase transitions |
| **Explicit exclusions** | Jerusalem and other sacred flashpoints excluded in early phases |
| **External-first** | External SAZ (Jordan pilot) before internal attempts |
| **Reversibility** | Site selection is a protocol outcome, not a founder's vision; rejection does not end framework |
| **Failure isolation** | SAZ failure in one location does not terminate framework elsewhere |

**Prohibited Locations (Phase 0-1):**

- Jerusalem (any part)
- Major settlement blocs
- Locations with active armed group presence
- Areas where security cannot be guaranteed

### Failure Mode

Premature territorial symbolism—framework becomes identified with a failed experiment.

### Mitigation

- SAZ is **optional**, not required for framework success
- Multiple criteria gates before initiation
- External review of site selection
- Explicit "SAZ rejection does not end MCF" clause
- Success defined by process integrity, not territorial presence

---

## Stress Test 9: Legal Shock Event

### Scenario

A major legal development polarizes the environment:

- ICJ advisory opinion or jurisdiction ruling
- ICC arrest warrant or investigation expansion
- Domestic court ruling (Israeli or Palestinian) affecting participation
- International sanctions regime change

### Why This Kills Frameworks

Legal shocks force participants to choose: "Are you with us or against us?" If MCF is seen as incompatible with legal processes, one side exits. If it's seen as complicit, the other side exits.

### MCF Response

**Principle:** MCF is legally parallel, not legally dispositive.

| Approach | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| **Continuation regardless** | Framework continues operating irrespective of legal forum developments |
| **Factual documentation** | UVB/JSVC continues producing factual records that legal processes may use |
| **Non-prejudicial operation** | MCF does not adjudicate legal claims; it operates procedures |
| **External consequences** | Legal developments affect guarantor policies and external pressure, not MCF internal operations |
| **Participation preservation** | Charter explicitly states participation neither waives nor concedes legal claims |

**Charter Language:**

"Participation in MCF mechanisms does not constitute:

- Recognition of any territorial claim
- Waiver of any legal right or remedy
- Concession of any legal position
- Consent to any political outcome

MCF continues operating regardless of developments in international or domestic legal forums."

### Failure Mode

One side uses legal shocks to delegitimize participation as betrayal—"You're cooperating with an entity under ICC investigation" or "You're legitimizing illegal occupation."

### Mitigation

- **Explicit legal-neutrality clause** in charter
- **No legal determinations** by MCF bodies
- **Factual documentation** that legal processes can use without MCF taking legal positions
- **Participation-protection framing:** "MCF protects your access to legal remedies; it does not replace them"

---

## Stress Test 10: Success Produces Backlash

### Scenario

MCF begins working. Moderates gain tangible benefits from CMS, cross-community employment, arbitration access. This visibility makes them targets. Spoilers escalate violence specifically to punish normalization.

### Why This Kills Frameworks

The "most dangerous moment is improvement" problem. Success creates targets. If participants are terrorized into silence, the framework contracts. If protection fails, the message is clear: engagement is dangerous.

### MCF Response

**Principle:** Anti-intimidation protections must scale with participation.

| Protection | Implementation |
|------------|----------------|
| **Protected reporting** | Anonymous channels for reporting threats and intimidation |
| **Relocation support** | Assistance for participants facing serious threats |
| **Anonymized pipelines** | Processing that minimizes exposure of participant identity |
| **Rapid consequence mapping** | Quick documentation of perpetrators for exclusion and external reporting |
| **Participant protection budget** | Core budget line, not optional program |

**Expansion-Protection Coupling:**

Framework expansion **never outpaces protection**:

- Before expanding to new area, anti-intimidation capacity must be in place
- Participation uptake is monitored against intimidation reports
- Expansion pauses if protection cannot keep pace
- Regression or localized suspension if protection fails

### Failure Mode

Moderates get terrorized into silence; participation becomes a death sentence.

### Mitigation

- **Participant protection as core function:** Not an afterthought; budget priority
- **Automatic escalation:** Intimidation patterns trigger guarantor attention and potential phase regression
- **Protection-first expansion:** No new areas until protection infrastructure exists
- **Survivor support:** Documented support for those who face consequences for participation

## Stress Test 11: Sustained Military Campaign (90+ Days)

### Scenario

A major military operation in Gaza (comparable to 2014 or 2023-2024 scale) continues for 90+ days. MCF infrastructure in the affected zone is physically destroyed or inaccessible. CMS holders are displaced. PCC corridors are closed. JSVC personnel are evacuated. The operation exceeds every time-limited cap in the shock-absorber protocols.

### What MCF Confronts

- All Tier 4 duration caps expire while hostilities continue
- PCC infrastructure is physically damaged or destroyed
- CMS holders are displaced from registered addresses
- Employers in the affected zone cease operations
- Communication infrastructure is degraded or destroyed
- JSVC cannot access the affected zone for verification
- International attention is focused on the humanitarian crisis, not MCF procedures

### MCF Response

**Phase 1: Tier 5 Activation (Day 1-7)**

- Tier 4 caps reached; Tier 5 activates automatically
- MCF contracts to core preservation functions
- CMS database backed up to guarantor-hosted off-site facility
- JSVC shifts to remote documentation (satellite imagery, open-source intelligence, witness testimony)
- Guarantor reporting shifts to continuous mode
- Anti-intimidation unit activates protection protocols for at-risk CMS holders

**Phase 2: Core Preservation (Day 7-90)**

- CMS status maintained for all holders in affected zone
- Remote verification documentation continues
- Guarantor diplomatic engagement intensifies
- Humanitarian documentation feeds into international accountability mechanisms
- Employment protections clock runs (90-day retroactive guarantee)
- MCF operations continue normally in unaffected zones (geographic differentiation)

**Phase 3: Extended Preservation (Day 90+)**

- 90-day employment retroactive guarantee expires; losses documented for compensation
- Regression assessment initiated per Tier 5 interaction rules
- Reconstitution planning begins (does not wait for cessation of hostilities)
- Pre-positioned supplies and personnel identified for rapid reactivation
- CMS holder welfare tracking continues through available channels

**Phase 4: Reconstitution (Post-Cessation)**

- Reconstitution sequence activated per priority order
- Damage assessment of MCF infrastructure
- CMS holder welfare checks
- Expedited grievance processing for conflict-period claims
- Phase status assessment: can current phase conditions be rebuilt, or has regression occurred?

### What MCF Cannot Do

- Prevent or shorten the military operation
- Maintain normal operations in a war zone
- Guarantee physical safety of CMS holders during active hostilities
- Prevent infrastructure destruction
- Force JSVC access during operations

### What MCF Preserves

- Institutional continuity (databases, records, legal standing)
- CMS holder status and future claims
- Documentation for accountability
- Operations in unaffected zones
- Framework for rapid reconstitution when conditions allow

### Key Lesson

MCF is designed to survive war, not to operate normally during one. The honest acknowledgment that procedural infrastructure becomes inoperable during sustained military operations--combined with a defined path back to operations afterward--is more credible than pretending the framework can function under bombardment. Credibility is maintained by having planned for this scenario, not by claiming immunity to it.

## Cross-Cutting Observations

### What MCF Cannot Prevent

- Determined attacks by spoilers
- Political leaders choosing escalation over procedure
- Information warfare (can only be mitigated, not prevented)
- External legal developments
- Guarantor domestic politics

### What MCF Can Contain

- Escalation spirals (through shock-absorbers)
- Narrative vacuums (through rapid factual documentation)
- Institutional collapse (through degradation modes)
- Individual targeting (through anti-intimidation)
- Funding manipulation (through financial firewalls)

### Core Resilience Features

1. **Decoupling:** Security response decoupled from procedural layer
2. **Degradation:** Graceful contraction preserves core functions
3. **Transparency:** Facts resist manipulation better than narratives
4. **Firewalls:** Finance, governance, and verification separated
5. **Optionality:** SAZs optional; geographic differentiation allowed
6. **Protection:** Participant safety as core function, not afterthought
