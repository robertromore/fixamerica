## 1. Purpose and Scope

### 1.1 Core Principles

Humanitarian crisis response under MCF operates on the following principles:

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Civilian primacy** | Civilian protection takes precedence over all other MCF objectives during crisis |
| **Neutrality preservation** | MCF maintains impartiality; crisis response does not alter political positions |
| **Institutional continuity** | Crisis response preserves MCF institutional capacity for post-crisis operations |
| **Procedural clarity** | Response actions follow pre-defined protocols, not ad hoc political decisions |
| **Scalable activation** | Response intensity matches crisis severity; avoid over-response that strains resources |

### 1.2 Scope of Application

These protocols govern:

- Detection and classification of humanitarian crises
- Activation of emergency response mechanisms
- Resource mobilization and allocation
- Coordination with external humanitarian actors
- Protection of vulnerable populations
- PCC operation during crisis conditions
- Communication and information management
- Recovery and lessons learned processes

### 1.3 Relationship to Other Protocols

| Protocol | Relationship |
|----------|--------------|
| **Shock-Absorber** | Crisis protocols operate *in addition to* shock-absorber; incident tiers may trigger crisis activation |
| **PCC Protocols** | PCCs shift to emergency operating mode; medical PCCs receive enhanced priority |
| **Communication Protocols** | Emergency communication channels activated; public notification procedures engaged |
| **Risk Management** | Crisis response draws on pre-positioned resources and contingency plans |

**Key distinction:** Shock-absorber protocols address *security incidents*; humanitarian crisis protocols address *civilian welfare emergencies* that may or may not involve security incidents.

---

## 2. Definition and Classification

### 2.1 Humanitarian Crisis Definition

A **humanitarian crisis** under MCF is a situation where:

1. Civilian populations face acute threats to life, health, or basic needs, AND
2. Normal institutional capacity is insufficient to address the threat, AND
3. Coordinated emergency response is required across MCF institutional boundaries

### 2.2 Crisis Categories

#### Category A: Conflict-Related Crises

| Subcategory | Description | Examples |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **A1: Active hostilities** | Armed conflict affecting civilian areas | Military operations, bombardment, ground combat |
| **A2: Displacement** | Mass population movement from conflict | Evacuation, flight, forced displacement |
| **A3: Siege/blockade** | Access restrictions causing deprivation | Supply cutoffs, movement restrictions, encirclement |
| **A4: Infrastructure destruction** | Critical infrastructure loss from conflict | Hospital destruction, water system damage, power grid collapse |

#### Category B: Natural Disasters

| Subcategory | Description | Examples |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **B1: Geological** | Earth-related events | Earthquakes, landslides |
| **B2: Meteorological** | Weather-related events | Floods, severe storms, extreme heat/cold |
| **B3: Environmental** | Environmental degradation events | Droughts, water contamination, crop failure |

#### Category C: Public Health Emergencies

| Subcategory | Description | Examples |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **C1: Epidemic/pandemic** | Infectious disease outbreaks | COVID-19-type events, cholera outbreaks |
| **C2: Mass poisoning** | Toxic exposure events | Chemical contamination, food safety failures |
| **C3: Healthcare collapse** | Health system overwhelm | Hospital capacity exhaustion, supply chain failure |

#### Category D: Economic Emergencies

| Subcategory | Description | Examples |
|-------------|-------------|----------|
| **D1: Acute shortage** | Sudden supply failures | Fuel crisis, food shortage, medicine unavailability |
| **D2: Currency/financial collapse** | Economic system failures | Hyperinflation, banking system collapse |
| **D3: Employment crisis** | Mass livelihood loss | Sudden mass unemployment, wage payment failure |

### 2.3 Severity Levels

Each crisis is classified by severity level, determining response intensity:

| Level | Name | Criteria | Response Scope |
|-------|------|----------|----------------|
| **Level 1** | Localized | Affects single community or small geographic area; <1,000 affected; normal capacity partially sufficient | Enhanced monitoring; targeted resource deployment |
| **Level 2** | Regional | Affects multiple communities or significant area; 1,000-10,000 affected; normal capacity insufficient | Full emergency activation in affected area; resource surge |
| **Level 3** | Major | Affects large population or critical systems; 10,000-100,000 affected; institutional stress | Full MCF emergency mode; external coordination activated |
| **Level 4** | Catastrophic | Affects majority of population or multiple critical systems; >100,000 affected; existential institutional threat | Maximum emergency response; guarantor direct involvement; potential phase regression |

### 2.4 Compound Crises

**Compound crisis** designation applies when:

- Two or more crisis categories are simultaneously active, OR
- A single crisis triggers cascading effects across multiple categories, OR
- Crisis duration exceeds 30 days with no resolution trajectory

Compound crises automatically escalate one severity level from the highest individual component level (up to Level 4 maximum).

---

## 3. Crisis Detection and Activation

### 3.1 Early Warning System

MCF maintains continuous monitoring across crisis indicators:

#### Monitoring Responsibilities

| Domain | Primary Monitor | Secondary Monitor |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Security/conflict | JSVC | Guarantor observers |
| Public health | Health liaison offices | WHO country representatives |
| Natural disaster | Civil defense coordination | Regional meteorological services |
| Economic | Economic liaison offices | Guarantor economic monitors |

#### Early Warning Indicators

| Category | Key Indicators |
|----------|----------------|
| **Conflict-related** | Troop movements, artillery positioning, aerial activity, civilian evacuation patterns, communication intercepts |
| **Natural disaster** | Meteorological forecasts, seismic activity, water levels, drought indices |
| **Public health** | Disease surveillance data, hospital admission rates, mortality patterns, supply chain status |
| **Economic** | Price indices, supply availability, employment data, currency stability, border crossing volumes |

### 3.2 Activation Triggers

#### Automatic Activation Triggers

The following conditions trigger **automatic** crisis activation without requiring deliberation:

| Trigger | Crisis Level | Immediate Actions |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| Mass casualty event (≥50 casualties in 24 hours)* | Level 3 minimum | Emergency operations center activation; guarantor notification |
| Hospital system saturation (>90% capacity with projected increase) | Level 2 minimum | Medical PCC priority mode; resource request to guarantors |
| Critical infrastructure failure (water/power >72 hours) | Level 2 minimum | Emergency supply activation; repair prioritization |
| Mass displacement (>5,000 persons in 48 hours) | Level 2 minimum | Shelter activation; humanitarian corridor establishment |
| Epidemic declaration by recognized health authority | Level 2 minimum | Public health protocols; border coordination |

*Mass casualty threshold note: The ≥50 casualty threshold here is for humanitarian crisis activation. Different thresholds apply elsewhere: [Shock-Absorber Protocols](../01-phase-0-institutions/04-shock-absorber-protocols.md) use 5+ deaths for Tier 4 response escalation (lower threshold for immediate security response); [Phase Regression](03-phase-regression.md) uses ≥20 fatalities for regression trigger assessment (mid-level threshold for framework stability). These thresholds serve different purposes and are not contradictory.*

#### Discretionary Activation

For conditions not meeting automatic triggers, activation may be requested by:

- JSVC Executive Director
- Either party's MCF liaison
- Any guarantor representative
- Humanitarian Coordinator (when appointed)

Discretionary activation requires:

- Written request with situation assessment
- JSVC emergency session within 6 hours
- Simple majority vote (if JSVC quorum present) or Executive Director decision (if quorum unavailable)

### 3.3 Activation Procedure

```
CRISIS ACTIVATION SEQUENCE

1. Detection
   ├── Automatic trigger met → Proceed to step 2 immediately
   └── Discretionary request → JSVC emergency session

2. Initial Classification
   ├── Category determination (A/B/C/D)
   ├── Severity level assignment (1-4)
   └── Compound crisis assessment

3. Notification Cascade (within 30 minutes of activation)
   ├── Emergency hotline activation
   ├── Party liaison notification
   ├── Guarantor notification

```

### 3.4 False Alarm and Deactivation

If a crisis is activated but conditions do not materialize:

- Deactivation requires same authority as activation
- "Lessons learned" documentation mandatory
- No penalty for good-faith activation that proves unnecessary
- Resources mobilized but unused return to pre-positioned status

---

## 4. Response Architecture

#### Surge Capacity

Beyond pre-positioned teams, surge capacity is mobilized through:

1. **Staff recall**: Off-duty MCF personnel activation
2. **Guarantor deployment**: Personnel from guarantor countries
3. **NGO coordination**: Pre-agreed surge arrangements with humanitarian NGOs
4. **Contractor activation**: Pre-approved emergency contractors

### 4.4 Geographic Response Zones

During crisis, geographic response zones are established:

| Zone | Definition | Access | Authority |
|------|------------|--------|-----------|
| **Red Zone** | Immediate crisis area; active danger | Humanitarian responders only; armed escort where necessary | EOC tactical control |
| **Orange Zone** | Adjacent areas; elevated risk | Essential personnel; humanitarian access | EOC coordination |
| **Yellow Zone** | Staging areas; low risk | Logistics, support, coordination | Normal MCF procedures with enhanced monitoring |

- **Cluster system** interface (where applicable)
- **Bilateral coordination** with major NGOs
- **UN agency coordination** (OCHA, UNHCR, WFP, WHO, UNICEF)

#### Resource Integration

External resources are integrated through:

1. **Mapping**: Identify what resources external actors can provide
2. **Gap analysis**: Determine what external resources are needed vs. internal capacity
3. **Request**: Formal or informal requests based on relationship
4. **Coordination**: Ensure external resources complement rather than duplicate
5. **Reporting**: Include external resources in overall response reporting

---

## 6. Protected Corridor Operations

### 6.1 PCC Emergency Mode

During humanitarian crisis, PCCs shift to emergency operating mode:

#### Activation

PCC emergency mode is activated:

- Automatically for Level 2+ crises
- By EOC Director for Level 1 crises with PCC implications
- By PCC Directorate for localized PCC-specific emergencies

#### Mode Characteristics

| Aspect | Normal Mode | Emergency Mode |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Operating hours** | Standard hours per PCC type | 24-hour operation authorized |
| **Throughput priority** | Balanced usage | Humanitarian priority absolute |
| **Personnel** | Standard staffing | Surge staffing authorized |
| **Security** | Standard protocols | Enhanced security or reduced checkpoints (situation-dependent) |
| **Documentation** | Standard requirements | Expedited processing; post-hoc documentation accepted |

### 6.2 Humanitarian Corridors

Beyond standing PCCs, temporary **humanitarian corridors** may be established:

#### Establishment Authority

| Duration | Authority |
|----------|-----------|
| <72 hours | EOC Director |
| 72 hours - 14 days | JSVC (or EOC Director with guarantor concurrence) |
| >14 days | JSVC with guarantor certification |

#### Corridor Specifications

Humanitarian corridors include:

- Defined route with GPS coordinates
- Designated entry/exit points
- Operating hours (typically 24-hour during acute crisis)
- Vehicle/personnel identification requirements
- Security arrangements (ceasefire, safe passage guarantees)
- Communication protocols

#### Corridor Types

| Type | Purpose | Typical Duration |
|------|---------|------------------|
| **Evacuation corridor** | Civilian movement from danger area | 24-72 hours |
| **Supply corridor** | Humanitarian supply delivery | Duration of supply need |
| **Medical corridor** | Patient transfer and medical access | Ongoing during medical emergency |
| **Mixed-use corridor** | Combined evacuation and supply | Variable |

### 6.3 Medical PCC Priority

During all crisis levels, medical PCCs operate under enhanced priority:

| Medical PCC Function | Crisis Priority Level |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Emergency patient transfer | Absolute priority; no other traffic may delay |
| Urgent medical supply | Priority over all non-emergency traffic |
| Non-urgent medical supply | Priority over commercial traffic |
| Healthcare personnel movement | Priority over non-essential personnel |

### 6.4 PCC Protection During Conflict

During Category A (conflict-related) crises:

#### Ceasefire Arrangements

- MCF requests humanitarian ceasefires for PCC operation
- Ceasefire requests are transmitted through guarantor channels
- Ceasefires are time-limited and geographically defined
- Violation of humanitarian ceasefire is documented and reported

#### Continued Operation Under Risk

If ceasefire is not achieved:

| Risk Level | PCC Operation |
|------------|---------------|
| **Sporadic, indirect fire** | Enhanced security; continue operation with risk acknowledgment |
| **Active combat in vicinity** | Suspension until conditions improve; medical PCC throughput reduction only |
| **Direct targeting of PCC** | Immediate suspension; guarantor notification; war crimes documentation |

**Absolute rule:** MCF personnel are not ordered into situations of direct combat targeting. Volunteer-only operation under combat risk.

- Provide accountability for protection

Tracking is conducted with:

- Voluntary registration (not mandatory)
- Data protection protocols
- Sharing only with humanitarian actors and for protection purposes
- No use for political or security purposes

### 7.3 Protection from Violence

During crisis, MCF protection mechanisms include:

#### Safe Areas

Where feasible, MCF may designate **safe areas**:

- Geographically defined zones
- Civilian-only presence (no armed actors)
- Humanitarian services concentrated
- Enhanced monitoring by guarantors

Safe areas are:

- Requested by MCF, not unilaterally declared
- Require party agreement or guarantor guarantee
- Time-limited and renewable
- Not a substitute for broader civilian protection

#### Documentation

All protection incidents are documented:

- Incident date, time, location
- Nature of incident (attack, threat, harassment, etc.)

---

## 9. Communication During Crisis

### 9.1 Crisis Communication Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Speed** | Initial communication within 2 hours of activation |
| **Accuracy** | Only confirmed information; clearly label uncertain information |
| **Consistency** | Single message across all channels; no contradictory statements |
| **Frequency** | Regular updates (minimum every 6 hours during acute phase) |
| **Accessibility** | Multiple languages; multiple formats; reach affected populations |

### 9.2 Communication Channels

Per Communication Protocols Section 5 (Emergency Communications), crisis communication uses:

| Channel | Purpose | Activation |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **Emergency hotline** | Party-to-party urgent communication | Activated at crisis declaration |
| **Public notification system** | Population alerts and information | EOC Communications Chief |
| **Media briefings** | Journalist information | Scheduled or as needed |
| **Social media** | Rapid public updates | Continuous during crisis |
| **Community outreach** | Affected population direct communication | Field teams |

### 9.3 Information Management

#### Situation Reports

**Situation Reports (SitReps)** are issued:

| Crisis Level | Frequency | Distribution |
|--------------|-----------|--------------|
| Level 1 | Daily | Internal MCF; parties |
| Level 2 | Every 12 hours | Internal MCF; parties; guarantors |
| Level 3 | Every 6 hours | All stakeholders |
| Level 4 | Every 3 hours | All stakeholders |

SitRep content:

- Current situation summary
- Affected population numbers
- Response actions taken
- Resources deployed
- Gaps and needs
- Outlook and next steps

#### Information Verification

During crisis, misinformation risk increases. MCF applies:

- Multiple-source verification for significant claims
- Clear labeling of confirmed vs. unconfirmed information
- Rapid response to false information
- Coordination with external actors on information
- No amplification of unverified information

### 9.4 Population Communication

Affected populations receive:

| Information Type | Delivery Method | Frequency |
|------------------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Safety information** | SMS, radio, loudspeaker | Immediate and ongoing |
| **Service availability** | Posted notices, community meetings | Daily |
| **Evacuation/movement guidance** | All channels | As needed |
| **Family tracing information** | Registration points, hotlines | Ongoing |
| **Return information** | All channels | When conditions permit |

---

## 10. Recovery and Transition

### 10.1 Crisis Deactivation

A crisis is deactivated when:

- Immediate threat to civilian life is resolved
- Normal institutional capacity is restored
- Ongoing needs can be met through normal procedures

#### Deactivation Authority

| Level | Deactivation Authority |
|-------|----------------------|
| Level 1 | EOC Director |
| Level 2 | JSVC with EOC recommendation |
| Level 3 | JSVC with guarantor concurrence |
| Level 4 | JSVC with guarantor certification |

#### Phased Deactivation

For Level 3+ crises, deactivation is typically phased:

```
PHASED DEACTIVATION

Phase 1: Acute Response → Stabilization
- EOC remains activated
- Surge personnel begin demobilization
- Response shifts from emergency to support
- Triggered when: immediate threats resolved

Phase 2: Stabilization → Recovery
- EOC transitions to Recovery Coordination
- Humanitarian Coordinator mandate reviewed
- Focus shifts to medium-term needs
- Triggered when: basic services restored

Phase 3: Recovery → Normal Operations
- EOC deactivated
- Remaining needs transferred to normal MCF operations
- Lessons learned process initiated
- Triggered when: affected population needs met through normal channels
```

### 10.2 Recovery Coordination

Post-crisis recovery includes:

| Recovery Domain | Lead Responsibility | Key Activities |
|-----------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Infrastructure** | PCC Directorate + parties | Repair, reconstruction, system restoration |
| **Livelihoods** | Economic architecture offices | Employment support, business recovery, compensation |
| **Health** | Health liaison offices | Ongoing medical care, psychosocial support |
| **Protection** | CRC (Phase 1+) | Continued vulnerable population support |
| **Displacement** | JSVC + party coordination | Return facilitation, shelter transition |

### 10.3 Lessons Learned

Every crisis activation triggers a lessons learned process:

#### Timeline

| Activity | Timeline |
|----------|----------|
| Initial data collection | During crisis |
| Staff debriefings | Within 14 days of deactivation |
| After-Action Report draft | Within 30 days of deactivation |
| Stakeholder review | 30-60 days post-deactivation |
| Final report | Within 90 days of deactivation |
| Implementation of recommendations | Ongoing |

#### Report Content

After-Action Reports include:

1. Crisis summary (category, level, duration, scope)
2. Response timeline
3. Resources deployed
4. What worked well
5. What did not work well
6. Recommendations for improvement
7. Resource adequacy assessment
8. External coordination assessment
9. Specific protocol amendments recommended

### 10.4 Protocol Amendment

Crisis experience may indicate need for protocol amendments:

- Recommendations from After-Action Reports are compiled
- Annual review of crisis protocols considers all recommendations
- Amendments follow Amendment Procedures (05-amendment-procedures.md)
- Urgent amendments (safety-critical) may be expedited

---

## 11. Mass Casualty Protocols

### 11.1 Definition

A **mass casualty event** is any incident resulting in:

- 50+ casualties (dead or injured) in 24 hours, OR
- Casualty numbers exceeding local medical capacity, OR
- Multiple simultaneous casualty-producing incidents

Mass casualty events automatically trigger Level 3 crisis minimum.

### 11.2 Immediate Response

```

```

### 11.3 Casualty Management

#### Triage

Triage follows international standards (START or equivalent):

| Category | Definition | Response |
|----------|------------|----------|
| **Immediate (Red)** | Life-threatening, treatable | Immediate transport to surgical capacity |
| **Delayed (Yellow)** | Serious but stable | Treatment within hours |
| **Minor (Green)** | Walking wounded | Self-care or delayed treatment |
| **Deceased/Expectant (Black)** | Dead or unsurvivable | Morgue or comfort care |

#### Patient Tracking

Mass casualty patient tracking includes:

- Unique identifier assignment at triage
- Location tracking through treatment chain
- Family notification coordination
- Hospital-to-hospital transfer tracking
- Discharge and outcome recording

#### Deceased Management

Deceased management respects:

- Cultural and religious requirements
- Identification and documentation
- Family notification
- Proper remains handling
- Death registration

### 11.4 Terrorism and Intentional Mass Casualty

For mass casualty events resulting from intentional attacks:

- Security response per Shock-Absorber Protocols (parallel track)
- Humanitarian response per these protocols (parallel track)
- No humanitarian response conditioned on security response
- Evidence preservation where possible without impeding medical care
- Heightened security for responders and facilities

## 12. Integration with Other Protocols

### 12.1 Shock-Absorber Integration

| Incident Tier | Humanitarian Crisis Interaction |
|---------------|--------------------------------|
| **Tier 1** | Unlikely to trigger crisis; monitoring only |
| **Tier 2** | May trigger Level 1 crisis; enhanced monitoring |
| **Tier 3** | Likely triggers Level 2 crisis; EOC standby |
| **Tier 4** | Automatic Level 3 crisis; full EOC activation |
| **Beyond Tier 4*** | Automatic Level 3-4 crisis; humanitarian coordinator |

*Shock-Absorber Protocols define Tiers 1-4 only. Incidents exceeding Tier 4 parameters (extended duration, framework-threatening scope) trigger Level 3-4 humanitarian crisis response with mandatory humanitarian coordinator appointment.*

#### Parallel Operation

Shock-absorber and humanitarian protocols operate in parallel:

- Security response: party and JSVC per shock-absorber
- Humanitarian response: EOC per crisis protocols
- Neither constrains the other
- Communication coordination to avoid conflicting messages

### 12.2 PCC Protocol Integration

See Section 6 above for detailed PCC integration.

Key integration points:

- PCC emergency mode activation
- Medical PCC priority
- Humanitarian corridor establishment
- PCC protection during conflict

### 12.3 Communication Protocol Integration

Crisis communication follows Communication Protocols (07-communication-protocols.md):

- Emergency channel activation (Section 5)
- Public notification procedures (Section 4)
- Party notification timelines (Section 2)
- Guarantor notification (Section 3)

Crisis-specific additions:

- Increased update frequency
- Humanitarian-specific messaging
- Affected population communication priority
- External humanitarian actor coordination

### 12.4 Phase Regression Interface

Level 4 crises may indicate need for phase regression:

- Humanitarian Coordinator may recommend regression (advisory only)
- EOC Director reports regression considerations to JSVC
- Actual regression decision per Phase Regression Protocols (03-phase-regression.md)
- Crisis response continues regardless of regression decision
