# Enhanced Dual-State Path

**Parent Document:** [00-overview.md](00-overview.md)

**Applies To:** Phase 3 end-state selection and implementation

**Objective:** Define the dual-state option where two fully independent states maintain strong cooperation derived from MCF.

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## 1. Definition

### 1.1 What Enhanced Dual-State Means

**Enhanced Dual-State:** Two fully independent, internationally recognized states with strong bilateral cooperation mechanisms derived from MCF experience.

This path:
- Resolves sovereignty through separation
- Preserves cooperation through treaties
- Transforms MCF institutions into bilateral bodies
- Replaces CMS with visa/work arrangements

### 1.2 Key Characteristics

| Dimension | Dual-State Approach |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Sovereignty | Fully separate |
| Citizenship | Separate national citizenships |
| Territory | Defined, recognized borders |
| Government | Two independent governments |
| Military | Separate armed forces with coordination |
| Currency | Separate or coordinated (by choice) |
| Foreign Policy | Separate foreign policies |

### 1.3 Comparison to Alternatives

| Feature | Confederation | Federation | Dual-State |
|---------|--------------|------------|------------|
| Sovereignty merger | Partial (confederal layer) | Full | None |
| Shared institutions | Permanent | Federal | Bilateral by treaty |
| Border | Open (SAZs) | None | Managed |
| Political merger | No | Yes | No |
| Complexity | Medium | High | Lower |
