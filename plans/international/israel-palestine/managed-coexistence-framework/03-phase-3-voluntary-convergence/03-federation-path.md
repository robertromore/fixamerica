# Federation Path

**Parent Document:** [00-overview.md](00-overview.md)

**Applies To:** Phase 3 end-state selection and implementation

**Objective:** Define the federation option where populations merge into a single federal state with shared sovereignty.

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## 1. Definition

### 1.1 What Federation Means

**Federation:** Populations choose to merge into a single federal state with shared sovereignty, replacing two separate national governments with one federal government plus regional units.

This is the most transformative end state, requiring:
- Single federal citizenship
- Single foreign policy
- Single military (or unified command)
- Federal constitution binding all residents
- Regional autonomy within federal structure

### 1.2 Key Characteristics

| Dimension | Federation Approach |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Sovereignty | Single (merged) |
| Citizenship | Single federal citizenship with regional identity |
| Territory | Unified territory with regional subdivisions |
| Government | Two levels: federal and regional |
| Military | Single federal military |
| Currency | Single federal currency |
| Foreign Policy | Single federal foreign ministry |

### 1.3 Comparison to Alternatives

| Feature | Confederation | Federation | Dual-State |
|---------|--------------|------------|------------|
| National armies | Yes | No | Yes |
| National foreign policy | Yes | No | Yes |
| Single citizenship | No (dual) | Yes | No |
| Constitutional merger | No | Yes | No |
| Irreversibility | Reversible | Difficult to reverse | Reversible |

| Cross-community leadership support | Formal endorsements |
| Economic convergence indicators met | Economic analysis |
| All MCF institutions fully integrated | Institutional audit |
