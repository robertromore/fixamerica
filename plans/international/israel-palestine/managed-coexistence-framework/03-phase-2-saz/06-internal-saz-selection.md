# Internal SAZ Site Selection

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#internal-saz-site-selection-phase-2)

**Phase:** Phase 2 preparation

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## Purpose

Internal SAZ Site Selection defines the **criteria and process for identifying suitable locations** for Special Administrative Zones within the contested territory.

Site selection is among the most politically fraught decisions in the MCF framework. The wrong site can doom an SAZ before it begins. The right site—one with genuine local demand, manageable security conditions, and demonstration potential—can prove that Israeli-Palestinian coexistence is possible.

---

## Selection Principles

### 1. Voluntary Participation Primacy

No SAZ can be established over the objection of existing residents. This is not just pragmatic—it is foundational. MCF is built on voluntarism. Forcing an SAZ on unwilling populations would:
- Violate core MCF principles
- Guarantee resistance and failure
- Discredit the entire framework
- Create exactly the coercion MCF seeks to avoid

**Implication:** Site selection begins with demand, not with geographic logic.

### 2. Risk Minimization

Early SAZs bear disproportionate risk. They must succeed or the project stalls. This means:
- Selecting sites with the highest probability of success
- Avoiding sites where failure is most likely
- Accepting that the best sites by other criteria may not be feasible early

**Implication:** Risk-adjusted selection, not pure optimization.

### 3. Demonstration Potential

Early SAZs must demonstrate that coexistence works. Sites should:
- Be visible enough to influence perceptions
- Produce transferable lessons
- Generate positive stories
- Show that SAZs improve lives

**Implication:** Not too marginal, not too central—visible but manageable.

### 4. Scalability Considerations

Site selection should enable future expansion. This means:
- Sites that can grow if successful
- Sites that connect to potential future SAZ locations
- Sites that don't create isolated enclaves
- Sites that demonstrate principles applicable elsewhere

**Implication:** Think beyond the first SAZ to the network.

## Selection Criteria

### 1. Security Criteria

Security is the threshold criterion. Sites that cannot be made secure are excluded regardless of other merits.

#### 1.1 Current Security Conditions

| Condition | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Active violence | Disqualifying if ongoing |
| Recent violence | High-risk if within 2 years |
| Threat environment | Must be manageable with SAZ police + guarantor backup |
| Criminal activity | Must be controllable |
| Factional presence | Must be clearable |

**Indicators:**
- Incident counts (attacks, shootings, etc.)
- Fatality statistics
- Security force presence
- Faction activity
- Smuggling and criminal networks

#### 1.2 Proximity to Conflict Zones

**Distance from Active Conflict:**
- Minimum 5 km from active frontlines
- Minimum 10 km from major military installations
- Buffer from areas with regular security operations

**Rationale:** Spillover from nearby conflict undermines SAZ stability and credibility.

#### 1.3 Defensibility

**Geographic Defensibility:**
- Clear boundaries (natural or constructible)
- Entry points controllable
- No easy infiltration routes
- Defensible without militarization

**Defensibility Does Not Mean:**
- Military fortification
- Walls or barriers
- Aggressive posture

It means: Reasonable ability to control access and maintain demilitarization.

#### 1.4 Access Routes

**Access Requirements:**
- Reliable access from external guarantors
- Multiple access routes (no single chokepoint)
- Routes not controlled by hostile actors
- Humanitarian access guaranteed

**Access Matters Because:**
- Guarantor rapid response depends on access
- Economic viability requires trade access
- Resident mobility requires exit options
- Siege vulnerability undermines SAZ viability

### 2. Demographic Criteria

#### 2.1 Mixed Population Feasibility

**Ideal Site:**
- Existing mixed population (Israeli and Palestinian)
- History of coexistence or cooperation
- No recent severe intercommunal violence
- Willingness to participate in mixed governance

**Challenging but Possible:**
- Adjacent communities willing to merge
- Single community willing to accept others
- Diaspora settlement in underutilized area

**Disqualifying:**
- Overwhelming opposition from existing residents
- Recent severe intercommunal violence
- No realistic pathway to mixed population

#### 2.2 Existing Community Relations

**Positive Indicators:**
- Economic cooperation across communities
- Personal relationships (work, friendship)
- Shared resource management
- Civil society connections

**Negative Indicators:**
- Recent violence between communities
- Complete segregation
- Mutual fear and suspicion
- History of displacement by other community

#### 2.3 Voluntary Participation Rates

**Participation Must Be Genuinely Voluntary:**
- Referendum or survey showing majority support
- Support from both communities present
- Not coerced by economic or security pressure
- Informed consent (understanding what SAZ means)

**Minimum Thresholds:**
- 60% overall support for SAZ establishment
- 40% minimum support from each community
- Support verified by independent monitors

#### 2.4 Population Stability

**Stable Population Preferred:**
- Low displacement rates
- Families with roots in area
- Intergenerational presence
- Commitment to staying

**Population Volatility Risks:**
- Influx of opponents
- Exodus of supporters
- Demographic manipulation
- Instability in governance

### 3. Economic Criteria

#### 3.1 Economic Viability

**SAZ Must Be Economically Sustainable:**
- Employment opportunities
- Business potential
- Trade connections
- Not pure dependency

**Indicators:**
- Existing economic activity
- Skill levels of population
- Natural resources
- Location advantages

#### 3.2 Infrastructure Availability

**Minimum Infrastructure:**
- Housing (adequate for population)
- Water supply
- Power supply
- Waste management
- Roads
- Telecommunications

**Infrastructure Gaps:**
- Can be addressed with investment
- Timeline must be realistic

- Not a disqualifier but a cost

#### 3.3 Employment Potential

**Employment Sources:**
- Local economy
- SAZ government
- External employers (cross-boundary work)
- Remote work
- SAZ economic development

**Unemployment Risks:**
- Idle population creates instability
- Economic grievances undermine support
- Young men without work are recruitment targets

#### 3.4 Resource Access

**Key Resources:**
- Water (critical in the region)
- Agricultural land
- Energy
- Construction materials

**Resource Conflicts:**
- Must be resolvable
- Water rights clear or adjudicable
- Land tenure clarified before SAZ establishment

### 4. Political Criteria

#### 4.1 Political Sensitivity

**Low Sensitivity Preferred:**
- Not central to national narratives
- Not symbolically crucial to either side
- Not historically contentious
- Not claimed as non-negotiable

**High Sensitivity Sites:**
- May become viable later
- Early SAZs should avoid
- Success elsewhere reduces sensitivity

#### 4.2 Symbolic Significance

**Avoid Early:**
- Sites with overwhelming symbolic weight
- Historical massacre sites
- National founding myth locations
- Sites of recent trauma

**Consider Later:**
- Success elsewhere may make these possible
- Symbolic sites benefit from proven model
- Failure at symbolic site has outsized impact

#### 4.3 Stakeholder Positions

**Key Stakeholders:**
- Israeli government
- Palestinian Authority / Hamas
- Local governments
- Military/security forces
- Settler organizations
- Palestinian factions
- Religious authorities
- Civil society

**Stakeholder Mapping:**
- Who supports?
- Who opposes?
- Who is neutral?
- Who can be persuaded?

#### 4.4 International Implications

**International Considerations:**
- Legality under international law
- Guarantor positions
- Precedent effects
- UN/EU stances

**Sites to Avoid:**
- Those creating international legal disputes
- Those that divide guarantors
- Those that invite Security Council controversy

---

## Excluded Areas

### 1. Jerusalem (Special Exclusion)

Jerusalem is **explicitly excluded from SAZ consideration** until Phase 3 or beyond.

**Rationale:**
- Central to both national and religious identities
- Overwhelming symbolic significance
- International legal complexity (final status issue)
- Failure risk too high for early phases

**Jerusalem Pathway:**
- Addressed separately in [Jerusalem document](../06-sensitive-issues/02-jerusalem.md)
- May develop SAZ-like mechanisms later
- After model proven elsewhere

### 2. High-Sensitivity Religious Sites

**Excluded:**
- Hebron/Al-Khalil (Cave of the Patriarchs)
- Rachel's Tomb
- Joseph's Tomb
- Major mosque complexes
- Major synagogue/church locations

**Rationale:**
- Religious significance creates zero-sum dynamics
- Failure would have religious dimension
- Better addressed after model proven

### 3. Active Conflict Zones

**Excluded:**
- Gaza (until comprehensive security transformation)
- Areas with ongoing military operations
- Frontline areas
- Areas with uncontrolled armed factions

**Rationale:**
- Security threshold cannot be met
- SAZ would be target for spoilers
- Guarantor commitment insufficient for active conflict zones

### 4. Areas with Overwhelming Opposition

**Excluded:**
- Where 50%+ oppose SAZ establishment
- Where either community opposes by 60%+
- Where local leaders unanimously oppose
- Where opposition is violent

**Rationale:**
- Voluntary participation is foundational
- Imposed SAZ would fail
- Failure discredits framework

---

## Multiple SAZ Sequencing

### 1. Pilot First Approach

**First Internal SAZ:**
- Highest probability of success
- Reasonable demonstration potential
- Manageable size
- Intensive support

**Learning from Pilot:**
- 3-5 year operation before second SAZ
- Comprehensive assessment
- Model refinement
- Lessons documented

### 2. Expansion Criteria

**Second and Subsequent SAZs When:**
- First SAZ stable for 3+ years
- Positive lessons transferable
- Demand from additional communities
- Capacity to support expansion

**Expansion Not Automatic:**
- Each SAZ separately assessed
- Each requires local consent
- Each has own conditions

### 3. Coordination Requirements

**Multiple SAZs Coordinated:**
- Common legal framework
- Shared institutions where appropriate
- Resource sharing
- Personnel rotation
- Experience exchange

**But Also Independent:**
- Each SAZ governs itself
- No SAZ controls another
- Failure of one doesn't automatically affect others

### 4. Learning Integration

**Systematic Learning:**
- Each SAZ contributes to knowledge base
- Successes and failures analyzed
- Model updated based on experience
- New SAZs benefit from accumulated learning

---

## Boundary Modification

### 1. Modification Triggers

**Expansion:**
- Adjacent community petitions for inclusion
- Current SAZ demonstrates capacity
- Security conditions permit
- Economic integration beneficial

**Contraction:**
- Security deterioration in portion of SAZ
- Resident departure from area
- Governance capacity exceeded
- Phase regression applicable to portion

### 2. Modification Process

**Expansion:**
1. Petition from adjacent community (majority support)
2. Feasibility assessment
3. SAZ Council approval (supermajority)
4. Guarantor certification
5. Local referendum in expansion area
6. Integration plan implementation

**Contraction:**
1. Trigger conditions documented
2. Assessment by JSVC and guarantors
3. Notification to affected residents
4. Transition period (minimum 90 days)
5. Orderly withdrawal of SAZ jurisdiction
6. Status of area clarified (return to prior status or other)

### 3. Resident Protection During Modification

**Expansion:**
- New residents have same rights as original
- No discrimination based on entry timing
- Transition assistance for integration

**Contraction:**
- Affected residents may relocate to continuing SAZ
- Relocation assistance provided
- Property rights protected
- No abandonment without transition plan

### 4. Shrinkage vs. Expansion

**Bias Toward Stability:**
- Neither expansion nor contraction is favored
- Each assessed on merits
- Stability valued over growth
- Contraction is not failure (may be prudent risk management)

**Contraction as Feature:**
- SAZ can shrink to survive
- Better to contract than collapse
- Institutional continuity preserved in core
- Expansion possible after stabilization
