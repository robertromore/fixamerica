# Internal SAZ Site Selection

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#internal-saz-site-selection-phase-2)

**Phase:** Phase 2 preparation

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## Purpose

Internal SAZ Site Selection defines the **criteria and process for identifying suitable locations** for Special Administrative Zones within the contested territory.

Site selection is among the most politically fraught decisions in the MCF framework. The wrong site can doom an SAZ before it begins. The right site—one with genuine local demand, manageable security conditions, and demonstration potential—can prove that Israeli-Palestinian coexistence is possible.

---

## Selection Principles

### 1. Voluntary Participation Primacy

No SAZ can be established without demonstrated resident consent through referendum. This is not just pragmatic—it is foundational. MCF is built on voluntarism. Imposing an SAZ without majority support would:

- Violate core MCF principles
- Guarantee resistance and failure
- Discredit the entire framework
- Create exactly the coercion MCF seeks to avoid

**Consent Model (not unanimity):** The consent requirement is supermajority threshold (55% approval, 30% per-community), not unanimity. Individual residents may oppose and remain protected (see Section "Protection for Dissenters"). The principle prohibits establishing SAZs where consent thresholds are not met—not where any individual objects.

**Implication:** Site selection begins with demand, not with geographic logic.

### 2. Risk Minimization

Early SAZs bear disproportionate risk. They must succeed or the project stalls. This means:
- Selecting sites with the highest probability of success
- Avoiding sites where failure is most likely
- Accepting that the best sites by other criteria may not be feasible early

**Implication:** Risk-adjusted selection, not pure optimization.

### 3. Demonstration Potential

Early SAZs must demonstrate that coexistence works. Sites should:
- Be visible enough to influence perceptions
- Produce transferable lessons
- Generate positive stories
- Show that SAZs improve lives

**Implication:** Not too marginal, not too central—visible but manageable.

### 4. Scalability Considerations

Site selection should enable future expansion. This means:
- Sites that can grow if successful
- Sites that connect to potential future SAZ locations
- Sites that don't create isolated enclaves
- Sites that demonstrate principles applicable elsewhere

**Implication:** Think beyond the first SAZ to the network.

## Selection Criteria

### 1. Security Criteria

Security is the threshold criterion. Sites that cannot be made secure are excluded regardless of other merits.

#### 1.1 Current Security Conditions

| Condition | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Active violence | Disqualifying if ongoing |
| Recent violence | High-risk if within 2 years |
| Threat environment | Must be manageable with SAZ police + guarantor backup |
| Criminal activity | Must be controllable |
| Factional presence | Must be clearable |

**Indicators:**
- Incident counts (attacks, shootings, etc.)
- Fatality statistics
- Security force presence
- Faction activity
- Smuggling and criminal networks

#### 1.2 Proximity to Conflict Zones

**Distance from Active Conflict:**
- Minimum 5 km from active frontlines
- Minimum 10 km from major military installations
- Buffer from areas with regular security operations

**Rationale:** Spillover from nearby conflict undermines SAZ stability and credibility.

#### 1.3 Defensibility

**Geographic Defensibility:**
- Clear boundaries (natural or constructible)
- Entry points controllable
- No easy infiltration routes
- Defensible without militarization

**Defensibility Does Not Mean:**
- Military fortification
- Walls or barriers
- Aggressive posture

It means: Reasonable ability to control access and maintain demilitarization.

#### 1.4 Access Routes

**Access Requirements:**
- Reliable access from external guarantors
- Multiple access routes (no single chokepoint)
- Routes not controlled by hostile actors
- Humanitarian access guaranteed

**Access Matters Because:**
- Guarantor rapid response depends on access
- Economic viability requires trade access
- Resident mobility requires exit options
- Siege vulnerability undermines SAZ viability

### 2. Demographic Criteria

#### 2.1 Mixed Population Feasibility

**Ideal Site:**
- Existing mixed population (Israeli and Palestinian)
- History of coexistence or cooperation
- No recent severe intercommunal violence
- Willingness to participate in mixed governance

**Challenging but Possible:**

- Adjacent communities willing to merge
- Single community willing to accept others (see **Single-Community Exception** in Section 2.3 for how thresholds apply)
- Diaspora settlement in underutilized area

**Single-Community Sites:** If one community constitutes <10% of the proposed SAZ population, the site may still be considered. The per-community threshold (30%) applies only to the majority community at establishment; it activates for the minority community once that community reaches 10% of population. This allows single-community sites to establish with the expectation of becoming mixed over time, while protecting minority newcomers from majoritarian capture once they reach meaningful presence.

**Disqualifying:**
- Overwhelming opposition from existing residents
- Recent severe intercommunal violence
- No realistic pathway to mixed population

#### 2.2 Existing Community Relations

**Positive Indicators:**
- Economic cooperation across communities
- Personal relationships (work, friendship)
- Shared resource management
- Civil society connections

**Negative Indicators:**
- Recent violence between communities
- Complete segregation
- Mutual fear and suspicion
- History of displacement by other community

#### 2.3 Voluntary Participation Rates

**Participation Must Be Genuinely Voluntary:**
- Referendum or survey showing majority support
- Support from both communities present
- Not coerced by economic or security pressure
- Informed consent (understanding what SAZ means)

**Minimum Thresholds (per [SAZ Legal Framework Section 2.6](01-saz-legal-framework.md#26-resident-consent-referendum)):**

| Threshold | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Participation** | ≥50% of eligible residents vote |
| **Approval** | ≥55% of votes cast in favor |
| **Per-community minimum** | ≥30% approval in each community present (see single-community exception below) |

**Eligibility:** Adult residents (18+) who have resided in proposed SAZ territory for ≥12 months.

**Single-Community Exception:** If the proposed SAZ has only one community with meaningful presence (the other community is <10% of population), the per-community threshold applies only to the majority community. The per-community threshold for the minority community activates once that community reaches 10% of SAZ population, tested at each 5-year review.

- Support verified by independent monitors (JSVC with guarantor observation)

#### 2.4 Population Stability

**Stable Population Preferred:**
- Low displacement rates
- Families with roots in area
- Intergenerational presence
- Commitment to staying

**Population Volatility Risks:**
- Influx of opponents
- Exodus of supporters
- Demographic manipulation
- Instability in governance

### 3. Economic Criteria

#### 3.1 Economic Viability

**SAZ Must Be Economically Sustainable:**
- Employment opportunities
- Business potential
- Trade connections
- Not pure dependency

**Indicators:**
- Existing economic activity
- Skill levels of population
- Natural resources
- Location advantages

#### 3.2 Infrastructure Availability

**Minimum Infrastructure:**
- Housing (adequate for population)
- Water supply
- Power supply
- Waste management
- Roads
- Telecommunications

**Infrastructure Gaps:**
- Can be addressed with investment
- Timeline must be realistic
- Funding must be secured
- Not a disqualifier but a cost

#### 3.3 Employment Potential

**Employment Sources:**
- Local economy
- SAZ government
- External employers (cross-boundary work)
- Remote work
- SAZ economic development

**Unemployment Risks:**
- Idle population creates instability
- Economic grievances undermine support
- Young men without work are recruitment targets

#### 3.4 Resource Access

**Key Resources:**
- Water (critical in the region)
- Agricultural land
- Energy
- Construction materials

**Resource Conflicts:**
- Must be resolvable
- Water rights clear or adjudicable
- Land tenure clarified before SAZ establishment

### 4. Political Criteria

#### 4.1 Political Sensitivity

**Low Sensitivity Preferred:**
- Not central to national narratives
- Not symbolically crucial to either side
- Not historically contentious
- Not claimed as non-negotiable

**High Sensitivity Sites:**
- May become viable later
- Early SAZs should avoid
- Success elsewhere reduces sensitivity

#### 4.2 Symbolic Significance

**Avoid Early:**
- Sites with overwhelming symbolic weight
- Historical massacre sites
- National founding myth locations
- Sites of recent trauma

**Consider Later:**
- Success elsewhere may make these possible
- Symbolic sites benefit from proven model
- Failure at symbolic site has outsized impact

#### 4.3 Stakeholder Positions

**Key Stakeholders:**
- Israeli government
- Palestinian Authority / Hamas
- Local governments
- Military/security forces
- Settler organizations
- Palestinian factions
- Religious authorities
- Civil society

**Stakeholder Mapping:**
- Who supports?
- Who opposes?
- Who is neutral?
- Who can be persuaded?

#### 4.4 International Implications

**International Considerations:**
- Legality under international law
- Guarantor positions
- Precedent effects
- UN/EU stances

**Sites to Avoid:**
- Those creating international legal disputes
- Those that divide guarantors
- Those that invite Security Council controversy

---

## Excluded Areas

### 1. Jerusalem (Special Exclusion)

Jerusalem is **explicitly excluded from SAZ consideration** until Phase 3 or beyond.

**Rationale:**
- Central to both national and religious identities
- Overwhelming symbolic significance
- International legal complexity (final status issue)
- Failure risk too high for early phases

**Jerusalem Pathway:**
- Addressed separately in [Jerusalem document](../06-sensitive-issues/02-jerusalem.md)
- May develop SAZ-like mechanisms later
- After model proven elsewhere

### 2. High-Sensitivity Religious Sites

**Excluded:**
- Hebron/Al-Khalil (Cave of the Patriarchs)
- Rachel's Tomb
- Joseph's Tomb
- Major mosque complexes
- Major synagogue/church locations

**Rationale:**
- Religious significance creates zero-sum dynamics
- Failure would have religious dimension
- Better addressed after model proven

### 3. Active Conflict Zones

**Excluded:**
- Gaza (until comprehensive security transformation)
- Areas with ongoing military operations
- Frontline areas
- Areas with uncontrolled armed factions

**Rationale:**
- Security threshold cannot be met
- SAZ would be target for spoilers
- Guarantor commitment insufficient for active conflict zones

### 4. Areas with Overwhelming Opposition

**Excluded:**
- Where 50%+ oppose SAZ establishment
- Where either community opposes by 60%+
- Where local leaders unanimously oppose
- Where opposition is violent

**Rationale:**
- Voluntary participation is foundational
- Imposed SAZ would fail
- Failure discredits framework

---

## Selection Process

### 1. Identification Phase

#### 1.1 Candidate Generation

**Sources of Candidates:**

- CMS participant surveys (where would you live in an SAZ?)
- Civil society proposals
- Academic studies
- International expert recommendations
- Local initiative (community petition)
- Confidential interest signaling (see below)

**Confidential Interest Signaling:**

Local leaders and communities may face retaliation from central authorities for publicly expressing SAZ interest (see Finding 18 analysis). To enable demand assessment without requiring premature public exposure:

- MCF Secretariat maintains a confidential channel for local officials and community organizations to signal SAZ interest
- Signaling is non-binding and does not constitute a petition
- MCF Secretariat assesses demand through confidential surveys of signaling communities before any public process begins
- Identity of signaling communities is protected under MCF data security protocols until the community decides to proceed to a formal petition
- Anti-intimidation protections (see [Anti-Intimidation Architecture Section 11.5](../02-phase-1-civic-membership/03-anti-intimidation.md)) apply to local officials and community leaders who participate in confidential interest signaling

**Initial List:**

- All proposed sites compiled (including confidential signals)
- No immediate filtering
- Geographic spread considered
- Both sides of Green Line considered

#### 1.2 Initial Screening

**Screening Criteria (disqualifying factors):**
- Active conflict zone
- Jerusalem or major religious sites
- Overwhelming local opposition
- No access routes
- Insufficient water

**Output:** Shortlist of potentially viable sites (expect 10-20)

#### 1.3 Feasibility Assessment

**For Each Shortlisted Site:**
- Security assessment
- Demographic analysis
- Economic viability study
- Political sensitivity analysis
- Infrastructure inventory
- Stakeholder mapping

**Output:** Detailed feasibility report for each site

**Assessment Conducted By:**
- Joint committee (MCF + guarantors)
- Independent experts
- Local input but not local control

### 2. Consultation Phase

#### 2.1 Community Consultation

**For Top-Ranked Sites:**
- Town hall meetings
- Household surveys
- Community leader consultations
- Civil society engagement

**Purpose:**
- Gauge genuine support (not imposed)
- Understand concerns
- Identify modifications needed
- Build local ownership

#### 2.2 Stakeholder Engagement

**Engage With:**
- Israeli government
- Palestinian Authority
- Local governments
- Security forces
- Civil society
- Diaspora organizations

**Purpose:**
- Identify opposition and support
- Negotiate accommodations
- Build coalition for selected site
- Preempt spoiler mobilization

#### 2.3 Guarantor Input

**Guarantor Assessment:**
- Security feasibility from guarantor perspective
- Resource commitment required
- Political viability
- Timeline constraints

**Guarantor Veto:**
- Guarantors can veto sites they cannot credibly guarantee
- Veto must be justified
- Alternative sites must be considered

#### 2.4 Public Deliberation

**Public Process:**
- Not secret site selection
- Transparent criteria
- Public feasibility reports
- Open comment period

**Rationale:**
- Builds legitimacy
- Surfaces concerns early
- Prevents perception of imposition
- Enables accountability

### 3. Decision Phase

#### 3.1 Decision Authority

**Who Decides:**

- Confederal Council recommends
- Guarantors certify feasibility
- **Both parties (Israeli and Palestinian authorities) must consent** (per [SAZ Legal Framework Section 2.1-2.5](01-saz-legal-framework.md#21-establishment-options))
- Local referendum confirms
- No single party can impose; equally, no SAZ can proceed without party consent
- **Exception:** For community-initiated petitions where a central authority files a non-substantive objection, the Blocked-Petition Escalation pathway applies (see [SAZ Legal Framework Section 2.4](01-saz-legal-framework.md#24-community-petition-model)). Guarantor Forum determination may authorize referendum under guarantor facilitation, with Non-Interference Conditionality as the structural incentive.

**Sequence (aligned with [SAZ Legal Framework Section 2.2](01-saz-legal-framework.md#22-bilateral-agreement-model)):**

1. Confederal Council ranks sites
2. Guarantors certify top choices
3. **Party consent to proceed to referendum** (parties agree to allow referendum; not yet final commitment)
4. Local referendum conducted
5. If referendum passes: **Formal agreement signed** (bilateral agreement, unilateral acceptance, or guarantor-facilitated agreement per Legal Framework)
6. First site with all approvals selected proceeds to implementation

**Note:** Party consent at step 3 is conditional—parties agree to allow the referendum but are not bound until step 5 (post-referendum agreement). This matches Legal Framework Section 2.2 where resident consent (referendum) precedes formal agreement signing.

#### 3.2 Decision Criteria Weighting

**Criteria Weights (indicative):**

| Criterion | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Security feasibility | 30% |
| Local support | 25% |
| Demonstration potential | 15% |
| Economic viability | 15% |
| Political feasibility | 15% |

**Weights Are Guides:**
- Not mechanical scoring
- Judgment required
- Some criteria are thresholds (security, support)

#### 3.3 Approval Requirements

**Required for Selection:**

- Confederal Council approval (supermajority)
- Guarantor certification (all principal guarantors)
- **Party consent to proceed to referendum** (per [SAZ Legal Framework Section 2.1-2.5](01-saz-legal-framework.md#21-establishment-options))
- Local referendum passes (thresholds per Legal Framework Section 2.6: 50% participation, 55% approval, 30% per-community)
- **Formal party agreement signed** (post-referendum; completes establishment per Legal Framework Section 2.2 Step 4)
- No disqualifying veto

#### 3.4 Appeal Procedures

**If Site Rejected:**
- Reasons documented
- Community may address concerns and reapply
- Appeal to Confederal Court on procedural grounds
- No appeal on substantive grounds (judgment call)

## Transition Implementation

Once an SAZ site is selected (decision sequence complete per Section 5.3) and all approvals obtained, the gap between "agreement signed" and "SAZ operational" is the most operationally dangerous transition moment. This section specifies the authority transfer mechanics.

### 1. Authority Transfer Sequence

Authority transfers in a defined sequence to maintain governance continuity:

| Phase | Duration | Key Actions |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Pre-transfer preparation** | 60-90 days | SAZ governance institutions formed; personnel appointed; legal framework enacted |
| **Administrative handover** | 30-60 days | Municipal functions transfer to SAZ governance; records, budgets, and contracts migrate |
| **Security transition** | 60-120 days | Phased transfer from existing security forces (IDF/PA) to SAZ security arrangements |
| **Full SAZ operation** | Ongoing | SAZ governance assumes all designated functions; enhanced monitoring for 12 months |

**Sequencing Principle:** Administrative functions transfer before security functions. Municipal services (water, electricity, waste, permits) must continue uninterrupted throughout the transition.

### 2. Security Transition

Security transition is the highest-risk element and follows a phased approach:

| Step | Action | Duration |
|------|--------|----------|
| 1 | SAZ security force trained and certified | Before transition begins |
| 2 | Joint patrols: SAZ security + existing forces (IDF/PA) operate together | 30-60 days |
| 3 | Lead transfer: SAZ security assumes primary responsibility; existing forces in support | 30-60 days |
| 4 | Full SAZ security authority: existing forces withdraw to perimeter | Target: 30 days |
| 5 | Perimeter withdrawal complete: SAZ security fully operational | Target: 30 days |

**IDF/PA Withdrawal:** The terms of military/security withdrawal are negotiated as part of the SAZ establishment agreement (party consent at Section 5.3 step 5). The framework specifies the phased approach; exact timelines and modalities are agreement-specific.

**Emergency Reversion:** If security conditions deteriorate during transition, the joint patrol phase may be extended or the transition paused. Transition pause does not constitute phase regression; it is an implementation adjustment.

### 3. Administrative Continuity

During the handover period:

- All pre-existing municipal services continue without interruption
- Existing municipal employees are offered transition to SAZ employment (at equivalent or better terms)
- Contracts with utility providers, service companies, and vendors are assumed by SAZ governance
- Property records, land registrations, and legal filings transfer to SAZ administrative systems
- Tax collection transitions to SAZ revenue authority on a defined date

### 4. Recalcitrant Officials

If local officials refuse to cooperate with the authority transfer:

| Scenario | Response |
|----------|----------|
| **Mayor/council refuses handover** | Guarantor mediation; if mediation fails, SAZ governance establishes parallel administrative capacity and existing services transfer as contracts expire or are assumed |
| **Civil servants refuse to transfer** | SAZ governance hires replacement staff; no individual penalized for declining SAZ employment |
| **Security forces refuse withdrawal** | Guarantor diplomatic intervention; escalation to guarantor enforcement mechanisms; SAZ security operates alongside until withdrawal achieved |
| **Population resistance** | Distinction between political opposition (protected) and violent obstruction (addressed per SAZ security protocols) |

### 5. Transition Monitoring

Enhanced monitoring during the transition period:

- JSVC maintains intensified presence during transition
- Guarantor observers stationed at SAZ boundaries and key administrative sites
- Weekly transition progress reports published
- Defined milestones for transition completion assessment
- CRC Review Panel available for urgent individual complaints via interim mechanism (see [Constitutional Floor Section 7.1](03-constitutional-floor.md#71-saz-establishment))

---

## Multiple SAZ Sequencing

### 1. Pilot First Approach

**First Internal SAZ:**
- Highest probability of success
- Reasonable demonstration potential
- Manageable size
- Intensive support

**Learning from Pilot:**
- 3-5 year operation before second SAZ
- Comprehensive assessment
- Model refinement
- Lessons documented

### 2. Expansion Criteria

**Second and Subsequent SAZs When:**
- First SAZ stable for 3+ years
- Positive lessons transferable
- Demand from additional communities
- Capacity to support expansion

**Expansion Not Automatic:**
- Each SAZ separately assessed
- Each requires local consent
- Each has own conditions

### 3. Coordination Requirements

**Multiple SAZs Coordinated:**
- Common legal framework
- Shared institutions where appropriate
- Resource sharing
- Personnel rotation
- Experience exchange

**But Also Independent:**
- Each SAZ governs itself
- No SAZ controls another
- Failure of one doesn't automatically affect others

### 4. Learning Integration

**Systematic Learning:**
- Each SAZ contributes to knowledge base
- Successes and failures analyzed
- Model updated based on experience
- New SAZs benefit from accumulated learning

---

## Boundary Modification

### 1. Modification Triggers

**Expansion:**
- Adjacent community petitions for inclusion
- Current SAZ demonstrates capacity
- Security conditions permit
- Economic integration beneficial

**Contraction:**
- Security deterioration in portion of SAZ
- Resident departure from area
- Governance capacity exceeded
- Phase regression applicable to portion

### 2. Modification Process

**Party Consent Requirement (per [SAZ Legal Framework Section 6.3](01-saz-legal-framework.md#63-boundary-modification)):**

All boundary modifications require party (Israeli and Palestinian authority) consent. MCF bodies may recommend modifications but cannot authorize them without the consent requirements below.

**Expansion:**

1. Petition from adjacent community (majority support)
2. Feasibility assessment
3. SAZ Council approval (supermajority)
4. **Party consent: Both parties must consent (non-objection after 90-day notice period satisfies this requirement)**
5. Guarantor certification
6. Local referendum in expansion area (same thresholds as establishment: 50% participation, 55% approval, 30% per-community minimum)
7. Integration plan implementation

**Contraction:**

1. Trigger conditions documented
2. Assessment by JSVC and guarantors
3. **Party consent: Both parties must consent**
4. Notification to affected residents
5. Local referendum in contraction area (50% participation, simple majority approval)
6. Transition period (minimum 90 days)
7. Orderly withdrawal of SAZ jurisdiction
8. Status of area clarified (return to prior status or other)

**Technical Adjustment Exception:** Minor corrections (<1% territory change) for survey errors or infrastructure access require party consent but no referendum.

### 3. Resident Protection During Modification

**Expansion:**
- New residents have same rights as original
- No discrimination based on entry timing
- Transition assistance for integration

**Contraction:**
- Affected residents may relocate to continuing SAZ
- Relocation assistance provided
- Property rights protected
- No abandonment without transition plan

### 4. Shrinkage vs. Expansion

**Bias Toward Stability:**
- Neither expansion nor contraction is favored
- Each assessed on merits
- Stability valued over growth
- Contraction is not failure (may be prudent risk management)

**Contraction as Feature:**
- SAZ can shrink to survive
- Better to contract than collapse
- Institutional continuity preserved in core
- Expansion possible after stabilization
