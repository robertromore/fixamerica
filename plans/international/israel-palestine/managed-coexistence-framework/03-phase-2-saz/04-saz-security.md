# SAZ Security Model

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#phase-2-years-2050-special-administrative-zone-saz-pilot)

**Phase:** Phase 2 onwards

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## Purpose

The SAZ Security Model establishes how **security is maintained within Special Administrative Zones** without national military forces or armed factions.

Security is the make-or-break dimension for SAZ viability. Residents of both communities must feel safe—not just from external threats but from each other and from the security forces themselves. The model must thread the needle between effective protection and the risks of re-militarization.

---

## Security Philosophy

### 1. Demilitarization as Foundation

SAZs are demilitarized zones. This is not aspirational—it is constitutive. No SAZ can exist with military forces present. Demilitarization is the price of admission for the special governance arrangements that SAZs provide.

**Rationale:**
- Military presence enables coercion, undermining voluntary participation
- Military allegiance to national authorities conflicts with SAZ autonomy
- Military capability enables rapid escalation
- Demilitarization signals that SAZs are spaces of civilian life, not contestation

**Demilitarization is Permanent:**

- Not a transitional arrangement
- Not subject to renegotiation
- Major violations trigger phase regression per compliance ladder (see Section 1.4)
- Dissolution is reserved for extreme cases where regression is insufficient (see Section 1.4 Dissolution Criteria)

### 2. Police Primacy

Within SAZs, the only armed public force is the integrated police. Police serve the SAZ community—not national governments, not external powers. They enforce laws democratically enacted by SAZ residents.

**Police Are Not Military Substitutes:**
- Different training, equipment, doctrine
- Focused on crime prevention and community safety
- Accountable to civilian oversight
- No military chain of command

### 3. External Guarantees for External Threats

SAZs cannot defend themselves against military attack. This is by design. Defense against external military threats is provided by guarantor commitments—credible international pledges to respond to aggression.

**This Division is Essential:**
- SAZ handles internal security (police)
- Guarantors handle external security (deterrence, rapid response)
- No internal buildup of military capability

### 4. Graduated Response

Security responses scale with threats. Minor incidents are police matters. Serious threats trigger escalation protocols. External attacks invoke guarantor response. The goal is proportionality—not under-response that fails to protect, not over-response that escalates.

---

## Demilitarization

### 1. Demilitarization Standards

#### 1.1 Prohibited Weapons

The following are prohibited within SAZ territory:

| Category | Examples | Exceptions |
|----------|----------|------------|
| Military firearms | Assault rifles, machine guns, sniper rifles | None |
| Explosives | Grenades, bombs, IEDs, explosive material | Licensed demolition (construction) |
| Heavy weapons | Artillery, mortars, rockets, missiles | None |
| Armored vehicles | Tanks, APCs, armored cars | None |
| Military aircraft | Fighter jets, attack helicopters, armed drones | None |
| Anti-aircraft weapons | SAMs, anti-aircraft guns | None |

**Police Weapons Permitted:**
- Handguns (specified calibers)
- Non-lethal weapons (tasers, pepper spray, rubber bullets with restrictions)
- Shotguns (limited numbers, special authorization)

#### 1.2 Prohibited Forces

No military or paramilitary forces may be present within SAZ:

**Explicitly Prohibited:**
- National military forces (Israeli, Palestinian)
- Armed factions (Hamas, Islamic Jihad, settler militias, etc.)
- Private military contractors
- Armed political party militias
- Vigilante groups

**Exception for Transit:**
- Guarantor forces may transit SAZ in emergency with notification
- Transit does not include stationing, basing, or routine operations within SAZ

**Exception for Emergency Response:**

- Guarantor rapid-response operations within SAZ are permitted under activation procedures (see Section "External Rapid Response")
- Operational deployments are time-limited (see Section 3.1 Duration Limits)
- This exception does not create permanent guarantor presence; forces withdraw when threat is neutralized

#### 1.3 Verification Mechanisms

**Permanent Monitoring:**
- JSVC inspectors stationed in SAZ
- Continuous monitoring of entry points
- Regular sweeps for prohibited weapons
- Technical surveillance of borders

**Random Inspections:**
- Unannounced inspections of any location
- No prior notice required
- Full cooperation required from all parties
- Obstruction treated as violation

**Community Reporting:**
- Secure channels for reporting violations
- Protection for informants
- Rapid response to credible reports
- Rewards for actionable intelligence

#### 1.4 Compliance Monitoring

**Compliance Status:**
- Green: Full compliance, no violations
- Yellow: Minor violations, corrective action underway
- Orange: Significant violations, enhanced monitoring
- Red: Major violations, phase regression triggered

**Reporting:**

- Monthly compliance reports to Confederal Council
- Immediate reporting of significant violations
- Quarterly public reports
- Annual comprehensive assessment

**Dissolution Criteria:**

Dissolution (termination of SAZ status) is distinct from phase regression and applies only when:

| Criterion | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Sustained red status** | Red compliance status for 6+ consecutive months without improvement |
| **Repeated regression** | Third phase regression within 5 years |
| **Fundamental breach** | Military force seizure of SAZ territory, systematic ethnic cleansing, or collapse of civilian governance |
| **Guarantor determination** | Guarantor Forum unanimously determines SAZ is no longer viable |

Dissolution requires Confederal Council supermajority (2/3) plus Guarantor Forum concurrence. Dissolution triggers orderly termination procedures per [SAZ Legal Framework Section 8](01-saz-legal-framework.md#8-termination-and-transition).

### 2. Transition to Demilitarization

#### 2.1 Pre-SAZ Security Transition

Before SAZ establishment, the designated territory must be demilitarized:

**Phase 1: Force Withdrawal (Days 1-30)**
- All military forces withdraw
- Armed faction members leave or disarm
- Settler security removed
- Palestinian security forces transition to civilian status or depart

**Phase 2: Weapon Collection (Days 31-60)**
- Organized weapon turn-in points
- Amnesty for voluntary surrender
- Active collection from non-compliant holders
- Verification of collection completeness

**Phase 3: Verification (Days 61-90)**
- Comprehensive sweeps
- Technical verification (sensors, inspections)
- Certification by JSVC
- Guarantor confirmation

#### 2.2 Withdrawal Protocols

**Israeli Forces:**
- Phased withdrawal on published schedule
- Handover to interim guarantor presence
- No "security zone" retention
- Equipment removal, not destruction in place

**Palestinian Security Forces:**

- Option to integrate into SAZ police (with enhanced vetting—see Transition Integration Exception below)
- Option to redeploy outside SAZ
- Disarmament of those remaining as civilians
- No parallel security structures

**Transition Integration Exception:** Palestinian security personnel who integrate into SAZ police during the initial transition period (Section 2.1) are exempt from the 5-year cooling-off period that otherwise applies to national military/security recruitment (Section 1.1 Recruitment Sources). This exception requires: (a) integration occurs during the 90-day transition window, (b) enhanced vetting including human rights record review, (c) completion of full SAZ police academy training, and (d) JSVC certification. After the transition window closes, the standard 5-year cooling-off applies to all subsequent recruitment.

**Armed Factions:**
- Disarmament mandatory
- No faction presence in SAZ
- Former members may reside if disarmed and vetted
- Monitoring for reconstitution

#### 2.3 Timeline and Sequencing

**Standard Timeline: 90 days from SAZ designation to certification**

| Day | Milestone |
|-----|-----------|
| 0 | SAZ establishment announced |
| 1-30 | Force withdrawal complete |
| 31-60 | Weapon collection complete |
| 61-90 | Verification and certification |
| 91+ | SAZ governance activation |

**Acceleration:** If conditions permit, may be compressed to 60 days.

**Extension:** If verification incomplete, may be extended in 30-day increments up to 180 days total. Beyond that, SAZ establishment fails.

- Communications blackout combined with violence indicators
- Credible intelligence of imminent major attack

**Threshold for Automatic Activation:**
- JSVC or guarantor intelligence confirms threat
- Response is defensive and limited
- Expanded operations require SAZ authorization

#### 2.3 Communication Protocols

**Immediate Notification:**
- SAZ authorities notified before or simultaneously with deployment
- Confederal Council notified
- National governments notified (but not for approval)
- Public notification within 2 hours

**Coordination:**
- SAZ police informed and coordinated

## Paramilitary Prevention

### 1. Intelligence and Monitoring

**Threat Assessment:**
- Continuous monitoring for paramilitary organizing
- Information from community sources
- Open-source intelligence
- Coordination with JSVC

**Indicators:**
- Weapons stockpiling
- Military-style training
- Recruitment for armed groups
- Faction organizing
- External support for armed activity

**Intelligence Limitations:**
- Focused on paramilitary activity only
- Not general political surveillance
- Subject to oversight
- Strict data handling

### 2. Entry Controls

**Entry Points:**
- All SAZ entries controlled
- Identity verification
- Weapons screening
- Vehicle inspection

**Prohibited Entry:**
- Known paramilitary members
- Persons on violence watch lists
- Persons carrying weapons (exceptions for SAZ police)
- Persons with unexplained large sums (potential facilitation)

**Entry Process:**
- Not onerous for legitimate entrants
- Efficient processing (target: <5 minutes for routine)
- Special lanes for residents
- Appeals process for denied entry

### 3. Internal Surveillance Limits

**What Is Permitted:**
- Public space observation (cameras, patrols)
- Monitoring of persons under investigation (with warrant)
- Monitoring of public communications channels

**What Is Prohibited:**
- Mass surveillance of private communications
- Infiltration of legitimate political organizations
- Surveillance based on ethnicity or religion
- Collection of data on lawful political activity

### 4. Response Protocols

**If Paramilitary Activity Detected:**

| Stage | Response |
|-------|----------|
| Early indicators | Enhanced monitoring, community outreach |
| Confirmed organizing | Investigation, disruption of networks |
| Weapons discovered | Seizure, arrests, prosecution |
| Armed presence | Police response, guarantor alert |
| Active paramilitary operation | Guarantor intervention |

**Legal Consequences:**

- Paramilitary organizing is criminal offense
- Significant penalties (5-15 years imprisonment)
- Forfeiture of assets
- Deportation from SAZ (for non-residents)

**Forum:** Because the maximum penalty exceeds 10 years, paramilitary organizing offenses are tried in national courts per [SAZ Legal Framework Section 7.1](01-saz-legal-framework.md#71-saz-to-national-relationship). SAZ police investigate and refer; national courts prosecute. SAZ courts retain jurisdiction for lesser facilitation offenses (e.g., failure to report, minor material support) where maximum penalty is ≤10 years.
