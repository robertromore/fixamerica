# External SAZ as Surrogate Pilot

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#external-special-administrative-zone-saz-as-a-surrogate-pilot)

**Phase:** Phase 1-2 transition

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## Purpose

The External SAZ concept allows **testing SAZ mechanisms in a third country** before attempting internal SAZs in contested territory. This reduces risk and builds institutional capacity.

An External SAZ provides a laboratory for developing and refining SAZ governance, testing whether Israelis and Palestinians can build shared institutions, and creating a cadre of experienced administrators—all without the existential stakes of operating in the contested territory itself.

---

## External SAZ Concept

### 1. Purpose and Rationale

**Why Test Externally First:**

The stakes of failure inside contested territory are extreme. A failed internal SAZ could:
- Produce casualties and deepen trauma
- Discredit the entire MCF project
- Strengthen extremist narratives
- Close the window for peaceful coexistence for a generation

An external SAZ reduces these risks while providing genuine proof of concept.

**What External SAZ Demonstrates:**
- Can Israeli and Palestinian civilians share governance?
- Can integrated police forces function?
- Can SAZ legal frameworks operate?
- Can intercommunal disputes be resolved peacefully?
- Can guarantor oversight work in practice?

### 2. Surrogate Pilot Theory

**The External SAZ is a surrogate, not a substitute:**

- It tests mechanisms that can then be applied internally
- It builds institutional capacity that transfers
- It creates precedents and templates
- It demonstrates to skeptics that coexistence is possible

**What It Cannot Test:**
- Reactions of residents who did not choose to participate
- Dynamics of operating in historically contested space
- Pressure from proximate national forces
- Management of disputed holy sites

The external SAZ prepares MCF for internal SAZs but does not replace the need to eventually operate in contested territory.

### 3. Risk Reduction Logic

**Risks Reduced:**

| Risk | How External SAZ Reduces It |
|------|----------------------------|
| Violence | Located away from conflict zone |
| Spoiler interference | Host country provides security buffer |
| Political pressure | Less scrutiny than in contested territory |
| Failure consequences | Failure doesn't foreclose internal options |
| Learning curve | Mistakes made in low-stakes environment |

**Risks Not Reduced:**
- Diaspora political tensions
- External political attacks on MCF
- Funding sustainability
- Institutional capacity limits

### 4. Institutional Capacity Building

**External SAZ builds:**

- Trained SAZ administrators
- Experienced integrated police officers
- Judicial expertise in SAZ law
- Community mediation professionals
- Model legislation and regulations
- Operational procedures (tested and refined)

This human and institutional capital then deploys to internal SAZs.

## Location Criteria

### 1. Host Country Requirements

**Essential Characteristics:**

| Requirement | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------|
| Political stability | SAZ needs stable operating environment |
| Rule of law | Legal agreements must be enforceable |
| Security capacity | Host can protect SAZ from external threats |
| Neutral stance | Not aligned with either party to conflict |

**Size:**
- Territory sufficient for meaningful SAZ (minimum ~10 km²)
- Expansion potential if pilot succeeds

### 3. Political Feasibility

**Host Country Must Accept:**
- Hosting experiment on its territory
- Limited sovereignty transfer (SAZ autonomy)
- Potential political criticism
- Long-term commitment (15-30 years)

**Compensation:**

- More experimental flexibility

### 2. Host Country Interface

**Liaison Mechanisms:**
- Host Country Liaison Office in SAZ
- SAZ Representative in host capital
- Regular coordination meetings
- Joint committees on security, infrastructure, etc.

**Issue Resolution:**

- Escalation to host government - MCF level
- Ultimate arbitration by guarantors

### 3. External Oversight

**Enhanced Oversight for Pilot:**
- More intensive guarantor monitoring
- Frequent assessments
- Active mentorship
- Rapid course correction

**Documentation:**
