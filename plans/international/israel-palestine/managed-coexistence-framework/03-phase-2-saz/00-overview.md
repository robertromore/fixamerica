# Phase 2 Special Administrative Zones: Overview

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#phase-2-years-2050-special-administrative-zone-saz-pilot)

**Phase Duration:** Years 20-50

**Objective:** Test mixed civic governance on defined territory without permanent sovereignty transfer.

---

## Purpose of This Section

This directory contains detailed implementation documents for the Special Administrative Zone (SAZ) system. Phase 2 represents the first **territorial component** of MCF—bounded geographic areas where mixed governance can be piloted under controlled conditions.

SAZs are explicitly **experimental and reversible**. They do not resolve sovereignty disputes; they create contained spaces where coexistence can be demonstrated at scale.

## Transition to Phase 3

SAZ pilots remain operational throughout Phase 3 and beyond. The transition to Phase 3 (Voluntary Convergence) requires sustained SAZ success and expressed demand for broader political integration options.
