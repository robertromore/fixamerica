# SAZ Constitutional Floor

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#phase-2-years-2050-special-administrative-zone-saz-pilot)

**Phase:** Phase 2 onwards

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## Purpose

The Constitutional Floor establishes how the **Confederal Rights Compact (CRC)** operates within Special Administrative Zones. While the CRC defines the rights themselves, this document specifies the **territorial supremacy doctrine** that makes CRC protections enforceable as the highest law within SAZ boundaries.

The CRC is fully defined in [02-confederal-rights-compact.md](../02-phase-1-civic-membership/02-confederal-rights-compact.md). This document should be read in conjunction with that charter.

---

## Core Principle: Territorial Supremacy

Within SAZ boundaries, the CRC operates as a **constitutional floor**—the minimum set of rights that no governing authority may reduce. This represents a shift from Phase 0-1, where CRC rights attached to individuals through program participation, to Phase 2, where they attach to **presence within territory**.

The floor is not a ceiling. SAZ governance may provide additional rights beyond the CRC minimum, but may never provide fewer.

---

## 1. Supremacy Doctrine

### 1.1 CRC Over Local Law

Within SAZ territory:

- CRC provisions supersede any conflicting local ordinance, regulation, or policy
- SAZ governance may not enact rules that reduce CRC protections
- Pre-existing local law continues to apply only where it does not conflict with CRC

### 1.2 Supremacy Does Not Mean Exclusivity

CRC supremacy does **not** mean:

- National law ceases to apply (it continues where non-conflicting)
- SAZ governance has no authority (it retains substantial policy discretion)
- International law is displaced (CRC operates alongside, not above)

CRC supremacy means only that **where conflict exists, CRC prevails**.

### 1.3 Conflict Identification

A conflict exists when:

- Local rule would deny a CRC-protected right
- Local rule would impose a burden CRC prohibits
- Local rule would limit a right more severely than CRC permits
- Local enforcement would violate CRC procedural requirements

Conflicts are identified through:

- CRC Review Panel advisory opinions
- Individual complaints and adjudication
- SAZ judicial review
- Guarantor monitoring

---

## 2. Rights Floor in Practice

### 2.1 Universal Application

Within SAZ boundaries, CRC rights apply to **all persons present**, regardless of:

- CMS status (holders and non-holders alike)
- Citizenship or nationality
- Residency duration (visitors and residents alike)
- Reason for presence (work, residence, transit)

This universality is essential to SAZ legitimacy. A zone where some inhabitants have rights and others do not cannot function as a civilian governance pilot.

### 2.2 Enhanced Application vs. Phase 1

| Aspect | Phase 1 Application | Phase 2 SAZ Application |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Who** | CMS holders and MCF program participants | All persons within SAZ boundaries |
| **Where** | Within MCF institutions and programs | Throughout SAZ territory |
| **Enforcement** | MCF institutional mechanisms | SAZ judicial system + MCF oversight |
| **Local law** | Continues to apply | Subordinate to CRC where conflicting |

### 2.3 Floor vs. Ceiling Distinction

**Floor rights** (CRC minimum):

- Cannot be reduced by SAZ governance
- Apply uniformly across all SAZs
- Enforceable through CRC Review Panel

**Ceiling rights** (SAZ discretion):

- May exceed CRC minimum
- May vary between SAZs
- Enforceable through SAZ judicial mechanisms

**Example**: CRC guarantees access to emergency healthcare. An SAZ may provide universal primary care (exceeding the floor) but may not restrict emergency access to certain populations (violating the floor).

## 3. Local Law Displacement

### 3.1 What Gets Displaced

Local law is displaced when it would:

- Permit conduct CRC prohibits (e.g., collective punishment)
- Prohibit conduct CRC protects (e.g., political expression)
- Impose procedures CRC forbids (e.g., detention without review)
- Discriminate where CRC requires equality

### 3.2 What Does NOT Get Displaced

Local law continues to apply where it:

- Addresses matters CRC does not cover
- Provides greater protection than CRC minimum
- Regulates conduct CRC leaves to local discretion
- Does not conflict with CRC procedures

### 3.3 Displacement Procedure

When conflict is identified:

1. CRC Review Panel or SAZ court issues conflict finding
2. Conflicting local provision is suspended within SAZ
3. SAZ governance may revise provision to eliminate conflict
4. Revised provision reviewed for CRC compliance
5. If compliant, provision may be reinstated

Displacement is **remedy for conflict**, not punishment. The goal is CRC compliance, not local law elimination.

---

## 4. Enforcement Within SAZ

### 4.1 SAZ Judicial Authority

SAZ judicial mechanisms have **primary jurisdiction** over CRC enforcement within SAZ territory:

- Hear individual complaints
- Review local law for CRC compliance
- Issue injunctive and declaratory relief
- Order compensation from SAZ funds

SAZ courts must be:

- Independent of SAZ executive authority
- Staffed by judges meeting MCF qualification standards
- Subject to MCF appellate review
- Transparent in proceedings and decisions

### 4.2 MCF Oversight

MCF retains oversight authority over SAZ constitutional floor enforcement:

**CRC Review Panel**:

- Hears appeals from SAZ judicial decisions
- Issues advisory opinions on CRC interpretation
- Reviews systemic compliance through audits
- Refers violations to guarantors

**Guarantor intervention**:

- Triggered by persistent or systemic violations
- May suspend SAZ privileges or authorities
- May require governance restructuring
- May initiate phase regression review

### 4.3 Individual Remedies

Individuals may seek CRC enforcement through:

1. SAZ judicial complaint (primary forum)
2. CRC Review Panel appeal (for SAZ judicial failures)
3. Direct Panel petition (for systemic issues)
4. Guarantor notification (for severe violations)

Standing requires only presence within SAZ; no CMS or organizational affiliation needed.

## 5. Relationship to SAZ Governance

### 5.1 Governance Authority Preserved

SAZ governance retains substantial authority within CRC constraints:

- Taxation and revenue allocation
- Public services provision
- Land use and zoning (subject to property rights)
- Local elections and representation
- Cultural and educational programs
- Economic development
- Environmental regulation

The constitutional floor limits **how** governance operates, not **whether** it operates.

### 5.2 Governance Accountability

SAZ authorities are accountable for CRC compliance through:

- Judicial review of actions
- Regular CRC compliance audits
- Public reporting requirements
- Electoral accountability to residents
- Guarantor oversight

### 5.3 Police and Security Constraints

SAZ security forces operate under CRC constraints:

- Use of force limitations
- Detention procedural requirements
- Due process in all enforcement
- Non-discrimination in application
- Accountability for violations

Security force conduct is subject to heightened scrutiny given CRC's origin in conflict management.

## 6. Amendment and Evolution

### 6.1 Floor Expansion Within SAZ

An SAZ may expand rights beyond the CRC floor:

- Through SAZ legislative action
- Subject to SAZ judicial review
- Without requiring MCF-wide adoption

SAZ-specific expansions:

- Apply only within that SAZ
- May serve as pilots for MCF-wide adoption
- Must be clearly distinguished from CRC floor

### 6.2 SAZ Cannot Reduce Floor

An SAZ may **never** reduce the CRC floor:

- No SAZ legislation or referendum can override CRC
- No emergency within SAZ suspends non-derogable rights
- No SAZ governance restructuring eliminates CRC application

Floor reduction requires MCF-wide CRC amendment (see CRC Section 10.2).

### 6.3 Learning Across SAZs

Multiple SAZs may develop different approaches to rights beyond the floor:

- Variation provides learning opportunities
- Successful expansions may be adopted MCF-wide
- Failed experiments inform future design
- CRC Review Panel documents and analyzes variation

## 7. Transition Scenarios

### 7.1 SAZ Establishment

When an SAZ is established:

1. CRC immediately applies to all territory
2. Existing local law reviewed for CRC compliance
3. Conflicting provisions suspended pending revision
4. SAZ judicial mechanisms established
5. CRC Review Panel oversight activated

Transition period (maximum 12 months) allows governance adaptation, but CRC rights apply from day one.

### 7.2 SAZ Termination

If an SAZ terminates:

- CRC territorial application ends
- CMS holders retain personal CRC application
- Claims for violations during SAZ operation remain valid
- Records preserved for accountability

Termination does not provide immunity for past violations.

### 7.3 Phase Regression

If MCF regresses from Phase 2 to Phase 1:

- SAZ territorial application suspends
- Personal CRC application continues for CMS holders
- SAZ judicial mechanisms wind down
- CRC Review Panel retains appellate jurisdiction for pending cases

Regression is procedural, not punitive. Rights violations during regression are still actionable.

## 8. Relationship to National Constitutional Law

### 8.1 Parallel Operation

CRC operates **parallel to** national constitutional law, not in replacement of it:

- Israeli Basic Laws continue to apply to Israeli citizens within SAZ
- Palestinian constitutional provisions continue where applicable
- International human rights obligations remain in force

CRC adds a layer; it does not subtract existing protections.

### 8.2 Conflict Resolution

When CRC and national constitutional provisions conflict:

- **More protective standard applies** (favor individual rights)
- CRC does not reduce rights national law provides
- National law does not reduce rights CRC provides
- Apparent conflicts reviewed by CRC Review Panel and national courts

### 8.3 Non-Prejudice to National Claims

CRC application within SAZ does **not**:

- Concede Israeli or Palestinian sovereignty claims
- Create precedent for final-status arrangements
- Prejudge constitutional status of territory
- Recognize or deny any political authority

SAZ constitutional floor is a **governance arrangement**, not a sovereignty determination.
