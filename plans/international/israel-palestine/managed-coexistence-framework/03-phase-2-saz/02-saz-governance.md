# SAZ Governance Structure

**Parent Document:** [00-introduction.md](../00-introduction.md#phase-2-years-2050-special-administrative-zone-saz-pilot)

**Phase:** Phase 2 onwards

**Status:** Final Draft

---

## Purpose

The SAZ Governance Structure defines how **Special Administrative Zones are governed internally**—their legislative, executive, and judicial arrangements.

SAZ governance must balance democratic legitimacy with community protection, local autonomy with external accountability, and effective administration with power limitation. The design draws on power-sharing models from Northern Ireland, Bosnia, and Lebanon while avoiding their documented failure modes.

---

## Core Governance Principles

### 1. Democratic Legitimacy

All governing authority derives from the consent of SAZ residents, expressed through regular, free, and fair elections. No external power can impose governance arrangements that lack resident support.

**Implementation:**
- Universal adult suffrage for all SAZ residents
- Regular election cycles with guaranteed scheduling
- Independent electoral administration
- International monitoring of all elections
- Recall mechanisms for failed officials

### 2. Dual Community Representation

SAZ governance must ensure both Israeli-origin and Palestinian-origin communities have meaningful representation regardless of demographic proportions. Neither community can dominate the other through simple majoritarianism.

**Mechanisms:**
- Guaranteed minimum representation in all governing bodies
- Community-specific veto powers on identity-sensitive matters
- Proportional allocation of executive positions
- Rotating leadership where appropriate
- Consensus requirements for fundamental decisions

### 3. Power Limitation

No individual, faction, or community can accumulate unchecked power. All authority is subject to constitutional limits, judicial review, and external oversight.

**Structural Safeguards:**
- Separation of powers across branches
- Term limits for all elected positions
- Independent anti-corruption institutions
- Guarantor oversight of governance quality
- Constitutional floor that cannot be amended away

### 4. External Accountability

SAZ self-governance operates within MCF framework constraints. External oversight prevents capture by local majorities and ensures adherence to confederal standards.

**Accountability Layers:**
- MCF institutional oversight
- Guarantor governance monitoring
- International observer access
- Resident appeal rights to external bodies
- Periodic external governance audits

## Legislative Branch

### 1. SAZ Council: Composition

The SAZ Council serves as the primary legislative body for each Special Administrative Zone.

#### 1.1 Size and Structure

**Standard Model (Population 10,000-50,000):**

| Component | Seats | Selection Method |
|-----------|-------|------------------|
| Directly Elected | 21 | Single Transferable Vote (STV) |
| Community Guarantee | (reserved within 21) | 3 Israeli-origin, 3 Palestinian-origin minimum |
| **Total** | 21 | Fixed |

**Large SAZ Model (Population 50,000+):**

| Component | Seats | Selection Method |
|-----------|-------|------------------|
| Directly Elected | 35 | Single Transferable Vote (STV) |
| Community Guarantee | (reserved within 35) | 5 per community minimum |
| **Total** | 35 | Fixed |

**Seat Allocation Logic (STV with Community Guarantees):**

1. All seats are elected via STV in multi-member constituencies
2. STV's proportional outcomes typically achieve community balance naturally
3. **Community guarantee check:** After STV results, if either community has fewer than the guaranteed minimum seats, the following adjustment applies:
   - The lowest-vote-share winner from the over-represented community is replaced by the highest-vote-share non-winner from the under-represented community
   - Adjustment continues until community minimums are met
   - Maximum adjustment: 2 seats per election (to preserve voter choice)
4. If adjustment cannot achieve minimums, the shortfall triggers the Community Minimum Shortfall Protocol (below)

**Community Minimum Shortfall Protocol:**

If the 2-seat adjustment cap cannot achieve community minimums:

| Shortfall | Remedy |
|-----------|--------|
| 1 seat | Council proceeds; shortfall community receives guaranteed committee chair and enhanced veto rights until next election |
| 2+ seats | Electoral commission must (a) certify results valid despite shortfall, or (b) order new election with modified constituency boundaries designed to improve community representation |

**Certification Criteria:** Electoral commission may certify results despite shortfall only if:

- The under-represented community had candidates on ballot in all constituencies
- No evidence of voter suppression or intimidation affecting community participation
- Shortfall reflects genuine demographic distribution, not systemic exclusion

If certification is denied, new election within 90 days with boundary modifications.

**Rationale:** This approach uses a single coherent electoral system (STV) while preserving community guarantees within fixed seat totals. Unlike additive guarantee seats, this maintains predictable council size and clear accountability.

#### 1.2 Electoral System

**Voting Method:**

- Single Transferable Vote (STV) in multi-member constituencies
- Constituency structure varies by SAZ size:

| SAZ Model | Constituencies | Seats per Constituency | Total Seats |
|-----------|----------------|------------------------|-------------|
| Standard (10,000-50,000) | 3-5 | 4-7 | 21 |
| Large (50,000+) | 5-7 | 5-7 | 35 |

**Rationale for STV:**
- Proportional outcomes without pure party list control
- Voters choose individual candidates, not just parties
- Moderate candidates can attract cross-community transfers
- Reduces wasted votes

**Voting Eligibility:**
- All SAZ residents aged 18+ who have resided in SAZ for 6+ months
- No citizenship requirement—residence determines eligibility
- CMS status not required; residency is the sole criterion

**Non-Resident CMS Holders:**

Non-resident CMS holders do **not** have SAZ voting rights. Rationale: SAZ governing authority derives from SAZ residents (Section 1, Core Principles). Allowing non-resident voting would undermine local legitimacy and create accountability gaps where voters face no consequences of their votes. Non-resident CMS holders retain:

- Observer access to SAZ Council sessions
- Right to participate in public consultations
- Access to SAZ commercial and employment opportunities
- Standing to bring complaints through MCF dispute mechanisms

**Electoral Calendar:**
- Regular elections every 4 years
- By-elections within 60 days of vacancy
- Election dates fixed by constitutional calendar, not government decision

#### 1.3 Term Lengths and Limits

| Position | Term | Limit |
|----------|------|-------|
| Council Member | 4 years | 3 consecutive terms |
| Council Chair | 2 years | 2 terms total (see rotation note) |
| Committee Chair | 2 years | 2 consecutive terms |

**Council Chair Rotation and Term Limits:**

The Council Chair rotates between communities every 2-year term:

- Term 1: Israeli-origin community member
- Term 2: Palestinian-origin community member
- Term 3: Israeli-origin community member (etc.)

Because rotation is mandatory, the same individual cannot serve consecutive terms. The "2 terms total" limit means an individual can serve as Chair twice during their Council career, but only when their community's rotation comes around (minimum 4-year gap between Chair terms for the same person).

**Gap Requirement:** After reaching a *consecutive* term limit for any position, individual must wait one full term before re-seeking that position. This gap requirement does not apply to *total* term limits (e.g., Council Chair's 2 terms total), which are absolute caps that cannot be circumvented by waiting.

#### 1.4 Eligibility Requirements

**To Serve as Council Member:**
- SAZ resident for 12+ months at time of candidacy
- Aged 21 or older
- No criminal conviction for corruption, violence, or political intimidation within past 10 years
- No current employment by national government security services
- No active membership in organizations designated as paramilitary

- Conviction for corruption or abuse of office while serving
- Documented incitement to intercommunal violence
- Acceptance of foreign government payments beyond disclosed campaign contributions

- Full Council confirms both by simple majority
- If either rejected, nomination process restarts

**Term:**
- 4 years, concurrent with Council term
- May be re-elected once
- Removal only by 2/3 Council supermajority including majority of both communities

#### 1.2 Administrative Departments

| Department | Primary Functions |
|------------|-------------------|
| Public Services | Water, utilities, waste, parks |
| Planning & Development | Land use, construction, infrastructure |
| Education | Schools administration, curriculum |
| Health & Social Services | Clinics, social welfare, public health |
| Finance & Administration | Budget, personnel, procurement |
| Community Relations | Intercommunal programs, mediation |
| Public Safety | Police oversight, emergency services |
| Economic Development | Business support, employment, tourism |

**Department Heads:**
- Appointed by Co-Mayors, confirmed by Council
- Professional qualifications required
- Term: 4 years, renewable
- May be dismissed by Co-Mayors with Council approval
- Community balance in appointments required

#### 1.3 Civil Service

**Structure:**
- Professional, non-political civil service
- Recruitment by competitive examination
- Promotion based on performance
- Protection from political dismissal

**Community Balance:**

- Civil service should reflect SAZ demographic composition over time, subject to the 65% cap below
- Affirmative recruitment where underrepresentation exists
- No department more than 65% from single community at professional level (this cap takes precedence over demographic mirroring in SAZs where one community exceeds 65% of population)
- Balance targets achieved through attrition and new hiring, not displacement

**Demographic Skew Exception:** In SAZs where one community constitutes more than 65% of the population, the 65% cap overrides strict demographic mirroring. The civil service should approach—but not exceed—65% from the majority community, with the minority community comprising at least 35% at the professional level. This ensures neither community is excluded from governance regardless of local demographics.

**Independence:**
- Civil Service Commission oversees personnel
- Commission appointed jointly by Co-Mayors and Council
- Appeals to Commission for personnel disputes
- Whistleblower protection for civil servants

### 2. Executive Powers

#### 2.1 Implementation Authority

Co-Mayors jointly exercise:
- Implementation of Council legislation
- Day-to-day administration
- Emergency response coordination
- External representation (to MCF bodies, guarantors, other SAZs)
- Proposal of legislation and budget to Council

**Solo Authority (within assigned portfolio):**
- Routine administrative decisions
- Staff supervision
- Public communications
- Minor expenditure within budget

**Joint Decision Required:**
- All policy decisions
- Major appointments
- Emergency declarations
- External agreements
- Budget proposals
- Legislation proposals

#### 2.2 Emergency Powers

**Scope:**
- Temporary measures to address imminent threats to public safety
- Duration: Maximum 72 hours without Council approval
- Extension: Council may extend in 7-day increments by supermajority
- Maximum total duration: 30 days

**Limitations:**
- Cannot suspend Constitutional Floor protections
- Cannot limit freedom of expression or assembly beyond narrow security necessity
- Cannot arrest or detain without judicial authorization
- Cannot modify electoral calendar or cancel elections

**Oversight:**
- Immediate notification to Council and guarantors
- Judicial review available immediately
- Detailed reporting within 24 hours
- Post-emergency review mandatory

#### 2.3 Appointment Powers

Co-Mayors appoint, with Council confirmation:

- Department Heads (except Chief of Police—see below)
- Members of independent commissions
- Representatives to MCF bodies
- Senior administrative positions

**Chief of Police Exception:** The Chief of Police is appointed by the Judicial Appointments Committee (Section 1.3 of Integrated Police Force), not by Co-Mayors. This exception insulates police leadership from executive political pressure and aligns police command with the independence framework applied to the judiciary. Deputy Chiefs are appointed by the Chief with Co-Mayor approval (Section 1.3), providing executive input without direct control over the Chief position.

Unconfirmed appointments:
- Expire after 60 days
- May not be resubmitted for 6 months
- Acting arrangements limited to 90 days

| Stage | Forum | Scope |
|-------|-------|-------|
| 1. SAZ internal | SAZ Appeals Court | All appeals from SAZ Local Court |
| 2. CRC Review Panel | MCF body | CRC interpretation; primary forum for fundamental rights claims |
| 3. Confederal Court | MCF body | Constitutional Floor interpretation; confederal law; only after CRC Review Panel exhaustion |
| 4. National court | Party courts | Limited grounds only (see below) |

**National Court Appellate Grounds (per [SAZ Legal Framework Section 7.5](01-saz-legal-framework.md#75-appellate-review-of-saz-court-decisions)):**

| Ground | Scope | Standard | Exhaustion |
|--------|-------|----------|------------|
| **Constitutional violation** | SAZ decision violates party constitutional rights | De novo | None |
| **CRC violation with constitutional overlay** | CRC breach also implicates national constitutional rights | Manifest error | CRC Review Panel required |
| **Jurisdictional overreach** | SAZ court exceeded its jurisdiction | De novo | None |
| **Procedural irregularity** | Severe due process violation | Clear error | SAZ appellate required |
| **Res judicata conflict** | SAZ decision conflicts with prior national judgment | Review for conflict | None |

**Confederal Court Direct Appeals:**

SAZ Appeals Court decisions may be appealed directly to Confederal Court (bypassing CRC Review Panel) only on:

- Constitutional Floor interpretation (not CRC rights)
- Confederal law interpretation
- Inter-SAZ disputes

**Referral:**

### 3. Jurisdiction and Choice of Law

#### 3.1 Subject Matter Jurisdiction

**Civil Matters:**

- Contract disputes (SAZ-based transactions)
- Property disputes (SAZ-located property)
- Tort claims (SAZ-occurring events)
- Family law (SAZ-resident families)
- CMS-related disputes (all disputes arising from CMS participation within SAZ)
- Commercial disputes (business transactions with SAZ nexus)

**Nexus Requirement for Civil Matters:** At least one of the following must apply:

- At least one party is an SAZ resident
- The subject property is located within SAZ
- The transaction or event occurred within SAZ

Non-residents may be plaintiffs or defendants in SAZ courts when the nexus requirement is met. Disputes with no SAZ connection use national courts.

**Criminal Matters:**

- Offenses occurring within SAZ
- Offenses by SAZ residents within SAZ
- SAZ court jurisdiction: Offenses with maximum penalty up to 10 years

**Reserved to National Courts (regardless of penalty):**

National security offenses (treason, espionage, and similar offenses against national governments) are reserved to national courts regardless of maximum penalty. See [SAZ Legal Framework Section 7.1](01-saz-legal-framework.md#71-saz-to-national-relationship).

**Serious Offenses (Maximum Penalty >10 Years):**

Offenses occurring within SAZ that carry maximum penalties exceeding 10 years are tried in national courts under the following framework:

| Offense Location | Defendant | Forum | Applicable Law |
|------------------|-----------|-------|----------------|
| Within SAZ | SAZ resident (Israeli-origin) | Israeli national court | Israeli criminal law |
| Within SAZ | SAZ resident (Palestinian-origin) | Palestinian national court | Palestinian criminal law |
| Within SAZ | Non-resident | Defendant's national court | Defendant's national law |
| Within SAZ | Dual/disputed status | JSVC determines forum | Per JSVC determination |

**Serious Offense Coordination:**

- SAZ police investigate and collect evidence
- Case file transferred to national prosecutor
- JSVC monitors to prevent double jeopardy
- Guarantor oversight of fair trial standards
- SAZ may request case return if penalty reduced below 10-year threshold

**Administrative Matters:**

- Review of SAZ agency decisions
- Licensing and permit disputes
- Employment disputes with SAZ
- Tax disputes

#### 3.2 Choice of Law

**Applicable Law Hierarchy:**
1. Constitutional Floor (supreme, cannot be overridden)
2. Confederal legislation
3. SAZ legislation
4. SAZ regulatory code
5. Customary practices (where consistent with above)

**Personal Status:**
- Residents may elect personal status law for family matters:
  - Israeli civil law
  - Palestinian civil law
  - SAZ secular law
  - Religious law (with limitations—no forced marriage, equal divorce rights, etc.)
- Children's best interests override parental choice

#### 3.3 Relationship to National Courts

**Principle:** SAZ courts are independent of national court systems.

**Recognition and Enforcement:**
- SAZ judgments enforceable in national courts through Confederal Agreement
- National judgments enforceable in SAZ through same mechanism
- Mutual recognition of judgments subject to public policy exception

**Conflict Resolution (aligned with [SAZ Legal Framework](01-saz-legal-framework.md#71-saz-to-national-relationship)):**

- SAZ courts have **primary jurisdiction** within SAZ boundaries for matters within SAZ competence
- National courts retain reserved matters (citizenship, national security, >10 year offenses, etc.)
- If jurisdiction is disputed, **JSVC determines the appropriate forum** (not plaintiff choice)
- Anti-suit injunctions prohibited
- Once forum is determined, that determination is binding absent appeal to Guarantor Forum

**Jurisdiction Dispute Resolution:**

| Dispute Type | Resolution Body | Appeal |
|--------------|-----------------|--------|
| SAZ vs national court jurisdiction | JSVC | Guarantor Forum |
| Constitutional Floor interpretation | Confederal Court | None (final) |
| Confederal law interpretation | Confederal Court | None (final) |
| Inter-SAZ disputes | Confederal Court | None (final) |

**Clarification:** JSVC determines which forum (SAZ or national) has jurisdiction over a specific case. Confederal Court interprets constitutional and confederal law but does not serve as a forum-assignment body for SAZ vs national court disputes.

## Integrated Police Force

### 1. Force Composition

#### 1.1 Personnel Sources

**Recruitment:**
- Open recruitment from SAZ residents
- Prior police experience preferred but not required
- Prohibition on prior paramilitary membership
- Security vetting by guarantor-supervised body

**Community Balance:**

- Force must reflect SAZ demographic composition within 10 percentage points (see rationale below)
- Active recruitment from underrepresented community
- No patrol unit more than 70% from single community
- Command positions balanced

**Tolerance Rationale:** Police forces are smaller than civil service (minimum 50 officers vs. hundreds of civil servants), making tight percentage tolerances impractical. The ±10% tolerance allows flexibility in hiring qualified candidates while maintaining meaningful balance. This differs from civil service balance targets, which apply to larger workforces where precise percentages are achievable.

#### 1.2 Training Requirements

**Initial Training:**
- 12-month academy (established with guarantor assistance)
- Curriculum includes:
  - Professional policing standards
