## 1. Legal Nature of SAZ

### 1.1 Definition

A Special Administrative Zone (SAZ) is a **defined territory within the MCF operational area** where:

- Mixed governance is piloted
- Confederal Rights Compact applies territorially
- Demilitarization and integrated policing replace national security forces
- Residents participate in local self-governance
- Sovereignty claims are preserved but administrative authority is transferred

### 1.2 Sui Generis Character

SAZs are **sui generis**—unique legal constructs that do not fit neatly into existing categories:

| What SAZ Is NOT | Why Not |
|-----------------|---------|
| **State** | No sovereignty; no UN membership; no diplomatic capacity |
| **Occupation** | Not established by conquest; voluntary participation |
| **Annexation** | Sovereignty claims preserved; temporary and renewable |
| **Condominium** | Not joint sovereignty; administrative transfer only |
| **Trusteeship** | Not UN-administered; MCF institutional governance |
| **Free city** | Not independent; integrated with MCF framework |

SAZs are best understood as **experimental governance zones** operating under international guarantee.

### 1.3 International Precedents

SAZs draw conceptually from various precedents:

| Precedent | Similarity | Difference |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| **Hong Kong SAR** | Special administrative status within larger framework | Hong Kong is within single sovereignty; SAZ is between contested sovereignties |
| **Brčko District** | Neutral zone between entities | Brčko is arbitrated solution; SAZ is voluntary pilot |
| **Trieste Free Territory** | International administration during sovereignty dispute | Trieste had UN administration; SAZ has MCF/guarantor oversight |
| **European Coal and Steel Community** | Functional integration without full political merger | ECSC was economic; SAZ is comprehensive governance |
| **Åland Islands** | Demilitarized, autonomous within state | Åland is within Finland; SAZ crosses contested boundaries |

SAZs differ from all precedents in their **explicitly experimental, renewable, and reversible** character.

### 1.4 Legal Basis

SAZ legal authority derives from:

| Source | Contribution |
|--------|--------------|
| **Party agreement** | Both parties consent to SAZ establishment (even if disagreeing on underlying sovereignty) |
| **Guarantor endorsement** | International legitimacy and enforcement capacity |
| **Resident consent** | Democratic legitimacy from population |
| **MCF institutional framework** | Governance rules and oversight |

No single source is sufficient; SAZ legitimacy requires all four.

---

## 2. Establishment Mechanisms

### 2.1 Establishment Options

SAZs may be established through several mechanisms:

| Mechanism | Description | When Appropriate |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Bilateral agreement** | Both parties jointly agree to SAZ | Ideal case; strongest legitimacy |
| **Unilateral offer** | One party offers territory; other accepts access | Asymmetric situations |
| **Guarantor facilitation** | Guarantors propose; parties accept | Deadlock scenarios |
| **Community petition** | Local community requests SAZ status | Bottom-up demand |

### 2.2 Bilateral Agreement Model

**Strongest legitimacy; preferred approach.**

```text
BILATERAL SAZ ESTABLISHMENT

Step 1: Proposal
├── Either party or JSVC proposes SAZ location
├── Initial feasibility assessment
├── Guarantor preliminary endorsement
└── Public consultation initiated

Step 2: Negotiation
├── Territory delimitation
├── Term and renewal conditions
├── Governance arrangements
├── Security provisions
├── Resource and revenue sharing
└── Transition procedures

Step 3: Agreement
├── Formal bilateral agreement signed
├── Guarantor signatures as witnesses
├── Ratification per each party's requirements
└── MCF institutional approval

Step 4: Implementation
├── Transition period initiated
├── Governance structures established
├── Population registration
├── Full SAZ operations commence
```

### 2.3 Unilateral Offer Model

**Applicable when bilateral negotiation is blocked.**

| Element | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| **Offering party** | Designates territory willing to place under SAZ governance |
| **Acceptance** | Other party accepts access for its population without conceding sovereignty |
| **Governance** | MCF institutions exercise governance authority |
| **Security** | Guarantors provide security; demilitarization from both parties |
| **Legal status** | Sovereignty dispute explicitly unresolved; administrative authority transferred |

This model allows SAZ establishment without requiring agreement on sovereignty.

### 2.4 Community Petition Model

**Bottom-up establishment where local demand exists.**

Requirements for community petition:

| Requirement | Threshold |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Population support** | >50% of eligible residents sign petition |
| **Community diversity** | Petition includes members of both communities |
| **Geographic coherence** | Proposed territory is contiguous and viable |
| **Feasibility** | JSVC determines operational feasibility |
| **Party non-objection** | Neither party actively blocks (silence = non-objection after 90 days) |

Community-initiated SAZs require additional guarantor support due to weaker governmental endorsement.

### 2.5 Establishment Agreement Content

All SAZ establishment agreements must address:

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Territory** | Precise boundary definition |
| **Term** | Initial duration and renewal conditions |
| **Governance** | Governance structure and authorities |
| **Security** | Demilitarization, policing, external guarantees |
| **Rights** | CRC application and enforcement |
| **Economics** | Revenue, taxation, services |
| **Transition** | Entry and exit procedures |
| **Dispute resolution** | Mechanisms for agreement interpretation disputes |

---

## 3. Term and Renewal

### 3.1 Initial Term

SAZ establishment is for a **fixed initial term**:

| Term Element | Standard Provision |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Duration** | 30 years (negotiable: 25-50 years) |
| **Commencement** | Date of full operational status (after transition period) |
| **Early review** | Mandatory review at year 10 and year 20 |
| **Early termination** | Available under specific conditions (see Section 8) |

Longer terms provide stability; shorter terms reduce commitment anxiety. 30 years balances these concerns.

### 3.2 Renewal Conditions

Renewal requires **mutual consent**:

```text
RENEWAL PROCESS

Year 25 (5 years before expiry):
├── Renewal discussion formally initiated
├── Performance assessment completed
├── Population consultation conducted
└── Negotiation of renewal terms

Year 28 (2 years before expiry):
├── Renewal decision deadline
├── If agreed: Renewal agreement signed
├── If not agreed: Termination planning begins
└── Resident notification

Renewal options:
├── Full renewal: Same or modified terms
├── Partial renewal: Reduced territory or modified governance
├── Extension: Short-term extension for continued negotiation
└── Termination: Orderly wind-down
```

### 3.3 Automatic Extension Provisions

To prevent manipulation, automatic extension applies when:

| Condition | Extension |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Negotiation ongoing** | 2-year automatic extension |
| **External crisis** | Extension until stability restored |
| **Resident protection** | Extension necessary to protect resident rights |
| **Guarantor determination** | Guarantors determine extension necessary for orderly transition |

Automatic extension prevents parties from allowing SAZ to lapse to escape obligations.

### 3.4 Non-Renewal Consequences

If renewal is not achieved:

- SAZ terminates at end of term (or extension)
- Termination procedures apply (Section 8)
- Resident protections activated
- No automatic reversion of rights
- Future SAZ establishment remains possible

---

## 4. Sovereignty Treatment

### 4.1 Sovereignty Preservation Doctrine

SAZ establishment **does not resolve sovereignty disputes**:

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Non-prejudice** | SAZ establishment neither supports nor undermines either party's sovereignty claim |
| **Status quo ante** | Upon termination, sovereignty status returns to pre-SAZ condition |
| **No precedent** | SAZ arrangements create no precedent for final status |
| **Explicit non-recognition** | SAZ documents explicitly disclaim sovereignty determination |

### 4.2 Symbolic Sovereignty

Parties may maintain symbolic expressions of sovereignty within SAZ:

| Permitted | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Flag display** | Both parties' flags may be displayed |
| **National holidays** | Both parties' holidays may be observed |
| **Cultural expression** | Both parties' cultural events may be held |
| **Identity documents** | Residents may hold either party's documents |

### 4.3 Effective Administration vs. Sovereignty

SAZ separates **effective administration** from **sovereignty**:

| Element | SAZ Treatment |
|---------|---------------|
| **Administration** | Transferred to SAZ governance |
| **Sovereignty claim** | Preserved but not exercised |
| **International law** | Both parties' obligations continue |
| **Future status** | Undetermined; subject to final status agreement |

### 4.4 Sovereignty Disputes During SAZ Operation

If sovereignty disputes arise during SAZ operation:

- SAZ operation continues regardless
- Disputes handled through established MCF mechanisms
- SAZ governance not subordinate to either party's claims
- Guarantors provide stability during disputes

---

## 5. International Status

### 5.1 UN Recognition

SAZ does not seek UN membership or recognition as a state:

| UN Relationship | Status |
|-----------------|--------|
| **Membership** | Not applicable; SAZ is not a state |
| **Observer status** | Not sought |
| **Reporting** | Through guarantor states and parties |
| **Peacekeeping** | Guarantor commitment, not UN deployment |

### 5.2 Treaty Capacity

SAZ has **limited treaty capacity**:

| Treaty Type | Capacity |
|-------------|----------|
| **MCF agreements** | Full capacity |
| **Guarantor agreements** | Full capacity |
| **Technical agreements** | With party consent |
| **International treaties** | No independent capacity |

SAZ operates within the MCF framework rather than as an independent international actor.

### 5.3 Diplomatic Status

SAZ facilities and personnel may receive limited diplomatic protections:

| Element | Status |
|---------|--------|
| **SAZ offices** | Protected premises under guarantor agreements |
| **SAZ officials** | Functional immunity for official acts |
| **MCF personnel** | Protected under MCF framework |
| **Communications** | Protected channels through MCF systems |

### 5.4 International Organization Relationship

SAZ may participate in international organizations through MCF:

- Technical bodies (standards, telecommunications, etc.)
- Regional economic arrangements
- Cultural and educational exchanges
- Humanitarian coordination

Participation is as MCF component, not as independent entity.

## 6. Territorial Definition

### 6.1 Boundary Requirements

SAZ boundaries must be:

| Requirement | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Clearly defined** | Prevents ambiguity and dispute |
| **Surveyed and marked** | Physical demarcation |
| **Internationally documented** | Guarantor verification |
| **Operationally viable** | Sufficient for governance functions |

### 6.2 Boundary Demarcation Process

```text
BOUNDARY DEMARCATION

Step 1: Negotiation
├── Parties propose boundary options
├── Technical experts assess viability
├── Population impact analysis
└── Draft boundary agreement

Step 2: Survey
├── Joint survey team (parties + guarantors)
├── Physical survey and mapping
├── Marker placement
└── Documentation and registration

Step 3: Verification
├── Independent verification
├── Dispute resolution for contested points
├── Final boundary certification
└── International notification

Step 4: Maintenance
├── Regular boundary inspection
├── Marker maintenance
├── Modification procedures if needed
```

### 6.3 Boundary Modification

Boundaries may be modified through:

| Mechanism | Requirements |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Mutual agreement** | Both parties agree |
| **Community petition** | Affected residents petition; guarantor approval |
| **Operational necessity** | MCF determines modification necessary; parties consulted |
| **Dispute resolution** | Arbitration resolves boundary disputes |

### 6.4 Enclave and Access Provisions

If SAZ is not contiguous:

- Access corridors guaranteed
- Transit rights through non-SAZ territory
- Communication and transportation links protected
- Multiple SAZ components coordinate as single unit

## 7. SAZ Relationship Architecture

### 7.1 SAZ-to-National Relationship

| Dimension | Relationship |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Jurisdiction** | SAZ jurisdiction replaces national jurisdiction within boundaries |
| **Services** | SAZ may contract with national providers |
| **Courts** | SAZ courts have primary jurisdiction; limited national court role |
| **Citizenship** | Residents retain existing citizenship; no SAZ citizenship |
| **Taxation** | SAZ taxation within boundaries; coordination with national systems |

### 7.2 SAZ-to-SAZ Relationship

When multiple SAZs exist:

| Element | Coordination |
|---------|--------------|
| **Governance** | Common standards; independent administration |
| **Movement** | Free movement between SAZs for residents |
| **Courts** | Mutual recognition; common appellate system |
| **Services** | May share services and infrastructure |
| **Learning** | Institutionalized learning transfer |

### 7.3 SAZ-to-MCF Relationship

| MCF Component | SAZ Relationship |
|---------------|------------------|
| **JSVC** | Oversight, verification, dispute resolution |
| **CRC** | Applies territorially within SAZ |
| **Shock-absorber** | SAZ incidents within shock-absorber framework |
| **Economic architecture** | SAZ integrated into MCF economic systems |
| **Operational procedures** | Phase transitions, regression, exit apply to SAZ |

### 7.4 SAZ-to-Guarantor Relationship

| Guarantor Function | Implementation |
|--------------------|----------------|
| **Security guarantee** | Rapid response commitment |
| **Oversight** | Regular monitoring and reporting |
| **Dispute resolution** | Arbitration and facilitation |
| **Funding** | Development and operational support |
| **International legitimacy** | Diplomatic backing |

---

## 8. Termination and Transition

### 8.1 Termination Scenarios

SAZ may terminate through:

| Scenario | Trigger | Process |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Term expiry** | End of term without renewal | Orderly wind-down |
| **Mutual agreement** | Parties agree to terminate early | Negotiated termination |
| **Phase regression** | MCF-wide regression from Phase 2 | Per regression procedures |
| **Fundamental breach** | Party seriously violates SAZ agreement | Remediation or termination |
| **Emergency** | Conditions make operation impossible | Emergency procedures |

### 8.2 Orderly Termination Process

```text
ORDERLY TERMINATION

Phase 1: Notice Period (12-24 months)
├── Termination formally announced
├── Resident notification and consultation
├── Governance transition planning
├── Asset and liability inventory
└── Personnel transition planning

Phase 2: Governance Transition (6-12 months)
├── SAZ governance authorities transfer
├── Successor arrangements established
├── Service continuity ensured
├── Records transferred or archived

Phase 3: Resident Protection (ongoing)
├── Resident status protection activated
├── Relocation assistance available
├── Property and benefit protection
└── CMS status preservation

Phase 4: Final Closure
├── SAZ formally dissolved
├── Final accounting and reporting
├── Lessons documented
├── Future options preserved
```

### 8.3 Resident Protection Upon Termination

| Protection | Mechanism |
|------------|-----------|
| **Status** | CMS status preserved; personal CRC rights continue |
| **Property** | Property rights protected under successor arrangements |
| **Relocation** | Voluntary relocation assistance available |
| **Benefits** | Transition period for benefit wind-down |
| **Non-discrimination** | Former SAZ residents protected from discrimination |

### 8.4 Asset and Liability Handling

|----------|-----------|
| **Infrastructure** | Transfer to successor authority or compensation |
| **Movable assets** | MCF retention or disposal |
| **Liabilities** | Discharge per agreement terms |
| **Financial reserves** | Applied to transition costs; remainder per agreement |
| **Records** | Archived for accountability and future use |

### 8.5 Emergency Termination

When immediate termination is necessary:

- Resident safety is paramount
- Evacuation assistance provided
- Essential services maintained during evacuation
- Compressed timeline but resident protection maintained
- Post-emergency accounting and documentation

## 9. Integration with MCF Framework

### 9.1 Phase Transition Integration

SAZ relates to MCF phases as follows:

| Phase | SAZ Relationship |
|-------|------------------|
| **Phase 0-1** | SAZ not yet established; prerequisites being built |
| **Phase 1-2 transition** | External SAZ pilot may precede internal SAZ |
| **Phase 2** | Internal SAZ operational; primary Phase 2 mechanism |
| **Phase 3** | SAZ may evolve toward deeper integration or continue |

### 9.2 Operational Procedures Integration

| Procedure | SAZ Application |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Risk management** | SAZ risks within MCF risk framework |
| **Phase transitions** | SAZ-specific transition criteria |
| **Phase regression** | SAZ may regress independently or with MCF-wide regression |
| **Spoiler response** | SAZ spoiler incidents within MCF response framework |
| **Exit conditions** | SAZ termination is one possible exit pathway |

### 9.3 Dispute Resolution Integration

SAZ disputes handled through MCF mechanisms:

| Dispute Type | Forum |
|--------------|-------|
| **Individual rights** | SAZ courts → CRC Review Panel |
| **Governance disputes** | SAZ courts → MCF appellate system |
| **Inter-SAZ disputes** | MCF arbitration |
| **SAZ-national disputes** | Guarantor-facilitated arbitration |
| **Establishment disputes** | Guarantor arbitration |
