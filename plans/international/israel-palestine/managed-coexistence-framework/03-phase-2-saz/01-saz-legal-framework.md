## 1. Legal Nature of SAZ

### 1.1 Definition

A Special Administrative Zone (SAZ) is a **defined territory within the MCF operational area** where:

- Mixed governance is piloted
- Confederal Rights Compact applies territorially
- Demilitarization and integrated policing replace national security forces
- Residents participate in local self-governance
- Sovereignty claims are preserved but administrative authority is transferred

### 1.2 Sui Generis Character

SAZs are **sui generis**—unique legal constructs that do not fit neatly into existing categories:

| What SAZ Is NOT | Why Not |
|-----------------|---------|
| **State** | No sovereignty; no UN membership; no diplomatic capacity |
| **Occupation** | Not established by conquest; voluntary participation |
| **Annexation** | Sovereignty claims preserved; temporary and renewable |
| **Condominium** | Not joint sovereignty; administrative transfer only |
| **Trusteeship** | Not UN-administered; MCF institutional governance |
| **Free city** | Not independent; integrated with MCF framework |

SAZs are best understood as **experimental governance zones** operating under international guarantee.

### 1.3 International Precedents

SAZs draw conceptually from various precedents:

| Precedent | Similarity | Difference |
|-----------|------------|------------|
| **Hong Kong SAR** | Special administrative status within larger framework | Hong Kong is within single sovereignty; SAZ is between contested sovereignties |
| **Brčko District** | Neutral zone between entities | Brčko is arbitrated solution; SAZ is voluntary pilot |
| **Trieste Free Territory** | International administration during sovereignty dispute | Trieste had UN administration; SAZ has MCF/guarantor oversight |
| **European Coal and Steel Community** | Functional integration without full political merger | ECSC was economic; SAZ is comprehensive governance |
| **Åland Islands** | Demilitarized, autonomous within state | Åland is within Finland; SAZ crosses contested boundaries |

SAZs differ from all precedents in their **explicitly experimental, renewable, and reversible** character.

### 1.4 Legal Basis

SAZ legal authority derives from:

| Source | Contribution | Requirement |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **Party agreement** | Both parties consent to SAZ establishment (even if disagreeing on underlying sovereignty) | At least non-objection; bilateral agreement preferred |
| **Guarantor endorsement** | International legitimacy and enforcement capacity | Formal guarantor endorsement required |
| **Resident consent** | Democratic legitimacy from population | Referendum required for all establishment paths (see Section 2.6) |
| **MCF institutional framework** | Governance rules and oversight | Compliance with MCF standards |

No single source is sufficient; SAZ legitimacy requires all four.

**Resident Consent Requirement:** All SAZ establishment paths require demonstrated resident consent through referendum (Section 2.6). Party agreement or guarantor endorsement cannot substitute for resident consent. This requirement ensures that SAZs are not imposed on unwilling populations.

---

## 2. Establishment Mechanisms

### 2.1 Establishment Options

SAZs may be established through several mechanisms:

| Mechanism | Description | When Appropriate |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|
| **Bilateral agreement** | Both parties jointly agree to SAZ | Ideal case; strongest legitimacy |
| **Unilateral offer** | One party offers territory; other accepts access | Asymmetric situations |
| **Guarantor facilitation** | Guarantors propose; parties accept | Deadlock scenarios |
| **Community petition** | Local community requests SAZ status | Bottom-up demand |

### 2.2 Bilateral Agreement Model

**Strongest legitimacy; preferred approach.**

```text
BILATERAL SAZ ESTABLISHMENT

Step 1: Proposal
├── Either party or JSVC proposes SAZ location
├── Initial feasibility assessment
├── Guarantor preliminary endorsement
└── Public consultation initiated

Step 2: Negotiation
├── Territory delimitation
├── Term and renewal conditions
├── Governance arrangements
├── Security provisions
├── Resource and revenue sharing
└── Transition procedures

Step 3: Resident Consent (see Section 2.6)
├── Referendum conducted in proposed SAZ territory
├── Thresholds: 50% participation, 55% approval, 30% minimum in each community
├── If thresholds not met: process halts; may be re-attempted after 24 months
└── If thresholds met: proceed to agreement

Step 4: Agreement
├── Formal bilateral agreement signed
├── Guarantor signatures as witnesses
├── Ratification per each party's requirements
└── MCF institutional approval

Step 5: Implementation
├── Transition period initiated
├── Governance structures established
├── Population registration
├── Full SAZ operations commence
```

### 2.3 Unilateral Offer Model

**Applicable when bilateral negotiation is blocked.**

| Element | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| **Offering party** | Designates territory willing to place under SAZ governance |
| **Acceptance** | Other party accepts access for its population without conceding sovereignty |
| **Resident consent** | Referendum required per Section 2.6 (same thresholds as bilateral model) |
| **Governance** | MCF institutions exercise governance authority |
| **Security** | Guarantors provide security; demilitarization from both parties |
| **Legal status** | Sovereignty dispute explicitly unresolved; administrative authority transferred |

This model allows SAZ establishment without requiring agreement on sovereignty.

**Resident Consent in Unilateral Model:** Even when one party offers territory unilaterally, residents must approve via referendum before SAZ establishment proceeds. Offering party's willingness does not substitute for resident consent.

### 2.4 Community Petition Model

**Bottom-up establishment where local demand exists.**

Requirements for community petition:

| Requirement | Threshold |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Population support** | >50% of eligible residents sign petition |
| **Per-community support** | Petition signed by ≥30% of each community's eligible residents |
| **Geographic coherence** | Proposed territory is contiguous and viable |
| **Feasibility** | JSVC determines operational feasibility |
| **Party non-objection** | Neither party actively blocks (silence = non-objection after 90 days) |
| **Referendum confirmation** | Successful referendum per Section 2.6 required after petition |

**Per-Community Threshold Rationale:** The 30% per-community minimum prevents majoritarian capture where one community's supermajority support could impose SAZ status over another community's opposition. Both communities must demonstrate meaningful support.

**Petition-to-Referendum Process:**

1. Petition submitted with verified signatures and community breakdown
2. JSVC verifies thresholds and feasibility
3. 90-day party objection period
4. If no objection: referendum conducted per Section 2.6
5. If active objection filed: blocked-petition escalation (see below)
6. Referendum thresholds apply (50% participation, 55% approval, 30% per-community)

**Blocked-Petition Escalation (Active Objection):**

The 90-day silence rule provides a non-objection pathway. When a central authority files an active objection to a verified community petition, the following escalation applies:

| Stage | Timeline | Process |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Objection documentation** | Day 0 | Central authority files written objection with stated grounds |
| **Grounds review** | 30 days | Guarantor Forum reviews whether objection is based on substantive grounds (security, feasibility, legal) or is a political block without substantive basis |
| **Mediation** | 30-120 days | If grounds are contestable: Guarantor Forum mediates between central authority and petitioning community |
| **Mediation outcome** | Day 120 | If mediation succeeds: proceed to referendum with agreed modifications. If mediation fails: Guarantor Forum issues determination |

**Guarantor Forum Determination:**

If mediation fails, the Guarantor Forum determines whether the central authority's objection constitutes:

1. **Substantive objection** (legitimate security, feasibility, or legal concern): Petition is paused. Community may address concerns and re-petition after 12 months.
2. **Non-substantive blocking** (political veto without demonstrated security, feasibility, or legal basis): Guarantor Forum may authorize the referendum to proceed under guarantor facilitation (Section 2.1), with the central authority's objection documented but not dispositive.

**Non-Interference Conditionality:**

The framework does not authorize SAZ establishment over sovereign objection by force. However, guarantors apply **conditionality of aid** as a structural incentive against non-substantive blocking:

- Guarantor states condition general budget support to the blocking authority (PA budgetary aid, Israeli security cooperation packages) on non-interference with verified community SAZ petitions
- Conditioning applies only when the Guarantor Forum has determined the objection is non-substantive
- The mechanism preserves the legal fiction of sovereign consent (central authority can withdraw its objection at any time to restore unconditional aid) while making the cost of blocking a democratic local vote economically significant

**Safeguard:** Non-Interference Conditionality may NOT be applied when the Guarantor Forum has determined the objection is substantive. Guarantors cannot use aid conditionality to override legitimate security or legal concerns.

Community-initiated SAZs require additional guarantor support due to weaker governmental endorsement.

### 2.5 Establishment Agreement Content

All SAZ establishment agreements must address:

| Element | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Territory** | Precise boundary definition |
| **Term** | Initial duration and renewal conditions |
| **Governance** | Governance structure and authorities |
| **Security** | Demilitarization, policing, external guarantees |
| **Rights** | CRC application and enforcement |
| **Economics** | Revenue, taxation, services |
| **Transition** | Entry and exit procedures |
| **Dispute resolution** | Mechanisms for agreement interpretation disputes |
| **Utilities** | Independent provisioning authority per [Operational Autarky Principle](../07-economic-architecture/05-infrastructure-coordination.md) |

**Utility Provisioning Authority:**

Each SAZ establishment agreement must grant the SAZ governing authority the right to:

1. **Procure independent utility infrastructure** (electricity, water, telecommunications) without requiring Host State approval for generation, treatment, or transmission equipment within SAZ boundaries
2. **Connect to national grids** on non-discriminatory commercial terms where available, but with no obligation to depend on such connections for critical operations
3. **Contract directly with guarantor-facilitated providers** (LEO satellite operators, equipment suppliers) for infrastructure that bypasses national distribution networks
4. **Classify sustained connection refusal as obstruction** per the timelines in [Infrastructure Coordination](../07-economic-architecture/05-infrastructure-coordination.md), triggering guarantor diplomatic and conditionality responses

This authority implements the [Off-Grid Primary Design](../07-economic-architecture/05-infrastructure-coordination.md) and [Satellite-First Connectivity](../07-economic-architecture/05-infrastructure-coordination.md) standards at the legal-framework level, ensuring SAZs have explicit treaty-based authorization for operational independence.

### 2.6 Resident Consent Referendum

**Purpose:** All SAZ establishment paths require demonstrated resident consent through referendum. This section defines the referendum requirements that apply to bilateral (Section 2.2), unilateral (Section 2.3), and community petition (Section 2.4) establishment paths.

**Referendum Thresholds:**

| Threshold | Requirement | Rationale |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Participation** | ≥50% of eligible residents vote | Ensures meaningful engagement |
| **Approval** | ≥55% of votes cast in favor | Supermajority prevents narrow imposition |
| **Per-community minimum** | ≥30% approval in each community | Prevents majoritarian capture |

**Single-Community Exception:** If the proposed SAZ has only one community with meaningful presence (the other community constitutes <10% of population), the per-community threshold applies only to the majority community at establishment. The per-community threshold for the minority community activates once that community reaches 10% of SAZ population, tested at each mandatory 5-year review. This exception allows single-community sites to establish with the expectation of becoming mixed over time, while protecting minority newcomers once they reach meaningful presence.

**Eligibility:**

- Adult residents (18+) who have resided in proposed SAZ territory for ≥12 months
- Both Israeli and Palestinian residents eligible regardless of citizenship or legal status
- CMS status not required for referendum eligibility

**Referendum Administration:**

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| **Conducting authority** | JSVC with guarantor observation |
| **Campaign period** | Minimum 60 days |
| **Information access** | Neutral information materials in Hebrew, Arabic, English |
| **Voting method** | In-person with paper ballot; absentee voting available |
| **Observers** | International election observers required |
| **Certification** | Guarantor certification of fairness required before result is binding |

**Failed Referendum:**

- If any threshold is not met, SAZ establishment halts
- Re-referendum permitted after 24-month cooling-off period
- Modified proposals (different boundaries, terms) may be subject to new referendum
- Parties may not proceed with SAZ establishment without successful referendum

**Referendum Question Format:**

> "Do you approve the establishment of a Special Administrative Zone in [defined territory] under the terms specified in the [Establishment Agreement / Proposal], for an initial term of [X] years?"

---

## 3. Term and Renewal

### 3.1 Initial Term

SAZ establishment is for a **fixed initial term**:

| Term Element | Standard Provision |
|--------------|-------------------|
| **Duration** | 30 years (negotiable: 25-50 years) |
| **Commencement** | Date of full operational status (after transition period) |
| **Early review** | Mandatory review at year 10 and year 20 |
| **Early termination** | Available under specific conditions (see Section 8) |

Longer terms provide stability; shorter terms reduce commitment anxiety. 30 years balances these concerns.

### 3.2 Renewal Conditions

Renewal requires **mutual consent**:

```text
RENEWAL PROCESS

Year 25 (5 years before expiry):
├── Renewal discussion formally initiated
├── Performance assessment completed
├── Population consultation conducted
└── Negotiation of renewal terms

Year 28 (2 years before expiry):
├── Renewal decision deadline
├── If agreed: Renewal agreement signed
├── If not agreed: Termination planning begins
└── Resident notification

Renewal options:
├── Full renewal: Same or modified terms
├── Partial renewal: Reduced territory or modified governance
├── Extension: Short-term extension for continued negotiation
└── Termination: Orderly wind-down
```

### 3.3 Automatic Extension Provisions

To prevent manipulation, automatic extension applies when:

| Condition | Extension | Maximum |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Negotiation ongoing** | 2-year automatic extension | 4 years total (2 extensions maximum) |
| **External crisis** | Extension during crisis | 5 years maximum; requires guarantor certification every 12 months |
| **Resident protection** | Extension for orderly transition | 3 years maximum |
| **Guarantor determination** | Guarantors determine extension necessary | 3 years maximum |

**Automatic Extension Caps and Limits:**

- **Cumulative cap:** No more than 10 years of automatic extensions total, regardless of triggering conditions
- **Guarantor review:** All automatic extensions require guarantor review and certification every 12 months
- **Resident consultation:** Extensions beyond 2 years require resident consultation (not binding referendum, but documented input)
- **Party notification:** Parties must be notified within 30 days of any automatic extension trigger

**Mutual Consent Remains Primary:** Automatic extensions are **exceptional measures** to prevent manipulation and protect residents. They do not replace the mutual consent requirement for ordinary renewal. Once extension conditions resolve, parties must either achieve mutual consent for renewal or proceed to termination.

Automatic extension prevents parties from allowing SAZ to lapse to escape obligations, while caps prevent indefinite extension that circumvents the mutual consent requirement.

### 3.4 Non-Renewal Consequences

If renewal is not achieved:

- SAZ terminates at end of term (or extension)
- Termination procedures apply (Section 8)
- Resident protections activated
- No automatic reversion of rights
- Future SAZ establishment remains possible

---

## 4. Sovereignty Treatment

### 4.1 Sovereignty Preservation Doctrine

SAZ establishment **does not resolve sovereignty disputes**:

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Non-prejudice** | SAZ establishment neither supports nor undermines either party's sovereignty claim |
| **Status quo ante** | Upon termination, sovereignty status returns to pre-SAZ condition |
| **No precedent** | SAZ arrangements create no precedent for final status |
| **Explicit non-recognition** | SAZ documents explicitly disclaim sovereignty determination |

### 4.2 Symbolic Sovereignty

Parties may maintain symbolic expressions of sovereignty within SAZ:

| Permitted | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Flag display** | Both parties' flags may be displayed |
| **National holidays** | Both parties' holidays may be observed |
| **Cultural expression** | Both parties' cultural events may be held |
| **Identity documents** | Residents may hold either party's documents |

### 4.3 Effective Administration vs. Sovereignty

SAZ separates **effective administration** from **sovereignty**:

| Element | SAZ Treatment |
|---------|---------------|
| **Administration** | Transferred to SAZ governance |
| **Sovereignty claim** | Preserved but not exercised |
| **International law** | Both parties' obligations continue |
| **Future status** | Undetermined; subject to final status agreement |

### 4.4 Sovereignty Disputes During SAZ Operation

If sovereignty disputes arise during SAZ operation:

- SAZ operation continues regardless
- Disputes handled through established MCF mechanisms
- SAZ governance not subordinate to either party's claims
- Guarantors provide stability during disputes

---

## 5. International Status

### 5.1 UN Recognition

SAZ does not seek UN membership or recognition as a state:

| UN Relationship | Status |
|-----------------|--------|
| **Membership** | Not applicable; SAZ is not a state |
| **Observer status** | Not sought |
| **Reporting** | Through guarantor states and parties |
| **Peacekeeping** | Guarantor commitment, not UN deployment |

### 5.2 Treaty Capacity

SAZ has **limited treaty capacity**:

| Treaty Type | Capacity |
|-------------|----------|
| **MCF agreements** | Full capacity |
| **Guarantor agreements** | Full capacity |
| **Technical agreements** | With party consent |
| **International treaties** | No independent capacity |

SAZ operates within the MCF framework rather than as an independent international actor.

### 5.3 Diplomatic Status

SAZ facilities and personnel may receive limited diplomatic protections:

| Element | Status |
|---------|--------|
| **SAZ offices** | Protected premises under guarantor agreements |
| **SAZ officials** | Functional immunity for official acts |
| **MCF personnel** | Protected under MCF framework |
| **Communications** | Protected channels through MCF systems |

### 5.4 International Organization Relationship

SAZ may participate in international organizations through MCF:

- Technical bodies (standards, telecommunications, etc.)
- Regional economic arrangements
- Cultural and educational exchanges
- Humanitarian coordination

Participation is as MCF component, not as independent entity.

---

## 6. Territorial Definition

### 6.1 Boundary Requirements

SAZ boundaries must be:

| Requirement | Rationale |
|-------------|-----------|
| **Clearly defined** | Prevents ambiguity and dispute |
| **Surveyed and marked** | Physical demarcation |
| **Internationally documented** | Guarantor verification |
| **Operationally viable** | Sufficient for governance functions |

### 6.2 Boundary Demarcation Process

```text
BOUNDARY DEMARCATION

Step 1: Negotiation
├── Parties propose boundary options
├── Technical experts assess viability
├── Population impact analysis
└── Draft boundary agreement

Step 2: Survey
├── Joint survey team (parties + guarantors)
├── Physical survey and mapping
├── Marker placement
└── Documentation and registration

Step 3: Verification
├── Independent verification
├── Dispute resolution for contested points
├── Final boundary certification
└── International notification

Step 4: Maintenance
├── Regular boundary inspection
├── Marker maintenance
├── Modification procedures if needed
```

### 6.3 Boundary Modification

**Core Principle:** Boundary modifications affect territory and therefore implicate the sovereignty non-prejudice commitment (Section 4.1). All boundary modifications require party consent to preserve this commitment.

Boundaries may be modified through:

| Mechanism | Requirements | Consent Required |
|-----------|--------------|------------------|
| **Mutual agreement** | Both parties agree to modification | Party consent: both parties; Resident consent: affected area referendum |
| **Community petition** | Affected residents petition for modification | Party consent: both parties (non-objection after 90 days); Resident consent: affected area referendum |
| **Technical adjustment** | Minor corrections to demarcation (e.g., survey errors, infrastructure access) | Party consent: both parties; No referendum if <1% territory change |
| **Dispute resolution** | Arbitration resolves boundary ambiguities within original agreement | Party participation required; binding only on ambiguities, not expansions |

**Prohibited:** "Operational necessity" determinations by MCF cannot authorize boundary modifications without party consent. MCF may recommend modifications, but implementation requires the consent requirements above.

**Resident Consent for Boundary Modifications:**

| Modification Type | Resident Consent Requirement |
|-------------------|------------------------------|
| SAZ expansion (adding territory) | Referendum in territory to be added; same thresholds as establishment |
| SAZ contraction (removing territory) | Referendum in territory to be removed; 50% participation, simple majority |
| Technical adjustment (<1% territory) | No referendum required |

**Non-Prejudice Protection:** Boundary modifications do not alter the underlying sovereignty status. Modified boundaries are subject to the same non-prejudice provisions as original boundaries (Section 4.1).

### 6.4 Enclave and Access Provisions

If SAZ is not contiguous:

- Access corridors guaranteed
- Transit rights through non-SAZ territory
- Communication and transportation links protected
- Multiple SAZ components coordinate as single unit

---

## 7. SAZ Relationship Architecture

### 7.1 SAZ-to-National Relationship

| Dimension | Relationship |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Jurisdiction** | SAZ has primary jurisdiction within boundaries; national jurisdiction limited to reserved matters (see below) |
| **Services** | SAZ may contract with national providers |
| **Courts** | SAZ courts have primary jurisdiction; national courts retain reserved matters |
| **Citizenship** | Residents retain existing citizenship; no SAZ citizenship |
| **Taxation** | SAZ taxation within boundaries; coordination with national systems |

**Reserved National Court Jurisdiction:**

National courts retain jurisdiction over the following matters, even for events occurring within SAZ boundaries:

| Reserved Matter | Rationale |
|-----------------|-----------|
| **Citizenship determinations** | National citizenship is outside SAZ competence |
| **National security offenses** | Treason, espionage, and similar offenses against national governments |
| **Serious criminal offenses (>10 year max penalty)** | SAZ court capacity limits; ensures serious crimes receive appropriate resources (see [SAZ Governance Section 3.1](02-saz-governance.md#31-subject-matter-jurisdiction)) |
| **Cases involving non-SAZ parties** | Disputes where all parties are outside SAZ; SAZ courts require at least one SAZ-connected party |
| **Constitutional challenges to national law** | National constitutional interpretation |
| **Appeals from SAZ courts** | Limited appellate review (see Section 7.5) |
| **Enforcement of foreign judgments** | SAZ courts route to national courts for international enforcement |

**SAZ Primary Jurisdiction:**

SAZ courts have exclusive jurisdiction over:

| Matter | Scope |
|--------|-------|
| **Civil disputes** | Contracts, property, torts involving SAZ residents or SAZ-located assets |
| **Criminal offenses** | Offenses committed within SAZ boundaries with maximum penalty ≤10 years (serious offenses reserved to national courts) |
| **Administrative matters** | SAZ governance, licensing, permits, regulatory compliance |
| **CMS-related disputes** | All disputes arising from CMS participation within SAZ |
| **Commercial disputes** | Business transactions with SAZ nexus |

**Conflict Resolution:** If jurisdiction is disputed, the JSVC determines the appropriate forum. Parties may appeal JSVC forum determinations to the Guarantor Forum.

### 7.2 SAZ-to-SAZ Relationship

When multiple SAZs exist:

| Element | Coordination |
|---------|--------------|
| **Governance** | Common standards; independent administration |
| **Movement** | Free movement between SAZs for residents |
| **Courts** | Mutual recognition; common appellate system |
| **Services** | May share services and infrastructure |
| **Learning** | Institutionalized learning transfer |

### 7.3 SAZ-to-MCF Relationship

| MCF Component | SAZ Relationship |
|---------------|------------------|
| **JSVC** | Oversight, verification, dispute resolution |
| **CRC** | Applies territorially within SAZ |
| **Shock-absorber** | SAZ incidents within shock-absorber framework |
| **Economic architecture** | SAZ integrated into MCF economic systems |
| **Operational procedures** | Phase transitions, regression, exit apply to SAZ |

### 7.4 SAZ-to-Guarantor Relationship

| Guarantor Function | Implementation |
|--------------------|----------------|
| **Security guarantee** | Rapid response commitment |
| **Oversight** | Regular monitoring and reporting |
| **Dispute resolution** | Arbitration and facilitation |
| **Funding** | Development and operational support |
| **International legitimacy** | Diplomatic backing |

### 7.5 Appellate Review of SAZ Court Decisions

**General Principle:** SAZ court decisions are final within SAZ jurisdiction. National courts have limited appellate review for specific grounds only.

**Grounds for National Court Appellate Review:**

| Ground | Scope | Standard of Review | Exhaustion Requirement |
|--------|-------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Constitutional violation** | SAZ decision violates party constitutional rights | De novo review of constitutional issues | None (direct national court jurisdiction) |
| **CRC violation with constitutional overlay** | CRC breach that also implicates national constitutional rights | Review for manifest error | CRC Review Panel exhaustion required (see note) |
| **Jurisdictional overreach** | SAZ court exceeded its jurisdiction | De novo review of jurisdiction | None |
| **Procedural irregularity** | Severe due process violation | Clear error standard | SAZ appellate review exhaustion required |
| **Res judicata conflict** | SAZ decision conflicts with prior national court judgment | Review for conflict | None |

**CRC Violation Review Sequence:**

CRC violations are primarily resolved within the MCF system per Section 9.3:

1. **Primary forum:** SAZ courts → CRC Review Panel (MCF internal)
2. **National court role:** Only after CRC Review Panel exhaustion, and only when the CRC violation also implicates a national constitutional right
3. **Scope limit:** National courts review the constitutional overlay, not CRC interpretation; CRC Review Panel interpretation of CRC provisions is binding

**Rationale:** CRC is an MCF instrument; its interpretation belongs to MCF bodies. National courts retain jurisdiction over their own constitutional rights, but cannot override CRC Review Panel on CRC-specific questions.

**Excluded from National Appellate Review:**

- Ordinary factual disputes
- Interpretation of SAZ administrative rules
- CMS status determinations (these go to CMS Review Panel → CMS Appeals Board per [CMS Framework](../02-phase-1-civic-membership/01-cms-framework.md), not national courts)
- SAZ sentencing within authorized ranges
- Discretionary administrative decisions

**Appellate Procedure:**

| Stage | Process |
|-------|---------|
| **Notice of appeal** | Filed within 30 days of SAZ final judgment |
| **Certification** | SAZ court certifies appeal involves reviewable ground |
| **National court review** | Review limited to certified ground; no new evidence |
| **Remand authority** | National court may affirm, reverse, or remand to SAZ court |
| **Effect of remand** | SAZ court must apply national court's ruling on reviewed issue |

**Forum Selection:** Appellant selects which party's national court hears appeal. If both parties are from same national jurisdiction, that court hears appeal. If parties are from different jurisdictions, appellant selects; respondent may petition for transfer if forum selection is clearly inappropriate.

**JSVC Role:** JSVC monitors appellate patterns for systemic issues. If national courts consistently overturn SAZ decisions on particular grounds, JSVC may recommend SAZ procedure modifications.

---

## 8. Termination and Transition

### 8.1 Termination Scenarios

SAZ may terminate through:

| Scenario | Trigger | Process |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Term expiry** | End of term without renewal | Orderly wind-down |
| **Mutual agreement** | Parties agree to terminate early | Negotiated termination |
| **Phase regression** | MCF-wide regression from Phase 2 | Per regression procedures |
| **Fundamental breach** | Party seriously violates SAZ agreement | Remediation or termination |
| **Emergency** | Conditions make operation impossible | Emergency procedures |

### 8.2 Orderly Termination Process

```text
ORDERLY TERMINATION

Phase 1: Notice Period (12-24 months)
├── Termination formally announced
├── Resident notification and consultation

| **Infrastructure** | Transfer to successor authority or compensation |
| **Movable assets** | MCF retention or disposal |
| **Liabilities** | Discharge per agreement terms |
| **Financial reserves** | Applied to transition costs; remainder per agreement |
| **Records** | Archived for accountability and future use |

### 8.5 Emergency Termination

When immediate termination is necessary:

- Resident safety is paramount
- Evacuation assistance provided
- Essential services maintained during evacuation
- Compressed timeline but resident protection maintained
- Post-emergency accounting and documentation

---

## 9. Integration with MCF Framework

### 9.1 Phase Transition Integration

SAZ relates to MCF phases as follows:

| Phase | SAZ Relationship |
|-------|------------------|
| **Phase 0-1** | SAZ not yet established; prerequisites being built |
| **Phase 1-2 transition** | External SAZ pilot may precede internal SAZ |
| **Phase 2** | Internal SAZ operational; primary Phase 2 mechanism |
| **Phase 3** | SAZ may evolve toward deeper integration or continue |

### 9.2 Operational Procedures Integration

| Procedure | SAZ Application |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Risk management** | SAZ risks within MCF risk framework |
| **Phase transitions** | SAZ-specific transition criteria |
| **Phase regression** | SAZ may regress independently or with MCF-wide regression |
| **Spoiler response** | SAZ spoiler incidents within MCF response framework |
| **Exit conditions** | SAZ termination is one possible exit pathway |

### 9.3 Dispute Resolution Integration

SAZ disputes handled through MCF mechanisms:

| Dispute Type | Forum |
|--------------|-------|
| **Individual rights** | SAZ courts → CRC Review Panel |
| **Governance disputes** | SAZ courts → MCF appellate system |
| **Inter-SAZ disputes** | MCF arbitration |
| **SAZ-national disputes** | Guarantor-facilitated arbitration |
| **Establishment disputes** | Guarantor arbitration |

### Annex B: Sovereignty Disclaimer Language

Standard language for SAZ documents:

> This document and the arrangements it establishes do not constitute, imply, or create any precedent for resolution of sovereignty disputes between the parties. The establishment, operation, modification, or termination of the Special Administrative Zone does not prejudice, support, or undermine any party's claims to sovereignty over the territory in question. Upon termination, the sovereignty status of the territory shall revert to the status quo ante as of the date immediately prior to SAZ establishment, without prejudice to subsequent negotiations or agreements between the parties.

### Annex C: Term Comparison Table

| Term Length | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|-------------|------------|---------------|
| **25 years** | Lower commitment barrier | Less stability; frequent renewal stress |
| **30 years** | Balanced stability and flexibility | Standard MCF recommendation |
| **50 years** | Maximum stability; generational planning | Higher commitment barrier; less adaptable |
| **99 years** | Used in some lease arrangements | Excessive; inappropriate for experimental pilot |
