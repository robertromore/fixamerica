## 1. Overview and Constitutional Basis

### 1.1 Constitutional Mandate

Article XVII, Section 1 requires Congress to enact "an Elections Implementation Act specifying procedures for federal elections under regional administration."

Article VI establishes:
- National popular vote for President (Section 2)
- Majority winner requirement (Section 2)
- Regional certification timelines (Section 3)
- Automatic certification provisions (Section 4)

Article XVII, Section 2(c) provides default rules if Congress fails to act:
- National popular vote remains in force
- Administrative procedures follow prior federal law adapted for regional administration
- Electoral College is superseded
- Default 21-day runoff if no majority winner

### 1.2 Purpose

This Act ensures:
- Uniform administration of federal elections across Regions
- Clear procedures for regional certification
- Robust safeguards against election manipulation
- Transparent and auditable results

### 1.3 Guiding Principles

Per the design documents:
1. **Process legitimacy over efficiency**: Transparency matters more than speed
2. **Bounded consequences**: No single election determines total political reality
3. **Losers must believe the system**: Procedures must persuade skeptics
4. **De-totalization**: Regional autonomy limits stakes of national contests

## 2. Regional Election Administration

### 2.1 Regional Election Commissions

Each Region shall establish a Regional Election Commission (REC) with:

**Composition:**
- 5 members appointed by Regional Governor with legislative confirmation
- No more than 3 members from same political party
- At least 1 member with election administration experience
- At least 1 member with expertise in cybersecurity or data systems

**Terms:**
- 6-year staggered terms
- Members may serve no more than 2 terms

### 2.2 REC Powers and Duties

Regional Election Commissions shall:

1. Administer federal elections within the Region
2. Certify Regional election results

7. Investigate election irregularities

### 2.3 State and Local Role

States and localities administer elections under REC supervision:

Per Article VI, Section 4, certification authority resides in regional institutions. The state role in federal elections is ministerial:

- States compile county/local results and transmit them to the Regional Election Commission
- States have no discretionary authority to delay, modify, or refuse transmission
- State compilation does not constitute certification; only the REC certifies results
- If a state fails to transmit compiled results by the deadline, county/local results are transmitted directly to the REC

The Federal Election Assistance Administration (FEAA) shall:

- Provide technical assistance to RECs
