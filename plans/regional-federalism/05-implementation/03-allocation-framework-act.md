# Allocation Framework Act

## Recommended Implementation for Regional Federalism

> **Purpose:** To define jurisdictional boundaries, spillover criteria, and conflict resolution mechanisms as required by Article XVII of the Regional Federalism Constitution.

This Act operationalizes the allocation of powers described in [01-allocation-of-powers.md](../02-design/01-allocation-of-powers.md) by providing measurable criteria, institutional procedures, and enforcement mechanisms.

## 1. Overview and Constitutional Basis

### 1.1 Constitutional Mandate

Article XVII, Section 1 requires Congress to enact "an Allocation Framework Act defining jurisdictional boundaries and spillover criteria."

Article XVII, Section 2(a) provides that if Congress fails to act within two years, default rules apply: "the allocation of powers shall be governed by existing federal-state divisions, with Regions exercising authority over matters previously requiring interstate compacts."

### 1.2 Purpose

This Act provides:

- Clear definitions of which powers belong at which level
- Measurable criteria for determining when spillovers trigger regional authority
- Procedures for resolving jurisdictional disputes
- Mechanisms to prevent power creep at any level

### 1.3 Guiding Principles

Per the design documents, allocation follows these principles:

1. **Scale principle**: Powers belong at the level where effects are primarily felt
2. **Spillover principle**: Cross-jurisdictional effects trigger coordination requirements
3. **Subsidiarity with teeth**: Lower levels retain authority unless they cannot exercise it effectively
4. **Non-concurrency by default**: Powers are exclusive to one level unless explicitly shared

## 2. Jurisdictional Boundary Definitions

### 2.1 Federal Exclusive Powers

The following powers are exclusively federal and may not be exercised by Regions or States:

| Domain | Scope | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| National defense | Armed forces, military bases, defense procurement | National security requires unity |
| Foreign affairs | Treaties, diplomatic relations, trade negotiations | International standing |
| Currency and monetary policy | Federal Reserve, legal tender, banking regulation | Economic stability |
| Immigration and citizenship | Border control, naturalization, refugee policy | National sovereignty |
| Constitutional rights enforcement | Civil rights litigation, voting rights, equal protection | Uniform dignity |
| Interstate commerce regulation | Anti-trust, securities, consumer protection floors | Market unity |
| National benefits spine | Social Security, Medicare baseline, disability | Mobility without precarity |

### 2.2 Regional Exclusive Powers

The following powers are exclusively regional:

| Domain | Scope | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Transportation corridors | Interstate highways, rail, regional transit | Cross-state coordination |
| Housing supply coordination | Regional targets, anti-exclusion standards | Spillover effects of undersupply |
| Energy grid management | Generation planning, transmission, interconnection | Grid stability |
| Water systems | Watershed governance, allocation, quality | Hydrological boundaries |
| Regional labor standards | Minimum wage above federal floor, worker protections | Cost-of-living variation |
| Environmental coordination | Air quality, emissions trading, habitat corridors | Pollution crosses borders |
| Professional credentials | Licensing reciprocity, credential portability | Labor mobility |
| Public health coordination | Disease surveillance, hospital capacity planning | Epidemic response |

### 2.3 State Exclusive Powers

The following powers remain exclusively with States:

| Domain | Scope | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| Education policy | Curriculum, standards, school governance | Cultural variation |
| Criminal law | Offenses, sentencing, prosecution | Local legitimacy |
| Family law | Marriage, divorce, custody, inheritance | Cultural preferences |
| Civil procedure | Court rules, litigation procedures | State courts |
| Local government law | Municipal structure, annexation, home rule | State-local relationship |
| Land use frameworks | Zoning authority delegation, property law | Proximity |

### 2.4 Local Powers

Local governments retain:

- Zoning implementation within regional and state frameworks
- Service delivery (utilities, waste, local transit)
- Schools administration
- Local policing execution
- Community services and parks

---

## 3. Spillover Criteria and Measurement

### 3.1 Definition of Spillover

A "spillover" occurs when the exercise of a power in one jurisdiction:

- Imposes costs on residents of another jurisdiction who cannot vote on the decision
- Creates benefits that cannot be captured by the acting jurisdiction
- Produces effects that cross jurisdictional boundaries at a material scale

### 3.2 Spillover Thresholds

Spillovers trigger regional coordination requirements when:

| Metric | Threshold | Example |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| **Population affected** | >15% of affected population is outside acting jurisdiction | Housing policy affecting commuters |
| **Economic impact** | >$100M annual external impact (inflation-adjusted) | Industrial pollution affecting neighbors |
| **Geographic scope** | Effects extend >50 miles beyond jurisdiction | Air quality, watershed impacts |
| **Resource depletion** | Shared resource affected by >10% of sustainable yield | Aquifer drawdown, fishery depletion |
| **Infrastructure dependency** | >25% of system users are from other jurisdictions | Regional transit, grid interconnection |

### 3.3 Spillover Categories

**Category A - Mandatory Regional Authority**

When spillover thresholds are exceeded in:
- Energy grid operations
- Major transportation corridors
- Watershed management
- Air quality management

Regional authority is automatic and exclusive.

**Category B - Coordination Required**

When spillover thresholds are exceeded in:
- Housing supply
- Labor standards
- Public health
- Economic development

Regional coordination is required; States may exceed regional minimums.

**Category C - Compact Encouraged**

When spillover effects are present but below thresholds:
- Regional compacts are encouraged but not mandated
- States may act unilaterally with notice to affected jurisdictions

## 4. The Spillover Scoring Matrix

### 4.1 Purpose

The Spillover Scoring Matrix provides a standardized method for evaluating whether a policy area triggers regional authority.

### 4.2 Scoring Dimensions

| Dimension | Weight | Score Range |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Cross-border population impact | 25% | 0-100 |
| Economic externalities | 20% | 0-100 |
| Environmental scope | 20% | 0-100 |
| Infrastructure interdependence | 15% | 0-100 |
| Coordination benefits | 10% | 0-100 |
| Race-to-bottom risk | 10% | 0-100 |

### 4.3 Threshold Scores

| Total Score | Classification | Authority Level |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 0-29 | Local/State matter | State exclusive |
| 30-49 | Coordination beneficial | Compact encouraged |
| 50-69 | Coordination required | Regional minimum + State flexibility |
| 70-100 | Regional exclusive | Regional authority |

### 4.4 Worked Examples

**Example 1: Housing Supply in Metropolitan Area**

- Cross-border population impact: 85 (commuters affected across 3 states)
- Economic externalities: 70 (housing costs affect regional labor market)
- Environmental scope: 40 (land use has limited environmental spillover)
- Infrastructure interdependence: 60 (transit, utilities cross borders)
- Coordination benefits: 80 (regional planning prevents undersupply)
- Race-to-bottom risk: 75 (exclusionary zoning externalizes costs)

**Total: 69.5 → Regional coordination required**

**Example 2: K-12 Curriculum Standards**

- Cross-border population impact: 15 (few students cross state lines)
- Economic externalities: 25 (workforce effects are long-term, diffuse)
- Environmental scope: 0 (no environmental impact)
- Infrastructure interdependence: 10 (school facilities are local)
- Coordination benefits: 30 (some mobility benefits)
- Race-to-bottom risk: 20 (federal floors protect basics)

**Total: 17.5 → State exclusive**
