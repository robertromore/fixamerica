# Constitutional Transition Act

## A Safe, Orderly, and Legitimate Transition to Regional Federalism

> **Status:** Enabling Statute (Pre-Ratification, One-Time)
> **Nature:** Temporary, Non-Constitutional, Self-Terminating
> **Purpose:** To manage the *most dangerous moment* in constitutional change—the transition—by preventing ambiguity, power grabs, institutional collapse, or legitimacy shock while the new Regional Federal Constitution comes into force.

This Act exists for one reason only:

> **To ensure that the transition itself does not become the first constitutional crisis.**

## 1. Core Transition Principles

This Act is governed by six non-negotiable principles:

1. **Continuity over rupture**
2. **Restoration over innovation**
3. **No expansion of power during transition**
4. **No permanent institutions created by transition**
5. **Transparency over discretion**
6. **Automatic termination once complete**

The transition is not a governing opportunity.
It is a containment exercise.

## 2. Legal Authority and Relationship to the Constitution

### Section 2.1 — Enabling Authority

This Act is enacted pursuant to:

- existing constitutional legislative authority,
- and conditional upon ratification of the Regional Federal Constitution.

### Section 2.2 — Constitutional Authorization

This Act operates pursuant to Article XV, Section 2 of the Regional Federal Constitution, which authorizes phased activation of operational provisions during transition.

During the transition period:

- this Act governs sequencing and continuity for operational provisions,
- the prior Constitution remains operative for matters not yet transitioned,
- immediate provisions identified in Article XV, Section 3 take effect upon ratification and are not subject to phased activation.

Any conflict between this Act and the Regional Federal Constitution shall be resolved in favor of the Constitution. This Act does not claim supremacy over constitutional provisions.

---

## 3. Phase-Based Transition Framework

Transition proceeds through **five sequential phases**.
No phase may overlap. No phase may be skipped.

---

### Phase I — Ratification & Lock-In (0–6 Months)

**Purpose:** Secure legitimacy and prevent improvisation.

- Ratification certified pursuant to existing law
- Transition clock begins upon certification
- All institutions continue under prior Constitution
- Public publication of full transition schedule
- Oath of non-expansion sworn by all federal officials

**Prohibition:**
No new powers may be claimed under the new Constitution in this phase.

---

### Phase II — Regional Formation (6–18 Months)

**Purpose:** Operationalize constitutionally established regions without disrupting governance.

- Regions are established by Schedule A of the Regional Federal Constitution upon ratification
- This Act provides operational procedures for activating regional governance
- Provisional regional assemblies formed from existing state delegations
- Regions draft constitutions under federal rights floors
- No new regional laws take effect yet
- Regions may only plan, staff, and organize

**Key rule:**
Regions exist *administratively* before they exist *politically*.

---

### Phase III — Institutional Reconfiguration (18–30 Months)

**Purpose:** Transition national institutions safely.

- Senate reconstituted to regional representation
- House districts adjusted if required
- Federal executive scope narrowed per new Constitution
- Regional courts established
- Mandatory jurisdiction provisions activated

All prior officeholders retain their positions unless explicitly redefined.

---

### Phase IV — First Regional Elections (30–42 Months)

**Purpose:** Democratic legitimacy at the new level.

- Regions conduct first elections under uniform standards
- States continue normal governance
- Federal elections proceed as scheduled
- Caretaker rules apply if disputes arise

No region exercises full constitutional authority until elections conclude.

---

### Phase V — Full Activation & Termination (42–48 Months)

**Purpose:** Complete handoff and dissolve transition structures.

- Regional constitutions take effect
- Full allocation of powers activated
- Transition Act sunsets automatically
- Transitional bodies dissolve by law
- All residual authority reverts to constitutional order

No extensions permitted.

---

## 4. Institutional Continuity Guarantees

To prevent collapse or panic:

- All courts remain seated
- All laws remain in force unless explicitly superseded
- All contracts remain valid
- All civil servants retain status and protections
- All benefits continue uninterrupted

There is no "legal reset."

---

## 5. Power Freeze and Non-Expansion Rules

### Section 5.1 — Non-Expansion Clause

During transition:

- no branch may expand authority,
- no new emergency powers may be claimed,
- no reinterpretation increasing discretion is valid.

### Section 5.2 — Automatic Nullification

Any action that expands authority during transition is:

- void ab initio,
- unenforceable,
- subject to expedited judicial review.

---

## 6. Regional Formation and Provisional Governance

### Section 6.1 — Provisional Status

Provisional regional bodies:

- may plan,
- may hire staff,
- may draft frameworks,
- may not legislate or regulate.

### Section 6.2 — Democratic Requirement

No region may exercise constitutional authority without:

- an adopted regional constitution,
- democratically elected leadership,
- certified elections.

---

## 7. Legislative Reconfiguration

### Section 7.1 — Senate Transition

- Existing Senators serve until regional selection mechanisms activate
- No Senate action invalidated solely due to transition status
- Senate powers remain unchanged until Phase III completion

### Section 7.2 — House Stability

- House composition unchanged unless constitutionally required
- No redistricting under new regional logic until after Phase IV elections

---

## 8. Executive Authority During Transition

### Section 8.1 — Executive Continuity

The President retains office and authority under the prior Constitution until Phase III.

### Section 8.2 — Scope Lock

Executive authority may narrow as phases progress, but may not expand.

### Section 8.3 — Emergency Limits

No emergency declaration may:

- exceed prior constitutional limits,
- invoke new constitutional authority early,
- delay transition timelines.

---

## 9. Judicial Continuity and Early Enforcement

### Section 9.1 — Courts Remain Operational

All courts continue uninterrupted.

### Section 9.2 — Early Activation of Safeguards

The following activate in Phase III:

- mandatory jurisdiction
- time-bound adjudication
- self-executing defaults (limited to transition disputes)

Courts may not delay transition milestones.

### Section 9.3 — Regional Court Capacity and Staffing

Mandatory jurisdiction without adequate court capacity creates delay failure. The following provisions ensure courts can meet constitutional obligations:

**Funding:**

- Federal appropriation for provisional regional court operations shall be included in Phase II and Phase III budgets
- Appropriation shall cover: judicial salaries, clerk staff, facilities, and case management systems
- Minimum funding level: sufficient to process projected caseload within mandatory timelines

**Staffing:**

- Regional courts shall have minimum staffing targets defined by the Transitional Legitimacy Council
- Targets shall include: judges, magistrates, clerks, administrative staff, and court security
- Staffing plans must be submitted and approved before Phase III begins

**Temporary Assignment:**

- Federal judges may be temporarily assigned to regional courts during Phases III and IV
- Assignment is voluntary for judges but compensated at current salary plus regional differential
- Assigned judges retain federal status and return to federal courts at Phase V

**Capacity Monitoring:**

- The GAO shall monitor regional court capacity and report to Congress quarterly during the transition period
- Reports shall identify capacity shortfalls and recommend corrective actions
- Capacity monitoring is informational only and does not condition mandatory jurisdiction activation
- Mandatory jurisdiction activates upon ratification pursuant to Article XI, Section 1 and Article XV, Section 3; capacity constraints do not delay constitutional obligations

**Contingency:**

- If court capacity cannot be achieved, expedited dispute resolution may be handled by:
    - temporary special masters appointed by the Chief Justice
    - binding arbitration panels with judicial oversight
- These contingencies expire automatically at Phase V

---

## 10. Elections During Transition

### Section 10.1 — Election Stability

- Existing election rules remain in force
- No election laws may change mid-cycle
- No jurisdiction may experiment early

### Section 10.2 — Dispute Handling

Election disputes are:

- expedited,
- procedurally enforced,
- resolved before phase progression.

---

## 11. Armed Forces and Security Continuity

### Section 11.1 — Command Continuity

- Military command remains unchanged
- No reorganization during transition
- No domestic deployment authority expanded

### Section 11.2 — Guard Formation

Regional Guard Forces:

- may be planned and staffed,
- may not deploy until full activation.

---

## 12. Fiscal and Administrative Continuity

### Section 12.1 — Budget Stability

- All budgets continue
- No new taxing authority until activation
- Equalization formulas begin modeling only

### Section 12.2 — Administrative Transfer

Staff and agencies transfer gradually with no forced relocations.

---

## 13. Transitional Legitimacy Council

### Section 13.1 — Composition

- One representative per region (provisional)
- Federal legislative observers
- Judicial liaison
- Civil society observers

### Section 13.2 — Powers

- publish reports
- flag deviations
- request judicial review

### Section 13.3 — Explicit Limits

- no veto
- no enforcement
- no policymaking

Council dissolves automatically at Phase V.

---

## 14. Dispute Resolution and Fast-Track Review

All transition disputes:

- receive mandatory jurisdiction,
- are resolved within 30 days,
- default to restoration of prior authority if unresolved.

Delay does not halt transition.

---

## 15. Public Transparency and Civic Legitimacy

### Requirements

- public dashboards tracking milestones
- plain-language explanations
- regular joint briefings

Opacity is treated as a transition failure.

---

## 16. Sunset, Termination, and Automatic Expiry

This Act:

- expires automatically at Phase V completion,
- cannot be extended,
- cannot be amended after Phase I begins.

Any attempt to prolong it is void.

---

## 17. Why This Act Must Not Be Constitutionalized

Because:

- transitions are temporary,
- rigidity invites abuse,
- future circumstances will differ.

This Act is scaffolding—not structure.

---

## 18. Final Statement of Intent

This Act exists to ensure that:

- no one governs by surprise,
- no one expands power by necessity,
- no institution collapses from uncertainty,
- and no citizen is asked to trust improvisation.

> **The Constitution governs the destination.
> This Act governs the crossing.**

Upon completion, it disappears.

That is its success condition.
