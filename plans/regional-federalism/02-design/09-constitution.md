# The Regional Federal Constitution of the United States

## A Comprehensive Amendment Package and Official Commentary

---

## Preamble

We, the People of the United States, in order to preserve the Union, restore democratic legitimacy, secure liberty against concentration of power, and ensure that self-government remains possible in a large and diverse republic, do hereby amend the Constitution to establish a system of **Regional Federalism**.

This amendment package is adopted to:

- align governance with modern economic and social reality,
- reduce existential political conflict,
- prevent authoritarian consolidation,
- preserve national unity without coercive uniformity,
- and ensure that no single institution may dominate the constitutional order.

The following Articles shall have full constitutional force.

---

# ARTICLE I - REGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES

### Section 1. Establishment of Regions

The United States shall be composed of multiple **Regions**, each consisting of a grouping of States, established by this Constitution and alterable only by constitutional amendment.

Regions are permanent constitutional entities and are not administrative subdivisions of the federal government.

---

### Section 2. Legal Status

Regions possess inherent governing authority within their enumerated powers, derived from the People of the Region and recognized by this Constitution.

No Region is sovereign. Sovereignty resides in the People of the United States.

---

### Section 3. Regional Constitutions

Each Region shall adopt a republican constitution consistent with:

- this Constitution,
- federal rights floors,
- democratic process guarantees.

Regional constitutions shall provide for:

- universal suffrage,
- independent redistricting processes,
- proportionality and competitiveness standards for elections,
- explicit protection against domination by any single metropolitan area or rural bloc.

The structural form of regional government (unicameral or bicameral legislature, electoral system) shall be determined by each Region, subject to the foregoing requirements.

---

### Section 4. Regional Boundary Revision

Regional boundaries may be revised without full constitutional amendment through the following process:

(a) An Independent Boundary Review Commission shall be established by Congress and shall review regional boundaries every twenty years following each decennial census.

(b) The Commission shall recommend boundary adjustments based on criteria established by statute, which may include population balance, economic coherence, infrastructure alignment, and geographic considerations.

(c) Boundary revisions require:

- approval by two-thirds of the legislature of each affected Region,
- approval by national popular referendum.

(d) No boundary revision may be proposed, voted upon, or take effect within one year before or six months after a federal presidential election.

(e) Criteria for boundary revision shall be defined by statute and may be updated by Congress. The Constitution establishes only the process and consent thresholds.

(b) Within five years of ratification, Congress shall by statute either:

- admit the District as a State and assign it to a Region, or
- assign the District to a Region for purposes of regional governance while preserving its unique federal district status.

(c) Until such determination:

- For regional governance matters: the District is not subject to regional authority until Congress makes a determination under subsection (b).

(d) Tribal Nations may, at their option, designate representatives to participate in regional assemblies. The nature of such participation (voting, non-voting, observer) shall be determined by agreement between each Tribal Nation and the relevant Region.

(e) Nothing in this Constitution diminishes any treaty rights, trust responsibilities, or obligations of the United States to Tribal Nations.

---

# ARTICLE XVII - IMPLEMENTATION AND DEFAULT RULES

### Section 1. Congressional Implementation Duty

Congress shall enact enabling legislation to implement this Constitution, including but not limited to:

- an Allocation Framework Act defining jurisdictional boundaries and spillover criteria,
- a Fiscal Equalization Act establishing transfer formulas and the Independent Fiscal Council,
- an Elections Implementation Act specifying procedures for federal elections under regional administration.

---

### Section 2. Default Rules Upon Congressional Failure

(a) If Congress fails to enact the Allocation Framework Act within two years of ratification, the allocation of powers shall be governed by existing federal-state divisions, with Regions exercising authority over matters previously requiring interstate compacts.

(b) If Congress fails to enact the Fiscal Equalization Act within three years of ratification, equalization transfers shall be calculated as flat per-capita grants at a baseline level equal to five percent of federal revenues, distributed to Regions with below-median fiscal capacity. This default rate shall decline by one percentage point per year beginning in year six, reaching a floor of two percent, to incentivize congressional action rather than reward inaction.

(c) If Congress fails to enact the Elections Implementation Act within two years of ratification, the following default rules apply:

- The national popular vote requirement of Article VI, Section 2 remains in full force.
- Administrative procedures (voter registration, ballot design, counting methods) shall follow prior federal law as adapted for regional administration.
- Regions assume the administrative role previously held by States.
- Any provisions of prior federal law inconsistent with the national popular vote requirement (including the Electoral College) are superseded and inapplicable.
- If no candidate receives a majority of votes cast, a runoff election between the two candidates receiving the most votes shall be held within twenty-one days. If Congress has enacted a different majority mechanism (such as ranked-choice voting or instant runoff), that mechanism supersedes this default.

(d) If Congress fails to enact appropriations for any fiscal year by the start of that fiscal year, the following automatic fiscal continuation shall apply:

- Spending shall continue at the prior fiscal year's enacted levels for all previously authorized programs.
- Prior-year levels shall be adjusted by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or by a successor index designated by statute.
- No new programs, expansions of existing programs, or new spending initiatives may be funded under automatic continuation.
- Automatic continuation terminates upon enactment of appropriations for the affected fiscal year.

(e) Default rules remain in effect until Congress enacts superseding legislation.

---

### Section 3. Purpose

These default rules exist to prevent deliberate nonimplementation from becoming a method of constitutional sabotage. The Constitution shall operate even if Congress fails to act.

---

# OFFICIAL COMMENTARY (NON-BINDING)

## Purpose

This Constitution is designed not for consensus, but for survival.

It assumes:

- polarization,
- bad faith,
- institutional stress,
- and periodic crisis.

It rejects:

- exit politics,
- domination through centralization,
- governance by emergency,
- judicial policymaking,
- and militarized politics.

---

## Core Design Philosophy

1. **Distribute power**
2. **Lower existential stakes**
3. **Preserve real self-government**
4. **Make abuse slow, visible, and reversible**
5. **Prefer restoration over punishment**

---

## Interpretive Directive

Where ambiguity exists, interpreters shall prefer:

- decentralization over concentration,
- process enforcement over outcome imposition,
- restoration over escalation,
- democratic legitimacy over efficiency.

---

## Final Statement

This Constitution does not promise harmony.

It promises something more realistic:

> **That disagreement will not destroy the Republic.**
