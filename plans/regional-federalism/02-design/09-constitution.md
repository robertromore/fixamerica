# The Regional Federal Constitution of the United States

## A Comprehensive Amendment Package and Official Commentary

---

## Preamble

We, the People of the United States, in order to preserve the Union, restore democratic legitimacy, secure liberty against concentration of power, and ensure that self-government remains possible in a large and diverse republic, do hereby amend the Constitution to establish a system of **Regional Federalism**.

This amendment package is adopted to:

- align governance with modern economic and social reality,
- reduce existential political conflict,
- prevent authoritarian consolidation,
- preserve national unity without coercive uniformity,
- and ensure that no single institution may dominate the constitutional order.

The following Articles shall have full constitutional force.

---

# ARTICLE I - REGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES

### Section 1. Establishment of Regions

The United States shall be composed of multiple **Regions**, each consisting of a grouping of States, established by this Constitution and alterable only by constitutional amendment.

Regions are permanent constitutional entities and are not administrative subdivisions of the federal government.

---

### Section 2. Legal Status

Regions possess inherent governing authority within their enumerated powers, derived from the People of the Region and recognized by this Constitution.

No Region is sovereign. Sovereignty resides in the People of the United States.

---

### Section 3. Regional Constitutions

Each Region shall adopt a republican constitution consistent with:

- this Constitution,
- federal rights floors,
- democratic process guarantees.

Regional constitutions shall provide for:

- universal suffrage,
- independent redistricting processes,
- proportionality and competitiveness standards for elections,
- explicit protection against domination by any single metropolitan area or rural bloc.

The structural form of regional government (unicameral or bicameral legislature, electoral system) shall be determined by each Region, subject to the foregoing requirements.

---

### Section 4. Regional Boundary Revision

Regional boundaries may be revised without full constitutional amendment through the following process:

(a) An Independent Boundary Review Commission shall be established by Congress and shall review regional boundaries every twenty years following each decennial census.

(b) Commission Structure. The Commission shall consist of:

- nine members: three appointed by the President, three by the Senate (with bipartisan selection), and three by a majority vote of Regional Governors,
- members serving single six-year terms, removable only for cause,
- an independent budget appropriated as mandatory spending.

If Congress fails to establish the Commission within two years of this Constitution's ratification, the Comptroller General shall convene an interim Commission using retired federal judges and nonpartisan demographers until Congress acts.

(c) The Commission shall recommend boundary adjustments based on criteria established by statute, which may include population balance, economic coherence, infrastructure alignment, and geographic considerations.

(d) Congressional Action Deadline. Within eighteen months of receiving Commission recommendations, Congress shall schedule a national referendum on any proposed boundary revision. If Congress fails to act within this period, the Commission may directly submit its recommendations to the national referendum process.

(e) Boundary revisions require:

- approval by two-thirds of the legislature of each affected Region,
- approval by national popular referendum.

(f) Referendum Failure. If a proposed boundary revision fails to achieve the required approvals:

- the Commission shall issue a public report analyzing the reasons for failure within sixty days,
- no substantially similar proposal may be submitted for referendum within four years,
- the Commission may propose alternative revisions addressing identified concerns in the next review cycle.

(g) No boundary revision may be proposed, voted upon, or take effect within one year before or six months after a federal presidential election.

(h) Criteria for boundary revision shall be defined by statute and may be updated by Congress. The Constitution establishes only the process and consent thresholds.

---

### Section 5. Inter-Regional Cooperation

(a) Two or more Regions may enter into agreements for cooperative action on any matter within their respective powers.

(b) Such agreements require no federal approval unless they:

- affect federal enumerated powers,
- create binding obligations on non-participating Regions,
- or conflict with federal law enacted pursuant to enumerated powers.

(c) Regions may establish joint institutions, shared programs, cooperative purchasing arrangements, and coordinated policy frameworks.

(d) Inter-regional agreements shall specify:

- governance structure and decision-making procedures,
- cost-sharing and fiscal responsibilities,

- withdrawal procedures and transition provisions.

(e) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize Regions to jointly exercise powers reserved to the federal government or to create obligations binding on the United States.

---

### Section 6. Right of Transit and Non-Blockade

(a) No Region may deny, obstruct, or unreasonably condition access to transportation infrastructure, energy transmission systems, or communication networks that connect other Regions to each other or to external markets.

(b) All Regions shall have the right of transit through other Regions for goods, persons, and services on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.

(c) Infrastructure user fees, tolls, and charges imposed on transit traffic shall be:

- non-discriminatory (no higher than fees for comparable intra-Regional traffic),
- cost-based (related to actual infrastructure costs),
- transparent (published and applied uniformly).

(d) A Region that believes its right of transit is being violated may seek:

- expedited mediation through the Allocation Review Board (14 days),
- injunctive relief from Regional Courts (with federal backup jurisdiction),
- federal enforcement of access under the national common market power.

(e) In cases of imminent or ongoing blockade, the federal government may:

- order immediate restoration of access pending dispute resolution,
- impose sanctions on the offending Region, including withholding of equalization transfers,

(f) This section does not require Regions to build new infrastructure, only to maintain reasonable access to existing infrastructure connecting other Regions.

---

### Section 7. Water Rights and Shared Waterways

(a) Interstate rivers, lakes, aquifers, and watersheds that cross or border Regional boundaries are shared resources of all affected Regions and the United States.

(b) No Region may unilaterally:

- divert, dam, or appropriate water in a manner that substantially diminishes the quantity or quality of water available to downstream or adjacent Regions,
- discharge pollutants that render water unusable by other Regions,
- destroy wetlands, flood plains, or natural water management systems upon which other Regions depend.

(c) Water allocation among Regions shall be governed by principles of equitable apportionment, considering:

- historical usage patterns,
- population and reasonable projected needs,
- environmental sustainability requirements,
- economic dependency,
- efficiency of use,
- availability of alternative sources.

(d) Congress shall establish a Water Resources Coordination Board to:

- monitor shared water resources,
- provide technical assessments and projections,
- facilitate negotiation of water-sharing agreements,
- recommend equitable allocations when Regions cannot agree.

(e) A Region that believes its water rights are being violated may seek:

- expedited mediation through the Water Resources Coordination Board (21 days),
- adjudication by the National Water Court (a specialized tribunal within the federal judiciary),
- emergency injunctive relief to prevent irreversible harm.

(f) In cases of ongoing or imminent harm to shared water resources, the federal government may:

- order immediate cessation of harmful activities pending dispute resolution,
- impose sanctions on the offending Region, including withholding of equalization transfers,
- implement emergency conservation measures,
- assume temporary operational control of water infrastructure causing harm.

(g) Existing interstate water compacts shall remain in force unless superseded by Regional agreement or federal law enacted pursuant to this section.

(f) This section supplements, and does not displace, federal environmental laws establishing national minimum standards.

(g) Nothing in this section shall prevent Regions, States, Territories, or federally recognized Tribal Nations from establishing environmental standards more protective than federal floors, provided such standards do not discriminate against interstate commerce.

---

### Section 11. Cross-Jurisdictional Law Enforcement Cooperation

(a) Extradition. A person charged with a crime in one Region, State, Territory, or federally recognized Tribal Nation who flees to another jurisdiction shall, upon demand of the executive authority of the jurisdiction from which they fled, be delivered to the jurisdiction having jurisdiction over the crime.

- there is substantial evidence that the person will face persecution unrelated to the alleged crime,
- the alleged conduct is not criminal in the receiving jurisdiction and does not involve violence, fraud, or harm to minors.

(d) Extradition proceedings shall be completed within sixty days of demand. Failure to complete proceedings within this period shall result in automatic transfer of custody to federal authorities for extradition.

- facilitating witness testimony across jurisdictional boundaries.

(g) Information Sharing. Congress shall establish secure systems for sharing law enforcement information across jurisdictional boundaries, subject to privacy protections and oversight.

(h) No Safe Harbors. No Region, State, Territory, or federally recognized Tribal Nation may adopt policies designed to shield individuals from lawful prosecution in other jurisdictions for crimes of violence, fraud, or harm to minors.

(i) Nothing in this section shall require Regions, States, Territories, or federally recognized Tribal Nations to cooperate in enforcement of laws that would violate federal rights floors or to participate in enforcement actions that the receiving jurisdiction determines are pretextual or politically motivated.

(j) Disputes regarding cross-jurisdictional law enforcement cooperation shall be resolved by federal courts with expedited review (fourteen days).

(k) Nothing in this section shall be construed to diminish the sovereign authority of federally recognized Tribal Nations over criminal matters within their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided by treaty or federal law.

(a) If courts fail to act within the time limits specified in Section 2 (including any extensions), the following default rules shall apply automatically:

(b) Allocation Disputes (Article II). If a court fails to rule on whether a matter falls within federal or regional authority:

- the challenged action is stayed pending resolution,
- if the trial court misses its deadline, the matter automatically transfers to a three-judge panel from an adjacent Region,
- if no ruling is issued within sixty days, the allocation claimed by the challenging party is presumed correct until reversed on appeal.

- the emergency declaration expires automatically at the original time limit without renewal,
- measures taken under the expired emergency are void and unenforceable,
- affected parties may seek damages directly from the responsible officials.

(d) Election Disputes (Article VI). Default rules for election disputes are specified in Article VI, Section 4(g).

- deployment authority expires automatically at the end of the initial thirty-day period,
- no reauthorization may be issued until the court rules,
- forces must withdraw to garrison within forty-eight hours of expiration.

(g) Enforcement. Any party may invoke these defaults by filing a notice of default with the court clerk. The clerk shall issue a certificate of default within twenty-four hours if the deadline has passed. Default certificates are self-executing and require no further judicial action.

---

- temporary assignment of federal judges to regional courts,
- appointment of special masters for overflow cases,

---

### Section 6. Term Limits

(a) Justices of the Supreme Court shall serve a single term of eighteen years.

---

### Section 2. Two-Key Authorization

(a) Domestic deployment of armed force requires authorization by two independent civilian authorities:

- Key 1: The President of the United States.
- Key 2: A supermajority of Regional Governors (two-thirds of all Regional Governors).

(b) If the President is a party to the constitutional crisis necessitating domestic deployment, the authorization keys shall be:

- Key 1: The Chief Justice of the United States (procedural certification only, not policy approval).
- Key 2: A supermajority of Regional Governors.

(c) Each keyholder must act within forty-eight hours of a formal request. If any keyholder fails to act within this period, authority to authorize lapses and a new request must be initiated.

(d) All authorizations must be in writing, must specify the scope, duration, and geographic limits of deployment, and must be made public within seventy-two hours.

(e) Domestic deployment authority expires automatically after thirty days unless reauthorized through the same two-key process.

(f) Governor Non-Response Fallback. If fewer than two-thirds of Regional Governors respond within forty-eight hours:

- a Governor who fails to respond is deemed to have abstained, not to have vetoed,
- the two-thirds supermajority shall be calculated based on responding Governors only, provided that at least one-half of all Governors respond,
- if fewer than one-half of Governors respond, the request fails and a new request must be initiated with extended notice.

(g) Legislative Override. If Key 2 fails due to Governor refusal (not non-response):

- the President may request authorization from Regional legislatures instead,
- authorization requires approval by a majority of Regional legislatures, each voting by majority of members present,
- Regional legislatures must complete voting within seventy-two hours of the request,
- this override is available only for deployment requests that specify a limited geographic scope (no more than three Regions) and duration (no more than fourteen days).

(h) Judicial Emergency Certificate. In cases of imminent constitutional emergency where both Governors and legislatures are unavailable or obstructed:

- the Chief Justice may issue an Emergency Authorization Certificate permitting deployment for up to seventy-two hours,
- such certificate requires written findings that: (i) an imminent threat to constitutional order exists, (ii) normal authorization channels are unavailable, and (iii) deployment is the minimum necessary response,
- deployment under such certificate may not be renewed; full two-key authorization must be obtained for any continuation,
- the certificate must be published immediately upon issuance.

# ARTICLE XIII - CYBER DEFENSE AND DIGITAL SECURITY

### Section 1. Constitutional Domain

The cyber domain presents distinct constitutional risks that require explicit treatment separate from kinetic armed force:

- Nation-state cyber attacks can disrupt elections, sabotage infrastructure, and undermine democratic processes.
- Unlike traditional threats, cyber attacks cross borders instantly, exploit civilian systems, and blur the distinction between war and peace.
- Cyber capabilities can enable domestic authoritarianism through surveillance, political targeting, and information manipulation.

This Article establishes allocation of authority, protective thresholds, and prohibitions to address these risks.

---

### Section 2. Allocation of Cyber Defense Authority

(a) Cyber defense shall be allocated as follows:

- Federal Armed Forces: defense against nation-state cyber adversaries, protection of federal systems, intelligence gathering on foreign threats, and coordination with international allies.
- Regional Guard Forces: protection of regional critical infrastructure including election systems, and coordination of incident response across member states.
- States and private sector: protection of state systems and private infrastructure, with mandatory reporting of breaches affecting public safety.

(b) Federal cyber forces are part of the Federal Armed Forces and subject to the civilian control requirements of Article XII.

(c) Regional cyber units are part of Regional Guard Forces.

---

### Section 3. Critical Infrastructure

(a) Critical infrastructure includes electrical grids, water and wastewater systems, financial networks, healthcare systems, transportation networks, and communications infrastructure.

(b) Protection responsibilities are allocated by:

- Scale of impact: National systems are federal responsibility; regional systems are regional responsibility.
- Ownership: Private operators bear primary responsibility for their own systems, with government oversight.
- Spillover effects: Infrastructure crossing regional boundaries requires federal coordination.

---

### Section 4. Incident Response Thresholds

(a) Cyber incidents rising to the level of armed attack are subject to the two-key authorization requirement of Article XII, Section 2.

(b) Such incidents trigger emergency powers under Article XIV, subject to the same time limits and restoration mandates.

(c) Routine cyber defense operations-including monitoring, patching, and incident response-do not require two-key authorization and operate under normal administrative authority.

---

### Section 5. Digital Rights and Prohibitions

(a) The federal government shall not conduct domestic surveillance without judicial authorization.

(b) No government at any level may use cyber capabilities against lawful political activity.

(c) The federal government shall not assume control of regional election infrastructure except as provided in Article VI.

(d) These prohibitions apply equally to direct action and to procurement of such action from private parties or foreign entities.

(e) Intelligence Oversight and Accountability.

(1) All frameworks, agreements, or understandings with foreign governments or entities concerning intelligence activities affecting persons within the United States shall be reported to a designated congressional oversight committee within thirty days of execution. Operational details may be omitted; the existence and scope of such arrangements may not be.

(2) Any person with knowledge of violations of this section may report such violations through classified channels to the Inspector General for Intelligence or to the congressional intelligence committees.

# ARTICLE XVII - NON-STATE ENTITIES

### Section 1. District of Columbia

(a) The District of Columbia shall be entitled to representation in Congress as if it were a State, with Representatives in the House apportioned by population and Senators as determined by statute. This representation is immediate upon ratification and does not depend on regional assignment.

(b) Within five years of ratification, Congress shall by statute either:

- admit the District as a State and assign it to a Region, or
- assign the District to a Region for purposes of regional governance while preserving its unique federal district status.

(c) Regional assignment of the District shall require:

- approval by a two-thirds vote of the receiving Region's legislature, and
- approval by a majority of District residents voting in a referendum on the assignment.

No assignment may be enacted, amended, or take effect within one year before or six months after a federal presidential election.

(d) Until such determination:

- For presidential elections: residents of the District shall vote as part of the national popular vote; their votes are counted nationally, not assigned to any Region.
- For congressional elections: the District elects its own Representatives and Senators as provided in subsection (a).
- For regional governance matters: the District is not subject to regional authority until Congress makes a determination under subsection (b).

---

### Section 2. Territories

(a) Residents of United States territories shall be entitled to participate in federal elections. Congress shall by statute assign each territory to a Region for purposes of such participation.

(b) Regional assignment of territories shall be governed by the following constraints:

(1) Assignment must be based on geographic proximity, historical connection, or economic integration. No territory may be assigned to a Region with which it shares no such connection.

(3) No territory assignment may be enacted, amended, or take effect within one year before or six months after a federal presidential election.

(4) The territory's residents shall have the opportunity to approve or reject regional assignment by referendum. Rejection does not prevent federal election participation but delays regional governance integration until a subsequent assignment is approved.

(c) Congress shall by statute establish a clear path for each territory to:

- petition for statehood and subsequent regional assignment,
- petition for regional assignment without statehood,
- or continue territorial status with defined representation rights.

(d) No territory may be held indefinitely without a defined governance status. Congress shall act on any territorial petition within five years.

---

### Section 3. Tribal Nations

(c) Regions and Tribal Nations shall enter into compacts for coordination of shared services, infrastructure, and emergency response. Such compacts shall be negotiated in good faith and shall respect tribal sovereignty.

(d) Tribal Nations may, at their option, designate representatives to participate in regional assemblies. The nature of such participation (voting, non-voting, observer) shall be determined by agreement between each Tribal Nation and the relevant Region.

(e) Nothing in this Constitution diminishes any treaty rights, trust responsibilities, or obligations of the United States to Tribal Nations.

---

# ARTICLE XVIII - IMPLEMENTATION AND DEFAULT RULES

### Section 1. Congressional Implementation Duty

Congress shall enact enabling legislation to implement this Constitution, including but not limited to:

- an Allocation Framework Act defining jurisdictional boundaries and spillover criteria,
- a Fiscal Equalization Act establishing transfer formulas and the Independent Fiscal Council,
- an Elections Implementation Act specifying procedures for federal elections under regional administration.

---

### Section 2. Default Rules Upon Congressional Failure

(a) If Congress fails to enact the Allocation Framework Act within two years of ratification, the allocation of powers shall be governed by existing federal-state divisions, with Regions exercising authority over matters previously requiring interstate compacts.

(b) If Congress fails to enact the Fiscal Equalization Act within three years of ratification, equalization transfers shall be calculated as flat per-capita grants at a baseline level equal to five percent of federal revenues, distributed to Regions with below-median fiscal capacity. This default rate shall decline by one percentage point per year beginning in year six, reaching a floor of two percent, to incentivize congressional action rather than reward inaction.

(c) If Congress fails to enact the Elections Implementation Act within two years of ratification, the following default rules apply:

- The national popular vote requirement of Article VI, Section 2 remains in full force.
- Administrative procedures (voter registration, ballot design, counting methods) shall follow prior federal law as adapted for regional administration.
- Regions assume the administrative role previously held by States.
- Any provisions of prior federal law inconsistent with the national popular vote requirement (including the Electoral College) are superseded and inapplicable.
- If no candidate receives a majority of votes cast, a runoff election between the two candidates receiving the most votes shall be held within twenty-one days. If Congress has enacted a different majority mechanism (such as ranked-choice voting or instant runoff), that mechanism supersedes this default.

(d) If Congress fails to enact appropriations for any fiscal year by the start of that fiscal year, the following automatic fiscal continuation shall apply:

- Spending shall continue at the prior fiscal year's enacted levels for all previously authorized programs.
- Prior-year levels shall be adjusted by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or by a successor index designated by statute.
- No new programs, expansions of existing programs, or new spending initiatives may be funded under automatic continuation.
- Automatic continuation terminates upon enactment of appropriations for the affected fiscal year.

(e) Default rules remain in effect until Congress enacts superseding legislation.

---

### Section 3. Purpose

These default rules exist to prevent deliberate nonimplementation from becoming a method of constitutional sabotage. The Constitution shall operate even if Congress fails to act.

# OFFICIAL COMMENTARY (NON-BINDING)

## Purpose

This Constitution is designed not for consensus, but for survival.

It assumes:

- polarization,
- bad faith,
- institutional stress,
- and periodic crisis.

It rejects:

- exit politics,
- domination through centralization,
- governance by emergency,
- judicial policymaking,
- and militarized politics.

---

## Core Design Philosophy

1. **Distribute power**
2. **Lower existential stakes**
3. **Preserve real self-government**
4. **Make abuse slow, visible, and reversible**
5. **Prefer restoration over punishment**

---

## Interpretive Directive

Where ambiguity exists, interpreters shall prefer:

- decentralization over concentration,
- process enforcement over outcome imposition,
- restoration over escalation,
- democratic legitimacy over efficiency.

---

## Final Statement

This Constitution does not promise harmony.

It promises something more realistic:

> **That disagreement will not destroy the Republic.**
