# The Regional Federal Constitution of the United States

## A Comprehensive Amendment Package and Official Commentary

---

## Preamble

We, the People of the United States, in order to preserve the Union, restore democratic legitimacy, secure liberty against concentration of power, and ensure that self-government remains possible in a large and diverse republic, do hereby amend the Constitution to establish a system of **Regional Federalism**.

This amendment package is adopted to:

- align governance with modern economic and social reality,
- reduce existential political conflict,
- prevent authoritarian consolidation,
- preserve national unity without coercive uniformity,
- and ensure that no single institution may dominate the constitutional order.

The following Articles shall have full constitutional force.

---

# ARTICLE I - REGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES

### Section 1. Establishment of Regions

The United States shall be composed of multiple **Regions**, each consisting of a grouping of States, established by this Constitution and alterable only by constitutional amendment.

Regions are permanent constitutional entities and are not administrative subdivisions of the federal government.

---

### Section 2. Legal Status

Regions possess inherent governing authority within their enumerated powers, derived from the People of the Region and recognized by this Constitution.

No Region is sovereign. Sovereignty resides in the People of the United States.

---

### Section 3. Regional Constitutions

Each Region shall adopt a republican constitution consistent with:

- this Constitution,
- federal rights floors,
- democratic process guarantees.

Regional constitutions shall provide for:

- universal suffrage,
- independent redistricting processes,
- proportionality and competitiveness standards for elections,
- explicit protection against domination by any single metropolitan area or rural bloc.

The structural form of regional government (unicameral or bicameral legislature, electoral system) shall be determined by each Region, subject to the foregoing requirements.

---

### Section 4. Regional Boundary Revision

Regional boundaries may be revised without full constitutional amendment through the following process:

(a) An Independent Boundary Review Commission shall be established by Congress and shall review regional boundaries every twenty years following each decennial census.

(b) The Commission shall recommend boundary adjustments based on criteria established by statute, which may include population balance, economic coherence, infrastructure alignment, and geographic considerations.

(c) Boundary revisions require:

- approval by two-thirds of the legislature of each affected Region,
- approval by national popular referendum.

(d) No boundary revision may be proposed, voted upon, or take effect within one year before or six months after a federal presidential election.

(e) Criteria for boundary revision shall be defined by statute and may be updated by Congress. The Constitution establishes only the process and consent thresholds.

---

### Section 5. Inter-Regional Cooperation

(a) Two or more Regions may enter into agreements for cooperative action on any matter within their respective powers.

(b) Such agreements require no federal approval unless they:

- affect federal enumerated powers,
- create binding obligations on non-participating Regions,
- or conflict with federal law enacted pursuant to enumerated powers.

(c) Regions may establish joint institutions, shared programs, cooperative purchasing arrangements, and coordinated policy frameworks.

(d) Inter-regional agreements shall specify:

- governance structure and decision-making procedures,
- cost-sharing and fiscal responsibilities,
- dispute resolution mechanisms,
- withdrawal procedures and transition provisions.

(e) Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize Regions to jointly exercise powers reserved to the federal government or to create obligations binding on the United States.

---

### Section 6. Right of Transit and Non-Blockade

(a) No Region may deny, obstruct, or unreasonably condition access to transportation infrastructure, energy transmission systems, or communication networks that connect other Regions to each other or to external markets.

(b) All Regions shall have the right of transit through other Regions for goods, persons, and services on reasonable and non-discriminatory terms.

(c) Infrastructure user fees, tolls, and charges imposed on transit traffic shall be:

- non-discriminatory (no higher than fees for comparable intra-Regional traffic),
- cost-based (related to actual infrastructure costs),
- transparent (published and applied uniformly).

(d) A Region that believes its right of transit is being violated may seek:

- expedited mediation through the Allocation Review Board (14 days),
- injunctive relief from Regional Courts (with federal backup jurisdiction),
- federal enforcement of access under the national common market power.

(e) In cases of imminent or ongoing blockade, the federal government may:

- order immediate restoration of access pending dispute resolution,
- impose sanctions on the offending Region, including withholding of equalization transfers,
- assume temporary operational control of affected infrastructure.

(f) This section does not require Regions to build new infrastructure, only to maintain reasonable access to existing infrastructure connecting other Regions.

# ARTICLE XIII - CYBER DEFENSE AND DIGITAL SECURITY

### Section 1. Constitutional Domain

The cyber domain presents distinct constitutional risks that require explicit treatment separate from kinetic armed force:

- Nation-state cyber attacks can disrupt elections, sabotage infrastructure, and undermine democratic processes.
- Unlike traditional threats, cyber attacks cross borders instantly, exploit civilian systems, and blur the distinction between war and peace.
- Cyber capabilities can enable domestic authoritarianism through surveillance, political targeting, and information manipulation.

This Article establishes allocation of authority, protective thresholds, and prohibitions to address these risks.

---

### Section 2. Allocation of Cyber Defense Authority

(a) Cyber defense shall be allocated as follows:

- Federal Armed Forces: defense against nation-state cyber adversaries, protection of federal systems, intelligence gathering on foreign threats, and coordination with international allies.
- Regional Guard Forces: protection of regional critical infrastructure including election systems, and coordination of incident response across member states.
- States and private sector: protection of state systems and private infrastructure, with mandatory reporting of breaches affecting public safety.

(b) Federal cyber forces are part of the Federal Armed Forces and subject to the civilian control requirements of Article XII.

(c) Regional cyber units are part of Regional Guard Forces.

---

### Section 3. Critical Infrastructure

(a) Critical infrastructure includes electrical grids, water and wastewater systems, financial networks, healthcare systems, transportation networks, and communications infrastructure.

- Scale of impact: National systems are federal responsibility; regional systems are regional responsibility.
- Ownership: Private operators bear primary responsibility for their own systems, with government oversight.
- Spillover effects: Infrastructure crossing regional boundaries requires federal coordination.

---

### Section 4. Incident Response Thresholds

(a) Cyber incidents rising to the level of armed attack are subject to the two-key authorization requirement of Article XII, Section 2.

(b) Such incidents trigger emergency powers under Article XIV, subject to the same time limits and restoration mandates.

(c) Routine cyber defense operations-including monitoring, patching, and incident response-do not require two-key authorization and operate under normal administrative authority.

---

### Section 5. Digital Rights and Prohibitions

(a) The federal government shall not conduct domestic surveillance without judicial authorization.

(b) No government at any level may use cyber capabilities against lawful political activity.

(c) The federal government shall not assume control of regional election infrastructure except as provided in Article VI.

(d) These prohibitions apply equally to direct action and to procurement of such action from private parties or foreign entities.

(e) Intelligence Oversight and Accountability.

(1) All frameworks, agreements, or understandings with foreign governments or entities concerning intelligence activities affecting persons within the United States shall be reported to a designated congressional oversight committee within thirty days of execution. Operational details may be omitted; the existence and scope of such arrangements may not be.

(2) Any person with knowledge of violations of this section may report such violations through classified channels to the Inspector General for Intelligence or to the congressional intelligence committees. The identity of such persons shall be protected, and retaliation against them is prohibited and actionable.

(3) In any prosecution for unauthorized disclosure, evidence that the disclosure revealed a violation of this section may be raised as an affirmative defense, and the jury shall be instructed that such disclosure may be justified if the defendant reasonably believed internal channels were unavailable or compromised.

(4) Information obtained in violation of this section is inadmissible in any judicial, administrative, or legislative proceeding.

### Section 6. Duty to Refuse Unlawful Orders

The duty to refuse unlawful orders under Article XII, Section 3 applies to all cyber operations.

Congress may require disclosure of:

1. foreign government funding, ownership, or control of media entities operating domestically;

3. the origin of political advertising funded directly or indirectly by foreign governments;
4. algorithmic amplification of content originating from state-controlled foreign media.

#### (b) Prohibition on Censorship Powers

This section shall not be construed to authorize:

1. government determination of truth or falsity of speech content;
2. suppression, removal, or penalization of speech based on viewpoint;
3. criminalization of the receipt or dissemination of information from foreign sources;
4. prior restraint on publication or distribution.

#### (c) Platform Transparency

Congress may require operators of large digital platforms to:

1. label content from state-affiliated foreign media;

- is enacted by both chambers of Congress and signed by the President prior to ratification,
- specifies a maximum transition period not exceeding four years from ratification,
- does not delay the immediate provisions identified in Section 3,

(b) Within five years of ratification, Congress shall by statute either:

- admit the District as a State and assign it to a Region, or
- assign the District to a Region for purposes of regional governance while preserving its unique federal district status.

(c) Regional assignment of the District shall require:

- approval by a two-thirds vote of the receiving Region's legislature, and

- For regional governance matters: the District is not subject to regional authority until Congress makes a determination under subsection (b).

---

### Section 2. Territories

(a) Residents of United States territories shall be entitled to participate in federal elections. Congress shall by statute assign each territory to a Region for purposes of such participation.

(b) Regional assignment of territories shall be governed by the following constraints:

(1) Assignment must be based on geographic proximity, historical connection, or economic integration. No territory may be assigned to a Region with which it shares no such connection.

(2) Assignment requires approval by a two-thirds vote of the receiving Region's legislature.

(3) No territory assignment may be enacted, amended, or take effect within one year before or six months after a federal presidential election.

(4) The territory's residents shall have the opportunity to approve or reject regional assignment by referendum. Rejection does not prevent federal election participation but delays regional governance integration until a subsequent assignment is approved.

(c) Congress shall by statute establish a clear path for each territory to:

- petition for statehood and subsequent regional assignment,
- petition for regional assignment without statehood,
- or continue territorial status with defined representation rights.

(d) No territory may be held indefinitely without a defined governance status. Congress shall act on any territorial petition within five years.

---

### Section 3. Tribal Nations

(b) Tribal lands remain under tribal and federal jurisdiction. Regional authority does not extend to tribal lands except by consent of the affected Tribal Nation.

(c) Regions and Tribal Nations shall enter into compacts for coordination of shared services, infrastructure, and emergency response. Such compacts shall be negotiated in good faith and shall respect tribal sovereignty.

(d) Tribal Nations may, at their option, designate representatives to participate in regional assemblies. The nature of such participation (voting, non-voting, observer) shall be determined by agreement between each Tribal Nation and the relevant Region.

(e) Nothing in this Constitution diminishes any treaty rights, trust responsibilities, or obligations of the United States to Tribal Nations.

---

# ARTICLE XVIII - IMPLEMENTATION AND DEFAULT RULES

### Section 1. Congressional Implementation Duty

Congress shall enact enabling legislation to implement this Constitution, including but not limited to:

- an Allocation Framework Act defining jurisdictional boundaries and spillover criteria,
- a Fiscal Equalization Act establishing transfer formulas and the Independent Fiscal Council,
- an Elections Implementation Act specifying procedures for federal elections under regional administration.

---

### Section 2. Default Rules Upon Congressional Failure

(a) If Congress fails to enact the Allocation Framework Act within two years of ratification, the allocation of powers shall be governed by existing federal-state divisions, with Regions exercising authority over matters previously requiring interstate compacts.

(b) If Congress fails to enact the Fiscal Equalization Act within three years of ratification, equalization transfers shall be calculated as flat per-capita grants at a baseline level equal to five percent of federal revenues, distributed to Regions with below-median fiscal capacity. This default rate shall decline by one percentage point per year beginning in year six, reaching a floor of two percent, to incentivize congressional action rather than reward inaction.

(c) If Congress fails to enact the Elections Implementation Act within two years of ratification, the following default rules apply:

- The national popular vote requirement of Article VI, Section 2 remains in full force.
- Administrative procedures (voter registration, ballot design, counting methods) shall follow prior federal law as adapted for regional administration.
- Regions assume the administrative role previously held by States.
- Any provisions of prior federal law inconsistent with the national popular vote requirement (including the Electoral College) are superseded and inapplicable.
- If no candidate receives a majority of votes cast, a runoff election between the two candidates receiving the most votes shall be held within twenty-one days. If Congress has enacted a different majority mechanism (such as ranked-choice voting or instant runoff), that mechanism supersedes this default.

(d) If Congress fails to enact appropriations for any fiscal year by the start of that fiscal year, the following automatic fiscal continuation shall apply:

- Spending shall continue at the prior fiscal year's enacted levels for all previously authorized programs.
- Prior-year levels shall be adjusted by the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, or by a successor index designated by statute.
- No new programs, expansions of existing programs, or new spending initiatives may be funded under automatic continuation.
- Automatic continuation terminates upon enactment of appropriations for the affected fiscal year.

(e) Default rules remain in effect until Congress enacts superseding legislation.

---

### Section 3. Purpose

These default rules exist to prevent deliberate nonimplementation from becoming a method of constitutional sabotage. The Constitution shall operate even if Congress fails to act.

- judicial policymaking,
- and militarized politics.

---

## Core Design Philosophy

1. **Distribute power**
2. **Lower existential stakes**
3. **Preserve real self-government**
4. **Make abuse slow, visible, and reversible**
5. **Prefer restoration over punishment**

---

## Interpretive Directive

Where ambiguity exists, interpreters shall prefer:

- decentralization over concentration,
- process enforcement over outcome imposition,

---

## Final Statement

This Constitution does not promise harmony.

It promises something more realistic:

> **That disagreement will not destroy the Republic.**
