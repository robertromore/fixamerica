# Regional Federalism Plan

A comprehensive constitutional redesign proposal for the United States, introducing a regional layer of government between the federal government and states.

## Overview

This plan addresses democratic dysfunction by distributing power across multiple levels, lowering the stakes of national politics, and creating structural barriers to authoritarian consolidation.

**Core Premise:** Political reform requires structural change, not just policy reform. Regional federalism creates a new constitutional architecture designed to survive polarization, bad faith, and institutional stress.

## Key Design Principles

1. **Distribute power** - No single institution can dominate
2. **Lower existential stakes** - Losing an election isn't catastrophic
3. **Preserve real self-government** - Meaningful autonomy at each level
4. **Make abuse slow, visible, and reversible** - Structural friction against bad actors
5. **Prefer restoration over punishment** - De-escalation, not escalation
