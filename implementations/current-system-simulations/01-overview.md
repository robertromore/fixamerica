# Current System Simulations: Overview

## Purpose

This directory contains models and simulations showing how existing US systems actually function. Understanding current mechanics is essential before proposing alternatives.

## Types of Simulations

### Electoral System Models

- **Electoral College** - How electoral votes translate to outcomes
- **Gerrymandering Effects** - How district shapes affect representation
- **Primary Systems** - State-by-state delegate allocation
- **Campaign Finance Flows** - Money pathways in elections

### Economic System Models

- **Tax System** - Distributional effects of current tax code
- **Healthcare Costs** - Flow of money through insurance system
- **Wealth Distribution** - How inequality compounds over time
- **Federal Budget** - Revenue sources and spending allocation

### Justice System Models

- **Case Processing** - How cases flow through courts
- **Sentencing Outcomes** - Factors affecting sentences
- **Prison Population** - Drivers of incarceration rates
- **Recidivism Patterns** - Post-release outcomes

### Policy Process Models

- **Legislative Process** - How bills become (or don't become) laws
- **Regulatory Process** - How agencies implement policy
- **Judicial Review** - How courts shape policy

## Simulation Standards

Each simulation should include:

### Model Description
- Variables and parameters
- Assumptions made
- Data sources

### Baseline Scenarios
- Current state representation
- Historical trends

### Sensitivity Analysis
- Key variables
- Uncertainty ranges

### Limitations
- Known simplifications
- Data gaps
- Applicability constraints

## Priority Simulations

1. **Electoral College Scenarios** - Outcomes under various vote distributions
2. **Tax Incidence Model** - Who actually pays under current system
3. **Healthcare Cost Flows** - Where money goes in US healthcare
4. **Criminal Justice Funnel** - Case flow from arrest to release

## Status

This section is under development.
