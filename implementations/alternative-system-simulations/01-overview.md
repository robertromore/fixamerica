# Alternative System Simulations: Overview

## Purpose

This directory contains models and simulations projecting outcomes under proposed reforms. These help evaluate potential policies before implementation.

## Types of Simulations

### Electoral Reform Models

- **Ranked-Choice Voting** - Election outcomes under RCV
- **Proportional Representation** - Seat distribution under PR systems
- **Multi-Member Districts** - Effects of district magnitude changes
- **Campaign Finance Reform** - Outcomes under public financing

### Economic Policy Models

- **Wealth Tax** - Revenue projections and distributional effects
- **Universal Basic Income** - Economic impacts and costs
- **Medicare for All** - Healthcare cost projections
- **Carbon Pricing** - Economic and emissions effects

### Justice Reform Models

- **Decarceration Scenarios** - Effects of reducing prison population
- **Bail Reform** - Impacts of eliminating cash bail
- **Sentencing Reform** - Outcomes under revised guidelines

### Governance Reform Models

- **Expanded House** - Effects of larger House of Representatives
- **Term Limits** - Legislative composition changes
- **Statehood Scenarios** - Electoral effects of DC/PR statehood

## Simulation Standards

Each simulation should include:

### Policy Specification

- Exact reform parameters
- Implementation assumptions
- Comparison baseline

### Projected Outcomes

- Primary effects
- Secondary/spillover effects
- Distribution of impacts

### Uncertainty Analysis

- Confidence intervals
- Scenario variations
- Sensitivity testing

### Comparison Metrics

- Current system baseline
- Foreign example benchmarks
- Academic estimates

## Priority Simulations

Based on analysis, priority alternative system simulations include:

1. **RCV Election Outcomes** - How recent elections would have differed
2. **Single-Payer Cost Model** - Total healthcare spending projections
3. **Wealth Tax Revenue** - Estimates under various rate structures
4. **Carbon Price Impacts** - Emissions and economic effects
5. **Electoral College Alternatives** - National Popular Vote and other reforms

## Methodology Notes

- Simulations should document all assumptions explicitly
- Use multiple methodological approaches where possible
- Compare results to academic literature
- Acknowledge limitations clearly

## Status

This section is under development.
