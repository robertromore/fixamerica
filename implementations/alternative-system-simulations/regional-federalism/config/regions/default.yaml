# Notes
notes: |
  Three states (DE, MD, AR) are not explicitly assigned in Schedule A.
  This configuration assigns them based on geographic and cultural proximity:
  - Delaware and Maryland -> Northeast (Mid-Atlantic region)
  - Arkansas -> Southeast (Southern/border state)
  These assignments should be confirmed in the constitutional text.
