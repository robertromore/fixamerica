# Presidential Elections: Electoral College vs Regional Federalism

## Overview

This analysis compares outcomes under the current Electoral College system with outcomes under Regional Federalism (NPV with RCV if no majority).

## Summary Table

| Year | EC Winner | RF Winner | Different? | RCV Required | First-Round Margin (%) |
|------|-----------|-----------|------------|--------------|-------------------|
| 2016 | R | D | **YES** | Yes | 2.10% |
| 2020 | D | D | No | No | 4.45% |

**Elections where outcome differed:** 1/2

## Key Findings

In 2016, the Electoral College produced a different winner than Regional Federalism's system. Under RF, the winner is determined by national popular vote (with RCV runoff if no candidate achieves a majority).

## Regional Federalism Impact

Under Regional Federalism's electoral system:

1. **Every vote counts equally** - No more 'safe state' vs 'swing state' dichotomy
2. **Majority requirement** - If no candidate achieves >50%, RCV runoff triggers
3. **Campaign everywhere** - Candidates must appeal to voters nationwide
4. **Reduced polarization potential** - Less incentive to maximize turnout only in swing states
