# Regional Fiscal Capacity Analysis (2022)

## Overview

This analysis calculates fiscal capacity for each region under the Regional Federalism proposal, using the formula from the Fiscal Equalization Act.

### Capacity Formula

Fiscal capacity = Σ (Component Base × Component Weight × Standard Rate)

| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Personal Income | 35% |
| Property Wealth | 25% |
| Consumption Base | 20% |
| Corporate Presence | 15% |
| Natural Resources | 5% |

## Summary Statistics

- **National Median Per Capita Capacity:** $1,800
- **National Average Per Capita Capacity:** $1,929
- **Capacity Range:** $1,661 - $2,417
- **Coefficient of Variation:** 0.142

## Regional Fiscal Capacity

| Region | Population (K) | Total Capacity ($B) | Per Capita ($) | Index |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|----------------|-------|
| Pacific | 53,229 | $128.68B | $2,417 | 1.34 |
| Northeast | 64,895 | $143.07B | $2,205 | 1.22 |
| Southwest | 51,865 | $93.37B | $1,800 | 1.00 |
| Midwest | 56,021 | $98.61B | $1,760 | 0.98 |
| Mountain | 3,638 | $6.33B | $1,739 | 0.97 |
| Great_Plains | 16,789 | $28.68B | $1,708 | 0.95 |
| Southeast | 86,766 | $144.08B | $1,661 | 0.92 |

## Equalization Eligibility

Regions with per capita capacity below the national median ($1,800) are eligible for equalization transfers.

**Above Median (Net Contributors):**

- Northeast: +22.5% above median
- Pacific: +34.3% above median

**Below Median (Transfer Recipients):**

- Southeast: 7.8% below median
- Midwest: 2.2% below median
- Great_Plains: 5.1% below median
- Southwest: 0.0% below median
- Mountain: 3.4% below median

| Southeast | $4258B | $9630B | $3165B | $900B | $119.0B |

## Key Findings

1. **Regional Inequality:** The coefficient of variation (0.142) indicates moderate regional disparity in fiscal capacity.

2. **Capacity Range:** The highest-capacity region has 1.5x the per capita capacity of the lowest-capacity region.

3. **Eligibility Split:** 5 regions are eligible for equalization transfers, while 2 are net contributors.
