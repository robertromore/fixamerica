# Implementations: Overview

## Purpose

This directory documents system implementations—both existing models from other countries and simulations of current and alternative systems for the United States.

## Structure

## Foreign Examples

Documentation of how other countries have implemented solutions to problems the US faces:

### By Policy Area

| Area | Countries with Notable Models |
|------|------------------------------|
| Healthcare | Canada, UK, Germany, France, Taiwan |
| Elections | Ireland (RCV), Germany (MMP), New Zealand |
| Criminal Justice | Norway, Netherlands, Portugal |
| Labor | Denmark (flexicurity), Germany (codetermination) |
| Education | Finland, Singapore, Germany |
| Climate | Denmark, Germany, Costa Rica |
| Housing | Vienna, Singapore, Finland |

### Documentation Format

Each foreign example should include:
- System description and mechanics
- Historical development
- Outcomes and metrics
- Applicability to US context
- Adaptation requirements

## Current System Simulations

Models and simulations showing how existing US systems function:

- Electoral College outcomes under various scenarios
- Tax system distributional effects
- Healthcare coverage and cost flows
- Criminal justice system flows
- Economic policy impacts

## Alternative System Simulations

Models and simulations of proposed reforms:

- Ranked-choice voting election outcomes
- Single-payer healthcare cost projections
- Wealth tax revenue estimates
- Carbon pricing economic impacts
- Universal basic income effects

## Status

This section is under development.
