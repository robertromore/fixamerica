**Findings**
- High: The Transition Act defers constitutional effectiveness by declaring the prior Constitution operative and prohibiting authority under the new Constitution until Phase completion, which conflicts with Article XV’s “take effect upon ratification” and immediate provisions (e.g., DC representation) (`plans/regional-federalism/05-implementation/02-transition-act.md:63`, `plans/regional-federalism/02-design/09-constitution.md:481`).
- High: The Transition Act conditions mandatory jurisdiction and self-executing defaults on Phase III activation and GAO capacity certification, which conflicts with Article XI’s mandatory jurisdiction and time limits and weakens enforcement during the transition (`plans/regional-federalism/05-implementation/02-transition-act.md:249`, `plans/regional-federalism/05-implementation/02-transition-act.md:281`, `plans/regional-federalism/02-design/09-constitution.md:350`).
- High: The Elections Implementation Act certification timeline (regional +21 days, national +28) conflicts with Article VI’s 14/21-day deadlines (`plans/regional-federalism/05-implementation/05-elections-implementation-act.md:300`, `plans/regional-federalism/02-design/09-constitution.md:245`).
- High: The Elections Implementation Act allows region-specific majority mechanisms while also requiring national ranked-choice tabulation, creating incompatible ballots and a non-uniform national majority method contrary to Article VI’s single national mechanism set by Congress (`plans/regional-federalism/05-implementation/05-elections-implementation-act.md:225`, `plans/regional-federalism/05-implementation/05-elections-implementation-act.md:264`).
- Medium: The Transition Act forms regions by statute despite Article I stating regions are established by the Constitution and boundary changes governed by a commission process; the initial-map authority is unclear and likely requires constitutional specification or a commission-based formation rule (`plans/regional-federalism/05-implementation/02-transition-act.md:101`, `plans/regional-federalism/02-design/09-constitution.md:25`).
- Medium: The Elections Implementation Act introduces state certification steps, which risks reintroducing state chokepoints despite Article VI vesting certification authority in regional institutions; this should be clarified as ministerial or removed (`plans/regional-federalism/05-implementation/05-elections-implementation-act.md:300`, `plans/regional-federalism/02-design/09-constitution.md:245`).

**Open Questions**
- Should the Transition Act be converted into a constitutional transition article or explicitly referenced in Article XV to avoid a supremacy conflict?
- If mandatory jurisdiction must be immediate, how should court-capacity constraints be handled without delaying constitutional enforcement (e.g., emergency staffing, temporary panels)?
- Should presidential majority mechanisms be uniform nationwide (single statutory method), and if so, which method should be mandated?
- How should the initial regional map be established: constitutional appendix, commission-led statute, or a ratification schedule?

**Suggested Improvements**
- Align the Transition Act with Article XV by adding a constitutional transition clause or revising the Act to avoid delaying constitutional effectiveness.
- Replace GAO-gated mandatory jurisdiction with accelerated staffing/temporary assignment while keeping Article XI timelines intact.
- Update Elections Implementation Act deadlines to 14/21 days and remove region-by-region majority method variation in favor of a single national method.
- Clarify or remove state certification steps, ensuring regional certification is authoritative and not dependent on state sign-off.
- Specify the initial regional map authority in the constitution or via an initial boundary commission process to avoid statutory overreach.
