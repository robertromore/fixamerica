**Findings**
- High: The documents define regions as constitutionally recognized groups of states and forbid unilateral exit, but never specify who sets boundaries, how consent is gathered, or how revisions occur, leaving a foundational legitimacy and governance gap (`plans/regional-federalism/01-foundation/01-core-idea.md:54`, `plans/regional-federalism/01-foundation/01-core-idea.md:187`, `plans/regional-federalism/01-foundation/01-core-idea.md:193`, `plans/regional-federalism/01-foundation/01-core-idea.md:208`).
- Medium: The example region map includes DC while the definition says regions are composed of multiple states and the constraints prohibit special regions, so the status of DC/territories/tribal nations is inconsistent or undefined (`plans/regional-federalism/01-foundation/01-core-idea.md:56`, `plans/regional-federalism/01-foundation/01-core-idea.md:190`, `plans/regional-federalism/01-foundation/01-core-idea.md:221`).
- Medium: Option C proposes functional overlay regions that overlap by domain, which conflicts with the earlier framing of a single constitutional tier; the model needs a clear decision or a statement that overlays are non-constitutional explorations (`plans/regional-federalism/01-foundation/01-core-idea.md:54`, `plans/regional-federalism/01-foundation/01-core-idea.md:241`).
- Medium: The core idea says regions must replace duplicative state functions, but the MV-RF list does not specify which state functions transfer, risking an additive layer that undermines the "match authority to scale" axiom (`plans/regional-federalism/01-foundation/01-core-idea.md:422`, `plans/regional-federalism/01-foundation/01-core-idea.md:475`, `plans/regional-federalism/01-foundation/02-design-axioms.md:42`).
- Medium: Axiom 7 requires self-executing law while Axioms 2 and 8 prohibit concentrated enforcement authority, so the enforcement trigger and executor model needs explicit design to avoid internal contradiction (`plans/regional-federalism/01-foundation/02-design-axioms.md:28`, `plans/regional-federalism/01-foundation/02-design-axioms.md:98`, `plans/regional-federalism/01-foundation/02-design-axioms.md:110`).

**Open Questions**
- What is the formal process for creating, revising, or dissolving regions, and what thresholds of state and regional consent are required?
- Are functional overlay regions part of the constitutional design, or only a conceptual alternative for analysis?
- What is the intended status and representation of DC, territories, and tribal nations within the regional system?

**Suggested Improvements**
- Add a "Region Formation and Revision" section that defines the boundary-setting authority, consent thresholds, review cadence, and dispute resolution process.
- Add a short subsection clarifying the treatment of DC, territories, and tribal nations to keep the definition of regions consistent with the examples.
- Explicitly label the functional overlay model as either a constitutional option with governance rules or a non-binding analytical tool.
- Expand the MV-RF list to name the specific state functions that transfer to regions and the timetable for de-duplication.
- Add a brief enforcement-design crosswalk that shows how self-executing rules trigger action without violating the distributed-power and fragmented-coercion axioms.
