**Findings**
- Medium: The overview contradicts itself on the congressional proposal threshold by stating a two‑thirds requirement and also that Congress can propose with a simple majority. Article V requires two‑thirds of both chambers; the simple‑majority line is incorrect or misleading (`analysis/political/constitutional-amendment-process/01-overview.md:21-26`).
- Medium: The current-state section claims no proposal has achieved two‑thirds in both chambers since 1971, but the history section notes the ERA passed Congress in 1972 (and D.C. Voting Rights was proposed in 1978). This is a factual inconsistency in the congressional‑proposal timeline (`analysis/political/constitutional-amendment-process/03-current-state.md:33-45`, `analysis/political/constitutional-amendment-process/02-history.md:256-263`).
- Medium: The proposed ratification deadline extension rule is inconsistent between Solutions (simple majority extension) and the model legislation (two‑thirds of each chamber). This needs a single rule to avoid confusion (`analysis/political/constitutional-amendment-process/07-solutions.md:184-189`, `analysis/political/constitutional-amendment-process/11-legislation.md:227-238`).
- Low: Time‑sensitive counts and public‑opinion figures lack date anchors and sources (proposal counts, application totals, public support ranges, near‑miss vote counts). This makes the analysis hard to verify and likely to drift (`analysis/political/constitutional-amendment-process/01-overview.md:167-195`, `analysis/political/constitutional-amendment-process/03-current-state.md:33-76`, `analysis/political/constitutional-amendment-process/03-current-state.md:232-243`).

**Open Questions**
- For the ratification deadline extension rule, should it be simple majority (as in Solutions) or two‑thirds (as in the model act)?
- Do you want the “no two‑thirds since 1971” line corrected to acknowledge ERA (1972) and D.C. Voting Rights (1978) proposals, or reframed as “no amendments ratified since 1992”?
- Should we add a Sources section (or inline citations) for proposal counts, convention application totals, and public‑opinion percentages? If so, preferred sources (CRS, NCSL, Article V Library, Pew, Gallup)?

**Suggested Improvements**
- Replace the simple‑majority line in the congressional proposal description with the correct two‑thirds requirement (or clarify the intended point, if any).
- Update the congressional‑proposal timeline to reflect that ERA (1972) and D.C. Voting Rights (1978) passed Congress but failed ratification.
- Align the deadline extension threshold across Solutions and Legislation (pick one standard and apply consistently).
- Add date anchors and citations (or a Sources section) for key counts and public‑opinion figures, including near‑miss vote totals.
