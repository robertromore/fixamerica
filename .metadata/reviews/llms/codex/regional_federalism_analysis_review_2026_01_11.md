**Findings**
- Medium: The policy stress test relies on specific national rights floors (e.g., abortion baseline bodily autonomy; gun rights floor) but the constitution/design set does not specify the content of those floors, making the analysis contingent on undefined protections (`plans/regional-federalism/03-analysis/01-stress-testing-policy.md:147`, `plans/regional-federalism/03-analysis/01-stress-testing-policy.md:193`).
- Medium: The economic stress test assumes automatic anti-dumping penalties and regional equalization fees for remote-work arbitrage without tying them to a defined enforcement mechanism or statutory authority in the design package (`plans/regional-federalism/03-analysis/02-stress-testing-economic.md:206`, `plans/regional-federalism/03-analysis/02-stress-testing-economic.md:392`).
- Medium: The hostile reinterpretation stress test cites “automatic fiscal continuation” as a key gridlock countermeasure, but this mechanism is not clearly anchored in the constitutional defaults or fiscal design, leaving a mitigation gap (`plans/regional-federalism/03-analysis/04-hostile-reinterpretation.md:226`).
- Low: The authoritarian scenario references “Appendix A” for security-force factionalization mitigation, but no appendix is present, leaving a dangling reference (`plans/regional-federalism/03-analysis/05-authoritarian-scenario.md:412`).

**Open Questions**
- Where are the substantive national rights floors defined for conflicts like abortion and gun rights, and should the analysis explicitly link to those definitions?
- Should the automatic anti-dumping penalties and remote-work equalization fees be formalized in the Allocation Framework Act or Fiscal Architecture to match the stress-test assumptions?
- Is “automatic fiscal continuation” intended as a constitutional default, a fiscal statute, or a narrower continuity mechanism for essential federal functions?
- What is “Appendix A” meant to contain, and should it be added or the reference removed?

**Suggested Improvements**
- Add explicit citations or assumptions for rights-floor content in `plans/regional-federalism/03-analysis/01-stress-testing-policy.md`, or note that these floors require a rights-floor catalog in the constitution or implementation acts.
- Link anti-dumping penalties and remote-work equalization fees in `plans/regional-federalism/03-analysis/02-stress-testing-economic.md` to a specific statute or add a short note that these are proposed implementation requirements.
- Either add a constitutional/statutory continuity mechanism to support the “automatic fiscal continuation” claim, or revise the hostile reinterpretation section to match existing defaults.
- Resolve the dangling “Appendix A” reference by adding the appendix content (likely armed-forces contingency detail) or removing the reference.
