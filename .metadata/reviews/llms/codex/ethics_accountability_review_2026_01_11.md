**Findings**
- Medium: Executive Order 10939 is misattributed to the Eisenhower administration; EO 10939 was issued in 1961 (Kennedy). This is a factual error in the history section (`analysis/political/ethics-accountability/03-history.md:49-58`).
- Medium: The Biden section states “Restored IG independence,” which overstates what has been achieved (IG independence is statutory and was not restored by executive action). Rephrase as administrative steps/pledges or remove the claim unless sourced to a concrete legal change (`analysis/political/ethics-accountability/02-current-state.md:250-258`).
- Medium: Multiple time-sensitive or quantitative claims lack date anchors and sources (e.g., “74 federal Inspectors General,” “80%+ support” for ethics reform, and other percentage/volume claims). This makes verification difficult across current-state/stakeholders/overview (`analysis/political/ethics-accountability/02-current-state.md:92-120`, `analysis/political/ethics-accountability/05-stakeholders.md:35-60`, `analysis/political/ethics-accountability/01-overview.md:55-86`).
- Low: Some statute names are imprecise (e.g., “Foreign Gifts Act” should be “Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act”). Clarify titles where they appear in the statute table (`analysis/political/ethics-accountability/02-current-state.md:10-18`).

**Open Questions**
- Do you want a single “as of” year (e.g., 2024) applied to all numeric counts/percentages with a Sources section in `02-current-state.md` and inline citations elsewhere?
- For the Biden-era IG line, do you prefer a neutral phrasing (“issued EO 14019/ethics pledges; supported IG protection”) or removal unless a concrete statutory change can be cited?

**Suggested Improvements**
- Correct EO 10939 attribution to Kennedy (1961) and consider adding a citation.
- Replace the Biden “restored IG independence” statement with a sourced, narrower claim or remove.
- Add date anchors and sources for counts/percentages (IG count, public support, etc.); add a consolidated Sources section to current-state if desired.
- Use precise statute names in tables (e.g., Foreign Gifts and Decorations Act).
