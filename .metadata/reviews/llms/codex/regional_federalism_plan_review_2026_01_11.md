**Findings**
- Critical: Regional boundaries are sketched but constitutionally frozen, so future economic/geographic shifts could lock in misaligned regions; add a boundary commission + review cadence + revision criteria and internal representation constraints to prevent dominance (`plans/regional-federalism/01-core-idea.md:208`, `plans/regional-federalism/15-constitution.md:27`).
- High: The spillover test and non-concurrency rule lack operational thresholds, which will push core jurisdiction fights back to courts; define measurable spillover metrics, pre-cleared compacts, and an arbitration ladder (`plans/regional-federalism/02-allocation-of-powers.md:123`, `plans/regional-federalism/02-allocation-of-powers.md:399`, `plans/regional-federalism/15-constitution.md:98`).
- High: Presidential selection remains ambiguous (national popular vs proportional regional), and regional certification concentrates risk into 7–9 chokepoints; choose one method and specify tie-breaks, audits, and anti-capture safeguards (`plans/regional-federalism/05-elections.md:179`, `plans/regional-federalism/05-elections.md:301`, `plans/regional-federalism/15-constitution.md:179`).
- Medium: Equalization and the benefits spine are framed as principles but not operationalized, which leaves redistribution legitimacy exposed to ad hoc bargaining; specify formula inputs, triggers, and an independent fiscal council (`plans/regional-federalism/04-economic-conflicts.md:281`, `plans/regional-federalism/08-fiscal-architecture.md:384`, `plans/regional-federalism/15-constitution.md:227`).
- Medium: Amendment mechanics use “supermajority” and fixed windows without explicit thresholds or turnout rules, creating a core legitimacy ambiguity; set numeric thresholds and a concrete ratification timeline (`plans/regional-federalism/07-amendment-process.md:170`, `plans/regional-federalism/07-amendment-process.md:241`, `plans/regional-federalism/15-constitution.md:266`).
- Medium: Enforcement relies on mandatory-jurisdiction courts and two-key force authorization, but the enforcing actors and keyholders are undefined, which risks paralysis in real crises; specify who triggers defaults, who executes orders, and which civilians constitute the two-key rule (`plans/regional-federalism/14-judiciary.md:111`, `plans/regional-federalism/14-judiciary.md:256`, `plans/regional-federalism/15-constitution.md:337`).

**Open Questions**
- How can regions be reconfigured without full constitutional amendment, and how are new states or reorganizations handled once regions are fixed (`plans/regional-federalism/15-constitution.md:27`)?
- What is the intended status and representation of DC, territories, and tribal nations in the regional map and in regional legislatures (`plans/regional-federalism/01-core-idea.md:221`)?
- What internal representation model should regions adopt to prevent metro dominance or rural veto (bicameral, proportional, mixed), and how is that standardized or left to regions (`plans/regional-federalism/01-core-idea.md:445`)?
- What is the transitional funding plan for provisional regional institutions before new regional tax bases come online (`plans/regional-federalism/20-transition-act.md:97`)?

**Suggested Improvements**
- Add a “Regional Boundary & Representation Annex” with criteria, review cadence, and DC/territory/tribal treatment, plus default regional legislature templates (`plans/regional-federalism/01-core-idea.md:157`, `plans/regional-federalism/15-constitution.md:27`).
- Create a jurisdiction decision tree and spillover scoring matrix with worked examples (housing, grid, pandemics) to make the allocation rule operational (`plans/regional-federalism/02-allocation-of-powers.md:109`, `plans/regional-federalism/03-stress-testing.md:93`).
- Publish a fixed election rules appendix that locks the presidential selection method, certification timelines, audit standards, and tie-break procedures (`plans/regional-federalism/05-elections.md:247`, `plans/regional-federalism/15-constitution.md:189`).
- Add a fiscal formula appendix detailing equalization inputs, automatic triggers, enforcement pathways, and transition funding flows (`plans/regional-federalism/08-fiscal-architecture.md:384`, `plans/regional-federalism/20-transition-act.md:167`).

Overall, the plan is unusually coherent and stress-tested; its strongest contribution is the survivability-first design logic. Tightening the operational rules (boundaries, thresholds, enforcement, and fiscal formulas) will materially reduce the remaining ambiguity risks.
