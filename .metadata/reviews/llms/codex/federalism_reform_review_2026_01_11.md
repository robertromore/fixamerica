**Findings**
- High: The preemption act bars conflict preemption absent an express statement, which conflicts with Supremacy Clause basics when state and federal law are directly incompatible. This needs a carve-out for direct conflict/impossibility preemption or a narrowed scope to implied/field preemption only (`analysis/political/federalism-reform/11-legislation.md:129-145`).
- Medium: Time-sensitive quantitative claims lack date anchors and sourcing across overview/current-state (grants totals, preemption counts, unfunded mandate costs, incentives, revenue shares). There is no consolidated Sources section in current-state, making verification difficult (`analysis/political/federalism-reform/01-overview.md:67-72`, `analysis/political/federalism-reform/03-current-state.md:19-25`, `analysis/political/federalism-reform/03-current-state.md:93-99`, `analysis/political/federalism-reform/03-current-state.md:140-146`, `analysis/political/federalism-reform/03-current-state.md:191-223`, `analysis/political/federalism-reform/03-current-state.md:308-334`).
- Medium: Solutions limit compact pre-authorization to categories not affecting federal interests, but the model statute pre-authorizes broad categories (environment, tax, transportation) without a federal-interest filter or explicit compatibility test, creating a scope mismatch (`analysis/political/federalism-reform/07-solutions.md:192-203`, `analysis/political/federalism-reform/11-legislation.md:231-262`).
- Medium: The Grant Simplification Act grants OMB authority to consolidate grant programs with only a 60-day review period, which risks over-delegation and appropriations/authorization conflicts. It needs explicit congressional approval or a fast-track approval mechanism tied to authorizing statutes (`analysis/political/federalism-reform/11-legislation.md:314-321`).
- Low: State model legislation uses placeholders like `[State]`, `[State Budget Office]`, and `[date]` without a short guidance note; other topics add a brief placeholder note to avoid confusion (`analysis/political/federalism-reform/11-legislation.md:372-428`).

**Open Questions**
- For the preemption act, do you want to preserve conflict preemption for direct incompatibility (impossibility/obstacle) while eliminating field/implied preemption, or adopt a different carve-out?
- Should the compact pre-authorization categories be narrowed to avoid federal-interest conflicts, or should the statute add a general compatibility test plus notice/GAO review?
- Do you prefer a consolidated Sources section in `03-current-state.md` (GAO, CBO, Census, USASpending, NCSL, NASBO, Brennan Center) plus inline date anchors, consistent with other political-analysis topics?

**Suggested Improvements**
- Revise the preemption act to preserve constitutionally required conflict preemption and limit the express-statement rule to implied/field preemption; add a savings clause clarifying Supremacy Clause conflict preemption.
- Add "as of YEAR" anchors and citations for all time-sensitive stats in overview/current-state, and add a Sources section in `03-current-state.md` for core datasets.
- Align compact facilitation language by adding a federal-interest compatibility test to the pre-authorization list or narrowing the categories to those clearly outside federal interests.
- Add a congressional approval step or expedited approval mechanism for OMB-led grant consolidations to avoid separation-of-powers concerns.
- Insert a short placeholder guidance note before state model legislation explaining how to replace bracketed fields.
