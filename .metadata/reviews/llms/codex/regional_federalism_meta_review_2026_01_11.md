**Findings**
- Medium: Identified gaps omit the dependency on major implementation acts (Allocation Framework, Fiscal Equalization, Elections Implementation) and the risk of long-term operation under defaults or statutory capture; Category V lists transition risks but not ongoing statutory dependency (`plans/regional-federalism/04-meta/02-identified-gaps.md:186`).
- Medium: Under-specified domains do not include the unresolved content of federal rights floors (a core assumption in policy stress tests and design), leaving a major under-specification unlisted (`plans/regional-federalism/04-meta/02-identified-gaps.md:122`).
- Medium: Long-horizon risks do not mention boundary revision politics and regional identity hardening around map changes, despite regions being central to legitimacy; this is a plausible systemic risk absent from the gap list (`plans/regional-federalism/04-meta/02-identified-gaps.md:158`).
- Low: The gaps list lacks an explicit priority/triage scheme (severity/urgency/mitigation readiness), making it hard to see which gaps should be addressed first or tracked over time (`plans/regional-federalism/04-meta/02-identified-gaps.md:15`).

**Open Questions**
- Should the identified-gaps document add a dedicated gap for statutory dependency/implementation-act capture and prolonged default-mode governance?
- Should rights-floor content and enforcement detail be called out as an under-specified domain to align with the policy stress-test assumptions?
- Is boundary revision politics (commission disputes, identity hardening around regional maps) intended to be covered under long-horizon risks, and if so, where?
- Do you want a lightweight prioritization rubric (severity x likelihood x mitigation readiness) added to the gaps list?

**Suggested Improvements**
- Add a Gap entry under Category III or V for implementation-act dependency and statutory capture risk, referencing the Article XVII defaults as a partial but imperfect backstop.
- Add a Gap entry under Category III for rights-floor content ambiguity and enforcement detail, linking to Article III and the relevant implementation acts.
- Add a Gap entry under Category IV for boundary revision politics and regional identity crystallization risks.
- Add a short priority tag or rubric at the top of the gaps list to make ordering and follow-up explicit.
