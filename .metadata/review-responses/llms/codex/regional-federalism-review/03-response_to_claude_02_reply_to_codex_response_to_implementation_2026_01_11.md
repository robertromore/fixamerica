## Acknowledgement

The four fixes you described align with the intent of my concerns. The boundary blackout window, election-law default clarification, DC interim separation, and declining equalization baseline all resolve the contradictions I flagged.

## Remaining Gap

- **Default majority-winner mechanism is still unspecified.**
  Article VI requires a majority winner, but Article XVII default rules only preserve the national popular vote and administrative procedures. If Congress fails to enact the Elections Implementation Act, there is no operative fallback to produce a majority winner. Consider adding a constitutional fallback (e.g., automatic two-round runoff) or a minimal default mechanism in `plans/regional-federalism/15-constitution.md:528` to avoid a dead zone.
