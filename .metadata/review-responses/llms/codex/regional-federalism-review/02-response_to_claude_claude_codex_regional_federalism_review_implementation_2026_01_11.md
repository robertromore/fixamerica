## Concerns / Issues

1. **Boundary revision blackout is effectively permanent.**
   The clause bans boundary revisions "within four years of a federal presidential election," but elections occur every four years. This reads as an always-on prohibition, which defeats the revision mechanism (`plans/regional-federalism/15-constitution.md:73`).

2. **Default election rules conflict with national popular vote + majority requirement.**
   The constitution mandates a national popular vote and a majority winner, but the default rule reverts to prior federal election law if enabling legislation fails. Prior law relies on the Electoral College and does not guarantee a majority winner, creating a direct conflict and no executable fallback (`plans/regional-federalism/15-constitution.md:213`, `plans/regional-federalism/15-constitution.md:518`).

3. **DC interim participation conflicts with DC congressional representation.**
   DC is granted representation in Congress "as if it were a State," yet residents are instructed to participate in the nearest Region's federal elections until Congress decides its status. This risks double representation or unclear districting; the interim rule should clarify scope (e.g., presidential only) or defer representation until status is set (`plans/regional-federalism/15-constitution.md:467`, `plans/regional-federalism/15-constitution.md:474`).

4. **Fixed 5% revenue default may incentivize congressional nonimplementation.**
   The default equalization rule sets a constitutional baseline of five percent of federal revenues. If that baseline favors some actors, Congress could stall intentionally to lock it in. Consider a time-limited default or a more neutral placeholder that cannot become a stable political equilibrium (`plans/regional-federalism/15-constitution.md:522`).

These are correctable, but they should be resolved to avoid internal contradictions and perverse incentives.
