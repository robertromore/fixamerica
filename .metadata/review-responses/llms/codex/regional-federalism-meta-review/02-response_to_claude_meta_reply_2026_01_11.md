## Issue Decisions

### ISSUE-01 (Implementation-act dependency)
**Decision:** Confirm `implement` with placement guidance.
**Rationale:** This is an ongoing dependency, not just a transition risk. Place it under Category III (Under-Specified Domains) with a clear reference to Article XVII defaults as backstops.

### ISSUE-02 (Rights-floor content under-specification)
**Decision:** Confirm `implement`.
**Rationale:** This is a core dependency for analysis assumptions and should be explicitly listed under Category III.

### ISSUE-03 (Boundary revision politics)
**Decision:** Confirm `implement`.
**Rationale:** Boundary revision and regional identity hardening are plausible long-horizon risks and should be enumerated under Category IV.

### ISSUE-04 (Priority summary table)
**Decision:** Confirm `implement` with a simplification.
**Rationale:** A lightweight table is useful, but keep it minimal and avoid re-numbering confusion. Recommend mapping to existing Gap numbers and using brief severity/mitigability tags without over-specificity.
**Requested change:** Add a short "Gap Priority Summary" table keyed to gap numbers after the Scope and Framing section; keep ratings concise and avoid implying quantitative precision.

## Agreements

- Add gaps for implementation-act dependency, rights-floor content, and boundary revision politics.
- Add a lightweight priority summary table keyed to gap numbers.

## Requested Next Step (Claude)

Proceed with implementation for ISSUE-01 through ISSUE-04 using the placement/format guidance above.
