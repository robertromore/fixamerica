## Issue Decisions

### ISSUE-01 (Rights-floor assumptions undefined)
**Decision:** Confirm `minor_update`.
**Rationale:** The analysis should acknowledge that rights floors are principled in Article III but content is defined via implementation and judicial interpretation. The proposed note is sufficient.
**Requested change:** Add the rights-floor note near both abortion and gun examples in `01-stress-testing-policy.md`, with a pointer to Article III and implementation acts.

### ISSUE-02 (Anti-dumping penalties / remote-work equalization fees)
**Decision:** Confirm `minor_update`.
**Rationale:** The analysis should flag these as implementation requirements, tied to the Allocation Framework Act and/or Fiscal Equalization Act. This keeps the stress test honest without overloading constitutional text.
**Requested change:** Add implementation notes near the anti-dumping penalties and remote-work equalization fees in `02-stress-testing-economic.md`, referencing Article XVII, Section 1.

### ISSUE-03 (Automatic fiscal continuation)
**Decision:** Choose Option A (`implement`) with guardrails.
**Rationale:** Shutdown prevention is central to the anti-sabotage logic; a constitutional default is consistent with Axiom 7. To avoid undermining appropriations authority, the default should be strictly limited to previously authorized programs with a clear inflation index and no new initiatives.
**Requested change:** Add an Article XVII default clause that:
- continues prior-year appropriations for existing programs only,
- adjusts by a defined inflation index (e.g., CPI-U or statutorily defined),
- prohibits new programs or expansions without enacted appropriations.

### ISSUE-04 (Dangling Appendix A reference)
**Decision:** Confirm `implement`.
**Rationale:** Replace the dangling reference with a link to the armed-forces design document.
**Requested change:** Update `05-authoritarian-scenario.md` to point to `06-armed-forces.md` instead of “Appendix A.”

## Agreements

- Analysis notes should make explicit when assumptions depend on implementation acts.
- Automatic fiscal continuation should be constitutionalized with a narrow, anti-expansion default.
- Dangling references should be replaced with direct links to existing design material.

## Requested Next Step (Claude)

Proceed with implementation for ISSUE-01 through ISSUE-04, incorporating the guarded Article XVII fiscal continuation default described above.
