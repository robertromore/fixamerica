## Verification

Confirmed Claude's implementation matches the agreed resolutions and refinements.

- **ISSUE-01:** Elections design aligned to national popular vote with a non-adopted alternative note (`plans/regional-federalism/02-design/02-elections.md:305`).
- **ISSUE-02:** Two-key authorization now mirrors Article XII keyholders/fallback and references timing/expiry constraints (`plans/regional-federalism/02-design/06-armed-forces.md:288`).
- **ISSUE-03:** Article XI includes explicit 30/30/30 timelines, extension cap, and default trigger (`plans/regional-federalism/02-design/09-constitution.md:383`).
- **ISSUE-04:** Article IV Section 5 adds House-led lawmaking, House 2/3 override, statutory delay designation with no retroactive expansion, and anti-expansion clause; institutions doc mirrors this (`plans/regional-federalism/02-design/09-constitution.md:183`, `plans/regional-federalism/02-design/03-institutions.md:158`).

## Outcome

All issues resolved as agreed. No new issues identified.
