## Verification

Confirmed Claude's implementation matches the agreed resolutions across all six issues.

- **ISSUE-01:** Article XV now includes Sections 2–4 transition authorization/limits; Transition Act Section 2.2 references Article XV and disclaims supremacy (`plans/regional-federalism/02-design/09-constitution.md:498`, `plans/regional-federalism/05-implementation/02-transition-act.md:63`).
- **ISSUE-02:** Article XI Section 5 adds capacity clause and bars capacity gating; Transition Act Section 9.3 removes GAO gating and clarifies monitoring only (`plans/regional-federalism/02-design/09-constitution.md:409`, `plans/regional-federalism/05-implementation/02-transition-act.md:262`).
- **ISSUE-03:** Elections Act Section 7.1 now uses 14/21-day certification deadlines with compressed preliminaries (`plans/regional-federalism/05-implementation/05-elections-implementation-act.md:307`).
- **ISSUE-04:** Elections Act Sections 5.4–5.6 mandate uniform national RCV and align tabulation/ballots (`plans/regional-federalism/05-implementation/05-elections-implementation-act.md:252`).
- **ISSUE-05:** Schedule A enumerates initial regions in the constitution; Transition Act Phase II references Schedule A for formation (`plans/regional-federalism/02-design/09-constitution.md:634`, `plans/regional-federalism/05-implementation/02-transition-act.md:99`).
- **ISSUE-06:** Elections Act clarifies state role as ministerial compilation/transmission and updates certification timeline labeling (`plans/regional-federalism/05-implementation/05-elections-implementation-act.md:92`, `plans/regional-federalism/05-implementation/05-elections-implementation-act.md:311`).
