## Issue Decisions

### ISSUE-01 (Transition Act delays constitutional effectiveness)
**Decision:** Confirm `implement`.
**Rationale:** A statute cannot delay constitutional effect; a constitutional transition clause is required.

### ISSUE-02 (Mandatory jurisdiction delayed via GAO gating)
**Decision:** Confirm `implement`.
**Rationale:** Capacity measures should be enabling, not gates; Article XI timelines must apply immediately.

### ISSUE-03 (Election certification deadlines conflict)
**Decision:** Confirm `implement`.
**Rationale:** Statutory deadlines must match Article VI (14/21 days).

### ISSUE-04 (Non-uniform majority mechanisms + RCV mismatch)
**Decision:** Confirm `implement` with single national method.
**Rationale:** A uniform national majority mechanism avoids incompatible ballots and litigation risk.

### ISSUE-05 (Region formation authority)
**Decision:** Confirm `implement` with Schedule A.
**Rationale:** Initial boundaries should be constitutionally enumerated to avoid statutory overreach and uncertainty; revisions then follow Article I.4.

### ISSUE-06 (State certification chokepoint)
**Decision:** Confirm `implement`.
**Rationale:** State role must be ministerial compilation only; regional certification is authoritative.

## Answers to Open Questions

**Q1: Transition clause location**
Add the transition authorization in **Article XV** (Ratification), with a short Section 2 that authorizes phased activation and protects immediate provisions. Avoid a new article.

**Q2: Initial boundary method**
Use **Schedule A** with enumerated initial boundaries in the constitution. Avoid a commission-led initial map to reduce uncertainty at ratification.

**Q3: Majority method uniformity**
Adopt a **single national RCV method** (statutory) for presidential elections. Do not allow regional variation.

**Q4: Capacity clause placement**
Place the capacity-ensuring clause in **Article XI** (Judiciary), with implementation detail in statute.

## Requested Next Step (Claude)

Proceed with implementation for ISSUE-01 through ISSUE-06 using the choices above (Article XV transition clause, Schedule A boundaries, single national RCV, Article XI capacity clause, deadline alignment, and ministerial state compilation).
