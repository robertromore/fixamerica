## Issue Decisions

### ISSUE-01 (Region formation and revision process)
**Decision:** Modify to `minor_update` (not `no_action`).
**Rationale:** The process is resolved in the constitution, but the foundation document presents regions as constitutional entities without any pointer to formation/revision mechanics. A single forward-reference sentence in Section 5 (criteria/constraints) keeps the foundation framing intact while preventing a legitimacy gap for readers who only read the foundation set.
**Requested change:** Add a short forward-reference note to the constitutional boundary process (commission, review cadence, consent thresholds) without restating details.

### ISSUE-02 (DC/territory/tribal status)
**Decision:** Confirm `minor_update`.
**Rationale:** The example map includes DC while the definition says regions are composed of states. A clarifying note in Section 6 fixes the inconsistency and points to the non-state entity treatment in the constitution.
**Requested change:** Add a note that DC/territories/tribal nations are handled separately in the constitutional design and that the map is illustrative.

### ISSUE-03 (Functional overlay regions)
**Decision:** Confirm `minor_update`.
**Rationale:** Option C reads like a viable structural alternative, but the design adopts fixed geographic regions. Marking it as a conceptual alternative avoids ambiguity.
**Requested change:** Label Option C as not adopted in the constitutional design and add a forward reference.

### ISSUE-04 (MV-RF transfer scope)
**Decision:** Modify to `minor_update` with a slightly stronger signal.
**Rationale:** The Allocation Framework Act carries the operational details, but the MV-RF list should at least signal that specific functions are transferred and de-duplicated to avoid an additive layer.
**Requested change:** Add a sentence in Section 13 noting that MV-RF includes explicit transfer/de-duplication of specified cross-border functions (e.g., grid reliability standards, regional housing compacts, public health procurement), with a forward reference to the Allocation Framework Act.

### ISSUE-05 (Enforcement axioms tension)
**Decision:** Confirm `implement` with a brief design note.
**Rationale:** A short reconciliation paragraph is sufficient here; deep detail belongs in judiciary/armed forces docs.
**Requested change:** Add a short paragraph after Axiom 8 (or a short "Design Note" section) explaining that self-executing rules rely on automatic defaults/certification while coercive enforcement remains multi-actor, with a pointer to the constitution/judiciary/armed-forces docs.

## Answers to Open Questions

1. **Foundation vs design scope:** Keep the foundation documents as problem-framing and option-setting, but add concise forward references and explicit labels where the design has chosen a path (e.g., Option C not adopted). This prevents contradictions without bloating the foundation layer.
2. **ISSUE-05 depth:** Keep it to a brief paragraph or short design note (3-6 sentences) plus a forward reference. No need for a full subsection.
3. **Verification preference:** Please implement the minor updates + design note now; I will verify afterward.

## Requested Next Step (Claude)

Implement the minor updates in `plans/regional-federalism/01-foundation/01-core-idea.md` and the design note in `plans/regional-federalism/01-foundation/02-design-axioms.md`, then update the tracker with outputs and any changelog entries.
