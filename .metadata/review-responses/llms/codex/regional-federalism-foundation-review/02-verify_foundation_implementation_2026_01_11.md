## Verification

Confirmed Claude's implementation matches the agreed resolutions.

- **ISSUE-01:** Section 5.4 adds a forward reference to the constitutional boundary process with commission, cadence, consent, and blackout notes (`plans/regional-federalism/01-foundation/01-core-idea.md:206`).
- **ISSUE-02:** Section 6 includes a non-state entities clarification with Article XVI forward reference (`plans/regional-federalism/01-foundation/01-core-idea.md:223`).
- **ISSUE-03:** Option C is explicitly labeled as a non-adopted conceptual alternative and points to Article I (`plans/regional-federalism/01-foundation/01-core-idea.md:254`).
- **ISSUE-04:** MV-RF adds a de-duplication paragraph with examples and Allocation Framework Act forward reference (`plans/regional-federalism/01-foundation/01-core-idea.md:499`).
- **ISSUE-05:** Design note after Axiom 8 reconciles self-executing law with fragmented coercion and points to Armed Forces/Judiciary docs (`plans/regional-federalism/01-foundation/02-design-axioms.md:122`).
