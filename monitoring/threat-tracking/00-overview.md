# Threat Tracking: Overview

## Purpose

This section monitors **specific threats** to democratic governance. Unlike democratic health (which tracks positive indicators), threat tracking focuses on actions, events, and patterns that historically precede or accompany democratic backsliding.

The goal is not prediction but documentation: creating a factual record of concerning developments so that patterns become visible and accountability is possible.

## Threat Categories

### Authoritarian Indicators

Actions that match patterns seen in democratic backsliding worldwide:

- Attacks on electoral legitimacy without evidence
- Attempts to politicize law enforcement or intelligence
- Rhetoric dehumanizing opponents or minority groups
- Efforts to undermine judicial independence
- Concentration of power in the executive
- Attacks on press freedom and independent media

See: [Authoritarian Indicators](authoritarian-indicators/00-overview.md)

### Corruption Indicators

Ethics violations and self-dealing:

- Conflicts of interest and emoluments concerns
- Nepotism and cronyism in appointments
- Use of office for personal financial gain
- Obstruction of oversight and accountability

*To be developed*

### Institutional Decay

Erosion of norms and guardrails:

- Violation of longstanding precedents
- Refusal to comply with oversight
- Politicization of traditionally non-partisan institutions
- Degradation of inter-branch cooperation

*To be developed*

### Rights Violations

Civil liberties and civil rights concerns:

- Voting rights restrictions
- Due process violations
- Freedom of assembly constraints
- Discriminatory enforcement

*To be developed*

## Methodology

### What Gets Tracked

Events qualify for tracking when they:

1. **Are verifiable**: Based on public record, not speculation
2. **Match defined indicators**: Fit within established threat categories
3. **Are significant**: Not trivial or routine political disagreement
4. **Have democratic implications**: Affect governance, rights, or accountability

### What Does NOT Get Tracked

- Policy disagreements (tax rates, regulations, etc.)
- Routine political rhetoric and campaigning
- Unverified allegations or speculation
- Actions within normal bounds of political competition

### Event Documentation

Each tracked event includes:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Date | When the event occurred |
| Actor(s) | Who was involved |
| Category | Which threat indicator applies |
| Description | Factual summary of what happened |
| Sources | Primary sources documenting the event |
| Context | Relevant background information |
| Severity | Assessment using the scoring rubric |

### Severity Scoring

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 1 - Minor | Rhetoric or symbolic action with limited impact |
| 2 - Moderate | Concrete action affecting institutions or rights |
| 3 - Serious | Significant harm to democratic norms or functioning |
| 4 - Severe | Major threat to democratic institutions |
| 5 - Critical | Existential threat to democratic governance |

## Non-Partisan Application

The same methodology applies regardless of political affiliation:

- Indicator definitions are established before application to specific actors
- Equivalent actions by different actors receive equivalent treatment
- Political disagreement is distinguished from democratic threat
- Methodology can be applied retrospectively to historical events
