# Democratic Backsliding: Overview

## Purpose

This section tracks systemic indicators of democratic backsliding that span multiple institutions and domains. It is broader than authoritarian-indicators and is meant to capture cross-cutting patterns of erosion, escalation, and institutional capture.

DBS (Democratic Backsliding Scorecard) runs live here as the formal, auditable scoring layer.

## Scope

- Multi-system monitoring (coercion, legitimacy, compliance, elections, courts, media)
- Trend-focused, not single-event focused
- Structured scoring with audit logs and reproducibility

## Subdirectories

- [DBS](dbs/00-overview.md): Event log, runs, and templates for DBS-v1.1e
