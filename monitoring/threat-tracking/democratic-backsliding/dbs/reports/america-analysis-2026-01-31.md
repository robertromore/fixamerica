# DBS Analysis Report: America

**Topic:** america (full system assessment)
**Report Date:** 2026-01-31
**Report Type:** Comprehensive analysis (alerts + baseline comparison + status)

## How to Read This Report

This report analyzes the health of American democratic institutions using the Democratic Backsliding Scorecard (DBS), a structured framework that tracks observable political events against historical patterns of authoritarian consolidation. The DBS produces a score from 0 to 100, where higher scores indicate greater erosion of democratic safeguards.

This is not a partisan assessment. It applies the same criteria regardless of which party holds power. The same framework produces scores for countries like Hungary, Turkey, and Venezuela, allowing meaningful cross-national comparison.

Each section includes a brief explanation of what it shows and why it matters. Technical terms are defined in the Glossary at the end.

## Current Status

```
DBS-v1.1e Rolling (2026-01-01 to 2026-01-31, run date: 2026-01-31)
Topic: america: 73 (confidence band: +/-6)
Tier: Authoritarian transition zone (70-84)
Pathway: executive-driven+security_dominant
Red-lines: F6 (leader-above-law operationalized)
```

This score places the United States in the "authoritarian transition zone" -- a range where multiple democratic safeguards are under strain but outcomes are not yet fixed. The confidence band of +/-6 means the true score likely falls between 67 and 79, which spans from "severe backsliding" into the "authoritarian transition zone."

---

## Alert Report

*Alert conditions identify situations requiring urgent attention. Critical alerts indicate democratic safeguards have been breached. High alerts signal rapid deterioration. Watch alerts flag emerging risks.*

### CRITICAL ALERTS

**1. Red-Line Activated: F6 -- Leader Above Law (+10 multiplier active)**

The leader-above-law doctrine has been operationalized through the combination of the *Trump v. United States* Supreme Court immunity ruling, 1,609 pardons (including preemptive pardons for fake electors), and the DOJ functioning as "President's lawyers." This red-line adds +10 to the raw score.

**Why this matters:** When a leader is effectively immune from legal accountability, all other safeguards depend on voluntary restraint. Historically, operationalized immunity is one of the hardest backsliding indicators to reverse.

### HIGH ALERTS

**2. Eight Diagnostic Flags Active**

The following compound risk patterns are simultaneously present:

| Flag | Condition | Risk |
|------|-----------|------|
| Prosecutorial sword and shield | C3=5, F6=5 | Two-tiered justice: prosecute opponents, protect allies |
| Accountability collapse accelerating | C7=5, C3=5 | Pardon abuse + politicized prosecution = no accountability |
| Expertise void | F1=5, C4=5 | Career professionals removed; oversight bodies gutted |
| Bureaucratic capture | F1=5, C4=5 | Agencies cannot implement policy independently |
| State of exception pattern | A1=5, A4=4, F6=5 | Emergency framing + exceptional measures + immunity |
| Electoral oversight compromised | E1=5, D1=4 | Press freedom impaired + federal election interference |
| Coordinated polarized manipulation | E3a=4, E3b=5 | Polarized environment being actively exploited by government |
| Institutional resistance active | Multiple | Courts still blocking -- positive indicator under pressure |

**Why this matters:** The number and severity of simultaneous flags is unusual. Most backsliding cases show 2-4 active flags. Eight simultaneous flags indicates multiple reinforcing erosion patterns operating at once.

**3. Score Exceeds 70 -- Authoritarian Transition Zone Entry**

A DBS score above 70 indicates a system where democratic reversal through normal institutional processes becomes increasingly difficult. At this level, the question shifts from "is backsliding occurring?" to "can institutions still self-correct?"

### WATCH ALERTS

**4. Red-Line Proximity: C1 (Court Noncompliance)**

C1 is currently scored at base 2 (coerced compliance). If the pattern of compliance-only-after-SCOTUS-intervention continues and base reaches 3, the C1+B5 compound red-line triggers (+10), pushing DBS to approximately 83.

**5. Red-Line Proximity: F2 (Military Politicization)**

F2 is currently scored at base 2 (discrete politicization instances). If systematic military command reshuffling follows the domestic deployment pattern, F2 could reach base 3 (red-line trigger, +10), pushing DBS to approximately 83.

**6. 2026 Midterm Preconditions Building**

D-category saturation is currently low (31%), but infrastructure for electoral manipulation is being assembled: CISA election security frozen, election EO under litigation, election officials reporting fear of investigation. An escalation during the midterm cycle could rapidly activate D-category red-lines.

### Alert Condition Summary

| Condition | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Red-line activation | TRIGGERED | F6 active (+10) |
| High-velocity (delta>12/30d) | N/A | No prior run for comparison |
| Active diagnostic flags | TRIGGERED | 8 flags active |
| Tier concern | TRIGGERED | Score in authoritarian transition zone |
| Electoral exit blocked | CLEAR | D5=0, D6=0, D11=2 |
| Red-line proximity (C1) | WATCH | Base 2, threshold at 3 |
| Red-line proximity (F2) | WATCH | Base 2, threshold at 3 |
| Guardrail attrition | N/A | No prior run for comparison |

### Change from US Baselines

| Baseline | Score | Delta from Current | Time Span |
|----------|-------|--------------------|-----------|
| US Pre-2016 | 15 | +58 | ~10 years |
| US Trump First Term (avg) | 25 | +48 | ~5 years |
| US Biden First Term (avg) | 21 | +52 | ~1 year |

**The +52 point increase from the Biden-era baseline (21) to the current score (73) in approximately one year represents the fastest democratic deterioration in the DBS dataset for any established democracy.**

### Pattern Matching Analysis

**Most similar historical reference: Turkey 2014-2018**

The current US trajectory most closely resembles Turkey in the 2014-2018 period, during which Erdogan transitioned from competitive authoritarian governance to consolidated executive control. Key similarities:

| Feature | Turkey 2014-2018 | America 2025-2026 |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Pathway mode | executive-driven+security_dominant | executive-driven+security_dominant |
| Press freedom | Journalist arrests increasing (E1=3-5) | 170 journalist assaults, arrests of Lemon/Fort (E1=5) |
| Civil service | Purges of secular bureaucrats (F1=4) | 249,000 net federal workers lost; Schedule F (F1=5) |
| Military role | Domestic security operations (B5=3) | National Guard in 19+ states; active-duty on standby (B5=5) |
| DOJ/prosecutors | Politicized prosecution of Gulenists (C3=4) | DOJ investigating Powell, Schiff, Soros, lawmakers (C3=5) |
| Courts | Under pressure but partially functioning | Under pressure but partially functioning |
| Electoral path | Still viable (elections held 2014, 2015) | 2026 midterms upcoming; D-category low but preconditions building |

**Key differences from Turkey:**

1. **US starts with stronger judicial traditions.** The Supreme Court has blocked administration actions on military deployments, the election EO, and the Fed firing. Turkey's judiciary was more pliable by 2014.

2. **No "crisis event" pretext yet.** Turkey's 2016 coup attempt provided the pretext for emergency powers and mass purges. The US has not experienced a comparable triggering event, though the Minnesota crisis shows how quickly such pretexts can emerge.

3. **Federalism provides more resistance points.** 22+ state AGs are actively litigating against federal actions. Turkey's unitary system offered no comparable subnational resistance.

4. **Media landscape is more diverse.** Despite severe pressure, the US retains a wider range of independent media outlets than Turkey did at the comparable stage.

**Pattern NOT matching:**

The current situation does **not** closely resemble Hungary's trajectory. Hungary's consolidation was legislative-driven (using a constitutional supermajority) and proceeded through institutional capture of courts and media. The US trajectory is executive-driven with security dominance -- a fundamentally different consolidation pathway more characteristic of Turkey and Venezuela.

The situation also does **not** yet resemble Venezuela 2016, where the electoral exit was explicitly blocked through National Assembly neutralization. The US D-category (elections) remains at only 31% saturation, meaning the electoral path to change is not yet structurally foreclosed.

### Category Saturation Comparison

*Category saturation shows what percentage of the maximum possible score each domain has reached. Higher saturation means more safeguards in that domain have been compromised.*

| Category | america | US Pre-2016 | Hungary 2015 | Turkey 2014 | Turkey 2018 |
|----------|---------|-------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| A -- Emergency Narrative | 85% | 10% | 50% | 60% | 80% |
| B -- Coercive State Power | 70% | 15% | 40% | 55% | 85% |
| C -- Rule of Law & Courts | 78% | 10% | 60% | 50% | 75% |
| D -- Elections & Transfer | 31% | 20% | 55% | 40% | 70% |
| E -- Information & Media | 60% | 10% | 50% | 55% | 90% |
| F -- Security Services | 73% | 10% | 45% | 60% | 80% |

**Key observation:** The US currently shows higher saturation than Turkey 2014 in categories A, B, C, and F, but significantly lower in category D (elections). This suggests the consolidation is more advanced in executive/coercive/legal domains than in electoral manipulation -- consistent with an executive-driven pathway that has not yet turned to direct electoral subversion.

The very high A-category saturation (85%) is notable: emergency narrative framing is nearly maxed out. This is the rhetorical infrastructure that historically precedes and justifies escalation in other categories.

---

## Category Analysis

*This section examines each of the six categories that compose the DBS score, explaining what each measures and where the current risks concentrate.*

### Where the Pressure Concentrates

```
Category Saturation (% of max):

A [===================         ] 85%  Emergency Narrative
C [==================          ] 78%  Rule of Law & Courts
F [=================           ] 73%  Security Services
B [================            ] 70%  Coercive State Power
E [==============              ] 60%  Information & Media
D [=======                     ] 31%  Elections & Transfer of Power
```

The pattern is clear: Categories A, B, C, and F (narrative, coercion, courts, and security services) are all at 70%+ saturation, while Category D (elections) lags at 31%. This is the signature of **executive-driven consolidation** -- power is being concentrated through executive action, enforcement, and institutional capture, not through direct electoral manipulation.

This pattern is both a warning and a source of cautious optimism:

- **Warning:** When executive consolidation reaches this level without corresponding electoral manipulation, it typically means the regime has not yet needed to manipulate elections -- but has built the capacity to do so if needed.
- **Cautious optimism:** The low D-category means the electoral path to change remains structurally open. The 2026 midterm elections represent a critical test.

## Positive Indicators

*Not all signals are negative. This section identifies factors that could slow or reverse democratic erosion.*

### Institutional Resistance Remains Active

The "institutional resistance active" diagnostic flag is a positive indicator. Specific resistance points:

1. **Supreme Court** blocked military deployment in Chicago (Trump v. Illinois), appears likely to protect Federal Reserve independence (Trump v. Cook), and is reviewing tariff legality. All nine justices -- liberal and conservative -- expressed skepticism of unchecked executive power in the Cook arguments.

2. **Lower federal courts** have issued hundreds of adverse rulings. A federal judge permanently blocked the election executive order's proof-of-citizenship requirement. Multiple courts found Posse Comitatus Act violations.

3. **State attorneys general** in 22+ states are pursuing coordinated litigation against federal overreach.

4. **Civil society** remains active -- ACLU, Brennan Center, Democracy Forward, and others are sustaining legal challenges. Nationwide protests following the Minnesota shootings demonstrated mobilization capacity.

5. **Some bipartisan resistance** is visible, though limited. 35 House Republicans voted to override vetoes on unanimously-passed legislation. Senator Duckworth introduced the Inspectors General Independence Act.

### Constraints on Further Deterioration

- **Federalism** provides structural resistance that unitary states like Turkey and Hungary lacked
- **An independent Supreme Court** has not been captured (C8=2), despite broader judicial system pressure
- **The 2026 midterm elections** are approaching, creating a democratic accountability mechanism
- **Press freedom**, while under severe attack, is not eliminated -- independent media continue to operate and report

## Trend Analysis

*Only one run is available for the "america" topic. Trend analysis requires two or more runs.*

**Note:** No prior runs exist for the "america" topic. Run `/dbs-run america` again in 30-60 days to enable trend tracking, velocity analysis, and guardrail attrition monitoring.

**Implied trajectory from baselines:**

| Reference Point | Approx. Date | DBS | Implied Delta |
|-----------------|-------------|-----|---------------|
| US Pre-2016 baseline | ~2015 | 15 | -- |
| US Trump first term (avg) | ~2018 | 25 | +10 over ~3 years |
| US Biden first term (avg) | ~2023 | 21 | -4 over ~4 years |
| America current | 2026-01-31 | 73 | +52 over ~1 year |

The implied +52 point jump from Biden-era levels to the current score represents an extraordinary rate of change. Even accounting for the confidence band (+/-6 on the current score) and imprecision in baseline estimates, the deterioration from 2025 to 2026 is historically rapid.

## Glossary

*This section explains technical terms used throughout the report in plain language.*

### Scoring Tiers

| Tier | Score Range | What It Means |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| Normal | 0-24 | Standard democratic politics. Disagreements exist but are resolved through legitimate channels. |
| Concern | 25-39 | Some warning signs, but institutions remain functional and independent. |
| Elevated | 40-54 | Active probing of institutional limits. Democratic norms are being tested. |
| Backsliding | 55-69 | Democratic erosion is actively occurring. Multiple institutions weakened. Reversal becomes difficult. |
| Transition zone | 70-84 | Multiple democratic safeguards under strain. Outcomes not yet fixed, but reversal requires extraordinary mobilization. |
| Critical | 85-100 | Democratic governance has effectively ended. Reversal requires external pressure or regime collapse. |

### Pathway Modes

| Mode | What It Means |
|------|---------------|
| executive-driven | Power is being concentrated through presidential orders, agency directives, and personnel changes rather than legislation. |
| +security_dominant | The security apparatus (military, police, ICE) is playing a central role in the consolidation pattern. |

### Key Diagnostic Flags

| Flag | What It Means |
|------|---------------|
| Prosecutorial sword and shield | The legal system is being used as both weapon (prosecuting opponents) and shield (protecting allies). Two-tiered justice. |
| Accountability collapse | Normal mechanisms for holding power accountable -- oversight, prosecution, transparency -- are systematically failing. |
| Expertise void | Career professionals removed from government. Institutional knowledge lost. Oversight bodies lack capacity. |
| State of exception pattern | Emergency rhetoric justifies expanding executive power beyond normal constraints. Classic authoritarian consolidation pattern. |
| Institutional resistance | Courts and other institutions are actively pushing back. Positive indicator, but durability is in question. |
| Electoral oversight compromised | Press freedom impairment makes it harder to independently verify election-related information. |

### Red-Lines

| Red-Line | What It Means |
|----------|---------------|
| F6 -- Leader immunity | The leader has been placed effectively above the law through formal immunity doctrines, pardons, and captured prosecution. When activated, adds +10 to the score because voluntary restraint becomes the only remaining check. |
| C1+B5 -- Courts + Military | If courts can no longer bind executive action AND military is deployed domestically, the two most fundamental democratic safeguards have failed simultaneously. Adds +10 if triggered. |
| D5/D6/D11 -- Electoral | If election results can be manufactured, rejected, or the infrastructure attacked, the electoral path to democratic restoration closes. Adds +15 if triggered. |
| F2 -- Military loyalty | If the military serves the leader rather than the constitution, the ultimate backstop against authoritarian consolidation is removed. Adds +10 if triggered. |

### Categories

| Letter | Domain | What It Tracks |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| A | Emergency Narrative | Whether political leaders are using crisis language to justify exceptional power |
| B | Coercive State Power | Whether police, military, and enforcement agencies are being used for political purposes |
| C | Rule of Law & Courts | Whether courts, prosecutors, and oversight bodies remain independent |
| D | Elections & Transfer | Whether elections are free, fair, and their results are respected |
| E | Information & Media | Whether journalists can report freely and citizens can access reliable information |
| F | Security Services | Whether the civil service, military, and intelligence agencies serve the public or the leader |

## Executive Summary

**Bottom Line:** The United States scores 73 on the Democratic Backsliding Scorecard as of January 31, 2026, placing it in the "authoritarian transition zone." This means multiple democratic safeguards are under significant and simultaneous strain, but the situation is not irreversible.

**What Changed:** The score represents a dramatic deterioration from recent baselines. The US scored approximately 15 before 2016 (normal democratic conflict), rose to about 25 during the first Trump term (elevated concern), returned to about 21 during the Biden term, and has now jumped to 73 -- a +52 point increase in roughly one year. This is the fastest deterioration in the DBS dataset for an established democracy.

**What Is Driving the Score:** The score is driven by the breadth and depth of executive action across multiple domains simultaneously:

1. **The justice system has been weaponized** (C3=5). The DOJ is investigating the Fed Chair, a US Senator, former FBI Director, a state AG, Democratic lawmakers, and a major philanthropist -- all political opponents. Meanwhile, 1,609 pardons have shielded political allies from accountability, and the DOJ's own pardon attorney has declared its attorneys are "the President's lawyers."

2. **Oversight infrastructure has been dismantled** (C4=5). Seventeen inspectors general were fired, the council that coordinates watchdog activity has been defunded, replacement IGs are drawn from the administration's own ranks, and agencies have been directed not to cooperate with Congress's investigative arm.

3. **Military force has been deployed domestically** (B5=5). The National Guard operates across 19+ states supporting immigration enforcement, active-duty soldiers were placed on standby for deployment to Minnesota, and courts have found these deployments violate federal law. Two US citizens were killed by federal agents.

4. **Press freedom is under systematic attack** (E1=5). Journalists have been arrested, 170 reporters were assaulted in the past year (160 by law enforcement), the FCC is investigating major broadcasters, and public broadcasting has been defunded.

5. **The leader has been placed above the law** (F6=5, red-line active). The *Trump v. United States* Supreme Court ruling granted broad presidential immunity. Combined with the pardon power and DOJ capture, this creates a functional impunity system that adds +10 to the score as a red-line multiplier.

**Historical Comparison:** The current trajectory most closely resembles Turkey in the 2014-2018 period, when Erdogan was consolidating executive power through security operations, press suppression, and civil service purges. The key similarity is the pathway: executive-driven with security dominance. The key difference is that US institutions -- particularly the Supreme Court and federal courts -- are proving more resistant than their Turkish counterparts, and the federal system provides resistance points that Turkey's unitary structure lacked.

**What Is Still Working:** Courts remain the primary functioning check. The Supreme Court blocked military deployment in Chicago, is skeptical of unchecked power over the Federal Reserve, and is reviewing tariff legality. Twenty-two state attorneys general are pursuing coordinated litigation. Civil society organizations continue to file legal challenges. The 2026 midterm elections remain structurally viable as an accountability mechanism.

**What to Watch:** Three developments would significantly worsen the trajectory:

1. **Court compliance breakdown** (C1 reaching base 3). If the administration moves from grudging compliance with SCOTUS to open defiance, the C1+B5 red-line triggers, pushing the score to approximately 83. The pattern of compliance-only-after-SCOTUS-intervention is the most important single variable to monitor.

2. **2026 midterm interference.** The D-category is currently at only 31% saturation, meaning the electoral path is structurally open. But CISA has been gutted, the election executive order is still being litigated, and election officials report pervasive fear. If the administration deploys federal enforcement to deter voting in opposition areas, or contests unfavorable results, D-category checkpoints could rapidly activate.

3. **Military command politicization** (F2 reaching base 3). The domestic deployment of military forces for political purposes risks politicizing the command structure itself. If senior officers are replaced based on loyalty rather than competence, the F2 red-line triggers, and the ultimate democratic backstop -- a politically neutral military -- erodes.

**The Next Assessment:** This report establishes a baseline. The next `/dbs-run america` assessment (recommended in 30-60 days) will enable trend analysis, velocity tracking, and guardrail attrition monitoring. The key question is whether the trajectory is continuing upward, stabilizing, or beginning to reverse.
