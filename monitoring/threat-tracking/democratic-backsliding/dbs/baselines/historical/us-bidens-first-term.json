  "narrative": "The 2021-2025 baseline reflects a period of contested restoration. Following the 2021 transition, the administration prioritized the repair of democratic norms, rescinding restrictive executive orders and confirming a historically diverse judiciary to restore public trust. However, the U.S. remained classified as a 'Flawed Democracy' by major indices due to chronic legislative gridlock and the persistence of 'election deniers' in local and federal roles. While the 2024 election successfully avoided the subversion attempts seen in 2020, the overall score of 21 accounts for a 'democratic malaise' where institutions functioned but failed to resolve the underlying structural weaknesses of the previous decade.",

  "comparison_guidance": "Use this baseline to evaluate the impact of institutional stabilization efforts. Compared to the Trump first-term baseline (25), this period shows a 4-point improvement driven by the successful 2024 transfer of power and judicial restoration. However, it remains 6 points higher than the pre-2016 baseline (15), reflecting that the 'new normal' of American democracy includes higher systemic risks regarding disinformation and partisan gridlock."
