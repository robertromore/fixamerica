# Technology Policy

## Overview

Technology policy addresses how society governs the development, deployment, and use of digital technologies. As technology reshapes every aspect of American life—from how we work and communicate to how democracy functions and rights are protected—policy frameworks struggle to keep pace. The concentration of power in a handful of tech giants, the erosion of privacy, algorithmic systems that affect life outcomes, and the promises and perils of artificial intelligence demand comprehensive policy responses.
