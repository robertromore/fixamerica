# Big Tech Antitrust: Solutions

## Overview

Restoring competition in digital markets requires a multi-pronged approach combining enforcement of existing law, new legislation, structural remedies, and international coordination. This document outlines a comprehensive reform agenda addressing the root causes of platform monopolization.

## Solution Framework

### Principles for Digital Competition

1. **Competition, not regulation** - Prefer competitive markets over regulated monopolies
2. **Structure matters** - Address market structure, not just behavior
3. **Prevention over cure** - Block harmful mergers rather than unwind later
4. **Ex ante rules** - Don't wait for harm to materialize
5. **Interoperability** - Enable competition through openness
6. **Strong enforcement** - Adequate resources and authority
7. **International coordination** - Global markets need global approaches
