## Opposition Arguments

### Consumer Welfare Arguments

| Argument | Claim | Counter |
|----------|-------|---------|
| "Low prices" | Consumers benefit from free services | Privacy cost not counted |
| "Quality" | Products improve continuously | Quality degradation post-acquisition documented |
| "Choice" | Consumers can switch | Switching costs high; lock-in real |
| "Innovation" | Big Tech invests heavily | Acquisition ≠ innovation; kill zones documented |

### Economic Arguments

| Argument | Claim | Counter |
|----------|-------|---------|
| "Efficiency" | Scale creates efficiencies | Efficiency at cost of competition |
| "Natural monopoly" | Some markets tip to winners | Policy can affect outcomes |
| "Competition exists" | Big Tech competes with each other | Different markets; limited overlap |
| "Low barriers" | "Competition is a click away" | Network effects, switching costs |

### Innovation Arguments

| Argument | Claim | Counter |
|----------|-------|---------|
| "R&D investment" | Big Tech invests billions | Monopoly profits fund R&D; doesn't justify dominance |
| "Breakup harms innovation" | Scale needed for innovation | Pre-breakup AT&T also innovated; Bell Labs continued |
| "Uncertainty chills investment" | Enforcement uncertainty harmful | Monopoly power more harmful |
| "Startups benefit" | Big Tech acquires startups | Acquisition ≠ competition; kill zone effect |

### Competitiveness Arguments

| Argument | Claim | Counter |
|----------|-------|---------|
| "China will win" | Breaking up helps China | China also regulating; competition strengthens |
| "National champions" | Need strong US companies | Competition improves performance |
| "Global scale needed" | US platforms succeed globally | Success despite monopoly, not because of it |

### Legal/Doctrinal Arguments

| Argument | Claim | Counter |
|----------|-------|---------|
| "Current law works" | Just enforce existing law better | Doctrines inadequate for digital markets |
| "No precedent" | Novel theories untested | Law should evolve |
| "Overreach" | Agencies exceeding authority | Agencies using existing authority |
| "Due process" | Companies deserve fair process | Cases follow procedures |

### Unintended Consequences Arguments

| Argument | Claim | Counter |
|----------|-------|---------|
| "Hurt small business" | Regulations burden small players | Target dominant platforms, exempt small |
| "Stifle startups" | Less acqui-hire opportunity | Independent competition better |
| "Balkanization" | Interoperability requirements fragment | Interoperability expands competition |
| "Security risks" | Breaking up creates vulnerabilities | Concentration creates different risks |
