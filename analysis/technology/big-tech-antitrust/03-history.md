# Big Tech Antitrust: History

## Overview

The rise of Big Tech market power and the evolution of antitrust response reflect broader shifts in economic thought, technological change, and political economy. Understanding this history illuminates why current enforcement has proven inadequate and what lessons past experiences offer.

## Timeline of Market Development

### The PC Era (1980s-1990s)

## Evolution of Antitrust Doctrine

### Chicago School Transformation (1970s-1980s)

**Before Chicago School:**
- Antitrust protected competition broadly
- Structure matters (concentrated markets problematic)
- Political and economic concerns both relevant
- Breakups used as remedy

**Chicago School influence:**
- Consumer welfare as sole goal
- Efficiency justifies concentration
- Low prices = no harm
- Behavioral economics rejected
- Skepticism of enforcement

**Key figures:**
- Robert Bork (*The Antitrust Paradox*, 1978)
- Richard Posner
- Frank Easterbrook

**Effect:**
- Enforcement declined dramatically
- Vertical integration permitted
- Mergers rarely blocked
- Focus on price effects only

### The Antitrust Paradox in Tech

**Problems applying Chicago School to digital:**

| Concept | Traditional | Digital |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Price | Easy to measure | Zero-price services |
| Harm | Consumer prices | Privacy, quality, innovation |
| Competition | Within markets | For markets (winner-take-all) |
| Efficiency | Static | Dynamic (innovation matters) |
| Entry barriers | Capital, regulation | Network effects, data |

### Neo-Brandeisian Revival (2010s)

**Key arguments:**
- Concentration harmful beyond consumer prices
- Democracy concerns relevant
- Structure matters
- Current enforcement inadequate
- Platform power requires new tools

**Key figures:**
- Lina Khan ("Amazon's Antitrust Paradox," 2017)
- Tim Wu (*The Curse of Bigness*, 2018)
- Zephyr Teachout
- Barry Lynn

**Influence:**
- Shaped Biden administration appointments
- Informed Congressional investigation
- Increased enforcement activity
- Legislative proposals

## History of Major Cases

### Microsoft (1998-2001)

**Timeline:**
- 1998: DOJ + states file suit
- 1999: Trial concludes
- 2000: Judge Jackson orders breakup
- 2001: Appeals court overturns remedy
- 2001: Settlement preserves company

**Lessons:**
- Cases take years
- Remedies difficult to enforce
- Technology moves faster than courts
- Settlement may be inadequate

### FTC v. Intel (2009-2010)

**Settlement:** Behavioral remedies, no structural change

**Lesson:** Behavioral fixes often inadequate

### EU v. Google (2010-2019)

| Case | Fine | Issue | Effect |
|------|------|-------|--------|
| Shopping | €2.4B | Self-preferencing | Ineffective remedy |
| Android | €4.3B | Bundling | Modified practices |
| AdSense | €1.5B | Exclusive contracts | Minor changes |

**Lessons:**
- EU more aggressive than US
- Fines absorbed as cost of doing business
- Behavioral remedies insufficient
- Structural remedies needed

### FTC v. Facebook/Meta (2020-2024)

**Claims:** Instagram, WhatsApp acquisitions were anticompetitive

**Status:** Dismissed; acquisition standard not met years later

**Lesson:** Challenging completed mergers extremely difficult

## Evolution of Acquisition Review

### Historical Patterns

| Era | Approach | Major Tech Mergers |
|-----|----------|-------------------|
| 1980s-90s | Permissive | Few major tech deals |
| 2000s | Permissive | Google-DoubleClick approved |
| 2010s | Very permissive | FB-Instagram, FB-WhatsApp approved |
| 2020s | Somewhat tighter | Some challenges, most approved |

### "Kill Zone" Development

**Pattern identified:**
1. Startup threatens platform
2. Platform acquires startup
3. Product integrated or killed
4. Competition eliminated

**Examples:**
- Instagram (potential competitor → integrated)
- WhatsApp (messaging alternative → integrated)
- Waze (maps competitor → integrated)

## Legislative History

### Major Antitrust Laws

| Law | Year | Relevance |
|-----|------|-----------|
| Sherman Act | 1890 | Monopolization prohibition |
| Clayton Act | 1914 | Merger review |
| FTC Act | 1914 | Unfair practices |
| Hart-Scott-Rodino | 1976 | Pre-merger notification |

### Recent Legislative Efforts

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 2019-2020 | House investigation |
| 2021 | Bipartisan bills introduced |
| 2022 | Bills advance in committee |
| 2022-23 | Stalled without floor votes |
| 2024 | Limited activity |

**Why legislation stalled:**
- Industry lobbying
- Partisan disagreements
- Leadership priorities
- Complexity of issues

## International History

### EU Development

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 2004 | Microsoft case (interoperability) |

| 2017-19 | €9B+ in Google fines |
| 2020 | DMA proposed |
| 2022 | DMA adopted |
| 2024 | DMA enforcement begins |

### Other Jurisdictions

| UK | DMU proposed, CMA active |
| India | Google investigations, remedies |
| South Korea | App store laws (2021) |

## Historical Lessons

### What History Teaches

1. **Speed matters** - Cases take too long
2. **Remedies matter** - Behavioral fixes often fail
3. **Acquisition review critical** - Blocking easier than undoing
4. **International coordination helps** - EU often leads
5. **Legal doctrine evolves slowly** - Courts lag technology
6. **Political economy matters** - Enforcement waxes and wanes
7. **Structure shapes behavior** - Dominant positions are abused

### Parallels to Past

| Historical Case | Modern Parallel |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Standard Oil (1911) | Potential platform breakups |
| AT&T breakup (1984) | Network monopoly dissolution |
| Microsoft (2001) | Tech monopoly, weak remedy |
| Paramount decrees (1948) | Vertical integration limits |
