Congress finds that—
    (1) dominant platforms have acquired hundreds of companies over
    the past two decades;
    (2) many acquisitions eliminated nascent or potential competitors;
    (3) current merger review has failed to prevent anticompetitive

platform operator of a company that—
    (1) operates in a market in which the covered platform operates;

    covered platform operates;
    (3) could potentially compete with the covered platform; or

shall be presumed to be anticompetitive.

(b) REBUTTAL.—The presumption under subsection (a) may be rebutted
only if the acquiring company demonstrates by clear and convincing
evidence that—
    (1) the acquisition would not lessen competition or tend to
    create a monopoly;

    with the covered platform; and
    (3) the efficiencies from the acquisition outweigh any harm
    to competition.

    incentives to self-preference;

    advertising platform) and a sell-side platform (such as a supply-
    side advertising platform);

    (3) operate both a marketplace and sell products on that
    marketplace under its own brand; or

    (4) own or control the primary means of distribution for an
    application ecosystem while also offering applications that

compliance with this section within 3 years of designation or

## Constitutional Considerations

### Due Process

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| **Vagueness** | Terms must be sufficiently clear |
| **Retroactivity** | New rules prospective |

### First Amendment

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| **Platform speech** | Economic regulation, not speech restriction |
| **Compelled carriage** | Content-neutral business rules |
| **Must-carry precedent** | Turner Broadcasting supports regulation |

### Takings

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| **Divestiture** | Not taking if compensation through sale |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|

| **International gaps** | Arbitrage possible | Jurisdiction |
| **Political capture** | Weakened implementation | Lobbying |

### Rectification Procedures

3. **Mandatory disclosure** enabling verification
4. **Private enforcement** supplementing agency action
5. **Regular review** and update mechanisms
6. **Technical advisory** capacity for agencies
7. **International coordination** to prevent arbitrage
8. **Whistleblower protections** and incentives
9. **Piercing provisions** for subsidiary structures
10. **Penalty escalation** for repeat violations

### General Implementation Concerns

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
