# Data Privacy: Overview

The United States lacks comprehensive federal privacy legislation, leaving Americans with fewer protections than citizens of most peer democracies. A fragmented patchwork of sector-specific laws and state regulations fails to address the systematic collection, use, and sale of personal data that has become the foundation of the digital economy. This "surveillance capitalism" model extracts value from intimate details of people's lives while exposing them to manipulation, discrimination, and security risks.
