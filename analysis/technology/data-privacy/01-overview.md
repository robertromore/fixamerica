# Data Privacy: Overview

## Executive Summary

The United States lacks comprehensive federal privacy legislation, leaving Americans with fewer protections than citizens of most peer democracies. A fragmented patchwork of sector-specific laws and state regulations fails to address the systematic collection, use, and sale of personal data that has become the foundation of the digital economy. This "surveillance capitalism" model extracts value from intimate details of people's lives while exposing them to manipulation, discrimination, and security risks.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Data collection practices** by companies and governments
- **Privacy rights** and their current legal status
- **Data brokers** and the secondary data market
- **Consumer tracking** and behavioral profiling
- **Privacy legislation** at federal and state levels
- **Enforcement mechanisms** and their effectiveness
- **International privacy frameworks** and their lessons

## Key Questions

1. Why does the US lack comprehensive privacy legislation?
2. What data is collected about Americans and how is it used?
3. Who profits from the collection and sale of personal data?
4. What harms result from current data practices?
5. What rights should individuals have over their data?
6. How should privacy laws be enforced?
7. How do US protections compare to international standards?

## Key Statistics

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Data broker industry revenue | $250+ billion | Various estimates |
| Companies holding data on average American | 4,000+ | VPPA estimates |
| States with comprehensive privacy laws | 15+ | IAPP (2024) |
| Americans concerned about privacy | 79% | Pew Research |
| Data breaches annually | 3,200+ | ITRC |
| Records exposed annually | 400+ million | ITRC |
| Price of location data (per person) | <$1 | Industry reports |

## Current State Summary

**Legal landscape:**
- No comprehensive federal privacy law
- Sector-specific laws (HIPAA, FCRA, COPPA, GLBA, FERPA)
- State laws expanding (California, Virginia, Colorado, etc.)
- FTC enforcement limited

**Market practices:**
- Surveillance advertising as business model
- Data brokers collect and sell everything
- Location tracking ubiquitous
- Dark patterns extract consent
- Data breaches frequent

**Consumer reality:**
- Privacy policies unread and unreadable
- Opt-out options buried
- No meaningful consent
- No practical alternatives
- Data follows people forever

## The Stakes

**If privacy remains unprotected:**
- Surveillance capitalism expands
- Manipulation becomes more sophisticated
- Discrimination enabled by data
- Security risks grow
- Autonomy and dignity erode
- Democracy threatened by targeting

**If strong privacy is enacted:**
- Individuals control their data
- Business models shift
- Discrimination harder
- Security improves
- Trust restored
- Digital dignity protected

## Core Harms

### Economic Harms

| Harm | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| Discrimination | Data enables differential pricing, access |
| Manipulation | Personalized influence |
| Security costs | Breach response, identity theft |
| Market failure | Consumers can't value privacy |

### Social Harms

| Harm | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| Chilling effects | Self-censorship due to surveillance |
| Power asymmetry | Companies know everything; individuals know nothing |
| Autonomy loss | Nudged and manipulated |
| Relationship damage | Surveillance affects intimacy |

### Democratic Harms

| Harm | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| Voter manipulation | Micro-targeted political ads |
| Government surveillance | Data purchases bypass 4th Amendment |
| Journalism threats | Source protection undermined |
| Activism chilled | Surveillance of organizers |

## Reform Approaches

| Approach | Proponents | Key Features |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| **Comprehensive rights** | Privacy advocates | EU-style omnibus law |
| **Sector-specific** | Some industry | Expand existing laws |
| **State patchwork** | State legislators | California model |
| **Self-regulation** | Tech industry | Voluntary standards |
| **Property rights** | Some scholars | Data as property |
