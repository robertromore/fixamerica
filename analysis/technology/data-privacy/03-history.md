## Evolution of Privacy Concepts

### Fair Information Practices (1973)

Original HEW principles:
1. No secret data systems
2. Individual access to records
3. Individual consent for use
4. Individual correction rights
5. Organization accountability

### OECD Guidelines (1980)

Expanded to eight principles:
1. Collection limitation
2. Data quality
3. Purpose specification
4. Use limitation
5. Security safeguards
6. Openness
7. Individual participation
8. Accountability

### GDPR Principles (2016)

Modern comprehensive approach:
1. Lawfulness, fairness, transparency
2. Purpose limitation
3. Data minimization
4. Accuracy
5. Storage limitation
6. Integrity and confidentiality
7. Accountability

## Lessons from History

### What History Teaches

1. **Industry opposes regulation** - Consistent pattern
2. **Self-regulation fails** - Voluntary measures insufficient
3. **Sector-specific creates gaps** - Patchwork doesn't work
4. **Technology outpaces law** - Lag is structural
5. **Scandals create windows** - Crises enable action
6. **State action pressures federal** - California leads
7. **International standards matter** - EU creates pressure

### Historical Parallels

| Issue | Past Parallel | Lesson |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| Data collection | Wiretapping | Technology requires updating law |
| Self-regulation | Financial industry | Voluntary measures fail |
| Sector-specific | Environmental | Comprehensive approach needed |
| Consumer protection | Product safety | Information asymmetry requires regulation |
