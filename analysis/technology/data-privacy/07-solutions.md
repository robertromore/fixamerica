# Data Privacy: Solutions

## Overview

Meaningful data privacy protection requires comprehensive federal legislation, strong enforcement, and structural changes to data markets. This document outlines a reform agenda addressing collection practices, individual rights, enforcement mechanisms, and the data broker industry.

## Solution Framework

### Core Principles

1. **Data minimization** - Collect only what's needed
2. **Purpose limitation** - Use only for stated purposes
3. **Consent meaning** - Real choice, not buried notices

5. **Strong enforcement** - Agency + private rights
