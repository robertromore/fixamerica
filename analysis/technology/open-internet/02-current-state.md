# Open Internet: Current State

## Overview

The open internet in the United States exists in a state of regulatory uncertainty and increasing fragmentation. Net neutrality rules were repealed in 2017, though the FCC voted to restore them in 2024 (with litigation pending). Meanwhile, states have enacted their own rules, platforms exercise enormous power over online speech, and broadband providers continue consolidating while facing limited competition.
