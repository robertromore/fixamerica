# Open Internet: Overview

## Executive Summary

The open internet—characterized by net neutrality, free expression, and equal access—faces unprecedented challenges from commercial consolidation, government regulation, and platform gatekeeping. As the internet has become essential infrastructure for economic activity, political participation, and social connection, debates over its governance have intensified. The U.S. has oscillated between regulatory approaches, creating uncertainty that affects innovation, competition, and users' rights. Preserving an open internet requires addressing broadband providers' control over access, platforms' power over content, and governments' increasing interest in regulating online speech.
