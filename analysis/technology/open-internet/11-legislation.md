| **Preemption** | Federal authority over state laws |
| **Municipal broadband** | State vs. federal authority |

### First Amendment

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| **ISP speech** | Limited editorial discretion recognized |
| **Compelled access** | Generally permitted for infrastructure |
| **Platform speech** | Strong First Amendment protection |
| **Transparency mandates** | Compelled commercial speech |

### Takings Clause

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| **Network access** | Not a physical taking |
| **Rate regulation** | Requires reasonable return |
| **Franchise requirements** | Constitutional if reasonable |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| **Litigation delays** | Years of uncertainty | Judicial review |
| **Platform gaps** | Limited accountability | First Amendment concerns |
| **International gaps** | No jurisdiction offshore | Sovereignty |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Comprehensive definitions** covering all access technologies
2. **Clear interconnection authority** with dispute resolution
3. **Zero-rating prohibition** or strict limits
4. **Specialized services narrowly defined** with oversight
5. **Reasonable management** guidance with examples
6. **Graduated platform thresholds** avoiding cliff effects
7. **Statutory codification** for durability
8. **Adequate enforcement funding** dedicated resources
9. **Expedited judicial review** timelines
10. **Platform accountability expansion** as constitutionally permitted

### General Implementation Concerns

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| **Political durability** | Bipartisan coalition, public support |
| **Enforcement capacity** | Dedicated funding, staff |
| **Technological change** | Flexible, technology-neutral rules |
| **International coordination** | Bilateral and multilateral engagement |
