# Digital Divide: Root Causes

## Overview

The digital divide persists due to market economics, policy failures, industry concentration, structural inequality, and inadequate attention to adoption barriers beyond infrastructure.

## Market Failures

### Natural Monopoly Economics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|

## Geographic Factors

### Rural Economics

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Low population density | High per-customer cost |
| Distance from nodes | Long runs expensive |
| Terrain | Mountains, forests difficult |
| Climate | Weather challenges |

### Urban Neglect

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Low-income areas | Less profitable |
| Old buildings | Infrastructure difficult |
| Rental housing | Landlord barriers |
| Digital redlining | Selective deployment |

## Socioeconomic Factors

### Income and Wealth

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Service costs | Unaffordable |
| Device costs | Can't afford equipment |

## Institutional Factors

### Government Capacity

| Gap | Impact |
|-----|--------|

| Pattern | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Overpromise, underdeliver | Subsidies without buildout |
| Data manipulation | Inflated coverage claims |
| Subsidy capture | Pocket public funds |

## Structural Lock-In

### Infrastructure Legacy

| Factor | Impact |
