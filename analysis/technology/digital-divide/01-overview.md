# Digital Divide: Overview

## Executive Summary

Despite broadband's essential role in modern life, tens of millions of Americans lack reliable, affordable internet access. The digital divide disproportionately affects rural communities, low-income households, communities of color, and older Americans, limiting access to education, healthcare, employment, and civic participation. Closing the divide requires substantial infrastructure investment, affordability programs, digital literacy initiatives, and competition promotion.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Broadband infrastructure** gaps in rural and urban areas
- **Affordability barriers** preventing adoption
- **Digital literacy** and skill gaps
- **Device access** limitations
- **Competition** and market structure
- **Adoption** disparities across demographics
- **Federal programs** and their effectiveness
- **State and local** initiatives

## Key Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Americans without broadband | 21-42 million (varies by definition) |
| Rural without broadband | 17% of rural areas |
| Tribal without broadband | 33% of Tribal lands |
| Households unable to afford | 15-20% |
| Seniors without home internet | 25%+ |
| Broadband adoption gap (income) | 40 percentage points |
