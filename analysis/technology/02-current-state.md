# Technology Policy: Current State

## Overview

American technology policy faces a governance crisis as digital systems increasingly mediate economic activity, social interaction, and democratic participation. The federal government lacks comprehensive frameworks for privacy, AI, and platform accountability, while market power concentrates in a handful of dominant firms. State-level action and international developments highlight federal inaction.
