# Surveillance Technology: Overview

## Executive Summary

Government and private surveillance technologies have proliferated without adequate legal frameworks, oversight, or accountability. Facial recognition, location tracking, social media monitoring, predictive policing, and other surveillance tools threaten privacy, civil liberties, and disproportionately impact marginalized communities. Comprehensive reform requires technology-specific regulations, enhanced oversight, meaningful restrictions, and civil rights protections.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Facial recognition** in law enforcement and public spaces
- **Location tracking** through cell phones and devices
- **Social media monitoring** by government agencies
- **Predictive policing** and algorithmic surveillance
- **License plate readers** and vehicle tracking
- **Aerial surveillance** including drones
- **Biometric collection** and databases
- **Communications surveillance** and wiretapping
- **Private sector surveillance** sold to government

## Key Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Federal facial recognition searches annually | 1+ million |
| Law enforcement agencies with facial recognition | 3,100+ |
| License plate readers deployed | 500 million+ scans/month |
| Cell site simulators in use | 75+ agencies |
| Social media surveillance contracts | Hundreds |
| Americans in facial recognition databases | 117+ million |

## Core Problems

### Lack of Regulation

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| No federal facial recognition law | Uncontrolled proliferation |
| Weak wiretap law updates | Technology outpaced |
| No drone surveillance rules | Privacy erosion |
| Inadequate location protections | Pervasive tracking |

### Civil Rights Impacts

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Racial bias in facial recognition | Disproportionate misidentification |
| Over-surveillance of communities of color | Civil liberties violations |
| Chilling effect on First Amendment | Protest suppression |
| Immigration enforcement | Family separation |

### Lack of Accountability

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Secret use | Public unaware |
| No audit requirements | Abuse undetected |
| Qualified immunity | No accountability |
| Inadequate remedies | Victims without recourse |

### Technology Proliferation

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Federal grants fund surveillance | Spreads to local agencies |
| Private vendors | Minimal oversight |
| Data sharing | Expands reach |
| Lack of standards | Quality problems |

## Stakeholder Landscape

| Stakeholder | Interest |
|-------------|----------|
| Law enforcement | Investigative tools |
| Civil liberties groups | Rights protection |
| Communities of color | End over-surveillance |
| Privacy advocates | Individual rights |
| Surveillance vendors | Market access |
| Oversight bodies | Accountability |

## Reform Approaches

| Approach | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Bans** | Prohibit certain technologies |
| **Moratoriums** | Pause pending study |
| **Regulation** | Use restrictions, oversight |
| **Transparency** | Public reporting requirements |
| **Accountability** | Audit, remedy mechanisms |

## Political Landscape

| Position | Supporters |
|----------|------------|
| Strong restrictions | Civil liberties groups, progressives |
| Balanced regulation | Some moderates |
| Self-regulation | Industry, some law enforcement |
| Minimal restrictions | Law enforcement advocates |
