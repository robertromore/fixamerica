### Academic Opposition

**Some researchers argue:**

## Opposition Arguments

### Innovation Arguments

| Argument | Claim | Counter |
|----------|-------|---------|
| "Kills innovation" | Regulation slows development | Well-designed rules can enhance innovation |
| "Hurts startups" | Only big companies can comply | Tiered requirements address this |
| "Premature" | Don't know what to regulate | We know some harms already |
| "Too broad" | AI is too general to regulate | Can target specific applications |

### Competitiveness Arguments

| Argument | Claim | Counter |
|----------|-------|---------|
| "China will win" | Regulation handicaps US | China also regulating; race is long |
| "Offshore flight" | Companies will relocate | Major markets require presence |
| "Lose leadership" | Other countries will lead | Leadership includes safety leadership |

### Technical Arguments

| Argument | Claim | Counter |
|----------|-------|---------|
| "Can't define AI" | Too broad/narrow definitions | Risk-based approach addresses this |
| "Technology neutral" | Shouldn't target AI | Unique characteristics warrant attention |
| "Already regulated" | Existing laws sufficient | Gaps exist; AI creates new challenges |

### Overreach Arguments

| Argument | Claim | Counter |
|----------|-------|---------|
| "Free speech concerns" | AI restrictions are censorship | Commercial AI isn't core speech |
| "Chilling effect" | Researchers will self-censor | Can exempt research |
| "Mission creep" | Will expand to all software | Defined scope addresses this |

### Unintended Consequences

| Argument | Claim | Counter |
|----------|-------|---------|
| "Regulatory capture" | Big tech will control rules | Design to prevent; civil society input |
| "Entrench incumbents" | Compliance costs favor big players | Tiered approach; open access |
| "Stifle open source" | Requirements burden open developers | Exemptions for non-commercial |

## Opposition Tactics

### Lobbying

**Direct lobbying:**
