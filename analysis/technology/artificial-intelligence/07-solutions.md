# Artificial Intelligence: Solutions

## Overview

Effective AI governance requires a multi-layered approach addressing immediate harms, emerging risks, and long-term challenges. This document outlines a comprehensive reform agenda spanning federal legislation, agency action, state policy, international coordination, and structural changes to the AI ecosystem.

## Solution Framework

### Principles for AI Governance

1. **Risk-proportionate** - Regulation scaled to potential harm
2. **Adaptive** - Mechanisms to update as technology evolves
3. **Transparent** - Public visibility into AI systems and governance
4. **Accountable** - Clear liability and enforcement
5. **Inclusive** - Affected communities have voice
6. **International** - Coordination with allies and competitors
7. **Rights-preserving** - Protect civil rights and liberties
8. **Innovation-enabling** - Don't unnecessarily stifle beneficial development
