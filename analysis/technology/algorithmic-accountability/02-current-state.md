# Algorithmic Accountability: Current State

## Overview

Algorithmic decision systems have proliferated across virtually every sector affecting Americans' lives, operating largely without transparency, accountability, or meaningful oversight despite growing evidence of discriminatory impacts and errors.

## Documented Harms

### Discrimination Cases

| Case | Finding |
|------|---------|

| Healthcare algorithm | Underestimated Black patient needs |
| Facial recognition | Higher error rates for dark-skinned faces |
| Tenant screening | Criminal record discrimination |
| Ad targeting | Housing, job ads excluded protected groups |
| Pretrial risk tools | Racial disparities in predictions |

### Error Impacts

| Context | Harm |
|---------|------|
| Benefits denials | Eligible people lose support |
| False fraud flags | Accounts frozen, benefits cut |
| Misidentification | Wrongful arrests |
| Credit errors | Loan denials, higher rates |
| Healthcare denials | Delayed or denied care |

## Regulatory Landscape

### Federal

| Agency | Action |
|--------|--------|
| FTC | Limited enforcement on unfair practices |
| CFPB | Fair lending, credit reporting |
| EEOC | Employment discrimination (limited) |
| HUD | Fair housing enforcement |
| DOJ | Civil rights division |

### State

| State | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Illinois | BIPA (biometrics), AI hiring law |
| California | CCPA/CPRA, proposed AI rules |
| New York City | Local Law 144 (hiring algorithms) |
| Colorado | AI insurance law |
| Others | Emerging legislation |

### Gaps

| Gap | Impact |
|-----|--------|
| No comprehensive federal law | Patchwork, uncertainty |
| Inadequate enforcement resources | Limited oversight |
| Trade secret protections | Block transparency |
| Technical expertise | Regulators lack capacity |
| Existing law ambiguity | Unclear application |

## Industry Practices

| Public reporting | Very rare |

### Redress

| Practice | Prevalence |
|----------|------------|
| Human review available | Often limited |
| Appeal processes | Variable |
| Explanation of decisions | Rare |
| Correction mechanisms | Limited |

## Academic Findings
