# Emerging Technologies: Overview

## Executive Summary

Emerging technologies including quantum computing, biotechnology, autonomous systems, brain-computer interfaces, and advanced materials present transformative opportunities and significant risks. Current governance frameworks are inadequate to address the pace and scope of technological change, creating regulatory gaps that allow risks to accumulate while potentially stifling beneficial innovation. Proactive, adaptive governance is needed to ensure emerging technologies benefit society while minimizing harms.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Quantum computing** and cryptography implications
- **Biotechnology** including gene editing and synthetic biology
- **Autonomous systems** beyond vehicles (drones, weapons, robots)
- **Brain-computer interfaces** and neurotechnology
- **Advanced materials** and nanotechnology
- **Space technologies** and governance
- **Extended reality** (VR, AR, metaverse)
- **Nuclear fusion** and advanced energy
- **Governance frameworks** for emerging technologies
