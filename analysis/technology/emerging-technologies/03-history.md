# Emerging Technologies: History

## Overview

The governance of emerging technologies has evolved through successive technological revolutions, with regulatory frameworks typically lagging behind technological development and often arising only after significant harms.

## Historical Patterns

### Technology Governance Cycles

| Phase | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------------|
| 1. Innovation | Technology develops largely unregulated |
| 2. Proliferation | Adoption spreads, issues emerge |
| 3. Crisis/scandal | Harm triggers attention |
| 4. Reaction | Regulation enacted |
| 5. Adaptation | Rules adjusted over time |

### Examples of the Cycle

| Technology | Crisis | Regulation |
|------------|--------|------------|
| Nuclear | Weapons, accidents | NRC, treaties |
| Pharmaceuticals | Thalidomide | FDA strengthening |
| Chemicals | Environmental damage | EPA, TSCA |
| Biotech | Asilomar concerns | NIH guidelines |
| Internet | Privacy, security issues | Ongoing |

## Key Historical Developments

### Nuclear Era (1940s-1970s)

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1945 | Nuclear weapons used |
| 1946 | Atomic Energy Act |
| 1954 | Atoms for Peace |
| 1957 | IAEA established |
| 1963 | Limited Test Ban Treaty |
| 1968 | Non-Proliferation Treaty |
| 1974 | NRC created |
| 1979 | Three Mile Island |

**Lessons**: International cooperation possible; regulation follows catastrophe; dual-use governance complex.

### Biotech Revolution (1970s-2000s)

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1973 | Recombinant DNA achieved |
| 1975 | Asilomar Conference |
| 1976 | NIH Recombinant DNA Guidelines |
| 1980 | Diamond v. Chakrabarty (patents) |
| 1986 | Coordinated Framework |
| 1990 | Human Genome Project begins |
| 2000 | Cartagena Protocol |
| 2003 | Human genome sequenced |

**Lessons**: Scientist-led moratorium possible; coordinated governance works; international frameworks needed.

### Information Age (1990s-2010s)

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1991 | World Wide Web public |
| 1996 | Communications Decency Act (Section 230) |
| 1998 | DMCA |
| 2000 | Dot-com boom/bust |
| 2001 | PATRIOT Act |
| 2013 | Snowden disclosures |
| 2018 | GDPR |
| 2016-present | Platform regulation debates |

**Lessons**: Early governance choices persist; international divergence grows; retroactive regulation difficult.

### Recent Developments (2010s-Present)

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 2012 | CRISPR editing demonstrated |
| 2016 | AlphaGo defeats human champion |
| 2018 | He Jiankui germline editing scandal |
| 2019 | Google claims quantum supremacy |
| 2020 | COVID accelerates biotech, digital |
| 2022 | ChatGPT released |
| 2022 | NIF ignition achieved |
| 2023 | AI governance debates intensify |

## Governance Evolution

### From Reactive to Proactive

| Era | Approach |
|-----|----------|
| Pre-1970s | Minimal anticipation |
| 1970s-1990s | Technology assessment emerges |
| 1990s-2010s | Risk assessment expands |
| 2010s-present | Anticipatory governance debates |

### International Frameworks

| Framework | Year | Focus |
|-----------|------|-------|
| Outer Space Treaty | 1967 | Space governance |
| NPT | 1968 | Nuclear |
| BWC | 1972 | Biological weapons |
| UNCLOS | 1982 | Oceans |
| Cartagena Protocol | 2000 | Biosafety |
| Paris Agreement | 2015 | Climate |
| Various AI initiatives | 2020s | AI governance |

### US Institutional Development

| Institution | Year | Role |
|-------------|------|------|
| AEC/NRC | 1946/1974 | Nuclear |
| NIH | 1930/expanded | Biomedical |
| NSF | 1950 | Research |
| EPA | 1970 | Environment |
| OSTP | 1976 | Science policy |
| OTA | 1972-1995 | Technology assessment |
| DARPA | 1958 | Defense research |
| DOE | 1977 | Energy, nuclear |

## Lessons from History

### What Worked

| Success | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Scientist self-governance | Asilomar |
| International cooperation | Nuclear, bioweapons |
| Dedicated agencies | FDA, NRC effectiveness |
| Early intervention | Better than reactive |
| Public engagement | Legitimacy |

### What Failed

| Failure | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Waiting for crisis | Recurring pattern |
| Siloed approaches | Gaps between agencies |
| Ignoring dual use | Weapons proliferation |
| Underestimating pace | Consistent error |
| Industry self-regulation | Limited effectiveness |

### Persistent Challenges

| Challenge | Persistence |
|-----------|-------------|
| Regulatory lag | Every technology |
| Expertise gaps | Ongoing |
| International coordination | Variable |
| Democratic engagement | Difficult |
| Balancing innovation/safety | Permanent tension |
