## Constitutional Considerations

### Commerce Clause

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| **Immigration** | Federal plenary power |
| **Labor standards** | Commerce power |
| **Education** | State authority, federal conditional spending |
| **Non-competes** | Interstate commerce nexus |

### Preemption

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| **Immigration** | Federal exclusive |
| **Labor** | Floor, not ceiling |
| **Non-competes** | Express preemption possible |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Independent contractor** | Reclassify to avoid | High |
| **Non-compete alternatives** | Garden leave, etc. | Medium |
| **Offshore hiring** | Avoid visa constraints | Medium |
| **Subsidiary structures** | Avoid size thresholds | Low |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| **Enforcement capacity** | Violations unpunished | Resources |
| **Political opposition** | Reform blocked | Politics |
| **Implementation timeline** | Slow progress | Complexity |
| **International competition** | Talent goes elsewhere | Global |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Functional classification** tests
2. **Anti-evasion provisions** for non-competes
3. **Adequate enforcement funding** tied to industry
4. **Regular updates** for changing technology
5. **International coordination** to prevent arbitrage
6. **Phased implementation** with clear milestones
7. **Outcome metrics** for accountability
8. **Private enforcement** supplementing government
9. **Whistleblower protections** for violations
