# Technology Workforce: Overview

## Executive Summary

The United States faces significant technology workforce challenges including skills shortages in critical fields, lack of diversity, geographic concentration, educational pipeline gaps, and worker protection issues. Addressing these challenges requires comprehensive reform of education and training systems, immigration policy, workplace protections, and geographic distribution strategies.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Skills gaps** in cybersecurity, AI, and other critical fields
- **Workforce diversity** and barriers to entry
- **Education and training** pathways
- **Immigration** and H-1B visa policy
- **Worker rights** and contractor classification
- **Geographic concentration** in tech hubs
- **Automation** and workforce displacement
- **Lifelong learning** and reskilling

## Key Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Cybersecurity workforce gap | 500,000+ unfilled positions |
| Tech unemployment | Under 3% |
| Women in tech | 26% |
| Black workers in tech | 8% |
| Hispanic workers in tech | 8% |
| Tech jobs requiring bachelor's | 50%+ |
| H-1B visa cap | 85,000 annually |
