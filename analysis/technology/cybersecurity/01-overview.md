# Cybersecurity: Overview

## Executive Summary

The United States faces persistent and growing cybersecurity threats from nation-states, criminal organizations, and other malicious actors. Critical infrastructure, government systems, businesses, and individuals are all vulnerable. Despite decades of attention, fundamental problems persist: inadequate investment, workforce shortages, fragmented authority, and misaligned incentives that leave systems insecure. Addressing these challenges requires systemic reform combining regulation, investment, and institutional development.

## Scope

This analysis covers:

- **Critical infrastructure protection** - Energy, water, healthcare, financial systems
- **Government cybersecurity** - Federal, state, local systems
- **Private sector security** - Corporate and small business
- **Consumer security** - Personal devices and data
- **Cyber workforce** - Talent pipeline and capacity
- **Threat landscape** - Nation-states, criminals, hacktivists
- **Policy frameworks** - Laws, regulations, standards

## Key Questions

1. Why do cyberattacks continue despite decades of attention?
2. How should government and private sector share responsibility?
3. What role should regulation play in improving security?
4. How do we address the workforce shortage?
5. How should the US respond to nation-state cyber threats?
6. What liability regime would improve incentives?
7. How do we secure critical infrastructure?

## Key Statistics

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Global cybercrime cost (2024) | $8+ trillion | Cybersecurity Ventures |
| US data breaches (2023) | 3,200+ | ITRC |
| Average breach cost | $4.5 million | IBM |
| Ransomware attacks (2023) | 2,800+ major incidents | Various |
| Unfilled cyber jobs (US) | 500,000+ | CyberSeek |
| Federal cyber spending | $11+ billion | Budget |
| Critical infrastructure incidents | Increasing | CISA |

## Current State Summary

**Threat landscape:**
- Nation-states (China, Russia, Iran, North Korea) conduct espionage and pre-positioning
- Ransomware as major criminal enterprise
- Supply chain attacks increasing
- Critical infrastructure targeted
- Healthcare sector particularly vulnerable

**Defense posture:**
- CISA established as civilian coordinator
- Sector Risk Management Agencies designated
- Voluntary frameworks dominant
- Mandatory reporting enacted (CIRCIA)
- Persistent underfunding

**Key gaps:**
- Critical infrastructure regulation uneven
- Small business capacity lacking
- Workforce shortage severe
- Information sharing incomplete
- International norms weak

## The Stakes

**If cybersecurity fails:**
- Critical infrastructure disruption (power, water, healthcare)
- Economic damage (ransomware, theft)
- National security compromise
- Loss of public trust
- Democratic process undermined

**If cybersecurity improves:**
- Resilient critical infrastructure
- Protected economic activity
- National security maintained
- Digital economy thrives
- Trust restored

## Core Challenges

### Technical Challenges

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Legacy systems | Old systems cannot be easily secured |
| Complexity | Modern systems too complex to fully secure |
| Supply chain | Vulnerabilities in components |
| Zero-day exploits | Unknown vulnerabilities |
| AI-enabled attacks | Increasing sophistication |

### Organizational Challenges

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Underinvestment | Security seen as cost center |
| Talent shortage | Not enough qualified professionals |
| Complexity | Hard to manage security across systems |
| Third parties | Vendor and partner risks |
| Governance | Security often subordinate |

### Policy Challenges

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Voluntary standards | Limited enforcement |
| Fragmented authority | No single lead agency |
| Liability gaps | Inadequate incentives |
| Information sharing | Trust and legal barriers |
| International | No effective norms |

## Reform Approaches

| Approach | Proponents | Key Features |
|----------|------------|--------------|
| **Regulation** | Reformers, some industry | Mandatory standards |
