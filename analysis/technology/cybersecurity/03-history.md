| Growth | 2013-2017 | Bitcoin payments, mass distribution |
| Targeted | 2017-2020 | Big game hunting, manual operations |
| RaaS | 2020+ | Affiliate model, double extortion |
| Triple extortion | 2021+ | Add DDoS, victim notification |

## Historical Lessons

### What History Teaches

1. **Threats always evolve faster than defenses**
2. **Major incidents drive policy change**
3. **Voluntary measures prove insufficient**
4. **Coordination is perpetually challenging**
5. **Workforce shortage is persistent**
6. **Attribution remains difficult**
7. **International norms hard to establish**

### Policy Failures

| Failure | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Voluntary standards | Inadequate adoption |
| Underfunding | Persistent vulnerabilities |
| Fragmented authority | Coordination gaps |
| Liability absence | Misaligned incentives |
| Workforce neglect | Persistent shortage |
