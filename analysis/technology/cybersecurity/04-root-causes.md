# Cybersecurity: Root Causes

## Overview

Persistent cybersecurity failures stem from misaligned incentives, market failures, organizational challenges, and policy gaps. Understanding these root causes is essential for designing effective solutions.

## Economic Factors

### Misaligned Incentives

| Actor | Incentive | Security Effect |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Software vendors | Ship fast, profit | Insecure by default |
| Companies | Minimize costs | Underinvestment |
| Executives | Short-term results | Security as cost |
| Consumers | Convenience | Ignore security |
| Attackers | Profit | Sophisticated threats |

### Market Failures

| Failure | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Externalities** | Breach costs borne by victims, not vendors |
| **Information asymmetry** | Buyers can't evaluate security |
| **Network effects** | Insecure systems still useful |
| **Collective action** | Individual security doesn't help if others insecure |
| **Insurance gaps** | Cyber insurance immature |

### Liability Gaps

| Gap | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| Software liability limited | No incentive for secure code |
| Vendor liability limited | Supply chain insecurity |
| Executive liability rare | Security deprioritized |
| Safe harbors | Even negligent actors protected |

## Technical Factors

### Complexity

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Billions of lines of code | Impossible to fully secure |
| Interconnected systems | Attack surface expands |
| Legacy integration | Old vulnerabilities persist |
| Rapid change | Security can't keep pace |

### Design Choices

| Choice | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| Functionality over security | Insecure defaults |
| Speed to market | Insufficient testing |
| Backward compatibility | Legacy vulnerabilities |
| User convenience | Security friction minimized |

### Defender Disadvantage

**Attackers must:**
- Find one vulnerability

**Defenders must:**
- Secure everything
- Maintain security over time
- Respond to all attacks
- Never make mistakes

## Organizational Factors

### Security Culture

| Problem | Manifestation |
|---------|---------------|
| Security as cost center | Underfunded |
| Not board priority | Insufficient attention |
| IT vs. security conflict | Friction |
| User resistance | Security bypassed |
| Incident shame | Underreporting |

### Resource Constraints

| Constraint | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| Budget limits | Incomplete protection |
| Staff shortage | Overwhelmed teams |
| Tool overload | Integration challenges |
| Training gaps | Skill deficits |

### Organizational Complexity

| Factor | Challenge |
|--------|-----------|
| Distributed systems | Coordination difficult |
| Mergers/acquisitions | System integration |
| Outsourcing | Third-party risk |
| Remote work | Expanded perimeter |

## Policy Factors

### Regulatory Gaps

| Gap | Effect |
|-----|--------|
| No comprehensive federal law | Inconsistent requirements |
| Sector-specific | Coverage gaps |
| Voluntary frameworks | Limited adoption |
| Weak enforcement | Inadequate deterrence |

### Government Limitations

| Limitation | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| Fragmented authority | Coordination challenges |
| Classification | Information sharing barriers |
| Procurement rules | Slow adoption |
| Resources | Understaffed agencies |

### International Challenges

| Challenge | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| No binding norms | State behavior unconstrained |
| Attribution difficulties | Accountability gaps |
| Jurisdiction issues | Prosecution challenges |
| Asymmetric warfare | Defense disadvantage |

## Workforce Factors

### Shortage Causes

| Cause | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Education pipeline | Insufficient graduates |
| Experience requirements | Entry barriers |
| Compensation competition | Public sector disadvantage |
| Burnout | Retention challenges |
| Diversity barriers | Talent pool limited |

### Skills Gaps

| Gap | Impact |
|-----|--------|
| Technical depth | Incomplete understanding |
| Business context | Misaligned priorities |
| Communication | Executive engagement |
| Emerging tech | New vulnerabilities |

## Structural Factors

### Technology Ecosystem

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Monoculture | Single vulnerabilities affect many |
| Supply chain depth | Invisible dependencies |
| Cloud concentration | Single points of failure |
| Open source reliance | Volunteer maintenance |

### Economic Structure

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Winner-take-all markets | Security not competitive advantage |
| Network effects | Insecure systems still win |
| Platform dependencies | Concentrated risk |
| Short-term focus | Security deprioritized |

## Feedback Loops

### Underinvestment Cycle

```
Underinvestment → Breach → Cost → Blame → Same Investment → Breach
```

### Talent Cycle

```
Shortage → Overwork → Burnout → Departure → More Shortage
```

### Market Cycle

```
Insecure Products → Market Acceptance → No Incentive → More Insecure Products
```

## Implications for Solutions

Solutions must address:
1. **Incentives**: Liability, regulation, market signals
2. **Investment**: Public and private
3. **Workforce**: Education, retention, diversity
4. **Coordination**: Authority, information sharing
5. **Technical**: Secure by default, complexity reduction
6. **International**: Norms, deterrence, cooperation
