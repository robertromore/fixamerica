# Cybersecurity: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Comprehensive cybersecurity legislation must establish baseline security requirements, reform liability frameworks, enhance information sharing, and build workforce capacity. This document provides draft legislation for key reforms.

## Federal Legislation

### Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity Act

**Purpose**: Establish mandatory baseline security requirements for critical infrastructure.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity
Act of 2025".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that—
    (1) critical infrastructure is increasingly dependent on digital
    systems;
    (2) cyberattacks against critical infrastructure pose significant
    risks to national security, economic security, and public safety;
    (3) voluntary security measures have proven insufficient;
    (4) baseline mandatory requirements are necessary; and
    (5) a risk-based, sector-specific approach is appropriate.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

(a) CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE.—The term "critical infrastructure"
means systems and assets designated by the President under 42 U.S.C.
§ 5195c(e).

(b) COVERED ENTITY.—The term "covered entity" means an owner or
operator of critical infrastructure that—
    (1) is designated by the relevant sector risk management agency; or
    (2) meets thresholds established by the Director of CISA.

(c) BASELINE REQUIREMENTS.—The term "baseline requirements" means
minimum security controls established under this Act.

SEC. 4. BASELINE SECURITY REQUIREMENTS.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—Not later than 2 years after the date of
enactment, the Director of CISA, in coordination with relevant
sector risk management agencies, shall establish baseline
cybersecurity requirements for covered entities.

    (8) recovery and resilience measures.

(c) SECTOR-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS.—Sector risk management agencies
may establish additional sector-specific requirements exceeding
baseline requirements.

(d) RISK-BASED APPROACH.—Requirements shall be proportionate to—
    (1) the criticality of the infrastructure;
    (2) the potential consequences of compromise; and
    (3) the size and resources of the covered entity.

compliance with secure development practices shall be entitled
to a safe harbor defense in civil litigation arising from
security defects.

    (2) maintain a coordinated vulnerability disclosure program;
    (3) provide timely patches for known vulnerabilities;
    (4) provide a software bill of materials; and
    (5) maintain documentation of compliance.

(c) LIMITATIONS.—The safe harbor does not apply where—
    (1) the developer had actual knowledge of a vulnerability
    and failed to remediate it;
    (2) the developer made material misrepresentations about
    security; or
    (3) the developer engaged in willful misconduct.

SEC. 6. LIABILITY FRAMEWORK.

critical software may be strictly liable for harm caused by—
    (1) known vulnerabilities not remediated within 90 days; or
    (2) failure to meet critical software requirements.

a rebuttable presumption of reasonable care.

SEC. 7. DAMAGES.

(a) COMPENSATORY DAMAGES.—A prevailing plaintiff may recover
actual damages proximately caused by the security defect.

(b) STATUTORY DAMAGES.—Where actual damages are difficult to
prove, a plaintiff may recover statutory damages of $100 to
$10,000 per affected user.

(c) PUNITIVE DAMAGES.—Punitive damages are available where the
developer—
    (1) had actual knowledge of the vulnerability;
    (2) failed to remediate despite knowledge; and
    (3) acted with willful disregard for user safety.

SEC. 8. PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.

(a) STANDING.—Any person harmed by a security defect in software
may bring a civil action under this Act.

(b) CLASS ACTIONS.—Class actions are permitted under this Act.

(c) ATTORNEY'S FEES.—A prevailing plaintiff may recover
