# Cybersecurity: Solutions

## Overview

Improving national cybersecurity requires a comprehensive approach combining regulation, liability reform, workforce development, investment, and international cooperation.

## Regulatory Solutions

### Critical Infrastructure Requirements

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| Baseline standards | Mandatory minimums by sector |
| Risk-based approach | Requirements proportional to risk |
| Incident reporting | Already enacted (CIRCIA) |
| Third-party assessment | Independent validation |
| Continuous monitoring | Ongoing compliance |

### Software Security

| Element | Requirement |
|---------|-------------|
| Secure development | SDL requirements |
| Vulnerability disclosure | Coordinated disclosure program |
| Patching | Timely remediation |
