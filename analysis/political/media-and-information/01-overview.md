# Media and Information: Overview

## Executive Summary

America's information ecosystem is in crisis. The collapse of local journalism, the rise of partisan media, the spread of misinformation on social platforms, and the decline of shared facts threaten the foundation of democratic self-governance. Citizens cannot make informed decisions when they lack access to reliable information about their communities, live in separate media bubbles, and are bombarded with deliberately false content designed to manipulate their beliefs and behaviors.

## The Core Problem

| Aspect | Issue |
|--------|-------|
| Local news collapse | 2,500+ newspapers closed since 2005 |
| Partisan media | Echo chambers reinforce bias |
| Misinformation | False content spreads faster than truth |
| Platform power | Algorithms optimize for engagement, not truth |
| Trust collapse | Only 32% trust mass media |

## Why It Matters

**For Democracy**

- Informed citizenry is prerequisite for self-governance
- Can't hold officials accountable without information
- Shared facts enable democratic deliberation
- Manipulation undermines free choice

**For Communities**

- Local news enables civic participation
- Community problems go unreported
- Corruption flourishes in darkness
- Social cohesion erodes

**For Society**

- Separate realities divide nation
- Conspiracy theories flourish
- Public health threatened (vaccine misinfo)
- Violence incited by false claims
