# Media and Information: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Media reform legislation must navigate First Amendment protections while addressing market failures that have led to the collapse of local journalism and the rise of misinformation. This document provides draft legislation for platform accountability, local journalism support, and misinformation countermeasures.

## Federal Legislation

### Platform Accountability and Transparency Act

**Purpose**: Require large social media platforms to disclose algorithmic practices, provide researcher access, and accept responsibility for amplification of harmful content.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Platform Accountability and
Transparency Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Social media platforms have become primary sources of news
    and information for millions of Americans.
(2) Algorithmic curation determines what content users see, with
    significant effects on public discourse.
(3) The amplification of misinformation, extremism, and divisive
    content is driven in part by engagement-based algorithms.
(4) Current law provides broad immunity for platform decisions
    without corresponding transparency or accountability.
(5) Public understanding of platform operations is essential for
    informed policy decisions.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) COVERED PLATFORM.—The term "covered platform" means an online
    service that—
    (A) enables users to create, share, and view user-generated
        content;
    (B) uses algorithmic systems to curate, recommend, or rank
        content; and
    (C) has more than 50,000,000 monthly active users in the
        United States.

(2) ALGORITHMIC AMPLIFICATION.—The term "algorithmic amplification"
    means any computational process that increases the visibility,
    reach, or prominence of content beyond chronological ordering.

SEC. 4. ALGORITHMIC TRANSPARENCY.

(a) DISCLOSURE.—Each covered platform shall publish, in an easily
    accessible format—
    (1) a general description of the algorithms used to curate,
        recommend, or rank content;
    (2) the primary factors used in determining content visibility;
    (3) how engagement metrics influence algorithmic decisions;
    (4) the categories of content that receive increased or
        decreased amplification.

(b) USER CONTROLS.—Each covered platform shall provide users with—
    (1) the ability to view content in chronological order
        without algorithmic curation;
    (2) meaningful controls over content recommendations;
    (3) information about why specific content was recommended.

(c) ANNUAL REPORTS.—Each covered platform shall publish annual
    transparency reports including—
    (1) total content moderation actions by category;
    (2) the most widely shared content and sources;
    (3) data on the spread of content later determined to be false;
    (4) information on coordinated inauthentic behavior detected.

SEC. 5. RESEARCHER ACCESS.

(a) DATA ACCESS PROGRAM.—The Federal Trade Commission shall
    establish a program to provide qualified researchers with
    access to platform data.

(b) QUALIFIED RESEARCHERS.—Researchers may qualify for access if
    they—
    (1) are affiliated with an academic institution;
    (2) have an approved research protocol;
    (3) agree to data security and privacy requirements.

(c) REQUIRED DATA.—Platforms shall provide researchers with—
    (1) advertising data, including targeting and spending;
    (2) content amplification data;
    (3) user engagement data (appropriately anonymized);
    (4) content moderation data.

(d) PROTECTION.—Platforms may not retaliate against researchers
    or revoke access for publishing findings.

SEC. 6. AMPLIFICATION ACCOUNTABILITY.

(a) LIMITED LIABILITY MODIFICATION.—Section 230(c)(1) of the
    Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 230(c)(1)) shall not
    apply to any claim arising from the algorithmic amplification
    of content if—
    (1) the platform had actual knowledge that the content was
        unlawful or tortious; and
    (2) the platform's algorithm significantly increased the
        reach of such content.

(b) SAFE HARBOR.—Subsection (a) shall not apply if the platform—
    (1) maintains a system for receiving and acting on reports
        of unlawful content;
    (2) removes or reduces amplification of reported content
        within 24 hours of receiving notice; and
    (3) maintains an appeals process for content moderation
        decisions.

SEC. 7. FTC ENFORCEMENT.

(a) AUTHORITY.—The Federal Trade Commission shall enforce this
    Act as if violations were unfair or deceptive acts or
    practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act.

(b) CIVIL PENALTIES.—Violations are subject to civil penalties

(c) RULEMAKING.—The Commission shall promulgate regulations
    implementing this Act within 1 year.

SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act takes effect 180 days after enactment.

```text

**Explanation**:

- **Section 4**: Transparency about algorithms without mandating specific designs.
- **Section 5**: Researcher access enables independent study of platform effects.
- **Section 6**: Narrowly modifies Section 230 for knowing amplification of unlawful content.

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| First Amendment | Disclosure requirements, not content mandates |
| Section 230 scope | Narrow modification preserves core immunity |
| Trade secrets | Researchers bound by confidentiality |

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**First Amendment**:

| Provision | Analysis |
|-----------|----------|
| Platform transparency | Constitutional as disclosure, not content mandate |
| Section 230 modification | Likely constitutional if narrowly drawn |
| AI disclosure | Content-neutral regulation of manner |
| Counter-disinformation | Must avoid domestic targeting |

**Press Freedom**:

All reforms must preserve editorial independence. Government cannot:

- Mandate content decisions
- Punish viewpoints
- Require "balance" in coverage

### Enforcement Mechanisms

| Law | Enforcement |
|-----|-------------|
| Platform Accountability | FTC |
| Local Journalism Support | IRS |
| Journalism Competition | FTC (antitrust monitoring) |
| Foreign Propaganda | State Department, intelligence community |
| AI Disclosure | FEC, private right of action |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

This section identifies potential weaknesses in the proposed legislation and provides mechanisms for addressing them.

### Platform Accountability and Transparency Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| User threshold gaming | Platforms may restructure to keep U.S. user counts below 50 million threshold | High |
| Algorithm opacity | "General description" may be so vague as to provide no meaningful transparency | High |
| Researcher qualification limits | Restrictive qualification criteria could limit independent research | High |
| Safe harbor exploitation | Platforms may create minimal compliance systems to claim safe harbor while not meaningfully addressing amplification | Medium |
| API manipulation | Platforms may provide researcher data access while limiting functionality | Medium |
| 24-hour removal window | Platforms may delay acknowledging notice to extend response time | Medium |
| Content category ambiguity | "Categories of content" receiving amplification may be defined too broadly | Low |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| No content quality standards | Platforms can amplify low-quality but legal content | First Amendment limits |
| FTC resource constraints | Agency may lack capacity for meaningful enforcement | Budget limitations |
| Trade secret tensions | Platforms will claim competitive harm from disclosure | Legitimate business concerns |
| International platforms | Foreign platforms serving U.S. users may be difficult to regulate | Jurisdictional limits |
| Algorithmic complexity | Disclosure may not be meaningful to general public | Technical nature of systems |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Threshold adjustment**: Grant FTC authority to adjust user threshold by regulation based on market changes
2. **Disclosure specificity standards**: FTC rulemaking should establish minimum disclosure requirements with examples
3. **Researcher access expansion**: Create independent research oversight board to reduce platform control over access
4. **Safe harbor strengthening**: Require documented systemic changes, not just individual content removal
5. **Meaningful API access**: Require functional equivalence between researcher tools and internal analytics

### Local Journalism Sustainability Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| "Local news" gaming | National outlets may create local subsidiaries to claim credits | High |
| Hedge fund workaround | Private equity may restructure to avoid control definitions | Medium |
| Minimum wage arbitrage | Employment at 120% minimum wage may still be poverty-level in high-cost areas | Medium |
| Nonprofit donor influence | Large donors may exert editorial pressure despite independence requirements | Medium |
| 50% original content threshold | Outlets may count aggregated content as "local" with minimal original additions | Medium |
| Small business front operations | Larger companies may route advertising through small business facades | Low |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| 5-year sunset | Temporary support may not enable sustainable transition | Legislative compromise |
| Quality undefined | Credits available regardless of journalism quality | First Amendment concerns about quality judgments |
| No digital native support | Framework assumes traditional newspaper model | Legislative lag |
| Distribution equity | Larger metros benefit more than rural areas | Market dynamics |
| No platform accountability | Tax credits don't address platform revenue capture | Separate issue |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Local content verification**: IRS should establish clear standards for what constitutes "local" coverage
2. **Beneficial ownership disclosure**: Require disclosure of all entities with financial interest in qualifying outlets
3. **Regional cost adjustment**: Index minimum wage threshold to local cost of living
4. **Digital outlet inclusion**: Explicitly include digital-native local news organizations
5. **Impact assessment**: Require GAO study before sunset to evaluate extension or modification

### Journalism Competition and Preservation Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Platform withdrawal**: Platforms may stop displaying news content entirely rather than pay | Critical |
| Two-tier journalism | Large outlets may negotiate separately, leaving small publishers behind | High |
| 65% distribution gaming | Creative accounting could minimize actual journalist compensation | High |
| Negotiator capture | Designated negotiators may not represent small outlet interests | Medium |
| 8-year sunset timing | Platforms may delay meaningful deals until expiration approaches | Medium |
| Non-discrimination evasion | Platforms may use neutral-seeming factors that favor compliant outlets | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Australian precedent limits | Australian model has shown mixed results with platform power remaining | Market dynamics |
| Antitrust exception concerns | Creates precedent for industry-specific antitrust carveouts | Rule of law consistency |
| Quality-blind | Payments based on engagement, not journalistic value | Market-based approach |
| Non-news content | Doesn't address platform extraction from other content creators | Scope limitation |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Withdrawal prohibition**: Require dominant platforms to maintain news content access as condition of operation
2. **Small publisher protections**: Guarantee minimum percentage of negotiated funds to outlets under certain size
3. **Journalist compensation verification**: Independent auditor to verify 65% distribution requirement
4. **Negotiator governance**: Require diverse representation on negotiation bodies including small and minority-owned outlets
5. **Quality incentives**: Consider supplemental public funding tied to journalistic standards

### Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Domestic attribution | Foreign-directed but domestically-executed operations may fall outside scope | High |
| Platform immunity abuse | Platforms may overcensor based on government information to claim immunity | High |
| U.S. person definition | Citizens abroad or dual nationals may fall into gray areas | Medium |
| "Voluntary" cooperation pressure | Informal government pressure may not be covered by limitations | Medium |
| Attribution challenges | Sophisticated actors may obscure foreign origins | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| No domestic disinformation | Foreign focus ignores domestic sources of false information | Scope limitation, civil liberties |
| Counter-messaging effectiveness | Research shows counter-messaging often ineffective | Nature of disinformation |
| Rapid response gaps | Government processes too slow for viral content | Institutional speed limits |
| Civil liberties tension | Any government role in information creates free speech concerns | Constitutional values |
| Platform cooperation limits | Voluntary cooperation may be inconsistent or insufficient | Private sector autonomy |

| Detection technology gaps | AI detection cannot reliably identify all synthetic content | High |
| Foreign actor immunity | International creators may be beyond enforcement reach | High |
| 60-day window gaming | Misleading content released 61+ days before election escapes coverage | High |
| Partial AI assistance | Content with AI-assisted elements but human finishing may evade requirements | Medium |
| "News organization" exception | Fake news sites may claim news organization status | Medium |
| Platform safe harbor | "Reasonable efforts" standard may be minimal | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Technology outpacing regulation | New AI capabilities emerge faster than rules can adapt | Technology speed |
| First Amendment tensions | Content restrictions raise free speech concerns | Constitutional limits |
| Detection arms race | As detection improves, so does evasion | Adversarial dynamics |
| State vs federal gaps | State deepfake laws may conflict | Federalism |
| Private figure coverage | Deepfakes of non-candidates may not be covered | Scope limitation |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Satire standards**: Require clear, contemporaneous labeling as satire, not post-hoc claims
2. **Detection technology investment**: Federal funding for detection technology research
3. **International cooperation**: Treaties for cross-border enforcement
4. **Expand time window**: Cover AI content in political context year-round, not just pre-election
5. **Graduated AI involvement**: Establish levels of AI involvement requiring different disclosures
6. **News organization registration**: Create objective criteria for news organization exception

### Media Literacy Education Act (Model State)

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| "Integrated" implementation | Integration across subjects may result in superficial treatment | High |
| Partisan capture | Curriculum may be influenced by political considerations | High |
| 5-hour training insufficiency | Minimal training may not prepare teachers adequately | Medium |
| Unfunded mandates | "Appropriated" funds may be inadequate or cut | Medium |
| Assessment gaps | No requirement to assess student media literacy outcomes | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| State variation | 50-state variation means inconsistent national preparation | Federalism |
| Adult population gap | K-12 focus doesn't address current adult population | Scope limit |
| Technology lag | Curriculum may not keep pace with new platforms | Update cycle |
| Rural/urban disparity | Resource-poor districts may implement poorly | Funding inequity |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Standalone requirements**: Require minimum dedicated instructional hours, not just integration
2. **Bipartisan curriculum development**: Mandate diverse political representation in curriculum creation
3. **Teacher training expansion**: Increase to 15+ hours with ongoing professional development
4. **Protected funding**: Dedicate funding stream not subject to annual appropriation battles
5. **Outcome assessment**: Require standardized media literacy assessment and public reporting
6. **Adult education extension**: Fund community media literacy programs for adults

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| First Amendment chilling effects | Regular civil liberties audits of all media regulations |
| Platform regulatory capture | Rotating FTC commissioners, conflict of interest rules |
| Technology evolution speed | Grant agencies broad rulemaking authority with Congressional review |
| International coordination | Establish transatlantic regulatory cooperation framework |
| Industry concentration | Link media reforms to broader antitrust enforcement |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

All provisions should include:

- **3-year technology review** given rapid pace of change in media landscape
- **Civil liberties impact assessment** for any government information programs
- **Market structure evaluation** to assess competition effects
- **Automatic adjustment authority** for platform user thresholds and dollar amounts
- **Stakeholder input requirements** including journalism organizations, civil liberties groups, and platforms
