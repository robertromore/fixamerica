# Media and Information: Overview

America's information ecosystem is in crisis. The collapse of local journalism, the rise of partisan media, the spread of misinformation on social platforms, and the decline of shared facts threaten the foundation of democratic self-governance. Citizens cannot make informed decisions when they lack access to reliable information about their communities, live in separate media bubbles, and are bombarded with deliberately false content designed to manipulate their beliefs and behaviors.
