# Primary Reform: Legislation

## Overview

Primary election reform occurs primarily at the state level through legislation or ballot initiatives. This document provides model legislation for the major reform approaches: open primaries, top-two systems, top-four with ranked choice voting, and supporting reforms like same-day registration and sore loser law repeal. Federal legislation plays a limited but potentially important role in setting standards for congressional primaries.

### Legislative Approach

| Level | Authority | Primary Reform Options |
|-------|-----------|----------------------|
| State | Full authority | Open primaries, top-two/four, RCV, registration rules |
| Federal | Limited | Standards for congressional primaries, grants |
| Local | Varies by state | Municipal primary reform where authorized |

## State Model Legislation

### Model 1: Open Primary Act

**Purpose**: Allow all registered voters to participate in primary elections regardless of party affiliation.

**Draft Text**:

```text

    of their choice.

    affect their party registration status.

```

**Explanation**:

- Section 3 is the core provision allowing any voter to participate
- Section 4 preserves party rights to endorse and support candidates
- This is a "pick-one" open primary, not a blanket primary, avoiding constitutional issues
- Section 3(d) protects ballot secrecy to prevent party retaliation

**Challenges**:

- Party opposition based on associational rights arguments
- Concerns about crossover voting (though research shows it is rare)
- Does not address safe-seat dynamics in general election

### Model 2: Top-Four Primary with RCV General Election Act (Alaska Model)

**Purpose**: Implement a nonpartisan top-four primary with ranked-choice voting general election.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "[State] Open Elections Act".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS.

The [Legislature/People] find(s) that:
(a) Current partisan primary elections limit voter choice and exclude
    independent voters from meaningful participation.
(b) Primary electorates are unrepresentative of the general electorate.
(c) Nonpartisan primaries with ranked-choice general elections can
    produce more representative outcomes and reduce polarization.
(d) Alaska successfully implemented this system beginning in 2022.

    a single primary ballot, regardless of party affiliation or

    all candidates who filed shall advance to the general election.

    on the ballot, but such indication—
    (1) does not constitute endorsement by the party;
    (2) is solely the candidate's statement of preference;
    (3) shall appear next to the candidate's name on the ballot;
    (4) shall be accompanied by the disclaimer: "Party preference
        designated by candidate."

(f) NO PARTY PREFERENCE.—Candidates may choose to indicate no party
    preference, which shall appear as "Nonpartisan" or "Independent".

SECTION 4. RANKED-CHOICE VOTING GENERAL ELECTION.

(a) BALLOT.—In the general election, voters shall rank the candidates
    in order of preference. Voters may rank as many or as few
    candidates as they choose.

    (1) All ballots are initially counted for voters' first choices.
    (2) If a candidate receives a majority of votes (more than 50%),

    (3) If no candidate has a majority, the candidate with the fewest
        votes is eliminated.
    (4) Ballots cast for the eliminated candidate are transferred to
        voters' next-ranked continuing candidates.
    (5) This process continues until a candidate has a majority of
        the remaining active ballots.

(c) TIE-BREAKING.—In the event of a tie, the candidate who received
    more first-choice votes in the primary shall prevail. If still
    tied, the tie shall be resolved by lot.

## Regulatory Framework

### State Implementation Regulations

States implementing primary reform should adopt regulations addressing:

| Area | Key Provisions |
|------|----------------|
| Ballot design | Clear instructions, candidate order, party labels |
| Tabulation | Equipment certification, observer access, audit trails |
| Reporting | Round-by-round results, cast vote records |
| Voter education | Materials, outreach, timing |
| Training | Poll worker preparation, administrator certification |
| Recounts | Procedures for ranked-choice recounts |

### Sample Regulatory Provisions

**Ballot Design Standards**

- Candidate names in consistent font and size
- Party preference clearly indicated but not emphasized
- Ranking instructions at top of ballot
- Example rankings shown
- Instructions in primary languages of jurisdiction

**Tabulation Procedures**

- Centralized tabulation for ranked-choice general elections
- Public observation of tabulation
- Batch reporting at predetermined intervals
- Audit trail for all transfers

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Analysis

**Party Association Rights**

| System | Constitutional Status | Key Case |
|--------|----------------------|----------|
| Open primary (pick one) | Constitutional | *Tashjian v. Republican Party* (1986) |
| Blanket primary | Unconstitutional | *California Democratic Party v. Jones* (2000) |
| Top-two nonpartisan | Constitutional | *Washington State Grange* (2008) |
| Top-four with RCV | Constitutional (expected) | Alaska challenges pending |
| RCV general election | Constitutional | No successful challenges |

**Key Distinctions**

- Blanket primaries forced parties to associate with unwanted voters
- Top-two/top-four are first-round elections, not party nominations
- Party preference labels are candidate statements, not party endorsements
- Voters understand the distinction (per *Washington State Grange*)

### Federal Authority

**Elections Clause (Article I, Section 4)**

Congress may regulate "Time, Place and Manner" of congressional elections, potentially including:

- Requiring open primaries for federal offices
- Setting standards for ranked-choice voting
- Mandating same-day registration

**Limits**

- Cannot regulate state/local primaries
- Cannot directly mandate specific primary systems
- May use funding conditions as incentives

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Strategic crossover voting | Voters from opposing party may vote for weakest candidate | Medium |
| Candidate flooding | Parties run many candidates to split opposition vote | High |
| False party preference | Candidates claim party affiliation to confuse voters | Medium |
| Ballot exhaustion manipulation | Campaigns encourage bullet voting to increase exhausted ballots | Medium |
| Write-in prohibition gaming | Candidates use write-in prohibition strategically | Low |
| Same-party lockout (top-two) | Minority party excluded from general election | Critical |
| Party coordination | Parties coordinate to limit candidates and ensure advancement | High |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Voter confusion | Some voters misunderstand RCV | Novel system |
| Implementation costs | Equipment and training expenses | One-time transition |
| Minor party exclusion (top-two) | Third parties rarely advance | System design |
| Exhausted ballots | Some voters effectively disenfranchised in later rounds | Voter choice not to rank all |
| Low turnout persists | Opening primary doesn't guarantee participation | Structural voter engagement issues |
| Party weakening | Parties lose nomination control | Design trade-off |
| Media coverage gaps | Complex results harder to report | New reporting needs |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Strategic voting education**: Public education explaining primary purposes and honest voting benefits

2. **Anti-flooding provisions**: Cap candidates per party or require minimum signature thresholds

3. **Party preference verification**: Require party confirmation of claimed preference or clear disclaimer

4. **Exhausted ballot tracking**: Publish detailed exhausted ballot data with analysis

5. **Top-four/five expansion**: Address top-two lockout by expanding to more candidates

6. **Turnout enhancement**: Pair primary reform with automatic registration, vote-by-mail

7. **Minor party protection**: Consider guaranteed slots for parties meeting thresholds

8. **Coordination disclosure**: Require disclosure of party involvement in candidate decisions

9. **Voter education investment**: Sustained education beyond first election cycle

10. **Equipment certification**: Establish clear certification standards for RCV systems

### General Implementation Concerns

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| Transition confusion | 2-year implementation timeline with phased rollout |
| Election official capacity | Federal and state grants for training |
| Ballot design errors | Model ballots with user testing before deployment |
| Results reporting delays | Standardized formats and real-time reporting systems |
| Legal challenges | Pre-enactment legal review and defense fund |
| Repeal attempts | Build constituency during implementation |
