# Primary Reform: Solutions

## Guiding Principles

### Core Values

**Participation**

- All voters should be able to participate in all publicly funded elections
- Registration and access barriers should be minimized
- Primaries should be as accessible as general elections

**Representation**

- Elected officials should represent their full constituency, not just primary voters
- Candidates should have incentives to appeal broadly
- Electoral outcomes should reflect voter preferences

**Competition**

- Voters should have meaningful choices
- Safe seats should still have competitive elections
- Incumbents should face real accountability

**Simplicity**

- Systems should be understandable to average voters
- Administrative burden should be manageable
- Transition from current systems should be feasible

### Criteria for Evaluating Solutions

| Criterion | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| Effectiveness | Will it reduce polarization and increase representation? |
| Constitutionality | Does it survive legal challenge? |
| Feasibility | Can it be implemented practically? |
| Voter acceptance | Will voters understand and support it? |
| Political viability | Can it overcome opposition to pass? |

## Open Primaries

### Simple Open Primaries

Allow any voter to participate in any party's primary.

**How It Works**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Voter choice | Voters choose which party's primary to vote in |
| Party labels | Parties retain separate ballots |
| Winner advances | Party nominees face each other in general |
| No registration | Don't need to register with party |

**Advantages**

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Independent participation | 40%+ of voters can participate |
| Simple change | Easy to explain and implement |
| Party structure preserved | Parties still nominate candidates |
| Broader appeal required | Candidates must attract independents |

**Disadvantages**

| Drawback | Concern |
|----------|---------|
| Crossover voting possible | Theoretical sabotage risk |
| Still low turnout | Opening doesn't guarantee participation |
| Safe seats remain | Still one party dominant in most districts |
| Limited polarization effect | Research shows modest impact |

**States Using Open Primaries**

~15 states including: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Wisconsin

**Evidence on Effects**

| Finding | Source |
|---------|--------|
| Modest turnout increase | 2-4% higher than closed primaries |
| Crossover voting rare | <5% in most elections |
| Mixed polarization effects | Some moderation, not dramatic |

### Semi-Open Primaries

Allow independents but not members of opposing party.

**How It Works**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Independents participate | Can choose which primary |
| Registered partisans restricted | Can only vote in own party's primary |
| Party labels maintained | Separate ballots by party |

**Advantages**

- Addresses crossover concern
- Includes independents
- Preserves party identity

**Disadvantages**

- More complex registration
- Still excludes some voters
- May incentivize non-registration

## Top-Two Primary (Nonpartisan)

### Standard Top-Two

All candidates on single ballot; top two advance regardless of party.

**How It Works**

| Stage | Process |
|-------|---------|
| Primary | All candidates, all parties, one ballot |
| Voter participation | Any registered voter |
| Who advances | Top two vote-getters |
| General election | Top two face off |

**Advantages**

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Full participation | All voters, all primaries |
| Competition in safe seats | Same-party runoffs in dominant party areas |
| Candidate differentiation | Must distinguish from same-party rivals |
| Moderate incentives | General election matters even in safe seats |

**Disadvantages**

| Drawback | Concern |
|----------|---------|
| Minor party exclusion | Third parties rarely make top two |
| Possible same-party general | Voters may find confusing |
| Spoiler effects | Vote splitting can eliminate candidates |
| Campaign costs | Two competitive elections expensive |

**States Using Top-Two**

| State | Year Adopted | Offices Covered |
|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| California | 2010 | State and federal (not president) |
| Washington | 2004 | State and federal (not president) |
| Nebraska | 1934 | State legislature only |

**Evidence on Effects**

| Finding | Assessment |
|---------|------------|
| Polarization reduction | Mixed; some evidence of moderation |
| Competition increase | More competitive races in safe districts |
| Voter participation | Modest turnout effects |
| Minor party ballot access | Significantly reduced |

### Constitutional Status

**Key Case**: *Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party* (2008)

The Supreme Court upheld top-two primaries, distinguishing them from blanket primaries (struck down in *California Democratic Party v. Jones*):

- Top-two is not a primary in traditional sense
- It's a first-round election
- Party labels are self-selected, not endorsements
- Voters not confused about party nomination

## Top-Four Primary with RCV (Final Four/Five Voting)

### The Alaska Model

Nonpartisan primary advances four candidates to ranked choice general election.

**How It Works**

| Stage | Process |
|-------|---------|
| Primary | All candidates on one nonpartisan ballot |
| Primary outcome | Top four vote-getters advance |
| General election | Ranked choice voting among four candidates |
| Winner determination | Instant runoff until majority achieved |

**Advantages**

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| More choices | Four candidates in general election |
| Minor party viability | Third parties can make top four |
| Majority winner | RCV ensures majority support |
| Broad appeal incentive | Must be acceptable to wider electorate |
| Reduced strategic voting | RCV limits spoiler effects |

**Disadvantages**

| Drawback | Concern |
|----------|---------|
| Complexity | RCV requires voter education |
| Ballot exhaustion | Some ballots don't reach final round |
| Implementation cost | New voting systems needed |
| Unfamiliar to voters | Learning curve |

**Alaska Results (2022)**

| Race | Outcome | Significance |
|------|---------|--------------|
| U.S. House Special | Mary Peltola (D) won | Democrat in red state |
| U.S. House Regular | Peltola reelected | Confirmed special result |
| U.S. Senate | Lisa Murkowski (R) | Moderate survived challenge |
| Governor | Mike Dunleavy (R) | Incumbent reelected |

### Top-Five Variant

Nevada's 2022 ballot measure (requiring 2024 confirmation) expands to five candidates.

**Differences from Top-Four**

| Feature | Top-Four | Top-Five |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Advancing candidates | 4 | 5 |
| Minor party access | Better than top-two | Slightly better |
| General election choices | More diverse | Even more diverse |

## Ranked Choice Voting in Traditional Primaries

### RCV Within Party Primaries

Apply ranked choice voting to existing closed or open primaries.

**How It Works**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Party primaries maintained | Separate Democratic/Republican primaries |
| RCV applied | Voters rank candidates within party |
| Winner determination | Instant runoff until majority |
| General election | Party nominees face off (potentially with RCV there too) |

**Advantages**

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Majority winner | No plurality wins with fringe support |
| Reduced negative campaigning | Need to be acceptable as second choice |
| Coalition building | Candidates seek broad support |
| Works with existing structure | Preserves party primaries |

**Disadvantages**

| Drawback | Concern |
|----------|---------|
| Closed primaries still exclude | Independents locked out in closed states |
| Safe seats remain | General election still uncompetitive |
| Modest impact expected | Doesn't address underlying dynamics |

**Current Use**

| Jurisdiction | Application |
|--------------|-------------|
| Maine | Federal primaries |
| Alaska | Part of top-four system |
| Various localities | Municipal primaries |

## Presidential Primary Reform

### Calendar Reform

Restructure the primary calendar for fairness and representativeness.

**Problems to Address**

| Issue | Current Situation |
|-------|------------------|
| Front-loading | Most delegates decided early |
| Iowa/NH dominance | Unrepresentative states have outsized influence |
| Late states irrelevant | Race often decided before they vote |
| Favors resources | Must raise huge sums early |

**Reform Options**

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Rotating regional primaries | Regions take turns going first |
| National primary day | All states vote same day |
| Graduated schedule | Small states early, large states later |
| Random order | Lottery determines calendar |

**DNC 2024 Reforms**

| Change | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| South Carolina first | More diverse electorate |
| New Hampshire demoted | Less representative |
| Georgia, Michigan added early | Battleground, diverse |

### Abolish or Reform Caucuses

Replace caucuses with primaries for accessibility.

**The Case for Abolition**

| Issue | Problem |
|-------|---------|
| Low turnout | Often <10% participation |
| Time barrier | Hours-long commitment |
| Accessibility | Hard for workers, parents, disabled |
| Accuracy | Counting problems (Iowa 2020) |

**Reform Options**

| Option | Approach |
|--------|----------|
| Abolish caucuses | Require primaries only |
| Firehouse primaries | Short-window voting at caucus locations |
| Absentee participation | Allow non-attendance voting |

### Delegate Allocation Reform

Change how delegates are allocated to candidates.

**Current Systems**

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Proportional | Delegates divided by vote share |
| Winner-take-all | State winner gets all delegates |
| Hybrid | Mix of methods |
| Threshold | Minimum percentage to receive delegates |

**Reform Options**

| Reform | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Uniform proportional | All states proportional; extends race |
| Eliminate thresholds | Every candidate gets fair share |
| Binding delegates | Reduce convention manipulation |

## Automatic and Same-Day Registration

### Automatic Voter Registration (AVR)

Automatically register eligible voters through government interactions.

**For Primaries**

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| No registration barrier | Everyone eligible is registered |
| Increases potential primary electorate | More people can participate |
| Reduces administrative burden | One-time registration |

**Implementation Considerations**

| Issue | Approach |
|-------|----------|
| Party affiliation | Register as unaffiliated by default |
| Notification | Inform voters of registration |
| Opt-out | Allow people to decline |

### Same-Day Registration for Primaries

Allow registration at polls on primary day.

**Benefits**

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Eliminates deadline barrier | Don't miss registration cutoff |
| Helps young voters | Most affected by deadlines |
| Increases participation | 3-7% turnout increase where implemented |

**Current Status**

~21 states + DC allow same-day registration; not all apply to primaries.

## Sore Loser Law Reform

### Repeal Sore Loser Laws

Allow primary losers to run in general election.

**Rationale**

| Argument | Logic |
|----------|-------|
| Voter choice | Let voters, not primaries, decide |
| Flexibility | Good candidates shouldn't be eliminated |
| Reduce primary stakes | Lower incentive for extreme tactics |
| Minor party access | Easier path for third-party candidates |

**Concerns**

| Concern | Response |
|---------|----------|
| Spoiler effect | Less relevant with RCV |
| Sore loser campaigns | Rare in practice |
| Party cohesion | Parties can still endorse |

## Primary Timing Reform

### Consolidate Primary Dates

Move primaries to more accessible times.

**Problems with Current Timing**

| Issue | Problem |
|-------|---------|
| Variable dates | Primaries scattered throughout year |
| Low-salience timing | Often held when voters not paying attention |
| Separate from general | Different day means different turnout |

**Reform Options**

| Reform | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| National primary day | All primaries on single day |
| Align with general | Primary on or near general election day |
| September primaries | Closer to general, higher salience |

## Alternative Approaches

### Fusion Voting

Allow candidates to be nominated by multiple parties.

**How It Works**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Cross-endorsement | Candidate appears on multiple party lines |
| Vote counting | Votes on all lines count for candidate |
| Party visibility | Voters see which parties support candidate |

**States Allowing Fusion**

| State | Status |
|-------|--------|
| New York | Established system |
| Connecticut | Allows fusion |
| Several others | Limited provisions |

**Relevance to Primary Reform**

- Reduces winner-take-all dynamics
- Gives minor parties influence
- Alternative to top-two/top-four

### Approval Voting in Primaries

Allow voters to vote for multiple candidates.

**How It Works**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Multiple votes | Approve as many candidates as you like |
| Winner determination | Most approvals wins |
| Simple ballots | Just yes/no for each candidate |

**Advantages**

- Simple to understand
- No spoiler effect
- Rewards broad appeal

**Current Use**

Limited; Fargo, ND uses approval voting.

## What Has Worked Elsewhere

### State-Level Success Stories

**Alaska (2020-Present)**

| Result | Significance |
|--------|--------------|
| Top-four + RCV implemented | Most comprehensive reform |
| Murkowski survived primary challenge | Moderate protected |
| Peltola elected | Cross-partisan appeal rewarded |
| Voter understanding | Improved over time |

**California (2012-Present)**

| Result | Significance |
|--------|--------------|
| Top-two implemented | Major state change |
| Same-party runoffs common | Competition in safe seats |
| Some moderation evidence | Mixed academic findings |
| Challenges | Minor party access reduced |

**Colorado (2016-Present)**

| Result | Significance |
|--------|--------------|
| Open primaries adopted | Independents included |
| Higher participation | More voters engaged |
| Maintained party structure | Parties still function |

### International Models

**France**

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Two-round system | Top two face runoff |
| All candidates in first round | No party primaries |
| Majority required | Second round produces majority winner |

**Australia**

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Ranked choice (IRV) | Used in House elections |
| Compulsory voting | High participation |
| Minor party viability | Preferences enable third parties |

## Trade-offs

### Participation vs. Party Control

| More Participation | More Party Control |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| All voters included | Party members choose nominees |
| Broader appeal required | Clear party identity |
| Less ideological purity | Reliable party supporters rewarded |

**Resolution**: Top-four with RCV balances both by preserving party labels while broadening participation.

### Simplicity vs. Sophistication

| Simple Systems | Sophisticated Systems |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Easier to understand | Better outcomes possible |
| Lower implementation cost | More voter education needed |
| Familiar to voters | Unfamiliar initially |

**Resolution**: Phase in changes with voter education; simplicity overrated if outcomes poor.

### Minor Party Impact

| Top-Two | Top-Four/Five |
|---------|---------------|
| Minor parties rarely advance | More likely to make top four/five |
| General election often same-party | More diverse general elections |
| Ballot access reduced | Ballot access better preserved |

**Resolution**: Top-four or top-five addresses minor party concerns better than top-two.

### Competition vs. Stability

| More Competition | More Stability |
|-----------------|----------------|
| Incumbents face challenges | Experienced legislators remain |
| New voices emerge | Institutional knowledge preserved |
| Accountability increases | Less turnover disruption |

**Resolution**: Some increased competition is desirable; extreme turnover unlikely with any reform.
