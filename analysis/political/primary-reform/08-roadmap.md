# Primary Reform: Roadmap

## Strategic Context

### Why State-Level Action Is Primary

Primary election reform will primarily occur at the state level for several reasons:

| Factor | Implication |
|--------|-------------|
| Constitutional structure | States control election administration |
| Federal deference | Congress has not regulated primary systems |
| Ballot initiative availability | Citizens can bypass legislatures in 24 states |
| Laboratory of democracy | States can experiment with different approaches |

### Reform Windows

**Opportune Moments for Reform**

| Trigger | Opportunity |
|---------|-------------|
| Electoral dysfunction | Public frustration drives change |
| Extreme candidate nomination | "How did this happen?" moment |
| Ballot initiative cycles | Even-year elections with turnout |
| Post-redistricting | Maps create new incentives |
| Political scandal | Reform momentum increases |
