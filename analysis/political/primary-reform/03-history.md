# Primary Reform: History

## Origins

### The Era of Party Bosses (Pre-1900)

Before primary elections existed, political parties controlled candidate selection through internal processes with no public participation.

**The Caucus-Convention System**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Local caucuses | Party meetings at precinct level |
| County conventions | Delegates from caucuses |
| State conventions | Delegates selected nominees |
| Party control | Complete; no public input |

**How It Worked**

1. Party officials called local caucuses
2. Loyal party members attended
3. Delegates chosen to higher conventions
4. State conventions nominated candidates
5. General public voted only in general election

**The Problems**

| Issue | Manifestation |
|-------|---------------|
| Corruption | "Smoke-filled rooms" determined nominees |
| Machine politics | Boss Tweed, Tammany Hall, urban machines |
| Voter exclusion | Ordinary citizens had no voice |
| Patronage | Candidates chosen for loyalty, not merit |
| Unresponsive government | Officials accountable to bosses, not voters |

### Early Reform Impulses

**Mugwumps and Good Government Reformers**

In the 1880s, reform-minded Republicans (derisively called "Mugwumps") began advocating for cleaner politics:

- Civil service reform to reduce patronage
- Ballot reform (Australian ballot)
- Direct democracy measures
- Party reform to break machine power

**The Australian Ballot (1888-1892)**

The adoption of government-printed, secret ballots was a precursor to primary reform:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Party-printed ballots | Government-printed ballots |
| Public voting | Secret voting |
| Intimidation possible | Voter independence |
| Party control of ballot | State control of ballot |

This established that the state, not parties, could regulate elections, setting precedent for primary regulation.

## The Progressive Era and Direct Primaries

### The Wisconsin Model (1903)

Governor Robert La Follette championed the first comprehensive direct primary law.

**Wisconsin's 1903 Primary Law**

| Feature | Innovation |
|---------|------------|
| Mandatory primaries | All parties required to use primaries |
| State regulation | Government administered primaries |
| Voter participation | Party members could vote directly |
| Binding results | Primary winners became nominees |

**La Follette's Rationale**

> "Go back to the first principles of democracy; go back to the people... Put aside the caucus and convention. Put aside the caucus and convention system [and] have your primary election."

### Rapid Spread (1903-1917)

Following Wisconsin's lead, states rapidly adopted direct primaries.

**Adoption Timeline**

| Period | States Adopting | Total with Primaries |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 1903-1906 | 10 | 10 |
| 1907-1910 | 20+ | 30+ |
| 1911-1917 | 15+ | 44 |
| By 1917 | - | All but 4 states |

**Southern "White Primaries"**

The South adopted primaries with a troubling twist:

- Primary limited to white Democrats
- "Whites only" restrictions excluded Black voters
- Since Democrats dominated, primary was the only meaningful election
- Effectively disenfranchised Black citizens until struck down in 1944

### Progressive Era Ideals

**The Theory**

Progressive reformers believed direct primaries would:

1. Break machine control over nominations
2. Empower ordinary citizens
3. Produce better candidates
4. Reduce corruption
5. Make government more responsive

**The Reality**

| Goal | Outcome |
|------|---------|
| Break machines | Partially successful; new forms of control emerged |
| Empower citizens | Mixed; low turnout limited impact |
| Better candidates | Unclear; quality is subjective |
| Reduce corruption | Some success; new problems arose |
| Responsive government | Partially; but unintended consequences |

## Presidential Primaries

### Origins (1901-1912)

Presidential primaries developed separately from state primaries.

**First Presidential Primaries**

| State | Year | Type |
|-------|------|------|
| Florida | 1901 | Preference primary (advisory) |
| Wisconsin | 1905 | Preference primary |
| Oregon | 1910 | First binding primary |
| Multiple states | 1912 | Wave of adoption |

**The 1912 Election**

The 1912 Republican primary fight between Theodore Roosevelt and William Howard Taft demonstrated primary power and limitations:

- Roosevelt won most primaries
- Taft controlled convention through party machinery
- Taft nominated despite losing primaries
- Roosevelt ran third party, splitting vote
- Democrat Woodrow Wilson won

**Lesson**: Primaries mattered, but party control of convention still decisive.

### Decline and Resurgence (1916-1968)

**The Decline**

After initial enthusiasm, presidential primaries lost influence:

| Period | Number of Primary States | Delegate % from Primaries |
|--------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| 1916 | 20+ | ~50% |
| 1920s | Declining | ~40% |
| 1936 | 12 | ~36% |
| 1960 | 16 | ~38% |

**Why Primaries Declined**

- Expensive for states to administer
- Party leaders preferred convention control
- Primaries seen as optional
- Candidates could skip primaries and still win

**The Kennedy Example (1960)**

John F. Kennedy used primaries strategically to prove electability:

| Primary | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Wisconsin | Prove regional appeal |
| West Virginia | Prove a Catholic could win Protestant state |

Kennedy won nomination through combination of primary victories and convention maneuvering, the last successful use of the old hybrid system.

### The 1968 Watershed

The 1968 Democratic convention fundamentally changed presidential primaries.

**What Happened**

1. President Johnson withdrew after poor New Hampshire showing
2. Robert Kennedy and Eugene McCarthy competed in primaries
3. Vice President Humphrey entered late, skipped primaries
4. Kennedy assassinated after California primary
5. Chicago convention: Humphrey nominated despite winning no primaries
6. Violent protests outside convention
7. Legitimacy crisis for Democratic Party

**The Aftermath**

The chaos led to the McGovern-Fraser Commission and fundamental reform of the nomination process.

## The McGovern-Fraser Reforms (1968-1972)

### The Commission

The Democratic Party created the Commission on Party Structure and Delegate Selection, chaired by Senator George McGovern and later Representative Donald Fraser.

**Key Reforms**

| Reform | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Binding primaries/caucuses | Delegates must reflect voter preferences |
| Proportional representation | End winner-take-all at state level |
| Demographic representation | Include women, minorities, youth |
| Transparent rules | Published, known in advance |
| Eliminate "favorite son" manipulation | Reduce insider deals |

**Effects**

| Before McGovern-Fraser | After McGovern-Fraser |
|-----------------------|----------------------|
| ~17 states with primaries | ~30+ states with primaries |
| Convention decided | Primaries decided |
| Party bosses controlled | Voters controlled |
| Closed process | Open process |

### Republican Response

Republicans adopted similar reforms, though less dramatically:

- More states adopted primaries
- Delegate allocation tied to voter preference
- Less stringent demographic requirements
- Maintained some winner-take-all states

### Unintended Consequences

| Intended Effect | Unintended Consequence |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| More voter control | More media influence |
| Weaker party bosses | Weaker party institutions |
| Open process | Longer campaign season |
| Representative delegates | Primary calendar chaos |
| Democratic legitimacy | Front-loading race |

## The Front-Loading Era (1976-Present)

### What Is Front-Loading

States moved their primaries earlier in the calendar to gain influence, creating a compressed primary season.

**The Logic**

- Early states get more attention
- Late states are irrelevant if race decided
- Candidates focus resources on early states
- Media narrative shaped by early results

**Timeline of Front-Loading**

| Year | Super Tuesday States | Trend |
|------|---------------------|-------|
| 1984 | 9 (March 13) | First Super Tuesday |
| 1988 | 14 | Southern Super Tuesday |
| 2000 | 16 | Continued acceleration |
| 2008 | 24 (Feb 5) | Peak front-loading |
| 2020 | 14 (March 3) | Some moderation |

### Iowa and New Hampshire

The first-in-the-nation status of Iowa and New Hampshire became institutionalized.

**Iowa's Rise**

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1972 | Carter's surprise showing launches candidacy |
| 1976 | Iowa "winner" Carter wins nomination |
| 1980 | Iowa cements first position |
| Present | State law mandates 8 days before any caucus |

**New Hampshire's Protection**

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1920 | First primary |
| 1952 | Eisenhower upset victory draws attention |
| 1975 | State law: Must be 7 days before any primary |
| Present | Fierce defense of first-primary status |

**Criticisms**

| Issue | Concern |
|-------|---------|
| Unrepresentative | Both states whiter, older than nation |
| Retail politics | Advantages well-funded campaigns |
| Outsized influence | Small states winnow field for everyone |
| Frozen in place | No rational basis for their position |

### Party Attempts to Control Calendar

**Democratic Reforms**

| Year | Reform Attempt |
|------|----------------|
| 1984 | Created "window" for primaries |
| 2008 | Punished Florida, Michigan for early votes |
| 2020 | Maintained IA, NH, NV, SC order |
| 2024 | Reordered early states (SC first) |

**Republican Approach**

- Less rigid calendar control
- Penalty system for early states
- Allowed more state flexibility
- Winner-take-all rules in later states

## The Rise of Super PACs and Changed Primary Dynamics (2010-Present)

### Citizens United Effect on Primaries

The 2010 *Citizens United* decision changed primary campaign dynamics.

**New Reality**

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| Candidates needed broad donor base | Single billionaire could fund campaign |
| Party support crucial | Outside money could substitute |
| Money primary decisive | Easier to stay viable longer |
| Frontrunner advantages | Insurgents could compete |

### Extended Primary Battles

Unlimited outside spending allowed primary campaigns to continue longer:

| Year | Extended Contest |
|------|-----------------|
| 2012 | Romney vs. Santorum, Gingrich (Adelson funding) |
| 2016 | Trump vs. Cruz, Kasich to end |
| 2016 | Clinton vs. Sanders to June |
| 2020 | Democratic field large and contested |

## Recent Reforms and Experiments

### Ranked Choice Voting in Primaries

**Maine (2018-Present)**

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Offices | Federal primaries |
| Method | Instant runoff voting |
| Effect | Allows ranking of candidates |

**Alaska (2020)**

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| System | Top-four primary + RCV general |
| Scope | State and federal offices |
| First use | 2022 elections |

### Top-Two Primaries

**California (2010)**

Proposition 14 created the "top-two" system:

- All candidates on single ballot
- All voters participate
- Top two advance regardless of party
- Implemented 2012

**Washington (2004)**

Initiative 872 created similar system after earlier version struck down.

### Presidential Primary Calendar Reform

**2024 Democratic Changes**

| Position | State | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| 1 | South Carolina | Diversity, Biden support |
| 2 (tie) | Nevada, New Hampshire | Compromise |
| 4 | Georgia | Battleground, diversity |
| 5 | Michigan | Labor, industrial Midwest |

New Hampshire resisted, holding unsanctioned primary.

## Lessons from History

### Lesson 1: Reform Has Unintended Consequences

| Intended | Unintended |
|----------|------------|
| Break boss control | Shifted power to media, money |
| Voter participation | Low turnout limits representativeness |
| Democratic legitimacy | Extreme candidates win primaries |
| Party renewal | Party weakness, dysfunction |

### Lesson 2: Parties Adapt and Resist

- Parties lost control of nominations but gained other powers
- Rules manipulation continues
- Superdelegates created (then reduced)
- Calendar control attempted repeatedly
- Money finds new channels

### Lesson 3: Path Dependence Is Powerful

- Iowa and New Hampshire status persists irrationally
- Closed primaries persist despite independent growth
- Reforms happen in crisis moments (1968, 2020)
- Incremental change is slow

### Lesson 4: State-Level Innovation Leads

| State | Innovation |
|-------|------------|
| Wisconsin | First comprehensive primary (1903) |
| Oregon | First binding presidential primary (1910) |
| Washington | Top-two experiment (2004) |
| Maine | RCV in primaries (2016) |
| Alaska | Top-four with RCV (2020) |

National reform follows state experimentation.

### Lesson 5: Money and Media Shape Outcomes

- McGovern-Fraser shifted power from bosses
- But power went to money and media, not voters
- Citizens United amplified money's role
- Media narrative crucial in primaries
- "Electability" framing shapes choices

### Lesson 6: Participation Remains Limited

Despite reforms designed to open the process:

- Turnout remains low (15-25%)
- Electorates remain unrepresentative
- Independents often excluded
- Activists disproportionately influential
- Structural barriers persist
