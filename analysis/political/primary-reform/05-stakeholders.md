# Primary Reform: Stakeholders

## Who Benefits from the Status Quo

### Political Parties

Both major parties benefit from current primary systems in different ways.

**Democratic Party**

| Benefit | How |
|---------|-----|
| Control over nominations | Closed primaries limit who participates |
| Base mobilization | Party registration creates identity |
| Incumbent protection | Low turnout helps known quantities |
| Ideological coherence | Primary voters more consistently liberal |

**Republican Party**

| Benefit | How |
|---------|-----|
| Control over nominations | Same closed primary advantages |
| Base activation | Primaries energize conservative voters |
| Incumbent protection | Same advantages |
| Ideological purity | Primary voters more consistently conservative |

**Party Apparatus Interests**

| Stakeholder | Interest in Status Quo |
|-------------|----------------------|
| National committee | Control over presidential calendar |
| State committees | Influence over nominations |
| County/local parties | Gatekeeping role |
| Party staff | Job security tied to party power |

### Incumbents and Elected Officials

Current officeholders are the biggest beneficiaries of existing primary systems.

**Advantages for Incumbents**

| Advantage | Mechanism |
|-----------|-----------|
| Name recognition | Dominates in low-information primaries |
| Fundraising | War chest deters challengers |
| Party support | Official backing of incumbent |
| Gerrymandered districts | Often drawn to protect them |
| Low turnout | Engaged voters know incumbent |

**Evidence**

| Metric | Data |
|--------|------|
| House incumbents winning primaries | ~98% |
| State legislators winning primaries | ~95% |
| Incumbents facing serious challenge | ~10-15% |

### Ideological Activists

Party activists and ideologically motivated voters benefit from closed, low-turnout primaries.

**Activist Advantages**

| Advantage | How It Works |
|-----------|-------------|
| Outsized influence | Small electorate amplifies organized voters |
| Ideological purity | Can demand loyalty on key issues |
| Primary threat power | Ability to challenge insufficiently pure candidates |
| Gatekeeping | Screen candidates before general electorate sees them |

**Activist Groups**

| Side | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Progressive | Justice Democrats, Sunrise Movement, Working Families Party |
| Conservative | Club for Growth, Freedom Caucus-aligned groups, Tea Party remnants |
| Issue-specific | NRA, Planned Parenthood, unions, business associations |

### Interest Groups

Organized interests benefit from low-turnout primaries where their influence is magnified.

**How They Benefit**

| Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Endorsements | High value in low-information environment |
| Member mobilization | Can swing small electorate |
| Donation bundling | Financial leverage over candidates |
| Threat of primary challenge | Discipline incumbents |

**Key Interest Groups**

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Business | Chamber of Commerce, industry associations |
| Labor | AFL-CIO, SEIU, teachers' unions |
| Ideological | NARAL, NRA, Club for Growth |
| Professional | Bar associations, medical associations |

### Political Consultants and Professionals

The election industry benefits from the current system.

| Stakeholder | Interest |
|-------------|----------|
| Consultants | Expertise in current system is valuable |
| Pollsters | Understand current primary dynamics |
| Media buyers | Existing relationships and knowledge |
| Fundraisers | Know how to work current donor networks |

## Who Is Harmed

### Independent Voters

The largest group of voters is often excluded or marginalized.

**The Exclusion**

| State Type | Independent Access |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Closed primaries (~14 states) | Cannot participate |
| Semi-closed | Limited participation |
| Open primaries | Can participate but often don't |

**Scale of Harm**

| Metric | Data |
|--------|------|
| Americans identifying as independent | ~40% |
| Independents in closed primary states | ~50 million |
| Independents who would vote in primaries if allowed | Significant majority (surveys) |

**Consequences**

- No voice in most consequential elections
- Representatives not accountable to them
- Forced to register with party they don't identify with, or be excluded
- Democratic legitimacy undermined

### Moderate Voters

Voters in the ideological center are systematically underrepresented.

**The Squeeze**

| Factor | Effect on Moderates |
|--------|-------------------|
| Primary electorate composition | Dominated by ideological voters |
| Candidate positioning | Must appeal to base, not center |
| General election choices | Often between two relative extremes |
| Representation | Moderate views underrepresented |

**Evidence**

- Congressional voting patterns more polarized than public opinion
- Self-identified moderates report feeling unrepresented
- "Lesser of two evils" voting common among centrists

### Moderate Candidates

Candidates seeking to build broad coalitions face structural disadvantages.

**Challenges**

| Challenge | Consequence |
|-----------|-------------|
| Primary electorate | Must satisfy base voters to win |
| Media coverage | Moderate positions less newsworthy |
| Activist opposition | Targeted for being insufficiently pure |
| Fundraising | Base donors prefer ideological candidates |

**Historical Casualties**

- Primary losses by candidates who won previous general elections
- "RINO" and "DINO" purges
- Moderate incumbents retiring rather than facing primary

### Young Voters

Young voters face particular barriers to primary participation.

**Barriers**

| Barrier | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Registration deadlines | Often miss in states with early deadlines |
| Primary timing | Often during school year, summer |
| Low awareness | Less likely to know when primaries occur |
| Party affiliation | Less likely to be registered with party |

**Consequences**

- Youth turnout in primaries very low (~10-15%)
- Issues important to young voters underrepresented
- Candidates don't prioritize youth outreach

### Minority Voters

In some contexts, current primary systems disadvantage minority communities.

**Issues**

| Issue | Manifestation |
|-------|--------------|
| Turnout barriers | Same barriers as general, amplified |
| Primary timing | May conflict with work schedules |
| Candidate diversity | Pipeline issues compounded |
| Safe district dynamics | May be packed into non-competitive primaries |

### Third-Party and Independent Candidates

Candidates outside the two-party system are disadvantaged.

**Structural Barriers**

| Barrier | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Top-two primaries | Often eliminated before general |
| Sore loser laws | Cannot run if lost major party primary |
| Ballot access | Different requirements than major parties |
| Media coverage | Ignored in primary coverage |

### General Electorate

All voters suffer from the downstream effects of dysfunctional primaries.

**Consequences for Everyone**

| Consequence | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Polarization | More extreme representatives |
| Gridlock | Less compromise and legislation |
| Unrepresentative choices | Often between two unappealing options |
| Reduced accountability | Safe seat incumbents face no consequences |

## Who Has Power to Change Things

### State Legislators

State legislatures control most primary election rules.

**Their Power**

| Power | Scope |
|-------|-------|
| Set primary type | Open, closed, top-two, etc. |
| Determine timing | When primaries occur |
| Registration rules | Deadlines, party affiliation requirements |
| Implementation | Administrative details |

**Limitation**: Self-interest; legislators won under current rules.

### Voters (Via Ballot Initiative)

In states with ballot initiatives, voters can bypass legislators.

**Potential**

| State Type | Possibility |
|------------|-------------|
| Initiative states (~24) | Citizens can propose reform |
| Referendum states | Legislature can refer to voters |
| No initiative | Must rely on legislature |

**Success Stories**

| State | Year | Reform via Ballot |
|-------|------|------------------|
| California | 2010 | Top-two primary (Prop 14) |
| Alaska | 2020 | Top-four with RCV |
| Colorado | 2016 | Open primaries (Prop 108) |
| Nevada | 2022 | Top-five with RCV (confirmation pending) |

### Political Parties

Parties have significant control over their own primaries.

**Party Powers**

| Power | Scope |
|-------|-------|
| Presidential calendar | DNC/RNC set windows |
| Delegate rules | How delegates allocated |
| Party registration | Who counts as member |
| Endorsement processes | Pre-primary support |

**Limitations**: State law often overrides party preferences on many issues.

### Courts

Judicial decisions shape what reforms are possible.

**Key Powers**

| Court | Influence |
|-------|-----------|
| U.S. Supreme Court | Constitutional limits on reform |
| Federal appellate courts | Interpret election law |
| State supreme courts | State constitutional issues |

**Key Precedents**

| Case | Holding |
|------|---------|
| *California Democratic Party v. Jones* (2000) | Blanket primaries unconstitutional (party rights) |
| *Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party* (2008) | Top-two primaries constitutional |
| *Tashjian v. Republican Party* (1986) | Party can open primary if it wishes |

### Congress

Limited role but some influence.

**Potential Powers**

| Power | Current Status |
|-------|----------------|
| Presidential primary calendar | Rarely exercised |
| Federal election standards | Could set some rules |
| DC and territories | Direct control |

**Practical Reality**: Congress has largely deferred to states on primary design.
