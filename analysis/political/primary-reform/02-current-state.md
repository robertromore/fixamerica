# Primary Reform: Current State

## The Problem Today

### Primary Elections in America

Primary elections serve as the gatekeeping mechanism for American democracy, determining which candidates appear on the general election ballot. Yet the current primary system suffers from multiple dysfunctions:

- **Low participation**: Only 15-25% of eligible voters typically participate
- **Unrepresentative electorates**: Primary voters are older, wealthier, and more ideological than the general population
- **Exclusion of independents**: Over 40% of Americans identify as independent, yet many are locked out of closed primaries
- **Polarization incentives**: Safe-seat dynamics make primaries the only meaningful election, rewarding extremism
- **Fragmented systems**: 50 states with 50 different approaches create a confusing patchwork

### The Numbers

**Primary Participation (State Legislative Primaries)**

| Metric | Typical Range |
|--------|---------------|
| Registered voter turnout | 15-25% |
| Voting-age population turnout | 10-20% |
| Competitive primary turnout | 20-35% |
| Uncontested primary turnout | 5-15% |

**Who Is Excluded**

| Group | Estimated Number | Exclusion Status |
|-------|------------------|------------------|
| Independent voters | ~50 million | Cannot vote in ~14 closed primary states |
| Unregistered eligible voters | ~60 million | Cannot vote in any primary |
| Voters registered with minor parties | ~3-5 million | Often excluded from major party primaries |

## State Primary Systems

### Closed Primaries

In closed primary states, only voters registered with a political party may vote in that party's primary.

**States with Closed Primaries (~14 states)**

| State | Deadline to Change Registration | Notes |
|-------|-------------------------------|-------|
| Delaware | 60 days before primary | Strict closed |
| Florida | 29 days before primary | Large independent population affected |
| Kentucky | 21 days before primary | Strict closed |
| Maryland | 21 days before primary | Strict closed |
| Nevada | 14 days before primary | Strict closed |
| New Mexico | 28 days before primary | Strict closed |
| New York | 25 days before general (Oct) | De facto year ahead |
| Oregon | 21 days before primary | Strict closed |
| Pennsylvania | 15 days before primary | Strict closed |
| Connecticut | 3 months before primary | Recently loosened for unaffiliated |
| Kansas | 21 days before primary | Closed for presidential |
| Maine | 15 days before primary | Closed for some offices |
| Wyoming | 14 days before primary | Closed |
| Nebraska | 10 days before primary | Closed for partisan offices |

**Impact of Closed Primaries**

| Consequence | Evidence |
|-------------|----------|
| Independent exclusion | ~4.5 million Florida independents cannot vote in primaries |
| Lower turnout | Closed primary states average 3-5% lower turnout |
| Party incentive to shrink base | Parties may prefer smaller, ideological electorates |
| Democratic legitimacy concerns | Winners chosen by fraction of electorate |

### Semi-Closed Primaries

Independent (unaffiliated) voters can participate in a party primary, but registered members of other parties cannot cross over.

**States with Semi-Closed Primaries (~11 states)**

| State | Rules for Independents |
|-------|----------------------|
| Arizona | Independents choose one primary |
| Colorado | Independents automatically receive both ballots (return one) |
| Connecticut | Unaffiliated may vote in either primary |
| Iowa | Independents may affiliate at polls |
| Kansas | Independents may affiliate at polls (state races) |
| Massachusetts | Unenrolled voters may choose primary |
| New Hampshire | Undeclared voters may choose primary |
| North Carolina | Unaffiliated voters may choose primary |
| Rhode Island | Unaffiliated may vote in primary |
| Utah | Parties may allow independent participation |
| West Virginia | Independents may vote in primaries |

**Semi-Closed Characteristics**

- Increases independent participation vs. closed systems
- Still restricts registered members of opposite party
- Creates incentive to remain unaffiliated
- Parties retain substantial control over process

### Open Primaries

Any registered voter may participate in any party's primary, regardless of their party registration.

**States with Open Primaries (~15 states)**

| State | System Details |
|-------|----------------|
| Alabama | Open primary, must choose one party |
| Arkansas | Open primary |
| Georgia | Open primary |
| Hawaii | Open primary (by party rule) |
| Michigan | Open primary |
| Minnesota | Open primary |
| Mississippi | Open primary |
| Missouri | Open primary |
| Montana | Open primary |
| South Carolina | Open primary |
| Tennessee | Open primary |
| Texas | Open primary |
| Vermont | Open primary |
| Virginia | Open primary |
| Wisconsin | Open primary |

**Open Primary Characteristics**

| Feature | Assessment |
|---------|------------|
| Participation | Higher turnout than closed primaries |
| Crossover voting | Rare but possible; controversial |
| Moderate candidates | Mixed evidence on effects |
| Party concerns | Worry about "raiding" by opposition |

### Top-Two Primary Systems

All candidates appear on a single ballot; top two vote-getters advance to general election regardless of party.

**States with Top-Two Primaries**

| State | Adopted | Offices Covered | Notes |
|-------|---------|-----------------|-------|
| California | 2010 (Prop 14) | State/federal (not president) | Called "Top-Two Open Primary" |
| Washington | 2004 (I-872) | State/federal (not president) | Party labels on ballot |
| Nebraska | 1934 | State legislature only | Unicameral, nonpartisan |

**Top-Two Mechanics**

1. All candidates appear on single primary ballot
2. All voters may participate regardless of party
3. Top two vote-getters advance to general election
4. General election may feature two candidates from same party
5. Write-in candidates generally prohibited in general election

**Top-Two Outcomes**

| Election Type | Frequency (CA 2012-2024) |
|---------------|-------------------------|
| Same-party general election | ~15-25% of races |
| Democrat vs. Democrat | More common in blue areas |
| Republican vs. Republican | More common in red areas |
| Third-party in general | Very rare (<1%) |

**Controversies**

| Issue | Concern |
|-------|---------|
| Third-party exclusion | Minor parties rarely reach general election |
| Campaign costs | Two competitive races instead of one |
| Voter confusion | Same-party races may confuse voters |
| Strategic voting | Incentive to game which candidates advance |

### Top-Four Primary with RCV

Alaska's system, adopted in 2020 and first used in 2022, represents the newest model.

**Alaska's System**

| Stage | How It Works |
|-------|-------------|
| Primary | All candidates on single nonpartisan ballot |
| Primary outcome | Top four vote-getters advance |
| General election | Ranked choice voting among four candidates |
| Winner determination | Instant runoff until majority achieved |

**First Results (2022)**

| Race | Outcome |
|------|---------|
| U.S. House Special | Democrat Mary Peltola won 3-way race |
| U.S. House Regular | Peltola won again in 4-way race |
| U.S. Senate | Republican Lisa Murkowski retained seat |
| Governor | Republican Mike Dunleavy reelected |

**Observations from Alaska**

- Incumbents and well-known candidates performed well
- Moderate candidates potentially advantaged
- Voter understanding improved over time
- Some ballot exhaustion observed
- High-profile races attracted attention to new system

### Louisiana's Jungle Primary

Louisiana uses a unique nonpartisan "jungle primary" system.

**Louisiana System**

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Primary | All candidates regardless of party on same ballot |
| Winning threshold | 50%+ in primary wins outright |
| Runoff | If no majority, top two face runoff |
| Timing | Primary on general election day; runoff in December |

**Characteristics**

- Can produce winner on "primary" day
- Runoffs often have low turnout
- Creates December runoffs after national attention fades
- Criticized for low-turnout runoff elections

## Presidential Primary System

### Current Structure

Presidential primaries operate under different rules than state primaries, with significant party involvement.

**Key Features**

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Delegate allocation | Candidates earn delegates based on results |
| State party control | Significant role in setting rules |
| National party rules | DNC and RNC set some parameters |
| Timing windows | Parties establish when states can vote |
| Caucuses vs. primaries | States choose format |

### The Primary Calendar

**Early States (Traditional)**

| State | Rationale | Controversy |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Iowa | Caucus tradition; small state |  Unrepresentative; logistics issues |
| New Hampshire | Statutory first primary | Unrepresentative; tradition over merit |
| Nevada | Western state; diverse | Added for geographic diversity |
| South Carolina | Southern state; African American voters | Added for demographic diversity |

**DNC 2024 Calendar Reform**

The Democratic National Committee reordered early states for 2024:

| Position | State | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| 1st | South Carolina | More diverse electorate |
| 2nd | Nevada/New Hampshire (same day) | Diversity + tradition |
| 4th | Georgia | Battleground state; diverse |
| 5th | Michigan | Industrial Midwest; diverse |

**Front-Loading**

| Decade | States Before March 15 | Trend |
|--------|----------------------|-------|
| 1970s | ~10 | Early process |
| 1990s | ~25 | Acceleration |
| 2008 | ~40 (Super Tuesday Feb 5) | Peak front-loading |
| 2020 | ~30+ (Super Tuesday March 3) | Still front-loaded |

**Front-Loading Effects**

- Candidates must raise money quickly
- Early momentum matters enormously
- Later states have diminished influence
- Compressed timeline limits deliberation
- Favors well-funded, well-known candidates

### Caucuses vs. Primaries

**Comparison**

| Feature | Caucus | Primary |
|---------|--------|---------|
| Format | In-person meetings, hours long | Vote at polling place |
| Turnout | Very low (3-15%) | Higher (15-40%) |
| Participation barriers | High (time, mobility, childcare) | Lower |
| Party control | Strong | Moderate |
| Delegate selection | Complex multi-stage | Usually direct |

**Caucus States (2024)**

| Party | States Using Caucuses |
|-------|---------------------|
| Democratic | Very few (most switched to primaries) |
| Republican | Several smaller states |

**Trend Away from Caucuses**

After 2016 and 2020 controversies (Iowa Democratic caucus problems), many states shifted to primaries for accessibility and accuracy.

## Primary Turnout Data

### Historical Trends

**Congressional Primary Turnout**

| Year | Average Turnout (Registered Voters) |

| 2014 | 14.6% |
| 2016 | 19.7% |
| 2018 | 19.2% |
| 2020 | 21.3% |
| 2022 | 17.8% |

| Open primary system | +2-4% |
| Same-day registration | +3-5% |
| High-profile candidate | +3-10% |

### Who Votes in Primaries

**Demographic Profile of Primary Voters**

| Characteristic | Primary Voters vs. General |
|---------------|---------------------------|
| Age 65+ | Overrepresented by 10-15% |
| Age 18-29 | Underrepresented by 15-20% |
| College degree | Overrepresented by 10-15% |
| Income $100K+ | Overrepresented by 5-10% |
| White | Slightly overrepresented |
| Ideological extremes | Significantly overrepresented |

**Partisan Composition**

| Measure | Finding |
|---------|---------|

## Contested vs. Uncontested Primaries

### The Competition Problem

**House of Representatives Primaries**

| Category | Approximate Share |
|----------|------------------|
| Uncontested primaries | 50-60% |
| Contested but uncompetitive | 25-35% |
| Genuinely competitive | 10-20% |

**State Legislative Primaries**

| Category | Approximate Share |
|----------|------------------|
| Uncontested | 60-70% |
| Contested but uncompetitive | 20-30% |
| Genuinely competitive | 5-15% |

### Why So Few Contested Primaries

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Incumbency advantage | Incumbents almost always win primaries |
| Fundraising barriers | Challengers cannot match incumbent war chests |
| Party support | Party structures support incumbents |
| Recruitment failure | Parties don't recruit primary challengers |
| Safe seat logic | Primary is only contest, but incumbents dominate it |

## Sore Loser Laws

### What They Are

Sore loser laws prevent candidates who lose a primary from appearing on the general election ballot as an independent or third-party candidate.

**Prevalence**

| Category | Number of States |
|----------|-----------------|
| States with sore loser laws | ~45 |
| States without sore loser laws | ~5 |
| Laws covering president | ~15 |

**States Without Sore Loser Laws**

| State | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| Connecticut | No sore loser law |
| Iowa | No sore loser law |
| New York | Allows cross-endorsement |
| Vermont | No sore loser law |
| Various | Partial exemptions |

### Effects of Sore Loser Laws

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Entrenches two-party system | Losing primary ends candidacy |
| Protects party nominees | No general election challenge from within |
| Limits voter choice | Voters cannot support popular losers |
| Controversy | Seen as anti-democratic by some |

## Same-Day Registration for Primaries

### Current Status

| Registration Rule | Number of States |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Same-day registration in primaries | ~21 states + DC |
| Election Day registration only | ~10 states |
| Pre-registration required | ~20 states |

**States with Same-Day Primary Registration**

| State | Registration Option |
|-------|-------------------|
| California | Conditional voter registration |
| Colorado | Same-day registration |
| Connecticut | Same-day for primaries |
| Hawaii | Same-day registration |
| Illinois | Grace period registration |
| Maine | Same-day registration |
| Maryland | Same-day registration |
| Minnesota | Same-day registration |
| And others | Various systems |

### Impact on Primary Participation

| Effect | Evidence |
|--------|----------|
| Increased turnout | 3-7% higher where available |
| Youth participation | Especially beneficial for young voters |
| Independents | Enables late decision-makers |
| Administrative burden | Requires poll worker training |

## Recent Reforms and Trends

### States That Recently Reformed Primaries

| State | Year | Reform |
|-------|------|--------|
| Alaska | 2020 | Top-four primary with RCV (Measure 2) |
| Nevada | 2022, 2024 | Top-five primary with RCV (Question 3, needs 2024 confirmation) |

| Various | RCV expansions | Multiple states |

## Key Takeaways

1. **System fragmentation**: 50 states use many different primary systems with no national standard

2. **Low participation**: Primary turnout averages 15-25%, meaning small electorates choose nominees

3. **Independent exclusion**: Closed primaries lock out growing independent population (~40%+ of voters)

4. **Uncontested races**: Majority of primaries are uncontested, especially in safe seats

5. **Reform momentum**: Alaska, Nevada, and other states experimenting with new systems

6. **Presidential primary chaos**: Front-loading, calendar fights, and caucus problems persist

7. **Sore loser laws**: Most states prevent primary losers from running in general election

8. **Turnout demographics**: Primary voters are older, wealthier, more educated, and more ideological than general electorate
