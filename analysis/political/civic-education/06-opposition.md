### Parent Rights

**Core Claim**:

Parents, not schools, should direct civic formation.

**Key Arguments**:

**Counterarguments**:

- Public schools have civic mission since founding
- Democratic citizenship requires some common knowledge

## Polarization Concerns

### Controversy in Classroom

**Core Claim**:

Classroom discussions of controversial issues are risky.

**Key Arguments**:

- Teachers can't be neutral
- Creates conflict with families
- Schools should be "safe spaces"

**Impact**:

- Teachers avoid current events
- Discussion limited or eliminated
- Controversial issues skipped
- Civic education becomes shallow

**Counterarguments**:

- Avoiding controversy makes civics irrelevant
- Students need to learn to handle disagreement
- Professional norms guide teachers
- Democracy requires engaging difference

### Both Sides Concerns

**Left Concerns**:

- "Both sides" framing false equivalence
- Some positions are factually wrong
- Neutrality enables harmful views
- Teacher silence implies endorsement
