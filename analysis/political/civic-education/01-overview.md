# Civic Education: Overview

## Executive Summary

Civic education—teaching citizens about their government, rights, and responsibilities—is fundamental to democratic self-governance. American civic education has declined significantly over decades, with reduced instruction time, eliminated requirements, and inadequate teacher preparation. The result is a citizenry poorly equipped to participate in democracy: low political knowledge, declining trust, vulnerability to misinformation, and disengagement from civic life. Revitalizing civic education requires curriculum reform, teacher support, experiential learning, and media literacy for the digital age.

## The Core Questions

1. **Knowledge**: Do Americans understand how their government works?
2. **Skills**: Can citizens evaluate information, deliberate, and participate effectively?
3. **Disposition**: Do citizens feel responsible for democratic self-governance?
4. **Equity**: Is quality civic education available to all students?
5. **Relevance**: Does civic education address contemporary challenges?

| States with civics assessment | 12 |
| Average civics instruction time | Declining |
| Social studies teacher preparation | Inadequate |
| Civics in standardized testing | Mostly absent |

### Key Challenges

| Challenge | Description | Impact |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Curriculum marginalization | Focus on tested subjects | Less civics instruction |
| Shallow coverage | Memorization over engagement | Poor retention and skills |
| Equity gaps | Resources vary dramatically | Unequal preparation |

## Why This Matters

### For Democracy
