# Civic Education: Roadmap

## Strategic Considerations

### State-by-State Approach

Education is primarily a state function, so reform must work state by state:

- Build momentum through leading states
- Share successful models across states
- Federal support but not mandate
- Adapt to local contexts

### Bipartisan Framing

Civic education must transcend partisan divides:

- Focus on knowledge and skills
- Include founding documents and Constitution
- Emphasize media literacy (shared concern)
- Avoid partisan hot-button framings
- Build diverse coalitions

### Inside-Outside Strategy

Change requires both system reform and external pressure:

- Work with education agencies and schools
- Build public support and demand
- Engage philanthropy and nonprofits
- Leverage media and advocacy
