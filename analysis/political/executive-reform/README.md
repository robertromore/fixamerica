# Executive Reform: Overview

The American presidency has accumulated powers far beyond what the Constitution's framers envisioned. Through a combination of congressional delegation, judicial deference, executive assertion, and national security imperatives, the modern president exercises authority that would be unrecognizable to the founding generation. This concentration of power in a single individual poses risks to democratic accountability, constitutional balance, and the rule of law regardless of which party holds the White House.
