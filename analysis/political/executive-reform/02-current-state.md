# Executive Reform: Current State

## Executive Orders and Directives

### 2024 Snapshot

- The Biden administration issued 140+ executive orders by the end of 2024 and relied heavily on memoranda and proclamations to drive climate, student-debt, and immigration policy in the face of a polarized Congress.
- Emergency declarations (COVID-19 tail, border security, fentanyl importation) remained a preferred tool for the administration even as Congress debated broader statutory reforms.
- Major actions that touch statutory authority (student aid, climate) were accompanied by detailed legal justifications, but courts and Congress continue to parse their limits.

### Volume and Scope

Modern presidents issue approximately 30-50 executive orders annually, but this number understates executive unilateralism:

- **Presidential memoranda**: Often indistinguishable from executive orders but not numbered or consistently published
- **Presidential proclamations**: Used for emergencies, tariffs, and policy declarations
- **National security directives**: Classified orders that may remain secret indefinitely
- **Signing statements**: Assertions of authority to ignore parts of laws being signed

### Recent Trends

| Administration | Executive Orders | Notable Uses |
|----------------|------------------|--------------|
| Obama | 276 (8 years) | DACA, climate regulations, immigration enforcement priorities |
| Trump | 220 (4 years) | Travel ban, border wall funding, regulatory rollbacks |
| Biden | 140+ (3+ years) | COVID response, climate policy, student loans |

### Legal Status

Executive orders have the force of law when they:

- Direct executive branch operations within existing statutory authority
- Implement powers granted by Congress
- Exercise inherent constitutional authority

Courts have struck down executive orders that:

- Exceed statutory authority (*Youngstown Sheet & Tube v. Sawyer*, 1952)
- Violate constitutional or statutory provisions (travel bans 1.0 and 2.0 enjoined by lower federal courts; *Trump v. Hawaii* (2018) later upheld revised version 3.0)
- Contradict explicit congressional intent

## Emergency Powers

### Current Emergency Declarations

As of the 2024 snapshot, over 40 national emergencies remain in effect, some dating back decades:

| Emergency | Year Declared | Still Active |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| Iran hostage crisis | 1979 | Yes (modified) |
| Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction | 1994 | Yes |
| 9/11 terrorism emergency | 2001 | Yes |
| COVID-19 pandemic | 2020 | Ended 2023 |
| Southern border | 2019 | Contested |

### Powers Activated

National emergencies unlock over 130 statutory powers (per Brennan Center inventory), including:

- Deploying military domestically
- Seizing property
- Restricting communications
- Controlling transportation
- Suspending environmental regulations

### The National Emergencies Act (1976)

Intended to constrain emergency powers but has largely failed:

- Requires congressional review every 6 months (routinely ignored)
- Allows termination by joint resolution (rarely attempted, now requires veto override)
- No substantive limits on what constitutes an "emergency"
- No automatic expiration

## War Powers

### The Constitutional Framework

- **Article I**: Congress has power to declare war, raise armies, fund military
- **Article II**: President is commander-in-chief of armed forces

### The War Powers Resolution (1973)

Passed over Nixon's veto, requires:

- Consultation with Congress before introducing forces into hostilities
- Reporting within 48 hours of deployment
- Withdrawal within 60-90 days without congressional authorization

### Actual Practice (2024 snapshot)

No president has acknowledged the constitutionality of the War Powers Resolution. Recent conflicts:

| Conflict | Congressional Authorization | Duration |
|----------|----------------------------|----------|
| Afghanistan (2001-2021) | 2001 AUMF | 20 years |
| Iraq (2003-2011, ongoing) | 2002 AUMF | 20+ years |
| Libya (2011) | None | 7 months |
| Syria (2014-present) | 2001 AUMF (stretched) | 10+ years |
| Yemen (support) | None claimed necessary | 8+ years |
| Iran strike (2020) | Article II claimed | Single strike |

### Drone Warfare and Targeted Killing

Presidents now claim authority to:

- Order lethal strikes anywhere in the world
- Target U.S. citizens abroad without trial
- Keep strike criteria and casualties classified
- Operate outside declared war zones

## Pardon Power

### Constitutional Scope

Article II grants the president "Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment."

### Recent Controversies

| Pardon/Commutation | Controversy |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Ford pardons Nixon (1974) | Pre-emptive pardon for any crimes |
| Clinton pardons Marc Rich (2001) | Donor's ex-husband; potential corruption |
| Trump pardons associates (2020) | Flynn, Manafort, Stone—potential obstruction |
| Trump pardons Arpaio (2017) | Criminal contempt of court |

### Unresolved Questions

- **Self-pardons**: No president has attempted; legality untested
- **Pardons for future crimes**: Generally thought invalid but unclear
- **Pardon for obstruction**: Can a president pardon witnesses against himself?
- **State crimes**: Pardons only cover federal offenses

## Presidential Immunity

### Current Doctrine

**Criminal immunity during office**:

- DOJ policy (not law) holds sitting president cannot be indicted
- Based on OLC memos from 1973 and 2000
- Never tested in court

**Civil immunity**:

- *Nixon v. Fitzgerald* (1982): Absolute immunity for official acts
- *Clinton v. Jones* (1997): No immunity for unofficial acts, even while in office

**Post-presidency**:

- *Trump v. United States* (2024): Broad immunity for official acts, even after leaving office
- Creates presumption of immunity for acts within "outer perimeter" of duties

### Implications

The 2024 Supreme Court decision significantly expanded presidential immunity:

- Presidents cannot be prosecuted for exercising "core constitutional powers"
- Presumptive immunity for other official acts
- Only "unofficial" acts potentially prosecutable
- Evidence of motive from official acts may be inadmissible

## Independent Agencies

### Traditional Independence

Agencies historically insulated from presidential control:

- Federal Reserve
- Federal Trade Commission
- Securities and Exchange Commission
- Federal Communications Commission
- Consumer Financial Protection Bureau

### Erosion of Independence

Recent developments threatening agency autonomy:

- *Seila Law v. CFPB* (2020): Single-director agencies cannot have for-cause removal protection
- *Collins v. Yellen* (2021): Extended to FHFA
- Pending challenges to multi-member agency removal protections
- Executive orders directing agency priorities

## Executive Privilege

### Scope

Presidents claim privilege over:

- Communications with advisors (deliberative process)
- National security information
- Law enforcement investigations
- Internal executive branch deliberations

### Limits

- *United States v. Nixon* (1974): Privilege not absolute; must yield to criminal process
- *Trump v. Mazars* (2020): Congress has legitimate legislative need for information
- No privilege for misconduct or crime

### Current Conflicts

- Former presidents claiming privilege over documents
- Disputes over congressional testimony by executive officials
- Classification as de facto privilege

## Appointments and Removals

### Confirmation Delays

Senate confirmation has become increasingly contentious:

- Average confirmation time has increased from weeks to months
- Many positions remain vacant for extended periods
- Acting officials serve indefinitely

### Acting Officials

The Vacancies Act allows acting appointments for 210 days, but:

- Presidents have exploited gaps and extensions
- Some "acting" officials serve for years
- Courts have found some acting appointments invalid

### Recess Appointments

- *NLRB v. Noel Canning* (2014): Limited recess appointment power
- Pro forma sessions prevent most recess appointments
- Effectively defunct as presidential tool

## Key Statistics (2024 snapshot)

| Metric | Current Status |
|--------|----------------|
| Active national emergencies | 40+ |
| Years since last declared war | 82 (WWII, 1942) |
| Major military operations without declaration | 100+ since WWII |
| Executive orders (all time) | ~14,000 |
| Average Senate confirmation time | 4-6 months |
| Inspector General vacancies (recent peak) | 5+ simultaneous |
