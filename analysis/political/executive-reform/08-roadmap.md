# Executive Reform: Roadmap

## Strategic Considerations

### The Partisan Timing Problem

Executive reform faces a fundamental challenge: the party in power has no incentive to constrain its own president, while the party out of power lacks the votes to do so.

**Windows of Opportunity**:

- Transition periods (lame duck sessions)
- After presidential scandal affecting both parties
- When reform can be framed as prospective (affecting future presidents)
- Rare moments of bipartisan concern (post-January 6)

### Building Durable Coalitions

Successful reform requires:

- Framing reforms as institutional, not anti-incumbent
- Building coalitions that span partisan divides
- Creating reforms that both parties see as beneficial when out of power
- Engaging civil society organizations across the spectrum

### Sequencing Reforms

Some reforms enable others:

1. **Transparency first**: Disclosure requirements build support for substantive limits
2. **Enforcement mechanisms**: Create tools before trying to use them
3. **Constitutional amendments last**: Build momentum through statutory victories

## Phase 1: Foundation Building (Year 1-2)

### Immediate Legislative Priorities

**Inspector General Protection Act**

- Protect IGs from political removal
- Guarantee funding and access
- Strengthen whistleblower protections
- Likely achievable with bipartisan support

**Ethics Enforcement Enhancement**

- Mandatory tax disclosure for presidents
- Strengthen OGE authority
- Emoluments clarification
- Public interest in disclosure widely shared

**Transparency Improvements**

- Presidential directive publication requirements
- Classified directive notification to Congress
- GAO access to executive branch information

### Administrative Actions

Under a reform-minded administration:

- Revise OLC opinions on executive power
- Restore DOJ independence norms
- Strengthen ethics requirements by executive order
- Release classification guidance
- Restore IG independence

### Coalition Building

**Identify Champions**:

- Senators and Representatives with institutional focus (not just partisan)
- Former executive branch officials willing to speak out
- Legal scholars across the ideological spectrum
- Good government organizations

**Public Education**:

- Document executive overreach across administrations
- Explain constitutional design and its erosion
- Make case for reforms as protecting democracy, not attacking presidents
- Build grassroots support for reform agenda

## Phase 2: Structural Reforms (Year 2-4)

### Emergency Powers Reform

**National Emergencies Reform Act**:

- Automatic termination after 30 days without congressional approval
- Sunset existing emergencies
- Require specificity in emergency declarations
- Create expedited congressional review

**Strategy**:

- Point to 40+ ongoing "emergencies" as abuse
- Frame as congressional authority reclaim
- Build bipartisan coalition around institutional concerns
- Start with least controversial emergencies

### War Powers Enforcement

**War Powers Reform Act**:

- Close War Powers Resolution loopholes
- Define "hostilities" clearly
- Automatic funding restrictions without authorization
- Repeal and replace outdated AUMFs

**Strategy**:

- Build on war-weariness across parties
- Engage veterans' organizations
- Frame as honoring military by requiring deliberation
- Start with AUMF reform (easier than full war powers)

### Acting Officials Reform

**Vacancies Reform Act Amendments**:

- Strict time limits on acting appointments
- Qualification requirements for acting officials
- Penalties for exceeding time limits
- Automatic reversion to career officials

**Strategy**:

- Appeal to senators concerned about confirmation prerogatives
- Document abuses of acting appointments
- Frame as restoring Senate role

## Phase 3: Constitutional and Major Reforms (Year 4-8)

### Pardon Power Amendment

**Amendment Text Development**:

- Prohibit self-pardons
- Bar pardons for obstruction of congressional investigations
- Require pre-pardon disclosure period

**Strategy**:

- Build state-level support through resolutions
- Educate public on pardon power history and abuse
- Frame as completing framers' work
- Time introduction after pardon abuse (reactive moment)

### Presidential Immunity Amendment

**Amendment Text Development**:

- Clarify that no person is above the law
- Permit reasonable procedural protections during term
- Ensure accountability after leaving office

**Strategy**:

- Build on public reaction to immunity decisions
- Frame as fundamental to rule of law
- Engage conservative legal voices concerned about precedent
- Long-term campaign with state ratification strategy

### Independent Agency Protection

**Constitutional or Statutory Framework**:

- If Supreme Court continues striking down independence protections, constitutional amendment may be necessary
- Alternatively, structural reforms to work within court constraints

**Strategy**:

- Monitor court developments
- Build case for independent regulation
- Document consequences of politicization
- Prepare both statutory and constitutional responses

## Phase 4: Consolidation (Year 6-10)

### Enforcement and Adjustment

- Review effectiveness of enacted reforms
- Close loopholes identified through implementation
- Strengthen enforcement mechanisms
- Adapt to judicial decisions

### Norm Restoration

- Document and publicize compliance with reforms
- Build expectations across administrations
- Create institutional memory of reform rationale
- Train new generations of executive branch officials

### International Coordination

- Share best practices with other democracies
- Learn from international experience
- Build international expectations for democratic executive constraints

## Key Milestones

| Milestone | Target | Success Metric |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| IG Protection Act | Year 1 | Enacted with bipartisan support |
| Ethics enforcement bill | Year 1-2 | Mandatory disclosure enacted |
| Emergency powers reform | Year 2-3 | Automatic termination enacted |
| War powers reform | Year 3-4 | AUMF repealed/replaced |
| Acting officials reform | Year 2-3 | Time limits enforced |
| Pardon amendment introduced | Year 4-5 | Significant state support |
| Immunity amendment introduced | Year 5-6 | National conversation begun |

## Risk Assessment

### Political Risks

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Partisan gridlock | High | Frame as institutional; build civil society pressure |
| Presidential veto | High | Veto-proof majorities; wait for transitions |
| Reversal by next administration | Moderate | Statutory over executive; build public expectation |
| Court invalidation | Moderate | Draft carefully; prepare alternatives |

### Implementation Risks

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Evasion through interpretation | High | Specific drafting; monitoring; follow-up legislation |
| Weak enforcement | Moderate | Independent enforcement; automatic triggers |
| Unintended consequences | Moderate | Pilot programs; sunset provisions; review mechanisms |

## Metrics for Success

### Short-term (1-3 years)

- Number of transparency reforms enacted
- IG independence strengthened
- Ethics requirements enhanced
- Bipartisan coalition established

### Medium-term (3-6 years)

- Emergency powers with automatic expiration
- War powers enforcement improved
- Acting official abuses ended
- Executive order review established

### Long-term (6-10 years)

- Constitutional amendments introduced with significant support
- Sustained bipartisan commitment to reform
- New norms of executive restraint established
- International recognition of reform model

## Adaptive Strategy

### If Reform Window Opens

- Have legislation ready for immediate introduction
- Prioritize highest-impact reforms
- Move quickly before window closes
- Accept imperfect compromises to establish precedent

### If Reform Blocked

- Continue public education
- Document ongoing abuses
- Build state-level support
- Prepare for next opportunity

### If Courts Obstruct

- Develop constitutional amendment strategies
- Build public case for reform
- Document consequences of court decisions
- Consider structural reforms to judiciary
