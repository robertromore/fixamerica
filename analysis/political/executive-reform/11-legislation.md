# Executive Reform: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Executive reform legislation must navigate separation of powers constraints while creating enforceable limits on presidential authority. This document provides draft legislative text for emergency powers reform, war powers enforcement, pardon limitations, ethics requirements, and inspector general protections. Where statutory reforms are insufficient, constitutional amendments are proposed.

## Constitutional Amendments

### Presidential Accountability Amendment

**Purpose**: Establish that no president is above the law and limit self-serving uses of pardon power.

**Draft Text**:

```text
Section 1. No person holding the office of President shall be
immune from criminal prosecution for conduct in violation of
federal law. The enforcement of criminal law against a sitting
President may be delayed until the President leaves office,
but the statute of limitations shall be tolled during any
period of such delay.

Section 2. The President shall not have power to grant pardons
or reprieves to himself or herself, nor to any person for the
purpose of obstructing an investigation or proceeding in which
the President is a subject or target.

Section 3. Any pardon or reprieve granted within 60 days of a
presidential election or during the period between an election
and the inauguration of a successor shall not take effect
until 90 days after the inauguration of the next President,
and may be revoked by the next President.

Section 4. Congress shall have power to enforce this article
by appropriate legislation.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 1**: Overturns *Trump v. United States* (2024) immunity holding; permits delay but not immunity
- **Section 2**: Prohibits self-pardons and pardons for obstruction of investigations involving the president
- **Section 3**: Creates cooling-off period for late-term pardons, allowing review by successor
- **Section 4**: Standard enforcement clause

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Ratification difficulty | 3/4 states requirement difficult but not impossible after sufficient crisis |
| Vagueness of "obstruct" | Relies on existing obstruction law definitions |
| Chilling effect on advisors | Only limits pardons for obstruction, not policy disagreements |

**Refinements**:

- Alternative: 90-day waiting period for all pardons involving persons connected to president
- Alternative: Require Senate confirmation for pardons of executive branch officials
- Fallback: Statutory reforms if amendment fails

### Emergency Powers Amendment

**Purpose**: Require congressional authorization for continued emergencies and limit scope of emergency powers.

**Draft Text**:

```text
Section 1. The President may declare a national emergency when
the safety of the nation requires immediate executive action.
Any such declaration shall specify the nature of the emergency,
the statutory authorities activated, and the geographic scope.

Section 2. A national emergency declaration shall terminate
after 30 days unless Congress by joint resolution approves its
continuation. Congress may approve continuation for periods
not exceeding 180 days. Any emergency shall terminate after
two years unless Congress enacts specific legislation extending
it.

Section 3. Congress may terminate any national emergency at any
time by joint resolution, which shall not be subject to
presidential veto.

Section 4. The President may not use emergency powers to
implement policies that Congress has specifically rejected, nor
to appropriate funds not authorized by Congress.

Section 5. Congress shall have power to enforce this article
by appropriate legislation.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 1**: Requires specificity in emergency declarations
- **Section 2**: Creates 30-day automatic termination; 2-year absolute limit
- **Section 3**: Congress can terminate without presidential consent
- **Section 4**: Prevents end-runs around congressional will
- **Section 5**: Standard enforcement clause

## Federal Legislation

### National Emergency Reform Act

**Purpose**: Reform the National Emergencies Act of 1976 to require congressional approval, automatic termination, and specificity.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "National Emergency Reform Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The National Emergencies Act of 1976 was intended to
    constrain presidential emergency powers but has failed
    to do so.
(2) Over 40 national emergencies remain in effect, some
    for decades.
(3) Presidents have used emergency powers for purposes
    unrelated to genuine emergencies.
(4) Congressional oversight mechanisms have proven ineffective.
(5) Reform is necessary to restore constitutional balance.

SEC. 3. TERMINATION OF EXISTING EMERGENCIES.

(a) All national emergencies in effect on the date of enactment
    that have been in effect for more than 5 years shall
    terminate 180 days after enactment unless renewed under
    section 4.

    enactment shall terminate one year after enactment unless
    renewed under section 4.

SEC. 4. DECLARATION AND RENEWAL REQUIREMENTS.

(a) SPECIFICITY.—Any declaration of national emergency shall
    specify—
    (1) the specific nature of the emergency;
    (2) each statutory provision activated by the declaration;
    (3) the geographic scope of the emergency;
    (4) the expected duration; and
    (5) the criteria for termination.

(b) AUTOMATIC TERMINATION.—A national emergency shall terminate
    30 days after declaration unless Congress enacts a joint
    resolution approving continuation.

(c) RENEWAL.—Congress may approve continuation of a national
    emergency for periods not exceeding 180 days. Renewal
    requires a recorded vote in each chamber.

(d) ABSOLUTE LIMIT.—No national emergency may continue for more
    than 2 years from initial declaration unless Congress
    enacts specific legislation extending it, which shall
    specify the authorities extended and the additional
    duration.

SEC. 5. CONGRESSIONAL TERMINATION.

(a) Congress may terminate any national emergency by enacting
    a joint resolution of termination.

(b) EXPEDITED PROCEDURES.—
    (1) A joint resolution of termination shall be privileged
        and shall be considered under expedited procedures.
    (2) In the Senate, the resolution shall not be subject
        to a filibuster.
    (3) Each chamber shall vote on the resolution within
        15 days of introduction.

SEC. 6. LIMITATIONS ON EMERGENCY POWERS.

(a) REJECTED POLICIES.—The President may not use emergency
    powers to implement any policy that Congress has
    specifically rejected within the preceding 2 years.

(b) APPROPRIATIONS.—Emergency powers may not be used to
    expend funds not appropriated by Congress, except—
    (1) funds specifically appropriated for emergency use; or
    (2) funds authorized by specific statutory emergency
        authorities.

(c) DOMESTIC MILITARY.—No emergency declaration shall
    authorize—
    (1) deployment of armed forces for domestic law enforcement
        except as specifically authorized by the Insurrection Act;
    (2) suspension of habeas corpus; or
    (3) detention of citizens without charge.

SEC. 7. REPORTING AND TRANSPARENCY.

(a) IMMEDIATE REPORT.—Within 24 hours of declaring an emergency,
    the President shall transmit to Congress a report
    containing all information required by section 4(a).

(b) ONGOING REPORTS.—Every 30 days during an emergency, the
    President shall report to Congress on—
    (1) actions taken under emergency authorities;
    (2) expenditures made;
    (3) continuing necessity of the emergency.

(c) PUBLIC DISCLOSURE.—All emergency declarations and reports
    shall be published in the Federal Register and made
    available on a public website.

SEC. 8. JUDICIAL REVIEW.

(a) Any person affected by an action taken under emergency
    powers may bring an action in federal court challenging
    the action.

(b) Courts shall not defer to executive branch interpretations
    of emergency authority.

(c) Cases under this section shall be expedited.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act takes effect 90 days after enactment.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 3**: Sunsets existing emergencies, forcing review
- **Section 4**: Creates 30-day approval requirement and 2-year hard limit
- **Section 5**: Expedited congressional termination without filibuster
- **Section 6**: Prevents use against congressional will

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Presidential veto | Build veto-proof coalition; frame as bipartisan |
| Circumvention via new declarations | Section 4(d) requires specificity preventing rolling renewals |
| Genuine emergency needs | 30 days provides time for congressional action |
| Constitutionality | Congress has power over emergency statutes it created |

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Separation of Powers**:

Reforms must respect constitutional separation while restoring balance:

| Provision | Constitutional Basis |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Emergency powers limits | Congress created emergency statutes; can modify them |
| War powers enforcement | Article I grants Congress war powers |
| IG protections | Congress can structure executive offices |
| Ethics requirements | Necessary and proper clause; anti-corruption |
| Pardon limits (statutory) | Limited effect; constitutional for amendment |

**Presentment Clause**:

Congressional termination of emergencies must be by joint resolution (subject to veto) under *INS v. Chadha*, unless constitutional amendment changes this.

**Standing**:

Legislation granting congressional standing to enforce laws addresses *Raines v. Byrd* limitations.

### Enforcement Mechanisms

| Provision | Enforcement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Emergency powers | Automatic funding cutoffs; GAO monitoring |
| War powers | Automatic appropriations termination; congressional standing |
| IG protections | Congressional override; judicial review |
| Ethics | OGE enforcement; civil penalties; criminal referral |
| Emoluments | Congressional and private standing |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### National Emergency Reform Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| New emergency declarations | President may declare new emergency for same situation to restart clock | Critical |
| Emergency definition | Act does not define what constitutes "emergency"; broad interpretation possible | High |
| Pocket approval | Congressional inaction could be framed as tacit approval | High |
| Related authorities | Some statutory authorities don't require formal emergency declaration | Medium |
| State of war | War powers may provide alternative authority for some emergency actions | Medium |
| Pre-positioned actions | Actions taken in first 30 days may be difficult to unwind | Low |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Veto override required | Congress needs 2/3 majority to override presidential veto of termination | Constitutional structure |
| Existing emergencies transition | 5-year phase-out may be too generous for clearly obsolete emergencies | Political compromise |
| No private enforcement | Citizens cannot directly challenge emergency abuse | Standing doctrine |
| Genuine emergencies | 30-day approval may be too slow for catastrophic events | Tension between speed and deliberation |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Anti-circumvention clause**: Add provision that declaring new emergency for substantially same situation requires additional justification and 60-day waiting period
2. **Emergency definition**: Add regulatory requirement for OLC to define emergency criteria
3. **Default termination**: Clarify that congressional inaction results in termination, not continuation
4. **Statutory authority audit**: Require GAO to identify all emergency-adjacent authorities for future reform
5. **Expedited genuine emergency**: Create 48-hour notification process for catastrophic events with retroactive approval

### War Powers Enforcement Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Hostilities definition gaming | President may characterize operations to fall outside definition | High |
| Cyber operations ambiguity | "Physical damage" requirement may exclude significant cyber attacks | High |
| Partner force support | "Operational support" may be narrowly interpreted | High |
| Intelligence activities | Covert operations may be characterized as intelligence, not military | Medium |
| NATO/treaty obligations | President may claim treaty obligations override statutory limits | Medium |
| Imminent threat exception | Pre-emptive action claims may circumvent authorization requirement | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| AUMF repeal timeline | 1-year delay allows continued operations under old authorizations | Transition necessity |
| Congressional will to act | Congress may not invoke expedited procedures | Institutional weakness |
| Commander-in-chief claims | Presidents may assert constitutional authority supersedes statute | Constitutional ambiguity |
| Classified operations | Some military activities may remain hidden from oversight | Security concerns |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Hostilities expansion**: Add provision covering "any use of armed force that could reasonably result in casualties"
2. **Cyber operations clarity**: Define threshold by effect (disruption of critical infrastructure) not just physical damage
3. **Support definition**: Require disclosure of all support to foreign military operations
4. **Intelligence carveout limit**: Specify that covert action involving combat requires war powers compliance
5. **Treaty override prohibition**: Clarify that no treaty supersedes congressional war powers

### Inspector General Independence Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Acting IG appointments | President may use acting appointments to install loyalists | High |
| Cause definition breadth | "Inefficiency" or "neglect" could be broadly interpreted | High |
| Budget protection limits | Direct appropriation doesn't prevent executive interference in operations | Medium |
| Information access exceptions | 30-day AG certification could become routine | Medium |
| Council of IG limitations | Council recommendation is advisory only | Low |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| No proactive authority | IGs investigate after problems occur; limited prevention role | Traditional IG function |
| Political appointment | IGs still presidentially appointed; inherent conflict | Constitutional structure |
| Enforcement limitations | IGs have no power to compel corrective action | Advisory role |
| Inter-agency gaps | Some government functions fall between IG jurisdictions | Statutory structure |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Acting IG limits**: Require acting IGs to be career employees with specified tenure protections
2. **Cause definition**: Provide exclusive list of removal grounds; require documented evidence
3. **Budget execution protection**: Prohibit agency interference in IG operational decisions
4. **Certification limits**: Require congressional notification of all AG certifications; limit duration
5. **Council authority**: Give Council binding authority to review removal decisions

### Presidential Ethics Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Trust structure gaming | "Blind" trusts may not be truly blind with sophisticated assets | High |
| Family member reach | Adult children not covered; business interests may flow through them | High |
| Real property exception | Real estate holdings may create significant conflicts | High |
| Emoluments definition | "Market rate" payments may still constitute emoluments | Medium |
| Enforcement discretion | OGE has historically been weak enforcer | Medium |
| Timing of divestiture | 30 days may be insufficient for complex holdings | Low |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Wealth barrier | Divestiture requirements may deter non-wealthy candidates | Equality concerns |
| Tax return privacy | Some argue returns should remain private | Privacy interests |
| Post-presidency limits | 4-year lobbying ban shorter than proposed for other officials | Compromised |
| Retroactivity | Cannot apply to sitting president without transition period | Due process |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Trust verification**: Require independent verification that trust is genuinely blind; annual audits
2. **Family member extension**: Cover adult children involved in family businesses; require disclosure of their holdings
3. **Real property limitation**: Require divestiture of commercial real estate; limit residential exception value
4. **Emoluments clarity**: Define to include any payment exceeding ordinary market rate by 10%
5. **OGE independence**: Convert OGE to independent agency with for-cause removal of director

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| Presidential non-compliance | Build automatic enforcement (funding cutoffs) rather than relying on voluntary compliance |
| Judicial deference | Legislate against deference in national security/emergency contexts |
| Partisan enforcement | Create independent enforcement bodies; automatic triggers |
| Norm erosion | Codify norms as statutes rather than relying on voluntary adherence |
| Constitutional challenges | Draft carefully within existing doctrine; prepare constitutional amendments for court-resistant reforms |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

All executive reform legislation should include:

- **5-year comprehensive review** by GAO of enforcement and effectiveness
- **Annual reporting** on uses of reformed authorities
- **Congressional notification** triggers for significant executive actions
- **Automatic strengthening** if review shows evasion (e.g., lower thresholds, shorter timelines)
- **Court decision adaptation** authority for agencies to adjust implementation
