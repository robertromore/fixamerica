# Executive Reform: History

## The Founding Vision

### Constitutional Design

The framers deliberately created a limited executive after experiencing monarchical abuse:

- **Single executive**: Rejected plural executive for accountability, but limited powers
- **Enumerated powers**: President's constitutional authorities are specific and few
- **Checked by Congress**: Senate confirmation, appropriations, war declaration, impeachment
- **Checked by courts**: Judicial review of executive actions
- **Term limits**: Originally no limit, but Washington's precedent of two terms

### Federalist vs. Anti-Federalist Debate

**Federalists** (Hamilton, Federalist 69-77):

- Executive would be far weaker than British monarch
- No power to declare war, raise armies, or make law
- Subject to impeachment and election
- "Energy in the executive" necessary for good government

**Anti-Federalists**:

- Warned the presidency could become "elective monarchy"
- Feared commander-in-chief power would lead to military adventurism
- Predicted pardon power could be used to protect co-conspirators
- Called for explicit limits and rotation in office

## Early Republic (1789-1860)

### Washington's Precedents

George Washington established norms that constrained successors for generations:

- Voluntary two-term limit
- Cabinet consultation
- Deference to Congress on domestic policy
- Proclamation of Neutrality (1793)—first unilateral foreign policy act

### Jefferson's Expansion

Despite strict constructionist philosophy, Jefferson expanded executive power:

- Louisiana Purchase (1803): No explicit constitutional authority
- Embargo Act enforcement: Extensive executive discretion
- Established precedent of executive action first, constitutional debate later

### Jackson's Assertions

Andrew Jackson transformed the presidency:

- First president to claim popular mandate
- Vetoed bills for policy reasons (not just constitutionality)
- Defied Supreme Court (*Worcester v. Georgia*: "John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it")
- Removed Treasury Secretary to control bank policy

### Pre-Civil War Pattern

Executive power remained relatively constrained:

- Congress dominated domestic policy
- Presidents deferred on war (Mexican-American War excepted)
- Cabinet officers had substantial autonomy
- Federal executive branch remained small

## Civil War and Reconstruction (1861-1877)

### Lincoln's Emergency Powers

Abraham Lincoln exercised unprecedented executive authority:

| Action | Constitutional Basis |
|--------|---------------------|
| Called up militia | Arguably statutory |
| Suspended habeas corpus | Contested; Congress later ratified |
| Blockaded Southern ports | Commander-in-chief |
| Emancipation Proclamation | War power |
| Military tribunals for civilians | Struck down in *Ex parte Milligan* |

### Lasting Impact

Lincoln established that:

- Emergency can justify extraordinary measures
- Congress often ratifies executive action after the fact
- Courts defer during active hostilities
- Presidential power expands but doesn't fully contract

### Post-War Retrenchment

Congress reasserted authority:

- Tenure of Office Act (1867): Limited removal power
- Impeachment of Andrew Johnson
- Congressional Reconstruction over presidential objections
- Return to congressional dominance through Gilded Age

## Progressive Era and World Wars (1901-1945)

### Theodore Roosevelt's "Stewardship"

Roosevelt articulated expansive view of executive power:

> "My belief was that it was not only his right but his duty to do anything that the needs of the Nation demanded unless such action was forbidden by the Constitution or by the laws."

Actions included:

- Trust-busting through executive enforcement
- Conservation by executive reservation
- Panama Canal through covert action
- "Big stick" foreign policy

### Wilson's War Presidency

World War I brought massive expansion:

- Espionage and Sedition Acts (congressional, but executive enforcement)
- War Industries Board and economic control
- Suppression of dissent
- Executive agreements replacing treaties

### FDR's Transformation

Franklin Roosevelt permanently enlarged the presidency:

**Domestic**:

- First 100 days: 15 major laws through executive leadership
- Executive agencies multiplied
- Budget Bureau moved to White House
- "Court-packing" attempt (failed but changed Court behavior)

**Wartime**:

- Lend-Lease through executive agreement
- Japanese internment by executive order
- Manhattan Project kept from Congress
- Wartime economic controls

**Institutional**:

- Executive Office of the President created (1939)
- White House staff expanded
- Presidential leadership of legislation normalized

### 22nd Amendment (1951)

After FDR's four terms, Constitution amended to limit presidents to two terms—the only successful structural reform of the presidency.

## Cold War Presidency (1945-1974)

### National Security State

Truman and successors built permanent security apparatus:

- National Security Act (1947): CIA, NSC, unified military
- Classification system expanded
- Executive agreements replaced treaties
- Covert operations without congressional knowledge

### Korean War Precedent

Truman committed forces to Korea without congressional declaration:

- Called it a "police action"
- Relied on UN Security Council resolution
- Set precedent for undeclared wars
- *Youngstown* (1952) rejected domestic overreach but left war powers intact

### Vietnam and Executive Overreach

The Vietnam War revealed executive power's dangers:

- Gulf of Tonkin Resolution: Broad delegation based on false pretenses
- Secret bombing of Cambodia
- Pentagon Papers: Systematic deception of Congress and public
- Domestic surveillance of war opponents

### Watergate and Reform

Nixon's abuses prompted backlash:

**Abuses**:

- Enemies list and IRS targeting
- Plumbers unit and illegal surveillance
- Saturday Night Massacre
- Obstruction of justice
- Imperial presidency at peak

**Reforms**:

- War Powers Resolution (1973)
- Budget and Impoundment Control Act (1974)
- National Emergencies Act (1976)
- Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (1978)
- Ethics in Government Act (1978)
- Inspector General Act (1978)

## Post-Watergate to 9/11 (1974-2001)

### Initial Constraint

Ford and Carter operated under new restrictions:

- Church Committee investigations
- Intelligence oversight established
- Executive privilege limited after *U.S. v. Nixon*
- Independent counsel provisions created

### Reagan Reassertion

Ronald Reagan pushed back against post-Watergate constraints:

- Signing statements to challenge laws
- Iran-Contra: Covert policy contradicting Congress
- Unitary executive theory developed in DOJ
- Recess appointments to avoid confirmation

### Bush I and Clinton

- Gulf War: Congressional authorization sought (barely)
- Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia: Limited operations without authorization
- Line-item veto (struck down, *Clinton v. City of New York*, 1998)
- Executive privilege battles (Whitewater, Lewinsky)

## War on Terror (2001-Present)

### Post-9/11 Expansion

George W. Bush claimed extraordinary powers:

| Authority Claimed | Basis |
|-------------------|-------|
| Warrantless surveillance | Article II inherent authority |
| Enhanced interrogation | Commander-in-chief; OLC memos |
| Military commissions | 2001 AUMF; later statutory |
| Indefinite detention | 2001 AUMF |
| Targeted killing | Article II; 2001 AUMF |

### Torture Memos and Unitary Executive

OLC memos asserted:

- President's commander-in-chief power cannot be limited by statute
- President can authorize torture despite statutory prohibition
- FISA's warrant requirement can be overridden
- "Unitary executive" theory: President controls all executive functions

### Obama Continuity and Expansion

Despite campaign promises, Obama:

- Continued warrantless surveillance (with modifications)
- Expanded drone strikes dramatically
- Targeted U.S. citizen (Anwar al-Awlaki) without trial
- Asserted broad executive privilege
- Used 2001 AUMF against ISIS (not al-Qaeda)
- DACA: Major immigration policy by executive action

### Trump's Testing of Limits

Donald Trump tested norms and laws:

- Travel ban (multiple versions; third upheld)
- Emergency declaration for border wall funding
- Defiance of congressional subpoenas
- Firing inspectors general
- Pardon power for associates
- Refusal to accept election results
- January 6 and its aftermath

### Biden and Aftermath

Joe Biden has:

- Revoked many Trump executive orders
- Issued major executive actions on climate, student loans
- Faced court challenges to executive overreach
- Continued expansive emergency spending

## Patterns and Trends

### Ratchet Effect

Executive power tends to expand during crises and not fully contract afterward:

- Civil War → permanent standing army
- World Wars → national security state
- Cold War → intelligence agencies, executive agreements
- 9/11 → surveillance state, perpetual war authorization

### Congressional Acquiescence

Congress has repeatedly delegated power and failed to reclaim it:

- Broad authorizations of military force
- Emergency powers without meaningful limits
- Confirmation delays that empower acting officials
- Oversight without enforcement

### Judicial Deference

Courts have generally deferred to executive power, especially in:

- Foreign affairs
- National security
- Immigration
- Military matters

### Norm Erosion

Informal constraints have weakened:

- Tax return disclosure (broken)
- Divestment of business interests (broken)
- Respect for inspector generals (eroded)
- Acceptance of election results (broken)
