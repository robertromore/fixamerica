# Executive Reform: Solutions

## Framework for Reform

Effective executive reform must:

1. **Restore constitutional balance** without preventing legitimate executive action
2. **Create enforceable constraints** that don't depend on executive self-restraint
3. **Build in accountability mechanisms** that work regardless of partisan control
4. **Anticipate evasion** and close loopholes before they're exploited
5. **Survive judicial review** under current constitutional doctrine

## Emergency Powers Reform

### Problem

Presidents can declare emergencies indefinitely, activating vast statutory powers with minimal oversight.

### Solutions

**Automatic Termination**

- All emergency declarations expire after 30 days without congressional approval
- Congressional approval required by joint resolution (not concurrent resolution)
- Renewal required every 6 months with recorded votes
- Total duration capped at 2 years without new legislation

**Scope Limitations**

- Emergencies limited to specific statutory powers relevant to declared threat
- Prohibition on using emergency powers for purposes Congress has rejected
- Requirement that emergency measures be "necessary and proportionate"

**Transparency Requirements**

- Immediate public disclosure of all powers activated
- Weekly reporting on emergency measures taken
- GAO real-time monitoring of emergency spending
- Mandatory IG review of emergency actions

**Congressional Reclaim**

- Expedited procedures for congressional review
- Guaranteed floor votes on termination resolutions

**Norm Restoration**
