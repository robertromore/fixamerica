# War Powers Reform: Roadmap

## Implementation Strategy

### Theory of Change

**Core Premise**

War powers reform requires sustained pressure combining public engagement, congressional champions, crisis opportunities, and institutional reform. Success depends on building a bipartisan coalition united around constitutional principles rather than partisan advantage.

**Key Drivers**

| Driver | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Public fatigue | War weariness creates reform appetite |
| Constitutional concern | Cross-partisan appeal |
| Fiscal pressure | War costs drive reform interest |
| Executive overreach | Galvanizes congressional action |
| Electoral accountability | Voters punish endless wars |

### Sequencing Logic

**Phase 1: Foundation Building (Years 1-2)**

- Build coalition across ideological lines
- Develop legislative proposals
- Create public awareness
- Identify congressional champions

**Phase 2: Legislative Push (Years 2-4)**

- Introduce comprehensive reform legislation
- Pass achievable incremental reforms
- Build momentum through hearings
- Develop floor vote strategy

**Phase 3: Implementation (Years 4-6)**

- Enact major reforms during window of opportunity
- Establish enforcement precedents
- Institutionalize oversight capacity
- Defend against rollback
