# War Powers Reform: Solutions

## Guiding Principles

### Core Values

**Democratic Accountability**

- No military action without democratic authorization
- Representatives must vote before troops deployed
- Public must have voice in war decisions
- Costs and benefits debated openly

**Constitutional Fidelity**

- Restore original intent of war powers allocation
- Congress declares/authorizes, President conducts
- Checks and balances on most consequential decisions
- No branch can abdicate constitutional responsibility

**Operational Effectiveness**

- Preserve genuine emergency response capability
- Enable effective military operations when authorized
- Maintain necessary secrecy for operations
- Allow military to function within authorized scope

### Criteria for Evaluating Solutions

| Criterion | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| Constitutional | Does it restore proper balance? |
| Effective | Will it actually constrain unauthorized action? |
| Enforceable | Can it be implemented? |
| Bipartisan | Can it attract cross-party support? |
| Practical | Does it allow necessary operations? |
