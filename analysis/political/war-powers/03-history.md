# War Powers Reform: History

## Constitutional Origins (1787-1789)

### The Founders' Intent

**Constitutional Convention Debates**

| Date | Issue | Resolution |
|------|-------|------------|
| August 17, 1787 | War power placement | Congress, not President |
| Original draft | "Make war" | Changed to "declare war" |
| Rationale | Allow President to "repel sudden attacks" | Limited defensive authority |

**Key Framers' Views**

| Framer | Position |
|--------|----------|
| James Madison | "The power to declare war, including the power of judging the causes of war, is fully and exclusively vested in the legislature" |
| Alexander Hamilton | "It belongs to Congress only, to go to War" |
| Thomas Jefferson | "We have already given in example one effectual check to the Dog of war by transferring the power of letting him loose" |
| George Mason | Opposed giving President war powers; preferred "not so easy for [the executive] to commit a nation to war" |

**Constitutional Design**

| Power | Branch | Rationale |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Declare war | Congress | Democratic deliberation |
| Appropriate funds | Congress | Control duration |
| Raise armies | Congress | Prevent standing armies |
| Commander-in-Chief | President | Unified command in war |
| Repel attacks | President | Emergency response |

### Early Practice (1789-1846)

**Early Conflicts**

| Conflict | Year | Authorization |
|----------|------|---------------|
| Quasi-War with France | 1798-1800 | Congressional authorization |
| Barbary Wars | 1801-1805 | Congressional authorization |
| War of 1812 | 1812-1815 | Formal declaration |
| Seminole Wars | 1816-1858 | Various authorizations |

**Jefferson's Approach**

| Action | 1801 |
|--------|------|
| Barbary pirates attack | Defensive action only |
| Offensive operations | Sought congressional authorization |
| Stated principle | President cannot initiate offensive action |

## Expansion Era (1846-1898)

### Mexican-American War (1846)

**Presidential Initiative**

| Event | Date | Action |
|-------|------|--------|
| Troops to disputed territory | January 1846 | Polk orders |
| Mexican attack | April 1846 | "American blood on American soil" |
| Congressional declaration | May 1846 | Passed after hostilities |

**Congressional Response**

| Position | Argument |
|----------|----------|
| Support (majority) | Must support troops in field |
| Opposition (Whigs) | President provoked war unconstitutionally |
| Lincoln (congressman) | "Spot Resolutions" challenging Polk's claims |

**Precedent Set**
