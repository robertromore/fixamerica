# War Powers Reform: Overview

The power to commit the nation to war is the most consequential decision a government can make. The Constitution divides this authority between Congress (which has the sole power to declare war) and the President (who serves as Commander-in-Chief). Over seven decades, this balance has shifted dramatically toward executive dominance. Presidents now routinely initiate military action without congressional authorization, deploy forces for years under outdated authorizations, and conduct covert operations with minimal oversight. This erosion of democratic accountability over war represents one of the most significant constitutional failures in American governance.
