# Political Reform: Solutions

## Guiding Principles

### What Makes a Good Reform

**1. Addresses Root Causes**

- Targets structural problems, not just symptoms
- Changes incentives, not just rules
- Reduces capture, not just corruption

**2. Is Achievable**

- Has a viable path to implementation
- Can be won through ballot initiative or legislative action
- Doesn't require constitutional amendment (preferable but not required)

**3. Is Durable**

- Resistant to future erosion or capture
- Creates self-reinforcing incentives
- Builds constituencies that will defend it

**4. Is Cross-Partisan**

- Appeals to voters across political spectrum
- Framed as fair process, not partisan outcome
- Has potential for bipartisan coalition

**5. Is Evidence-Based**

- Tested somewhere (states, cities, other countries)
- Research supports its effectiveness
- Can be evaluated and adjusted

### Criteria for Prioritization

| Criterion | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| Impact | Does this address a major root cause? |
| Feasibility | Is there a realistic path to implementation? |
| Durability | Will this change stick? |
| Spillover | Does this enable other reforms? |
| Coalition | Can this unite diverse supporters? |

## Policy Proposals

### Tier 1: Highest Impact, Most Achievable

#### 1. Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV)

**What It Is**
Voters rank candidates in order of preference. If no candidate gets a majority, the last-place candidate is eliminated and their votes transfer to voters' next choices. This continues until someone has a majority.

**Why It Works**

- Eliminates spoiler effect
- Allows voters to express true preferences
- Reduces negative campaigning (candidates seek to be second choice)
- Enables third parties without wasting votes
- Produces majority winners

**Evidence**

- Used in Maine (statewide), Alaska, NYC, and 50+ cities
- Voter satisfaction high
- Reduced negative advertising observed
- Courts have upheld constitutionality

**Implementation Path**

- Ballot initiative in states that allow it
- Legislative action where coalitions exist
- Start local, build to statewide

#### 2. Independent Redistricting Commissions

**What It Is**
Remove redistricting from partisan control. Independent citizens commissions draw district lines based on neutral criteria (compactness, communities of interest) rather than partisan advantage.

**Why It Works**

- Eliminates gerrymandering
- Creates competitive districts
- Reduces extremism (representatives must appeal to broader electorate)
- Increases accountability

**Evidence**

- California: Competitive races increased dramatically
- Arizona: Upheld by Supreme Court
- Michigan: Passed by ballot initiative 2018
- 10+ states now use some form of independent commission

**Implementation Path**

- Ballot initiatives (most successful approach)
- Legislative action in some states
- Federal legislation (harder due to federalism)

#### 3. Open/Nonpartisan Primaries

**What It Is**
All candidates appear on a single primary ballot. All voters can participate. Top candidates (usually top 2 or top 4) advance to general election.

**Variations**

- Top-two primary (California, Washington)
- Top-four primary with RCV (Alaska)
- Jungle primary (Louisiana)

**Why It Works**

- Includes independent voters (40%+ of electorate)
- Reduces primary extremism
- Candidates must appeal beyond party base
- Increases competition

**Evidence**

- Alaska's 2022 election produced more moderate winners
- California has reduced partisan gridlock somewhat
- Research shows more moderate voting behavior

**Implementation Path**

- Ballot initiatives (successful in multiple states)
- Combined with RCV for best results (Alaska model)

### Tier 2: High Impact, Moderate Difficulty

#### 4. Campaign Finance Reform

**Small-Dollar Matching**

- Government matches small donations (e.g., 6:1 for donations under $200)
- Amplifies voice of ordinary citizens
- Reduces dependence on large donors
- Candidates can run without wealthy connections

**Evidence**

- NYC has used small-dollar matching since 1988
- Candidates receive more small donations
- More diverse candidate pool

**Disclosure Requirements**

- Require disclosure of all political spending
- Real-time reporting
- Beneficial ownership disclosure for dark money groups
- Close 501(c)(4) loophole

**Public Financing**

- "Democracy vouchers" (Seattle model): Every voter gets vouchers to donate
- Clean Elections (Arizona, Maine): Qualifying candidates receive public funds
- Reduces donor dependency

#### 5. Congressional Reform

**Filibuster Reform**

- Return to talking filibuster
- Carve-outs for democracy-related bills
- Lower threshold for certain categories
- Or eliminate entirely

**Committee Reform**

- Reduce power of chairs to block legislation
- Require votes on bills with sufficient support
- Increase minority party rights

**Ethics Reform**

- Strengthen ethics enforcement
- Ban stock trading by members and staff
- Increase lobbying restrictions
- Close revolving door

### Tier 3: High Impact, Higher Difficulty

#### 6. Constitutional Amendments

**Overturn Citizens United**

- Amendment to establish that money is not speech
- Allow reasonable campaign finance regulation
- Restore congressional authority

**Electoral College Reform**

- National Popular Vote Interstate Compact (workaround)
- Or constitutional amendment for direct election
- Eliminates swing-state distortion

**Term Limits**

- Limit length of service in Congress
- Reduces careerism and seniority power
- Brings in fresh perspectives

**Difficulty**: Constitutional amendments require 2/3 of Congress and 3/4 of states. Extremely difficult but may become possible in crisis.

## Structural Reforms

### Electoral System Redesign

**Multi-Member Districts with Proportional Representation**

- Instead of single-member districts, elect 3-5 representatives per larger district
- Seats allocated proportionally
- Eliminates gerrymandering (larger districts can't be carved)
- Enables representation for minority viewpoints

**Example**: Fair Representation Act (proposed federal legislation)

- 3-5 member districts
- RCV for elections
- Would end gerrymandering nationally

**Approval Voting**

- Vote for as many candidates as you approve of
- Highest vote-getter wins
- Simpler than RCV
- Eliminates spoiler effect

**STAR Voting**

- Score Then Automatic Runoff
- Rate candidates 0-5
- Top two go to automatic runoff
- More expressive than RCV

### Institutional Redesign

**Expanding the House**

- House size frozen at 435 since 1929
- Population has tripled
- Larger House = smaller districts = more responsive representation
- Reduce average district from 760,000 to 200,000 or less

**Senate Reform**

- Much harder due to constitutional protection
- DC and Puerto Rico statehood would add senators
- Eliminate or reform filibuster more achievable

**Supreme Court Reform**

- Term limits for justices
- Expansion of court
- Code of ethics with enforcement
- Addresses capture of court

### Systemic Changes

**Universal Voter Registration**

- Automatic registration at 18
- Portable registration across states
- Same-day registration
- Eliminates registration barriers

**Making Voting Easier**

- Vote by mail (Oregon model)
- Early voting
- Election Day as holiday
- Restore Voting Rights Act protections

**Reducing Money's Influence**

- Public financing to fund campaigns
- Small-dollar matching
- Strict lobbying restrictions
- Longer cooling-off periods

## Alternative Approaches

### Incremental vs. Comprehensive

**Incremental Approach**

- Win one reform at a time
- Build momentum from successes
- Less threatening to opponents
- But reforms may be reversed or worked around

**Comprehensive Approach**

- Package of mutually reinforcing reforms
- Address root causes together
- Harder to pass but more durable
- Creates larger coalition

**Recommended**: Incremental implementation with comprehensive vision. Win achievable reforms while advocating for larger package.

### State-First vs. Federal-First

**State-First Approach**

- 50 laboratories of democracy
- Bypass federal gridlock
- Create demonstration effects
- But uneven progress; some states resistant

**Federal-First Approach**

- Uniform national standards
- Addresses problem everywhere
- But requires overcoming filibuster
- Currently blocked

**Recommended**: State-first for near term; federal backup when coalitions exist.

### Inside vs. Outside Strategies

**Inside Strategy**

- Work with current politicians
- Find reformers within parties
- Use existing institutions
- But reformers rare and constrained

**Outside Strategy**

- Ballot initiatives
- Public pressure campaigns
- Third-party and independent candidates
- But requires massive mobilization

**Recommended**: Both. Use outside pressure to create conditions for inside action.

## What Has Worked Elsewhere

### Other Democracies

| Country | System | Result |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Germany | Mixed-member proportional | Multiple parties, coalition governance |
| Australia | RCV (instant-runoff) | Major parties + viable third parties |
| New Zealand | Mixed-member proportional | Transformed from two-party to multi-party |
| Ireland | Single transferable vote | Proportional representation, constituency service |
| Sweden | Party-list proportional | High turnout, multiple parties, low corruption |

**Lessons**

- Proportional systems produce more parties
- More parties = more coalition-building = less gridlock
- Public financing reduces corruption
- Compulsory voting increases turnout

### U.S. States

| State | Reform | Result |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Alaska | Top-four primary + RCV | Moderate candidates winning |
| Maine | Statewide RCV | Third parties competitive |
| California | Independent redistricting | More competitive districts |
| California | Top-two primary | Reduced partisan extremism |
| Arizona | Clean Elections | More candidates from diverse backgrounds |
| Oregon | Vote by mail | Higher turnout, no fraud |
| Michigan | Independent redistricting | Passed by large margin |

**Lessons**

- Ballot initiatives work where legislatures won't act
- Reforms can pass in red, blue, and purple states
- Implementation challenges exist but are solvable
- Public supports reform when asked directly

### Historical US

| Era | Reform | Impact |
|-----|--------|--------|
| Progressive Era | Direct election of senators | Reduced corruption |
| Progressive Era | Primary elections | Gave voters voice in nominations |
| 1960s | Voting Rights Act | Expanded democracy dramatically |
| 1970s | Post-Watergate reforms | Briefly reduced money in politics |

**Lessons**

- Major reform follows crisis
- Reforms can be reversed (need durability)
- Sustained organizing makes change possible

## Trade-offs

### Representation vs. Governability

**More Representative Systems**

- Pro: Better reflect voter preferences
- Con: May produce fractured legislatures, harder to form governments

**Mitigation**: Design systems with thresholds to prevent extreme fragmentation

### Competition vs. Stability

**More Competitive Elections**

- Pro: More accountability
- Con: Less legislative experience, more uncertainty

**Mitigation**: Reforms that increase competition while maintaining institutional knowledge

### National Standards vs. Local Control

**National Reforms**

- Pro: Uniform, comprehensive
- Con: Reduces state experimentation, federalism concerns

**Mitigation**: Set floors not ceilings; allow states to exceed minimum standards

### Speed vs. Coalition

**Aggressive Reform**

- Pro: Addresses crisis urgently
- Con: May alienate potential allies

**Mitigation**: Maintain comprehensive vision while winning achievable battles

### Complexity vs. Simplicity

**Sophisticated Reforms (e.g., STAR voting)**

- Pro: Better theoretical properties
- Con: Harder to explain, implement, defend

**Mitigation**: Start with simpler reforms (RCV) that people understand

### Perfect vs. Achievable

**Ideal Reforms (e.g., constitutional amendments)**

- Pro: Fully address problems
- Con: May never happen

**Mitigation**: Pursue achievable reforms now while building toward ideal

## Priority Recommendations

### Immediate Priorities (most states can start now)

1. **Ranked-choice voting** - Ballot initiatives where possible
2. **Independent redistricting** - Before next redistricting cycle
3. **Open primaries** - Combined with RCV for best results

### Medium-Term Priorities (build momentum)

1. **Small-dollar matching** - State and local first
2. **Disclosure requirements** - State legislation
3. **Filibuster reform** - When Senate conditions allow

### Long-Term Priorities (requires sustained effort)

1. **Multi-member districts** - Federal legislation
2. **Constitutional amendments** - Campaign finance, electoral college
3. **Court reform** - When political conditions allow
