# Election Security: Overview

American election infrastructure faces unprecedented threats from foreign adversaries, domestic bad actors, and technological vulnerabilities.

While significant improvements have been made since then, election security remains a patchwork of federal guidelines, state implementation, and local administration with inadequate funding, inconsistent standards, and emerging threats outpacing defenses.
