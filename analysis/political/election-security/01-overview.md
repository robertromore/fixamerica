# Election Security: Overview

## Executive Summary

American election infrastructure faces unprecedented threats from foreign adversaries, domestic bad actors, and technological vulnerabilities. The 2016 Russian interference operation exposed critical weaknesses in voting systems, voter databases, and information ecosystems. While significant improvements have been made since then, election security remains a patchwork of federal guidelines, state implementation, and local administration with inadequate funding, inconsistent standards, and emerging threats outpacing defenses.

Election security is foundational to democratic legitimacy. If citizens cannot trust that their votes are accurately counted and that elections are free from manipulation, the entire premise of representative government collapses. This makes election security not merely a technical challenge but a matter of national security and democratic survival.

## Scope

- **Election official training**: Security protocols, threat awareness, incident response
- **Voter database protection**: Registration system security, data integrity
- **Misinformation**: Election-related disinformation campaigns, social media manipulation
- **Chain of custody**: Ballot handling, storage, transport security
- **Post-election audits**: Risk-limiting audits, verification procedures
- **Federal role**: CISA's mission, EAC standards, federal funding

### Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **CISA** | Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, lead federal election security agency |
| **EAC** | Election Assistance Commission, develops voting system standards and provides resources |
| **Risk-limiting audit (RLA)** | Statistical audit method that provides strong confidence in election outcomes |
| **Voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT)** | Paper record allowing voters to confirm electronic vote was recorded correctly |
| **Air-gapped** | System physically isolated from internet or other networks |
| **Ballot marking device (BMD)** | Electronic device that marks paper ballot based on voter selections |
| **Direct-recording electronic (DRE)** | Voting machine that records votes electronically without paper record |
| **Chain of custody** | Documented trail of who handled ballots and when |
| **Malware** | Malicious software designed to damage or gain unauthorized access |

## Key Questions

1. **How vulnerable are American voting systems?** What specific threats do voting machines, databases, and infrastructure face?

2. **What role did foreign interference play in recent elections?** What did Russia and other actors do, and what are they capable of doing?

3. **Why do some jurisdictions still use paperless voting machines?** What barriers prevent universal paper ballot adoption?

4. **How effective is current election security funding?** Is the money sufficient, and is it being spent wisely?

5. **What is CISA and what authority does it have?** How does the federal government coordinate election security without controlling elections?

6. **How can post-election audits detect and deter fraud?** What makes risk-limiting audits effective?

7. **How does election misinformation undermine security?** What's the relationship between information integrity and election security?

## Why This Matters

Election security failures undermine democracy in multiple ways:

| Security Failure | Democratic Harm |
|------------------|-----------------|
| Voting machine manipulation | Votes not counted as cast |
| Voter database breaches | Voter suppression, identity theft |
| Foreign interference | Loss of sovereignty, foreign influence |
| Misinformation campaigns | Uninformed voting, decreased turnout |
| Chain of custody failures | Inability to verify results |
| Inadequate audits | Undetected errors or manipulation |
| Loss of public confidence | Delegitimized elections, civil unrest |

**Trust is the foundation.** Even if an election is conducted perfectly, if voters don't trust the results, democracy is damaged. Security must be both real and visible.

## The Opportunity

Election security improvements are achievable:

- **Paper ballots work**: Proven technology that enables verification and auditing
- **Risk-limiting audits are effective**: Statistical methods that provide high confidence efficiently
- **Federal resources exist**: CISA provides free services to state and local election officials
- **Bipartisan support is possible**: Election security is less partisan than many election issues
- **Standards can be strengthened**: EAC certification can be made more rigorous
- **Training improves outcomes**: Election officials can be prepared for threats

## The Challenge

Significant barriers remain:

- **Decentralized system**: 10,000+ election jurisdictions with varying resources
- **Funding gaps**: Many localities cannot afford security upgrades
- **Legacy equipment**: Old voting machines difficult to secure
- **Evolving threats**: Adversaries adapt faster than defenses
- **Political weaponization**: Security concerns used to suppress votes or contest legitimate results
- **Misinformation ecosystem**: False claims spread faster than corrections
