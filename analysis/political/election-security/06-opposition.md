| Argument | Counter |

| Cost too high | Cost of failure far higher |
| Local responsibility | Unfunded mandates unfair |

| Other priorities | Democracy is foundational priority |

**Resistance to Change**

| Concern | Validity |
|---------|----------|
| Implementation burden | Real but manageable |
| Training requirements | Necessary investment |
| Current system works | Until it doesn't |
| Autonomy preservation | Some federal coordination needed |

## Opposition Arguments and Rebuttals

### "Elections Are Already Secure"

**Argument**

| Claim | Source |
|-------|--------|
| No evidence of manipulation | Post-2020 audits |
| Current systems adequate | Officials' assessments |
| Don't fix what isn't broken | Status quo bias |

**Rebuttal**

| Point | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Absence of evidence isn't evidence of absence | Many attacks go undetected |
| Past security doesn't guarantee future | Threats evolve |
| Vulnerabilities documented | Security researchers |
| Prevention beats detection | Invest before breach |

### "Paper Ballots Are Antiquated"

**Argument**

| Claim | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|
| Technology has advanced | Digital should be better |
| Paper is slow | Electronic faster |
| Paper can be manipulated | Ballot stuffing concerns |
| Accessibility issues | Some voters need electronic |

**Rebuttal**

| Point | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Paper is auditable | Electronic-only isn't |
| Security experts unanimous | Paper backup essential |
| BMDs accommodate accessibility | Both possible |
| Speed less important than accuracy | Count right, not fast |
| Paper manipulation detectable | Chain of custody works |

### "Federal Standards Threaten State Authority"

**Argument**

| Claim | Basis |
|-------|-------|
| Elections are state function | Constitution |
| Federal overreach | Federalism concerns |
| One-size-fits-all won't work | State variation |
| States know best | Local expertise |

**Rebuttal**

| Point | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Elections Clause allows federal role | Constitutional authority |
| National security requires coordination | Foreign threats don't respect state lines |
| Standards can be flexible | Minimum floor, not rigid rules |
| Federal funding comes with expectations | Not purely state responsibility |
| Interstate coordination needed | Voters move, adversaries don't care about borders |

### "Audits Undermine Confidence"

**Argument**

| Claim | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|
| Finding errors looks bad | Media coverage of discrepancies |
| Endless recounts | Finality needed |
| Audit costs too high | Budget constraints |
| Opens door to challenges | Litigious actors exploit |

**Rebuttal**

| Point | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Audits build confidence | Show system works |
| Minor errors are normal | Finding them proves oversight |
| RLAs are efficient | Statistical sampling cost-effective |
| Certainty beats suspicion | Unaudited systems invite conspiracy |
| Best practices support audits | International standard |

### "Security Measures Suppress Votes"

**Argument**

| Claim | Context |
|-------|---------|
| Voter ID creates barriers | Some groups lack ID |
| Purges remove eligible voters | Aggressive list maintenance |
| Security theater | Hassle without benefit |
| Discriminatory enforcement | Unequal application |

**Rebuttal (and Caution)**

| Point | Consideration |
|-------|---------------|
| Legitimate security differs from suppression | Intent matters |
| Security shouldn't reduce access | Both are important |
| Free ID + paper + audits = security without suppression | Right combination |
| Monitor for discriminatory effects | Ongoing evaluation needed |
| Balance is possible | Security and access not opposed |

### "Transparency Threatens Security"

**Argument**

| Claim | Rationale |
|-------|-----------|
| Revealing vulnerabilities helps attackers | Security through obscurity |
| Proprietary systems protected | Trade secrets |
| Public testing dangerous | Provides roadmap for adversaries |
| Official channels sufficient | Trust the experts |

**Rebuttal**

| Point | Evidence |
|-------|----------|
| Security through obscurity doesn't work | Attackers find flaws anyway |
| Open source more secure | More eyes find problems |
| Responsible disclosure standard | Security community practices |
| Public trust requires transparency | Can't verify secret systems |
| Vendors have conflict of interest | Independent review essential |
