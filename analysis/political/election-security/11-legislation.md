## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Elections Clause (Article I, Section 4)**

Congress has authority to regulate the "time, place, and manner" of federal elections, supporting federal security requirements.

| Provision | Constitutional Basis |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Paper ballot requirement | Manner of elections |
| Audit requirements | Manner of elections |
| Security standards | Manner of elections |
| Funding | Spending power |

**Federalism Considerations**

| Concern | Response |
|---------|----------|
| State sovereignty | Federal role limited to federal elections |
| Unfunded mandates | Substantial federal funding provided |
| Implementation flexibility | States choose how to comply |
| Voluntary for state/local | Federal mandates apply to federal races |

### Preemption Questions

| State Law | Federal Impact |
|-----------|----------------|
| Less stringent standards | Federal minimum applies to federal elections |
| More stringent standards | States may exceed federal minimums |
| Conflicting procedures | Federal standards control for federal elections |
| State-only elections | Federal law does not apply |

### Enforcement Mechanisms

| Provision | Enforcement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Paper ballot requirement | DOJ enforcement; private right of action |
| Audit requirements | EAC certification; funding conditions |
| Cybersecurity standards | CISA oversight; grant conditions |
| Official protection | DOJ prosecution; civil suits |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### SECURE Elections Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| BMD expansion abuse | States may make BMD default rather than exception, reducing hand-marked ballot benefits | High |
| Audit timing manipulation | States may adjust certification deadlines in ways that compress audit quality | Medium |
| Open source delay | 5-year transition allows continued proprietary system vulnerabilities | Medium |
| Matching requirement waiver | Financial hardship claims may be abused to avoid state investment | Medium |
| Incident reporting gaps | 72-hour window may allow some incidents to go unreported | Low |
| Foreign interference definition | May not capture all forms of interference | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| State implementation discretion | Inconsistent application across states | Federalism constraints |
| Funding adequacy | $500M annually may be insufficient | Political constraints on appropriations |
| No local election coverage | Municipal elections not addressed | Federal authority limits |
| Vendor concentration | Market structure unchanged | Outside legislative scope |
| Misinformation not addressed | Information integrity separate issue | Scope limitation |
| Partisan enforcement | DOJ priorities may shift with administrations | Political nature of enforcement |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **BMD limitation**: Add provision requiring 90%+ hand-marked ballots; BMD use only with documented accessibility need
2. **Audit timing**: Establish minimum time requirements for audit completion, not just deadlines
3. **Open source acceleration**: Reduce timeline to 3 years; provide additional funding for transition
4. **Matching requirement**: Require objective criteria for hardship waiver; cap waiver duration
5. **Incident reporting**: Require immediate reporting of critical incidents; 72 hours for others
6. **Interference definition**: Expand to include AI-generated content, domestic coordination with foreign actors

### Election Security Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Voluntary services | States can decline CISA assistance | High |
| Incident reporting enforcement | No penalties for non-reporting | High |
| Vendor cooperation voluntary | No mandate for vulnerability disclosure | Medium |
| Grant use discretion | Funds may be diverted to non-security purposes | Medium |
| Definition of "significant" incident | Subjective determination | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| No paper ballot mandate | Paperless systems may continue | Political compromise |
| No audit requirement | Verification not ensured | Narrower scope |
| Limited funding | $400M insufficient | Budget constraints |
| No official protection | Harassment continues | Separate legislation |
| Voluntary compliance | Gaps in implementation | Federalism concerns |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Mandatory participation**: Require security assessments as condition of federal election funding
2. **Reporting enforcement**: Add penalties for failure to report; provide safe harbor for good faith reporting
3. **Vendor requirements**: Make vendor cooperation condition of EAC certification
4. **Grant restrictions**: Require minimum percentage for direct security improvements
5. **Incident definition**: Provide detailed criteria in regulation; err on side of reporting

### Election Official Protection Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Intent requirement | Proving intent to threaten difficult | High |
| Jurisdictional gaps | Some threats may not meet federal standards | Medium |
| Anonymous threats | Attribution challenges | Medium |
| Social media platform liability | Platforms not held accountable | Medium |
| "Course of conduct" vagueness | Harassment standard may be unclear | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Reactive nature | Protection after threat, not prevention | Structural |
| Enforcement capacity | DOJ resources limited | Budget constraints |
| State court variability | Civil remedies depend on local courts | Federalism |
| Doesn't address root causes | Election denial movement continues | Outside scope |
| Family protection limited | Threats to family may not be covered | Drafting limitation |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Intent standard**: Add "reckless disregard" as alternative to specific intent
2. **Federal jurisdiction**: Expand to include any threat related to federal election duties
3. **Anonymous threats**: Add provisions for platform cooperation in identification
4. **Platform accountability**: Require platforms to remove threats; create civil liability
5. **Harassment clarity**: Provide examples and objective criteria in statutory text
6. **Family inclusion**: Explicitly include immediate family members in all protections

### Model State Legislation

#### Paper Ballot Act Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| BMD as default workaround | No limit on BMD deployment | High |
| "Suitable for manual auditing" vague | May allow inadequate paper records | Medium |
| No audit requirement | Paper exists but may not be checked | High |
| Voter verification optional | Voters may not review before casting | Medium |

#### Paper Ballot Act Rectification

1. Add explicit ratio requirement (e.g., BMD available but hand-marked default)
2. Define "suitable for manual auditing" with specific criteria
3. Pair with mandatory audit legislation
4. Require affirmative voter confirmation step

#### Risk-Limiting Audit Act Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Ballot manifest manipulation | Inaccurate manifests compromise audit | High |
| Random seed predictability | Seeds could be influenced | Medium |
| Sample expansion resistance | Pressure to not expand when warranted | Medium |
| Timing pressure | Audits rushed before certification | Medium |

#### Risk-Limiting Audit Act Rectification

1. Require independent ballot manifest verification
2. Use publicly verifiable randomness (e.g., lottery drawing, NIST beacon)
3. Make expansion criteria objective and mandatory
4. Provide adequate time between election and certification

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| Underfunding | Mandatory appropriations; dedicated fund |
| Partisan weaponization | Bipartisan oversight; professional standards |
| Enforcement variability | Clear criteria; regular reporting |
| Vendor influence | Open source requirements; competitive procurement |
| Jurisdictional complexity | Federal coordination; technical assistance |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

All provisions should include:

- **Biennial security assessment** evaluating implementation across jurisdictions
- **Threat landscape review** identifying emerging vulnerabilities
- **Funding adequacy analysis** comparing resources to needs
- **Best practices updates** incorporating lessons learned
- **Automatic strengthening triggers** when metrics show declining security

#### Amendment Procedures

For federal legislation:

1. CISA or EAC identifies implementation issue
2. Congressional committee holds oversight hearing
3. Technical corrections or reauthorization bill introduced
4. Standard legislative process with bipartisan support sought

For state legislation:

1. State election officials identify issues
2. Post-election report documents problems
3. Amendment bill introduced next session
4. Consider sunset review requirements
