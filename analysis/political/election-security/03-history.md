# Election Security: History

## Origins

### Pre-Digital Era Security

**Paper Ballot Era (1800s-1960s)**

| Era | Security Concerns | Methods |
|-----|-------------------|---------|
| Early Republic | Vote buying, intimidation | Public voting |
| Gilded Age | Stuffed ballot boxes | Paper ballots in boxes |
| Progressive Era | Machine manipulation | Ballot design reforms |
| Mid-20th century | Chain of custody | Locked boxes, observers |

**Traditional Vulnerabilities**

| Vulnerability | Historical Occurrence |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Ballot box stuffing | Common in machine politics |
| Vote buying | Widespread into 20th century |
| Intimidation | Suppression of minority voters |
| Miscounting | Intentional and unintentional |
| Dead voters | Registry manipulation |

### Mechanical Voting Machines

**Lever Machine Era (1892-2000s)**

| Aspect | Characteristic |
|--------|---------------|
| Introduction | First used in Lockport, NY (1892) |
| Peak usage | ~50% of voters by 1960s |
| Security model | Physical locks, mechanical counters |
| Vulnerabilities | No paper trail, internal manipulation |
| Phase-out | Most retired after HAVA (2002) |

## Evolution of Security Thinking

### From Fraud Prevention to Cyber Defense

**Traditional Security Model**

| Focus | Methods |
|-------|---------|
| Physical security | Locked ballot boxes |
| Chain of custody | Documented handling |
| Observer access | Bipartisan monitoring |
| Recounts | Hand verification |

**Modern Security Model**

| Focus | Methods |
|-------|---------|
| Cyber defense | Network security, monitoring |
| System integrity | Software verification |
| Resilience | Paper backup, audits |
| Threat intelligence | Information sharing |
| Incident response | Coordinated reaction |

### The Paper Ballot Renaissance

**Why Paper Returned**

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Audit capability | Electronic-only systems unverifiable |
| Security research | Demonstrated voting machine vulnerabilities |
| Expert consensus | Unanimous security community recommendation |
| Cost considerations | Paper often cheaper than DRE maintenance |
| Public demand | Voters want tangible record |

**Paper Ballot Adoption**

| Year | Voters with Paper Record |
|------|-------------------------|
| 2016 | ~80% |
| 2020 | ~95% |
| 2024 | ~97% |

## Lessons from the Past

### What Has Worked

| Reform | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| Paper ballot expansion | Dramatically improved auditability |
| CISA services | Professional security support available |
| Critical infrastructure designation | Federal resources mobilized |
| Information sharing | Faster threat response |
| Risk-limiting audits | Statistical verification methods |

### What Has Failed

| Approach | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| Voluntary standards | Inconsistent implementation |
| One-time funding | No sustainable security investment |
| Vendor self-certification | Inadequate testing |
| Reactive posture | Always behind threats |
| Partisan approach | Security becomes political weapon |

### Recurring Patterns

| Pattern | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| Crisis drives reform | 2000 Florida, 2016 Russia |
| Funding lags need | Chronic underinvestment |
| Decentralization challenges | 10,000 jurisdictions |
| Technology outpaces policy | New threats, old rules |
| Short attention span | Interest fades between crises |
