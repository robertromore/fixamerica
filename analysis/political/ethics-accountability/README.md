# Ethics and Accountability: Overview

Effective democracy requires public officials to act in the public interest rather than for personal gain. Government ethics rules—covering conflicts of interest, financial disclosure, gifts, and post-government employment—exist to ensure this. But the American ethics enforcement system has significant gaps: weak enforcement mechanisms, limited coverage of top officials, inadequate penalties, and structural conflicts that allow violators to escape accountability.
