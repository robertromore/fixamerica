# Ethics and Accountability: History

## Constitutional Foundations

### Framers' Concerns

The Founders were acutely aware of corruption risks:

**Emoluments Clauses**: Designed to prevent foreign influence and self-dealing

- Disclosure → loopholes created

### Structural Resistance

Presidents of both parties resist ethics constraints:
