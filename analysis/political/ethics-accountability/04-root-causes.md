# Ethics and Accountability: Root Causes

## Structural Factors

### Separation of Powers Tensions

Ethics enforcement creates constitutional friction:

**Executive Self-Regulation**: The executive branch investigates and prosecutes itself.

**DOJ Conflict**: Department of Justice decides whether to prosecute executive officials—including those who appointed its leadership.

**Congressional Limitations**: Congress has oversight but limited direct enforcement authority over executive branch.

**Judicial Reluctance**: Courts avoid interbranch disputes as "political questions."

### Presidential Exemptions

The President is exempt from most ethics laws:

| Exemption | Rationale | Problem |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Conflict of interest statute | Separation of powers | Obvious conflicts allowed |
| Recusal requirements | Can't recuse from presidential duties | Self-dealing continues |
| Hatch Act | Political activity inherent to office | Politicization of government |
| Many OGE regulations | Statutory exemptions | Double standard |

**Consequence**: The most powerful official has the fewest constraints.

### Weak Enforcement Mechanisms

**OGE**: Advisory role only; cannot compel compliance.

**Inspectors General**: Serve at pleasure of those they investigate.

**DOJ**: Political appointees decide on prosecutions.

**Congress**: Relies on executive cooperation for oversight.

### Self-Dealing in Appointments

Ethics enforcers are appointed by those they oversee:

- OGE Director appointed by President
- IGs appointed by President or agency heads
- DOJ officials appointed by President
- Agency ethics officials serve at pleasure

## Political Factors

### Partisan Protection

Partisan loyalty often trumps ethics enforcement:

**In-Party Protection**: Presidents and congressional majorities protect their own.

**Selective Outrage**: Ethics concerns raised selectively based on party.

**Investigation Weaponization**: Ethics investigations used as political weapons.

**Base Mobilization**: Ethics violations excused or celebrated by supporters.

### Short-Term Incentives

Political actors face short-term pressures:

- Election cycles prioritize immediate concerns
- Ethics enforcement is slow and invisible
- Public attention is limited and fleeting
- Future consequences discounted

### Revolving Door Economics

Post-government employment creates incentives:

| Incentive | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Lucrative lobbying careers | Favor potential future employers |
| Industry "capture" | Regulators become industry advocates |
| Information asymmetry | Former officials have valuable knowledge |
| Relationship currency | Connections are monetizable |

## Legal Factors

### Narrow Definitions

Ethics laws often defined narrowly:

**"Lobbying" Definition**: Technical definition excludes much influence activity.

**"Official Act" Requirement**: *McDonnell v. United States* narrowed bribery scope.

**"Emolument" Uncertainty**: No clear judicial definition.

**"Particular Matter"**: Limits conflict recusals to specific proceedings.

### Standing Barriers

Courts have blocked enforcement through standing doctrine:

- Competitors: Not sufficiently injured
- Taxpayers: Generalized grievances
- Congress: Institutional injury insufficient
- States: No direct injury from presidential conduct

### Mens Rea Requirements

Criminal ethics statutes require knowing violation:

- Intent difficult to prove
- Ignorance can be defense
- Creates incentive to avoid learning rules

### Weak Penalties

When violations are found, penalties are often minor:

| Penalty Type | Typical Result |
|--------------|---------------|
| Disclosure violations | Warning letter |
| Conflict violations | Recusal order |
| Revolving door | Rarely prosecuted |
| Emoluments | No mechanism |

## Institutional Factors

### Agency Culture

Ethics often secondary to mission:

- "Getting things done" prioritized
- Ethics seen as obstacle
- Compliance viewed as technicality
- Leadership sets tone

### Resource Constraints

Ethics functions often underfunded:

- OGE has limited staff
- Agency ethics offices stretched thin
- IG offices under-resourced
- Training inadequate

### Information Asymmetries

Enforcers lack information:

- Disclosure is self-reported
- Verification difficult
- Complex financial arrangements
- Hidden beneficial ownership

## Cultural Factors

### Normalization of Conflicts

Conflicts of interest have become normalized:

**Revolving Door Acceptance**: Moving between government and industry is expected.

**Wealth in Politics**: Rich officials seen as "can't be bought."

**Business Success Admiration**: Business background valued despite conflicts.

**"Drain the Swamp" Irony**: Anti-corruption rhetoric accompanies corruption.

### Declining Trust

Low trust creates self-reinforcing cycle:

- Public expects corruption
- Good people avoid government
- Violations surprise no one
- Reform seems futile

### Elite Impunity Expectation

Perception that powerful escape consequences:

- "Different rules" for elites
- Prosecution seen as politically motivated
- Settlements without admission
- Future employment unaffected

## Comparison with Other Systems

### Stronger Models

| Country | Feature |
|---------|---------|
| UK | Independent standards committees |
| Canada | Ethics Commissioner with authority |
| Germany | Strict post-employment restrictions |
| Australia | Independent anti-corruption bodies |

### Why US Differs

- Separation of powers ideology
- Suspicion of bureaucracy
- Private sector valorization
- Political polarization
