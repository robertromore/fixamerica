# Ethics and Accountability: Solutions

## Framework for Reform

Effective ethics reform should:

1. **Close coverage gaps** for senior officials including the President
2. **Create independent enforcement** not controlled by those subject to rules
3. **Strengthen penalties** to deter misconduct
4. **Enhance transparency** for public accountability
5. **Protect whistleblowers** who report wrongdoing
6. **Secure institutional independence** for oversight bodies

## Presidential Ethics

### Problem

The President is exempt from most ethics rules and no mechanism exists to enforce constitutional provisions like the emoluments clauses.

### Solution: Presidential Transparency and Accountability

**Tax Disclosure**:

- Require presidential candidates to release tax returns
- Continue annual disclosure during tenure
- Apply to Vice President as well

**Divestiture**:

- Require divestiture of businesses that create conflicts
- Qualified blind trust for investments
- No family involvement in businesses affected by government

**Emoluments Enforcement**:

- Clear definition of emoluments
- Reporting requirements for potential emoluments
- Congressional consent process
- Enforcement mechanism

### Solution: Office of Presidential Ethics

Create independent ethics oversight for the President:

- Senate-confirmed official with for-cause removal protection
- Authority to investigate presidential conflicts
- Public reporting of findings
- Referral authority for enforcement

## Independent Ethics Enforcement

### Problem

Current ethics enforcement depends on executive branch self-policing.

### Solution: Independent Ethics Commission

**Structure**:

- Bipartisan commission with staggered terms
- For-cause removal protection
- Covers all three branches
- Adequate resources and staff

**Authority**:

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Investigation | Investigate ethics complaints |
| Enforcement | Issue civil penalties |
| Referral | Refer criminal matters to DOJ |
| Rulemaking | Issue binding ethics regulations |
| Education | Training and guidance |

**Model**: Similar to FEC but with real enforcement authority

### Solution: Strengthen OGE

If independent commission not achievable, strengthen existing OGE:

- Longer, protected term for Director
- Enforcement authority, not just advisory
- Subpoena power
- Adequate funding

## Inspector General Protection

### Problem

IGs serve at pleasure of agency heads and can be fired without cause.

### Solution: IG Independence Act

**For-Cause Removal**:

- IGs removable only for cause
- 30-day notice to Congress with written reasons
- Congressional review period

**Structural Independence**:

- Budget protected from agency
- Separate reporting line
- Access to information guaranteed
- Subpoena authority for testimony

**Coverage**:

- IG for all significant agencies
- Fill vacant positions promptly
- Career IG track

## Whistleblower Protection

### Problem

Whistleblowers face retaliation despite legal protections.

### Solution: Comprehensive Whistleblower Protection

**Expanded Coverage**:

- All federal employees and contractors
- Intelligence community with appropriate procedures
- National security whistleblowing protections

**Stronger Remedies**:

| Reform | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Expedited process | Faster resolution |
| Compensatory damages | Full compensation |
| Punitive damages | Deter retaliation |
| Personal liability | Managers face consequences |
| Attorney's fees | Reduce financial barrier |

**Anonymous Reporting**:

- Secure channels for reporting
- Identity protection
- Anti-retaliation monitoring

## Conflicts of Interest

### Problem

Conflict of interest rules have exemptions and loopholes, especially for senior officials.

### Solution: Close Presidential Exemption

Apply conflict of interest statutes to President and Vice President:

- Recusal from matters affecting personal finances
- Divestiture requirements
- Waiver disclosure

### Solution: Strengthen Recusal Enforcement

- Written recusal determinations
- Public disclosure of recusals
- Monitoring of compliance
- Consequences for violations

### Solution: Extend Coverage

- Cover all senior officials
- Include indirect interests
- Address family conflicts
- Capture beneficial ownership

## Revolving Door Reform

### Problem

Post-employment restrictions are narrow and easily circumvented.

### Solution: Longer Cooling-Off Periods

| Official Level | Current | Proposed |
|----------------|---------|----------|
| Senior appointees | 2 years | 4 years |
| Other officials | 1 year | 2 years |
| Specific industry | None | 2-4 years |

### Solution: Broader Definition of Lobbying

- Include "strategic consulting"
- Cover behind-the-scenes influence
- Capture industry-specific restrictions

### Solution: Pre-Employment Restrictions

- Longer recusal from former employer matters
- Ban on regulating recent employers
- Disclosure of negotiations

### Solution: Enforcement Improvements

- Tracking of former officials
- Proactive monitoring
- Civil penalties for violations
- Debarment from future government service

## Financial Disclosure Reform

### Problem

Disclosure is incomplete, delayed, and difficult to verify.

### Solution: Enhanced Disclosure

**More Information**:

- Exact values, not ranges
- Beneficial ownership
- Debts and liabilities
- Family interests

**More Timely**:

- Periodic updates during year
- Transaction reporting
- Real-time for major changes

**More Accessible**:

- Searchable database
- Machine-readable format
- Centralized portal
- Audit capacity

### Solution: Verification

- Audit sample of disclosures
- Cross-reference with other data
- Penalties for inaccuracies

## Gift and Travel Reform

### Problem

Gift and travel restrictions have exceptions and are hard to monitor.

### Solution: Tighter Restrictions

- Lower gift thresholds
- Broader definition of gifts
- Stricter travel rules
- Fewer exceptions

### Solution: Better Reporting

- Real-time disclosure
- Public database
- Audit and verification

## Congressional Ethics

### Problem

Congressional ethics relies on peer enforcement with partisan considerations.

### Solution: Strengthen Office of Congressional Ethics

- Enforcement authority, not just advisory
- Bipartisan professional staff
- Public reporting
- Cover both chambers

### Solution: External Oversight

- Include Congress in independent ethics commission
- External review of ethics decisions
- Public hearings on significant matters
