# Ethics and Accountability: Roadmap

## Strategic Considerations

### Political Windows

Ethics reform opportunities typically follow scandals:

- Use public attention productively
- Have legislation ready for windows
- Build coalitions during quiet periods
- Document ongoing violations

### Bipartisan Framing

Ethics reform can appeal across parties:

- Future opposition party benefits from constraints
- Independent enforcement protects both sides
- Clear rules benefit all participants
- Corruption is universally unpopular

### Incremental vs. Comprehensive

**Advantages of Incremental**:

- Easier to pass
- Build momentum
- Test reforms

**Advantages of Comprehensive**:

- Address interconnected issues
- Use political capital efficiently
- Avoid partial fixes

**Recommended**: Combine—pass what's achievable, maintain comprehensive vision.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Year 1)

### Administrative Actions

**Executive Order**:

- Strengthen ethics pledges
- Expand disclosure requirements
- Tighten revolving door
- Protect IGs from retaliation

**Agency Actions**:

- OGE guidance updates
- Training enhancement
- Reporting improvements
- IG resource allocation

### Legislative Preparation

**Priority Bills**:

| Bill | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| IG Independence Act | Protect inspectors general |
| Whistleblower Enhancement | Strengthen protections |
| Presidential Tax Transparency | Require tax disclosure |
| Ethics Enforcement Act | Strengthen OGE |

**Coalition Building**:

- Unite good government groups
- Engage bipartisan congressional champions
- Build public support
- Develop stakeholder buy-in

### Quick Wins

**Disclosure Improvements**:

- Online accessibility
- Searchable database
- Faster posting
- Better formatting

**Guidance Clarification**:

- Clear ethics rules
- Plain language guidance
- Updated training
- FAQ resources

## Phase 2: Legislative Action (Years 1-2)

### Inspector General Protection

**IG Independence Act**:

- For-cause removal standard
- Congressional notification
- Budget protection
- Access guarantees

**Target**: Bipartisan support achievable; IG community support exists.

### Whistleblower Strengthening

**Comprehensive Whistleblower Protection**:

- Close coverage gaps
- Strengthen remedies
- Expedite process
- Intelligence community protections

**Target**: Build on existing bipartisan tradition.

### Disclosure Modernization

**Financial Disclosure Reform**:

- More precise reporting
- Better accessibility
- Verification mechanisms
- Real-time updates

**Target**: Technical improvement with bipartisan appeal.

## Phase 3: Structural Reform (Years 2-4)

### Presidential Ethics

**Presidential Accountability Package**:

- Tax disclosure requirement
- Divestiture standards
- Emoluments enforcement
- Ethics office for President

**Challenges**: Requires political will; may need scandal window.

**Strategy**: Pass as much as possible; use regulatory authority for rest.

### Independent Enforcement

**Ethics Enforcement Commission**:

- Independent structure
- Enforcement authority
- Adequate resources
- Comprehensive coverage

**Alternative**: Strengthen OGE with enforcement powers if commission not achievable.

### Revolving Door Comprehensive Reform

**Lobbying and Ethics Reform**:

- Extended cooling-off periods
- Broader definitions
- Better enforcement
- Pre-employment restrictions

## Phase 4: Constitutional Reform (Years 4+)

### Emoluments Clarification

**Constitutional Amendment** (if needed):

- Clear definition
- Enforcement mechanism
- Congressional process
- Judicial role

**Alternative**: Statutory clarification with constitutional avoidance.

### Congressional Ethics

**Ethics in Congress**:

- Independent oversight
- Stronger enforcement
- Better disclosure
- Public accountability

## Risk Assessment
