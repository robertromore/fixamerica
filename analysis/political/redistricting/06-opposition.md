# Redistricting: Opposition Analysis

## Primary Opponents

### Incumbent Politicians

**Who They Are**

- State legislators in safe seats
- Congressional representatives from gerrymandered districts
- Legislative leaders who control redistricting
- Politicians from both parties who benefit from current lines

**Why They Oppose Reform**

| Reason | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Self-preservation | Safe seats guarantee reelection |
| Power maintenance | Gerrymandering creates supermajorities |
| Donor relationships | Incumbency attracts contributions |
| Reduced work | Safe seats mean less campaigning |

**Specific Opposition**

- Ohio legislators defied state supreme court repeatedly
- Wisconsin legislators fought redistricting reform for years
- North Carolina legislature fought every court intervention

### Party Organizations

**State Party Committees**

- Control redistricting strategy
- Fund legal defense of gerrymandered maps
- Coordinate legislative resistance
- Recruit candidates for gerrymandered seats

**National Party Organizations**

| Organization | Role |
|--------------|------|
| REDMAP (Republican) | Coordinated 2010 redistricting strategy |
| NDRC (Democratic) | Counters Republican gerrymandering efforts |
| Party campaign committees | Protect incumbents, expand majorities |

**The Partisan Calculation**

- Whichever party controls more states benefits from status quo
- Republicans currently control more state legislatures
- Therefore, Republicans generally more opposed to national reform
- Democrats gerrymander where they can (IL, MD, NY)

- Federal intervention seen as overreach
- Local control preferred
- Judicial restraint favored

**Partisan Ideology**

- "Our party represents true America"
- Opposition party seen as illegitimate
- Winning by any means justified
- Reform seen as helping the enemy

## Their Tactics

### Legislative Obstruction

**In State Legislatures**

| Tactic | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Refuse to schedule hearings | Reform bills die in committee |
| Amend to death | Add poison pills to reform bills |
| Procedural blocking | Use rules to prevent votes |
| Delayed implementation | Push reform past next redistricting |

**Defiance of Courts**

- Ohio: Legislature submitted multiple maps courts rejected
- North Carolina: Repeated attempts to circumvent rulings
- Wisconsin: Fought every legal challenge

### Legal Challenges

**Against Reform Measures**

| Target | Legal Argument |
|--------|----------------|
| Ballot initiatives | Procedural violations |
| Independent commissions | Violate state constitution |
| Court-ordered maps | Judicial overreach |
| Federal legislation | Unconstitutional |

**Case Study: Arizona**

- Independent commission created by voters in 2000
- Legislature sued to invalidate
- Supreme Court upheld commission (5-4) in 2015
- But legal threat was serious

### Ballot Measure Opposition

**Campaign Tactics**

- Misleading messaging ("Politicians will still draw the maps")
- Fear-based appeals ("Unelected bureaucrats")
- Heavy spending (outspend reformers in some states)
- Technical procedural challenges

**Examples**

| State | Year | Opposition Tactic | Outcome |
|-------|------|-------------------|---------|
| Missouri | 2020 | Repealed reform from 2018 | Voters reversed previous reform |
| Utah | 2021 | Legislature gutted commission | Reform weakened |
| Ohio | Ongoing | Defiance despite reforms | Repeated violations |

### Post-Passage Attacks

**Weakening Reforms**

| Tactic | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Defund commissions | Cut budget for independent bodies |
| Appoint partisans | Stock commissions with loyalists |
| Ignore commission recommendations | Utah, Virginia |
| Amend to weaken | Missouri reversal |

**Court Packing**

- Judicial elections affect redistricting outcomes
- North Carolina: Court flip changed redistricting rulings
- Ohio: Partisan fights over court composition
- Wisconsin: Liberal court majority changes trajectory

### Messaging and PR

**Public Narratives**

| Message | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "Voters chose us" | Through gerrymandered districts |
| "Both sides do it" | True but doesn't justify it |
| "Commissions are unaccountable" | More accountable than self-interested legislators |
| "Courts shouldn't make political decisions" | Courts protect rights |

**Media Strategy**

- Emphasize Democratic gerrymandering to neutralize
- Frame as partisan attack by losing party
- Question commission members' credentials
- Highlight any flaws in reform implementation

## Their Messaging

### Core Arguments

**"It's Constitutional"**

- Constitution gives states redistricting authority
- No federal constitutional requirement for fairness
- Courts properly deferred in Rucho
- State legislative supremacy

**Counter**: Constitutional doesn't mean right; states can still reform

**"Both Sides Do It"**

- Democrats gerrymander in Illinois, Maryland, New York
- Reform is partisan attack on Republicans
- Fair-sounding but asymmetric
- Used to justify continued gerrymandering

**Counter**: Both parties doing it makes it worse, not better; solution benefits everyone

**"Independent Commissions Are Unelected Bureaucrats"**

- Commissioners not accountable to voters
- Takes power from elected representatives
- Could be captured by special interests
- Removes democratic control

**Counter**: Elected officials accountable to gerrymandered districts aren't really accountable; commissions have transparent processes

**"Algorithms Can't Be Fair"**

- Fairness is subjective
- No objective standard exists
- Computers reflect programmers' biases
- Human judgment required

**Counter**: Ensemble analysis shows what's typical; clear when maps are outliers

### State-Specific Messaging

**Ohio**

- "We're following the constitution" (while defying court orders)
- "Complex process requires time" (while running out the clock)
- "Commission is working" (while deadlocking)

**North Carolina**

- "Courts are overreaching"
- "Legislature has constitutional authority"
- "New court correctly interprets law"

**Texas**

- "We're protecting minority representation" (while diluting it)
- "Population growth requires new lines"
- "Maps reflect community preferences"

### Legal Arguments

**In Courts**

| Argument | Counter |
|----------|---------|
| Political question | State constitutions can address |
| No manageable standard | Ensemble analysis provides standard |
| Legislature's authority | Can be constrained by constitution |
| No actual harm | Vote dilution is documented harm |

## Weaknesses

### Public Opinion

**Reform Is Popular**

| Poll Finding | Percentage |
|--------------|------------|
| Support independent redistricting | 60-70% |
| Believe gerrymandering is wrong | 70%+ |
| Support for fair maps | Supermajority bipartisan |
| Trust in legislators to draw maps | Low |

**Vulnerability**

- Opposition must fight popular sentiment
- Ballot measures typically win
- Bipartisan support is genuine
- Harder to message against "fairness"

### Legitimacy Deficit

**The Argument Problem**

- Hard to defend "politicians should choose their voters"
- Self-dealing is obvious
- Conflict of interest is clear
- "We like gerrymandering" is not persuasive

**How They Compensate**

- Obscure the issue (technical arguments)
- Distract (both sides do it)
- Misdirect (unelected bureaucrats)
- Delay (legal challenges)

### Inconsistency

**The "Both Sides" Problem**

- If both parties gerrymander, why oppose reform?
- If it's fine when we do it, why criticize when they do?
- Logical inconsistency undermines messaging
- Exposes partisan self-interest

### Court Vulnerability

**State Courts Still Active**

- Federal courts closed, but state courts open
- State constitutional provisions can be enforced
- Several state courts have invalidated maps
- Judicial elections can shift outcomes

**Legal Risk**

- Extreme gerrymanders risk court intervention
- VRA violations still actionable
- Racial gerrymandering claims possible
- Ongoing legal exposure

### Reform Momentum

**The Trend**

| Decade | Reform Progress |
|--------|-----------------|
| 2000s | Arizona, California begin commission movement |
| 2010s | Michigan, Colorado, Utah adopt reforms |
| 2020s | More states considering; courts active |

**Defenders Fighting Tide**

- Reform has momentum
- Successful models to copy
- Growing public awareness
- Opposition swimming upstream

## Counter-Strategies

| Their Message | Counter-Message |
|---------------|-----------------|
| "Both sides do it" | "Then let's stop both sides" |
| "Unelected bureaucrats" | "Transparent citizen process" |
