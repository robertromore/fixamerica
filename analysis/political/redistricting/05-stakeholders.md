# Redistricting: Stakeholders

## Who Benefits from Gerrymandering

### Politicians in Safe Seats

**Incumbent Legislators**

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Job security | Virtually guaranteed reelection |
| Reduced fundraising | Less competitive races mean less money needed |
| Freedom from moderation | No need to appeal to swing voters |
| Less constituent work | Voters have nowhere else to go |

**Party Leadership**

- Control over members (safe seat = party loyalty)
- Predictable majorities in legislatures
- Ability to reward loyalty with favorable districts
- Punishment power over dissenters

### The Majority Party

**Whoever Controls Redistricting**

- Can win legislative majorities with minority of votes
- Locks in power for decade
- Controls policy agenda disproportionately
- Creates "permanent" advantage from single election win

**Both Parties When They Can**

| State | Controlling Party | Gerrymandering |
|-------|-------------------|----------------|
| Texas | Republican | Extreme R advantage |
| Florida | Republican | Strong R advantage |
| Ohio | Republican | Repeated violations of state constitution |
| Illinois | Democratic | Extreme D advantage |
| Maryland | Democratic | Extreme D advantage (Congressional) |

### Political Operatives

**Redistricting Consultants**

- Draw maps for partisan advantage
- Highly paid for technical expertise
- Work is perfectly legal
- Create lasting political infrastructure

**Campaign Professionals**

- Safe seats create predictable work
- Less uncertainty in election outcomes
- Established relationships with incumbents
- Long-term employment stability

### Special Interests

**Those with Legislative Access**

- Entrenched incumbents = predictable relationships
- Safe seat holders can't be voted out for unpopular votes
- Special interests prefer known quantities
- Gerrymandering protects their legislative allies

**Industries Benefiting**

| Industry | Interest in Gerrymandering |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Fossil fuel | Protects climate deniers |
| Finance | Protects deregulation supporters |
| Healthcare | Protects those opposing reforms |
| Defense contractors | Protects military spending supporters |

## Who Is Harmed by Gerrymandering

### Voters

**All Voters in Gerrymandered Districts**

| Harm | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Wasted votes | Packed voters' votes don't affect outcomes |
| Diluted representation | Cracked voters can't elect representatives |
| Reduced choice | Many races are uncontested |
| Decreased accountability | Representatives don't fear voters |

**Specific Voter Groups**
*Minority Voters*

- Racial gerrymandering dilutes voting power
- Communities of interest split apart
- VRA protections weakened
- Historical disenfranchisement continues

*Urban Voters*

- Naturally concentrated (packed)
- Cracked into surrounding suburban districts
- Underrepresented in state legislatures
- City interests subordinated to rural

*Suburban Swing Voters*

- Often cracked to dilute competitive tendencies
- Packed into token competitive districts
- Voice diminished in legislature
- Moderate preferences ignored

### Communities

**Split Communities**

- Counties divided among multiple districts
- Cities fractured into pieces
- Neighborhoods separated
- Schools, services, local concerns divided

**Examples of Split Communities**

| Community | How Split | Effect |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Austin, TX | Split 5+ ways | No single representative for city |
| Milwaukee, WI | Cracked into suburban districts | Urban voice diluted |
| Nashville, TN | Split into 3 districts | Metro area divided |

### The Minority Party

**Structural Disadvantage**

- Can win popular vote but lose seat share
- Locked out of power for decade
- Policy preferences ignored
- No path to majority through fair competition

**Specific Harms**

| Harm | Example |
|------|---------|
| Seat deficit | Win 50% of votes, get 35% of seats |
| Demoralization | Why compete in unwinnable races? |
| Candidate recruitment | Talented candidates don't run |
| Resource drain | Must spend more to win less |

### Democracy Itself

**Systemic Harms**

- Legitimacy of government undermined
- Representative democracy becomes theater
- Voter cynicism increases
- Trust in institutions erodes

**Downstream Effects**

- Polarization (safe seats reward extremism)
- Gridlock (no accountability to moderate)
- Policy stagnation (insulated from public)
- Civic disengagement (why participate?)

## Who Has Power to Change Things

### State Legislatures

**Current Power**

- Draw maps in most states (~65%)
- Can create independent commissions
- Can refer amendments to voters
- Control implementation of any reform

**Constraints**

- Conflict of interest (turkeys voting for Thanksgiving)
- Partisan majorities resist giving up advantage
- Reform requires reformers to vote themselves out

### State Courts

**Current Role**

- Enforce state constitutional provisions
- Can strike down discriminatory maps
- Interpret fairness requirements
- Vary dramatically by state

**Key State Courts**

| State | Court Stance | Recent Action |
|-------|-------------|---------------|
| Pennsylvania | Active | Threw out gerrymandered map |
| North Carolina | Reversed | Initially threw out maps, then court flipped |
| Ohio | Active | Repeatedly rejected unconstitutional maps |
| Wisconsin | Newly active | New liberal majority hearing challenges |

### Voters (Through Ballot Initiatives)

**Direct Democracy Power**

- Can bypass legislatures in ~24 states
- Have created independent commissions
- Can amend state constitutions
- Most successful reform pathway

**Limitations**

- Not available in all states
- Signature requirements challenging
- Opposition campaigns well-funded
- Requires sustained organizing

### Federal Courts

**Limited Role Post-Rucho**

- Partisan gerrymandering claims closed
- Racial gerrymandering still actionable
- VRA Section 2 claims possible
- Cannot address partisan distortion

**What They Can Still Do**

| Type of Case | Status |
|--------------|--------|
| Racial gerrymandering | Justiciable |
| VRA Section 2 | Justiciable |
| One person, one vote | Justiciable |
| Partisan gerrymandering | Nonjusticiable |

### Congress

**Potential Powers**

- Could mandate independent redistricting for Congress
- Could strengthen VRA
- Could set national standards
- Has authority under Elections Clause

**Constraints**

- Senate filibuster blocks major legislation
- Members benefit from gerrymandering
- For the People Act passed House, died in Senate
- Constitutional limits on state legislative maps

### U.S. Supreme Court

**Current Posture**

- Closed door on partisan claims (Rucho)
- Skeptical of court involvement
- Conservative majority unlikely to reconsider
- Would need new appointments to change
