# Redistricting: Current State

## The Problem Today

### The 2020 Redistricting Cycle

The 2020 census triggered the most recent redistricting cycle, with states drawing new maps for 2022 elections and beyond. Despite reform progress in some states, partisan gerrymandering remained pervasive:

**What Happened**

- Republicans controlled redistricting in more states
- Democrats gerrymandered where they could (IL, MD, NY)
- Independent commissions produced fairer maps where they existed
- Courts intervened in several states
- Some extreme gerrymanders were struck down under state constitutions

**The Outcome**

- Most states: politicians picked their voters
- Few truly competitive House seats
- State legislatures often more skewed than Congress
- Reform momentum continues but unevenly

### Current Map of Redistricting Control

| Control Type | Number of States | Examples |
|--------------|------------------|----------|
| Republican-controlled legislature | ~20 | TX, FL, GA, OH, NC |
| Democratic-controlled legislature | ~9 | IL, MD, NY, NM |
| Split control/bipartisan required | ~8 | Various |
| Independent/citizen commission | ~10 | CA, MI, AZ, CO |
| Court-drawn/other | ~3 | Varies |

## Key Statistics

### Competition Crisis

**House of Representatives**

| Metric | 2022 Data |
|--------|-----------|
| Total seats | 435 |
| Truly competitive seats | ~35-45 |
| Safe Republican seats | ~180-200 |
| Safe Democratic seats | ~190-210 |
| Seats decided by >20 points | ~300+ |

**State Legislatures**

- Even less competitive than Congress
- Many states: >80% of seats uncontested or landslides
- Incumbency reelection rate: ~95%+
- Primary as only real election: majority of seats

### Representation Distortions

**Examples from 2022**

| State | Party Vote Share | Seat Share | Distortion |
|-------|------------------|------------|------------|
| Wisconsin | D: ~50% | D: 35% Assembly | -15 points |
| Ohio | D: ~47% | D: 33% House | -14 points |
| North Carolina | D: ~50% | D: 43% House | -7 points |
| Maryland | R: ~36% | R: 0% Congress | -36 points |

### Efficiency Gap Analysis

**Worst Gerrymanders (by efficiency gap)**

| State | Level | Efficiency Gap | Direction |
|-------|-------|----------------|-----------|
| Wisconsin | State | 10%+ | R advantage |
| North Carolina | State | 8%+ | R advantage |
| Maryland | Congress | 15%+ | D advantage |
| Ohio | Congress | 8%+ | R advantage |

### Incumbency Advantage

| Metric | Data |
|--------|------|
| House incumbent reelection rate | ~95% |
| State legislature reelection rate | ~90%+ |
| Incumbents losing primaries | ~1-2% |
| Incumbents losing general elections | ~2-5% |

## The Reform Landscape

### States with Independent Commissions

**Strong Independent Commissions**

| State | Type | Result |
|-------|------|--------|
| California | Citizens commission | Competitive maps |
| Michigan | Citizens commission | Much fairer maps |
| Arizona | Bipartisan commission | Generally balanced |
| Colorado | Independent commission | Fair outcomes |

**Advisory or Politician Commissions**

| State | Type | Effectiveness |
|-------|------|---------------|
| Iowa | Nonpartisan staff | Very effective |
| Virginia | Commission + legislature | Partial success |
| New York | Commission (gutted) | Court intervention needed |
| Ohio | Commission (failed) | Partisan outcomes despite reform |

### States with Persistent Gerrymandering

**Worst Offenders**

| State | Control | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Texas | R legislature | Extreme R advantage |
| Florida | R legislature | Partisan, with DeSantis map |
| Ohio | R legislature | Violated state constitution repeatedly |
| North Carolina | R legislature | State courts intervened |
| Wisconsin | R legislature | Among most gerrymandered |
| Illinois | D legislature | Extreme D advantage |
| Maryland | D legislature | Extreme D advantage (Congress) |

### Court Interventions

**Recent Key Cases**

| State | Court | Outcome |
|-------|-------|---------|
| North Carolina | State Supreme Court | Maps thrown out (then reversed after court flip) |
| Ohio | State Supreme Court | Maps repeatedly rejected |
| Pennsylvania | State Supreme Court | Congressional map redrawn |
| Wisconsin | State Supreme Court | State legislative maps challenged |
| Alabama | Federal courts | VRA violation found |

## Impact Analysis

### On Representation

**Partisan Distortion**

- Majority party can win minority of votes
- Supermajorities possible with slim popular margins
- Opposition voters effectively disenfranchised
- Unearned mandate claimed by gerrymandering winners

**Constituency Confusion**

- Districts ignore community boundaries
- Split cities, counties, neighborhoods
- Voters unsure who represents them
- Representatives serve geographic puzzle pieces

### On Competition

**General Election Impact**

- Most races predetermined
- Campaigns focus on tiny number of competitive seats
- Voter contact only in battlegrounds
- Resources concentrated in few places

**Primary Election Impact**

- Primary becomes real election in safe seats
- More extreme voters dominate primaries
- Moderate candidates disadvantaged
- Cross-partisan appeal unnecessary

### On Polarization

**The Mechanism**

1. Safe districts created
2. Only primary voters matter
3. Primary voters more partisan
4. Extremism rewarded
5. Compromise punished
6. Polarization increases

**Evidence**

- Members from safe seats more ideologically extreme
- Bipartisan bills less common
- Willingness to negotiate decreased
- Gridlock increased

### On Voter Engagement

**Participation Effects**

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Turnout in safe districts | Lower |
| Voter interest | Decreased when outcome predetermined |
| Candidate recruitment | Fewer candidates in unwinnable seats |
| Civic engagement | Reduced when votes don't matter |

## Recent Developments

### 2023-2024 Updates

**Court Cases**

- Wisconsin: New liberal majority hearing redistricting challenges
- North Carolina: Conservative court reversed previous rulings
- Louisiana, Alabama: VRA cases affecting minority representation
- Ohio: Continued constitutional violations

**Legislative Action**

- Some states considering reform for 2030
- Virginia used new commission (with mixed results)
- Federal reform proposals stalled
- State-level ballot initiatives being prepared

### Reform Momentum

**Successful Reforms Since 2018**

| State | Year | Reform |
|-------|------|--------|
| Michigan | 2018 | Citizens commission |
| Colorado | 2018 | Independent commissions |
| Utah | 2018 | Advisory commission (weakened) |
| Virginia | 2020 | Amendment (implemented 2021) |
| Ohio | 2015, 2018 | Reforms (not followed) |

**Pending/Potential Reforms**

| State | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Wisconsin | New court may address |
| Pennsylvania | Reform legislation proposed |
| Nevada | Potential ballot initiative |
| Various | 2030 preparation underway |

### Federal Action

**For the People Act (H.R. 1)**

- Would require independent redistricting for Congress
- Passed House multiple times
- Blocked in Senate by filibuster
- Model for future action

**Freedom to Vote Act**

- Similar redistricting provisions
- Also blocked in Senate
- Demonstrates reform support

**John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act**

- Would restore VRA preclearance
- Relevant to racial gerrymandering
- Also blocked in Senate

### Technology Changes

**Mapping Software**

- More sophisticated gerrymandering possible
- But also better detection tools
- Citizen access to redistricting tools
- Transparency increasing

**Public Engagement**

- Online mapping tools for citizens
- Public hearings more accessible
- Data analysis widely available
- Harder to hide gerrymandering

## Key Takeaways

1. **Gerrymandering remains pervasive**: Most states still allow politicians to draw maps
2. **Reform is spreading**: Independent commissions work where implemented
3. **Courts play key role**: State courts can enforce state constitutions
4. **Federal courts limited**: *Rucho* closed federal courthouse for partisan claims
5. **2030 is critical**: Next redistricting cycle is opportunity for reform
6. **Competition is rare**: Most seats are safe; most elections predetermined
7. **Polarization connection**: Safe seats drive extremism
8. **Public wants reform**: Strong bipartisan support for independent redistricting
