# Redistricting: Solutions

## Guiding Principles

### Criteria for Fair Redistricting

**Essential Principles**

| Principle | Meaning | Why It Matters |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Population equality | Equal people per district | Constitutional requirement |
| Contiguity | Connected territory | Basic reasonableness |
| Compactness | Geographically coherent | Prevents bizarre shapes |
| Community preservation | Keep communities together | Meaningful representation |
| Competitiveness | Balanced partisan composition | Electoral accountability |
| Proportionality | Seats reflect vote shares | Fair representation |

### Hierarchy of Criteria

**Priority Order**

1. **Population equality** (Constitutional requirement)
2. **Compliance with Voting Rights Act** (Federal law)
3. **Contiguity** (Physical connection)
4. **Compactness** (Reasonable shapes)
5. **Preservation of political subdivisions** (Counties, cities)
6. **Preservation of communities of interest** (Shared concerns)
7. **Competitiveness** (Electoral accountability)
8. **Partisan fairness** (Proportional outcomes)

### Process Principles

**Transparency**

- Open meetings
- Public input
- Accessible data
- Clear criteria

**Independence**

- No self-interested actors
- Neutral commission members
- Insulated from political pressure
- Binding authority

**Accountability**

- Clear standards
- Judicial review available
- Public reporting
- Regular evaluation

## Policy Proposals

### Independent Redistricting Commissions

**The Core Solution**

Remove map-drawing from legislators who benefit from gerrymandering and give it to independent citizens.

**Commission Models**

| Model | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Citizen Commission** | Random selection of ordinary citizens | California, Michigan |
| **Bipartisan Commission** | Equal party representation + tiebreaker | Arizona |
| **Nonpartisan Staff** | Professional staff draws, legislature approves | Iowa |
| **Hybrid** | Commission proposes, legislature has limited say | Various |

**Best Practice Commission Design**
*Selection Process*

1. Applications from interested citizens
2. Screening for conflicts of interest
3. Random selection from qualified pool
4. Partisan balance requirements
5. Demographic diversity goals

*Composition*

- Equal numbers of major party members
- Significant number of independents
- No current/recent officeholders
- No lobbyists or party officials
- Geographic diversity

*Process Requirements*

- Public hearings statewide
- Transparent deliberations
- Online mapping tools for public
- Draft maps for public comment
- Clear criteria for decision-making

*Authority*

- Binding authority (not advisory)
- Maps effective without legislative approval
- Court review for legal compliance only
- No legislative override

### Fair Districting Criteria

**Legally Required Standards**

| Criterion | Definition | Purpose |
|-----------|------------|---------|
| Population equality | <1% deviation for Congress, <5% for state | One person, one vote |
| Contiguity | All parts physically connected | Reasonable districts |
| Compactness | Various mathematical measures | Prevent bizarre shapes |
| VRA compliance | Opportunity districts for minorities | Protect voting rights |

**Additional Fairness Criteria**
*Partisan Fairness*

- No more than 8% efficiency gap
- Proportional seats-votes relationship
- Symmetry: same vote share yields same seat share
- Ensemble analysis: maps not outliers

*Community Preservation*

- Keep counties whole where possible
- Keep cities whole where possible
- Preserve neighborhoods and communities of interest
- Minimize splits of existing boundaries

*Competitiveness*

- Maximize competitive districts where possible
- Don't sacrifice other criteria for competitiveness
- Consider when consistent with other goals

### State Constitutional Amendments

**Strengthening State Constitutions**
What to Include:

1. Explicit ban on partisan gerrymandering
2. Required fairness criteria
3. Independent redistricting commission
4. Binding authority (no legislative override)
5. Enforcement mechanisms
6. Court review with clear standards

**Model Language Elements**
*Anti-Gerrymandering Provision*
> "Districts shall not be drawn to favor or disfavor any political party. Districts shall not be drawn to protect incumbents or candidates. The efficiency gap of any map shall not exceed 8%."

*Commission Mandate*
> "Congressional and legislative districts shall be drawn by an independent citizens redistricting commission with binding authority. The legislature shall not have power to override commission decisions."

*Enforcement*
> "Any citizen may challenge maps in state court. Courts shall evaluate maps against required criteria. If maps violate standards, courts shall order new maps or draw them."

### Federal Legislation

**For the People Act Provisions**
What Federal Law Could Require:

- Independent commissions for congressional redistricting
- Mandatory fairness criteria
- Transparency requirements
- Judicial review standards

**Constitutional Authority**

- Elections Clause: Congress can regulate congressional elections
- Can mandate redistricting process for federal offices
- Cannot mandate for state legislative districts directly

**Limitations**

- Currently blocked by Senate filibuster
- Would not affect state legislative maps
- Enforcement requires litigation
- Conservative courts might narrow

### Algorithmic Redistricting

**Computer-Drawn Districts**

| Approach | Method | Pros | Cons |
|----------|--------|------|------|
| Optimization algorithms | Maximize criteria mathematically | Objective, reproducible | "Black box" concerns |
| Shortest splitline | Divide by shortest line recursively | Simple, transparent | Ignores communities |
| Ensemble analysis | Generate thousands of maps | Shows what's typical | Doesn't produce single map |

**Uses of Algorithms**
*Map Generation*

- Generate candidate maps meeting criteria
- Explore trade-offs between criteria
- Produce options for commission review

*Map Evaluation*

- Compare proposed maps to random maps
- Identify partisan outliers
- Measure against fairness metrics

*Public Engagement*

- Online tools for citizen map-drawing
- Visualization of options
- Education about trade-offs

### Multi-Member Districts

**Alternative to Single-Member Districts**
How It Works:

- Multiple representatives per district
- Voters choose multiple candidates
- Proportional or semi-proportional results
- Less sensitive to boundary lines

**Benefits**

| Advantage | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| Reduces gerrymandering | Larger districts harder to manipulate |
| More proportional | Better representation of minorities |
| More competitive | Multiple seats in play |
| Better representation | More voters have representative of choice |

**Challenges**

- Federal law currently requires single-member for Congress
- Requires significant voter education
- May require constitutional change in some states
- Cultural shift from winner-take-all

## Structural Reforms

### Changing Who Draws Maps

**From Legislators to Citizens**

| Current System | Reformed System |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Legislators draw own districts | Independent citizens draw |
| Partisan optimization | Neutral criteria |
| Closed process | Transparent process |
| Self-interest | Public interest |

**Implementation Paths**
*Ballot Initiative* (where available)

1. Draft initiative language
2. Gather signatures
3. Campaign for passage
4. Defend against legal challenges
5. Monitor implementation

*Legislative Referral*

1. Build public pressure
2. Persuade legislators to refer
3. Campaign for voter approval
4. Ensure strong implementation

*Legislative Action*

1. Elect reform-minded legislators
2. Pass commission legislation
3. Override gubernatorial veto if needed
4. Defend against weakening

### Changing When Maps Are Evaluated

**From Once-a-Decade to Ongoing**

| Current | Reformed |
|---------|----------|
| Maps last 10 years | Regular evaluation |
| No mid-decade adjustment | Adjustment for extreme unfairness |
| Elections using bad maps | Earlier intervention |

**Mechanisms**

- Automatic evaluation after each election
- Trigger for redistricting if metrics fail
- Court jurisdiction for ongoing review
- Commission authority to recommend adjustments

### Changing How Fairness Is Measured

**From Subjective to Objective**

| Old Approach | New Approach |
|--------------|--------------|
| "I know it when I see it" | Mathematical metrics |
| No standard | Efficiency gap, mean-median |
| Easy to manipulate | Ensemble analysis |
| Partisan claims of fairness | Objective evaluation |

**Key Metrics**
*Efficiency Gap*

- Measure of wasted votes
- Threshold: 8% or less
- Well-established methodology
- Court-tested

*Mean-Median Difference*

- Skew in vote distribution
- Party average vs. median district
- Shows asymmetric advantage
- Intuitive to explain

*Ensemble Analysis*

- Generate thousands of maps
- Compare proposed map to distribution
- Identify statistical outliers
- Shows what's normal vs. manipulated

## Alternative Approaches

### Nonpartisan Staff Model (Iowa)

**How It Works**

1. Nonpartisan legislative staff draw maps
2. No political data used
3. Legislature votes yes/no (no amendments)
4. Process repeats if rejected (up to limit)
5. Court draws if impasse

**Advantages**

- Simple to implement
- Low cost
- Professional expertise
- Has worked well in Iowa

**Limitations**

- Depends on staff independence
- Legislature can still reject
- Not truly independent
- May not work everywhere

### Bipartisan Commission (Arizona)

**How It Works**

1. Four partisan members (2D, 2R)
2. One independent chair
3. Chair selected by partisans
4. Supermajority required for map

**Advantages**

- Ensures both parties have voice
- Chair provides tiebreaker
- Consensus building encouraged
- Survived Supreme Court challenge

**Limitations**

- Chair selection can be contentious
- Still involves partisan actors
- Deadlock possible
- Depends on independent being truly neutral

### Citizen Commission (California, Michigan)

**How It Works**

1. Open application process
2. Screening for conflicts
3. Random selection from qualified pool
4. Partisan balance in final commission
5. Public hearings and deliberation
6. Maps require diverse support

**Advantages**

- Truly independent
- Diverse perspectives
- Public-facing process
- Removes politicians entirely

**Limitations**

- Complex selection process
- Citizens need support/education
- More expensive
- Requires significant infrastructure

### Proportional Representation

**How It Works**

- Move away from single-member districts
- Multi-member districts with proportional allocation
- Eliminates gerrymandering by design
- Every vote counts toward representation

**Advantages**

- Structural solution (not bandaid)
- More representative outcomes
- Reduces wasted votes
- Increases competition

**Limitations**

- Major cultural shift required
- Federal law change needed for Congress
- Voter education essential
- May face resistance

### Arizona Independent Redistricting Commission

**Background**

- Created by Proposition 106 (2000)
- Survived Supreme Court challenge (2015)
- Multiple redistricting cycles completed

**Results**

| Metric | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Independence | Maintained through multiple cycles |
| Fairness | Generally balanced outcomes |
| Legal survival | Withstood major challenge |
| Partisan manipulation | Significantly reduced |

**Challenges**

- Chair selection contentious
- Some cycles more successful than others

**Results**

| Metric | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Competitiveness | Among highest in nation |
| Partisan fairness | Generally fair |
| Cost | Low (uses existing staff) |
| Simplicity | Easy to understand |

**Why It Works in Iowa**

- Strong nonpartisan staff tradition
- Political culture supports fairness
- Relatively homogeneous state
- Less partisan than other states

**Transferability**

- May not work in highly partisan states
- Requires strong civil service tradition
- Legislature can still reject
- Staff must be truly independent

## Trade-offs

### Competitiveness vs. Community Preservation

**The Tension**

- Competitive districts may split communities
- Keeping communities together may create safe seats
- Can't always maximize both
- Must prioritize

**Resolution**

| Approach | Trade-off |
|----------|-----------|
| Prioritize competitiveness | Some communities split |
| Prioritize communities | Some safe seats |
| Balance | Imperfect on both |
| Multi-member districts | Can achieve both |

### Proportionality vs. Geographic Representation

**The Tension**

- Proportional outcomes may require creative geography
- Clean geographic districts may not be proportional
- Single-member districts inherently distort

**Resolution**

- Accept some geographic imperfection for fairness
- Use ensemble analysis to find balance
- Consider multi-member districts
- Prioritize fairness over aesthetics

### Independence vs. Accountability

**The Tension**

- Independent commissions remove elected officials
- But commissioners aren't elected
- Accountability mechanisms needed
- Balance independence with transparency

**Resolution**

| Mechanism | How It Addresses |
|-----------|------------------|
| Transparent process | Public can observe |
| Clear criteria | Standards for evaluation |
| Judicial review | Legal accountability |
| Public input | Democratic participation |

### Simplicity vs. Precision

**The Tension**

- Simple rules easy to understand
- Complex metrics more precise
- Voters may not understand technical criteria
- But simple rules can be gamed

**Resolution**

- Use technical metrics with plain-language explanations
- Primary criteria should be intuitive
- Ensemble analysis for verification
- Education for commissioners and public
