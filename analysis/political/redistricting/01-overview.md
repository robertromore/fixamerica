# Redistricting: Overview

## Executive Summary

Gerrymandering—the manipulation of electoral district boundaries for partisan advantage—is one of the most corrosive forces in American democracy. Every ten years after the census, most states allow partisan legislators to draw district lines, enabling politicians to choose their voters rather than voters choosing their representatives. This practice entrenches incumbents, reduces electoral competition, and distorts representation so that legislative majorities don't reflect popular vote shares.

The result is a system where elections are decided before a single vote is cast. In gerrymandered states, the party that controls redistricting can win supermajorities with minority vote shares. Representatives from safe districts face no accountability to moderate voters, driving polarization. And voters in "packed" or "cracked" districts effectively have no voice in their government.

Reform is possible and happening. Independent redistricting commissions, court challenges, and ballot initiatives have made progress in many states. But the path to fair maps requires sustained effort—and the 2030 census will create another opportunity for either reform or further entrenchment.

## The Core Problem

### Gerrymandering 101

**What It Is**

Gerrymandering is the practice of drawing electoral district boundaries to advantage one party, group, or set of incumbents over others.

**The Two Techniques**

| Technique | How It Works | Effect |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| **Packing** | Concentrate opposition voters in few districts | Opponents win those districts by huge margins but waste votes |
| **Cracking** | Split opposition voters among many districts | Opponents can't win anywhere—diluted below winning threshold |

**Visual Example**

Fair Districts:           Gerrymandered:
┌───┬───┬───┐            ┌───────────┐
│ D │ D │ R │            │     D     │ ← Packed
├───┼───┼───┤            ├─────┬─────┤
│ D │ R │ R │            │  R  │  R  │ ← Cracked Ds
├───┼───┼───┤            ├─────┴─────┤
│ R │ R │ R │            │     R     │
└───┴───┴───┘            └───────────┘
50% D, 50% R             Same voters, different outcome
Result: 3D-6R            Result: 1D-3R (or worse)

### Who Controls Redistricting

| Method | States | Risk of Gerrymandering |
|--------|--------|------------------------|
| State legislature | ~33 states | High (fox guarding henhouse) |
| Independent commission | ~10 states | Low |
| Politician commission | ~5 states | Medium |
| Court/other | ~2 states | Varies |

**The Problem**: In most states, the politicians who benefit from gerrymandering are the ones who draw the maps.

## By the Numbers

### Electoral Distortion

| Metric | Example |
|--------|---------|
| **Efficiency gap** | In 2012, PA Democrats won 51% of votes but only 28% of seats |
| **Wasted votes** | Millions of votes in packed/cracked districts don't affect outcomes |
| **Uncontested races** | Many gerrymandered seats go uncontested |
| **Landslide margins** | Safe seats won by 20-40+ points |

### Competition Crisis

| Metric | Data |
|--------|------|
| Competitive House seats | ~40 of 435 (~9%) |
| House incumbents who lose | ~5-10% in any year |
| Safe seats | >90% have predetermined outcomes |
| Primary as real election | Majority of districts |

### Representation Gap

| State | Popular Vote | Seat Share | Gap |
|-------|--------------|------------|-----|
| Wisconsin 2018 | D: 53% | D: 36% of Assembly | -17 points |
| North Carolina 2018 | D: 51% | D: 23% of seats | -28 points |
| Maryland | R: 36% | R: 12% of seats | -24 points |

## Key Concepts

### Partisan Gerrymandering

**Definition**: Drawing districts to advantage one political party

**Legal Status**

- Not unconstitutional under federal law (*Rucho v. Common Cause*, 2019)
- Can be challenged under state constitutions
- Political question doctrine shields federal courts

**Effects**

- Vote-seat disparity
- Reduced competition
- Polarization (safe seats reward extremes)
- Voter disenfranchisement

### Racial Gerrymandering

**Definition**: Drawing districts to dilute minority voting power

**Legal Status**

- Unconstitutional under 14th Amendment
- Violations of Voting Rights Act (Section 2)
- Courts actively hear these cases
- Burden of proof complex

**Forms**

- Packing: Concentrate minorities in few districts
- Cracking: Split minority communities among districts
- "Bleaching": Reduce minority population in district

### Incumbency Protection

**Definition**: Bipartisan gerrymandering to protect sitting legislators

**How It Works**

- Both parties agree to draw "safe" districts
- Each incumbent gets favorable lines
- Reduces competition for everyone
- Often bipartisan in divided governments

### Prison Gerrymandering

**Definition**: Counting incarcerated people at prison location rather than home address

**Effect**

- Inflates population of prison districts
- Often white, rural districts gain representation
- Urban, minority communities lose representation
- See [Voting Rights](../voting-rights/01-overview.md)

## Framework for Analysis

### Evaluating Districts

**Criteria for Fair Districts**

| Criterion | Definition | Why It Matters |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| **Population equality** | Equal population per district | Constitutional requirement |
| **Compactness** | Geographically coherent | Prevents bizarre shapes |
| **Contiguity** | Connected territory | Basic reasonableness |
| **Preservation of communities** | Keep counties, cities together | Local representation |
| **Competitiveness** | Balanced partisan composition | Accountability |
| **Proportionality** | Seats reflect vote shares | Fair representation |

### Measuring Gerrymandering

**Common Metrics**

| Metric | What It Measures |
|--------|------------------|
| **Efficiency gap** | Wasted votes differential between parties |
| **Mean-median difference** | Skew in district-level vote distribution |
| **Declination** | Asymmetry in how votes translate to seats |
| **Seats-votes curve** | How seat share changes with vote share |
| **Ensemble analysis** | Compare to thousands of computer-drawn maps |

## Why This Matters

### For Democratic Representation

When maps are gerrymandered:

- Majority party can win minority of votes
- Voters in packed/cracked districts are effectively disenfranchised
- Representatives don't reflect community preferences
- Legislative majorities lack democratic legitimacy

### For Political Competition

Gerrymandering creates:

- Safe seats where general election is meaningless
- Primary elections as only real contest
- No accountability to moderate voters
- Incumbents who can't lose

### For Polarization

Safe districts drive extremism:

- Only primary voters matter (more partisan)
- Compromise punished, not rewarded
- Representatives compete to be more extreme
- Bipartisan legislation becomes rarer

### For Civic Engagement

Gerrymandering discourages participation:

- Why vote if outcome predetermined?
- Why run if you can't win?
- Why engage if representatives don't listen?
- Reinforces cynicism about democracy
