# Redistricting: Roadmap

## Strategic Overview

### The 2030 Imperative

The next census (2030) will trigger the next redistricting cycle. This creates both opportunity and urgency:

- Maps drawn after 2030 will last until 2040
- Reforms must be in place before 2030 redistricting begins
- 2028 is the latest practical deadline for most states
- Work must begin now for 2030 success

### Theory of Change

   Public support    Political power    Legal victories    Fair maps

### Pathways to Reform

| Pathway | Timeline | Difficulty | Permanence |
|---------|----------|------------|------------|
| Ballot initiative | 2-4 years | Medium | High (constitutional) |
| Legislative action | 2-6 years | High | Medium (can be repealed) |
| Court intervention | 1-5 years | Variable | Medium (depends on court) |
| Federal legislation | Unknown | Very high | High (but limited scope) |

## Phase 1: Immediate Actions (Now - Year 1)

### Assessment and Planning

**Know Your State**

| Task | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Research current redistricting process | Understand what needs changing |
| Identify legal pathways | Ballot initiative vs. legislative |
| Map existing reform groups | Don't duplicate efforts |
| Assess political landscape | Where are allies and opponents? |

**State Assessment Checklist**

- [ ] Who currently draws maps?
- [ ] Does state have ballot initiative process?
- [ ] What does state constitution say about redistricting?
- [ ] What reform organizations are active?
- [ ] What is judicial posture toward redistricting?
- [ ] What political opportunities exist?

### Federal Legislation Push

**Congressional Strategy**

| Action | Timeline |
|--------|----------|
| Build support for federal standards | Ongoing |
| Demonstrate state-level success | Years 1-5 |
| Pressure Senate on filibuster | As opportunity allows |
| Position for future Democratic trifecta | Election cycles |

**Realistic Assessment**

- Focus on state-level progress
- Federal success creates national standard
- Keep federal advocacy as long-term goal

### 2030 Census Preparation
