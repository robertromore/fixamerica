# Redistricting: History

## Origins

### The Birth of the Gerrymander (1812)

The term "gerrymander" was coined in 1812 when Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry signed a redistricting bill that created a bizarrely shaped district favoring his Democratic-Republican Party.

**The Story**

- Massachusetts legislature drew state senate districts
- One district in Essex County resembled a salamander
- Boston Gazette published cartoon calling it a "Gerry-mander"
- Term entered American political vocabulary

**The Irony**

- Gerry himself didn't design the map
- He expressed reservations about signing it
- His party lost the next election anyway
- But his name became synonymous with the practice

### Constitutional Foundation

**What the Constitution Says**

- Article I, Section 4: States set "Times, Places and Manner" of elections
- Congress can "make or alter such Regulations"
- No explicit requirements for district shapes or fairness
- Left enormous discretion to states

**Early Practice**

- Single-member districts not required initially
- Some states used at-large elections
- Multi-member districts existed
- Gerrymandering possible from the start

## Key Turning Points

### 1842: Single-Member District Requirement

**The Change**

- Congress required single-member districts for House
- States had used various methods
- Standardized district-based representation

**Effect**

- Made gerrymandering more systematic
- Each district must be drawn somewhere
- Boundary manipulation became the game

### 1901: Apportionment Act

**The Law**

- Required districts be "compact" and of "contiguous territory"
- First federal standards for district shape
- Attempted to limit bizarre boundaries

**Limitations**

- No enforcement mechanism
- Requirements dropped in 1929
- Compactness standard effectively abandoned

### 1929: Permanent Apportionment Act

**The Change**

- Fixed House size at 435
- Made apportionment automatic after each census
- Removed compactness requirements from federal law

**Effect**

- States had free hand on redistricting
- No federal constraints on gerrymandering
- Set stage for worst abuses

### 1962: Baker v. Carr - Courts Can Hear Cases

**The Case**

- Tennessee hadn't redistricted since 1901
- Rural districts vastly overrepresented
- Urban areas dramatically underrepresented
- Plaintiffs argued equal protection violation

**The Ruling**

- Redistricting is justiciable (courts can decide)
- "Political question" doctrine doesn't bar all cases
- Opened courthouse door to redistricting claims

**Significance**

- Before Baker, courts refused to hear redistricting cases
- After Baker, federal courts became key venue
- Foundation for "one person, one vote"

### 1964: Reynolds v. Sims - One Person, One Vote

**The Case**

- Alabama legislative districts wildly unequal
- Some districts had 40x population of others
- Rural minority controlled state legislature

**The Ruling**

- "Legislators represent people, not trees or acres"
- Districts must be roughly equal in population
- Applies to both houses of state legislatures
- One person, one vote is constitutional requirement

**Effect**

- Ended rural overrepresentation
- Required regular redistricting after each census
- Population equality became paramount criterion
- Didn't address partisan gerrymandering

### 1965: Voting Rights Act

**The Law**

- Section 2: Prohibited voting practices that discriminate
- Section 5: Required "preclearance" in covered jurisdictions
- Applied to redistricting as well as other election rules

**Effect on Redistricting**

- Racial gerrymandering subject to federal review
- DOJ could block discriminatory maps
- Created majority-minority districts
- Didn't address partisan gerrymandering directly

### 1986: Davis v. Bandemer - Partisan Claims Justiciable

**The Case**

- Challenge to Indiana legislative districts
- Alleged partisan gerrymandering
- Democrats won 52% of votes but only 43% of seats

**The Ruling**

- Partisan gerrymandering claims are justiciable
- But very high standard for proving violation
- Plaintiffs in this case lost

**Effect**

- Opened door to partisan gerrymandering claims
- But courts rarely found violations
- No clear standard for what's unconstitutional
- Door open but nearly impossible to walk through

### 2004: Vieth v. Jubelirer - No Manageable Standard

**The Case**

- Challenge to Pennsylvania congressional districts
- Extreme Republican gerrymander alleged

**The Ruling** (Plurality)

- Four justices: Partisan claims nonjusticiable
- Four justices: Claims justiciable
- Kennedy: Justiciable, but no standard yet
- Result: No relief, but door left open

**Significance**

- Courts struggled to find workable standard
- Kennedy's concurrence kept hope alive
- Reformers sought standards courts would accept

### 2013: Shelby County v. Holder - VRA Gutted

**The Case**

- Challenge to Section 5 preclearance formula
- Formula based on historical discrimination patterns

**The Ruling**

- Preclearance formula unconstitutional
- Based on outdated data
- Congress could create new formula (hasn't)

**Effect on Redistricting**

- Covered states no longer need federal approval
- Racial gerrymandering easier without preclearance
- Courts remain venue, but after-the-fact
- Many discriminatory maps followed

### 2019: Rucho v. Common Cause - Door Slams Shut

**The Case**

- Challenges to North Carolina and Maryland gerrymanders
- Clear evidence of partisan intent
- Measurable partisan advantage

**The Ruling** (5-4)

- Partisan gerrymandering claims nonjusticiable
- "Political question" for legislatures, not courts
- No federal constitutional limit on partisan gerrymandering

**Key Quote** (Roberts):
> "Partisan gerrymandering claims present political questions beyond the reach of federal courts."

**Key Quote** (Kagan dissent):
> "For the first time ever, this Court refuses to remedy a constitutional violation because it thinks the task beyond judicial capabilities."

**Effect**

- Closed federal courts to partisan gerrymandering claims
- State courts and constitutions now primary venue
- Reform must come through politics, not federal litigation

## Lessons from the Past

### Lesson 1: Gerrymandering Is as Old as the Republic

- Practice predates the term
- Politicians have always sought electoral advantage
- Not a modern invention or partisan innovation
- Requires constant vigilance to prevent

### Lesson 2: Courts Can Be Venue, But Also Limitations

- Baker v. Carr opened courts
- But courts struggle with standards
- Rucho closed federal courts for partisan claims
- State courts now primary battlefield

### Lesson 3: Standards Matter

- "One person, one vote" succeeded because clear
- Partisan fairness harder to define
- Metrics exist but courts hesitant to adopt
- Reform must include workable standards

### Lesson 4: Technology Amplifies Both Problem and Solution

**Problem Amplified**

- Modern software enables surgical gerrymandering
- Big data allows precise voter targeting
- Computers can generate optimal gerrymanders

**Solution Amplified**

- Same tools can detect gerrymandering
- Algorithmic redistricting possible
- Transparency tools empower citizens
- Ensemble analysis shows what's possible

### Lesson 5: Reform Comes Through Politics

- Federal courts are closed
- Constitutional amendments rare
- Ballot initiatives have succeeded
- State constitutions matter
- Political organizing essential

### Lesson 6: Both Parties Gerrymander When They Can

- Not a one-party problem
- Democrats gerrymander MD, IL, NY
- Republicans gerrymander TX, FL, OH, WI, NC
- Problem is structural, not partisan
- Reform must be bipartisan

### Lesson 7: Citizen Commissions Work

- California: Competitive districts
- Arizona: Generally balanced maps
- Michigan: Much fairer than predecessor
- Iowa: Nonpartisan staff model
- Reform is achievable

## Historical Parallels

### Malapportionment vs. Gerrymandering

| Era | Problem | Solution |
|-----|---------|----------|
| Pre-1960s | Unequal populations | Reynolds v. Sims |
| Today | Partisan manipulation | Independent commissions? |

Both involve manipulation of representation, but different mechanisms and different solutions.

### Civil Rights Parallel

| Era | Voting Problem | Solution |
|-----|----------------|----------|
| 1960s | Racial disenfranchisement | Voting Rights Act |
| Today | Racial gerrymandering | VRA Section 2, state courts |

Racial discrimination in redistricting remains actionable; partisan discrimination is not (in federal courts).
