# Judicial Reform: Overview

## Executive Summary

The federal judiciary, particularly the Supreme Court, faces a crisis of legitimacy. Lifetime appointments, an opaque ethics regime, and increasingly partisan confirmation battles have transformed courts from impartial arbiters into political battlegrounds. The Supreme Court's approval rating has fallen to historic lows, and fundamental questions about judicial power, composition, and accountability remain unanswered.

Judicial reform is essential to restoring public trust in the rule of law and ensuring that courts serve their constitutional function of providing equal justice under law.

## Scope

### What This Topic Covers

- **Supreme Court reform**: Term limits, court size, ethics requirements, jurisdiction
- **Judicial selection**: Confirmation process, qualifications, diversity
- **Lower court reform**: Court structure, judicial emergencies, magistrate system
- **Judicial ethics**: Codes of conduct, recusal standards, financial disclosure
- **Court administration**: Case management, access to justice, transparency
- **Judicial review**: Scope, deference doctrines, constitutional interpretation

### What This Topic Does Not Cover

- Specific case outcomes or legal interpretations
- State court systems (except as models)
- Executive branch legal offices (covered in Executive Reform)
- Criminal justice system operations (covered in Justice)

## Key Questions

1. **Should justices serve for life?** Is lifetime tenure still appropriate, or do term limits better serve democratic accountability?

2. **How many justices should sit on the Supreme Court?** Is nine the right number, or should the Court be expanded or restructured?

3. **What ethics rules should apply to justices?** Should the Supreme Court be bound by the same ethics code as other federal judges?

4. **How should justices be selected?** Can the confirmation process be depoliticized, or is reform needed?

5. **What is the proper scope of judicial review?** How much power should unelected judges have over democratic decisions?

## Why This Matters

### Legitimacy Crisis

Public confidence in the Supreme Court has collapsed:

- Approval rating fell from 62% (2000) to 40% (2023)
- Partisan gap in approval has widened dramatically
- Major decisions seen as political rather than legal
- Accusations of corruption and conflicts of interest

### Democratic Accountability

The judiciary is the least accountable branch:

- Justices serve for life (average tenure now 25+ years)
- No meaningful ethics oversight
- Removal by impeachment nearly impossible
- Selection process increasingly partisan lottery

### Constitutional Stakes

Court decisions shape fundamental rights:

- Abortion, voting rights, gun rights, religious liberty
- Executive power, congressional authority
- Regulatory capacity, administrative state
- Individual rights vs. government power

### Rule of Law

Judicial legitimacy is essential to legal system function:

- Compliance with court orders depends on perceived legitimacy
- Unpopular decisions require public acceptance of judicial role
- Partisan courts undermine equal justice ideal
- International standing depends on judicial independence
