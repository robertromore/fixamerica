## Opposition Arguments

### Against Court Expansion

**"Court-Packing Destroys Independence"**

*Claim*: Adding justices to change outcomes politicizes the Court and destroys its legitimacy.

*Implication*: Expansion would trigger retaliation, leading to ever-larger courts.

*Counter*: Court size has changed before; current size is historical accident, not constitutional mandate.

---

**"FDR Tried and Failed"**

*Claim*: FDR's court-packing plan was rightly rejected as an attack on constitutional structure.

*Implication*: Same arguments apply today.

*Counter*: FDR's plan was personal reaction to rulings against him; current proposals respond to systematic manipulation of appointments.

---

**"Two Wrongs Don't Make a Right"**

*Claim*: Even if McConnell manipulated process, expansion would be equally illegitimate.

*Implication*: Accept current situation rather than escalate.

*Counter*: Accepting manipulation rewards bad behavior and locks in minority rule.

### Against Term Limits

**"Lifetime Tenure Is Constitutional"**

*Claim*: Constitution guarantees judges serve "during good behavior"—i.e., for life.

*Implication*: Term limits require constitutional amendment.

*Counter*: Statutory term limits with senior status may be constitutional; even if amendment needed, worth pursuing.

---

**"Term Limits Politicize Courts"**

*Claim*: Regular appointments increase partisan stakes.

*Implication*: Current random vacancies are preferable.

*Counter*: Predictable appointments reduce desperation around each vacancy; every president gets equal appointments.

---

**"Independence Requires Insulation"**

*Claim*: Term limits make judges think about next job.

*Implication*: Lifetime tenure protects independent judgment.

*Counter*: 18-year terms are plenty long; post-term restrictions can prevent conflicts.

### Against Ethics Reform

**"Separation of Powers"**

*Claim*: Congress cannot regulate Supreme Court without violating separation of powers.

*Implication*: Ethics legislation is unconstitutional.

*Counter*: Congress can regulate judicial ethics under its powers; only removal requires impeachment.

---

**"Justices Can Police Themselves"**

*Claim*: Current self-regulation is adequate; justices are honorable.

*Implication*: External oversight unnecessary.

*Counter*: Recent scandals show self-regulation has failed; no other government official is self-policing.

---

**"Enforcement Impossible"**

*Claim*: Who would enforce ethics rules against Supreme Court justices?

*Implication*: Rules without enforcement are meaningless.

*Counter*: Public disclosure, judicial council review, and consequences (disqualification) can create accountability.

### Against Transparency Reforms

**"Deliberative Secrecy Essential"**

*Claim*: Justices need private deliberation to reach decisions.

*Implication*: Cameras, disclosure requirements would chill deliberation.

*Counter*: Conference secrecy can be preserved while increasing transparency elsewhere (cameras for arguments, better disclosure).

---

**"Media Distortion"**

*Claim*: Cameras would lead to soundbites and misunderstanding.

*Implication*: Audio/transcripts sufficient.

*Counter*: Every other court allows cameras; public has right to see their government.

## Interest Group Opposition

### Business Community

**Concern**: Current Court favorable to business interests

**Argument**: Reforms would lead to less predictable, more regulation-friendly Court

**Tactics**: Quiet opposition; focus on stability messaging

### Religious Conservatives

**Concern**: Current Court expanding religious liberty

**Argument**: Reforms would reverse gains

**Tactics**: Frame reforms as attack on religious freedom

### Gun Rights Organizations

**Concern**: Current Court expanding Second Amendment

**Argument**: Reforms threaten gun rights

**Tactics**: Mobilize members against reform proposals

### Anti-Abortion Movement

**Concern**: *Dobbs* achieved 50-year goal

**Argument**: Reforms would restore *Roe*

**Tactics**: Frame reform as abortion extremism
