# Judicial Reform: History

## Constitutional Design

### The Founding Debates

The framers created an independent judiciary but debated its structure:

**Federalists** (Hamilton, Federalist 78-83):

- Judiciary is "least dangerous branch"
- Life tenure ensures independence from political pressure
- Judicial review implied (later established in *Marbury*)
- Courts check legislative and executive excess

**Anti-Federalists**:

- Feared unaccountable judicial aristocracy
- Worried about federal court supremacy over states
- Predicted judges would expand their own power
- Sought term limits and easier removal

### Original Design

The Constitution provided minimal detail:

- "One Supreme Court" (size unspecified)
- "Inferior courts" as Congress sees fit
- Judges hold office "during good behavior"
- Jurisdiction specified but Congress can limit
- Impeachment as only removal mechanism

## Early Republic (1789-1860)

### The Judiciary Act of 1789

First Congress established:

- Supreme Court with 6 justices
- 13 district courts
- 3 circuit courts (Supreme Court justices riding circuit)
- Federal question and diversity jurisdiction

### Marbury v. Madison (1803)

Chief Justice Marshall established judicial review:

- Courts can strike down laws as unconstitutional
- Supreme Court is ultimate constitutional arbiter
- Power claimed, not explicitly granted by Constitution
- Foundation of judicial supremacy

### Early Court Changes

Congress changed Court size repeatedly:

| Year | Size | Reason |
|------|------|--------|
| 1789 | 6 | Original |
| 1801 | 5 | Reduce (Federalist effort to prevent Jefferson appointment) |
| 1802 | 6 | Restored by Jefferson |
| 1807 | 7 | Western expansion |
| 1837 | 9 | Additional circuits |
| 1863 | 10 | Civil War (Lincoln) |
| 1866 | 7 | Prevent Johnson appointments |
| 1869 | 9 | Grant's appointments |

### Marshall Court (1801-1835)

John Marshall shaped judicial power:

- *Marbury v. Madison*: Judicial review
- *McCulloch v. Maryland*: Federal supremacy, implied powers
- *Gibbons v. Ogden*: Broad commerce power
- Established Court as co-equal branch

### Taney Court and Dred Scott (1857)

*Dred Scott v. Sandford* demonstrated judicial overreach:

- Struck down Missouri Compromise
- Denied citizenship to African Americans
- Inflamed sectional conflict
- Discredited for generations

## Reconstruction to New Deal (1865-1937)

### Post-Civil War Amendments

Reconstruction amendments transformed constitutional law:

- 13th Amendment: Abolished slavery
- 14th Amendment: Due process, equal protection
- 15th Amendment: Voting rights

But Court narrowed their scope:

- *Slaughterhouse Cases* (1873): Limited privileges and immunities
- *Civil Rights Cases* (1883): Limited congressional enforcement power
- *Plessy v. Ferguson* (1896): "Separate but equal"

### The Lochner Era (1897-1937)

Court struck down economic regulations:

- *Lochner v. New York* (1905): Invalidated labor laws
- "Liberty of contract" doctrine
- Hundreds of state and federal laws struck down
- Court seen as protecting business against workers

### FDR's Court-Packing Plan (1937)

After Court struck down New Deal programs, Roosevelt proposed:

- Adding one justice for each over age 70
- Would have added 6 justices immediately
- Plan failed in Congress
- But Court shifted ("switch in time that saved nine")

**Lasting Impact**:

- Court-packing seen as threatening judicial independence
- But demonstrated Court responds to political pressure
- Established norm of 9 justices (but no law)
- Began modern deference to economic regulation

## Post-New Deal to Warren Court (1937-1969)

### The Rights Revolution

Warren Court (1953-1969) transformed constitutional law:

| Case | Year | Holding |
|------|------|---------|
| *Brown v. Board of Education* | 1954 | School segregation unconstitutional |
| *Mapp v. Ohio* | 1961 | Exclusionary rule applies to states |
| *Gideon v. Wainwright* | 1963 | Right to counsel in criminal cases |
| *Reynolds v. Sims* | 1964 | One person, one vote |
| *Miranda v. Arizona* | 1966 | Miranda warnings required |

### Backlash

Conservative reaction to Warren Court:

- "Impeach Earl Warren" campaign
- Nixon's "strict constructionist" appointments
- Beginning of judicial appointments as partisan issue
- Rise of originalism as counter-doctrine

## Burger and Rehnquist Courts (1969-2005)

### Nixon Appointments

Nixon appointed four justices, shifting Court right:

- Warren Burger (Chief Justice)
- Harry Blackmun
- Lewis Powell
- William Rehnquist

### Roe v. Wade (1973)

Landmark abortion rights decision:

- 7-2 majority including Nixon appointees
- Established constitutional right to abortion
- Became central to judicial politics for 50 years
- Eventually overturned in 2022

### Bork and the Confirmation Wars

Robert Bork nomination (1987) transformed confirmations:

- First nominee subjected to extensive ideological questioning
- Defeated 42-58 after contentious hearings
- "Borking" entered political vocabulary
- Nominees learned to say little

### Rehnquist Court

William Rehnquist as Chief Justice (1986-2005):

- Federalism revival (limiting commerce power)
- *Bush v. Gore* (2000): Intervened in presidential election
- Modest conservative shift
- Some liberal holdings (*Lawrence v. Texas*, gay rights)

## Roberts Court (2005-Present)

### Conservative Consolidation

Roberts Court has moved steadily right:

**Campaign Finance**:

- *Citizens United v. FEC* (2010): Corporate speech protected
- *McCutcheon v. FEC* (2014): Aggregate limits struck down

**Voting Rights**:

- *Shelby County v. Holder* (2013): Gutted Voting Rights Act
- *Brnovich v. DNC* (2021): Narrowed Section 2

**Religion**:

- *Espinoza v. Montana* (2020): Required funding of religious schools
- *Kennedy v. Bremerton* (2022): Public school prayer protected

**Executive Power**:

- *Trump v. United States* (2024): Broad presidential immunity

### Trump Appointments

Three appointments in four years transformed Court:

- Neil Gorsuch (2017): Replaced Scalia after Garland blocked
- Brett Kavanaugh (2018): Replaced Kennedy swing vote
- Amy Coney Barrett (2020): Replaced Ginsburg days before election

### Dobbs and Beyond

*Dobbs v. Jackson* (2022) signaled new era:

- Overturned *Roe v. Wade* after 49 years
- Demonstrated willingness to overturn precedent
- Sharply polarized public opinion
- Raised questions about legitimacy

## Historical Patterns

### Court Size Changes

Congress has changed Court size seven times:

- Always for political reasons
- No constitutional obstacle
- Nine became norm only after 1869
- Court-packing proposals have failed

### Confirmation Evolution

| Era | Typical Vote | Process |
|-----|--------------|---------|
| 1789-1900 | Near-unanimous | Quick, minimal hearings |
| 1900-1955 | Large majority | Brief hearings |
| 1955-1987 | Bipartisan majority | Substantive hearings |
| 1987-present | Partisan | Contentious, extensive |

### Reform Attempts

Previous reform efforts:

| Proposal | Year | Outcome |
|----------|------|---------|
| FDR court-packing | 1937 | Failed |
| Jenner-Butler bill (jurisdiction stripping) | 1958 | Failed |
| Term limits proposals | Various | Failed |
| Ethics legislation | Various | Partial success |
| Court expansion proposals | 2021 | Pending |

## Lessons from History

### What's Changed

- Court size: Not fixed; Congress can change
- Lifetime tenure: Unprecedented lengths now
- Confirmation process: Transformed from collegial to warfare
- Public salience: Court decisions now major political issues

### What's Stayed the Same

- Partisan motivations in appointments
- Court responds (eventually) to public pressure
- Legitimacy depends on perception of fairness
- Structural reforms face high barriers

### Historical Precedents for Reform

- Congress has successfully changed Court size
- Court has reversed itself after political pressure
- Major decisions have been overturned
- Norms are not laws and can change
