# Judicial Reform: Current State

## Supreme Court Composition

### Current Justices (as of Jan 2026)

| Justice | Appointed By | Year | Age | Tenure |
|---------|--------------|------|-----|--------|
| John Roberts (Chief) | G.W. Bush | 2005 | 70 | 20 years |
| Clarence Thomas | G.H.W. Bush | 1991 | 77 | 34 years |
| Samuel Alito | G.W. Bush | 2006 | 75 | 20 years |
| Sonia Sotomayor | Obama | 2009 | 71 | 17 years |
| Elena Kagan | Obama | 2010 | 65 | 16 years |
| Neil Gorsuch | Trump | 2017 | 58 | 9 years |
| Brett Kavanaugh | Trump | 2018 | 60 | 8 years |
| Amy Coney Barrett | Trump | 2020 | 53 | 6 years |
| Ketanji Brown Jackson | Biden | 2022 | 55 | 4 years |

### Ideological Balance

- 6 justices appointed by Republican presidents
- 3 justices appointed by Democratic presidents
- Clear 6-3 conservative majority on most issues
- Some variation on specific issues (Roberts, Gorsuch occasionally join liberals)

### Tenure Trends

Average tenure has increased dramatically:

| Era | Average Tenure |
|-----|----------------|
| 1789-1900 | 15 years |
| 1900-1970 | 15 years |
| 1970-2000 | 22 years |
| 2000-present | 25+ years (projected) |

Longer tenures result from:

- Appointment of younger justices
- Improved healthcare and longevity
- Strategic retirement timing
- High stakes of each vacancy

## Confirmation Process

### Recent Confirmations

| Nominee | Year | Senate Vote | Days from Nomination |
|---------|------|-------------|---------------------|
| Ketanji Brown Jackson | 2022 | 53-47 | 45 |
| Amy Coney Barrett | 2020 | 52-48 | 30 |
| Brett Kavanaugh | 2018 | 50-48 | 89 |
| Neil Gorsuch | 2017 | 54-45 | 66 |
| Merrick Garland | 2016 | No vote | 293 (no hearing) |
| Elena Kagan | 2010 | 63-37 | 87 |
| Sonia Sotomayor | 2009 | 68-31 | 72 |

### Partisan Deterioration

The confirmation process has become increasingly partisan:

- Last justice confirmed with 90+ votes: Anthony Kennedy (1988)
- Last justice confirmed with 70+ votes: Stephen Breyer (1994)
- Recent confirmations decided along party lines
- Filibuster eliminated for Supreme Court nominees (2017)

### Merrick Garland Precedent

The refusal to consider Merrick Garland's nomination established:

- No obligation to hold hearings on nominations
- Senate majority controls whether vacancy is filled
- Rules can change based on partisan advantage
- Precedent easily reversed (Barrett confirmation 2020)

## Judicial Ethics

### Current Framework

**Lower Federal Courts**:

- Bound by Code of Conduct for United States Judges
- Financial disclosure requirements
- Recusal governed by 28 U.S.C. § 455
- Complaints investigated by judicial councils

**Supreme Court**:

- Not bound by any code of conduct (until 2023)
- Self-policing on recusal
- Financial disclosure but limited enforcement
- No mechanism for ethics complaints

### 2023 Ethics Code

In November 2023, the Court adopted its first code of conduct:

- Largely restates existing law
- No enforcement mechanism
- Justices decide their own recusal
- Critics call it inadequate

### Recent Ethics Controversies

| Justice | Issue | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Thomas | Undisclosed gifts from Harlan Crow | No recusal, limited disclosure |
| Thomas | Wife's January 6 involvement | No recusal from related cases |
| Alito | Undisclosed luxury travel | No recusal |
| Alito | Partisan flags at residences | No recusal from January 6 cases |
| Roberts | Wife's legal recruiting income | Disclosed but questions raised |
| Gorsuch | Property sale to law firm head | Disclosed after reporting |

### Recusal Standards

Current recusal practice:

- Each justice decides individually
- No appeal of recusal decisions
- No explanation required
- Standards vaguely defined
- Spouse activities rarely trigger recusal

## Lower Federal Courts

### Court Structure

| Court Level | Number | Judges |
|-------------|--------|--------|
| Supreme Court | 1 | 9 |
| Courts of Appeals | 13 | 179 |
| District Courts | 94 | 677 |
| Bankruptcy Courts | 90 | 350 |
| Other Article I Courts | Various | Various |

### Judicial Vacancies

Vacancy rates fluctuate with political control:

- High vacancies during divided government
- Rapid filling when same party controls Senate and White House
- "Judicial emergencies" declared when vacancies create backlogs
- Some districts chronically understaffed

### Caseload Crisis

Federal courts face increasing caseloads:

- District court filings: ~400,000 annually
- Appeals court filings: ~50,000 annually
- Judge-to-case ratios strained
- Time to disposition increasing

### Magistrate Judges

Magistrate judges handle significant caseload:

- Appointed by district judges, not president
- 8-year terms, renewable
- Handle pretrial matters, some trials by consent
- Reduce Article III judge workload

## Judicial Selection
