# Judicial Reform: Solutions

## Framework for Reform

Effective judicial reform must:

1. **Restore legitimacy** by addressing perception of partisan capture
2. **Increase accountability** without compromising judicial independence
3. **Create predictability** in appointments and tenure
4. **Improve ethics** through enforceable standards
5. **Survive legal challenges** (statutory reforms may face constitutional questions)

## Supreme Court Term Limits

### Problem

Lifetime tenure creates unpredictable vacancies, strategic retirements, and justices serving 30+ years.

### Solution: 18-Year Terms

**Structure**:

- Each justice serves one 18-year term
- Staggered terms: one vacancy every 2 years
- Each president gets 2 appointments per 4-year term
- After term, justices assume senior status on lower courts

**Implementation**:

- Apply to new appointees (current justices grandfathered)
- Transition period until regular cycle established
- Constitutional amendment preferred; statutory version possible

**Benefits**:

- Predictable turnover reduces stakes of each vacancy
- Equal appointments across presidents
- Prevents multi-decade ideological entrenchment
- Aligns with international norms

### Alternative: 18-Year Terms with Lottery

**Variation**:

- All former justices form pool
- Nine randomly selected for each case or term
- Reduces power of any individual justice
- More complex implementation

## Supreme Court Ethics Reform

### Problem

Supreme Court justices operate under no binding ethics code with no enforcement mechanism.

### Solutions

**Binding Code of Conduct**:

- Apply Code of Conduct for U.S. Judges to Supreme Court
- Make compliance mandatory, not advisory
- Create enforcement mechanism

**Recusal Standards**:

- Clear, mandatory recusal rules
- Financial interests
- Family interests
- Prior involvement in matter
- Review of recusal decisions by other justices or panel

**Financial Disclosure**:

- Real-time disclosure of gifts over $50
- Detailed reporting of all income sources
- Spousal disclosure requirements
- Public database of all disclosures

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- Judicial council review of ethics complaints
- Consequences for violations (public censure, case disqualification)
- Referral to DOJ for serious violations

## Supreme Court Expansion

### Problem

Current 6-3 conservative majority resulted partly from Senate manipulation (Garland blockade, Barrett rush).

### Solution: Add Justices

**Options**:

| New Size | Justices Added | Effect |
|----------|----------------|--------|
| 11 | 2 | 6-5 conservative |
| 13 | 4 | 6-7 liberal majority |
| 15 | 6 | Depends on appointments |

**Arguments For**:

- Remedies manipulation
- Court size is not constitutionally fixed
- Congress has changed size 7 times
- Larger courts common internationally

**Arguments Against**:

- Risks retaliation cycle
- Court-packing stigma from 1937
- May further delegitimize Court

**Safeguards**:

- Combine with term limits to prevent future manipulation
- Require supermajority for future size changes
- Phase in new seats over multiple administrations

### Alternative: Balanced Court

**Structure** (Epps-Sitaraman Proposal):

- 5 justices affiliated with each major party
- 5 justices selected by those 10 (unanimous or supermajority)
- Creates moderate center
- Reduces partisan stakes

**Challenges**:

- Formally recognizes partisanship
- Selection of middle 5 may deadlock
- May require constitutional amendment

## Transparency and Access

### Problem

Supreme Court operates with minimal transparency compared to other government institutions.

### Solutions

**Cameras in the Courtroom**:

- Allow video recording of oral arguments
- Live streaming of arguments
- Archive for public access
- Precedent: Congress, state supreme courts

**Improved Disclosure**:

- Same-day release of all orders
- Better explanation of shadow docket decisions
- Disclosure of all communications regarding pending cases
- Public log of meetings with outside parties

**Conference Transparency**:

- Summary disclosure of conference discussions (delayed)
- Historical records released after reasonable period
- Document preservation requirements

## Lower Court Reform

### Problem

Lower federal courts face vacancies, caseload pressures, and diversity gaps.

### Solutions

**Expand Lower Courts**:

- Add judgeships to address caseload
- Create new circuits if needed
- Increase magistrate judge positions
- Reduce reliance on senior judges

**Improve Diversity**:

- Broaden recruitment beyond elite law schools
- Consider public defenders, civil rights lawyers
- Geographic diversity
- Professional background diversity

**Streamline Confirmation**:

- Reduce number of positions requiring confirmation
- Time limits on committee consideration
- End blue slip tradition for obstruction
- Maintain quality vetting

**Address Judicial Emergencies**:

- Define clear standards for declaring emergencies
- Automatic procedures to fill vacancies
- Temporary judges from other districts

## Confirmation Process Reform

### Problem

Confirmation has become partisan warfare with unpredictable outcomes.

### Solutions

**Guaranteed Consideration**:

- Require hearings within 60 days of nomination
- Require floor vote within 120 days
- End indefinite delays

**Qualifications Commission**:

- Independent body vets qualifications (not ideology)
- Nonpartisan professional assessment
- Similar to state judicial selection commissions
- Recommendation informs but doesn't bind

**Supermajority Confirmation**:

- Require 60 votes for Supreme Court confirmation
- Forces consensus candidates
- May lead to more moderate appointments
- Risk: could lead to vacancies if parties won't compromise

## Jurisdiction Reform

### Problem

Court can strike down legislation; Congress has limited tools to respond.

### Solutions

**Jurisdiction Stripping** (Controversial):

- Congress can limit Court's appellate jurisdiction
- Could remove certain issues from review
- Constitutional but risks creating lawless zones
- Use sparingly and carefully

**Supermajority to Strike Laws**:

- Require 6-3 or 7-2 vote to invalidate federal law
- Ensures broad consensus before overriding democracy
- May require constitutional amendment

**Congressional Override**:

- Allow Congress to override constitutional rulings by supermajority
- Similar to Canadian "notwithstanding clause"
- Controversial; changes balance of power
- Would require constitutional amendment

## Implementation Priority

| Reform | Impact | Feasibility | Priority |
|--------|--------|-------------|----------|
| Ethics code and enforcement | Moderate | High | 1 |
| Transparency (cameras, disclosure) | Moderate | High | 2 |
| Lower court expansion | Moderate | Moderate | 3 |
| Term limits (constitutional) | High | Low | 4 |
| Term limits (statutory) | High | Moderate | 5 |
| Court expansion | High | Low | 6 |
| Confirmation reform | Moderate | Moderate | 7 |
| Jurisdiction reform | High | Very Low | 8 |

## State Models

Several states have implemented reforms that could inform federal changes:

**Term Limits**:

- Many state supreme courts have terms or mandatory retirement
- Rhode Island: 10-year terms
- California: 12-year terms
- Most states: mandatory retirement at 70-75

**Ethics Enforcement**:

- State judicial conduct commissions investigate complaints
- Discipline ranges from censure to removal
- Public accountability

**Selection Methods**:

- Missouri Plan (merit selection): Nominating commission + gubernatorial appointment + retention elections
- Reduces partisan influence while maintaining accountability
