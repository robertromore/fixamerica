# Judicial Reform: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Judicial reform legislation ranges from clearly constitutional ethics requirements to structurally transformative proposals that may require constitutional amendments. This document provides draft text for ethics enforcement, term limits, court expansion, and transparency requirements, along with analysis of constitutional issues and potential challenges.

## Constitutional Amendments

### Supreme Court Term Limits Amendment

**Purpose**: Replace lifetime tenure with 18-year terms to create predictable turnover and reduce stakes of each vacancy.

**Draft Text**:

```text
Section 1. The term of office of each Justice of the Supreme
Court shall be 18 years. No Justice may be reappointed to the
Supreme Court after completing a full term.

Section 2. The terms of Justices shall be staggered such that
one term expires every two years. The Chief Justice shall be
designated by the President from among the sitting Justices
for a term of six years.

Section 3. Upon completion of a full term, a Justice shall
assume senior status and may be assigned by the Chief Justice
to serve on any court of appeals or district court of the
United States.

Section 4. If a vacancy occurs before the expiration of a
term, the President shall nominate a successor within 90 days.
If the Senate does not act on the nomination within 120 days,
the nominee shall be deemed confirmed.

Section 5. This article shall take effect five years after
ratification. Justices serving at the time of ratification
shall be grandfathered and may serve until death, retirement,
or impeachment, but for purposes of staggering future terms,
their seats shall be numbered in order of their appointment
date.

Section 6. Congress shall have power to enforce this article
by appropriate legislation.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 1**: 18-year terms allow substantial tenure while ensuring regular turnover
- **Section 2**: Staggered terms ensure each 4-year presidency gets 2 appointments
- **Section 3**: Senior status allows continued judicial service without life tenure on Supreme Court
- **Section 4**: Prevents indefinite vacancy manipulation; deemed confirmation is controversial but addresses obstruction
- **Section 5**: Transition period and grandfathering respects current justices' expectations

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Ratification difficulty | Long-term campaign; 70%+ public support for term limits |
| Transition complexity | 5-year implementation; detailed regulations |
| Deemed confirmation controversial | Alternative: Chief Justice appoints if Senate fails |

### Judicial Ethics Amendment

**Purpose**: Establish that Congress may regulate judicial ethics, including for Supreme Court.

**Draft Text**:

```text
Section 1. Congress shall have power to establish and enforce
codes of conduct for all judges of courts established under
this Constitution, including the Supreme Court.

Section 2. Congress may establish an independent body to
receive and investigate complaints of judicial misconduct and
to recommend appropriate sanctions.

Section 3. Nothing in this article shall be construed to permit
removal of a judge except by impeachment as provided in this
Constitution.
```

**Explanation**: This brief amendment would definitively resolve questions about congressional authority to regulate Supreme Court ethics.

## Federal Legislation

### Supreme Court Ethics, Recusal, and Transparency Act

**Purpose**: Apply binding ethics standards to Supreme Court justices with enforcement mechanisms.

```

### Supreme Court Term Limits and Regular Appointments Act

**Purpose**: Implement term limits by statute, to take effect if constitutional amendment is not ratified.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Supreme Court Term Limits
and Regular Appointments Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The Constitution provides that judges hold office during
    "good Behaviour" but does not define the tenure of
    Supreme Court service.
(2) Congress has authority under Article III to structure
    the Supreme Court.
(3) Term limits with senior status satisfy constitutional
    requirements while promoting regular turnover.
(4) Regular appointments reduce partisan stakes of vacancies.

SEC. 3. TERM OF ACTIVE SERVICE.

(a) TERM.—The term of active service on the Supreme Court for
    each Justice appointed after the effective date shall be
    18 years.

(b) STAGGERING.—Terms shall be staggered so that one term
    expires in the first and third years of each presidential
    term.

(c) TRANSITION.—
    (1) Justices serving on the effective date shall continue
        in active service.
    (2) As sitting Justices retire or leave service, new
        appointments shall fill the 18-year term slots in
        sequence.
    (3) The transition to regular staggered terms shall be
        completed when all sitting pre-enactment Justices have
        left active service.

SEC. 4. SENIOR STATUS.

(a) Upon completion of a term of active service, a Justice
    shall assume senior status.

(b) A senior Justice:
    (1) Shall retain the title of Justice;
    (2) Shall retain the salary of an active Justice;
    (3) May be assigned by the Chief Justice to sit on any
        circuit court or district court;
    (4) May not participate in Supreme Court cases except as
        provided in subsection (c).

(c) If the Supreme Court lacks a quorum due to recusals, the
    Chief Justice may designate one or more senior Justices
    to participate in the case to achieve a quorum.

SEC. 5. REGULAR APPOINTMENTS.

(a) NOMINATION.—In the first year of each Congress, the
    President shall nominate a Justice to fill the seat whose
    18-year term expires in that Congress.

(b) TIMING.—The President shall submit the nomination within
    90 days of taking office or within 90 days of a scheduled
    term expiration.

(c) VACANCY.—If a vacancy occurs before the scheduled term
    expiration due to death, resignation, or removal, the
    President shall nominate a replacement within 90 days.
    The replacement shall serve only the remainder of the term.

SEC. 6. SENATE CONSIDERATION.

(a) The Senate Judiciary Committee shall hold a hearing on any
    nomination within 60 days of receipt.

(b) The Committee shall report the nomination to the full
    Senate within 90 days.

(c) The Senate shall vote on the nomination within 120 days
    of receipt.

SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.

(a) This Act takes effect for appointments made after
    January 20 following enactment.

(b) The first regularly scheduled appointment under this Act
    shall occur in the year [first odd year after enactment].
```

**Constitutional Note**: This statutory approach faces uncertain constitutional status. The argument for constitutionality:

- "Good behaviour" tenure is satisfied because justices retain salary and judicial role
- Congress has broad authority over court structure
- Only impeachment removes from judicial office, but assignment to active Supreme Court service is regulable

### Judiciary Act Amendments (Court Expansion)

**Purpose**: Add seats to the Supreme Court (various options).

**Draft Text** (13-Justice Version):

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Judiciary Act of [Year]".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The number of Supreme Court Justices is not fixed by
    the Constitution and has been changed seven times.
(2) The current size of nine Justices was set in 1869.
(3) The federal caseload has increased dramatically since 1869.
(4) A larger Court would better represent the diversity of
    American legal thought.

SEC. 3. NUMBER OF JUSTICES.

Section 1 of title 28, United States Code, is amended by
striking "nine" and inserting "thirteen".

SEC. 4. APPOINTMENTS.

(a) The four additional seats shall be filled by presidential
    nomination and Senate confirmation.

(b) No more than two additional Justices shall be appointed
    in any calendar year.

SEC. 5. FUTURE CHANGES.

(a) After the effective date of this Act, any legislation to
    change the number of Justices shall require a two-thirds
    vote in each chamber of Congress.

SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act takes effect on January 20 following enactment.
```

### Cameras in the Courtroom Act

**Purpose**: Require video coverage of Supreme Court proceedings.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Cameras in the Courtroom Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The Supreme Court is the only appellate court in the
    nation that prohibits cameras.
(2) Public understanding of the Court would be enhanced by
    visual access.
(3) State supreme courts and Congress permit cameras without
    negative effects.
(4) Transparency strengthens democratic accountability.

SEC. 3. TELEVISION COVERAGE.

(a) The Supreme Court shall permit television coverage of all
    open sessions of the Court.

(b) The Court shall provide a live video feed of oral arguments
    and opinion announcements.

(c) The Court shall archive all video recordings and make them
    publicly available.

SEC. 4. ADMINISTRATION.

    camera placement and operation.

(b) The Court may not prohibit cameras except for specific
    compelling reasons stated on the record.

SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act takes effect for the Supreme Court term beginning
after enactment.
```

```

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Article III Tenure**:

- "Good Behaviour" language interpreted as life tenure
- But term limits with continued judicial service may satisfy
- Congress has changed court structure before
- Untested question; Supreme Court would decide own tenure

**Congressional Authority**:

| Power | Basis | Scope |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Court size | Necessary and Proper; historical practice | Clear authority |
| Ethics regulation | Necessary and Proper | Strong but untested for Supreme Court |
| Term limits | Uncertain | May require amendment |
| Jurisdiction | Article III, Section 2 | Can limit appellate jurisdiction |

**Separation of Powers**:

- Congress cannot remove judges except by impeachment
- But can Congress define "active service" vs. "senior status"?
- Ethics enforcement that doesn't involve removal is likely valid

### Enforcement Mechanisms

| Reform | Enforcement |
|--------|-------------|
| Ethics code | Judicial panel review; public censure; congressional referral |
| Disclosure | Public database; penalty for non-compliance |
| Recusal | Other justices decide; public statement required |
| Term limits | Automatic by statute; constitutional if amendment |
| Cameras | Mandatory by statute |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Supreme Court Ethics, Recusal, and Transparency Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Self-judging on recusal | Other justices may not seriously review colleagues' recusal decisions | Critical |
| Gift valuation manipulation | Gifts may be undervalued to fall below disclosure thresholds | High |
| Panel enforcement limits | Circuit chief panel can only censure and recommend; no binding power | High |
| Retroactive disclosure evasion | Justices may claim inability to recall or document past gifts | Medium |
| Teaching compensation cap | $25,000 may still create influence; inflation erodes cap | Medium |
| Family member gifts | Gifts to family members may circumvent justice-focused rules | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| No removal authority | Serious violations have no consequence beyond censure | Constitutional impeachment requirement |
| Supreme Court decides own constitutionality | Court could strike down ethics law | Judicial review |
| Voluntary compliance culture | Justices may view themselves as above regulation | Institutional culture |
| Political enforcement | Congressional referral is political, not legal process | Constitutional structure |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Strengthen recusal review**: Require panel of retired justices or federal judges to review recusal motions
2. **Gift valuation standards**: Establish objective valuation methodology; third-party appraisal for high-value items
3. **Enforcement escalation**: Create graduated consequences; automatic case disqualification for repeated violations
4. **Family member extension**: Apply disclosure requirements to spouse and dependent children's gifts
5. **Inflation adjustment**: Automatic annual adjustment of dollar thresholds

### Supreme Court Term Limits Act (Statutory Version)

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Constitutional challenge | Current justices would decide constitutionality of their own term limits | Critical |
| Transition gaming | Sitting justices may time retirements to maximize partisan advantage | High |
| Senior status manipulation | Senior justices called back frequently could effectively continue serving | High |
| Senate obstruction continuation | 120-day deadline has no enforcement mechanism | Medium |
| Vacancy exploitation | President may delay nominations strategically | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Constitutional uncertainty | May be struck down as violating "good behaviour" tenure | Constitutional interpretation |
| Applies only prospectively | Current imbalance continues through transition | Political necessity |
| No deemed confirmation | Original proposal has Senate deadlines but no automatic confirmation | Separation of powers |
| Partial solution | Doesn't address past manipulation (Garland/Barrett) | Prospective only |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Constitutional amendment backup**: Simultaneously pursue amendment to ensure durability
2. **Transition incentives**: Provide enhanced retirement benefits for justices who retire on schedule
3. **Senior status limits**: Cap senior justice Supreme Court participation at 2 cases per term
4. **Senate enforcement**: Automatic discharge from committee if deadline missed
5. **Nominee preparation**: Require presidents to have successor nominations ready in advance

### Judiciary Act Amendments (Court Expansion)

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Retaliation cycle | Future majority may add more justices; no stable endpoint | Critical |
| Supermajority evasion | Future Congress could repeal supermajority requirement by simple majority | High |
| Staggered appointment gaming | Two-per-year limit may be changed by future legislation | Medium |
| Immediate partisan capture | All new seats filled by one administration | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Legitimacy concerns | Public may view expansion as partisan court-packing | Political perception |
| Doesn't prevent future manipulation | Underlying problems (lifetime tenure, confirmation wars) remain | Symptom not cause |
| FDR precedent | Historical failure provides ammunition for opponents | Political history |
| May delegitimize Court further | Short-term gain may cause long-term institutional damage | Unintended consequences |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Combine with term limits**: Expansion more palatable if combined with structural reform preventing future manipulation
2. **Constitutional supermajority**: Pursue constitutional amendment requiring supermajority for size changes
3. **Phased implementation**: Extend new appointments over multiple administrations
4. **Bipartisan appointment requirement**: Require some appointments be made with minority party consultation
5. **Automatic reversion**: Include sunset requiring reauthorization after 10 years

### Cameras in the Courtroom Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| "Compelling reasons" exception | Court may find compelling reasons frequently | High |
| Regulation manipulation | Court regulations could make camera coverage impractical | Medium |
| Conference exclusion | Statute doesn't cover private conferences where decisions made | Medium |
| Archive delay | No timeline specified for public availability | Low |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Doesn't address deliberations | Public still cannot see how decisions are actually made | Privacy for deliberation |
| May change behavior | Justices may perform for cameras rather than engage | Human nature |
| Limited to oral argument | Much Court work happens in briefs and chambers | Scope limitation |
| Court resistance | May be implemented minimally in spirit of defiance | Institutional opposition |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Narrow compelling reasons**: Define "compelling reasons" exhaustively in statute
2. **Regulatory review**: Require GAO review of camera regulations for compliance with statutory intent
3. **Archive timeline**: Require same-day availability of recordings
4. **Expanded transparency**: Consider delayed release of conference transcripts (after case resolved)

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| Supreme Court self-interest | Independent review panel for constitutionality; state court test cases first |
| Partisan implementation | Build bipartisan coalitions; frame as institutional |
| Enforcement gap | Create automatic mechanisms not dependent on voluntary compliance |
| Public legitimacy | Extensive public education; demonstrate broad support |
| Norm restoration | Codify informal expectations as binding requirements |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

All judicial reform legislation should include:

- **5-year effectiveness review** by GAO
- **Public confidence tracking** through regular surveys
- **Compliance monitoring** by independent body
- **Automatic threshold adjustments** for inflation
- **Amendment procedures** allowing technical corrections without full legislative process
