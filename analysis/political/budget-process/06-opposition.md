# Budget Process Reform: Opposition

## Who Opposes Reform

### Congressional Leadership (Both Parties)

**Why They Benefit from Dysfunction**:

- Crisis concentrates power in leadership

- Omnibus bills negotiated by few

- Rank-and-file must vote yes/no

- Regular order disperses power

**Specific Opposition**:

| Reform | Leadership Position | Reason |
|--------|---------------------|--------|
| Regular order | Weak support | Reduces control |
| Automatic CRs | Oppose | Eliminates leverage |
| Biennial budgeting | Mixed | Less frequent control |
| Debt ceiling reform | Conditional | Depends on who's in power |

**Key Quotes**:

- Nancy Pelosi (2019): "You can't negotiate when you have a shutdown hanging over your head"

- Kevin McCarthy (2023): "The debt ceiling is leverage for fiscal responsibility"

### Fiscal Conservative Groups

**Organizations**:

- Heritage Action

- Club for Growth

- Americans for Prosperity

- FreedomWorks

**Why They Oppose Reform**:

| Argument | Actual Concern |
|----------|----------------|
| "Eliminates accountability" | Removes leverage for cuts |
| "Enables spending" | Can't force confrontation |
| "Congress should control" | Prefers crisis as weapon |
| "Fiscal discipline requires pressure" | Only tool that works |

**Strategy**:

- Oppose automatic CRs

- Support debt ceiling as leverage

- Score votes against reform

- Primary members who support reform

### Freedom Caucus and Allied Members

**Key Figures**:

- Members who use shutdown/debt ceiling threats

- Fiscally conservative members

- Anti-establishment members

**Arguments Made**:

| Stated Argument | Underlying Interest |
|-----------------|---------------------|
| "Spending is out of control" | Leverage for cuts |
| "Regular order would work if tried" | Deflection |
| "Congress must face consequences" | Maintain threat |
| "Automatic funding is unconstitutional" | Preserve weapon |

### Appropriations Committee (Partial)

**Opposition to Biennial Budgeting**:

- Annual appropriations is their power

- Biennial reduces committee relevance

- Less oversight opportunity

- Turf protection

**However**: Many appropriators support regular order and oppose CRs that bypass their process.

## Arguments Against Specific Reforms

### Against Automatic Continuing Resolutions

**Argument 1: "Removes Congressional Control"**

*Claim*: Constitution gives Congress power over appropriations; automatic funding undermines this.

*Reality*:

- Congress sets the automatic level

- Can always pass new appropriations

- Other countries have similar mechanisms

- Current system also undermines control (leadership decides)

**Argument 2: "Enables Irresponsible Spending"**

*Claim*: Without shutdown threat, spending will grow unchecked.

*Reality*:

- CRs freeze spending at prior levels

- No new programs under automatic CR

- Agencies need appropriations for increases

- Baseline budgeting already assumes growth

**Argument 3: "Eliminates Accountability"**

*Claim*: Congress needs pressure to make tough decisions.

*Reality*:

- Shutdowns punish public, not Congress

- Members still get paid during shutdowns

- Accountability should be electoral, not through crisis

- Other democracies manage without this

### Against Debt Ceiling Abolition

**Argument 1: "Only Check on Spending"**

*Claim*: Debt ceiling forces fiscal responsibility.

*Reality*:

- Never actually reduced spending

- Always raised (or suspended) eventually

- Creates artificial crisis, not discipline

- Spending decisions already made before ceiling hit

**Argument 2: "Constitutional Requirement"**

*Claim*: Congress must authorize borrowing specifically.

*Reality*:

- Borrowing already authorized implicitly by appropriations

- Debt ceiling is statutory, not constitutional

- Original purpose (1917) was to enable borrowing, not restrict

- Current form dates only to 1939

**Argument 3: "Financial Markets Discipline"**

*Claim*: Markets will impose discipline if ceiling creates default risk.

*Reality*:

- Markets punish dysfunction (2011 downgrade)

- Default threat damages credibility

- Increases borrowing costs permanently

- Opposite of fiscal responsibility

### Against Biennial Budgeting

**Argument 1: "Reduces Oversight"**

*Claim*: Annual appropriations enable better oversight.

*Reality*:

- Current process provides little oversight

- Omnibus bills passed with no review

- Biennial could include enhanced oversight provisions

- Oversight happens through authorizing, not appropriating

**Argument 2: "Inflexible in Crises"**

*Claim*: Two-year budget can't respond to emergencies.

*Reality*:

- Supplemental appropriations always available

- Current system doesn't respond well either

- Emergency spending excluded from caps

- Biennial budgeting successful at state level

**Argument 3: "Economic Conditions Change"**

*Claim*: Economy changes too fast for two-year budgets.

*Reality*:

- Budget projections inaccurate anyway

- Adjustments possible through supplementals

- States manage with biennial budgets

- Defense already has multi-year authority

### Against Eliminating Reconciliation Limits

**Argument 1: "Byrd Rule Protects Senate"**

*Claim*: Without Byrd Rule, reconciliation becomes vehicle for everything.

*Reality*:

- Reconciliation already used for major legislation

- Byrd Rule easily circumvented

- Sunsets and workarounds common

- Rule creates weird policy outcomes

**However**: Some reformers want stronger reconciliation limits, not weaker ones.

### Against Earmark Transparency

**Argument 1: "Local Knowledge"**

*Claim*: Members know local needs better than agencies.

*Reality*:

- Transparency doesn't eliminate earmarks

- Just requires disclosure

- Public can evaluate merit

- No reason for secrecy if legitimate

**Argument 2: "Greases Legislative Wheels"**

*Claim*: Earmarks help pass difficult legislation.

*Reality*:

- Can still have earmarks with transparency

- Disclosure actually legitimizes practice

- Secret earmarks invite corruption

## The Status Quo Coalition

### Why Dysfunction Persists

**Multiple Veto Points**:

| Actor | Veto Power | Interest in Dysfunction |
|-------|------------|------------------------|
| House leadership | Floor control | Centralized power |
| Senate leadership | Floor control | Same |
| Minority parties | Leverage | Crisis = bargaining power |
| Fiscal hawks | Holds, votes | Spending cuts |
| Appropriators | Process control | Turf protection |

**Collective Action Problem**:

- Everyone benefits from dysfunction when in minority

- Everyone suffers from it when governing

- No one invests in long-term process reform

- Short-term incentives dominate

### The Leverage Argument

**Core Opposition Logic**:

- "We need leverage to achieve policy goals"

- "Shutdown/default threat is the only thing that works"

- "Without pressure, the other side won't negotiate"

- "Process reform helps the spenders"

**Response**:

- Leverage works temporarily but damages governance

- Other countries achieve fiscal goals without crises

- Constant crisis undermines public trust

- Leverage available to both sides, so zero-sum

## Ideological Opposition

### Anti-Government Philosophy

**Argument**: Government dysfunction proves government is the problem.

**Adherents**:

- Some libertarian-leaning members

- Anti-establishment movements

- Those who benefit from distrust

**Counter**:

- Dysfunction is a choice, not inherent

- Well-functioning government possible

- Other democracies demonstrate this

- Self-fulfilling prophecy damages public

### Strict Constructionism

**Argument**: Constitution requires annual appropriations through specific legislative process.

**Reality**:

- Constitution doesn't specify process details

- Automatic CRs still require initial congressional action

- Founders didn't envision modern budget complexity

- Spirit of Constitution is functional government

## Interest Group Opposition

### Anti-Tax Groups

**Organizations**:

- Americans for Tax Reform

- National Taxpayers Union

**Position**:

- Oppose reforms that might enable tax increases

- Support leverage for spending cuts only

- May support some process reforms selectively

### Defense-Focused Groups

**Organizations**:

- Some defense advocacy groups

- Some veteran organizations

**Position**:

- Complex relationship with reform

- Want defense funding protected

- May oppose caps that include defense

- Often support multi-year authority

## Countering Opposition Arguments

### "Congress Must Control Spending"

**Counter**:

- Congress does control spending through initial appropriations

- Automatic CR continues Congress's last decision

- Congress can always pass new appropriations

- Current system gives control to leadership, not Congress

### "Debt Ceiling Forces Responsibility"

**Counter**:

- Has never reduced spending or debt

- Actually increases costs (uncertainty, potential default)

- Other countries more fiscally responsible without it

- Creates fake crisis over past decisions

### "Shutdowns Create Accountability"

**Counter**:

- Public suffers, not politicians

- Members paid during shutdowns

- No electoral consequence typically

- Damages trust in all government

### "Reform Enables Spending"

**Counter**:

- Automatic CRs freeze spending

- Debt ceiling doesn't control spending (already appropriated)

- Current system produces omnibus spending increases

- Process reform is neutral on spending levels

## Why Opposition Succeeds

### Structural Advantages

| Advantage | Mechanism |
|-----------|-----------|
| Veto points | Multiple ways to block reform |
| Status quo bias | Change requires action |
| Diffuse benefits | Reform helps everyone a little |
| Concentrated costs | Reform hurts some a lot |

### Political Dynamics

- Opposition well-organized (fiscal groups)

- Support diffuse (general public)

- Issue complex (hard to mobilize on)

- Crisis is normal (public accustomed)

### Timing Problems

- Reform considered only during crisis

- Crisis is worst time for deliberation

- After crisis, attention moves on

- No sustained pressure for reform
