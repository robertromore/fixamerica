# Budget Process Reform: Roadmap

## Phase 1: Crisis Prevention (Years 1-2)

### Goal: Eliminate Immediate Dysfunction

**Priority Actions**:

1. **Automatic Continuing Resolution**
   - Introduce Prevent Government Shutdowns Act
   - Build coalition: federal employees, contractors, moderates
   - Pass before next shutdown threat
   - Include incentive mechanism (declining funding)

2. **Debt Ceiling Reform**
   - Introduce Debt Ceiling Reform Act (Gephardt-style)
   - Alternative: Permanent McConnell mechanism
   - Business community lobbying campaign
   - Financial sector support mobilization

### Legislative Strategy

| Action | Timeline | Lead |
|--------|----------|------|
| Bill introduction | Month 1-2 | Bipartisan sponsors |
| Committee hearings | Month 3-4 | Budget committees |
| Floor votes | Month 5-6 | Target before next crisis |
| Signature | Month 6-7 | Presidential support |

### Coalition Building

**For Automatic CR**:

- Federal employee unions (AFGE, NTEU)

- Government contractor associations

- Good government groups

- Centrist/moderate members

- Agencies (informal)

**For Debt Ceiling Reform**:

- Chamber of Commerce

- Business Roundtable

- Wall Street firms

- Former Treasury secretaries (bipartisan)

- Credit rating agencies (statements)

### Messaging

**Frame**: "End Government by Crisis"

- Shutdowns waste taxpayer money

- Debt ceiling threatens economy

- Other countries don't have these problems

- Bipartisan, common-sense reform

**Avoid**:

- Partisan framing

- Blame assignment

- Ideological arguments

- Spending level debates (separate issue)

## Phase 2: Process Modernization (Years 2-4)

### Goal: Fix the Annual Budget Process

**Priority Actions**:

1. **Timeline Reform**
   - Earlier submission deadlines
   - Compressed committee schedules
   - Pre-August recess completion target
   - Enforce existing deadlines

2. **Budget Resolution Strengthening**
   - Joint resolution option
   - Stronger enforcement mechanisms
   - Deeming resolution requirements
   - Reconciliation guardrails

3. **Committee Process Restoration**
   - Regular order incentives
   - Open markup requirements
   - Amendment opportunities
   - Conference committee revival

### Implementation Steps

### Building Support

**Appropriations Committee Buy-In**:

- Reduce leadership dominance

- Restore deliberative process

**Budget Committee Buy-In**:

- Strengthen enforcement role

- Make resolutions meaningful

- Reconciliation reform

- Institutional relevance

**Rank-and-File Buy-In**:

- Reduce crisis votes

- Better constituent service

## Phase 3: Structural Reform (Years 4-8)

### Goal: Long-Term Budget Framework

**Priority Actions**:

1. **Biennial Budgeting**
   - Study commission first
   - Pilot in select agencies
   - Full implementation after evaluation
   - Strong oversight requirements

2. **Fiscal Rules**
   - Evaluate international models
   - Consider debt-to-GDP target
   - Expenditure growth limits
   - Automatic stabilizers

3. **Long-Term Budgeting**
   - 30-year projections required
   - Generational accounting
   - Unfunded liability reporting
   - Sustainability analysis

### Biennial Budgeting Implementation

**Phase 3a: Study and Pilot (Years 4-5)**

| Action | Timeline |
|--------|----------|
| Establish study commission | Year 4, Q1 |
| Commission report | Year 4, Q4 |
| Select pilot agencies | Year 5, Q1 |
| Begin pilot | Year 5, Q3 |

**Phase 3b: Evaluation (Year 6)**

| Criterion | Measure |
|-----------|---------|
| Process efficiency | Time saved |
| Oversight quality | Hearings held |
| Agency satisfaction | Survey |
| Fiscal outcomes | Compliance with caps |

**Phase 3c: Full Implementation (Years 7-8)**

| Step | Timeline |
|------|----------|
| Legislation for full system | Year 7, Q1 |
| Transition planning | Year 7, Q2-Q3 |
| First biennial budget | Year 8 |

### Fiscal Rules Consideration

**Options to Evaluate**:

| Rule | Pros | Cons |
|------|------|------|
| Debt-to-GDP cap | Clear target | Inflexible in recession |
| Spending growth limit | Predictable | May bind needed spending |
| Balanced budget (cyclical) | Discipline | Hard to define cycle |
| Golden rule (investment only) | Allows infrastructure | Definition problems |

**Evaluation Criteria**:

- Flexibility in emergencies

- Enforceability

- Economic impact

- Political sustainability

## Political Considerations

### Window of Opportunity

**Best Times for Reform**:

- After a particularly damaging shutdown

- After debt ceiling near-miss

- Beginning of new Congress

- Unified government (either party)

**Worst Times**:

- During crisis (panic, not deliberation)

- Election years (no appetite for process)

- Divided government (harder to agree)

- Immediately after crisis (attention moves)

### Building Momentum

**Public Engagement**:

| Strategy | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Media campaign | Explain dysfunction costs |
| Business mobilization | Economic argument |
| Federal employee stories | Human impact |
| Town halls | Member accountability |

**Elite Engagement**:

| Group | Approach |
|-------|----------|
| Former budget chairs | Bipartisan endorsements |
| Former OMB directors | Expert credibility |
| Former Fed chairs | Economic warnings |
| Business CEOs | Economic stake |

### Overcoming Resistance

**For Fiscal Hawks**:

- Emphasize spending caps remain

- Automatic CR freezes, doesn't increase

- Separate spending debate from process debate

- Debt ceiling never reduced spending anyway

**For Leadership**:

- Some centralization preserved

- Crisis management exhausting

- Regular order still has leadership role

- Credit for reform

**For Appropriators**:

- Regular order restores their power

- Current system bypasses committees

- Biennial still has oversight role

- Earmarks with transparency

## Risk Mitigation

### What Could Go Wrong

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Crisis causes panic reform | Build support before crisis |
| Reforms reversed | Make politically costly to undo |
| Loopholes exploited | Careful drafting, review |
| Transition problems | Pilot and phase in |
| Partisan capture | Maintain bipartisan support |

### Contingency Plans

**If Automatic CR Blocked**:

- McConnell-style mechanism instead

- CR tied to member pay

- Prioritization of essential services

- Continue building support

**If Debt Ceiling Reform Fails**:

- Permanent suspension instead of abolition

- McConnell mechanism as default

- Treasury extraordinary measures codified

- Continue economic education

**If Biennial Budgeting Fails**:

- Strengthen annual process instead

- Earlier deadlines as alternative

- Pilot in specific areas only

- Return to proposal later
