# Budget Process Reform: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Budget process reform requires statutory changes to fix the failures of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and related laws. Key areas include: eliminating the debt ceiling as a weapon, preventing government shutdowns, modernizing the budget timeline, and restoring fiscal accountability. This document provides draft legislative text for comprehensive reform.

## Federal Legislation

### Debt Ceiling Reform Act

**Purpose**: Eliminate the debt ceiling as a source of manufactured crises by automatically increasing the limit to accommodate appropriated spending.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Debt Ceiling Reform Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The debt limit was established in 1917 to facilitate government
    borrowing, not to restrict it.
(2) The debt limit does not control spending; it only limits borrowing
    to pay for spending already authorized and appropriated.
(3) Debt ceiling standoffs have resulted in credit rating downgrades,
    market volatility, and increased borrowing costs.
(4) The threat of default on United States obligations undermines the
    full faith and credit of the United States.
(5) Separating the decision to authorize borrowing from the decisions
    to authorize and appropriate spending creates artificial crises.

SEC. 3. AUTOMATIC ADJUSTMENT OF DEBT LIMIT.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 3101 of title 31, United States Code, is amended
    by adding at the end the following new subsection:

"(d) AUTOMATIC ADJUSTMENT.—
    (1) IN GENERAL.—Upon the enactment of any appropriation Act, the
        debt limit under subsection (b) shall be automatically increased
        by an amount equal to the net increase in appropriations provided
        by such Act above the amounts available under existing appropriations.
    (2) BUDGET RESOLUTION.—Upon the adoption of a concurrent resolution
        on the budget, the debt limit under subsection (b) shall be
        automatically increased to accommodate the levels of spending
        and revenue set forth in such resolution.
    (3) CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS.—Upon the enactment of any continuing
        resolution or automatic continuing appropriation under section 4
        of the Prevent Government Shutdowns Act, the debt limit shall be
        automatically increased to accommodate such appropriations."

(b) CONFORMING AMENDMENT.—Section 3101(b) of title 31, United States Code,
    is amended by inserting "subject to automatic adjustment under
    subsection (d)," before "is limited to".

SEC. 4. TREASURY BORROWING AUTHORITY.

(a) CASH MANAGEMENT.—The Secretary of the Treasury shall have authority
    to borrow such sums as necessary to fund appropriations enacted by
    Congress and to manage the cash position of the United States.

(b) NO DEFAULT.—The Secretary shall take all actions necessary to prevent
    default on any obligation of the United States.

(c) REPORTING.—The Secretary shall provide quarterly reports to Congress
    on borrowing activities, debt management operations, and projected
    borrowing needs.

SEC. 5. EXPEDITED PROCEDURES.

(a) CONGRESSIONAL DISAPPROVAL.—Notwithstanding the automatic adjustment
    under section 3:
    (1) Congress may, within 30 days of any automatic adjustment, pass
        a joint resolution disapproving such adjustment.
    (2) Such resolution shall be privileged in both Houses.
    (3) The President may veto such resolution.
    (4) If the resolution is enacted over a veto, the Secretary of the
        Treasury shall identify offsetting spending reductions or revenue
        increases to avoid the need for additional borrowing.

(b) EFFECT OF DISAPPROVAL.—If a disapproval resolution is enacted:
    (1) The Secretary shall provide Congress with a detailed plan for
        avoiding default within 14 days.
    (2) If no plan is enacted within 30 days, the automatic adjustment
        shall take effect notwithstanding the disapproval.

SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect upon enactment and shall apply to all
appropriations enacted after such date.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 3**: Ties debt ceiling to actual spending decisions, eliminating separate crisis

- **Section 4**: Gives Treasury explicit authority to prevent default

- **Section 5**: Allows Congress symbolic disapproval vote without enabling default

- **Section 5(b)**: Backstop ensures no actual default possible

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Enables unlimited borrowing" | Only accommodates congressionally appropriated spending |
| "Removes fiscal discipline" | Spending decisions are the discipline point |
| "Unconstitutional delegation" | Congress still votes on spending |

### No Budget No Pay Act

**Purpose**: Create incentive for Congress to complete appropriations on time by escrowing member pay.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "No Budget No Pay Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Congress has not passed all appropriations bills on time since
    fiscal year 1997.
(2) Government shutdowns harm federal employees, contractors, and
    the public.
(3) Members of Congress should share consequences of budget failures.
(4) Pay incentives may encourage timely completion of appropriations.

SEC. 3. HOLDING OF PAY.

(a) IN GENERAL.—If on October 1 of any fiscal year the appropriations
    for such fiscal year have not been enacted, beginning on October 2:
    (1) The pay of each Member of Congress shall be deposited in an
        escrow account rather than paid directly.
    (2) Such escrowed amounts shall be released to Members upon the
        enactment of all regular appropriations for such fiscal year.

(b) DEFINITION.—For purposes of this section, "all regular appropriations"
    means:
    (1) all 12 regular appropriations Acts; or
    (2) a full-year continuing resolution enacted by recorded vote that
        covers the entire fiscal year and is not a short-term extension.

(c) EXCLUSION.—A continuing resolution that expires before the end of
    the fiscal year shall not constitute completion of regular appropriations
    for purposes of this section.

SEC. 4. RELEASE OF PAY.

(a) UPON APPROPRIATIONS.—Escrowed pay shall be released to Members
    within 5 business days of the enactment of all regular appropriations.

(b) END OF CONGRESS.—Any pay remaining in escrow at the end of a
    Congress shall be released to Members.

(c) NO INTEREST.—No interest shall accrue on escrowed amounts.

SEC. 5. TREATMENT FOR TAX PURPOSES.

Escrowed pay shall be treated as received for purposes of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 at the time it would have been received absent
this Act.

SEC. 6. NO EFFECT ON STAFF PAY.

This Act does not affect the pay of any employee of Congress other
than Members.

SEC. 7. CONSTITUTIONAL CONSIDERATIONS.

(a) This Act is enacted pursuant to Article I, Section 6, Clause 1 of
    the Constitution, which provides that Members shall receive
    compensation "ascertained by Law."

(b) Consistent with the 27th Amendment, this Act does not change the
    amount of compensation, only the timing of payment based on
    completion of constitutional duties.

SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect with respect to the first fiscal year
beginning after the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 3**: Escrow, not forfeiture, to comply with Constitution

- **Section 4(b)**: Pay eventually released to avoid permanent forfeiture issues

- **Section 5**: Tax timing prevents gaming

- **Section 7**: Addresses 27th Amendment concerns

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| 27th Amendment | Escrow isn't change in compensation amount |
| Wealthy members unaffected | Symbolic importance, public pressure |
| Constitutional duties | Pay for service, completing appropriations is service |

### Prevent Government Shutdowns Act

**Purpose**: Establish automatic continuing appropriations to prevent government shutdowns when regular appropriations are not enacted.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Prevent Government Shutdowns Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Government shutdowns harm federal employees, contractors, and
    the communities that depend on federal services.
(2) Shutdowns cost billions of dollars in lost productivity and
    economic damage.
(3) The United States is the only major democracy that regularly
    shuts down its government over budget disputes.
(4) An automatic continuing resolution would preserve congressional
    authority while preventing harmful shutdowns.
(5) Declining funding levels would provide incentive for Congress to
    complete regular appropriations.

SEC. 3. AUTOMATIC CONTINUING APPROPRIATIONS.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Chapter 13 of title 31, United States Code, is amended
    by adding at the end the following new section:

"§ 1342. Automatic continuing appropriations

"(a) IN GENERAL.—If on October 1 of any fiscal year, appropriations
    for such fiscal year have not been enacted for any discretionary
    program, project, or activity, there are hereby appropriated such
    sums as may be necessary to continue such program, project, or
    activity at the rate and under the conditions specified in this
    section.

"(b) INITIAL RATE.—For the first 120 days of any fiscal year in which
    automatic appropriations under this section apply, the rate of
    operations shall be the lower of:
    (1) the rate of operations for the preceding fiscal year; or
    (2) the rate provided in the most recently passed House or Senate
        appropriations bill for such fiscal year.

"(c) DECLINING RATE.—
    (1) 121-180 DAYS.—For days 121 through 180, the rate of operations
        shall be reduced by 1 percent from the initial rate.
    (2) 181-240 DAYS.—For days 181 through 240, the rate of operations
        shall be reduced by 2 percent from the initial rate.
    (3) AFTER 240 DAYS.—After day 240, the rate shall remain at the
        level applicable under paragraph (2) until regular appropriations
        are enacted.

"(d) DURATION.—Automatic appropriations under this section shall
    continue until the enactment of an applicable regular or continuing
    appropriation.

"(e) ACTIVITIES INCLUDED.—Automatic appropriations shall cover:
    (1) all programs, projects, and activities funded in the preceding
        fiscal year;
    (2) new programs authorized by law and funded in either House or
        Senate appropriations bills; and
    (3) ongoing contracts and obligations.

"(f) ACTIVITIES EXCLUDED.—Automatic appropriations shall not apply to:
    (1) any program, project, or activity for which no funds were
        appropriated in the preceding fiscal year and which is not
        included in either House or Senate appropriations bills;
    (2) any program terminated by law.

"(g) ENTITLEMENTS.—This section shall not affect mandatory spending
    programs, which shall continue as provided by law.

"(h) PAY.—Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, federal
    employees shall be paid in full and on time during any period of
    automatic appropriations.

"(i) ANOMALIES.—Congress may enact specific adjustments to automatic
    appropriation levels through joint resolution.

"(j) NO SHUTDOWN.—Under no circumstances shall any lapse in appropriations
    result in the furlough of federal employees or the suspension of
    government services funded under this section."

(b) CONFORMING AMENDMENTS.—The table of sections for chapter 13 of
    title 31, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the
    following new item:
    "1342. Automatic continuing appropriations."

SEC. 4. CONTRACTOR PROTECTIONS.

(a) CONTINUATION OF WORK.—Federal contractors shall continue work during
    periods of automatic appropriations at the rate in effect for the
    preceding fiscal year.

(b) PAYMENT.—Contractors shall be paid on the same schedule as during
    regular appropriations.

(c) NO TERMINATION.—Contracts may not be terminated solely due to the
    application of automatic appropriations.

SEC. 5. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

(a) OMB REPORT.—If automatic appropriations under section 3 remain in
    effect for more than 30 days, the Director of the Office of
    Management and Budget shall submit to Congress a report including:
    (1) the programs operating under automatic appropriations;
    (2) any programs unable to operate effectively;
    (3) recommended actions for Congress.

(b) AGENCY REPORTS.—Each agency shall report to its appropriations
    subcommittee on impacts of operating under automatic appropriations
    within 60 days of such appropriations taking effect.

SEC. 6. RULE OF CONSTRUCTION.

Nothing in this Act shall be construed to:
(1) affect the authority of Congress to enact appropriations at any
    time;
(2) create any entitlement or mandatory spending;
(3) affect the President's authority to submit budget requests.

SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect upon enactment and shall first apply to
fiscal year 2026.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 3(b)-(c)**: Declining rates incentivize action while preventing shutdown

- **Section 3(h)**: Explicit employee pay protection

- **Section 3(j)**: Prohibits any shutdown scenario

- **Section 4**: Protects contractors who otherwise have no back pay

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Removes pressure to appropriate | Declining rate creates incentive |
| Freezes funding at prior levels | Better than shutdown; Congress can still act |
| Reduces congressional power | Congress sets initial rate through prior appropriation |

    (3) tax provisions continue under current law.

(b) REPORTING.—All CBO reports shall clearly indicate whether spending
    increases or decreases from the prior year in nominal terms.

```

**Explanation**:

- **Title I**: Earlier deadlines provide more time for deliberation

- **Title II**: Binding budget resolution with enforcement

- **Title III**: Reconciliation restored to deficit-reduction purpose

- **Title IV**: Clearer baseline makes debate honest

- **Title V**: Biennial pilot for evaluation

- **Title VI**: Transparent, limited earmarks

## Regulatory Framework

### OMB Circular Revisions

**A-11 (Budget Preparation)**:

- Align with new deadlines

- Enhanced justification requirements

- Zero-based pilot guidance

- Biennial budget instructions

**A-123 (Management Accountability)**:

- Automatic CR implementation guidance

- Contractor payment procedures

- Employee pay continuity

### Treasury Regulations

**Debt Limit Management**:

- Automatic adjustment procedures

- Reporting requirements

- Cash management under new framework

**Payments During Automatic CR**:

- Disbursement priorities

- Contractor payment schedules

- Employee pay processing

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Debt Ceiling Reform**:

- Congress has power over borrowing (Art. I, Sec. 8)

- Automatic increase is delegation, not abdication

- Congress retains disapproval authority

- 14th Amendment considerations (validity of public debt)

**No Budget No Pay**:

- 27th Amendment: "No law varying the compensation..."

- Escrow timing may satisfy (no change in amount)

- Previous versions passed House

- Litigation possible but likely survives

**Automatic Continuing Appropriations**:

- Congress can structure appropriations as it chooses

- Prior-year level set by Congress

- Declining rate is congressional choice

- No separation of powers issue

### Enforcement Mechanisms

| Reform | Enforcement |
|--------|-------------|
| Debt ceiling automatic increase | Self-executing statute |
| No Budget No Pay | Disbursing officers withhold |
| Automatic CR | Self-executing appropriation |
| Timeline deadlines | Points of order, floor restrictions |
| Reconciliation limits | Parliamentarian rulings |

### Judicial Review

**Standing Issues**:

- Members may sue over process violations

- Employees have standing for pay issues

- Contractors for contract disputes

- Courts generally defer to Congress on internal rules

**Likely Reviewable**:

- Debt ceiling automatic increase mechanism

- Employee pay escrow constitutionality

- Automatic CR as appropriation

**Likely Political Question**:

- Internal process rules

- Budget resolution enforcement

- Reconciliation procedures

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Debt Ceiling Reform Act

**Potential Loopholes**:

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Disapproval gaming | Congress passes disapproval, forces political crisis even if overridden | Medium |
| Definition disputes | What counts as "appropriation" for automatic increase | Medium |
| Emergency spending | Large supplementals without debt ceiling adjustment | Low |
| Mandatory spending growth | Automatic programs increase debt without appropriation | Medium |
| Rescission manipulation | Congress appropriates then rescinds, gaming debt adjustment | Medium |

**Shortcomings**:

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Doesn't address underlying spending | Fiscal trajectory unchanged | Debt ceiling never controlled spending |
| Political theater continues | Disapproval votes allow posturing | Structural feature |
| No fiscal rule created | Debt can grow indefinitely | Beyond debt ceiling reform scope |
| Requires presidential action | Must sign appropriations | Constitutional design |

**Rectification Procedures**:

1. **Disapproval gaming**: Add requirement that disapproval must include specific offsetting cuts; if not enacted, automatic adjustment stands

2. **Definition disputes**: Explicit definition in statute including supplementals, CRs, and automatic appropriations

3. **Mandatory spending**: Include mandatory growth in automatic adjustment calculation

4. **Rescission manipulation**: Debt adjustment made upon appropriation; rescission doesn't reduce ceiling

5. **Fiscal trajectory**: Consider companion legislation for fiscal rule (debt-to-GDP target)

### No Budget No Pay Act

**Potential Loopholes**:

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Wealthy members immune | $174,000 escrow means nothing to millionaires | High |
| End-of-Congress release | No permanent consequence for delay | High |
| Staff funding continues | Only members affected, not overall operations | Medium |
| Definition of "complete" | 180-day CR counts as complete | Medium |
| Retroactive compliance | Pass appropriations at end, get back pay | Medium |

**Shortcomings**:

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Unlikely to change behavior | Symbolic rather than effective | Member wealth distribution |
| Constitutional concerns | 27th Amendment litigation possible | Pay timing vs. amount distinction unclear |
| Penalizes minorities | Members who want to appropriate outvoted | Collective action problem |
| No staff impact | Staff still work during dysfunction | Limited scope |

**Rectification Procedures**:

1. **Wealthy member immunity**: Consider alternative incentives (loss of floor privileges, committee assignments)

2. **End-of-Congress release**: Require final forfeiture after Congress ends (may increase constitutional risk)

3. **CR as completion**: Require full-year CR or all 12 appropriations bills

4. **Retroactive compliance**: Escrow becomes donation to Treasury if appropriations not completed within 6 months

5. **Broader impact**: Consider leadership penalty (loss of leadership position if deadlines missed repeatedly)

### Prevent Government Shutdowns Act

**Potential Loopholes**:

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| No new program starts | Automatic CR freezes at prior year | High |
| Declining rate is small | 1-2% reduction insufficient incentive | Medium |
| Definition of "program" | Agencies may restructure to avoid cuts | Medium |
| Gaming prior year | Inflate prior year to have higher automatic level | High |
| Anomalies abuse | Extensive anomalies could circumvent automatic CR | Medium |

**Shortcomings**:

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Reduces urgency to appropriate | Some prefer automatic CR to hard choices | Design feature (intended) |
| Freezes priorities | Can't respond to changed needs | Prior year baseline |
| Contractor uncertainty persists | Contract modifications still difficult | Continuing operations, not new starts |
| No policy adjustments | Automatic CR can't change direction | Limited scope |
| Agency planning still impaired | Multi-year planning still impossible | Annual cycle preserved |

**Rectification Procedures**:

1. **New program starts**: Include authorized programs from House or Senate bills in automatic CR

2. **Declining rate enhancement**: Increase reduction to 5% after 120 days, 10% after 240 days

3. **Definition gaming**: OMB guidance on program definitions; GAO enforcement

4. **Prior year gaming**: Use average of prior 3 years or lowest of prior year/House/Senate levels

5. **Anomalies abuse**: Limit anomalies to 20% of automatic appropriation; require supermajority for more

6. **Urgency preservation**: Add congressional schedule restrictions during automatic CR

### Budget Process Reform Act

**Potential Loopholes**:

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Deadline waiver | Three-fifths vote to waive deadlines | Medium |
| Joint resolution failure | No budget resolution leads to president's budget as default | Medium |
| Reconciliation workarounds | Creative drafting to meet deficit-reduction only | High |
| Byrd Rule gaming continues | 67 votes still attainable in some cases | Medium |
| Earmark definition | "Congressionally directed spending" can be narrow | Medium |
| Biennial pilot limited | Only three subcommittees | Low |

**Shortcomings**:

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Requires political will | Process rules can't force political agreement | Fundamental limit of process reform |
| President's budget as default | May be unacceptable to Congress | Design compromise |
| Sunset scoring controversial | Requires assumption of permanence | Political disagreement on scoring |
| Baseline reform doesn't bind | CBO can adjust methodology | Agency independence |
| Earmark cap may be too low | 1% may be insufficient for coalition building | Arbitrary threshold |

**Rectification Procedures**:

1. **Deadline waiver**: Require waiver motion to include plan for meeting deadline within 30 days

2. **Joint resolution failure**: Use prior year resolution rather than president's budget as default

3. **Reconciliation workarounds**: Strengthen Parliamentarian authority; no VP override; 75-vote waiver

4. **Byrd Rule enforcement**: Create independent Senate Budget Enforcement Office

5. **Earmark definition**: Explicit list of what counts; annual GAO report on compliance

6. **Biennial pilot expansion**: Automatic expansion if evaluation positive; 7-subcommittee target

### Cross-Cutting Issues

**General Loopholes Affecting All Reforms**:

| Vulnerability | Affects | Mitigation |
|---------------|---------|------------|
| Future Congress repeal | All statutory reforms | Make reforms popular; bipartisan support |
| Rules changes | Senate/House procedures | Include in statute where possible |
| Interpretation disputes | All provisions | Clear definitions; designated interpreters |
| Political will failure | All enforcement | Public pressure; automatic mechanisms |
| Emergency exceptions | All provisions | Define emergencies narrowly; supermajority required |

**Monitoring Requirements**:

| Metric | Frequency | Entity |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Appropriations completion timing | Annually | CBO |
| Debt ceiling adjustments | Each adjustment | Treasury |
| Automatic CR activations | Each instance | OMB |
| Reconciliation content analysis | Each bill | CRS |
| Earmark totals and distribution | Annually | GAO |
| Biennial budget pilot outcomes | Biannually | GAO |

**Amendment Procedures**:

1. **Debt ceiling**: Treasury reports; congressional review every 5 years

2. **Shutdown prevention**: OMB evaluation; adjustment of declining rates as needed

3. **Budget process**: Budget committees review after each Congress

4. **Earmarks**: Appropriations committees annual evaluation; cap adjustment authority

5. **Biennial budgeting**: Expansion or contraction based on GAO evaluation

### Implementation Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
