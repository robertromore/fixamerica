# Budget Process Reform: History

## The Constitutional Framework

### Original Design

**Article I, Section 9**: "No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law."

**Founders' Intent**:

- Congress controls the purse

- Executive cannot spend without authorization

- Power of appropriation checks executive

- No standing military without annual funding

### Early Budget Practice (1789-1921)

**Initial System**:

- No executive budget

- Department heads requested funds directly from Congress

- Multiple appropriations committees

- Decentralized, fragmented process

**Problems**:

- No overall fiscal picture

- Executive branch lacked coordination

- Congress received conflicting requests

- Deficits during wars, surpluses in peace

## The Budget and Accounting Act of 1921

### Creation of the Executive Budget

**Key Reforms**:

- President submits unified budget

- Bureau of the Budget created (later OMB)

- General Accounting Office established (later GAO)

- Executive responsible for coordinating requests

**Process Change**:

| Before 1921 | After 1921 |
|-------------|------------|
| Agencies to Congress directly | Agencies through President |
| No unified proposal | Single executive budget |
| No central budget office | Bureau of the Budget |
| Limited audit capacity | GAO oversight |

### Congressional Response

**Consolidation**:

- House Appropriations Committee strengthened

- Senate Appropriations Committee centralized

- Standing authorizing committees separated from appropriations

- Two-step process: authorize then appropriate

## The Nixon Era and Budget Conflict

### Impoundment Crisis

**Nixon's Actions (1969-1974)**:

- Refused to spend billions in appropriated funds

- Impounded environmental, housing, social programs

- Claimed inherent executive authority

- Congress saw usurpation of power

**Scale of Impoundments**:

| Category | Amount Impounded |
|----------|------------------|
| Clean Water Act | $9 billion |
| Agriculture programs | $400 million |
| Housing programs | $2.7 billion |
| Highway programs | $500 million |

### Congressional Response

**Impoundment Control Act of 1974**:

- Prohibited unauthorized impoundment

- Created rescission process (requires congressional approval)

- Limited deferrals to specific purposes

- Established congressional budget procedures

## The Congressional Budget Act of 1974

### The Reform Vision

**Goals**:

- Give Congress independent budget capacity

- Create orderly timeline

- Establish fiscal discipline

- Counter executive dominance

**Key Provisions**:

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Budget committees | Coordinate fiscal policy |
| Congressional Budget Office | Independent analysis |
| Budget resolution | Set spending/revenue targets |
| Reconciliation | Implement resolution through legislation |
| Impoundment control | Prevent executive spending refusal |
| Timeline | Orderly process with deadlines |

### The Reconciliation Tool

**Original Design**:

- Implement deficit reduction after reviewing spending

- Come at end of budget process

- Expedited procedure (no filibuster)

- Limited scope: budget-related only

**First Use (1980)**:

- Carter administration

- Modest deficit reduction

- Process worked as intended

## The Reagan Revolution

### 1981 Reconciliation

**Gramm-Latta I and II**:

- First major use of reconciliation

- $35 billion in spending cuts

- Tax cuts (ERTA) passed separately

- Reconciliation became policy vehicle

**Precedent Set**:

- Reconciliation for major legislation

- Used at beginning of process, not end

- Deficit increased despite name

- Tool for partisan priorities

### Gramm-Rudman-Hollings (1985)

**The Balanced Budget Act**:

- Mandatory deficit targets

- Automatic sequestration if targets missed

- Declared partially unconstitutional (1986)

- Revised version passed (1987)

**Goals and Results**:

| Goal | Result |
|------|--------|
| Balanced budget by 1991 | Deficit increased |
| Automatic enforcement | Targets routinely adjusted |
| Fiscal discipline | Creative accounting instead |
| End deficit spending | Failed completely |

## The Budget Wars of the 1990s

### 1990 Budget Enforcement Act

**New Framework**:

- PAYGO (pay-as-you-go) rules

- Discretionary spending caps

- Abandoned fixed deficit targets

- Focus on controllable spending

**How It Worked**:

- New entitlements or tax cuts must be offset

- Discretionary divided into categories with caps

- Sequestration if caps exceeded

- Enforcement through points of order

### The 1995-1996 Shutdowns

**Background**:

- Republican Congress vs. Clinton White House

- Contract with America agenda

- Medicare and Medicaid cuts demanded

- Budget balance timeline dispute

**First Shutdown (November 13-19, 1995)**:

- 6 days

- 800,000 workers furloughed

- National parks closed

- Public blamed Republicans

**Second Shutdown (December 16, 1995 - January 6, 1996)**:

- 21 days

- Christmas/New Year disruption

- Social Security checks threatened

- Clinton's approval rose, Gingrich's fell

**Political Consequences**:

- Republicans backed down

- Clinton reelected 1996

- "Shut down the government" became politically risky

- Lesson: shutdowns hurt the party demanding changes

### The Balanced Budget of 1998-2001

**How It Happened**:

- 1997 Balanced Budget Act

- Strong economy, tech boom

- Lower spending from 1990 caps

- Revenue surge from capital gains

**Surpluses**:

| Fiscal Year | Balance |
|-------------|---------|
| FY 1998 | +$69 billion |
| FY 1999 | +$126 billion |
| FY 2000 | +$236 billion |
| FY 2001 | +$128 billion |

**What Changed**:

- 2001 and 2003 tax cuts

- 9/11 and War on Terror spending

- 2008 financial crisis

- Return to large deficits

## The 2000s: Breakdown Accelerates

### Budget Enforcement Expiration

**2002**:

- PAYGO rules expired

- Spending caps ended

- No enforcement mechanism

- Deficits returned

### The Earmark Era

**Peak Earmarks (2005)**:

- 15,877 earmarks

- $47.4 billion cost

- "Bridge to Nowhere" controversy

- Corruption scandals (Abramoff, Duke Cunningham)

**Earmark Timeline**:

| Year | Number | Cost |
|------|--------|------|
| 1991 | 546 | $3.1 billion |
| 2000 | 6,073 | $17.7 billion |
| 2005 | 15,877 | $47.4 billion |
| 2010 | 9,129 | $15.9 billion |
| 2011 | 0 | Banned |

### Reconciliation Expands

**Major Reconciliation Bills (2001-2010)**:

- 2001: Tax cuts ($1.35 trillion)

- 2003: Tax cuts ($350 billion)

- 2005: Deficit reduction (spending cuts)

- 2010: ACA revisions (Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act)

## The Debt Ceiling Weapon

### Pre-2011 History

**Debt Ceiling Origins**:

- Created 1917 (Liberty Bond limits)

- Made permanent 1939

- Raised routinely for decades

- Generally bipartisan, pro forma

**Routine Increases**:

- Reagan: 18 increases

- George H.W. Bush: 9 increases

- Clinton: 4 increases

- George W. Bush: 7 increases

### The 2011 Crisis

**Background**:

- Tea Party wave election 2010

- Republican House demanded cuts

- Obama sought "clean" increase

- Standoff through summer

**Timeline**:

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| April 2011 | Treasury begins extraordinary measures |
| July 2011 | Boehner-Obama grand bargain collapses |
| August 2, 2011 | Budget Control Act passes |
| August 5, 2011 | S&P downgrades US credit |

**Budget Control Act Provisions**:

- Raised debt ceiling in stages

- Created supercommittee for deficit reduction

- Sequestration if supercommittee failed

- Discretionary caps through 2021

### Sequestration

**What Happened**:

- Supercommittee failed November 2011

- Automatic cuts triggered March 2013

- Across-the-board reductions

- Defense and domestic split evenly

**Impact**:

- NIH research grants cut

- Defense readiness reduced

- Air traffic control furloughs (quickly reversed)

- Meat inspection disruptions

## The 2010s: Dysfunction Normalized

### 2013 Shutdown

**Cause**: Demand to defund Affordable Care Act

**Duration**: 16 days (October 1-16, 2013)

**Cost**: $24 billion economic impact (S&P estimate)

**Resolution**: Clean CR passed, no ACA changes

### Debt Ceiling Standoffs Continue

**2013**:

- Government funded but debt ceiling approaching

- Another last-minute deal

- Suspension mechanism introduced

**2015**:

- Bipartisan Budget Act

- Suspended ceiling through 2017

- Raised discretionary caps

**2017-2019**:

- Multiple suspensions

- Harvey relief attached

- Generally bipartisan passage

### The Era of Continuing Resolutions

**Number of CRs by Congress**:

| Congress | CRs Passed |
|----------|------------|
| 113th (2013-14) | 12 |
| 114th (2015-16) | 8 |
| 115th (2017-18) | 5 |
| 116th (2019-20) | 3 |
| 117th (2021-22) | 5 |

## Recent Developments

### 2018-2019 Shutdown

**Cause**: Border wall funding demand ($5.7 billion)

**Duration**: 35 days (longest ever)

**Key Events**:

- Pre-Christmas start

- Trump took ownership ("I am proud to shut down")

- LaGuardia delays ended stalemate

- Temporary CR, no wall funding

### 2023 Debt Ceiling Crisis

**Background**:

- Republican House majority after 2022

- Demanded spending cuts for increase

- Biden initially refused negotiation

**Resolution**: Fiscal Responsibility Act

- Suspended ceiling until January 2025

- Discretionary caps FY 2024-2025

- Work requirements for some benefits

- Rescission of COVID funds

- IRS funding reduced

### Recent Omnibus Bills

**FY 2023**: $1.7 trillion, December 2022

**FY 2024**: Two packages, March 2024

**Characteristics**:

- Thousands of pages

- Hours to read before vote

- Includes must-pass items

- Negotiated by leadership

- Regular members excluded

## Lessons from History

### What Has Failed

**1974 Act Assumptions**:

- That deadlines would be respected

- That budget resolutions would pass

- That reconciliation would stay limited

- That fiscal discipline would result

**1985 Gramm-Rudman Assumptions**:

- That automatic cuts would force deals

- That targets would be realistic

- That creative accounting would be prevented

**1990 BEA Assumptions**:

- That PAYGO would endure

- That caps would hold

- That emergency spending would be rare

### Patterns of Dysfunction

| Pattern | First Instance | Became Normal |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| Shutdown as weapon | 1995 | 2013+ |
| Debt ceiling brinksmanship | 2011 | Every limit |
| Reconciliation for tax cuts | 2001 | Standard practice |
| CR governance | 2000s | Every year |
| Omnibus bills | 1990s | Default method |

### Political Dynamics

**Why Dysfunction Persists**:

- Crisis governance benefits minority party

- Moderates have no leverage

- Leadership consolidates power

- Public attention is short

- No electoral consequence
