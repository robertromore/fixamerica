# Budget Process Reform: Current State

## How the Budget Process Should Work

### The Theoretical Timeline

| Date | Required Action |
|------|-----------------|
| First Monday in February | President submits budget |
| February 15 | CBO submits economic report |
| April 1 | Budget committees report resolution |
| April 15 | Congress completes budget resolution |
| May 15 | Annual appropriations may begin on House floor |
| June 10 | House Appropriations reports all bills |
| June 15 | Reconciliation to be completed |
| June 30 | House completes annual appropriations |
| October 1 | Fiscal year begins |

### The Actual Pattern

**Recent Fiscal Years**:

| Fiscal Year | Appropriations Completed | Method |
|-------------|-------------------------|--------|
| FY 2024 | March 2024 (6 months late) | 2 omnibus packages |
| FY 2023 | December 2022 (3 months late) | Omnibus |
| FY 2022 | March 2022 (6 months late) | Omnibus |
| FY 2021 | December 2020 (3 months late) | Omnibus |
| FY 2020 | December 2019 (3 months late) | 2 packages |

**Continuing Resolutions** (FY 2024):

- CR 1: September 30, 2023

- CR 2: November 17, 2023

- CR 3: January 19, 2024

- CR 4: February 2, 2024

- Final appropriations: March 2024

## Budget Resolution Status

### Congressional Budget Resolution

**Purpose**: Set overall spending and revenue levels

**Recent History**:

| Year | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| 2024 | Not adopted | Procedural disagreements |
| 2023 | Adopted | Used for reconciliation |
| 2022 | Adopted | Debt ceiling increase |
| 2021 | Adopted | American Rescue Plan |
| 2020 | Not adopted | Pandemic disruption |
| 2019 | Not adopted | Divided government |

**Consequence**: Without budget resolution:

- No reconciliation available

- No enforceable spending limits

- Appropriations proceed without framework

- Fiscal discipline mechanism absent

### Deeming Resolutions

When no budget resolution passes, Congress uses "deeming resolutions" to set spending allocations:

- Not comprehensive budget plan

- Sets appropriations caps only

- No revenue or mandatory spending guidance

- Workaround that perpetuates dysfunction

## Appropriations Breakdown

### The 12 Appropriations Bills

| Bill | Typical Status |
|------|----------------|
| Agriculture | Rarely passed separately |
| Commerce, Justice, Science | Sometimes passed |
| Defense | Highest priority, often passed |
| Energy and Water | Sometimes passed |
| Financial Services | Rarely passed separately |
| Homeland Security | Politically contentious |
| Interior | Contentious riders |
| Labor, HHS, Education | Largest, most contested |
| Legislative Branch | Usually passes |
| Military Construction, VA | Usually passes |
| State, Foreign Operations | Politically contentious |
| Transportation, HUD | Usually passes |

### Regular Order Collapse

**Last Time All 12 Passed on Time**: FY 1997 (1996)

**Typical Pattern**:

1. Some bills pass House, few pass Senate

2. Disagreements prevent conference

3. CR extends deadline

4. Negotiations produce omnibus or minibus

5. Passed under deadline pressure

### Continuing Resolution Dependency

**Types of CRs**:

| Type | Duration | Effect |
|------|----------|--------|
| Short-term | Days to weeks | Kicks can down road |
| Bridge | 1-3 months | Allows more negotiation |
| Full-year | Through fiscal year | Locks in previous levels |
| Anomalies | Varies | Specific adjustments in CR |

**Problems with CRs**:

- Freeze funding at prior year levels

- Prevent new programs from starting

- Block funding increases even when needed

- Create uncertainty for agencies

- Administrative burden of constant renewals

## Debt Ceiling Dynamics

### Current Status (2024 snapshot)

**Debt Limit History** (recent):

| Date | Action | Amount |
|------|--------|--------|
| June 2023 | Suspended | Until January 2025 |
| December 2021 | Raised | $31.4 trillion |
| October 2021 | Raised | $480 billion temporary |
| August 2019 | Suspended | Until July 2021 |
| February 2018 | Suspended | Until March 2019 |

### The Crisis Pattern

**Typical Debt Ceiling Standoff**:

1. **Approach**: Treasury announces extraordinary measures needed

2. **Brinkmanship**: Demands attached to increase

3. **Extraordinary measures**: Treasury extends deadline

4. **Market reaction**: Interest rates spike, volatility

5. **Last-minute deal**: Often suspended rather than raised

6. **Repeat**: Next deadline creates new crisis

### Economic Impact

**2011 Crisis**:

- First-ever credit rating downgrade (S&P)

- Stock market dropped 17%

- Consumer confidence plummeted

- Estimated $1.3 billion in increased borrowing costs

**2023 Near-Miss**:

- X-date in early June

- Deal reached June 3

- Fiscal Responsibility Act suspended ceiling

- But spending caps and other conditions attached

## Government Shutdowns

### Recent Shutdown History (2024 snapshot)

| Dates | Duration | Primary Issue |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| Dec 22, 2018 – Jan 25, 2019 | 35 days | Border wall funding |
| Jan 20–22, 2018 | 3 days | Immigration (DACA) |
| Jan 19–20, 2018 | Hours | Technical lapse |
| Oct 1–17, 2013 | 16 days | ACA defunding demand |

### 2018-2019 Shutdown (Longest Ever)

**Duration**: 35 days (December 22, 2018 - January 25, 2019)

**Cause**: Demand for $5.7 billion border wall funding

**Impact**:

- 800,000 federal workers affected

- 380,000 furloughed

- 420,000 worked without pay

- $3 billion permanent economic loss (CBO)

- $11 billion temporary impact

**Affected Services**:

- TSA agents worked unpaid (sickouts)

- National parks closed/unstaffed

- IRS delayed refunds

- Food safety inspections reduced

- Federal courts funding exhausted

### The Shutdown Process

**What Happens When Funding Lapses**:

1. **Immediate**: OMB orders shutdown procedures

2. **Essential functions**: Continue with excepted employees

3. **Non-essential**: Employees furloughed

4. **Contractors**: Work stops, unpaid

5. **Services**: Suspended or degraded

6. **Back pay**: Usually authorized retroactively for federal employees (not contractors)

## Reconciliation Usage

### Original Purpose vs. Current Practice

**1974 Act Intent**:

- Tool for deficit reduction

- Implement budget resolution targets

- Expedited procedure for fiscal adjustments

**Modern Reality**:

| Year | Legislation | Deficit Impact |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| 2021 | American Rescue Plan | +$1.9 trillion |
| 2017 | Tax Cuts and Jobs Act | +$1.5 trillion |
| 2010 | Health Care Education Reconciliation | Revenue increase |
| 2003 | Jobs and Growth Tax Relief | +$350 billion |
| 2001 | Economic Growth and Tax Relief | +$1.35 trillion |

### Byrd Rule Constraints

**What the Byrd Rule Blocks**:

- Provisions with no budget impact

- Provisions increasing deficit beyond budget window

- Changes to Social Security

- Provisions outside committee jurisdiction

**Workarounds**:

- Sunset provisions (expire before 10-year window ends)

- Careful drafting to include budget impact

- Vice President rulings to override parliamentarian

## Impoundment Issues

### Current Law

**Impoundment Control Act (1974)**:

- Prohibits executive branch from refusing to spend appropriated funds

- Requires rescission request for permanent cancellation

- Allows temporary deferral for limited purposes

- Congress can reject rescissions

### Recent Controversies

**Trump Administration Ukraine Aid (2019)**:

- OMB withheld $391 million in military aid

- No rescission request submitted

- GAO found impoundment illegal

- Central to first impeachment

**Biden Administration Discretion**:

- Questions about border wall funding

- Emergency declarations and spending

- Executive discretion vs. congressional appropriations

### Executive Budget Power Today

| Power | Status | Limitation |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Impoundment | Prohibited | Must spend appropriations |
| Rescission | Permitted | Congress must approve |
| Deferral | Limited | Only for specific reasons |
| Reprogramming | Permitted | Within limits, notification required |
| Transfer | Limited | Requires authorization |

## Earmarks

### Current Status

**History**:

- Banned in 2011 (House Republicans)

- Returned in 2021 as "Community Project Funding" (House Democrats)

- Republicans restored with reforms in 2023

**Current Rules**:

| Requirement | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| Member disclosure | Public list of requesters |
| No for-profit recipients | Only government, nonprofits |
| Cap on total amount | Usually 1% of discretionary |
| Committee vetting | Review of requests |
| No family benefit | Conflict of interest prohibition |

### The Earmark Debate

**Arguments For**:

- Congress should direct spending, not just agencies

- Local priorities better understood by members

- Greases legislative wheels

- Reduces executive discretion

**Arguments Against**:

- Invites corruption

- Bypasses merit-based allocation

- Wastes money on pet projects

- Distorts budget priorities

## Fiscal Outlook

### Current Trajectory (2024 snapshot)

**Federal Debt**:

- Gross debt: ~$34 trillion (2024 snapshot)

- Debt held by public: ~$27 trillion (2024 snapshot)

- Debt-to-GDP ratio: ~123% (2024 snapshot)

- Projected to rise indefinitely

**Annual Deficits**:

| Fiscal Year | Deficit |
|-------------|---------|
| FY 2024 | ~$1.9 trillion |
| FY 2023 | $1.7 trillion |
| FY 2022 | $1.4 trillion |
| FY 2021 | $2.8 trillion |
| FY 2020 | $3.1 trillion |

### Long-Term Projections (2024 snapshot)

**CBO 30-Year Outlook** (2024 projections):

- Debt-to-GDP: 180%+ by 2054

- Interest costs: Largest budget item

- Social Security: Trust fund depletion ~2033

- Medicare: Part A trust fund depletion ~2031

## Transparency and Public Access

### Budget Information Availability

**Public Resources**:

- USAspending.gov (spending data)

- Budget.gov (executive budget)

- CBO.gov (analysis and projections)

- Appropriations committee websites

**Limitations**:

- Tax expenditures poorly documented

- Off-budget items obscured

- Emergency spending difficult to track

- Continuing resolution spending hard to follow

### Timing Problems

**Information Gaps**:

- Budget passed months into fiscal year

- Actual spending data delayed

- Projections quickly outdated

- Real-time tracking limited

## International Comparison

### How Other Countries Budget

| Country | Process | Shutdown Possible |
|---------|---------|-------------------|
| UK | Automatic continuation | No |
| Germany | Automatic continuation | No |
| Canada | Confidence votes | No (election instead) |
| Australia | Caretaker provisions | No |
| France | Decree authority | No |

**US Unique Features**:

- Only country with regular shutdown risk

- Debt ceiling separate from appropriations

- Presidential budget not binding

- Bicameral disagreement routine

## Assessment

### Process Dysfunction Metrics

| Metric | Status | Trend |
|--------|--------|-------|
| On-time appropriations | 0% since 1996 | Stable failure |
| Budget resolution passage | Occasional | Declining |
| Debt ceiling crises | Regular | Worsening |
| Shutdown frequency | Multiple per decade | Stable high |
| CR dependency | Total | Entrenched |

### Consequences Summary

**Institutional**:

- Congress has ceded budget authority to crisis negotiations

- Regular order effectively dead

- Oversight of spending degraded

- Fiscal accountability absent

**Practical**:

- Agencies cannot plan effectively

- Programs disrupted routinely

- Federal workforce demoralized

- Contractors face uncertainty

**Economic**:

- Billions lost to shutdowns

- Market volatility from crises

- Borrowing costs elevated

- Business planning disrupted
