# Budget Process Reform: Root Causes

## Structural Causes

### The Congressional Budget Act's Design Flaws

**Unenforceable Deadlines**

| Deadline | Enforcement Mechanism | Reality |
|----------|----------------------|---------|
| President's budget (Feb 1) | None | Often late |
| Budget resolution (April 15) | Automatic deeming | Bypassed |
| Appropriations (Oct 1) | Government shutdown | Used as leverage |
| Reconciliation (June 15) | None | Rarely followed |

**The Enforcement Gap**:

- No penalty for missing deadlines

- Points of order can be waived

- Budget resolution non-binding

- No external enforcement body

### Separation of Authorization and Appropriation

**The Two-Step Problem**:

- Authorization creates programs, sets policy

- Appropriation provides annual funding

- Two different committee systems

- Coordination difficult

**How It Breaks Down**:

| Issue | Consequence |
|-------|-------------|
| Expired authorizations | Programs funded without policy review |
| Unauthorized appropriations | Routine, no enforcement |
| Jurisdiction disputes | Bills held up |
| Duplication | Multiple committees claim authority |

### Bicameral Disagreement

**House-Senate Differences**:

- Different timelines

- Different priorities

- Filibuster in Senate only

- Different appropriations subcommittees

**Conference Committee Collapse**:

- Fewer bills go to conference

- Leadership negotiations replace

- Rank-and-file excluded

- Regular order abandoned

## The Debt Ceiling Structural Flaw

### Fundamental Design Problem

**The Illogic**:

1. Congress authorizes spending

2. Congress appropriates funds

3. Executive spends as directed

4. Debt ceiling blocks borrowing to pay for already-authorized spending

5. Creates artificial crisis over past decisions

**Why It Exists**:

- Historical accident (1917 war financing)

- Made permanent without consideration (1939)

- Never designed as policy tool

- Has no fiscal policy function

### Asymmetric Political Incentives

**For the Minority/Opposition**:

- Free leverage point

- No blame for past spending decisions

- Crisis creates negotiating position

- Limited political cost

**For the Majority/President**:

- Responsible for avoiding default

- Must make concessions to govern

- Bears blame for economic harm

- No good options

## Political Causes

### Polarization and Budget Conflict

**Budget as Partisan Battleground**:

- Spending priorities reflect values

- Tax policy deeply contested

- Budget votes define parties

- Compromise seen as betrayal

**Polarization Metrics in Budget Votes**:

| Era | Bipartisan Budget Votes | Partisan Budget Votes |
|-----|------------------------|----------------------|
| 1970s | Common | Rare |
| 1990s | Occasional | Increasing |
| 2010s | Rare | Standard |
| 2020s | Almost none | Near-universal |

### Strategic Obstruction

**Dysfunction as Strategy**:

- Minority benefits from chaos

- Crisis creates leverage

- Government failure helps anti-government party

- No incentive for smooth operation

**Obstruction Tactics**:

| Tactic | How Used | Effect |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Poison pills | Attach controversial riders | Bills fail |
| Holds | Block nominations and bills | Delay |
| Filibuster | Require 60 votes | Gridlock |
| Shutdown threats | Demand policy changes | Brinksmanship |

### The End of Regular Order

**Why Leadership Controls Process**:

- Floor amendments unpredictable

- Rank-and-file "problem" votes

- Efficiency over deliberation

- Centralized power benefits leaders

**Consequences**:

- Members don't understand budget

- No ownership of outcomes

- Expertise concentrated in few

- Omnibus as only vehicle

## Institutional Causes

### Congressional Capacity Decline

**Budget Expertise Loss**:

| Resource | Status | Impact |
|----------|--------|--------|
| CBO | Underfunded relative to workload | Delayed scoring |
| Committee staff | Reduced | Less analysis |
| Member staff | High turnover | Institutional memory lost |
| OTA | Abolished (1995) | No technology analysis |

**Knowledge Asymmetry**:

- Executive branch has OMB, agency expertise

- Congress relies on outside analysis

- Lobbyists fill expertise gap

- Industry captures process

### Committee System Weakness

**Appropriations Committee Decline**:

- Less floor control over bills

- Amendments blocked or overwhelming

- Leadership bypasses committees

- Omnibus replaces individual bills

**Budget Committee Marginalization**:

- Resolutions often not passed

- Reconciliation instructions controversial

- No enforcement power

- Members cycle through

### Short Time Horizons

**Election Cycle Effects**:

| Time Horizon | Budget Behavior |
|--------------|-----------------|
| 2-year House terms | Avoid tough votes before election |
| 6-year Senate terms | More flexibility but uneven |
| Presidential cycles | First year active, last year frozen |
| Campaign season | October-November paralysis |

## Economic and Fiscal Causes

### Baseline Budgeting Problems

**How Baseline Budgeting Works**:

- Assumes current law continues

- Adjusts for inflation and population

- "Cuts" are reductions from projected increases

- Creates distorted political debate

**The Communication Problem**:

| Reality | Described As |
|---------|--------------|
| Spending increases 3% instead of 5% | "Cut" |
| Spending increases 5% as projected | "Flat" |
| Spending increases 8% | "Small increase" |
| Actual reduction in dollars | "Draconian cut" |

**Political Consequences**:

- Both parties manipulate baseline

- Public confused about actual changes

- CBO projections called partisan

- Honest debate impossible

### Mandatory Spending Growth

**The Budget Reality**:

| Category | % of Budget | Controllable Annually |
|----------|-------------|----------------------|
| Mandatory (entitlements) | 63% | No (requires law change) |
| Interest | 13% | No (must be paid) |
| Discretionary | 24% | Yes (appropriations) |

**The Squeeze**:

- Mandatory grows automatically

- Interest rises with debt

- Discretionary bears all cuts

- Annual appropriations become smaller share

### Unfunded Liabilities

**Long-Term Commitments**:

- Social Security: $22.4 trillion unfunded

- Medicare: $55 trillion+ unfunded

- Federal pensions: $5+ trillion unfunded

- No requirement to fund

**Why Ignored**:

- Not in annual budget

- Affects future, not present

- Politically difficult

- No enforcement mechanism

## Process Design Problems

### Reconciliation Corruption

**Original Purpose vs. Current Use**:

| Original Intent | Current Practice |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Deficit reduction | Major legislation of any type |
| End-of-process cleanup | Beginning of process policy |
| Budget-related only | Stretched interpretations |
| Bipartisan | Purely partisan tool |

**Byrd Rule Inadequacy**:

- Easy to work around

- Parliamentarian rulings inconsistent

- Vice President can overrule

- Sunsets game the 10-year window

### Continuing Resolution Incentives

**Why CRs Persist**:

| Stakeholder | CR Benefit |
|-------------|------------|
| Leadership | Consolidates power |
| Minority | Leverage in crisis |
| Members | Avoid tough votes |
| Agencies | Predictability (same as last year) |
| Lobbyists | Access to final negotiations |

**Self-Reinforcing Cycle**:

1. Regular order fails

2. CR buys time

3. Omnibus negotiated by few

4. No investment in regular process

5. Next year, repeat

### Omnibus Bill Incentives

**Why Omnibus Bills Dominate**:

- Must-pass vehicle for priorities

- Controversial items hidden

- No individual accountability

- Speed over deliberation

**Power Concentration**:

- Leadership controls content

- Members vote yes/no only

- No amendments possible

- Reading time inadequate

## Cultural and Behavioral Causes

### Loss of Fiscal Responsibility Norms

**Disappeared Norms**:

- Balanced budget as goal

- PAYGO as constraint

- Debt as problem to solve

- Appropriations on time

**Replacement Norms**:

- Deficits acceptable indefinitely

- Tax cuts don't need offsets (one party)

- Spending doesn't need offsets (other party)

- Crisis governance expected

### The Earmark Debate

**With Earmarks** (pre-2011):

- Incentive to pass bills

- Local projects for votes

- Corruption potential

- Spending growth

**Without Earmarks** (2011-2021):

- No incentive for hard votes

- Executive branch decides allocation

- Bills harder to pass

- No improvement in spending

**Return of Earmarks** (2021+):

- More transparent process

- Lower dollar amounts

- Partisan disagreement on use

- Uncertain impact

### Generational Irresponsibility

**Shifting Costs Forward**:

- Current benefits, future costs

- Deficit spending as norm

- Unfunded mandates

- Debt accumulation

**No Accountability**:

- Voters reward spending, punish taxes

- Future generations don't vote

- Long-term consequences discounted

- Political time horizon: next election

## Constitutional Design Issues

### No Budget in Constitution

**What's Missing**:

- No required budget process

- No balanced budget requirement

- No debt limitation

- No unified fiscal policy

**Consequences**:

- Process set by statute, easily changed

- No constitutional discipline

- Spending and borrowing unlimited

- Political constraints only

### Separation of Powers Tensions

**Budget Conflicts Built In**:

- President proposes, Congress disposes

- Neither can compel the other

- Veto forces negotiation or override

- Deadlock possible

**Impoundment Resolution Incomplete**:

- 1974 Act prohibits impoundment

- But enforcement uncertain

- Presidents test boundaries

- Courts slow to intervene

## Interconnected Causes

### The Dysfunction Feedback Loop

```text
Polarization → Obstruction → Missed Deadlines
     ↑                              ↓
Public Cynicism ← Crisis Governance ← CR/Shutdown
```

### Why Reform Is Difficult

| Reform | Blocked By |
|--------|------------|
| Automatic CR | Those who want shutdown leverage |
| Debt ceiling abolition | Those who want leverage |
| Biennial budgeting | Appropriators protecting turf |
| Reconciliation limits | Majority party wanting power |
| Earmark transparency | Mixed coalition |

### The Collective Action Problem

**Individual Incentives vs. Collective Good**:

- Each member benefits from dysfunction

- No single member can fix process

- Reform requires giving up leverage

- First mover disadvantaged
