## Individual Actions

### Educate Yourself

- Read CRS reports on budget process (free through member offices)

- Follow CBO publications and projections

- Track appropriations status at Congress.gov

- Understand difference between authorization, appropriation, debt ceiling

**Key Questions to Understand**:

- Why does Congress rarely pass budgets on time?

- What happens during a government shutdown?

- Why does the debt ceiling create crises?

- What reforms could fix these problems?

### Stay Informed

| Congress.gov | Bill status | Free |
| USASpending.gov | Spending data | Free |
| CRFB.org | Analysis, tracking | Free |

### Contact Representatives

**When to Contact**:

- Before CR votes

- Before debt ceiling votes

- When process reforms proposed

- During shutdown threats

**Effective Messages**:

| Topic | Message Frame |
|-------|---------------|
| Automatic CR | "End government-by-crisis" |
| Debt ceiling | "Don't threaten the economy" |
| Regular order | "Pass budgets on time" |
| Bipartisan reform | "Process over partisanship" |

**Sample Contact Points**:

*For Automatic CR*:
"I urge you to support legislation creating automatic continuing resolutions. Government shutdowns waste taxpayer money and harm federal workers and the communities that depend on government services. Other democracies don't have this problem, and neither should we."

*For Debt Ceiling Reform*:
"Please support reforming or eliminating the debt ceiling. The ceiling doesn't control spending -- it only creates artificial crises over debts already incurred. Threatening default damages our economy and our credit rating. Let's separate the debt ceiling from political brinksmanship."
