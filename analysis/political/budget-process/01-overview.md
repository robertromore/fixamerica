# Budget Process Reform: Overview

## Executive Summary

The federal budget process is fundamentally broken. The Congressional Budget Act of 1974, designed to give Congress control over fiscal policy, has failed spectacularly. Government shutdowns, debt ceiling crises, continuing resolutions, and omnibus bills have replaced orderly budgeting. The result is fiscal chaos that undermines effective governance, creates uncertainty, and prevents long-term planning.

## The Core Problem

### What's Broken

**Process Failures (2024 snapshot)**

| Symptom | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| No regular budgets | Congress hasn't passed all appropriations on time since 1996 |
| Shutdown threats | 21 shutdowns since 1976, weaponized as political leverage |
| Debt ceiling crises | Regular brinksmanship threatening default |
| Continuing resolutions | Government funded by stopgap measures |

**Structural Dysfunction**

| Problem | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Budget Act failures | Deadlines routinely ignored, no enforcement |
| Reconciliation abuse | Process designed for deficit reduction used for partisan bills |
| Baseline budgeting | Assumes automatic spending increases |
| Earmark battles | Banned, partially returned, still controversial |

**Timeline Collapse**

| Deadline | Required | Reality |
|----------|----------|---------|
| President's budget | First Monday in February | Often late |
| Budget resolution | April 15 | Rarely passed on time |
| Appropriations bills | October 1 | Almost never completed |
| Fiscal year end | September 30 | CR or shutdown |

## Why This Matters

### For Governance

**Inability to Plan**

- Agencies cannot make long-term commitments

- Contractors face uncertainty

- Programs cannot be managed effectively

- Federal workforce demoralized

**Policy Paralysis**

| Area | Budget Impact |
|------|---------------|
| Defense | Multi-year procurement disrupted |
| Research | Grant cycles interrupted |
| Infrastructure | Projects delayed or cancelled |
| Social programs | Inconsistent funding |

### For the Economy

**Economic Damage from Dysfunction**

- Government shutdowns cost billions

- Debt ceiling crises shake markets

- Federal contractors laid off and rehired

- Consumer and business confidence damaged

**2013 Shutdown Impact**:

- 16 days, $24 billion economic cost

- 850,000 federal workers furloughed

- $3.1 billion in lost government services

- Credit rating agencies issued warnings

### For Democracy

**Public Trust Erosion**

- Citizens see government as incompetent

- Basic functions held hostage

- Partisanship over governance

- Cynicism about institutions

## Historical Context

### The Congressional Budget Act of 1974

**Intent**:

- Give Congress independent budget authority

- Counter Nixon's impoundments

- Create orderly process with deadlines

- Establish CBO for independent analysis

**Reality**:

- Deadlines routinely missed

- Budget resolutions often abandoned

- Process manipulated for partisan advantage

- Original intent forgotten

### Key Failures Timeline (2024 snapshot)

| Year | Crisis |
|------|--------|
| 1995-96 | 27-day shutdown over Medicare/budget |
| 2011 | Debt ceiling crisis, credit downgrade |
| 2013 | 16-day shutdown over ACA |
| 2018-19 | 35-day shutdown, longest in history |
| 2023 | Debt ceiling standoff to last minute |

### Evolution of Dysfunction

**1970s-80s**: Budget Act generally followed

**1990s**: Shutdowns as political weapon

**2000s**: Continuing resolutions normalized

**2010s**: Debt ceiling weaponized

**2020s**: Crisis governance as default

## Key Dimensions

### Budget Process Elements

**Authorization vs. Appropriation**

| Process | Function | Problem |
|---------|----------|---------|
| Authorization | Creates programs, sets policy | Often expires, ignored |
| Appropriation | Funds programs annually | Collapsed into CRs/omnibus |
| Both required | Sequential process | Steps skipped constantly |

**Budget Resolution**

- Non-binding concurrent resolution

- Sets overall spending and revenue targets

- Enables reconciliation procedures

- Often not passed at all

**Reconciliation**

- Expedited procedure to meet budget targets

- Cannot be filibustered in Senate

- Originally for deficit reduction

- Now used for major partisan legislation

### Debt Ceiling

**The Problem**:

- Arbitrary limit on borrowing

- Doesn't control spending (already appropriated)

- Creates artificial crisis points

- Threatens default and economic chaos

**History**:

- Created 1917, made permanent 1939

- Raised routinely until 1990s

- Now political leverage tool

- Closest calls: 2011, 2013, 2023

### Government Shutdowns

**Causes**:

1. Failure to pass appropriations

2. Political disputes attached to funding

3. Brinksmanship strategy

4. Breakdown in negotiations

**Consequences**:

- Federal workers unpaid

- Essential services disrupted

- Contractors laid off

- Economic damage

### Key Topics

| Area | Coverage |

## Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Appropriation | Annual funding legislation |
| Authorization | Law creating program and setting policy |
| Budget resolution | Congressional budget blueprint (non-binding) |
| Continuing resolution (CR) | Temporary funding extension |
| Debt ceiling | Legal limit on federal borrowing |
| Impoundment | Executive refusal to spend appropriated funds |
| Omnibus bill | Large package combining appropriations |
| Reconciliation | Expedited budget procedure |
| Sequestration | Automatic spending cuts |
| Baseline budgeting | Projecting spending assuming current law |

## The Stakes

### What Reform Could Enable

**Functional Governance**

- Predictable funding for agencies

- Long-term planning possible

- End to shutdown crises

- Debt ceiling eliminated as weapon

**Better Policy**

- Programs designed for effectiveness

- Multi-year commitments possible

- Evidence-based budgeting

- Fiscal sustainability focus

### What Continued Dysfunction Means

**Perpetual Crisis**

- Annual shutdown threats

- Debt ceiling brinksmanship continues

- Governance by continuing resolution

- No long-term fiscal planning

**Democratic Erosion**

- Public faith in government destroyed

- Essential services unreliable

- Political leverage over basic functions

- Constitutional crisis potential
