# Budget Process Reform: Solutions

## Debt Ceiling Reform

### Option 1: Abolition

**Description**: Eliminate the debt ceiling entirely.

**How It Would Work**:

- Repeal debt limit statute

- Authorization to borrow implied by appropriations

- Treasury borrows as needed to fund appropriated spending

- No separate vote on borrowing

**Precedent**:

- Most countries have no debt ceiling

- US functioned without until 1917

- Current debt ceiling serves no fiscal purpose

**Pros**:

- Eliminates crisis entirely

- Reduces uncertainty

- Lowers borrowing costs

- Removes political weapon

**Cons**:

- Perceived loss of fiscal discipline

- Politically difficult to pass

- Seen as "enabling" borrowing

- Opposition strong

### Option 2: Automatic Increase (Gephardt Rule)

**Description**: Debt ceiling automatically increases when budget resolution or appropriations pass.

**Historical Basis**:

- Named after Rep. Richard Gephardt

- House rule from 1979-1995

- "Deemed" debt ceiling increase when budget resolution passed

**How It Would Work**:

- Debt ceiling increases automatically to cover appropriated spending

- No separate vote required

- Congress still votes on spending

- Borrowing follows logically from spending decisions

**Pros**:

- Maintains nominal ceiling

- Politically easier than abolition

- Already has precedent

- Eliminates separate crisis

**Cons**:

- Could be repealed by future Congress

- Still allows symbolic votes

- Doesn't address underlying spending

### Option 3: Mcconnell Mechanism

**Description**: Shift burden to Congress to disapprove increases.

**How It Would Work**:

- President requests debt ceiling increase

- Congress can disapprove by joint resolution

- President vetoes disapproval

- Requires 2/3 to override (unlikely)

**Used In**:

- 2011 Budget Control Act

- Several subsequent increases

**Pros**:

- Allows Congress to vote against

- President takes political ownership

- Default averted absent supermajority

- Has worked in practice

**Cons**:

- Complicated procedure

- Temporary fixes each time

- Still creates periodic drama

- Uncertainty remains

## Shutdown Prevention

### Automatic Continuing Resolution

**Description**: If appropriations not enacted, funding continues automatically at prior year levels.

**How It Would Work**:

- October 1 arrives without appropriations

- Automatic CR triggers at prior year levels

- Continues until new appropriations pass

- Optional: Automatic reduction (e.g., 1%) after certain period to encourage action

**Variations**:

| Option | Level | Duration | Incentive |
|--------|-------|----------|-----------|
| Basic | Prior year | Until appropriations | None built in |
| Declining | Prior year minus 1%/quarter | Until appropriations | Pass bills to restore funding |
| Indexed | Prior year + inflation | Until appropriations | Reduces pressure |

**Pros**:

- No more shutdowns

- Services continue

- Federal workers paid

- Basic government functions protected

**Cons**:

- Reduces pressure to pass bills

- May freeze in undesirable levels

- Doesn't address fundamental process issues

- Could reduce appropriators' power

### "No Budget, No Pay" for Congress

**Description**: Members of Congress don't get paid if budget not passed on time.

**How It Would Work**:

- 27th Amendment: Pay changes don't take effect until after election

- Escrow member pay until appropriations pass

- Back pay upon completion

- Symbolic pressure

**Reality Check**:

- Most members wealthy enough to not care

- May be unconstitutional (27th Amendment)

- Symbolic more than practical

- Passed House multiple times, not enacted

**Pros**:

- Popular with public

- Creates personal incentive

- Simple concept

**Cons**:

- Unlikely to change behavior

- Constitutional issues

- Wealthy members unaffected

- Penalizes poorer members disproportionately

## Process Modernization

### Biennial Budgeting

**Description**: Two-year budget cycle instead of annual.

**How It Would Work**:

- First year: Full budget and appropriations process

- Second year: Oversight and adjustments only

- Reduces workload

- Allows more oversight time

**State Examples**:

- 19 states use biennial budgeting

- Generally successful

- Allows longer-term planning

**Proposed Federal Structure**:

| Year 1 | Year 2 |
|--------|--------|
| Budget resolution | Oversight hearings |
| 12 appropriations bills | Supplementals only |
| Authorization review | Program evaluation |
| Multi-year commitments | Adjustments as needed |

**Pros**:

- More time for deliberation

- Better oversight

- Multi-year planning possible

- Reduces perpetual crisis

**Cons**:

- Appropriators lose annual control

- Less responsive to changes

- Transition difficult

- May just push crisis to every two years

### Timeline Reform

**Current vs. Proposed**:

| Action | Current Deadline | Proposed |
|--------|------------------|----------|
| President's budget | First Monday February | December 1 |
| CBO analysis | February 15 | January 15 |
| Budget resolution | April 15 | March 1 |
| Appropriations | October 1 | July 1 |
| Reconciliation | June 15 | April 15 |

**Rationale**:

- Earlier start provides more time

- Appropriations done before August recess

- Reduces year-end crisis

- Allows conference and negotiation

### Enhanced Budget Resolution Enforcement

**Current Problem**: Budget resolutions are non-binding, easily ignored.

**Proposed Solutions**:

| Reform | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Joint resolution | Make budget resolution binding law |
| Stronger points of order | Require 60 votes to waive |
| Automatic enforcement | Sequestration if resolution violated |
| Public reporting | Scorecard of compliance |

## Reconciliation Reform

### Restore Original Purpose

**Problems to Address**:

- Used for major policy, not budget cleanup

- Byrd Rule circumvented

- Deficit-increasing legislation allowed

- Originally deficit reduction only

**Proposed Reforms**:

| Reform | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Deficit reduction only | Reconciliation cannot increase deficit |
| Genuine budget impact | Higher threshold for inclusion |
| No policy riders | Only fiscal provisions |
| Sunset prohibition | No provisions designed to expire |

### Strengthen Byrd Rule

**Current Weaknesses**:

- Provisions game 10-year window

- Parliamentarian can be overruled

- "Merely incidental" loosely interpreted

- Exemptions exploited

**Proposed Strengthening**:

| Loophole | Fix |
|----------|-----|
| Sunset gaming | Include full cost regardless of expiration |
| VP override | Remove VP authority to overrule |
| Incidental test | Stricter definition required |
| Social Security | Enforce existing prohibition strictly |

## Impoundment Control

### Strengthen Existing Law

**Current Problem**: Executive branch tests boundaries, enforcement unclear.

**Proposed Reforms**:

- GAO reporting mandatory and timely

- Automatic release if Congress doesn't act on rescission

- Civil penalties for unauthorized impoundment

- Standing for Congress to sue

### Clarify Authorities

**Current Ambiguity**: What counts as deferral vs. impoundment?

**Proposed Clarification**:

| Action | Status | Requirements |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Apportionment | Permitted | Must spend by end of period |
| Administrative delay | Permitted | Must be brief, documented |
| Policy deferral | Prohibited | Unless rescission requested |
| Impoundment | Prohibited | No exceptions |

## Earmark Reform

### Transparency Requirements

**Proposed Standards**:

- All requests public before markup

- Member name and justification required

- No for-profit recipients

- Independent cost estimates

- Geographic and member caps

### Merit-Based Process

**Proposed Process**:

1. Members submit requests publicly

2. Committee staff evaluate merit

3. Independent agency review (GAO)

4. Public comment period

5. Committee approval with recorded vote

## Fiscal Responsibility Measures

### Long-Term Budget Framework

**Proposed Elements**:

- 30-year fiscal projections required

- Unfunded liabilities reported

- Generational accounting included

- Automatic stabilizers evaluated

### Fiscal Rules Options

| Rule Type | Description | Example Countries |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Balanced budget | Require balance over cycle | Switzerland, Germany |
| Debt brake | Limit debt-to-GDP ratio | Germany, Sweden |
| Expenditure rule | Cap spending growth | Netherlands, Sweden |
| Golden rule | Only borrow for investment | UK (formerly) |

### PAYGO Restoration

**Proposed Strengthening**:

- Apply to both spending and taxes

- No emergency exemptions without supermajority

- Automatic sequestration for violations

- CBO scoring binding

## Comprehensive Reform Package

| Biennial budgeting | Good government groups, oversight advocates |
| Earmark reform | Transparency advocates, fiscal conservatives |

### Avoiding Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Avoidance Strategy |
|---------|---------------------|
| Seen as partisan | Bipartisan sponsorship essential |
| Removes "leverage" | Emphasize governance over politics |
| Reduces accountability | Build in oversight mechanisms |
| Too complicated | Phase implementation |
