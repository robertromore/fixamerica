# Budget Process Reform: Political Perspectives Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes budget process reform through nine distinct political perspectives, evaluating current state assessments, root cause analyses, proposed solutions, and legislation. Each perspective receives faith-level ratings and position scores, culminating in compromise proposals that bridge multiple viewpoints.

Budget process reform is unusual in that it creates strange bedfellows: fiscal conservatives and progressives may both want process reforms but for opposite policy reasons. The key insight is that positions on budget *process* often reflect desired *outcomes* rather than principled process views.

## Perspective Definitions

| Perspective | Core Values | Policy Orientation |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Tradition, limited government, individual responsibility | Incremental change, fiscal restraint, market solutions |
| Liberal | Progress, equality, social responsibility | Government as problem-solver, regulation, safety nets |
| Progressive | Systemic change, economic justice, structural reform | Transformative reform, wealth redistribution, worker power |
| Libertarian | Individual liberty, minimal state, free markets | Deregulation, privatization, voluntary association |
| Constitutionalist | Original intent, enumerated powers, federalism | Strict constitutional limits, states' rights |
| Populist | Anti-elite, pro-worker, economic nationalism | Trade protection, anti-monopoly, immigration restriction |
| Centrist | Pragmatism, compromise, incremental progress | Bipartisan solutions, evidence-based policy |
| Religious Right | Faith-based values, traditional morality | Social conservatism, religious liberty |
| Democratic Socialist | Worker ownership, public goods, democratic control | Public investment, labor rights, universal programs |

## Perspective Analyses

### Conservative Perspective

#### Faith Level Assessment

**Score: 2/5 - Mostly Bad Faith**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Major divergence: fiscal responsibility rhetoric contradicted by deficit-increasing tax cuts; debt ceiling used as leverage not principle |
| Principle consistency | Very inconsistent: deficits acceptable for tax cuts but not spending; fiscal rules demanded under Democrats, ignored under Republicans |
| Goalpost stability | Highly unstable: debt ceiling treated as critical under Obama, raised routinely under Trump, weaponized again under Biden |
| Zero-sum behavior | High: budget crises manufactured for political leverage; shutdown threats used strategically |

**Justification:** Conservative positions on budget process are deeply strategic rather than principled. The same Republicans who refused to raise the debt ceiling under Obama did so repeatedly under Trump without conditions. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act added $1.5 trillion to deficits through reconciliation—the exact tool conservatives claim to oppose when used for spending. Shutdown threats and debt ceiling brinksmanship are deployed almost exclusively when Democrats hold the presidency. The "fiscal responsibility" frame is largely pretext for reducing spending on programs conservatives oppose.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- **Debt ceiling hypocrisy:** Republicans voted to raise or suspend the debt ceiling three times under Trump without conditions, then demanded concessions under Biden (2023 Fiscal Responsibility Act).
- **Deficit spending acceptance:** 2017 TCJA increased deficits by $1.5 trillion; 2020 COVID spending under Trump added trillions without fiscal hawk objections.
- **Reconciliation abuse:** Used reconciliation for deficit-increasing tax cuts (2001, 2003, 2017) while claiming process should be for deficit reduction only.
- **Shutdown leverage:** 2013 and 2018-19 shutdowns initiated by Republican demands (ACA defunding, border wall); 35-day shutdown in 2018-19 was longest ever.
- **PAYGO suspension:** Republicans repeatedly suspended PAYGO for tax cuts while demanding it for spending.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | Agrees process is broken; disputes emphasis on debt ceiling as problem; sees spending as cause, not process |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | Disagrees spending is appropriate; sees mandatory entitlement growth as root cause; disputes that process reforms would help without spending cuts |

**Source references:**

- Heritage Foundation budget analyses calling for spending caps and entitlement reform.
- Republican Study Committee fiscal policy positions.
- Club for Growth opposition to debt ceiling increases without cuts.
- Congressional Republican statements on fiscal responsibility (compare 2017 vs 2021).

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Debt Ceiling Abolition | 2/10 | "Removes fiscal discipline and enables unlimited spending" | Loses leverage point for demanding spending cuts |
| Automatic Debt Ceiling Increase | 3/10 | "Still enables irresponsible spending without accountability" | Same leverage concern |
| McConnell Mechanism | 5/10 | "Allows political positioning while avoiding default" | McConnell created it; allows votes against without consequence |
| Automatic Continuing Resolution | 4/10 | "Removes pressure to cut spending; locks in bloated baseline" | Loses shutdown leverage |
| "No Budget, No Pay" | 7/10 | "Members should face consequences for failure" | Popular with base; symbolic |
| Biennial Budgeting | 6/10 | "Could reduce crisis frequency but needs spending controls" | Some genuine support for efficiency |
| Timeline Reform | 5/10 | "Earlier deadlines won't help without spending discipline" | Process agnostic; focus on outcomes |
| Enhanced Budget Resolution Enforcement | 6/10 | "Enforceable caps could be good if set correctly" | Support depends on cap levels |
| Reconciliation Reform (Deficit Reduction Only) | 3/10 | "Would prevent necessary tax reform" | Want to keep reconciliation for tax cuts |
| Strengthen Byrd Rule | 3/10 | "Parliamentarian already too powerful; VP should decide" | Want to override Byrd Rule for priorities |
| Strengthen Impoundment Control | 2/10 | "President needs flexibility to manage spending" | Support executive discretion to not spend |
| Earmark Transparency | 7/10 | "If earmarks return, transparency essential" | Split: some want earmarks for coalition building |
| Long-Term Budget Framework | 5/10 | "Only meaningful if includes entitlement reform" | Want framework to force entitlement cuts |
| Fiscal Rules (Balanced Budget) | 8/10 | "Balanced budget amendment needed for real discipline" | Long-standing priority; constitutional approach |
| PAYGO Restoration | 4/10 | "Only if applies equally to tax cuts and spending" | Historically opposed for tax cuts |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Debt Ceiling Reform Act | 2/10 | "Unconstitutional delegation; removes congressional control over borrowing" | Removes leverage |
| No Budget No Pay Act | 7/10 | "Good accountability measure" | Popular; previously supported |
| Prevent Government Shutdowns Act | 3/10 | "Removes urgency for fiscal responsibility" | Loses shutdown leverage |
| Budget Process Reform Act | 5/10 | "Some good provisions but reconciliation limits problematic" | Mixed depending on specific provisions |

#### Alternative Proposals

Conservatives would prefer:

1. **Balanced Budget Amendment:** Constitutional requirement to balance budget annually or over business cycle.

2. **Spending Caps:** Hard statutory caps on discretionary and mandatory spending.

3. **Entitlement Reform:** Convert Medicare to premium support; Social Security adjustments.

4. **Line-Item Veto:** Give President power to veto individual spending items.

5. **Impoundment Revival:** Restore presidential authority to not spend appropriated funds.

6. **Sunset Provisions:** Require reauthorization of all programs periodically.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Libertarian (on spending cuts), Constitutionalist (on balanced budget amendment)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (on some process reforms), Populist (on earmark transparency)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist, Liberal (fundamental disagreement on spending levels)

---

### Liberal Perspective

#### Faith Level Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Good Faith**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Generally aligned: support for automatic CR and debt ceiling reform reflects genuine belief in government function; want to remove leverage for spending cuts |
| Principle consistency | Mostly consistent: have consistently opposed shutdown brinksmanship and debt ceiling crises; some inconsistency on earmarks |
| Goalpost stability | Stable: same core positions on preventing shutdowns across administrations |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low: genuinely want functional process, not just partisan advantage |

**Justification:** Liberal positions on budget process reflect genuine concern for government functionality and opposition to brinksmanship. Democrats have consistently supported raising the debt ceiling without conditions and preventing shutdowns, regardless of which party controls government. The automatic CR concept has bipartisan good-government origins. Some reduction from full good faith for strategic use of reconciliation for spending priorities (though less hypocritical than conservative tax cut usage since reconciliation was originally for deficit reduction, and ARP was crisis response).

**Evidence for assessment:**

- **Consistent debt ceiling position:** Democrats voted to raise ceiling under Bush, Obama, Trump without manufacturing crises.
- **Shutdown opposition:** Democratic administrations have not initiated shutdowns; 2013 and 2018-19 were Republican-initiated.
- **Bipartisan good government:** Support for automatic CR has come from both parties' good-government wings.
- **Reconciliation use:** Used for ACA fixes (2010) and ARP (2021), both significant but less deficit-increasing than TCJA.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Strongly agrees process is broken; accepts framing of debt ceiling and shutdowns as manufactured crises |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | Agrees with root cause analysis; would emphasize strategic obstruction more |

**Source references:**

- Brookings Institution budget process analyses.
- Center on Budget and Policy Priorities research.
- Democratic Party platform positions on fiscal policy.
- Congressional Democratic statements on budget process.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Debt Ceiling Abolition | 9/10 | "Long overdue; debt ceiling serves no legitimate purpose" | Removes Republican leverage for spending cuts |
| Automatic Debt Ceiling Increase | 8/10 | "Good compromise if abolition not possible" | Second-best option |
| McConnell Mechanism | 6/10 | "Acceptable temporary fix but not solution" | Prefers permanent reform |
| Automatic Continuing Resolution | 9/10 | "Essential to protect federal workers and services" | High priority |
| "No Budget, No Pay" | 5/10 | "Symbolic but doesn't address structural issues" | Concerns about constitutionality and effectiveness |
| Biennial Budgeting | 6/10 | "Mixed; could help or just push crisis to every two years" | Some skepticism about effectiveness |
| Timeline Reform | 7/10 | "Earlier deadlines could help if enforced" | Moderate support |
| Enhanced Budget Resolution Enforcement | 7/10 | "Joint resolution good idea; enforcement mechanisms needed" | Want binding budget |
| Reconciliation Reform (Deficit Reduction Only) | 5/10 | "Would limit policy options but could support if symmetric" | Concerned about losing tool for priorities |
| Strengthen Byrd Rule | 6/10 | "Reasonable to prevent abuse but current enforcement acceptable" | Moderate support |
| Strengthen Impoundment Control | 8/10 | "Executive should not be able to override Congress on spending" | Strong support |
| Earmark Transparency | 7/10 | "Transparency good; earmarks can be useful for governing" | Support with transparency |
| Long-Term Budget Framework | 7/10 | "Long-term thinking valuable if not used to cut entitlements" | Conditional support |
| Fiscal Rules (Balanced Budget) | 4/10 | "Balanced budget requirement would force austerity in recessions" | Oppose constitutional amendment |
| PAYGO Restoration | 6/10 | "Reasonable if applies to both taxes and spending symmetrically" | Conditional support |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Debt Ceiling Reform Act | 9/10 | "Excellent solution to manufactured crises" | Strong support |
| No Budget No Pay Act | 5/10 | "Symbolic but doesn't address real problems" | Lukewarm |
| Prevent Government Shutdowns Act | 9/10 | "Essential protection for workers and services" | Strong support |
| Budget Process Reform Act | 7/10 | "Good framework; some provisions concerning" | Support with modifications |

#### Alternative Proposals

Liberals would add:

1. **Debt Ceiling Repeal:** Complete elimination rather than automatic increase.

2. **Stronger Impoundment Enforcement:** Automatic release of funds if rescission not approved.

3. **Tax Expenditure Review:** Include tax breaks in budget process more transparently.

4. **Emergency Spending Reform:** Clearer criteria but preserve flexibility for genuine emergencies.

5. **CBO Capacity Building:** More resources for budget analysis and long-term projections.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist (on removing austerity leverage), Centrist (on functional process)
- **Potential bridges:** Conservative (on earmark transparency), some Populists (on anti-elite process reforms)
- **Unlikely partners:** Hard fiscal conservatives, Constitutionalists on balanced budget

### Progressive Perspective

#### Faith Level Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Good Faith**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Well aligned: want to remove austerity leverage; genuinely believe government should function |
| Principle consistency | Consistent: have opposed shutdown brinksmanship consistently; support for automatic mechanisms not just when convenient |
| Goalpost stability | Stable: same anti-austerity position over time |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low-moderate: want process reforms partly to enable progressive policy, but process concerns genuine |

**Justification:** Progressive positions on budget process stem from genuine belief that manufactured crises are used to impose austerity and cut social programs. Progressives have consistently opposed using the debt ceiling and shutdowns as leverage, recognizing these tactics primarily harm ordinary people while serving elite interests. Some reduction from full good faith because progressives also want to use budget process (reconciliation) for transformative legislation, creating some tension with process reform principles.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- **Anti-austerity consistency:** Progressive Caucus has consistently opposed cuts demanded through debt ceiling hostage-taking.
- **Reconciliation use:** Supported ARP through reconciliation; would support future social spending this way.
- **Worker focus:** Emphasis on protecting federal workers and services during shutdowns.
- **Critique of fiscal rules:** Oppose balanced budget amendment as austerity mechanism.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strongly agrees process is broken and serves elite interests in imposing austerity |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | Agrees with root causes; would emphasize anti-government ideology and corporate influence more |

**Source references:**

- Congressional Progressive Caucus budget priorities.
- Economic Policy Institute budget process analyses.
- People's Policy Project and similar progressive think tanks.
- Bernie Sanders and progressive caucus statements on budget process.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Debt Ceiling Abolition | 10/10 | "Abolish immediately; tool for economic terrorism" | Highest priority |
| Automatic Debt Ceiling Increase | 8/10 | "Acceptable but abolition better" | Second best |
| McConnell Mechanism | 5/10 | "Band-aid that doesn't fix fundamental problem" | Too incremental |
| Automatic Continuing Resolution | 9/10 | "Protects workers from manufactured crises" | Strong support |
| "No Budget, No Pay" | 4/10 | "Punishes wrong people; wealthy members unaffected" | Skeptical of effectiveness |
| Biennial Budgeting | 5/10 | "Could reduce crisis frequency but concerns about responsiveness" | Mixed views |
| Timeline Reform | 6/10 | "Earlier deadlines fine but not solution to political obstruction" | Process agnostic |
| Enhanced Budget Resolution Enforcement | 6/10 | "Depends on what's being enforced; could lock in austerity" | Conditional |
| Reconciliation Reform (Deficit Reduction Only) | 4/10 | "Would prevent necessary investments in people" | Oppose limiting reconciliation |
| Strengthen Byrd Rule | 4/10 | "Current rules already too restrictive" | Would prefer weakening |
| Strengthen Impoundment Control | 9/10 | "Executive can't override democratic spending decisions" | Strong support |
| Earmark Transparency | 6/10 | "Transparency fine; earmarks can help or hurt depending on use" | Neutral on earmarks themselves |
| Long-Term Budget Framework | 5/10 | "Long-term thinking good but often used for austerity scaremongering" | Skeptical of fiscal hawk framing |
| Fiscal Rules (Balanced Budget) | 2/10 | "Balanced budget amendment is austerity trap" | Strongly oppose |
| PAYGO Restoration | 3/10 | "PAYGO prevents necessary public investment" | Oppose |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Debt Ceiling Reform Act | 9/10 | "Good but abolition would be better" | Strong support |
| No Budget No Pay Act | 4/10 | "Doesn't address real problems; penalizes poorer members" | Skeptical |
| Prevent Government Shutdowns Act | 9/10 | "Essential worker protection" | Strong support |
| Budget Process Reform Act | 5/10 | "Mixed; some good, but reconciliation limits and fiscal rules concerning" | Conditional support |

#### Alternative Proposals

Progressives would prefer:

1. **Debt Ceiling Repeal:** Complete abolition, not just reform.

2. **Reconciliation Expansion:** Loosen Byrd Rule to allow more policy through reconciliation.

3. **Investment Framework:** Replace deficit focus with public investment framework.

4. **Functional Finance:** Budget process that focuses on economic outcomes, not arbitrary balance.

5. **No Austerity Triggers:** Remove all automatic spending cut mechanisms (sequestration, etc.).

6. **Public Banking Integration:** Include Federal Reserve in budget accountability.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Democratic Socialist (on anti-austerity), Liberal (on shutdown prevention, debt ceiling)
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (on anti-elite framing), some Libertarians (on opposing corporate welfare)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative, Religious Right, Constitutionalist (fundamental disagreement on fiscal policy)

### Libertarian Perspective

#### Faith Level Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Good Faith**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Generally aligned: genuine belief in limited government and fiscal discipline; consistent across parties |
| Principle consistency | Mostly consistent: oppose deficits regardless of cause (tax cuts or spending); criticize both parties |
| Goalpost stability | Stable: same limited government principles over time |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low: criticize both parties' fiscal irresponsibility; not purely partisan |

**Justification:** Libertarian positions on budget process reflect genuine commitment to limited government and fiscal discipline. Unlike conservatives, libertarians have consistently criticized deficit-increasing tax cuts as well as spending. Cato Institute and similar organizations oppose corporate welfare and military spending as much as social spending. Support for fiscal rules and process reforms is principled rather than strategic, though libertarians would prefer simply spending less rather than process reforms.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- **Bipartisan criticism:** Cato criticized Bush, Obama, Trump, and Biden deficits equally.
- **Tax cut skepticism:** Support tax cuts only when paired with spending cuts.
- **Corporate welfare opposition:** Oppose subsidies, bailouts, and crony capitalism.
- **Consistent limited government:** Same principles across administrations.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 7/10 | Agrees process is broken; focuses more on spending levels than process |
| Root Cause Agreement | 6/10 | Agrees with some causes but sees fundamental problem as spending levels, not process |

**Source references:**

- Cato Institute budget analyses and fiscal policy papers.
- Reason Foundation budget coverage.
- Libertarian Party platform on fiscal policy.
- Downsize DC and other libertarian advocacy positions.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Debt Ceiling Abolition | 3/10 | "Removes one of few remaining constraints on spending" | Prefers actual spending cuts |
| Automatic Debt Ceiling Increase | 4/10 | "Makes borrowing too easy" | Same concern |
| McConnell Mechanism | 5/10 | "Allows political posturing without real discipline" | Sees as theater |
| Automatic Continuing Resolution | 4/10 | "Locks in spending; removes pressure to cut" | Prefers shutdown to continued spending |
| "No Budget, No Pay" | 6/10 | "Good symbolism but won't change behavior" | Supports accountability |
| Biennial Budgeting | 6/10 | "Could reduce workload; focus on oversight" | Some support |
| Timeline Reform | 5/10 | "Process tweaks won't solve spending problem" | Neutral |
| Enhanced Budget Resolution Enforcement | 6/10 | "Enforceable caps could help if set at lower levels" | Support depends on levels |
| Reconciliation Reform (Deficit Reduction Only) | 7/10 | "Reconciliation should reduce deficits, not increase them" | Principled support |
| Strengthen Byrd Rule | 7/10 | "Prevent policy riders that increase spending" | Support |
| Strengthen Impoundment Control | 3/10 | "Executive should be able to not spend wasteful appropriations" | Prefer executive discretion |
| Earmark Transparency | 8/10 | "All spending should be transparent" | Strong support |
| Long-Term Budget Framework | 7/10 | "Long-term thinking essential for fiscal sustainability" | Support |
| Fiscal Rules (Balanced Budget) | 8/10 | "Balanced budget would force discipline" | Strong support |
| PAYGO Restoration | 7/10 | "Both spending and tax changes should be paid for" | Consistent position |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Debt Ceiling Reform Act | 3/10 | "Removes constraint on government growth" | Oppose |
| No Budget No Pay Act | 6/10 | "Good accountability measure but won't solve fundamental problem" | Moderate support |
| Prevent Government Shutdowns Act | 3/10 | "Shutdowns may be necessary to force spending cuts" | Prefer shutdown risk |
| Budget Process Reform Act | 5/10 | "Some good fiscal rules; some provisions enable more spending" | Mixed |

#### Alternative Proposals

Libertarians would prefer:

1. **Spending Cuts First:** Reduce spending to sustainable levels, then process reforms.

2. **Constitutional Spending Limit:** Cap federal spending at percentage of GDP.

3. **Sunset All Programs:** Automatic expiration requiring reauthorization.

4. **Zero-Based Budgeting:** Every program justified from zero each year.

5. **Eliminate Departments:** Close unnecessary agencies (Education, Commerce, etc.).

6. **End the Fed Integration:** Include monetary policy in fiscal accountability.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (on spending cuts, fiscal rules), Constitutionalist (on limited government)
- **Potential bridges:** Progressive (on corporate welfare cuts, military spending), Populist (on anti-establishment)
- **Unlikely partners:** Democratic Socialist, most Liberals (on government size)

### Constitutionalist Perspective

#### Faith Level Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Faith**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Some divergence: constitutional arguments genuine but selectively applied; process concerns vary with policy outcomes |
| Principle consistency | Inconsistent: separation of powers arguments vary by which branch controlled by which party |
| Goalpost stability | Moderate: balanced budget priority consistent; other positions shift |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate: constitutional framing sometimes used strategically |

**Justification:** Constitutionalist positions on budget process reflect genuine commitment to constitutional structure but are applied inconsistently. Support for congressional power over the purse is stronger when opposing executive spending than when supporting executive impoundment. Balanced budget amendment has been consistent priority. Some constitutional arguments (like opposing automatic debt ceiling as "delegation") are pretextual—Congress can structure its processes as it chooses.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- **Balanced budget consistency:** Long-standing support for BBA across decades.
- **Selective separation of powers:** Congressional Republicans supported Trump impoundment of Ukraine aid while citing separation of powers against Obama.
- **Constitutional flexibility:** Constitution doesn't require debt ceiling; arguments against reform are policy, not constitutional.
- **Historical precedent:** Gephardt Rule operated for years without constitutional challenge.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Agrees process is broken; frames as constitutional rather than political problem |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | Sees root cause as departure from constitutional design; disagrees with some causal claims |

**Source references:**

- Heritage Foundation constitutional analyses.
- Federalist Society discussions on spending power.
- Constitutional amendment advocacy groups.
- Congressional Research Service constitutional analyses.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Debt Ceiling Abolition | 2/10 | "Congress must retain control over borrowing" | Constitutional concern (debatable) |
| Automatic Debt Ceiling Increase | 3/10 | "Improper delegation of congressional power" | Same concern |
| McConnell Mechanism | 5/10 | "Acceptable because Congress retains disapproval authority" | Preserves congressional role |
| Automatic Continuing Resolution | 5/10 | "Appropriations should require affirmative action" | Concern about automatic mechanisms |
| "No Budget, No Pay" | 6/10 | "Constitutional concerns but Congress can regulate itself" | 27th Amendment issue |
| Biennial Budgeting | 6/10 | "Congress can structure its process" | Neutral on constitutional grounds |
| Timeline Reform | 6/10 | "Internal congressional process; constitutional" | Neutral |
| Enhanced Budget Resolution Enforcement | 6/10 | "Joint resolution approach more constitutional than concurrent" | Some support |
| Reconciliation Reform (Deficit Reduction Only) | 6/10 | "Reconciliation is congressional creation; can be modified" | Neutral |
| Strengthen Byrd Rule | 6/10 | "Senate can set its rules" | Neutral |
| Strengthen Impoundment Control | 4/10 | "Executive has inherent discretion in execution" | Support some executive discretion |
| Earmark Transparency | 7/10 | "Transparency in spending is appropriate" | Support |
| Long-Term Budget Framework | 6/10 | "Reporting requirements acceptable" | Neutral |
| Fiscal Rules (Balanced Budget) | 9/10 | "Constitutional balanced budget requirement needed" | Top priority |
| PAYGO Restoration | 6/10 | "Statutory fiscal rules acceptable" | Support |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Debt Ceiling Reform Act | 3/10 | "Unconstitutional delegation of borrowing authority" | Oppose |
| No Budget No Pay Act | 6/10 | "Constitutional concerns but likely survives" | Conditional support |
| Prevent Government Shutdowns Act | 4/10 | "Congress should act, not automate appropriations" | Skeptical |
| Budget Process Reform Act | 5/10 | "Joint resolution approach good; some provisions concerning" | Mixed |

#### Alternative Proposals

Constitutionalists would prefer:

1. **Balanced Budget Amendment:** Constitutional requirement with supermajority waiver for emergencies.

2. **Line-Item Veto Amendment:** Constitutional grant of item veto to President.

3. **Spending Clause Enforcement:** Judicial review of spending for constitutional purposes.

4. **Enumerated Powers Enforcement:** Limit spending to constitutionally enumerated functions.

5. **State Convention:** Article V convention to propose balanced budget and spending amendments.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (on balanced budget), Libertarian (on limited government)
- **Potential bridges:** Some process reforms have bipartisan constitutional support
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist (on spending constraints)

### Populist Perspective

#### Faith Level Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Faith**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Significant divergence: anti-elite rhetoric genuine but budget positions often serve elite interests; "drain the swamp" not matched by fiscal policy |
| Principle consistency | Very inconsistent: deficit concerns vary with who benefits; Wall Street bailout opposition inconsistent with support for deficits benefiting populist priorities |
| Goalpost stability | Unstable: positions shift based on political moment |
| Zero-sum behavior | High: budget process positions driven by partisan tribal identity more than principle |

**Justification:** Populist positions on budget process are heavily influenced by tribal identity and vary significantly between left and right populists. Right populists use anti-elite rhetoric but have supported deficit-increasing policies under Trump. Left populists oppose austerity consistently but may support deficits for public investment. Both share distrust of elite-controlled process but have opposite preferred outcomes. The "swamp" framing is more about who benefits than fiscal discipline.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- **Right populist inconsistency:** Trump populists supported massive deficits for tax cuts and COVID spending while opposing deficits for Democratic priorities.
- **Left populist consistency:** Bernie Sanders populists more consistent on anti-austerity but accept deficits for public investment.
- **Anti-elite but not anti-spending:** Populist rhetoric attacks process, not necessarily spending levels.
- **Tribal dynamics:** Budget positions follow party identity more than populist principle.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | Agrees process is rigged; different views on who benefits from dysfunction |
| Root Cause Agreement | 5/10 | Right populists blame bureaucracy; left populists blame corporate capture; analysis is in between |

**Source references:**

- American Compass (right populist) economic positions.
- Sanders wing policy positions.
- Polling on populist attitudes toward government spending.

#### Alternative Proposals

Populists would emphasize:

1. **Member Accountability:** Stronger personal consequences for members failing to budget.

2. **Transparency:** Public access to all budget negotiations, not just final product.

3. **Lobbyist Restrictions:** Remove corporate influence from budget process.

4. **Direct Democracy:** Public vote on major budget priorities.

5. **Anti-Bailout Rules:** Prohibit bailouts of Wall Street and corporations in budget process.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Varies; left populists with Progressive/Democratic Socialist; right populists with Conservative
- **Potential bridges:** Transparency and accountability reforms can unite populist spectrum
- **Unlikely partners:** Establishment wings of either party; technocratic centrists

### Centrist Perspective

#### Faith Level Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Full Good Faith**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Highly aligned: genuine commitment to functional government and bipartisan process; not seeking partisan advantage |
| Principle consistency | Very consistent: support for process reforms consistent across administrations and regardless of which party benefits |
| Goalpost stability | Stable: same good government principles over decades |
| Zero-sum behavior | Very low: actively seek compromise and bipartisan solutions |

**Justification:** Centrist positions on budget process reflect genuine commitment to functional, evidence-based government. Organizations like the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Concord Coalition, and Problem Solvers Caucus have consistently advocated for process reforms regardless of partisan implications. Centrists recognize that both parties have contributed to budget dysfunction and seek structural solutions rather than partisan advantage.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- **Bipartisan advocacy:** CRFB, Concord Coalition critique both parties' fiscal irresponsibility.
- **Problem Solvers Caucus:** Bipartisan group consistently works on budget process reform.
- **Consistent principles:** Same process reform advocacy across Democratic and Republican administrations.
- **Compromise orientation:** Willing to accept reforms that benefit both parties.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strongly agrees with factual analysis; would emphasize bipartisan blame |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | Agrees with root causes; would emphasize institutional factors over partisan |

**Source references:**

- Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget analyses.
- Concord Coalition policy positions.

| Prevent Government Shutdowns Act | 9/10 | "Essential reform; well-designed incentives" | Very strong support |
| Budget Process Reform Act | 8/10 | "Comprehensive approach needed" | Strong support |

#### Alternative Proposals

Centrists would add:

1. **Bipartisan Commission:** Simpson-Bowles-style commission for comprehensive fiscal reform.

2. **Regular Order Restoration:** Incentives for committee process and floor amendments.

3. **Fiscal Responsibility Targets:** Debt-to-GDP targets rather than rigid balance requirement.

4. **Tax Expenditure Review:** Regular review of tax preferences alongside spending.

5. **Social Security/Medicare Commission:** Bipartisan approach to entitlement sustainability.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Moderate members of both parties; good government organizations
- **Potential bridges:** Can work with most perspectives on specific reforms
- **Unlikely partners:** Ideological extremes unwilling to compromise

### Religious Right Perspective

#### Faith Level Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Faith**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Some divergence: fiscal positions generally align with conservative movement rather than distinctly religious concerns |
| Principle consistency | Inconsistent: fiscal responsibility rhetoric varies with administration; deficits acceptable for priorities like defense |
| Goalpost stability | Moderate: stable on moral spending issues; shifting on fiscal process |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate: budget positions follow broader conservative coalition |

**Justification:** Religious Right engagement on budget process is primarily derivative of broader conservative movement positions rather than distinctly faith-based. Fiscal conservatism is emphasized when convenient but not when it conflicts with priorities like defense spending or tax cuts. Religious arguments for balanced budgets (generational responsibility, stewardship) are genuine but inconsistently applied. Process positions align closely with conservative movement.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- **Alliance with conservative movement:** Family Research Council, Focus on the Family fiscal positions match Heritage Foundation.
- **Selective fiscal concern:** Support for deficits for tax cuts and defense; concern for deficits for social spending.
- **Moral framing:** Debt as moral issue (burden on children) used selectively.
- **Not distinctly religious:** Budget process positions not derived from theological principles.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Agrees process is broken; different emphasis on causes |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | Sees moral decline and loss of fiscal responsibility as causes; less focus on structural factors |

**Source references:**

- Family Research Council policy positions.
- Faith and Freedom Coalition fiscal views.
- Religious leader statements on debt and spending.
- Overlap with Heritage Foundation positions.

| Prevent Government Shutdowns Act | 4/10 | "Removes pressure for fiscal responsibility" | Skeptical |
| Budget Process Reform Act | 5/10 | "Some good, some concerning" | Mixed |

#### Alternative Proposals

Religious Right would emphasize:

1. **Balanced Budget Amendment:** Moral obligation to not burden future generations.

2. **Spending Priorities:** Protect defense; reduce social spending that undermines family.

3. **Tax Relief:** Family-friendly tax policy (child tax credit, marriage penalty elimination).

4. **Faith-Based Alternatives:** Shift social services from government to faith-based organizations.

5. **Generational Accounting:** Make explicit the burden on future generations.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (on fiscal positions), Constitutionalist (on balanced budget)
- **Potential bridges:** Some common ground with Populists on accountability
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist, most Liberals

### Democratic Socialist Perspective

#### Faith Level Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Good Faith**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Well aligned: opposition to austerity leverage is principled; want to enable public investment |
| Principle consistency | Consistent: have consistently opposed using budget process for austerity regardless of administration |
| Goalpost stability | Stable: same anti-austerity, pro-public investment position over time |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low: process positions reflect genuine values, not just partisan advantage |

**Justification:** Democratic socialist positions on budget process stem from genuine commitment to public investment and opposition to austerity. Like progressives but more so, democratic socialists see debt ceiling and shutdown brinksmanship as tools for imposing cuts on working people. Support for removing austerity leverage is principled—they would oppose such tactics even if used for progressive goals (though this is theoretical). Some reduction from full good faith for willingness to use reconciliation for transformative legislation.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- **Anti-austerity consistency:** DSA and allied organizations consistently oppose cuts regardless of administration.
- **Public investment focus:** See deficits for public investment as different from deficits for tax cuts.
- **Worker focus:** Emphasis on protecting federal workers and public services.
- **MMT influence:** Some embrace Modern Monetary Theory, viewing deficit concerns as misguided.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strongly agrees process enables austerity; would emphasize corporate influence more |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | Agrees with analysis; would add critique of capitalism and corporate state |

**Source references:**

- DSA policy positions on fiscal policy.
- Jacobin and similar publications on budget process.
- MMT economists (Stephanie Kelton, et al.) on deficits.

| Prevent Government Shutdowns Act | 9/10 | "Essential worker protection" | Strong support |

#### Alternative Proposals

Democratic socialists would prefer:

1. **Debt Ceiling Repeal:** Complete abolition.

2. **Reconciliation Expansion:** Remove Byrd Rule restrictions to enable transformative legislation.

3. **MMT Framework:** Functional finance approach focusing on outcomes, not arbitrary balance.

4. **Public Investment Budget:** Separate capital budget for long-term investments.

5. **Federal Job Guarantee:** Automatic stabilizer replacing arbitrary fiscal rules.

6. **Wealth Tax Integration:** Progressive taxation as fiscal sustainability mechanism.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive (on anti-austerity, reconciliation), Liberal (on shutdown prevention)
- **Potential bridges:** Left Populist (on anti-elite, worker protection)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative, Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Religious Right (fundamental disagreement on fiscal policy)

**Good Faith Majority:** 5/9 perspectives rated 4 or above

**Note on Conservative Rating:** The 2/5 rating reflects documented inconsistency between stated fiscal principles and actual behavior (debt ceiling raised under Trump without conditions; deficit-increasing tax cuts via reconciliation; shutdown strategies). Individual conservatives may hold principled positions, but the movement's collective behavior on budget process is strategically motivated.

## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: Shutdown Prevention with Accountability Incentives

**Bridges:** Liberal + Progressive + Centrist + Democratic Socialist + some Populist and Conservative

**Core Agreement:** Shutdowns harm workers and services; Congress should face consequences for failure; but process should still create urgency to complete appropriations.

**Policy Description:**

- Automatic continuing resolution at prior year levels
- Declining rate: 1% reduction after 120 days, 2% after 180 days
- Congressional schedule restrictions during automatic CR (no recesses longer than 3 days)
- Member pay escrowed (not forfeited) until appropriations complete
- Federal employee pay protected throughout
- Contractor protections included

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Liberal/Progressive/DemSoc | Workers protected; no shutdown harm |
| Centrist | Functional government; declining rate incentive |
| Conservative | Some leverage preserved through declining rate |
| Populist | Members face consequences (escrow) |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | No complete shutdown leverage; automatic mechanism |
| Liberal/Progressive | Declining rate creates some austerity pressure |
| Democratic Socialist | Accepts declining rate incentive |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 5-6/9 perspectives
- **Good Faith Ratio:** 4/5 coalition members rated 4+ faith
- **Durability:** High - protects against crisis without removing all urgency
- **Implementation Path:** Standalone legislation

---

### Compromise 2: Modified Debt Ceiling with Congressional Check

**Bridges:** Liberal + Progressive + Centrist + Democratic Socialist + possibly Libertarian and some Populist

**Core Agreement:** Debt ceiling crises are manufactured and harmful; but Congress should retain some role in borrowing decisions.

**Policy Description:**

- Debt ceiling automatically increases to accommodate enacted appropriations (Gephardt Rule)
- Congress can disapprove by joint resolution (McConnell mechanism)
- President can veto disapproval
- Override requires 2/3 majority
- Treasury quarterly reporting on debt management
- No default permitted under any circumstance

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Liberal/Progressive/DemSoc | Removes crisis and default risk |
| Centrist | Functional process; congressional role preserved |
| Conservative | Symbolic vote against increases preserved |
| Constitutionalist | Congressional check maintained |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Loses leverage; only symbolic disapproval votes |
| Liberal/Progressive | Accepts mechanism rather than outright abolition |
| Libertarian | Accepts automatic increase |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 5-6/9 perspectives
- **Good Faith Ratio:** 4/5 coalition members rated 4+ faith
- **Durability:** Moderate-high - McConnell mechanism has proven durable
- **Implementation Path:** Statutory reform of debt ceiling

---

### Compromise 3: Bipartisan Process Modernization

**Bridges:** Conservative + Liberal + Centrist + Libertarian + Constitutionalist

**Core Agreement:** Budget process is outdated and dysfunctional; earlier timelines and better enforcement could help.

**Policy Description:**

- Earlier budget submission (December instead of February)
- Earlier budget resolution deadline (March instead of April)
- Appropriations completion target of July 15
- Joint (binding) budget resolution
- Stronger points of order (60 votes to waive)
- Biennial budgeting pilot for selected agencies
- Enhanced oversight in second year of biennium

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Centrist | Evidence-based process improvements |
| Liberal | More time for deliberation; binding resolution |
| Conservative | Enforceable caps possible |
| Libertarian | More transparency and oversight |
| Constitutionalist | Joint resolution more constitutional |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Binding resolution limits flexibility |
| Liberal | Earlier deadlines create pressure |
| Progressive | Binding resolution could lock in limits |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 5-6/9 perspectives
- **Good Faith Ratio:** 4/5 coalition members rated 4+ faith
- **Durability:** High - process reforms historically durable
- **Implementation Path:** Statutory amendment to Budget Act

---

### Compromise 4: Earmark Transparency with Limits

**Bridges:** All perspectives have 6+ support

**Core Agreement:** If earmarks exist, they should be transparent; corruption must be prevented; but earmarks can aid coalition-building.

**Policy Description:**

- All requests public 30 days before markup
- Member name, justification, recipient disclosed
- No for-profit recipients
- Cap at 1% of discretionary spending
- Individual project cap at $10 million
- GAO review of requests over $1 million
- Public comment period
- Recorded committee vote on earmarks

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | Transparency; limits on total spending |
| Liberal | Can direct spending to priorities; transparency |
| Libertarian | Full disclosure; caps |
| Populist | Exposes who benefits |
| Centrist | Balanced approach; aids governing |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Anti-earmark purists | Earmarks exist at all |
| Pro-earmark advocates | Caps and restrictions |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 8-9/9 perspectives
- **Good Faith Ratio:** High across spectrum
- **Durability:** High - transparency reforms broadly popular
- **Implementation Path:** House and Senate rules; optional statute

---

## Strategic Implications

### Most Viable Coalition

**Primary coalition for shutdown/debt ceiling reform:** Liberal + Progressive + Centrist + Democratic Socialist (+ selective Populist support)

This coalition has:

- 4 perspectives with faith ratings of 4+ (good faith engagement)
- Strong agreement on preventing manufactured crises
- Political weight (Democratic base + good government independents)
- Coherent narrative: government should function; workers shouldn't suffer for political games

**Secondary coalition for process reforms:** Add moderate Conservatives, Libertarians, Constitutionalists on specific measures

- Biennial budgeting, timeline reform, earmark transparency have cross-ideological appeal
- Process improvements don't threaten fiscal policy outcomes

### Key Obstacles

1. **Conservative Leverage Attachment:** Conservative movement derives significant benefit from shutdown and debt ceiling leverage. Any reform that removes this leverage will face strong opposition regardless of process merits. The 2/5 faith rating reflects that stated objections often mask strategic leverage concerns.

2. **Fiscal Rules Divide:** Progressives and Democratic Socialists see balanced budget requirements as austerity traps; Conservatives and Libertarians see them as essential discipline. No compromise position bridges this gap.

3. **Reconciliation Tension:** Reforms to limit reconciliation threaten policy goals of both parties—tax cuts for Republicans, social spending for Democrats. Principled reconciliation reform is orphaned.

4. **Left-Right Populist Split:** Populists share anti-elite sentiment but have opposite fiscal policy preferences, making populist coalition difficult on budget process.

### Handling Bad Faith Actors

**Conservative (2/5 faith):** Their stated concerns (fiscal discipline, congressional authority) are legitimate in principle but inconsistently applied in practice. Strategy:

- Document inconsistencies (debt ceiling raised under Trump without conditions)
- Build public case for removing leverage
- Frame reforms as protecting workers, not enabling spending
- Use moderate Republicans and business community pressure
- Proceed without full conservative support; rely on good-faith coalition

**Populist (3/5 faith):** Split between left and right makes unified engagement difficult. Strategy:

- Engage left populists as part of progressive coalition
- Engage right populists on transparency and accountability measures
- Avoid framing that triggers tribal identity
- Emphasize anti-elite aspects of reform (Congress should face consequences)

### Recommended Approach for Reform Advocates

1. **Lead with shutdown prevention:** Automatic CR has broadest support and most sympathetic framing (protecting federal workers). Build momentum here.

2. **Link debt ceiling to shutdown reform:** Package together as "government functionality" reforms. Both remove manufactured crises.

3. **Use business community pressure:** Financial sector and business groups support debt ceiling reform; leverage their influence on conservatives.

4. **Build bipartisan process reform coalition:** Earmark transparency, timeline reform, biennial budgeting can unite strange bedfellows.

5. **Accept incremental progress:** McConnell mechanism and automatic Gephardt Rule are less satisfying than abolition but more achievable.

6. **Prepare for conservative opposition:** Shutdown prevention and debt ceiling reform will face Republican opposition regardless of design. Build majority coalition that can pass reforms without full Republican support.

7. **Frame around workers, not abstraction:** "Protect federal workers" is more compelling than "improve budget process."
