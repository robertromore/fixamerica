Congress finds that—

        citing specific exemptions;
    (3) if the deadline is not met, automatically waive all fees.

(b) AUTOMATIC DISCLOSURE.—If an agency fails to respond within
    40 business days, the request shall be deemed granted and
    responsive records shall be released, unless the agency
    certifies in writing that release would cause specific,
    demonstrable harm to an interest protected by an exemption
    under 5 U.S.C. § 552(b). Such certification shall—

        specific, identifiable harm to an interest protected by
        an exemption, and the harm outweighs the public interest
        in disclosure.

(b) DELIBERATIVE PROCESS LIMITATION.—Exemption 5 (5 U.S.C.
    § 552(b)(5)) shall not apply to—
    (1) records more than 10 years old;

SEC. 5. PUBLIC INTEREST DECLASSIFICATION BOARD.

## Regulatory Framework

### FOIA Implementation Regulations

Model regulations for agency FOIA implementation:

1. **Processing Standards**: Timelines, queue management, expedited processing
2. **Exemption Application**: Specific guidance on each exemption
3. **Fee Structure**: Cost calculation, waiver criteria
4. **Appeal Procedures**: Internal review process
5. **Proactive Disclosure**: Publication requirements

### Classification Guidance

Executive Order provisions for classification reform:

1. **Classification Criteria**: Specific harm standards
2. **Declassification Schedules**: Automatic and systematic review
3. **Training Requirements**: Annual certification
4. **Accountability Mechanisms**: Attribution and audit

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Authority

- Congress has authority to regulate executive branch information practices
- First Amendment supports public access to government information
- State secrets doctrine limits some judicial review
- Separation of powers considerations in classification

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- Administrative enforcement through OGIS and IGs
- Judicial enforcement through FOIA litigation
- Congressional oversight through reporting requirements
- Personnel accountability through disciplinary procedures

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| National security override | "Automatic disclosure" exception for national security | High |
| Deliberative process workaround | Agencies claim everything is pre-decisional | Moderate |
| Classification re-designation | Declassified info re-classified | Moderate |
| Contractor exemption | Government functions through contractors | Moderate |
| State secrets doctrine | Courts defer to executive claims | High |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Resource dependency | Reforms meaningless without funding | Budget politics |
| Cultural resistance | Agencies resist transparency culture change | Institutional inertia |
| Judicial deference | Courts defer to security claims | Separation of powers tradition |
| Political will | Administrations resist transparency | Self-interest |
| Enforcement gaps | Penalties rarely applied | Weak accountability |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **National Security Exception Limitation**
    - Require specific certification of harm
    - Independent review of security claims
    - Time-limited exemptions
    - Congressional notification requirements

2. **Deliberative Process Reform**
    - 10-year hard sunset
    - Factual information never exempt
    - Final decisions always disclosed
    - Public interest override

3. **Funding Guarantees**
    - Dedicated FOIA appropriations
    - Automatic fee increases with request volume
    - Cross-agency shared services
    - Technology investment requirements

4. **Cultural Change**
    - Leadership accountability for transparency
    - Performance metrics include transparency
    - Training and education requirements
    - Recognition for proactive disclosure

5. **Judicial Review Enhancement**
    - Vaughn index requirements
    - In camera review standards
    - Fee-shifting for prevailing plaintiffs
    - Special masters for complex cases

### General Implementation Concerns

1. **Phased Implementation**
    - Allow agencies time to build capacity
    - Pilot programs for new requirements
    - Gradual deadline tightening
    - Technology deployment timeline

2. **Interagency Coordination**
    - Central FOIA portal development
    - Shared services for processing
    - Consistent exemption interpretation
    - Classification guide harmonization

3. **Ongoing Oversight**
    - Annual congressional hearings
    - GAO audits of implementation
    - Civil society monitoring
    - Public feedback mechanisms
