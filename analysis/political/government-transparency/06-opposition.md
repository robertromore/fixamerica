# Government Transparency: Opposition

## National Security Arguments

### Sources and Methods

**Core Claim**:

Transparency threatens intelligence sources and methods, endangering national security.

**Key Arguments**:

- Human sources could be identified and killed
- Technical collection methods could be evaded
- Foreign liaison services would stop cooperating
- Adversaries would exploit disclosed information

**Evidence Cited**:

- Historical compromise of sources
- Foreign intelligence concerns about U.S. leaks
- Operational security requirements
- Post-disclosure damage assessments

**Counterarguments**:

- Over-classification hides embarrassment, not secrets
- Most classified information not operationally sensitive
- Decades-old information still classified
- Classification authority abused for political purposes

### Mosaic Theory

**Core Claim**:

Even innocuous information, combined with other data, can reveal sensitive intelligence.

**Key Arguments**:

- Individual pieces seem harmless
- Aggregation creates meaningful intelligence
- Adversaries are sophisticated analysts
- Err on side of caution

**Counterarguments**:

- Theory is infinitely expansible
- Justifies classifying everything
- Prevents meaningful oversight
- Courts have limited application

### Operational Security

**Core Claim**:

Military and intelligence operations require secrecy to succeed.

**Key Arguments**:

## Executive Branch Arguments

### Deliberative Process

**Core Claim**:

Government decision-making requires confidential deliberation.

**Key Arguments**:

- Officials need candid advice
- Fear of disclosure would chill discussion

- Longstanding practice

**Counterarguments**:

- Exemption broadly abused

- Other democracies manage with more openness

### Executive Privilege

**Core Claim**:

**Counterarguments**:

- Exemption 7 already protects ongoing investigations

- Closed investigations should be accessible

### Witness and Source Protection

**Core Claim**:

Confidential informants and witnesses need protection.

**Key Arguments**:

- Lives could be endangered
- Future cooperation would dry up

- Identities must be protected permanently

**Counterarguments**:

- Legitimate concern for specific individuals

## Privacy Arguments

### Personal Privacy

### Employee Privacy

**Core Claim**:

Government employees have privacy interests in their work.

**Counterarguments**:

- Public servants' official conduct is public concern

## Business and Commercial Arguments

### Trade Secrets

**Core Claim**:

FOIA could expose proprietary business information.

**Key Arguments**:
