# Government Transparency: Roadmap

## Strategic Considerations

### Multiple Avenues for Reform

Transparency reform can proceed through:

1. **Legislation**: FOIA amendments, whistleblower laws
2. **Executive action**: Classification reform, open data directives
3. **Regulation**: Agency-level implementation
4. **Litigation**: Enforcing existing rights
5. **Technology**: Tools for disclosure and access

### Political Windows

**Reform opportunities arise when**:

- New administration (first 100 days)
- Post-scandal (Watergate, Abu Ghraib, etc.)
- Congressional investigation momentum
- Press freedom incidents

### Building Blocks

Progress in one area enables progress in others:

- FOIA improvements → more information released → more stories → more pressure
- Whistleblower protection → more disclosures → more accountability
- Open data → better analysis → more informed advocacy

## Phase 1: Foundation Building (Year 1-2)

**Executive Action**:

- Presidential memorandum on FOIA presumption of disclosure
- Agency guidance on exemption interpretation
- FOIA officer training requirements
- Interagency FOIA working group

**Resource Allocation**:

- Increased FOIA staffing budgets
- Technology modernization funding
- Backlog reduction initiative
- Processing efficiency improvements

**Accountability Mechanisms**:

- FOIA report cards for all agencies
- Public dashboards on processing times
- Chief FOIA Officer accountability
- Inspector General audits

### Whistleblower Protection Enhancement

**Legislation**:

|------|-------------|------------|
| Underfunding | High | Dedicated appropriations, fees |
| Technology failures | Moderate | Phased implementation, testing |
| Compliance gaps | High | Enforcement mechanisms, audits |
| Unintended consequences | Moderate | Pilot programs, adjustments |

## Metrics for Success

### Short-Term (Years 1-2)
