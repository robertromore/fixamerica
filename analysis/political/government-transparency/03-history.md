# Government Transparency: History

## Early American Transparency

### Constitutional Foundations

**Constitutional Provisions**:

- Article I, Section 5: Each house shall keep a journal, published (with exceptions for secrecy)
- Article I, Section 9: Statement and account of receipts and expenditures published
- First Amendment: Press freedom implies government accountability

**Limited Early Transparency**:

- No general right of access to records
- Executive privilege claimed from Washington forward
- Congressional secrecy in sensitive matters
- Courts closed to public in some proceedings

### 19th Century Developments

**Printing and Publication**:

- Government Printing Office established (1860)
- Congressional Record began (1873)
- Growing publication of laws and regulations

**Press Access**:

- Reporters gained regular access to Congress
- Press galleries established
- Executive branch remained largely closed
- No statutory right of access

## Birth of Modern Transparency (1946-1966)

### Administrative Procedure Act (1946)

**Initial Transparency Provisions**:

- Required publication of agency rules
- Established Federal Register
- Public access to certain records
- But: Broad exceptions, limited enforcement

**"Housekeeping Statute" Problem**:

- Agencies used administrative authority to restrict access
- "Properly withheld" left to agency discretion
- Press and public effectively blocked
- Courts deferred to agencies

### FOIA Campaign

**Key Advocates**:

- Press organizations: AP, newspaper associations
- Academic researchers
- Good government groups

**Opposition**:

- Executive branch agencies
- Every administration from Truman to Johnson

- Some business interests

**12-Year Campaign (1954-1966)**:

- Final passage required LBJ to sign despite reservations

### Freedom of Information Act (1966)

**Key Provisions**:

## Whistleblower Protection History

### Early Whistleblowers

## Lessons from History

### Progress Patterns

1. **Crisis-driven reform**: Watergate, 9/11 led to changes
2. **Executive resistance**: Every president resists transparency
3. **Congressional action required**: Presidents won't self-reform
4. **Enforcement matters**: Laws without enforcement fail
5. **Technology changes landscape**: New opportunities and challenges

### Persistent Challenges

1. **Over-classification continues**: Every reform attempt fails
2. **FOIA backlogs grow**: Resources never match demand
3. **Whistleblower retaliation persists**: Protections inadequate
4. **Executive privilege claims expand**: Each administration pushes limits
5. **National security trumps transparency**: Security claims defeat disclosure
