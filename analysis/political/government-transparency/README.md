# Government Transparency: Overview

Government transparency—the public's ability to access information about government activities—is fundamental to democratic accountability. The United States has extensive transparency laws, including the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), open meetings requirements, and financial disclosure rules. However, these systems face serious challenges: excessive classification, FOIA backlogs, weak enforcement, inadequate whistleblower protections, and resistance to open data. Strengthening transparency requires reforming classification policy, modernizing FOIA, protecting whistleblowers, and embracing proactive disclosure.
