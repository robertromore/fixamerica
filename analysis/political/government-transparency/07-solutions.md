# Government Transparency: Solutions

## Framework for Reform

Effective transparency reform must:

1. **Create proactive disclosure** as the default, not reactive response
2. **Establish meaningful enforcement** with real consequences
3. **Reform classification** to prevent over-classification
4. **Protect whistleblowers** who expose wrongdoing
5. **Leverage technology** for open data and efficient processing
6. **Ensure adequate resources** for transparency functions

## FOIA Reform

### Problem

FOIA is slow, under-resourced, and routinely circumvented through broad exemption interpretations.

### Solution: Comprehensive FOIA Modernization

**Strengthen the Presumption of Disclosure**:

- "Foreseeable harm" standard (partially enacted 2016)
- Agency must show specific harm, not theoretical
- Burden of proof on agency for all exemptions
- Public interest balancing required

**Enforceable Deadlines**:

- Strict time limits with automatic disclosure for missed deadlines
- Fee waiver if deadline missed
- Personal accountability for processing officials
- Expedited processing standards

**Reduce Exemption Abuse**:

| Exemption | Current Problem | Reform |
|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| 5 (Deliberative) | Too broad, indefinite | 10-year sunset, narrow interpretation |
| 7 (Law Enforcement) | Blanket denials | Case-by-case, closed investigations released |
| 1 (National Security) | Over-classification | Independent review, presumptive release after 25 years |

**Improve Processing**:

- Central FOIA portal for all agencies
- Standardized tracking and reporting
- Technology for automated processing
- Shared services across agencies

**Strengthen Enforcement**:

- Office of Government Information Services binding authority
- Court fee-shifting for prevailing requesters
- Agency FOIA report cards with consequences
- Inspector General FOIA audits

### Proactive Disclosure Requirements

**Default Publication**:

- All final documents online within 30 days
- Frequently requested records published automatically
- Meeting calendars and schedules
- Contracts and grants

**Reading Rooms**:

- Comprehensive online reading rooms
- Searchable databases
- Machine-readable formats
- Regular updates

## Classification Reform

### Problem

Over-classification prevents accountability and wastes resources while providing false security.

### Solution: Classification System Overhaul

**Reduce Classification Authority**:

- Limit original classification authority to senior officials
- Eliminate derivative classification or require annual training/certification
- Regular audits of classification decisions
- Personal accountability for over-classification

**Mandatory Declassification**:

| Category | Timeline | Process |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Most records | 10 years | Automatic unless renewed |
| Sensitive records | 25 years | Review required for extension |
| Exceptionally sensitive | 50 years | High-level approval for extension |
| Permanent classification | Rare | Must be specifically designated |

**Independent Review**:

- Public Interest Declassification Board with binding authority
- External review of classification decisions
- Requester right to independent review
- Classification appeals court

**Change Incentives**:

- Penalties for over-classification
- Rewards for appropriate release
- Career consequences for abuse
- Inspector General audits

### Controlled Unclassified Information Reform

**Problem**: CUI has become new secrecy category

**Solution**:

- Narrow CUI categories
- Automatic sunset on CUI designations
- Public interest exception
- Regular audits of CUI use

## Whistleblower Protection Overhaul

### Problem

Whistleblowers face retaliation with inadequate legal protection, especially in national security contexts.

### Solution: Comprehensive Whistleblower Protection

**Expand Coverage**:

- Intelligence community employees fully protected
- Contractors covered equally
- State secrets cannot be used against whistleblower
- Retroactive protection for prior whistleblowers

**Strengthen Remedies**:

- Reinstatement as default remedy
- Back pay and compensatory damages
- Punitive damages for egregious retaliation
- Attorney's fees guaranteed

**Expedite Process**:

- 180-day deadline for OSC investigation
- Direct access to courts after OSC
- Preliminary reinstatement pending outcome
- Streamlined MSPB procedures

**Create Safe Channels**:

- Secure reporting systems
- Confidentiality protections
- Inspector General requirements
- Congressional notification channels

### Public Interest Disclosure Protection

**New Protection Category**:

- Protect disclosures of illegality, fraud, or abuse
- Even if classified, if disclosed to appropriate recipient
- Press disclosure protected if internal channels exhausted
- Public interest defense in criminal prosecutions

**Limits**:

- Genuine sources and methods excluded
- Must minimize unnecessary disclosure
- Must attempt internal channels first
- Not protection for espionage

## Open Data Expansion

### Problem

Government data is incomplete, hard to find, and often not machine-readable.

### Solution: Default Open Data

**Mandatory Publication**:

- All datasets published unless specific exemption
- Machine-readable formats required
- Metadata standards enforced
- Regular updates mandated

**Data Quality**:

- Standards for completeness and accuracy
- Error correction requirements
- User feedback mechanisms
- Audit and accountability

**Technology Infrastructure**:

- Central data.gov portal enhancement
- API access to all major datasets
- Developer tools and documentation
- Cross-agency data integration

**Specific Categories**:

| Data Type | Current Status | Reform |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| Spending | Improving (USAspending) | Real-time, complete |
| Regulations | Partial (regulations.gov) | All comments, data |
| Enforcement | Limited | All actions public |
| Contracts | Partial | Full text, performance |
| Grants | Improving | Outcomes, performance |

## Congressional Transparency

### Problem

Congressional processes are often opaque, with closed-door negotiations and limited disclosure.

### Solution: Legislative Transparency Act

**Open Proceedings**:

- All committee markups open (limited exceptions)
- Conference committees open
- 72-hour rule for bills before vote
- Amendment text public before consideration

**Disclosure Requirements**:

- All lobbying contacts disclosed
- Campaign-related communications reported
- Financial transactions reported promptly
- Travel fully documented

**Public Access**:

- All testimony transcribed and published
- All documents submitted to Congress public
- Searchable database of congressional records
- Real-time floor activity tracking

## Judicial Transparency

### Problem

Courts, especially the Supreme Court, operate with limited transparency.

### Solution: Court Transparency Reforms

**Supreme Court**:

- Cameras in the courtroom
- Real-time audio streaming
- Ethics disclosure requirements
- Recusal explanation requirements

**Federal Courts**:

- PACER fee elimination
- Electronic filing for all documents
- Searchable court records database
- Judicial financial disclosure online
