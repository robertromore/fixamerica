# Government Transparency: Current State

## Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)

### Basic Framework

**Coverage**:

- All federal executive branch agencies
- Does not cover Congress, courts, or president's immediate staff
- State equivalents vary widely

**Process**:

1. Requester submits written request identifying records
2. Agency has 20 business days to respond (often extended)
3. Agency may withhold records under 9 exemptions
4. Requester can appeal within agency, then to courts

**Nine FOIA Exemptions**:

| Exemption | Protects | Common Uses |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Classified national security | Defense, intelligence |
| 2 | Internal personnel rules | Administrative procedures |
| 3 | Statutory exemptions | Various specific laws |
| 4 | Trade secrets, commercial info | Business confidentiality |
| 5 | Inter/intra-agency deliberations | "Deliberative process" |
| 6 | Personal privacy | Individual information |
| 7 | Law enforcement | Investigations |
| 8 | Financial institutions | Bank examinations |
| 9 | Geological information | Oil/gas well data |

### FOIA Statistics (Recent Years)

| Metric | FY 2022 | Trend |
|--------|---------|-------|
| Requests received | 928,353 | Increasing |
| Requests processed | 878,281 | Struggling to keep up |
| Full grants | 42% | Declining |
| Partial grants | 32% | Stable |
| Full denials | 3% | Stable |
| Other (no records, etc.) | 23% | Increasing |
| Backlog | 200,000+ | Growing |

### Problem Agencies

| Agency | Issue | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
| DHS | Massive backlogs | Immigration records delays |
| State Department | Years-long waits | Clinton emails took 5+ years |
| FBI | Extensive redactions | Over-broad law enforcement exemption |
| CIA | Almost everything exempt | National security claims |
| DOJ | Slow processing | Controversial matters delayed |

### Fees and Costs

**Fee Categories**:

- Commercial requesters: Search, review, and duplication fees
- Educational/news media: Duplication only
- All others: Search and duplication (2 hours/100 pages free)

**Fee Barriers**:

- Agencies estimate high fees to deter requests
- Fee waivers inconsistently granted
- Appeals of fee decisions add delay
- Poor requesters effectively excluded

## Classification System

### Classification Authorities

**Original Classification Authority (OCA)**:

- President
- Agency heads designated by president
- Officials delegated by agency heads
- Approximately 2,000 officials with OCA

**Derivative Classification**:

- Millions of federal employees and contractors
- Apply classification based on existing guides
- Source of most classification decisions

### Classification Levels

| Level | Definition | Unauthorized Disclosure Would... |
|-------|------------|----------------------------------|
| Top Secret | Exceptionally grave damage to national security | Cause exceptionally grave damage |
| Secret | Serious damage to national security | Cause serious damage |
| Confidential | Damage to national security | Cause damage |

**Special Access Programs (SAPs)**:

- Above Top Secret (handling, not classification level)
- Compartmented information
- "Need to know" strictly enforced
- Oversight extremely limited

### Classification Statistics

| Metric | Annual Estimate |
|--------|-----------------|
| Original classification decisions | 50,000+ |
| Derivative classification decisions | 50+ million |
| Pages classified | Billions |
| Classified documents in archives | 400+ million pages |
| Annual declassification | ~30 million pages |
| Declassification backlog | 300+ million pages |

### Over-Classification Problem

**Evidence of Over-Classification**:

- Former officials estimate 50-90% over-classified
- "Born classified" nuclear information includes public science
- Embarrassing information classified
- Information already public re-classified

**Examples**:

- Pentagon Papers: Classified to hide policy failures
- CIA torture program: Classified to prevent accountability
- Drone strike criteria: Classified despite public discussion
- Agency budgets: Classified decades after relevance

### Declassification System

**Automatic Declassification**:

- Records over 25 years old reviewed for release
- Massive backlog in National Archives
- Agencies can exempt records from automatic review

**Mandatory Declassification Review**:

- Public can request review of specific records
- Agencies must respond (but often deny)
- Appeals possible but slow

**Systematic Declassification Review**:

- Agencies review records under declassification guides
- Prioritized by historical significance
- Underfunded and understaffed

## Whistleblower Protections

### Federal Whistleblower Framework

**Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA)**:

- Protects federal employees who disclose wrongdoing
- Covers waste, fraud, abuse, danger to public health/safety
- Prohibits retaliation (firing, demotion, harassment)
- Enforced through Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB)

**Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act**:

- Covers intelligence community employees/contractors
- Must report through internal channels (Inspector General)
- Cannot go to press or public
- Weaker protections than general federal employees

**Other Protections**:

- Various agency-specific statutes
- qui tam provisions (False Claims Act)
- SEC whistleblower program
- OSHA-administered programs

### Protection Gaps

| Category | Protection Level | Key Gap |
|----------|------------------|---------|
| Federal employees | Moderate | MSPB backlogs, weak remedies |
| Intelligence community | Weak | No press disclosure protection |
| Contractors | Varies | Inconsistent coverage |
| National security | Very weak | Espionage Act prosecutions |
| State/local | Varies widely | Patchwork of state laws |

### Retaliation Reality

**Success Rates**:

- Whistleblower complaints rarely succeed
- MSPB has had no quorum for years (backlog)
- Average case takes 2-5 years
- Retaliation often subtle, hard to prove

**High-Profile Cases**:

| Whistleblower | Disclosure | Outcome |
|---------------|------------|---------|
| Edward Snowden | NSA surveillance | Exile in Russia |
| Chelsea Manning | Iraq/Afghanistan docs | 7 years imprisonment |
| Reality Winner | Election interference | 5+ years imprisonment |
| Daniel Hale | Drone program | 4 years imprisonment |
| Daniel Ellsberg | Pentagon Papers | Charges dismissed (govt. misconduct) |

## Open Data Initiatives

### Federal Open Data Policy

**DATA Act (2014)**:

- Standardized federal spending data
- USAspending.gov portal
- Agency compliance inconsistent

**OPEN Government Data Act (2019)**:

- Requires machine-readable data
- Chief Data Officers in agencies
- Federal Data Strategy

**Data.gov**:

- Central portal for federal datasets
- 300,000+ datasets available
- Quality and completeness vary

### Open Data Challenges

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Data quality | Incomplete, outdated, inconsistent |
| Format issues | Non-machine-readable formats |
| Missing data | Key datasets not published |
| Update lag | Data not current |
| Discoverability | Hard to find relevant data |

### Agency Variation

| Agency | Open Data Quality | Notes |
|--------|-------------------|-------|
| Census Bureau | High | Core mission is data |
| EPA | Moderate | Environmental data improving |
| DOD | Low | National security concerns |
| DHS | Low | Immigration data limited |
| HHS | Moderate | Health data improving |

## Open Meetings Laws

### Federal Framework

**Government in the Sunshine Act (1976)**:

- Applies to multi-member federal agencies
- Requires open meetings with advance notice
- 10 exemptions parallel to FOIA
- Does not apply to single-headed agencies

**Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA)**:

- Applies to advisory committees
- Requires open meetings, public notice
- Charter and membership disclosure
- Compliance inconsistent

### State Open Meetings

- All 50 states have open meetings laws
- Requirements vary significantly
- Enforcement mechanisms differ
- Virtual meetings raised new issues

## Financial Disclosure

### Ethics in Government Act

- Cabinet and senior officials
- Congress members and senior staff
