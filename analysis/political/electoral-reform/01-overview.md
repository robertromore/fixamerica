# Electoral Reform: Overview

## Executive Summary

The way Americans vote is broken. The United States uses a winner-take-all plurality voting system that mathematically guarantees two-party dominance, forces voters into lesser-evil choices, wastes millions of votes, and produces representatives who don't reflect majority preferences. This isn't a bug—it's a predictable consequence of electoral system design.

Electoral reform—changing *how* we vote, not just *who* we vote for—is the most fundamental political reform because it determines everything else. The voting system shapes which candidates run, how they campaign, who wins, and how they govern. Change the system, and you change the incentives that drive political behavior.

Alternative voting methods like Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV), approval voting, and proportional representation have been tested extensively in other democracies and increasingly in U.S. states and cities. They work. They produce more representative outcomes, reduce negative campaigning, enable third-party competition, and give voters genuine choices.

## Scope

### What This Subtopic Covers

- **Voting methods**: Plurality, ranked-choice, approval, STAR, score voting
- **Single-winner vs. multi-winner systems**: How district magnitude affects representation
- **Proportional representation**: Party-list, single transferable vote, mixed-member systems
- **Implementation**: How to transition from current systems
- **Evidence**: What research and real-world experience tell us

### What This Subtopic Does Not Cover

- **Who can vote**: Covered in [Voting Rights](../voting-rights/01-overview.md)
- **How districts are drawn**: Covered in [Redistricting](../redistricting/01-overview.md)
- **How primaries work**: Covered in [Primary Reform](../primary-reform/01-overview.md)
- **Campaign funding**: Covered in [Campaign Finance](../campaign-finance/01-overview.md)

### Key Terms

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Plurality voting** | Candidate with most votes wins, even without majority (current U.S. system) |
| **Ranked-choice voting (RCV)** | Voters rank candidates; lowest eliminated until one has majority |
| **Approval voting** | Vote for as many candidates as you approve; most votes wins |
| **STAR voting** | Score candidates 0-5; top two go to automatic runoff |
| **Proportional representation** | Seats allocated proportionally to vote share |
| **Spoiler effect** | Third-party candidate splitting vote, changing outcome |
| **Duverger's Law** | Plurality voting tends toward two-party systems |

## Key Questions

1. **Why does the current voting system produce two-party dominance?** What is Duverger's Law and why is it so powerful?

2. **What alternative voting methods exist?** How do RCV, approval voting, STAR, and proportional systems work?

3. **What are the trade-offs between different systems?** Which is "best" and for what purposes?

4. **Does electoral reform actually work?** What does evidence from other democracies and U.S. implementations show?

5. **How can electoral reform be achieved?** What pathways exist for changing voting systems?

## Why This Matters

Electoral system choice has profound downstream effects:

| Current System Produces | Reformed System Could Produce |
|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Two dominant parties | Multiple competitive parties |
| Lesser-evil voting | Genuine preference expression |
| Negative campaigning | Coalition-building, civility |
| Safe seats, low competition | More competitive races |
| Extremism rewarded | Moderation incentivized |
| Voter frustration, low turnout | Engagement, higher turnout |
| Spoiler effects | No vote "wasted" |

**This is the master switch.** Change the voting system, and you change the incentives that drive polarization, extremism, and dysfunction.

## The Opportunity

Electoral reform is achievable:

- **Proven solutions exist**: RCV, approval voting, and proportional systems work in dozens of democracies
- **U.S. momentum is building**: Maine, Alaska, and 50+ cities use RCV; more states considering it
- **Public support is strong**: When explained, voters support alternative voting methods
- **Ballot initiatives work**: Voters have passed electoral reform where legislatures won't
- **It's not partisan**: Electoral reform appeals across the political spectrum
