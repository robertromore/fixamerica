# Electoral Reform: Solutions

## Guiding Principles

### Criteria for Evaluating Voting Systems

| Criterion | Definition | Why It Matters |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| **Majority support** | Winner should have majority backing | Legitimacy |
| **No spoilers** | Adding candidates shouldn't change outcome | Genuine choice |
| **Sincere voting** | Voters can express true preferences | Honesty |
| **Proportionality** | Seats match vote shares | Fair representation |
| **Simplicity** | Voters can understand and use it | Accessibility |
| **Resistance to manipulation** | Hard to game strategically | Integrity |

### No Perfect System

Arrow's Impossibility Theorem proves no voting system can satisfy all desirable criteria simultaneously. The question is which trade-offs to accept.

**Current System's Trade-offs**: Plurality voting sacrifices majority support, allows spoilers, forces strategic voting, and produces disproportionate results—in exchange for simplicity.

**Better Trade-offs Are Available**: Alternative systems achieve better outcomes with modest increases in complexity.

## Policy Proposals

### Tier 1: Ranked-Choice Voting (RCV)

**How It Works**

1. Voters rank candidates: 1st choice, 2nd choice, 3rd choice, etc.
2. If any candidate has majority of 1st-choice votes, they win
3. If not, last-place candidate eliminated
4. Votes for eliminated candidate transfer to voters' next choices
5. Repeat until someone has majority

**Advantages**

- ✅ Eliminates spoiler effect
- ✅ Allows sincere voting (rank true preference first)
- ✅ Produces majority winners
- ✅ Reduces negative campaigning (seek 2nd-choice votes)
- ✅ Proven in U.S. contexts (Maine, Alaska, 50+ cities)

**Disadvantages**

- ❌ Slightly more complex than plurality
- ❌ Doesn't ensure proportional representation (single-winner)
- ❌ Rare cases of "non-monotonicity" (voting for candidate hurts them)

**Best For**

- Single-winner elections (governor, mayor, president)
- Primary elections
- First step toward broader reform

**Implementation Status**

| Jurisdiction | Status |
|--------------|--------|
| Maine | Statewide (state + federal) |
| Alaska | Statewide (with top-four primary) |
| New York City | Local primaries |
| 50+ cities | Various local elections |

### Tier 2: Approval Voting

**How It Works**

1. Voters vote for as many candidates as they approve
2. Candidate with most votes wins

**Advantages**

- ✅ Extremely simple
- ✅ Eliminates spoiler effect
- ✅ Easy to implement (same ballots, machines)
- ✅ Allows support for multiple candidates

**Disadvantages**

- ❌ Less expressive than RCV (no ranking)
- ❌ Strategic voting still possible (don't approve frontrunner you slightly prefer)
- ❌ Less momentum than RCV

**Best For**

- Jurisdictions seeking simplest possible reform
- Local elections as test case
- Organizations, clubs, informal votes

**Implementation Status**

| Jurisdiction | Status |
|--------------|--------|
| Fargo, ND | City elections |
| St. Louis, MO | Primary elections |

### Tier 3: STAR Voting

**How It Works**

1. Voters score each candidate 0-5 stars
2. Top two highest-scored candidates advance
3. In automatic runoff, candidate preferred by more voters wins

**Advantages**

- ✅ Very expressive (show strength of preference)
- ✅ Eliminates spoiler effect
- ✅ Resistant to strategic voting
- ✅ Simpler counting than RCV

**Disadvantages**

- ❌ Less tested than RCV
- ❌ Newer, less public awareness
- ❌ Limited implementation so far

**Best For**

- Jurisdictions seeking highly expressive system
- Where RCV has faced resistance
- Future consideration as system matures

**Implementation Status**

- Advocated by Equal Vote Coalition
- Limited local implementations
- Growing interest

### Tier 4: Proportional Representation

**How It Works** (several variants)

**Multi-Member Districts with RCV (STV)**

1. Districts elect 3-5 representatives instead of 1
2. Voters rank candidates
3. Candidates meeting threshold elected; excess votes transfer
4. Continues until all seats filled

**Party-List Proportional**

1. Voters choose party
2. Seats allocated proportionally to party vote shares
3. Parties fill seats from ranked lists

**Mixed-Member Proportional (MMP)**

1. Some seats elected in districts (plurality or RCV)
2. Additional seats allocated to parties to achieve proportionality
3. Combines local representation with proportional outcomes

**Advantages**

- ✅ Most representative outcomes
- ✅ Minority viewpoints get representation
- ✅ Eliminates gerrymandering (larger districts)
- ✅ Enables multi-party democracy

**Disadvantages**

- ❌ More complex
- ❌ Requires larger districts (less local connection)
- ❌ Bigger departure from current system
- ❌ Harder to achieve politically

**Best For**

- Legislative bodies (Congress, state legislatures)
- Long-term goal for comprehensive reform
- Countries/states ready for transformative change

**Implementation Status**

- Used in most European democracies
- Cambridge, MA uses STV for city council
- Fair Representation Act would implement for U.S. House

## Structural Reforms

### Multi-Member Districts

**The Change**

- Instead of 435 single-member House districts, create ~87 districts of 5 members each
- States with fewer than 5 reps: 1-4 member districts

**Why It Matters**

- Eliminates gerrymandering (can't carve up larger districts)
- Enables proportional representation
- Gives voice to minority viewpoints
- Works with RCV (STV) or party-list

**Implementation**

- Requires Congress to repeal 1967 single-member district requirement
- Fair Representation Act would accomplish this
- States could also experiment for state legislatures

### Repeal 1967 Single-Member District Requirement

**Current Law**: Federal law requires single-member districts for House elections

**The Change**: Repeal this requirement, allowing states to use multi-member districts

**Impact**: Opens door to proportional representation for Congress

### Electoral College Reform

**National Popular Vote Interstate Compact**

- States agree to give electors to national popular vote winner
- Takes effect when states with 270+ electoral votes join
- Currently at 209 electoral votes

**Why It Matters**

- Ensures presidential winner has most votes nationally
- Every vote counts equally (no more swing state focus)
- Achievable without constitutional amendment

**Status**: Enacted in 17 states + DC; needs 61 more electoral votes

### Ballot Access Reform

**The Problem**: Third parties face expensive, inconsistent ballot access requirements

**Solutions**

- Uniform, reasonable signature requirements
- Automatic ballot access for parties meeting threshold
- Federal standards for federal elections

## Alternative Approaches

### RCV vs. Approval Voting Debate

**FairVote Position (Pro-RCV)**

- RCV more expressive
- Better track record
- More momentum
- Already has critical mass

**Center for Election Science Position (Pro-Approval)**

- Approval simpler
- Easier to implement
- Fewer anomalies
- Better for primaries

**Assessment**: Both are significant improvements over plurality. The debate is over which is better, not whether reform is needed.

**Practical Recommendation**: Support whichever has momentum locally. Don't let perfect be enemy of good.

### Incremental vs. Comprehensive

**Incremental Approach**

- RCV first, then proportional representation later
- Win small, build momentum
- Less threatening to opponents

**Comprehensive Approach**

- Multi-member districts + RCV in one package
- Addresses all problems at once
- More transformative

**Assessment**: Incremental approach more practical in most contexts. Comprehensive reform possible where conditions align (Alaska showed bold reform can pass).

### State vs. Federal Strategy

**State-First Strategy**

- Ballot initiatives in willing states
- Build track record
- Create demonstration effects
- 50 laboratories of democracy

**Federal Strategy**

- Pass Fair Representation Act
- National standards
- Uniform implementation

**Assessment**: State-first for now (federal legislation blocked). Federal as long-term goal once momentum builds.

## What Has Worked Elsewhere

### International Examples

| Country | System | Results |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **Australia** | RCV (called preferential voting) | Multiple parties, coalition governance |
| **Ireland** | STV (multi-member RCV) | Proportional outcomes, local representation |
| **New Zealand** | Mixed-member proportional | Transformed from two-party to multi-party |
| **Germany** | Mixed-member proportional | Stable multi-party democracy |
| **Sweden** | Party-list proportional | High turnout, multiple parties |

**Lessons**

- Alternative voting systems work
- Multi-party democracy is functional
- Coalition governance is normal
- Voters adapt to new systems

### U.S. Examples

| Jurisdiction | System | Results |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| **Maine** | RCV (statewide) | Multiple candidates, majority winners |
| **Alaska** | Top-four + RCV | Moderate winners, cross-partisan appeal |
| **San Francisco** | RCV (local) | 20+ years, high voter satisfaction |
| **Cambridge, MA** | STV (city council) | Proportional representation since 1941 |
| **Fargo, ND** | Approval voting | Simple implementation, positive reception |

**Lessons**

- Reform works in diverse U.S. contexts
- Voters can handle alternative systems
- Implementation challenges are manageable
- Reforms stick when voters experience them

## Trade-offs

### Simplicity vs. Expressiveness

| System | Simplicity | Expressiveness |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| Plurality | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐ |
| Approval | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
| RCV | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| STAR | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

**Trade-off**: More expressive systems require more voter effort

### Local Representation vs. Proportionality

| System | Local Representation | Proportionality |
|--------|---------------------|-----------------|
| Single-member plurality | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐ |
| Single-member RCV | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
| Multi-member (3-5) | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Party-list | ⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

**Trade-off**: More proportional systems mean larger districts, less local connection

### Achievability vs. Impact

| Reform | Achievability | Impact |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| RCV (single-winner) | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| Approval voting | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐ |
| Multi-member + RCV | ⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| National popular vote | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |

**Trade-off**: Most transformative reforms are hardest to pass
