# Electoral Reform: History

## Origins

### Why America Uses Plurality Voting

The Constitution says remarkably little about how elections should work:

- **Article I, Section 4**: States set "Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections"
- **No mention of**: Voting methods, how to count votes, or electoral systems
- **Result**: States defaulted to what they knew—British-style plurality voting

**The British Inheritance**
Plurality voting came from England, where it evolved from medieval practices:

- Simple to understand and administer
- Worked reasonably well with few candidates
- No awareness of mathematical problems (Duverger's Law not yet articulated)
- Alternatives not widely known

**The Founders' Blind Spot**
The Founders worried about many things—tyranny, faction, corruption—but not voting systems:

- Most elections were indirect (state legislatures chose senators; electors chose president)
- Franchise was limited (white male property owners)
- Political parties didn't exist yet (Washington warned against them)
- Two-party dominance emerged *after* the system was established

### The Emergence of Two-Party Dominance

**1790s-1800s: Parties Form**
Despite the Founders' warnings:

- Federalists vs. Democratic-Republicans emerged by 1796
- By 1800, two-party competition was entrenched
- Winner-take-all dynamics locked in the pattern

**1850s: Modern Parties Solidify**

- Whig Party collapses; Republican Party forms (1854)
- Democrats vs. Republicans since 1856
- 170+ years with the same two major parties
- No other democracy has had such stable two-party dominance

### Early Alternative Voting Movements

**The Progressive Era (1890s-1920s)**
Reformers experimented with alternatives:

- **Proportional representation**: Used in ~24 U.S. cities (1915-1960s)
- **Preferential voting**: Adopted in several cities
- **At-large elections**: Attempted to reduce machine politics

**What Happened**:

- PR produced multi-party city councils
- Threatened machine politicians and established parties
- Systematically repealed, often with racial undertones (fear of minority representation)
- By 1960s, almost all PR systems eliminated

## Key Turning Points

### 1912: The Spoiler That Changed History

**The Election**

- Theodore Roosevelt ran as third-party Progressive (Bull Moose)
- Split Republican vote with Taft
- Wilson won with just 42% of the vote

**Impact**

- Demonstrated spoiler effect at highest level
- Discouraged future third-party efforts
- Entrenched "don't waste your vote" mentality
- Roosevelt's 27% is best third-party showing since

### 1950s-1960s: PR Repealed Nationwide

**The Pattern**

- Cities with PR elected diverse, multi-party councils
- Established parties and interests fought back
- Racist arguments used (PR enabled Black representation)
- One by one, PR systems eliminated

**Cambridge, MA**: One of the only cities to keep PR; still uses it today

**Lesson**: Electoral reform can succeed—and can be reversed if not defended.

### 2000: Florida and the Spoiler Effect

**The Election**

- Bush vs. Gore decided by 537 votes in Florida
- Nader received 97,488 votes in Florida
- Most Nader voters preferred Gore to Bush

**Impact**

- Intense debate over "spoiler" blame
- Strengthened arguments both for and against third parties
- Renewed interest in alternative voting methods
- Led directly to modern RCV movement

### 2002: San Francisco Adopts RCV

**The Breakthrough**

- First major U.S. city to adopt RCV in modern era
- Implemented for local elections (2004)
- Proved RCV could work in American context

**Impact**

- Created proof of concept
- Built organizational expertise
- Sparked movement for state-level adoption
- San Francisco still uses RCV

### 2016: Maine Makes History

**The Victory**

- First state to adopt RCV for state and federal elections
- Passed via ballot initiative (52%)
- Survived legal challenges and repeal attempts

**Implementation**

- Used for first time in 2018 federal elections
- First RCV-decided congressional race in U.S. history
- Proved statewide implementation feasible

### 2020: Alaska's Bold Experiment

**The Model**

- Top-four nonpartisan primary
- RCV general election
- Eliminates partisan primaries entirely
- Most comprehensive reform yet

**2022 Results**

- Mary Peltola (D) won House seat in traditionally Republican state
- Lisa Murkowski (R) won Senate re-election as write-in had before
- Moderate candidates did well
- System worked as designed

### 2024: Repeal Defeated in Alaska

**The Challenge**

- Well-funded repeal effort
- Arguments that system was "confusing"
- Major party opposition

**The Victory**

- Voters rejected repeal
- Validated system after seeing it work
- Built momentum for adoption elsewhere

## Lessons from the Past

### Reform Is Possible—And Reversible

**The Progressive Era Shows Both**

- PR was adopted in 24 cities—proving it can happen
- PR was repealed in almost all—proving it can be undone
- Cambridge kept PR for 80+ years—proving it can last if defended

**Implication**: Win reforms *and* build constituencies to defend them.

### Ballot Initiatives Work

**Pattern of Success**

- San Francisco (2002): Ballot initiative
- Maine (2016): Ballot initiative
- Alaska (2020): Ballot initiative
- Nevada (2022): Ballot initiative

**Why**: Politicians won't vote against the system that elected them. Direct democracy bypasses this veto point.

### Implementation Builds Momentum

**The Demonstration Effect**

- Each successful implementation proves concept
- Maine showed statewide RCV works
- Alaska showed even more comprehensive reform works
- Success breeds success

**The Virtuous Cycle**: Adoption → Successful implementation → Reduced opposition → More adoption

### Opponents Will Fight Hard

**Consistent Opposition**

- Major parties opposed PR in 1950s
- Major parties opposed RCV in 2020s
- Pattern: Those in power resist changes that threaten power

**Counter-Strategy**: Build bipartisan coalitions, frame as voter empowerment, be ready for repeal attempts.

### Racial Politics Matter

**Historical Pattern**

- PR repeal often motivated by desire to limit minority representation
- Voting rights and electoral systems are intertwined
- See [Voting Rights](../voting-rights/01-overview.md)

**Today**: Frame electoral reform as expanding voice for all, not threatening anyone.

### Federalism Is Double-Edged

**Benefit**: States and cities can experiment without federal action
**Challenge**: Creates patchwork; some states will resist indefinitely

**Strategy**: Win where possible, create demonstration effects, build toward federal standards.

## What History Suggests for the Future

### The Current Moment

We are in the early stages of what could be a major reform wave:

- State-level adoption accelerating
- Public awareness growing
- Successful implementations building credibility
- Opposition strong but not insurmountable

### Historical Parallels

**Like the Progressive Era**:

- Widespread frustration with political system
- Reform energy at state and local levels
- Need to institutionalize gains

**Unlike the Progressive Era**:

- Better understanding of voting system mathematics
- National organizations coordinating reform
- Internet enables rapid organizing
- Less explicit racism to exploit (though dog whistles exist)

### The Question

Will this reform wave succeed and stick, or be rolled back like PR in the 1950s?

The answer depends on:

- Building durable organizations
- Winning elections under new systems (creating beneficiaries)
- Defending reforms against repeal
- Maintaining cross-partisan coalitions
