# Electoral Reform: Current State

## The Problem Today

### How Plurality Voting Works (and Fails)

The United States uses **plurality voting** (also called "first-past-the-post") for nearly all elections:

- Each voter casts one vote for one candidate
- The candidate with the most votes wins
- No majority required—you can win with 30% if the vote is split

**This seems simple and fair. It is neither.**

### The Spoiler Effect

When more than two candidates run, plurality voting produces perverse outcomes:

**Example: 2000 Presidential Election (Florida)**[^2]

- Bush: 48.85%
- Gore: 48.84%
- Nader: 1.63%

Exit polls showed most Nader voters preferred Gore to Bush.[^3] Nader "spoiled" the election by splitting the left-of-center vote. Under RCV, Gore almost certainly wins.

**This happens constantly at every level:**

- Third-party candidates are blamed for "spoiling" elections
- Voters are told they're "wasting their vote"
- Many voters don't vote their true preference out of strategic fear
- Third parties can never grow because of this dynamic

### Duverger's Law in Action

French political scientist [Maurice Duverger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Duverger) observed that plurality voting systems tend toward two-party dominance.[^1] The mechanism:

1. **Mechanical effect**: Plurality voting under-represents small parties (they win fewer seats than votes)
2. **Psychological effect**: Voters learn not to "waste" votes on third parties
3. **Strategic effect**: Politicians and donors consolidate into two competitive coalitions
4. **Feedback loop**: Two parties become entrenched, making alternatives seem impossible

**Result**: The U.S. has had the same two major parties since 1856.[^6] While some democracies using plurality voting (UK, Canada, India) sustain regional or niche third parties, none has achieved sustained *nationally competitive* multi-party democracy.

### Wasted Votes

In a typical U.S. election:

- **Votes for losing candidates**: Completely wasted—no representation
- **Excess votes for winners**: Also wasted—winner only needed 50%+1
- **Safe districts**: Outcomes predetermined; voting feels meaningless

**2022 House elections**: An estimated 50%+ of all votes were "wasted" in this sense—cast in districts where outcomes were never in doubt.[^5]

### Minority Winners

Plurality voting allows candidates to win without majority support:

| Election | Winner's Vote Share |
|----------|---------------------|
| 1992 Presidential (Clinton) | 43% |
| 1912 Presidential (Wilson) | 42% |
| Many gubernatorial races | 35-45% |
| Crowded primaries | Often 25-35% |

A voting system that regularly produces winners opposed by the majority is not democratic in any meaningful sense.

### Negative Campaigning

Under plurality voting, the strategic imperative is to make the other major candidate unacceptable:

- Attack ads dominate spending
- Candidates focus on opponent's negatives, not own positives
- Voters learn to hate the other side
- Contributes to polarization and declining trust

Under RCV, candidates seek to be voters' second choice, incentivizing coalition-building and civility.

## Key Statistics (as of 2024)

### Voter Dissatisfaction

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Americans who feel "trapped" by two-party system | 62%[^4] |
| Voters who would consider third-party candidate | 60%+ |
| Americans dissatisfied with both major parties | 40%+ |
| Trust that elections reflect "will of the people" | 45% |

### Electoral Competition

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Competitive House races (margin < 10%) | ~10% |
| States that are presidential "battlegrounds" | 6-8 |
| Races decided before general election (safe seats) | 85%+ |
| Third-party candidates winning federal office | ~0 |

### Voting System Adoption

| System | Where Used |
|--------|------------|
| Plurality voting | 48 states (general elections), most local |
| Ranked-choice voting | Maine, Alaska (statewide), 50+ cities |
| Top-two primary | California, Washington |
| Approval voting | Fargo ND, St. Louis MO |
| Proportional representation | 0 states (but many democracies) |

### Third Party Performance

| Party | 2020 Presidential Vote | House Seats |
|-------|----------------------|-------------|
| Libertarian | 1.2% | 0 |
| Green | 0.3% | 0 |
| All others | 0.5% | 0 |

Despite millions of votes, third parties hold essentially zero power at the federal level.

## Impact

### On Voters

**Forced False Choices**

- Must choose between two options that may not reflect views
- Cannot express nuanced preferences
- Third-party voting punished as "wasting" or "spoiling"
- Many don't vote at all out of frustration

**Strategic Voting**

- Voting for "lesser evil" instead of true preference
- Constant calculation about electability vs. preference
- Suppresses expression of genuine political diversity
- Creates cynicism about democratic participation

**Alienation**

- Independents (40%+ of electorate) have no party home
- Third-party supporters feel permanently marginalized
- Young voters disproportionately disengaged
- Declining faith in democratic legitimacy

### On Candidates and Campaigns

**Who Can Run**

- Only major-party candidates are viable
- Independent and third-party candidates are "spoilers"
- Ideological diversity within parties suppressed
- Many qualified candidates don't run

**How They Campaign**

- Negative ads dominate (attack other major candidate)
- Ignore third-party opponents (don't give them attention)
- Focus on base turnout, not persuasion
- Contributes to polarization

### On Governance

**Two-Party Dominance**

- All power concentrated in two parties
- Parties become "big tents" that please no one
- Primary voters (more extreme) control nominations
- General election voters stuck with primary's choice

**Extremism and Polarization**

- Safe-seat legislators answer only to primary voters
- Compromise punished, purity rewarded
- Two-party framing creates "us vs. them" mentality
- See [Party Systems](../party-systems/01-overview.md) for more

**Policy Outcomes**

- Policies don't reflect majority preferences
- Donor class preferences override public preferences
- Long-term problems ignored (no electoral incentive)
- See [Campaign Finance](../campaign-finance/01-overview.md) for more

## Recent Developments (as of 2024)

### Positive Momentum

**State-Level RCV Adoption**

- **Maine (2016)**: First state to adopt RCV for federal elections
- **Alaska (2020)**: Adopted top-four primary + RCV general election
- **Nevada (2022)**: Ballot measure passed (needs 2024 confirmation)

**City-Level Expansion**

- New York City implemented RCV for primaries (2021)
- 50+ cities now use RCV
- More cities considering adoption

**Growing Public Awareness**

- Reform organizations gaining visibility
- Media coverage of alternative voting increasing
- Successful implementations building momentum

### Challenges and Setbacks

**Repeal Efforts**

- Alaska repeal attempt (defeated 2024)
- Some localities have reversed RCV adoption
- Opposition well-funded and organized

**Legal Challenges**

- Constitutional challenges (mostly unsuccessful)
- State legislature attempts to preempt local adoption
- Litigation delays implementation

**Implementation Issues**

- Voter education challenges
- Election administration adjustments
- Transition costs (though modest)

### Current Battlegrounds

**States Considering RCV**

- Oregon, Colorado, Nevada (confirmation)
- Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona
- Multiple ballot initiatives in development

**Federal Legislation**

- Fair Representation Act (multi-member districts + RCV)
- Voter Choice Act (federal standards)
- Limited prospects in current Congress

**Local Campaigns**

- Dozens of cities considering RCV
- Growing municipal reform movement
- Local wins building state-level momentum

## The Gap Between Problem and Solution

The frustrating reality:

| The Problem | The Solution | The Gap |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| Plurality voting produces two-party dominance | Alternative voting methods exist | Inertia, opposition, lack of awareness |
| Voters hate being forced into lesser-evil choices | RCV lets voters rank preferences | Status quo benefits major parties |
| Third parties can never win | Proportional systems enable multi-party democracy | Entrenched interests block reform |
| Negative campaigning dominates | RCV incentivizes positive campaigns | Consultants profit from negativity |

The solutions are known and tested. The obstacle is political will—and the fact that those in power benefit from the current system.
