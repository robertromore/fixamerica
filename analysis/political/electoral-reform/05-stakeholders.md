# Electoral Reform: Stakeholders

## Who Benefits from the Status Quo

### The Two Major Parties

**Democratic and Republican Parties**

- Guaranteed one of them always wins
- No viable third-party competition
- Control of ballot access, debate access, election rules
- Billions in donations flow to them alone

**Specific Benefits**

- Monopoly on power (shared duopoly)
- Ability to run weak candidates without losing to third parties
- Control over who can compete
- Perpetual relevance regardless of performance

**Level of Opposition to Reform**: **High**

- Both parties quietly agree on maintaining duopoly
- Party leadership actively opposes RCV and alternative voting
- Will fund opposition to ballot initiatives

### Political Consultants and Campaign Industry

**Who**

- Campaign strategists, pollsters, ad makers
- Party-aligned data firms (NGP VAN, Data Trust)
- Political advertising agencies

**Why They Benefit**

- Expertise is party-specific
- Two-party races are their specialty
- Multi-party system would require new skills
- Status quo protects market position

**Level of Opposition**: **Medium-High**

- Generally quiet opposition
- Will advise clients against reform
- Business model depends on current system

### Incumbent Politicians

**Why They Benefit**

- Current system elected them
- Safe seats protected by gerrymandering + plurality voting
- Third-party challengers can't gain traction
- Primary is only real threat (see [Primary Reform](../primary-reform/01-overview.md))

**Level of Opposition**: **High** (for most)

- Won't vote against system that benefits them
- Exception: Some politicians from RCV states now support it

### Media Industry

**Why They Benefit**

- Two-party conflict is easy to cover
- Horse-race journalism requires exactly two horses
- Advertising revenue from two-party campaigns
- Multi-party systems more complex to cover

**Level of Opposition**: **Medium**

- More neglect than active opposition
- Frames reform as fringe or impractical
- Some outlets (nonprofit news) more supportive

## Who Is Harmed

### All Voters

**Forced False Choices**

- Must choose between two options that may not reflect views
- Cannot express preferences fully
- Strategic voting instead of sincere voting
- Lesser-evil voting as permanent condition

**Specific Harms**

- 62% feel "trapped" by two-party system
- Majority would consider third-party candidate if viable
- Declining faith in democratic legitimacy

### Third-Party Supporters

**Specific Harms**

- Votes are "wasted" or "spoilers"
- Blamed for outcomes they didn't want
- Cannot build parties over time (no incremental progress)
- Millions of votes, zero representation

**Groups Affected**

- Libertarians (fiscally conservative, socially liberal)
- Greens (environmental focus)
- Working Families Party supporters
- Any voter whose views don't fit D or R

### Independent Voters

**Size**: 40%+ of electorate

**Specific Harms**

- No party represents them
- Often excluded from closed primaries
- Forced to choose between two parties' nominees
- Fastest-growing political identity with least power

### Ideological Minorities Within Parties

**Who**

- Progressive Democrats in moderate districts
- Libertarian-leaning Republicans
- Anyone whose views don't match party median

**Specific Harms**

- Primary system controlled by party base
- General election offers no alternative
- Views suppressed within "big tent" parties
- No proportional representation for minority views

### Future Generations

**Specific Harms**

- Inherit two-party dysfunction
- Long-term problems (climate, debt) ignored
- Policy shaped by current two-party incentives
- No voice in reforms that would benefit them

## Who Has Power to Change Things

### Voters (via Ballot Initiatives)

**Power Level**: **High** (in 24 states)

**Mechanism**

- Bypass state legislatures entirely
- Direct democracy on election rules
- Has succeeded in Maine, Alaska, and cities

**Limitations**

- Only 24 states allow citizen initiatives
- Requires signature gathering (expensive)
- Major parties will fund opposition
- Some states have high thresholds

### State Legislatures

**Power Level**: **High** (but unlikely to use it)

**Mechanism**

- Set state election rules
- Could adopt RCV, proportional representation, etc.
- Control ballot access for third parties

**Limitations**

- Controlled by major parties
- Self-interest opposes reform
- Exceptions: Some reforms pass (Hawaii adopted RCV for some elections)

### Reform Organizations

**Power Level**: **Medium** (growing)

**Key Organizations**

| Organization | Focus |
|--------------|-------|
| FairVote | RCV, proportional representation |
| The Center for Election Science | Approval voting |
| Equal Vote Coalition | STAR voting |
| RepresentUs | Anti-corruption, electoral reform |
| Unite America | Electoral reform, independents |

**Role**

- Build coalitions
- Fund campaigns
- Provide expertise
- Coordinate nationally

### Courts

**Power Level**: **Medium**

**Role**

- Rule on constitutionality of reforms
- Have upheld RCV against challenges
- Could strike down reforms (risk)

**Key Rulings**

- RCV consistently upheld as constitutional
- No federal constitutional barrier to alternative voting

### Congress

**Power Level**: **High** (but won't use it)

**Mechanism**

- Could pass federal standards for elections
- Could repeal 1967 single-member district requirement
- Fair Representation Act would transform House elections

**Limitations**

- Controlled by major parties
- Filibuster blocks most legislation
- Self-interest opposes reform

## Potential Allies

- Independents have no home in either party
- Common enemy: the duopoly itself

**Messaging**

- "Let voters rank their choices"
- "More choices, not fewer"
- "Break the two-party stranglehold"
- Process reform, not partisan outcome

### Third Parties and Independents

### Coalition-Building Strategy

**Key Dynamics**

1. Reform coalition is broad but under-resourced
2. Opposition coalition is narrow but well-funded
3. Public opinion favors reform when explained
4. Ballot initiatives bypass opposition gatekeepers

**Tactical Implications**

- Lead with voter frustration, not technical details
- Build visible bipartisan support
- Use successful examples as proof
- Prepare for well-funded opposition
