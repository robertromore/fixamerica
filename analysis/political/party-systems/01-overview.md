# Party Systems: Overview

## Executive Summary

America's two-party system, while not constitutionally mandated, has become deeply entrenched through electoral rules, ballot access laws, and institutional structures. This duopoly limits voter choice, produces extreme polarization, and leaves millions of Americans feeling politically homeless. The rigid two-party structure fails to represent the ideological diversity of the American public and creates incentives for partisan warfare rather than problem-solving.

## The Core Problem

| Aspect | Issue |
|--------|-------|
| Limited choice | Only two viable parties nationally |
| Forced coalitions | Diverse views compressed into binary choice |
| Polarization | Parties incentivized to differentiate, not govern |
| Voter alienation | 40%+ identify as independents |
| Structural barriers | Election rules lock in two-party dominance |

## Why It Matters

**For Democracy**

- Voters forced into binary choices on complex issues
- Many perspectives have no representation
- Negative partisanship drives voter behavior
- Alienation from political process grows

**For Governance**

- Compromise becomes betrayal
- Gridlock preferred to bipartisan solutions
- Policy swings wildly with party control
- Long-term problems remain unsolved

**For Society**

- Politics becomes team sport
- Tribal identity overrides policy
- Civil discourse erodes
- National unity fractures

## Scope

**This Topic Covers**

- America's two-party system structure
- Third parties and barriers they face
- Party polarization and sorting
- Primary systems and party control
- Potential reforms to party systems

**Related But Separate Topics**

- Electoral systems (ranked choice, etc.)
- Campaign finance
- Congressional procedures
- Media and information

## Key Questions

1. Why does America have only two major parties?
2. What structural barriers prevent third parties?
3. How has party polarization accelerated?
4. What reforms could create more competitive elections?
5. Would more parties improve governance?

## Key Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Two-party system | Electoral competition dominated by two parties |
| Duverger's Law | Single-member plurality elections tend toward two parties |
| Party polarization | Increasing ideological distance between parties |
| Partisan sorting | Voters aligning with parties ideologically |
| Negative partisanship | Voting against the other party rather than for one |
| Third party | Any party besides Democrats and Republicans |
| Ballot access | Requirements to appear on election ballots |

## The Stakes

**Current Reality**

- 40%+ of voters identify as independent
- Congress approval at ~17%
- Extreme candidates win low-turnout primaries
- Policy fails to address major problems

**What's at Risk**

- Functional democracy
- Representative government
- Civil political discourse
- Effective governance

## Unique American Features

**Why America Differs**

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Single-member districts | Winner-take-all excludes minorities |
| Electoral College | Presidential election reinforces two parties |
| Separate executive | No coalition governments |
| State ballot laws | Each state creates barriers |
| Primary system | Parties control candidate selection |
