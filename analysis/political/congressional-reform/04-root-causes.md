# Congressional Reform: Root Causes

## Structural Causes

### Constitutional Design

**Senate Representation**

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Equal state representation | Wyoming = California |
| Two senators per state | Small-state overrepresentation |
| Staggered terms | Slow to change |
| Constitutional entrenchment | Requires unanimous state consent (Art. V)* |

*Article V prohibits depriving any state of equal Senate representation without its consent, making this provision politically near-impossible to amend.

**Bicameral Friction**

- Different constituencies
- Different term lengths
- Different cultures
- Built-in conflict

**Separation of Powers**

- Executive can govern without legislation
- Congress can block without governing
- Judicial review limits Congress
- Deadlock as feature, not bug

### Electoral Structure

**Single-Member Districts**

| Effect | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| Winner-take-all | Two-party system |
| Wasted votes | Uncompetitive districts |
| Gerrymandering | Safe seats |
| Extremism | Primary-driven selection |

**Staggered Elections**

- House: every 2 years
- Senate: every 6 years (1/3 at a time)
- No simultaneous mandate
- Gridlock between elections

**Primary System**

| Problem | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Low turnout | Activist-dominated |
| Ideological selection | Extreme candidates |
| Party base power | General electorate ignored |
| Incumbent insulation | Or vulnerability from right/left |

### Senate-Specific Structure

**The Filibuster's Roots**

| Factor | Contribution |
|--------|--------------|
| 1806 rule change | Enabled extended debate |
| Senate tradition | Minority rights valued |
| Small body | Individual power |
| Unlimited debate | Historical norm |

**Supermajority Requirement**

- 60 votes for cloture
- Effectively 60 to pass
- Minority veto on legislation
- Gridlock on partisan issues

**Individual Member Power**

| Tool | Effect |
|------|--------|
| Holds | Block nominations/bills |
| Unanimous consent | One objection stops action |
| Amendment rights | Unlimited (when floor open) |
| Obstruction incentive | Power through delay |

## Political Causes

### Partisan Polarization

**The Sorting**

| Dimension | Past | Present |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Party ideology | Overlapping | Distinct |
| Geographic sorting | Mixed | Concentrated |
| Media consumption | Shared | Siloed |
| Social networks | Cross-party | Same-party |

**Contributing Factors**

- Gerrymandering (safe seats)
- Primary incentives (ideological)
- Media fragmentation (echo chambers)
- Geographic sorting (urban/rural)
- Economic inequality (different realities)

### Electoral Incentives

**Short-Term Thinking**

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Constant elections | Always campaigning |
| Fundraising demands | Donor service |
| Media cycle | Sound bite governance |
| Polling focus | Responsive, not responsible |

**Opposition Incentive**

| Logic | Manifestation |
|-------|---------------|
| Majority success = reelection | Block majority |
| Crisis helps challengers | Create/allow crises |
| Bipartisanship helps majority | Refuse cooperation |
| Gridlock blamed on majority | Obstruct strategically |

### Campaign Finance

**Donor Influence**

| Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Fundraising time | 4+ hours/day |
| Donor access | Priority over constituents |
| Policy alignment | Positions shaped by donors |
| Independence loss | Fear of losing funding |

**Outside Money**

- Super PACs attack compromisers
- Dark money fuels primaries
- Ideological enforcement
- Moderation punished

## Institutional Causes

### Weakened Committees

**Power Shift to Leadership**

| Then | Now |
|------|-----|
| Committee-driven legislation | Leadership-driven |
| Chair expertise valued | Chair loyalty valued |
| Deliberative process | Messaging votes |
| Bipartisan mark-ups | Partisan products |

**Why Committees Weakened**

- Sunshine reforms (reduced private deals)
- Leadership centralization (control)
- Polarization (no bipartisan coalitions)
- Term limits on chairs (reduced expertise)

### Leadership Incentives

**Party Over Institution**

| Incentive | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Party electoral success | Prioritize messaging |
| Leadership ambition | Maintain power |
| Fundraising role | Donor satisfaction |
| Base satisfaction | Ideological purity |

**No Institutional Ownership**

- Members rotate through
- Short-term focus
- Party loyalty over institutional health
- Reforms that hurt party blocked

### Staff and Capacity Decline

**Intentional Reduction**

| Cause | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Cost-cutting | Less expertise |
| Anti-government ideology | Weaker institution |
| Lobbyist substitution | Outside influence |
| Low pay | Talent drain |

**Knowledge Gap**

- Complex issues, reduced capacity
- Lobbyists fill information void
- Executive branch more capable
- Policy quality suffers

## Procedural Causes

### Senate Rules

**Unanimous Consent Dependence**

| Feature | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Required for routine business | One objection stops action |
| Trust-based system | Exploitable |
| Time-consuming alternatives | Incentivizes obstruction |
| Individual leverage | Minority power |

**Filibuster Evolution**

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Two-track system (1970s) | Business continues despite filibuster |
| No speaking requirement | Costless obstruction |
| Routine use | 60 votes for everything |
| Threat as filibuster | No actual debate |

### House Rules

**Majority Steamroller**

| Tool | Effect |
|------|--------|
| Rules Committee | Controls floor process |
| Closed rules | No amendments |
| Time limits | Minimal debate |
| Hastert Rule | Only majority-supported bills |

**Minority Exclusion**

- Limited amendment opportunities
- Procedural votes only
- No committee power
- Messaging the only option

### Budget Process Dysfunction

**Broken Process**

| Feature | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| October 1 deadline | Rarely met |
| 12 appropriations bills | Rarely passed individually |
| Continuing resolutions | Governing by extension |
| Omnibus packages | Unreadable behemoths |

**Debt Ceiling**

- Separate from spending decisions
- Used as leverage
- Crisis-inducing
- Dysfunction incentive

## Cultural Causes

### Norms Erosion

**Lost Norms**

| Norm | Status |
|------|--------|
| Comity | Rare |
| Bipartisan socialization | Minimal |
| Regular order | Exception |
| Institutional loyalty | Weak |

**How Norms Eroded**

- Confrontation rewarded
- Cooperation punished
- Media incentives for conflict
- Generational change

### Tuesday-Thursday Club

**Lack of Relationship Building**

| Past | Present |
|------|---------|
| Members lived in DC | Fly in/out |
| Families knew each other | Don't interact |
| Social relationships | Minimal contact |
| Bipartisan friendships | Rare |

**Effect**

- No personal trust
- Easier to demonize
- No informal negotiation
- Permanent campaign mode

### Media and Communication

**Changed Environment**

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| 24/7 news cycle | Constant performance |
| Social media | Direct to base |
| Partisan media | Echo chambers |
| Conflict focus | Cooperation unrewarded |

## External Causes

### Executive Branch Expansion

**Congressional Abdication**

| Area | Effect |
|------|--------|
| War powers | AUMF, no new declarations |
| Emergencies | Broad delegations |
| Regulations | Agency rulemaking |
| Enforcement | Executive discretion |

**Why Congress Delegates**

- Avoid difficult votes
- Let executive take blame
- Complex issues delegated
- Gridlock prevents legislating

### Interest Group Ecosystem

**Lobbyist Influence**

| Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Information provision | Shapes policy |
| Revolving door | Future employment |
| Campaign support | Access and influence |
| Grassroots mobilization | Pressure on members |

**Organized vs. Diffuse Interests**

- Concentrated interests organize effectively
- Diffuse public interest underrepresented
- Corporate/wealthy interests overrepresented
- Public good undersupplied

### Judicial Decisions

**Court Impact**

| Decision | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Citizens United | Unlimited outside money |
| McCutcheon | Aggregate limits struck |
| Redistricting cases | Enabled partisan gerrymandering |
| Standing doctrine | Limited congressional enforcement |
