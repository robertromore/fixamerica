# Congressional Reform: Overview

## Executive Summary

Congress, designed as the first branch of government, has become increasingly dysfunctional. Partisan gridlock, procedural manipulation, lack of transparency, and insufficient oversight have undermined its ability to legislate, represent constituents, and check executive power. Reform is essential to restore Congress as an effective democratic institution.

## The Core Problem

### What's Broken

**Legislative Dysfunction**

| Symptom | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Gridlock | Major legislation increasingly rare |
| Deadline governance | Continuing resolutions, shutdown threats |
| Partisan votes | Near-zero bipartisan bills |
| Conference collapse | Fewer bills go through regular order |

**Procedural Manipulation**

| Problem | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Filibuster abuse | 60-vote threshold for everything |
| Holds and delays | Individual senators can block |
| Committee bypassing | Leadership controls process |
| Amendment blocking | No open debate |

**Representation Failures**

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Gerrymandering | Safe seats, extreme members |
| Money in politics | Donors over constituents |
| Revolving door | Industry capture |
| Low trust | 20% approval ratings |

**Oversight Decline**

| Trend | Consequence |
|-------|-------------|
| Reduced hearings | Less executive accountability |
| Partisan investigations | Weaponized oversight |
| Subpoena defiance | No enforcement |
| Staff cuts | Reduced capacity |

## Why This Matters

### For Democracy

**Separation of Powers at Risk**

- Executive branch accumulates power
- Congress delegates difficult decisions
- Courts fill legislative vacuum
- Constitutional balance eroded

**Representation Crisis**

- Constituents' needs unaddressed
- Public loses faith in institutions
- Cynicism and disengagement grow
- Legitimacy of government questioned

### For Policy

**Inability to Address Problems**

| Problem | Congressional Response |
|---------|------------------------|
| Climate change | No comprehensive legislation |
| Healthcare costs | Partisan stalemate |
| Immigration | Decades without reform |
| Infrastructure | Years of delay |
| Debt | Deadline-driven crises |

### For the Public

**Material Consequences**

- Problems go unsolved
- Crises managed, not prevented
- Policies outdated
- Services degraded

## Key Dimensions

### Structural Issues

**The Senate**

- Equal state representation regardless of population
- Filibuster requiring 60 votes
- Small-state overrepresentation
- Individual member power (holds)

**The House**

- Gerrymandered districts
- Majority party dominance
- Speaker's power
- Short terms, constant campaigning

### Procedural Issues

| Chamber | Key Problems |
|---------|--------------|
| Senate | Filibuster, holds, unanimous consent |
| House | Rules Committee control, closed rules |
| Both | Committee system weakened, regular order abandoned |

### Capacity Issues

**Institutional Decline**

- Congressional Research Service underfunded
- Member office staffing cut
- GAO capacity reduced
- Policy expertise outsourced to lobbyists

### Ethics Issues

| Area | Problem |
|------|---------|
| Financial conflicts | Stock trading, outside income |

| Disclosure | Inadequate transparency |

## Historical Context

### The Design

The Founders created Congress as:

- First branch (Article I)
- Most powerful branch
- Representative of the people and states
- Check on executive power

### The Evolution

| Era | Development |
|-----|-------------|
| 19th century | Party development, procedural evolution |
| Early 20th | Progressive reforms, direct Senate election |
| Mid-20th | Committee system strengthened, staff expansion |
| 1970s | Sunshine reforms, ethics rules |
| 1990s-present | Polarization, procedural warfare |

### The Decline

**Key Turning Points**

- 1990s: Gingrich revolution, increased polarization
- 2000s: Post-9/11 executive power expansion
- 2010s: Filibuster normalization, governing by crisis
- 2020s: Dysfunction accelerates
