# Congressional Reform: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Congressional reform requires a mix of statutory changes, rules amendments, and institutional investments. Unlike some reforms, most congressional improvements can be accomplished through legislation or internal rules changes—no constitutional amendments required. This document provides draft language for key reforms.

## Senate Rules Reforms

### Talking Filibuster Rule

**Purpose**: Restore the filibuster to its original meaning—continuous debate that imposes real costs on obstruction—while preserving minority rights to extended debate.

**Draft Rules Change**:

```text
STANDING RULE XXII (AMENDED)

1. CLOTURE MOTION. When it is desired to bring debate to a close,
   a motion may be presented by sixteen Senators.

2. CLOTURE PROCEDURE. After a cloture motion is presented:
   (a) Debate shall continue, with the following requirements:
       (i) At least one Senator opposing cloture must be present
           on the floor and speaking at all times;
       (ii) Debate must be germane to the measure before the Senate;
       (iii) No Senator may yield to another for purposes of speech
            without unanimous consent.
   (b) If at any time no Senator is present and speaking in
       opposition, the Presiding Officer shall put the question
       on the underlying matter.
   (c) The majority may move to table any non-germane amendments.

3. CLOTURE VOTE. At any time after 30 hours of continuous debate
   following the filing of a cloture motion, the Majority Leader may
   demand a vote on cloture, which shall require three-fifths of
   Senators duly chosen and sworn.

3A. POST-CLOTURE DEBATE. If cloture is invoked under section 3 or 4:
   (a) Debate shall be limited to 30 hours, divided equally between
       proponents and opponents;
   (b) Only germane amendments may be considered;
   (c) Upon expiration of debate time, the Presiding Officer shall
       put the question on final passage.

4. DECLINING THRESHOLD. If cloture fails:
   (a) A second cloture vote may be held after 48 additional hours,
       requiring 57 votes;
   (b) A third cloture vote may be held after 48 additional hours,
       requiring 54 votes;
   (c) A fourth cloture vote may be held after 48 additional hours,
       requiring 51 votes.

5. EXCEPTION. This rule shall not apply to:
   (a) Nominations, which require 51 votes for cloture;
   (b) Budget reconciliation measures;
   (c) Measures affecting the right to vote in federal elections.

**Explanation**:

- **Section 2(a)**: Requires actual continuous debate—the talking filibuster.
- **Section 2(b)**: If opponents stop talking, the matter proceeds to a vote.
- **Section 3**: Cloture vote occurs after 30 hours of continuous pre-cloture debate.
- **Section 3A**: Post-cloture debate capped at 30 hours split between sides, ensuring timely final vote.
- **Section 4**: Declining threshold ensures eventual majority rule while giving minority time to make their case.
- **Section 5(c)**: Carve-out for voting rights, following precedent of existing carve-outs.

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Minority party opposition | Preserves right to debate, just requires showing up |
| Abuse by majority | 30-hour minimum ensures real debate |
| Precedent concerns | Restores original filibuster practice |

### Holds Reform Rule

**Purpose**: Eliminate anonymous holds and create time limits on nomination and legislation holds.

**Draft Rules Change**:

```text
STANDING RULE (NEW)

HOLDS ON NOMINATIONS AND LEGISLATION

1. DISCLOSURE. Any Senator placing a hold on a nomination or
   legislative matter shall:
   (a) Notify the Majority Leader in writing within 24 hours;
   (b) Have the hold published in the Congressional Record within
       48 hours, including the Senator's name and stated reason.

2. TIME LIMITS.
   (a) Holds on nominations shall expire after 14 days unless
       renewed in writing.
   (b) Holds on legislation shall expire after 30 days unless
       renewed in writing.
   (c) No hold may be renewed more than twice.

3. EFFECT. A disclosed hold shall delay floor consideration for
   the period specified, after which the matter shall be eligible
   for scheduling without further hold.

4. SANCTIONS. Failure to disclose a hold shall result in:
   (a) Loss of priority in committee assignments;
   (b) Publication of the violation in the Congressional Record.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Rules Changes**:

- Each chamber has constitutional authority to set its own rules (Art. I, § 5)
- Filibuster reform requires only majority vote through "nuclear option"
- No constitutional bar to any proposed rules changes

**Statutory Reforms**:

- Stock trading ban: Constitutional as ethics requirement for public office
- OTA restoration: Clearly within congressional authority
- Oversight enhancement: May face executive privilege claims

### Enforcement Mechanisms

| Reform | Enforcement |
|--------|-------------|
| Senate rules | Presiding Officer rulings |
| House rules | Speaker enforcement |
| Stock ban | Ethics Committee, DOJ |
| Oversight | Courts, inherent contempt |
| Revolving door | DOJ prosecution |

### Sunset and Review

**Recommended**:

- GAO review of congressional capacity every 4 years
- Annual ethics violation reporting
- Periodic rules committee review of procedural reforms

### Revolving Door Reform

**Potential Loopholes**:

| Loophole | How Exploited | Severity |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| Strategic consulting | Advise clients without "lobbying contacts" | High |
| Foreign government work | Foreign Agents Registration Act has separate rules | High |
| "Educational" activities | Claim speaking, writing is not lobbying | Medium |
| Shadow lobbying | Manage lobbying strategy without direct contacts | High |
| State/local exception | Lobby state governments instead | Medium |
| Contractor role | Return as "consultant" rather than employee | Medium |

**Shortcomings**:

| Issue | Description | Impact |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Lifetime bans impractical | May face constitutional challenge | Moderate |
| Enforcement resources | DOJ has limited resources for these cases | Significant |
| Career penalty | Long bans may deter public service | Moderate |
| Definition complexity | Lobbying definition has many exceptions | Significant |

**Rectification Procedures**:

| Issue | Rectification Approach |
|-------|----------------------|
| Strategic consulting | Expand lobbying definition to include "strategic advice" |
| Shadow lobbying | Require registration for anyone compensated to influence government |
| State/local exception | Coordinate federal and state revolving door rules |
| Enforcement weakness | Create specialized enforcement unit; whistleblower rewards |
| Career deterrence | Provide pension enhancements for those subject to restrictions |
| Definition gaps | Use functional test: any paid effort to influence government |

### Cross-Cutting Issues

**Systemic Vulnerabilities**:

| Vulnerability | Affects | Mitigation |
|---------------|---------|------------|
| Rules can be changed | All Senate/House rules | Consider constitutional amendments for core reforms |
| Partisan enforcement | Ethics, oversight | Independent enforcement mechanisms |
| Member self-interest | All internal reforms | External pressure, voter accountability |
| Institutional culture | Capacity, ethics | Long-term culture change efforts |
| Resource dependence | OTA, CRS, GAO | Permanent, protected appropriations |

**Monitoring Requirements**:

| Metric | Frequency | Entity |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Filibuster usage statistics | Each Congress | CRS |
| Stock trading compliance | Quarterly | Ethics Committees |
| Subpoena compliance rates | Annually | GAO |
| Staff turnover rates | Annually | House/Senate admin |
| OTA assessment completion | Annually | OTA Board |

**Amendment Procedures**:

1. **Rules changes**: Simple majority at start of Congress; ongoing by supermajority
2. **Statutory amendments**: Standard legislative process with bipartisan support preferred
3. **Ethics updates**: Ethics Committee recommendations to full chamber
4. **Oversight improvements**: Judiciary Committee review of enforcement effectiveness
5. **Capacity adjustments**: Appropriations process with CRS/GAO input
