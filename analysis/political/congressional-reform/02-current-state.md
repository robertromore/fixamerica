**Debt Ceiling Crises**

### 118th Congress (2023-2024 snapshot)

- Legislative output in the 118th remains in the 300-400 law range, reinforcing the long-term decline captured by the CRS “Résumé of Congressional Activity.”*
- Fiscal 2024 and 2025 entailed repeated stopgap funding, a last-minute sectoral continuing resolution in December 2023, and the August 2023 debt ceiling standoff that edged close to default before a bipartisan deal.
- Oversight hearings and major authorizing bills have been concentrated in a handful of committees, with most policy fights resolved through floor-level negotiation rather than floor votes.
