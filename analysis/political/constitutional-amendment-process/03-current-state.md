## Article V Convention Activity (as of 2024)

### Current Convention Applications

*Sources: Article V Library; National Conference of State Legislatures, 2024.*

**Balanced Budget Amendment Convention**:

States with active applications (counts disputed):

| Organization Count | States Counted | Notes |
|-------------------|----------------|-------|
| High count | 34+ | Includes old, unclear applications |
| Conservative count | 28 | Active, specific applications |
| Strictest count | 20-25 | Clearly valid, recent applications |

*Dispute over whether threshold has been met or nearly met*

**Convention of States Project**:

- Purpose: Amendments for term limits, fiscal restraints, federal power limits
- States passed: 19 (as of late 2024)
- States needed: 34
- Organization: Conservative-led (Mark Meckler)

**Wolf-PAC** (Campaign Finance):

- Purpose: Free and fair elections amendment (overturn *Citizens United*)
- States passed: 5 (CA, VT, NJ, IL, RI)
- States needed: 34
- Organization: Progressive-led

**Other Applications**:

- Various historical applications on record
- Questions about aggregation of different applications
- Some states have rescinded prior applications

### Legal Uncertainties

**Unresolved Questions**:

| Question | Status |
|----------|--------|
| Can applications be aggregated across topics? | Unclear |
| Can states limit convention to specific topics? | Disputed |
| Who sets convention rules? | Congress vs. convention dispute |
| Can states rescind applications? | Unclear |
| What is Congress's role? | Limited precedent |

### Congressional Response

**Potential Responses to Convention Call**:

- Congress could propose amendment itself (preemptive)
- Congress must call convention (arguably ministerial)
- Questions about congressional control over convention

**Legislation Proposed**:

- Various bills to establish convention procedures
- None enacted
- Bipartisan interest in clarifying process

## Equal Rights Amendment Controversy

### Current Status

**Ratification Timeline**:

| Event | Date |
|-------|------|
| Congressional passage | March 1972 |
| Original deadline | March 1979 |
| Extended deadline | June 1982 |
| 38th state (Virginia) | January 2020 |

**The Dispute**:

- Three states ratified after 1982 deadline (NV 2017, IL 2018, VA 2020)
- Five states attempted to rescind ratification
- Congress debate over removing deadline
- Archivist refused to certify
- Litigation ongoing

**Key Legal Questions**:

| Question | Arguments |
|----------|-----------|
| Is deadline valid? | Part of proposal vs. procedural only |
| Can Congress extend/remove deadline? | Congressional power vs. state reliance |
| Can states rescind? | Coleman v. Miller leaves to Congress |
| Is ERA currently ratified? | Three federal lawsuits active |

### Congressional Action

**Recent Efforts**:

- House passed deadline removal (2020, 2021)
- Senate has not acted
- Executive branch position unclear

- Federations handle differently

## Assessment of Current State

- Partisan polarization blocks congressional path
- Convention path uncertain and controversial
- Important reforms blocked

### Workarounds

- Judicial interpretation as amendment substitute
- State constitutional change
- Interstate compacts
- Statutory approximations

### Risks

- Constitutional ossification

- Runaway convention fears
- Unresolved legal questions
- Democratic frustration
