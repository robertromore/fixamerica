The constitutional amendment process encompasses the formal mechanisms for changing the U.S. Constitution as established in Article V, as well as informal means of constitutional change through interpretation, practice, and state constitutional amendments. Reform of the amendment process addresses concerns about its difficulty, democratic legitimacy, and effectiveness in allowing necessary constitutional evolution.
