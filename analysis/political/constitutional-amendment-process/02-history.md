# Constitutional Amendment Process: History

## Origins at the Constitutional Convention (1787)

### Debates on Amendment Procedure

The Framers recognized the need for constitutional change:

- Articles of Confederation required unanimous state consent for amendment
- This proved unworkable, contributing to convention call
- Framers sought balance between flexibility and stability

**Madison's View**: Constitution should be amendable but not too easily:

> "That useful alterations will be suggested by experience, could not but be foreseen. It was requisite therefore that a mode for introducing them should be provided."

**Key Decisions**:

| Issue | Decision |
|-------|----------|
| Proposal threshold | Two-thirds of Congress OR convention |
| Ratification threshold | Three-fourths of states |
| Unamendable provisions | Slave trade (temporary), equal Senate suffrage |
| Ratification method | State legislatures OR state conventions |

### Convention vs. Congressional Path

The convention option was included to allow:

- States to bypass Congress if necessary
- Check on congressional power
- Alternative if Congress refuses to act

George Mason argued for convention option because Congress "may abuse their power, and refuse their consent on that very account."

## Bill of Rights (1789-1791)

### Promise During Ratification

- Anti-Federalists demanded amendments as condition of ratification
- Several states ratified with proposed amendments
- Madison pledged to pursue amendments in First Congress

### Madison's Role

- Compiled proposals from state ratifying conventions
- Drafted amendments addressing common concerns
- Guided amendments through Congress
- Twelve amendments proposed, ten ratified

### Process Characteristics

- Relatively quick ratification (about 2 years)
- Broad consensus on core protections
- Some proposed amendments (on representation, congressional pay) not ratified initially
- Demonstrated amendment process could work

## Early Republic (1791-1860)

### Limited Amendment Activity

Only two amendments in this period:

**11th Amendment (1795)**:

- Response to *Chisholm v. Georgia* (1793)
- States could not be sued in federal court by citizens of other states
- Quick ratification (less than 1 year)

**12th Amendment (1804)**:

- Response to 1800 election crisis (Jefferson-Burr tie)
- Separate Electoral College votes for President and Vice President
- Moderate consensus, relatively quick ratification

### Failed Proposals

Numerous amendments proposed but not adopted:

- Amendments to abolish or limit slavery
- Amendments affecting war powers
- Various structural changes

### Informal Constitutional Change

Between amendments, Constitution evolved through:

- *Marbury v. Madison* (1803): Judicial review
- Bank of the United States debates
- Executive precedents (Louisiana Purchase)
- Party development

## Civil War and Reconstruction (1860-1870)

### Crisis and Constitutional Change

The Civil War created conditions for transformative amendment:

**13th Amendment (1865)**:

- Abolished slavery
- Passed by Congress before war ended
- Required compliance from former Confederate states
- Ratified in 10 months

**14th Amendment (1868)**:

- Citizenship, due process, equal protection
- Most litigated amendment in history
- Required by Reconstruction Acts
- Controversial ratification process

**15th Amendment (1870)**:

- Prohibited racial discrimination in voting
- Compromise version (did not guarantee suffrage)
- Ratification completed during Reconstruction

### Ratification Controversies

Questions about legitimacy of Reconstruction amendments:

- Southern states forced to ratify as condition of readmission
- Some states initially rejected then reconsidered
- Secretary of State certified despite procedural irregularities
- Generally accepted despite questions

### Lessons

- Constitutional moments can overcome normal barriers
- Crisis creates opportunity for change
- Enforcement crucial to amendment effectiveness
- Political will matters as much as formal process

## Gilded Age Through Progressive Era (1870-1920)

### Long Gap

No amendments from 1870 to 1913 (43 years):

- Numerous proposals but none successful
- Growing reform movements unable to amend
- Party system resistant to constitutional change
- Courts increasingly interpreted existing provisions

### Progressive Amendment Burst

Four amendments in 7 years:

**16th Amendment (1913)**:

- Authorized federal income tax
- Overturned *Pollock v. Farmers' Loan* (1895)
- Response to economic inequality concerns
- Ratified relatively quickly

**17th Amendment (1913)**:

- Direct election of Senators
- Long campaign by reformers
- State legislatures ratified despite reducing their power
- Response to corruption in Senate selection

**18th Amendment (1919)**:

- Prohibition of alcohol
- Decades of temperance movement
- War mobilization accelerated passage
- Later repealed (only amendment repealed)

**19th Amendment (1920)**:

- Women's suffrage
- Decades of organizing and activism
- Narrowly ratified (36th state decisive)
- Expanded electorate dramatically

### Progressive Era Lessons

- Sustained social movements can achieve amendment
- Political context matters (WWI helped)
- Economic change creates pressure for constitutional change
- Multiple amendments can occur in reform moments

## Mid-20th Century (1920-1970)

### Limited Activity

Only four amendments in this period:

**20th Amendment (1933)**:

- Changed presidential/congressional terms
- Reduced "lame duck" period
- Relatively uncontroversial

**21st Amendment (1933)**:

- Repealed Prohibition
- Only amendment ratified by state conventions
- Quick ratification (under 10 months)

**22nd Amendment (1951)**:

- Presidential term limits (two terms)
- Response to FDR's four terms
- Republican-led, partisan in origin
- Later regretted by some supporters

**23rd Amendment (1961)**:

- D.C. Electoral College representation
- Did not grant full voting rights
- Compromise measure

### Informal Change

Major constitutional development through interpretation:

- New Deal: Commerce Clause expansion
- *Brown v. Board of Education*: 14th Amendment
- Incorporation of Bill of Rights
- Executive power expansion

## Rights Revolution (1960s-1970s)

### Amendment Activity

Four amendments in 10 years:

**24th Amendment (1964)**:

- Prohibited poll taxes in federal elections
- Part of civil rights movement
- Left state elections unaddressed (until Harper v. Virginia)

**25th Amendment (1967)**:

- Presidential succession and disability
- Response to Kennedy assassination concerns
- Later used (Nixon resignation, Reagan surgery)

**26th Amendment (1971)**:

- Lowered voting age to 18
- Response to Vietnam War ("old enough to fight, old enough to vote")
- Fastest ratification in history (100 days)

**27th Amendment (1992)**:

- Congressional pay raises delayed until next election
- Originally proposed in 1789
- Ratified over 200+ years
- Raised questions about ratification timeline

### ERA Effort

**Equal Rights Amendment**:

- Passed Congress 1972
- Widely expected to ratify
- Fell 3 states short of 38
- Raised questions about ratification process:
    - Time limits on ratification
    - Rescission of ratification
    - Role of Congress in process

### Lessons

- Popular momentum can produce quick ratification (26th)
- Opposition can defeat even popular amendments (ERA)
- Procedural questions become substantive
- Social movements essential but not sufficient

## Contemporary Period (1990s-Present)

### Ratification Drought

No amendments since 1992:

- Longest period without new amendment since pre-Civil War
- Many proposals, none achieving supermajorities
- Partisan polarization makes consensus difficult
- Important reforms blocked

### Convention Movement

Growing interest in Article V conventions:

**Balanced Budget Movement**:

- 28+ states have applied (counts disputed)
- Closest to threshold ever
- Legal questions unresolved

**Convention of States**:

- Broader convention for federalism amendments
- 19 states passed applications (as of 2024)
- Conservative-led effort

**Wolf-PAC**:

- Convention for campaign finance amendment
- 5 states passed applications
- Progressive-led effort

### ERA Revival

**Recent Developments**:

- Virginia ratified 2020 (38th state)
- Legal dispute over validity
- Time limit and rescission questions
- Litigation ongoing

### Failed Proposals

| Proposal | Period | Outcome |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Flag Desecration | 1989-2006 | Failed in Senate (one vote short) |
| Balanced Budget | Various | Never achieved 2/3 |
| Term Limits | 1995 | Failed in House |
| Marriage Definition | 2004-2006 | Failed in Senate |
| D.C. Voting Rights | 1978 | Failed ratification (only 16 states) |

### Current Landscape

- Deep partisan division makes amendment nearly impossible
- Convention path gaining interest as congressional path blocked
- State constitutional processes more active
- Informal change through interpretation continues

## Patterns and Lessons

### Constitutional Moments

Amendments cluster during extraordinary periods:

| Period | Context | Amendments |
|--------|---------|------------|
| Founding | Ratification | Bill of Rights |
| Reconstruction | Civil War | 13, 14, 15 |
| Progressive Era | Reform movement | 16, 17, 18, 19 |
| Rights Revolution | Social movements | 24, 25, 26 |

### Success Factors

- Broad social movement support
- Crisis or extraordinary circumstances
- Bipartisan (or pre-partisan) consensus
- Clear, focused proposals
- Organized ratification campaigns

### Failure Factors

- Partisan division
- Organized opposition
- Complexity of proposal
- Procedural disputes
- Lack of urgency
