# Constitutional Amendment Process: Legislation

## Overview

This document provides model legislation to clarify and reform the constitutional amendment process. Because fundamental changes to Article V require constitutional amendment, most reforms achievable through ordinary legislation focus on clarifying existing procedures, particularly for Article V conventions. State-level reforms and long-term federal amendments are also addressed.

## Federal Legislation

### Article V Convention Procedures Act

**Purpose**: Establish clear procedures for Article V conventions to enable this constitutional path and reduce uncertainty.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Article V Convention Procedures
Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that—
(1) Article V of the Constitution provides for proposing
    amendments through conventions called on application of
    two-thirds of state legislatures;
(2) No Article V convention has been held, creating uncertainty
    about procedures;
(3) Uncertainty deters legitimate use of this constitutional
    mechanism;
(4) Congress has authority and responsibility to establish
    procedures for conventions it is required to call.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(a) "Application" means a formal application by a state
    legislature requesting Congress to call a convention under
    Article V.
(b) "Convention" means a convention called under Article V of
    the Constitution for proposing amendments.
(c) "Delegate" means a person selected by a state to represent
    it at a convention.
(d) "Subject matter" means the topic or topics specified in
    applications triggering the convention.

SEC. 4. APPLICATIONS.

(a) FORM.—Each application shall:
    (1) Identify itself as an application under Article V;
    (2) Specify the subject matter for which a convention
        is requested;
    (3) Be adopted by formal action of both chambers of the
        state legislature (or by the method specified in state
        law for Article V applications);
    (4) Be transmitted to Congress by the presiding officers
        of both chambers.

(b) SPECIFICITY.—Applications shall be sufficiently specific
    to enable determination of whether applications from
    different states address the same subject matter.

(c) RESCISSION.—A state may rescind an application by the same
    process used to adopt it, provided rescission occurs before
    Congress has called a convention based on that application.

(d) EXPIRATION.—Applications expire 7 years after adoption
    unless renewed by formal action of the state legislature.

(e) DATABASE.—The Archivist of the United States shall maintain
    a public database of all applications, including their
    subject matter, date, and current status.

SEC. 5. COUNTING APPLICATIONS.

(a) AGGREGATION.—Applications shall be counted toward the
    two-thirds threshold only if they address substantially
    the same subject matter.

(b) DETERMINATION.—
    (1) The presiding officers of both chambers of Congress
        shall determine, within 6 months of receiving an
        application that would bring the total to 34 or more,
        whether the threshold has been met.
    (2) The determination shall be published in the
        Congressional Record with detailed reasoning.
    (3) The determination shall be subject to judicial review.

(c) SUBSTANTIAL SIMILARITY.—Applications need not be identical
    but must address the same subject matter such that a
    convention limited to that subject could propose amendments
    responsive to all aggregated applications.

SEC. 6. CALLING THE CONVENTION.

(a) MINISTERIAL DUTY.—Upon determination that two-thirds of
    state legislatures have submitted valid applications on
    the same subject matter, Congress shall call a convention.

(b) TIME AND PLACE.—The call shall specify:
    (1) The date and location of the convention;
    (2) The subject matter, as derived from the applications;
    (3) Provisions for delegate credentials.

(c) TIMING.—The convention shall convene not less than 6 months
    and not more than 12 months after the call.

SEC. 7. CONVENTION PROCEDURES.

(a) DELEGATES.—
    (1) Each state shall be represented by delegates selected
        in accordance with state law.
    (2) Each state shall have one vote at the convention.
    (3) The number of delegates per state shall be determined
        by state law but shall not exceed [10].

(b) SUBJECT MATTER LIMITATION.—
    (1) The convention shall be limited to proposing amendments
        on the subject matter specified in the call.
    (2) Any proposed amendment outside the subject matter shall
        be void and of no effect.
    (3) The subject matter limitation shall be enforceable by
        any state or Member of Congress in federal court.

(c) RULES.—
    (1) The convention shall adopt its own rules by majority
        vote of the states.
    (2) Rules shall include provisions for:
        (A) Presiding officers;
        (B) Committees;
        (C) Debate procedures;
        (D) Voting procedures;
        (E) Public access and transparency.

(d) QUORUM.—A majority of states (26) shall constitute a quorum
    for conducting business.

(e) VOTING.—
    (1) Each state shall have one vote.
    (2) A proposed amendment must receive votes from a majority
        of states (26) to be transmitted for ratification.

    [90] days of convening, unless extended by two-thirds vote.

SEC. 8. AMENDMENT TRANSMISSION.

(a) TRANSMISSION.—Any amendment proposed by the convention
    shall be transmitted to the Archivist of the United States
    and to Congress.

(b) VALIDITY CHECK.—Within 30 days of transmission, the
    Archivist shall determine whether the proposed amendment
    falls within the subject matter of the convention.

(c) JUDICIAL REVIEW.—The Archivist's determination shall be
    subject to judicial review.

(d) RATIFICATION.—Upon a valid determination, the Archivist
    shall transmit the proposed amendment to the states for
    ratification pursuant to Article V.

SEC. 9. RATIFICATION.

Unless the proposed amendment specifies otherwise, ratification
shall be by the legislatures of three-fourths of the states.

SEC. 10. FEDERAL FUNDING.

(a) AUTHORIZATION.—There are authorized to be appropriated such
    sums as necessary to support the convention, including:
    (1) Facilities and logistics;
    (2) Recording and transcription;
    (3) Public access;
    (4) Security.

(b) STATE COSTS.—Each state shall bear the costs of its own
    delegation.

SEC. 11. JUDICIAL REVIEW.

(a) JURISDICTION.—The United States District Court for the
    District of Columbia shall have original jurisdiction over:
    (1) Disputes over application counting;
    (2) Subject matter limitation enforcement;

```

**Explanation**:

This legislation addresses the major uncertainties surrounding Article V conventions by:
- Establishing clear application requirements and counting rules
- Confirming subject matter limitations are enforceable
- Providing for judicial review
- Setting basic convention procedures while respecting state role
- Creating a workable process that can actually be used

### Ratification Timeline Clarification Act

**Purpose**: Establish clear rules for ratification timelines prospectively.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Ratification Timeline
Clarification Act".

SEC. 2. APPLICABILITY.

This Act applies to amendments proposed by Congress after the
date of enactment. It does not affect the status of any
amendment proposed before the date of enactment.

SEC. 3. RATIFICATION DEADLINE.

(a) DEFAULT DEADLINE.—Unless Congress specifies otherwise in
    the text of a proposed amendment, states shall have 10 years
    from the date of congressional proposal to ratify.

(b) SPECIFIED DEADLINE.—Congress may include a different
    deadline in the text of a proposed amendment.

(c) DEADLINE EXTENSION.—Congress may extend a deadline by
    joint resolution adopted by two-thirds of each chamber,
    provided the extension is adopted before the original
    deadline expires.

SEC. 4. RESCISSION.

(a) PERMITTED.—A state may rescind its ratification of a
    proposed amendment by the same process used to ratify,
    provided rescission occurs before the three-fourths
    threshold is reached.

(b) FINAL.—Once three-fourths of states have ratified, all
    ratifications are final and no state may rescind.

SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date of enactment.
```

### ERA Resolution

**Purpose**: Express the sense of Congress regarding the Equal Rights Amendment.

**Note**: This is illustrative of the type of congressional action possible; the specific position is provided as an example.

```text
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives,

That Congress recognizes that the Equal Rights Amendment,
proposed by Congress in 1972 and ratified by 38 states,
satisfies the requirements of Article V for adoption as an
amendment to the Constitution; OR

That Congress recognizes that the ratification deadline for
the Equal Rights Amendment has expired and that the amendment
has not been validly ratified.

[One of the above positions would be adopted]
```

## Constitutional Amendments

### Amendment to Add National Referendum Option

**Purpose**: Allow ratification by national referendum as alternative to state ratification.

**Draft Text**:

```text
Section 1. Article V of the Constitution is amended to add
the following:

"Congress, in proposing an amendment, may specify that the
amendment shall be ratified upon approval by a majority of
voters in a national referendum, provided that such majority
includes at least 55 percent of all votes cast."

Section 2. Congress shall have power to establish procedures
for conducting national referendum elections under this article.

Section 3. This article shall take effect one year after
ratification.
```

**Explanation**:

This amendment would provide an alternative ratification method that:
- Includes direct citizen participation
- Maintains supermajority requirement (55%)
- Preserves existing ratification methods as options
- Leaves implementation details to Congress

### Amendment to Lower Ratification Threshold

**Purpose**: Reduce state ratification threshold from 3/4 to 2/3.

**Draft Text**:

```text
Section 1. Article V of the Constitution is amended by
striking "three fourths" wherever it appears and inserting
"two thirds".

Section 2. This article shall take effect upon ratification.
```

**Note**: This amendment would be extraordinarily difficult to ratify under current rules, as 13 states can block and many small states benefit from current high threshold.

### Amendment to Add Citizen Initiative

**Purpose**: Allow citizens to propose constitutional amendments directly.

**Draft Text**:

```text
Section 1. Amendments to this Constitution may be proposed by
petition signed by voters equal in number to 5 percent of the
votes cast in the most recent presidential election, distributed
among at least two-thirds of the states with signatures in each
state equal to at least 3 percent of votes cast in that state
in the most recent presidential election.

Section 2. Amendments proposed by petition shall be submitted
to the states for ratification, or to a national referendum,
as Congress shall determine.

Section 3. Congress shall have power to establish procedures
for verifying petition signatures and for conducting referendum
elections.

Section 4. No amendment proposed under this article shall
diminish the protections of individual rights secured by this
Constitution.

Section 5. This article shall take effect two years after
ratification.
```

## State Model Legislation

## Regulatory Framework

### Archivist Procedures

Model regulations for the Archivist under the Convention Procedures Act:

1. **Application Database**
    - Real-time public access
    - Search by subject matter
    - Status tracking
    - Historical archive

2. **Counting Procedures**
    - Subject matter categorization
    - Aggregation determinations
    - Notification procedures
    - Record keeping

3. **Amendment Certification**
    - Subject matter review
    - Transmission procedures
    - Ratification tracking
    - Final certification

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Authority

**For Convention Procedures Act**:

- Necessary and Proper Clause
- Congressional power to implement Article V
- Historical precedent (setting ratification method)
- Reasonable procedural regulation

**Potential Challenges**:

- Does Congress have authority to limit convention?
- Can Congress make subject matter limits enforceable?
- What is scope of judicial review?

### Judicial Review

**Justiciable Questions**:

- Application counting
- Subject matter compliance
- Procedural regularity

**Potentially Political Questions**:

- Ratification disputes historically political
- *Coleman v. Miller* may limit judicial role
- But clarity of statutory rules may change analysis

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Subject matter stretching | Convention proposes beyond stated subject | High |
| Counting manipulation | Congress manipulates application counts | Moderate |
| Delegate faithlessness | Delegates vote contrary to state instructions | Moderate |
| Timeline gaming | States delay/accelerate for strategic advantage | Low |
| Judicial non-enforcement | Courts refuse to enforce limits | High |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Cannot fundamentally reform Article V | Limits scope of achievable change | Constitutional amendment required |
| Small state veto preserved | Undemocratic features persist | Constitutional structure |
| Congressional gatekeeping | Congress still proposes most amendments | Article V structure |
| Uncertainty about judicial role | Courts may not enforce | Political question doctrine |
| State-by-state ratification | Slow and cumbersome | Constitutional requirement |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Subject Matter Enforcement**

    - Different state interests
    - Political division
    - Timing challenges

3. **Judicial Caution**
    - Courts may be reluctant to engage
