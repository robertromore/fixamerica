# Constitutional Amendment Process: Problems

## Excessive Difficulty

### Problem Statement

The U.S. Constitution is among the most difficult to amend in the world, preventing necessary adaptations and entrenching outdated provisions.

### Evidence

**Statistical Comparison**:

| Constitution | Age | Amendments | Per Decade |
|--------------|-----|------------|------------|
| United States | 235+ | 27 | 1.1 |
| Germany | 75 | 60+ | 8 |
| India | 75 | 100+ | 13 |
| South Africa | 30 | 17 | 5.7 |

**Thresholds Compared**:

| Country | Proposal Threshold | Ratification |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| United States | 2/3 both chambers | 3/4 states |
| Germany | 2/3 both chambers | Same vote |
| France | Majority both chambers | 3/5 joint session OR referendum |
| Australia | Majority Parliament | Referendum majority |

**Success Rate**:

- Over 11,000 amendments proposed in Congress
- 33 sent to states
- 27 ratified
- Success rate: 0.24%

### Root Causes

- Framers' fear of instability
- Federal structure requiring state consent
- Supermajority requirements at multiple stages
- No provision for popular initiative

### Impacts

- Constitutional provisions persist despite obsolescence
- Courts become de facto amenders through interpretation
- Political energy diverted from formal amendment
- Democratic frustration with unamendable structure

## Undemocratic Features

### Problem Statement

The amendment process violates democratic principles by giving small states disproportionate power and excluding citizens from direct participation.

### Evidence

**Small State Advantage**:

| Statistic | Data |
|-----------|------|
| States needed to block | 13 |
| Population of 13 smallest states | ~14 million (~4%) |
| California's population | ~39 million (~12%) |
| California's vote in ratification | 1 of 50 (2%) |

**Examples of Distortion**:

- 4% of population can block any amendment
- Wyoming's vote equals California's
- No popular ratification option
- Citizens never vote directly

**Comparison with State Processes**:

| Feature | Federal | Typical State |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| Popular initiative | No | 18 states yes |
| Referendum ratification | Rare (once) | Common |
| Citizen participation | Indirect only | Often direct |

### Root Causes

- Senate representation equally by state
- State legislature ratification default
- No provision for national referendum
- 18th-century design for different country

### Impacts

- Amendments favored by large majorities can fail
- Small, rural states have effective veto
- Citizens feel excluded from constitutional governance
- Legitimacy of constitutional change questioned

## Convention Uncertainty

### Problem Statement

The Article V convention mechanism is surrounded by unresolved legal questions that create risk of chaos if a convention is called.

### Evidence

**Unresolved Questions**:

| Question | Possible Answers | Consequences |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| Can conventions be limited? | Yes/No | Runaway convention risk |
| Who sets rules? | Congress/States/Convention | Control disputes |
| Can applications be aggregated? | Yes/No | Threshold disputes |
| Can states rescind? | Yes/No | Count disputes |
| What is quorum? | Unknown | Legitimacy questions |

**Historical Lack of Precedent**:

- No Article V convention ever held
- 1787 Convention precedent: Exceeded its mandate (revise Articles)
- State conventions offer limited guidance
- Academic consensus absent

**Legal Opinions Vary**:

- Scholars disagree fundamentally
- No Supreme Court guidance
- Congress hasn't legislated
- Stakes too high for experimentation

### Root Causes

- Article V text brief and vague
- No implementing legislation
- No historical practice
- Political stakes prevent clarification

### Impacts

- Legitimate convention path essentially unusable
- Fear of runaway convention
- Gaming of application process
- Alternative to congressional path blocked

## Ratification Timeline Issues

### Problem Statement

The Constitution provides no timeline for ratification, creating uncertainty about when proposals expire and whether old applications remain valid.

### Evidence

**ERA Timeline Controversy**:

| Position | Argument |
|----------|----------|
| ERA is ratified | 38 states ratified; deadline not in amendment text |
| ERA expired | Deadline passed; states relied on it |
| Congress decides | Political question doctrine |
| Courts decide | Constitutional interpretation required |

**27th Amendment Anomaly**:

- Proposed in 1789
- Ratified in 1992
- 203 years between proposal and ratification
- Raises question: Can any old proposal be revived?

**Convention Applications**:

- Applications from 1900s still on record
- No clear expiration
- Aggregation questions
- Counting disputes

### Root Causes

- Constitution silent on timing
- *Coleman v. Miller* (1939) deemed political question
- Congress sets deadlines inconsistently
- No clear precedent

### Impacts

- Uncertainty undermines ratification campaigns
- Disputes over validity
- Old applications complicate convention counts
- Legal challenges likely for any close call

## Congressional Gatekeeping

### Problem Statement

Congress controls most aspects of the amendment process, potentially blocking amendments that would limit congressional power.

### Evidence

**Congressional Control**:

| Decision | Who Decides |
|----------|-------------|
| Propose amendments | Congress (2/3) |
| Set ratification method | Congress |
| Set ratification deadline | Congress |
| Count convention applications | Congress |
| Call convention | Congress |
| Set convention rules | Disputed (Congress claims) |

**Conflicts of Interest**:

- Term limits amendments must pass through Congress
- Campaign finance must pass Congress
- Congressional ethics must pass Congress
- Congressional pay already addressed (27th)

**Evidence of Blocking**:

- Term limits: ~80% public support, never proposed
- Campaign finance: Strong support, never proposed
- Balanced budget: Majority support, fell one vote short

### Root Causes

- Article V gives Congress primary role
- Convention path uncertain, so Congress dominant
- Self-interest in maintaining power
- No external check on gatekeeping

### Impacts

- Popular amendments blocked
- Congress protects itself
- Amendment process serves Congress's interests
- Public frustration with unresponsive system

## Ratification Rescission Uncertainty

### Problem Statement

It is unclear whether states can rescind ratifications, creating legal uncertainty and strategic manipulation.

### Evidence

**Historical Instances**:

| Amendment | States Attempting Rescission |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| 14th Amendment | New Jersey, Ohio |
| ERA | 5 states (NE, TN, ID, KY, SD) |
| ERA | Recent reaffirmation by some |

**Legal Status**:

- *Coleman v. Miller*: Political question
- Congress has counted rescinded ratifications historically
- No definitive legal ruling
- Scholarly disagreement

**Current ERA Dispute**:

- 5 states rescinded
- If rescission valid: 33 states (not 38)
- If invalid: 38 states (ratified)
- Courts/Congress must decide

### Root Causes

- Constitution silent on rescission
- Political question doctrine
- Historical inconsistency
- Stakes high enough to litigate

### Impacts

- Ratification campaigns face uncertainty
- Strategic rescission possible
- Courts may be forced to decide political questions
- Legitimacy of ratified amendments questioned

## Partisan Polarization

### Problem Statement

Deep partisan division makes achieving the supermajorities required for amendment nearly impossible.

### Evidence

**Current Partisan Composition**:

| Chamber | Closest to 2/3 (recent) |
|---------|------------------------|
| House | ~435-55% max for any amendment |
| Senate | 60-40 at best for bipartisan issues |
| State legislatures | Red/blue division mirrors federal |

**Amendment Politics**:

| Amendment | Partisan Alignment |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Balanced budget | Republican |
| Term limits | Mixed, more Republican |
| Campaign finance | Democratic |
| ERA | Democratic |
| Electoral College reform | Democratic |
| Gun rights | Republican |

**Historical Comparison**:

- Most amendments passed in less polarized eras
- Reconstruction: One party dominant
- Progressive Era: Cross-party reform coalitions
- 1960s-70s: Bipartisan civil rights consensus

### Root Causes

- Ideological sorting of parties
- Geographic polarization
- Media environment
- Primary system incentives
- Gerrymandering

### Impacts

- Bipartisan supermajorities nearly impossible
- Amendment process effectively frozen
- Informal change substitutes for formal
- Constitutional legitimacy affected

## Federalism Distortion

### Problem Statement

The amendment process embeds and reinforces federalism distortions, making it nearly impossible to address state malapportionment.

### Evidence

**Self-Protecting Provisions**:

Article V prohibits amending equal state suffrage in Senate without state consent.

**Implications**:

| Reform | Barrier |
|--------|---------|
| Senate reform | Protected by Article V |
| Electoral College reform | Small states will block |
| D.C. statehood (by amendment) | Small states may block |
| Any change reducing state power | States control ratification |

**The 4% Veto**:

- 13 states can block any amendment
- Small states benefit from current system
- No incentive to ratify reforms reducing their power
- Circular protection

### Root Causes

- Framers' compromises on federalism
- State equality in ratification
- Self-interest of small states
- Path dependency

### Impacts

- Structural reforms nearly impossible
- Small state overrepresentation perpetuated
- Democratic deficits cannot be corrected
- Constitutional evolution blocked in key areas

## Summary of Problems

| Problem | Severity | Fixability |
|---------|----------|------------|
| Excessive difficulty | High | Moderate (requires amendment) |
| Undemocratic features | High | Low (requires amendment) |
| Convention uncertainty | High | Moderate (legislation possible) |
| Timeline issues | Moderate | Moderate (legislation/practice) |
| Congressional gatekeeping | High | Low (structural) |
| Rescission uncertainty | Moderate | Moderate (legislation/courts) |
| Partisan polarization | Very High | Low (systemic) |
| Federalism distortion | High | Very Low (protected) |
