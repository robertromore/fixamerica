# Direct Democracy: Roadmap

## Strategic Considerations

### Building Blocks Approach

Direct democracy reform requires sequential building:

1. **Prove concepts** at local level
2. **Expand** to state level
3. **Demonstrate** effectiveness
4. **Build** momentum for federal reform

### Legitimacy First

Reforms must prioritize legitimacy:

- Bipartisan support where possible
- Evidence-based design
- Protect minority rights
- Transparent processes

### Parallel Tracks

Pursue multiple reform paths simultaneously:

- **State improvements**: Fix existing initiative processes
- **Innovation pilots**: Test citizen assemblies, digital tools
- **Federal preparation**: Build case for national reforms
- **Coalition building**: Unite diverse stakeholders

## Phase 1: State-Level Improvements (Year 1-3)

### Initiative Process Reform

**Target States**: Oregon, California, Colorado, Washington

**Legislation**:

- Citizen Initiative Review expansion

**Model Bill Elements**:

1. Free drafting assistance for initiative proponents
2. 60-day review period before circulation
3. Citizen review panels for all qualified measures
4. Clear, neutral ballot language requirements

**Coalition**:

- Good government groups (Common Cause, LWV)
- Bar associations (ballot clarity)
- Civic engagement organizations
- Bipartisan reform legislators

### Participatory Budgeting Expansion

**Target Cities**: 20 new programs

**Scale**:

- Municipal programs ($1-10 million each)
- School district pilots
- County-level pilots

**Implementation**:

1. Partner with existing PB organizations (PBP)
2. Provide technical assistance and training
3. Develop shared platforms and tools
4. Document outcomes for advocacy

**Metrics**:

- Number of participants
- Diversity of participation
- Project completion rates
- Participant satisfaction
- Replication in new jurisdictions

### Citizen Assembly Pilots

## Phase 2: State Innovation (Year 3-5)

## Phase 3: Federal Foundations (Year 5-8)

### National Citizen Assembly

**Congressional Action**:

Establish by statute:

1. Create National Citizens' Advisory Assembly
2. Random selection of 500 citizens
3. Rotating 2-year terms
4. Study major issues, produce recommendations
5. Congress required to respond (not follow)

**Path**:

- Congress determines questions
- Results inform but don't bind

**Initial Uses**:

- Major policy questions (healthcare, climate)
- Structural reform questions
- Constitutional amendment priorities

## Phase 4: Constitutional Reform (Year 8-15)

### National Popular Vote Activation

**Timeline**: When compact reaches 270 electoral votes

**Preparation**:

- Legal defense strategy ready
- Public education campaign
- Transition planning
- Monitoring system established

**If Challenged**:

**Comprehensive Reform**:

Could combine direct democracy with other reforms:

- National popular vote for president
- Federal initiative process
- Automatic voter registration
- Election day holiday
- Campaign finance reform

**Strategy**:

- Build coalition across reform movements
- Demonstrate public support
- Long-term constitutional campaign
- State resolutions supporting
