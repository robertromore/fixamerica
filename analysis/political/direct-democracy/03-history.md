# Direct Democracy: History

## Ancient and Classical Foundations

### Athenian Democracy (508-322 BCE)

**Direct Participation**:

- All male citizens participated in Assembly (Ecclesia)
- 6,000 quorum for major decisions
- 40 Assembly meetings per year
- Decisions by majority vote

**Key Institutions**:

- **Assembly**: All citizens voted on laws, war, treaties
- **Council of 500**: Selected by lot, set Assembly agenda
- **Courts**: Large juries (201-501) decided cases
- **Magistrates**: Selected by lot, one-year terms

**Sortition (Selection by Lot)**:

- Most offices filled randomly from eligible citizens
- Prevented concentration of power
- Assumed all citizens capable of governance
- Exception: generals elected (expertise needed)

**Limitations**:

- Excluded women, slaves, foreigners (majority of population)
- Limited to city-state scale
- Collapsed under Macedonian conquest

### Roman Republic

**Direct Elements**:

- Tribal and centuriate assemblies
- Citizens voted on laws and magistrates
- But weighted by wealth and social class

**Mixed System**:

- Senate (elite deliberation)
- Assemblies (popular ratification)
- Magistrates (executive)

### Swiss Cantons (Medieval to Present)

**Landsgemeinde** (open-air assemblies):

- Citizens gather in public square
- Raise hands to vote
- Still practiced in two cantons (Glarus, Appenzell Innerrhoden)
- Origin of referendum tradition

## American Founding Era

### Founding Debates

**Anti-Federalist Position**:

- Favored smaller republics with more direct participation
- Concerned about distant federal government
- Wanted more frequent elections
- Supported recall and instruction of representatives

**Federalist Position** (Madison's Federalist 10):

- Large republic as check on "faction"
- Representatives would "refine and enlarge public views"
- Rejected direct democracy as prone to passion
- Designed system to filter popular opinion

**Constitutional Design**:

- No national referendum mechanism
- No recall of federal officials
- Indirect election of senators (until 1913)
- Electoral College for president
- Deliberate distance from direct popular control

### Early State Experiments

**Town Meetings** (New England):

- Direct citizen participation in local governance
- Originated in Massachusetts (1630s)
- Continue today in New England
- Model for participatory democracy

**State Constitutional Ratification**:

- Massachusetts (1780): First constitution ratified by popular vote
- New Hampshire (1784): Popular ratification
- Established precedent for citizen approval

## Progressive Era (1890-1920)

### Rise of Direct Democracy

**Context**:

- Industrial concentration and monopolies
- Corrupt state legislatures ("railroad legislatures")
- Limited responsiveness to public concerns
- Reform movements seeking popular power

**South Dakota (1898)**: First state to adopt initiative and referendum

**Oregon System** (1902):

- Initiative, referendum, and recall adopted
- Became model for other states
- Promoted by William U'Ren and Direct Legislation League
- Called "Oregon System" nationally

- Never passed Congress
- Supported by Progressive Party (1912 platform)
- Theodore Roosevelt endorsed
- William Jennings Bryan supported

## Mid-20th Century (1920-1970)

### Decline of Initiative Use

**Factors**:

- New Deal addressed many Progressive concerns
- Trust in representative government higher
- Court decisions limited some initiatives
- Complexity of modern governance

**Usage Statistics**:

- 1910s: 269 statewide initiatives
- 1920s: 197
- 1930s: 177

- Housing discrimination (Prop 14, 1964)

**Alaska and Hawaii**:

- Both adopted initiative systems at statehood (1959)

## California's Tax Revolt (1970s-1980s)

### Proposition 13 (1978)
