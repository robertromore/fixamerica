# Direct Democracy: Overview

## Executive Summary

Direct democracy mechanisms allow citizens to participate in lawmaking beyond electing representatives. While the United States is primarily a representative democracy, direct democracy tools exist at the state and local levels—ballot initiatives, referendums, and recall elections. Growing dissatisfaction with representative institutions has renewed interest in expanding these mechanisms, including potential federal applications and newer innovations like citizen assemblies and participatory budgeting.

## The Core Questions

1. **Participation**: How can citizens more directly influence policy beyond voting for representatives?
2. **Responsiveness**: Can direct democracy make government more responsive to public preferences?
3. **Quality**: Do direct democracy mechanisms produce better or worse policy outcomes?
4. **Safeguards**: How can direct democracy be designed to protect minority rights and prevent manipulation?
5. **Scale**: Can direct democracy work at the national level, or only locally?
