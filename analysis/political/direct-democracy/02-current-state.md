### Initiative Types

**Direct Initiative**: Measure goes directly to ballot upon qualifying

- Used in most initiative states
- Faster path to ballot
- No legislative involvement required

**Indirect Initiative**: Measure goes to legislature first

- Legislature can adopt, amend, or reject
- If rejected, then goes to ballot
- Used in: Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio, Utah

**Constitutional vs. Statutory**: Different signature thresholds

- Constitutional amendments typically require more signatures
- Some states only allow constitutional initiatives (Florida)
- Some require legislative referral for constitutional changes

### Signature Requirements and Qualification

| State | Statutory Initiative | Constitutional Initiative | Geographic Distribution |
|-------|---------------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| California | 5% of last gubernatorial | 8% of last gubernatorial | None |
| Oregon | 6% of last gubernatorial | 8% of last gubernatorial | None |
| Colorado | 5% of Secretary of State race | 5% of Secretary of State race | None |
| Florida | N/A | 8% of votes cast (presidential) | Required in half of congressional districts |
| Nevada | 10% of votes cast | 10% of votes cast | 10% from 75% of assembly districts |
| Missouri | 5% of votes cast (6 congressional districts) | 8% of votes cast (6 districts) | Geographic distribution required |

## Referendum Systems

### Legislative Referendum

All 50 states allow legislatures to refer measures to voters:

**Common Uses**:

- Constitutional amendments (required in 49 states)
- Bond measures and major spending
- Controversial legislation (political cover)
- Tax increases

**Recent Examples**:

- Alabama: 2020 had 6 statewide constitutional amendments
- New York: 2021 redistricting and voting rights amendments
- Louisiana: Regular constitutional amendments every election

### Popular Referendum (Veto Referendum)

Twenty-three states allow citizens to challenge enacted laws (2024 snapshot):

| State | Signature Requirement | Time Limit | Recent Use |
|-------|---------------------|------------|------------|
| Oregon | 4% of last gubernatorial | 90 days after session | 2020: challenged carbon pricing |
| Washington | 4% of last gubernatorial | 90 days | Gun measures, affirmative action |
| California | 5% of last gubernatorial | 90 days | Rarely used (initiative preferred) |
| Michigan | 5% of last gubernatorial | 90 days | Emergency manager law |
| Maine | 10% of gubernatorial | 90 days | Ranked choice voting defense |

**Process**:

1. Legislature passes law
2. Citizens gather signatures within time limit
3. Law suspended pending vote
4. Voters approve or reject

## Recall Elections

### State-Level Recall

Nineteen states allow recall of state officials (2024 snapshot):

| State | Signature Requirement | Grounds Required | Recent Use |
|-------|---------------------|------------------|------------|
| California | 12% of last vote for office | No | 2021 Governor recall attempt |
| Wisconsin | 25% of votes cast for governor | No | 2012 Governor recall election |
| Michigan | 25% of votes cast | No | Multiple legislative recalls |
| Colorado | 25% of votes cast | No | 2013 gun control recalls |
| Arizona | 25% of votes cast | No | 2011 Senate President recall |

**Types of Recall Procedures**:

1. **Simultaneous election**: Recall vote and replacement election together (California pre-2024)
2. **Two-stage**: Recall first, then separate replacement election
3. **Succession**: If recalled, next in line assumes office

### Local Recall

More widespread than state-level:

- Most states allow recall of local officials
- Lower signature thresholds
- More frequently successful
- School boards, city councils, mayors
