# Direct Democracy: Solutions

## Framework for Reform

Effective direct democracy reform must:

1. **Increase participation** while ensuring representativeness
2. **Improve deliberation** quality over raw voting
3. **Protect minorities** from majority tyranny
4. **Reduce money influence** in campaigns
5. **Ensure informed voting** through better information
6. **Scale appropriately** for issue and jurisdiction

## Citizen Assemblies

### Problem

Traditional direct democracy (initiatives, referenda) involves voting without deliberation. Voters often lack information and may be manipulated by campaigns.

### Solution: Randomly Selected Deliberative Bodies

**Structure**:

- Randomly select 100-500 citizens (stratified for representativeness)
- Participants learn about issue from experts
- Facilitated deliberation over multiple sessions
- Produce recommendations or binding decisions

**Implementation Models**:

| Model | Duration | Output | Binding? |
|-------|----------|--------|----------|
| Irish Citizens' Assembly | 18 months | Recommendations to government | Advisory (leads to referendum) |
| French Climate Convention | 9 months | Detailed policy proposals | Mixed (some adopted) |
| Oregon Citizens' Initiative Review | 4-5 days | Voter pamphlet statement | Informational |
| British Columbia Electoral Reform | 11 months | Referendum recommendation | Led to referendum |

**Benefits**:

- Ordinary citizens can deliberate effectively
- Representative of full population (not just engaged)
- Insulated from campaign manipulation
- Produces nuanced recommendations

**Application Areas**:

- Constitutional questions
- Long-term policy (climate, pensions)
- Contentious social issues
- Electoral and political reform

### Citizen Initiative Review (Oregon Model)

**Process**:

1. Randomly select 20-24 citizens for each ballot measure
2. Panelists spend 4-5 days reviewing measure
3. Hear from proponents, opponents, experts
4. Produce "Citizens' Statement" for voter pamphlet
5. Statement includes key findings and arguments

**Results**:

- Operating since 2011
- Improves voter knowledge
- Increases confidence in vote choice
- Could be expanded to more states

**Proposed Expansion**:

- Adopt in all initiative states
- Require Citizens' Statement in voter guides
- Fund through filing fees or public budget
- Train facilitators statewide

## Initiative Process Improvements

### Problem

Current initiative processes are expensive, manipulated, and produce poorly drafted measures.

### Solution: Multi-Stage Review Process

**Stage 1: Drafting Assistance**

- Free legal drafting services for proponents
- Constitutional review before circulation
- Fiscal impact analysis required
- Plain language review

**Stage 2: Signature Gathering Reform**

- Ban paid per-signature gathering
- Allow online signature collection
- Extend circulation period
- Geographic distribution requirements (prevents urban concentration)

**Stage 3: Legislative Review**

- Legislature can adopt, amend with proponent consent, or refer
- If adopted/amended, no ballot measure
- Creates negotiation opportunity
- Used in "indirect initiative" states

**Stage 4: Ballot Presentation**

- Clear, neutral ballot titles (independent commission)
- Plain language summary
- Required Citizens' Statement
- Pro/con arguments from verified sources

### Single-Subject Rule Reform

**Current Problem**:

- Single-subject rules inconsistently enforced
- Used strategically to strike measures
- Unclear what constitutes single subject

**Solution**:

- Clear definition of single subject
- Pre-circulation review (not post-passage challenge)
- Advice to proponents, opportunity to cure
- Consistent judicial standards

### Supermajority Requirements for Constitutional Amendments

**Current Problem**:

- Simple majority can amend constitution
- Constitutional clutter
- Hard to undo amendments

**Solution**:

- Require 55-60% for constitutional amendments
- Simple majority for statutory initiatives
- Or: Require passage in two consecutive elections
- Florida model (60% required)

## Participatory Budgeting Expansion

### Problem

Citizens have little direct say in how public money is spent.

### Solution: Institutionalized Participatory Budgeting

**Municipal Model**:

1. City allocates portion of budget to PB (typically 1-5%)
2. Residents propose projects in neighborhood meetings
3. Volunteer delegates develop proposals
4. All residents vote on final projects
5. Winning projects implemented

**School District Model**:

- Students participate in allocating portion of budget
- Youth engagement and civic education
- Age-appropriate processes

**State-Level Model** (New):

- Allocate portion of discretionary budget to PB
- Regional assemblies develop proposals
- Statewide voting on final allocation
- Focus on capital projects

**Proposed Federal Pilot**:

- Community Development Block Grant portion
- Federal lands management priorities
- National service project selection

### Digital Participatory Budgeting

**Platform Features**:

- Online proposal submission
- Discussion forums for deliberation
- Multi-language access
- Mobile-friendly interface
- In-person options for digital have-nots

**Examples**:

- Madrid's Decide Madrid platform
- Reykjavik's Better Reykjavik
- Taiwan's vTaiwan consensus platform

## Federal Direct Democracy

### Problem

No mechanism exists for national direct citizen input on policy.

### Solution A: Advisory National Referendum

**Structure**:

- Congress can refer questions to national vote
- Results non-binding but politically significant
- Accompany general elections
- Inform congressional action

**Benefits**:

- Clear signal of public preferences
- Bypasses polling limitations
- Creates accountability
- Precedent for further reforms

**Limitations**:

- Congress controls agenda
- Non-binding may be ignored
- Could be used for political manipulation

### Solution B: National Citizen Assembly

**Structure**:

- Permanently operating body of 500-1000 randomly selected citizens
- Rotating membership (1-2 year terms)
- Study major national issues
- Produce recommendations to Congress
- Could trigger mandatory congressional vote

**Powers (escalating options)**:

1. **Advisory only**: Recommendations published
2. **Response required**: Congress must respond to recommendations
3. **Vote required**: Recommendations trigger floor vote
4. **Conditional binding**: Pass if Congress doesn't act within time limit

**Precedent**:

- Congressional commissions
- Citizen assembly successes internationally
- Growing academic support

### Solution C: Constitutional Amendment for Federal Initiative

**Structure**:

- Citizens can place measures on national ballot
- Signature threshold: 3-5% of prior presidential vote (~4-7 million)
- Geographic distribution required (signatures from 2/3 of states)
- Subject limitations (no foreign policy, no rights restrictions)
- Judicial review before and after passage

**Constitutional Amendment Text** (Conceptual):

Section 1: Citizens may propose laws through national initiative.

Section 2: Proposals require signatures of 4% of votes cast in most recent presidential election, distributed among at least 34 states.

Section 3: Qualified initiatives appear on next general election ballot.

Section 4: Initiatives passing by majority become law, subject to judicial review.

Section 5: Initiatives may not restrict rights protected by this Constitution, declare war, or ratify treaties.

Section 6: Congress may enact implementing legislation.

**Challenges**:

- Constitutional amendment extremely difficult
- No precedent at federal level
- Congress has no incentive to pass
- Uncertain constitutionality of statutory alternative

## National Popular Vote

### Problem

Presidential elections don't reflect national popular vote. Electoral College distorts campaigns and can elect popular vote losers.

### Solution: National Popular Vote Interstate Compact

**How It Works**:

- States agree to award electoral votes to national popular vote winner
- Compact activates when states totaling 270+ electoral votes join
- Effectively creates national popular vote without constitutional amendment

**Current Status**:

- 17 states + DC (209 electoral votes)
- 61 more electoral votes needed
- Passed one chamber in additional states

**Path to 270**:

| State | Electoral Votes | Status |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| Current members | 209 | Enacted |
| Pennsylvania | 19 | Passed one chamber |
| Virginia | 13 | Active consideration |
| Michigan | 15 | Passed one chamber |
| Wisconsin | 10 | Active consideration |
| Nevada | 6 | Passed, vetoed |

**Constitutional Questions**:

- Compact Clause (requires congressional consent?)
- State legislative authority over electors
- Equal protection concerns
- Likely to face Supreme Court challenge

## Digital Democracy Platforms

### Problem

Physical participation barriers limit who can engage in direct democracy.

### Solution: Secure Digital Participation Infrastructure

**Platform Components**:

1. **Secure identity verification** (government ID integration)
2. **Deliberation forums** (moderated discussion)
3. **Proposal submission** (citizen-initiated ideas)
4. **Voting systems** (secure, verifiable)
5. **Transparency tools** (track decisions, spending)

**Security Requirements**:

- End-to-end encryption
- Paper backup/audit trail
- Open source code (auditable)
- Accessibility compliance
- Multi-language support

**Phased Implementation**:

1. **Advisory input** (opinions on issues)
2. **Participatory budgeting** (allocate limited funds)
3. **Agenda setting** (citizens raise issues for legislative consideration)
4. **Binding votes** (local decisions, eventually broader)

**Privacy Protections**:

- Vote secrecy maintained
- Personal data protected
- Deliberation can be anonymous
- Results aggregated

## Recall Reform

### Problem

Recall elections are expensive, destabilizing, and often used for partisan purposes.

### Solution: Improved Recall Standards

**Higher Thresholds**:

- Increase signature requirements (25-35% of votes cast)
- Shorter gathering period (reduces frivolous attempts)
- Geographic distribution requirements

**Grounds Requirements**:

- Require stated grounds (malfeasance, incapacity)
- Not mere policy disagreement
- Or: Higher threshold for policy-based recalls

**Process Improvements**:

- Two-stage process (recall vote separate from replacement)
- If recalled, succession rather than special election
- Limit timing (not in first/last year of term)

**California 2024 Reform**:

- Changed from simultaneous recall/replacement
- Now requires replacement election if recalled
- Prevents minority candidate winning

## Implementation Priorities

| Reform | Impact | Feasibility | Timeline |
|--------|--------|-------------|----------|
| Citizen Initiative Review (state) | Moderate | High | 1-2 years |
| Participatory budgeting expansion | Moderate | High | 1-3 years |
| Initiative process improvements | Moderate | Moderate | 2-4 years |
| State citizen assemblies | High | Moderate | 2-5 years |
| National Popular Vote Compact | High | Moderate | 3-7 years |
| National Citizen Assembly | High | Low | 5-10 years |
| Federal initiative (amendment) | Very High | Very Low | 10+ years |
