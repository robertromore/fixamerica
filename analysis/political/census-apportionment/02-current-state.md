# Census and Apportionment: Current State

## The Problem Today

### Post-2020 Census Landscape

The 2020 census was conducted under extraordinary circumstances: a global pandemic, legal battles over the citizenship question, compressed timelines, and unprecedented political pressure. The results are now shaping representation and funding for the entire decade, but significant questions remain about accuracy and integrity.

**Key Issues**

- Differential undercount persists for minorities and hard-to-reach populations
- Census Bureau independence was tested and found wanting
- Differential privacy implementation created new accuracy concerns
- Funding adequacy for 2030 planning is uncertain
- House at 435 seats increasingly inadequate for growing population

### 2020 Census Results

**Population Summary**

| Measure | Count |
|---------|-------|
| Total U.S. population | 331,449,281 |
| Increase from 2010 | 22.7 million (7.4%) |
| Slowest growth rate | Since 1930s |

**Apportionment Impact**

States gaining representation:

- Texas: +2 seats (now 38)
- Colorado, Florida, Montana, North Carolina, Oregon: +1 each

States losing representation:

- California, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia: -1 each

**Close Calls**

| State | Margin to Change |
|-------|-----------------|
| New York | Lost seat by 89 people |
| Minnesota | Kept seat by 26 people |
| Rhode Island | Nearly lost a seat |

### Census Bureau Independence Crisis

**2020 Political Interference Timeline**

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| March 2018 | Commerce Secretary adds citizenship question |
| June 2019 | Supreme Court blocks citizenship question |
| July 2020 | Trump memo to exclude undocumented from apportionment |
| August 2020 | Census deadline shortened by a month |
| October 2020 | Trump appointees oversee data processing |
| December 2020 | Supreme Court rules case not ripe |
| January 2021 | Biden reverses exclusion policy |

**Structural Vulnerabilities**

- Census Bureau Director serves at pleasure of President
- Bureau within Commerce Department, subject to political appointees
- No statutory protections for professional staff decisions
- Budget controlled by annual appropriations (vulnerable to cuts)

### Differential Undercount

**Post-Enumeration Survey Results (2020)**

| Population | Net Coverage Error |
|------------|-------------------|
| Non-Hispanic White | +1.64% (overcounted) |
| Black alone | -3.30% (undercounted) |
| Hispanic | -4.99% (undercounted) |
| American Indian/Alaska Native (on reservation) | -5.64% (undercounted) |
| Asian | -2.62% (undercounted) |
| Children under 5 | -2.79% (undercounted) |
| Renters | -1.48% (undercounted) |
| Owners | +0.43% (overcounted) |

**Impact Calculation**

A 5% undercount in a minority community means:

- 5% less political representation
- 5% less federal funding
- 5% less planning consideration
- Compounded over 10-year census cycle

### American Community Survey

**Current Operations**

| Metric | Data |
|--------|------|
| Surveys sent annually | ~3.5 million households |
| Response rate | ~85% (with follow-up) |
| Data products | 1-year and 5-year estimates |
| Topics covered | 40+ including income, education, housing |

**Role in Governance**

The ACS provides ongoing demographic data between censuses, used for:

- Federal program eligibility
- Small-area planning
- Business and research decisions
- Civil rights enforcement

**Challenges**

- Declining response rates
- Privacy concerns
- Complexity of questionnaire
- Resource constraints for follow-up

## Key Statistics

### Representation Disparities

**People per Representative (2020 Apportionment)**

| State | Population | Reps | Pop/Rep |
|-------|------------|------|---------|
| Delaware | 989,948 | 1 | 989,948 |
| Montana | 1,084,225 | 2 | 542,113 |
| Rhode Island | 1,097,379 | 2 | 548,690 |
| Wyoming | 576,851 | 1 | 576,851 |
| California | 39,538,223 | 52 | 760,350 |
| Texas | 29,145,505 | 38 | 767,013 |

**Maximum Disparity**: Delaware residents have 45% less representation than Montana residents

### Historical House Size

| Year | Population | House Size | Pop/Rep | Constitutional Min |
|------|------------|------------|---------|-------------------|
| 1790 | 3.9M | 65 | 60,000 | 1:30,000 |
| 1850 | 23.2M | 237 | 98,000 | 1:30,000 |
| 1900 | 76.2M | 391 | 195,000 | 1:30,000 |
| 1930 | 123M | 435 | 283,000 | 1:30,000 |
| 1960 | 179M | 435 | 412,000 | 1:30,000 |
| 2020 | 331M | 435 | 761,000 | 1:30,000 |

**The Gap**: We now have 25x the constitutional minimum ratio of constituents per representative

### Census Funding

**2020 Decennial Census Lifecycle Costs**

| Phase | Cost |
|-------|------|
| Planning (2012-2017) | $2.4 billion |
| Testing (2017-2019) | $1.8 billion |
| Operations (2019-2021) | $7.3 billion |
| Post-processing (2021-2023) | $1.2 billion |
| **Total** | **~$14.2 billion** |

**Cost Per Housing Unit**: ~$100

**Budget Adequacy Concerns**

- 2030 planning has begun with uncertain funding
- Internet response infrastructure needs updating
- Advertising and outreach budgets critical for hard-to-count areas
- Field operations most expensive, most important component

## The Reform Landscape

### Census Bureau Independence Proposals

**Bills Introduced (Recent Congresses)**

| Bill | Provisions | Status |
|------|------------|--------|
| Census Bureau Independence Act | Fixed term for Director, removal protections | Not passed |
| Census IDEA Act | Scientific integrity protections | Not passed |
| Fair and Accurate Census Act | Enumeration timeline protections | Not passed |

### House Expansion Proposals

**Recent Bills**

| Proposal | New Size | Rationale |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Wyoming Rule | ~545-570 | Smallest state sets ratio |
| Cube Root Rule | ~690 | Mathematical model |
| Fifty Thousand | 6,600+ | Constitutional minimum |
| Fixed increase | 500-600 | Modest expansion |

**State-Level Impact of Wyoming Rule**

If the smallest state (Wyoming) sets the ratio, every state would have one representative per ~577,000 people.

| State | Current Seats | Wyoming Rule |
|-------|---------------|--------------|
| California | 52 | 68 |
| Texas | 38 | 50 |
| Florida | 28 | 37 |
| New York | 26 | 33 |
| Delaware | 1 | 2 |

### Prison-Based Gerrymandering Reform

**States That Have Reformed**

| State | Year | Reform |
|-------|------|--------|
| Maryland | 2010 | Count at last known address |
| New York | 2010 | Count at home address |
| California | 2011 | Count at last known address |
| Delaware | 2010 | Count at home address |
| Colorado | 2020 | Count at home address |
| Nevada | 2019 | Count at home address |
| New Jersey | 2020 | Count at home address |
| Washington | 2019 | Count at home address |
| Virginia | 2020 | Count at home address |
| Connecticut | 2022 | Count at home address |

**Federal Status**

No federal requirement to count prisoners at home address. Census Bureau counts at facility; states must reallocate for redistricting.

### Differential Privacy Debate

**2020 Implementation**

The Census Bureau implemented "differential privacy" for the first time, adding statistical noise to protect individual responses.

**Concerns Raised**

| Stakeholder | Concern |
|-------------|---------|
| States | Small-area data less accurate for redistricting |
| Researchers | Historical comparisons complicated |
| Local governments | Planning data quality reduced |
| Privacy advocates | Necessary to prevent reconstruction |

**Current Status**

- 2020 data released with differential privacy
- Ongoing debate about privacy-accuracy tradeoff
- Bureau committed to refinement for 2030

## Impact Analysis

### On Representation

**Undercount Effects**

Communities that are undercounted experience:

- Fewer representatives at all levels
- Less political power in redistricting
- Reduced Electoral College influence
- Diminished voice in democracy

**House Size Effects**

With a fixed 435 seats:

- Representatives serve larger constituencies
- Campaigns cost more
- Personal constituent service harder
- Electoral College increasingly distorted

### On Funding

**Programs Affected by Census Data**

| Program | Annual Allocation |
|---------|------------------|
| Medicaid | $400+ billion |
| SNAP | $80+ billion |
| Highway Planning | $40+ billion |
| Section 8 Housing | $25+ billion |
| Title I Education | $15+ billion |
| Head Start | $10+ billion |
| CHIP | $15+ billion |

**Undercount Cost**

An undercount of 1% in a state's population could mean:

- Tens of millions in lost federal funding annually
- Hundreds of millions over the decade
- Compounding effects on infrastructure and services

### On Planning

**Data Quality Impact**

Census data informs:

- School construction and closure decisions
- Hospital and healthcare facility planning
- Transportation infrastructure
- Emergency response resource allocation
- Business investment decisions

**Accuracy Concerns**

- Differential privacy adds uncertainty
- Small-area estimates less reliable
- Historical trend analysis complicated
- Planning decisions may be suboptimal

## Recent Developments

### Legal Challenges

**2020 Census Litigation**

| Case | Issue | Outcome |
|------|-------|---------|
| *Department of Commerce v. New York* | Citizenship question | Question blocked |
| *Trump v. New York* | Undocumented exclusion | Dismissed as not ripe |
| Various state cases | Timeline changes | Mixed results |
| Alabama challenge | Apportionment method | Ongoing |

### Administrative Actions

**Biden Administration**

- Reversed undocumented exclusion policy
- Committed to Census Bureau independence
- Began 2030 planning
- Addressed some staffing concerns

**2030 Planning**

| Milestone | Target Date |
|-----------|-------------|
| Research and testing | 2022-2028 |
| Dress rehearsal | 2028 |
| Census Day | April 1, 2030 |
| Apportionment counts | December 2030 |
| Redistricting data | March 2031 |

### State Actions

**Complete Count Committees**

Many states have established Complete Count Committees to improve enumeration:

| State | Investment | Focus |
|-------|------------|-------|
| California | $187 million | Hard-to-count communities |
| Texas | $5 million | Rural and immigrant communities |
| New York | $60 million | Urban undercount |
| Florida | Limited state investment | Local efforts |

## Key Takeaways

1. **2020 census faced unprecedented challenges**: Pandemic, political interference, and compressed timelines created accuracy concerns

2. **Differential undercount persists**: Minorities, children, and renters systematically undercounted while white homeowners overcounted

3. **Census Bureau lacks independence**: No statutory protections against political interference demonstrated in 2020

4. **House remains frozen**: 435 seats for 331 million people creates significant representation disparities

5. **Prison-based gerrymandering continues**: Most states still count prisoners at prison, not home

6. **2030 preparation critical**: Adequate funding and planning must begin years in advance

7. **Differential privacy tradeoffs**: Privacy protection comes at cost of small-area accuracy

8. **Funding allocation at stake**: $1.5+ trillion annually distributed based on census data
