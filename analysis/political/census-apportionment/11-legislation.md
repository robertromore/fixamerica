# Census and Apportionment: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Census and apportionment reform requires legislation at both federal and state levels. This document provides model legislation for Census Bureau independence, House expansion, prison-based gerrymandering reform, and census accuracy improvements, along with analysis of loopholes and implementation considerations.

## Federal Legislation

### Census Bureau Independence Act

**Purpose**: Protect the Census Bureau from political interference by establishing structural independence similar to other statistical agencies.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Census Bureau Independence Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The decennial census is foundational to American democracy,
    determining congressional apportionment, redistricting, and
    the allocation of over $1.5 trillion in federal funds annually.
(2) The Census Bureau's placement within the Department of Commerce
    leaves it vulnerable to political interference.
(3) Events surrounding the 2020 census demonstrated the risks of
    political pressure on census operations and methodology.
(4) Other federal statistical agencies benefit from statutory
    protections that the Census Bureau lacks.
(5) Census data integrity requires professional independence from
    political influence.

SEC. 3. DIRECTOR OF THE CENSUS.

(a) APPOINTMENT.—Section 21 of title 13, United States Code, is
    amended to read as follows:

    "(a) APPOINTMENT.—The Bureau of the Census shall be headed by

        testing, operations, and post-census evaluation.

(b) MINIMUM FUNDING.—
    (1) Appropriations for the decennial census shall not be less
        than the inflation-adjusted cost of the previous decennial
        census, unless the Director certifies that reduced funding
        will not compromise data quality.
    (2) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, funds
        appropriated for the decennial census shall remain

### Fair Apportionment Act (House Expansion)

**Purpose**: Expand the House of Representatives to improve representation and reduce Electoral College distortions using the Wyoming Rule.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Fair Apportionment Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The House of Representatives has been fixed at 435 members
    since 1929, when the U.S. population was 123 million.
(2) The U.S. population has grown to over 330 million, meaning
    each representative now serves over 760,000 constituents.
(3) This ratio is 25 times the Founders' intended representation
    and among the highest in any developed democracy.
(4) The fixed House size creates significant disparities in
    representation between states.
(5) A larger House would provide more accessible representatives,
    reduce campaign costs, and diminish Electoral College
    distortions.

SEC. 3. HOUSE SIZE DETERMINATION.

(a) REPEAL.—Section 22 of the Act of June 18, 1929 (2 U.S.C. 2a),
    is amended by striking "a House of Representatives composed of
    four hundred and thirty-five Members" and inserting "a House
    of Representatives composed of Members as provided in
    subsection (d)".

(b) WYOMING RULE.—
    (1) Following each decennial census, the number of
        Representatives shall be determined by dividing the total
        apportionment population of the United States by the
        population of the least populous State, rounded to the
        nearest whole number.
    (2) The total number of Representatives shall not be less
        than 435.

(c) ALTERNATIVE CALCULATION.—If application of subsection (b)
    would result in fewer than 435 Representatives, the House
    shall consist of 435 Members.

(d) APPORTIONMENT.—Representatives shall be apportioned among
    the States using the method of equal proportions (Huntington-
    Hill method) as currently provided by law.

SEC. 4. IMPLEMENTATION.

(a) FIRST APPLICATION.—This Act shall first apply to the
    apportionment of Representatives following the 2030 decennial
    census.

(b) CHAMBER ACCOMMODATIONS.—The Architect of the Capitol shall,
    not later than January 1, 2032, make such modifications to
    the House Chamber and related facilities as necessary to
    accommodate the expanded membership.

(c) MEMBER RESOURCES.—The Committee on House Administration shall
    adjust member allowances, office space allocations, and staff
    authorizations as necessary for the expanded membership.

SEC. 5. REDISTRICTING TRANSITION.

(a) TIMING.—States shall complete redistricting for the expanded
    House not later than [date], to be effective for the general
    election in November 2032.

(b) STANDARDS.—Redistricting under this section shall comply with
    all applicable provisions of the Voting Rights Act and other
    federal law.

SEC. 6. STUDY.

(a) GAO STUDY.—The Comptroller General shall conduct a study of
    the effects of House expansion on—
    (1) representation quality and constituent access;
    (2) campaign costs and competitiveness;
    (3) Electoral College outcomes;
    (4) legislative efficiency; and
    (5) redistricting and gerrymandering.

(b) REPORT.—Not later than December 31, 2034, the Comptroller
    General shall submit a report to Congress on the findings
    of the study.
```

**Explanation**:

- **Section 3(b)**: Wyoming Rule uses smallest state's population as divisor
- **Section 3(c)**: Floor of 435 prevents any reduction
- **Section 4**: 2030 implementation allows planning time
- **Section 5**: Clear redistricting timeline

**Projected Impact**:

| Scenario | 2020 Population | House Size | Avg District |
|----------|-----------------|------------|--------------|
| Current | 331 million | 435 | 761,000 |
| Wyoming Rule | 331 million | ~573 | ~578,000 |

Elimination Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The Census Bureau currently counts incarcerated persons at
    their place of incarceration rather than their home address.
(2) This practice inflates the population of communities with
    prisons while reducing the counted population of communities
    from which prisoners come.
(3) In most States, incarcerated persons cannot vote, meaning
    prison populations create representation without participation.
(4) Prison-based gerrymandering disproportionately affects
    minority communities, which are overrepresented in the
    incarcerated population.
(5) At least 12 States have enacted reforms to address this issue.

SEC. 3. RESIDENCE FOR CENSUS PURPOSES.

    (4) a juvenile detention facility.

(c) DATA COLLECTION.—
    (1) Federal, State, and local correctional authorities shall
        provide the Census Bureau with the pre-incarceration
        address of each incarcerated person.
    (2) The Bureau of Justice Statistics shall coordinate
        collection of address information.

SEC. 4. APPORTIONMENT AND REDISTRICTING DATA.

(a) APPORTIONMENT.—Apportionment population counts shall reflect
    incarcerated persons at their pre-incarceration addresses.

(b) REDISTRICTING DATA.—Redistricting data provided to States
    shall reflect incarcerated persons at their pre-incarceration
    addresses.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Census Bureau Independence Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Removal for "cause" interpretation | Courts may defer to presidential judgment on what constitutes cause | High |
| Budget still subject to appropriations | Lifecycle funding not truly mandatory | High |
| Commerce Department remains supervisor | Political appointees still above Director | Medium |
| Scientific Advisory Committee advisory only | Recommendations not binding | Medium |
| Timeline flexibility for "emergency" | Could be exploited | Medium |

| Still within executive branch | Ultimate presidential control | Constitutional structure |
| No automatic funding | Appropriations politics continues | Budget process |
| Political appointees above | Indirect influence possible | Departmental structure |
| Methodology discretion | Director could still make political choices | Need professional judgment |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Strengthen removal protection**: Specify removal only by joint resolution of Congress, or require Senate concurrence for removal
2. **Mandatory funding floor**: Tie census funding to automatic formula, like Social Security
3. **Create independent agency**: Remove from Commerce entirely (requires larger structural change)
4. **Binding advisory committee**: Require Director to explain any deviation from committee recommendations
5. **Inspector General independence**: Ensure IG reports directly to Congress, not Commerce

### Fair Apportionment Act (House Expansion)

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Wyoming Rule denominator manipulation | If smallest state population measured differently | Low |
| Implementation delay | Architect of Capitol could delay accommodations | Medium |
| Redistricting deadline ambiguity | States could delay implementation | Medium |
| No enforcement mechanism | What if states don't comply with timeline? | Medium |
| Floor of 435 could become ceiling | Future Congresses could re-freeze | Low |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Senate unchanged | Malapportionment continues in upper chamber | Constitutional structure |
| Electoral College only partially fixed | Small state advantage reduced but not eliminated | Constitutional structure |
| Cube root rule not adopted | Wyoming Rule less mathematically principled | Political feasibility |
| No automatic adjustment | Still requires congressional action | Legislative process |
| Chamber/logistics challenges | Real implementation hurdles | Physical constraints |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Automatic adjustment**: Include provision for automatic recalculation each census without new legislation
2. **Court enforcement**: Authorize judicial enforcement of redistricting deadlines
3. **Alternative rule option**: Allow future Congresses to adopt cube root rule without new legislation
4. **Phase-in provision**: Gradual expansion over two censuses if sudden increase problematic
5. **Virtual participation**: Authorize remote voting/participation to reduce physical chamber constraints

| Juvenile facilities definition | May not capture all facilities | Low |
| Implementation timeline | 2028 regulations may be too late | Medium |
| Federal-only prisoners | May not coordinate with state data | Low |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Only redistricting, not apportionment | May face constitutional challenge for apportionment | Legal uncertainty |
| Depends on state cooperation | Data collection requires state action | Federalism |
| Homeless prisoners | No pre-incarceration address available | Population reality |
| Frequent movers | Last address may not be current community | Mobile population |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Address verification**: Require address validation through postal service or voter registration records
2. **Interstate compact**: Create mechanism for state data sharing on transfers
3. **Comprehensive facility definition**: Include all detention facilities explicitly
4. **Earlier regulations**: Require regulations by 2026 for adequate testing
5. **Default allocation**: Establish default rules for unknown addresses (state capital, population-weighted distribution)

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| Inter-branch conflict | Build broad bipartisan coalitions before enactment |
| State resistance | Condition federal funding on compliance |
| Technology failures | Require backup procedures and testing |
| Public distrust | Sustained public education campaigns |
| Coordination failures | Clear lines of authority and accountability |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

All provisions should include:

- **Decennial review**: Mandatory evaluation after each census
- **GAO assessment**: Independent review of implementation
- **Amendment procedures**: Clear process for technical corrections
- **Automatic extension**: Continuation unless affirmatively repealed
- **Public reporting**: Transparency on implementation status
