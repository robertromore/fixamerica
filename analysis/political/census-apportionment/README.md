# Census and Apportionment: Overview

The decennial census is the foundation of American democracy. Required by Article I, Section 2 of the Constitution, it determines how political power is distributed across the nation. The census count allocates 435 House seats among the states, guides the drawing of congressional and legislative districts, and distributes over $1.5 trillion annually in federal funding. Yet this fundamental democratic institution faces persistent challenges: political interference, chronic undercounting of marginalized populations, debates over who counts and where, and questions about whether the current House size adequately represents a nation of 330+ million people.
