# Census and Apportionment: Solutions

## Overview

Reforming the census and apportionment system requires addressing multiple interconnected problems: political interference, chronic undercounting, outdated apportionment, and inadequate House representation. This section presents solutions ranging from incremental improvements to structural reforms.

## Census Bureau Independence

### The Problem

The Census Bureau is housed within the Commerce Department with no statutory protections for its director or professional staff. The 2020 census demonstrated how political appointees can pressure career statisticians and alter operations for partisan purposes.

### Solution: Census Bureau Independence Act

**Core Elements**

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Director term | 10-year term, removal only for cause |
| Professional standards | Statutory protection for methodology decisions |
| Budget protection | Minimum funding formula or dedicated funding |
| Timeline protection | Statutory enumeration schedule |

**Benefits**

- Insulates Bureau from political pressure
- Protects professional staff decisions
- Ensures consistent methodology across administrations
- Builds public trust in census data

**Implementation**

| Phase | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Legislative | Pass Census Bureau Independence Act |
| Regulatory | Issue new operating procedures |
| Institutional | Strengthen internal governance |

### Alternative Approaches

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| Full independence | Maximum protection | Harder to pass |
| Enhanced protections | More achievable | Less comprehensive |
| Scientific integrity rules | Executive action possible | Can be reversed |
| Inspector General expansion | Accountability | Reactive not preventive |

## House Expansion

### The Problem

The House has been frozen at 435 seats since 1929, even as the U.S. population has grown from 123 million to 331 million. The average congressional district now contains over 760,000 people—25 times the Founders' intended ratio. This creates:

- Less accessible representatives
- More expensive campaigns
- Larger Electoral College distortions
- Unfair disparities between states

### Solution Options

**Wyoming Rule**

Smallest state sets the ratio: every state gets one representative per ~577,000 people.

| Metric | Current | Wyoming Rule |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| House size | 435 | ~545-570 |
| Average district | 761,000 | ~577,000 |
| Largest state gain | - | CA (+16) |
| EC improvement | Baseline | Moderate |

**Cube Root Rule**

House size equals cube root of population (common in democracies).

| Metric | Current | Cube Root |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| House size | 435 | ~690 |
| Average district | 761,000 | ~480,000 |
| Ratio improvement | Baseline | Significant |
| EC improvement | Baseline | Substantial |

**Modest Expansion**

Increase to round number (500, 550) with automatic adjustment.

| Metric | 500 Seats | 550 Seats |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Average district | 663,000 | 602,000 |
| Feasibility | Higher | Medium |
| Reform scope | Limited | Moderate |

### Implementation Considerations

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| Physical chamber | Renovation or procedural adaptation needed |
| Committee structure | May need restructuring |
| Member resources | Staff, office space, budget |
| First application | 2032 apportionment (after 2030 census) |

### Benefits of Expansion

| Benefit | Explanation |
|---------|-------------|
| Closer representation | More accessible members |
| Reduced campaign costs | Smaller districts, less expensive |
| Electoral College reform | Less small-state distortion |
| Better apportionment | Less rounding error |
| Redistricting improvement | More districts, harder to gerrymander |

## Prison-Based Gerrymandering

### The Problem

The Census Bureau counts prisoners at their place of incarceration rather than their home address. Since prisoners generally cannot vote, this creates "phantom constituents" that inflate the political power of communities with prisons while diluting representation for communities prisoners come from.

### Solution: Count Prisoners at Home Address

**Federal Approach**

| Option | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Census Bureau policy change | Administrative action |
| Federal legislation | Require home-address counting |
| Redistricting data adjustment | Provide both datasets |

**State Approaches (Already Implemented)**

| State | Year | Method |
|-------|------|--------|
| Maryland | 2010 | Reallocate in redistricting data |
| New York | 2010 | Count at last known address |
| California | 2011 | Reallocate for redistricting |
| Colorado | 2020 | Count at home address |
| Washington | 2019 | Count at home address |

**Implementation**

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Home address unknown | Use last known address from correctional records |
| Out-of-state prisoners | Return to home state's count |
| Timing | Implement before redistricting data release |

### Benefits

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Fair representation | Communities represented by residents who can vote |
| Accurate data | Prisoners return home upon release |
| Equal protection | Equal weight to all residents' representation |

## Census Accuracy Improvements

### Addressing Undercount

**Enhanced Outreach**

| Strategy | Target Population |
|----------|-------------------|
| Community partnerships | Hard-to-count communities |
| Language access | Non-English speakers |
| Trusted messengers | Immigrant communities |
| Physical accessibility | Disabled, elderly |

**Methodology Improvements**

| Improvement | Benefit |
|-------------|---------|
| Administrative records | Fill gaps in self-response |
| Coverage improvement | Statistical adjustment for known undercount |
| Quality metrics | Better accuracy measurement |
| Post-enumeration surveys | Verify count accuracy |

### Funding Solutions

**Adequate Appropriations**

| Approach | Mechanism |
|----------|-----------|
| Lifecycle funding | 10-year budget commitment |
| Mandatory spending | Remove from annual discretion |
| Trust fund | Dedicated revenue source |
| Formula minimum | Floor based on prior census costs |

**Investment Priorities**

| Priority | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Early planning | Avoid 2020 compressed timeline |
| Technology development | Modern infrastructure |
| Testing | Full dress rehearsal |
| Advertising | Reach hard-to-count |
| Field operations | Adequate staffing |

### Complete Count Initiatives

**Federal Support for State Efforts**

| Support Type | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|
| Matching grants | Incentivize state investment |
| Technical assistance | Best practices sharing |
| Data sharing | Administrative records access |
| Partnership program | Formal collaboration |

## Apportionment Method Reform

### Current Method Issues

The Huntington-Hill method has a slight bias favoring smaller states. Alternative methods could produce different, arguably fairer, results.

### Alternative Methods

| Method | Description | Bias |
|--------|-------------|------|
| Webster | Rounding at arithmetic mean | Neutral |
| Dean | Rounding at harmonic mean | Slight small-state |
| Jefferson | Greatest divisors | Large state |
| Hamilton | Largest remainders | Small state |

### Why Method Matters

**2020 Apportionment Under Different Methods**

| State | Huntington-Hill | Webster | Jefferson |
|-------|-----------------|---------|-----------|
| Rhode Island | 2 | 2 | 1 |
| Montana | 2 | 2 | 2 |
| New York | 26 | 26 | 27 |

**Reform Proposal**: Switch to Webster method for neutrality, or any method with clear rationale and regular review.

## American Community Survey Improvements

### Current Challenges

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Response rate decline | Data quality concerns |
| Respondent burden | Survey fatigue |
| Small-area accuracy | Wide confidence intervals |
| Timeliness | Annual data insufficient for some uses |

### Solutions

| Solution | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| Increased sample size | Better precision |
| Administrative records integration | Reduced burden |
| Improved outreach | Higher response rates |
| Enhanced weighting | Better estimates |

## Differential Privacy Balance

### The Challenge

Differential privacy protects individual confidentiality but reduces small-area data accuracy. The tradeoff must balance:

| Consideration | Weight |
|---------------|--------|
| Legal confidentiality requirement | Mandatory |
| Redistricting data accuracy | Constitutional importance |
| Research utility | Significant |
| Long-term privacy protection | Growing importance |

### Solutions

| Approach | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Refined algorithms | Improve accuracy within privacy constraints |
| Tiered disclosure | Different privacy levels for different data |
| Synthetic data | Alternative products for some uses |
| Transparency | Clear documentation of methods and impacts |

## Military and Federal Employee Counting

### Current Practice

Overseas military and federal employees are allocated to their home state for apportionment but not enumerated locally. This creates:

- Administrative allocation rather than actual count
- Potential inaccuracies in home state designation
- Questions about dependents

### Solutions

| Solution | Benefit |
|----------|---------|
| Improved home-state records | More accurate allocation |
| Clear rules for dependents | Consistency |
| Coordination with DOD/State | Better data sharing |

## Comprehensive Reform Package

### Integrated Approach

| Component | Timeline | Vehicle |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| Bureau independence | Near-term | Legislation |
| Funding stability | Near-term | Appropriations |
| Prison counting | Near-term | Legislation or policy |
| House expansion | Medium-term | Legislation |
| Apportionment method | Medium-term | Legislation |
| Constitutional changes | Long-term | Amendment |
