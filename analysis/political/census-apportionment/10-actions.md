# Census and Apportionment: Actions

## Overview

Census and apportionment reform requires action across multiple levels—from individual citizens to national advocacy. Unlike issues where individual action is limited, census participation is something every resident can directly contribute to. This section outlines concrete actions for different audiences.

## For Individual Citizens

### Participate in the Census

**2030 Census Preparation**

| Action | Timing | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Update address with USPS | Ongoing | Ensure you receive forms |
| Know residence rules | Before Census Day | Be counted in right place |
| Prepare household list | Before Census Day | Accurate count |
| Respond promptly | Census period (2030) | Reduce follow-up costs |
| Respond completely | Census period | Full data collection |

**Help Others Participate**

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| Explain census importance | Share information with family, friends |
| Assist non-English speakers | Help navigate forms |
| Support elderly and disabled | Assist with response |
| Counter misinformation | Correct false claims |

### Civic Engagement

**Contact Elected Officials**

| Official | Ask For |
|----------|---------|
| U.S. Senators | Census Bureau Independence Act support |
| U.S. Representative | House expansion support, adequate funding |
| State legislators | Prison counting reform, state census investment |
| Local officials | Complete Count Committee participation |

**Sample Messages**

For Census Bureau Independence:

> "I urge you to support the Census Bureau Independence Act to protect the integrity of our census from political interference. The 2020 census showed how vulnerable the Bureau is to manipulation. Professional statisticians, not politicians, should determine census methodology."

For House Expansion:

> "Please support expanding the House of Representatives. With 435 members representing 330 million people, each representative serves over 760,000 constituents—far too many for effective representation. The Wyoming Rule or Cube Root Rule would create a more representative House."
