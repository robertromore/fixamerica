# Census and Apportionment: History

## Origins

### Constitutional Foundation (1787)

The census was one of the most contentious issues at the Constitutional Convention. The Founders needed a mechanism to allocate both representation and taxation among states with vastly different populations and conflicting interests.

**The Great Compromise**

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| Large vs. small states | Bicameral legislature: House by population, Senate by state |
| Slave states vs. free states | Three-Fifths Compromise for enumeration |
| Counting method | Actual enumeration (counting), not estimation |
| Frequency | Every ten years |

**Article I, Section 2**

> "Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons."

**What This Meant**

- Enslaved people counted as 3/5 of a person for representation
- Native Americans "not taxed" excluded entirely
- Indentured servants ("bound to Service") counted fully
- Federal government must conduct actual count, not estimate

### The Three-Fifths Compromise

**The Political Calculation**

Southern states wanted enslaved people counted fully for representation (more House seats) but not for taxation. Northern states wanted the opposite. The 3/5 ratio was a political compromise with no principled basis.

**Impact on Representation**

| Year | Slave State Bonus Seats | Effect |
|------|------------------------|--------|
| 1790 | 14 extra seats | South overrepresented |
| 1800 | 18 extra seats | Influenced presidential elections |
| 1820 | 21 extra seats | Entrenched slave power |
| 1850 | 25 extra seats | Delayed abolition |

**Electoral Consequences**

The Three-Fifths Compromise directly affected:

- Election of Thomas Jefferson in 1800 (would have lost without slave-state bonus)
- Passage of fugitive slave laws
- Missouri Compromise negotiations
- Overall balance of power favoring slavery until Civil War

### First Census (1790)

**Operations**

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Authority | U.S. Marshals in each judicial district |
| Questions | Name of head of household, counts by category |
| Categories | Free white males (16+/under 16), free white females, other free persons, slaves |
| Cost | $44,377 |
| Duration | 18 months |
| Total count | 3,929,214 |

**State Results**

| State | Population | % of Total |
|-------|------------|------------|
| Virginia | 747,610 | 19% |
| Pennsylvania | 434,373 | 11% |
| North Carolina | 393,751 | 10% |
| Massachusetts | 378,787 | 10% |
| New York | 340,120 | 9% |

**Accuracy Concerns**

- George Washington believed count too low
- Remote areas underenumerated
- Enslaved people likely undercounted
- No systematic quality control

## Evolution of Enumeration

### 19th Century Expansion

**Growing Complexity**

| Census | Questions Added | Innovation |
|--------|-----------------|------------|
| 1800 | Age categories expanded | More detailed demographics |
| 1810 | Economic questions | Manufacturing data |
| 1820 | Occupation, foreign birth | Immigration tracking |
| 1830 | Standardized schedules | Uniform forms |
| 1840 | Literacy, disabilities | Social characteristics |
| 1850 | Individual enumeration | Named all free persons |
| 1870 | All persons counted equally | Post-Civil War |
| 1880 | Relationship to household head | Family structure |
| 1890 | Mechanical tabulation | Hollerith machines |

**The Census Office**

| Year | Status |
|------|--------|
| 1790-1840 | Conducted by U.S. Marshals |
| 1850 | Census Board created |
| 1880 | Superintendent of Census position |
| 1902 | Permanent Census Bureau established |
| 1903 | Moved to Commerce Department |

### Post-Civil War Transformation

**14th Amendment (1868)**

Changed apportionment basis:
> "Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States according to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed."

**Key Changes**

- Three-Fifths Compromise eliminated
- All persons counted equally
- Native Americans "not taxed" still excluded
- Penalty clause for disenfranchisement (never enforced)

**15th Amendment (1870)**

Protected voting rights regardless of "race, color, or previous condition of servitude" but did not change census counting.

### Census Controversies of the Gilded Age

**1870 Census**

| Issue | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Southern undercount | Former slaves potentially missed |
| Urban undercount | Growing cities not adequately enumerated |
| Corruption | Some enumerators falsified data |

**1880 Census**

- First professional census superintendent (Francis Walker)
- Introduced sampling techniques
- Still relied on political appointees for enumeration

**1890 Census**

- First use of mechanical tabulation (Hollerith machines)
- Punch cards for data processing
- Faster results but new accuracy concerns
- Original records destroyed in 1921 fire

## 20th Century Developments

### Professionalization (1902-1930)

**Census Bureau Established (1902)**

| Change | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Permanent agency | Continuity between censuses |
| Professional staff | Statistical expertise |
| Ongoing data collection | More than decennial counts |
| Research capability | Method improvement |

**Apportionment Crises**

| Census | Crisis |
|--------|--------|
| 1920 | Congress failed to reapportion (rural-urban conflict) |
| 1921 | No apportionment act passed |
| 1929 | Automatic reapportionment law (House frozen at 435) |

**The 1929 Act**

Congress passed the Permanent Apportionment Act:

- Fixed House at 435 seats
- Made reapportionment automatic
- President transmits numbers to Congress
- No further action required

### The House Freeze

**Why 435?**

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| 1910 baseline | House size after that census |
| Chamber capacity | Physical size of House floor |
| Political stalemate | Rural vs. urban conflict |
| Inertia | No compelling reason to change |

**Consequences**

- As population grows, districts grow larger
- Representation becomes less personal
- Electoral College becomes more distorted
- Small state advantage increases

### Statistical Innovation (1940-1960)

**Sampling Introduction**

| Innovation | Year | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|
| Sample surveys | 1940 | Collect more data efficiently |
| Long form/short form | 1940 | Detailed data on sample |
| Quality checks | 1950 | Post-enumeration surveys |
| Computer processing | 1960 | Faster tabulation |

**Coverage Improvement**

| Census | Estimated Undercount |
|--------|---------------------|
| 1940 | ~5% overall |
| 1950 | ~4% overall |
| 1960 | ~3% overall |
| 1970 | ~2.7% overall |

### Civil Rights Era Impact

**1970 Census**

First census after Voting Rights Act (1965):

- Increased focus on minority enumeration
- Community outreach programs
- Spanish-language forms
- Urban undercount scrutinized

**Litigation Era Begins**

| Case | Year | Issue | Outcome |
|------|------|-------|---------|
| *NAACP v. Klutznick* | 1970s | Undercount adjustment | Not required |
| *Young v. Klutznick* | 1980 | Undercount challenge | Court deferred to Bureau |
| *City of Detroit v. Franklin* | 1988 | Undercount adjustment | Bureau discretion |

### 1990 Census: Watershed Moment

**The Undercount Problem**

| Population | Undercount Rate |
|------------|-----------------|
| Black | 4.4% |
| Hispanic | 5.0% |
| White | 0.7% |
| Native American | 12.2% |

**Statistical Adjustment Debate**

- Cities and minority groups demanded statistical adjustment
- Commerce Secretary blocked adjustment
- Supreme Court eventually upheld unadjusted count
- Controversy shaped future census debates

### 2000 Census

**Innovations**

| Change | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| GPS for address canvassing | Improved geographic accuracy |
| Multiple race categories | First time respondents could select multiple races |
| Paid advertising campaign | Hard-to-count outreach |
| Partnership program | Community engagement |

**Results**

- Undercount reduced but not eliminated
- Differential undercount persisted
- Adjustment again considered and rejected

### American Community Survey (2005)

**Replacing the Long Form**

The ACS replaced the census long form with ongoing data collection:

| Feature | Census Long Form | ACS |
|---------|-----------------|-----|
| Frequency | Every 10 years | Continuous |
| Sample size | 1 in 6 households | ~3.5 million/year |
| Data availability | Decennial | 1-year and 5-year |
| Response requirement | Mandatory | Mandatory |

**Benefits**

- More current data
- Smaller burden per year
- Better small-area estimates over time
- More frequent updates for programs

### 2010 Census

**Budget and Politics**

| Issue | Impact |
|-------|--------|
| Great Recession | Budget constraints |
| Technology delays | Handheld device plans scrapped |
| Response rate decline | More expensive follow-up |
| Differential undercount | Persisted |

**Results**

- Net undercount: 0.01% (very small)
- Differential undercount: Persisted for minorities
- Cost: $12.3 billion (most expensive to date)

## The 2020 Census

### Preparation Challenges

**Funding Shortfalls**

| Year | Appropriation | Needed |
|------|---------------|--------|
| FY 2017 | $1.47 billion | $1.8 billion |
| FY 2018 | $2.8 billion | Catch-up |
| FY 2019 | $3.6 billion | Operations |

**Technology Overhaul**

- First primarily internet-based census
- New IT infrastructure required
- Cybersecurity concerns
- Mobile-friendly response

### The Citizenship Question Controversy

**Timeline**

| Date | Event |
|------|-------|
| March 2018 | Commerce Secretary Ross announces citizenship question |
| April 2018 | Lawsuits filed |
| January 2019 | District court blocks question |
| June 2019 | Supreme Court decision (*Department of Commerce v. New York*) |
| June 2019 | Question excluded |

**Key Findings**

- Commerce Secretary's stated rationale (VRA enforcement) was pretextual
- Real motivation: reduce response in immigrant communities
- Question would have caused significant undercount
- Census Bureau professionals opposed addition

### COVID-19 Impact

**Operational Changes**

| Original Plan | COVID Adaptation |
|---------------|------------------|
| April 1 Census Day | Unchanged |
| April-July field operations | Delayed to August |
| October 31 deadline | Requested December 31 |
| In-person enumeration | Limited, safety protocols |

**Response Rate Impact**

| Method | Self-Response Rate |
|--------|-------------------|
| Internet | 44.5% |
| Paper | 20.7% |
| Phone | 1.8% |
| Total self-response | 67% |

### Political Interference

**Trump Administration Actions**

| Action | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Citizenship question attempt | Blocked by courts |
| Exclusion memo | Sought to remove undocumented from apportionment |
| Shortened deadline | Compressed operations |
| Rushed data delivery | Quality concerns |

**Census Bureau Response**

- Career staff resisted some interference
- Professional integrity tested
- Whistleblower concerns raised
- Long-term trust implications

### Apportionment Results

**Delivered**: April 26, 2021 (delayed from December 31, 2020)

**Changes from 2010**

| Gaining | Seats | Losing | Seats |
|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| Texas | +2 | California | -1 |
| Colorado | +1 | Illinois | -1 |
| Florida | +1 | Michigan | -1 |
| Montana | +1 | New York | -1 |
| North Carolina | +1 | Ohio | -1 |
| Oregon | +1 | Pennsylvania | -1 |
| - | - | West Virginia | -1 |

**Razor-Thin Margins**

- New York lost seat by 89 people
- Minnesota kept seat by 26 people
- Demonstrates stakes of accurate counting

## Historical Lessons

### What History Teaches

1. **The census has always been political**: From Three-Fifths Compromise to citizenship question

2. **Accuracy improves but disparities persist**: Technology helps, but differential undercount continues

3. **House freeze has consequences**: 1929 decision increasingly outdated

4. **Professional independence matters**: Political interference degrades quality

5. **Community engagement essential**: Hard-to-count populations need targeted outreach

6. **Legal framework evolves**: Courts increasingly involved in census disputes

### Recurring Themes

| Theme | Historical Pattern |
|-------|-------------------|
| Counting controversy | Who counts has always been contested |
| Political interference | Pressure on enumeration is not new |
| Technological change | Each census adopts new methods |
| Representation stakes | Political power drives disputes |
| Accuracy vs. cost | Perpetual tradeoff |
