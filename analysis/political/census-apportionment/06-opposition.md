# Census and Apportionment: Opposition

## Overview

Reforms to census and apportionment face opposition from various stakeholders who benefit from current arrangements or have principled objections to proposed changes. Understanding opposition arguments—and their validity—is essential for effective advocacy.

## Opposition to Census Bureau Independence

### Arguments Against Independence

**Executive Authority**

| Argument | Proponents | Validity |
|----------|------------|----------|
| President must control executive agencies | Constitutional originalists | Partial—some agencies have independence |
| Accountability requires political control | Executive branch | Contested—professional agencies exist |
| Elections provide democratic check | Various | True but doesn't address interference |

**Practical Concerns**

| Argument | Proponents | Validity |
|----------|------------|----------|
| Independence creates unaccountable bureaucracy | Small government advocates | Partially valid—tradeoffs exist |
| Current structure works adequately | Status quo defenders | Questionable after 2020 |
| Change creates transition costs | Pragmatists | True but may be worthwhile |

### Who Opposes

| Group | Reason |
|-------|--------|
| Current administration (any) | Loses control |
| Commerce Department | Loses authority |
| Political operatives | Reduces manipulation options |
| Some Congress members | Prefer political leverage |

### Response to Opposition

| Argument | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Executive authority | Other statistical agencies have protections |
| Accountability | Professional standards provide accountability |
| Costs | 2020 demonstrated costs of political interference |

## Opposition to House Expansion

### Arguments Against Expansion

**Governance Concerns**

| Argument | Proponents | Validity |
|----------|------------|----------|
| Larger body harder to manage | Congressional leaders | Some validity—but manageable |
| Reduces individual member influence | Current members | True but not decisive |
| Physical chamber limitations | Practical concerns | Solvable |
| Increases costs | Fiscal conservatives | Modest in federal budget context |

**Representation Arguments**

| Argument | Proponents | Validity |
|----------|------------|----------|
| Current size works fine | Status quo defenders | Debatable—ratio very high |
| States should matter, not raw population | Federalists | Philosophical disagreement |
| Small states would be hurt | Small state representatives | Partially true |

### Who Opposes

| Group | Reason |
|-------|--------|
| Small states | Relative power dilution |
| Current House members | Individual power dilution |
| Senate | Fears shift of power to House |
| Some conservatives | Status quo preference |

### Political Analysis

**Small State Concern**

| State | Current Reps | % of House | With 690 Reps (Cube Root) |
|-------|--------------|------------|---------------------------|
| Wyoming | 1 | 0.23% | 1 (0.14%) |
| Vermont | 1 | 0.23% | 1 (0.14%) |
| California | 52 | 11.95% | 86 (12.46%) |

Small states lose proportionally but maintain constitutional minimum.

**Electoral College Impact**

| Scenario | Small State EV Premium |
|----------|------------------------|
| Current (435 House) | Significant |
| 545 House (Wyoming Rule) | Reduced |
| 690 House (Cube Root) | Further reduced |

### Response to Opposition

| Argument | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Governance difficulty | Many democracies manage larger legislatures |
| Chamber size | Can be renovated or proceedings adapted |
| Small state harm | Constitutional minimum preserves floor |
| Cost | Tiny fraction of federal budget |

## Opposition to Prison Counting Reform

### Arguments for Current Practice

**Census Bureau Position**

| Argument | Basis | Validity |
|----------|-------|----------|
| "Usual residence" is prison | Long-standing interpretation | Legally defensible, policy questionable |
| Administrative simplicity | Easier to implement | True but not dispositive |
| Consistent methodology | Applied uniformly | True |

**Political Arguments**

| Argument | Proponents | Validity |
|----------|------------|----------|
| Prisoners are there, should be counted there | Rural communities | Philosophically contested |
| Home address unknown or unreliable | Practical concerns | Often untrue—records exist |
| Would cost political power | Rural legislators | True but self-interested |

### Who Opposes Reform

| Group | Reason |
|-------|--------|
| Rural communities with prisons | Lose population count |
| Representatives of prison districts | Lose constituents |
| Republican Party (generally) | Most prisons in rural Republican areas |
| Prison industry | Alignment with host communities |

### The Core Problem

**Representation Without Participation**

- Prisoners cannot vote in most states
- Counted for representation they cannot exercise
- Communities represented without residents who can participate
- Creates phantom constituents

**Geographic Distortion**

| Example | Urban Loss | Rural Gain |
|---------|------------|------------|
| New York State | NYC loses population | Upstate gains |
| California | Urban areas lose | Rural areas gain |
| Illinois | Chicago loses | Downstate gains |

### Response to Opposition

| Argument | Response |
|----------|----------|
| They live there | Involuntary, temporary, cannot participate |
| Administrative burden | States have implemented successfully |
| Residence is prison | Most return to home community |

## Opposition to Citizenship Question

### Arguments for Citizenship Question

**Stated Rationale**

| Argument | Proponents | Validity |
|----------|------------|----------|
| VRA enforcement needs data | Trump administration | Pretextual—found by Supreme Court |
| Important demographic information | Some researchers | ACS already collects |
| Determine citizen voting population | Redistricting arguments | Not constitutional requirement |

**Underlying Political Goals**

| Goal | Mechanism | Outcome |
|------|-----------|---------|
| Depress immigrant response | Fear of disclosure | Undercount |
| Enable citizen-only redistricting | Data for CVAP | Benefit Republican areas |
| Discourage illegal immigration | Signal enforcement | Political messaging |

### Who Supported

| Group | Reason |
|-------|--------|
| Trump administration | Political advantage |
| Republican state AGs | Redistricting benefits |
| Some immigration restrictionists | Ideological |
| Heritage Foundation | Conservative policy |

### Legal Resolution

*Department of Commerce v. New York* (2019): Supreme Court blocked question because stated rationale was pretextual.

**Key Finding**: Commerce Secretary's VRA enforcement rationale was not the real reason; decision was arbitrary and capricious.

## Opposition to Statistical Adjustment

### Arguments Against Adjustment

**Constitutional Concerns**

| Argument | Proponents | Validity |
|----------|------------|----------|
| Constitution requires "actual enumeration" | Textualists | Debated—adjustment is post-enumeration |
| Sampling is not counting | Some legal scholars | *Utah v. Evans* upheld imputation (distinct from sampling); 13 U.S.C. § 195 prohibits sampling for apportionment |
| Political manipulation risk | Various | Legitimate concern |

**Practical Concerns**

| Argument | Proponents | Validity |
|----------|------------|----------|
| Adjustment methods imperfect | Statisticians | True—no method perfect |
| Could introduce new errors | Methodologists | Possible |
| Public trust in raw count | Census Bureau | Important consideration |

### Political Reality

| Party | Position | Reason |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Republicans | Generally oppose | Adjustment would benefit Democratic areas |
| Democrats | Generally support | Would address minority undercount |

### Census Bureau Position

Historically, Census Bureau has:

- Studied adjustment extensively
- Sometimes recommended adjustment
- Been overruled by Commerce Secretaries
- Implemented improved coverage estimation

### Response to Opposition

| Argument | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Not "actual enumeration" | Post-enumeration survey measures actual count accuracy |
| Manipulation risk | Scientific methods reduce discretion |
| Introduces errors | Net undercount errors are known; adjustment can reduce |

## Opposition to Adequate Census Funding

### Arguments for Limiting Funding

| Argument | Proponents | Validity |
|----------|------------|----------|
| Government should be efficient | Fiscal conservatives | Valid goal, but census needs resources |
| Technology should reduce costs | Budget hawks | Partially true—online helps |
| Can do more with less | Appropriators | Has limits |

**Political Motivation**

| Goal | Mechanism |
|------|-----------|
| Undercount certain populations | Inadequate outreach funding |
| Create problems for political opponents | If they advocate for undercounted |
| General government reduction | Ideological |

### Who Limits Funding

| Actor | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| Appropriations committees | Annual funding decisions |
| OMB | Budget proposals |
| Congressional leadership | Priorities |

### Consequences of Underfunding

| Period | Funding Level | Consequence |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| 2011-2016 | Below needed | 2020 preparation delayed |
| 2017-2018 | Catch-up mode | Testing compressed |
| 2020 | Pandemic complicated | Operations strained |

### Response to Opposition

| Argument | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Efficiency | Adequate investment reduces costly errors |
| Technology savings | Requires upfront investment |
| Do more with less | 2020 showed limits of this approach |

## Opposition to Differential Privacy Changes

### Arguments Against Current Implementation

**Data Quality Concerns**

| Argument | Proponents | Validity |
|----------|------------|----------|
| Small-area data less accurate | States, researchers | True—tradeoff inherent |
| Redistricting affected | State officials | Legitimate concern |
| Historical comparisons harder | Researchers | True |

**Transparency Concerns**

| Argument | Proponents | Validity |
|----------|------------|----------|
| Methods not fully understood | Data users | Partially valid—complexity real |
| Noise injection seems arbitrary | Critics | Methods are principled |
| Should use traditional methods | Some statisticians | Debated among experts |

### Who Raises Concerns

| Group | Concern |
|-------|---------|
| State redistricting officials | Data accuracy for small areas |
| Academic researchers | Methodological concerns |
| Alabama (lawsuit) | Challenged methodology |
| Some Census Bureau staff | Implementation questions |

### Census Bureau Position

| Position | Basis |
|----------|-------|
| Differential privacy necessary | Legal confidentiality requirements |
| Re-identification risk is real | Data reconstruction attacks demonstrated |
| Improvements ongoing | Learning from 2020 |
| Committed to accuracy within constraints | Professional standards |

### Balancing Privacy and Accuracy

| Consideration | Weight |
|---------------|--------|
| Constitutional confidentiality | Legal requirement |
| Accurate apportionment | Constitutional mandate |
| Small-area data utility | User needs |
| Long-term privacy protection | Future-proofing |
