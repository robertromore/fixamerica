# Federalism Reform: History

## Founding Era (1787-1800)

### Constitutional Design

The Constitution created a novel federal system:

- **Enumerated Powers**: Article I, Section 8 lists specific federal powers
- **Supremacy Clause**: Federal law supreme, but only within constitutional limits
- **Tenth Amendment**: Powers not delegated reserved to states or people
- **State Equality**: Equal representation in Senate, state role in amendments

### Federalist-Anti-Federalist Debate

| Federalists | Anti-Federalists |
|-------------|------------------|
| Strong national government necessary | States better protect liberty |
| Commerce requires uniform rules | Local knowledge essential |
| National defense needs central control | Standing armies threaten freedom |
| State jealousy caused problems under Articles | National government will absorb states |

### Early Interpretations

- **Hamilton**: Broad reading of "necessary and proper" clause
- **Jefferson**: Strict construction, states' rights emphasis
- **Marshall Court**: Established federal supremacy within constitutional bounds
- **McCulloch v. Maryland (1819)**: Implied powers, federal supremacy

## Nineteenth Century: Dual Federalism

### "Layer Cake" Model

The dominant 19th-century understanding:

- Federal and state governments operate in separate spheres
- Clear division of responsibilities
- Limited federal role in domestic policy
- States as primary regulators of commerce within borders

### Key Developments

**Commerce Clause Interpretation**:

- *Gibbons v. Ogden* (1824): Federal power over interstate commerce
- *Cooley v. Board of Wardens* (1852): Some local matters left to states
- Limited federal commerce legislation before Civil War

**Civil War and Reconstruction**:

- 13th, 14th, 15th Amendments: Federal power over civil rights
- Initial federal enforcement of civil rights
- Retreat after 1877: States regain control
- *Civil Rights Cases* (1883): Limited federal enforcement power

**Gilded Age**:

- Interstate Commerce Act (1887): First major federal regulation
- Sherman Antitrust Act (1890)
- Courts narrow federal regulatory power
- States remain primary economic regulators

## Progressive Era to New Deal (1900-1945)

### Progressive Reforms

Federal-state cooperation begins:

- Federal matching grants for roads (1916)

- 17th Amendment (1913): Direct election of senators, reduced state legislature role
- 18th Amendment (1919): Prohibition requires federal-state cooperation

- *Carter v. Carter Coal* (1936): Struck down coal regulation
- Court invalidated many New Deal programs

**Constitutional Revolution of 1937**:

- Social Security (1935): Federal-state partnership
- Unemployment insurance: Federal framework, state administration
- Agricultural regulation
- Banking and securities regulation

## Cooperative Federalism Era (1945-1980)

### Civil Rights and Preemption

- Civil Rights Act of 1964: Federal preemption of state discrimination
- Voting Rights Act of 1965: Federal oversight of state elections
- Courts upheld broad federal civil rights power
- States' rights arguments discredited by association with segregation

## New Federalism Era (1980-1995)

### Reagan Revolution

**Philosophy**:

- "Government is the problem"

- Reduce federal regulations
- Cut federal domestic spending

**Actions**:

**Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (1995)**:

- Weak enforcement mechanisms
- Did not significantly reduce mandates

## Supreme Court Federalism Revival (1990s-2000s)

### Rehnquist Court Revolution

Limits on federal power:

### Limits of Revolution

| Environment (1970s-80s) | Federal power | States' rights |

| COVID (2020s) | Federal power | States' rights |

### Persistent Tensions

- National standards vs. local adaptation
