# Federalism Reform: Legislation

## Overview

This document provides model legislation to strengthen federalism principles at the federal level, improve federal-state relations, and address key problems including preemption, unfunded mandates, and grant complexity. It also includes model state legislation on interstate compacts and local government protection.

## Federal Legislation

### Unfunded Mandates Reform Act Amendments

**Purpose**: Strengthen the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act to provide meaningful protection against unfunded federal mandates on states and localities.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Unfunded Mandates Accountability
Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that—
(1) The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 has not effectively
    prevented the imposition of unfunded mandates on state and
    local governments;
(2) Federal mandates continue to impose billions of dollars in
    costs on states and localities;
(3) Unfunded mandates undermine state fiscal autonomy and
    democratic accountability;
(4) Strengthening UMRA protections is necessary to restore
    federal-state balance.

SEC. 3. ENHANCED POINT OF ORDER.

Section 425 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 is amended—
(a) By striking "a majority" and inserting "three-fifths"
    wherever it appears;
(b) By adding at the end the following:
    "(e) PROHIBITION ON CONSIDERATION.—It shall not be in order
    to consider any bill, joint resolution, amendment, motion,
    or conference report that would impose an unfunded
    intergovernmental mandate in excess of the threshold unless
    the legislation includes appropriations sufficient to cover
    the costs of the mandate for the fiscal year and each of
    the 4 succeeding fiscal years."

SEC. 4. EXPANDED COVERAGE.

(a) REGULATORY MANDATES.—Section 421 of the Congressional Budget
    Act is amended to include as "intergovernmental mandates"
    any regulation promulgated under authority granted by
    legislation enacted after the date of enactment of this Act.

(b) GRANT CONDITIONS.—The definition of "intergovernmental
    mandate" is amended to include any condition on a federal
    grant that imposes enforceable duties on state, local, or
    tribal governments.

(c) TAX EXPENDITURE IMPACTS.—The Congressional Budget Office
    shall include in its mandate estimates the impacts on
    state and local revenues of changes to federal tax law
    that affect state tax bases.

SEC. 5. IMPROVED ANALYSIS.

(a) TEN-YEAR ESTIMATES.—CBO mandate cost estimates shall cover
    a 10-year period.

(b) INDIRECT COSTS.—Estimates shall include indirect costs
    including administrative burden and opportunity costs.

(c) CUMULATIVE ANALYSIS.—CBO shall annually report on
    cumulative mandate costs to state and local governments.

SEC. 6. JUDICIAL REVIEW.

(a) PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.—Any state or local government may
    bring an action in the United States District Court for
    the District of Columbia to challenge any federal
    requirement as an unfunded intergovernmental mandate.

(b) STANDARD OF REVIEW.—The court shall invalidate any
    requirement found to impose an unfunded intergovernmental
    mandate unless—
    (1) Congress has made an explicit finding that the
        mandate is necessary; and
    (2) Congress has appropriated funds sufficient to cover
        the costs of compliance.

SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date of enactment and shall
apply to legislation introduced after such date.
```

**Explanation**:

The original UMRA has proven ineffective because:
- Simple majority waives point of order
- Regulatory mandates largely excluded
- Grant conditions excluded
- No judicial enforcement

This legislation addresses each weakness with stronger protections.

### Federal Preemption Transparency and Accountability Act

**Purpose**: Establish presumption against federal preemption and require transparency in preemption decisions.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Federal Preemption Transparency
and Accountability Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that—
(1) Federal preemption of state law has expanded dramatically;
(2) Preemption often occurs without explicit congressional
    authorization;
(3) States serve as laboratories for policy innovation;
(4) Clear rules on preemption would improve federalism and
    democratic accountability.

SEC. 3. PRESUMPTION AGAINST PREEMPTION.

(a) IN GENERAL.—In interpreting any Act of Congress, courts
    shall apply a presumption against preemption of state law.

(b) EXPRESS STATEMENT REQUIRED.—Federal law shall not be
    construed to preempt state law unless—
    (1) Congress has included an express statement of intent
        to preempt;
    (2) The express statement specifically identifies the
        state laws to be preempted; and
    (3) The express statement describes the scope of
        preemption.

(c) LIMITATION ON IMPLIED PREEMPTION.—
    (1) NO FIELD PREEMPTION.—Federal law shall not be
        construed to preempt state law based on the
        comprehensiveness of federal regulation in a
        field absent an express statement.
    (2) NO OBSTACLE PREEMPTION.—State law shall not be
        preempted on the ground that it poses an obstacle
        to federal objectives absent an express statement.
    (3) DIRECT CONFLICT PRESERVED.—Nothing in this section
        shall be construed to limit preemption where
        compliance with both state and federal law is
        physically impossible.

SEC. 4. AGENCY PREEMPTION.

(a) NO REGULATORY PREEMPTION WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION.—No federal
    agency may promulgate any rule that preempts state law
    unless Congress has expressly authorized such preemption.

(b) PREEMPTION IMPACT STATEMENT.—Any agency rule that may
    affect state authority shall include a preemption impact
    statement that—
    (1) identifies state laws that may be affected;
    (2) analyzes the federalism implications;
    (3) explains why preemption is necessary; and
    (4) considers alternatives to preemption.

(c) STATE CONSULTATION.—Before promulgating any rule that may
    preempt state law, agencies shall consult with affected
    states and consider their views.

SEC. 5. CONGRESSIONAL PROCEDURES.

(a) COMMITTEE ANALYSIS.—Each congressional committee reporting
    legislation shall include in its report a preemption
    analysis that—
    (1) identifies any preemptive effects;
    (2) explains the need for preemption;
    (3) describes the scope of preemption; and
    (4) considers alternatives.

(b) POINT OF ORDER.—It shall not be in order to consider
    legislation containing preemption provisions unless the
    committee report includes the analysis required by
    subsection (a).

SEC. 6. PREEMPTION DATABASE.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Government Accountability Office shall
    establish and maintain a database of federal preemption
    provisions.

(b) CONTENTS.—The database shall include—
    (1) statutory preemption provisions;
    (2) regulatory preemption provisions;
    (3) judicial preemption interpretations;
    (4) analysis of preemption scope and impact.

(c) PUBLIC ACCESS.—The database shall be publicly accessible
    online.

SEC. 7. ANNUAL REPORT.

The Government Accountability Office shall submit to Congress
an annual report on—
(a) New preemption provisions enacted or promulgated;
(b) Litigation involving federal preemption;
(c) Effects of preemption on state policy innovation;
(d) Recommendations for reform.

SEC. 8. SAVINGS CLAUSE.

(a) SUPREMACY CLAUSE.—Nothing in this Act shall be construed
    to limit the operation of the Supremacy Clause of the
    Constitution where state and federal law are in direct
    and irreconcilable conflict.

(b) EXISTING PREEMPTION.—The interpretive rules in sections
    3(b) and 3(c) apply to statutes enacted after the effective
    date of this Act and do not affect preemption under
    existing law.

(c) OTHER FEDERAL AUTHORITY.—Nothing in this Act shall be
    construed to affect federal preemption of state laws that
    discriminate against interstate commerce or violate federal
    civil rights protections.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**:

This legislation codifies the presumption against preemption recognized in some Supreme Court cases, requires express preemption statements, and creates transparency mechanisms. It preserves federal preemption power but ensures it is exercised deliberately.

### Interstate Compact Facilitation Act

**Purpose**: Facilitate interstate cooperation by pre-authorizing certain categories of compacts and streamlining the consent process.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Interstate Compact Facilitation
Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that—
(1) Interstate compacts are valuable tools for state cooperation;
(2) The Compact Clause consent requirement can delay beneficial
    compacts;
(3) Many compacts do not implicate federal interests requiring
    case-by-case consent;
(4) Pre-authorization of certain compact categories would
    facilitate cooperation.

    (3) do not expand state authority over federal programs; and
    (4) do not impair federal treaty or foreign affairs powers.

## Regulatory Framework

### Executive Order on Federalism

Model provisions for a presidential executive order:

1. **Federalism Principles**: Agencies shall respect state sovereignty and avoid unnecessary preemption
2. **Consultation Requirements**: Agencies shall consult with states before actions affecting state interests
3. **Preemption Review**: OIRA shall review agency preemption decisions
4. **State Flexibility**: Agencies shall maximize state flexibility in implementing federal programs
5. **Federalism Assessment**: Major rules shall include federalism impact assessments

### OMB Circular on Grant Administration

Provisions for administrative guidance:

1. **Unified Requirements**: Establish common requirements across grant programs
2. **Outcome Focus**: Shift from compliance to outcome accountability
3. **Burden Reduction**: Reduce unnecessary reporting and documentation
4. **Technical Assistance**: Provide support for state/local grant administration
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Regular review and update of requirements

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Supremacy Clause**:

- Presumption against preemption legislation is consistent with constitutional structure
- Congress has authority to define preemption rules
- Savings clauses for constitutionally required preemption

**Spending Power**:

- *NFIB v. Sebelius* limits on coercive conditions apply
- Grant condition reforms must respect constitutional limits
- Flexibility provisions generally increase constitutionality

**Compact Clause**:

- Pre-authorization of compacts is constitutional
- Congressional consent authority includes advance consent
- Some compacts may not require consent

### Implementation Challenges

- Agency resistance to preemption limits
- Congressional reluctance to limit own power
- Transition complexities in grant consolidation
- Political pressure on specific programs

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Characterization gaming | Congress characterizes mandates as non-mandates | High |
| Savings clause interpretation | Broad reading of exceptions | Moderate |
| Regulatory circumvention | Agencies use guidance instead of rules | High |
| Pre-authorization abuse | Compacts stretch category definitions | Moderate |
| Grant consolidation reversal | Future Congresses recreate categorical programs | Moderate |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Judicial enforcement challenges | Courts may be reluctant to police | Separation of powers |
| Political will | Reform requires sustained commitment | Short-term politics |
| Complexity of existing system | Full reform takes years | Entrenched interests |
| Partisan inconsistency | Support shifts with party control | Policy-driven federalism |
| Constitutional limits | Cannot eliminate preemption power | Supremacy Clause |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Anti-Circumvention Provisions**
    - Define mandate broadly to prevent gaming
    - Include guidance documents in regulatory coverage
    - Require good-faith compact category interpretation
    - Provide for judicial review of agency compliance

2. **Sustained Oversight**
    - Annual GAO reports on implementation
    - Congressional hearings on federalism
    - State and local government monitoring
    - Academic evaluation

3. **Enforcement Mechanisms**
    - Private right of action for states
    - Attorney general enforcement authority
    - Clear standing provisions
    - Meaningful remedies including injunctive relief

4. **Institutional Support**
    - Permanent federalism office in White House
    - Federalism commission for ongoing review
    - State-federal consultation mechanisms
    - Grant simplification implementation support

### General Implementation Concerns

1. **Agency Compliance**
    - Agencies have incentives to resist federalism constraints
    - Leadership commitment essential
    - OIRA review must be rigorous
    - Inspector general oversight helpful

2. **Congressional Follow-Through**
    - Congress must apply requirements to itself
    - Point of order waivers must be difficult
    - Appropriations must fund mandates
    - Oversight must be sustained

3. **Judicial Reception**
    - Courts may be skeptical of federalism legislation
    - Clear congressional findings help
    - Careful drafting reduces vulnerability
    - May require multiple legislative iterations

4. **State Capacity**
    - States must be prepared for increased flexibility
    - Technical assistance important during transition
    - Performance accountability prevents abuse
    - Learning curve for new grant structures
