# Federalism Reform: Current State

## Federal-State Relations Today

### Constitutional Framework

The basic structure remains:

- **Supremacy Clause**: Federal law trumps conflicting state law
- **Enumerated Powers**: Federal powers theoretically limited
- **Commerce Clause**: Primary source of federal regulatory power
- **Spending Power**: Federal grants as policy tool
- **Tenth Amendment**: Reserved powers to states

### Practical Reality (2024 snapshot)

Despite constitutional limits, federal influence pervasive:

| Mechanism | Extent |
|-----------|--------|
| Direct regulation | Extensive in commerce, environment, labor |
| Preemption | Hundreds of federal statutes preempt state law |
| Conditional grants | $750+ billion annually with conditions |
| Tax policy | Federal tax code affects state choices |
| Administrative mandates | Regulatory requirements on states |

## Federal Preemption

### Scope of Preemption

Federal preemption has expanded dramatically:

**By Policy Area**:

| Area | Preemption Level | Examples |
|------|------------------|----------|
| Banking/Finance | High | National Bank Act, Dodd-Frank |
| Telecommunications | High | FCC regulations |
| Food/Drug | High | FDA authority |
| Environment | Mixed | Clean Air Act (floor), some ceiling |
| Labor | Mixed | ERISA, NLRA preempt much state law |
| Consumer Protection | Mixed | Some federal floors, some ceilings |
| Immigration | High | Federal exclusive authority |
| Insurance | Low | McCarran-Ferguson Act defers to states |

**Express vs. Implied Preemption**:

- **Express**: Statute explicitly preempts state law
- **Field**: Federal regulation so comprehensive it occupies the field
- **Conflict**: State law conflicts with federal objectives

### Recent Preemption Trends

**Federal Ceiling Preemption** (prevents stricter state laws):

- Tobacco regulation (some aspects)
- Airline deregulation
- Medical device labeling
- Various consumer product standards

**Federal Floor Preemption** (allows stricter state laws):

- Clean Air Act (California can be stricter)
- Some consumer protection laws
- Historically civil rights laws

### Partisan Shifts on Preemption

| Issue Area | Who Favors Federal Preemption |
|------------|------------------------------|
| Environmental regulation | Conservatives (prevent strict state rules) |
| Gun rights | Conservatives (prevent state restrictions) |
| Marijuana | Progressives (allow state legalization) |
| Immigration | Progressives (prevent restrictive state laws) |
| Labor law | Progressives (prevent weak state laws) |
| Consumer protection | Split depending on specific issue |

## Unfunded Mandates

### Current Scale

Unfunded mandates remain significant despite 1995 reform:

**Types of Mandates**:

- **Statutory**: Laws imposing requirements on states
- **Regulatory**: Agency rules with state compliance costs
- **Conditional**: Attached to federal funding
- **Constitutional**: Civil rights requirements

**Major Unfunded or Underfunded Mandates (2024 snapshot)**:

| Mandate | Annual State/Local Cost (est.) |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| Special education (IDEA) | $30+ billion gap |
| Medicaid | State share growing |
| Clean Water Act | Billions for infrastructure |
| REAL ID | $3-4 billion implementation |
| Election administration | Significant local costs |
| Immigration detention | Costs to localities |

### Unfunded Mandates Reform Act

**Requirements**:

- CBO must estimate costs of mandates over $50 million
- Point of order can be raised against unfunded mandates
- Agencies must assess mandate costs

**Weaknesses**:

- Applies only to new mandates, not existing
- Easy to waive point of order
- Exempts civil rights, constitutional requirements
- No real enforcement mechanism
- Does not require funding, only disclosure

### State and Local Complaints

From National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL):

- Federal mandates cost states billions annually
- Mandate costs crowd out state priorities
- Uncertainty about future mandates hinders planning
- Administrative burden significant even for funded programs

## Federal Grants and Conditions

### Grant System Scale (2024 snapshot)

Federal grants to states and localities:

| Fiscal Year | Total Grants | Percent of State Budgets |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------------|
| 2000 | $285 billion | ~25% |
| 2010 | $608 billion | ~35% |
| 2020 | $721 billion | ~32% |
| 2021 | $1.2 trillion | ~45% (pandemic) |

**Major Grant Programs**:

- Medicaid: ~$500 billion (pre-pandemic)
- Transportation: ~$65 billion
- Education: ~$60 billion
- SNAP/Food stamps: ~$80 billion
- Housing: ~$50 billion

### Grant Conditions

**Types of Conditions**:

- **Programmatic**: Related to grant purpose (mostly accepted)
- **Cross-cutting**: Apply to all grants (civil rights, environmental)
- **Cross-over**: Conditions on one grant affecting another
- **Unrelated**: Conditions unconnected to grant purpose (constitutionally suspect)

**Constitutional Limits** (*South Dakota v. Dole* test):

1. Spending must be for general welfare
2. Conditions must be unambiguous
3. Conditions must relate to federal interest in program
4. May not violate independent constitutional bar
5. May not be coercive (*NFIB v. Sebelius*)

### Administrative Complexity

States and localities face significant administrative burden:

- Multiple federal agencies with overlapping programs
- Different reporting requirements for each grant
- Auditing and compliance costs
- Staff dedicated to grant management
- Risk of recapture for compliance failures

**Example: Homelessness Programs**

A community seeking federal homelessness assistance may need to navigate:

- HUD Continuum of Care program
- HHS substance abuse grants
- VA homeless veteran programs
- Education homeless youth grants
- Multiple reporting systems and requirements

## Interstate Relations

### Interstate Compacts

**Current Landscape (2024 snapshot)**:

Over 200 interstate compacts currently in force:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Boundary/Resource | Colorado River Compact, Great Lakes Compact |
| Transportation | Port Authority of NY & NJ, bridge/tunnel authorities |
| Environment | Regional greenhouse gas initiatives |
| Professional | Nurse Licensure Compact, Driver License Compact |
| Criminal Justice | Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision |
| Electoral | National Popular Vote Interstate Compact |

**Growing Use**:

- Compacts increasing as workaround for federal gridlock
- States addressing regional problems independently
- Professional licensing compacts expanding
- Environmental compacts emerging

### Interstate Competition

**"Race to the Bottom"**:

States compete for business through:

- Tax incentives and abatements
- Reduced environmental regulations
- Weaker labor protections
- Business-friendly courts

**Economic Development Incentives (2024 snapshot)**:

- $45+ billion annually in state/local incentives
- Effectiveness questioned by research
- Creates prisoners' dilemma among states
- Benefits often go to firms that would locate anyway

### Interstate Conflict

**Current Disputes**:

- Water rights (Colorado River, etc.)
- Tax disputes (internet sales, remote workers)
- Environmental externalities
- Recognition of licenses and marriages

## Constitutional Litigation

### Current Supreme Court Approach

**Commerce Clause**:

- Broad interpretation generally maintained
- *Lopez* and *Morrison* limits rarely applied
- *Raich* showed limits of new federalism

**Anti-Commandeering**:

- Cannot force states to implement federal programs
- *Murphy v. NCAA* (2018): Extended to prohibitions on state action
- States can decline to enforce federal law

**Spending Power**:

- *NFIB v. Sebelius* (2012): Coercion limit exists
- What constitutes coercion remains unclear
- Most conditional funding likely still constitutional

**State Sovereign Immunity**:

- Broad immunity from private suits
- Some exceptions for federal enforcement
- *Allen v. Cooper* (2020): Reaffirmed immunity

### Active Litigation Areas

- State challenges to federal regulations
- Federal challenges to state immigration laws
- Environmental preemption disputes
- ACA implementation disputes
- COVID-related federalism cases

## Partisan Federalism

### Current Patterns

Neither party consistently pro-federal or pro-state:

**Conservative/Republican**:

- Pro-state: Environmental, labor, consumer regulation
- Pro-federal: Immigration, gun rights, marijuana, tort reform

**Progressive/Democratic**:

- Pro-federal: Civil rights, labor, consumer, environmental
- Pro-state: Marijuana, sanctuary cities, climate policy

### State Resistance and Laboratories

**Blue State Resistance (Trump Era)**:

- Sanctuary city policies
- State climate initiatives
- State net neutrality laws
- SALT deduction workarounds

**Red State Resistance (Biden Era)**:

- Vaccine mandate challenges
- Border enforcement disputes
- ESG investment restrictions
- Election administration conflicts

## Fiscal Federalism (2024 snapshot)

### Revenue and Spending Mismatch

**Federal Government**:

- Collects ~55% of all government revenue
- Income tax and payroll tax dominance
- Can run deficits

**State Governments**:

- Collect ~25% of revenue
- Sales tax, income tax, fees
- Most require balanced budgets

**Local Governments**:

- Collect ~20% of revenue
- Property tax dominance
- Heavily dependent on state aid

### Intergovernmental Transfers

Federal transfers account for significant share of state budgets:

| State Category | Federal Share of Revenue |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| Low (Wyoming, Alaska) | ~25-30% |
| Average | ~32-35% |
| High (Mississippi, Louisiana) | ~42-45% |

### State-Local Relations

Often overlooked dimension:

- States set rules for local governments
- State preemption of local ordinances increasing
- Minimum wage, plastic bags, sanctuary policies
- "Super preemption" in some states
