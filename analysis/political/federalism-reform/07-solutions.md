# Federalism Reform: Solutions

## Framework for Reform

Effective federalism reform requires:

1. **Clear principles** for allocating responsibilities
2. **Adequate resources** for mandated functions
3. **Reduced complexity** in federal-state programs
4. **Improved accountability** at both levels
5. **Enhanced cooperation** among states
6. **Protection for local governments** from state preemption

## Preemption Reform

### Problem

Federal preemption has expanded without principled limits, often at industry request, preventing state policy innovation.

### Solution: Presumption Against Preemption

**Statutory Presumption**:

- Require explicit preemption statement in federal legislation
- Prohibit implied preemption absent express statement
- Require narrow reading of preemption provisions
- Preserve state authority unless explicitly displaced

**Congressional Procedures**:

- Require committee analysis of preemption impacts
- Point of order against implied preemption
- Sunset provisions for preemption provisions
- Periodic review of existing preemptions

**Executive Action**:

- Executive Order establishing presumption against preemption
- Require agency preemption statements in regulations
- OMB review of agency preemption decisions
- Agency consultation with states before preemption

### Solution: Federal Floors, Not Ceilings

**Principle**: Federal standards should generally set minimum protections, allowing states to exceed.

**Implementation**:

| Policy Area | Recommendation |
|-------------|----------------|
| Consumer protection | Federal floor, states can be stricter |
| Environmental protection | Federal floor (with some exceptions) |
| Worker protection | Federal floor |
| Product safety | Federal floor |
| Banking/Financial | More complex; case-by-case |

**Preserve State Litigation**:

- Protect state attorney general enforcement authority
- Preserve state common law claims
- Limit regulatory preemption of state courts

### Solution: Preemption Transparency

**Disclosure Requirements**:

- Annual report on federal preemption activity
- Agency preemption impact assessments
- GAO analysis of preemption effects
- Public database of preemption provisions

## Unfunded Mandate Reform

### Problem

Federal mandates impose costs on states without adequate funding, straining state budgets and undermining state priorities.

### Solution: Strengthen Unfunded Mandates Reform Act

**Enhanced Point of Order**:

- Require 60-vote threshold to waive point of order (not simple majority)
- Apply to regulatory mandates, not just statutory
- Expand definition of mandate to close loopholes
- Cover conditions on existing grants

**Improved Analysis**:

- CBO analysis of mandate costs over 10 years
- Include indirect costs, not just direct
- Assess administrative burden
- Consider cumulative mandate costs

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- Private right of action for states to challenge unfunded mandates
- Require congressional reauthorization of major mandates
- Automatic sunset for unfunded mandates without reauthorization

### Solution: Adequate Funding Requirements

**"Funded Mandate" Requirement**:

- New mandates must include appropriations covering costs
- Formula for adjusting funding as costs change
- State reporting on actual mandate costs
- Reconciliation process for underfunding

**Priority Mandates**:

| Program | Reform Needed |
|---------|---------------|
| Special Education (IDEA) | Fund toward promised 40% federal share |
| Medicaid | Maintain federal share, reduce administrative burden |
| Clean Water/Air | Infrastructure funding for compliance |
| Election administration | Full funding for federal requirements |

## Grant System Reform

### Problem

The grant system is fragmented, complex, and administratively burdensome.

### Solution: Grant Consolidation

**Block Grant Principles**:

- Consolidate related categorical programs
- Maintain total funding levels
- Allow state flexibility within broad purposes
- Require outcome accountability, not process compliance
- Include hold-harmless provisions

**Model: Workforce Investment**:

- Consolidate overlapping job training programs
- Single state plan
- Unified reporting
- Performance-based accountability
- State flexibility in service delivery

### Solution: Administrative Simplification

**Single Application Process**:

- Consolidated grant applications
- Single state plan for related programs
- Unified federal agency contacts

**Unified Reporting**:

- Single reporting system across programs
- Common definitions and data elements
- Reduced frequency where possible
- Technology-enabled reporting

**Single Audit**:

- Consolidated audit requirements
- Risk-based audit approach
- Reduced audit burden for low-risk grantees
- Multi-year audit cycles

### Solution: Outcome-Based Accountability

**Shift from Compliance to Outcomes**:

| Current Approach | Reformed Approach |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Process requirements | Outcome measures |
| Input accounting | Output/outcome reporting |
| Audit compliance | Performance evaluation |
| Federal micromanagement | State flexibility with accountability |

**Performance Partnership**:

- States negotiate outcome goals with federal agencies
- Flexibility in achieving goals
- Rewards for high performance
- Support for struggling states

## Interstate Cooperation Enhancement

### Problem

Interstate compacts and cooperation mechanisms are underutilized due to procedural barriers.

### Solution: Compact Facilitation

**Congressional Pre-Authorization**:

- Pre-authorize categories of compacts not affecting federal interests
- Expedited consent process for compacts that do require consent
- Clear criteria for when consent required
- Model compact templates

**Categories for Pre-Authorization**:

- Professional licensing compacts
- Environmental protection compacts
- Emergency management compacts
- Driver licensing compacts
- Tax administration compacts

**Compact Administration Support**:

- Federal technical assistance for compact development
- Funding for compact administration
- Research on compact effectiveness
- Best practices clearinghouse

### Solution: Regional Coordination

**Regional Planning**:

- Support multi-state planning for regional issues
- Fund regional coordination mechanisms
- Address water, transportation, environment regionally

**Interstate Dispute Resolution**:

- Streamlined Supreme Court original jurisdiction procedures
- Mediation services for interstate disputes
- Support for negotiated solutions

## State-Local Relations

### Problem

States increasingly preempt local governments from addressing local problems.

### Solution: Local Government Protection

**Home Rule Strengthening**:

- Model constitutional provisions for local authority
- Presumption of local authority absent state preemption
- State preemption requires explicit statement

**Preemption Limits**:

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Democratic subsidiarity | Prefer local decision-making |
| Preemption as exception | Require clear state interest |
| No punitive preemption | Prohibit personal liability for officials |
| Adequate transition | Time for local compliance |

**Federal Leverage**:

- Condition certain federal funds on state respect for local authority
- Direct federal-local programs where appropriate
- Federal amicus support for local governments in preemption challenges

## Fiscal Federalism Reform

### Problem

Mismatch between revenue authority and spending responsibility creates intergovernmental fiscal problems.

### Solution: Revenue-Responsibility Alignment

**Options**:

1. **Federal block grants**: Give states flexibility with federal funds
2. **Tax source reassignment**: Transfer revenue sources between levels
3. **Tax sharing arrangements**: Share revenues from specific sources
4. **State-local fiscal reform**: States provide adequate local government funding

### Solution: Counter-Cyclical Aid

**Automatic Stabilizers**:

- Automatic increase in federal aid during recessions
- Maintenance of effort requirements in expansions
- Rainy day fund incentives for states

### Solution: Tax Competition Limits

**Interstate Coordination**:

- Model legislation against tax incentive bidding wars
- Disclosure requirements for business incentives
- Interstate compact on incentive limits
- Federal incentives for coordination

## Accountability Enhancement

### Problem

Complex federal-state relationships obscure accountability for policy outcomes.

### Solution: Clear Responsibility Assignment

**Principles**:

- Each function primarily assigned to one level
- Where shared, clear division of roles
- Public communication of responsibility
- Performance reporting by level

**Model Approaches**:

| Function | Recommended Assignment |
|----------|------------------------|
| Cash assistance | Federal (simplest accountability) |
| Healthcare | Federal framework, state flexibility |
| Education | State/local with federal civil rights floor |
| Environment | Federal standards, state implementation |
| Transportation | Primarily state with federal support |

### Solution: Transparency Measures

**Public Reporting**:

- Annual federalism report card
- State-by-state program performance
- Federal-state spending breakdown
- Administrative cost tracking

**Citizen Education**:

- Clear explanations of federal-state roles
- Program guides by level of government
- Contact information by function
