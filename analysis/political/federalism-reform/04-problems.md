# Federalism Reform: Problems

## Excessive and Inconsistent Preemption

### Problem Statement

Federal preemption has expanded dramatically without principled limits, preventing states from serving as policy laboratories while failing to provide coherent national standards.

### Evidence

**Expansion of Preemption**:

- Hundreds of federal statutes contain preemption provisions
- Preemption increasingly used as industry lobbying strategy
- Courts often find implied preemption even without express language
- Little consistency in when preemption applies

**Examples of Problematic Preemption**:

| Area | Issue |
|------|-------|
| Banking | OCC preemption prevents state consumer protection |
| Medical devices | FDA approval preempts failure-to-warn claims |
| Telecommunications | FCC preempts state broadband regulation |
| Automobiles | NHTSA standards preempt stricter state safety rules |
| Airlines | Airline Deregulation Act preempts state consumer rules |

**States as Laboratories Blocked**:

- States cannot experiment with stronger consumer protections
- Innovation in one state cannot spread to others
- National standards often reflect industry preferences
- Democratic choices at state level overridden

### Root Causes

- Industry lobbying for uniform (and weaker) national standards
- Congressional delegation to agencies that favor preemption
- Court doctrines expanding implied preemption
- Lack of clear presumption against preemption
- No systematic review of preemption decisions

### Impacts

- Consumer protection weakened
- Democratic accountability reduced
- Policy experimentation stifled
- Regulatory race to lowest common denominator

## Unfunded and Underfunded Mandates

### Problem Statement

Federal government imposes costly requirements on states without providing adequate resources, creating fiscal stress and undermining state policy priorities.

### Evidence

**Chronic Underfunding**:

| Program | Federal Share Promised | Actual Federal Share |
|---------|----------------------|---------------------|
| Special Education (IDEA) | 40% of excess cost | ~15% actually funded |
| Medicaid | Varies by formula | State costs rising |
| Clean Water Act | Infrastructure needs | Vast unfunded backlog |
| Election administration | Standards mandated | Limited federal funding |

**Cost Shifting**:

- Federal tax cuts reduce state revenues (SALT deduction limits)
- Medicaid expansion (though largely funded) adds state costs
- Regulatory requirements impose compliance costs
- Environmental mandates require state investment

**Mandate Creep**:

- Administrative agencies add requirements
- Guidance documents become de facto mandates
- Auditing requirements expand
- Grant conditions proliferate

### Root Causes

- Federal politicians take credit, states bear costs
- Unfunded Mandates Reform Act ineffective
- Constitutional limits unclear
- State voices weak in federal process
- Easy to impose costs on other governments

### Impacts

- State budgets strained
- Local programs cut to fund mandates
- Tax increases or service cuts at state/local level
- State priorities overridden by federal requirements
- Implementation often poor due to inadequate resources

## Administrative Complexity

### Problem Statement

The federal grant system is fragmented, duplicative, and administratively burdensome, consuming resources that could fund actual services.

### Evidence

**Fragmentation**:

- Over 1,000 federal grant programs
- Multiple agencies with overlapping missions
- Different reporting, accounting, and auditing requirements
- Inconsistent rules across programs

**Administrative Burden**:

- States employ thousands of staff for federal compliance
- Grant application processes complex and time-consuming
- Reporting requirements consume significant resources
- Audit responses require substantial effort

**Case Study: Early Childhood Programs**:

A state seeking federal early childhood funding may need to navigate:

- Head Start (HHS)
- Child Care Development Block Grant (HHS)
- IDEA Part C (Education)
- Title I Preschool (Education)
- Child and Adult Care Food Program (Agriculture)
- Multiple state plans, reports, and audits for each

### Root Causes

- Congressional committee structure fragments programs
- Each program has own constituency defending it
- Consolidation threatens specific beneficiaries
- Agency turf protection
- Accumulated requirements never streamlined

### Impacts

- Administrative costs divert funds from services
- Small governments disproportionately burdened
- States unable to integrate services effectively
- Innovation stifled by categorical requirements
- Compliance focus rather than outcome focus

## Coercion Through Conditional Funding

### Problem Statement

Federal conditions on grants can effectively coerce state policy choices, undermining federalism while obscuring accountability.

### Evidence

**Scale of Conditions**:

- Federal grants often come with hundreds of pages of requirements
- Conditions increasingly extend beyond grant purpose
- Loss of funding can devastate state programs

**Coercive Conditions**:

| Condition | Mechanism |
|-----------|-----------|
| 21 drinking age | Highway funds conditioned |
| No Child Left Behind | Education funds conditioned |
| ACA Medicaid expansion | Threatened total Medicaid loss |
| Real ID | Access to federal facilities |

**Federalism Without Choice**:

- States theoretically can refuse grants
- Practically, state budgets depend on federal funds
- Political cost of refusing grants prohibitive
- Conditions become de facto mandates

### Root Causes

- Spending power broader than regulatory power
- *South Dakota v. Dole* test easily satisfied
- *NFIB* coercion limit vague
- Federal politicians prefer indirect pressure
- States politically unable to refuse large grants

### Impacts

- State fiscal dependence on federal government
- Policy choices driven by funding availability
- Democratic accountability obscured
- State officials implement federal priorities

## Accountability Gaps

### Problem Statement

Complex federal-state relationships obscure who is responsible for policy outcomes, making democratic accountability difficult.

### Evidence

**Blame Shifting**:

- States blame federal mandates for unpopular choices
- Federal government blames state implementation failures
- Neither level clearly accountable
- Voters cannot assign responsibility

**Examples**:

| Program | Accountability Problem |
|---------|----------------------|
| Medicaid | Federal rules, state administration |
| Education | Federal standards, state/local delivery |
| Unemployment | Federal framework, state operation |
| Environmental | Federal standards, state permits |

**Voter Confusion**:

- Most voters don't understand which level is responsible
- Elections cannot effectively sanction poor performance
- Policy failures attributed to wrong government

### Root Causes

- Intermingled responsibilities by design
- Shared programs prevent clear accountability
- Complex funding streams
- Multiple veto points
- Politicians prefer avoiding accountability

### Impacts

- Democratic theory undermined
- Policy failures persist without correction
- Officials avoid responsibility
- Reform difficult when accountability unclear

## Interstate Race to the Bottom

### Problem Statement

Competition among states for business and residents can drive down standards, harming workers, consumers, and the environment.

### Evidence

**Tax Competition**:

- States spend $45+ billion annually on business incentives
- Research shows most incentives don't affect location decisions
- Revenue lost from tax competition
- Services cut to fund incentives

**Regulatory Competition**:

- Delaware incorporation: Race to weakest corporate law
- South Dakota trusts: Asset protection competition
- State environmental standards: Pressured downward
- Labor law: Right-to-work competition

**Examples**:

| Area | Competition Effect |
|------|-------------------|
| Corporate law | Delaware wins through management-friendly rules |
| Tax incentives | Amazon HQ2 bidding war |
| Environmental permits | Chemical plants in loosely regulated states |
| Banking regulation | Charter shopping |

### Root Causes

- Prisoners' dilemma among states
- Business mobility and lobbying power
- Political pressure to attract jobs
- Federal floor preemption absent in many areas
- Tax competition politically popular

### Impacts

- Public revenues reduced
- Worker protections weakened
- Environmental standards lowered
- Benefits accrue to mobile capital, not residents

## State-Local Conflicts

### Problem Statement

States increasingly preempt local governments from addressing local problems, creating a new federalism problem within states.

### Evidence

**State Preemption of Local Action**:

| Policy Area | States Preempting |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Minimum wage | 25+ states |
| Paid leave | 20+ states |
| Plastic bag bans | 15+ states |
| Sanctuary policies | 10+ states |
| Anti-discrimination | Various states |
| Rent control | 30+ states |

**"Super Preemption"**:

- Some states not only preempt but punish local officials
- Personal liability for officials passing preempted ordinances
- Florida, Texas, Arizona examples

### Root Causes

- State legislatures often more conservative than cities
- Business lobbying effective at state level
- Partisan conflict between state and local governments
- Limited constitutional protection for local governments
- "Dillon's Rule" states restrict local authority

### Impacts

- Cities cannot address local problems
- Democratic participation at local level frustrated
- Uniform state policy may not fit all communities
- Local innovation blocked

## Partisan Inconsistency

### Problem Statement

Both parties shift federalism positions based on policy preferences rather than principled views, undermining coherent constitutional interpretation.

### Evidence

**Position Shifts**:

| Issue | Traditional Conservative Position | Recent Conservative Position |
|-------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Marijuana | Federal prohibition | Some state flexibility |
| Immigration | State cooperation | Some federal preemption |
| Environment | States' rights | Federal preemption of strict states |
| Guns | States' rights | Federal preemption of restrictions |

| Issue | Traditional Progressive Position | Recent Progressive Position |
|-------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Labor | Federal standards | State experimentation |
| Environment | Federal standards | State leadership |
| Marijuana | Federal power | State experimentation |
| Sanctuary cities | Federal supremacy | Local autonomy |

### Root Causes

- Federalism as means to policy ends
- No consistent constitutional philosophy
- Short-term political calculations
- Different levels controlled by different parties

### Impacts

- Constitutional interpretation unstable
- Precedents undercut by position shifts
- Federalism principles lack legitimacy
- Long-term planning difficult

## Insufficient Interstate Cooperation

### Problem Statement

Many problems require interstate coordination, but mechanisms for state cooperation are cumbersome and underutilized.

### Evidence

**Problems Requiring Cooperation**:

- Water resources (rivers, aquifers crossing borders)
- Air quality (pollution transport)
- Transportation networks
- Professional licensing
- Tax administration
- Criminal justice

**Barriers to Compacts**:

- Congressional consent required for many compacts
- Negotiation process lengthy
- Ratification difficult across multiple legislatures
- Administration of compacts complex
- Exit provisions often unclear

**Underutilization**:

- Many regional problems lack effective compacts
- Existing compacts sometimes underfunded
- Political disputes can paralyze compact administration

### Root Causes

- Congressional consent requirement uncertain in scope
- Transaction costs of compact negotiation high
- Political differences among states
- Federal government sometimes undermines cooperation
- Limited compact expertise in state governments

### Impacts

- Regional problems unaddressed
- Spillovers harm neighboring states
- Coordination failures waste resources
- Federal intervention triggered by state failure
