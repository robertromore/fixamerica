# Federalism Reform: Roadmap

## Strategic Considerations

### Bipartisan Approach Essential

Federalism reform requires cross-partisan coalition:

- Both parties favor federalism when in minority at federal level
- Both parties favor federal power when in majority
- Principled federalism reform must transcend party
- Focus on process and structure, not specific policy outcomes

### Building the Coalition

**Core Supporters**:

- State and local government organizations
- Good government groups
- Fiscal conservatives (mandate reform)
- Progressive advocates of state experimentation

**Persuadable Groups**:

- Business groups (on simplification, certainty)
- Former state and local officials in Congress
- Scholars and think tanks
- Editorial boards and media

**Difficult to Win**:

- Advocates of specific federal programs
- Federal agency personnel
- Strong nationalists on either side

### State-Federal Dynamics

- States have leverage through implementation
- Governors have visibility and influence
- State AG litigation shapes doctrine
- State resistance can force negotiation

## Phase 1: Foundation Building (Year 1-2)

### Coalition Building

**State and Local Organization Coordination**:

- Convene "Big Seven" organizations around federalism agenda
- Develop consensus reform proposals
- Coordinate lobbying and communications
- Build grassroots support in states

**Bipartisan Congressional Outreach**:

- Identify federalism champions in both parties
- Caucus or working group formation
- Staff education on federalism issues
- Model legislation development

**Academic and Think Tank Engagement**:

- Research on federalism problems and solutions
- Expert convenings
- Publications and op-eds
- Testimony preparation

### Quick Wins

**Executive Action**:

- Executive Order on federalism consultation
- Agency guidance on preemption restraint
- OMB circular on grant simplification
- Federal-state consultation protocols

**Administrative Reform**:

- Grant application simplification pilot
- Single audit improvements
- State plan streamlining
- Reporting burden reduction

### Legislative Groundwork

**Congressional Awareness**:

- Hearings on federalism issues
- GAO studies commissioned
- CBO mandate cost analysis
- Bipartisan letters and statements

**Model Legislation Drafting**:

- UMRA reform bill
- Preemption transparency act
- Grant consolidation framework
- Compact facilitation legislation

## Phase 2: Initial Reforms (Year 2-4)

### UMRA Strengthening

**Legislative Campaign**:

- Build bipartisan cosponsor coalition
- State and local government lobby push
- Public awareness campaign
- Committee markup and floor action

**Key Provisions**:

1. Strengthen point of order (60-vote threshold)
2. Expand definition of mandate
3. Include regulatory mandates
4. Apply to grant conditions
5. Create private right of action

### Preemption Transparency

**Legislative Campaign**:

- Companion bills in House and Senate
- Bipartisan sponsorship essential
- Business support for regulatory certainty
- Consumer group support for state protection

**Key Provisions**:

1. Annual preemption report
2. Agency preemption impact statements
3. GAO preemption inventory
4. Public database of preemption provisions

### Compact Facilitation

**Legislative Campaign**:

- Pre-authorization for categories of compacts
- Streamlined consent procedures
- Technical assistance program
- Bipartisan support likely

**Categories to Pre-Authorize**:

- Professional licensing (already popular)
- Emergency management
- Driver licensing
- Tax administration (with limits)

### Grant Simplification Pilot

**Administrative Action**:

- Select pilot program area (workforce, early childhood)
- Negotiate with participating states
- Streamline requirements
- Evaluate outcomes

## Phase 3: Major Reforms (Year 4-6)

### Comprehensive Preemption Reform

**Federalism Act**:

- Establish presumption against preemption
- Require explicit preemption statements
- Limit implied preemption
- Create preemption review process

**Challenges**:

- Business opposition to state flexibility
- Agency resistance
- Some progressive concern about state weakness
- Partisan policy preferences

**Strategy**:

- Build on transparency legislation success
- Document preemption harms
- Engage business on regulatory certainty benefits
- Address civil rights concerns with floor preservation

### Grant Consolidation

**Block Grant Reform**:

- Consolidate related categorical programs
- Maintain funding levels
- Increase state flexibility
- Outcome accountability

**Target Areas**:

| Area | Current Programs | Consolidation Potential |
|------|------------------|------------------------|
| Workforce | Multiple training programs | High |
| Early childhood | Head Start, CCDBG, etc. | Moderate |
| Housing | Multiple HUD programs | Moderate |
| Community development | CDBG, EDA, etc. | Moderate |

**Safeguards**:

- Funding maintenance requirements
- Civil rights protections
- Performance accountability
- Hold harmless provisions

### Fiscal Federalism Reform

**State Aid Stabilization**:

- Automatic counter-cyclical aid mechanism
- State rainy day fund incentives
- Maintenance of effort requirements
- Reduce budget volatility

## Phase 4: Structural Reforms (Year 6-10)

### Constitutional Consideration

**If Legislative Reforms Insufficient**:

Consider constitutional amendments for:

- Unfunded mandate prohibition
- Federal-state consultation requirements
- Preemption supermajority requirement

**Realistic Assessment**:

- Constitutional amendments extremely difficult
- Focus on statutory and administrative reform
- Use constitutional discussion to build pressure

### Institutional Development

**Federalism Commission**:

- Permanent body monitoring federal-state relations
- Report to Congress and President annually
- Recommend reforms
- Evaluate intergovernmental programs

**State-Federal Relations Office**:

- White House office for federalism
- Cabinet-level coordination
- State consultation protocols
- Intergovernmental dispute resolution

### State-Local Reform Support

**Federal Leverage**:

- Condition certain grants on local government protection
- Support model state legislation on home rule
- Research and technical assistance
- Best practices dissemination

**State Action**:

- Model state constitutional provisions
- Home rule strengthening campaigns
- State legislation against punitive preemption
