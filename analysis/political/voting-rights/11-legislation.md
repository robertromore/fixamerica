# Voting Rights: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Voting rights protection requires both federal legislation to restore Voting Rights Act protections and state reforms to expand access. This document provides draft legislation for federal voting rights restoration, automatic voter registration, and other access expansions.

## Constitutional Amendments

### Right to Vote Amendment

**Purpose**: Establish an explicit constitutional right to vote, which the Constitution currently lacks.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. Every citizen of the United States, who is eighteen
years of age or older, shall have the fundamental right to vote
in any public election held in the jurisdiction in which the
citizen resides.

SECTION 2. Congress shall have the power to enforce and implement
this article by appropriate legislation, and to establish minimum
national standards for the administration of elections.

SECTION 3. No State shall impose any barrier to voting that is
not necessary to verify eligibility, prevent fraud, or administer
elections in an orderly manner.

SECTION 4. Any citizen denied the right to vote in violation of
this article shall have a private right of action in federal court.

SECTION 5. This article shall take effect one year after the date
of ratification.

```text

**Explanation**:

- **Section 1**: Creates affirmative right (current Constitution only prohibits certain restrictions)
- **Section 3**: Establishes balancing test for voting restrictions
- **Section 4**: Enables individual enforcement

### Restore Felon Voting Rights Amendment

**Purpose**: End disenfranchisement for felony convictions.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. The right of citizens of the United States to vote
shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any
State on account of criminal history or conviction.

SECTION 2. Congress shall have the power to enforce this article
by appropriate legislation.

```text

**Explanation**: Broader than main Right to Vote amendment—removes all criminal disenfranchisement. More difficult to pass but more comprehensive.

## Federal Legislation

### John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act

**Purpose**: Restore and modernize the Voting Rights Act of 1965 after *Shelby County v. Holder* gutted Section 5 preclearance.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "John Lewis Voting Rights
Advancement Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) In Shelby County v. Holder (2013), the Supreme Court struck
    down the coverage formula of Section 4(b) of the Voting Rights
    Act, rendering Section 5 preclearance ineffective.
(2) Since Shelby County, jurisdictions previously covered have
    enacted voting restrictions that would have been blocked.
(3) Voting discrimination persists and requires ongoing federal
    protection.
(4) A new coverage formula based on recent violations is
    constitutional and necessary.

SEC. 3. COVERAGE FORMULA.

(a) COVERED PRACTICES.—The following practices shall be subject
    to preclearance under section 5 of the Voting Rights Act:
    (1) Changes to methods of election;
    (2) Redistricting or changes to district boundaries;
    (3) Changes to voter registration procedures;
    (4) Changes to polling place locations or hours;
    (5) Changes to voter identification requirements;
    (6) Changes to language assistance.

(b) COVERED JURISDICTIONS.—A jurisdiction is covered for
    preclearance purposes if, within the preceding 25 years:
    (1) A federal court has found a violation of the Fourteenth
        or Fifteenth Amendment concerning voting;
    (2) A federal court has found a violation of the Voting
        Rights Act;
    (3) The Attorney General has interposed an objection to a
        submission under Section 5; or
    (4) A consent decree has been entered resolving voting
        rights claims.

(c) BAIL-OUT.—A covered jurisdiction may bail out of coverage
    by demonstrating that for 10 years it has not:
    (1) Engaged in any voting practice requiring preclearance;
    (2) Been found to have violated voting rights;
    (3) Had any objection interposed.

SEC. 4. PRECLEARANCE STANDARDS.

(a) SUBMISSION.—Before implementing any covered practice, a
    covered jurisdiction shall submit the change to the Attorney
    General or the District Court for the District of Columbia.

(b) STANDARD.—A change shall be precleared if it neither has the
    purpose nor will have the effect of denying or abridging
    the right to vote on account of race, color, or language
    minority status.

(c) TIMELINE.—The Attorney General shall respond within 60 days.
    Failure to respond is deemed precleared.

SEC. 5. NATIONWIDE PRACTICES.

(a) PRECLEARANCE FOR ALL.—The following practices shall require
    preclearance nationwide:
    (1) Reduction in voting locations in minority communities;
    (2) Redistricting plans affecting minority representation;
    (3) Changes within 180 days of a federal election.

SEC. 6. PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION.

(a) STANDARD.—In any action challenging a voting practice, a
    court shall issue a preliminary injunction if the plaintiff
    shows a likelihood of success on the merits.

(b) BALANCE.—The public interest in protecting voting rights
    shall weigh heavily in favor of injunctive relief.

SEC. 7. ATTORNEY'S FEES.

A prevailing plaintiff in any action under this Act shall be
entitled to reasonable attorney's fees.

SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act takes effect 30 days after enactment.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Fifteenth Amendment**:

Congress has authority to enforce the Fifteenth Amendment prohibition on racial discrimination in voting. The John Lewis VRA is designed to satisfy *Shelby County*'s requirement of a coverage formula based on current conditions.

**Elections Clause**:

Congress has authority under Article I, Section 4 to regulate the "time, place, and manner" of federal elections, authorizing the Freedom to Vote Act provisions.

| Provision | Constitutional Basis |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Preclearance (new formula) | Fifteenth Amendment |
| Automatic registration | Elections Clause |
| Early voting requirements | Elections Clause |
| Vote by mail requirements | Elections Clause |
| Felon reenfranchisement | Elections Clause (federal elections) |

### Enforcement Mechanisms

| Law | Enforcement |
|-----|-------------|
| John Lewis VRA | DOJ, private right of action |
| Freedom to Vote Act | DOJ, private right of action, FEC |
| State laws | State attorneys general, private action |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

This section identifies potential weaknesses in the proposed legislation and provides mechanisms for addressing them.

### Right to Vote Amendment

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| "Orderly administration" exception | States may justify restrictive practices as administrative necessity | Critical |
| Eligibility verification breadth | Term could justify strict ID requirements or citizenship checks | High |
| Fraud prevention elasticity | Fraud prevention rationale used to justify restrictions with minimal evidence | High |
| Balancing test subjectivity | Courts may interpret "necessary" standard inconsistently | High |
| One-year delay | Full year before effect allows states to enact restrictions beforehand | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Amendment process difficulty | Requires 2/3 Congress + 3/4 states; unlikely to succeed | Constitutional structure |
| Doesn't address voter dilution | Right to vote doesn't guarantee meaningful representation | Scope limitation |
| Federal elections only unclear | May not extend to state/local elections | Drafting ambiguity |
| Incarcerated voting unclear | Section 3 exceptions may allow continued disenfranchisement | Balancing interests |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Administration standards**: Implement regulations defining "orderly administration" narrowly
2. **Eligibility verification limits**: Specify acceptable verification methods and prohibit burdensome requirements
3. **Fraud evidence requirements**: Require documented evidence of fraud before restrictions
4. **Judicial guidance**: Congressional findings should guide court interpretation of "necessary"
5. **State/local extension**: Include explicit language covering all public elections

### John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| 25-year lookback limitation | Jurisdictions may wait out violations to escape coverage | High |
| 10-year bailout period | Relatively short period for demonstrating reform | High |
| Consent decree exception | Jurisdictions may negotiate weak consent decrees to avoid coverage | Medium |
| 60-day response window | Delay may allow elections under challenged procedures | Medium |
| 180-day election proximity | Changes made 181 days before election escape heightened scrutiny | Medium |
| Attorney General discretion | Enforcement dependent on administration priorities | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Retrospective formula | Only covers jurisdictions with prior violations; new discriminators escape | Constitutional necessity |
| Shelby vulnerability | Same Court could strike down new formula on similar grounds | Judicial precedent |
| Limited nationwide scope | Most practices only precleared in covered jurisdictions | Political compromise |
| Private litigation burden | Private plaintiffs bear cost of bringing challenges | Resource constraints |
| State implementation discretion | Covered practices may be implemented in non-covered ways | Definitional limits |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Shorten lookback**: Consider 15-year lookback to capture more recent violations
2. **Extend bailout**: Increase to 15-year clean record for bailout
3. **Consent decree standards**: Establish minimum consent decree requirements for coverage
4. **Expedited response**: Reduce to 30-day response window with automatic preliminary hold
5. **Expand nationwide practices**: Add additional categories to Section 5 nationwide preclearance
6. **DOJ independence**: Create independent voting rights division with protected funding

### Freedom to Vote Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Voter ID sworn affidavit abuse | States may make affidavit process burdensome or intimidating | High |
| Early voting distribution | "Equitable access" undefined; allows concentration in favorable areas | High |
| Drop box "equitable" distribution | Term allows wide interpretation | Medium |
| Processing vs. counting | "Processing" mail ballots may not include counting, preserving delays | Medium |
| 30-minute wait enforcement | No clear remedy when wait times exceed limit | Medium |
| Postmark reliability | Postal service may not consistently postmark ballots | Medium |
| State implementation discretion | States may implement minimally while claiming compliance | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| State legislative opposition | Hostile states may resist implementation | Federalism |
| Funding dependency | $500 million may be insufficient for full implementation | Budget constraints |
| Federal elections only | State and local elections not covered | Constitutional limits |
| Enforcement delays | DOJ and court processes take time | Institutional capacity |
| Election administration complexity | Many new requirements may strain local officials | Implementation challenges |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Affidavit standards**: Specify affidavit form and prohibit intimidating processes
2. **Distribution formulas**: Establish per-capita or geographic distribution requirements for early voting and drop boxes
3. **Processing definition**: Clarify that processing includes preparation for immediate counting
4. **Wait time enforcement**: Create automatic remedies (additional polling places) when limits exceeded
5. **Postmark alternatives**: Allow receipt-date counting when postmark unavailable
6. **Implementation standards**: Create detailed regulatory requirements for compliance

### Native American Voting Rights Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| "Federally recognized" limitation | State-recognized tribes excluded | High |
| 25-mile distance | May still be burdensome in areas with poor transportation | Medium |
| Polling place request requirement | Requires tribal leadership action; may be slow or contested | Medium |
| Oral assistance limitations | Oral-only assistance may be inadequate for complex ballots | Medium |
| Consultation vs. consent | States must consult but need not obtain tribal agreement | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Tribal ID standards | Some tribal IDs may not meet state requirements despite acceptance mandate | Implementation gap |
| Language complexity | Many Native languages have multiple dialects; standardization difficult | Linguistic diversity |
| Infrastructure gaps | Even with polling places, transportation and communication barriers persist | Broader infrastructure issues |
| Enforcement resources | Tribes may lack resources to monitor and enforce rights | Capacity constraints |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Tribal recognition expansion**: Include state-recognized tribes meeting minimum criteria
2. **Distance reduction**: Consider 15-mile maximum in future amendments
3. **Automatic polling place requirement**: Require on-reservation polling without tribal request in jurisdictions over certain population
4. **Multi-modal assistance**: Require audio, video, and in-person assistance options
5. **Consent requirements**: For changes directly affecting tribal communities, require tribal consent

### Automatic Voter Registration Act (Model State)

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Opt-out prominence | Opt-out may be buried in forms, causing unintentional registration | Medium |
| Agency limitation | Only designated agencies participate; many eligible citizens not reached | Medium |
| Eligibility verification delay | Verification process may delay registration close to elections | Medium |
| Non-citizen registration risk | System errors may register ineligible individuals, creating legal jeopardy | Medium |
| Update accuracy | Address updates may not be timely or accurate | Low |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Non-interaction citizens | Citizens who don't interact with designated agencies remain unregistered | System design |
| Privacy concerns | Automatic data sharing raises privacy issues for some voters | Data integration |
| Implementation complexity | Connecting multiple agency databases is technically challenging | Infrastructure limitations |
| Political opposition | Opponents frame as coercive government overreach | Messaging battle |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Opt-out standards**: Require clear, prominent opt-out opportunity with explanation
2. **Agency expansion**: Add additional agencies (utilities, professional licensing) over time
3. **Expedited verification**: Require verification within 72 hours; provisional registration pending
4. **Non-citizen protections**: Robust eligibility checks with clear guidance against prosecution for system errors
5. **Privacy safeguards**: Limit data sharing to registration purposes only

### Vote at Home Act (Model State)

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Signature verification subjectivity | Signature matching is inconsistent and may disenfranchise voters | High |
| Ballot delivery failures | Postal service delays or address issues may prevent ballot receipt | Medium |
| Cure period adequacy | 7 days may be insufficient, especially if notification delayed | Medium |
| Drop box security | May be vandalized or removed without adequate oversight | Medium |
| Coercion risks | Vote at home may increase risk of family pressure or vote buying | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Digital divide | Online ballot request assumes internet access | Technology access gaps |
| Address instability | Unhoused or transient voters may not receive ballots | Population mobility |
| Postal service reliability | USPS capacity and funding concerns affect delivery | Infrastructure dependency |
| Voter preference | Some voters prefer in-person experience | Personal choice |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Signature verification standards**: Require multiple reviewers and benefit-of-doubt standards
2. **Ballot tracking**: Require ballot tracking with automatic replacement for non-delivery
3. **Extended cure period**: Allow cure up to certification date
4. **Drop box monitoring**: Require 24-hour video monitoring and regular collection
5. **Coercion protections**: Allow ballot replacement and create anonymous reporting mechanisms

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| Hostile state implementation | Strong federal enforcement with funding penalties |
| Voting rights retaliation | Strengthen retaliation protections for election workers and advocates |
| Misinformation about voting | Fund ongoing voter education programs |
| Judicial hostility | Strategic litigation and state court focus |
| Technology barriers | Mandate accessibility standards and funding |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

All provisions should include:

- **Biennial effectiveness review** assessing registration, turnout, and access improvements
- **Discrimination incident tracking** documenting new barriers and violations
- **Comparative state analysis** identifying best practices and implementation gaps
- **Stakeholder input requirements** ensuring affected communities inform reviews
- **Automatic strengthening triggers** when metrics show declining access or increased barriers
