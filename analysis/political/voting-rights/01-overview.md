# Voting Rights: Overview

## Executive Summary

The right to vote is the foundation of American democracy, yet it remains contested and constrained. From the founding, when only white property-owning men could vote, through the long struggle for universal suffrage, to today's battles over voter ID, registration, and access, voting rights have never been secure. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 represented a high-water mark in protecting the franchise, but the Supreme Court's gutting of key provisions has unleashed a new wave of voting restrictions.

Today, millions of Americans face unnecessary barriers to voting: strict ID requirements, limited early voting, purged voter rolls, closed polling places, and long lines. These restrictions fall disproportionately on communities of color, the poor, the elderly, students, and people with disabilities. What should be a simple civic act—casting a ballot—has become an obstacle course in many states.

Reform is both necessary and achievable. Automatic voter registration, expanded early voting, vote-by-mail, and restored federal protections can make voting more accessible for all Americans. The path forward requires federal legislation, state reforms, litigation, and sustained organizing to ensure that every eligible citizen can exercise the right to vote.

## The Core Problem

### The Franchise Under Attack

**Types of Restrictions**

| Restriction Type | How It Works | Who's Affected |
|-----------------|--------------|----------------|
| Strict voter ID | Requires specific forms of government ID | Poor, elderly, students, minorities |
| Voter roll purges | Removes voters for inactivity | Mobile populations, minorities |
| Polling place closures | Reduces number of voting locations | Rural, urban, minority communities |
| Limited early voting | Restricts days and hours | Working people, hourly workers |
| Restrictions on mail voting | Makes absentee voting harder | Elderly, disabled, rural |
| Felony disenfranchisement | Bars people with convictions | Disproportionately Black Americans |

**The Post-Shelby County Era**
After the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act's preclearance requirement in 2013:

- Previously covered states immediately passed new restrictions
- No federal review before discriminatory laws take effect
- Burden shifted to plaintiffs to challenge laws after implementation
- New wave of voting restrictions across the country

### By the Numbers

**Voter ID**

| Metric | Data |
|--------|------|
| States with strict photo ID | 15+ |
| Americans without required ID | 11%+ (21+ million) |
| Cost to obtain ID | $75-175 (total costs) |
| ID requirements disproportionately affect | Black, Latino, elderly, poor |

**Voter Roll Purges**

| Metric | Data |
|--------|------|
| Voters purged 2016-2018 | 17+ million |
| Purge rate increase post-Shelby | 40%+ in previously covered jurisdictions |
| Improper purges documented | Millions |

**Polling Place Closures**

| Metric | Data |
|--------|------|
| Closures in previously covered jurisdictions (2012-2018) | 1,688 |
| Average wait time increase | Significant in closed areas |
| Disproportionate impact | Minority communities |

**Felony Disenfranchisement**

| Metric | Data |
|--------|------|
| Americans disenfranchised | 4.6+ million |
| Black Americans disenfranchised | 1 in 16 |
| States with lifetime disenfranchisement | Several |

## Key Concepts

### Constitutional Foundation

**The Right to Vote**

- Constitution originally left voting qualifications to states
- No explicit right to vote in original text
- Expanded through amendments:
    - 15th: Race cannot be used to deny vote
    - 19th: Sex cannot be used to deny vote
    - 24th: Poll taxes banned in federal elections
    - 26th: Voting age lowered to 18

**Current Status**

- Voting still not affirmatively protected as fundamental right
- States have significant latitude in setting rules
- Federal protections depend on legislation and judicial interpretation

### Voting Rights Act

**What It Did**

- Section 2: Prohibited discriminatory voting practices nationwide
- Section 4: Coverage formula for preclearance jurisdictions
- Section 5: Preclearance requirement for covered jurisdictions
- Section 203: Language assistance requirements

**What Happened**

- *Shelby County v. Holder* (2013): Struck down coverage formula
- Preclearance effectively eliminated
- Section 2 remains but requires litigation
- New restrictions followed immediately

### Voter Suppression Tactics

**Historical Tactics**

| Tactic | Era | Status |
|--------|-----|--------|
| Poll taxes | 1890s-1964 | Banned (24th Amendment) |
| Literacy tests | 1890s-1965 | Banned (VRA) |
| Grandfather clauses | 1890s-1915 | Unconstitutional |
| White primaries | 1900s-1944 | Unconstitutional |
| Violence and intimidation | Ongoing | Illegal but not eliminated |

**Modern Tactics**

| Tactic | How It Works | Effect |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| Strict ID laws | Require specific documents | Disenfranchises those without ID |
| Voter roll purges | Remove voters for "inactivity" | Removes eligible voters |
| Polling place closures | Reduce voting locations | Creates long lines, discourages voting |
| Limited early voting | Restrict times to vote | Harder for working people |
| Restrictions on registration | Limit ways to register | Fewer registered voters |

### Felony Disenfranchisement

**The Problem**

- Millions barred from voting due to convictions
- Disproportionately affects Black Americans
- Rules vary dramatically by state
- Often continues after sentence served

**State Variation**

| Category | States | Rules |
|----------|--------|-------|
| No disenfranchisement | ME, VT | Can vote even while incarcerated |
| Ends after incarceration | Many states | Vote upon release |
| Ends after parole/probation | Many states | Must complete supervision |
| Requires restoration | Several states | Complex process to regain rights |
| Permanent | Some states | Lifetime ban for some offenses |

## Framework for Analysis

### Evaluating Restrictions

**Questions to Ask**

1. Does this restriction prevent eligible voters from voting?
2. Does it fall disproportionately on certain groups?
3. What legitimate purpose does it serve?
4. Are there less restrictive alternatives?
5. What is the actual evidence of the problem it addresses?

**The Burden-Benefit Test**

| Factor | Consider |
|--------|----------|
| **Burden on voters** | How hard is compliance? |
| **Disparate impact** | Who is disproportionately affected? |
| **State interest** | What purpose does restriction serve? |
| **Evidence** | Is there actual evidence of problem? |
| **Alternatives** | Could goal be achieved less restrictively? |

### The Voter Fraud Myth

**The Claim**

- Widespread voter fraud threatens election integrity
- Strict measures needed to prevent fraud
- ID laws, purges, restrictions are necessary

**The Reality**

| Type of Fraud | Documented Rate |
|---------------|-----------------|
| In-person voter impersonation | 0.00004%-0.0025% |
| Double voting | Extremely rare |
| Non-citizen voting | Extremely rare |
| Fraud changing election outcomes | Essentially zero |

**The Trade-off**

- Restrictions prevent far more legitimate votes than fraudulent ones
- Solutions in search of a problem
- Real purpose: partisan advantage and suppression

## Why This Matters

### For Democracy

When eligible citizens can't vote:

- Government lacks true consent of governed
- Policies don't reflect public preferences
- Democratic legitimacy is undermined
- Civic trust erodes

### For Equality

Voting restrictions perpetuate inequality:

- Historical discrimination continues in new forms
- Marginalized communities lose political voice
- Policy outcomes reflect those who can vote
- Inequality becomes self-reinforcing

### For Representation

When some can't vote:

- Representatives don't represent all constituents
- Policy favors participating voters
- Non-voters become invisible
- Democratic accountability weakens

### For Participation

Barriers discourage engagement:

- Complex rules confuse voters
- Fear of mistakes deters participation
- Young people get discouraged early
- Civic culture weakens
