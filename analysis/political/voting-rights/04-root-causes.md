# Voting Rights: Root Causes

## Constitutional and Legal Causes

### No Affirmative Right to Vote

**The Gap in the Constitution**

- Constitution doesn't explicitly guarantee right to vote
- Only says voting can't be denied for specific reasons (race, sex, age 18+, poll taxes)
- States retain broad authority over voting qualifications
- No constitutional floor for voting access

**What This Means**

- States can restrict voting in ways not specifically prohibited
- Voter ID, registration requirements, time/place limits are permissible
- Courts apply weak scrutiny to most voting regulations
- Reform requires either legislation or constitutional amendment

### Shelby County's Impact

**The Decision**

- Struck down VRA preclearance formula
- Removed federal oversight before changes take effect
- Shifted burden to plaintiffs to challenge after implementation
- Called conditions "40 years old" despite ongoing discrimination

**The Consequences**

| Before Shelby | After Shelby |
|---------------|--------------|
| DOJ reviewed changes before implementation | Changes take effect immediately |
| Discriminatory measures blocked preventively | Must be challenged in court after the fact |
| Burden on jurisdiction to prove non-discrimination | Burden on plaintiffs to prove discrimination |
| Deterrence effect | Green light for restrictions |

### Weakened Section 2

**Brnovich v. DNC (2021)**

- Made Section 2 challenges harder
- New "guideposts" favor states
- Strong history of voting restrictions not necessarily discriminatory
- Disparate impact harder to prove

**The Effect**

- Section 2 litigation more difficult
- Courts can dismiss challenges more easily
- States have more latitude for restrictions
- VRA further weakened

## Structural Causes

### Decentralized Election Administration

**The System**

- Elections run by ~10,000 local jurisdictions
- No uniform national standards
- Vast variation in practices
- Local officials make key decisions

**Problems This Creates**

| Issue | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Inconsistent practices | Different rules in different places |
| Uneven resources | Well-funded vs. under-resourced jurisdictions |
| Local discretion | Decisions can reflect local prejudices |
| Lack of accountability | Hard to identify responsible parties |

### Partisan Election Administration

**Conflicts of Interest**

- Secretaries of State are often partisan elected officials
- Party affiliation affects administration
- Election officials may run for other offices
- Administration decisions have partisan implications

**Examples**

- Georgia 2018: Secretary of State ran for Governor while overseeing election
- Ohio: Secretary of State made decisions benefiting own party
- Various states: Partisan officials make voter roll decisions

### Voter Registration Burden

**The American Anomaly**

- U.S. places registration burden on individual citizens
- Most democracies have government-initiated registration
- Registration is a barrier, not a formality
- Deadline gaps between registration and voting

**How This Creates Problems**

| Burden | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Must actively register | Millions never register |
| Must re-register after moves | Mobile populations fall off rolls |
| Deadlines weeks before election | Last-minute voters excluded |
| Complex rules | Confusion and errors |

### Single Election Day

**The Traditional Approach**

- Voting concentrated on one Tuesday
- Limited early voting in many states
- Mail voting restricted in some states
- Working hours conflict with voting hours

**Who This Harms**

| Group | Challenge |
|-------|-----------|
| Hourly workers | Can't take time off |
| Multiple job holders | Scheduling conflicts |
| Parents | Childcare responsibilities |
| Elderly/disabled | Long lines difficult |
| Rural voters | Distance to polls |

## Political Causes

### Partisan Incentives

**The Calculation**

- Restricting voting can benefit one party
- Lower turnout often benefits Republicans
- Higher turnout often benefits Democrats
- Party in power can shape electorate

**The Evidence**

| State | Party in Control | Restrictions | Likely Effect |
|-------|------------------|--------------|---------------|
| Georgia | R | ID laws, purges, limited early voting | Reduces D turnout |
| Texas | R | Strict ID, limited mail voting | Reduces D turnout |
| Florida | R | Felon disenfranchisement | Reduces D turnout |

### Incumbency Protection

**Safe Seats and Suppression**

- Incumbents benefit from lower turnout
- Predictable electorates easier to manage
- New voters are unpredictable
- Suppression protects incumbents of both parties

### Electoral College Effects

**Battleground vs. Safe States**

- National attention on few states
- Safe states ignored
- Different incentives in different states
- No national standard for access

## Economic Causes

### Resources and Administration

**Funding Disparities**

| Well-Funded Jurisdictions | Under-Resourced Jurisdictions |
|---------------------------|------------------------------|
| More polling places | Fewer polling places |
| Shorter lines | Longer lines |
| Modern equipment | Outdated equipment |
| Adequate staffing | Understaffing |

**Who Gets Resources**

- Wealthy suburbs often well-resourced
- Urban and rural areas often under-resourced
- Minority communities historically under-resourced
- Resource allocation can be discriminatory

### Cost of Voting

**Hidden Costs**

| Cost | Amount | Who Bears It |
|------|--------|--------------|
| ID documents | $50-175 (with underlying documents) | Poor voters |
| Transportation to DMV | Time + money | Carless voters |
| Time off work | Lost wages | Hourly workers |
| Time in line | Hours | Those in under-resourced precincts |

### Economic Inequality and Participation

**The Participation Gap**

- Wealthier voters more likely to vote
- Poor voters face more barriers
- Economic stress reduces political engagement
- Inequality in voting reinforces economic inequality

## Cultural and Psychological Causes

### Historical Legacy

**Ongoing Effects of Past Discrimination**

- Generational trauma from suppression
- Distrust of electoral system
- Cultural patterns of non-participation
- Internalized barriers

**Jim Crow's Long Shadow**

- Attitudes persist even after laws change
- Institutions still reflect past discrimination
- Communities affected for generations
- Recovery is slow

### Racial Resentment

**The Explicit Connection**

- Some restrictions explicitly target minority voters
- "Surgical precision" targeting (NC case)
- Dog-whistle messaging about "voter fraud"
- Racial resentment motivates some supporters

**The Pattern**

| Restriction | Target | Pretext |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| Student ID not accepted, gun license accepted | Young/liberal voters | "Government ID" |
| Sunday voting restrictions | Black church voters | "Election integrity" |
| Polling place closures in minority areas | Minority voters | "Budget" |

### Voter Fraud Myth

**The False Premise**

- Claims of widespread voter fraud are false
- In-person fraud essentially nonexistent
- Yet used to justify restrictions
- Belief persists despite evidence

**Why the Myth Persists**

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Political messaging | Repeated claims create belief |
| Media coverage | False balance in reporting |
| Confirmation bias | Anecdotes seem to confirm |
| Distrust of institutions | Suspicion of "the system" |

### Civic Culture

**Weak Civic Participation**

- Voting not deeply embedded in culture
- Civic education declining
- Political alienation widespread
- "My vote doesn't matter" belief

## Institutional Causes

### Supreme Court Decisions

**The Court's Role**

| Decision | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| *Crawford v. Marion County* (2008) | Upheld voter ID despite no fraud evidence |
| *Shelby County v. Holder* (2013) | Gutted VRA preclearance |
| *Brnovich v. DNC* (2021) | Weakened Section 2 |
| Various | Pattern of deference to states on restrictions |

### Congressional Inaction

**Federal Legislation Blocked**

- John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act: Blocked
- Freedom to Vote Act: Blocked
- For the People Act: Blocked
- All blocked by Senate filibuster

**Why Congress Fails to Act**

| Barrier | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Filibuster | 60 votes needed in Senate |
| Partisan divide | Republicans oppose federal standards |
| State power | Federalism concerns |
| Constitutional questions | Debate over Congress's authority |

### State Legislative Capture

**Gerrymandering's Role**

- Gerrymandered legislatures pass restrictions
- Safe seats insulate from accountability
- Extreme legislators elected from safe districts
- Restrictions make seats safer

**The Cycle**

```text

Gerrymandering → Safe seats → Extreme legislators → Voting restrictions →
Lower opposition turnout → More gerrymandering → ...

### The Self-Reinforcing System

1. **Legal weakness** enables restrictions
2. **Restrictions** reduce turnout of opposition voters
3. **Lower turnout** helps restriction-supporters win
4. **Winners** pass more restrictions
5. **Courts** defer to state decisions
6. **Congress** is blocked by beneficiaries
7. **Cycle** continues

### Breaking the Cycle

**Intervention Points**

| Cause | Intervention |
|-------|-------------|
| No constitutional right | Constitutional amendment (very difficult) |
| Shelby County | New federal legislation with updated formula |
| Partisan administration | Nonpartisan election administration |
| Registration burden | Automatic voter registration |
| Limited voting options | Universal vote-by-mail, early voting |
| Voter fraud myth | Public education, debunking |
