# Voting Rights: Solutions

## Guiding Principles

### Core Values

**Universal Access**

- Every eligible citizen should be able to vote easily
- Barriers should be minimized, not multiplied
- The default should be inclusion, not exclusion
- Government should facilitate voting, not obstruct it

**Equal Protection**

- No discriminatory impact on any group
- Historical discrimination must be remedied
- All voters treated equally
- No partisan manipulation of access

**Election Integrity**

- Security that doesn't sacrifice access
- Evidence-based rather than fear-based
- Transparency in administration
- Auditable results

### Criteria for Evaluating Solutions

| Criterion | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| Accessibility | Does it make voting easier? |
| Equity | Does it reduce disparate impacts? |
| Security | Does it protect election integrity? |
| Feasibility | Can it be implemented effectively? |
| Durability | Will it withstand legal/political challenges? |

## Policy Proposals

### Automatic Voter Registration (AVR)

**How It Works**

- Eligible citizens automatically registered through government interactions
- Driver's license, state ID, social services
- Opt-out rather than opt-in
- Registration updated automatically when information changes

**Benefits**

| Benefit | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Removes registration barrier | Millions more registered |
| Updates with address changes | Keeps rolls current |
| Reduces administrative errors | Government-initiated data |
| Increases turnout | 3-7% in states that adopted |

**Implementation Status**

- 23+ states + DC have adopted AVR
- Generally bipartisan support
- Works with existing systems
- Proven effective

### Same-Day Registration (SDR)

**How It Works**

- Citizens can register and vote on Election Day
- Usually requires proof of residence
- May use provisional ballot pending verification
- Eliminates deadline as barrier

**Benefits**

| Benefit | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Removes deadline barrier | Mobile voters can participate |
| Catches purged voters | Can re-register same day |
| Increases turnout | 3-7% increase in SDR states |
| Reduces provisional issues | Problems solved immediately |

**Implementation**

- Available in 21+ states + DC
- Some states have Election Day registration but not early voting SDR
- Can be combined with AVR

### Early Voting Expansion

**Best Practices**

| Feature | Standard |
|---------|----------|
| Duration | At least 14 days before Election Day |
| Hours | Include evenings and weekends |
| Locations | Accessible to all communities |
| Uniformity | Same options statewide |

**Benefits**

- Reduces Election Day crowding
- Accommodates work schedules
- Reduces wait times
- Increases overall turnout

### Vote-by-Mail Expansion

**Models**

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| All-mail elections | Every voter receives ballot automatically |
| No-excuse absentee | Any voter can request mail ballot |
| Excuse-required | Must have qualifying reason |

**Best Practices**

- Automatic mail ballot delivery (all-mail)
- Postage prepaid
- Signature cure process (notice before rejection)
- Ballot tracking
- Multiple drop-off options
- Extended receipt deadlines

**Implementation**

- Colorado, Oregon, Washington, others: all-mail
- ~35 states: no-excuse absentee
- Proven secure and effective

### VRA Restoration

**John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act**
Key Provisions:

- New coverage formula based on recent violations
- Preclearance restored for covered jurisdictions
- Enhanced DOJ enforcement
- Protection against known discriminatory practices

**Why It's Needed**

| Without VRA | With Restored VRA |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Restrictions take effect immediately | Must get federal approval |
| Burden on plaintiffs to challenge | Burden on states to justify |
| Litigation after elections affected | Prevention before implementation |
| No deterrent effect | Deterrence of bad actors |

### National Voting Standards

**Freedom to Vote Act Provisions**
Registration:

- Automatic voter registration nationwide
- Same-day registration requirement
- Online registration availability

Voting Access:

- Minimum 15 days early voting
- No-excuse mail voting

Protection:

- Limits on purges
- Voter protection hotlines
- Poll worker training requirements

### Felon Re-Enfranchisement

**Reform Options**

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Vote while incarcerated | ME, VT, DC model |
| Automatic upon release | Immediate restoration |
| Automatic after supervision | When parole/probation ends |
| Streamlined restoration | Easy application process |

**Florida Amendment 4 Model** (before restrictions)

- Automatic restoration for most felonies upon completion of sentence
- Passed with 65% support in 2018
- Would have restored rights to 1.4 million Floridians
- (Subsequently undermined by legislature requiring fines/fees)

## Structural Reforms

### Nonpartisan Election Administration

**The Problem**

- Partisan officials make election decisions
- Conflicts of interest
- Appearance of bias

**Solutions**

| Reform | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Nonpartisan Secretary of State | Remove party from office |
| Professional election directors | Career rather than political |
| Independent election boards | Bipartisan or nonpartisan |
| Standards for poll workers | Training requirements |

### Uniform Standards

**What Uniformity Provides**

**Key Standards**

| Area | Standard |
|------|----------|
| Registration | Same process statewide |
| ID requirements | Uniform (or none) |
| Polling place allocation | Per capita standards |
| Early voting | Minimum days/hours |

### Election Day as Holiday

**Options**

| Option | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| Federal holiday | Time off for many | Not all workers |
| Required time off | Direct access guarantee | Enforcement challenges |
| Weekend voting | No work conflict | Cultural shift |
| Extended hours | More flexibility | Resource intensive |

### Voting Rights Constitutional Amendment

**What It Could Provide**

- Affirmative right to vote
- Equal protection for voting
- Federal enforcement authority
- Protection against future restrictions

**The Challenge**

- Requires 2/3 of Congress + 3/4 of states
- Extremely difficult politically
- Long-term goal

## Alternative Approaches

### Free Universal ID

**If ID Required, Make It Free and Accessible**

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Free voter ID | Remove cost barrier |
| Mobile ID services | Reach underserved areas |
| Accept many forms | Student, tribal, etc. |
| Free underlying documents | Birth certificates, etc. |

### Ranked-Choice Voting

**How It Helps Access**

- Every vote matters more
- Less strategic voting pressure
- May increase participation
- See [Electoral Reform: Solutions](../electoral-reform/07-solutions.md)

### Compulsory Voting

**How It Works**

- Voting required by law
- Small penalties for non-compliance
- Turnout near 100%
- Used in Australia, others

**Trade-offs**

| Pros | Cons |
|------|------|
| Universal participation | Compulsion concerns |
| Politicians court all voters | Enforcement challenges |
| Eliminates suppression as strategy | Cultural resistance in US |

## Trade-offs

### Security vs. Access

**The False Dichotomy**

- Security and access aren't inherently in tension
- Restrictions often reduce security (fewer poll workers, longer lines)
- Access measures can enhance security (paper trails, verification)

**Real Security**

| Measure | Enhances Security | Affects Access |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| Paper ballots | Yes | Minimally |
| Audits | Yes | Not at all |
| Voter ID without free ID | Negligibly | Yes, negatively |
| Signature verification (strict) | Somewhat | Yes, negatively |

### Uniformity vs. Local Control

**The Tension**

- National standards ensure equality
- Local administration can be responsive
- Need balance of both

**Resolution**

- Set minimum standards federally
- Allow states/localities to exceed minimums
- Provide resources for compliance
- Monitor for disparities

### Immediate Access vs. Long-Term Reform

**Strategy Question**

- Fight each restrictive law individually?
- Push for comprehensive federal reform?
- State-by-state progress?

**Answer: All of the Above**

- Litigation to block immediate harms
- State reforms where possible
- Federal legislation for durable change
- Constitutional amendment as long-term goal

## Implementation Considerations

### Federal Reform Pathway

**Current Barriers**

- Senate filibuster (60 votes needed)
- Republican opposition to federal standards
- Conservative Supreme Court

**Overcoming Barriers**

| Barrier | Strategy |
|---------|----------|
| Filibuster | Carve-out or reform |
| Opposition | Build public pressure |
| Courts | Strong constitutional arguments |

### State Reform Pathway

**Priorities**

| State Category | Strategy |
|----------------|----------|
| Blue states | Adopt best practices |
| Swing states | Ballot initiatives where available |
| Red states | Defend against restrictions |

**Tools**

- Ballot initiatives
- Legislative advocacy
- Litigation
- Administrative advocacy
