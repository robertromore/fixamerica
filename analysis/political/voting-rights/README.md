# Voting Rights: Overview

The right to vote is the foundation of American democracy, yet it remains contested and constrained. From the founding, when only white property-owning men could vote, through the long struggle for universal suffrage, to today's battles over voter ID, registration, and access, voting rights have never been secure. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 represented a high-water mark in protecting the franchise, but the Supreme Court's gutting of key provisions has unleashed a new wave of voting restrictions.
