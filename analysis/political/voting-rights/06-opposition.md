| Honest Elections Project | Advocacy against mail voting |

**Their Strategy**

- Litigate against voter access
- Train state-level advocates

### "Election Integrity" Movement

**Organizations**

| Group | Focus |
|-------|-------|

| Election Integrity Project (Heritage) | Policy development |
| Various state groups | Local implementation |

**Tactics**

- Mass voter challenges

### Some Election Officials

**Partisan Secretaries of State**

- Make decisions favoring own party

**Local Officials**

- Polling place closures in minority areas
- Resource allocation favoring some areas
- Aggressive purge implementation
- Hostile poll workers

## Their Incentives

### Political Self-Interest

**Electoral Advantage**

| Restriction | Likely Beneficiary |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Strict voter ID | Republicans (reduces minority turnout) |
| Limited early voting | Republicans (reduces working-class turnout) |
| Felony disenfranchisement | Republicans (disparate impact on Black voters) |
| Polling place closures | Republicans (in minority areas) |

**Incumbency Protection**

- Lower turnout protects incumbents
- Predictable electorate is manageable
- New voters are unpredictable
- Status quo benefits those in power

### Ideological Commitments

**Beliefs Driving Opposition**

| Belief | Counter-Evidence |
|--------|------------------|
| Voter fraud is widespread | Studies find fraud rate near zero |
| Restrictions protect elections | No evidence restrictions prevent fraud |
| Voting should require effort | Contradicts democratic values |
| Only "qualified" should vote | Everyone is affected by government |

**Philosophical Framework**

- Small electorate is legitimate
- Voting is privilege, not right
- Property interests should be protected
- Democracy needs limits

### Donor Interests

**Who Funds Restriction Advocacy**

- Donors preferring lower taxes, less regulation
- Ideological funders
- Corporate interests benefiting from status quo
- Dark money networks

**The Connection**

- Restricted electorate elects restriction-supporters
- Restriction-supporters serve donor interests
- Donors fund restriction advocacy
- Cycle continues

## Their Tactics

### Legislative Tactics

**Passing Restrictive Laws**

| Tactic | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Omnibus bills | Georgia SB 202 included many provisions |
| Emergency session | Texas special sessions for SB 1 |
| Party-line votes | Minimal Democratic support |
| Override vetoes | Where possible |

**Pretext Development**

- Claim "election integrity" concerns
- Point to unsubstantiated fraud claims
- Assert need for "public confidence"
- Frame as nonpartisan good government

### Administrative Tactics

**Voter Roll Purges**

| Method | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Inactivity purges | Remove voters who haven't voted |
| Address challenges | Remove voters whose mail returns |
| Citizenship challenges | Remove voters without proof |
| Death/felon matching | Over-inclusive list matching |

**Polling Place Decisions**

- Close polling places in minority areas
- Reduce early voting sites
- Limit hours of operation
- Under-resource high-minority precincts

**Implementation Choices**

- Strict interpretation of ID requirements
- Aggressive signature matching
- Limited provisional ballot availability
- Inadequate language assistance

### Legal Tactics

**Offensive Litigation**

- Judicial Watch lawsuits demanding purges
- Challenges to election procedures
- Support for restrictive laws in court
- Strategic venue selection

**Defensive Litigation**

- Defend restrictive laws
- Appeal adverse rulings
- Delay implementation of court orders
- Narrow compliance with orders

### Messaging Tactics

**Voter Fraud Narrative**

- Amplify anecdotes (even debunked ones)
- Claim massive fraud without evidence
- Question election legitimacy
- Create false equivalence

**"Election Integrity" Framing**

- Position restrictions as protecting elections
- Present as nonpartisan good government
- Invoke public confidence
- Claim bipartisan support

**Victim Framing**

- Claim their voters are targeted by fraud
- Present restrictions as defensive
- Argue opponents want fraud
- Invert reality of suppression

## Their Messaging

### Core Arguments

**"Election Integrity"**

- "We must protect elections from fraud"
- "Secure elections require verification"
- "Public confidence requires restrictions"
- "Every illegal vote cancels a legal vote"

**Counter**: Fraud is extremely rare; restrictions prevent more legitimate votes than fraudulent ones.

**"Voter ID Is Common Sense"**

- "You need ID for everything"
- "Most voters have ID"
- "Other countries require ID"
- "What's the big deal?"

**Counter**: ID requirements have discriminatory effects; cost and access barriers are real; other countries have universal ID systems.

**"Both Sides" Equivalence**

- "Democrats want illegal immigrants to vote"
- "They're just upset they lost"
- "We're both protecting our voters"

**Counter**: Evidence of fraud is negligible; disparate impact is documented; motives differ.

**"States' Rights"**

- "Constitution gives states authority"
- "Federal overreach"
- "Local control is better"

**Counter**: Federal protection of rights is constitutional; states cannot violate rights; VRA worked.

### Specific Messaging Examples

**On Georgia SB 202**

- "Expand voter access" (talking point)
- Reality: Restricts drop boxes, limits absentee voting

**On Texas SB 1**

- "Secure elections"
- Reality: Banned drive-thru voting, restricted mail voting

**On Purges**

- "Clean voter rolls"
- Reality: Removes eligible voters

## Weaknesses

### The Evidence Problem

**No Fraud to Prevent**

| Type of Fraud | Documented Rate |
|---------------|-----------------|
| In-person impersonation | ~0.00004% |
| Double voting | Extremely rare |
| Non-citizen voting | Extremely rare |
| Fraud affecting outcomes | Essentially zero |

**The Vulnerability**

- Can't cite evidence for restrictions
- Studies repeatedly debunk fraud claims
- Solutions without problems
- Experts contradict their claims

### Public Opinion

**Americans Support Access**

| Position | Support |
|----------|---------|
| Make voting easier | 60%+ |
| Automatic voter registration | 60%+ |
| Same-day registration | 60%+ |
| Early voting expansion | 70%+ |
| Oppose voter ID without free ID | 50%+ |

**The Vulnerability**

- Must use misleading framing
- Can't openly advocate suppression
- Public rejects explicit restrictions
- Must rely on coded language

### Legal Vulnerability

**Ongoing Litigation**

- VRA Section 2 still viable
- State constitutional challenges
- Racial discrimination claims
- Documented evidence of targeting

**Risk of Court Losses**

- Some restrictions struck down
- Documentation of discriminatory intent
- Evidence of disparate impact
- Potential for precedent-setting losses

### Inconsistency

**Logical Problems**

| Claim | Contradiction |
|-------|---------------|
| "Fraud is widespread" | Then why so few prosecutions? |
| "ID prevents fraud" | ID wouldn't prevent alleged fraud types |
| "We want everyone to vote" | Then why restrict access? |
| "Nonpartisan concern" | Why party-line votes? |

## Counter-Strategies

### Messaging Responses

**Counter-Framing**

| Their Frame | Our Frame |
|-------------|-----------|
| "Election integrity" | "Voter suppression" |
| "Secure elections" | "Rigged elections" (against voters) |
| "Common sense" | "Discrimination" |
| "Public confidence" | "Manufactured distrust" |

**Positive Framing**

- Every citizen's voice should count
- Voting should be easy for everyone
- Democracy means everyone participates
- Freedom to vote is fundamental

### Evidence-Based Responses

**Debunking Fraud Claims**

- Cite studies showing fraud is rare
- Point to lack of prosecutions
- Document actual effect on legitimate voters
- Show who is really affected

- Legislative record showing intent
- Testimonials from affected voters

### Legal Strategies

**Litigation**

- Challenge restrictions under VRA Section 2
- State constitutional challenges
- Document discriminatory intent
- Build record for future cases

**Defensive Litigation**

- Defend voting access wins

- Seek injunctions before elections
- Appeal adverse rulings

### Political Strategies
