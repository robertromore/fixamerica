# Voting Rights: History

## Origins

### The Founding: Limited Suffrage

**Who Could Vote in 1789**

- White men only
- Property requirements in most states
- Religious requirements in some states
- Estimated 6% of population eligible
- States controlled all voting qualifications

**Constitutional Framework**

- Article I, Section 2: House elected by those who can vote for state legislature
- Article II: Electors choose president (not direct election)
- No affirmative right to vote in Constitution
- States determine voter qualifications

### Early Expansion (1790s-1850s)

**Removal of Property Requirements**

| Period | Change |
|--------|--------|
| 1790s-1820s | Many states eliminate property requirements |
| 1830s | Most white male citizens can vote |
| 1850s | Near-universal white male suffrage |

**Notable Exclusions**

- Women: Excluded in all states
- Free Black men: Excluded in most states (some Northeast exceptions)
- Native Americans: Not citizens, cannot vote
- Non-citizens: Some states allowed immigrant voting

## Key Turning Points

### Post-Civil War Amendments

**15th Amendment (1870)**
The Text:
> "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude."

**Initial Effect**

- Black men gained legal right to vote
- Reconstruction saw Black political participation surge
- Black representatives elected to Congress
- Southern states had significant Black electorates

**The Promise Betrayed**

- Reconstruction ended (1877)
- Federal troops withdrew
- White supremacist violence intensified
- New suppression tactics developed

### The Jim Crow Era (1877-1965)

**Suppression Tactics**

| Tactic | How It Worked | Effect |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| **Poll taxes** | Required payment to vote | Excluded poor Black (and white) voters |
| **Literacy tests** | Required reading/interpretation | Applied selectively to deny Black voters |
| **Grandfather clauses** | Exempted descendants of pre-war voters | Protected white illiterate voters |
| **White primaries** | Excluded Blacks from Democratic primaries | Effectively denied vote in one-party South |
| **Violence** | Intimidation, lynching, terrorism | Terror kept Black voters home |
| **Complex registration** | Difficult procedures | Barriers to registration |

**The Results**

| State | Black Registration 1867 | Black Registration 1940 |
|-------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Louisiana | 95%+ | 0.5% |
| Mississippi | 67%+ | 0.4% |
| Alabama | High | 1.5% |
| Georgia | High | 2% |

### Women's Suffrage

**The Long Campaign**

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1848 | Seneca Falls Declaration |
| 1869 | Wyoming Territory grants women vote |
| 1890 | National American Woman Suffrage Association formed |
| 1910s | More states grant women's suffrage |
| 1920 | **19th Amendment ratified** |

**The 19th Amendment**

> "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex."

**Limitations**

- Black women still subject to Jim Crow in South
- Native American women not citizens until 1924
- Asian immigrant women excluded until later
- Full effect uneven across country

### The Voting Rights Act of 1965

**Context: The Civil Rights Movement**

| Year | Event |
|------|-------|
| 1954 | Brown v. Board of Education |
| 1955-56 | Montgomery Bus Boycott |
| 1960 | Sit-ins begin |
| 1963 | March on Washington |
| 1964 | Civil Rights Act |
| 1965 | Selma, Bloody Sunday |
| 1965 | **Voting Rights Act** |

**The Selma Catalyst**

- Marchers attacked on Edmund Pettus Bridge
- "Bloody Sunday" televised nationally
- Public outrage demanded action
- President Johnson addressed Congress
- VRA passed within months

**What the VRA Did**

| Section | Provision | Effect |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Section 2 | Ban on discriminatory practices | Nationwide protection |
| Section 4 | Coverage formula | Identified jurisdictions with history of discrimination |
| Section 5 | Preclearance | Covered jurisdictions must get approval before changes |
| Section 203 | Language assistance | Ballots in multiple languages where needed |

**The Transformation**

| Metric | 1964 | 1968 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Black registration in Mississippi | 7% | 59% | +52 points |
| Black registration in Alabama | 23% | 57% | +34 points |
| Black registration in South | 31% | 62% | +31 points |

### Constitutional Amendments

**24th Amendment (1964)**

- Banned poll taxes in federal elections
- Eliminated one major Jim Crow tool
- States could still use for state elections until *Harper v. Virginia* (1966)

**26th Amendment (1971)**

- Lowered voting age to 18
- Response to Vietnam War ("old enough to fight, old enough to vote")
- Added millions of young voters

## Key Court Decisions

### The Reapportionment Revolution

**Baker v. Carr (1962)**

- Courts can hear redistricting challenges
- Opened courthouse doors to voting cases

**Reynolds v. Sims (1964)**

- "One person, one vote" required for state legislatures
- Equal population in districts
- See [Redistricting: History](../redistricting/03-history.md)

### Voting Rights Cases

**Harper v. Virginia (1966)**

- Poll taxes unconstitutional in all elections
- "Wealth or fee-paying has no relation to voting qualifications"

**South Carolina v. Katzenbach (1966)**

- Upheld Voting Rights Act
- Congress has broad power under 15th Amendment
- Preclearance constitutional

**Mobile v. Bolden (1980)**

- Required proof of discriminatory intent, not just effect
- Made Section 2 cases harder
- Led to 1982 VRA amendments

**1982 VRA Amendments**

- Restored "results" test for Section 2
- Discriminatory effect sufficient
- No need to prove intent
- Strengthened minority voting rights

### The Gutting of the VRA

**Shelby County v. Holder (2013)**
The Decision:

- Struck down Section 4 (coverage formula)
- Called it based on "40-year-old facts"
- Made Section 5 preclearance unenforceable
- 5-4 decision along ideological lines

Chief Justice Roberts:
> "Our country has changed."

Justice Ginsburg's Dissent:
> "Throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet."

**Immediate Effect**

- Texas strict voter ID law took effect within hours
- North Carolina passed sweeping restrictions within months
- Previously blocked measures implemented
- New wave of restrictions began

**Brnovich v. DNC (2021)**

- Made Section 2 challenges harder
- New "guideposts" favor states
- Further weakened VRA
- 6-3 decision

## Lessons from History

### Lesson 1: Progress Is Not Permanent

- 15th Amendment promised voting rights in 1870
- Jim Crow eliminated Black voting by 1900
- VRA restored rights in 1965
- Shelby County enabled new restrictions in 2013
- Constant vigilance required

### Lesson 2: Methods Change, Goals Don't

| Era | Suppression Methods |
|-----|---------------------|
| 1870s-1960s | Violence, poll taxes, literacy tests |
| 1960s-2013 | Preclearance prevented new tactics |
| 2013-present | Voter ID, purges, polling place closures |

The goal—preventing certain groups from voting—remains; only tactics change.

### Lesson 3: Federal Protection Is Essential

- States cannot be trusted to protect voting rights alone
- Federal intervention necessary after Civil War
- Federal intervention necessary in 1960s
- Federal legislation blocked today
- History shows state-level variation perpetuates inequality

### Lesson 4: Courts Both Protect and Threaten

**Courts as Protectors**

- Smith v. Allwright ended white primaries
- Harper ended poll taxes
- South Carolina v. Katzenbach upheld VRA

**Courts as Threats**

- Shelby County gutted VRA
- Brnovich weakened Section 2
- Crawford upheld voter ID

Court composition matters enormously.

### Lesson 5: Social Movements Create Change

- Suffrage movement won 19th Amendment
- Civil Rights Movement won VRA
- Grassroots organizing essential
- Legal and political strategies must combine
- Public pressure is necessary

### Lesson 6: Backlash Follows Progress

| Progress | Backlash |
|----------|----------|
| 15th Amendment | Jim Crow |
| Voting Rights Act | Modern restrictions |
| 2008 Obama election | Tea Party, voter restrictions |
| 2020 high turnout | 2021 wave of restrictions |

Expect counter-mobilization after voting rights victories.
