# Voting Rights: Current State

## The Problem Today

### The Post-Shelby Landscape

Since the Supreme Court's 2013 decision in *Shelby County v. Holder* gutted the Voting Rights Act's preclearance requirement, states have enacted hundreds of new voting restrictions. What was once subject to federal review before implementation now takes effect immediately, requiring litigation after the fact—often after elections have already been affected.

**The Wave of Restrictions**
Following Shelby County:

- Texas implemented strict photo ID within hours of the ruling
- North Carolina passed sweeping voting restrictions within months
- States previously covered by preclearance moved quickly
- Previously blocked measures took immediate effect
- New restrictions continue to be enacted each legislative session

| Early voting | Reduced in many states |
