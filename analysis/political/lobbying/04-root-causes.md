| Freedom of association | Organizing for influence protected |
| Press freedom | Propaganda protected |

**Implications**

- Outright bans unconstitutional
- Regulations must be content-neutral
- Disclosure only remedy
- Money as speech complicates limits

### Institutional Design

**Congressional Structure**

| Feature | Lobbying Effect |
|---------|-----------------|
| Fragmented power | Multiple access points |
| Committee system | Specialized targets |
| Bicameralism | Need to lobby both chambers |

| Complexity | Expertise valuable |

**Executive Branch**

| Feature | Lobbying Effect |
|---------|-----------------|
| Regulatory agencies | Rulemaking lobbying |
| Political appointees | Access through appointments |
| Discretionary authority | Enforcement lobbying |
