# Lobbying Reform: Overview

Lobbying—the practice of attempting to influence government decisions—is constitutionally protected but has become deeply problematic in practice. The lobbying industry has grown from $1.45 billion in 1998 to over $4 billion annually, with lobbyists outnumbering members of Congress by more than 20 to 1. This imbalance gives wealthy special interests disproportionate influence over policy while ordinary citizens struggle to have their voices heard.
