### Messaging Tactics

| Reform | Frame |
|--------|-------|
| Disclosure expansion | "Government overreach" |
| Revolving door limits | "Career restriction" |

| Public financing | "Taxpayer-funded campaigns" |

**False Equivalence**

- "Everyone lobbies"
- "Public interest groups too"
- "Unions are just as bad"
- "Information is neutral"

## Their Messaging

**"Lobbying Is Constitutional"**

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| First Amendment protects all lobbying | Regulations for disclosure constitutional |
| Can't restrict petition right | Registration not restriction |
| Free speech includes influence | Transparency doesn't limit speech |

**"Lobbyists Provide Expertise"**

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| Congress needs information | Information is biased |

| Lobbyists serve educational function | Education serves interests |

**"Current Rules Are Sufficient"**

| Claim | Reality |

| Already have disclosure | Massive loopholes |
| Ethics rules exist | Rarely enforced |
| Transparency requirements | Easily avoided |

**"Reform Would Have Unintended Consequences"**

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|

### Specific Messaging

**On Registration Expansion**

| Argument | Counter |
|----------|---------|
| "Too broad" | Targeted definitions possible |
