# Political Reform: Stakeholders

## Who Benefits from the Status Quo

### The Major Parties

### Key Dynamics

**Party vs. Voters**

- Party interests often diverge from voter interests
- Voters want compromise; parties want victory
- Voters want solutions; parties want issues
- Primary system gives party base control

**Donors vs. Public**

- Donor preferences systematically differ from public preferences
- Donors get policy; public gets rhetoric
- Access and influence purchased, not earned
- Creates "electorate" of donors that matters more than voters

**Reform vs. Industry**

- Billions of dollars at stake in political industry
- Every reform threatens someone's business model
- Status quo has resources; reform has passion
- Asymmetric fight unless reform can scale resources

### Coalition-Building Opportunities

**Anti-Corruption Frame**

- Unites populists left and right
- Focuses on process, not partisan outcomes
- Allows diverse coalitions
- Successfully used in ballot initiatives

**State-by-State Strategy**

- Different states have different opportunities
- Red states, blue states, and purple states all potential targets
- Local coalitions can be tailored to context
- Success creates demonstration effects

**Business Engagement**

- Frame reform as reducing uncertainty
- Focus on long-term stability and planning
- Some industries more persuadable than others
- Need corporate voices for credibility
