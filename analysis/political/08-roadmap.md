- Connect with existing reform organizations (FairVote, RepresentUs, etc.)
- Identify cross-partisan allies (frustrated voters on left and right)
- Engage local civic groups, business leaders, former politicians
- Build relationships with reform-minded journalists and academics

**1.3 State Assessment**

- Assess political conditions in target states
- Prioritize states where reform is winnable

**1.4 Resource Development**

## Phase 2: Short-Term Goals (1-2 Years)

### Electoral Reform Campaigns

**2.1 Ranked-Choice Voting Expansion**

| Target Type | Strategy |
|-------------|----------|
| Ballot initiative states | Launch signature campaigns |
| Legislative states | Build coalitions for bills |
| Cities | Win municipal adoption |
| Party primaries | Adopt for internal elections |

**Priority States for RCV**

- Nevada (ballot initiative pending)
- Oregon (strong reform movement)
- Colorado (purple state, initiative available)
- Wisconsin (if court/legislative conditions change)

**2.2 Independent Redistricting**

**Before 2030 Redistricting Cycle**

- Pass redistricting reform in 5+ additional states
- Ballot initiatives where available
- Pressure legislatures elsewhere
- Prepare for 2030 Census and redistricting

**Target States**

- Texas (long shot but high impact)
- Florida (ballot initiative possible)
- Pennsylvania (critical swing state)

**2.3 Open Primary Expansion**

- Build on Alaska's success
- Target states with large independent populations
- Combine with RCV for maximum effect
- Nevada, Florida, and other high-independent states

### Campaign Finance Progress

**2.4 Small-Dollar Matching Programs**

- Support Seattle-style democracy voucher programs
- Push for small-dollar matching in major cities
- Document results to build case for expansion

**2.5 Disclosure Requirements**

- State legislation requiring disclosure of political spending
- Model bills for dark money transparency
- Real-time reporting requirements

### Building Infrastructure
