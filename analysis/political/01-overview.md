# Political Reform: Overview

## Executive Summary

American democracy is experiencing a systemic crisis. The political system designed to represent citizens and solve collective problems has become captured by wealthy donors, entrenched party interests, and institutional inertia. The result is a government that is increasingly unresponsive to the will of the majority, incapable of addressing long-term challenges, and actively exacerbating polarization and distrust.

This is not a partisan issue—it affects Americans across the political spectrum who feel unheard, unrepresented, and frustrated with a system that seems to work for everyone except ordinary citizens.

Political reform is the foundational issue in the FixAmerica project because a dysfunctional political system cannot solve problems in healthcare, education, climate, or any other domain. Fixing the machine that makes decisions is prerequisite to making better decisions.

## Scope

### What This Topic Covers

- **Electoral systems**: How we vote, who can vote, how votes are counted, and how representatives are chosen
- **Campaign finance**: How campaigns are funded and how money influences politics
- **Party structures**: How the two major parties maintain power and suppress competition
- **Gerrymandering**: How district boundaries are drawn to predetermine outcomes
- **Lobbying and influence**: How special interests shape legislation
- **Congressional dysfunction**: Why Congress fails to pass legislation or address major issues
- **Civic engagement**: Voter participation, political knowledge, and democratic culture
- **Media and information**: How the political information environment shapes democracy

### What This Topic Does Not Cover

- Specific policy outcomes (those belong in their respective topic folders)
- Criminal justice and policing (covered in Justice)
- International democracy and foreign policy (covered in Defense)

## Key Questions

1. **Why has American democracy become so dysfunctional?** What structural, economic, and cultural factors have created the current crisis?

2. **Who benefits from the status quo?** What interests are served by maintaining current systems, and how do they protect their advantages?

3. **What reforms would create a more representative, responsive democracy?** What specific changes to electoral systems, campaign finance, and governance structures would help?

4. **How can reforms succeed against entrenched opposition?** What strategies, coalitions, and pathways can overcome the resistance of those who benefit from dysfunction?

5. **What has worked elsewhere?** What can we learn from other democracies, from American history, and from successful state-level reforms?

## Why This Matters

The consequences of political dysfunction extend far beyond politics:

- **Policy paralysis**: Critical issues (climate, debt, healthcare, infrastructure) go unaddressed for decades
- **Declining trust**: Only 20% of Americans trust the federal government to do what is right most of the time
- **Polarization**: Americans increasingly view the other party as enemies rather than fellow citizens
- **Wealth capture**: Policies increasingly favor wealthy donors over median voters
- **Democratic backsliding**: Norms, institutions, and practices that sustain democracy are eroding

The stakes are existential. Without a functioning democracy, there is no mechanism for peaceful resolution of conflicts, no accountability for those in power, and no way to course-correct when policies fail.

## The Opportunity

Despite the challenges, there is reason for hope:

- **Cross-partisan frustration**: Majorities of both Republicans and Democrats support reforms like ending gerrymandering and reducing money in politics
- **State-level momentum**: States like Alaska, Maine, and California have implemented ranked-choice voting, independent redistricting, and other reforms
- **Generational shift**: Younger Americans are less attached to the two-party system and more open to structural change
- **Technology**: New tools for organizing, communicating, and building coalitions
- **Crisis as catalyst**: Growing dysfunction may create the conditions for transformative reform

The question is whether reformers can build the coalitions, strategies, and political will necessary to overcome entrenched resistance before the system deteriorates further.
