# Electoral College: Roadmap

## Strategic Considerations

### The Central Challenge

Electoral College reform faces a fundamental obstacle: those who benefit from the current system control the veto points for change.

**Key Dynamics**:

- Small states can block constitutional amendments
- Republican Party benefits from current structure
- Reform requires action by potential losers
- Courts may be hostile to NPV

### Available Paths

| Path | Requirements | Probability |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| NPV Compact | 270 EVs worth of states | Moderate |
| Constitutional Amendment | 2/3 Congress + 3/4 states | Very Low |
| Supreme Court decision | Case + favorable ruling | Unpredictable |
| Shift in partisan calculus | Party realignment | Uncertain |

### Strategy: NPV First, Amendment Later

1. Achieve NPV compact activation
2. Demonstrate successful operation
3. Build public support through experience
4. Pursue constitutional amendment when conditions allow

## Phase 1: Build to 270 (Current - Year 5)

### Current Position (latest public update: end of 2024)

**Secured**: 209 electoral votes (17 states + DC). *Source: National Popular Vote Inc., status update dated Dec. 2024.*

**Needed**: 61 more electoral votes

**Recent additions (2023-2024)**: Minnesota (2023), Maine (2024).

### Priority States for NPV (next 60+ EVs)

**Tier 1 - Most Viable** (30 EVs):

| State | EVs | Status | Path |
|-------|-----|--------|------|
| Virginia | 13 | Prior legislative movement | Reassess after each statewide election |
| Pennsylvania | 19 | Prior legislative movement | Senate pathway + public pressure |
| Michigan | 15 | Active in recent sessions | Legislative push or ballot initiative |
| Nevada | 6 | Prior passage + veto history | Legislative push or ballot initiative |

**Tier 2 - Challenging but Possible** (40+ EVs):

| State | EVs | Status | Path |
|-------|-----|--------|------|
| Arizona | 11 | Active in recent sessions | Ballot initiative possible |
| North Carolina | 16 | Limited movement | Requires political shift |
| Wisconsin | 10 | Limited movement | Legislative shift needed |

**Tier 3 - Long Shot** (30+ EVs):

| State | EVs | Status | Path |
|-------|-----|--------|------|
| Georgia | 16 | Minimal movement | Requires major political change |
| Florida | 30 | Minimal movement | Requires major political change |

### State-Level Campaigns

**Virginia Campaign**:

- Build bipartisan legislative coalition
- Emphasize voter equality in safe states
- Reassess feasibility after each statewide election cycle

**Pennsylvania Campaign**:

- Focus on Senate pathway and bipartisan cover
- Pair public pressure with business/civic validators
- Keep House support consolidated

**Michigan Campaign**:

- Maintain legislative push
- Develop ballot initiative backup
- Track gubernatorial stance and legislative margins

### Coalition Building

**Bipartisan Outreach**:

- California Republicans (votes don't count now)
- Texas Democrats (same)
- Reform-minded Republicans (democratic legitimacy)
- Former Republican officials who've endorsed

**Stakeholder Engagement**:

- Business community (predictability, legitimacy)
- Civic organizations (democracy values)
- Academic institutions (research, education)
- Media (editorial support)

**Messaging**:

| Audience | Message |
|----------|---------|
| Safe state voters | "Your vote should count equally" |
| Republicans | "Expand the map; compete everywhere" |
| Small states | "You're ignored now; NPV makes every vote matter" |
| General | "The person with the most votes should win" |

## Phase 2: Legal Defense Preparation (Ongoing)

### Anticipated Challenges

**Compact Clause Challenge**:

- Argument: NPV requires congressional consent
- Counter: Only compacts affecting federal supremacy need consent
- Precedent: Many interstate compacts operate without consent

**Article II Challenge**:

- Argument: States must choose electors based on state's voters
- Counter: States determine method; no restriction on criteria
- Precedent: *Chiafalo v. Washington* (2020) supports state authority

**Equal Protection Challenge**:

- Argument: Different state voting rules create unequal treatment
- Counter: Current system has same variation
- Precedent: No constitutional requirement for uniform state rules

### Legal Team Preparation

**Before Activation**:

- Retain experienced constitutional litigators
- Prepare briefs and arguments
- Identify favorable jurisdictions
- Build academic support (amicus briefs)

**Litigation Strategy**:

- Seek dismissal on standing grounds if possible
- Prepare for Supreme Court review
- Media and public education campaign
- Political pressure on Court legitimacy

## Phase 3: NPV Activation (Year 5-8)

### Activation Process

When states totaling 270+ electoral votes join:

1. **Certification**: Compact administrator certifies activation
2. **Implementation**: Member states prepare for next presidential election
3. **Public education**: Explain how new system works
4. **Legal defense**: Respond to anticipated challenges

### First Election Under NPV

**Preparation**:

- Coordinate certification timelines across states
- Establish national popular vote tabulation process
- Prepare for recount procedures if close
- Media campaign explaining system

**Potential Issues**:

- State withdrawal attempts
- Court injunctions
- Certification disputes
- Public confusion

**Contingency Planning**:

- Legal team ready for emergency motions
- Public communications strategy
- Political pressure on potential defectors
- Clear procedures for disputes

## Phase 4: Consolidation (Year 8-12)

### Post-First Election

**If NPV Works Smoothly**:

- Document success
- Add more states to compact
- Build public support for permanence
- Begin constitutional amendment campaign

**If Challenged Successfully**:

- Appeal through courts
- Political pressure campaign
- Congressional action on compact consent
- Pivot to constitutional amendment push

### Building Toward Amendment

**Conditions for Amendment Success**:

- Demonstrated NPV success
- Shift in partisan calculus
- Public demand for permanence
- Political alignment in Congress

**Amendment Campaign**:

- Draft amendment text
- Introduce in Congress
- State resolution campaigns
- Long-term public education

## Phase 5: Constitutional Amendment (Year 12+)

### When to Pursue

Amendment becomes viable when:

- NPV has operated successfully
- Public support exceeds 70%
- Some Republican support emerges
- Political window opens

### Amendment Process

1. **Congressional passage**: 2/3 of both chambers
2. **State ratification**: 3/4 of state legislatures (38 states)
3. **Timeline**: Typically 2-7 years once Congress passes

### Amendment Strategy

**Build from NPV Success**:

- Point to successful elections
- Demonstrate no adverse effects
- Show public support growth
- Counter opposition arguments with experience

**Address Small State Concerns**:

- Emphasize that small states were ignored under old system
- Show attention to all voters under NPV
- Possibly include provisions for small states (runoff threshold)

## Risk Assessment

### Political Risks

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Insufficient states join NPV | Moderate | Continued state-by-state campaigns |
| States withdraw before election | Low | Withdrawal timing restrictions |
| Political backlash | Moderate | Bipartisan coalition building |
| Partisan opposition hardens | High | Focus on democratic legitimacy |

### Legal Risks

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Supreme Court strikes down NPV | Moderate | Strong legal team, public pressure |
| State courts block implementation | Low | Choice of law provisions |
| Injunction delays activation | Moderate | Expedited appeals, early filing |

### Implementation Risks

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Vote counting disputes | Low | Clear procedures, certification timelines |
| Faithless electors in member states | Very Low | Elector pledge enforcement |
| Public confusion | Moderate | Extensive education campaign |

## Metrics for Success

- States actively considering: 10+
- Public support: 65%+
