# Electoral College: Solutions

## Framework for Reform

Effective Electoral College reform must:

1. **Ensure democratic legitimacy** by aligning outcomes with popular will
2. **Work within constitutional constraints** or achieve amendment
3. **Build sufficient political support** across partisan lines
4. **Survive legal challenges** in courts
5. **Maintain election integrity** and public confidence

## National Popular Vote Interstate Compact

### Problem

The Electoral College can elect presidents who lose the popular vote, as happened in 2000 and 2016.

### Solution: Interstate Compact

**How It Works**:

- States agree to award their electoral votes to the national popular vote winner
- Compact activates when states totaling 270+ electoral votes join
- Effectively creates national popular vote without constitutional amendment
- Uses states' existing constitutional authority over elector selection

**Current Status** (2024 snapshot, post-2020 apportionment):

| Category | Count |
|----------|-------|
| States + DC enacted | 17 + DC |
| Electoral votes secured | 209 |
| Electoral votes needed | 61 |
| States passed one chamber | 6 (~50 EVs) |

*Source: National Popular Vote Inc., Dec. 2024 update.*

**Benefits**:

- No constitutional amendment required
- Can be achieved state-by-state
- Reversible (with timing restrictions)
- Preserves state role in elections

**Challenges**:

- Requires states totaling 270 EVs
- Constitutional challenges likely
- Withdrawal risk during crisis
- Need some purple/red states

### Path to 270

**Priority States**:

| State | EVs | Status | Strategy |
|-------|-----|--------|----------|
| Virginia | 13 | Prior legislative movement | Legislative campaign |
| Pennsylvania | 19 | Prior legislative movement | Senate pathway + public pressure |
| Michigan | 15 | Active in recent sessions | Legislative or ballot initiative |
| Arizona | 11 | Active in recent sessions | Ballot initiative option |
| Nevada | 6 | Prior passage + veto history | Legislative or ballot initiative |
| Wisconsin | 10 | Limited movement | Legislative campaign |

**Coalition Building**:

- Bipartisan outreach (some Republicans support)
- Business community engagement
- Focus on ignored voter messaging
- State-specific campaigns

## Constitutional Amendment

### Problem

The Electoral College is constitutionally entrenched. The NPV compact may face legal challenges.

### Solution: Direct Election Amendment

**Draft Amendment**:

```text
Section 1. The President and Vice President shall be elected
by direct vote of the people of the United States.

Section 2. The persons having the greatest number of votes for
President and Vice President shall be elected, provided such
persons receive at least forty percent of the votes cast.

Section 3. If no persons receive forty percent of the votes cast,
a runoff election shall be held within thirty days between the
two candidates receiving the most votes for President and the
two candidates receiving the most votes for Vice President.

Section 4. The times, places, and manner of holding such elections
and the inclusion of names of candidates on the ballot shall be
determined by Congress.

Section 5. Congress shall have the power to enforce this article
by appropriate legislation.

Section 6. This article shall take effect for the first
presidential election occurring more than two years after
ratification.
```

**Explanation**:

- Section 1: Direct popular vote
- Section 2: 40% threshold to win outright
- Section 3: Runoff if no candidate reaches 40%
- Section 4: Federal election administration authority
- Section 5: Congressional enforcement power
- Section 6: Transition time

**Challenges**:

- Requires 2/3 of Congress and 3/4 of states
- 13 small states can block
- Partisan opposition likely
- Historical near-miss (1970)

**Long-Term Strategy**:

- Build public support through education
- Demonstrate NPV success first
- Wait for political alignment
- Multi-decade commitment

## Proportional Allocation

### Problem

Winner-take-all distorts outcomes and concentrates campaigns in battleground states.

### Solution: Proportional Electoral Votes

**How It Would Work**:

- Electoral votes allocated proportionally to vote share
- Example: California 54 EVs, 60% Dem / 40% Rep = 32 Dem / 22 Rep
- Could use various rounding methods
- Could include threshold (e.g., 5% minimum to receive EVs)

**Benefits**:

- Every state becomes competitive
- All votes matter
- More accurately reflects voter preferences
- Preserves state-based system

**Challenges**:

- Only works if all states adopt (otherwise adopting state loses influence)
- Requires simultaneous national adoption
- Third parties could prevent majorities
- More likely to trigger contingent elections

**Implementation Options**:

| Method | Description | Effect |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Pure proportional | Exact proportion | Most accurate, complex |
| Rounded proportional | Round to nearest whole EV | Simpler, less precise |
| Threshold proportional | 5% minimum to receive EVs | Limits fragmentation |
| Hybrid | Proportional with 2 "bonus" EVs to winner | Preserves some winner advantage |

**Why It Hasn't Happened**:

- Game theory: Unilateral adoption disadvantages the state
- Requires federal mandate or universal agreement
- No mechanism to enforce simultaneous adoption
- Constitutional amendment may be required for mandate

## District Method Expansion

### Problem

Winner-take-all ignores internal state diversity.

### Solution: Congressional District Allocation

**How It Works** (Maine/Nebraska model):

- 2 electoral votes to statewide winner
- 1 electoral vote per congressional district to district winner
- Allows split electoral votes within states

**Current Use**:

- Maine (since 1972): 4 EVs
- Nebraska (since 1991): 5 EVs
- Recent splits: 2008, 2016, 2020

**Benefits**:

- Reflects geographic diversity within states
- More competitive districts = more engagement
- Doesn't require constitutional change
- Preserves state administration

**Serious Problems**:

- Interacts with gerrymandering
- Could entrench partisan advantage
- 2012 simulation: Romney would have won despite Obama's 5M vote margin
- Creates incentive to gerrymander presidential elections

**Why Not Recommended**:

- District method + gerrymandering = worse than current system
- Would require independent redistricting first
- Advantages party that controls state legislatures
- Not a genuine reform toward democratic legitimacy

## Instant Runoff for Electoral College

### Problem

Third-party candidates can act as "spoilers" affecting outcomes.

### Solution: Ranked Choice Voting in Presidential Elections

**How It Would Work**:

- Voters rank presidential candidates
- If no candidate wins electoral majority, lowest eliminated
- Votes redistributed by next preference
- Continue until one candidate has 270

**Benefits**:

- Reduces spoiler effect
- Voters can express true preferences
- May encourage more candidates
- Works with existing Electoral College

**Challenges**:

- Requires state-by-state adoption
- Applies within states, not to Electoral College as a whole
- Doesn't address fundamental Electoral College issues
- Complex interaction with current system

**Limited Effect**:

- Doesn't address winner-take-all
- Doesn't ensure popular vote winner wins
- Addresses different problem than Electoral College dysfunction
- Better suited for primary reform

## Abolish Contingent Election

### Problem

If no candidate receives 270 electoral votes, the House decides with one vote per state delegation—highly undemocratic.

### Solution: Reform or Eliminate Contingent Election

**Option A: Plurality Wins**

- If no candidate receives 270, plurality of electoral votes wins
- Simple, prevents House involvement
- May elect candidates with less than majority support

**Option B: Runoff Election**

- If no candidate receives 270, runoff between top two
- National popular vote determines winner
- More democratic but logistically challenging

**Option C: Instant Runoff in Electoral College**

- Electors rank candidates
- Eliminated candidates' votes redistributed
- Continues until one candidate has 270

**Constitutional Considerations**:

- Current contingent election in Constitution (12th Amendment)
- Change requires constitutional amendment
- Less controversial than full Electoral College reform
- Could be packaged with other reforms

## Implementation Priorities

| Reform | Impact | Feasibility | Priority |
|--------|--------|-------------|----------|
| NPV Compact (continue) | High | Moderate | 1 |
| Electoral Count Act improvements | Low-Moderate | High (done 2022) | 2 |
| State certification reforms | Low-Moderate | High | 3 |
| Constitutional amendment (prepare) | Very High | Very Low | 4 |
| Contingent election reform | Moderate | Low | 5 |
| Proportional allocation | High | Very Low | 6 |

## Recommended Strategy

    - Focus on Virginia, Pennsylvania, Michigan
    - Bipartisan outreach
    - Prepare legal defense

2. **Implement Electoral Count Act**
    - Monitor implementation
    - Address any gaps
    - Strengthen state procedures

3. **Public education**
    - Explain Electoral College problems

    - Counter misinformation

### Medium Term (5-10 years)

1. **Activate NPV compact** (if 270 reached)
    - Coordinate state implementation
    - Defend legal challenges
    - Monitor first election

2. **Evaluate and strengthen**
    - Assess NPV operation
    - Address any problems
    - Build case for amendment

### Long Term (10+ years)

1. **Constitutional amendment**
    - When political conditions align
    - Build on NPV success
    - Permanent solution
