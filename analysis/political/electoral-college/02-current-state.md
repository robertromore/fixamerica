# Electoral College: Current State

## Structure and Mechanics

### Electoral Vote Allocation

**Total Electoral Votes**: 538

**Distribution**:

- Each state: Number of Representatives + 2 Senators
- District of Columbia: 3 (23rd Amendment, 1961)
- Majority needed to win: 270

**State Electoral Votes (2024 apportionment)**:

| State | EVs | State | EVs | State | EVs |
|-------|-----|-------|-----|-------|-----|
| California | 54 | Texas | 40 | Florida | 30 |
| New York | 28 | Pennsylvania | 19 | Illinois | 19 |
| Ohio | 17 | Georgia | 16 | North Carolina | 16 |
| Michigan | 15 | New Jersey | 14 | Virginia | 13 |

**Smallest States (3 EVs each)**: Alaska, Delaware, DC, North Dakota, South Dakota, Vermont, Wyoming

### Winner-Take-All System

**48 states + DC** use winner-take-all:

- Candidate with plurality wins all electoral votes
- No threshold required (plurality sufficient)
- Third-party votes don't translate to electoral votes

**Exceptions**:

- **Maine** (4 EVs): 2 for statewide winner, 1 for each congressional district winner
- **Nebraska** (5 EVs): 2 for statewide winner, 1 for each congressional district winner

**Recent District Splits**:

| Year | State | Result |
|------|-------|--------|
| 2008 | Nebraska | Obama won NE-2 (Omaha) |
| 2016 | Maine | Trump won ME-2 (rural) |
| 2020 | Nebraska | Biden won NE-2 |
| 2020 | Maine | Trump won ME-2 |

### Elector Selection and Voting

**Elector Selection**:

- State parties nominate elector slates
- Winning candidate's party's slate becomes electors
- Electors are typically party loyalists, activists, donors

**Elector Meeting** (December, Monday after second Wednesday):

- Electors meet in state capitals
- Cast separate ballots for president and vice president
- Certificates sent to Congress, archives, courts

**Congressional Certification** (January 6):

- Joint session of Congress
- Vice President presides
- Electoral votes counted, objections heard
- Winner declared

### Faithless Elector Laws

**Current Status** (2024 snapshot, post-*Chiafalo v. Washington*, 2020):

States may enforce elector pledges through:

| Mechanism | States |
|-----------|--------|
| Pledge required | 33 states + DC |
| Penalty for faithlessness | 14 states |
| Vote cancellation | 5 states |
| No enforcement | 17 states |

*Source: FairVote, NCSL, 2024.*

**Historical Faithless Electors** (through 2020):

- 165 faithless electors in U.S. history
- 2016: 10 attempted (7 successful) - most in modern era
- Never changed outcome

### Contingent Election

If no candidate receives 270 electoral votes:

**House Elects President**:

- One vote per state delegation
- Majority of states (26) needed
- Top three electoral vote recipients eligible
- Has occurred twice: 1800 (Jefferson), 1824 (J.Q. Adams)

**Senate Elects Vice President**:

- One vote per senator
- Majority (51) needed
- Top two electoral vote recipients eligible
- Has occurred once: 1836 (R.M. Johnson)

## Recent Electoral History

### Popular Vote vs. Electoral Vote Divergences

| Year | Winner | Popular Vote Winner | Electoral Vote | Popular Margin |
|------|--------|---------------------|----------------|----------------|
| 1876 | Hayes (R) | Tilden (D) | 185-184 | -3.0% |
| 1888 | Harrison (R) | Cleveland (D) | 233-168 | -0.8% |

| 2016 | Trump (R) | Clinton (D) | 304-227 | -2.1% |

### Battleground State Concentration

**2020 Campaign Events** (final two months):

| State | EVs | Campaign Events | Competitive? |
|-------|-----|-----------------|--------------|
| Pennsylvania | 20 | 45 | Yes |
| Florida | 29 | 35 | Yes |
| Michigan | 16 | 25 | Yes |
| Wisconsin | 10 | 20 | Yes |
| Arizona | 11 | 18 | Yes |
| North Carolina | 15 | 15 | Yes |
| California | 55 | 2 | No (safe D) |
| Texas | 38 | 3 | No (lean R) |
| New York | 29 | 0 | No (safe D) |

**Campaign Advertising Spending** (2020):

- Top 6 battleground states: 96% of spending
- 44 states + DC: 4% of spending

### Margin of Victory Patterns

**Tipping Point States** (state that provides 270th electoral vote):

| Year | Tipping Point | Margin | National Margin |
|------|---------------|--------|-----------------|
| 2020 | Wisconsin | 0.63% | 4.45% |
| 2016 | Wisconsin | 0.77% | -2.10% |
| 2012 | Colorado | 5.37% | 3.86% |
| 2008 | Colorado | 8.95% | 7.27% |
| 2004 | Ohio | 2.11% | 2.46% |
| 2000 | Florida | 0.009% | -0.51% |

## Reform Efforts

### National Popular Vote Interstate Compact

**How It Works**:

- Member states agree to award electoral votes to national popular vote winner
- Takes effect when states totaling 270+ EVs join
- Effectively creates national popular vote without amendment
- Uses states' existing constitutional authority over elector selection

**Current Status** (2024 snapshot, post-2020 apportionment):

| Status | States | Electoral Votes |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Enacted | 17 + DC | 209 |
| Passed one chamber | 6 | ~50 |
| Active legislation | 10+ | ~70 |
| Needed for activation | - | 61 more |

**Member States** (2024 snapshot):

| State | EVs | Year | State | EVs | Year |
|-------|-----|------|-------|-----|------|
| Maryland | 10 | 2007 | California | 54 | 2011 |
| New Jersey | 14 | 2008 | Rhode Island | 4 | 2013 |

| Minnesota | 10 | 2023 | Maine | 4 | 2024 |

### Constitutional Amendment Efforts

**Recent Proposals**:

- Every Vote Counts Amendment (various versions)
- Repeatedly introduced, never passed Congress
- Requires 2/3 Congress + 3/4 states

**Historical Attempts**:

- 1969: Bayh-Celler Amendment passed House 338-70, filibustered in Senate
- Closest Congress has come to Electoral College reform
- Small state senators blocked

### Electoral Count Reform Act (2022)

**Reforms Enacted**:

- Clarified vice president's ceremonial role in counting
- Raised threshold for objections (1/5 of each chamber)
- Clarified state certification process
- Set timeline for resolving disputes
- Affirmed governors' certification authority

**Limitations**:

- Doesn't address fundamental Electoral College issues
- Only addresses counting/certification process
- Doesn't prevent popular vote losers from winning

## State-Level Variations

### Allocation Methods

**Winner-Take-All** (48 states + DC):

- All electoral votes to plurality winner
- Dominant method since 1830s

**District Method** (Maine, Nebraska):

- 2 electoral votes to statewide winner
- 1 electoral vote per congressional district winner
- Can split electoral votes

**Proportional Allocation** (No states currently):

- Electoral votes allocated proportionally to vote share
- Would require all states to adopt to be fair
- Proposed but never implemented

### Recent State Legislation

**Efforts to Change Methods**:

| State | Proposal | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Nebraska | Return to winner-take-all | Attempted 2024 |
| Maine | Return to winner-take-all | Proposed periodically |
| Virginia | Switch to district method | Proposed 2013 |
| Pennsylvania | Switch to district method | Proposed multiple times |

**NPV Progress**:

- Active campaigns in Virginia, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Arizona
- Republican-controlled states generally resistant
- Some bipartisan support in competitive states
