# Electoral College: Legislation

## Overview

This document provides draft legislation for Electoral College reform, from the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact to constitutional amendments. Given the constitutional entrenchment of the Electoral College, reform primarily proceeds through state action (NPV compact) or constitutional amendment.

## Constitutional Amendments

### Direct Popular Vote Amendment

**Purpose**: Elect the president by national popular vote, eliminating the Electoral College.

**Draft Text**:

```text
AMENDMENT XXIX

Section 1. The President and Vice President shall be elected by
the direct vote of the citizens of the United States who are
qualified to vote for members of the most numerous branch of
their State legislatures.

Section 2. The pair of candidates having the greatest number of
votes for President and Vice President shall be elected, provided
such pair receives at least forty percent of the votes cast. If
no pair receives forty percent, a runoff election shall be held
within thirty days between the two pairs receiving the greatest
number of votes.

Section 3. The times, places, and manner of holding such elections
shall be prescribed by Congress, subject to regulation by States
consistent with laws enacted by Congress.

Section 4. The Congress shall have power to provide for the case
of the death or withdrawal of any candidate for President or Vice
President before the runoff election is held.

Section 5. This article shall apply to any election for President
and Vice President held more than one year after ratification of
this article.

Section 6. Congress shall have the power to enforce this article
by appropriate legislation.
```

**Explanation**:

- Section 1: Establishes direct popular vote with existing voter qualifications
- Section 2: 40% threshold with runoff provision prevents plurality winners with small support
- Section 3: Federal authority over election administration
- Section 4: Addresses candidate death/withdrawal scenarios
- Section 5: Provides transition time
- Section 6: Congressional enforcement authority

**Challenges**:

- Requires 2/3 of Congress and 3/4 of states
- Small states can block (13 states = veto)
- Partisan opposition likely
- Historical near-miss (1970: passed House, filibustered in Senate)

### Electoral College Reform Amendment (Moderate Version)

**Purpose**: Reform Electoral College while preserving state role.

**Draft Text**:

```text
AMENDMENT XXX

Section 1. Each State shall appoint, in such manner as the
Legislature thereof may direct, a number of electors equal to
the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the
State may be entitled in the Congress.

Section 2. The electors shall cast their ballots for President
and Vice President in accordance with the laws of their State.
States may provide that their electoral votes shall be cast for
the candidates receiving the greatest number of votes nationwide.

Section 3. No State shall adopt a winner-take-all system for
allocating electoral votes that differs from the allocation used
by a majority of States.

Section 4. If no candidate receives a majority of electoral votes,
the candidate receiving the greatest number of electoral votes
shall be elected President, and the candidate for Vice President
on the same ticket shall be elected Vice President.

Section 5. Congress shall have the power to enforce this article
by appropriate legislation.
```

**Explanation**:

- Section 1: Preserves current allocation structure
- Section 2: Explicitly authorizes NPV-type compacts
- Section 3: Prevents gaming if NPV adopted then abandoned
- Section 4: Eliminates contingent election in House
- Section 5: Congressional enforcement

## Interstate Compact

### National Popular Vote Interstate Compact

**Purpose**: Award electoral votes to national popular vote winner without constitutional amendment.

**Note on Placeholders:**

This model legislation uses bracketed placeholders that states should customize:

- `[State]` - Insert state name
- `[X]` - Insert appropriate numeric value based on state context
- `[Secretary of State/Chief Election Official]` - Insert appropriate state official title
- `[Governor]` - Insert appropriate executive title
- `[date]` - Insert effective date

Where possible, consider relative thresholds (e.g., percentage thresholds rather than fixed numbers) to account for state differences.

**Model State Legislation**:

```text

## Federal Legislation

### Electoral Count Modernization Act (Enacted 2022)

**Summary of Key Provisions** (for reference):

The Electoral Count Reform Act of 2022 (part of P.L. 117-328) reformed the 1887 Electoral Count Act:

1. **Vice President's Role**: Clarified as purely ministerial
2. **Objection Threshold**: Raised to 1/5 of each chamber (from 1 member each)
3. **Gubernatorial Certification**: Governor's certification is conclusive unless court-ordered change
4. **Timing**: Clarified deadlines for state certification
5. **Single Slate**: Each state submits one slate of electors
6. **Judicial Review**: Expedited federal court review of disputes

### Congressional Consent for NPV Compact

**Purpose**: Provide explicit congressional consent for the NPV compact (may not be required but would remove legal uncertainty).

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "National Popular Vote Compact
Consent Act."

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that—
(1) Article I, Section 10, Clause 3 of the Constitution provides
    that States may not enter into compacts without the consent
    of Congress when such compacts increase the political power
    of the member states at the expense of non-member states or
    the Federal Government;
(2) The National Popular Vote Interstate Compact, under which
    member states agree to appoint presidential electors based
    on the national popular vote, does not increase the power of
    member states relative to non-member states or the Federal
    Government;
(3) Nevertheless, to remove any constitutional doubt and ensure
    the effective operation of the compact, Congress consents to
    the compact.

SEC. 3. CONSENT.

Congress hereby consents to the Agreement Among the States to
Elect the President by National Popular Vote, as enacted by the
States.

SEC. 4. EFFECT.

This consent shall not be construed as approval or disapproval
of the policy of electing the President by national popular vote,
nor as a determination that such consent was constitutionally
required.
```

### Contingent Election Reform Act

**Purpose**: Reform the House contingent election procedure if no Electoral College majority.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Contingent Election Reform Act."

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that—
(1) The Twelfth Amendment provides that if no candidate receives
    a majority of electoral votes, the House of Representatives
    shall choose the President from the three candidates with the
    most electoral votes, with each state delegation having one
    vote;
(2) This procedure is profoundly undemocratic, giving Wyoming's
    single Representative equal weight to California's 52;
(3) A constitutional amendment is needed for fundamental reform,
    but interim improvements are possible.

SEC. 3. PROCEDURES FOR CONTINGENT ELECTION.

(a) TRANSPARENCY.—Any contingent election in the House shall be
    conducted with full transparency, including:
    (1) All deliberations shall be public;
    (2) Each Representative's vote within their delegation shall
        be recorded and published;
    (3) The proceedings shall be broadcast live.

(b) TIMING.—The House shall complete its selection of the President
    within seven days of the joint session count of electoral votes.

(c) QUORUM.—A quorum for the contingent election shall consist of
    a member or members from two-thirds of the states.

SEC. 4. CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT RECOMMENDATION.

Congress recommends that the States ratify a constitutional
amendment to reform or eliminate the contingent election procedure.
```

## Regulatory Framework

### Federal Election Commission Guidance

For elections under NPV (if activated):

1. **National Vote Tabulation**: Procedures for aggregating state results
2. **Certification Timeline**: Coordination with state certification deadlines
3. **Recount Procedures**: Standards for recounts affecting national total
4. **Dispute Resolution**: Process for addressing certification disputes

### State Implementation Regulations

Model regulations for NPV member states:

1. **Popular Vote Determination**: How national total is calculated
2. **Certification Process**: Timeline and procedures
3. **Elector Appointment**: Based on national winner
4. **Contingency Procedures**: If results disputed or delayed

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Questions

**Compact Clause (Article I, Section 10, Clause 3)**:

- Issue: Does NPV require congressional consent?
- Analysis: *Virginia v. Tennessee* (1893): Only compacts affecting federal supremacy need consent
- NPV doesn't increase state power at federal expense
- Strong argument consent not required; consent legislation removes doubt

**Article II (Presidential Selection)**:

- Issue: Must states base elector selection on their own voters?
- Analysis: "Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct"
- No constitutional requirement that manner be based on state's voters
- States have historically used various methods
- *Chiafalo* (2020) confirmed broad state authority

**Equal Protection**:

- Issue: Does NPV treat voters unequally?
- Analysis: All votes count equally under NPV
- Current system treats voters unequally (safe vs. swing states)
- NPV improves equality, doesn't diminish it

### Preemption

- States control elector appointment method
- Federal law sets certification timeline
- NPV operates within existing federal framework
- No preemption issues identified

### Enforcement

- Compact is self-enforcing through state laws
- Member states bound by own legislation
- Withdrawal subject to timing restrictions
- Federal courts available for disputes

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Strategic withdrawal | State withdraws when outcome unfavorable | High |
| Certification delay | State delays certification to affect outcome | Moderate |
| Legal challenge timing | Courts invalidate after election | High |
| Faithless electors | Electors vote contrary to compact | Low (post-*Chiafalo*) |
| Competing slates | State submits multiple elector slates | Low (post-ECRA) |
| Popular vote manipulation | Fraud in high-turnout states | Low |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| NPV doesn't eliminate Electoral College | Compact could be challenged or withdrawn | Constitutional entrenchment |
| Small state bonus remains | Some vote inequality persists | Constitutional structure |
| No national election administration | Reliance on state systems | Federalism |
| Amendment extremely difficult | Permanent reform nearly impossible | Supermajority requirements |
| Partisan opposition | Reform blocked by beneficiaries | Self-interest |
| Runoff complexity | Direct election needs runoff provision | Plurality concerns |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Withdrawal Prevention**
    - 6-month pre-election withdrawal blackout already in compact
    - Extend to 12 months for greater certainty
    - Add reputational/political costs through public commitment ceremonies
    - Consider financial penalties (though enforceability uncertain)

2. **Certification Timeline Protection**
    - Federal law sets "safe harbor" deadline
    - Electoral Count Reform Act strengthened timeline
    - States should codify certification deadlines
    - Federal court jurisdiction for delays

3. **Legal Challenge Preparation**
    - Retain experienced constitutional litigators pre-activation
    - Prepare briefs and arguments in advance
    - Build academic support for amicus briefs
    - Seek early, favorable precedent if possible

4. **Faithless Elector Prevention**
    - All member states should enact pledge enforcement laws
    - *Chiafalo* authorizes states to enforce pledges
    - Automatic replacement of faithless electors
    - Criminal penalties where constitutional

5. **Vote Integrity**
    - National standards for election administration
    - Robust audit requirements
    - Paper ballot backups
    - Post-election audits in all states

6. **Toward Constitutional Amendment**
    - Build NPV success record
    - Maintain amendment as long-term goal
    - Educate public about permanence benefits
    - Wait for political alignment

### General Implementation Concerns

1. **First Election Under NPV**
    - Extensive public education needed
    - Clear communication about how system works
    - Preparation for legal challenges
    - Recommendation: Major public information campaign 6+ months before

2. **Close Election Scenarios**
    - National recount procedures needed
    - State-by-state recount could be chaotic
    - Recommendation: Federal recount standards, trigger thresholds

3. **Third-Party Impact**
    - NPV doesn't address plurality winners
    - Candidate with 35% could win
    - Recommendation: Consider ranked choice voting as complement
    - Long-term: Amendment with runoff provision

4. **Transition Period**
    - Between compact activation and first election
    - Legal challenges likely filed
    - Recommendation: Activate with sufficient lead time before election
