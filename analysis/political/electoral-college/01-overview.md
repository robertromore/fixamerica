# Electoral College: Overview

## Executive Summary

The Electoral College is America's unique system for electing the president. Designed in 1787 as a compromise between congressional selection and direct popular vote, it has become increasingly controversial as it has twice in recent decades (2000, 2016) elected presidents who lost the popular vote. Reform efforts range from the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact to full abolition via constitutional amendment. This analysis examines the system's origins, problems, and pathways for change.

## The Core Questions

1. **Legitimacy**: Should a candidate who loses the popular vote become president?
2. **Representation**: Does the Electoral College fairly represent all Americans?
3. **Campaigning**: Does the winner-take-all system distort presidential campaigns?
4. **Federalism**: Is state-based election of the president essential to our federal system?
5. **Reform**: Can meaningful reform happen without a constitutional amendment?

## Key Problems

### Democratic Legitimacy

| Problem | Description | Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Popular vote losers | Candidates can win presidency while losing popular vote | Undermines democratic legitimacy |
| Unequal representation | Small states over-represented (Wyoming: 1 EV per 192K; California: 1 EV per 719K) | Votes count unequally |
| Winner-take-all | Millions of votes "don't count" in non-competitive states | Voter alienation |

### Campaign Distortions

| Problem | Description | Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Battleground focus | Campaigns only contest 5-10 swing states | Most voters ignored |
| Issue distortions | Candidates prioritize swing state concerns | National issues neglected |
| Resource concentration | Campaign spending concentrated in few states | Unequal attention |

### System Vulnerabilities

| Problem | Description | Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Faithless electors | Electors can vote contrary to state results | Uncertainty, potential manipulation |
| Contingent election | House decides if no majority (one vote per state delegation) | Undemocratic backup |
| Certification disputes | Multiple points of potential manipulation | 2020 demonstrated risks |

## Reform Spectrum

### Incremental Reforms

- Eliminate faithless electors (largely accomplished via *Chiafalo*)
- Reform Electoral Count Act (done in 2022)
- Improve state certification processes

### Moderate Reforms

- National Popular Vote Interstate Compact
- Proportional allocation within states
- District allocation method expansion

### Structural Reforms
