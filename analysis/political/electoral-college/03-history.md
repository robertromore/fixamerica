# Electoral College: History

## Constitutional Convention (1787)

### The Central Dilemma

The Convention faced a fundamental question: How should the president be selected?

**Options Considered**:

1. **Congressional selection**: Legislature chooses president
2. **Direct popular vote**: Citizens vote directly
3. **State legislatures**: States choose president
4. **Electoral intermediary**: Electors chosen by states

### Arguments at the Convention

**For Congressional Selection** (Virginia Plan):

- Ensures qualified, knowledgeable selection
- Links executive to representative body
- Madison initially supported

**Against Congressional Selection**:

- President would be dependent on Congress
- Undermines separation of powers
- Invites corruption and intrigue

**For Direct Popular Vote** (James Wilson, Gouverneur Morris):

- Most democratic method
- President represents all people
- Wilson: "The people at large" should choose

**Against Direct Popular Vote**:

- Large states would dominate
- Voters lack information about distant candidates
- Southern states disadvantaged (enslaved population couldn't vote)
- Fear of "mob rule"

### The Electoral College Compromise

**Key Features**:

- Electors chosen by method each state legislature determines
- Number of electors equals congressional delegation
- Electors vote for two persons (originally)
- If no majority, House decides (one vote per state)

**Three-Fifths Compromise Connection**:

- Enslaved persons counted as 3/5 for apportionment
- Increased Southern representation in House
- Increased Southern electoral votes
- Made Electoral College more acceptable to South

### Original Expectations

**What Framers Expected**:

- Electors would exercise independent judgment
- Multiple candidates would split votes
- House would frequently decide
- Washington exception; after him, uncertain outcomes

**What Actually Happened**:

- Political parties emerged immediately
- Electors became party loyalists
- Winner-take-all systems adopted
- House contingent elections rare

## Early Republic (1789-1824)

### Washington Era (1789-1796)

**1789**: Washington elected unanimously (69 EVs)

**1792**: Washington re-elected unanimously (132 EVs)

- No contested presidential elections
- Electors genuinely chose among candidates for VP

### Partisan Competition Emerges

**1796**:

- First contested election
- Adams (Federalist) vs. Jefferson (Democratic-Republican)
- Adams won 71-68
- Jefferson became VP (original system: runner-up)

**1800 Crisis**:

- Jefferson and Burr tied at 73 EVs each
- House of Representatives decided (36 ballots)
- Jefferson elected after Hamilton intervention
- Exposed flaw in original design

### Twelfth Amendment (1804)

**Changes**:

- Separate ballots for president and vice president
- Prevents tie between running mates
- Reduces House contingent election likelihood

**Significance**:

- First modification to Electoral College
- Acknowledged party system reality
- Made ticket voting standard

### Early Winner-Take-All Adoption

**State-by-State Adoption**:

| Decade | States Using Winner-Take-All |
|--------|------------------------------|
| 1790s | ~30% |
| 1800s | ~50% |
| 1820s | ~80% |
| 1836 | All but South Carolina |

**Why States Adopted**:

- Maximizes state's electoral influence
- "Arms race" dynamic: if one state does it, others must follow
- Partisan advantage for majority party
- National pressure for uniformity

## Jacksonian Era to Civil War (1824-1860)

### 1824: Last House Election

**Four-Way Race**:

- Andrew Jackson: 99 EVs, 41.4% popular vote
- John Quincy Adams: 84 EVs, 30.9% popular vote
- William Crawford: 41 EVs
- Henry Clay: 37 EVs

**House Decision**:

- Clay (eliminated) backed Adams
- Adams won House vote
- Jackson called it "corrupt bargain"
- Fueled Jacksonian movement

### Democratization Trend

**Popular Vote Expansion**:

- Property requirements eliminated
- White male suffrage expanded
- Popular vote totals grew dramatically

**State Legislature Control Reduced**:

- By 1832, all but South Carolina used popular vote
- South Carolina: Legislature chose until Civil War

### 1860: Sectional Crisis

**Four-Way Split**:

- Lincoln: 180 EVs (39.8% popular vote)
- Breckinridge: 72 EVs
- Bell: 39 EVs
- Douglas: 12 EVs (29.5% popular vote)

**Significance**:

- Lincoln won without Southern support
- Demonstrated Electoral College could elect sectional candidate
- South seceded before inauguration

## Reconstruction and Gilded Age (1865-1900)

### 15th Amendment Impact

**Voting Rights Expansion**:

- African American men gained vote (1870)
- Southern electoral votes now based on full population
- Brief period of Black political participation

**Reconstruction Elections**:

- Republican dominance in South
- Federal troops protected voting
- Electoral College reflected expanded electorate

### 1876: Most Disputed Election

**Initial Results**:

- Tilden (D): 184 EVs, 50.9% popular vote
- Hayes (R): 165 EVs, 47.9% popular vote
- 20 EVs disputed (Florida, Louisiana, South Carolina, Oregon)

**Resolution**:

- Electoral Commission (8-7 Republican majority)
- All disputes resolved for Hayes
- Hayes won 185-184
- Compromise of 1877: Reconstruction ended

**Significance**:

- Demonstrated Electoral College vulnerability to manipulation
- Led to Electoral Count Act of 1887
- Showed how close elections create crisis

### 1888: Popular Vote Loser Wins

**Results**:

- Cleveland (D): 168 EVs, 48.6% popular vote
- Harrison (R): 233 EVs, 47.8% popular vote

**Analysis**:

- Cleveland won by 90,000+ votes
- Harrison won key states narrowly
- Cleveland won safe states by large margins
- Electoral College "efficiency gap" demonstrated

## Progressive Era to Modern Era (1900-1968)

### Reform Movements

**Progressive Era Proposals**:

- Direct election amendments proposed
- Focus on eliminating corrupt electoral practices
- 17th Amendment (direct Senate election) achieved
- Electoral College reform stalled

**Lodge-Gossett Amendment (1950)**:

- Proportional allocation of electoral votes
- Passed Senate 64-27
- Failed in House
- Closest reform came until 1960s

### 1960: Close Call

**Results**:

- Kennedy: 303 EVs, 49.72% popular vote
- Nixon: 219 EVs, 49.55% popular vote

**Controversies**:

- Allegations of fraud in Illinois, Texas
- Extremely close popular vote (0.17%)
- Nixon chose not to contest
- Demonstrated narrow margins in Electoral College

### 1968: Three-Way Race

**Results**:

- Nixon: 301 EVs, 43.4% popular vote
- Humphrey: 191 EVs, 42.7% popular vote
- Wallace: 46 EVs, 13.5% popular vote

**Significance**:

- Wallace won 5 Southern states
- Closest to contingent election since 1824
- If Nixon lost a few states, House would decide
- Spurred Bayh-Celler reform effort

### Bayh-Celler Amendment (1969-1970)

**Proposal**:

- Direct national popular vote
- 40% threshold to win
- Runoff if no candidate reaches 40%

**Progress**:

- Passed House 338-70 (September 1969)
- Filibustered in Senate (September 1970)
- 54 senators supported (needed 67 for cloture)
- Small-state and Southern senators blocked

**Why It Failed**:

- Small states feared loss of influence
- Southern senators opposed (civil rights concerns)
- Conservative backlash
- Momentum lost after Nixon re-election

## Contemporary Era (1968-Present)

### 2000: Bush v. Gore

**Results**:

- Gore: 266 EVs, 50.999 million votes (48.38%)
- Bush: 271 EVs, 50.456 million votes (47.87%)

**Florida Recount**:

- Initial margin: 1,784 votes
- Manual recounts in some counties
- Legal battles reached Supreme Court
- *Bush v. Gore* stopped recounts (December 12)
- Final certified margin: 537 votes

**Significance**:

- First popular vote loser elected since 1888
- Supreme Court effectively decided election
- Renewed Electoral College debate
- Gore won popular vote by 543,895

- Legal challenges in multiple states (all failed)
- Pressure on state officials to change results
- Fake elector schemes
- January 6 Capitol attack during certification

**Reform Response**:

- Electoral Count Reform Act (2022)

## Lessons from History

### Persistent Patterns

1. **Winner-take-all entrenchment**: Once adopted, hard to change
2. **Small state protection**: Blocks reform repeatedly
3. **Crisis-driven attention**: Interest peaks after controversial outcomes
4. **Reform momentum fades**: Without sustained crisis, energy dissipates

### What History Shows

- Electoral College never worked as Framers intended
- Popular vote losers winning is recurring possibility
- Reform comes close but never succeeds
- Incremental change (12th Amendment, Electoral Count Act) possible
- Fundamental reform requires extraordinary political conditions
