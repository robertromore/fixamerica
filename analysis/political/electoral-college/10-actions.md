## For All Citizens

### Educate Yourself

**Understand the Electoral College**

- Learn how electoral votes are allocated
- Understand winner-take-all and its effects
- Know your state's electoral vote count
- Follow the National Popular Vote compact progress

**Key Facts to Know** (2024 snapshot):

- 538 total electoral votes; 270 needed to win
- Two presidents this century lost the popular vote but won (2000, 2016)
- Approximately 80% of voters live in non-competitive states
- NPV compact has 209 electoral votes (needs 61 more to reach 270) *Source: National Popular Vote Inc., Dec. 2024 update.*

### Support the National Popular Vote Compact

**If Your State Has Joined NPV**:

- Thank legislators who voted for it
- Defend against repeal efforts
- Educate others about how it works
- Support implementation preparation

**If Your State Hasn't Joined**:

- Contact state legislators
- Support NPV legislation
- Write letters to the editor
- Organize with local reform groups

**Key Messages**:

- "Every vote should count equally in presidential elections"
- "The candidate with the most votes should win"
- "Our state is ignored under the current system" (if non-battleground)
- "NPV would make every vote matter"

### Contact Your Legislators

**State Legislators** (Most Important):

- Ask them to support NPV compact legislation
- Request meetings to discuss reform
- Attend town halls and raise the issue
- Write, call, and email

**Federal Legislators**:

- Support Electoral Count Act implementation
- Oppose efforts to undermine election certification
- Support constitutional amendment if introduced

**Sample Script**:

> "I'm calling to ask [Representative/Senator] to support the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact. Under our current system, presidential candidates ignore [state] because we're not a battleground state. NPV would ensure that every vote counts equally and the candidate with the most votes wins. Will [Representative/Senator] support this reform?"

### Vote and Participate

**In All Elections**:

- Vote in state legislative races (they control NPV)
- Support candidates who back electoral reform
- Participate in primaries

**Ask Candidates**:

- "What reforms do you support to improve our electoral system?"
