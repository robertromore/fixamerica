# Electoral College: Stakeholders

## Affected Populations

### Voters in Non-Competitive States

**Who They Are**:

- Approximately 80% of American voters
- Live in "safe" states (reliably Democratic or Republican)
- Includes most of California, Texas, New York, etc.
- Both Democrats in red states and Republicans in blue states

**Current Impact**:

| Impact | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Ignored by campaigns | Candidates don't visit or advertise |
| Issues neglected | State-specific concerns not addressed |
| Lower efficacy | Votes feel less meaningful |
| Reduced turnout | Motivation to vote diminished |

**Stakes in Reform**:

- National popular vote would make every vote count equally
- Would receive campaign attention
- Issues would gain prominence
- Higher sense of political efficacy

### Voters in Battleground States

**Who They Are**:

- Approximately 20% of American voters
- Live in competitive states (Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, Georgia, etc.)
- Disproportionately influential in outcomes

**Current Impact**:

| Impact | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Intense attention | Heavy campaign presence |
| Responsive candidates | Issues addressed |
| Higher mobilization | Turnout drives |
| Greater influence | Votes decisive |

**Stakes in Reform**:

- Would lose disproportionate influence
- Less campaign attention (spread nationally)
- But votes would still count equally
- Mixed feelings about reform

### Urban vs. Rural Voters

**Urban Voters**:

- Concentrated in cities
- Majority Democratic
- Votes often "wasted" in safe states
- Would benefit from national popular vote

**Rural Voters**:

- Spread across states
- Majority Republican
- Benefit from small state bonus
- Concerned about losing influence under NPV

**Reality Check**:

- Rural voters in safe states also ignored
- Republican voters in California, Democratic voters in Texas
- Current system doesn't actually protect rural interests
- Campaigns focus on suburban battleground voters

### Minority Voters

**African American Voters**:

- Concentrated in Southern states and urban areas
- Many in non-competitive states
- Historical disenfranchisement connected to Electoral College origins
- Would benefit from votes counting equally

**Latino Voters**:

- Growing population in Texas, California, Arizona
- Texas (non-competitive) votes less influential
- Arizona (competitive) votes very influential
- National popular vote would equalize

**All Minority Voters**:

- Currently: Influence depends on geographic concentration
- Under NPV: All votes count equally
- Potential for increased political attention and responsiveness

## Power Holders

### Small State Political Leaders

**Position**: Generally oppose Electoral College reform

**Interests**:

- Preserve disproportionate influence
- Maintain small state leverage in federal system
- Protect current political arrangements

**Current Power**:

- Over-represented in Senate
- Can prevent NPV compact activation

### Battleground State Politicians

**Position**: Mixed

**Interests**:

- But also face intense, exhausting campaigns

**Considerations**:

- Some battleground politicians support NPV

### Republican Party Leadership

**Strategy**:

- Promote NPV compact
- Constitutional amendment less viable
- Focus on state-by-state adoption

### State Legislatures

**Role**: Control elector allocation method

**Positions**:
