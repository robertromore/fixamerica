# Campaign Finance: Political Perspectives Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes campaign finance reform through nine distinct political perspectives, evaluating current state assessments, root cause analyses, proposed solutions, and legislation. Each perspective receives engagement-consistency ratings and position scores, culminating in compromise proposals that bridge multiple viewpoints.

## Perspective Definitions

| Perspective | Core Values | Policy Orientation |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Tradition, limited government, individual responsibility | Incremental change, fiscal restraint, market solutions |
| Liberal | Progress, equality, social responsibility | Government as problem-solver, regulation, safety nets |
| Progressive | Systemic change, economic justice, structural reform | Transformative reform, wealth redistribution, worker power |
| Libertarian | Individual liberty, minimal state, free markets | Deregulation, privatization, voluntary association |
| Constitutionalist | Original intent, enumerated powers, federalism | Strict constitutional limits, states' rights |
| Populist | Anti-elite, pro-worker, economic nationalism | Trade protection, anti-monopoly, immigration restriction |
| Centrist | Pragmatism, compromise, incremental progress | Bipartisan solutions, evidence-based policy |
| Religious Right | Faith-based values, traditional morality | Social conservatism, religious liberty |
| Democratic Socialist | Worker ownership, public goods, democratic control | Public investment, labor rights, universal programs |

## Scoring Framework

### Position Scores (1-10)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10 | Full agreement with project analysis |
| 7-9 | Substantial to strong agreement |
| 5-6 | Mixed/moderate agreement |
| 3-4 | Substantial disagreement |
| 1-2 | Strong opposition |

### Engagement Consistency (1-5)

| Level | Label | Indicators |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 5 | Highly Consistent | Stated motivations = actual motivations; consistent principles across contexts |
| 4 | Mostly Consistent | Genuine beliefs with minor strategic exceptions |
| 3 | Mixed Consistency | Some genuine concerns combined with some strategic positioning |
| 2 | Low Consistency | Pretextual objections; goalposts move; selective principle application |
| 1 | Unpredictable | Pure obstruction; zero-sum warfare; oppose because opponents support |

**Bad Faith Indicators:**

- Hidden interests (stated vs actual motivations differ significantly)
- Zero-sum mindset (oppose proposals because opponents support them)
- Movable goalposts (shifting objections when concerns are addressed)
- Selective principle application (principles apply only when convenient)
- Pretextual arguments (stated reasons not the real reasons)

### Legislation Status Reference (as of January 2026)

| Bill/Amendment | Type | Current Status | Last Action |
|----------------|------|----------------|-------------|
| Democracy For All Amendment | Constitutional Amendment | Not introduced (119th Congress) | H.J.Res. 54 (118th) died in committee |
| We The People Amendment | Constitutional Amendment | Not introduced (119th Congress) | H.J.Res. 48 (118th) died in committee |
| DISCLOSE Act | Federal Legislation | Pending reintroduction | S. 443 (118th) blocked by filibuster, 51-49 |
| Government By The People Act | Federal Legislation | Pending reintroduction | Included in H.R. 1 (118th), passed House |
| FEC Reform Act | Federal Legislation | Pending reintroduction | Included in H.R. 1 (118th), blocked in Senate |

*Note: Status reflects 119th Congress (2025-2026). See [11-legislation.md](11-legislation.md) for full bill text.*

## Perspective Analyses

### Conservative Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine First Amendment concerns mixed with donor protection interests |
| Principle consistency | "Free speech" applied selectively; less concern about government speech restrictions in other contexts |
| Goalpost stability | Some movement; disclosure once supported (McCain) now often opposed |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate; willing to engage on some issues but reflexive opposition to Democratic priorities |

**Justification:** Conservative opposition includes genuine philosophical concerns about government regulation of political speech and federal overreach. However, the consistent alignment with major donor interests, the shift away from disclosure reforms (which conservatives like John McCain championed in the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act), and selective application of free speech principles suggest mixed motivations.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Shift on disclosure*: Senate Republicans unanimously blocked the DISCLOSE Act in 2010, 2012, and 2024, despite McCain-Feingold's disclosure requirements having conservative support in 2002. See: Senate roll call votes on S. 3628 (2010), S. 2219 (2012).
- *Selective speech concerns*: The 2016 GOP platform called for restricting union political spending while opposing limits on corporate spending. See: 2016 Republican Party Platform, pp. 24-25.
- *Donor alignment*: Koch network and Chamber of Commerce consistently oppose disclosure; Republican positions align. See: Mayer, Jane. *Dark Money* (2016), ch. 12-14.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Agrees money in politics is significant but disputes framing; sees labor unions and Democratic dark money as equivalent problems |
| Root Cause Agreement | 3/10 | Rejects premise that Citizens United was harmful; views spending limits as the problem, not the solution |

**Source references:**

- *2024 Republican Party Platform*, Section 1: "Protect free speech, including the right to spend money on political causes"
- Heritage Foundation. "Campaign Finance" issue briefs (2023-2024): Frame spending limits as unconstitutional restrictions
- McConnell, Mitch. Senate floor speeches on DISCLOSE Act (2010, 2012, 2024): Articulate donor harassment concerns

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Small-Dollar Matching | 3/10 | "Taxpayer-funded political campaigns" | Loss of fundraising advantage; government involvement in elections |
| Democracy Vouchers | 2/10 | "Government handouts for politicians" | Same concerns plus administrative complexity |
| Clean Elections | 2/10 | "Failed experiments that limit speech" | Eliminates donor relationships that benefit party |
| DISCLOSE Act | 4/10 | "Chilling effect on political participation; donor harassment" | Loss of anonymous donor channels; exposure of corporate funding |
| FEC Reform | 4/10 | "Creates partisan enforcement weapon" | Fear of aggressive enforcement against conservative groups |
| Constitutional Amendment | 1/10 | "Overturning First Amendment protections" | Fundamental opposition to premise |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Democracy For All Amendment | 1/10 | "Would gut the First Amendment" | Enables spending limits conservatives believe unconstitutional |
| We The People Amendment | 1/10 | "Radical rewrite of constitutional rights" | Addresses corporate personhood conservatives defend |
| DISCLOSE Act | 3/10 | "Burdensome reporting; chills speech" | Would expose donor networks |
| Government By The People Act | 2/10 | "Welfare for politicians" | Public financing threatens current advantages |
| FEC Reform Act | 4/10 | "Politicizes enforcement" | Independent enforcement could target conservative groups |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Deregulation: Remove contribution limits entirely with full disclosure
- Focus on corruption: Prosecute actual quid pro quo rather than regulate speech
- Strengthen anti-coordination rules rather than limit independent speech
- Oppose McCain-Feingold style restrictions

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Libertarian (on deregulation), Constitutionalist (on federal limits)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (on disclosure with protections), Populist (on anti-elite framing if targeted correctly)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist, Liberal

### Liberal Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine concern about democratic equality; some partisan advantage calculation |
| Principle consistency | Generally consistent; supports reform even when Democrats benefit from current system |
| Goalpost stability | Stable positions on major reforms |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low; willing to accept reforms that apply equally to both parties |

**Justification:** Liberal support for campaign finance reform reflects genuine democratic concerns. Democrats have pushed For the People Act even when controlling large-donor networks. However, some partisan calculation exists—reforms would affect Republican donor advantages more than Democratic small-donor base. Slightly reduced from 5 because Democratic leaders still aggressively pursue Super PAC funding while criticizing the system.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strongly agrees with analysis of money's corrupting influence; may add emphasis on racial dimensions of donor demographics |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | Agrees with structural analysis; would emphasize Republican responsibility more |

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Small-Dollar Matching | 9/10 | "Amplifies citizen voices" | Works well with Democratic small-donor advantage |
| Democracy Vouchers | 8/10 | "Democratizes political giving" | Supports concept; some administrative concerns |
| Clean Elections | 8/10 | "Proven reform" | Would level playing field |
| DISCLOSE Act | 10/10 | "Voters deserve to know" | Exposes dark money that often funds opposition |
| FEC Reform | 9/10 | "Ends gridlock and enables enforcement" | Current dysfunction benefits bad actors |
| Constitutional Amendment | 8/10 | "Necessary for lasting change" | Long-term goal; focus on achievable wins first |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Democracy For All Amendment | 9/10 | "Restores common-sense regulation" | Enables comprehensive reform |
| We The People Amendment | 8/10 | "Addresses root of the problem" | May prefer more targeted approach |
| DISCLOSE Act | 10/10 | "Top priority for democratic reform" | Key building block |
| Government By The People Act | 9/10 | "Reduces dependence on big donors" | Creates small-donor incentive |
| FEC Reform Act | 9/10 | "Essential for any reform to work" | Enables enforcement |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Enhanced public financing with higher matching ratios
- Stricter coordination rules
- Real-time online disclosure
- State-level model programs

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist, Centrist
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (on anti-corruption), Libertarian (on disclosure)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative, Constitutionalist, Religious Right

---

### Progressive Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Consistent focus on structural change; willing to criticize Democrats who benefit from status quo |
| Principle consistency | Applies anti-corruption principles uniformly; criticizes Democratic Super PACs |
| Goalpost stability | Consistent long-term vision |
| Zero-sum behavior | None; focuses on systemic change regardless of partisan impact |

**Justification:** Progressive advocates have consistently championed campaign finance reform even when it would disadvantage Democratic incumbents. No evidence of bad faith.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- *Challenging own party*: Justice Democrats (founded 2017) explicitly targets corporate-funded Democratic incumbents; defeated Rep. Joe Crowley (2018), Rep. Eliot Engel (2020). See: Politico, "The Squad's quiet wins" (2020).
- *Consistent rejection of Super PACs*: Bernie Sanders refused Super PAC support in 2016 and 2020 despite competitive disadvantage. See: FEC filings, Sanders campaign statements.
- *Criticizing Democratic dark money*: Progressive groups criticized Democratic Super PACs like Priorities USA. See: The Intercept, "Democrats Rail Against Dark Money, Then Embrace It" (2020).
- *Platform consistency*: Congressional Progressive Caucus has included public financing in every budget alternative since 2012. See: CPC "People's Budget" documents.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 10/10 | Full agreement; would add emphasis on class dimensions and economic inequality |
| Root Cause Agreement | 10/10 | Strong agreement with structural analysis; may push further on capitalism as root cause |

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Small-Dollar Matching | 9/10 | "Good step but not enough alone" | Prefers higher ratios and broader scope |
| Democracy Vouchers | 10/10 | "Most democratic approach" | Equalizes political voice |
| Clean Elections | 10/10 | "Full public financing is the goal" | Eliminates donor dependence entirely |
| DISCLOSE Act | 8/10 | "Necessary but insufficient" | Doesn't limit money, just exposes it |
| FEC Reform | 9/10 | "Must be part of comprehensive package" | Enforcement essential but not standalone |
| Constitutional Amendment | 10/10 | "Only permanent solution" | Fundamental change required |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Democracy For All Amendment | 10/10 | "Essential first step" | Enables transformative reform |
| We The People Amendment | 10/10 | "Preferred comprehensive approach" | Addresses corporate power broadly |
| DISCLOSE Act | 8/10 | "Incomplete but supportable" | Would push for more |
| Government By The People Act | 8/10 | "Good start; should be expanded" | Would increase matching ratio, lower contribution limits |
| FEC Reform Act | 9/10 | "Necessary infrastructure" | Enables enforcement of other reforms |

#### Alternative Proposals

- 100% public financing with no private contributions
- Strict contribution limits (e.g., $200 maximum)
- Ban on candidate self-funding
- Publicly funded candidate time on broadcast media
- Shorter campaign seasons

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Democratic Socialist, Liberal
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (on anti-elite/anti-corporate), Centrist (on evidence-based reforms)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative, Libertarian, Constitutionalist

### Libertarian Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine philosophical commitment to free speech and limited government |
| Principle consistency | Consistent opposition to both corporate welfare AND campaign restrictions; applies principles evenly |
| Goalpost stability | Stable first principles |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low; often disagrees with both major parties |

**Justification:** Libertarian opposition to campaign finance regulation stems from consistent first principles about government power and free association. Unlike conservatives, libertarians also oppose corporate welfare and cronyism that big money enables. Some inconsistency: libertarians focus more on regulations they oppose than the anti-competitive effects of current system. Minor reduction for not fully engaging with democratic equality concerns.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Agrees money distorts policy but blames government power, not money itself; "reduce what politicians can sell" |
| Root Cause Agreement | 3/10 | Rejects analysis; sees government power as cause, not money; First Amendment doctrine is correct |

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Small-Dollar Matching | 2/10 | "Government shouldn't fund campaigns" | Coerced taxpayer funding of speech |
| Democracy Vouchers | 3/10 | "Better than direct grants but still government involvement" | Less coercive than matching but still problematic |
| Clean Elections | 1/10 | "Full government control of political speech" | Maximum government involvement |
| DISCLOSE Act | 7/10 | "Transparency is compatible with liberty" | Disclosure doesn't restrict speech |
| FEC Reform | 4/10 | "More effective enforcement of bad laws" | Concern about empowering regulators |
| Constitutional Amendment | 1/10 | "Would enable censorship" | Fundamental opposition |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Democracy For All Amendment | 1/10 | "Empowers government to restrict political speech" | Core liberty concern |
| We The People Amendment | 1/10 | "Even worse—denies rights to associations" | Attacks freedom of association |
| DISCLOSE Act | 7/10 | "Reasonable transparency requirement" | No speech restriction |
| Government By The People Act | 2/10 | "Taxpayer-funded campaigns violate liberty" | Forced speech funding |
| FEC Reform Act | 3/10 | "Making bad agency more effective is bad" | Enables more regulation |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Full deregulation of campaign finance with complete transparency
- Reduce government power so there's less to "buy"
- Eliminate corporate welfare and cronyism
- Voluntary contribution disclosure only
- Let markets work—voters can punish corruption

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (on deregulation)
- **Potential bridges:** Progressive (on anti-cronyism, transparency), Liberal (on disclosure)
- **Unlikely partners:** Democratic Socialist (on public financing)

---

### Constitutionalist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Some genuine constitutional concerns; often aligns conveniently with partisan interests |
| Principle consistency | "States' rights" and "enumerated powers" applied selectively |
| Goalpost stability | Constitutional interpretations shift when politically convenient |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate; constitutional principles invoked more against Democratic priorities |

**Justification:** Constitutionalist objections include genuine concerns about federal power and original intent. However, the convenient alignment between "constitutional" positions and Republican policy preferences suggests some motivated reasoning. Constitutionalists rarely apply their principles to question constitutional basis for corporate personhood (a judicial invention) or to support state-level reforms. Mixed faith because selective application undermines credibility.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 4/10 | Acknowledges problems but frames as government overreach, not money influence |
| Root Cause Agreement | 2/10 | Disputes First Amendment analysis; Courts correctly protect speech; federal regulation is the problem |

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Small-Dollar Matching | 2/10 | "No constitutional authority for federal campaign financing" | Enumerated powers violation |
| Democracy Vouchers | 2/10 | "Federal government has no role in state/local elections" | Federalism concerns |
| Clean Elections | 1/10 | "Clearly unconstitutional federal overreach" | Maximum opposition |
| DISCLOSE Act | 3/10 | "First Amendment concerns about compelled disclosure" | Some merit to transparency but not federally mandated |
| FEC Reform | 3/10 | "FEC itself is constitutionally questionable" | Agency structure concerns |
| Constitutional Amendment | 2/10 | "Would fundamentally alter constitutional structure" | Opposes changing Constitution to enable regulation |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Democracy For All Amendment | 2/10 | "Dangerous amendment that alters Bill of Rights" | Changes fundamental rights framework |
| We The People Amendment | 1/10 | "Radical restructuring of constitutional order" | Denies established corporate rights |
| DISCLOSE Act | 3/10 | "Federal overreach into political speech" | Federalism and First Amendment |
| Government By The People Act | 2/10 | "No enumerated power authorizes this" | Constitutional authority lacking |
| FEC Reform Act | 3/10 | "Doesn't address fundamental constitutional problems" | Agency itself problematic |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Return campaign finance to states (10th Amendment)
- Limit federal government power to reduce corruption incentives
- Strict construction of existing campaign finance laws
- Constitutional challenges to existing regulations
- State-level experimentation only

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative, Libertarian (on federal limits)
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (on anti-federal themes)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive, Liberal, Democratic Socialist

---

### Populist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine anti-elite sentiment; sometimes captured by elite interests using populist rhetoric |
| Principle consistency | Consistent anti-establishment focus; applies to both parties |
| Goalpost stability | Generally stable anti-corruption stance |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low on economic issues; higher on cultural issues |

**Justification:** Populist anger at money in politics reflects genuine working-class frustration with a system that favors wealthy interests. Both left-populists (Sanders) and right-populists (Trump's "drain the swamp" rhetoric) have criticized campaign finance. However, right-populist leaders often take positions that benefit wealthy donors once in power, suggesting some capture. Slight reduction for inconsistency between rhetoric and action in some populist movements.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Strong agreement that elites control system; may differ on which elites (Wall Street vs Silicon Valley vs media) |
| Root Cause Agreement | 7/10 | Agrees wealthy interests corrupt politics; may emphasize different actors |

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Small-Dollar Matching | 7/10 | "Empowers regular people" | Skeptical of government programs but supports leveling |
| Democracy Vouchers | 8/10 | "Gives power back to the people" | Direct citizen empowerment appeals |
| Clean Elections | 6/10 | "Gets rid of big donors but creates government control" | Mixed: anti-elite but anti-government |
| DISCLOSE Act | 9/10 | "Expose the swamp" | Popular demand for transparency |
| FEC Reform | 7/10 | "Make them enforce the rules" | Distrust of regulatory capture |
| Constitutional Amendment | 6/10 | "Extreme but maybe necessary" | Prefers direct action |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Democracy For All Amendment | 6/10 | "Might be needed to drain the swamp" | Skeptical of constitutional process |
| We The People Amendment | 7/10 | "Corporations aren't people" | Anti-corporate resonates |
| DISCLOSE Act | 9/10 | "Let us see who's buying politicians" | Strong support for transparency |
| Government By The People Act | 7/10 | "Better than the current corrupt system" | Prefers citizen funding to elite funding |
| FEC Reform Act | 7/10 | "Stop letting them get away with it" | Enforcement appeals |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Term limits to reduce incumbent advantage
- Ban on corporate PAC contributions
- Recall mechanisms for corrupt officials
- Direct democracy on campaign finance rules
- Revolving door prohibitions

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive (left-populist), some Conservative (right-populist)
- **Potential bridges:** Liberal (on disclosure), Democratic Socialist (on anti-corporate)
- **Unlikely partners:** Libertarian (on market solutions), Centrist (on establishment approach)

---

### Centrist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine commitment to pragmatic reform; sometimes used to oppose change |
| Principle consistency | Consistent preference for incremental, bipartisan approaches |
| Goalpost stability | Generally stable; may adjust based on what's politically possible |
| Zero-sum behavior | Very low; defines identity around bridge-building |

**Justification:** Centrist reformers like Issue One and the Campaign Legal Center demonstrate genuine commitment to good-government reform. They pursue achievable wins rather than ideological purity. Minor reduction because "centrism" can sometimes mask status quo bias or false equivalence between parties with different levels of bad faith on this issue.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Agrees with most analysis; may soften criticism of both parties equally |
| Root Cause Agreement | 7/10 | Agrees with structural analysis; emphasizes bipartisan nature of problem |

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Small-Dollar Matching | 8/10 | "Proven, practical reform" | Evidence-based |
| Democracy Vouchers | 7/10 | "Innovative but needs more testing" | Prefers proven models |
| Clean Elections | 6/10 | "Works in some contexts" | May be too ambitious for federal level |
| DISCLOSE Act | 9/10 | "Common-sense transparency" | Bipartisan in principle |
| FEC Reform | 8/10 | "Essential for any reform to work" | Practical necessity |
| Constitutional Amendment | 5/10 | "Long-term goal but focus on achievable wins" | Skeptical of viability |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Democracy For All Amendment | 5/10 | "Admirable goal but practically difficult" | Focus resources on achievable reforms |
| We The People Amendment | 4/10 | "Too comprehensive to pass" | Prefer targeted approach |
| DISCLOSE Act | 9/10 | "Should be bipartisan priority" | Most achievable reform |
| Government By The People Act | 8/10 | "Good model for federal public financing" | Proven at state level |
| FEC Reform Act | 8/10 | "Makes other reforms possible" | Essential infrastructure |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Bipartisan disclosure requirements
- Incremental public financing pilots
- FEC depoliticization through independent appointments
- State-level laboratories of democracy
- Small wins that build momentum

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberal (on most reforms)
- **Potential bridges:** Conservative (on disclosure), Populist (on anti-corruption), Libertarian (on transparency)
- **Unlikely partners:** Strong ideological positions on left or right that reject compromise

---

### Religious Right Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Mix of genuine religious freedom concerns and alignment with donor interests |
| Principle consistency | "Religious liberty" applied selectively; less concern about other groups' rights |
| Goalpost stability | Moderate; priorities shift based on political alignment |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate; strong alignment with Republican positions |

**Justification:** Religious Right concerns about campaign finance include genuine worries about government power and donor harassment (some religious donors have faced boycotts). However, the consistent alignment with Republican donor interests and minimal engagement with corruption concerns suggest mixed motivations. Religious teachings about justice and the poor would seem to support limiting plutocratic influence, but this is rarely emphasized.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 4/10 | Some concern about corruption but frames as overblown; emphasizes religious liberty threats |
| Root Cause Agreement | 3/10 | Disputes analysis; sees secular government overreach as bigger problem |

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Small-Dollar Matching | 3/10 | "Government funding of campaigns is problematic" | May fund candidates opposed to religious values |
| Democracy Vouchers | 3/10 | "Same concerns as matching" | Government involvement in politics |
| Clean Elections | 2/10 | "Government control of political speech" | Could restrict religious political activity |
| DISCLOSE Act | 3/10 | "Threatens religious donors with harassment" | Exposure of religious organization donations |
| FEC Reform | 4/10 | "Could be weaponized against faith groups" | Fear of biased enforcement |
| Constitutional Amendment | 2/10 | "Threatens First Amendment protections for religious speech" | Religious speech protected by current doctrine |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Democracy For All Amendment | 2/10 | "Could restrict religious political speech" | First Amendment protection essential |
| We The People Amendment | 2/10 | "Threatens religious organization rights" | Churches could lose political voice |
| DISCLOSE Act | 3/10 | "Needs religious exemptions" | Donor harassment concerns |
| Government By The People Act | 3/10 | "Taxpayer funding of objectionable campaigns" | Could fund candidates opposed to religious values |
| FEC Reform Act | 4/10 | "Needs protections against targeting religious groups" | Enforcement concerns |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Protect religious organization political speech
- Exemptions for religious donors from disclosure
- Focus on actual corruption, not political activity
- Preserve current First Amendment protections
- State-level solutions respecting religious liberty

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative, Constitutionalist
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (on anti-elite themes)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist, Liberal

---

### Democratic Socialist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Consistent structural critique; applies equally to Democratic establishment |
| Principle consistency | Uniform application of anti-corporate principles |
| Goalpost stability | Long-term vision maintained |
| Zero-sum behavior | None; focuses on class analysis regardless of party |

**Justification:** Democratic socialist critique of money in politics is fundamental to their worldview—capitalism produces inequality that distorts democracy. This analysis is applied consistently, including criticism of corporate Democrats. Bernie Sanders's consistent rejection of Super PAC money and corporate donations demonstrates genuine commitment. No evidence of bad faith; positions follow directly from stated principles.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 10/10 | Full agreement; would emphasize class and capitalist dimensions more |
| Root Cause Agreement | 10/10 | Strong agreement; sees this as symptom of capitalist political economy |

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Small-Dollar Matching | 8/10 | "Good but should be more generous" | Would push for higher ratios |
| Democracy Vouchers | 9/10 | "Democratizes political participation" | Equalizes voice |
| Clean Elections | 10/10 | "Full public financing is the goal" | Eliminates private money entirely |
| DISCLOSE Act | 7/10 | "Necessary but not sufficient" | Doesn't address root problem |
| FEC Reform | 8/10 | "Needed for enforcement" | Infrastructure for change |
| Constitutional Amendment | 10/10 | "Essential for real democracy" | Enables transformative reform |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Democracy For All Amendment | 10/10 | "First step to real democracy" | Enables comprehensive reform |
| We The People Amendment | 10/10 | "Addresses corporate power at root" | Preferred comprehensive approach |
| DISCLOSE Act | 7/10 | "Supportable but incomplete" | Transparency alone doesn't change power |
| Government By The People Act | 8/10 | "Move in right direction" | Would strengthen and expand |
| FEC Reform Act | 8/10 | "Makes enforcement possible" | Necessary infrastructure |

#### Alternative Proposals

- Complete public financing (no private money)

| **Disclosure/Transparency** | DISCLOSE Act (Lib, Prog, Libt, Pop, Cent, DemSoc) | — | Con, Const, RelR |
| **FEC Enforcement** | FEC Reform (Lib, Prog, Pop, Cent, DemSoc) | Libt (mixed) | Con, Const, RelR |
| **Small-Dollar Matching** | (Lib, Prog, Pop, Cent, DemSoc) | — | Con, Libt, Const, RelR |
| **Democracy Vouchers** | (Lib, Prog, Pop, DemSoc) | Cent, Libt (mixed) | Con, Const, RelR |
| **Full Public Financing** | (Prog, DemSoc) | Lib, Pop | Con, Libt, Const, Cent, RelR |
| **Constitutional Amendment** | (Prog, DemSoc) | Lib, Pop | Con, Libt, Const, Cent, RelR |

**Key insight:** Transparency reforms have the broadest coalition potential (6 perspectives). Public financing has 5-perspective support among the good-faith majority. Constitutional amendment faces opposition from 5 perspectives, making it a long-term goal requiring significant political realignment.

## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: Transparency-First Reform

**Bridges:** Liberal + Libertarian + Populist + Centrist + Conservative (partial)

**Core Agreement:** Voters deserve to know who funds political ads; transparency enables accountability.

**Policy Description:**

Enhanced DISCLOSE Act with protections:

- Full disclosure of donors over $5,000 to any political organization
- Real-time electronic reporting
- Clear disclaimers on all political advertising
- Privacy protections for donors under threshold
- Strong penalties for foreign money violations

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Liberal | Exposes dark money funding opposition |
| Libertarian | Transparency without spending limits; information solution |
| Populist | "Exposes the swamp" - anti-elite transparency |
| Centrist | Practical, bipartisan, achievable reform |
| Conservative | No spending limits; protects small donors |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Liberal | No spending limits in this package |
| Libertarian | Some mandatory disclosure they'd prefer voluntary |
| Populist | Doesn't directly limit elite money |
| Centrist | May want more comprehensive reform |
| Conservative | Donor exposure for large contributions |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 5/9 perspectives (6/9 if Libertarian fully on board)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 4/5 coalition members rated 4+ faith
- **Durability:** High—disclosure has survived court challenges
- **Implementation Path:** Legislation requiring simple majority if filibuster reformed; potentially 60 votes given bipartisan appeal

---

### Compromise 2: State-Level Public Financing Laboratory

**Bridges:** Centrist + Liberal + Populist + Constitutionalist (partial) + Progressive (partial)

**Core Agreement:** Let states experiment with public financing; what works can inform federal policy.

**Policy Description:**

Federal grants to states that implement qualifying public financing programs:

- Matching funds or voucher programs at state discretion
- Federal standards for anti-fraud and disclosure
- Evaluation and best practices sharing
- No mandate on state participation
- Funding through voluntary tax checkoff

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Centrist | Evidence-based, incremental, learns from experiments |
| Liberal | Advances public financing goal |
| Populist | Empowers regular people at community level |
| Constitutionalist | Respects federalism; no federal mandate |
| Progressive | Building blocks for comprehensive reform |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Centrist | May want faster federal action |
| Liberal | Delayed national public financing |
| Populist | Patchwork rather than uniform system |
| Constitutionalist | Some federal involvement (grants) |
| Progressive | Falls short of comprehensive vision |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 5/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 5/5 coalition members rated 4+ faith
- **Durability:** High—federalism respected
- **Implementation Path:** Could attract bipartisan support; federalism framing may draw some conservatives

---

### Compromise 3: Anti-Corruption Enforcement Package

**Bridges:** Populist + Liberal + Progressive + Centrist + Democratic Socialist

**Core Agreement:** Whatever the rules are, they should be enforced; corruption should be punished.

**Policy Description:**

FEC Reform plus enhanced enforcement:

- Restructure FEC to enable majority action
- Increase penalties for violations
- Faster investigation and resolution
- Independent enforcement division
- Whistleblower protections and rewards

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Populist | "Finally enforcing the rules against the swamp" |
| Liberal | Enables enforcement of existing laws |
| Progressive | Infrastructure for comprehensive reform |
| Centrist | Practical good-government reform |
| Democratic Socialist | Holds powerful actors accountable |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Populist | Doesn't directly change rules |
| Liberal | No new substantive restrictions |
| Progressive | Incomplete without new rules to enforce |
| Centrist | May want less aggressive enforcement |
| Democratic Socialist | Incremental rather than transformative |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 5/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 5/5 coalition members rated 4+ faith
- **Durability:** Medium—enforcement depends on political will
- **Implementation Path:** Could be bipartisan if framed as good government; less threatening than new rules

## Strategic Implications

### Most Viable Coalition

**Liberal + Progressive + Democratic Socialist + Populist + Centrist** form the core reform coalition (5 perspectives, all rated 4+ faith). This coalition can pass significant reforms if it achieves electoral success and reforms the filibuster.

**Adding Libertarians** on disclosure-only proposals could create a 6-perspective supermajority for transparency reforms.

### Key Obstacles

1. **Senate filibuster** prevents majority rule on reform legislation
2. **Supreme Court doctrine** limits what legislation can achieve
3. **Conservative/Constitutionalist/Religious Right bloc** (3 perspectives) provides consistent opposition
4. **Mixed faith actors** use constitutional and free speech arguments to protect donor interests

### Bad Faith Actors

The three "mixed faith" perspectives (Conservative, Constitutionalist, Religious Right) share:

- Convenient alignment between stated principles and donor interests
- Selective application of constitutional principles
- Shifting positions over time (e.g., disclosure once supported, now opposed)

**Strategy for handling:**

1. **Expose inconsistencies** publicly (e.g., corporate personhood is judicial invention)
2. **Separate genuine from strategic actors** within these perspectives
3. **Build momentum through state-level wins** that demonstrate reform is popular
4. **Focus on disclosure** where even bad-faith opposition is harder to sustain

### Recommended Approach

1. **Immediate priority:** DISCLOSE Act or equivalent transparency reform—broadest possible coalition, constitutional, exposes opposition
2. **Near-term:** State-level public financing expansion; build evidence base
3. **Medium-term:** FEC reform to enable enforcement
4. **Long-term:** Constitutional amendment through movement building

**Sequence matters:** Disclosure exposes who benefits from status quo, building support for public financing. Enforcement makes rules meaningful. Constitutional amendment requires sustained public pressure built through earlier wins.
