# Campaign Finance: Current State

## The Problem Today

### A Post-Citizens United Landscape

The 2010 Citizens United decision fundamentally transformed American political finance. By ruling that corporations and unions have First Amendment rights to spend unlimited amounts on political speech, the Supreme Court opened floodgates that have drowned out ordinary citizens' voices.

**Before Citizens United (2010)**

- Corporate and union independent expenditures banned
- Clear limits on political spending
- More transparency in funding sources
- Still imperfect, but regulated

**After Citizens United**

- Unlimited corporate and union spending
- Super PACs can raise and spend without limit
- Dark money channels largely untraceable
- Spending has exploded exponentially

### The Current Money Flow

## Key Statistics (2024 snapshot)

### Money in Federal Elections

| Election Cycle | Total Spending | Presidential | Congressional |
|----------------|----------------|--------------|---------------|
| 2008 | $5.3 billion | $2.8 billion | $2.5 billion |
| 2012 | $6.3 billion | $2.6 billion | $3.7 billion |
| 2016 | $6.5 billion | $2.4 billion | $4.1 billion |
| 2020 | $14.4 billion | $5.7 billion | $8.7 billion |

### Outside Spending Explosion

| Category | 2008 | 2020 | Increase |
|----------|------|------|----------|
| Super PAC spending | N/A | $2.0+ billion | ∞ (didn't exist) |
| Dark money | ~$70 million | $1.0+ billion | 1,400%+ |
| Total outside spending | $338 million | $3.0+ billion | 800%+ |

### Who's Giving (as of 2020)

**Large Donors Dominate**

| Donor Size | Share of Contributions |
|------------|------------------------|
| Donations over $200 | ~70% of itemized |
| Top 100 donors | ~10% of all contributions |
| Top 0.01% of population | ~40% of total giving |
| Small donors (<$200) | ~30% (growing) |

**Donor Pool is Tiny**

- Only about 0.5% of Americans donate more than $200
- Only about 0.01% are major donors ($10,000+)
- Elite donors have vastly disproportionate influence

### Fundraising Time Burden (2024 snapshot)

**House Members**

- Expected to raise $10,000-$18,000+ per day
- 4+ hours daily on fundraising calls
- 30-50% of work time spent raising money
- Less time for constituent service and legislating

**Senators**

- Must raise $15-30+ million for competitive race
- 2-4 hours daily on fundraising
- 6-year terms allow some respite but constant pressure
- Safe-seat senators still must help party fundraise

### Winner's Financial Advantage

| Race Type | % Times Top Spender Won |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| House races (open seat) | ~85% |
| House races (all) | ~90% |
| Senate races (open seat) | ~80% |
| Senate races (all) | ~85% |

Money doesn't guarantee victory, but underfunded candidates rarely win competitive races.

### 2024 Cycle Snapshot

- The 2024 federal election cycle set a new spending high, with preliminary OpenSecrets/FEC tallies exceeding the 2020 benchmark and still climbing as final reports are compiled.* 
- Outside/independent expenditures continued to be dominated by super PACs and 501(c)(4) “dark money” groups, despite renewed calls for disclosure. 
- Small-dollar donors and online fundraising platforms expanded their share, but the same narrow donor pool still determines a majority of funding.

## The Legal Framework

### What's Currently Allowed

| Activity | Legal Status | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| Individual contributions to candidates | Limited | $3,300/candidate/election (2024) |
| Individual contributions to parties | Limited | Higher limits to party committees |
| Individual contributions to Super PACs | **Unlimited** | No caps whatsoever |
| Corporate contributions to candidates | Banned | Direct contributions prohibited |
| Corporate contributions to Super PACs | **Unlimited** | Can give any amount |
| Super PAC spending | **Unlimited** | Must be "independent" of campaigns |
| 501(c)(4) political spending | **Unlimited** | Primary purpose must be "social welfare" |
| Disclosure of donors | Varies | Required for candidates/PACs, not 501(c)(4)s |

### What's Currently Banned (Mostly)

| Activity | Status | Loopholes |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Direct corporate donations to candidates | Banned | Can fund Super PACs instead |
| Foreign national contributions | Banned | Enforcement weak; shell companies exist |
| Coordination between candidates and Super PACs | Banned | "Independence" definition weak |
| Quid pro quo corruption | Banned | Hard to prove; rarely prosecuted |

## Impact Analysis

### On Candidates

**The Fundraising Treadmill**

- Must begin fundraising immediately after election
- Winners must help colleagues fundraise
- Policy positions shaped by donor preferences
- Time away from constituents and legislating

**Who Can Run**

- Self-funders have major advantage
- Candidates need donor network access
- Incumbents have built-in advantage
- Outsiders face steep fundraising climb

### On Policy Outcomes

**Research Findings**

- Gilens & Page (2014): Economic elite preferences predict policy; average citizen preferences do not
- Policy on economic issues tracks donor opinion
- Policies with broad public support often blocked if opposed by donors
- Tax policy, financial regulation especially affected

**Examples of Donor-Favorable Policy**

- Carried interest loophole preserved
- Pharmaceutical companies protected from Medicare negotiation
- Financial deregulation despite public opposition
- Estate tax cuts despite public support for taxing wealthy

### On Political Participation

**Citizen Disengagement**

- 77% believe money has too much influence
- Perception that system is rigged discourages participation
- Small donors feel their contributions don't matter
- Cynicism about whether representatives care

**Unequal Voice**

- Wealthy citizens have direct access to politicians
- Fundraising events are venues for influence
- Policy ideas from donors get hearing
- Average citizens' policy preferences ignored

### On Democratic Legitimacy

**Representation Gap**

- Elected officials responsive to donors, not constituents
- Policy outcomes don't reflect public opinion
- Trust in government at historic lows
- Perception of corruption (accurate or not) widespread

## Recent Developments

### 2024 Election Trends

**Record-Breaking Spending**

- Total spending doubled from 2016
- Small-donor fundraising grew substantially
- Super PAC spending continued to climb
- Dark money reached new heights

**ActBlue Revolution**

- Democratic small-donor platform raised $10+ billion since 2004
- 2020: $1.5+ billion in small donations
- Enabled grassroots fundraising at scale
- Republicans building WinRed equivalent

### FEC Dysfunction

**Enforcement Collapse**

- FEC regularly deadlocked (needs 4 of 6 commissioners)
- Complaints languish for years
- Penalties minimal when assessed
- De facto lack of enforcement

**Structural Problems**

- Partisan appointments guarantee gridlock
- Commissioners serve past terms, blocking new appointments
- Agency underfunded and understaffed
- Rules haven't kept up with technology

### Dark Money Innovations

**New Channels**

- LLCs used to hide donors
- Chains of nonprofits obscure sources
- "Pop-up" Super PACs appear and disappear
- Cryptocurrency creating new opacity

**Disclosure Avoidance**

- Donors give to 501(c)(4), which gives to Super PAC
- Original donor hidden from disclosure
- Legal, but undermines transparency
- Growing rapidly

### State-Level Developments

**Reform Progress**

| State | Reform | Status |
|-------|--------|--------|
| Seattle | Democracy vouchers | Implemented 2017 |
| Maine | Clean elections program | Active |
| Arizona | Clean elections program | Active but weakened |
| New York City | 8:1 public matching | Expanded |
| Connecticut | Citizens Election Program | Active |

**Challenges**

- Some states weakening disclosure
- Court challenges to reforms
- State laws can't address federal elections
- Preemption issues in some states

### Congressional Action (or Inaction)

**For the People Act (H.R. 1)**

- Passed House (2019, 2021)
- Includes disclosure requirements, public financing
- Blocked in Senate by filibuster
- Model for potential future reform

**DISCLOSE Act**

- Would require disclosure of large donors
- Repeatedly blocked by Senate Republicans
- Strong public support
- Narrow focus could attract bipartisan support

**Constitutional Amendment Efforts**

- Multiple proposals to overturn Citizens United
- None have achieved required 2/3 vote
- Would need ratification by 3/4 of states
- Long-term goal for reform movement

## Current Reform Landscape

### Active Campaigns

**National Level**

- End Citizens United (Democratic-aligned)
- Issue One (bipartisan)
- RepresentUs (anti-corruption focus)
- Common Cause (comprehensive reform)
- Brennan Center (research and advocacy)

**State and Local**

- Campaigns for public financing
- Ballot initiatives for disclosure
- Challenges to dark money
- City-level experiments

### Public Opinion (2024 snapshot)

| Issue | Support |
|-------|---------|
| Limit campaign spending | 77% |
| Overturn Citizens United | 66% |
| Require disclosure | 88% |
| Public financing | Mixed (depends on framing) |

Bipartisan agreement that money is problem; disagreement on solutions.

## Key Takeaways

1. **Money has exploded**: Spending has more than doubled since Citizens United
2. **Dark money growing**: Untraceable funds increasingly dominate
3. **Small donor participation rising**: But still dwarfed by large donors
4. **FEC is broken**: Effectively no enforcement of existing rules
5. **Policy reflects donors**: Research shows systematic bias toward wealthy interests
6. **Public wants reform**: Strong majorities support change
7. **Solutions blocked**: Federal legislation stalled; Supreme Court hostile
8. **State/local progress**: Some reform success at lower levels
