# Campaign Finance: Overview

## Executive Summary

Money dominates American politics in ways that corrupt democratic representation. Wealthy donors and special interests exercise disproportionate influence over elections and policy, while ordinary citizens' voices are drowned out. The Supreme Court's Citizens United decision and subsequent rulings have dismantled campaign finance regulations, leading to unlimited spending by corporations, unions, and wealthy individuals through Super PACs and dark money organizations. This system creates a pay-to-play democracy where elected officials spend more time fundraising than legislating, and where policy outcomes favor donors over constituents.

The result is a self-reinforcing cycle: wealthy interests fund campaigns, elected officials reward donors with favorable policy, donors get wealthier, and their political influence grows. Breaking this cycle requires fundamental reforms to how campaigns are funded, including public financing systems, disclosure requirements, contribution limits, and potentially constitutional amendments to overturn damaging court precedents.

## The Core Problem

### Money as Political Speech

The fundamental legal framework treats political spending as protected speech:

| Principle | Court Ruling | Effect |
|-----------|--------------|--------|
| Money = Speech | Buckley v. Valeo (1976) | Independent expenditure limits unconstitutional |
| Corporate independent expenditures | Citizens United (2010) | Corporations can spend unlimited amounts independently |
| No Super PAC limits | SpeechNow.org v. FEC (2010) | Unlimited contributions to independent groups |
| No aggregate limits | McCutcheon v. FEC (2014) | Can donate to unlimited number of candidates |

### The Practical Effect

**For Candidates**

- Must raise enormous sums to be competitive
- Spend 30-70% of time fundraising
- Become dependent on wealthy donors
- Policy positions shaped by donor preferences

**For Voters**

- Voice drowned out by big money
- Candidates responsive to donors, not constituents
- Cynicism about democratic responsiveness
- Declining participation and engagement

**For Democracy**

- Policy skews toward donor preferences
- Wealthy interests dominate agenda
- Corruption (legal and illegal) normalized
- Legitimacy of representation undermined

## By the Numbers

### Scale of Money in Politics (as of 2024)

| Metric | Amount | Trend |
|--------|--------|-------|
| 2020 presidential race | $14+ billion | Record spending |
| Average winning House race (2022) | $2+ million | Increasing |
| Average winning Senate race (2022) | $15+ million | Increasing |
| Super PAC spending (2020) | $2+ billion | Up 1000%+ since 2010 |
| Dark money (2020) | $1+ billion | Largely untraceable |

### Time Spent Fundraising (as of 2024)

| Position | Call Time Expected | % of Work Week |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| House member | 4+ hours/day | 30-50% |
| Senator | 2-4 hours/day | 20-40% |
| Party pressure | Constant | Pervasive |

### Donor Demographics (as of 2020)

| Donor Type | Share of Contributions |
|------------|------------------------|
| Donors giving $200+ | ~70% of itemized contributions |
| Top 0.01% of population | ~40% of all contributions |
| Small donors (<$200) | Growing but still minority |

## Key Concepts

### Types of Political Money

**Hard Money**: Contributions directly to candidates, subject to limits and disclosure

**Soft Money**: Contributions to parties for party-building (largely banned after 2002)

**Independent Expenditures**: Spending not coordinated with candidates (unlimited after Citizens United)

**Dark Money**: Spending by nonprofits that don't disclose donors

### Key Entities

| Entity | What It Is | Limits |
|--------|------------|--------|
| **Candidate committee** | Official campaign | Receives limited contributions |
| **PAC** | Political Action Committee | $5,000/candidate limit |
| **Super PAC** | Independent expenditure committee | Unlimited contributions, no direct donations to candidates |
| **501(c)(4)** | "Social welfare" nonprofit | Can do politics, no donor disclosure |
| **527** | Political organization | Various restrictions depending on type |

### Key Legal Principles

- **Corruption (contributions)**: Quid pro quo corruption and its appearance justify contribution limits
- **Corruption (independent expenditures)**: Only quid pro quo corruption recognized; appearance rejected in Citizens United
- **Independence**: If spending isn't "coordinated," it's considered independent and unlimited
- **Disclosure**: Generally upheld, but with significant loopholes

### The Influence Cycle

1. **Campaign**: Donors fund candidates
2. **Election**: Funded candidates win more often
3. **Governance**: Elected officials serve donors' interests
4. **Policy**: Laws benefit donors
5. **Wealth**: Donors get wealthier
6. **Return to Step 1**: More money to donate

## Why This Matters

### For Democratic Representation

When money determines who can run, who wins, and what policies pass, democracy becomes responsive to wealth rather than citizens. The fundamental promise of equal representation is broken.

### For Policy Outcomes

Research consistently shows policy aligns more with donor preferences than voter preferences, particularly on economic issues. This explains policy outcomes that seem to defy public opinion.

### For Political Trust

Americans across the political spectrum believe money corrupts politics. This perception—accurate or not—undermines faith in democratic institutions and encourages disengagement.

### For Reform Strategy

Understanding campaign finance is essential for all other reforms. Money influences electoral reform, redistricting, voting rights, and every other political issue. Reform must address how money shapes politics.
