# Campaign Finance: Overview

Money dominates American politics in ways that corrupt democratic representation. Wealthy donors and special interests exercise disproportionate influence over elections and policy, while ordinary citizens' voices are drowned out. The Supreme Court's Citizens United decision and subsequent rulings have dismantled campaign finance regulations, leading to unlimited spending by corporations, unions, and wealthy individuals through Super PACs and dark money organizations. This system creates a pay-to-play democracy where elected officials spend more time fundraising than legislating, and where policy outcomes favor donors over constituents.
