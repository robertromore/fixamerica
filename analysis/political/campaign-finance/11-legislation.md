# Campaign Finance: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Campaign finance reform requires navigating significant constitutional constraints established by *Citizens United v. FEC* and related cases. This document provides draft legislation that works within current doctrine (disclosure, public financing) while also presenting constitutional amendment text to enable more comprehensive reform.

## Constitutional Amendments

### Democracy For All Amendment

**Purpose**: Overturn *Citizens United v. FEC* (2010) and *Buckley v. Valeo* (1976) to allow Congress and states to regulate campaign spending and establish that constitutional rights belong to natural persons.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. To advance democratic self-government and political
equality, and to protect the integrity of government and the
electoral process, Congress and the States may regulate and set
reasonable limits on the raising and spending of money by
candidates and others to influence elections.

SECTION 2. Congress and the States shall have power to implement
and enforce this article by appropriate legislation, and may
distinguish between natural persons and corporations or other
artificial entities created by law, including by prohibiting
such entities from spending money to influence elections.

SECTION 3. Nothing in this article shall be construed to grant
Congress or the States the power to abridge the freedom of the
press.

```text

**Explanation**:

- **Section 1**: Reverses *Buckley*'s holding that spending limits are unconstitutional. "Reasonable limits" provides flexibility while preventing unlimited suppression.

- **Section 2**: Reverses *Citizens United* by allowing different treatment of corporations. "May... prohibiting" allows but does not mandate corporate spending bans.

- **Section 3**: Preserves press freedom—a key concern of opponents who fear speech suppression.

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Too broad | "Reasonable limits" constrains scope |
| Chills speech | Press freedom explicitly protected |
| Ratification difficult | 22 states have called for amendment |

**Refinements**:

- **Stronger version**: "Congress and the States shall regulate" (mandatory)
- **Fallback version**: Address only corporate spending, not all limits
- **Clarification**: Add "including but not limited to contributions and independent expenditures"

### We The People Amendment

**Purpose**: More comprehensive approach addressing both corporate personhood and money-as-speech.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. The rights protected by the Constitution of the United
States are the rights of natural persons only.

Artificial entities, such as corporations, limited liability
companies, and other entities established by the laws of any
State, the United States, or any foreign state shall have no
rights under this Constitution and are subject to regulation
by the People, through Federal, State, or local law.

The privileges of artificial entities shall be determined by
the People, through Federal, State, or local law, and shall
not be construed to be inherent or inalienable.

SECTION 2. Federal, State, and local government shall regulate,
limit, or prohibit contributions and expenditures, including a
candidate's own contributions and expenditures, to ensure that
all citizens, regardless of their economic status, have access
to the political process, and that no person gains, as a result
of that person's money, substantially more access or ability to
influence in any way the election of any candidate for public
office or any ballot measure.

Federal, State, and local government shall require that any
permissible contributions and expenditures be publicly disclosed.

The judiciary shall not construe the spending of money to
influence elections to be speech under the First Amendment.

SECTION 3. Nothing contained in this amendment shall be construed
to abridge the freedom of the press.

```text

**Explanation**: More comprehensive than Democracy For All Amendment—explicitly addresses money as speech, corporate personhood, and requires public disclosure.

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Overreach on corporate rights | Only affects constitutional rights, not statutory |
| Too detailed for Constitution | Comprehensive approach prevents loopholes |
| Press freedom concerns | Section 3 protection |

## Federal Legislation

### DISCLOSE Act

**Purpose**: Require disclosure of donors to Super PACs, close dark money loopholes, and provide voters with information about who funds political ads.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Democracy Is Strengthened by
Casting Light On Spending in Elections Act" or the "DISCLOSE Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Campaign-related spending by outside organizations has
    increased dramatically since the Supreme Court's decision
    in Citizens United v. FEC.
(2) Much of this spending is funded by donors whose identities
    are not disclosed to voters.
(3) The Supreme Court in Citizens United emphasized that
    "transparency enables the electorate to make informed
    decisions and give proper weight to different speakers
    and messages."
(4) Current disclosure requirements contain loopholes that
    allow donors to remain anonymous.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:

    any corporation, labor organization, or political organization
    (as defined in section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code)

    disbursement" means a disbursement for—

(a) IN GENERAL.—A covered organization that makes campaign-related
    disbursements aggregating more than $10,000 in a calendar year

    file with the Federal Election Commission a statement containing—
    (1) the name and address of the covered organization;
    (2) the amount of each campaign-related disbursement;
    (3) the election to which the disbursement relates; and
    (4) the name and address of each person who contributed
        an aggregate amount of $10,000 or more to such organization
        during the period beginning on the first day of the
        preceding calendar year.

(b) DISCLOSURE DATE.—For purposes of this section, a disclosure
    date is—
    (1) the first date on which the covered organization makes
        campaign-related disbursements aggregating more than
        $10,000; and
    (2) any subsequent date on which the covered organization
        makes campaign-related disbursements aggregating more
        than $10,000 since the most recent disclosure date.

```text

**Explanation**:

- **Section 3**: Covers "covered transfers" to prevent routing money through intermediaries.
- **Section 4**: Real-time (24-hour) disclosure of significant contributions.
- **Section 5**: Visible disclaimer so voters know who funds ads.
- **Section 7**: Closes shell company loophole.

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| First Amendment concerns | *Citizens United* upheld disclosure |
| Donor harassment | Disclosure is for organizations, not individuals under $10K |
| Enforcement | Requires FEC reform to ensure compliance |

### Government By The People Act

**Purpose**: Establish a federal small-dollar matching program for congressional candidates, modeled on successful state programs.

```text

**Explanation**:

- **Section 3**: Democracy voucher program allowing every voter to participate.
- **Section 4**: 6:1 matching amplifies small contributions (NYC uses 8:1).
- **Section 5**: Tax credit encourages participation even for non-participating candidates.
- **Section 4(f)**: Self-funding through fines avoids budget objections.

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Cost | Funded by fines, optional checkoff |
| Doesn't limit outside spending | Correct—that requires amendment |
| Candidates won't participate | High match ratio makes it attractive |

### FEC Reform Act

**Purpose**: Restructure the Federal Election Commission to enable effective enforcement of campaign finance laws.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Federal Election Commission Reform Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The Federal Election Commission is structured to produce
    deadlock, with an even number of commissioners and a
    requirement of four votes for any action.
(2) The FEC has failed to enforce campaign finance laws,
    allowing widespread violations.
(3) The FEC is chronically underfunded and understaffed.
(4) Other regulatory agencies with odd numbers of commissioners
    function more effectively.

SEC. 3. RESTRUCTURING.

(a) NUMBER OF COMMISSIONERS.—Section 306(a)(1) of the Federal
    Election Campaign Act (52 U.S.C. 30106(a)(1)) is amended by
    striking "6 members" and inserting "5 members".

(b) PARTISAN BALANCE.—Such section is further amended by adding:
    "Not more than 2 members shall be affiliated with the same
    political party. At least 1 member shall not be affiliated
    with any political party and shall serve as Chair."

    "Members shall have demonstrated expertise in election law,
    ethics, or election administration and shall not have held
    any position with a political party, political committee,

wherever it appears.

SEC. 5. INDEPENDENT ENFORCEMENT DIVISION.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—There is established within the Commission
    an Office of Independent Enforcement, headed by a Director
    appointed by the Chair with the concurrence of the Commission.

    (2) issue subpoenas for documents and testimony;
    (3) negotiate consent decrees subject to Commission approval;
    (4) refer matters for prosecution.

(c) INDEPENDENCE.—The Director may only be removed for cause.

SEC. 6. PENALTIES.

(a) CIVIL PENALTIES.—The maximum civil penalty for knowing and
    willful violations is increased from $50,000 to $250,000 or
    200% of the amount involved, whichever is greater.

    imprisonment for knowing and willful violations from 5 to
    10 years.

SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

(3) such sums as may be necessary for subsequent fiscal years.

SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on January 1 following enactment.
Current commissioners shall complete their terms; vacancies
shall be filled under the new structure.

```text

**Explanation**:

- **Section 3**: Five commissioners (2-2-1) breaks partisan deadlock.
- **Section 3(c)**: Qualifications prevent commissioners who are party operatives.
- **Section 5**: Independent enforcement removes politics from investigations.
- **Section 7**: Triple funding enables actual enforcement.

**Potential Challenges**:

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Partisan enforcement | Independent chair, qualified commissioners |
| Constitutional concerns | Similar structures used in other agencies |
| Current commissioners | Grandfathered until terms expire |

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Current Doctrine**:

| Case | Holding | Implication |
|------|---------|-------------|
| *Buckley v. Valeo* (1976) | Spending limits unconstitutional | Can limit contributions, not spending |
| *Citizens United v. FEC* (2010) | Corporate independent spending protected | Super PACs, dark money enabled |
| *McCutcheon v. FEC* (2014) | Aggregate limits unconstitutional | Unlimited total giving |
| *Buckley* et al. | Disclosure constitutional | DISCLOSE Act survives |
| *Davis v. FEC* (2008) | Rescue funds unconstitutional | Clean Elections limited |

**Working Within Doctrine**:

- Disclosure: Broadly constitutional
- Public financing: Constitutional if voluntary
- Contribution limits: Constitutional with compelling interest
- Spending limits: Unconstitutional (requires amendment)

### Enforcement Mechanisms

| Law | Enforcement |
|-----|-------------|
| DISCLOSE Act | FEC civil enforcement, DOJ criminal referral |
| Government By The People Act | FEC administration, IRS for tax credit |
| FEC Reform Act | Restructured FEC with independent enforcement |
| State laws | State election agencies |

### Sunset and Review Provisions

**Recommended**:

- GAO study of public financing effectiveness every 4 years
- Inflation adjustment for contribution limits and matching caps
- Reauthorization of appropriations every 6 years
- Commission review of disclosure thresholds

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### DISCLOSE Act

**Potential Loopholes**:

| Loophole | How Exploited | Severity |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| $10,000 threshold | Structure donations at $9,999 to avoid disclosure | High |
| Covered transfer definition | Create complex corporate chains to obscure ultimate donor | High |
| 24-hour reporting gaps | Time contributions strategically during reporting gaps | Medium |
| Foreign subsidiary ambiguity | U.S. subsidiaries of foreign companies may donate | High |
| "Issue advocacy" exemption | Reframe electoral ads as issue education | Medium |
| Disclaimer size/duration | Make disclaimers technically compliant but unreadable | Medium |

**Shortcomings**:

| Issue | Description | Impact |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Doesn't limit spending | Only disclosure; unlimited money still flows | Significant |
| No real-time for small donors | Only large donations get rapid disclosure | Moderate |
| Enforcement depends on FEC | Dysfunctional FEC won't enforce | Critical |
| State/local gap | Only covers federal elections | Moderate |
| Cryptocurrency blind spot | Digital currencies may evade tracking | Growing |

**Rectification Procedures**:

| Issue | Rectification Approach |
|-------|----------------------|
| Threshold gaming | Lower threshold to $5,000; require cumulative tracking across entities |
| Corporate chains | Require disclosure of all entities in ownership chain; beneficial ownership database |
| Foreign subsidiary loophole | Prohibit contributions from any entity with >5% foreign ownership |
| Issue advocacy | Expand "electioneering communication" definition; function-based test |
| FEC dysfunction | Pair with FEC Reform Act; create independent enforcement office |
| Cryptocurrency | Require wallet disclosure; ban anonymous crypto donations |

### Government By The People Act

**Potential Loopholes**:

| Loophole | How Exploited | Severity |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| Opt-out exploitation | Well-funded candidates skip public financing, outspend participants | High |
| Voucher fraud | Collect vouchers from disengaged voters fraudulently | Medium |
| Matching fund timing | Delay small donations until match is most valuable | Low |
| "Volunteer" spending | Wealthy supporters provide "volunteer" services worth millions | Medium |
| Coordinated "independent" expenditures | Technically independent spending coordinated informally | High |

**Shortcomings**:

| Issue | Description | Impact |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Doesn't affect outside spending | Super PACs can still spend unlimited amounts | Critical |
| Voluntary participation | Candidates can reject limits, take unlimited contributions | Significant |
| Primary focus missing | Matching most valuable in general; primaries may be uncompetitive | Moderate |
| Incumbent advantage remains | Name recognition worth more than matching funds | Moderate |
| Administrative complexity | Voucher distribution, verification is complex | Moderate |

**Rectification Procedures**:

| Issue | Rectification Approach |
|-------|----------------------|
| Outside spending | Constitutional amendment only real solution; in meantime, enhance disclosure |
| Opt-out problem | Increase matching ratio (9:1 or higher); add "rescue" mechanism if constitutional |
| Voucher fraud | Require identity verification; limit vouchers per household; audit trail |
| Primary weakness | Higher matching ratios for primary elections; earlier distribution |
| Coordination loopholes | Expand coordination definition; increase penalties |
| Administration | Centralized federal system; electronic vouchers via tax filing |

### FEC Reform Act

**Potential Loopholes**:

| Loophole | How Exploited | Severity |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| Commissioner qualifications | Partisan operatives could technically meet criteria | Medium |
| Independent chair manipulation | Chair selection process could be gamed | Medium |
| Removal "for cause" interpretation | Broad interpretation could enable political removal | High |
| Budget dependence | Congress could starve agency of funds | High |
| Enforcement discretion | Even odd-numbered commission could deadlock 2-2-1 | Medium |

**Shortcomings**:

| Issue | Description | Impact |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Still bipartisan requirement | Two from each major party; third parties excluded | Moderate |
| No structural independence | Still a commission, not an independent agency | Moderate |
| Historical baggage | FEC culture may resist reform | Moderate |
| Court challenges | New structure may face legal challenges | Medium |

**Rectification Procedures**:

| Issue | Rectification Approach |
|-------|----------------------|
| Commissioner gaming | Add longer cooling-off periods (10 years); Senate confirmation scrutiny |
| Chair manipulation | Require chair from unaffiliated member pool; random selection |
| Removal protection | Define "cause" explicitly; require supermajority for removal |
| Budget starvation | Automatic appropriations tied to FEC filings; constitutional budget minimum |
| Deadlock potential | Default to enforcement if no majority against; flip burden of proof |
| Independence | Consider converting to single-director agency model (like CFPB) |

### Constitutional Amendments

**Potential Loopholes**:

| Loophole | How Exploited | Severity |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| "Reasonable limits" undefined | Courts could interpret narrowly | High |
| Press freedom carve-out | Media companies could become campaign vehicles | Medium |
| State implementation variation | States could implement minimally | Medium |
| Corporation definition | New entity forms created to evade restrictions | Medium |

**Shortcomings**:

| Issue | Description | Impact |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Ratification nearly impossible | Requires supermajorities; may never pass | Critical |
| Doesn't address root causes | Money is symptom; power concentration is cause | Significant |
| Could chill legitimate speech | Overbroad enforcement possible | Moderate |
| Enforcement ambiguity | Amendment is framework; still needs implementing legislation | Moderate |

**Rectification Procedures**:

| Issue | Rectification Approach |
|-------|----------------------|
| Narrow interpretation | Include detailed implementing provisions in amendment itself |
| Press loophole | Define "press" narrowly; exclude entities primarily engaged in campaigning |
| State variation | Include minimum federal standards in amendment; floor not ceiling |
| New entity forms | Use functional test: any entity spending on elections is covered |
| Passage difficulty | Long-term movement building; state-by-state resolutions; convention option |

### State Model Legislation

**Potential Loopholes**:

| Loophole | How Exploited | Severity |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| Out-of-state spending | Federal and out-of-state PACs not covered | High |
| Local race exemption | Some programs only cover state offices | Medium |
| Qualifying contribution fraud | Fake small donations to qualify for matching | Medium |
| Spending limit circumvention | "Independent" expenditures by allies | High |

**Shortcomings**:

| Issue | Description | Impact |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| State-only scope | Federal races unaffected | Significant |
| Political vulnerability | Programs can be defunded or repealed | High |
| Patchwork coverage | Different rules across states | Moderate |

**Rectification Procedures**:

| Issue | Rectification Approach |
|-------|----------------------|
| Out-of-state spending | Coordinate with federal disclosure; reciprocal state agreements |
| Local exemption | Expand coverage to all elected offices |
| Qualifying fraud | Verification requirements; small donor attestation; audits |
| Program vulnerability | Constitutional dedication of funds; supermajority repeal requirement |

### Cross-Cutting Issues

**Systemic Vulnerabilities**:

| Vulnerability | Affects | Mitigation |
|---------------|---------|------------|
| Judicial rollback | All reforms | Careful constitutional analysis; severability clauses |
| Wealthy self-funders | Public financing | Cannot constitutionally limit; disclosure and matching help |
| Dark money adaptation | Disclosure | Continuous updating of definitions; functional approach |
| Enforcement capture | FEC/state agencies | Independent enforcement; whistleblower protections |
| Inflation erosion | Contribution limits | Automatic inflation adjustment; indexed thresholds |

**Monitoring Requirements**:

| Metric | Frequency | Entity |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Small donor participation rates | Each election | FEC, state agencies |
| Matching fund utilization | Annually | Government By The People program |
| Disclosure compliance rates | Quarterly | FEC enforcement division |
| Dark money proportion | Each cycle | Academics with FEC data |
| Enforcement action rates | Annually | GAO, inspectors general |

**Amendment Procedures**:

1. **Threshold adjustments**: Automatic inflation indexing; annual FEC review
2. **Definition updates**: Regulatory process for new entity types, technologies
3. **Enforcement gaps**: GAO biennial report; congressional hearing requirement
4. **Coordination rules**: FEC rulemaking with public comment; judicial review
5. **Program evaluation**: Independent academic review every 4 years
