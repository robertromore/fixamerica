# Campaign Finance: History

## Origins

### The Founders' Era

The Constitution is silent on campaign finance. Early American elections were relatively inexpensive affairs—candidates relied on personal networks, newspaper support, and party organizations rather than paid advertising. But corruption concerns emerged early.

**Early Practices**

- Candidates provided alcohol and food to voters ("treating")
- Wealthy candidates had inherent advantages
- Party organizations funded campaigns
- Government jobs used as rewards (patronage)

**Early Concerns**

- George Washington spent lavishly on alcohol for voters
- Concerns about buying elections voiced from the start
- Federalist vs. Anti-Federalist newspapers served as early political advertising
- Property requirements for voting already created wealth-based participation

### The Gilded Age (1870s-1900s)

Campaign finance became a major problem as industrialization created vast private fortunes:

**The Problem**

- Corporate titans funded campaigns in exchange for favorable treatment
- Railroad and banking interests dominated politics
- Mark Hanna raised millions from corporations for McKinley (1896)
- Explicit quid pro quo arrangements common

**Scandals**

- Crédit Mobilier (1872): Railroad company bribed Congress members
- Insurance industry investigations (1905): Exposed massive corporate political spending
- "Fat cat" donors expected and received favors

## Key Turning Points

### 1907: Tillman Act - First Federal Regulation

**The Law**

- Banned corporations from contributing to federal campaigns
- First federal campaign finance law
- Response to corporate dominance of McKinley era
- Named after Senator "Pitchfork Ben" Tillman

**Effect**

- Symbolic more than practical
- No enforcement mechanism
- Easily circumvented through individual executives
- Established principle that some limits are appropriate

### 1925: Federal Corrupt Practices Act

**The Law**

- Required disclosure of campaign finances
- Set spending limits for congressional races
- Covered party committees and candidates

**Limitations**

- No enforcement mechanism
- Narrow definition of covered spending
- Easily evaded through state parties
- Essentially toothless

### 1971: Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA)

**Context**

- Rising television advertising costs
- Growing concern about wealthy candidates
- Watergate scandal brewing (though law passed before)

**The Law**

- Required detailed disclosure of contributions and spending
- Set limits on media advertising
- Created voluntary public financing for presidential campaigns
- Limited self-funding by candidates

### 1974: Post-Watergate Reforms

**Context**

- Nixon campaign's secret slush fund revealed
- Corporate executives giving cash in paper bags
- Deep public anger at corruption

**The Reforms**

- Created Federal Election Commission (FEC)
- Set contribution limits ($1,000/individual to candidate)
- Set spending limits for candidates
- Established matching funds for presidential primaries
- Required robust disclosure

**This was the high-water mark of campaign finance regulation.**

### 1976: Buckley v. Valeo - Money = Speech

**The Case**

- Challenge to 1974 reforms
- Supreme Court upheld some provisions, struck others

**The Ruling**

- Contribution limits upheld (prevent corruption)
- Spending limits struck down (violate First Amendment)
- Disclosure requirements upheld
- Independent expenditures protected as speech

**The Doctrine**

> "The quantity of communication by the contributor does not increase perceptibly with the size of his contribution... [but] virtually every means of communicating ideas in today's mass society requires the expenditure of money."

**Significance**

- Established money as protected speech
- Created framework that later enabled unlimited spending
- Spending limits only acceptable if voluntary (public financing)
- Split the baby in ways that would haunt reform

### 2002: McCain-Feingold (BCRA)

**Context**

- "Soft money" loophole exploded (unlimited to parties)
- Issue ads proliferated (avoiding "express advocacy")
- McCain and Feingold built bipartisan coalition

**The Law**

- Banned soft money contributions to national parties
- Regulated "electioneering communications" (issue ads near elections)
- Raised hard money contribution limits
- "Stand by your ad" requirements

**Effect**

- Temporarily reduced soft money
- Money shifted to outside groups
- Upheld by Supreme Court in McConnell v. FEC (2003)
- Would be gutted by Citizens United

### 2010: Citizens United v. FEC - The Dam Breaks

**The Case**

- Citizens United, a nonprofit, wanted to air anti-Hillary Clinton film
- FEC said it violated electioneering communication rules
- Case reached Supreme Court

**The Ruling** (5-4)

- Corporations have First Amendment rights
- Government cannot ban corporate independent expenditures
- No evidence independent spending causes corruption
- Overturned Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce (1990)

**Key Quote** (Kennedy majority):
> "If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens, or associations of citizens, for simply engaging in political speech."

**Key Quote** (Stevens dissent):
> "The Court's ruling threatens to undermine the integrity of elected institutions across the Nation... A democracy cannot function effectively when its constituent members believe laws are being bought and sold."

### 2010: SpeechNow.org v. FEC - Super PACs Born

**The Case**

- Decided months after Citizens United
- D.C. Circuit Court applied Citizens United logic
- If independent expenditures can't corrupt, contributions to independent groups can't either

**The Ruling**

- Struck down limits on contributions to independent expenditure groups
- Created the legal framework for Super PACs
- Combined with Citizens United to allow unlimited money from unlimited sources

### 2014: McCutcheon v. FEC - Aggregate Limits Fall

**The Case**

- Challenge to aggregate contribution limits
- Previously, could only give total of ~$123,000 to all federal candidates/parties

**The Ruling** (5-4)

- Struck down aggregate limits
- Only quid pro quo corruption justifies limits
- Can now give maximum to unlimited number of candidates
- Further weakened anti-corruption rationale

## Lessons from the Past

### Lesson 1: Money Finds a Way

Every reform has been followed by new channels for money:

- Ban corporate contributions → executives give individually
- Cap contributions → soft money to parties
- Ban soft money → 527s and issue ads
- Regulate issue ads → Super PACs and dark money

**Implication**: Reforms must be comprehensive and adaptive

### Lesson 2: Enforcement Matters

Laws without enforcement are meaningless:

- 1925 law had no enforcement mechanism
- FEC has been designed to deadlock
- Penalties are often just cost of doing business

**Implication**: Reform must include robust, independent enforcement

### Lesson 3: Courts Can Undo Progress

Regulatory victories can be overturned:

- 1974 reforms partially struck down in 1976
- McCain-Feingold upheld in 2003, gutted in 2010
- Progress is not permanent

**Implication**: Constitutional amendment may be necessary for durable change

### Lesson 4: Crisis Enables Reform

Major reforms followed scandals:

- 1907: Insurance investigation, corporate dominance
- 1974: Watergate
- 2002: Enron, soft money explosion

**Implication**: Be ready with solutions when scandal creates opportunity

### Lesson 5: Bipartisan Coalition Essential

Successful reforms required cross-party support:

- McCain-Feingold: Republican McCain + Democrat Feingold
- 1974 reforms: Post-Watergate consensus

**Implication**: Frame reform as anti-corruption, not partisan advantage

### Lesson 6: Public Financing Can Work

Presidential public financing worked for decades:

- 1976-2008: Most candidates used system
- Reduced fundraising burden
- Broke down when limits became too low

**Implication**: Public financing is viable but must be adequate and updated

## Historical Parallels

### Gilded Age vs. Today

| Then | Now |
|------|-----|
| Railroad barons dominated | Tech and finance billionaires dominate |
| Explicit corruption common | Legal corruption through Super PACs |
| Progressive Era response | Reform movement growing |
| Constitutional amendments resulted (16th, 17th) | Constitutional amendment sought |

### Post-Watergate vs. Post-Citizens United

| 1974 | 2010+ |
|------|-------|
| Scandal drove reform | Court ruling drove deregulation |
| Bipartisan consensus for limits | Partisan split on reform |
| FEC created to enforce | FEC effectively broken |
| Public financing expanded | Public financing declined |

## What History Teaches

1. **Regulation is possible**: We've had stronger rules before
2. **Court doctrine is malleable**: Buckley wasn't always the law; Citizens United wasn't inevitable
3. **Public pressure works**: Scandals create reform windows
4. **Comprehensive approach needed**: Piecemeal reform invites circumvention
5. **Vigilance required**: Progress can be reversed
