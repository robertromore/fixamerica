# Campaign Finance: Solutions

## Guiding Principles

### Criteria for Evaluating Reforms

| Criterion | Definition | Why It Matters |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| **Reduces donor dependence** | Candidates can win without big donors | Frees officials to represent all constituents |
| **Increases transparency** | Public knows who funds campaigns | Accountability and informed voting |
| **Amplifies small donors** | Average citizens' contributions matter | Democratizes influence |
| **Survives legal challenge** | Consistent with current doctrine | Actually implementable |
| **Enforceable** | Can be monitored and violations punished | Rules without enforcement are meaningless |
| **Achievable** | Politically viable to pass | Perfect solutions that can't pass don't help |

### The Tension

There's a fundamental tension in campaign finance reform:

**What We Want**: Limit the influence of money in politics
**What Courts Allow**: Only narrow anti-corruption regulations

Reforms must navigate this gap—achieving meaningful change within constitutional constraints, while building toward broader transformation.

## Policy Proposals

### Tier 1: Public Financing Systems

**Small-Dollar Matching Programs**
*How It Works*

- Government matches small donations at a multiple (e.g., 6:1)
- $100 contribution becomes $700
- Candidates must opt in and accept spending limits
- Typically matches only first $100-200 per donor

*Example: New York City*

- 8:1 match for first $175
- $100 → $900 for participating candidates
- Highly competitive races
- Diverse candidates can run

*Advantages*

- ✅ Amplifies small donors' voices
- ✅ Reduces dependence on big donors
- ✅ Constitutionally tested and approved
- ✅ Creates incentive for grassroots fundraising

*Disadvantages*

- ❌ Doesn't limit outside spending
- ❌ Voluntary participation may reduce uptake
- ❌ Requires ongoing public funding
- ❌ Matching ratios must be competitive

**Democracy Vouchers**
*How It Works*

- Every voter receives vouchers (e.g., $100)
- Can assign vouchers to candidates of choice
- Candidates must opt in and accept limits
- Funded by small property tax or general funds

*Example: Seattle*

- $100 in vouchers per voter (4 × $25)
- Implemented 2017
- Increased donor diversity
- More small donors participated

*Advantages*

- ✅ Every citizen can participate equally
- ✅ Most democratic approach
- ✅ Creates constituency for clean campaigns
- ✅ Increases civic engagement

*Disadvantages*

- ❌ Implementation complexity
- ❌ Fraud prevention needed
- ❌ Limited track record
- ❌ Doesn't address outside spending

**Clean Elections Programs**
*How It Works*

- Candidates receive public grant if they:
    - Collect qualifying small contributions
    - Agree to spending limits
    - Reject large donations
- Historically included "rescue funds" (extra money if outspent)

*Example: Maine and Arizona*

- Full public financing for state races
- Qualifying contributions prove viability
- Spending limits for participants
- Rescue funds struck down by courts

*Advantages*

- ✅ Eliminates fundraising entirely for participants
- ✅ Levels playing field most completely
- ✅ Proven track record

*Disadvantages*

- ❌ Rescue funds ruled unconstitutional
- ❌ May be outspent by non-participants
- ❌ Higher public cost
- ❌ Some states have weakened programs

### Tier 2: Disclosure Requirements

**DISCLOSE Act Approach**
*Key Provisions*

- Require disclosure of donors to Super PACs
- Close LLC and shell company loopholes
- Real-time disclosure of large contributions
- "Stand by your ad" requirements for outside groups

*Advantages*

- ✅ Generally constitutional (disclosure upheld)
- ✅ Lets voters know who's funding ads
- ✅ Creates accountability
- ✅ Bipartisan appeal (theoretically)

*Disadvantages*

- ❌ Doesn't limit spending
- ❌ Donors may still obscure through layers
- ❌ Information overload possible
- ❌ Blocked by Senate filibuster

**Real-Time Disclosure**
*The Change*

- Require disclosure within 24-48 hours
- Currently, disclosure can lag by months
- Digital reporting makes real-time possible

*Why It Matters*

- Delayed disclosure = information after election
- Voters need to know before voting
- Technology makes this feasible

### Tier 3: FEC Reform

**Restructure the FEC**
*Current Problem*

- 6 commissioners, 3 per party
- 4 votes needed for any action
- Guaranteed partisan gridlock
- Effectively no enforcement

*The Solution*

- Odd number of commissioners (5 or 7)
- Independent chair
- Strengthen commissioner qualifications
- Streamline enforcement process

*Alternative: Independent Enforcement*

- Create separate enforcement agency
- Prosecutorial independence
- Remove partisan deadlock
- Model on other agencies (FTC, SEC)

**Adequate Funding**
*The Problem*

- FEC chronically underfunded
- Can't hire enough staff
- Technology outdated
- Can't keep pace with violations

*The Solution*

- Increase FEC budget substantially
- Modernize technology
- Hire more investigators
- Enable proactive enforcement

### Tier 4: Constitutional Amendment

**Purpose**
Overturn Citizens United and establish that:

1. Corporations are not people with political rights
2. Money is not speech
3. Congress and states can regulate campaign spending

**Proposed Amendments**

| Amendment | Approach |
|-----------|----------|
| Democracy For All Amendment | Explicitly allows spending limits |
| We The People Amendment | Corporate personhood + money as speech |
| American Anti-Corruption Amendment (RepresentUs) | Comprehensive anti-corruption approach |

**Process**

- Requires 2/3 of House and Senate
- Then ratification by 3/4 of states
- Has never happened for campaign finance
- 20 states have called for convention

**Advantages**

- ✅ Only permanent solution
- ✅ Overcomes Supreme Court barrier
- ✅ Enables comprehensive reform

**Disadvantages**

- ❌ Extraordinarily difficult
- ❌ Requires sustained national movement
- ❌ Could take decades
- ❌ Constitutional convention risks

## Structural Reforms

### Reduce Campaign Costs

**The Logic**: If campaigns cost less, candidates need less money

**Proposals**

- Free broadcast time for candidates (use public airwaves)
- Postal discounts for campaign mail
- Public debate requirements
- Shorten campaign season

**Challenges**

- Media industry opposition
- Free speech concerns about mandates
- Candidate preference for control

### Change Incentive Structures

**Electoral Reform Connection**

- Ranked-choice voting reduces need for big spending
- Multi-member districts spread resources
- See [Electoral Reform](../electoral-reform/01-overview.md)

**Primary Reform Connection**

- Open primaries reduce extreme polarization
- Top-two/top-four systems change dynamics
- See [Primary Reform](../primary-reform/01-overview.md)

### Lobbying Reform

**The Connection**

- Campaign contributions + lobbying = influence system
- Revolving door connects donations to policy
- See [Lobbying](../lobbying/01-overview.md)

**Integrated Approach**

- Reform campaign finance AND lobbying together
- Address entire influence economy
- Close the revolving door
- Strengthen ethics rules

## What Has Worked Elsewhere

### Other Countries

| Country | System | Result |
|---------|--------|--------|
| **Canada** | Strict limits, public financing | Lower spending, competitive elections |
| **UK** | Short campaigns, spending limits | Less expensive elections |
| **Germany** | Public financing based on votes | Multi-party competition |
| **France** | Strict limits, public financing | Reduced big-donor influence |
| **Japan** | Public financing, strict limits | Changed after corruption scandals |

**Lessons**

- Campaign finance regulation is common globally
- Other democracies function with limits
- Various models can work
- American exceptionalism isn't required

### U.S. State and Local

| Jurisdiction | Reform | Results |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| **New York City** | 8:1 small-dollar matching | More diverse candidates, grassroots funding |
| **Seattle** | Democracy vouchers | Increased small-donor participation |
| **Maine** | Clean Elections | Decades of public financing experience |
| **Connecticut** | Citizens Election Program | Competitive state elections |
| **Arizona** | Clean Elections | Working despite legal challenges |
| **Los Angeles** | Public matching | Growing small-donor pool |

**Lessons**

- Public financing works in American context
- Multiple models available
- State/local success builds momentum
- Need to defend against attacks

### Historical US

**Post-Watergate (1974-2010)**

- Presidential public financing worked
- Contribution limits reduced big-donor influence
- Disclosure created accountability
- System worked until outspent by outside money

**Lessons**

- We've had stronger rules
- Reform is achievable
- Requires adaptation over time
- Court rulings changed landscape

## Trade-offs

### Public Financing Cost vs. Corruption Cost

| Factor | Public Financing | Current System |
|--------|------------------|----------------|
| Direct cost | ~$10-50 per citizen | Hidden in taxes, policy |
| Corruption cost | Minimal | Billions in unfavorable policy |
| Democratic benefit | High | Low |

**Analysis**: Public financing is extremely cost-effective when measured against cost of corrupt policy

### Disclosure vs. Privacy

| Consideration | Disclosure | Privacy |
|---------------|------------|---------|
| Accountability | High | Low |
| Voter information | High | Low |
| Chilling effect risk | Some | None |
| Current law | Generally required | Carve-outs exist |

**Analysis**: Disclosure for political spending is appropriate; some exceptions for sensitive cases

### Achievability vs. Transformation

| Reform Type | Achievability | Impact |
|-------------|---------------|--------|
| Disclosure | High | Medium |
| Small-dollar matching | Medium | Medium-High |
| Full public financing | Low-Medium | High |
| Constitutional amendment | Very Low | Transformative |

**Analysis**: Need both achievable near-term wins and work toward transformative change

### State vs. Federal

| Level | Advantages | Limitations |
|-------|------------|-------------|
| State/Local | Can pass now, build models | Can't affect federal elections |
| Federal | Uniform, comprehensive | Blocked by filibuster, courts |

**Analysis**: Pursue both simultaneously; state success builds case for federal action

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Disclosure (Immediate)

**DISCLOSE Act or State Equivalents**

- Close dark money loopholes
- Real-time reporting
- "Stand by your ad" requirements
- Achievable with simple majority (if filibuster reformed)

### Priority 2: Small-Dollar Matching (Near-Term)

**Expand NYC/Seattle Models**

- High matching ratio (6:1 or higher)
- Cover state and local races
- Build track record
- Demonstrate viability

### Priority 3: FEC Reform (Medium-Term)

**Restructure and Fund**

- Odd number of commissioners
- Independent enforcement
- Adequate budget
- Modernized technology

### Priority 4: Constitutional Amendment (Long-Term)

**Build Movement**

- State resolutions (20+ already passed)
- Continue education
- Be ready for opportunity
- Coordinate national campaign

### The Package

Comprehensive reform should include:

1. **Public financing** (small-dollar matching or vouchers)
2. **Robust disclosure** (real-time, all sources)
3. **Effective enforcement** (restructured FEC)
4. **Complementary reforms** (electoral reform, lobbying reform)
