# Political Violence: Roadmap

## Strategic Considerations

### Bipartisan Approach

Political violence response must transcend partisanship:

- Both parties have been victims
- Both have supporters who have committed violence
- Consistent standards essential for credibility
- Partisan framing undermines effectiveness

### Balancing Security and Liberty

Responses must protect both:

- Civil liberties safeguards essential
- Avoid repeating past abuses (COINTELPRO)
- Narrow focus on violence, not ideology
- Oversight and transparency

### Electoral Sensitivity

Violence is often election-related:

- Pre-election periods highest risk
- Post-election acceptance critical
- Election worker protection priority
- Certification process protection
