# Political Violence: Problems

## Inadequate Legal Framework

### Problem Statement

The legal framework for addressing domestic terrorism is weaker than for international terrorism, limiting law enforcement tools and penalties.

### Evidence

**Statutory Gaps**:

| Feature | International Terrorism | Domestic Terrorism |
|---------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Material support laws | Extensive (18 USC 2339A/B) | Limited |
| Designated organizations | Yes (FTO list) | No domestic list |
| Enhanced penalties | Yes | Limited |
| Surveillance tools | FISA and others | More limited |

**Consequences**:

- Domestic terrorists charged with other crimes (weapons, assault)
- No "domestic terrorism" charge in most cases
- Lower penalties may result
- Statistics harder to track

### Root Causes

- First Amendment concerns about domestic designation
- Civil liberties concerns
- Political disagreement on threats
- Historical focus on international terrorism post-9/11

### Impacts

- Perception of unequal treatment
- Inadequate deterrence
- Prosecution challenges
- Resource allocation disparities

## Resource Disparities

### Problem Statement

Resources for countering domestic terrorism remain inadequate compared to the threat and compared to international terrorism resources.

### Evidence

**Budget Allocation**:

| Agency | Domestic vs. International Focus |
|--------|--------------------------------|
| FBI | ~20% domestic terrorism focus (increased from ~10%) |
| DHS | Growing but limited |
| Intelligence community | Primarily international |

**Personnel**:

- Fewer agents assigned to domestic terrorism
- Joint Terrorism Task Forces historically international-focused
- State/local limited resources

**Intelligence Gaps**:

- Less human intelligence on domestic groups
- First Amendment limits on surveillance
- Open source intelligence challenges
- Social media monitoring limitations

### Root Causes

- Post-9/11 international focus
- Civil liberties constraints
- Political resistance to domestic focus
- Budget limitations

### Impacts

- Threats missed or detected late
- Insufficient prevention capacity
- Prosecution delays
- State/local burden

## Political Polarization Around Violence

### Problem Statement

Political polarization prevents unified response to political violence, with each side minimizing violence from their own supporters while highlighting opponents' violence.

### Evidence

**Asymmetric Condemnation**:

| Incident | Republican Response | Democratic Response |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| January 6 | Mixed, some minimization | Universal condemnation |
| Summer 2020 protests | Universal condemnation | Mixed responses |
| Specific attacks | Depends on perpetrator | Depends on perpetrator |

**Survey Data**:

- Partisan differences in what constitutes political violence
- Different threat perceptions
- Selective concern based on source
- Violence justification varies by perceived target

### Root Causes

- Tribal partisan identity
- Media ecosystem differences
- Elite cue-taking
- Rationalization of in-group
- Demonization of out-group

### Impacts

- Inconsistent enforcement perception
- Political cover for extremists
- Failed bipartisan response
- Continued radicalization

## Rhetoric and Incitement

### Problem Statement

Political rhetoric increasingly employs violent imagery and dehumanizing language, creating conditions for violence while staying within First Amendment protections.

### Evidence

**Examples of Concerning Rhetoric**:

- References to political opponents as "enemies"
- Violent imagery and metaphors
- Dehumanizing language
- Calls for "fighting" (ambiguously)
- Delegitimizing election outcomes

**Research Findings**:

- Correlation between rhetoric and hate crimes
- Violent rhetoric predicts violence
- Dehumanization enables violence
- Elite cues shape supporter behavior

### Root Causes

- Competitive pressure for attention
- Media incentives
- Lack of accountability
- Base activation strategies
- Normalization over time

### Impacts

- Elevated threat environment
- Individual radicalization
- Permission structure for violence
- Difficult to prosecute (First Amendment)

## Online Radicalization

### Problem Statement

The internet and social media enable rapid radicalization, extremist recruitment, and operational planning with limited accountability.

### Evidence

**Platform Role**:

| Platform Type | Issue |
|---------------|-------|
| Major social media | Algorithmic amplification, slow moderation |
| Alternative platforms | Less moderation, extremist havens |
| Encrypted messaging | Operational planning hidden |
| Forums/imageboards | Radicalization, manifestos |

**Radicalization Pathways**:

- Algorithm-driven content progression
- Echo chambers
- Peer reinforcement
- Accelerationist content
- Operational planning

**Case Studies**:

- Many attackers radicalized online
- Manifestos posted before attacks
- Coordination on various platforms
- Cross-border connections

### Root Causes

- Section 230 protections
- Platform business models (engagement)
- Encryption challenges
- Global jurisdiction issues
- First Amendment constraints

### Impacts

- Rapid radicalization possible
- Harder to detect threats
- Recruitment at scale
- Planning enabled

## Gun Accessibility

### Problem Statement

Easy access to firearms provides domestic terrorists and political violence perpetrators with lethal means, and political barriers prevent addressing this connection.

### Evidence

**Domestic Terrorism and Firearms**:

- Most deadly attacks use firearms
- Semi-automatic rifles particularly lethal
- Easy legal acquisition in most cases
- Background check gaps

**Examples**:

| Attack | Weapon | Legal Acquisition |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| El Paso | AR-15 style | Yes |
| Pittsburgh | AR-15 style + handguns | Yes |
| Buffalo | AR-15 style | Yes |
| Many others | Various | Usually yes |

### Root Causes

- Second Amendment interpretation
- Political opposition to gun regulation
- NRA and gun lobby influence
- Cultural factors
- Existing large gun stock

### Impacts

- Higher lethality attacks
- Lower barrier to mass violence
- Difficult prevention
- Higher death tolls

## Protection Gaps

### Problem Statement

Many public officials lack adequate security protection, creating vulnerability to attacks and deterring public service.

### Evidence

**Protection Gaps**:

| Official Type | Protection Level |
|---------------|-----------------|
| President, VP | Extensive (Secret Service) |
| Congress leadership | Significant (Capitol Police) |
| Rank-and-file Congress | Limited to Capitol grounds |
| Federal judges | USMS if specific threat |
| State officials | Varies significantly |
| Local officials | Minimal |
| Election workers | Minimal |

**Consequences**:

- Officials attacked at homes, events
- Family members targeted
- Deterrent effect on service
- Resignations due to threats

### Root Causes

- Cost of comprehensive protection
- Number of officials
- Federalism (state/local responsibility)
- Rapid threat escalation

### Impacts

- Attacks on unprotected officials
- Deterred public service
- Democratic participation chilled
- Unequal protection

## Prevention Gaps

### Problem Statement

Prevention and intervention programs are underdeveloped and underfunded, with limited capacity to identify and divert at-risk individuals.

### Evidence

**Program Limitations**:

| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| Federal prevention programs | Limited, fragmented |
| State programs | Few states have robust programs |
| Local programs | Inconsistent |
| Off-ramp/exit programs | Underfunded |
| Threat assessment capacity | Varies |

**Comparison with Other Issues**:

- Gang intervention: More developed
- Drug prevention: More resources
- Suicide prevention: More research
- CVE programs: Controversial, limited

### Root Causes

- Civil liberties concerns
- Political controversy
- Funding limitations
- Limited research base
- Community resistance

### Impacts

- Prevention opportunities missed
- Focus on post-attack response
- Individual radicalization continues
- No systematic intervention

## Intelligence Sharing Failures

### Problem Statement

Information sharing between federal, state, and local agencies remains inadequate, leading to missed warning signs.

### Evidence

**Gap Examples**:

- Pre-January 6 intelligence not shared/acted upon
- Local threats unknown to federal agencies
- Social media threats not tracked systematically
- State-federal coordination gaps

**Structural Issues**:

- Multiple databases, limited integration
- Classification barriers
- Need-to-know culture
- Technology limitations
- Privacy concerns

### Root Causes

- Post-9/11 improvements incomplete for domestic threats
- Different legal frameworks
- Agency cultures
- Resource constraints
- Privacy/civil liberties balance

### Impacts

- Warning signs missed
- Duplicated efforts
- Delayed responses
- Coordination failures

## Prosecution Challenges

### Problem Statement

Prosecuting political violence cases faces challenges including proving motive, First Amendment issues, and jury selection in polarized environment.

### Evidence

**Legal Challenges**:

| Challenge | Issue |
|-----------|-------|
| Proving political motivation | Not required for underlying crimes |
| First Amendment | Distinguishing speech from true threats |
| Jury selection | Partisan attitudes |
| Conspiracy charges | Proving agreement |
| Statute of limitations | Some threats |

**Recent Cases**:

- January 6 prosecutions: Largest in DOJ history
- Seditious conspiracy: Rarely charged
- Domestic terrorism label: Applied inconsistently
- Acquittals: Some cases

### Root Causes

- Legal framework gaps
- Constitutional protections
- Political sensitivity
- Resource demands

### Impacts
