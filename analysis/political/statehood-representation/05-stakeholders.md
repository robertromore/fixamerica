### Small States

Current small states benefit from:

- Disproportionate Senate power
- Electoral College advantages
- Would lose relative power with new states or larger House

| State | Population | Senators per Million |
|-------|------------|---------------------|
| Wyoming | 580,000 | 3.4 |
| Vermont | 645,000 | 3.1 |
| California | 39M | 0.05 |

### Incumbent Members of Congress

Benefits from current system:

- Larger House districts reduce competition
- Frozen House size limits new members
- No new Senate competition
- Familiar power arrangements

### Economic Interests

**Territorial Tax Benefits**:

- Pharmaceutical companies in Puerto Rico
- Various businesses using territorial tax structures
- Would face changes under statehood

## Opposition

### Congressional Opposition

**Republican Conference**:

- Nearly unanimous opposition to DC statehood
- Mixed on Puerto Rico
- Frames opposition as constitutional, not partisan

**Key Arguments Used**:

- Constitutional questions

### Conservative Organizations

- Minority position but significant
- Includes Puerto Rican Independence Party

**Commonwealth Supporters**:

- Popular Democratic Party historically
- Declining support in recent votes

## Government Actors

### Congress

**Role**: Ultimate authority over statehood and representation

**House**:

- Has passed DC statehood twice (2020, 2021)
- Simple majority required
- Democratic support near-unanimous

**Senate**:

- Has not held vote on DC statehood
- Filibuster currently blocks
- 50 votes (with VP) could pass with filibuster reform

### Executive Branch

**President**:

- Can advocate and sign legislation
- Biden supports DC statehood
- Limited direct authority

**DOJ**:

- Provides legal opinions
- Has analyzed constitutional questions

### Courts

**Role**: Would adjudicate constitutional challenges

**Key Precedents**:

- *Insular Cases*: Territories have different status
- *Adams v. Clinton*: DC lacks constitutional right to representation
- Future cases would test statehood provisions

### Territorial Governments

**DC Government**:

- Mayor actively advocates for statehood
- Council passed statehood constitution (2016)
- Limited influence on Congress

**Puerto Rico Government**:

- Governor position depends on party
- Legislature has authorized referenda
- Fiscal control board complicates

## Key Power Dynamics

### Congressional Control

Congress has near-absolute power:

- Can admit states by simple majority
- Can expand House by simple majority
- Cannot change Senate without unanimous consent

### Filibuster

Currently blocks Senate action:

- 60 votes required for most legislation
- DC statehood has ~50 Democratic votes
- Filibuster reform would change calculus

### Self-Determination

Territorial residents' preferences matter politically but not legally:

- Congress not bound by referendum results
- But legitimacy requires consent
- Multiple referenda create political pressure

### Public Opinion

National opinion increasingly supportive:

- DC statehood: 40-50% support nationally
- Puerto Rico: Majority support status resolution
- But not high-salience issue for most voters
