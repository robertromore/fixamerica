# Statehood and Representation: Roadmap

## Strategic Considerations

### Political Requirements

**DC Statehood**:

- House majority (currently achievable)
- Senate majority (50 + VP, currently achievable with filibuster reform)
- Presidential signature (current support)
- Survive legal challenges

**Puerto Rico**:

- Clear referendum result (achieved 2020)
- Congressional action (requires political will)
- Bipartisan support helpful but not required

**House Expansion**:

- House and Senate majorities
- Presidential signature
- Less politically charged than statehood

### Sequencing

Reforms can be pursued simultaneously but have strategic interactions:

1. **Filibuster reform** enables statehood votes
2. **DC statehood** adds senators, potentially easing future reforms
3. **Puerto Rico statehood** adds more senators/representatives
4. **House expansion** can proceed independently

## Phase 1: Foundation (Year 1)

### Political Preparation

**Coalition Building**:

- Unite DC statehood, Puerto Rico statehood, democracy reform movements
- Build relationships with congressional champions

### Legislative Preparation

**DC Statehood Bill**:

- Refine HR 51 / S. 51 language

### Filibuster Reform Advocacy

Essential prerequisite:
