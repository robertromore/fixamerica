# Statehood and Representation: History

## The Founding Framework

### Constitutional Compromises

The Constitution's treatment of representation reflected several compromises:

**Great Compromise (1787)**:

- Large states wanted population-based representation
- Small states wanted equal state representation
- Solution: Bicameral legislature with different principles

**Three-Fifths Compromise**:

- Enslaved people counted as 3/5 for apportionment
- Gave slave states additional representation
- Abolished by 14th Amendment

**Federal District**:

- Article I, Section 8: Congress has exclusive jurisdiction over seat of government
- Designed to prevent any state from hosting and influencing federal government
- Maximum size: 10 miles square

### Original Apportionment

- Constitution required at least 30,000 people per representative
- First Congress: 65 representatives for ~4 million people
- Intended to grow with population

## Washington, D.C. History

## House Apportionment History

### Growth Era (1789-1910)

| Year | House Size | Population per Representative |
|------|------------|------------------------------|
| 1789 | 65 | ~60,000 |
| 1800 | 106 | ~53,000 |
| 1850 | 234 | ~98,000 |
| 1900 | 391 | ~194,000 |
| 1910 | 435 | ~211,000 |

### The Freeze

**1920 Census Crisis**:

- Population shifted from rural to urban, South to North
- Congress failed to pass reapportionment act
- First time since 1790 without reapportionment

**Apportionment Act of 1929**:

- Permanent size of 435 (except temporary additions for Alaska, Hawaii)
- Automatic reapportionment by census
- Removed requirement for equal-population districts
- Size has been frozen for nearly a century

### Why 435?

- No mathematical or constitutional basis
- Simply the size in 1910
- Concerns about chamber size, efficiency
- Later justified by office space, parking

## Senate History

### Original Design

- Framers intended Senate as states' chamber
- State legislatures chose senators
- Insulated from popular pressure
- Unlimited debate tradition

### 17th Amendment (1913)

- Direct election of senators
- Response to corruption in state legislatures
- Maintained equal state representation

### Failed Reform Efforts

- Occasional proposals to change Senate structure
- Article V: "No state, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate"
- Interpreted as requiring unanimous consent

## Patterns and Themes

### Expansion History

The U.S. admitted 37 states after the original 13:

| Era | States Admitted | Notes |
|-----|-----------------|-------|
| 1791-1820 | 9 states | Original territories |
| 1821-1860 | 15 states | Expansion, slave/free balance |
| 1861-1900 | 11 states | Civil War era, West |
| 1901-1959 | 2 states | Oklahoma, then 48-year gap |
| 1959 | 2 states | Alaska, Hawaii |

### Partisan Calculations

States have often been admitted in pairs to maintain balance:

- Ohio (1803) alone, but early partisan era
- Kansas (free) vs. attempts to admit slave states
- Alaska (Democratic lean) and Hawaii (Republican lean)
- Current dynamics: DC/PR seen as Democratic states

### Civil Rights Connections

DC statehood has always been intertwined with race:

- Majority-Black city since 1960
- Opponents use coded and explicit racial arguments
- Home rule came during civil rights era
- Statehood opposition concentrated in one party
