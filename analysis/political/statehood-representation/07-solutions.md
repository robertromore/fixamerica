# Statehood and Representation: Solutions

## Framework for Reform

Representation reform should:

1. **Ensure equal citizenship** for all Americans
2. **Respect self-determination** for affected populations
3. **Maintain constitutional legitimacy**
4. **Build durable political coalitions**
5. **Address practical implementation challenges**

## DC Statehood

### The Solution

Admit the State of Washington, Douglass Commonwealth as the 51st state.

### Implementation

**Legislative Approach**:

1. **Shrink Federal District**: Reduce to core government area (Capitol, White House, Mall, federal buildings)
2. **Admit State**: Congress passes admission act for remaining residential/commercial areas
3. **Repeal 23rd Amendment**: Remove electoral votes for now-uninhabited district
4. **Transition**: Phased implementation over 2 years

**Constitutional Provisions of New State**:

- Two senators, one representative
- Full voting rights in Congress
- Control over local affairs
- Normal state-federal relationship

### Benefits

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Voting Representation | Two senators, one representative |
| Autonomy | No congressional override of local laws |
| Budget Control | Spend locally-raised revenue freely |
| National Guard | Governor controls local guard |
| Equal Treatment | Same as other states |

### Addressing Concerns

**Federal District**: Would still exist for core government functions (approximately 2 square miles encompassing Capitol, White House, Supreme Court, Mall, and major federal buildings).

**23rd Amendment**: Would need repeal, or could be interpreted as inapplicable when no residents exist. Repeal should be part of package.

**Constitutional Challenge**: Legislation should be carefully drafted to withstand legal challenge. Precedent of Virginia retrocession supports shrinking district.

## Puerto Rico Status Resolution

### The Solution

Congressional action to facilitate Puerto Rico self-determination with clear options and consequences.

### Implementation

**Federal Process**:

1. **Binding Plebiscite**: Congress authorizes referendum with clear options
2. **Defined Options**: Statehood, independence, or free association
3. **Clear Consequences**: Each option's implications specified in advance
4. **Congressional Commitment**: Pledge to act on results
5. **Transition Period**: Multi-year implementation

**Statehood Path**:

- Puerto Rico drafts state constitution
- Congress passes enabling act
- President signs admission
- Phased implementation (taxes, programs, representation)

### Benefits of Statehood

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Voting Representation | Two senators, four-five representatives |
| Federal Programs | Full access to Medicaid, SSI, EITC |
| Presidential Vote | Electoral participation |
| Equal Treatment | Same as other states |

### Addressing Concerns

**Economic Transition**: Phase in tax changes over 10+ years. Address debt separately from status.

**Cultural Preservation**: Hawaii model shows state can maintain distinct culture. No federal language requirement.

**Self-Determination**: Process must clearly reflect Puerto Rican choice. Multiple referenda have shown statehood support.

## Other Territories

### Guam and U.S. Virgin Islands

**Options**:

- Statehood (individually or combined)
- Independence
- Free association
- Enhanced status

**Process**: Similar to Puerto Rico—federally authorized plebiscite with clear options and congressional commitment to act.

### American Samoa

**Citizenship Question**:

- Currently only U.S. nationals, not citizens
- Should be given choice
- Land ownership concerns can be addressed through state constitutional provisions (Hawaii model)

### Northern Mariana Islands

Already a commonwealth with delegate. Could pursue:

- Enhanced commonwealth
- Statehood (possibly combined with Guam)
- Status quo

## House Expansion

### The Solution

Expand the House of Representatives to improve representation.

### Options

| Approach | Size | Ratio |
|----------|------|-------|
| Cube Root Rule | ~550-600 | ~550,000 per member |
| Wyoming Rule | ~550 | Smallest state sets ratio |
| Double Current | 870 | ~380,000 per member |
| Constitutional Maximum | 10,000+ | 30,000 per member |

### Recommended: Wyoming Rule

Smallest state population becomes standard for one representative. Currently would yield approximately 550 members.

**Benefits**:

- Mathematically principled
- Reduces representation inequality
- Modest increase
- Automatically adjusts with census

### Implementation

**Legislative**: Simple statute amending 2 U.S.C. § 2a

**Practical Considerations**:

- Chamber modification or new facilities
- Committee structure adjustments
- Staff and office space
- Phased implementation over two congresses

### Effects

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Better Representation | Fewer constituents per member |
| Reduced Inequality | Population differences minimized |
| Electoral College | Slightly reduces small-state advantage |
| Accessibility | Representatives closer to constituents |

## Senate Reform

### The Challenge

Article V appears to require unanimous consent to change equal suffrage: "no state, without its consent, shall be deprived of its equal suffrage in the Senate."

### Possible Approaches

**Constitutional Amendment**:

- Would require 3/4 of states
- Small states would block
- Theoretically possible with overwhelming support

**Workarounds (Controversial)**:

- Some scholars argue Article V protection could be amended
- Two-step process: First amend Article V, then amend Senate
- Legally uncertain, politically difficult

**Indirect Reforms**:

- Admit new states (changes composition)
- Expand House (reduces Senate's Electoral College weight)
- Filibuster reform (reduces Senate obstruction)

### Recommended: Focus on Achievable Reforms

Given constitutional constraints, prioritize:

1. DC and Puerto Rico statehood (adds senators)
2. House expansion (dilutes Senate's electoral weight)
3. Filibuster reform (reduces minority obstruction)

## Complementary Reforms

### Electoral College Reform

Statehood and House expansion affect Electoral College:

- DC statehood: 3 electoral votes (already has via 23rd Amendment, would shift to state basis)
- Puerto Rico statehood: Approximately 6 electoral votes
- House expansion: Reduces weight of Senate component

See [Electoral College](../electoral-college/01-overview.md) for comprehensive Electoral College reform.

### Filibuster Reform

Essential for passing statehood:

- Current 60-vote threshold blocks DC statehood
- Filibuster reform would enable majority passage
- Various approaches (carve-out, reform, abolition)

See [Congressional Reform](../congressional-reform/01-overview.md) for filibuster reform details.

## Implementation Priority

| Reform | Impact | Feasibility | Priority |
|--------|--------|-------------|----------|
| DC Statehood | High | Moderate (requires 50 + VP) | 1 |
| Puerto Rico Resolution | High | Moderate | 2 |
| House Expansion | Moderate | High | 3 |
| Territory Resolution | Moderate | Moderate | 4 |
| Senate Reform | High | Very Low | Long-term |
