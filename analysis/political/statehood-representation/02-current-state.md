| Budget Autonomy | DC cannot spend its own locally-raised funds without congressional approval |
| National Guard | President, not mayor, controls DC National Guard |
| Judicial | Federal courts handle local felonies |

## House of Representatives

### The 435 Cap

- **Origin**: Apportionment Act of 1929 froze House at 435 members
- **Original Ratio**: Constitution suggested 30,000 per representative
- **Current Ratio**: Average 760,000 per representative
- **Variation**: Ranges from 580,000 (Montana) to 990,000 (Delaware)

### Consequences of Frozen Size

| Effect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Reduced Representation | Each representative serves more constituents |
| Increased Inequality | Population differences among districts grow |
| Electoral College | Smaller states gain relative Electoral College weight |
| Accessibility | Representatives less accessible to constituents |

### Comparative Perspective

| Country | Lower House Size | Population per Member |
|---------|------------------|----------------------|
| United Kingdom | 650 | 102,000 |
| Germany | 736 | 113,000 |
| France | 577 | 117,000 |
| United States | 435 | 760,000 |

## Senate Representation

### Structural Reality

- Each state has exactly two senators regardless of population
- Wyoming (580,000): 2 senators = 290,000 per senator
- California (39 million): 2 senators = 19.5 million per senator
- Ratio: 67:1 population disparity with equal representation

### Political Implications

- 18% of population can elect Senate majority
- Rural, less diverse states overrepresented
- Affects judicial confirmations, treaties, legislation
- Insulated from change (Article V protects equal suffrage)

### Historical Context

- Great Compromise of 1787
- Originally state legislatures chose senators
- 17th Amendment (1913): Direct election
- No amendment has changed equal state representation

## Legal Framework

### Statehood Process

The Constitution (Article IV, Section 3) gives Congress power to admit new states:

1. Territory organizes and requests statehood
2. Congress passes enabling act
3. Territory drafts constitution
4. Congress approves admission
5. President signs

Simple majority required—no supermajority, no state ratification.

### Constitutional Questions

| Question | Current Understanding |
|----------|----------------------|
| Can DC become a state? | Likely requires reducing federal district to core |
| Can Puerto Rico become a state? | Yes, with congressional action |
| Can House size change? | Yes, by simple statute |
| Can Senate structure change? | Article V appears to prohibit without unanimous consent |
