# Statehood and Representation: Legislation

## Overview

This document provides model legislation for statehood and representation reform, including federal admission acts, constitutional amendments, and supporting legislation. Because statehood requires congressional action, most provisions are federal legislation.

## Constitutional Amendments

### 23rd Amendment Repeal

**Purpose**: Remove electoral votes from the federal district after DC statehood.

**Draft Text**:

```text
ARTICLE —

Section 1. The twenty-third article of amendment to the
Constitution of the United States is hereby repealed.

Section 2. This article shall take effect upon the admission
of the State of Washington, Douglass Commonwealth, or upon
ratification, whichever is later.
```

**Explanation**: The 23rd Amendment grants DC three electoral votes. After statehood, the federal district would have few or no residents, but would still have electoral votes unless repealed. This amendment should be proposed alongside statehood legislation.

### House Expansion Amendment (Optional)

**Purpose**: Establish principle of proportional representation in House.

**Draft Text**:

```text
ARTICLE —

Section 1. The House of Representatives shall be apportioned
among the several States according to their respective
numbers, with no fewer than one Representative for every
five hundred thousand persons.

Section 2. The Congress shall reapportion the House following
each decennial census in accordance with this article.

Section 3. This article shall take effect upon the
reapportionment following its ratification.
```

**Note**: House expansion can be achieved by statute; amendment provides permanence but is harder to pass.

### House of Representatives Expansion Act

**Purpose**: Expand the House using the Wyoming Rule.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "House of Representatives
Expansion Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that—
(1) the House of Representatives has been fixed at 435
    members since 1929;
(2) the average Congressional district now contains over
    760,000 persons;
(3) significant disparities exist in representation among
    States;
(4) a larger House would provide more equal and
    accessible representation.

SEC. 3. APPORTIONMENT.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 22 of the Act of June 18, 1929
    (2 U.S.C. 2a) is amended—
    (1) in striking "four hundred and thirty-five
        Representatives" and inserting "a number of
        Representatives determined under subsection (c)";
    (2) by adding at the end the following:

"(c) NUMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES.—
    (1) The number of Representatives shall be determined
        by dividing the population of the United States by
        the population of the least populous State entitled
        to one Representative, and rounding to the nearest
        whole number.
    (2) This calculation shall be made following each
        decennial census.".

(b) EFFECTIVE DATE.—The amendments made by this section
    shall apply beginning with the reapportionment
    following the 2030 decennial census.

SEC. 4. TRANSITION.

(a) FACILITIES.—The Architect of the Capitol shall, in
    consultation with the House of Representatives,
    develop plans for any necessary modifications to
    House facilities.

(b) RULES.—The House of Representatives may adopt such
    rules as necessary to accommodate additional Members.
```

**Note**: This legislation uses the Wyoming Rule—the population of the smallest state sets the ratio. Currently would yield approximately 550 members.

## Regulatory Framework

### Federal District Administration

After DC statehood, regulations needed for:

- Federal property management in Capital
- Coordination between State and Federal governments
- Security arrangements
- Federal employee policies

### Transition Implementation

- Timeline and milestones
- Asset and liability allocation
- Employee transitions
- Legal continuity

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Authority

**DC Statehood**:

- Article IV, Section 3: Congress can admit new states
- Article I, Section 8: Federal district language (sets maximum, not minimum)
- Shrinking district approach avoids constitutional problems

**Puerto Rico**:

- Article IV, Section 3: Territorial clause
- Clear congressional authority
- Self-determination principles

**House Expansion**:

- 2 U.S.C. § 2a: Statutory, can be amended
- No constitutional bar to larger House

### Anticipated Legal Challenges

| Challenge | Argument | Response |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| DC statehood unconstitutional | Federal district required | Constitution sets maximum, not minimum |
| 23rd Amendment problem | Gives DC electoral votes | Repeal, or no residents in Capital |
| Puerto Rico status | Various | Clear congressional authority |
| House expansion | Practical objections | Statutory, clearly constitutional |

### Voting Rights Implications

- Statehood would provide full Voting Rights Act protection
- Congressional representation affects all federal legislation
- Equal protection principles support equal representation

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| 23rd Amendment delay | If repeal takes years, creates anomaly | Moderate |
| Federal district manipulation | Future Congress could expand federal district | Moderate |
| Puerto Rico economic transition | Tax transition could disadvantage island | Moderate |
| House expansion delay | Implementation pushed to future census | Low |
| Status reversal | Future Congress could reverse decisions | Low |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Senate malapportionment | Cannot be addressed legislatively | Constitutional structure |
| Other territories | Still unresolved | Separate processes needed |
| Political opposition | Blocks passage | Partisan calculation |
| Transition complexity | Implementation challenges | Institutional change |
| Public awareness | Limited national attention | Issue salience |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **23rd Amendment Coordination**
    - Propose repeal simultaneously with statehood
    - Include transition provisions in statehood act
    - Provide for contingencies if repeal delayed

2. **Federal District Protection**
    - Define boundaries precisely in statute
    - Require congressional action to modify
    - State constitution provisions

3. **Economic Transition**
    - Phase in tax changes over 10+ years
    - Transition assistance funding
    - Economic development support

4. **Implementation Monitoring**
    - Oversight mechanisms
    - Regular reporting requirements
    - Adjustment authority

### General Implementation Concerns

1. **Political Sustainability**
    - Build bipartisan support where possible
    - Public education campaigns
    - Lock in through constitution/statute

2. **Legal Defense**
    - Prepare for litigation
    - Build strong congressional record
    - Coordinate defense strategy

3. **Institutional Capacity**
    - Adequate transition planning
    - Funding appropriations
    - Technical assistance

4. **Territorial Resolution**
    - Apply similar processes to other territories
    - Respect self-determination
    - Consistent principles
