# Statehood and Representation: Overview

The United States maintains a two-tiered system of citizenship in which millions of Americans lack full representation in their national government. Residents of Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, and other U.S. territories pay federal taxes, serve in the military, and are subject to federal laws, yet have no voting representation in Congress. Meanwhile, the structure of the Senate and the frozen size of the House create significant disparities in representation among existing states, raising fundamental questions about democratic equality.
