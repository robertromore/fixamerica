# Democratic Innovation: Stakeholders

## Who Benefits from the Status Quo

### Elected Officials

**Who They Are**

- Federal, state, and local elected officials
- Party leadership
- Political appointees

**What They Gain**

| Benefit | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Agenda control | They decide what issues to address |
| Decision authority | Final say on policy |
| Information advantage | Better access to expertise |
| Accountability framing | Evaluated only on elections |

**Level of Opposition to Reform**: **High**

- Citizen participation threatens their autonomy
- Deliberative outcomes might differ from their preferences
- "You're not elected" argument against citizen bodies
- But some officials genuinely want citizen input

### Political Parties

**Why They Benefit**

| Advantage | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| Mobilization monopoly | Parties control how citizens engage |
| Issue framing | Parties define the political debate |
| Candidate selection | Nominations are party-controlled |
| Campaign infrastructure | Parties are the vehicle for participation |

**Level of Opposition to Reform**: **Medium-High**

- Cross-partisan deliberation threatens party identity
- Sortition bypasses party gatekeeping
- But some party reformers exist (especially after losses)

### Organized Interests and Lobbyists

**Who They Are**

- Industry groups and trade associations
- Labor unions
- Single-issue advocacy organizations
- Think tanks aligned with specific interests

**What They Gain**

| Benefit | Mechanism |
|---------|-----------|
| Professional access | Know how to work the system |
| Resource advantage | Can fund campaigns, lobbying |
| Expertise advantage | Technical knowledge gives influence |
| Repeat player status | Long-term relationships with officials |

**Level of Opposition to Reform**: **High**

- Random citizens not amenable to same influence
- Deliberation might produce different outcomes
- Current system rewards their investment

### Political Consultants and Polling Industry

**What They Gain**

- Election-focused participation keeps them in business
- Deliberative processes less lucrative
- Opinion polling differs from deliberative polling

**Level of Opposition to Reform**: **Medium**

- Could adapt to new models
- Some firms specialize in citizen engagement
- Threat mainly to campaign-focused consultants

## Who Is Harmed

### Average Citizens

**What They Lose**

| Loss | Impact |
|------|--------|
| Voice between elections | No meaningful participation opportunities |
| Policy influence | Preferences ignored in favor of elite preferences |
| Trust | Can't see government responding to people like them |
| Civic development | No practice in deliberation and governance |

**The Numbers**

| Metric | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Policy influence (average citizen) | Statistically near zero |
| Feel "government cares what I think" | 29% |
| Contacted by government for input | <5% |
| Feel democracy is "working well" | 38% |

### Marginalized Communities

**Why They're Most Harmed**

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Lower voting rates | Less represented through elections |
| Less organized | Fewer advocacy organizations |
| Less access | Harder to participate in hearings, meetings |
| Historical exclusion | Deliberative traditions built without them |

**How Innovation Could Help**

- Random selection ensures demographic representation
- Paid participation enables working-class involvement
- Deliberation gives voice to unheard perspectives
- Local participatory budgeting has engaged marginalized groups

### Young People

**Why They're Harmed**

- Lower turnout means less electoral representation
- Policies favor older, voting populations
- Climate, debt affect them most; least input
- Democratic habits not developed

### Future Generations

**The Ultimate Disenfranchised**

- Cannot vote or participate
- Bear consequences of current decisions (climate, debt, infrastructure)
- No mechanism for representing their interests
- Deliberation might better consider long-term
