# Democratic Innovation: Solutions

## Overview

Democratic innovation requires building new institutions and practices at every level of government. This section outlines specific mechanisms, design principles, and implementation strategies.

## Citizens' Assemblies

### What They Are

A citizens' assembly is a body of randomly selected citizens convened to deliberate on a specific issue and produce recommendations.

**Core Elements**:

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Random selection (sortition) | Ensures demographic representativeness |
| Learning phase | Participants receive balanced expert information |
| Facilitated deliberation | Structured discussion enables productive dialogue |
| Recommendation phase | Group develops proposals through consensus-building |
| Public reporting | Recommendations made public with rationale |

### Design Principles

**Size**: 50-200 participants (larger for more complex issues)

**Selection Process**:

1. Random sample from entire population (not volunteers)
2. Stratified sampling for demographic representation
3. Oversampling underrepresented groups
4. Compensation to enable participation
5. Support services (childcare, accessibility)

**Duration**: Multiple sessions over weeks or months (not single day)

**Information**:

1. Balanced briefing materials
2. Expert presentations from multiple perspectives
3. Stakeholder testimony
4. Site visits if relevant
5. Participant questions drive information requests

**Facilitation**:

1. Professional, neutral facilitators
2. Small group discussions (8-12 people)
3. Plenary sessions for synthesis
4. Structured methods (dot voting, ranking, etc.)
5. Documentation of minority views

### The Irish Model

**What Made It Work**:

| Feature | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Political commitment | Government promised to hold referenda |
| Mixed membership (initially) | Politicians and citizens built trust |
| Multi-session format | Time for learning and deliberation |
| Balanced information | Advocates from all sides presented |
| Clear mandate | Specific constitutional questions |
| Public attention | Media coverage created legitimacy |

**Outcomes**: Marriage equality, abortion access, blasphemy law repeal

### Recommended Scope for U.S.

**Start With**:

- State-level constitutional issues
- Major policy questions (health, education, climate)
- Contentious issues where legislators are stuck

**Expand To**:

- Federal advisory assemblies
- Permanent or recurring assemblies
- Agenda-setting bodies

## Deliberative Polling

### What It Is

A deliberative poll combines scientific random sampling with facilitated deliberation to measure what the public would think if informed.

**Process**:

1. **Baseline survey**: Random sample surveyed on issue
2. **Recruitment**: Subset invited to deliberate (in-person or online)
3. **Briefing materials**: Balanced information provided
4. **Small group discussion**: Facilitated deliberation
5. **Expert Q&A**: Plenary sessions with experts
6. **Final survey**: Same questions as baseline
7. **Analysis**: Compare pre- and post-deliberation views

### Key Findings

**Opinion Change**: Views often shift significantly after deliberation

| Topic | Shift |
|-------|-------|
| Immigration policy | More nuanced views |
| Energy policy | More support for conservation |
| Criminal justice | Less punitive preferences |
| Healthcare | More support for universal coverage |

**Knowledge Gain**: Information levels increase substantially

**Civility**: Partisan hostility decreases

### Applications

**Advisory**:

- Inform legislators about informed public opinion
- Guide ballot measure campaigns
- Shape media coverage of issues

**Decision-Making**:

- Texas utilities used for energy planning
- EU used for treaty discussions
- Could inform major federal decisions

### America in One Room

**2019 Experiment**:

- 500+ randomly selected Americans
- Multi-day deliberation on immigration, healthcare, environment, economy, foreign policy
- Dramatic opinion shifts on many issues
- Partisan polarization reduced
- Model for national-scale deliberation

## Sortition Bodies

### Beyond Advisory Roles

**Current**: Citizens' assemblies are advisory; elected bodies decide

**Proposal**: Give sortition bodies real decision-making authority

**Options**:

| Model | Authority Level |
|-------|-----------------|
| Advisory assembly | Recommendations only |
| Agenda-setting body | Sets legislative priorities |
| Initiative review | Evaluates ballot measures (Oregon) |
| Legislative chamber | One house selected by lot |
| Policy jury | Binding decisions on specific issues |

### The Sortition Legislature Proposal

**Vision**: Replace or supplement elected legislature with sorted chamber

**Design**:

| Element | Specification |
|---------|---------------|
| Size | 300-500 members |
| Term | 2-3 years, staggered |
| Selection | Random from citizen pool |
| Compensation | Full salary + benefits |
| Support | Staff, research resources |
| Jurisdiction | All legislation, or specific domains |

**Arguments For**:

- Truly representative of population
- No campaign fundraising required
- No re-election pressure
- Deliberative rather than partisan

**Arguments Against**:

- No electoral accountability
- Constitutional barriers (Article I)
- Lack of expertise
- Radical change from current system

**Realistic Path**:

1. Start with advisory bodies
2. Build evidence of competence
3. Expand authority gradually
4. Constitutional amendment long-term (if ever)

## Participatory Budgeting

### How It Works

Citizens directly decide how to allocate a portion of public funds.

**Standard Process**:

1. **Idea collection**: Citizens propose projects
2. **Proposal development**: Volunteers develop feasible proposals
3. **Community voting**: All residents vote on projects
4. **Implementation**: Government implements winning projects
5. **Monitoring**: Citizens track implementation

### Beyond Local Capital Projects

**Current Limitation**: Most PB is local, small-scale, capital-only

**Expansion Opportunities**:

| Level | Potential |
|-------|-----------|
| State | State budget allocation (1-5%) |
| Federal | Agency budget input |
| Operating budgets | Services, not just capital |
| Larger percentages | 5-10% of budget, not 1% |

### Scaling Up

**New York City Model**:

- $40M+ annually
- 100,000+ participants
- Expanded to schools, housing authorities
- Model for larger cities

**State-Level PB**:

- Portugal: National-level PB since 2017
- Could be adapted for U.S. states
- Requires legislative authorization

### Design for Inclusion

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Lower-income participation | Bring voting to where people are; mobile voting |
| Language barriers | Multi-language materials and support |
| Youth engagement | Include young people (sometimes under 18) |
| Geographic equity | District-based allocation |
| Disability access | Accessible formats and venues |

## Liquid Democracy

### What It Is

A hybrid system allowing citizens to either vote directly on issues or delegate their vote to trusted representatives.

**Key Features**:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Direct voting | Citizens can vote on any issue |
| Delegable votes | Can delegate to representative on specific topics |
| Revocable delegation | Can withdraw delegation at any time |
| Transitive delegation | Delegates can re-delegate (with limits) |
| Issue-specific | Different delegates for different topics |

### How It Would Work

**Example**:

- Maria is expert on education; delegates healthcare to her doctor friend
- Her doctor friend is busy; delegates to an advocacy organization he trusts
- On education, Maria votes directly
- On healthcare, her vote flows through her delegate chain
- If she disagrees with a vote, she revokes delegation and votes directly

### Current Experiments

| Context | Status |
|---------|--------|
| Pirate Party (Germany) | Internal governance |
| Demoex (Sweden) | Local party used liquid democracy |
| Democracy Earth | Platform for liquid democracy |
| Various organizations | Internal decision-making |

### Implementation Challenges

| Challenge | Potential Solution |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Complexity | Good user interface design |
| Vote buying | Prohibit paid delegation |
| Power concentration | Limit total delegated votes |
| Verification | Secure voting systems |
| Engagement | Education and outreach |

### Realistic Path

**Short-term**: Use for organizational governance, party internal decisions

**Medium-term**: Pilot for local government advisory processes

**Long-term**: Consider for formal governmental use

## Digital Democracy Tools

### vTaiwan Model

**What It Is**: Online platform for consensus-building on policy issues

**How It Works**:

1. **Issue identified**: Government or citizens propose topic
2. **Pol.is consultation**: Citizens submit statements; vote agree/disagree
3. **Consensus mapping**: Algorithm identifies areas of agreement
4. **Deliberation**: In-person or online discussion of contentious points
5. **Policy development**: Government drafts policy based on consensus
6. **Final comment**: Public review before implementation

**Success Stories**:

- Uber regulation in Taiwan
- E-commerce rules
- Crowdsourced solutions to complex issues

### Platform Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Accessibility | Mobile-friendly; multiple languages |
| Inclusivity | Outreach to underrepresented |
| Deliberation focus | Not just voting; discussion |
| Transparency | Open data; public process |
| Government responsiveness | Commitment to consider input |
| Privacy protection | Secure; option for anonymity |

### Promising Platforms

| Platform | Features |
|----------|----------|
| Decidim | Open-source; comprehensive civic engagement |
| Pol.is | Consensus-finding algorithm |
| Consul | Budget participation; proposals |
| CitizenLab | Modular platform for various uses |
| Consider.it | Pro/con analysis of proposals |

### Implementation

**Municipal Level**:

- Train staff on platform management
- Build public awareness
- Commit to responsiveness

**State/Federal**:

- E-rulemaking improvements
- Issue consultations
- Budget input
- Legislative feedback

## Consensus Conferences and Planning Cells

### Consensus Conferences

**Origins**: Denmark (1980s)

**Process**:

1. **Panel selection**: 10-25 randomly selected citizens
2. **Preparatory weekends**: Background reading and initial discussion
3. **Conference**: 4-day event with expert hearings
4. **Report writing**: Panel produces report with recommendations
5. **Publication**: Report released to public and policymakers

**Best For**:

- Scientific/technical controversies
- Emerging technologies (AI, genetic engineering)
- Complex policy questions

### Planning Cells (Planungszellen)

**Origins**: Germany (1970s)

**Process**:

1. **Multiple cells**: 25-person groups run simultaneously
2. **Duration**: 4-5 days of intensive work
3. **Expert input**: Presentations and Q&A
4. **Output**: Citizen report (Bürgergutachten)
5. **Independence**: Run by university or independent organization

**Applications**:

- Urban planning
- Environmental decisions
- Infrastructure projects
- Local policy questions

### Citizen Juries

**Similar to planning cells but**:

- Often smaller (12-24 people, like trial juries)
- Shorter duration (4-5 days typically)
- Single location, not multiple parallel cells
- American adaptation of German model

## Crowdsourced Legislation

### What It Is

Using online platforms to enable citizens to contribute to drafting laws.

**Examples**:

| Project | Country | Outcome |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Constitution drafting | Iceland | Crowdsourced constitution (not adopted) |
| Better Reykjavik | Iceland | Citizen proposals implemented |
| Finnish initiative | Finland | Citizens can propose laws |
| Senado do Futuro | Brazil | Senate uses public input |

### Process Design

**Stages**:

1. **Problem identification**: Citizens flag issues
2. **Proposal drafting**: Citizens submit draft language
3. **Collaborative editing**: Wiki-style refinement
4. **Expert review**: Legal and policy experts assess
5. **Voting/prioritization**: Public input on priorities
6. **Legislative consideration**: Formal body considers proposals

### U.S. Applications

**Current**:

- Some states allow citizen initiatives (but not collaborative drafting)
- Congress.gov allows viewing bills (but not contributing)
- Some agencies accept public comment (but limited integration)

**Potential**:

- Citizen initiative drafting platforms
- Legislative crowdsourcing experiments
- Agency rulemaking enhancement

## Democratic Experimentation
