# Democratic Innovation: History

## Origins

### Ancient Athens: The Original Democracy

The first democracy was far more participatory than modern representative systems:

**Athenian Institutions (5th-4th century BCE)**:

| Institution | Function | Selection Method |
|-------------|----------|------------------|
| Ekklesia (Assembly) | All major decisions | All citizens could attend |
| Boule (Council of 500) | Set agenda, draft proposals | Random selection (sortition) |
| Dikasteria (Courts) | Judicial decisions | Random selection |
| Magistrates | Administrative roles | Most by random selection |

**Key Features**:

- **Sortition**: Most offices filled by lottery, not election
- **Rotation**: Short terms; extensive participation over lifetime
- **Direct participation**: Citizens voted directly on laws
- **Payment**: Compensation enabled non-wealthy participation

**Why Sortition?**

The Athenians believed:

- Elections favor the wealthy and famous
- Random selection is more democratic
- Rotation prevents concentration of power
- Any citizen can serve with proper information

### Medieval and Early Modern Precedents

**Italian City-States**:

- Venice used lottery for Doge selection (complex multi-round system)
- Florence used random selection for councils
- Combined with nomination to prevent manipulation

**Spain**:

- Insaculación (lottery selection) for municipal offices
- Used for centuries in Aragon, Catalonia

**Swiss Cantons**:

- Direct democracy in Landsgemeinde (citizen assemblies)
- Survived to present day in some cantons

### The American Founding

**What the Founders Chose**:

- Representative democracy, not direct democracy
- Election for legislative, executive, judicial branches (federal judges appointed)
- Only the jury system preserved random citizen selection

**Madison's View** (*Federalist No. 10*):

- Direct democracy leads to faction and tyranny of majority
- Representatives "refine and enlarge" public views
- Large republic makes dangerous factions less likely

**What Was Lost**:

- No sortition for legislative bodies
- Minimal direct citizen participation
- Town meetings remained only in New England
- Representative democracy became the American model

## Key Turning Points

### 1970s-1980s: Academic Revival

**James Fishkin and Deliberative Polling**:

- Stanford professor develops deliberative polling (1988)
- Combines random sampling with facilitated deliberation
- First deliberative poll in Britain (1994)
- Provides rigorous evidence for citizen deliberation

**Benjamin Barber and "Strong Democracy"**:

- *Strong Democracy* (1984) critiques "thin" representative democracy
- Calls for more participatory institutions
- Influences academic and practitioner thinking

**German Planning Cells (Planungszellen)**:

- Peter Dienel develops planning cells (1970s)
- Randomly selected citizens deliberate on local issues
- Used in Germany for urban planning
- Demonstrates viability of citizen deliberation

### 1989: Porto Alegre Invents Participatory Budgeting

**The Innovation**:

- Workers' Party takes power in Porto Alegre, Brazil
- Implements participatory budgeting (orçamento participativo)
- Citizens directly allocate portion of municipal budget
- Transforms local governance

**The Process**:

1. Neighborhood assemblies identify priorities
2. Delegates elected to city-wide council
3. Council allocates budget across priorities
4. Citizens monitor implementation

**Results**:

- Water connections: 75% → 98% of households
- Schools: Tripled enrollment
- Roads: 30 km paved annually
- Reduced corruption and clientelism

**Global Spread**:

| Period | Adoption |
|--------|----------|
| 1989-2000 | Brazil (200+ cities) |
| 2000-2010 | Latin America, Europe, Africa |
| 2010-present | 3,000+ cities worldwide |

### 2004: British Columbia Citizens' Assembly

**The Experiment**:

- 160 randomly selected citizens
- Year-long deliberation on electoral reform
- Produced recommendation for single transferable vote (STV)
- Went to referendum (57% yes, but 60% threshold required)

**Significance**:

- First citizens' assembly on electoral reform
- Demonstrated citizens can handle complex issues
- Model for subsequent assemblies worldwide
- Inspired Ontario, Netherlands, Irish assemblies

### 2010: Oregon Citizens' Initiative Review

**The Innovation**:

- Citizen panels evaluate ballot measures
- 20-24 randomly selected citizens per panel
- 5-day deliberation with expert witnesses
- Produce citizen statements for voter guides

**Institutionalization**:

- 2010: Pilot project funded by foundations
- 2011: State legislature authorizes permanent program
- Ongoing: Multiple panels each election cycle
- Nationally: Only permanent U.S. sortition institution

### 2012-2018: Ireland's Constitutional Conventions

**The Process**:

- Constitutional Convention (2012-2014): 100 members (33 politicians + 66 random citizens)
- Citizens' Assembly (2016-2018): 99 randomly selected citizens only

**Major Outcomes**:

| Topic | Assembly Recommendation | Referendum Result |
|-------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Marriage equality | 79% in favor | Passed (62%) |
| Abortion access | 66% in favor | Passed (66%) |
| Blasphemy law | 63% favored repeal | Passed (65%) |

**Significance**:

- Breakthrough on previously intractable issues
- Politicians could defer to citizen process
- High public legitimacy
- International model

### 2019-2020: France's Climate Assembly

**Convention Citoyenne pour le Climat**:

- President Macron convenes assembly in response to Yellow Vest protests
- 150 randomly selected citizens
- Mandate: 40% emissions reduction while ensuring social justice
- 7 sessions over 9 months
- 149 proposals produced

**Government Response**:

- 146 proposals accepted "in principle"
- Climate law enacted incorporating many recommendations
- But president rejected key proposals (speed limit reduction, constitutional amendment)
- Controversy over partial implementation

**Lessons**:

- Citizens can address complex, technical issues
- Government commitment to implementation critical
- Managing expectations important
- Media coverage and public attention achieved

### 2019-Present: Global Proliferation

**Citizens' Assemblies Proliferate**:

| Country | Assembly | Year |
|---------|----------|------|
| UK | Climate Assembly UK | 2020 |
| Germany | Multiple Bürgerräte | 2019-present |
| Scotland | Climate assembly | 2020 |
| Austria | Climate assembly | 2022 |
| Belgium (German-speaking) | Permanent council | 2019 |

**OECD "Deliberative Wave"**:

- 2020 OECD report documents 300+ deliberative processes since 1980s
- Acceleration in recent years
- Growing institutionalization
- Best practices emerging

## Lessons from History

### Sortition Works

**The Evidence**:

- Athenians governed themselves for 200 years using lottery
- Modern citizens' assemblies produce thoughtful recommendations
- Random selection achieves representation that election cannot

**Why It Was Abandoned**:

- Rise of nation-states required professional administration
- Enlightenment emphasis on choosing "the best"
- Elections seen as more legitimate than lottery
- Loss of classical knowledge about Athenian practices

### Innovations Can Spread

**Porto Alegre to the World**:

- One city invented participatory budgeting
- Within 30 years: 3,000+ cities
- Adaptation to different contexts
- World Social Forum spread the idea

**Citizens' Assemblies**:

- British Columbia (2004) inspired Ontario, Ireland, France, Germany
- Each builds on previous experience
- International network of practitioners

### Political Will Matters

**Success Factors**:

- Political champions willing to share power
- Crisis or legitimacy challenge creating opening
- Sustained commitment beyond initial experiment
- Resources for proper implementation

**Failure Factors**:

- Politicians not committed to implementation
- Inadequate funding and time
- Poor process design
- Lack of follow-through

### Innovations Can Be Reversed

**Cautionary Tales**:

- Porto Alegre's participatory budgeting weakened after Workers' Party lost power
- Some U.S. city PB programs defunded
- Political changes can undo institutional innovations
- Sustained advocacy required

## What History Suggests for the Future

### The U.S. Context

**Challenges**:

- No historical tradition of sortition (unlike Europe)
- Strong attachment to election as legitimating mechanism
- Federalism fragments experimentation
- Polarization makes deliberation harder

**Opportunities**:

- Crisis of democratic legitimacy creates openings
- Growing international evidence base
- Local experimentation possible
- Oregon model can expand

### The Path Forward

History suggests:

1. **Start local**: Porto Alegre, Oregon both started small
2. **Build evidence**: Rigorous evaluation builds credibility
3. **Find champions**: Political leadership matters
4. **Institutionalize**: Pilots must become permanent
5. **Defend gains**: Opponents will try to reverse progress
