# Democratic Innovation: Opposition

## Who Opposes Democratic Innovation

### Elected Officials and Party Leaders

**Primary Objection**: Loss of authority and control

**Arguments Made**:

| Argument | Real Concern Behind It |
|----------|----------------------|
| "We're elected; citizens' assemblies aren't" | Threatens representative authority |
| "Citizens lack expertise" | Prefers expert/donor input they can control |
| "Too expensive and slow" | Doesn't want to share power |
| "Could be manipulated" | Fears outcomes they can't control |

**Actions Taken**:

- Block legislation creating citizen bodies
- Underfund or limit scope of pilots
- Ignore recommendations from citizen processes
- Frame innovations as "undemocratic" despite irony

### Conservative Critics

**Primary Objection**: Mob rule / challenge to constitutional order

**Arguments Made**:

| Argument | Counter-Evidence |
|----------|------------------|
| "We're a republic, not a democracy" | Deliberative processes are republican, not mob rule |
| "Citizens' assemblies are unconstitutional" | Advisory bodies clearly constitutional |
| "Direct democracy leads to tyranny" | Sortition is not direct democracy; includes deliberation |
| "Special interests will capture" | Random selection harder to capture than elections |

**Publications/Institutions**:

- Heritage Foundation: Skeptical of participatory innovations
- National Review: Occasional critique
- Claremont Institute: Originalist objections

### Progressive Critics (Some)

**Primary Objection**: Process vs. outcomes

**Arguments Made**:

| Argument | Counter-Evidence |
|----------|------------------|
| "Deliberation delays urgent action" | Well-designed processes can be efficient |
| "Random citizens might oppose progressive goals" | Evidence shows deliberation often produces progressive outcomes |
| "Process reform distracts from substance" | Process shapes substance |
| "Elite capture of facilitation" | Can be addressed through design |

**Concern**: Resources spent on process innovation could go to direct organizing

### Status Quo Beneficiaries

**Lobbyists and Organized Interests**:

- Know how to influence current system
- Random citizens less susceptible to lobbying
- Deliberation might produce different outcomes

**Political Consultants**:

- Election-focused business model
- Citizen engagement less lucrative
- Different skills required

**Some Academics**:

- Skeptical of citizen competence
- Prefer expert-driven policy
- "Epistocracy" arguments (rule by the knowledgeable)

## Common Arguments Against Innovation

### "Citizens Are Uninformed"

**The Argument**:

Average citizens lack the knowledge to make complex policy decisions. Deliberative processes elevate ignorant opinions.

**The Evidence Against**:

| Finding | Source |
|---------|--------|
| Citizens' assemblies produce sophisticated recommendations | Ireland, France, Canada evaluations |
| Deliberation increases knowledge | Deliberative polling studies |
| Random citizens outperform partisan legislators on some metrics | British Columbia assembly analysis |
| Informed citizens often reach different conclusions than elites | Fishkin's research |

**The Real Issue**:

- Question isn't uninformed vs. informed
- Question is: Whose values should guide policy?
- Experts can inform; citizens should decide values

### "It's Undemocratic"

**The Argument**:

Randomly selected bodies aren't elected; giving them power is undemocratic.

**The Counter-Arguments**:

| Point | Explanation |
|-------|-------------|
| Democracy isn't just elections | Direct participation is democratic |
| Sortition has democratic pedigree | Athenians considered it more democratic than election |
| Random selection IS representation | Statistically representative of population |
| Advisory bodies don't replace elections | Complement, not substitute |

**The Irony**:

Current system where policy reflects donor preferences is less democratic than citizen deliberation.

### "It's Too Expensive"

**The Argument**:

Deliberative processes are costly. Resources should go to other priorities.

**The Reality**:

| Process | Typical Cost | Comparison |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Citizens' assembly (50-100 people, multi-day) | $500K-$2M | Less than one 30-second Super Bowl ad |
| Participatory budgeting | $50K-$200K/year | Tiny fraction of budget being allocated |
| Deliberative poll | $200K-$500K | Less than most consultant contracts |

**Cost-Benefit**:

- Better decisions may save money long-term
- Legitimacy has value
- Compare to cost of elections, lobbying

### "It Can Be Manipulated"

**The Argument**:

Processes can be designed to produce predetermined outcomes. Facilitators can bias discussions.

**Safeguards**:

| Safeguard | How It Helps |
|-----------|--------------|
| Random selection | Can't stack the deck |
| Transparent process | Public observation |
| Multiple information sources | Not controlled by one perspective |
| Independent facilitation | Professional, neutral facilitators |
| Participant control | Participants shape agenda |

**Comparison**:

Elections and lobbying are MORE susceptible to manipulation than well-designed deliberation.

### "It's Too Slow"

**The Argument**:

Deliberation takes time. Government needs to act quickly.

**The Counter**:

| Consideration | Response |
|---------------|----------|
| Most decisions aren't emergencies | Time for deliberation exists |
| Fast bad decisions are costly | Deliberation improves quality |
| Legislatures are slow too | Citizens' assemblies can be faster |
| Implementation is separate | Quick implementation possible after deliberation |

**Appropriate Use**:

Not all decisions need citizen deliberation. Reserve for major, contested issues.

### "It Won't Scale"

**The Argument**:

330 million Americans can't all participate. What about scale?

**The Response**:

| Approach | How It Works |
|----------|--------------|
| Statistical sampling | 100-500 people can represent millions |
| Tiered systems | Local feeds into state; state into federal |
| Digital tools | Technology enables broader participation |
| Multiple assemblies | Different topics, different groups |

**The Model**:

Juries work at scale. So can other sortition-based bodies.

### "Citizens Don't Want This"

**The Argument**:

If people wanted more participation, they'd demand it. Low turnout shows disengagement.

**The Evidence**:

| Finding | Source |
|---------|--------|
| Most citizens would participate if asked | Survey research |
| Low turnout reflects poor options, not disinterest | Participation research |
| Deliberative poll participants highly engaged | Fishkin's data |
| PB participants return year after year | NYC, Chicago data |

**The Problem**:

People can't demand what they don't know exists. Low awareness, not low interest.

## Opposition Strategies

### Ignore and Marginalize

**Tactic**: Don't acknowledge innovations; treat as fringe ideas

**How It Works**:

- Media coverage minimal
- Politicians don't discuss
- Not taught in civics education
- Seems "impractical" because unknown

**Counter**: Build awareness through local success stories

### Co-opt and Weaken

**Tactic**: Adopt nominal participation but drain it of power

**How It Works**:

- Create advisory bodies with no authority
- Run poorly designed processes
- Ignore recommendations
- Declare "we tried, it didn't work"

**Counter**: Demand genuine authority; build in accountability

### Attack and Discredit

**Tactic**: Critique specific failures to undermine concept

**How It Works**:

- Point to poorly designed processes
- Highlight any controversial recommendations
- Frame as "mob rule" or "elite manipulation"
- Suggest alternatives are working

**Counter**: Ensure high-quality implementation; document successes

### Legal and Procedural Barriers

**Tactic**: Use rules to prevent or limit innovations

**How It Works**:

- Claim constitutional barriers
- Require legislative action that won't pass
- Impose onerous procedural requirements
- Defund existing programs

**Counter**: Work within existing authority; build political support

## Case Studies of Opposition

### Alaska Citizens' Assembly on Elections (Resistance)

**What Happened**:

- Proposed citizens' assembly on election reform
- Political parties opposed
- Framed as "outsiders" interfering
- Proposal didn't advance

**Lesson**: Political parties resist threats to their control

### France Climate Convention (Partial Subversion)

**What Happened**:

- 150-member assembly produced 149 proposals
- Macron initially promised to adopt all
- Many proposals watered down or rejected
- "Without filter" promise not honored

**Lesson**: Executive commitment must be binding, not rhetorical

### California Citizens Redistricting (Ongoing Attacks)

**What Happened**:

- Independent commission created by initiative (2008, 2010)
- Politicians and parties resisted
- Legal challenges (unsuccessful)
- Ongoing efforts to weaken

**Lesson**: Reforms need defenders even after adoption

## Addressing Opposition

### For "Citizens Are Uninformed"

**Response Strategy**:

1. **Evidence**: Point to successful assemblies worldwide
2. **Design**: Include learning phase with balanced information
3. **Framing**: Distinguish values (citizen domain) from facts (expert input)
4. **Comparison**: Ask if current system produces informed decisions

### For "It's Undemocratic"

**Response Strategy**:

1. **History**: Cite Athenian origins of sortition as democratic
2. **Statistics**: Explain representative sampling
3. **Complementarity**: Frame as addition to, not replacement of, elections
4. **Current failure**: Note how undemocratic current system is

### For Political Opposition

**Response Strategy**:

1. **Build demand**: Educate public about innovations
2. **Find champions**: Some politicians support participation
3. **Start local**: Pilot where opposition weakest
4. **Create facts**: Successful implementations silence critics

### For Cultural Opposition

**Response Strategy**:

1. **Bipartisan framing**: "Give regular people a voice"
2. **American values**: Link to jury system, town meetings
3. **Practical focus**: Emphasize problem-solving, not ideology
4. **Gradual expansion**: Build trust through success

## The Fundamental Debate

**The Opposition View**:

- Democracy = elections
- Citizens choose representatives
- Representatives make decisions
- Expertise guides policy
- Stability and order valued

**The Innovation View**:

- Democracy = ongoing participation
- Elections are necessary but insufficient
- Citizens can deliberate on values
- Experts inform, citizens decide
- Legitimacy and responsiveness valued

**The Resolution**:

Both views contain truth. The question is balance. Current U.S. system tilts too far toward representation without participation.
