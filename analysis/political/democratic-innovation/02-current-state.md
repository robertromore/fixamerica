# Democratic Innovation: Current State

## The Problem Today

### America's Participation Deficit

The United States offers citizens few meaningful opportunities to participate in governance beyond voting:

**What Most Americans Can Do**:

- Vote every 2-4 years
- Attend poorly-publicized public hearings
- Submit comments on regulations (rarely read)
- Contact representatives (form letter response)
- Sign petitions (symbolic only)

**What Exists in Other Democracies**:

- Citizens' assemblies making binding recommendations
- Participatory budgeting deciding real allocations
- Sortition bodies with legislative authority
- Digital platforms for ongoing policy input
- Deliberative polls informing major decisions

### The Gap Between Promise and Practice

| Democratic Ideal | American Reality |
|------------------|------------------|
| Government by the people | Government by elected representatives and their donors |
| Informed citizenry | Citizens have limited access to policy deliberation |
| Equal voice | Wealthy and organized interests dominate |
| Responsive government | Policy reflects elite preferences, not public preferences |
| Civic engagement | Low voter turnout; minimal inter-election participation |

## Key Statistics

### Public Engagement Levels

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Voter turnout (presidential) | 62-66% | Census Bureau |
| Voter turnout (midterm) | 40-50% | Census Bureau |
| Attended public meeting (past year) | 12% | Pew Research |
| Contacted elected official (past year) | 22% | Pew Research |
| Ever participated in local government process | 18% | National Civic League |

### Trust and Legitimacy

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Trust in federal government | 20% |
| Trust in state government | 35% |
| Trust in local government | 45% |
| Belief "government is run for benefit of all" | 19% |
| Satisfaction with "the way democracy is working" | 38% |

### Awareness of Innovations

| Innovation | American Awareness |
|------------|-------------------|
| Participatory budgeting | 8% |
| Citizens' assemblies | 4% |
| Deliberative polling | 2% |
| Sortition/random selection | 6% |

## Current Innovations in the U.S.

### Participatory Budgeting

**Scale**: Approximately 30 U.S. cities, most at small scale

**Major Programs**:

| City | Annual Allocation | Participants | Since |
|------|------------------|--------------|-------|
| New York City | $40 million | 100,000+ | 2011 |
| Chicago | $1 million | 30,000+ | 2009 |
| Boston | $1.5 million | 15,000+ | 2014 |
| Seattle | $2 million | 20,000+ | 2015 |
| Cambridge, MA | $500,000 | 8,000+ | 2014 |

**Limitations**:

- Small percentage of total budget
- Capital projects only (usually)
- Limited to local level
- No state or federal programs

### Citizens' Assemblies and Panels

**Formal, Government-Sponsored**:

| Location | Year | Topic | Outcome |
|----------|------|-------|---------|
| Oregon Citizens' Initiative Review | 2010+ | Ballot measures | Ongoing; panels evaluate initiatives |
| California (CCCC) | 2020 | Various | Community college pilot |
| Washington state | 2018 | Various | Legislature-commissioned panels |
| Arizona | 2019 | Water policy | Advisory panel |

**The Oregon Model**:

Oregon's Citizens' Initiative Review (CIR) is the most established U.S. example:

- Randomly selected panelists (20-24 citizens)
- Review ballot measures for 5 days
- Produce citizen statements for voter guides
- Funded by the state
- Used since 2010; institutionalized

### Deliberative Polling

**Academic and Nonprofit-Led**:

- Stanford's Center for Deliberative Democracy conducts periodic polls
- AmericaSpeaks (closed 2013) held large-scale deliberations
- America in One Room (2019) brought 500 citizens together
- Local deliberative polls in various cities

**Government-Commissioned**:

- Rare; mostly one-off experiments
- Texas utilities used deliberative polling for energy planning
- No federal adoption

### Digital Democracy Tools

**Municipal Platforms**:

| Platform | U.S. Cities Using |
|----------|-------------------|
| Decidim | Limited pilot use |
| Pol.is | Seattle, Bowling Green |
| Bang the Table | Multiple cities |
| CitizenLab | Several dozen |

**Federal E-Rulemaking**:

- Regulations.gov allows public comments
- Comments rarely influence outcomes
- Format not deliberative

### Town Halls and Public Hearings

**The Traditional Model**:

- Required for many government decisions
- Poorly attended (typically <1% of community)
- Dominated by organized interests
- Not representative; self-selected participants
- Often theatrical rather than deliberative

## International Comparison

### Ireland: The Gold Standard

**Constitutional Conventions**:

| Year | Topic | Outcome |
|------|-------|---------|
| 2012-2014 | Various constitutional issues | Multiple referenda held |
| 2016-2018 | Abortion | Led to successful referendum legalizing abortion |
| 2019-2021 | Gender equality | Recommendations pending |

**Key Features**:

- 99 members: 66 randomly selected citizens + 33 politicians
- Multi-day deliberations with expert input
- Recommendations go to referendum
- High public legitimacy

### France: Climate Citizens' Convention

**Convention Citoyenne pour le Climat (2019-2020)**:

- 150 randomly selected citizens
- Mandate: Reduce emissions 40% while ensuring social justice
- 149 proposals produced
- Mixed government response (some implemented, some rejected)

**Lessons**:

- Citizens can handle complex technical issues
- Government commitment to implementation is crucial
- High public attention and legitimacy

### Taiwan: vTaiwan and Digital Democracy

**vTaiwan Platform**:

- Online deliberation tool using Pol.is
- Identifies consensus positions through iterative discussion
- Used for Uber regulation, e-commerce rules
- Government commits to consider outcomes

**Key Innovation**: Algorithmic identification of common ground across partisan divides.

### Germany: Citizens' Councils

**Bürgerräte**:

- National-level citizens' councils on specific topics
- Randomly selected, demographically representative
- Topics: Climate, democracy, nutrition
- Growing institutionalization

### Belgium: Permanent Citizens' Council

**German-Speaking Community of Belgium**:

- World's first permanent sortition body
- Sets agenda for subsequent citizens' assemblies
- Operates continuously (not one-off)
- Real influence on regional policy

## Why the U.S. Lags

### Structural Barriers

| Barrier | How It Impedes Innovation |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Constitutional rigidity | Amendments nearly impossible; limits federal experimentation |
| Federalism | State-by-state adoption slow and uneven |
| Separation of powers | Congress, courts may block executive experiments |
| Two-party duopoly | Parties resist power-sharing mechanisms |

### Cultural Barriers

| Barrier | How It Impedes Innovation |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Individualism | Preference for individual rights over collective deliberation |
| Distrust of government | Skepticism about government-run processes |
| Anti-expertise sentiment | Resistance to expert-informed deliberation |
| Partisanship | Fear that other side will dominate processes |

### Resource Barriers

| Barrier | How It Impedes Innovation |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Funding | Deliberative processes require investment |
| Expertise | Few practitioners; limited organizational capacity |
| Scale | 330M people; how to scale participation? |

### Political Barriers

| Barrier | How It Impedes Innovation |
|---------|---------------------------|
| Incumbent resistance | Officials fear losing control |
| Donor class opposition | Wealthy interests prefer current access |
| Partisan asymmetry | Different parties may see different risks |
| Short-term thinking | Innovations take years to mature |

## The Gap Between Problem and Solution

| The Problem | The Solution | The Gap |
|-------------|--------------|---------|
| Citizens feel unheard | Mechanisms for citizen voice exist | Lack of adoption in U.S. |
| Policy doesn't reflect public preferences | Deliberative processes surface informed preferences | Not connected to decision-making |
| Public distrust of institutions | Participation builds trust | Few opportunities to participate |
| Polarization and division | Deliberation finds common ground | Partisan media drowns out dialogue |
| Elite capture of policy | Random selection ensures representation | Self-selected participation dominates |

## Impact on Different Groups

### Average Citizens

- Minimal opportunities for meaningful participation
- Voice limited to voting and symbolic gestures
- Policy outcomes don't reflect preferences
- Declining trust in democratic institutions

### Marginalized Communities

- Even less access to traditional participation channels
- Random selection could ensure representation
- Participatory budgeting has engaged underrepresented groups
- But current programs reach limited populations

### Local Government Officials

- Some see innovations as threat to authority
- Others welcome citizen input
- Resource constraints limit experimentation
- Success depends on political will

### Reform Organizations

- Growing ecosystem advocating for innovations
- Limited resources compared to other democracy issues
- Building evidence base and practitioner networks
- International connections providing models
