## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Authority

**Federal Citizens' Assemblies**:

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| Congressional power | Advisory bodies within congressional authority |
| Delegation | No delegation of legislative power; advisory only |
| First Amendment | No speech restrictions; participation is voluntary |
| Due process | Adequate procedures for fair selection |

**State Citizens' Assemblies**:

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| State constitutional limits | Must not conflict with state constitution |
| Delegation doctrine | Advisory recommendations avoid delegation issues |
| Equal protection | Random selection treats all citizens equally |
| Initiative/referendum | May interact with existing direct democracy provisions |

### Relationship to Existing Institutions

**Advisory vs. Binding Authority**:

| Model | Authority | Constitutional Basis |
|-------|-----------|---------------------|
| Advisory assembly | Recommendations only | Clearly constitutional |
| Agenda-setting body | Prioritizes issues | Within legislative rules |
| Initiative review | Informs voters | First Amendment, elections |
| Binding decisions | Makes policy | Requires constitutional amendment |

**Safeguards**:

- Clear advisory status
- Legislative response requirement (but not binding)
- Transparency requirements
- Preserved legislative authority
