# Political Reform: History

## Origins

### Constitutional Design (1787)

The Founders created a system with intentional friction:

- **Separation of powers**: Executive, legislative, judicial branches checking each other
- **Federalism**: Power divided between federal and state governments
- **Indirect democracy**: Senators appointed by state legislatures; Electoral College for president
- **Limited franchise**: Only white male property owners could vote

Critically, the Constitution did not mention:

- Political parties (which the Founders generally distrusted)
- Specific voting methods
- How districts should be drawn

These omissions created space for the systems that would later cause dysfunction.

### Early Party Formation (1790s-1820s)

Despite Founders' warnings about "factions":

- Federalists vs. Democratic-Republicans emerged almost immediately
- Two-party competition became the norm by 1800
- Winner-take-all voting locked in the two-party structure
- "Spoils system" rewarded party loyalty with government jobs

### Jacksonian Democracy (1820s-1850s)

Expansion of democracy, but also of party machines:

- Property requirements for voting eliminated for white men
- Rise of mass party organizations and political machines
- Patronage and corruption became systematic
- Gerrymandering term coined (1812) and practice spread

## Key Turning Points

### The Gilded Age (1870s-1900s)

**The First Era of Money in Politics**

- Robber barons openly purchased politicians
- Senate known as "Millionaires' Club"
- Railroad and industrial monopolies controlled policy
- Voter suppression institutionalized in the South (Jim Crow)

**Progressive Response**

- Direct election of Senators (17th Amendment, 1913)
- Secret ballot adopted
- Primary elections introduced
- Civil service reform reduced patronage
- Antitrust legislation passed

### The Reform Era (1900s-1970s)

**Expanding the Franchise**

- Women's suffrage (19th Amendment, 1920)
- Civil Rights Acts and Voting Rights Act (1964-1965)
- 26th Amendment lowered voting age to 18 (1971)

**Campaign Finance Regulation**

- Federal Corrupt Practices Act (1925)
- Federal Election Campaign Act (1971, 1974)
- Creation of FEC
- Public financing of presidential campaigns
- Contribution limits established

**The High-Water Mark**

- Post-Watergate reforms created strongest campaign finance rules
- Trust in government remained relatively high
- Bipartisan cooperation was common
- Congressional norms of comity held

### The Conservative Counter-Revolution (1970s-2000s)

**The Powell Memo (1971)**

- Lewis Powell's memo to U.S. Chamber of Commerce
- Called for business to organize politically and fund intellectual infrastructure
- Led to creation of Heritage Foundation, Cato Institute, and other think tanks
- Shifted political landscape rightward on economic issues

**Rise of Partisan Media**

- Fairness Doctrine eliminated (1987)
- Talk radio explosion (Rush Limbaugh, 1988)
- Fox News launched (1996)
- Creation of parallel partisan information ecosystems

**Gingrich Revolution (1994)**

- Newt Gingrich transformed congressional norms
- Partisan warfare became strategy
- Compromise reframed as weakness
- Government shutdowns used as leverage

### The Money Flood (2000s-Present)

**Buckley v. Valeo (1976)**

- Supreme Court ruled money = speech
- Opened door to later deregulation

**Citizens United v. FEC (2010)**

- Corporations and unions can spend unlimited money on elections
- Super PACs created
- Dark money proliferated

**McCutcheon v. FEC (2014)**

- Aggregate contribution limits struck down
- Wealthy donors can give to unlimited candidates

### Polarization Acceleration (2000s-Present)

**Redistricting Wars**

- Computer-powered gerrymandering became precise science
- 2010 REDMAP project gave Republicans control of redistricting
- Safe seats proliferated, eliminating competitive districts

**Primary Extremism**

- Tea Party movement primaried moderate Republicans
- Similar dynamics affected Democrats
- Fear of primaries drove politicians to extremes

**Social Media Era**

- Outrage-driven algorithms amplify polarization
- Filter bubbles create separate realities
- Misinformation spreads faster than truth
- Traditional media loses gatekeeping role

## Lessons from the Past

### Reform Is Possible

- The Progressive Era fundamentally transformed American politics
- Civil Rights movement expanded democracy against fierce opposition
- Post-Watergate reforms (briefly) reduced money in politics
- State-level reforms continue to succeed via ballot initiatives

### Reform Requires Crisis

- Major reforms often follow scandals or crises (Watergate, Gilded Age corruption)
- Incremental change faces strong resistance from entrenched interests
- Public outrage can overcome institutional inertia

### Courts Can Advance or Destroy Reform

- Courts expanded voting rights (Warren Court era)
- Courts dismantled campaign finance rules (Roberts Court era)
- Judicial appointments are critical to reform durability

### Money Always Finds a Way

- Each wave of campaign finance reform eventually gets circumvented
- Structural solutions (public financing, constitutional amendments) may be more durable than regulatory patches
- Transparency requirements tend to be more resistant to erosion

### Parties Adapt to Protect Power

- Two major parties consistently resist changes that threaten their duopoly
- Third-party movements get absorbed or marginalized
- Reforms that bypass party gatekeepers (ballot initiatives) tend to be more successful

### Technology Changes the Game

- Printing press enabled mass party organizing
- Television transformed campaigns (1960 Kennedy-Nixon debate)
- Internet/social media disrupted gatekeepers and amplified polarization
- Each technological shift creates new reform opportunities and challenges

### The Cycle Repeats

The pattern is recurring:

1. Corruption or dysfunction becomes intolerable
2. Reform movement gains momentum
3. Structural changes implemented
4. Interests adapt and find new ways to capture the system
5. Dysfunction returns
6. Cycle repeats

**The question for today**: Can we break this cycle with reforms robust enough to resist capture, or are we destined to repeat it?
