# Local Democracy: Overview

## Definition

Local democracy encompasses the structures, processes, and practices through which citizens participate in self-governance at the municipal, county, and neighborhood levels. This includes local elections, citizen engagement mechanisms, participatory budgeting, neighborhood governance, and the relationship between local governments and their residents. Strengthening local democracy is essential for effective self-governance and civic health.

## Why It Matters

Local democracy is the foundation of democratic practice:

- **Daily Impact**: Local government decisions affect daily life most directly
- **Civic Training Ground**: Local engagement builds skills for broader participation
- **Accessibility**: Local government is most accessible to citizens
- **Responsiveness**: Local officials can be more responsive to constituents
- **Laboratory Function**: Local innovation can spread to higher levels
- **Community Building**: Local engagement builds social capital

## Core Issues

### Low Participation

Citizen engagement in local government is often minimal:

| Metric | Typical Level |
|--------|---------------|
| Local election turnout | 15-27% (off-year) |
| City council meeting attendance | Very low |
| Public comment participation | Small fraction of population |
| Knowledge of local officials | Limited |

### Structural Barriers

Various structures limit local democratic participation:

- Off-cycle elections reduce turnout
- At-large elections dilute minority representation
- Lack of ranked choice voting at local level
- Limited access to information about local government
- Meeting times that exclude working people

### State Preemption

States increasingly override local decisions:

| Policy Area | States Preempting |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Minimum wage | 25+ |
| Paid leave | 20+ |
| Plastic bag bans | 15+ |
| Rent control | 30+ |
| Sanctuary policies | 10+ |
| LGBTQ+ protections | Various |

### Resource Constraints

Local governments face significant limitations:

- Limited revenue authority
- Unfunded mandates from federal and state
- Property tax dependence
- Declining federal aid
- Competition among localities

### Representation Gaps

Local government often doesn't reflect the community:

- Demographic disparities (race, age, income)
- Geographic disparities
- Renter vs. homeowner representation
- Working class underrepresentation
- Women underrepresented in many areas

## Types of Local Government

### Municipal Government

**Forms**:

| Form | Description | Prevalence |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Mayor-Council | Elected mayor, council | ~34% of cities |
| Council-Manager | Appointed manager, council | ~55% of cities |
| Commission | Commissioners run departments | ~1% |
| Town Meeting | Direct democracy | New England |

### County Government
