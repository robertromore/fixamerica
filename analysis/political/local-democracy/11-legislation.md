# Local Democracy: Legislation

## Overview

This document provides model legislation to strengthen local democracy, including state legislation to protect local authority and enable electoral reform, as well as local ordinances and charter provisions for municipalities to adopt. Because local government authority derives from state law, many reforms require state-level enabling legislation.

## State Legislation

        democratic government;
    (3) State preemption of local authority has increased
        dramatically in recent years;
    (4) Protection of local authority is necessary for
        effective democratic governance.

    government authority while preserving appropriate state
    oversight.

(a) GENERAL RULE.—Local governments shall have authority to
    enact and enforce ordinances on matters of local concern
    unless state law expressly provides otherwise.

(b) CONSTRUCTION.—State laws shall be construed to preserve
    local authority unless preemption is explicitly stated.

    preempt local authority unless the law includes an
    express statement of preemptive intent.

        for full terms.
