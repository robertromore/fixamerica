# Local Democracy: Overview

Local democracy encompasses the structures, processes, and practices through which citizens participate in self-governance at the municipal, county, and neighborhood levels. This includes local elections, citizen engagement mechanisms, participatory budgeting, neighborhood governance, and the relationship between local governments and their residents. Strengthening local democracy is essential for effective self-governance and civic health.
