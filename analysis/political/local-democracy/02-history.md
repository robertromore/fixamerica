# Local Democracy: History

## Colonial and Founding Era (1620-1789)

### New England Town Meeting

The purest form of local democracy:

- Direct participation by all freemen
- Decisions on taxes, land, roads, schools
- Annual election of selectmen
- Model for democratic self-governance

**Characteristics**:

- Small scale (hundreds, not thousands)
- Relatively homogeneous population
- Property requirements for voting
- Face-to-face deliberation

### Colonial Local Government

Varied by region:

| Region | Pattern |
|--------|---------|
| New England | Town meeting, strong local control |
| Middle Colonies | Mixed county and town |
| Southern Colonies | County-dominated, less local |

### Constitutional Status

Constitution silent on local government:

- Local governments as creatures of state
- No federal constitutional protection
- Dillon's Rule tradition develops
- States control local authority

## 19th Century: Urbanization and Reform

### City Growth

Rapid urbanization created new challenges:

| Year | Urban Population | % of Total |
|------|------------------|------------|
| 1800 | 322,000 | 6% |
| 1850 | 3.5 million | 15% |
| 1900 | 30 million | 40% |

### Machine Politics

Urban political machines emerged:

**Characteristics**:

- Patronage-based politics
- Immigrant voter mobilization
- Service provision in exchange for votes
- Corruption common
- Tammany Hall as exemplar

**Functions**:

- Social services before welfare state
- Immigrant integration
- Job provision
- Neighborhood services

### Progressive Reform Movement

Late 19th-early 20th century reforms:

**Structural Reforms**:

- Council-manager government
- At-large elections
- Nonpartisan elections
- Civil service reform
- Commission government

**Goals**:

- "Good government" efficiency
- Break machine power
- Professional administration
- Reduce corruption

**Consequences**:

- Often reduced immigrant/minority participation
- Shifted power to professional class
- Created more efficient but less representative government
- Diluted neighborhood-based politics

### Home Rule Movement

Push for local autonomy:

- Missouri first home rule state (1875)
- California, Washington follow
- Constitutional home rule provisions
- Varied scope of authority

## Early-Mid 20th Century (1900-1960)

### Council-Manager Spread

Professional management movement:

| Year | Cities with Council-Manager |
|------|----------------------------|
| 1920 | ~100 |
| 1940 | ~300 |
| 1960 | ~1,600 |
| Today | ~3,500+ |

### Suburban Growth

Post-WWII suburbanization:

- New municipalities created
- White flight from cities
- Fragmented metropolitan governance
- Resource disparities deepen

### Federal-Local Relations

New Deal created federal-local connections:

- Public works funding

### Civil Rights at Local Level

Local government as site of struggle:

### Local Democracy Innovations

Counter-trend of democratic innovation:

## Patterns and Lessons

### Recurring Tensions

| Tension | Historical Pattern |
|---------|-------------------|
| Efficiency vs. participation | Progressive reforms, manager movement |
| Professional vs. political | Ongoing debate |
| Local vs. state | Dillon's Rule vs. Home Rule |
| Representation vs. competence | Machine vs. reform arguments |

### Reform Cycles

- Machine politics → Progressive reform
- Professional dominance → Community control push
- Community action → Retrenchment
- Current: State preemption vs. local innovation

### Scale and Democracy

Persistent questions:

- How large can direct democracy scale?
- What roles for neighborhood vs. city-wide?
- How to balance efficiency and participation?
- Who participates in "open" processes?
