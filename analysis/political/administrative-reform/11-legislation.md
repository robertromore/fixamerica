# Administrative Reform: Legislation

## Overview

This document provides model legislation for administrative reform, including federal statutes to protect the civil service, strengthen agency independence, combat regulatory capture, and improve the federal workforce. Effective reform requires statutory protection that cannot be undone by executive action alone.

## Federal Legislation

### Preventing a Patronage System Act

**Purpose**: Prohibit the creation of Schedule F or equivalent excepted service classifications that strip civil service protections.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Preventing a Patronage System
Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that—
(1) the merit-based civil service has served the United
    States effectively for over a century;
(2) civil service protections prevent partisan manipulation
    of the federal workforce;
(3) Schedule F and similar proposals would convert career
    positions to at-will employment;
(4) such conversion would enable political purges and
    undermine government effectiveness;
(5) statutory protection is necessary to preserve the
    merit system.

SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON EXCEPTED SERVICE CONVERSIONS.

(a) PROHIBITION.—No position in the competitive service
    may be converted to the excepted service, except—
    (1) by Act of Congress; or
    (2) pursuant to regulations that have been—
        (A) submitted to Congress; and
        (B) approved by joint resolution.

(b) SCHEDULE F PROHIBITION.—No schedule of positions within
    the excepted service may be created that—
    (1) encompasses positions of a confidential,
        policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-
        advocating character; and
    (2) removes civil service protections from positions
        previously in the competitive service.

        (B) opportunity to respond; and
        (C) right of appeal to the Merit Systems
            Protection Board.

(b) RECLASSIFICATION.—No position may be reclassified
    from the competitive service to the excepted service
    while occupied, unless the incumbent consents or is
    provided full adverse action protections.

SEC. 5. MERIT SYSTEMS PROTECTION BOARD.

(a) JURISDICTION.—The Board shall have jurisdiction over
    any action that affects civil service protections.

(b) EXPEDITED REVIEW.—Challenges to mass reclassifications
    shall be entitled to expedited review.

    (3) award compensatory damages for violations.

SEC. 6. PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.

An employee whose civil service protections are threatened
or violated may bring an action in federal district court
for declaratory and injunctive relief.
