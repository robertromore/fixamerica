# Administrative Reform: Political Perspectives Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes administrative reform through nine distinct political perspectives, evaluating current state assessments, root cause analyses, proposed solutions, and legislation. Each perspective receives faith-level ratings and position scores, culminating in compromise proposals that bridge multiple viewpoints.

## Perspective Definitions

| Perspective | Core Values | Policy Orientation |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Tradition, limited government, individual responsibility | Incremental change, fiscal restraint, market solutions |
| Liberal | Progress, equality, social responsibility | Government as problem-solver, regulation, safety nets |
| Progressive | Systemic change, economic justice, structural reform | Transformative reform, wealth redistribution, worker power |
| Libertarian | Individual liberty, minimal state, free markets | Deregulation, privatization, voluntary association |
| Constitutionalist | Original intent, enumerated powers, federalism | Strict constitutional limits, states' rights |
| Populist | Anti-elite, pro-worker, economic nationalism | Trade protection, anti-monopoly, immigration restriction |
| Centrist | Pragmatism, compromise, incremental progress | Bipartisan solutions, evidence-based policy |
| Religious Right | Faith-based values, traditional morality | Social conservatism, religious liberty |
| Democratic Socialist | Worker ownership, public goods, democratic control | Public investment, labor rights, universal programs |

## Scoring Framework

### Position Scores (1-10)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10 | Full agreement with project analysis |
| 7-9 | Substantial to strong agreement |
| 5-6 | Mixed/moderate agreement |
| 3-4 | Substantial disagreement |
| 1-2 | Strong opposition |

### Faith Levels (1-5)

| Level | Label | Indicators |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 5 | Full Good Faith | Stated motivations = actual motivations; consistent principles across contexts |
| 4 | Mostly Good Faith | Genuine beliefs with minor strategic exceptions |
| 3 | Mixed Faith | Some genuine concerns combined with some strategic positioning |
| 2 | Mostly Bad Faith | Pretextual objections; goalposts move; selective principle application |
| 1 | Full Bad Faith | Pure obstruction; zero-sum warfare; oppose because opponents support |

**Bad Faith Indicators:**

- Hidden interests (stated vs actual motivations differ significantly)
- Zero-sum mindset (oppose proposals because opponents support them)
- Movable goalposts (shifting objections when concerns are addressed)
- Selective principle application (principles apply only when convenient)
- Pretextual arguments (stated reasons not the real reasons)

### Legislation Status Reference (as of January 2025)

| Bill/Amendment | Type | Current Status | Last Action |
|----------------|------|----------------|-------------|
| Preventing a Patronage System Act | Federal | Model legislation | Drafted as reform proposal |
| Federal Agency Independence Protection Act | Federal | Model legislation | Drafted as reform proposal |
| Federal Regulatory Integrity Act | Federal | Model legislation | Drafted as reform proposal |
| Federal Workforce Modernization Act | Federal | Model legislation | Drafted as reform proposal |

## Perspective Analyses

### Conservative Perspective

#### Faith Level Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Faith**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Significant divergence: "accountability" and "efficiency" rhetoric often masks desire for political control over agencies that regulate conservative policy priorities |
| Principle consistency | Inconsistent: supports civil service protections for military and law enforcement while opposing them for environmental and social program agencies; opposes "deep state" while expanding political appointees |
| Goalpost stability | Moderate instability: Schedule F rationale shifted from "accountability" to "firing resisters" to "policy-influencing positions" as objections were raised |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate: opposes some reforms simply because Democrats support them, but genuine philosophical disagreements exist on agency independence |

**Justification:** Conservative positions on administrative reform reflect a genuine philosophical preference for executive control and smaller government, but these principles are applied selectively. Support for presidential control over agencies correlates strongly with which party holds the presidency. The "deep state" framing emerged primarily after career employees implemented policies conservatives opposed (environmental regulations, ACA implementation), suggesting reactive rather than principled concerns. However, conservatives do have consistent objections to regulatory overreach and bureaucratic inefficiency that predate recent partisan conflicts.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- **Schedule F timing:** Executive Order 13957 creating Schedule F was issued in October 2020, weeks before the election, suggesting political timing rather than principled reform. Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 explicitly calls for mass firings of career employees.
- **Selective support for agency independence:** Conservatives defended Federal Reserve independence under Obama but were less critical when Trump pressured the Fed on interest rates. Heritage Foundation 2016 vs. 2020 positions on agency independence shifted based on which party controlled the executive.
- **Unitary executive theory selective application:** Conservative legal scholars invoke unitary executive theory to challenge CFPB structure but not for agencies like the Federal Reserve or FDIC that financial industry allies prefer remain independent.
- **Bipartisan history:** The Pendleton Act establishing civil service had Republican support; Reagan administration initially supported merit principles before emphasizing deregulation.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Agrees workforce faces challenges, confirmation is slow, and agencies can be inefficient; strongly disagrees with framing of Schedule F as threat rather than reform; disputes characterization of "anti-government ideology" as pejorative |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | Agrees some causes (APA burden, hiring process problems, political polarization) but fundamentally disagrees that civil service protections are too weak; sees root cause as excessive bureaucratic insulation from elected leadership |

**Source references:**

- Heritage Foundation. "Blueprint for Reorganization." 2023. Argues federal workforce is "bloated" and proposes Schedule F revival.
- American Enterprise Institute. "Civil Service Reform." Supports performance-based reforms but has more nuanced position on protections.
- Federalist Society white papers on unitary executive theory and agency independence.
- Republican Party Platform 2024: calls for "draining the swamp" and restoring presidential control over executive branch.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Civil Service Statutory Protection | 2/10 | "Entrenches unaccountable bureaucracy" | Limits future administration's ability to implement agenda; protects employees who may resist conservative policies |
| Enhanced Due Process | 3/10 | "Makes it even harder to fire poor performers" | Genuine concern about inefficiency, but also desire for easier political removals |
| Agency Independence Redesign | 3/10 | "Unconstitutional limits on executive power" | Unitary executive theory; desire for presidential control over regulatory agencies |
| Protect Expertise | 4/10 | "Creates unaccountable fourth branch" | Some genuine concern about politicized science, but mostly objects to insulating regulators from political oversight |
| Structural Anti-Capture | 6/10 | "Revolving door restrictions reasonable, but public advocate creates more bureaucracy" | Shares concern about capture, particularly of agencies they see as captured by progressive interests; less concerned about industry capture |
| Accountability Mechanisms | 5/10 | "GAO oversight fine; capture audits could be weaponized" | Supports accountability in theory but wary of tools that might be used against conservative administrations |
| Hiring Reform | 8/10 | "Streamlined hiring is long overdue" | Genuine agreement that federal hiring is too slow; aligns with efficiency priorities |
| Compensation Reform | 5/10 | "Federal employees already well-compensated compared to private sector" | Skeptical of federal pay increases; prefers market-based solutions |
| Retention and Development | 5/10 | "Some training appropriate, but should reduce workforce, not invest in it" | Philosophical preference for smaller government trumps workforce investment |
| Manager Empowerment | 8/10 | "Managers need tools to hold employees accountable" | Strongly supports making it easier to discipline or remove employees |
| Technology Modernization | 7/10 | "Government IT is embarrassing; modernization needed" | Supports efficiency improvements; some concern about cost |
| Streamlined Confirmation | 7/10 | "Senate should confirm nominees faster" | Supports when their party holds presidency; has used delay tactics when opposition party holds executive |
| Reduced Appointee Positions | 2/10 | "Need more political appointees, not fewer" | Wants to expand political control, not reduce it |
| Streamlined Rulemaking | 7/10 | "Regulatory burden is excessive" | Supports faster process but would use it for deregulation, not new rules |
| Regulatory Certainty | 6/10 | "Agree regulations change too often" | Supports regulatory certainty when it locks in deregulation; less supportive when it protects progressive regulations |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Preventing a Patronage System Act | 2/10 | "Unconstitutional constraint on executive power; entrenches bureaucratic resistance" | Directly blocks Schedule F and similar approaches; seen as protecting "deep state" |
| Federal Agency Independence Protection Act | 2/10 | "Violates unitary executive; creates unconstitutional fourth branch" | Would limit presidential control over agencies conservatives want to rein in (CFPB, EPA, etc.) |
| Federal Regulatory Integrity Act | 5/10 | "Revolving door provisions acceptable; public advocate and intervenor funding expand bureaucracy" | Mixed: supports some anti-capture measures but opposes provisions seen as empowering progressive advocates |
| Federal Workforce Modernization Act | 5/10 | "Hiring reform good; compensation increases unwarranted; $500M authorization excessive" | Supports efficiency provisions; opposes spending and pay increases |

#### Alternative Proposals

Conservatives would prefer:

1. **Schedule F Revival:** Reclassify policy-influencing positions as at-will employment to ensure responsiveness to elected leadership.

2. **REINS Act:** Require congressional approval for major regulations, limiting agency discretion.

3. **Regulatory Budget:** Cap total regulatory costs agencies can impose, forcing prioritization and reduction.

4. **Agency Sunset Provisions:** Require periodic reauthorization of agencies, forcing Congress to evaluate necessity.

5. **Performance-Based Reforms:** Make it easier to remove poor performers without stripping all civil service protections; focus on accountability over protection.

6. **Competitive Sourcing:** Expand contracting out of government functions to private sector where feasible.

7. **Unitary Executive Enforcement:** Litigate to establish presidential removal authority over all executive branch officials.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Libertarian (on reducing bureaucracy), Constitutionalist (on unitary executive), Religious Right (on limiting agencies that regulate social issues)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (on hiring reform, technology modernization, some anti-capture measures), Populist (on anti-capture for certain industries)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist, Liberal (fundamental disagreement on administrative state role and civil service protections)

---

### Liberal Perspective

#### Faith Level Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Good Faith**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Generally aligned: support for civil service reflects genuine belief in professional, expert-driven government; some union-interest overlap but not primarily driven by it |
| Principle consistency | Consistent: support for agency independence and merit principles applies regardless of which party holds executive; defended civil service under both Obama and Trump |
| Goalpost stability | Stable: same core arguments for merit system over decades |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low: willing to engage on genuine efficiency reforms; open to bipartisan workforce improvements |

**Justification:** Liberal positions on administrative reform reflect genuine commitment to effective, expert-driven government. Support for civil service protections is consistent across administrations and predates recent partisan conflicts. While there is some alignment with federal employee unions, the core argument for merit-based civil service is principled rather than interest-driven. Liberals have historically supported some management flexibility reforms when paired with adequate worker protections, demonstrating willingness to compromise.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- **Cross-administration consistency:** Democrats supported civil service protections under Reagan, Bush, and Trump, not just when seeking to protect friendly agencies.
- **Support for efficiency reforms:** Obama administration pursued hiring reform and performance management improvements, showing willingness to address legitimate concerns.
- **Think tank positions:** Brookings Institution, Center for American Progress have consistently advocated merit principles and agency independence across administrations.
- **Historical record:** Democratic support for Pendleton Act, Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, Hatch Act protections shows long-term commitment to merit principles.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Agrees with most factual claims about workforce challenges, confirmation delays, and threats to merit system; might emphasize different aspects but accepts overall framing |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | Agrees with root cause analysis, particularly regarding political factors and anti-government ideology; would emphasize underfunding and resource constraints more |

**Source references:**

- Brookings Institution. "Rebuilding the Federal Workforce." Multiple reports on civil service reform.
- Center for American Progress. "Protecting the Civil Service." Policy briefs on Schedule F and workforce issues.
- Democratic Party Platform 2024: supports professional civil service and agency independence.

| Accountability Mechanisms | 8/10 | "Transparency and oversight improve government" | Supports accountability; wants balanced approach |
| Hiring Reform | 7/10 | "Faster hiring needed, but must maintain merit principles" | Supports streamlining with safeguards; concerned about maintaining quality and diversity |
| Compensation Reform | 8/10 | "Federal employees deserve competitive pay" | Strong support for pay increases; sees as investment in effective government |
| Retention and Development | 9/10 | "Investing in workforce improves government" | Very strong support; sees workforce investment as essential |
| Manager Empowerment | 6/10 | "Some flexibility appropriate with safeguards" | Cautious support; worried about potential for abuse without protections |
| Technology Modernization | 8/10 | "Government needs modern tools" | Strong support; wants adequate funding |
| Streamlined Confirmation | 7/10 | "Confirmation should be faster, but Senate oversight matters" | Supports reform but concerned about weakening advice and consent |
| Reduced Appointee Positions | 7/10 | "Too many appointees creates instability" | Generally supports more career leadership; some concern about reducing democratic accountability |
| Streamlined Rulemaking | 6/10 | "Process improvements okay, but public participation matters" | Cautious; doesn't want to sacrifice public input for speed |
| Regulatory Certainty | 7/10 | "Stability helps planning" | Supports regulatory certainty; concerned about locking in bad regulations |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Preventing a Patronage System Act | 9/10 | "Essential protection against political purges" | Very strong support; sees as necessary defense of merit system |
| Federal Agency Independence Protection Act | 8/10 | "Agencies need protection from political interference" | Strong support; wants expert decision-making preserved |
| Federal Regulatory Integrity Act | 8/10 | "Anti-capture measures long overdue" | Strong support for all provisions including public advocate |
| Federal Workforce Modernization Act | 9/10 | "Comprehensive workforce investment needed" | Very strong support; would potentially increase funding levels |

#### Alternative Proposals

Liberals would support these additional reforms:

1. **Expanded Whistleblower Protections:** Strengthen protections for employees who report wrongdoing.

2. **Diversity and Inclusion Requirements:** Codify requirements for diverse federal workforce.

3. **Collective Bargaining Protections:** Strengthen union rights for federal employees.

4. **Agency Funding Floors:** Prevent starvation of agencies through appropriations manipulation.

5. **Inspector General Independence:** Strengthen protections for IGs from political removal.

6. **Public Service Loan Forgiveness Expansion:** Enhance education debt relief for federal employees.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist (on worker protections, anti-capture), Centrist (on evidence-based reform)
- **Potential bridges:** Conservative (on hiring reform, technology), Populist (on anti-capture measures)
- **Unlikely partners:** Libertarian (fundamental disagreement on administrative state role), Constitutionalist (on agency independence)

### Progressive Perspective

#### Faith Level Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Good Faith**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Largely aligned: support for strong administrative state reflects genuine belief in government's role protecting workers, consumers, and environment; some labor union interest overlap but principled |
| Principle consistency | Highly consistent: progressive support for effective regulation and worker protections applies across contexts; critical of both parties when they fail these principles |
| Goalpost stability | Very stable: same core demands for decades |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low: progressives have opposed Democratic administrations on capture and regulatory weakness, showing issue-based rather than partisan approach |

**Justification:** Progressive positions on administrative reform stem from genuine commitment to using government power to protect ordinary people from concentrated corporate power. Progressives have been consistently critical of regulatory capture regardless of which party controls the executive, criticizing both Republican deregulation and Democratic coziness with industry. Support for civil service protections reflects belief that professional expertise should guide policy, not political pressure from either party. The slight reduction from full good faith reflects occasional strategic alliance with anti-government forces to oppose specific captured agencies.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- **Cross-party criticism:** Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders criticized Obama administration regulatory appointees from Wall Street; progressives opposed TPP under Democratic president.
- **Consistent anti-capture position:** Progressive organizations (Public Citizen, Revolving Door Project) monitor and criticize capture under both parties.
- **Labor rights focus:** Support for federal employee unions is consistent with broader labor rights agenda.
- **Historical record:** Progressive Era origins of civil service reform, consistent support for strong agencies since New Deal.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strongly agrees with analysis; would emphasize regulatory capture and corporate influence even more |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | Agrees with root causes; would add more emphasis on corporate power and systematic defunding by hostile administrations |

**Source references:**

- Public Citizen reports on regulatory capture and revolving door.
- Revolving Door Project analysis of agency appointments.
- Roosevelt Institute policy proposals on administrative state.
- Congressional Progressive Caucus policy positions.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Civil Service Statutory Protection | 10/10 | "Absolutely essential to prevent authoritarian capture" | Sees Schedule F as existential threat to democratic government |
| Enhanced Due Process | 9/10 | "Workers must be protected from political retaliation" | Very strong support for worker rights |
| Agency Independence Redesign | 9/10 | "Agencies must be insulated from both political and corporate pressure" | Strong support; wants independence from industry as well as politicians |
| Protect Expertise | 10/10 | "Science and expertise must drive policy" | Highest priority; sees politicization of science as dangerous |
| Structural Anti-Capture | 10/10 | "Anti-capture is the central issue" | Strongest possible support; sees capture as undermining democratic governance |
| Accountability Mechanisms | 9/10 | "Need robust tools to identify and address capture" | Strong support; wants mechanisms that can challenge corporate influence |
| Hiring Reform | 7/10 | "Streamlining okay if it doesn't sacrifice quality or diversity" | Supports but concerned about potential shortcuts that undermine merit |
| Compensation Reform | 9/10 | "Federal workers deserve living wages and competitive pay" | Strong support; frames as worker rights issue |
| Retention and Development | 9/10 | "Investing in workers is essential" | Strong support for workforce investment |
| Manager Empowerment | 5/10 | "Management flexibility cannot come at workers' expense" | Cautious; worried about abuse potential; wants strong union oversight |
| Technology Modernization | 7/10 | "Modernization fine, but watch for privatization schemes" | Supports but concerned about tech industry capture of procurement |
| Streamlined Confirmation | 6/10 | "Faster confirmation, but need thorough vetting for capture" | Wants speed but prioritizes identifying industry-captured nominees |
| Reduced Appointee Positions | 8/10 | "Fewer political appointees means less capture opportunity" | Supports; sees career officials as more resistant to industry pressure |
| Streamlined Rulemaking | 5/10 | "Cannot sacrifice public participation for speed" | Cautious; public comment is key tool against industry dominance |
| Regulatory Certainty | 6/10 | "Stability can entrench weak regulations" | Mixed; doesn't want to lock in captured regulations |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Preventing a Patronage System Act | 10/10 | "Non-negotiable protection against authoritarian takeover" | Highest priority legislation |
| Federal Agency Independence Protection Act | 9/10 | "Critical protection for expert decision-making" | Very strong support |
| Federal Regulatory Integrity Act | 10/10 | "The most important of these bills; anti-capture is essential" | Especially values public advocate and transparency provisions |
| Federal Workforce Modernization Act | 8/10 | "Good start but could go further on compensation" | Strong support; would increase authorized amounts |

#### Alternative Proposals

Progressives would add:

1. **Industry Funding Ban:** Prohibit industries from funding regulatory agencies they're regulated by (end "user fees" capture).

2. **Public Advocate Expansion:** Create public advocates with real enforcement power, not just advisory role.

3. **Mandatory Capture Audits:** Regular external review of regulatory outcomes vs. public interest.

4. **Lifetime Lobbying Ban:** Former agency officials permanently barred from lobbying their former agency.

5. **Deferred Prosecution Reform:** Stronger accountability when agencies settle with industry instead of prosecuting.

6. **Public Interest Standing:** Expand citizen standing to challenge captured regulatory decisions.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Democratic Socialist (on anti-capture, worker rights), Liberal (on civil service protection, expertise)
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (on anti-capture, anti-elite), Libertarian (on some civil liberties aspects)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative, Religious Right (fundamental disagreement on role of administrative state)

---

### Libertarian Perspective

#### Faith Level Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Good Faith**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Generally consistent: opposition to administrative state reflects genuine philosophical commitment to limited government; some corporate interest overlap but principled |
| Principle consistency | Mostly consistent: opposes regulatory agencies across contexts; occasional inconsistency when supporting some agency actions that protect individual liberty |
| Goalpost stability | Stable: same core critique of administrative state for decades |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low: libertarians criticize both parties' expansion of state power; willing to make common cause across ideological lines on civil liberties |

**Justification:** Libertarian positions on administrative reform reflect genuine philosophical commitment to minimal government and individual liberty. Unlike conservatives, libertarians consistently oppose administrative state expansion regardless of which party proposes it, and criticize conservative administrations for expanding executive power. The anti-capture analysis partially aligns with libertarian concerns about government serving special interests rather than public interest. Score reduced from full good faith because some libertarian organizations receive substantial corporate funding, creating potential conflict between stated principles and donor interests on specific regulatory issues.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- **Consistent anti-state position:** Cato Institute criticizes regulatory overreach under both Democratic and Republican administrations.
- **Civil liberties focus:** Libertarians oppose surveillance state, support whistleblower protections, oppose politicization of law enforcement.
- **Regulatory skepticism:** Principled opposition to administrative state predates and transcends partisan politics.
- **Some corporate influence:** Koch network funding of libertarian organizations creates some conflicts on specific regulatory issues.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | Agrees bureaucracy is problematic but for different reasons; sees solution as reducing agencies, not reforming them; agrees on some workforce challenges |
| Root Cause Agreement | 5/10 | Agrees with some causes (APA burden, capture) but sees fundamental problem as existence of administrative state itself, not how it's structured |

**Source references:**

- Cato Institute. "Restoring Constitutional Government." Multiple reports on administrative state.
- Reason Foundation policy analyses on regulation.
- Libertarian Party platform on government size and regulation.
- Pacific Legal Foundation litigation on administrative law.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Civil Service Statutory Protection | 4/10 | "Protects bureaucrats from accountability to elected officials and citizens" | Philosophical opposition to entrenched bureaucracy; but recognizes some protection against political abuse has value |
| Enhanced Due Process | 5/10 | "Due process is important but shouldn't shield government employees from consequences" | Values due process generally; skeptical of special protections for government workers |
| Agency Independence Redesign | 3/10 | "Independent agencies are unconstitutional fourth branch" | Opposes existence of independent agencies; wants them under direct executive control or eliminated |
| Protect Expertise | 4/10 | "Expertise shouldn't be insulated from democratic oversight" | Skeptical of technocratic governance; prefers market mechanisms |
| Structural Anti-Capture | 7/10 | "Capture is real problem that proves agencies serve special interests, not public" | Agrees capture is problem; sees it as inherent to regulation rather than fixable |
| Accountability Mechanisms | 6/10 | "Transparency good; but bureaucratic oversight creates more bureaucracy" | Supports transparency; skeptical of institutional solutions |
| Hiring Reform | 6/10 | "Faster hiring fine, but prefer reducing workforce overall" | Supports efficiency; would rather shrink than improve |
| Compensation Reform | 3/10 | "Federal employees already overcompensated; reduce pay and benefits" | Philosophically opposed to expanding government spending |
| Retention and Development | 3/10 | "Government should be smaller, not better staffed" | Opposes investment in larger government |
| Manager Empowerment | 7/10 | "Managers should be able to fire underperformers" | Supports accountability; aligns with efficiency concerns |
| Technology Modernization | 6/10 | "Efficiency improvements okay; but privatization better" | Prefers private sector solutions |
| Streamlined Confirmation | 6/10 | "Fewer confirmations needed because fewer positions should exist" | Supports reform but would rather eliminate positions |
| Reduced Appointee Positions | 4/10 | "Problem is positions existing, not whether they're appointed" | Would prefer eliminating positions entirely |
| Streamlined Rulemaking | 8/10 | "Fewer regulations better; at least make process faster" | Strong support for reducing regulatory burden |
| Regulatory Certainty | 5/10 | "Certainty about regulations existing is less important than reducing them" | Mixed; prefers eliminating regulations to stabilizing them |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Preventing a Patronage System Act | 4/10 | "Protects bureaucracy from democratic accountability" | Philosophical opposition to entrenched civil service; but some recognition that politicization can be abused |
| Federal Agency Independence Protection Act | 2/10 | "Codifies unconstitutional fourth branch of government" | Strong opposition to agency independence |
| Federal Regulatory Integrity Act | 6/10 | "Anti-capture provisions address real problem; but public advocate expands government" | Mixed; likes transparency, opposes new bureaucratic structures |
| Federal Workforce Modernization Act | 3/10 | "Invests in bureaucracy that should be shrunk" | Opposes expanding or improving government workforce |

#### Alternative Proposals

Libertarians would prefer:

1. **Agency Elimination:** Sunset and eliminate agencies that duplicate state functions or regulate matters better left to markets.

2. **Non-Delegation Revival:** Enforce constitutional limits on congressional delegation to agencies.

3. **Privatization:** Contract out government functions to private sector where feasible.

4. **Regulatory Budgeting:** Hard caps on regulatory costs with mandatory offsetting.

5. **Standing Expansion:** Make it easier for regulated parties to challenge agency actions.

6. **Constitutional Challenges:** Support litigation to constrain administrative state on separation of powers grounds.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (on reducing regulation), Constitutionalist (on limiting agency power)
- **Potential bridges:** Progressive (on civil liberties, anti-surveillance), Populist (on anti-elite sentiment)
- **Unlikely partners:** Liberal, Democratic Socialist (fundamental disagreement on government role)

---

### Constitutionalist Perspective

#### Faith Level Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Faith**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Some divergence: constitutional arguments are genuine but selectively deployed; unitary executive theory promoted more aggressively when Republicans hold presidency |
| Principle consistency | Inconsistent: separation of powers arguments applied strongly to agencies like CFPB but less to agencies conservatives prefer remain independent (Fed, military justice) |
| Goalpost stability | Moderate instability: constitutional theory evolves to support desired policy outcomes |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate: constitutional arguments sometimes used strategically rather than principled |

**Justification:** Constitutionalist positions reflect genuine commitment to original understanding and structural constitutional principles, but application is inconsistent. The same scholars who invoke separation of powers to attack CFPB structure accept similar structures for agencies that serve conservative constituencies. Non-delegation doctrine revival is pushed more aggressively against environmental and consumer regulations than against national security state. However, there is a genuine intellectual tradition of constitutional skepticism about administrative agencies that predates and transcends partisan considerations.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- **Selective application:** Federalist Society scholars challenge CFPB for-cause removal protection but not Federal Reserve structure.
- **Originalism debate:** Genuine scholarly debate about whether administrative state is consistent with constitutional design.
- **Historical inconsistency:** Conservative embrace of executive power under Bush and Trump contrasts with federalism arguments under Obama.
- **Principled scholarship:** Some constitutionalist scholars (like Philip Hamburger) consistently critique administrative state regardless of party.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Agrees with some factual points; strongly disputes framing that treats agency independence as positive rather than constitutional problem |
| Root Cause Agreement | 3/10 | Sees root cause as unconstitutional delegation and agency independence, not political attacks on civil service; fundamental disagreement on problem definition |

**Source references:**

- Hamburger, Philip. *Is Administrative Law Unlawful?* University of Chicago Press, 2014.
- Federalist Society white papers on non-delegation and unitary executive.
- Originalist scholarship on Article II and appointments clause.

|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Civil Service Statutory Protection | 3/10 | "Limits constitutional executive power" | Believes President should have broader removal authority |
| Enhanced Due Process | 4/10 | "Due process for employees shouldn't impede constitutional governance structure" | Values due process but prioritizes constitutional structure |
| Agency Independence Redesign | 2/10 | "Multi-member commissions with for-cause protection violate Article II" | Opposes agency independence on constitutional grounds |
| Protect Expertise | 3/10 | "Expertise cannot override constitutional accountability" | Skeptical of technocracy; prioritizes electoral accountability |
| Structural Anti-Capture | 5/10 | "Capture is problem, but solution is reducing agency power, not restructuring" | Agrees capture exists; different solution |
| Accountability Mechanisms | 5/10 | "Constitutional accountability through elected officials, not bureaucratic oversight" | Prefers political to institutional accountability |

| Regulatory Certainty | 5/10 | "Best certainty is constitutional limits on agency power" | Would prefer structural limits to process reforms |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Preventing a Patronage System Act | 2/10 | "Unconstitutionally limits executive authority" | Views as constraint on Article II power |
| Federal Agency Independence Protection Act | 1/10 | "Codifies unconstitutional structure" | Strong opposition on constitutional grounds |
| Federal Regulatory Integrity Act | 5/10 | "Some provisions acceptable; others expand unconstitutional bureaucracy" | Mixed views on specific provisions |
| Federal Workforce Modernization Act | 4/10 | "Efficiency good; but entrenches problematic civil service structure" | Opposes expanding civil service |

#### Alternative Proposals

Constitutionalists would prefer:

1. **Non-Delegation Enforcement:** Courts should strike down broad congressional delegations to agencies.

2. **Unitary Executive:** All agency heads removable at will by President; eliminate for-cause protection.

3. **Article III Courts:** Transfer adjudication from agencies to Article III courts.

4. **Congressional Approval:** Require congressional ratification of major agency rules (REINS Act).

5. **Originalist Interpretation:** Judicial enforcement of original understanding limiting administrative power.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (on executive control), Libertarian (on limiting agency power)
- **Potential bridges:** Some good government reformers (on structural clarity)
- **Unlikely partners:** Liberal, Progressive, Democratic Socialist (fundamental disagreement on administrative state legitimacy)

### Populist Perspective

#### Faith Level Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Faith**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Significant variation: anti-elite rhetoric is genuine but often deployed to serve elite economic interests; "drain the swamp" rhetoric didn't match Trump administration's corporate appointments |
| Principle consistency | Inconsistent: anti-capture rhetoric applies to agencies regulating populist priorities but not to agencies serving populist base (immigration enforcement, military) |
| Goalpost stability | Unstable: "swamp" definition shifts based on political convenience |
| Zero-sum behavior | High: strong tendency to oppose anything establishment supports, regardless of substance |

**Justification:** Populist positions on administrative reform are genuinely rooted in distrust of elite institutions and frustration with a government that seems to serve connected interests rather than ordinary people. However, populist leaders often channel this sentiment toward goals that don't actually serve working-class interests. The "drain the swamp" rhetoric was not matched by Schedule F implementation focused on environmental and labor agencies rather than Wall Street regulators. Left-populists and right-populists share some concerns about capture but differ dramatically on solutions.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- **"Drain the swamp" disconnect:** Trump administration filled key positions with industry lobbyists while promoting anti-bureaucracy rhetoric.
- **Selective targeting:** Schedule F focus on environmental, labor, and healthcare agencies rather than financial regulators or defense contractors.
- **Left-right populist split:** Bernie Sanders and Trump voters share distrust of institutions but have different targets and solutions.
- **Genuine grievances:** Working-class frustration with government unresponsiveness is real, even if sometimes misdirected.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | Agrees government doesn't work for ordinary people; may disagree on which aspects are problems (left populists focus on capture, right populists on "deep state") |
| Root Cause Agreement | 5/10 | Left populists agree on capture analysis; right populists see "deep state" as root cause; shared anti-elite sentiment, different targets |

2. **Anti-Capture Focus (Left):** Aggressive revolving door restrictions; public financing of regulatory participation.

3. **Transparency:** Expose elite networks; public disclosure of all industry contacts.

4. **Accountability:** Mechanisms to hold both political and career officials accountable to ordinary citizens.

5. **Localism:** Shift power from federal bureaucracy to state and local governments closer to people.

#### Coalition Potential

### Centrist Perspective

#### Faith Level Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Full Good Faith**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Highly aligned: centrist support for effective government reflects genuine commitment to pragmatic, evidence-based policy; process concerns are sincere |
| Principle consistency | Very consistent: support for merit system, efficiency, and balanced reform applies across administrations and contexts |
| Goalpost stability | Stable: same core commitments to good government over time |
| Zero-sum behavior | Very low: centrists actively seek bipartisan solutions and acknowledge valid points across spectrum |

**Justification:** Centrist positions on administrative reform reflect genuine commitment to effective, professional government that serves public interest. Organizations like the Partnership for Public Service, Volcker Alliance, and Brookings Government Studies consistently advocate for evidence-based reforms regardless of which party is in power. Centrists are willing to acknowledge both legitimate conservative concerns about efficiency and liberal concerns about protecting expertise. The emphasis on bipartisan solutions and incremental progress is sincere rather than strategic.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- **Cross-administration consistency:** Centrist good government groups advocated same reforms under Obama, Trump, and Biden.
- **Bipartisan approach:** Partnership for Public Service works with both parties on workforce issues.
- **Evidence focus:** Volcker Alliance and similar groups base recommendations on empirical research.
- **Acknowledgment of tradeoffs:** Centrist analysis recognizes valid concerns on multiple sides.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |

| Federal Regulatory Integrity Act | 8/10 | "Comprehensive anti-capture approach valuable" | Strong support |
| Federal Workforce Modernization Act | 9/10 | "Exactly what's needed for workforce improvement" | Very strong support |

#### Alternative Proposals

Centrists would add:

1. **Performance Metrics:** Better measurement of agency and employee performance with public reporting.

2. **Pilot Programs:** Test reforms before broad implementation.

3. **Evidence-Based Standards:** Require evidence basis for administrative reforms.

4. **Bipartisan Commissions:** Independent bodies to recommend structural reforms.

5. **Regular Review:** Periodic assessment of administrative effectiveness.

#### Coalition Potential

### Religious Right Perspective

#### Faith Level Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Faith**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Some divergence: religious liberty arguments are genuine but administrative reform views often serve broader conservative agenda rather than distinctly religious concerns |
| Principle consistency | Inconsistent: supports agency independence when it protects religious institutions but opposes it for agencies that conflict with traditional values |
| Goalpost stability | Moderate: positions shift based on which agencies are involved |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate: opposes agencies seen as hostile to traditional values, regardless of their structure |

**Justification:** Religious Right engagement on administrative reform is primarily driven by concerns about specific agencies rather than principled views on administrative structure. Support for or opposition to agency independence depends largely on whether the agency in question is seen as friendly or hostile to traditional religious values. HHS conscience protections are defended; EPA climate regulations are opposed. The framing often involves religious liberty, but underlying positions align closely with broader conservative movement on administrative issues.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- **Selective engagement:** Religious Right organizations focus on agencies touching religious issues (HHS, Education, EEOC) rather than administrative reform broadly.
- **Alliance with conservative movement:** Family Research Council, Heritage Foundation overlap significantly on administrative positions.
- **Religious liberty focus:** Genuine concern about agency actions affecting religious organizations and conscience rights.
- **Instrumental approach:** Administrative reform positions serve protecting religious interests rather than reflecting independent theory.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Agrees with some points about bureaucratic overreach; primarily concerned about agencies that affect religious liberty and traditional values |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | Sees root cause as secular/progressive capture of agencies rather than structural factors identified in analysis |

**Source references:**

- Family Research Council policy positions.
- Alliance Defending Freedom legal priorities.

| Federal Regulatory Integrity Act | 5/10 | "Some good provisions; but public advocate could empower anti-religious groups" | Mixed views |
| Federal Workforce Modernization Act | 4/10 | "Expanding hostile bureaucracy" | Opposes investment in agencies seen as hostile |

#### Alternative Proposals

Religious Right would emphasize:

1. **Religious Liberty Protections:** Codify conscience protections across agencies.

2. **Faith-Based Office:** Strengthen Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives.

3. **Regulatory Review:** Review all regulations for religious liberty impact.

4. **Hostile Agency Reform:** Restructure agencies seen as hostile to religious values.

5. **Judicial Remedies:** Expand religious liberty litigation opportunities.

#### Coalition Potential

### Democratic Socialist Perspective

#### Faith Level Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Good Faith**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Well aligned: support for strong public sector reflects genuine commitment to democratic control over economy and quality public services |
| Principle consistency | Highly consistent: support for worker rights, anti-capture, and strong public services applies across contexts; critical of Democratic establishment as well as Republicans |
| Goalpost stability | Stable: same core commitments to worker power and public goods over time |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low: willing to make common cause on specific issues; critique is substantive not merely oppositional |

**Justification:** Democratic socialist positions on administrative reform stem from genuine commitment to democratic control over economic and social policy, implemented through a professional, well-compensated public workforce. Unlike some liberal positions that may prioritize institutional preservation, democratic socialists focus on using administrative capacity to deliver public goods and constrain corporate power. Support for federal workers reflects broader commitment to worker rights and organized labor. Some reduction from full good faith for occasional strategic alliances with anti-government forces against specific captured agencies.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- **Labor solidarity:** Consistent support for federal employee unions as part of broader labor movement.
- **Anti-capture focus:** DSA and allied organizations consistently critique regulatory capture by corporate interests.
- **Public investment:** Emphasis on quality public services delivered by well-compensated workers.
- **Critical of establishment:** Democratic socialists critique Democratic administrations that appoint industry-friendly regulators.

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strongly agrees with analysis; would emphasize corporate capture and underfunding even more |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | Agrees with root cause analysis; would add emphasis on neoliberal policy consensus that weakened public sector |

| Federal Regulatory Integrity Act | 10/10 | "Anti-capture provisions address core problem of corporate domination" | Highest priority alongside civil service protection |
| Federal Workforce Modernization Act | 10/10 | "Exactly the kind of public investment needed" | Would increase funding levels significantly |

#### Alternative Proposals

Democratic socialists would add:

1. **Public Option for Services:** Expand government service delivery rather than contracting out.

2. **Sectoral Bargaining:** Enable federal workers to bargain across agencies.

3. **Corporate Accountability:** Stronger mechanisms to hold corporations accountable through regulation.

4. **Public Banking:** Federal Reserve and financial regulation reform to serve public interest.

5. **Wealth Tax Funding:** Fund workforce investment through taxes on extreme wealth.

6. **Democratic Oversight:** Citizen oversight boards for major agencies.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive (on anti-capture, worker rights), Liberal (on workforce investment)
- **Potential bridges:** Left Populist (on anti-elite, worker protection), some Libertarian (on civil liberties)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative, Constitutionalist, Religious Right (fundamental disagreement on role of government)

## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: Bipartisan Workforce Efficiency Package

**Bridges:** Conservative + Liberal + Centrist + Populist + Libertarian

**Core Agreement:** All perspectives agree federal hiring is too slow, technology is outdated, and some efficiency improvements are needed.

**Policy Description:**

- 60-day hiring timeline mandate with OPM modernization
- Technology modernization fund ($500M over 5 years)
- Performance management streamlining (clearer standards, faster processes)
- Direct hire authority expansion for critical skills
- No changes to civil service protections (conservative compromise)
- Maintain union consultation rights (liberal compromise)

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | Gets efficiency improvements and faster management tools |
| Liberal | Preserves civil service protections and worker rights |
| Centrist | Achieves evidence-based workforce improvements |
| Populist | Makes government more responsive without expanding it |
| Libertarian | Efficiency gains without new protective structures |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | No Schedule F; no expansion of at-will employment |
| Liberal | Accepts some streamlined performance management |
| Progressive | Accepts incremental rather than transformative change |
| Libertarian | Accepts federal investment rather than privatization |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 5-6/9 perspectives
- **Good Faith Ratio:** 4/5 coalition members rated 4+ faith
- **Durability:** High - addresses real problems without touching ideological flash points
- **Implementation Path:** Standalone legislation or appropriations rider

---

### Compromise 2: Revolving Door and Transparency Reform

**Bridges:** Progressive + Populist + Centrist + Liberal + some Conservative support

**Core Agreement:** Regulatory capture undermines public trust; revolving door and transparency reforms address this across ideological lines.

**Policy Description:**

- 4-year cooling-off periods for senior regulators (extended from current 2 years)
- Mandatory disclosure of all substantive meetings with regulated industries
- Enhanced recusal requirements during employment negotiations
- GAO capture audits of major regulatory agencies
- No public advocate office (conservative compromise)
- No intervenor funding (conservative compromise)

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Progressive | Addresses core anti-capture priority |
| Populist | Reduces elite insider access to government |
| Centrist | Evidence-based anti-corruption measures |
| Liberal | Strengthens regulatory integrity |
| Conservative | Limits revolving door without expanding bureaucracy |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Progressive | No public advocate office; no intervenor funding |
| Liberal | Accepts narrower package than preferred |
| Conservative | Accepts revolving door restrictions |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 5-7/9 perspectives
- **Good Faith Ratio:** 4/5 coalition members rated 4+ faith
- **Durability:** Moderate-high - broad agreement on capture problem
- **Implementation Path:** Standalone ethics legislation

### Compromise 3: Confirmation Process Reform

**Bridges:** Conservative + Liberal + Centrist + Libertarian

**Core Agreement:** Confirmation delays harm government effectiveness regardless of which party holds power.

**Policy Description:**

- Reduce Senate-confirmed positions by ~30% (convert to career or PA)
- 90-day committee action deadline with discharge procedures
- Limit on anonymous holds
- Strict Vacancies Act enforcement (no indefinite acting officials)
- Maintained Senate advice and consent for top positions
- Bipartisan commission to recommend which positions to convert

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | Faster confirmation when in power; ends perpetual vacancies |
| Liberal | Ends obstruction; more career professionals in key roles |
| Centrist | Improves government continuity and effectiveness |
| Libertarian | Fewer political positions to fill |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Fewer opportunities for political appointments |
| Liberal | Some positions removed from Senate confirmation |
| Both parties | Give up obstruction tactics when out of power |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 4-5/9 perspectives
- **Good Faith Ratio:** 4/4 coalition members rated 4+ faith
- **Durability:** Moderate - requires both parties to accept symmetric constraints
- **Implementation Path:** Senate rules change + statutory reform

### Compromise 4: Scientific Integrity Protection

**Bridges:** Liberal + Progressive + Centrist + some Libertarian support on transparency

**Core Agreement:** Scientific findings should be based on evidence, not political pressure.

**Policy Description:**

- Codify scientific integrity policies across agencies
- Protect agency scientists from political retaliation
- Require publication of scientific findings without political editing
- External scientific advisory committees with balanced expertise
- No creation of new bureaucratic structures (conservative-compatible)
- Focus on transparency rather than new regulation (libertarian-compatible)

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Liberal | Protects expert-driven policy development |
| Progressive | Prevents corporate/political interference with science |
| Centrist | Evidence-based decision-making |
| Libertarian | Transparency about how decisions are made |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Progressive | Accepts narrower protections than preferred |
| Conservative | Accepts some constraints on political editing |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 4-5/9 perspectives
- **Good Faith Ratio:** 4/4 coalition members rated 4+ faith
- **Durability:** Moderate - scientific integrity has bipartisan history
- **Implementation Path:** Executive order or standalone legislation

## Strategic Implications

### Most Viable Coalition

**Primary coalition:** Liberal + Progressive + Centrist + Democratic Socialist (+ selective Populist support)

This coalition has:

- 4 perspectives with faith ratings of 4+ (good faith engagement)
- Strong agreement on core reforms (civil service protection, anti-capture, workforce investment)
- Combined political weight (Democratic base + good government independents)
- Coherent narrative: protecting professional government from political attacks

**Secondary coalition (issue-specific):** Add Conservative and Libertarian on efficiency reforms

- Hiring reform, technology modernization have 7+ support across nearly all perspectives
- Anti-capture has surprising breadth (though different targets)
- Can build bipartisan legislative coalitions on specific measures

### Key Obstacles

1. **Schedule F / Civil Service Protection:** Fundamental disagreement between Conservative/Constitutionalist position (wants political control) and Liberal/Progressive/Centrist position (wants merit protection). No compromise position available.

2. **Agency Independence:** Constitutional theory divides Conservatives and Constitutionalists from others. Court decisions may force resolution regardless of legislative preferences.

3. **Workforce Investment:** Philosophical disagreement about government size creates divide on compensation and retention reforms.

4. **Left-Right Populist Split:** Populists share anti-elite sentiment but have opposite views on whether solution is political control (right) or stronger worker protections (left).

### Handling Bad Faith Actors

**Conservative (3/5 faith):** Engage on genuine concerns (hiring efficiency, technology, some performance management) while recognizing opposition to civil service protection is partly strategic. Build bipartisan record on efficiency reforms to isolate bad-faith Schedule F push.

**Populist (3/5 faith):** Distinguish between left and right populist concerns. Left populists can be coalition partners on anti-capture and worker protection. Right populists may be unreachable on civil service issues but can be engaged on transparency.

**Religious Right (3/5 faith):** Engage on religious liberty concerns where genuine; recognize administrative reform positions are largely derivative of broader conservative alliance. Not a primary target for coalition-building.

**Constitutionalist (3/5 faith):** Engage genuine constitutional scholars on structural design questions; recognize that constitutional arguments are sometimes deployed strategically. Build record defending reforms against constitutional challenge.

### Recommended Approach for Reform Advocates

1. **Lead with efficiency reforms:** Hiring reform and technology modernization have broadest support and can build bipartisan credibility.

2. **Build anti-capture coalition:** Frame revolving door and transparency reforms as anti-corruption measures with cross-ideological appeal.

3. **Protect civil service through legislation:** Given Schedule F threat, statutory protection is essential even if some conservatives oppose.

4. **Sequence strategically:** Pass efficiency and anti-capture reforms first to build momentum; civil service protection may require partisan majority.

5. **Prepare for court challenges:** Design agency independence provisions to survive judicial review; have fallback positions ready.

6. **Invest in workforce narrative:** Counter "bloated bureaucracy" frame with "professional public service" emphasis on expertise and mission.
