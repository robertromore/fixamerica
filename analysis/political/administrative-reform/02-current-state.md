## Civil Service System

### Merit System Principles

Codified in 5 U.S.C. § 2301:

1. Recruit from qualified individuals
2. Fair and equitable treatment
3. Equal pay for equal work
4. High standards of integrity
5. Efficient and effective use
6. Retain based on performance
7. Education and training
8. Protection from political coercion
9. Protection for whistleblowers

### Competitive Service

**Coverage**: Most federal positions

**Requirements**:

- Competitive examination
- Merit-based selection
- Veteran preference
- Probationary period

**Protections**:

- Removal only for cause
- Due process rights
- Appeal to MSPB
- Union representation

### Excepted Service

**Categories**:

- Schedule A: Attorney, chaplain, certain professionals
- Schedule B: Specific agencies/positions
- Schedule C: Policy-determining positions (political appointees)
- Various statutory exceptions

**Schedule F Proposal** (Trump administration, rescinded by Biden):

- Would have reclassified policy-related positions
- Removed civil service protections
- Allowed at-will termination
- Could affect tens of thousands of positions

### Senior Executive Service (SES)

**Purpose**: Senior career leadership

**Size**: ~7,000 positions

**Characteristics**:

- Performance-based
- Mobile across agencies
- Higher accountability
- Some political appointees

## Political Appointments

### Categories (2024 snapshot)

| Type | Number | Characteristics |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| PAS (Senate confirmed) | ~1,200 | Cabinet, agency heads, ambassadors |
| PA (President appointed) | ~500 | Non-Senate confirmed |
| Schedule C | ~1,500 | Confidential/policy-determining |
| Non-career SES | ~700 | Senior political positions |

### Confirmation Process

**Current Problems**:

- Extreme delays (average 6+ months)
- Many positions left vacant
- Acting officials serve indefinitely
- Politicization of confirmation

**Vacancies**:

- Administration begins with most positions empty
- Slow Senate confirmation
- Some positions never filled
- Acting officials lack authority

## Agency Independence

### Independent Agencies

**Structural Features**:

- Multi-member commissions
- Staggered, fixed terms
- For-cause removal protection
- Bipartisan composition requirements

**Examples**:

| Agency | Structure |
|--------|-----------|
| Federal Reserve | 7 governors, 14-year terms |
| FTC | 5 commissioners, 7-year terms |
| SEC | 5 commissioners, 5-year terms |
| FCC | 5 commissioners, 5-year terms |
| NLRB | 5 members, 5-year terms |

### Threats to Independence

**Removal Challenges**:

- *Seila Law v. CFPB* (2020): Single-director structure with for-cause removal unconstitutional
- *Collins v. Yellen* (2021): FHFA structure unconstitutional
- Ongoing litigation over agency structures

**Political Pressure**:

- Social media attacks on agencies
- Budget threats
- Personnel manipulation
- Regulatory capture

## Regulatory Capture

### Definition

When regulatory agencies serve the interests of the industries they regulate rather than the public interest.

### Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Revolving door | Industry officials become regulators and vice versa |
| Information asymmetry | Industry has superior technical knowledge |
| Resource disparity | Industry outspends public interest advocates |
| Access | Industry has more access to regulators |
| Campaign contributions | Industry influences appointing officials |

### Examples of Concern

- Financial regulation pre-2008 crisis
- Environmental enforcement variations
- Pharmaceutical regulation
- Transportation safety
- Energy regulation

## Administrative Procedure

### Administrative Procedure Act (APA)

**Enacted**: 1946

**Key Provisions**:

- Notice-and-comment rulemaking
- Formal adjudication procedures
- Judicial review standards
- Publication requirements

### Rulemaking Process

| Step | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| Notice | Proposed rule published in Federal Register |
| Comment | Public comment period (typically 30-60 days) |
| Consideration | Agency must consider and respond to comments |
| Final Rule | Published with effective date |
| Judicial Review | Available in federal courts |

### Challenges

- Process takes years
- Litigation delays implementation
- Cost-benefit analysis requirements
- Congressional Review Act reversals
- Midnight regulations concerns

## Workforce Challenges

### Recruitment

**Obstacles**:

- Non-competitive salaries for many positions
- Lengthy hiring process (average 100+ days)
- Security clearance delays
- Competition with private sector
- Geographic constraints (DC concentration)

### Retention

**Issues**:

- Pay compression at senior levels

- Bureaucratic frustration
- Political environment
- Better private sector options

### Morale

**Indicators**:
