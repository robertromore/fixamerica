# Administrative Reform: Roadmap

## Strategic Considerations

### Political Window

Administrative reform opportunities are limited:

- Anti-capture progressives + limited government conservatives

### Structural Durability

Reforms must survive political transitions:

- Statutory over executive order

- Institutional buy-in
- Public education
