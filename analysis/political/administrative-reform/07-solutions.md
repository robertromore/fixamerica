# Administrative Reform: Solutions

## Framework for Reform

Effective administrative reform should:

1. **Protect merit principles** from political manipulation
2. **Preserve appropriate independence** for regulatory agencies
3. **Combat regulatory capture** through structural reforms
4. **Strengthen the federal workforce** through investment and modernization
5. **Improve management** while maintaining accountability
6. **Balance responsiveness with expertise**

## Civil Service Protection

### Problem

Schedule F and similar proposals threaten to convert career positions to at-will employment, enabling political purges.

### Solution: Statutory Protection

Codify civil service protections in statute beyond executive order:

**Legislative Approach**:

- Prohibit reclassification that strips protections
- Require congressional approval for new excepted schedules
- Strengthen MSPB enforcement
- Enhance whistleblower protections for classification challenges

**Structural Protections**:

| Protection | Mechanism |
|------------|-----------|
| Definition lock | Statutory definition of competitive service |
| Conversion limits | Prohibit mass conversions to excepted |
| Due process | Guaranteed rights before adverse action |
| Appeal rights | MSPB jurisdiction preserved |

### Solution: Enhanced Due Process

Strengthen protections for career employees:

- Clearer standards for adverse actions
- Faster adjudication timelines
- Stronger remedies for violations
- Protection for position classifications

## Agency Independence

### Problem

Court decisions are narrowing agency independence, and political pressure threatens expert decision-making.

### Solution: Redesign for Survival

Structure agencies to survive judicial review while maintaining appropriate independence:

**Multi-Member Structures**:

- Commissions with staggered terms
- Bipartisan composition requirements
- Rotation requirements

**For-Cause Protection** (where constitutional):

- Clear cause standards
- Congressional notification
- Judicial review

**Alternative Mechanisms**:

| Mechanism | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Publication requirements | Force transparency in removal decisions |
| Congressional notification | Political cost to removal |
| Expertise requirements | Commissioners must have qualifications |
| Staggered terms | Prevent full replacement |

### Solution: Protect Expertise

Insulate technical decisions from political interference:

- Chief scientist/economist positions with protections
- Scientific integrity policies
- Publication without political editing
- External review mechanisms

## Anti-Capture Reforms

### Problem

Regulatory agencies often serve regulated industries rather than public interest.

### Solution: Structural Anti-Capture

**Revolving Door Restrictions**:

- Longer cooling-off periods
- Broader definition of restricted activities
- Pre-employment recusals
- Disclosure requirements

See [Ethics and Accountability](../ethics-accountability/01-overview.md) for detailed revolving door reforms.

**Balanced Participation**:

| Reform | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Public advocate | Represent public in proceedings |
| Intervenor funding | Support public interest participation |
| Advisory committee balance | Balanced industry/public membership |
| Meeting transparency | Document all substantive contacts |

**Information Balance**:

- Independent research capacity
- Public access to industry data
- External expert consultation
- Academic partnerships

### Solution: Accountability Mechanisms

- Regular capture audits
- Public reporting on industry influence
- GAO review of regulatory outcomes
- Congressional oversight focused on capture

| Non-career SES | ~700 | ~400 |

**Criteria for Reduction**:

- Positions requiring continuity
- Technical expertise positions
- Positions below top leadership

## Regulatory Process Reform

### Problem

Rulemaking is slow, litigation-heavy, and uncertain.

### Solution: Streamlined Process

**Faster Rulemaking**:

- Time limits for comment periods
