# Political Reform: Current State

## The Problem Today

### Electoral System Failures

**Winner-Take-All Voting**
The United States uses plurality voting ("first past the post") for nearly all elections. This system:

- Forces voters to choose between "the lesser of two evils"
- Punishes third-party voters with "spoiler effects"
- Allows candidates to win without majority support
- Creates safe seats where general elections are meaningless

**Gerrymandering**
Politicians choose their voters instead of voters choosing their politicians:

- In 2022, only about 10% of House races were truly competitive
- Partisan map-drawing creates districts where outcomes are predetermined
- Representatives in safe districts answer to their party base, not the general electorate
- Extreme candidates thrive; moderates and compromisers are punished

**Primary System Dysfunction**
Low-turnout partisan primaries determine most election outcomes:

- Primary voters are more ideologically extreme than general electorate
- Incumbents fear primary challenges more than general elections
- This incentivizes partisan loyalty over effective governance
- Closed primaries exclude independents (40%+ of voters in many states)

### Money in Politics

**Post-Citizens United Landscape**
Since the 2010 Supreme Court decision:

- Unlimited corporate and dark money floods elections
- Super PACs spend billions with minimal disclosure
- Wealthy donors have exponentially more influence than average citizens
- Candidates spend 30-70% of their time fundraising instead of governing

**The Donor Class**

- In 2020, just 0.5% of Americans provided 70%+ of campaign contributions
- Donors' policy preferences consistently win out over public preferences
- Access to elected officials is essentially for sale
- Lobbying spending exceeds $4 billion annually

### Congressional Dysfunction

**Legislative Paralysis**

- Congress passes fewer substantive laws than at almost any point in modern history
- Major issues (immigration, climate, healthcare, debt) go unaddressed for decades
- Government shutdowns and debt ceiling crises have become routine
- Confirmation processes have become partisan warfare

**Broken Norms**

- The filibuster effectively requires 60 votes to pass most legislation
- Judicial nominations have become purely partisan exercises
- Committee processes and regular order have been abandoned
- Bipartisan cooperation is punished by party bases

### Party Duopoly

**Barriers to Competition**

- Ballot access laws make it extremely difficult for third parties and independents
- Debate commission controlled by the two major parties
- Media coverage focuses almost exclusively on D vs R framing
- First-past-the-post voting mathematically guarantees two-party dominance

**Party Capture**

- Both parties are increasingly controlled by their activist bases and donors
- Party leadership prioritizes maintaining power over solving problems
- Primary systems reward ideological purity over effectiveness
- The parties have become brands that voters feel trapped by

## Impact

### On Citizens

- **Frustration and alienation**: Majorities of Americans feel the system doesn't represent them
- **Forced false choices**: Voters must choose between two options that don't reflect their views
- **Civic withdrawal**: Many people disengage entirely from a system they see as rigged
- **Family and community division**: Political polarization strains personal relationships

### On Governance

- **Policy stagnation**: Problems compound while Congress fails to act
- **Short-term thinking**: Elections cycles prevent long-term planning
- **Crisis governance**: Action only happens at the last minute under threat
- **Regulatory capture**: Agencies meant to protect public interest serve industry instead

### On Society

- **Declining social trust**: Political division bleeds into social division
- **Institutional erosion**: Faith in courts, elections, media, science all declining
- **Economic distortions**: Policies favor donors over efficient markets
- **Democratic fragility**: Norms that sustain democracy are weakening

## Recent Developments

### Positive Signs

- **Ranked-choice voting expansion**: Now used statewide in Alaska and Maine; adopted in 50+ cities
- **Independent redistricting**: 10 states now use independent or bipartisan commissions
- **Open primaries**: Several states moving toward nonpartisan or open primary systems
- **Transparency improvements**: Some states strengthening disclosure requirements
- **Grassroots energy**: Organizations like RepresentUs, FairVote, and others gaining momentum

### Concerning Trends

- **Election denialism**: Substantial portion of electorate questions election legitimacy
- **State-level restrictions**: Some states making voting more difficult
- **Continued dark money**: Disclosure requirements remain weak at federal level
- **Supreme Court rulings**: Recent decisions have limited campaign finance regulation
- **Norm erosion continues**: Bipartisan cooperation remains politically dangerous

### Current Battlegrounds

- **For the People Act / Freedom to Vote Act**: Federal voting rights legislation stalled
- **State ballot initiatives**: Voters directly implementing reforms where legislatures won't
- **Lawsuit challenges**: Legal battles over redistricting maps, voting rules, campaign finance
- **2024 and beyond**: High-stakes elections testing democratic resilience
