# Political Reform: Overview

American democracy is experiencing a systemic crisis. The political system designed to represent citizens and solve collective problems has become captured by wealthy donors, entrenched party interests, and institutional inertia. The result is a government that is increasingly unresponsive to the will of the majority, incapable of addressing long-term challenges, and actively exacerbating polarization and distrust.
