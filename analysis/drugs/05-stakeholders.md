# Drug Policy: Stakeholders

## Overview

Drug policy affects virtually every American community, institution, and sector of society. This chapter maps the key stakeholders -- those harmed by current policy, those who benefit from it, those with power to change it, and those who advocate for reform. Understanding stakeholder interests, incentives, and relationships is essential to building effective reform coalitions.

## People Directly Affected

### People with Substance Use Disorders

- **Scale**: 48.7 million Americans aged 12 or older (17.3% of the population) have a substance use disorder, including 29.5 million with alcohol use disorder and 27.2 million with illicit drug use disorders. (SAMHSA NSDUH, 2023)
- **Demographics**: SUD cuts across all demographics but is concentrated among people aged 18-44, men (twice the rate of women), and populations facing poverty, trauma, and mental illness. An estimated 21.5 million people have co-occurring SUD and mental illness.
- **Key interests**: Access to affordable, evidence-based treatment without stigma or criminal consequences. Removal of barriers to employment, housing, and benefits created by drug convictions. Access to harm reduction services that prevent death and disease.
- **Political power**: Low. Stigma, disorganization, and the disproportionate impact on marginalized communities limit political influence. People in active addiction face barriers to civic participation, and people in recovery often conceal their history due to stigma.

### Families and Communities

- **Scale**: An estimated 5.4 million children (7.5% of all children) live with a parent who has a substance use disorder. Millions more family members are affected as caregivers, partners, and loved ones.
- **Impact**: Family members bear emotional, financial, and caregiving burdens. Children of parents with SUD face elevated risks of abuse, neglect, poverty, and developing SUD themselves. Communities with high rates of addiction experience reduced economic productivity, strained social services, and eroded social cohesion.
- **Key interests**: Effective treatment that helps family members recover. Support services for affected families. Prevention programs that protect children. Policies that keep families together rather than separating them through incarceration.

### People Incarcerated for Drug Offenses

- **Scale**: Approximately 209,000 people are currently incarcerated in federal and state prisons for drug offenses -- 66,000 in federal prison (45% of the Bureau of Prisons population) and 143,000 in state prisons. Hundreds of thousands more are held in local jails, on probation, or on parole for drug offenses.
- **Demographics**: Disproportionately Black (Black Americans are 5.9 times more likely to be incarcerated for drug offenses than white Americans) and disproportionately poor.
- **Key interests**: Sentencing reform, retroactive application of reduced sentences, reentry support, expungement of records, and restoration of rights (voting, housing, employment, public benefits).

### Overdose Survivors and Bereaved Families

- **Scale**: For every fatal overdose, an estimated 6-8 non-fatal overdoses occur, meaning approximately 640,000-850,000 non-fatal overdoses occur annually. Millions of families have lost loved ones to overdose.
- **Key interests**: Expanded access to naloxone and harm reduction services. Treatment on demand. Pharmaceutical industry accountability. Prevention of future deaths.
- **Political power**: Growing. Organizations like the Partnership to End Addiction and individual advocates (parents of overdose victims) have become increasingly influential, particularly in suburban and rural communities.

## Communities Disproportionately Affected

### Black and Latino Communities

- **Impact**: Bear the heaviest burden of drug enforcement despite comparable drug use rates. Black Americans are arrested for cannabis possession at 3.6 times the rate and incarcerated for drug offenses at 5.9 times the rate of white Americans. Drug convictions create cascading consequences (employment, housing, voting, benefits) that compound across generations.
- **Key interests**: End of racially disparate enforcement. Expungement of prior convictions. Equity provisions in cannabis legalization. Investment in communities damaged by the drug war.
- **Political power**: Moderate and growing. Civil rights organizations (NAACP, ACLU, Color of Change) have made drug policy reform a priority. Racial justice arguments for reform are increasingly mainstream.

### American Indian and Alaska Native Communities

- **Impact**: Highest overdose death rate of any racial/ethnic group (56.6 per 100,000 in 2022). Jurisdictional complexity between tribal, state, and federal law complicates enforcement and treatment delivery. Underfunded Indian Health Service (IHS) limits treatment access.
- **Key interests**: Increased IHS funding for SUD treatment. Culturally appropriate treatment models. Sovereignty in drug policy decisions. Harm reduction access on tribal lands.
- **Political power**: Limited. Small population size, geographic remoteness, and historical marginalization reduce political influence, though tribal sovereignty provides some policy autonomy.

### Rural Communities

- **Impact**: Disproportionately affected by the opioid crisis and methamphetamine use. Limited access to treatment -- 60% of rural counties lack addiction specialists. Higher per-capita overdose death rates in many rural areas. Economic devastation from the decline of manufacturing and extractive industries has fueled "deaths of despair."
- **Key interests**: Rural treatment access. Telehealth expansion. Prevention programs tailored to rural contexts. Economic development that addresses the social determinants of addiction.
- **Political power**: Significant in national elections due to geographic distribution and the Electoral College. Rural voters' experience with the opioid crisis has shifted some conservative politicians toward supporting treatment-based approaches.

## Government Agencies

### Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)

- **Role**: Federal drug enforcement, scheduling decisions, regulation of controlled substance manufacture and distribution.
- **Budget**: ~$3.5 billion (FY2024); ~10,000 employees.
- **Institutional interests**: Maintaining the current scheduling system and enforcement-based approach. The DEA's budget, personnel, and authority depend on the drug prohibition framework. The agency has historically resisted cannabis rescheduling and harm reduction expansion.
- **Reform position**: Generally opposes significant reform. Has resisted scheduling changes, expanded harm reduction, and decriminalization. The DEA's monopoly over scheduling decisions is a key structural barrier to evidence-based policy.

### Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP)

- **Role**: Coordinates federal drug control policy, sets the National Drug Control Strategy, and certifies agency drug control budgets.
- **Budget**: ~$400 million; ~55 employees.
- **Institutional interests**: Maintaining its coordination role and relevance. Under the Biden administration, ONDCP adopted a more health-oriented rhetoric, endorsing harm reduction and treatment-focused language. However, ONDCP remains constrained by its statutory mandate and the broader enforcement-dominant framework.
- **Reform position**: Varies by administration. Has historically oscillated between enforcement-heavy and health-oriented approaches depending on the political appointee leading it.

### Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)

- **Role**: Primary federal agency for substance use and mental health services. Administers treatment and prevention grants, collects data (NSDUH), and sets treatment standards.
- **Budget**: ~$8.2 billion; ~550 employees.
- **Institutional interests**: Expanding treatment and prevention funding. SAMHSA is the primary advocate within the federal government for a public health approach to drug policy.
- **Reform position**: Generally supportive of treatment expansion, harm reduction, and reducing criminal justice involvement in drug policy.

### National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)

- **Role**: The primary federal funder of drug-related research. Part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
- **Budget**: ~$1.7 billion; ~370 employees.
- **Institutional interests**: Expanding research funding and reducing barriers to studying Schedule I substances. NIDA-funded research has produced much of the scientific evidence supporting treatment and harm reduction approaches.
- **Reform position**: Supports evidence-based scheduling, expanded research access, and treatment-focused policy. NIDA Director Nora Volkow has been a prominent advocate for the brain disease model of addiction and expanded treatment access.

### Food and Drug Administration (FDA)

- **Role**: Regulates pharmaceutical drugs, approves new medications (including addiction treatments), and oversees drug labeling and marketing.
- **Institutional interests**: Maintaining regulatory authority over drug approval. The FDA's role in the opioid crisis (inadequate oversight of OxyContin marketing) has subjected it to criticism and reform pressure.
- **Reform position**: Mixed. Has approved new addiction treatments (buprenorphine, naloxone) but has been slow to reform pharmaceutical marketing oversight and has faced criticism for its handling of psychedelic medicine applications.

## Law Enforcement

### Federal Law Enforcement

- **DEA**: See above.
- **FBI**: Involved in drug trafficking investigations, particularly those involving organized crime, gangs, and corruption.
- **CBP/ICE (Customs and Border Protection / Immigration and Customs Enforcement)**: Primary agencies for border drug interdiction. CBP seizes billions of dollars in drugs annually at ports of entry and between them.
- **U.S. Marshals Service**: Executes drug-related arrest warrants and manages seized assets.

### State and Local Law Enforcement

- **Scale**: Approximately 18,000 state and local law enforcement agencies, employing approximately 700,000 sworn officers.
- **Drug enforcement role**: Drug enforcement is a major activity for state and local police, accounting for a significant share of arrests, investigations, and court time.
- **Institutional interests**: Maintaining drug enforcement funding (Byrne JAG grants, HIDTA grants), asset forfeiture revenues, and overtime budgets. Drug enforcement is also a pathway to career advancement in many departments.
- **Reform position**: Varies widely. Some chiefs and sheriffs support treatment-based approaches (the Police Assisted Addiction and Recovery Initiative, or PAARI, connects arrested individuals to treatment). Others strongly oppose reform. Major law enforcement organizations (FOP, IACP, National Sheriffs' Association) have generally opposed cannabis legalization and decriminalization.

### Prosecutors

- **Role**: Federal and state prosecutors exercise enormous discretion in drug cases -- deciding what charges to file, whether to seek mandatory minimums, and what plea bargains to offer.
- **Institutional interests**: Maintaining prosecutorial discretion, case volume, and conviction rates.
- **Reform position**: Mixed. The progressive prosecutor movement (elected DAs in Philadelphia, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Manhattan, and other cities) has deprioritized drug prosecution and implemented diversion programs. Traditional prosecutors' organizations (NDAA) have been more cautious.

## The Pharmaceutical Industry

### Opioid Manufacturers

- **Key actors**: Purdue Pharma (now bankrupt), Johnson & Johnson (Janssen), Teva Pharmaceutical, Endo International, Mallinckrodt, and Allergan.
- **Role in crisis**: Manufactured and aggressively marketed opioid painkillers while downplaying addiction risks.
- **Current status**: Facing or settling multi-billion-dollar lawsuits. Purdue Pharma dissolved through bankruptcy. Sackler family agreed to $6 billion settlement.
- **Interests**: Limiting liability, managing settlements, maintaining ongoing pharmaceutical operations.

### Drug Distributors

- **Key actors**: McKesson, Cardinal Health, AmerisourceBergen (now Cencora) -- the "Big Three" distribute approximately 90% of pharmaceuticals in the U.S.
- **Role in crisis**: Failed to flag or halt suspicious orders of opioids to pharmacies. Shipped billions of pills to small communities where the volumes were far in excess of legitimate medical need.
- **Current status**: $21 billion combined settlement.

### Addiction Treatment Pharmaceutical Companies

- **Key actors**: Indivior (Suboxone/buprenorphine), Emergent BioSolutions (naloxone), Alkermes (Vivitrol/naltrexone), and generic manufacturers.
- **Interests**: Maintaining market share and patent protection for addiction treatment medications. Some companies (Indivior) have faced legal action for anticompetitive practices that delayed generic buprenorphine.

### Pharmaceutical Industry Associations

- **PhRMA** (Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America): The primary industry lobbying group. $374 million in lobbying spending in 2022. Generally opposes price controls, importation, and reforms that reduce pharmaceutical profits.

---

## Treatment and Recovery Community

### Treatment Providers

- **Scale**: Approximately 16,000 specialty SUD treatment facilities, plus hospitals, primary care practices, and community health centers that provide some SUD services.
- **Key interests**: Increased funding, workforce development, insurance parity enforcement, and reduced regulatory barriers (particularly for methadone).
- **Reform position**: Generally supportive of treatment expansion and public health approaches. The American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) advocates for evidence-based treatment standards and insurance parity.

### Recovery Community Organizations

- **Key actors**: Faces & Voices of Recovery, Association of Recovery Community Organizations, Young People in Recovery, and thousands of local recovery community organizations.
- **Role**: Provide peer support, advocacy, and community-based recovery services. The recovery advocacy movement has been instrumental in reducing stigma and increasing political support for treatment.
- **Key interests**: Treatment access, recovery support services, anti-stigma campaigns, and policies that support long-term recovery (housing, employment, education).

### 12-Step Organizations

- **Key actors**: Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), Narcotics Anonymous (NA), and related fellowships.
- **Role**: Provide free, peer-led support to millions of people in recovery. AA has approximately 2 million members worldwide.
- **Position on policy**: 12-step organizations maintain a tradition of non-involvement in public policy debates ("no opinion on outside issues"). However, the abstinence-based philosophy of 12-step programs has influenced treatment policy and sometimes created tension with medication-assisted treatment approaches.

## The Cannabis Industry

### Industry Actors

- **Multi-state operators (MSOs)**: Large cannabis companies operating in multiple legal states (e.g., Curaleaf, Trulieve, Green Thumb Industries). Employ thousands and generate billions in revenue.
- **Small businesses**: Independent dispensaries, cultivators, and manufacturers. Often disadvantaged by capital requirements and regulatory complexity.
- **Industry associations**: National Cannabis Industry Association (NCIA), Cannabis Trade Federation, U.S. Cannabis Council.
- **Interests**: Federal legalization (banking access, tax reform, interstate commerce), regulatory clarity, industry growth. The cannabis industry has become a significant lobbying force, spending over $20 million annually on federal lobbying.

### Social Equity Concerns

A key tension within the cannabis industry is the contrast between who profits and who was harmed by prohibition. The legal cannabis industry is predominantly white-owned, while Black and Latino communities bore the brunt of enforcement. Social equity programs (license set-asides, expungement, reinvestment) aim to address this gap but have had limited success in most states.
