# Drug Sentencing: Political Perspectives Analysis

## Overview

Drug sentencing policy raises fundamental questions about the purpose of punishment, the balance between public safety and individual liberty, the role of race in American justice, and whether government should treat drug use as a crime or a health condition. These questions cut across traditional political alignments: the First Step Act of 2018 demonstrated that sentencing reform can unite libertarians concerned about government overreach, fiscal conservatives troubled by incarceration costs, evangelical Christians motivated by redemption, and progressives demanding racial justice. Yet deep disagreements remain about mandatory minimums, the appropriate response to fentanyl, and whether reform has gone far enough -- or too far.

Different political traditions offer distinct visions for how to approach drug sentencing. This analysis examines the issue through nine distinct political perspectives, exploring how each tradition approaches the core questions and proposed solutions.

## Perspective Definitions

| Perspective | Core Values | Policy Orientation |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Tradition, limited government, individual responsibility | Incremental change, fiscal restraint, market solutions |
| Liberal | Progress, equality, social responsibility | Government as problem-solver, regulation, safety nets |
| Progressive | Systemic change, economic justice, structural reform | Transformative reform, wealth redistribution, worker power |
| Libertarian | Individual liberty, minimal state, free markets | Deregulation, privatization, voluntary association |
| Constitutionalist | Original intent, enumerated powers, federalism | Strict constitutional limits, states' rights |
| Populist | Anti-elite, pro-worker, economic nationalism | Trade protection, anti-monopoly, immigration restriction |
| Centrist | Pragmatism, compromise, incremental progress | Bipartisan solutions, evidence-based policy |
| Religious Right | Faith-based values, traditional morality | Social conservatism, religious liberty |
| Democratic Socialist | Worker ownership, public goods, democratic control | Public investment, labor rights, universal programs |

## Scoring Framework

### Position Scores (1-10)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10 | Full agreement with project analysis |
| 7-9 | Substantial to strong agreement |
| 5-6 | Mixed/moderate agreement |
| 3-4 | Substantial disagreement |
| 1-2 | Strong opposition |

### Engagement Consistency (1-5)

This metric assesses how reliably a perspective's stated positions align with its underlying principles, and how stable those positions are when concerns are addressed. Higher scores indicate more predictable negotiating partners.

| Level | Label | Indicators |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 5 | Highly Consistent | Stated positions reflect underlying principles; positions stable when concerns addressed |
| 4 | Mostly Consistent | Principles generally align with positions; minor strategic flexibility |
| 3 | Mixed Consistency | Some positions principled, others reflect coalition pressures or unstated concerns |
| 2 | Low Consistency | Positions shift frequently; stated concerns differ from underlying priorities |
| 1 | Unpredictable | Positions appear driven primarily by opposition dynamics rather than principles |

**Coalition-Building Considerations:**

- Alignment gap: When stated concerns differ from underlying priorities, addressing stated concerns may not secure support
- Position stability: Perspectives with shifting positions require ongoing negotiation
- Principle consistency: Perspectives that apply principles uniformly are more predictable partners
- Internal diversity: Some perspectives contain factions with different priorities

### Legislation Status Reference (as of January 2025)

| Bill/Amendment | Type | Current Status | Last Action |

## Perspective Analyses

### Conservative Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Stated concern is public safety and deterrence; actual motivations include maintaining tough-on-crime electoral positioning and responding to law enforcement constituency |
| Principle consistency | Limited government and fiscal responsibility principles logically support sentencing reform, but are often overridden by law-and-order positioning |
| Goalpost stability | Goals shifted significantly between 2014-2018 (supported First Step Act) and 2021-present (fentanyl rhetoric restored tough-on-crime framing) |
| Zero-sum behavior | Sometimes treats sentencing reform as a concession to opponents rather than as principled policy |

**Justification:** Conservatives have demonstrated genuine willingness to support sentencing reform (First Step Act vote), but the consistency of this position is undermined by electoral incentives that reward severity and the fentanyl crisis has provided a new justification for retreating from reform.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- 87-12 Senate vote for First Step Act (2018) included strong Republican support, demonstrating that reform is achievable
- Multiple Republican sponsors of EQUAL Act in the 117th Congress
- Post-2021 shift toward fentanyl severity rhetoric by many Republicans who supported the First Step Act, suggesting position instability

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Acknowledges mass incarceration costs but disputes racial framing; more concerned about fentanyl than crack-powder disparity |
| Root Cause Agreement | 3/10 | Rejects the analysis of mandatory minimums as structurally racist; attributes disparities to differential offending rates rather than systemic bias |

**Source references:**

- Heritage Foundation, "The Need for Maintaining Mandatory Minimum Sentences," 2016
- Right on Crime, "Statement of Principles on Sentencing" (supports reform)
- Republican Study Committee, policy positions on criminal justice (mixed)

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Eliminate mandatory minimums | 3/10 | "Mandatory minimums are essential tools for prosecutors and deter drug trafficking" | Loss of electoral "tough on crime" positioning; law enforcement constituency opposition |
| Eliminate crack-powder disparity | 6/10 | "The remaining disparity should be addressed, but by increasing powder penalties, not reducing crack penalties" | Some genuine concern about racial optics; desire to maintain severity |
| Retroactive resentencing | 3/10 | "Retroactive changes undermine rule of law and release dangerous individuals" | Fear of political backlash from any released individual who reoffends |
| Expand drug courts | 7/10 | "Drug courts are an effective, accountability-based alternative" | Aligns with personal responsibility framing; demonstrated results |
| Racial equity monitoring | 2/10 | "Creates a racial quota system in sentencing; judges should be colorblind" | Resistance to racial framing of criminal justice; concern about constraining prosecutorial discretion |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Drug Sentencing Reform and Equity Act | 3/10 | "Goes too far; eliminates essential tools without adequate replacement" | Comprehensive reform threatens too many institutional relationships |
| EQUAL Act | 5/10 | "Addresses a legitimate disparity but should be standalone, not bundled" | Moderate support for narrow reform; reluctance to accept broader package |

#### Alternative Proposals

Conservatives would more readily support incremental reforms: expanding the safety valve, increasing good-time credits, expanding drug court funding, and maintaining mandatory minimums for "kingpin" traffickers while reducing them for lower-level offenders. Some conservatives favor increasing powder cocaine penalties to match crack rather than reducing crack penalties to match powder.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Libertarians (individual liberty), Centrists (evidence-based reform), Religious Right (redemption narrative)
- **Potential bridges:** Populists (if framed as protecting working families from incarceration costs)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressives, Democratic Socialists (fundamental disagreement on racial framing and scope of reform)

---

### Liberal Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Stated concerns about racial equity and public health generally match underlying principles; some positions reflect advocacy organization influence |
| Principle consistency | Consistently supports reduced sentences, treatment alternatives, and racial equity measures across issue areas |
| Goalpost stability | Generally stable positions, though the scope of desired reform has expanded over time from incremental to comprehensive |
| Zero-sum behavior | Rarely treats sentencing reform as zero-sum; willing to accept partial reforms while advocating for more |

**Justification:** Liberals have been consistent advocates for sentencing reform, with positions that align with stated principles of racial equity, public health, and evidence-based policy. The main inconsistency is a tendency to support incremental reforms in practice while advocating for comprehensive reform in rhetoric.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Democratic presidential platforms have consistently included sentencing reform planks since 2008
- Liberal advocacy organizations (Brennan Center, ACLU) have maintained consistent positions
- Obama administration (Fair Sentencing Act, Smart on Crime) and Biden administration (pardons, scheduling review) demonstrated practical commitment

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strongly agrees with analysis of racial disparities, mass incarceration, and policy failure; may want more emphasis on pharmaceutical industry culpability |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | Agrees with structural analysis of racial bias, prosecutorial power, and political economy; may find the analysis insufficiently critical of systemic racism |

**Source references:**

- Center for American Progress, "Ending the War on Drugs: By the Numbers," 2018
- Brennan Center for Justice, "Ending Mass Incarceration" series
- Democratic Party platform on criminal justice reform (2020, 2024)

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Eliminate mandatory minimums | 8/10 | "Mandatory minimums are failed policy that must be eliminated" | Strong support; some concern about messaging on public safety |
| Eliminate crack-powder disparity | 10/10 | "The disparity is indefensible racial discrimination; eliminate it immediately with retroactive application" | No significant reservations |
| Retroactive resentencing | 9/10 | "Those sentenced under unjust laws deserve relief" | Concern about adequate reentry support for released individuals |
| Expand drug courts | 7/10 | "Drug courts are better than prison, but should not replace decriminalization" | Support tempered by concerns about coercive treatment and net-widening |
| Racial equity monitoring | 9/10 | "Essential for accountability; should be expanded to cover all criminal justice decision points" | Would prefer stronger enforcement mechanisms |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Drug Sentencing Reform and Equity Act | 8/10 | "Strong step forward; could go further on decriminalization and racial repair" | Would prefer inclusion of restorative justice and community investment provisions |
| EQUAL Act | 9/10 | "Long overdue; should have been enacted years ago" | Concerned about continued delay |

#### Alternative Proposals

Liberals would push for more comprehensive reform: full decriminalization of drug possession, community investment from incarceration savings, restorative justice programs, and automatic record expungement for all drug possession convictions.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressives, Democratic Socialists (shared equity goals)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrists (evidence-based framing), Conservatives (through bipartisan reform model)
- **Unlikely partners:** Populists (different priorities on immigration-drug nexus)

---

### Progressive Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Transparent that the goal is dismantling the War on Drugs as a tool of racial and class control; positions consistently reflect this analysis |
| Principle consistency | Applies racial justice and anti-carceral principles uniformly across criminal justice issues |
| Goalpost stability | Positions have been stable and escalating; consistently pushes beyond incremental reform toward structural change |
| Zero-sum behavior | Does not treat sentencing reform as zero-sum; views it as part of broader systemic transformation |

**Justification:** Progressives are the most principled and consistent advocates for comprehensive sentencing reform, with positions that directly follow from their analysis of structural racism and the carceral state. Their consistency makes them reliable coalition partners for any reform that moves in their direction, though they will always advocate for more.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Congressional Progressive Caucus has consistently introduced the most ambitious sentencing reform proposals
- Progressive advocacy organizations (Drug Policy Alliance, ACLU) have maintained consistent, evidence-based positions
- Progressive elected officials (e.g., Sen. Cory Booker, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries) have championed the EQUAL Act and broader reform

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 10/10 | Fully agrees with analysis of racial disparities, mass incarceration, prosecutorial overreach, and policy failure |
| Root Cause Agreement | 10/10 | Strongly agrees with structural analysis; would add emphasis on capitalism, class, and the prison-industrial complex |

**Source references:**

- Drug Policy Alliance, "Drug War, Mass Incarceration and Race," 2024
- Sentencing Project, "The Color of Justice: Racial and Ethnic Disparity in State Prisons," 2021
- Congressional Progressive Caucus, criminal justice reform legislative priorities

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Eliminate mandatory minimums | 10/10 | "Mandatory minimums are a cornerstone of mass incarceration; elimination is non-negotiable" | No reservations |
| Eliminate crack-powder disparity | 10/10 | "Eliminates the most visible symbol of racist drug sentencing" | Would prefer broader decriminalization alongside |
| Retroactive resentencing | 10/10 | "Moral imperative; resentencing is the minimum obligation to those harmed by unjust policies" | Would push for broader clemency mechanisms |
| Expand drug courts | 5/10 | "Better than prison, but still coercive; prefer full decriminalization" | Concerns about net-widening and coerced treatment |
| Racial equity monitoring | 8/10 | "Important but insufficient without structural reform" | Would prefer binding correction mechanisms, not just monitoring |
| Role-based sentencing guidelines | 7/10 | "Improvement over quantity-based, but still perpetuates incarceration" | Would prefer alternatives to incarceration entirely for most drug offenses |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Drug Sentencing Reform and Equity Act | 7/10 | "Good first step but does not go far enough; should include full decriminalization of possession" | Wants more transformative reform |
| EQUAL Act | 9/10 | "Long overdue correction of an indefensible disparity" | Supports but views as minimum acceptable reform |

#### Alternative Proposals

Progressives would push for full decriminalization of drug possession, abolition of the DEA or fundamental transformation of its mission, community investment from incarceration savings directed to historically targeted communities, and reparative justice measures for those harmed by the War on Drugs.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberals, Democratic Socialists (shared structural analysis)
- **Potential bridges:** Libertarians (shared skepticism of government power in drug enforcement)
- **Unlikely partners:** Populists, Religious Right (fundamental disagreement on morality and enforcement approach)

### Libertarian Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Individual liberty opposition to drug criminalization is deeply principled and consistent across all contexts |
| Principle consistency | Applies anti-government, pro-liberty principles uniformly; opposes all mandatory minimums and most drug penalties |
| Goalpost stability | Positions are stable and have been consistent for decades |
| Zero-sum behavior | Does not view sentencing reform as zero-sum; sees it as advancing universal liberty |

**Justification:** Libertarians are the most philosophically consistent perspective on drug sentencing, opposing government criminalization of personal drug use as a matter of fundamental principle. Their positions do not shift with political winds and they apply the same framework uniformly.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Libertarian Party platform has consistently called for ending the War on Drugs since its founding
- Cato Institute has published consistent research opposing mandatory minimums and supporting decriminalization
- Koch network (Americans for Prosperity) played a critical role in the First Step Act coalition

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Agrees that the system is excessively punitive and represents government overreach; would frame the issue as liberty rather than racial equity |
| Root Cause Agreement | 7/10 | Agrees on government overreach and perverse incentives but attributes root causes to government intervention itself rather than racial or structural factors |

**Source references:**

- Cato Institute, "Overkill: The Rise of Paramilitary Police Raids in America," 2006
- Reason Foundation, coverage of drug sentencing reform
- Americans for Prosperity, "Right on Crime" coalition statements

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Eliminate mandatory minimums | 10/10 | "Government has no legitimate authority to impose mandatory sentences for consensual activity" | No reservations |
| Eliminate crack-powder disparity | 10/10 | "Both penalties should be eliminated, not equalized" | Would prefer full decriminalization |
| Retroactive resentencing | 9/10 | "Those imprisoned unjustly should be freed" | Minor concern about process costs |
| Expand drug courts | 5/10 | "Still involves government coercion; better than prison but not ideal" | Philosophical opposition to government-mandated treatment |
| Racial equity monitoring | 4/10 | "The government should not be categorizing people by race; eliminate the laws, not monitor their disparate impact" | Philosophical opposition to racial categorization by government |
| Role-based sentencing guidelines | 5/10 | "Still involves government punishment for voluntary activity" | Would prefer eliminating most drug sentences entirely |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Drug Sentencing Reform and Equity Act | 7/10 | "Good steps to reduce government power, but does not go far enough in decriminalizing drugs" | Would prefer full legalization |
| EQUAL Act | 8/10 | "Corrects an injustice; both penalties should ultimately be zero" | Supports as incremental progress |

#### Alternative Proposals

Libertarians would support full legalization of drug use, elimination of the DEA, and replacement of all criminal drug penalties with private sector solutions (insurance, contract enforcement, voluntary treatment). They would eliminate federal drug scheduling entirely and allow market regulation.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressives (shared anti-carceral position), Conservatives (individual liberty framing)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrists (cost-effectiveness argument), Populists (anti-government framing)
- **Unlikely partners:** Religious Right (fundamental disagreement on morality of drug use)

### Constitutionalist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Federalism and enumerated powers concerns are genuinely principled |
| Principle consistency | Consistently applies federalism framework; questions federal drug authority more broadly |
| Goalpost stability | Positions are stable, rooted in constitutional text |
| Zero-sum behavior | Does not view reform as zero-sum; views it through structural constitutional lens |

**Justification:** Constitutionalists approach drug sentencing from a principled federalism framework, questioning the scope of federal drug authority while supporting state-level discretion. This framework is consistently applied, though it sometimes creates tension when federal reform is needed to address problems created by federal law.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Justice Thomas's concurrence in *Gonzales v. Raich* (2005) questioning federal drug authority
- Federalist Society scholars questioning Commerce Clause scope in drug regulation
- Consistent support for state-level experimentation in drug policy

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | Agrees that federal drug sentencing has expanded beyond constitutional warrant; frames the problem as federalism failure rather than racial injustice |
| Root Cause Agreement | 5/10 | Agrees on government overreach and prosecutorial power but emphasizes constitutional structural failures over racial or political economy analysis |

**Source references:**

- Justice Thomas, concurrence in *Gonzales v. Raich*, 545 U.S. 1 (2005)
- Federalist Society, papers on Commerce Clause and criminal law
- Tenth Amendment Center, positions on federal drug authority

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Eliminate mandatory minimums | 7/10 | "Mandatory minimums are an inappropriate legislative intrusion on judicial power" | Supports separation of powers argument for judicial discretion |
| Eliminate crack-powder disparity | 6/10 | "Congress should correct this error, or states should handle cocaine sentencing entirely" | Would prefer federal withdrawal from drug regulation |
| Retroactive resentencing | 5/10 | "Courts should have this authority, but it raises due process questions about changing rules after the fact" | Procedural concerns about retroactivity |
| Expand drug courts | 5/10 | "Should be a state-level innovation, not a federal mandate" | Federalism concerns about federal drug court mandates |
| Racial equity monitoring | 3/10 | "Federal racial monitoring of state and local sentencing raises federalism concerns" | Prefers state-level solutions |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Drug Sentencing Reform and Equity Act | 5/10 | "Correctly reduces federal overreach in sentencing, but Equity Office creates new federal bureaucracy" | Mixed: supports reducing penalties, opposes new federal institutions |
| EQUAL Act | 7/10 | "Simple correction of a legislative error; Congress should act" | Clean legislative fix aligns with constitutionalist approach |

#### Alternative Proposals

Constitutionalists would prefer a broader devolution of drug policy to states, with the federal government retaining authority only over interstate trafficking. They would support eliminating most federal drug offenses and allowing states to determine their own sentencing structures.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Libertarians (shared federalism concerns), Conservatives (overlap on limited government)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrists (structural reform framing)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressives, Democratic Socialists (fundamental disagreement on federal power and racial equity mechanisms)

---

### Populist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 2/5 - Low Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Stated concern about protecting working families from drugs often masks punitive instincts and anti-immigrant sentiment |
| Principle consistency | Anti-elite rhetoric supports reform of prosecutorial power but conflicts with tough-on-crime positioning |
| Goalpost stability | Positions shift with the political moment; supported First Step Act under Trump but shifted to fentanyl severity under different political dynamics |
| Zero-sum behavior | Often frames drug policy as us-vs-them (communities vs. dealers/cartels), which can derail nuanced reform |

**Justification:** Populists are the most unpredictable perspective on drug sentencing reform. Their anti-elite instincts can support challenging prosecutorial power and the prison-industrial complex, but their tough-on-crime instincts and susceptibility to fearmongering about drug threats make their positions unstable. The fentanyl crisis has pushed populist sentiment strongly toward severity.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- President Trump signed the First Step Act (2018) but subsequently called for the death penalty for drug dealers
- Populist media figures (Tucker Carlson, etc.) have oscillated between reform rhetoric and severity rhetoric
- Working-class communities devastated by opioids initially supported treatment approaches but have shifted toward severity as fentanyl deaths increase

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 4/10 | Agrees that working-class communities are devastated by drugs but frames the problem as external threat (cartels, traffickers, borders) rather than systemic policy failure |
| Root Cause Agreement | 3/10 | Rejects structural/racial analysis; attributes drug crisis to border security failures, Chinese fentanyl precursors, and moral decline |

**Source references:**

- Heritage Foundation/America First policy proposals on fentanyl
- Working-class media coverage of fentanyl crisis
- Trump administration drug policy statements (2017-2021)

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Eliminate mandatory minimums | 3/10 | "We should increase penalties for fentanyl dealers, not reduce them for anyone" | Opposition rooted in desire for severity against perceived threats |
| Eliminate crack-powder disparity | 4/10 | "Not a priority when fentanyl is killing Americans" | Deprioritizes racial equity in favor of current crisis response |
| Retroactive resentencing | 2/10 | "Releasing drug criminals while communities are suffering is wrong" | Strong opposition; frames as elite indifference to working-class safety |
| Expand drug courts | 6/10 | "Treatment makes sense for addicts, not for dealers" | Supports treatment for "deserving" addicts but severity for dealers |
| Racial equity monitoring | 2/10 | "This is about enforcing the law fairly, not about racial quotas" | Strong opposition to racial framing |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Drug Sentencing Reform and Equity Act | 2/10 | "This weakens our ability to fight drug cartels and protect communities" | Fundamental opposition to reducing penalties during fentanyl crisis |
| EQUAL Act | 4/10 | "Fine for crack-powder, but don't touch fentanyl penalties" | Limited, conditional support |

#### Alternative Proposals

Populists would focus on border enforcement, mandatory death penalty or life sentences for high-volume fentanyl trafficking, sanctions on Chinese chemical companies producing precursors, and expanded treatment for addicted individuals (distinguished from dealers). They would maintain or increase penalties for trafficking while potentially supporting treatment diversion for possession.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (law-and-order faction), Religious Right (moral frame)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrists (if reform is framed around community safety and fiscal savings)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressives, Libertarians, Democratic Socialists (fundamental disagreement on severity and enforcement approach)

---

### Centrist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine commitment to evidence-based policy and pragmatic reform; positions reflect data rather than ideology |
| Principle consistency | Consistently supports reforms supported by evidence; applies cost-benefit framework uniformly |
| Goalpost stability | Positions are stable and tied to evidence; adjust incrementally as new data emerges |
| Zero-sum behavior | Explicitly seeks win-win solutions; builds bridges between perspectives |

**Justification:** Centrists are reliable reform partners because their positions are tied to evidence rather than ideology. They supported the First Step Act, support the EQUAL Act, and favor expanding drug courts -- all positions grounded in data. Their main limitation is that they sometimes prioritize political feasibility over justice, accepting incrementalism when bolder action is warranted.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Bipartisan Policy Center positions on criminal justice reform
- Centrist senators (e.g., former Sen. Grassley, Sen. Durbin) co-sponsored First Step Act
- Council on Criminal Justice (chaired by centrists) recommendations on sentencing reform

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Agrees with data-driven analysis of sentencing outcomes, costs, and disparities; may want more attention to public safety metrics |
| Root Cause Agreement | 7/10 | Agrees on institutional analysis (prosecutorial power, perverse incentives) but may be less comfortable with racial/political framing |

**Source references:**

- Council on Criminal Justice, "Reducing Incarceration While Maintaining Public Safety," 2021
- Bipartisan Policy Center, criminal justice reform recommendations
- American Law Institute, "Model Penal Code: Sentencing," 2017

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Eliminate mandatory minimums | 6/10 | "Reduce and narrow mandatory minimums for most drug offenses; consider maintaining for kingpin traffickers" | Wants to preserve some deterrent structure |
| Eliminate crack-powder disparity | 9/10 | "Scientifically and morally indefensible; eliminate it" | Strong, clear support |
| Retroactive resentencing | 7/10 | "Support resentencing with appropriate risk assessment and reentry support" | Wants safeguards for public safety |
| Expand drug courts | 9/10 | "One of the most evidence-based reforms available; expand to all jurisdictions" | Strong support based on outcome data |
| Racial equity monitoring | 7/10 | "Data collection and transparency are essential; reporting requirements are appropriate" | Supports monitoring but may resist binding correction mechanisms |
| Role-based sentencing | 8/10 | "Evidence supports shifting from quantity-based to role-based sentencing" | Strong support based on USSC research |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Drug Sentencing Reform and Equity Act | 7/10 | "Mostly sound, but may be too ambitious for a single bill; consider sequencing" | Prefers staged implementation to reduce political risk |
| EQUAL Act | 9/10 | "Should have been enacted already; straightforward and bipartisan" | Strong support |

#### Alternative Proposals

Centrists would prefer a sequenced approach: EQUAL Act first, then safety valve expansion, then drug court expansion, then broader mandatory minimum reform. They would include sunset clauses and mandatory evaluation provisions to build the evidence base for each successive step.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberals (evidence-based reform), Conservatives (bipartisan track record)
- **Potential bridges:** All perspectives except extreme positions; centrists are natural coalition builders
- **Unlikely partners:** None fundamentally, but face resistance from perspectives that view incrementalism as insufficient (Progressives, Democratic Socialists) or that oppose reform entirely (Populists in fentanyl-severity mode)

---

### Religious Right Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine redemption theology motivates reform support; but this coexists with moral condemnation of drug use that can support severity |
| Principle consistency | Redemption and second chances principles support reform, but traditional morality principles can support punishment; these values are in tension |
| Goalpost stability | Positions have shifted significantly since 2015 toward reform, but the shift is fragile and could reverse under fentanyl pressure |
| Zero-sum behavior | Generally not zero-sum; redemption frame allows supporting reform without opposing punishment |

**Justification:** The Religious Right has been a surprising and valuable ally for sentencing reform, with Prison Fellowship and the National Association of Evangelicals playing key roles in the First Step Act coalition. However, the consistency of this support depends on framing -- redemption and second chances resonate, while racial equity and decriminalization framing does not. The position is genuinely mixed rather than strategic.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Prison Fellowship (founded by Chuck Colson) has been one of the most effective advocates for sentencing reform
- National Association of Evangelicals endorsed the First Step Act
- Some Religious Right figures have reverted to punitive rhetoric regarding fentanyl

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Agrees that people deserve second chances and that incarceration breaks families; uncomfortable with racial equity framing |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | Sees moral and spiritual failure as the primary root cause of drug offenses; skeptical of structural/systemic analysis |

**Source references:**

- Prison Fellowship, "Statement on Federal Sentencing Reform," 2017
- National Association of Evangelicals, policy positions on criminal justice
- Southern Baptist Convention, resolution on criminal justice reform (2017)

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Eliminate mandatory minimums | 5/10 | "Restore judicial discretion so judges can consider individual redemption potential" | Supports discretion for redemption but wants severe penalties available for the unrepentant |
| Eliminate crack-powder disparity | 6/10 | "The disparity is unjust and should be corrected" | Moderate support; not a priority issue |
| Retroactive resentencing | 6/10 | "Those who have demonstrated rehabilitation and faith deserve a second chance" | Support conditioned on evidence of moral transformation |
| Expand drug courts | 8/10 | "Treatment and accountability together reflect both justice and mercy" | Strong support; aligns with accountability + redemption framework |
| Racial equity monitoring | 3/10 | "The justice system should be colorblind; racial categories are divisive" | Theological individualism resists group-based analysis |
| Faith-based reentry programs | 9/10 | "Faith-based rehabilitation is the most effective path to lasting change" | Would prioritize faith-based over secular programs |

| Drug Sentencing Reform and Equity Act | 4/10 | "Supports some elements (judicial discretion, drug courts) but opposes racial equity framing and comprehensive mandatory minimum elimination" | Mixed; would strip equity provisions and retain some mandatories |
| EQUAL Act | 6/10 | "Addresses a legitimate injustice" | Moderate support |

#### Alternative Proposals

The Religious Right would emphasize faith-based prison programs, mentorship, and reentry support. They would support conditional reform tied to participation in rehabilitation programs. They would oppose decriminalization framing and prefer "redemption and restoration" language.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservatives (shared values base), Centrists (pragmatic overlap on drug courts)
- **Potential bridges:** Liberals (through faith-justice alliance framing used in First Step Act coalition)
- **Unlikely partners:** Libertarians (disagreement on morality of drug use), Progressives (disagreement on framing and scope), Democratic Socialists (ideological distance)

### Democratic Socialist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Transparent that the goal is dismantling the carceral state and addressing racial capitalism; positions consistently reflect this analysis |
| Principle consistency | Applies anti-carceral, anti-capitalist, and racial justice principles uniformly across all criminal justice issues |
| Goalpost stability | Positions are stable and advancing; always advocates for the most comprehensive reform possible |
| Zero-sum behavior | Does not view reform as zero-sum; views sentencing reform as part of broader societal transformation |

**Justification:** Democratic Socialists are the most comprehensive and consistent advocates for drug sentencing abolition, grounding their position in structural analysis of racial capitalism, the prison-industrial complex, and class-based enforcement. Their consistency makes them reliable allies for any reform that moves toward decarceration, though their ultimate goals go far beyond what is politically achievable in the near term.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Democratic Socialists of America platform on criminal justice (comprehensive abolitionist position)
- DSA-affiliated elected officials (e.g., Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib) consistently support the most ambitious reform proposals
- Alignment with academic abolitionist scholarship (Ruth Wilson Gilmore, Angela Davis)

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 10/10 | Fully agrees with and would extend the analysis of racial disparities, mass incarceration, and systemic failure |
| Root Cause Agreement | 10/10 | Agrees with all identified root causes and would add capitalism, class structure, and the prison-industrial complex as fundamental drivers |

**Source references:**

- Democratic Socialists of America, criminal justice platform
- Jacobin magazine, coverage of drug policy and mass incarceration
- Academic abolitionists: Ruth Wilson Gilmore, *Golden Gulag* (2007); Angela Davis, *Are Prisons Obsolete?* (2003)

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Eliminate mandatory minimums | 10/10 | "Mandatory minimums are tools of racial and class oppression; eliminate them entirely" | No reservations |
| Eliminate crack-powder disparity | 10/10 | "Eliminate the disparity and all criminal penalties for drug possession" | Would go much further |
| Retroactive resentencing | 10/10 | "Resentencing is a moral imperative; should be paired with reparations for affected communities" | Would add community investment and reparative justice |
| Expand drug courts | 4/10 | "Drug courts extend carceral logic into treatment; prefer voluntary community-based treatment" | Philosophical opposition to coerced treatment within criminal justice framework |
| Racial equity monitoring | 7/10 | "Important but reformist; the system itself should be dismantled, not monitored" | Would prefer abolition of the system being monitored |
| Community investment from savings | 10/10 | "Incarceration savings should be redirected to communities devastated by the War on Drugs" | Core priority |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Drug Sentencing Reform and Equity Act | 6/10 | "Positive but insufficient; does not decriminalize possession, does not invest in communities, does not address capitalism of the prison-industrial complex" | Supports as incremental step toward abolition |
| EQUAL Act | 8/10 | "Corrects an obvious injustice; should be part of broader decriminalization" | Supports but views as minimum |

#### Alternative Proposals

Democratic Socialists would advocate for: full decriminalization of all drug possession; abolition of the DEA; redirecting the entire federal drug enforcement budget to community investment, treatment, and harm reduction; reparations for communities targeted by the War on Drugs; public ownership of addiction treatment systems; and democratic community control over public safety.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressives (shared structural analysis), Liberals (overlapping reform goals)
- **Potential bridges:** Libertarians (shared anti-state analysis, different reasons)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservatives, Populists, Religious Right (fundamental disagreement on the role of the state, the nature of crime, and the purpose of reform)

### Common Ground Synthesis

This matrix identifies which reforms have potential cross-ideological support and which face structural opposition.

| Reform Category | Broad Support (5+) | Narrow Support (3-4) | Structural Opposition |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Eliminate crack-powder disparity | Liberal, Progressive, Libertarian, Centrist, Constitutionalist, Democratic Socialist, Conservative, Religious Right | Populist | None (4+ score from all) |
| Expand drug courts | Conservative, Liberal, Centrist, Religious Right, Populist | Progressive, Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Democratic Socialist | None strong |
| Retroactive resentencing | Liberal, Progressive, Libertarian, Centrist, Religious Right, Democratic Socialist | Constitutionalist | Conservative, Populist |
| Eliminate mandatory minimums | Liberal, Progressive, Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Centrist, Democratic Socialist | Conservative, Religious Right | Populist |
| Racial equity monitoring | Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Democratic Socialist | Libertarian | Conservative, Populist, Religious Right, Constitutionalist |

**Key insight:** The EQUAL Act has the broadest coalition potential, with near-universal support. Drug court expansion is the second-most viable reform. Mandatory minimum elimination has 6/9 perspectives in support (sufficient for legislative majority). Racial equity monitoring is the most polarizing proposal, with only 4/9 perspectives in strong support.

## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: *The Bipartisan Drug Sentencing Modernization Act*

**Bridges:** Conservative + Liberal + Centrist + Libertarian + Constitutionalist

**Core Agreement:** The current sentencing system is inefficient, costly, and produces unjust outcomes that all perspectives can acknowledge from different angles -- fiscal waste (conservatives), racial injustice (liberals), government overreach (libertarians), constitutional problems (constitutionalists), or evidence failure (centrists).

**Policy Description:**

Enact the EQUAL Act to eliminate the crack-powder disparity. Expand the safety valve to exempt all drug offenders with Criminal History Category I or II from mandatory minimums. Expand drug court availability to all federal districts. Maintain mandatory minimums for offenses involving violence, firearms, or leadership of drug organizations. Fund faith-based and secular reentry programs. Require the USSC to collect and publish sentencing data by demographics and district.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | Maintains mandatory minimums for violent/leadership offenses; expands accountability-based drug courts; funds faith-based programs |
| Liberal | Eliminates crack-powder disparity; reduces incarceration for low-level offenders; expands treatment alternatives |
| Centrist | Evidence-based reforms; phased approach; data collection for evaluation |
| Libertarian | Reduces government punishment; narrows scope of mandatory minimums |
| Constitutionalist | Restores judicial discretion for most offenders; clean legislative correction of disparity |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Accepts safety valve expansion (reduced mandatory minimum application) |
| Liberal | Accepts that mandatory minimums remain for violent/leadership offenses |
| Libertarian | Accepts that drug offenses remain criminalized |
| Constitutionalist | Accepts federal drug court mandate (federalism concern) |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 5/9 perspectives (majority)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 4/5 coalition members rated 4+ consistency (Liberal, Centrist, Libertarian, Constitutionalist)
- **Durability:** Strong. The First Step Act coalition provides a proven model. Conservative buy-in depends on maintaining public safety narrative.
- **Implementation Path:** Build on First Step Act precedent; introduce as standalone bill with bipartisan sponsors; leverage conservative champions (e.g., Senators with First Step Act track record)

---

### Compromise 2: *Treatment-First Sentencing Reform*

**Bridges:** Conservative + Liberal + Centrist + Religious Right + Populist

**Core Agreement:** All five perspectives agree that people struggling with addiction deserve treatment, not just punishment. The disagreement is over where to draw the line between "addicts who need help" and "dealers who deserve punishment."

**Policy Description:**

Create a federal pre-sentencing treatment diversion program for all drug offenders whose primary motivation was personal addiction (including user-dealers). Expand drug court funding to $500 million annually. Fund faith-based and secular reentry programs equally. Maintain or increase penalties for high-volume trafficking (especially fentanyl). Provide precursor chemical regulation and border enforcement funding alongside treatment investment.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | Maintains tough penalties for dealers; funds faith-based programs; includes border enforcement |
| Liberal | Expands treatment access; reduces incarceration for addiction-driven offenses |
| Centrist | Evidence-based approach; balanced investment in enforcement and treatment |
| Religious Right | Redemption through faith-based treatment; second chances for the repentant |
| Populist | Tough on fentanyl traffickers; protects working-class communities; includes border security |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Accepts significant new government spending on treatment |
| Liberal | Accepts that trafficking penalties remain harsh; accepts faith-based program funding |
| Centrist | Accepts less comprehensive reform than evidence might support |
| Religious Right | Accepts secular treatment programs alongside faith-based ones |
| Populist | Accepts reduced penalties for some offenders (addiction-driven) |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 5/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 2/5 coalition members rated 4+ consistency (Liberal, Centrist)
- **Durability:** Moderate. The coalition includes low-consistency perspectives (Conservative 3/5, Religious Right 3/5, Populist 2/5), requiring ongoing management. Fentanyl severity rhetoric could fracture Populist support.
- **Implementation Path:** Frame as "tough but smart" -- protecting communities by getting addicts into treatment while punishing traffickers. Bipartisan messaging required.

---

### Compromise 3: *Data-Driven Sentencing Equity Act*

**Bridges:** Liberal + Centrist + Constitutionalist + Libertarian

**Core Agreement:** All four perspectives agree that sentencing decisions should be transparent, data-informed, and subject to review. They disagree on what the data should drive (racial equity vs. cost-effectiveness vs. constitutional compliance vs. liberty maximization) but agree that data collection and analysis is a necessary first step.

**Policy Description:**

Require the USSC to conduct comprehensive annual sentencing analysis by offense type, drug type, role, demographics, and district. Require federal prosecutors to document and report charging decisions, mandatory minimum applications, substantial assistance motions, and plea offers. Publish all data publicly. Require the USSC to recommend guideline amendments when data reveals unjustified disparities. Fund state sentencing commissions to conduct parallel analysis.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Liberal | Creates accountability for racial disparities; data supports equity arguments |
| Centrist | Evidence-based approach; transparency enables informed policy |
| Constitutionalist | Transparency in government action; data enables constitutional review |
| Libertarian | Government transparency; data to justify reducing government power |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Liberal | Accepts that data collection is a means, not an end -- no binding correction mechanisms |
| Centrist | Accepts that data may reveal uncomfortable truths requiring policy change |
| Constitutionalist | Accepts some federal data mandates on state sentencing commissions |
| Libertarian | Accepts new government infrastructure (data collection apparatus) |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 4/9 perspectives (minority, but high quality)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 4/4 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** Very strong. All coalition members are high-consistency perspectives with stable positions. The coalition is small but durable.
- **Implementation Path:** Low political cost makes this achievable even without broad coalition. Frame as transparency and good government. Can be standalone legislation or embedded in appropriations.

## Strategic Implications

### Most Viable Coalition

The most viable near-term coalition mirrors the First Step Act model: **Conservative + Liberal + Centrist + Libertarian**, with Religious Right as a potential fifth member. This coalition commands a legislative majority and includes perspectives with sufficient consistency (6/9 rated 4+) to sustain engagement through the legislative process. The EQUAL Act is the reform with the broadest support and should be prioritized as the next achievable victory.

### Key Obstacles

- **Populist fentanyl severity**: The most significant obstacle to drug sentencing reform is the populist demand for harsher fentanyl penalties, which has bipartisan appeal and provides political cover for opposing any reform framed as "reducing penalties"
- **Prosecutorial institutional resistance**: Federal prosecutors remain the most organized and effective opponents of mandatory minimum reform, with direct access to congressional judiciary committees
- **Racial equity framing polarization**: Framing reform in racial equity terms mobilizes progressives and liberals but alienates conservatives, populists, and the Religious Right. The most effective coalitions use multiple framings tailored to different audiences.

### Low Consistency Partners

The Conservative (3/5) and Religious Right (3/5) perspectives require careful management:

- For Conservatives: Frame reform as fiscal responsibility, limited government, and building on the First Step Act's success. Maintain law enforcement relationships through drug court expansion and targeted fentanyl responses.
- For Religious Right: Frame reform as redemption, second chances, and family restoration. Expand faith-based program funding as a coalition sweetener.
- For Populists (2/5): Acknowledge the fentanyl crisis explicitly. Pair sentencing reform with border security and precursor chemical regulation to address populist concerns. Do not frame reform as reducing penalties -- frame it as redirecting resources to protect communities.

### Recommended Approach

1. **Lead with the EQUAL Act**: Near-universal support; clean legislative correction; demonstrated bipartisan backing
2. **Follow with Treatment-First**: Drug court expansion and treatment diversion have the broadest practical coalition (Conservative through Liberal)
3. **Sequence mandatory minimum elimination**: After building reform credibility through the above, advance comprehensive mandatory minimum reform with expanded safety valve
4. **Embed data/transparency**: Include sentencing data requirements in every reform bill to build the evidence base for successive reforms
5. **Address fentanyl separately**: Develop a targeted, evidence-based fentanyl response (precursor regulation, naloxone, treatment) that can be advanced alongside sentencing reform, preventing fentanyl from being used as a wedge against reform
