# Drug Sentencing: History

## Historical Development

The history of drug sentencing in the United States is a story of escalating severity driven by moral panic, racial politics, and institutional inertia, followed by slow, uneven reform. From the first federal drug laws in the early 20th century through the War on Drugs and mandatory minimums of the 1980s-1990s to the incremental reforms of the 2010s, drug sentencing has evolved in response to shifting public fears, political calculations, and -- more recently -- evidence about what actually works.

### Early Drug Regulation (1900-1950): From Medicine to Morality

- **Harrison Narcotics Tax Act (1914)**: The first major federal drug law regulated the distribution of opiates and cocaine through a tax-and-registration scheme. Though framed as a revenue measure, it was quickly interpreted to criminalize physicians who prescribed narcotics to addicts, effectively criminalizing addiction itself.
- **Racial Framing**: Early drug laws were deeply intertwined with racial prejudice. Congressional debate on the Harrison Act invoked fears of cocaine use among Black men in the South. State-level opium laws targeted Chinese immigrants. Cannabis prohibition, which accelerated in the 1930s, drew on anti-Mexican sentiment.
- **Federal Bureau of Narcotics**: Established in 1930 under Harry Anslinger, the FBN aggressively promoted punitive drug policy for three decades. Anslinger's campaigns relied heavily on racial fearmongering, particularly regarding cannabis and Black jazz musicians.
- **Boggs Act (1951)**: Established the first federal mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses -- 2 years for a first marijuana possession offense, 5 years for a second, and 10 years for a third. This marked the beginning of mandatory minimums in drug law.
- **Narcotic Control Act (1956)**: Increased penalties further, with a mandatory minimum of 5 years for a first selling offense and 10 years for subsequent offenses. Jury-recommended death penalty was authorized for selling heroin to minors.

### The Pendulum Swings Toward Treatment (1960s-1970s): Brief Reform

- **Kennedy-Era Reforms**: The 1960s saw growing medical and social science consensus that addiction was a disease. The Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act of 1966 authorized civil commitment for treatment as an alternative to incarceration.
- **Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act (1970)**: This landmark law, which created the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), actually **reduced** penalties for drug offenses. It eliminated mandatory minimums for simple possession and classified drugs into five schedules based on medical use, abuse potential, and safety.
- **Nixon's War on Drugs (1971)**: President Nixon declared drug abuse "public enemy number one" in June 1971, but his administration initially invested heavily in treatment. The Special Action Office for Drug Abuse Prevention (SAODAP) expanded methadone maintenance and treatment capacity. Nixon's drug budget allocated two-thirds to demand reduction.
- **Sentencing Reform Act of 1984**: Created the U.S. Sentencing Commission and mandated the development of federal sentencing guidelines to reduce sentencing disparities. The Commission's guidelines, which took effect in 1987, established a structured system based on offense severity and criminal history. For drug offenses, the guidelines tied sentences primarily to drug type and quantity.

### The Crack Epidemic and Mandatory Minimums (1986-1994): Escalation

- **Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986**: Passed in the immediate aftermath of Len Bias's death from a cocaine overdose (widely but incorrectly attributed to crack cocaine), this law established the mandatory minimum sentencing framework that still shapes federal drug law. It created the infamous 100-to-1 crack-to-powder cocaine disparity: 5 grams of crack triggered a 5-year mandatory minimum, while the same penalty for powder cocaine required 500 grams. The law was drafted in a matter of weeks with minimal deliberation. No hearings were held on the crack-powder disparity before it was enacted.
- **Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988**: Expanded mandatory minimums and created the nation's first mandatory minimum for simple drug possession -- 5 years for possession of 5 grams or more of crack cocaine. No other drug carried a mandatory minimum for mere possession. This provision disproportionately targeted Black Americans, who constituted the majority of crack users prosecuted in federal court.
- **1988 Omnibus Crime Bill**: Established the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) and the "drug czar" position, institutionalizing the enforcement-first approach at the White House level.
- **Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994**: The largest federal crime bill in history expanded the federal death penalty to include large-scale drug trafficking, created the federal "three strikes" law (mandatory life sentences for third violent felony or serious drug offense), and provided billions in funding for state prison construction contingent on states adopting "truth-in-sentencing" laws requiring inmates to serve at least 85% of their sentences.
- **State-Level Escalation**: States followed the federal lead. New York's Rockefeller Drug Laws (enacted 1973) had set the template, imposing mandatory minimums of 15 years to life for possession of small amounts of narcotics. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, nearly every state enacted or expanded mandatory minimums and habitual offender laws for drug offenses.

### The Incarceration Explosion (1980-2008): Consequences

- **Population Growth**: The number of Americans incarcerated for drug offenses grew from approximately 40,000 in 1980 to over 500,000 by 2009 -- a more than twelvefold increase (National Research Council, 2014). Drug offenses became the single largest driver of federal prison growth.
- **Racial Impact**: By 2003, Black men were incarcerated for drug offenses at 11.8 times the rate of white men, despite similar rates of drug use (Human Rights Watch, 2009). The crack-powder disparity was the most visible mechanism, but prosecutorial discretion, policing patterns, and mandatory minimums all contributed.
- **Federal Prison Overcrowding**: Federal prisons reached 137% of rated capacity by 2012. The Bureau of Prisons consumed an increasingly large share of the Department of Justice budget, rising from 16% in 1990 to over 25% by 2013.
- **Judicial Criticism**: Federal judges increasingly criticized mandatory minimums. In 2003, U.S. District Judge John S. Martin Jr. resigned, citing mandatory minimums as a "one-size-fits-all approach" that "often results in sentences that are unjust." Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy told the ABA in 2003 that "our resources are misspent, our punishments too severe, our sentences too long."

### The Reform Era (2005-Present): Incremental Progress

- ***United States v. Booker* (2005)**: The Supreme Court held that the federal sentencing guidelines, as mandatory, violated the Sixth Amendment. The guidelines became advisory, giving judges greater discretion to depart from recommended ranges. This was the most important structural change to federal sentencing since the guidelines' creation.
- **USSC Guideline Amendments (2007, 2014)**: The Sentencing Commission reduced drug offense guidelines twice -- in 2007 for crack cocaine offenses (Amendment 706, made retroactive) and in 2014 for all drug offenses (Amendment 782, made retroactive). Amendment 782 alone made approximately 46,000 federal drug offenders eligible for reduced sentences.
- **Fair Sentencing Act of 2010**: Reduced the crack-to-powder cocaine sentencing ratio from 100-to-1 to 18-to-1, raising the crack quantity triggers to 28 grams (5-year minimum) and 280 grams (10-year minimum). It also eliminated the mandatory minimum for simple possession of crack cocaine. The law did not apply retroactively at the time of enactment.
- **Smart on Crime Initiative (2013)**: Attorney General Eric Holder directed federal prosecutors to avoid charging mandatory minimums for low-level, nonviolent drug offenders without ties to large-scale organizations, gangs, or cartels. This policy change contributed to a decline in average federal drug sentences.
- **First Step Act (2018)**: Signed by President Trump with broad bipartisan support, the First Step Act: (a) made the Fair Sentencing Act retroactive, enabling ~2,660 resentencings; (b) expanded the safety-valve exception to mandatory minimums; (c) reformed Section 924(c) "stacking" provisions; (d) increased good-time credit; (e) created the Earned Time Credits system; and (f) expanded compassionate release. It represented the most significant bipartisan criminal justice reform in decades.
- **Biden Administration (2021-2025)**: President Biden issued pardons for federal simple marijuana possession convictions (October 2022, December 2023), directed the scheduling review that led to the proposed rescheduling of marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III (2024), and the DOJ under Attorney General Garland continued the Smart on Crime approach to prosecutorial charging.
- **State Reforms Continue**: Between 2000 and 2024, more than 33 states enacted reforms reducing mandatory minimums, creating new diversion options, or reclassifying drug possession offenses. Notable examples include New York (2009), California (2012, 2014), Mississippi (2014), Oklahoma (2016), Louisiana (2017), and Connecticut (2015).

## Lessons from History

### Pattern 1: Moral Panic Drives Disproportionate Policy

Every major expansion of drug sentencing severity has been triggered by a moral panic -- often racialized -- rather than by evidence-based analysis. The Boggs Act followed media hysteria about juvenile drug use. The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 was passed in weeks following Len Bias's death, without hearings on the crack-powder disparity. The 1994 crime bill rode a wave of fear about violent crime that was already declining. In each case, the legislative response far exceeded what evidence would support, and the consequences -- particularly for communities of color -- were devastating and long-lasting.

### Pattern 2: Reform Follows Consequences, Not Evidence

Despite decades of research showing that mandatory minimums and lengthy drug sentences do not effectively deter drug use or trafficking, reform has advanced primarily when the consequences of harsh sentencing became politically unsustainable. The opioid crisis, which disproportionately affected white rural communities, shifted conservative attitudes toward treatment. Federal prison overcrowding created fiscal pressure. State budget crises forced governors to reconsider incarceration costs. Evidence was necessary but insufficient; political conditions had to align.

### Pattern 3: Incremental Reform Leaves Structural Problems Intact

Each reform has addressed a specific symptom without dismantling the underlying architecture of punitive drug sentencing. The Fair Sentencing Act reduced the crack-powder ratio but did not eliminate it. The First Step Act expanded the safety valve but did not abolish mandatory minimums. Guideline amendments reduced sentences but left the quantity-based framework intact. This pattern of incremental reform means that each generation inherits structural problems that require additional legislative action.
