# Drug Sentencing

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of drug sentencing policy in the United States, encompassing mandatory minimum sentences, federal sentencing guidelines, three-strikes laws, state sentencing disparities, and reform efforts including the First Step Act and EQUAL Act.

## Overview

Drug sentencing policy sits at the intersection of criminal justice, public health, and racial equity. The United States incarcerates more people for drug offenses than any other nation -- approximately 350,000 individuals on any given day across federal and state systems. Federal mandatory minimum sentences, established primarily by the Anti-Drug Abuse Acts of 1986 and 1988, removed judicial discretion and imposed severe penalties based on drug type and quantity, producing profound racial disparities. The 100-to-1 crack-to-powder cocaine sentencing ratio, in effect from 1986 to 2010, became the most visible symbol of racially disparate drug enforcement.

Reform has advanced incrementally. The Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 reduced the crack-to-powder ratio to 18-to-1. The First Step Act of 2018 made this reduction retroactive and expanded compassionate release, good-time credit, and safety-valve provisions. The EQUAL Act, which would eliminate the remaining crack-to-powder disparity entirely, has received bipartisan support but has not yet been enacted. Meanwhile, states vary enormously in their sentencing approaches, from jurisdictions that have eliminated mandatory minimums for drug offenses to those that maintain sentences of 20 years or more for possession.

This analysis examines sentencing structures, their outcomes, racial and socioeconomic disparities, reform efforts, and evidence-based alternatives. It proposes a comprehensive framework for sentencing reform grounded in proportionality, judicial discretion, treatment integration, and racial equity.
