# Drug Sentencing: Stakeholders

The drug sentencing system is shaped by the interactions of several key groups, each with distinct interests, power, and resources. Understanding these stakeholders -- who is affected, who holds power, and where interests align or conflict -- is essential to designing reform strategies that can navigate political and institutional resistance.

## Who Is Affected

### Primary Stakeholders

| Group | Impact | Size | Key Interests |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|
| People incarcerated for drug offenses | Direct loss of liberty, collateral consequences (employment, housing, family separation, voting rights) | ~350,000 (all systems, any given day) | Sentence reduction, resentencing, reentry support |
| Families of incarcerated individuals | Economic hardship, family disruption, stigma, children's developmental outcomes | ~2.7 million children with a parent in prison (all offenses); estimated 500,000+ affected by drug sentences | Family reunification, sentence proportionality, visitation access |
| Communities of color | Disproportionate enforcement, mass incarceration, economic devastation, political disenfranchisement | Black Americans: 13.6% of population, 26.2% of federal drug defendants; Hispanic Americans: 19.1% of population, 44.8% of federal drug defendants | Racial equity, elimination of disparities, community investment |
| People with substance use disorders | Criminalization rather than treatment, incarceration that interrupts recovery, post-release barriers | 48.7 million Americans with SUD (SAMHSA, 2024); significant overlap with incarcerated population | Treatment-based alternatives, diversion programs, destigmatization |
| Federal and state judges | Constrained by mandatory minimums, unable to sentence according to individual circumstances | ~1,700 federal judges; ~30,000 state court judges | Judicial discretion, evidence-based sentencing, proportionality |

### Secondary Stakeholders

- **Defense attorneys**: Public defenders (who handle >80% of federal drug cases) face overwhelming caseloads and limited resources to challenge mandatory minimums or negotiate alternatives. Private defense attorneys serve clients who can afford them, creating a two-tier system.
- **Communities where drug enforcement is concentrated**: Low-income urban neighborhoods bear the brunt of aggressive drug policing, including surveillance, stop-and-frisk, and no-knock warrants.
- **Taxpayers**: The annual cost of incarcerating federal drug offenders alone exceeds $2.7 billion (BOP, FY2024). State and local costs add billions more.
- **Victims of drug-related crime**: People affected by drug trafficking violence have a stake in sentencing that effectively reduces drug market violence, though evidence suggests that incarceration-focused approaches do not achieve this.

## Who Has Power

### Decision Makers

| Actor | Role | Authority | Resources | Influence Level |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| U.S. Congress | Sets mandatory minimums and sentencing statutes | Legislative power over federal drug sentencing | N/A | High |
| U.S. Sentencing Commission | Sets and amends federal sentencing guidelines | Quasi-legislative authority; guidelines shape sentences for all federal offenses | ~$19 million annual budget (FY2024) | High |
| Federal prosecutors (DOJ/U.S. Attorneys) | Determine charges, mandatory minimum application, plea offers, substantial assistance motions | Charging discretion effectively controls sentences | 93 U.S. Attorney offices; ~5,800 federal prosecutors | Very High |
| Attorney General | Sets DOJ charging policy, priorities, and enforcement directives | Supervisory authority over all federal prosecutors | DOJ budget: $38.6 billion (FY2024) | High |
| Federal judges | Impose sentences within statutory and guideline frameworks | Sentencing authority, post-*Booker* discretion | N/A | High (constrained) |
| State legislatures | Set state drug sentencing laws, mandatory minimums, and classification | Full authority over state criminal law | Varies by state | High (state level) |
| State governors | Sign/veto sentencing legislation; clemency power | Executive authority; appointment of judges in some states | Varies | High (state level) |
| Bureau of Prisons | Administers federal prison system; implements compassionate release, good-time credits | Administrative authority over ~160,000 inmates | $8.4 billion budget (FY2024) | Medium |

### Key Organizations and Institutions

- **Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)**: Enforces federal drug laws; recommends scheduling decisions; operates a budget exceeding $3.3 billion (FY2024). The DEA has historically opposed sentencing reform and supported maintaining or increasing penalties.
- **National District Attorneys Association (NDAA)**: Represents ~2,700 elected prosecutors nationally. Has generally opposed mandatory minimum reform, arguing minimums are essential tools for securing cooperation and plea agreements.
- **National Association of Assistant United States Attorneys (NAAUSA)**: Represents federal line prosecutors. Has actively lobbied against mandatory minimum reform, including opposing the Smarter Sentencing Act and aspects of the First Step Act.
- **Federal Public Defenders**: Represent indigent federal defendants. Consistently advocate for sentencing reform, reduced mandatory minimums, and expanded judicial discretion. Operate with significantly fewer resources than prosecutors.
- **U.S. Sentencing Commission**: Seven-member bipartisan commission that sets guidelines, analyzes data, and advises Congress. Has become an increasingly important voice for evidence-based reform.

### Influencers

- **Reform advocacy organizations**: The Sentencing Project, FAMM (Families Against Mandatory Minimums), American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Drug Policy Alliance, and the Brennan Center for Justice conduct research, public advocacy, and direct lobbying for sentencing reform.
- **Conservative reform organizations**: Right on Crime, Americans for Prosperity (Koch network), FreedomWorks, and the R Street Institute provide political cover for Republican lawmakers supporting reform, framing it in terms of fiscal responsibility, limited government, and religious redemption.
- **Academic researchers**: Scholars at institutions including the University of Minnesota Robina Institute, Vera Institute of Justice, RAND Corporation, and Urban Institute produce research on sentencing outcomes, deterrence, and racial disparities that informs reform debates.
- **Faith-based organizations**: Prison Fellowship (founded by Chuck Colson), the National Association of Evangelicals, and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops have supported sentencing reform on moral and redemption grounds.

## Stakeholder Interests and Alignment

### Aligned Interests (Potential Coalition Partners)

| Coalition | Shared Interest | Strength |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Civil liberties + fiscal conservatives | Reducing incarceration costs; limiting government overreach | Strong (basis of First Step Act coalition) |
| Racial justice advocates + libertarians | Ending disproportionate enforcement; individual liberty | Moderate (different motivations, same direction) |
| Judges + defense attorneys + reform advocates | Restoring judicial discretion; evidence-based sentencing | Strong (professional expertise alignment) |
| Faith communities + reentry organizations | Second chances; redemption; family reunification | Strong (moral/values alignment) |
| Public health advocates + treatment providers | Treatment alternatives to incarceration; harm reduction | Strong (evidence-based alignment) |
| Fiscal hawks + state governors | Reducing corrections spending; reinvesting savings | Moderate to Strong (budget pressure alignment) |

### Conflicting Interests

- **Prosecutors vs. judges**: Prosecutors want mandatory minimums to preserve plea leverage; judges want discretion to sentence individually
- **Law enforcement agencies vs. reform advocates**: DEA and drug task forces resist reforms that reduce enforcement budgets and arrest metrics; reform advocates seek to redirect resources to treatment and prevention
- **Private prison companies vs. incarcerated individuals**: Private prisons profit from high incarceration rates; incarcerated individuals seek sentence reductions
- **"Tough on crime" politicians vs. evidence-based reform**: Politicians who have built careers on severity resist reforms they fear opponents will use against them
- **Victims' rights organizations vs. sentencing reform advocates**: Some victims' groups oppose sentence reductions, though this opposition is not universal -- some victim advocates support treatment-based approaches

### The Sentencing Iron Triangle

The drug sentencing system features an iron triangle of mutually reinforcing interests:

1. **Prosecutors** benefit from mandatory minimums that give them plea leverage
2. **Law enforcement** benefits from drug enforcement funding, asset forfeiture, and arrest metrics
3. **Corrections industry** (public and private) benefits from the population that prosecutors and law enforcement deliver

These three groups share a structural interest in maintaining high drug sentencing levels, and each reinforces the others' position. Prosecutors advocate for enforcement tools that generate cases; law enforcement delivers defendants to prosecutors; corrections benefits from the resulting incarceration. Reform must either break this triangle by changing incentives or build a coalition powerful enough to overcome it.

## Influence Mechanisms

How stakeholders exert influence on drug sentencing policy:

- **Lobbying**: Private prison companies spent $4.6 million on federal lobbying in 2022 (OpenSecrets, 2023). Prosecutors' associations maintain active lobbying presences in Washington and state capitals. Reform organizations collectively spend less on lobbying but have grown their presence significantly since 2015.
- **Campaign Contributions**: CoreCivic and GEO Group contributed $1.9 million to federal candidates and PACs in the 2022 cycle (OpenSecrets, 2023). Law enforcement unions contribute heavily at the state level, particularly to prosecutors and legislators on judiciary committees.
- **Revolving Door**: Former prosecutors serve in Congress, on the Sentencing Commission, and in DOJ leadership. Former DOJ officials join law firms representing corporate clients in drug enforcement matters. This revolving door tends to favor the prosecutorial perspective in policy discussions.
- **Public Advocacy**: Reform organizations have become increasingly effective at public advocacy, leveraging social media, documentary films (e.g., *13th*), investigative journalism, and personal stories of people affected by harsh sentencing. The bipartisan nature of recent reform coalitions has expanded media coverage and public support.
- **Expertise/Information**: The U.S. Sentencing Commission's data reports are the most authoritative source on federal sentencing patterns. Academic research from the Vera Institute, Urban Institute, and university-based scholars informs policy debates. Both reform advocates and opponents selectively cite research to support their positions.
