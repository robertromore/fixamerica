# Drug Sentencing: Solutions

Drug sentencing reform requires a multi-faceted approach that eliminates the structural flaws of mandatory minimums, restores proportionality, addresses racial disparities, integrates treatment alternatives, and reallocates resources from incarceration to evidence-based interventions.

---

## Reform Framework

### Guiding Principles

- **Proportionality**: Sentences should be proportional to the actual harm caused and the defendant's culpability, not determined solely by drug type and quantity
- **Judicial Discretion**: Judges -- not legislators or prosecutors -- should have the primary authority to determine sentences based on individual circumstances
- **Racial Equity**: Reform must explicitly address and rectify the cumulative racial disparities produced by decades of discriminatory enforcement
- **Evidence-Based**: Sentencing policy should be guided by empirical research on deterrence, recidivism, treatment effectiveness, and cost-benefit analysis
- **Treatment Integration**: People with substance use disorders who commit drug offenses should have access to evidence-based treatment as an alternative to or complement to incarceration

### Theory of Change

Eliminating mandatory minimums restores judicial discretion, which allows judges to impose sentences proportional to individual circumstances. Reducing sentence lengths frees resources that can be redirected to treatment, prevention, and reentry programs. Retroactive application of reforms addresses the cumulative harm of past policies. Racial impact review mechanisms prevent future disparities. Together, these changes reduce the incarcerated population, improve outcomes for individuals with substance use disorders, and produce net fiscal savings -- all while maintaining or improving public safety, as demonstrated by the First Step Act's outcomes and state-level reform experience.

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Eliminate Federal Mandatory Minimum Sentences for Drug Offenses

**Description**: Repeal all federal mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses under 21 U.S.C. Sections 841 and 844. Replace them with advisory sentencing guidelines that allow judges to consider the full range of individual circumstances, including the defendant's role in the offense, criminal history, personal characteristics, and substance use disorder status. Retain statutory maximum sentences to provide an upper bound for the most serious offenses. Require the U.S. Sentencing Commission to develop revised guidelines that incorporate role-based sentencing factors.

**Evidence Base**: The National Research Council's 2014 report, *The Growth of Incarceration in the United States*, concluded that mandatory minimums "have not been shown to have a deterrent effect and have resulted in unduly severe sentences for some offenders." The USSC has recommended that Congress reconsider mandatory minimums in multiple reports (1991, 2011, 2017). Twenty-nine states have reformed or reduced mandatory minimums for drug offenses since 2000, with no documented increase in drug trafficking or use (Vera Institute, 2023). Research by the Brennan Center for Justice (2016) found no statistical relationship between mandatory minimum sentences and drug use rates.

**Implementation**: Requires federal legislation to amend 21 U.S.C. Sections 841 and 844. The USSC would revise guidelines within 18 months of enactment. Resentencing would be available for all currently incarcerated individuals sentenced under eliminated mandatory minimums.

**Cost/Resources**: Net savings. BOP estimates that each year of incarceration costs $39,158 per inmate (FY2023). Reducing the federal drug offense population by even 20% (~13,200 inmates) would save approximately $517 million annually. Implementation costs for resentencing proceedings and revised guidelines would be modest by comparison.

**Timeline**: Legislative enactment: 1-2 years. Guidelines revision: 18 months post-enactment. Resentencing: 2-4 years for full processing.

**Challenges**: Prosecutorial opposition (loss of plea leverage); political attacks framing reform as "soft on crime"; resistance from some law enforcement groups.

**Impact Metrics**: Average federal drug sentence length; mandatory minimum application rate; racial disparity in sentence length; federal drug offense prison population; recidivism rates of resentenced individuals.

### Solution 2: Eliminate the Crack-Powder Cocaine Sentencing Disparity

**Description**: Enact the EQUAL Act to establish a 1-to-1 ratio between crack and powder cocaine sentencing thresholds, with retroactive application. Set the unified threshold at the current powder cocaine levels (500 grams for 5-year minimum, 5 kilograms for 10-year minimum). Apply retroactively to all individuals currently serving sentences under the prior disparity.

**Evidence Base**: The USSC has recommended eliminating the crack-powder disparity in reports to Congress in 1995, 1997, 2002, and 2007. The National Institute on Drug Abuse, the American Medical Association, and the American Bar Association have all concluded that crack and powder cocaine are pharmacologically identical and that the disparity lacks scientific justification. The EQUAL Act has received bipartisan support in multiple Congresses. The Fair Sentencing Act's reduction of the ratio from 100-to-1 to 18-to-1 did not produce any increase in cocaine use or trafficking.

**Implementation**: Straightforward statutory amendment to 21 U.S.C. Section 841(b). Retroactive resentencing through the USSC and federal courts.

**Cost/Resources**: Net savings through reduced incarceration. Estimated 2,000-3,000 individuals eligible for immediate resentencing. USSC and federal courts would require modest additional resources for resentencing proceedings.

**Timeline**: Legislative enactment: 1 year. Retroactive resentencing: 1-2 years.

**Challenges**: Diminishing political will; risk of being deprioritized amid fentanyl crisis; some opposition from prosecutors who use crack charges strategically.

**Impact Metrics**: Crack-powder ratio; racial composition of crack defendants; average crack sentence length vs. powder cocaine; number of resentencings.

### Solution 3: Establish Sentencing Review and Racial Impact Assessment

**Description**: Require the U.S. Sentencing Commission to conduct biennial racial impact assessments of all federal sentencing guidelines and mandatory minimums. Require federal prosecutors to document the racial demographics of their charging decisions and mandatory minimum applications by district. Mandate that the USSC develop guidelines amendments to address any identified disparities. Create a Federal Sentencing Equity Office within the USSC to monitor ongoing disparities and recommend corrections.

**Evidence Base**: The USSC's own research has documented persistent racial disparities that cannot be explained by legally relevant factors (USSC, 2017). Minnesota, Connecticut, and Iowa have enacted state-level racial impact statement requirements for criminal justice legislation, providing a model. The USSC already collects comprehensive sentencing data; this solution extends analysis to charging decisions and mandatory minimum application patterns.

**Implementation**: Requires federal legislation. The USSC would establish the Equity Office and begin data collection within 12 months. First biennial report within 24 months.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $5-10 million annually for the Equity Office, data collection, and analysis. Minimal relative to the cost of ongoing incarceration disparities.

**Timeline**: Legislation: 1-2 years. Office establishment: 12 months. First report: 24 months.

**Challenges**: Data collection from prosecutors' offices may face institutional resistance; defining "disparity" vs. "legally justified difference" involves methodological complexity; political resistance to explicit racial equity framing.

**Impact Metrics**: Publication of biennial reports; documented reduction in unexplained racial disparities; prosecutor compliance with reporting requirements.

### Solution 4: Expand and Strengthen Drug Courts and Diversion Programs

**Description**: Create a federal mandate and funding mechanism for pre-trial and pre-sentencing drug diversion programs in all federal judicial districts. Expand funding for state drug courts and diversion programs through the Byrne JAG program. Require that all individuals charged with drug possession offenses (and non-violent trafficking offenses involving personal addiction) be offered a treatment-based diversion option. Successful completion of diversion would result in dismissal or reduction of charges.

**Evidence Base**: The National Association of Drug Court Professionals reports that drug courts reduce recidivism by 8-14 percentage points compared to traditional prosecution (Marlowe et al., 2016). A RAND Corporation study found that drug treatment is 7 times more cost-effective than domestic law enforcement and 10 times more cost-effective than interdiction at reducing cocaine use (Caulkins et al., 2005). There are currently approximately 3,800 drug courts operating in the U.S. (NADCP, 2024), but coverage is incomplete and many eligible individuals do not have access.

**Implementation**: Federal legislation to mandate diversion options. Appropriations for federal drug court expansion and state grants. Training for federal judges, prosecutors, and public defenders in diversion program administration.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $500 million annually in federal funding for expanded drug courts and diversion programs. Drug courts cost approximately $5,000-$7,000 per participant per year, compared to $39,158 per year for federal incarceration. Net savings realized within 3-5 years.

**Timeline**: Legislation: 1-2 years. Program expansion: 2-4 years for full national coverage.

**Challenges**: Resistance from prosecutors who view diversion as undermining accountability; capacity constraints in treatment systems; quality control across diverse jurisdictions.

**Impact Metrics**: Drug court availability by district; diversion program enrollment; completion rates; recidivism comparison; cost per participant vs. incarceration.

### Solution 5: Retroactive Resentencing for All Drug Offenses

**Description**: Create a comprehensive retroactive resentencing mechanism for all individuals currently serving federal drug sentences imposed under pre-reform mandatory minimums or guidelines. Establish a right to petition for resentencing under current law and guidelines. Provide appointed counsel for all resentencing petitions. Require courts to apply a presumption of resentencing unless the government demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the individual poses a specific, articulable public safety risk.

**Evidence Base**: The First Step Act's retroactive provisions have resulted in over 30,000 beneficiaries with minimal public safety impact (USSC, 2024). Amendment 782 retroactivity allowed ~46,000 resentencings with documented low recidivism among beneficiaries. The USSC's 2022 recidivism study found that individuals who received sentence reductions had recidivism rates comparable to or lower than those who served full sentences, controlling for risk factors.

**Implementation**: Federal legislation creating the resentencing right. Federal public defenders and appointed counsel handle petitions. Courts process resentencings on an expedited timeline.

**Cost/Resources**: Federal defender and court costs for processing petitions (estimated $100-200 million over 4 years). Offset by savings from reduced incarceration -- each released individual saves $39,158 annually.

**Timeline**: Legislation: 1-2 years. Resentencing processing: 2-5 years for full implementation.

**Challenges**: Volume of petitions may strain court resources; determining appropriate resentencing standards; ensuring adequate reentry support for released individuals.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of petitions filed; resentencing grant rate; average sentence reduction; recidivism among resentenced individuals; net fiscal savings.

### Solution 6: Reform Federal Sentencing Guidelines for Drug Offenses

**Description**: Direct the U.S. Sentencing Commission to fundamentally revise the drug sentencing guidelines to prioritize role-based sentencing over quantity-based sentencing. The revised guidelines would assign offense levels based primarily on the defendant's role in the offense (organizer/leader, manager/supervisor, distributor, courier, user-seller), with quantity serving as a secondary factor. Aggravating factors (violence, firearms, exploitation of minors) would increase sentences. Mitigating factors (addiction, minimal role, coercion) would decrease them.

**Evidence Base**: The USSC has acknowledged that quantity-based sentencing is a poor proxy for culpability and public safety risk. Commission research shows that couriers and low-level sellers receive sentences similar to managers and organizers when quantity thresholds are met, inverting the intended sentencing hierarchy. Role-based sentencing is the norm in most Western democracies and has been recommended by the American Law Institute's Model Penal Code: Sentencing revision (2017).

**Implementation**: Congressional directive to the USSC or USSC-initiated guideline amendment. Revised guidelines would take effect approximately 18 months after initiation.

**Cost/Resources**: Minimal direct cost. USSC would absorb revision within existing budget. Net savings from reduced sentences for low-level offenders.

**Timeline**: Congressional directive or USSC initiative: 1 year. Guidelines revision: 18 months. Implementation: ongoing.

**Challenges**: Defining role categories precisely; ensuring consistency across districts; potential resistance from prosecutors who benefit from quantity-based charging.

**Impact Metrics**: Distribution of offense levels by role category; sentence disparity between high-level and low-level offenders; racial disparity in role classification.

### Solution 7: Expand Compassionate Release and Elderly Offender Provisions

**Description**: Broaden compassionate release eligibility to include all federal drug offenders who have served at least 10 years and are over age 50, have a terminal illness, or have experienced extraordinary family circumstances. Reduce the mandatory exhaustion of administrative remedies from 30 days to 15 days. Require the Bureau of Prisons to proactively identify and counsel eligible individuals.

**Evidence Base**: The USSC found that the recidivism rate for federal offenders over age 50 is 16.0%, compared to 44.7% for those under 30 (USSC, 2022). Elderly inmates cost approximately $70,000 per year due to healthcare needs -- nearly double the standard per-inmate cost (DOJ OIG, 2015). The First Step Act expanded compassionate release access, but the BOP has been slow to implement the provisions, and many eligible individuals remain unaware of their rights.

**Implementation**: Federal legislation to expand eligibility criteria and reduce procedural barriers. BOP policy changes to implement proactive identification.

**Cost/Resources**: Net savings. Each elderly inmate released saves $70,000+ annually. Reentry costs are offset by savings within the first year.

**Timeline**: Legislation: 1 year. Implementation: 6-12 months.

**Challenges**: BOP institutional resistance to expanded releases; ensuring adequate reentry support and healthcare; political optics of releasing drug offenders.

**Impact Metrics**: Compassionate release petition rate; grant rate; time from petition to decision; recidivism among released individuals; healthcare cost savings.

## International Models

### Portugal: Decriminalization and Treatment Referral

**Description**: In 2001, Portugal decriminalized personal possession of all drugs. Individuals found with drugs below a 10-day supply threshold are referred to "dissuasion commissions" that can recommend treatment, impose minor sanctions, or take no action. Criminal penalties remain for trafficking.

**Results**: Drug-related deaths declined from 80 in 2001 to 16 in 2012 before rising modestly with the European fentanyl trend. HIV infections among people who inject drugs fell by 95%. Drug use rates remained comparable to European averages. The prison population for drug offenses declined by over 40%.

**Applicability to U.S.**: Portugal's model demonstrates that decriminalizing possession and investing in treatment does not increase drug use. However, Portugal's universal healthcare system and smaller scale present implementation differences. The U.S. could adapt the dissuasion commission model at the state or federal level, pairing decriminalization with treatment funding. Oregon's Measure 110 (2020) attempted a similar approach but struggled with treatment capacity -- a lesson for implementation.

### Germany: Day-Fine Sentencing System

**Description**: Germany uses a day-fine system for many offenses, including drug offenses below trafficking thresholds. Fines are calculated based on the offender's daily income, making penalties proportional to economic capacity. Incarceration is reserved for serious trafficking and repeat offenses.

**Results**: Germany's incarceration rate (69 per 100,000) is approximately 1/9th of the U.S. rate (664 per 100,000), while drug use rates are comparable. The day-fine system reduces incarceration for low-level offenses while maintaining accountability.

**Applicability to U.S.**: The day-fine model could be adapted for drug possession and low-level distribution offenses in the U.S., reducing incarceration while maintaining proportional consequences.

### Canada: Drug Treatment Courts and Conditional Sentencing

**Description**: Canada operates drug treatment courts in major cities and allows conditional sentences (served in the community) for drug offenses with sentences under two years. The emphasis is on treatment and supervision rather than incarceration.

**Results**: Canadian drug treatment courts report completion rates of approximately 30-40%, with graduates showing significantly lower recidivism than non-participants. Conditional sentences have reduced prison populations without measurable increases in drug-related crime.

**Applicability to U.S.**: Canada's drug treatment court model closely resembles U.S. drug courts and validates expanding them. The conditional sentence framework could inform development of community-based supervision alternatives for federal drug offenses.

## Pilot Programs and Demonstrations

- **Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act pilots**: Several federal districts have informally piloted reduced charging policies under DOJ's Smart on Crime initiative (2013-2017), with no documented increase in drug crime
- **State mandatory minimum reforms**: Over 33 states have enacted reforms since 2000, collectively demonstrating that reduced sentences do not increase drug activity. New York, California, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Oklahoma provide particularly strong evidence
- **Federal compassionate release expansion**: The First Step Act's compassionate release provisions have resulted in >7,000 grants (all offenses, FY2020-2024) with very low recidivism, validating expanded release criteria

## Sequencing and Prioritization

### Quick Wins (0-2 years)

- Enact the EQUAL Act to eliminate the crack-powder cocaine disparity
- Expand compassionate release eligibility for elderly and long-serving drug offenders
- Direct the USSC to begin comprehensive guideline revision for drug offenses
- Issue DOJ guidance restoring Smart on Crime charging policies for low-level drug offenses

### Medium-term Reforms (2-5 years)

- Eliminate all federal mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses
- Create comprehensive retroactive resentencing mechanism
- Establish the Federal Sentencing Equity Office and biennial racial impact assessment
- Expand drug court and diversion funding to achieve national coverage

### Long-term Transformation (5-10 years)

- Transition to fully role-based sentencing for drug trafficking offenses
- Implement federal day-fine or community-based alternatives for drug possession
- Achieve measurable elimination of racial disparities in drug sentencing outcomes
- Establish ongoing evidence-based review cycle for all drug sentencing policies

## Complementary Policies

- **Treatment expansion**: Sentencing reform must be paired with treatment capacity expansion; diversion programs fail without available treatment slots (see [Drug Treatment](../drug-treatment/07-solutions.md))
- **Reentry support**: Individuals released through resentencing need housing, employment, healthcare, and community support (see [Reentry analysis in justice domain](../../justice/reentry/07-solutions.md))
- **Policing reform**: Sentencing reform addresses downstream consequences but does not fix upstream disparities in drug enforcement (see [Racial Disparities](../racial-disparities/07-solutions.md))
- **Cannabis legalization**: Federal cannabis legalization would eliminate the largest single category of drug arrests, complementing sentencing reform (see [Cannabis Legalization](../cannabis-legalization/07-solutions.md))
