# Drug Sentencing: Opposition to Reform

Proposals to reform drug sentencing -- including eliminating mandatory minimums, reducing sentences, expanding judicial discretion, and creating treatment-based alternatives -- face resistance from those who believe that severe penalties deter drug offenses, that mandatory minimums are essential tools for prosecutors, and that reducing sentences threatens public safety. This opposition has been historically powerful, though its influence has diminished as bipartisan reform coalitions have strengthened.

### Ideological Opposition

- **Traditional Conservative**: Believes harsh sentences are morally justified as retribution for law-breaking and necessary for deterrence. Frames drug dealing as predatory behavior that victimizes communities. Concerned that reform signals moral permissiveness.
- **Law-and-Order Populist**: Views drug dealers as enemies of working-class communities. Supports severe punishment, including for fentanyl traffickers. Associates sentencing reform with elite indifference to communities suffering from drug epidemics.
- **Prosecutors' Perspective**: Mandatory minimums are essential "tools" that enable cooperation agreements and guilty pleas. Without them, prosecutors argue, high-level traffickers would be harder to convict, and investigations would suffer.
- **Victims' Advocacy (subset)**: Some victims' rights organizations oppose sentence reductions, arguing that shorter sentences trivialize the harm caused by drug trafficking. This position is not universal among victims' groups.

## Opposition Arguments and Rebuttals

### Argument 1: Mandatory Minimums Deter Drug Offenses

**Claim**: Harsh mandatory minimums deter drug trafficking and use by imposing severe, certain consequences. Reducing sentences will lead to more drug activity and more overdose deaths.

**Evidence Cited**: Proponents point to the economic theory of deterrence -- that rational actors weigh costs and benefits. They cite anecdotal cases where drug traffickers reported being aware of penalties and adjusting behavior accordingly.

**Reality**: The empirical evidence overwhelmingly contradicts the deterrence claim for drug offenses. The National Research Council's comprehensive 2014 review concluded that "the increase in incarceration may have caused a decrease in crime, but the magnitude is highly uncertain and the evidence suggests it was unlikely to have been large." For drug offenses specifically, the evidence is even weaker. A 2016 Brennan Center study found "no statistically significant relationship between state-level incarceration rates and drug use or drug arrests." The certainty of apprehension, not sentence severity, is the primary deterrent factor identified by criminological research. Drug markets replace incarcerated sellers rapidly, limiting any incapacitation effect.

**Rebuttal**: The U.S. imposed increasingly severe drug sentences from 1986 to 2010 while drug use remained stable, drug prices fell (indicating increased supply), and overdose deaths increased dramatically. The period of greatest sentencing severity coincided with the greatest expansion of the drug crisis. Deterrence theory assumes rational actors making informed cost-benefit calculations, but drug trafficking is driven by poverty, addiction, and limited alternatives -- not by careful analysis of sentencing statutes.

### Argument 2: Mandatory Minimums Are Essential Prosecutorial Tools

**Claim**: Mandatory minimums enable prosecutors to secure cooperation from defendants, who agree to provide information about higher-level traffickers in exchange for sentence reductions. Without mandatory minimums, prosecutors would lose their most effective lever for dismantling drug organizations.

**Evidence Cited**: Prosecutors routinely cite the "substantial assistance" mechanism (18 U.S.C. Section 3553(e)), which allows sentencing below mandatory minimums when defendants cooperate. They argue that this tool depends on the existence of severe mandatory minimums to create sufficient incentive.

**Reality**: While mandatory minimums do create cooperation incentives, they also create perverse incentives. Defendants with the least information (low-level offenders) have the least to offer and thus receive the harshest sentences, while higher-level offenders with more information can negotiate better deals. The U.S. Sentencing Commission has documented this "cooperation paradox": leaders and organizers receive substantial assistance departures at higher rates than couriers and street-level dealers (USSC, 2011). This inverts the intended sentencing hierarchy.

**Rebuttal**: Federal investigations functioned effectively before mandatory minimums were enacted in 1986. The FBI, DEA, and other agencies have extensive investigative tools -- wiretaps, surveillance, undercover operations, financial analysis, informant management -- that do not depend on mandatory minimums. Many states have reduced or eliminated drug mandatory minimums without experiencing increases in drug trafficking or decreases in prosecution effectiveness. The claim that mandatory minimums are "essential" conflates "useful to prosecutors" with "necessary for public safety."

### Argument 3: Reducing Sentences Threatens Public Safety

**Claim**: People incarcerated for drug offenses pose a genuine threat to public safety. Many "drug offenders" are actually involved in violence, firearms possession, or organized crime. Releasing them early or reducing their sentences will increase crime.

**Evidence Cited**: Opponents point to cases where individuals with drug convictions also have histories of violence. They note that drug trafficking is inherently associated with violence and that federal drug cases often involve weapons charges.

**Reality**: The USSC found that 36.2% of federal drug trafficking offenders in FY2023 had no criminal history points (Criminal History Category I), indicating no prior convictions. The recidivism rate for federal drug trafficking offenders released after sentence completion is 37.2% over 8 years -- lower than the rate for most other federal offense categories (USSC, 2022). Those who have received compassionate release or sentence reductions under the First Step Act have had very low recidivism rates. The fact that some drug offenders have violent histories argues for individualized sentencing, not for mandatory minimums that apply regardless of circumstances.

**Rebuttal**: Sentencing reform does not mean eliminating consequences for drug offenses. It means calibrating those consequences to actual culpability, danger, and public safety needs. Judges are better positioned than legislators to assess individual defendants' risk and circumstances. The First Step Act's resentencing provisions have resulted in thousands of early releases with minimal public safety impact, providing real-world evidence that reduced sentences do not produce the catastrophic outcomes opponents predict.

### Argument 4: The Crack-Powder Disparity Is Justified by Crack's Greater Harm

**Claim**: The crack-powder cocaine sentencing disparity is justified because crack is more addictive, more associated with violence, and more destructive to communities than powder cocaine.

**Evidence Cited**: Opponents of equalizing crack and powder sentences cite crack's association with open-air drug markets, higher rates of emergency room visits during the crack epidemic, and the violence associated with crack distribution networks.

**Reality**: Crack and powder cocaine are pharmacologically identical -- crack is simply cocaine processed with baking soda for smoking. The National Institute on Drug Abuse, the American Medical Association, and the U.S. Sentencing Commission have all concluded that the pharmacological effects are the same and that the disparity is not scientifically justified. The violence associated with crack in the 1980s was a function of the drug market's structure (territorial disputes in a new market), not the drug itself. The USSC has recommended eliminating the disparity in multiple reports to Congress (1995, 1997, 2002, 2007).

**Rebuttal**: The disparity was created in weeks without hearings or scientific input, and its primary effect has been to impose dramatically harsher sentences on Black Americans. In FY2023, 77.1% of federal crack defendants were Black, while only 5.2% were white (USSC, FY2023). The Fair Sentencing Act's reduction of the ratio from 100-to-1 to 18-to-1 was enacted with bipartisan support, including from many who had previously supported the original ratio. No increase in cocaine use or trafficking resulted from the reduction.

### Argument 5: Reform Is Dangerous During the Fentanyl Crisis

**Claim**: Now is the worst possible time to reduce drug sentences because the fentanyl crisis is killing over 75,000 Americans per year. Harsher penalties for fentanyl distribution are needed, not sentencing reform.

**Evidence Cited**: The dramatic rise in fentanyl overdose deaths (from ~19,000 in 2016 to ~75,000 in 2023) and the extreme lethality of fentanyl (active in microgram quantities).

**Reality**: The fentanyl crisis has worsened dramatically during a period of historically severe drug sentences. Between 2016 and 2023, fentanyl deaths quadrupled despite federal mandatory minimums, aggressive DEA enforcement, and expanded interdiction. The supply of fentanyl is driven by its economics -- it is cheap to manufacture from precursor chemicals without agricultural inputs, making it far more resistant to interdiction than plant-based drugs. Harsher sentences for fentanyl distribution have not reduced supply or deaths; they risk repeating the errors of the crack era by imposing severe penalties that fall disproportionately on low-level actors.

**Rebuttal**: The fentanyl crisis demands an effective response, not merely a severe one. Public health measures -- expanded access to naloxone, fentanyl test strips, medication-assisted treatment, overdose prevention centers, and precursor chemical regulation -- have demonstrated effectiveness in reducing overdose deaths. Sentencing severity has not. Proposing harsher fentanyl sentences in the face of this evidence repeats the fundamental error of the War on Drugs: equating severity with effectiveness.

## Historical Patterns of Opposition

Opposition to drug sentencing reform has evolved but maintained consistent themes:

- **1990s-2000s**: Opposition was nearly universal in both parties. The "tough on crime" consensus meant that few politicians of either party would advocate for reduced drug sentences. Prosecutors and law enforcement dominated policy discussions with minimal challenge.
- **2005-2015**: Cracks in the consensus appeared as the fiscal costs of mass incarceration became undeniable and the opioid crisis affected conservative constituencies. Right on Crime (founded 2010) provided political cover for Republican reformers. The Fair Sentencing Act (2010) passed with bipartisan support.
- **2016-2020**: The First Step Act coalition demonstrated that reform could attract broad support. Opposition narrowed to a core of prosecutors' groups and law enforcement unions. The Trump administration's support for the First Step Act weakened the "soft on crime" attack.
- **2021-present**: The fentanyl crisis has partially restored the "tough on crime" frame, with some members of Congress proposing new mandatory minimums for fentanyl. Opposition has regrouped around fentanyl as the new justification for severity. Reform advocates must now distinguish between trafficking and possession, and between effective and performative responses to the crisis.

## Counter-Strategies

### Political Strategies

- **Bipartisan coalition maintenance**: Continue building left-right coalitions by framing reform in terms that appeal to both parties -- fiscal responsibility, limited government, and redemption for conservatives; racial justice, public health, and evidence-based policy for liberals
- **State-level leadership**: Demonstrate reform success at the state level, where over 33 states have already enacted reforms, creating a track record that inoculates against federal-level opposition
- **Personal stories**: Amplify the voices of people directly affected by harsh sentencing, including those who have been resentenced under the First Step Act and have successfully reintegrated
- **Champion recruitment**: Identify and support Republican champions for reform, as conservative support is essential for overcoming "soft on crime" attacks

### Communication Strategies

- **Reframe the debate**: Shift from "tough on crime vs. soft on crime" to "smart on crime vs. wasteful on crime." Emphasize that sentencing reform redirects resources to approaches that actually reduce drug use, overdose deaths, and recidivism.
- **Lead with data**: Use the USSC's own data showing that sentence reductions have not produced public safety problems, and that First Step Act beneficiaries have low recidivism rates
- **Distinguish trafficking from possession**: Make clear that reform is not about eliminating consequences for drug trafficking, but about calibrating consequences proportionally and preserving judicial discretion
- **Expose the costs**: Highlight that incarcerating one federal prisoner costs $39,158 per year (BOP, FY2023), and that the $2.7 billion spent annually on federal drug incarceration could fund treatment, prevention, and reentry programs with far greater public safety returns

### Policy Design Strategies

- **Build in accountability**: Include recidivism tracking, outcome reporting, and automatic review provisions in all sentencing reform legislation
- **Grandfather current law enforcement tools**: Maintain cooperation incentives through mechanisms other than mandatory minimums, such as substantial assistance motions from judges or sentencing enhancements for proven leadership roles
- **Address fentanyl specifically**: Propose targeted, evidence-based responses to the fentanyl crisis (precursor chemical regulation, expanded naloxone access, treatment funding) alongside sentencing reform, rather than treating reform and fentanyl response as mutually exclusive
