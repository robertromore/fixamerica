# Drug Sentencing: What You Can Do

Drug sentencing reform is one of the rare policy areas where bipartisan coalitions have achieved meaningful change -- the First Step Act demonstrated that citizen engagement, personal stories, and cross-partisan advocacy can move Congress to act. Continued progress depends on sustained public attention and organized advocacy at the federal, state, and local levels.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- Read the U.S. Sentencing Commission's annual reports and data tables to understand federal sentencing patterns: <https://www.ussc.gov/research/annual-reports-sourcebooks>
- Follow FAMM (Families Against Mandatory Minimums) for updates on federal and state sentencing reform: <https://famm.org/>
- Subscribe to The Marshall Project's newsletter for criminal justice reporting: <https://www.themarshallproject.org/subscribe>
- Read Michelle Alexander's *The New Jim Crow* for historical context on drug sentencing and racial equity
- Track your state's sentencing laws and reform efforts through the Vera Institute's state profiles: <https://www.vera.org/>

### Make Personal Changes

- Examine your own assumptions about drug offenses, sentencing, and public safety; research shows that most people overestimate the deterrent effect of sentence length
- If you serve on a jury, understand that jury nullification is a legal right -- jurors can acquit if they believe a law or sentence is unjust, though judges are not required to inform jurors of this right
- If you are an employer, consider adopting "ban the box" hiring practices that do not ask about criminal history on initial applications

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact Your Representatives**: Call or write your U.S. Senators and Representative when sentencing reform legislation is pending, including the EQUAL Act and any mandatory minimum reform bills
- **Submit Public Comments**: When the U.S. Sentencing Commission proposes guideline amendments, public comment periods are open -- submit comments supporting evidence-based sentencing reform at <https://www.ussc.gov/>
- **Write Letters to the Editor**: Respond to local media coverage of drug crime by providing data on sentencing effectiveness and the costs of mass incarceration
- **Share Information**: Use social media to amplify stories of people affected by harsh drug sentencing and to share data from the USSC and reform organizations

---

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- Form or join a local criminal justice reform group focused on sentencing issues; many faith communities, civic organizations, and community groups are active in this space
- Host a screening of documentaries on mass incarceration and the War on Drugs (*13th*, *The House I Live In*, *Time: The Kalief Browder Story*) followed by discussion
- Partner with local reentry organizations to support people returning from incarceration for drug offenses -- volunteer for mentoring, job training, or housing assistance programs
- Organize town halls with local prosecutors and judges to discuss sentencing practices in your jurisdiction

### Build Coalitions

- Connect with both progressive (ACLU, Drug Policy Alliance) and conservative (Right on Crime, Americans for Prosperity) organizations working on sentencing reform; bipartisan coalitions are the proven pathway to legislative success
- Engage faith communities, which have been powerful voices for sentencing reform -- Prison Fellowship, the National Association of Evangelicals, and Catholic Charities all support reform
- Build relationships with local defense attorneys and public defenders, who have direct experience with sentencing disparities and can provide expert testimony at public events

## Political Actions

### Contact Elected Officials

**When to Contact**:

- When the EQUAL Act or other sentencing reform bills are scheduled for committee markup or floor vote
- During annual budget and appropriations season (February-September), when drug court and treatment funding is determined
- When your state legislature considers mandatory minimum reform bills
- After high-profile drug sentencing cases that illustrate the need for reform

**What to Say - Template Email**:

```
Subject: Support Drug Sentencing Reform -- Pass the EQUAL Act

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

I am a constituent from [City, State], and I am writing to urge you to support drug sentencing reform, including the EQUAL Act, which would eliminate the remaining crack-to-powder cocaine sentencing disparity.

The 18-to-1 crack-to-powder ratio has no scientific basis -- crack and powder cocaine are pharmacologically identical -- and disproportionately harms Black Americans, who constitute 77% of federal crack defendants. The U.S. Sentencing Commission has recommended eliminating this disparity in four separate reports to Congress.

More broadly, I urge you to support eliminating mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses, which research shows do not deter drug use or trafficking but impose enormous costs on families, communities, and taxpayers. The federal government spends $39,158 per year to incarcerate each prisoner, and federal drug inmates cost over $2.7 billion annually. This money would be far more effectively spent on treatment, prevention, and reentry programs.

The First Step Act proved that bipartisan sentencing reform is possible and popular. I urge you to build on that success.

Thank you for your service and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say - Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City]. I'm calling to urge [Representative/Senator] [Name] to support drug sentencing reform, including the EQUAL Act. The crack-to-powder cocaine disparity has no scientific basis and disproportionately harms Black Americans. I also support eliminating mandatory minimums for drug offenses, which cost taxpayers billions without reducing drug use. Can you please note my position? Thank you."
```

### Support Legislation

Current or proposed legislation to support:

- **EQUAL Act**: Eliminates the crack-to-powder cocaine sentencing disparity by establishing a 1-to-1 ratio with retroactive application. Contact members of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees.
- **Smarter Sentencing Act**: Reduces (but does not eliminate) mandatory minimums for drug offenses and expands the safety valve. Bipartisan sponsors in previous Congresses.
- **State mandatory minimum reform bills**: Many states consider mandatory minimum reform annually. Check your state legislature's session calendar and contact state representatives.
- **Drug court and treatment funding**: Support appropriations for the Byrne JAG program, SAMHSA treatment grants, and drug court expansion.

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "Do you support eliminating mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses? If not, why do you believe they are effective despite research showing they do not deter drug use?"
2. "Will you support the EQUAL Act to eliminate the crack-to-powder cocaine sentencing disparity?"
3. "What is your plan to address racial disparities in drug sentencing, given that Black men receive sentences 17.7% longer than similarly situated white men?"
4. "Do you support expanding drug courts and treatment-based alternatives to incarceration for drug offenses?"

**Voting Considerations**:

- Look for candidates who endorse specific reform legislation rather than offering vague statements about "smart on crime" approaches
- Check whether candidates have accepted campaign contributions from private prison companies or prosecutors' associations that oppose reform
- Review candidates' records on past sentencing votes if they are incumbents -- the First Step Act vote record is publicly available

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing drug sentencing reform with others, emphasize:

1. **Cost-effectiveness**: Incarcerating one federal prisoner costs $39,158 per year (BOP, FY2023). Treatment is 7 times more cost-effective than enforcement at reducing drug use (RAND Corporation). We are spending billions on an approach that does not work.
2. **Racial justice**: Black men receive federal drug sentences 17.7% longer than similarly situated white men, even after controlling for offense severity and criminal history (USSC, 2017). The remaining crack-to-powder disparity has no scientific basis and primarily impacts Black Americans.
3. **Proven reform success**: The First Step Act has resentenced over 30,000 people with minimal public safety impact. Over 33 states have reformed mandatory minimums since 2000 without increases in drug crime.
4. **Bipartisan support**: The First Step Act passed with overwhelming bipartisan support (87-12 in the Senate). Sentencing reform is supported by organizations from the ACLU to Right on Crime, from Prison Fellowship to the Drug Policy Alliance.

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "Most drug prisoners are violent criminals" | 36.2% of federal drug trafficking offenders have no prior convictions (Criminal History Category I) | USSC, FY2023 |
| "Mandatory minimums deter drug use" | Research finds no statistical relationship between mandatory minimums and drug use rates | Brennan Center, 2016 |
| "Drug offenders have high recidivism" | Federal drug trafficking offenders have a 37.2% recidivism rate over 8 years -- lower than most other federal offense categories | USSC, 2022 |
| "Crack is more dangerous than powder cocaine" | Crack and powder cocaine are pharmacologically identical; the USSC, NIDA, AMA, and ABA all agree the disparity is not scientifically justified | USSC reports (1995, 1997, 2002, 2007) |
| "Sentencing reform increases crime" | States that reduced drug sentences since 2000 have not experienced increases in drug crime | Vera Institute, 2023 |
