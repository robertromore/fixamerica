# Drug Sentencing: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

Drug sentencing reform requires a phased strategy that sequences politically achievable reforms first, builds momentum through demonstrated outcomes, and progresses toward comprehensive structural change. The strategy leverages the bipartisan coalition that produced the First Step Act, expands it with state-level reform evidence, and uses fiscal, public safety, and racial equity arguments tailored to different constituencies. Each phase builds on the prior one: Phase 1 enacts discrete reforms with existing bipartisan support; Phase 2 addresses structural issues that require broader consensus; Phase 3 completes the transformation to a fully evidence-based, proportional sentencing system.

---

## Phase 1: Targeted Reform and Coalition Building (Years 1-2)

### Objectives

- Eliminate the crack-powder cocaine sentencing disparity
- Expand compassionate release for elderly and long-serving drug offenders
- Restore DOJ Smart on Crime charging policies
- Initiate USSC guideline revision process

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Enact the EQUAL Act (1-to-1 crack-powder ratio) | Congress (bipartisan) | Months 1-12 | Legislative staff; coalition lobbying | Signed into law; retroactive application begins |
| Expand compassionate release eligibility | Congress | Months 1-12 | Legislative staff; BOP implementation guidance | Eligibility criteria expanded; 2,000+ petitions filed |
| DOJ charging policy directive (Smart on Crime restoration) | Attorney General | Months 1-6 | DOJ internal policy process | Directive issued; mandatory minimum charging declines 15%+ |
| USSC initiates drug guideline revision | USSC (Congressional directive or sua sponte) | Months 6-18 | USSC staff and commissioners; public hearings | Formal revision process launched; proposed amendments published |
| Federal defender training on resentencing | Federal Public Defenders | Months 3-12 | Training budget: $5 million | All 90 federal defender offices trained |
| Data collection pilot for racial impact assessment | USSC | Months 6-18 | $2 million for pilot | Pilot data collected from 10 federal districts |

### Legislative Requirements

- EQUAL Act (or equivalent statutory amendment to 21 U.S.C. Section 841(b))
- Compassionate Release Expansion Act (amendment to 18 U.S.C. Section 3582(c)(1)(A))
- Appropriations for federal defender training and USSC data pilot

### Expected Outcomes

Phase 1 eliminates the most visible and indefensible disparity in federal drug sentencing (crack-powder), demonstrates continued bipartisan capacity for reform, and initiates the technical groundwork for comprehensive guideline revision. Estimated 3,000-5,000 individuals resentenced or released. Annual savings: $150-250 million.

---

## Phase 2: Structural Reform (Years 3-5)

### Objectives

- Eliminate all federal mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses
- Create comprehensive retroactive resentencing mechanism
- Establish the Federal Sentencing Equity Office
- Expand drug courts and diversion to national coverage

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Enact Drug Sentencing Reform and Equity Act | Congress | Months 24-36 | Major legislative effort; bipartisan coalition | Signed into law |
| USSC publishes revised drug sentencing guidelines (role-based) | USSC | Months 30-42 | USSC staff; public comment process | New guidelines take effect |
| Retroactive resentencing program launched | Federal courts | Months 36-48 | $100 million for federal defenders and courts | 15,000+ petitions processed |
| Federal Sentencing Equity Office established | USSC | Months 30-42 | $10 million annual budget | Office operational; first biennial report |
| National drug court expansion grants | DOJ (OJP) | Months 24-48 | $500 million annual appropriation | Drug courts available in all 94 federal districts |
| Model state sentencing reform legislation published | USSC / DOJ | Months 24-36 | Policy staff; state liaison | Model legislation available; 10+ states adopt elements |

### Legislative Requirements

- Drug Sentencing Reform and Equity Act (comprehensive legislation eliminating mandatory minimums, creating resentencing right, establishing Equity Office)
- FY2028-2030 appropriations for drug court expansion, Equity Office, resentencing processing

### Expected Outcomes

Phase 2 fundamentally restructures federal drug sentencing by eliminating mandatory minimums, establishing role-based guidelines, and creating institutional mechanisms for ongoing racial equity monitoring. Estimated 15,000-25,000 resentencings. Drug court availability expands to all federal districts and 80% of state counties. Annual savings: $500 million-$1 billion.

---

## Phase 3: System Transformation (Years 6-10)

### Objectives

- Complete transition to role-based, evidence-informed sentencing
- Achieve measurable elimination of racial disparities in drug sentencing
- Establish permanent review cycle for sentencing policy effectiveness
- Integrate sentencing with treatment and reentry systems

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Full implementation of role-based guidelines across all circuits | USSC / Federal courts | Years 6-7 | Training; appellate review | Consistent application; inter-circuit variation <15% |
| Third biennial racial equity report and policy adjustments | USSC Equity Office | Year 6 | Ongoing budget | Unexplained racial disparities reduced by 50%+ from baseline |
| Federal day-fine / community-based alternative program pilot | DOJ / USSC | Years 6-8 | $50 million pilot budget | Pilot in 10 districts; evaluation complete |
| Comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of reform | USSC / GAO | Year 8 | $5 million | Published report documenting fiscal and public safety outcomes |
| Permanent sentencing review cycle established | USSC (statutory mandate) | Year 8-10 | Ongoing USSC budget | 5-year automatic review of all drug sentencing policies |
| Integration with reentry and treatment systems | DOJ / HHS / SAMHSA | Years 6-10 | Interagency coordination; $200 million annually | 80% of drug offenders have reentry plan; 60% access treatment |

### Expected Outcomes

Phase 3 completes the transformation to a drug sentencing system that is proportional, evidence-based, racially equitable, and integrated with treatment and reentry. Cumulative resentencings: 30,000-50,000. Federal drug offense prison population reduced to ~35,000 (from ~66,000 baseline). Racial disparity in average drug sentence reduced to within 5% after controlling for legally relevant factors. Permanent review mechanisms prevent regression.

## Governance and Oversight

- **U.S. Sentencing Commission**: Primary body for guidelines revision, data collection, racial impact assessment, and ongoing policy evaluation
- **Senate and House Judiciary Committees**: Legislative oversight; annual hearings on reform implementation
- **DOJ Office of the Inspector General**: Audits of BOP implementation of compassionate release, resentencing, and reentry programs
- **Government Accountability Office**: Independent evaluation of reform costs, savings, and public safety outcomes (commissioned reports at Years 3, 5, and 10)
- **Federal Sentencing Equity Office** (new): Biennial racial equity reports; real-time monitoring of sentencing patterns; recommendations for guideline adjustments

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: High-Profile Crime by Resentenced Individual

**Likelihood**: Medium (statistical probability given volume of resentencings)

**Impact**: High (political backlash could stall or reverse reform)

**Mitigation Strategy**: Include rigorous risk assessment in resentencing process. Require post-release supervision for all resentenced individuals during initial 12-month period. Collect and publish recidivism data proactively to demonstrate overall safety record. Ensure reentry support (housing, treatment, employment) to minimize recidivism risk.

**Contingency Plan**: Prepare data-driven response showing overall recidivism rates; deploy bipartisan champions to counter narrative; emphasize that risk assessment excluded high-risk individuals.

### Risk 2: Political Reversal Under Future Administration

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: High (executive action could reverse DOJ policies; legislative reversal would require Congressional action)

**Mitigation Strategy**: Codify reforms in statute rather than relying on executive action. Build strong bipartisan support to make repeal politically costly. Ensure USSC independence from executive branch pressure. Embed reforms in institutional structures (Equity Office, review cycles) that are harder to dismantle.

**Contingency Plan**: State-level adoption of reforms creates independent bases of policy; USSC guideline changes are structurally difficult to reverse.

### Risk 3: Insufficient Treatment and Reentry Capacity

**Likelihood**: High (Oregon's Measure 110 experience demonstrates this risk)

**Impact**: Medium (undermines diversion programs; recidivism increases)

**Mitigation Strategy**: Phase diversion expansion to match treatment capacity buildup. Front-load treatment funding in appropriations. Coordinate with SAMHSA and HHS for capacity planning. Use state block grants to build local treatment infrastructure.

**Contingency Plan**: Temporary use of telehealth and hub-and-spoke treatment models while brick-and-mortar capacity expands.

### Risk 4: Prosecutorial Circumvention

**Likelihood**: High (prosecutors may shift to state charges or alternative federal charges)

**Impact**: Medium (undermines reform impact without formal resistance)

**Mitigation Strategy**: Include anti-circumvention provisions in legislation. Monitor charging patterns through USSC data. AG directive requiring documented justification for charges exceeding guideline recommendations. Transparency reporting on charging decisions.

**Contingency Plan**: Legislative amendment to close identified circumvention pathways.

## Resource Requirements

### Funding

| Phase | Estimated Cost | Funding Source | Notes |
