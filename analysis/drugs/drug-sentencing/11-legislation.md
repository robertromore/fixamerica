# Drug Sentencing: Legislation

## Overview

Drug sentencing reform requires a combination of federal legislation to eliminate mandatory minimums and the crack-powder disparity, U.S. Sentencing Commission guideline revisions to adopt role-based sentencing, and state model legislation to harmonize reforms across jurisdictions. This document presents two major federal bills -- the Drug Sentencing Reform and Equity Act and the EQUAL Act -- along with model state legislation and a comprehensive loopholes analysis. The legislative approach is incremental by design, building on the bipartisan foundation established by the First Step Act of 2018 while advancing structural reforms that the First Step Act left unfinished.

---

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for drug sentencing reform.* The Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3) and the Necessary and Proper Clause provide ample constitutional authority for federal drug sentencing legislation. The Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment provides a constitutional basis for proportionality review. State reforms operate under state legislative authority over criminal law.

119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To reform federal drug sentencing by eliminating mandatory minimum
sentences for drug offenses, establishing role-based sentencing
guidelines, creating a retroactive resentencing mechanism, and
instituting racial equity monitoring.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Drug Sentencing Reform and Equity
Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) According to the Bureau of Prisons (2024), approximately
66,000 individuals are incarcerated in federal prisons for drug
offenses, constituting 45.3% of the federal prison population.

(2) According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission (FY2023), 56.2%
of federal drug offenders are sentenced under mandatory minimum
provisions, which constrain judicial discretion regardless of
individual circumstances.

(3) The U.S. Sentencing Commission (2017) found that Black men
receive federal drug sentences approximately 17.7% longer than
similarly situated white men after controlling for offense level,
criminal history, and other legally relevant factors.

(4) The National Research Council (2014) concluded that mandatory
minimum sentences "have not been shown to have a deterrent effect
and have resulted in unduly severe sentences for some offenders."

(5) The RAND Corporation has found that drug treatment is seven
times more cost-effective than domestic law enforcement at reducing
cocaine use.

(6) The First Step Act of 2018 demonstrated that bipartisan
sentencing reform can be achieved, with over 30,000 beneficiaries
and minimal adverse public safety impact through 2024.

(7) More than 33 states have reformed mandatory minimum sentences
for drug offenses since 2000, without documented increases in drug
trafficking or use.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:

(1) COMMISSION.--The term "Commission" means the United States
Sentencing Commission.

(2) COVERED OFFENSE.--The term "covered offense" means a
violation of section 401, 404, 406, or 409 of the Controlled
Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 841, 844, 846, 849) or section
1010 of the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21
U.S.C. 960).

(3) EQUITY OFFICE.--The term "Equity Office" means the Federal
Sentencing Equity Office established under section 7.

(4) ROLE-BASED SENTENCING.--The term "role-based sentencing"
means a sentencing framework in which the primary determinant
of sentence severity is the defendant's role and culpability
in the offense, including but not limited to whether the
defendant served as an organizer, leader, manager, supervisor,
distributor, courier, or user-seller.

SEC. 4. ELIMINATION OF MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES FOR DRUG
OFFENSES.

(a) IN GENERAL.--Section 401(b) of the Controlled Substances Act
(21 U.S.C. 841(b)) is amended by striking all provisions
establishing mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment for offenses
under this section and inserting in lieu thereof maximum terms of
imprisonment as follows:

    (1) For offenses involving quantities described in paragraph
    (1)(A) of such section as in effect on the day before the
    date of enactment of this Act, the maximum term of
    imprisonment shall be not more than 40 years.

    (2) For offenses involving quantities described in paragraph
    (1)(B) of such section as in effect on the day before the
    date of enactment of this Act, the maximum term of
    imprisonment shall be not more than 20 years.

    (3) For all other drug trafficking offenses, the maximum term
    of imprisonment shall be not more than 10 years.

(b) SIMPLE POSSESSION.--Section 404(a) of the Controlled
Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 844(a)) is amended to provide that the
maximum term of imprisonment for simple possession shall be not
more than 1 year.

(c) PRIOR OFFENSE ENHANCEMENTS.--All provisions of sections
401(b) and 404(a) of the Controlled Substances Act providing for
enhanced penalties based on prior drug offense convictions are
repealed.

(d) EFFECTIVE DATE.--The amendments made by this section shall
apply to any offense committed on or after the date of enactment
of this Act, and to any sentencing proceeding that takes place on
or after such date regardless of when the offense was committed.

SEC. 5. ROLE-BASED SENTENCING GUIDELINES.

(a) DIRECTIVE TO COMMISSION.--Not later than 18 months after the
date of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall promulgate
revised sentencing guidelines for drug offenses that--

    (1) assign offense levels based primarily on the defendant's
    role in the offense, using categories including but not
    limited to: organizer/leader, manager/supervisor, distributor,
    courier, and user-seller;

    (2) treat drug type and quantity as secondary factors that
    may adjust the base offense level within the role-based
    framework;

    (3) provide for aggravating adjustments for the use or
    threatened use of violence, possession of firearms, and
    exploitation of minors;

    (4) provide for mitigating adjustments for substance use
    disorder, minimal role, coercion, and cooperation;

    (5) ensure that the guidelines produce sentences that are
    proportional to the defendant's actual culpability and
    do not impose greater punishment on low-level offenders
    than on leaders and organizers of the same operation.

(b) DATA COLLECTION.--The Commission shall collect and publish
data on the application of role-based sentencing by circuit,
district, defendant demographics, and drug type.

SEC. 6. RETROACTIVE RESENTENCING.

(a) RIGHT TO PETITION.--Any person serving a federal sentence
for a covered offense imposed under a mandatory minimum provision
repealed by this Act, or under sentencing guidelines in effect
before the revised guidelines promulgated under section 5, may
file a petition for resentencing with the sentencing court.

(b) APPOINTMENT OF COUNSEL.--Any petitioner under this section
who is unable to afford counsel shall be appointed counsel at
government expense.

(c) PRESUMPTION OF RESENTENCING.--There shall be a rebuttable
presumption in favor of resentencing under the revised guidelines
or statutory maximums, whichever produces the lower sentence. The
government may rebut this presumption only by demonstrating, by
clear and convincing evidence, that the petitioner poses a
specific, articulable risk to public safety that cannot be
adequately addressed through conditions of supervised release.

(d) CONSIDERATIONS.--In determining the appropriate resentence,
the court shall consider--

    (1) the factors set forth in section 3553(a) of title 18,
    United States Code;
    (2) the defendant's disciplinary record and rehabilitation
    efforts during incarceration;
    (3) the defendant's age and health status;
    (4) the impact of continued incarceration on the defendant's
    family, including minor children; and
    (5) any change in law or sentencing policy since the original
    sentence was imposed.

(e) TIMELINE.--Courts shall endeavor to rule on resentencing
petitions within 120 days of filing.

SEC. 7. FEDERAL SENTENCING EQUITY OFFICE.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.--There is established within the Commission
the Federal Sentencing Equity Office.

(b) DUTIES.--The Equity Office shall--

    (1) conduct biennial assessments of racial, ethnic, and
    socioeconomic disparities in federal drug sentencing,
    controlling for legally relevant factors;

    (2) analyze prosecutorial charging patterns, substantial
    assistance motion rates, and plea agreement terms by
    defendant demographics and judicial district;

    (3) recommend guidelines amendments to address identified
    disparities;

    (4) publish all findings and recommendations in publicly
    available reports; and

    (5) provide technical assistance to federal judicial
    districts in implementing equitable sentencing practices.

(c) DATA ACCESS.--The Department of Justice, including all
United States Attorney offices, shall provide the Equity Office
with all data reasonably necessary to carry out its duties under
this section, including charging documents, plea agreements,
substantial assistance motion filings, and sentencing memoranda.

SEC. 8. DRUG COURT AND DIVERSION EXPANSION.

(a) FEDERAL DRUG COURTS.--The Director of the Administrative
Office of the United States Courts shall ensure that drug court
or equivalent diversion programs are available in all 94 federal
judicial districts not later than 3 years after the date of
enactment of this Act.

(b) STATE GRANTS.--There are authorized to be appropriated to
the Department of Justice, for distribution through the Edward
Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program, $500,000,000
for each of fiscal years 2027 through 2031, for the purpose of
expanding state and local drug court and diversion programs.

SEC. 9. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

(a) ANNUAL REPORTS.--Not later than 1 year after the date of
enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the Commission
shall submit to Congress a report that includes--

```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4 (Elimination of Mandatory Minimums)**: Replaces all mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses with statutory maximums, restoring full judicial discretion within those maximums. Retains meaningful maximum penalties (up to 40 years for the most serious offenses) while eliminating the floor that constrains judges.
- **Section 5 (Role-Based Sentencing)**: Directs the USSC to fundamentally restructure drug sentencing guidelines around the defendant's actual role rather than drug quantity, addressing the anomaly whereby couriers receive sentences comparable to organizers.
- **Section 6 (Retroactive Resentencing)**: Creates a right for all individuals sentenced under prior mandatory minimums to petition for resentencing, with appointed counsel and a presumption in favor of resentencing. This addresses the estimated 66,000 current federal drug inmates.
- **Section 7 (Equity Office)**: Institutes permanent racial equity monitoring, requiring data collection and analysis that currently does not exist systematically at the prosecutorial level.
- **Section 10 (Appropriations)**: Funds phase up from $50 million in Year 1 to $700 million in Years 3-5, primarily for drug court expansion ($500 million/year) and resentencing processing.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Act takes effect | 180 days after enactment | N/A |
| USSC begins guidelines revision | 6 months after enactment | USSC |
| Federal drug courts in all districts | 3 years after enactment | Admin. Office of U.S. Courts |
| Revised guidelines take effect | 18 months after enactment | USSC |
| First annual report to Congress | 1 year after enactment | USSC |
| Equity Office operational | 1 year after enactment | USSC |
| First biennial equity assessment | 2 years after enactment | Equity Office |

**Regulatory Authority**: The U.S. Sentencing Commission promulgates revised guidelines. The Department of Justice issues implementation guidance for prosecutors. The Administrative Office of U.S. Courts establishes drug court programs.

**Challenges**:

- **Prosecutorial resistance**: DOJ and U.S. Attorneys may oppose loss of mandatory minimum leverage
- **Volume of resentencing petitions**: Estimated 30,000-50,000 petitions may strain federal courts
- **Political attacks**: Opponents will characterize reform as "letting drug dealers out of prison"

**Refinements**:

- **Priority processing**: Establish triage for resentencing petitions based on time served, age, and original sentence disparity
- **Reentry coordination**: Link resentencing to mandatory reentry planning and support services
- **Outcome tracking**: Require 5-year recidivism tracking for all resentenced individuals

### The EQUAL Act

**Purpose**: To eliminate the remaining federal sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine by establishing equal quantity thresholds, with retroactive application.

**Key Provisions**:

1. Sets crack cocaine quantity triggers at the same levels as powder cocaine (500 grams for 5-year sentence, 5 kilograms for 10-year sentence)
2. Applies retroactively to all individuals currently serving sentences under the prior disparity
3. Directs the USSC to amend guidelines accordingly

**Draft Text**:

```text
119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To eliminate the sentencing disparity between crack cocaine and
powder cocaine offenses.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Eliminating a Quantifiably Unjust
Application of the Law Act of 2026" or the "EQUAL Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) The U.S. Sentencing Commission, the National Institute on
Drug Abuse, the American Medical Association, and the American
Bar Association have all concluded that crack and powder cocaine
are pharmacologically identical and that the sentencing disparity
is not scientifically justified.

(2) The USSC has recommended that Congress eliminate the
crack-powder disparity in reports submitted in 1995, 1997, 2002,
and 2007.

(3) In FY2023, 77.1% of federal crack cocaine defendants were
Black, while only 5.2% were white (USSC, FY2023).

(4) The Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 reduced the crack-to-powder
ratio from 100-to-1 to 18-to-1, but an unjustified disparity
remains.

SEC. 3. EQUAL TREATMENT OF CRACK AND POWDER COCAINE.

(a) IN GENERAL.--Section 401(b)(1) of the Controlled Substances
Act (21 U.S.C. 841(b)(1)) is amended--

    (1) in clipping subparagraph (A)(iii), by striking "280 grams"
    and inserting "5 kilograms"; and

    (2) in subparagraph (B)(iii), by striking "28 grams" and
    inserting "500 grams".

(b) IMPORT AND EXPORT.--Section 1010(b) of the Controlled
Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 960(b)) is amended
to conform with the amendments made by subsection (a).

SEC. 4. RETROACTIVE APPLICATION.

(a) IN GENERAL.--This Act and the amendments made by this Act
shall apply retroactively to all individuals sentenced before
the date of enactment of this Act for offenses involving crack
cocaine.

(b) RESENTENCING.--Any individual serving a sentence for a
crack cocaine offense may file a petition for resentencing under
the amendments made by this Act.

SEC. 5. GUIDELINES CONFORMITY.

Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment of this Act,
the Commission shall amend the Federal Sentencing Guidelines to
reflect the amendments made by this Act.

SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date of enactment.
```

## State Model Legislation

### Model Drug Sentencing Reform Act

**Purpose**: To provide states with a template for eliminating mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses and establishing treatment-based diversion alternatives.

**Adaptability Notes**: States should customize quantity thresholds, diversion program specifics, and funding levels based on their existing sentencing structures, treatment capacity, and budget. States that have already eliminated some mandatory minimums may adopt selected provisions.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "[State] Drug
Sentencing Reform Act of [Year]".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS.

The Legislature finds that:

(a) Mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses have not been
shown to reduce drug use or trafficking;

(b) Drug incarceration costs this state approximately $[amount]
annually;

(c) Racial disparities in drug sentencing are documented and
unjustified; and

(d) Treatment-based alternatives produce better outcomes at
lower cost.

SECTION 3. ELIMINATION OF MANDATORY MINIMUMS FOR DRUG OFFENSES.

(a) All mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses under
[State Criminal Code sections] are hereby repealed.

(b) Courts shall retain full judicial discretion to impose
sentences up to the statutory maximum for each offense category.

SECTION 4. PRE-SENTENCING DIVERSION PROGRAM.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.--Each judicial district shall establish a
pre-sentencing drug diversion program.

(b) ELIGIBILITY.--Any person charged with a drug possession
offense, or a non-violent drug distribution offense where the
person's primary motivation was personal addiction, shall be
eligible for diversion.

(c) PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS.--Diversion programs shall include
substance use disorder assessment, evidence-based treatment,
supervision, and case management.

(d) COMPLETION.--Successful completion of the diversion program
shall result in dismissal of charges and sealing of the record.

SECTION 5. SENTENCING EQUITY REVIEW.

The [State Sentencing Commission / Criminal Justice Committee]
shall conduct an annual review of drug sentencing outcomes by
race, ethnicity, gender, and geographic region, and recommend
legislative changes to address identified disparities.

SECTION 6. APPROPRIATION.

There is appropriated $[amount] from the General Fund for the
implementation of this Act, including diversion program
establishment and expansion of treatment capacity.

SECTION 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on [date].
```

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: U.S. Sentencing Commission (guidelines revision); Department of Justice (prosecutorial policy); Bureau of Prisons (compassionate release, resentencing implementation).

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **Revised Drug Sentencing Guidelines**: USSC promulgates role-based guidelines within 18 months. Requires public notice and comment. Takes effect unless Congress disapproves within 180 days.
2. **Prosecutorial Charging Policy**: Attorney General issues memorandum directing U.S. Attorneys to implement role-based charging consistent with new guidelines. Does not require formal rulemaking.
3. **Resentencing Procedures**: Administrative Office of U.S. Courts issues procedures for resentencing petition processing, appointment of counsel, and timeline management.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Sentencing Review**: Appellate courts review sentences for reasonableness under revised guidelines
- **Equity Office Reporting**: Biennial reports to Congress identify persistent disparities and recommend corrective action
- **DOJ Inspector General**: Audits prosecutorial compliance with charging policies
- **Congressional Oversight**: Annual reporting requirement ensures transparency

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Commerce Clause Authority**: Federal drug sentencing authority rests on the Commerce Clause power to regulate interstate commerce in controlled substances. This authority is well-established and would not be affected by the proposed reforms. *Gonzales v. Raich*, 545 U.S. 1 (2005), confirmed broad federal authority over drug regulation.

**Eighth Amendment Proportionality**: The proposed reforms strengthen Eighth Amendment compliance by eliminating mandatory minimums that produce disproportionate sentences. Current mandatory minimums have been challenged as disproportionate under the Eighth Amendment, though courts have generally upheld them under the deferential *Harmelin v. Michigan*, 501 U.S. 957 (1991), framework. Reform eliminates the need for case-by-case proportionality challenges.

**Separation of Powers**: The directive to the USSC to adopt role-based guidelines operates within the Commission's existing statutory authority under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984. Congressional directives to the USSC are constitutionally permissible under *Mistretta v. United States*, 488 U.S. 361 (1989).

### Preemption

Federal sentencing reform does not preempt state drug sentencing laws. States retain full authority over their own criminal sentencing structures. The model state legislation operates independently of federal reform. No express or implied preemption issues arise.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance with revised sentencing guidelines is ensured through appellate review. The USSC monitors guideline application through its data collection program. The Equity Office provides an additional layer of monitoring. DOJ charging policy compliance is monitored through the Inspector General and Congressional oversight.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| Prosecutorial charge-shifting | Prosecutors could shift cases to state courts or use alternative federal charges (conspiracy, money laundering) to circumvent elimination of drug mandatory minimums | High | Include anti-circumvention provision requiring AG monitoring of charge-shifting patterns; amend conspiracy statutes to align with reformed drug penalties |
| Role classification manipulation | Prosecutors or defendants could game role-based categories to achieve desired sentence levels | Medium | Require presentence investigation reports to independently verify role classification; USSC guidance on role determination criteria |
| Resentencing denial on safety grounds | Government could broadly assert public safety risk to deny resentencing, undermining the presumption | Medium | Define "specific, articulable risk" narrowly; require government to produce evidence beyond conclusory assertions; appellate review of denials |
| State prosecution substitution | Federal authorities could refer cases to state prosecutors in jurisdictions with harsh state penalties, circumventing federal reform | Medium | DOJ policy prohibiting referrals intended to circumvent federal sentencing reform; data tracking of referral patterns |
| Equity Office data obstruction | U.S. Attorney offices could delay or limit data provision to the Equity Office | Medium | Statutory data access mandate with contempt authority; Inspector General audits of compliance; Congressional reporting requirement |
| Sentencing enhancement stacking | Prosecutors could pursue firearms enhancements (18 U.S.C. Section 924(c)) or other non-drug mandatory minimums to maintain severe sentences | High | Extend mandatory minimum reform to include 924(c) reform for drug-related firearms offenses; require proportionality review when enhancements are applied |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| Does not address state sentencing directly | Federal reform covers only ~20% of all drug incarcerations; state systems hold the majority | Federal legislation cannot mandate state sentencing reform; state authority over criminal law | Model state legislation provided; Byrne JAG funding conditioned on state reform adoption; demonstration effects from federal reform |
| Treatment capacity insufficient for expanded diversion | Diversion programs fail without available treatment; Oregon's Measure 110 demonstrated this risk | Decades of underinvestment in substance use disorder treatment infrastructure | Phase diversion expansion with treatment capacity buildup; front-load SAMHSA funding; use telehealth and hub-and-spoke models |
| Resentencing volume may overwhelm courts | 30,000-50,000 petitions could strain federal courts | Large number of individuals sentenced under prior mandatory minimums | Priority triage system; additional temporary judicial resources; expedited processing for elderly and long-serving inmates |
| Racial equity monitoring depends on prosecutorial cooperation | Equity Office effectiveness requires data from U.S. Attorney offices, which may resist transparency | Institutional culture of prosecutorial independence; lack of existing data-sharing infrastructure | Statutory data mandate; Inspector General enforcement; Congressional reporting |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Anti-circumvention amendment**: Add provision requiring the Attorney General to monitor and report annually on patterns of charge-shifting, state referral, and enhancement stacking that may circumvent the intent of sentencing reform. Authorize the Inspector General to investigate suspected circumvention.
2. **Role classification standards**: Direct the USSC to develop detailed commentary and case examples for role classification, with annual data publication on role distribution by district and defendant demographics.
3. **Treatment capacity guarantee**: Condition full implementation of diversion expansion on certification by SAMHSA that treatment capacity in each district meets projected demand. Provide emergency funding authority for capacity shortfalls.
4. **Court capacity support**: Authorize temporary judicial appointments or magistrate judge assignments for resentencing proceedings. Establish dedicated resentencing dockets in high-volume districts.
5. **Sunset and review**: Require comprehensive review of all provisions at Year 5 and Year 10, with GAO evaluation of costs, savings, public safety outcomes, and equity metrics.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

The Drug Sentencing Reform and Equity Act should include a mandatory 5-year comprehensive review by the GAO, with a report to Congress evaluating:

- Public safety outcomes (recidivism rates, crime trends)
- Fiscal impact (incarceration savings vs. program costs)
- Racial equity outcomes (disparity metrics)
- Resentencing outcomes (number processed, sentence reductions, recidivism)
- Drug court and diversion outcomes (completion rates, cost-effectiveness)

The EQUAL Act does not require a sunset clause, as it corrects a permanent statutory error.
