# Pharmaceutical Industry

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of the pharmaceutical industry's role in American drug policy, public health outcomes, and the opioid crisis. It examines how industry practices, regulatory failures, and structural incentives have shaped drug development, pricing, marketing, and accountability in the United States.

## Overview

The U.S. pharmaceutical industry generates over $600 billion in annual domestic revenue and employs approximately 900,000 workers, making it one of the most economically significant sectors in the American economy. It has produced transformative medical advances -- from antibiotics to mRNA vaccines -- that have saved millions of lives. Yet the industry has also been responsible for one of the worst public health catastrophes in American history: the opioid epidemic, which has killed more than 700,000 Americans since 1999 and was driven in large part by the aggressive and deceptive marketing of prescription painkillers by Purdue Pharma and other manufacturers.

Beyond the opioid crisis, the pharmaceutical industry raises fundamental questions about the balance between innovation incentives and public health. Americans pay the highest drug prices in the world, with per-capita pharmaceutical spending of $1,432 in 2022 compared to an OECD average of $594. The industry spends more on marketing and administration than on research and development. Patent manipulation strategies extend monopoly pricing for decades beyond original patent terms. The FDA approval process has faced persistent concerns about regulatory capture, accelerated approval controversies, and inadequate post-market surveillance. And Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) -- the intermediaries that negotiate drug prices -- have consolidated into three firms controlling 80% of the market, creating opaque pricing structures that often fail to benefit patients.

This analysis examines the pharmaceutical industry's structure, practices, regulatory environment, and political influence, and proposes evidence-based reforms to align industry incentives with public health outcomes while preserving genuine innovation.
