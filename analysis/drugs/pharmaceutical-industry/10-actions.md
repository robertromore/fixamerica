# Pharmaceutical Industry: What You Can Do

Pharmaceutical industry reform affects every American who takes prescription medication, pays health insurance premiums, or has been touched by the opioid crisis. While the industry's political influence is enormous -- $374 million in annual lobbying -- drug pricing reform consistently polls at 80-90% public support across party lines, making this one of the most promising areas for citizen advocacy to produce concrete results.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- Subscribe to *STAT News* daily briefing for pharmaceutical industry and FDA coverage (<https://www.statnews.com/signup/>)
- Follow Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) Health Tracking Polls for public opinion data on drug pricing (<https://www.kff.org/>)
- Read the FTC's PBM investigation reports as they are released (<https://www.ftc.gov/reports>)
- Check Open Payments (<https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/>) to see what pharmaceutical companies pay your physicians

### Reduce Your Personal Drug Costs

- Use GoodRx (<https://www.goodrx.com/>) or RxSaver (<https://www.rxsaver.com/>) to compare pharmacy prices before filling prescriptions
- Ask your physician about generic alternatives; generics cost 80-85% less than brand-name drugs and are therapeutically equivalent
- Check manufacturer patient assistance programs for expensive branded drugs (NeedyMeds: <https://www.needymeds.org/>)
- Consider Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company (<https://costplusdrugs.com/>) for transparent pricing on generic medications
- If eligible for Medicare, verify that your Part D plan covers your medications at the lowest cost tier
- Ask your pharmacist about the $35/month insulin copay cap if you are a Medicare beneficiary

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact Your Representatives**: Call or write your U.S. Senators and Representative about drug pricing reform, PBM transparency, and pharmaceutical accountability. These issues have bipartisan support and concrete pending legislation
- **Submit Public Comments**: When the FDA, FTC, or CMS propose rules related to drug pricing, PBM regulation, or pharmaceutical marketing, submit public comments through Regulations.gov (<https://www.regulations.gov/>)
- **Write Letters to the Editor**: Share your experience with drug costs in your local newspaper; personal stories are among the most effective advocacy tools
- **Share Information**: Post comparative drug pricing data (U.S. vs. other countries) on social media; public awareness of the price gap drives political action

---

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- Form a local drug pricing advocacy group through Patients for Affordable Drugs (<https://www.patientsforaffordabledrugs.org/>)
- Organize community forums on drug pricing with your local health department, community health center, or faith organization
- Partner with independent pharmacies in your community to support state-level PBM reform legislation
- If your community was affected by the opioid crisis, engage with local opioid settlement fund allocation processes to ensure funds are directed to evidence-based treatment and prevention

### Build Coalitions

- Connect drug pricing advocacy with employer groups, as rising pharmaceutical costs drive insurance premium increases for businesses and workers
- Work with senior citizen organizations (AARP chapters, senior centers) on Medicare drug pricing and Part D benefit issues
- Engage faith communities, which have been active in opioid accountability and pharmaceutical industry ethics

## Political Actions

### Contact Elected Officials

**When to Contact**:

- When drug pricing or PBM transparency legislation is pending in committee (watch STAT News and KFF for updates)
- During annual budget and appropriations season (October-December) regarding FDA funding independence
- When pharmaceutical companies announce major price increases (typically January and July)
- When your state legislature considers PBM reform or drug pricing transparency bills

**What to Say - Template Email**:

```
Subject: Support Drug Pricing Reform and PBM Transparency

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

I am a constituent from [City, State], and I am writing to urge you to support pharmaceutical industry reform, including expanded Medicare drug price negotiation, PBM transparency requirements, and patent reform to increase generic competition.

Americans pay 2-3 times more for prescription drugs than people in other developed countries. In my own experience, [brief personal example of drug costs, if applicable]. Pharmaceutical companies spent $374 million lobbying Congress in 2023 alone -- more than any other industry. This spending has blocked reforms that have overwhelming public support.

I specifically ask that you:
1. Support expanding the Inflation Reduction Act's Medicare drug negotiation provisions
2. Co-sponsor PBM transparency and fiduciary duty legislation
3. Support patent reform to prevent evergreening and pay-for-delay practices

Thank you for your service and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say - Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City]. I'm calling about prescription drug pricing. I'd like the [Representative/Senator] to support expanding Medicare drug price negotiation and requiring PBM transparency. Americans pay the highest drug prices in the world, and pharmaceutical companies spend more on lobbying than any other industry. Can you please note my position?"
```

### Support Legislation

Current or proposed legislation to support:

- **Inflation Reduction Act expansion**: Bills to remove numerical limits on Medicare drug negotiation and extend authority to commercial insurance -- contact Senate Finance and House Energy & Commerce committee members
- **PBM transparency legislation**: Bipartisan bills requiring PBM fiduciary duty and rebate pass-through -- contact your Senators and Representative directly
- **STOP Evergreening Act**: Legislation to limit pharmaceutical patent manipulation -- contact Senate and House Judiciary committee members
- **State-level PBM reform**: 25+ states have enacted PBM transparency laws; check your state legislature for pending bills

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "Do you support expanding Medicare's authority to negotiate drug prices beyond the current 10 drugs?"
2. "Will you support requiring PBMs to pass rebates through to patients at the point of sale?"
3. "What is your position on criminal liability for pharmaceutical executives who engage in fraud?"
4. "Do you accept campaign contributions from pharmaceutical companies and their PACs?"

**Voting Considerations**:

- Check candidates' positions on drug pricing reform through Patients for Affordable Drugs' congressional scorecard
- Review candidates' pharmaceutical industry campaign contributions on OpenSecrets (<https://www.opensecrets.org/>)
- Key committees for pharmaceutical policy: Senate Finance, Senate HELP, House Energy & Commerce, House Judiciary

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing pharmaceutical reform with others, emphasize:

1. **The Price Gap**: Americans pay 2-3 times more for the same drugs than people in other developed countries. Per-capita pharmaceutical spending in the U.S. was $1,432 in 2022 versus an OECD average of $594 (OECD, 2023)
2. **Taxpayer-Funded Innovation**: NIH-funded research contributed to every one of the 210 drugs approved from 2010-2016. Taxpayers fund the basic research; corporations reap the profits
3. **Marketing Over Research**: The industry spends $29.9 billion annually on U.S. marketing and promotion while claiming high prices are needed for innovation (JAMA, 2023)
4. **Bipartisan Support**: Drug pricing reform has 80-90% public support across party lines -- this is not a partisan issue (KFF, 2023)

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "High prices are needed to fund innovation" | Major pharma companies spend more on stock buybacks and dividends than R&D; NIH funds the basic research pipeline | House Oversight Committee, 2021; Galkina Cleary, *PNAS*, 2018 |
| "Price controls would eliminate new drugs" | CBO estimates IRA negotiation reduces new drugs by ~1% over 30 years; countries with price regulation maintain active pharma sectors | CBO, 2022; OECD data |
| "The free market sets drug prices" | Pharmaceutical pricing involves government-granted patent monopolies, taxpayer-funded research, and opaque PBM intermediaries -- it is not a free market | Multiple sources |
| "PBMs lower drug costs" | FTC found PBMs' vertically integrated model creates "perverse incentives" that may not serve patients | FTC Interim Report, 2024 |
| "The opioid crisis was caused by individual bad choices" | Internal documents from Purdue Pharma and other companies demonstrate systematic, corporate-directed deception about addiction risks | DOJ, 2020; Keefe, *Empire of Pain*, 2021 |
