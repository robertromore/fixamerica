# Pharmaceutical Industry: Legislation

## Overview

Pharmaceutical industry reform requires a multi-track legislative approach. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 broke the decades-long barrier to Medicare drug price negotiation, but its provisions cover only a fraction of the market. Comprehensive reform requires federal legislation addressing pricing authority, patent system abuse, FDA independence, PBM transparency, marketing practices, and executive accountability. State-level legislation can complement federal action, particularly in areas such as PBM regulation, drug pricing transparency, and consumer protection. This section provides draft text for the Pharmaceutical Accountability and Transparency Act, a state model PBM reform act, and a regulatory implementation framework.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for pharmaceutical industry reform.* All proposed reforms operate within existing Congressional authority under the Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8), the Spending Clause (for Medicare/Medicaid reforms), and the Patent Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 8). However, some marketing restrictions may face First Amendment scrutiny under commercial speech doctrine.

119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To establish comprehensive pharmaceutical industry reform, including
expanded drug price negotiation, patent reform, FDA independence,
PBM transparency, marketing restrictions, and executive accountability.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Pharmaceutical Accountability and
Transparency Act of 2027".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) According to the OECD (2023), Americans pay $1,432 per capita
    annually for prescription drugs, compared to an OECD average
    of $594 -- more than double the average of other developed
    nations.

(2) The pharmaceutical and health products industry spent $374
    million on federal lobbying in 2023, more than any other
    industry sector (OpenSecrets, 2024).

(3) The Food and Drug Administration derives approximately 65
    percent of its drug review budget from industry user fees
    (FDA, FY2024), creating a structural conflict of interest.

(4) The top three Pharmacy Benefit Managers control approximately
    80 percent of the market and have been found by the Federal
    Trade Commission to maintain "perverse incentives" that may
    not serve patients (FTC, 2024).

(5) Pharmaceutical companies have engaged in systematic marketing
    fraud that contributed to the opioid epidemic, resulting in
    more than 700,000 deaths since 1999 and more than $50 billion
    in litigation settlements.

(6) Pharmaceutical patent manipulation strategies, including
    evergreening and pay-for-delay settlements, delay generic
    competition and cost American consumers billions of dollars
    annually.

(3) PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGER.--The term "pharmacy benefit
    manager" means any person or entity that, pursuant to a
    contract or under an arrangement with a health plan,
    manages prescription drug benefits.

(4) MAXIMUM FAIR PRICE.--The term "maximum fair price" means
    the price determined through the negotiation process
    established under section 4.

(5) FIDUCIARY DUTY.--The term "fiduciary duty" means the
    legal obligation to act in the best interest of the plan
    sponsor and its enrollees.

```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Title I (Pricing)**: Expands the IRA's breakthrough negotiation authority to all drugs without generic competition, establishes international reference pricing as a negotiation ceiling, and extends negotiated prices to all payers (not just Medicare)
- **Title II (Patents)**: Caps Orange Book patent listings at 20, prohibits pay-for-delay with $10 million minimum penalties, and expedites USPTO review of pharmaceutical patents
- **Title III (FDA)**: Transitions FDA to Congressional funding over 10 years, creates a 2-year revolving door cooling-off period, and establishes an independent Office of Drug Safety
- **Title IV (PBMs)**: Imposes fiduciary duty, requires 100% rebate pass-through to patients, and mandates transparency
- **Title V (Marketing)**: Creates 3-year cooling-off period for DTC advertising of newly approved drugs
- **Title VI (Accountability)**: Establishes felony criminal liability for executives who authorize marketing fraud; requires disgorgement of compensation; strengthens whistleblower protections

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Act signed into law | Year 0 | President |
| Initial regulations proposed | 180 days after enactment | HHS, FTC, FDA |
| Drug Pricing Review Board established | 1 year after enactment | HHS |
| PBM fiduciary duty and transparency effective | 1 year after enactment | PBMs / FTC |
| DTC cooling-off period effective | 180 days after enactment | FDA |
| Expanded drug negotiation begins | Plan year 2029 | CMS |
| FDA funding transition begins | FY2028 | Congress / FDA |
| All-payer maximum fair price effective | Plan year 2031 | CMS / HHS |
| FDA funding transition complete | FY2037 | Congress / FDA |

**Regulatory Authority**: HHS (primary implementation); FTC (PBM enforcement, antitrust); FDA (marketing restrictions, drug safety); DOJ (criminal enforcement); USPTO (patent reform).

**Challenges**:

- **Constitutional litigation**: Industry will challenge negotiation expansion under Takings Clause and First Amendment (DTC restrictions); severability clause preserves other provisions
- **Industry lobbying**: $374 million annual lobbying budget will be deployed against passage; bipartisan framing and public support (80-90%) are counterweights
- **Implementation complexity**: All-payer pricing, FDA funding transition, and PBM restructuring require multi-year phased implementation

**Refinements**:

- **Innovation safeguards**: Consider premium pricing tiers for drugs demonstrating substantial clinical advance over existing therapies, modeled on Germany's benefit assessment system
- **Small biotech carve-out**: Consider modified patent provisions for companies below a revenue threshold to avoid discouraging startup innovation
- **Transition assistance**: Provide technical assistance to PBMs during fiduciary duty transition period

## State Model Legislation

### Model PBM Transparency and Accountability Act

**Purpose**: To require pharmacy benefit managers operating in the state to act as fiduciaries, disclose rebate and pricing information, and pass through manufacturer rebates to patients at the point of sale.

**Adaptability Notes**: States should customize dollar thresholds, enforcement agencies (insurance commissioner, attorney general), and definitions to align with existing state insurance law. States with existing PBM registration requirements should integrate these provisions into existing frameworks.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "[State] PBM
Transparency and Accountability Act of [Year]".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS.

The Legislature finds that:

(1) Pharmacy benefit managers control access to prescription
    drugs for approximately 80 percent of Americans through
    three dominant firms.

(2) PBM practices including spread pricing, rebate retention,
    and pharmacy steering have been found by the Federal Trade
    Commission to create perverse incentives that may harm
    patients and plan sponsors.

(3) Independent pharmacies in this State face declining
    reimbursement rates that threaten their viability and
    patient access to pharmacy services.

SECTION 3. DEFINITIONS.

(a) "Pharmacy benefit manager" means any entity that contracts
    with pharmacies, negotiates with drug manufacturers, or
    administers prescription drug benefits on behalf of a
    health plan operating in this State.

(b) "Spread pricing" means the practice of charging a health
    plan a price for a prescription drug that differs from the
    amount paid to the dispensing pharmacy.

SECTION 4. FIDUCIARY DUTY.

(a) Every pharmacy benefit manager operating in this State
    shall owe a fiduciary duty to the health plan and enrollees
    it serves.

(b) A PBM shall pass through to enrollees at the point of sale
    100 percent of manufacturer rebates, discounts, and fees
    attributable to the enrollee's prescription.

(c) Spread pricing is prohibited.

SECTION 5. TRANSPARENCY.

(a) Each PBM shall file annually with the [Insurance
    Commissioner/Attorney General] a report disclosing--
    (1) aggregate rebates received from manufacturers;
    (2) aggregate rebates passed through to plan sponsors;
    (3) aggregate pharmacy reimbursement amounts; and
    (4) revenue from affiliated pharmacy operations.

SECTION 6. ENFORCEMENT.

(a) The [Insurance Commissioner/Attorney General] shall enforce
    this Act.

(b) Violations are subject to civil penalties of up to $10,000
    per violation per day.

(c) A private right of action is available to plan sponsors
    and enrollees harmed by PBM violations.

SECTION 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on [date], or 180 days after
enactment, whichever is later.
```

---

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), with delegated authority to CMS, FDA, and coordination with FTC and DOJ.

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **Drug Pricing Negotiation Rules**: CMS must publish rules governing the expanded negotiation process, international reference pricing methodology, and all-payer application (statutory deadline: 12 months after enactment)
2. **PBM Fiduciary Standards**: HHS and FTC jointly publish rules defining fiduciary obligations, rebate pass-through requirements, and transparency reporting formats (statutory deadline: 12 months after enactment)
3. **DTC Advertising Cooling-Off**: FDA publishes rules defining prohibited advertising during the 3-year cooling-off period and permitted public health communications (statutory deadline: 180 days after enactment)
4. **Patent Listing Standards**: USPTO publishes revised rules for Orange Book patent listing under the 20-patent cap (statutory deadline: 12 months after enactment)

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Civil Penalties**: PBM violations: up to $10,000 per violation per day; patent listing violations: delisting and potential antitrust referral; DTC violations: up to $500,000 per occurrence
- **Administrative Actions**: FDA warning letters, consent decrees, and product seizure for marketing violations; CMS sanctions for non-compliance with pricing requirements
- **Private Right of Action**: Plan sponsors and enrollees may bring suits against PBMs for fiduciary duty violations; generic manufacturers may challenge improper patent listings through expedited inter partes review
- **Criminal Penalties**: Up to 10 years imprisonment and $1 million fine for pharmaceutical executives who knowingly authorize marketing fraud or concealment of safety data

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Commerce Clause Authority**: Drug pricing regulation is well within Congressional Commerce Clause authority. Pharmaceutical products move in interstate and international commerce, and the pricing of prescription drugs directly affects interstate markets. The Supreme Court has upheld far more attenuated exercises of Commerce Clause authority in cases such as *Gonzales v. Raich*, 545 U.S. 1 (2005).

**Takings Clause**: The pharmaceutical industry has challenged IRA negotiation provisions as unconstitutional "takings." However, price regulation of products sold in government-funded programs (Medicare, Medicaid) is a condition of voluntary participation, not a taking of property. Manufacturers remain free to exit government programs. The Supreme Court upheld Medicaid drug rebate requirements in analogous contexts.

**First Amendment (DTC Advertising)**: Pharmaceutical advertising receives intermediate-level commercial speech protection under *Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission*, 447 U.S. 557 (1980). The 3-year cooling-off period serves the substantial government interest in protecting public health by allowing clinical experience to accumulate before mass marketing. The restriction is narrowly tailored (time-limited, not a permanent ban) and leaves open alternative channels of communication (professional medical communications, unbranded disease awareness).

### Preemption

Federal PBM transparency and fiduciary duty requirements preempt less protective state laws but do not preempt state laws that provide greater protection to consumers. States retain authority to enact additional consumer protection, drug pricing transparency, and PBM regulation requirements.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance is ensured through a combination of mandatory reporting (PBMs, manufacturers), annual audits (HHS Inspector General), and tiered penalties that escalate with the severity and duration of violations. The DOJ Pharmaceutical Fraud Task Force provides dedicated enforcement resources for criminal provisions.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| International reference pricing manipulation | Manufacturers could negotiate artificially high prices in reference countries to raise the U.S. ceiling | High | Include anti-manipulation provisions; use volume-weighted average prices; adjust reference basket periodically |
| Patent workarounds beyond Orange Book | Manufacturers could rely on trade secret protection or non-Orange Book patent strategies to extend exclusivity | Medium | Extend patent reform to cover all exclusivity-extending strategies, including REMS abuse and citizen petition delays |
| PBM corporate restructuring | PBMs could restructure to move rebate revenue to affiliates not covered by fiduciary duty | High | Define PBM broadly to include affiliates; require consolidated reporting across vertically integrated entities |
| DTC advertising via digital/social media | Manufacturers could shift advertising to channels not explicitly covered by broadcast advertising restrictions | Medium | Draft DTC restrictions to cover all media including digital, social media, search engine marketing, and influencer partnerships |
| Nominal compliance with transparency | PBMs or manufacturers could technically comply with disclosure requirements while obscuring meaningful information through complexity | Medium | Require standardized reporting formats; authorize HHS to prescribe specific data fields and calculation methodologies |
| Executive liability evasion through delegation | Executives could insulate themselves by delegating fraud-related decisions to subordinates | Medium | Include "responsible corporate officer" doctrine; liability extends to those with authority to prevent violations regardless of actual knowledge |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| All-payer pricing delayed until 2031 | Commercially insured patients (155 million) do not benefit from negotiated prices for 4+ years | Political compromise to phase in reforms | Accelerate all-payer timeline if initial implementation succeeds; states can enact complementary measures |
| Limited to drugs without generic competition | Does not address high-priced generics or drugs with generic competition but insufficient price reduction | Negotiation designed for monopoly pricing; generic markets assumed to be competitive | Separate legislation to address generic drug pricing; FTC enforcement against generic price fixing |
| No structural PBM breakup | Vertical integration remains; behavioral rules may be insufficient to eliminate conflicts | Political feasibility of structural reform is lower than behavioral regulation | Include FTC study requirement; sunset behavioral rules if structural reform is enacted |
| FDA funding transition takes 10 years | Conflict of interest persists during transition | Congressional appropriations process is slow; abrupt transition could disrupt FDA operations | Accelerate transition if appropriations are available; ensure interim safeguards (enhanced disclosure, firewall between fee negotiations and review decisions) |
| Criminal liability standard requires "knowing" participation | Executives may claim ignorance of fraud occurring within their organizations | Due process requirements; difficulty of proving individual knowledge | "Responsible corporate officer" doctrine reduces knowledge requirement for senior officials with supervisory authority |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Anti-manipulation amendment**: Add provision within 2 years requiring HHS to evaluate reference country pricing for evidence of manufacturer manipulation and to exclude manipulated prices from reference calculations
2. **Digital advertising clarification**: Within 1 year, FDA issues guidance defining DTC advertising to encompass digital, social media, and influencer marketing, and establishing enforcement standards for online pharmaceutical promotion
3. **PBM structural review**: Within 3 years, FTC completes study of whether behavioral regulations are sufficient or structural separation of PBM, insurance, and pharmacy functions is necessary; Congress acts on findings within 2 years of study completion
4. **Generic pricing enforcement**: Within 2 years, enact companion legislation authorizing FTC to investigate and prosecute generic drug price manipulation, including supply restriction and market allocation

### Sunset and Review Provisions

This Act includes the following review requirements:

- **5-year comprehensive review**: GAO conducts comprehensive evaluation of Act's implementation and impact on drug prices, patient access, innovation, and industry structure; findings reported to Congress
- **Drug Pricing Review Board reauthorization**: Board is authorized for 10 years; must be reauthorized with Congressional review of performance
- **10-year sunset on DTC cooling-off period**: Provision expires after 10 years unless reauthorized, allowing evaluation of impact on prescribing patterns and public health
