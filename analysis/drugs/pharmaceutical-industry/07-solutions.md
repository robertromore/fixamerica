# Pharmaceutical Industry: Solutions

Pharmaceutical industry reform requires a multi-faceted approach that aims to reduce drug prices to levels comparable with other developed nations, strengthen FDA independence and oversight, close patent system loopholes, increase transparency across the drug supply chain, and establish meaningful accountability for corporate misconduct -- all while preserving financial incentives for genuine therapeutic innovation.

---

## Reform Framework

### Guiding Principles

- Evidence-based: Reforms should be grounded in empirical evidence about what works, drawing on international experience and domestic data
- Innovation-preserving: Maintain meaningful incentives for breakthrough drug development while eliminating rewards for monopoly manipulation
- Patient-centered: The primary metric of success is patient access to safe, effective, affordable medications
- Transparent: Markets function best with full information; opacity serves incumbents at the expense of patients, prescribers, and payers
- Enforceable: Reforms without enforcement mechanisms are ineffective; accountability requires meaningful penalties including criminal liability

### Theory of Change

The current pharmaceutical system is sustained by a self-reinforcing cycle of monopoly profits, political influence, and regulatory capture. Breaking this cycle requires simultaneous action on multiple fronts: price regulation reduces the excess profits that fund lobbying; FDA independence reduces regulatory capture; patent reform eliminates monopoly extension strategies; and transparency requirements enable informed decision-making by patients, prescribers, and policymakers. No single reform is sufficient; the reinforcing nature of the system requires comprehensive action.

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Expand Medicare Drug Price Negotiation

**Description**: Build on the Inflation Reduction Act by expanding Medicare's negotiation authority to cover all drugs without generic or biosimilar competition -- not just the 10 (rising to 20) drugs currently eligible. Extend negotiation authority to Medicaid and commercial insurance markets. Establish a public benchmark based on the average price paid by other OECD nations (an "international reference pricing" standard).

**Evidence Base**: The IRA's negotiation provisions are estimated to save $98.5 billion over 10 years (CBO, 2022). International reference pricing systems are used by Canada (Patented Medicine Prices Review Board), Germany (IQWiG), the UK (NICE), and Australia (PBAC), all of which achieve significantly lower drug prices while maintaining active pharmaceutical sectors. A RAND Corporation study found that U.S. prices for brand-name drugs averaged 2.78 times prices in 33 OECD comparison countries (Mulcahy et al., RAND, 2021).

**Implementation**: Amend the IRA to remove numerical caps on negotiation-eligible drugs and extend authority to all payers. Establish an independent Drug Pricing Review Board within HHS modeled on international comparators.

**Cost/Resources**: Administrative costs of $150-250 million annually for the pricing review board. Net savings estimated at $450-600 billion over 10 years (extrapolating CBO models to broader scope).

**Timeline**: Legislation in Year 1; expanded negotiations in Years 2-3; full implementation by Year 5.

**Challenges**: Pharmaceutical industry litigation (IRA provisions already face multiple lawsuits); constitutional arguments regarding "takings" and compelled transactions; potential modest reduction in new drug development (CBO estimates ~1% over 30 years under IRA; broader negotiation could be higher).

**Impact Metrics**: Average branded drug price reduction; patient out-of-pocket spending; medication adherence rates; number of drugs subject to negotiation.

---

### Solution 2: Patent Reform to End Monopoly Manipulation

**Description**: Enact comprehensive patent reform targeting pharmaceutical-specific abuses: limit the number of patents that can be listed in the FDA's Orange Book per drug product; prohibit pay-for-delay settlements; create an expedited inter partes review process at the USPTO for pharmaceutical patent challenges; shorten regulatory exclusivity periods for incremental modifications; and strengthen enforcement of the FTC's authority over anticompetitive patent strategies.

**Evidence Base**: The I-MAK study found that the average top-selling drug is protected by 74 patent applications (2023). AbbVie's Humira patent thicket (150+ patents) delayed biosimilar competition for years beyond the original patent expiration, costing patients and insurers an estimated $114 billion (I-MAK, 2023). The FTC estimated pay-for-delay settlements cost consumers $3.5 billion annually (FTC, 2010).

**Implementation**: Legislative action to amend the Hatch-Waxman Act and Patent Act; enhanced USPTO examination standards; FTC enforcement guidance.

**Cost/Resources**: Minimal federal cost; potentially self-funded through USPTO fee adjustments. Savings from increased generic/biosimilar competition estimated at $100+ billion over 10 years.

**Timeline**: Legislation in Year 1-2; patent examination reform in Year 2-3; full impact on generic competition in Years 3-7.

**Challenges**: Opposition from patent attorney community and brand manufacturers; potential trade implications through international IP agreements; need to balance against legitimate patent rights.

**Impact Metrics**: Time to generic/biosimilar entry after original patent expiry; number of pay-for-delay settlements; average number of patents per drug product; generic drug price reductions.

---

### Solution 3: FDA Independence and Oversight Reform

**Description**: Transition FDA drug review funding from industry user fees to Congressional appropriations over a 10-year period, eliminating the structural conflict of interest created by PDUFA. Strengthen post-market surveillance authority, including mandatory post-market study completion with enforceable penalties. Establish a two-year cooling-off period before FDA officials can take pharmaceutical industry positions. Create an independent Office of Drug Safety within the FDA with authority to initiate safety reviews and recommend withdrawals without requiring approval from the review division that approved the drug.

**Evidence Base**: Studies have found that PDUFA-era approvals are associated with increased rates of post-market safety withdrawals (Downing et al., *JAMA Internal Medicine*, 2017). As of 2023, approximately 45% of required post-market study commitments remained incomplete (FDA, 2023). Nine of fifteen recent FDA commissioners subsequently joined pharmaceutical company boards (Piller, *Science*, 2018).

**Implementation**: Phase in Congressional funding increases while reducing user fee dependence; enact revolving door restrictions; create Office of Drug Safety through statutory amendment.

**Cost/Resources**: Transitioning full drug review funding to appropriations would require approximately $1.3 billion annually in new Congressional appropriations. This represents 0.02% of the federal budget and would be offset by savings from fewer safety-related drug withdrawals and reduced healthcare costs from adverse drug events.

**Timeline**: Begin funding transition in Year 1; complete transition over 10 years; revolving door and Office of Drug Safety provisions effective in Year 2.

**Challenges**: Congressional reluctance to increase appropriations; industry opposition to losing influence through user fee negotiations; need to maintain review timelines during transition.

**Impact Metrics**: Post-market study completion rates; time to safety signal response; number of FDA officials transitioning to industry within 5 years; drug withdrawal rates.

---

### Solution 4: PBM Transparency and Fiduciary Duty

**Description**: Require PBMs to operate as fiduciaries for the plans and patients they serve, legally obligated to act in their clients' best interests. Mandate disclosure of all rebate amounts, spread pricing margins, and affiliated pharmacy arrangements. Require pass-through of manufacturer rebates to patients at the point of sale. Prohibit PBMs from steering patients to affiliated pharmacies when independent pharmacies offer comparable or lower-cost options. Authorize the FTC to establish fair competition rules for vertically integrated PBM-insurer-pharmacy entities.

**Evidence Base**: The FTC's July 2024 interim report documented that PBMs' vertically integrated model creates "perverse incentives" not serving patients. State-level PBM transparency laws (enacted in 25+ states as of 2024) have revealed spread pricing margins as high as 30% on some medications (NASHP, 2024). Point-of-sale rebate pass-through in Medicare Part D (mandated starting 2024) is estimated to reduce out-of-pocket costs for beneficiaries by $7.1 billion over 10 years (CMS, 2023).

**Implementation**: Federal legislation establishing fiduciary duties and transparency requirements; FTC rulemaking for vertical integration standards; extension of state PBM reforms to federal employees and Medicare.

**Cost/Resources**: Regulatory costs estimated at $50-100 million annually. Net savings from reduced opaque pricing estimated at $30-50 billion over 10 years.

**Timeline**: Legislation in Year 1; FTC rulemaking in Years 2-3; full implementation in Year 3.

**Challenges**: PBM industry opposition; complexity of disentangling vertically integrated supply chains; potential for PBMs to restructure operations to circumvent transparency requirements.

**Impact Metrics**: Patient out-of-pocket costs; independent pharmacy closures; PBM rebate pass-through rates; FTC enforcement actions.

### Solution 5: Marketing Reform

**Description**: Ban or substantially restrict direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical advertising, consistent with the practice of virtually every other developed nation. Require a "cooling-off period" of 3 years after a new drug approval before DTC advertising is permitted, allowing clinical experience to accumulate. Strengthen restrictions on pharmaceutical detailing to physicians, including mandatory disclosure and limiting the value of gifts, meals, and consulting arrangements. Require that all continuing medical education be funded independently of pharmaceutical companies.

**Evidence Base**: The United States and New Zealand are the only developed countries permitting broadcast DTC pharmaceutical advertising. DTC spending grew from $791 million (1996) to $6.58 billion (2022). A 2005 FDA survey found that 65% of physicians felt DTC ads led patients to overestimate drug effectiveness. Studies show that physician prescribing is influenced by industry payments even when physicians believe it is not (DeJong et al., *JAMA Internal Medicine*, 2016).

**Implementation**: FTC and FDA rulemaking for DTC advertising restrictions; legislative amendment to FDCA for cooling-off period; expanded Sunshine Act requirements; independent CME funding mandate.

**Cost/Resources**: Minimal government cost. Would reduce pharmaceutical company marketing expenditures of $29.9 billion annually, potentially redirecting resources toward R&D or price reductions.

**Timeline**: Cooling-off period enacted in Year 1; DTC restrictions phased in over Years 2-5; CME independence requirements in Year 3.

**Challenges**: First Amendment considerations (commercial speech protections); industry litigation; physician and medical society resistance to CME funding changes.

**Impact Metrics**: DTC advertising spending; prescription rates for newly approved drugs; physician-industry payment amounts (Open Payments data); patient-driven vs. clinician-driven prescribing ratios.

---

### Solution 6: Pharmaceutical Executive Accountability

**Description**: Establish criminal liability for pharmaceutical company executives who knowingly authorize or participate in fraudulent marketing, concealment of safety data, or other practices that endanger public health. Create a "responsible corporate officer" doctrine specific to pharmaceutical regulation, similar to the Park doctrine in food safety. Strengthen whistleblower protections and financial incentives for employees who report pharmaceutical fraud. Require disgorgement of personal profits derived from corporate misconduct.

**Evidence Base**: No Sackler family member faced criminal prosecution despite internal documents showing personal direction of deceptive OxyContin marketing that contributed to more than 700,000 opioid overdose deaths. The 2007 Purdue guilty plea resulted in misdemeanor charges for three executives, each of whom paid fines and performed community service. By contrast, the Insys Therapeutics case (2020) showed that criminal prosecution is possible: founder John Kapoor received a 66-month sentence for RICO conspiracy in a fentanyl spray bribery scheme.

**Implementation**: Amend the FDCA to strengthen criminal provisions; establish DOJ pharmaceutical fraud task force; expand qui tam provisions for pharmaceutical whistleblowers.

**Cost/Resources**: DOJ task force estimated at $75-150 million annually. Expected to be self-funded through fines, disgorgement, and reduced healthcare costs from deterred misconduct.

**Timeline**: Legislation in Year 1; DOJ task force operational in Year 2; first prosecutions in Years 2-4.

**Challenges**: Due process requirements; difficulty proving individual executive knowledge and intent; industry opposition; potential for overly aggressive enforcement chilling legitimate business decisions.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of pharmaceutical fraud prosecutions; whistleblower reports filed; executive turnover following enforcement actions; recidivism rates for sanctioned companies.

---

### Solution 7: Public Option Drug Manufacturing

**Description**: Establish a public pharmaceutical manufacturing capacity for essential generic drugs, particularly those experiencing shortages or whose prices remain unreasonably high despite generic competition. Authorize the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) or a new federal entity to manufacture or contract for the manufacture of off-patent drugs when market failures result in shortages or excessive pricing.

**Evidence Base**: The FDA tracked 301 active drug shortages in 2023, driven by low-margin generic manufacturing and quality control failures. Civica Rx, a nonprofit generic drug manufacturer founded in 2018 by a consortium of health systems, has successfully produced essential generics at dramatically lower costs, demonstrating the feasibility of non-profit manufacturing. Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drug Company has similarly demonstrated alternative pricing models.

**Implementation**: Congressional authorization and initial appropriation; partner with existing contract manufacturing organizations; begin with the most critical shortage drugs and those with unjustifiable generic pricing.

**Cost/Resources**: Initial capital investment of $1-2 billion; ongoing operational costs offset by drug sales and savings to federal healthcare programs.

**Timeline**: Authorization in Year 1; first facility operational in Year 3; production of 20-50 essential drugs by Year 5.

**Challenges**: Industry opposition; manufacturing quality requirements; competition with existing generic manufacturers; potential trade objections from pharmaceutical industry.

**Impact Metrics**: Drug shortages resolved; price reductions for manufactured drugs; federal healthcare program savings; supply chain resilience metrics.

## International Models

### United Kingdom: NICE Value Assessment

**Description**: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) evaluates drugs based on clinical and cost-effectiveness, using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) and willingness-to-pay thresholds to determine whether the National Health Service should cover a drug at its proposed price.

**Results**: UK drug prices average 38% of U.S. levels. NICE has successfully negotiated significant price reductions, though some drugs are delayed or restricted. The UK pharmaceutical sector remains one of Europe's largest, with strong R&D investment.

**Applicability to U.S.**: A U.S. Drug Pricing Review Board could adopt NICE-style value assessment as one input into negotiation. The U.S. would need to adapt the model to its multi-payer system and address cultural resistance to explicit rationing.

### Germany: Reference Pricing and Benefit Assessment

**Description**: Germany's Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Healthcare (IQWiG) conducts benefit assessments of new drugs, which inform negotiations between manufacturers and the sickness fund system. Drugs that fail to demonstrate added benefit over existing therapies are subject to reference pricing.

**Results**: Germany has the third-largest pharmaceutical market globally while paying substantially less than the U.S. (62% of U.S. per-capita spending). The system maintains innovation incentives for genuine advances while controlling costs for marginal improvements.

**Applicability to U.S.**: The German model's distinction between drugs with demonstrated added benefit (which receive negotiated premium pricing) and those without (which receive reference pricing) could inform U.S. patent and pricing reform.

### Canada: Patented Medicine Prices Review Board

**Description**: The PMPRB is a quasi-judicial body that sets maximum prices for patented medicines based on international reference pricing and therapeutic value assessment.

**Results**: Canadian drug prices are approximately 59% of U.S. levels. The PMPRB underwent significant reform in 2019-2024 to further strengthen price controls.

**Applicability to U.S.**: International reference pricing is the most straightforward model for U.S. adoption, as it requires only comparisons to observable prices in other countries. The IRA's negotiation framework could be expanded to incorporate reference pricing.

## Pilot Programs and Demonstrations

- **Civica Rx**: A nonprofit generic drug manufacturer founded in 2018 by a consortium of major health systems, Civica has successfully produced essential generics at 30-80% below market prices and is now manufacturing biosimilar insulin at a list price of $30 per vial -- demonstrating that non-profit manufacturing can address pricing and shortage problems simultaneously
- **Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company**: Launched in 2022, this online pharmacy offers generic drugs at cost plus a 15% margin and $3 dispensing fee, transparently disclosing its pricing methodology. It has achieved price reductions of 50-95% on many generic drugs
- **California CalRx Generic Drug Label**: California established a state generic drug label in 2022, initially producing naloxone and insulin at reduced prices through state contracts, demonstrating that state governments can directly address drug pricing

## Complementary Policies

Pharmaceutical industry reform must be coordinated with related policy changes:

- **[Drug Pricing](../drug-pricing/07-solutions.md)**: Broader drug pricing reforms including importation, generic competition, and biosimilar uptake
- **[Opioid Crisis](../opioid-crisis/07-solutions.md)**: Settlement fund allocation, treatment expansion, and ongoing accountability
- **[Drug Scheduling](../drug-scheduling/07-solutions.md)**: FDA's role in scheduling decisions must be strengthened as part of broader FDA reform
- **Healthcare reform**: Drug pricing is inseparable from broader healthcare coverage and payment policy
