# Pharmaceutical Industry: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

Pharmaceutical industry reform requires a phased strategy that sequences politically achievable reforms first to build momentum, followed by more structural changes that address root causes. The approach leverages bipartisan consensus on drug pricing and PBM reform as entry points, then advances to more contested areas -- FDA independence, patent system overhaul, marketing restrictions, and executive accountability -- as public support and political will build. Each phase creates conditions that make subsequent phases more feasible: reduced industry profits in Phase 1 diminish the lobbying resources available to oppose Phase 2 and 3 reforms.

## Phase 1: Foundation and Quick Wins (Years 1-2)

### Objectives

- Expand Medicare drug price negotiation beyond current IRA limits
- Enact PBM transparency and fiduciary duty requirements
- Extend insulin copay caps to commercial insurance
- Strengthen pharmaceutical whistleblower protections
- Establish DTC advertising cooling-off period for newly approved drugs

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Expand IRA negotiation to all drugs without generic competition | Congress (Finance, E&C Committees) | Months 1-12 | CBO scoring; committee staff | Bill passage |
| Enact PBM Transparency and Fiduciary Duty Act | Congress (bipartisan) | Months 1-8 | Committee staff; FTC input | Bill passage |
| Extend insulin copay cap ($35/month) to commercial market | Congress | Months 1-6 | CBO scoring | Bill passage |
| Strengthen whistleblower protections (expand False Claims Act for pharma) | Congress (Judiciary Committee) | Months 6-18 | DOJ input | Bill passage |
| Implement 3-year DTC advertising cooling-off period | FDA rulemaking / Congress | Months 6-18 | FDA staff; legal review | Rule finalized or bill passed |
| Establish DOJ Pharmaceutical Fraud Task Force | DOJ / Executive Order | Months 1-6 | $75 million initial funding | Task force operational |

### Legislative Requirements

- Pharmaceutical Competition and Affordability Act (expanded negotiation, insulin cap extension)
- PBM Transparency and Accountability Act
- Pharmaceutical Whistleblower Enhancement Act
- Executive order establishing DOJ pharmaceutical fraud task force

### Expected Outcomes

Phase 1 should produce immediate, visible benefits: lower drug prices for Medicare beneficiaries on additional drugs, insulin cost relief for commercially insured patients, increased PBM transparency, and a credible enforcement signal through the DOJ task force. These outcomes build public confidence and political support for Phase 2 reforms.

## Phase 2: Structural Reform (Years 3-5)

### Objectives

- Enact comprehensive patent reform targeting pharmaceutical-specific abuses
- Begin transitioning FDA funding from user fees to Congressional appropriations
- Establish an independent Drug Pricing Review Board
- Create a public generic drug manufacturing entity
- Implement pharmaceutical executive criminal liability provisions

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Comprehensive Patent Reform Act | Congress (Judiciary Committee) | Months 24-36 | USPTO input; CBO scoring | Bill passage |
| Begin FDA funding transition (Year 1: 10% shift to appropriations) | Congress (Appropriations) | Months 24-36 | $130 million in new appropriations | Appropriation enacted |
| Establish Drug Pricing Review Board within HHS | Congress / HHS | Months 30-42 | $150-250 million annually; expert staff | Board operational |
| Authorize and fund public generic drug manufacturing entity | Congress | Months 30-48 | $1-2 billion initial capitalization | Entity authorized; first facility contracted |
| Enact Pharmaceutical Executive Accountability Act | Congress (Judiciary) | Months 24-36 | DOJ guidance | Bill passage |
| Complete FTC PBM rulemaking (vertical integration standards) | FTC | Months 24-42 | FTC staff; economic analysis | Final rule published |

### Legislative Requirements

- STOP Evergreening Act (patent reform)
- FDA Independence Act (funding transition)
- Drug Pricing Review Board Act
- Public Drug Manufacturing Authorization Act
- Pharmaceutical Executive Accountability Act

### Expected Outcomes

Phase 2 addresses structural causes: patent reform accelerates generic competition, FDA independence reduces regulatory capture, the pricing board establishes evidence-based valuation, public manufacturing creates market competition for essential drugs, and executive accountability creates personal deterrence for corporate misconduct.

## Phase 3: Transformation (Years 6-10)

### Objectives

- Complete FDA funding transition to Congressional appropriations
- Implement full international reference pricing across all payers
- Scale public manufacturing to 50+ essential drugs
- Implement comprehensive DTC advertising restrictions
- Fundamentally restructure PBM market

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Complete FDA funding transition (100% Congressional funding) | Congress | Years 6-10 | $1.3 billion in annual appropriations | Full transition achieved |
| Implement international reference pricing for all payers | HHS / Drug Pricing Review Board | Years 6-8 | Board operational capacity | Pricing system operational |
| Scale public manufacturing to 50+ essential drugs | Manufacturing entity | Years 6-10 | Additional $500 million capital | Production targets met |
| Enact comprehensive DTC advertising restrictions | Congress / FDA | Years 6-8 | Legal defense budget | Legislation/regulation enacted |
| PBM vertical integration structural reform | FTC / Congress | Years 6-10 | FTC enforcement resources | Market restructuring complete |

### Expected Outcomes

Phase 3 completes the transformation: FDA operates as a fully independent regulator; drug prices reflect therapeutic value relative to international benchmarks; public manufacturing ensures supply chain resilience for essential drugs; DTC advertising no longer drives inappropriate prescribing; and the PBM market serves patients rather than extracting rents.

## Governance and Oversight

Implementation requires robust governance and accountability:

- **Congressional Oversight**: Senate Finance Committee and House Energy and Commerce Committee hold annual hearings on pharmaceutical reform implementation progress
- **HHS Implementation Office**: Dedicated office within HHS coordinates cross-agency implementation (FDA, CMS, FTC, DOJ)
- **Drug Pricing Review Board**: Independent body with statutory authority, appointed members with expertise in pharmacoeconomics, clinical medicine, and health policy; no members with recent pharmaceutical industry financial ties
- **GAO Annual Audit**: Government Accountability Office conducts annual review of reform implementation, drug pricing trends, and settlement fund allocation
- **Public Dashboard**: Real-time public reporting of drug prices, negotiation outcomes, PBM transparency data, and enforcement actions

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Industry Litigation Delays or Blocks Reforms

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Draft legislation with robust constitutional grounding; include Congressional findings supporting Commerce Clause authority; consult with constitutional scholars during drafting; include severability clauses so individual provisions can be upheld even if others are struck down.

**Contingency Plan**: Pursue reforms through regulatory authority and executive action where legislation is blocked; advance state-level reforms as fallback.

### Risk 2: Innovation Decline

**Likelihood**: Low-Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Maintain premium pricing for genuinely innovative drugs (those demonstrating added therapeutic benefit over existing treatments); increase NIH funding to compensate for any reduction in private R&D; create incentives for priority therapeutic areas (antibiotics, rare diseases, neglected diseases).

**Contingency Plan**: Adjust pricing benchmarks if evidence shows meaningful innovation decline; expand public R&D investment.

### Risk 3: Industry Circumvention of Patent Reform

**Likelihood**: Medium-High

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Draft patent reform broadly to address known strategies and anticipate new ones; include anti-circumvention provisions; grant FTC and USPTO authority to issue guidance on new evasion tactics.

**Contingency Plan**: Establish expedited legislative process for closing newly identified loopholes.

### Risk 4: Political Opposition Reversal

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Phase in reforms during early legislative window; make key provisions (pricing negotiation, PBM transparency) popular and visible to build public constituency for maintaining reforms.

**Contingency Plan**: Design programs so that reversal would produce visible, measurable harm to voters (higher drug prices, reduced access).
