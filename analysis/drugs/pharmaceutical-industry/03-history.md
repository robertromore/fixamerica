# Pharmaceutical Industry: History

## Historical Development

The pharmaceutical industry's relationship with American public health has evolved through distinct phases, from virtually unregulated patent medicine to one of the most powerful and heavily regulated sectors in the economy. At each stage, public health crises have driven regulatory responses, and at each stage, the industry has adapted to new rules while finding ways to preserve and expand its influence.

### The Patent Medicine Era (Pre-1906): Caveat Emptor

- **Unregulated Market**: Throughout the 19th century, Americans consumed a vast array of "patent medicines" -- proprietary concoctions containing alcohol, opium, cocaine, and other substances -- marketed with extravagant health claims and no requirement for ingredient disclosure or efficacy evidence
- **Advertising-Driven Industry**: Patent medicine advertising was the largest category of advertising in American newspapers by the late 1800s, establishing a marketing-driven business model that would persist into the modern era
- **Public Harm**: Widespread poisonings, addiction (particularly to opium-containing preparations), and deaths from adulterated products created growing public demand for regulation
- **The Muckrakers**: Samuel Hopkins Adams' series "The Great American Fraud" (1905-1906) in *Collier's Weekly* and Upton Sinclair's *The Jungle* (1906) catalyzed public outrage

### The Regulatory Foundation (1906-1961): Safety as the Standard

- **Pure Food and Drug Act (1906)**: The first federal law prohibiting the manufacture, sale, or transportation of adulterated or misbranded food and drugs; established the Bureau of Chemistry (precursor to FDA) as the regulatory body
- **Sulfanilamide Disaster (1937)**: Elixir Sulfanilamide, a liquid formulation of an antibiotic dissolved in toxic diethylene glycol, killed 107 people including many children. The manufacturer was charged only with "misbranding" (calling it an "elixir") because existing law did not require safety testing
- **Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (1938)**: Enacted in direct response to the Sulfanilamide disaster, this landmark law required manufacturers to prove drug safety before marketing -- the first premarket safety requirement in the world
- **Postwar Pharmaceutical Boom**: The development of penicillin, streptomycin, and other antibiotics during and after World War II transformed the pharmaceutical industry from a largely chemical-manufacturing enterprise into a science-driven, research-intensive sector
- **Industry Growth**: Between 1940 and 1960, pharmaceutical industry revenues grew from approximately $300 million to $2.3 billion, driven by new drug discovery and the expansion of employer-sponsored health insurance

### The Efficacy Era (1962-1991): Proving It Works

- **Thalidomide Crisis (1961-1962)**: The sedative thalidomide, widely prescribed in Europe for morning sickness, caused severe birth defects in more than 10,000 children worldwide. FDA reviewer Frances Kelsey's refusal to approve the drug in the U.S. prevented a domestic catastrophe and became a powerful argument for stronger regulation
- **Kefauver-Harris Amendment (1962)**: Required manufacturers to prove drug efficacy (not just safety) before marketing; established requirements for informed consent in clinical trials and adverse event reporting; gave the FDA authority to require good manufacturing practices
- **Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI)**: The FDA retroactively reviewed approximately 3,400 drug products marketed between 1938 and 1962; found roughly one-third to be ineffective
- **Growing Industry Power**: By the 1970s, pharmaceutical companies had become major political donors and were beginning to build the lobbying infrastructure that would make them the dominant interest group in healthcare policy
- **Orphan Drug Act (1983)**: Provided incentives (seven-year market exclusivity, tax credits, reduced fees) for developing drugs for rare diseases affecting fewer than 200,000 Americans; intended to address market failure in rare disease research

### The Deregulation and Marketing Era (1992-2009): Speed, Advertising, and Influence

- **Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA, 1992)**: Created the user fee system under which pharmaceutical companies pay the FDA to review their applications, dramatically reducing review times from an average of 33 months (1987) to under 12 months by the 2000s
- **Direct-to-Consumer Advertising (1997)**: The FDA Modernization Act of 1997 and a 1997 FDA guidance document relaxed rules on DTC advertising, enabling the broadcast advertising of prescription drugs. DTC ad spending grew from $791 million in 1996 to $4.9 billion by 2007
- **Hatch-Waxman Act (1984) and Generic Growth**: The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act ("Hatch-Waxman") created the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) pathway for generic drugs while granting brand manufacturers patent term extensions and data exclusivity periods. It increased generic competition but also created mechanisms (such as 30-month stays triggered by patent infringement suits) that brands would later exploit
- **Medicare Part D (2003)**: The Medicare Modernization Act created the Part D prescription drug benefit -- the largest expansion of Medicare since its creation -- but explicitly prohibited the federal government from negotiating drug prices, a provision that the pharmaceutical industry lobbied heavily to include
- **Blockbuster Drug Model**: The industry's business model increasingly centered on "blockbuster" drugs generating over $1 billion in annual sales. By 2000, the top 10 drugs accounted for more than $50 billion in combined annual revenue
- **Pay-for-Delay Settlements**: Brand-name manufacturers began paying generic companies to delay market entry, preserving monopoly pricing. The FTC estimated that these agreements cost consumers $3.5 billion annually (FTC, 2010)

### The Opioid Crisis and Accountability Era (2010-Present): Reckoning

- **Purdue Pharma and OxyContin**: Purdue Pharma launched OxyContin in 1996 with a marketing campaign that claimed the drug's controlled-release formulation made it less addictive than other opioids -- a claim internal documents showed the company knew to be misleading. Purdue spent an estimated $207 million marketing OxyContin from 1996 to 2001, including training and deploying approximately 1,000 sales representatives who targeted the highest-prescribing physicians
- **2007 Federal Guilty Plea**: In 2007, Purdue Pharma and three executives pled guilty to federal charges of misbranding OxyContin and paid $634.5 million in fines -- a penalty that represented a small fraction of the billions in profits the drug generated and that failed to deter continued aggressive marketing
- **Opioid Prescribing Peak (2012)**: U.S. opioid prescribing peaked at 255 million prescriptions (81.3 per 100 persons), reflecting a two-decade campaign by the pharmaceutical industry, medical societies, and advocacy groups (some industry-funded) to normalize aggressive opioid prescribing for chronic pain
- **Transition to Illicit Opioids**: As regulatory restrictions and prescriber education reduced prescription opioid availability, millions of people with opioid dependence transitioned to heroin and subsequently to illicitly manufactured fentanyl, producing the deadliest phase of the epidemic
- **Mass Litigation**: Beginning in 2017, thousands of state and local governments filed lawsuits against pharmaceutical manufacturers, distributors, and pharmacies, producing more than $50 billion in settlements by 2024
- **Sackler Family Accountability**: The Sackler family, which owned Purdue Pharma and personally directed key marketing decisions, extracted an estimated $10-12 billion from the company before it declared bankruptcy. The Supreme Court's 2024 decision in *Harrington v. Purdue Pharma* initially rejected a bankruptcy plan that would have shielded the Sacklers from civil liability, though a revised $6 billion settlement was subsequently approved. No Sackler family member has faced criminal prosecution
- **Inflation Reduction Act (2022)**: After decades of industry lobbying that blocked price negotiation, the IRA authorized Medicare to negotiate prices on a limited number of high-cost drugs, capped insulin copays at $35 for Medicare beneficiaries, and imposed inflation-based rebate penalties
- **FTC PBM Investigation (2024)**: The Federal Trade Commission launched an investigation into PBM practices, releasing an interim report in July 2024 finding "perverse incentives" in the vertically integrated PBM model

## Lessons from History

### Pattern 1: Crisis-Driven Regulation

Every major pharmaceutical regulation in American history has followed a public health catastrophe: the Pure Food and Drug Act followed patent medicine abuses, the 1938 FD&C Act followed the Sulfanilamide disaster, the 1962 amendments followed thalidomide, and the Inflation Reduction Act followed decades of escalating prices and the opioid crisis. The pharmaceutical industry has successfully blocked prophylactic regulation, forcing the public to endure preventable harm before Congress acts.

### Pattern 2: Regulatory Adaptation and Capture

The pharmaceutical industry has consistently adapted to new regulations by finding creative ways to work within -- and around -- regulatory frameworks. The Hatch-Waxman Act was intended to increase generic competition but created patent-listing and litigation strategies that brands exploited to delay generics. PDUFA was intended to speed review times but created financial dependence of the FDA on industry fees. The orphan drug program was intended to incentivize rare disease research but has been used to gain extended exclusivity for drugs with far broader commercial applications.

### Pattern 3: Marketing Precedes Science

From patent medicines to OxyContin to DTC advertising, the pharmaceutical industry has consistently prioritized marketing over evidence-based communication. The opioid crisis demonstrated that aggressive marketing, combined with inadequate regulatory enforcement, can produce mass public health harm that persists for decades.

### Pattern 4: Accountability Delayed Is Accountability Diminished

The time lag between pharmaceutical industry misconduct and meaningful consequences -- typically 10-20 years -- allows enormous harm to accumulate and responsible individuals to benefit financially before facing any accountability. Purdue Pharma's 2007 guilty plea (eleven years after OxyContin's launch) imposed penalties that were trivial relative to profits and failed to prevent continued aggressive marketing. The Sackler family extracted billions in personal wealth before the company's 2019 bankruptcy.
