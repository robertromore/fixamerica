# Pharmaceutical Industry: Stakeholders

The pharmaceutical industry is shaped by the interactions of several key groups, each with its own economic interests, political power, and influence over drug development, pricing, marketing, and regulation.

## Who Is Affected

### Primary Stakeholders

| Group | Impact | Size | Key Interests |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|
| Patients and consumers | Pay highest drug prices in developed world; 29% report not filling prescriptions due to cost | ~332 million (total population); 131 million prescription drug users | Affordable access; safe, effective medications; transparent pricing |
| Medicare beneficiaries | Limited formularies; coverage gaps; high out-of-pocket costs for specialty drugs until 2025 cap | ~67 million | Lower costs; broader formulary access; IRA implementation |
| Uninsured/underinsured Americans | No negotiated discounts; pay list prices or rely on manufacturer assistance programs | ~27 million uninsured; ~40 million underinsured | Affordable access; expanded coverage |
| Physicians and prescribers | Targeted by marketing; limited ability to compare drug costs for patients; opioid crisis liability | ~1.1 million physicians | Evidence-based prescribing information; reduced industry influence; malpractice protection |
| Pharmacists | Declining reimbursements from PBMs; increased administrative burden; drug shortage management | ~330,000 | Fair PBM reimbursement; reduced administrative burden; scope of practice expansion |
| Opioid crisis survivors and families | >700,000 deaths since 1999; millions with opioid use disorder; communities devastated | ~5.6 million with current OUD; millions of family members | Accountability; treatment access; settlement fund allocation |

### Secondary Stakeholders

- **Employers**: Bear significant drug costs through employer-sponsored insurance; rising pharmaceutical spending drives premium increases affecting competitiveness and worker compensation
- **State and local governments**: Fund Medicaid drug spending (average 19% of state Medicaid budgets); manage opioid crisis response; administer settlement funds
- **Taxpayers**: Fund NIH research ($48.6 billion, FY2024) that underpins much of the drug development pipeline; subsidize pharmaceutical industry through tax credits, patent exclusivities, and government-funded basic research
- **Generic and biosimilar manufacturers**: Face barriers to market entry from patent thickets, regulatory exclusivities, and PBM contracting practices
- **Academic researchers**: Conduct federally funded basic research that pharmaceutical companies commercialize; face conflicts of interest from industry funding

## Who Has Power

### Decision Makers

| Actor | Role | Authority | Resources | Influence Level |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| U.S. Congress | Legislation governing drug pricing, patents, FDA authority | Constitutional legislative power | Staff; CBO analysis; constituent pressure | High |
| FDA (CDER/CBER) | Drug approval, labeling, post-market surveillance, enforcement | Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act | ~$3.6 billion budget (FY2024); ~18,000 employees | High |
| CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid) | Medicare/Medicaid drug coverage, reimbursement, negotiation | Social Security Act; IRA negotiation authority | $1.5 trillion in annual spending | High |
| FTC | Antitrust enforcement, PBM investigation, pay-for-delay litigation | FTC Act; Sherman Act | ~$400 million budget (FY2024) | Medium-High |
| U.S. Patent and Trademark Office | Patent examination and grants | Patent Act (35 U.S.C.) | ~$4 billion budget (self-funded by fees) | Medium |
| State Attorneys General | Consumer protection, antitrust, opioid litigation | State consumer protection statutes | Varies by state | Medium-High |
| President/HHS Secretary | Executive orders, regulatory priorities, IRA implementation | Executive authority; HHS organic statutes | Administrative power | High |

### Key Organizations and Institutions

- **Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA)**: The industry's primary trade association, with annual revenues exceeding $500 million and lobbying expenditures of $29.3 million in 2023. PhRMA coordinates industry-wide political strategy, advertising campaigns, and policy advocacy
- **Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO)**: Represents smaller biotech companies and startups; lobbies for patent protections and regulatory policies favorable to drug development; $12.8 million in lobbying (2023)
- **National Institutes of Health (NIH)**: Funds $48.6 billion (FY2024) in biomedical research that forms the foundation of the drug development pipeline; NIH-funded research contributed to every one of the 210 drugs approved by the FDA from 2010-2016 (Galkina Cleary et al., *PNAS*, 2018)
- **Pharmacy Benefit Managers (CVS Caremark, Express Scripts, OptumRx)**: Control drug formularies, negotiate rebates, and determine pharmacy reimbursement for approximately 267 million Americans
- **American Medical Association (AMA)**: Represents physicians; has advocated for reduced industry marketing to physicians, drug pricing reform, and malpractice protections related to prescribing
- **AARP**: Represents 38 million members aged 50+; one of the most influential advocacy organizations for drug pricing reform and Medicare benefit improvements

### Influencers

- **Patient Advocacy Organizations**: Groups like the American Cancer Society, American Diabetes Association, and National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) shape public discourse and policy. However, a 2020 study found that 12 of the 14 largest patient advocacy organizations received pharmaceutical industry funding, creating potential conflicts (McCoy et al., *J Gen Intern Med*, 2020)
- **Academic Medical Centers**: Shape clinical practice through research, training, and guideline development; receive significant industry funding for clinical trials and continuing medical education
- **Investment Analysts and Shareholders**: Pharmaceutical company stock prices and analyst expectations drive corporate strategy, often prioritizing short-term profitability over long-term public health outcomes
- **Media and Investigative Journalists**: Outlets such as *STAT News*, *ProPublica*, and the *New York Times* have published investigations that shaped public understanding of the opioid crisis, drug pricing, and PBM practices

## Stakeholder Interests and Alignment

### Aligned Interests (Potential Coalition Partners)

| Coalition | Shared Interest | Strength |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Patients + AARP + Employers + State governments | Lower drug prices and greater transparency | Strong |
| Generic manufacturers + FTC + Consumer advocates | Removing anticompetitive barriers to generic/biosimilar competition | Strong |
| Opioid survivors + State AGs + Public health organizations | Pharmaceutical industry accountability and effective settlement fund use | Strong |
| Independent pharmacies + Small insurers + Patient groups | PBM reform and transparency | Moderate-Strong |
| Academic researchers + FDA career staff + Evidence-based medicine advocates | Strengthened FDA independence and post-market surveillance | Moderate |

### Conflicting Interests

- **Patients vs. Pharmaceutical manufacturers**: Patients need affordable drugs; manufacturers maximize revenue through high prices and extended monopolies
- **PBMs vs. Independent pharmacies**: PBMs steer patients to their own affiliated pharmacies and set reimbursement rates that can drive independent pharmacies out of business. The number of independent pharmacies has declined from approximately 23,000 in 2010 to fewer than 19,000 in 2023 (NCPA, 2024)
- **Brand manufacturers vs. Generic/biosimilar companies**: Brand manufacturers use patent thickets, REMS abuse, and pay-for-delay settlements to block generic competition
- **FDA career scientists vs. Industry pressure**: Career reviewers and safety officers sometimes face pressure -- internal and external -- to approve drugs or maintain approvals despite safety concerns

### The Pharmaceutical Iron Triangle

The pharmaceutical industry operates within a reinforcing power structure:

1. **Industry** provides campaign contributions and lobbying resources to **Congress**
2. **Congress** maintains industry-favorable legislation (patent extensions, limited price regulation, user fee model) and appropriates funding for **FDA**
3. **FDA** approves industry products, maintains cooperative relationships, and its former officials cycle into **Industry** positions
4. The cycle reinforces itself: industry profits fund more lobbying, which maintains favorable legislation, which maintains profits

## Influence Mechanisms

How stakeholders exert influence on pharmaceutical policy:

- **Lobbying**: The pharmaceutical industry spent $374 million on federal lobbying in 2023, more than any other industry sector. PhRMA alone employed 1,805 lobbyists, maintaining a ratio of 3.4 lobbyists per member of Congress (OpenSecrets, 2024)
- **Campaign Contributions**: Pharmaceutical and health products companies contributed $90.5 million in the 2022 election cycle, distributed across both parties with a slight Republican lean (OpenSecrets, 2024)
- **Revolving Door**: The movement of officials between government and industry creates networks of influence and shared perspectives. Over 60% of PhRMA's registered lobbyists are former government officials (OpenSecrets, 2024)
- **Astroturf Advocacy**: Industry-funded patient advocacy groups, physician societies, and disease awareness campaigns create the appearance of grassroots support for industry positions on issues such as drug pricing, patent protections, and accelerated approval
- **Direct-to-Consumer Advertising**: $6.58 billion in annual DTC advertising (2022) shapes patient demand and public perceptions of pharmaceutical products, creating political constituencies for industry positions
- **Academic Funding and Key Opinion Leaders**: Industry-funded clinical trials, consulting arrangements, and speaking fees create relationships with influential physicians who shape clinical practice and treatment guidelines. The Open Payments database recorded $12.1 billion in industry payments to physicians between 2014 and 2023 (CMS, 2024)
- **Legal Challenges**: The pharmaceutical industry has filed multiple lawsuits challenging the IRA's price negotiation provisions, arguing they constitute unconstitutional takings, compelled speech, and violations of due process
