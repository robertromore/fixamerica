# Pharmaceutical Industry: Current State

## Overview

The U.S. pharmaceutical industry is the largest in the world by revenue, generating $603 billion in domestic sales in 2023 (IQVIA Institute, 2024). The United States accounts for approximately 42% of global pharmaceutical revenue while representing only 4.2% of the world population, reflecting both high per-capita consumption and prices that significantly exceed those in other developed nations. The industry is simultaneously undergoing significant structural changes: the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 introduced the first-ever Medicare drug price negotiations, patent cliffs are exposing blockbuster drugs to generic competition, consolidation among PBMs has attracted bipartisan regulatory scrutiny, and the opioid litigation has produced more than $50 billion in settlements that are reshaping accountability norms.

## Drug Pricing

### U.S. Prices in International Context

The United States pays significantly more for prescription drugs than any other developed nation:

| Country | Per-Capita Pharmaceutical Spending (2022) | % of U.S. Level | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| United States | $1,432 | 100% | OECD Health Statistics, 2023 |
| Germany | $884 | 62% | OECD Health Statistics, 2023 |
| Canada | $844 | 59% | OECD Health Statistics, 2023 |
| France | $668 | 47% | OECD Health Statistics, 2023 |
| Japan | $632 | 44% | OECD Health Statistics, 2023 |
| United Kingdom | $548 | 38% | OECD Health Statistics, 2023 |
| OECD Average | $594 | 41% | OECD Health Statistics, 2023 |

### Branded Drug Price Trends

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Average branded drug price increase (2023) | 4.9% | GoodRx Research, 2024 |
| Drugs with list price increases in January 2024 | ~775 | GoodRx Research, 2024 |
| Median list price increase (January 2024) | 4.5% | GoodRx Research, 2024 |
| Average annual cost of a new branded drug (2023) | $222,000 | IQVIA Institute, 2024 |
| Specialty drug share of total spending (2023) | ~55% | IQVIA Institute, 2024 |
| Drugs with annual cost exceeding $100,000 (2023) | 896 | AARP Public Policy Institute, 2024 |

Specialty and biologic drugs -- which treat complex conditions such as cancer, autoimmune diseases, and rare genetic disorders -- account for only 2% of U.S. prescriptions but approximately 55% of total drug spending (IQVIA, 2024). The average annual cost of newly launched branded drugs has increased from approximately $2,100 in 2008 to $222,000 in 2023, reflecting both a shift toward specialty products and unconstrained pricing power.

### Patient Impact

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Adults who did not fill prescriptions due to cost (2022) | 29% (estimated 37.6 million) | KFF Health Tracking Poll, 2023 |
| Adults who cut pills or skipped doses to save money (2022) | 21% | KFF Health Tracking Poll, 2023 |
| Annual out-of-pocket drug spending per capita (2022) | $197 | CMS National Health Expenditures, 2023 |
| Share of personal health spending on drugs (2022) | 14% | CMS NHE, 2023 |
| Medicare Part D beneficiaries reaching catastrophic coverage (2022) | 1.4 million | MedPAC, 2024 |

### Inflation Reduction Act Implementation

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 introduced the first Medicare drug price negotiation authority, along with inflation penalties and benefit redesign:

| Provision | Status (as of 2024) | Source |
|---|---|---|
| First 10 drugs selected for negotiation | Selected August 2023; negotiated prices effective January 2026 | CMS, 2024 |
| Estimated 10-year savings from negotiation | $98.5 billion | CBO, 2022 |
| Insulin copay cap ($35/month for Medicare) | Effective January 2023 | CMS, 2023 |
| Part D out-of-pocket cap ($2,000/year) | Effective January 2025 | CMS, 2024 |
| Inflation rebate penalties (Medicare Part B) | Effective January 2023 | CMS, 2023 |
| Inflation rebate penalties (Medicare Part D) | Effective April 2023 | CMS, 2023 |

The ten drugs selected for the first round of negotiation include Eliquis (blood thinner), Jardiance (diabetes), Xarelto (blood thinner), Januvia (diabetes), Farxiga (diabetes/heart failure), Entresto (heart failure), Enbrel (autoimmune), Imbruvica (cancer), Stelara (autoimmune), and Fiasp/NovoLog (insulin). Collectively, these drugs account for approximately $50.5 billion in annual Medicare Part D spending (CMS, 2023).

## Industry Revenue and Spending

### Market Structure

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Global pharmaceutical market revenue (2023) | $1.49 trillion | IQVIA Institute, 2024 |
| U.S. pharmaceutical market revenue (2023) | $603 billion | IQVIA Institute, 2024 |
| U.S. share of global pharmaceutical revenue | ~42% | IQVIA, 2024 |
| Number of pharmaceutical companies in U.S. | ~1,300 (including biotech) | Statista, 2024 |
| Employment in pharma manufacturing (U.S.) | ~344,000 | BLS, 2024 |
| Total pharma/biotech sector employment (U.S.) | ~900,000 | PhRMA, 2023 |

### Top Companies by Revenue

| Company | Global Revenue (2023) | U.S. Revenue (est.) | R&D Spending (2023) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Johnson & Johnson (Innovative Medicine) | $54.8 billion | ~$27 billion | $11.4 billion | J&J Annual Report, 2024 |
| Pfizer | $58.5 billion | ~$25 billion | $10.7 billion | Pfizer Annual Report, 2024 |
| AbbVie | $54.3 billion | ~$36 billion | $8.2 billion | AbbVie Annual Report, 2024 |
| Merck | $60.1 billion | ~$25 billion | $13.6 billion | Merck Annual Report, 2024 |
| Bristol-Myers Squibb | $45.0 billion | ~$24 billion | $9.3 billion | BMS Annual Report, 2024 |
| Eli Lilly | $34.1 billion | ~$18 billion | $9.3 billion | Lilly Annual Report, 2024 |
| Roche | $62.8 billion | ~$20 billion | $14.8 billion | Roche Annual Report, 2024 |

### R&D vs. Marketing Spending

A persistent criticism of the pharmaceutical industry is that it spends more on sales, marketing, and administration than on research and development. Available data supports this claim for most major companies:

| Spending Category | Estimated Annual Total (U.S.) | Source |
|---|---|---|
| PhRMA member company R&D spending (2022) | $101.6 billion | PhRMA, 2023 |
| Total U.S. pharmaceutical promotion spending (2022) | $29.9 billion | JAMA, Schwartz & Woloshin, 2023 |
| Direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising (2022) | $6.58 billion | Kantar Media, 2023 |
| Detailing (sales rep visits to physicians) | ~$5.6 billion | IQVIA, 2023 |
| Free drug samples (estimated retail value, 2022) | $12.6 billion | JAMA, 2023 |
| Continuing medical education funding by industry (2022) | $2.3 billion | ACCME, 2023 |

The industry-wide R&D figure of $101.6 billion includes spending by all PhRMA member companies, but individual company disclosures frequently show that selling, general, and administrative (SG&A) expenses exceed R&D spending. For example, Johnson & Johnson reported $11.4 billion in R&D versus $19.5 billion in SG&A in 2023.

## FDA Drug Approval Process

### Approval Pipeline

| Metric | 2022 | 2023 | 2024 (est.) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Novel drug approvals (NMEs) | 37 | 55 | ~50 | FDA CDER, 2024 |
| Biologic license applications approved | 7 | 12 | ~10 | FDA CBER, 2024 |
| Median review time (standard) | 12.2 months | 11.4 months | ~11 months | FDA PDUFA Report, 2024 |
| Median review time (priority) | 8.4 months | 7.6 months | ~8 months | FDA PDUFA Report, 2024 |
| Accelerated approvals granted | 12 | 11 | ~10 | FDA, 2024 |
| Drugs withdrawn or indications revoked post-accelerated approval | 3 (2022-2023) | -- | -- | FDA, 2024 |

### User Fee Funding Model

| Metric | FY2024 | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Total CDER budget | ~$3.6 billion | FDA Congressional Budget Justification, FY2024 |
| PDUFA user fee revenue | ~$1.3 billion | FDA, FY2024 |
| Industry user fee share of drug review budget | ~65% | FDA, FY2024 |
| GDUFA (generic drug) user fee revenue | ~$580 million | FDA, FY2024 |
| BsUFA (biosimilar) user fee revenue | ~$45 million | FDA, FY2024 |

The user fee model was established by the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) of 1992 and has been reauthorized seven times, most recently in 2022 (PDUFA VII). While it has dramatically accelerated review times -- median approval times dropped from over 20 months in 1990 to approximately 11 months today -- critics argue that it creates a structural conflict of interest in which the FDA's funding depends on the industry it regulates.

### Key Regulatory Framework

| Law/Regulation | Year | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act** | 1938 | Core FDA authority for drug safety and efficacy |
| **Kefauver-Harris Amendment** | 1962 | Required proof of efficacy before marketing |
| **Hatch-Waxman Act** | 1984 | Created generic drug pathway and patent extensions |
| **PDUFA (Prescription Drug User Fee Act)** | 1992 | Industry-funded FDA review |
| **FDA Modernization Act** | 1997 | Relaxed DTC advertising rules |
| **Medicare Modernization Act** | 2003 | Created Part D; prohibited Medicare price negotiation |
| **Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act** | 2009 | Created biosimilar approval pathway |
| **Drug Supply Chain Security Act** | 2013 | Track-and-trace requirements |
| **21st Century Cures Act** | 2016 | Accelerated approval pathways |
| **Inflation Reduction Act** | 2022 | Medicare drug negotiation, inflation penalties |

## Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs)

### Market Concentration

PBMs serve as intermediaries between drug manufacturers, health insurers, and pharmacies. The market has consolidated dramatically:

| PBM | Parent Company | Market Share (2023) | Lives Covered | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CVS Caremark | CVS Health | ~33% | ~110 million | Drug Channels Institute, 2024 |
| Express Scripts | Cigna Group | ~24% | ~80 million | Drug Channels Institute, 2024 |
| OptumRx | UnitedHealth Group | ~23% | ~77 million | Drug Channels Institute, 2024 |
| **Top 3 Combined** | | **~80%** | **~267 million** | Drug Channels Institute, 2024 |
| Humana Pharmacy Solutions | Humana | ~7% | ~22 million | Drug Channels Institute, 2024 |
| Prime Therapeutics | Blue Cross Blue Shield | ~6% | ~20 million | Drug Channels Institute, 2024 |

### PBM Practices Under Scrutiny

| Issue | Description | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Spread pricing | PBMs charge plans more than they reimburse pharmacies, pocketing the difference | FTC investigation ongoing; multiple state laws enacted |
| Rebate retention | PBMs negotiate manufacturer rebates but may not pass savings to patients at point of sale | FTC report (July 2024) found PBMs retain significant rebate share |
| Pharmacy steering | PBMs direct patients to their own affiliated pharmacies | Subject to state and federal regulation |
| Formulary manipulation | PBMs may prefer drugs with higher rebates over clinically superior alternatives | Under investigation by FTC and state AGs |
| Lack of transparency | PBM contracts with manufacturers and plans are largely confidential | Bipartisan legislation pending in Congress |

The FTC released an interim report in July 2024 finding that the three largest PBMs "have exerted significant control over the prescription drug market," with revenues of $500 billion in 2022, and that their "vertically integrated business model creates perverse incentives" that may not serve patients (FTC, 2024).

## Opioid Litigation and Accountability

### Settlement Status

| Defendant Category | Settlement Amount | Status (2024) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Purdue Pharma / Sackler family | $6 billion (bankruptcy plan) | Final; distributions underway | DOJ, 2024 |
| Three major distributors (McKesson, Cardinal, AmerisourceBergen) | $21 billion | Distributions underway | Settlement Administrator |
| Johnson & Johnson | $5 billion | 46 states participating | State AG Offices |
| Walgreens | $5.7 billion | Distributions beginning | Settlement Administrator |
| CVS Health | $5 billion | Distributions beginning | Settlement Administrator |
| Walmart | $3.1 billion | Settled | Settlement Administrator |
| Teva Pharmaceutical | $4.25 billion | Distributions beginning | Settlement Administrator |
| Allergan | $2.37 billion | Settled | Settlement Administrator |
| Endo International | $450 million (bankruptcy) | Final | Bankruptcy Court |
| Mallinckrodt | $1.7 billion (bankruptcy) | Final | Bankruptcy Court |
| **Total major settlements** | **>$50 billion** | **Ongoing** | **Various** |

### Criminal Accountability

| Event | Year | Details | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Purdue Pharma guilty plea (federal) | 2020 | Pled guilty to fraud and kickback conspiracies; $8.3 billion judgment (largely uncollectible) | DOJ, 2020 |
| Sackler family civil settlement | 2024 | Supreme Court rejected initial bankruptcy deal; revised plan approved for $6 billion | *Harrington v. Purdue Pharma*, 2024 |
| Individual Sackler criminal charges | None | No individual Sackler family member has faced criminal prosecution | Various |
| Insys Therapeutics founder sentenced | 2020 | John Kapoor sentenced to 66 months for RICO conspiracy (fentanyl spray bribery scheme) | DOJ, 2020 |

The absence of criminal prosecution for Sackler family members -- despite internal documents showing they directed marketing strategies that contributed to mass addiction and death -- remains one of the most controversial aspects of opioid accountability.

## Generic and Biosimilar Competition

### Generic Drug Market

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Generic drug share of prescriptions dispensed (2023) | 91% | IQVIA, 2024 |
| Generic drug share of total drug spending (2023) | ~18% | IQVIA, 2024 |
| Average generic drug savings vs. brand | 80-85% | FDA, 2023 |
| Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) approved (FY2023) | 553 | FDA, 2024 |
| First generic approvals (FY2023) | 74 | FDA, 2024 |

### Biosimilar Market

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Biosimilars approved by FDA (cumulative through 2024) | 46 | FDA, 2024 |
| Biosimilars launched on market | 34 | IQVIA, 2024 |
| Average biosimilar discount vs. reference biologic | 20-40% | IQVIA, 2024 |
| Humira (adalimumab) biosimilars launched | 8 (beginning 2023) | FDA, 2024 |
| Estimated biosimilar market savings (2023) | $12.2 billion | IQVIA, 2024 |

Biosimilar uptake in the United States lags behind Europe, where biosimilars capture 70-80% of the market for products with biosimilar competition. In the U.S., the figure is approximately 40% (IQVIA, 2024), reflecting PBM contracting practices, rebate structures, and limited prescriber familiarity.

## Recent Trends

### Patent Cliffs (2023-2030)

Several of the best-selling drugs in history are losing or will soon lose patent protection:

| Drug | Indication | Peak Annual Sales | Patent Expiry (est.) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Humira (adalimumab) | Autoimmune diseases | $21.2 billion (2022) | 2023 (biosimilars launched) | AbbVie, 2023 |
| Keytruda (pembrolizumab) | Cancer | $25.0 billion (2023) | 2028 | Merck, 2024 |
| Eliquis (apixaban) | Blood thinner | $18.1 billion (2023) | 2026 | BMS/Pfizer, 2024 |
| Revlimid (lenalidomide) | Cancer | $12.8 billion (2021) | 2024-2027 (phased) | BMS, 2023 |
| Stelara (ustekinumab) | Autoimmune diseases | $10.9 billion (2023) | 2025 | J&J, 2024 |

These patent expirations represent a combined revenue exposure exceeding $80 billion, driving both generic/biosimilar entry and industry M&A activity.

### Emerging Challenges

- **GLP-1 Receptor Agonist Demand**: Semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro/Zepbound) have created unprecedented demand for obesity and diabetes medications, with combined global sales exceeding $30 billion in 2023 and supply shortages affecting patient access (Novo Nordisk/Eli Lilly, 2024)
- **Gene Therapy Pricing**: Gene therapies for rare diseases carry list prices of $1-3.5 million per treatment (e.g., Hemgenix at $3.5 million, Casgevy at $2.2 million), challenging traditional insurance and reimbursement models (CMS, 2024)
- **AI in Drug Discovery**: Pharmaceutical companies are investing heavily in artificial intelligence for drug discovery, with estimated AI-related pharma spending of $3.5 billion in 2023, though clinical validation of AI-discovered drugs remains limited (McKinsey, 2024)
- **Drug Shortages**: The FDA tracked 301 active drug shortages in 2023, driven by supply chain fragility, low-margin generic manufacturing, and quality control failures (FDA Drug Shortage Database, 2024)
