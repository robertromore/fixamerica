# Drug Decriminalization: Current State

## Drug Possession Arrests in the United States

The United States continues to arrest more people for drug possession than for any other single offense category. Despite decades of reform rhetoric and shifting public opinion, the criminal justice system remains the primary institutional response to personal drug use.

### Arrest Volume and Composition

| Metric | Value | Trend | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total drug arrests (2022) | ~1.5 million | Stable | FBI UCR, 2023 |
| Possession arrests (share of total) | ~1.3 million (87%) | Stable | BJS, 2023 |
| Cannabis possession arrests | ~350,000 | Declining (from 660,000 in 2017) | FBI UCR, 2023 |
| Heroin/opioid possession arrests | ~140,000 | Stable | FBI UCR, 2023 |
| Methamphetamine/stimulant possession arrests | ~280,000 | Increasing | FBI UCR, 2023 |
| Drug possession as share of all arrests | ~14% | Stable | FBI UCR, 2023 |

### Racial Disparities in Drug Arrests

Enforcement of drug possession laws continues to reflect profound racial disparities, despite comparable drug use rates across racial groups.

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Black-white cannabis arrest disparity | 3.73x (national average) | ACLU, 2020 |
| Black-white cannabis arrest disparity (worst states) | >6x (MT, KY, IL, WV) | ACLU, 2020 |
| Black share of drug possession arrests | ~27% | FBI UCR, 2023 |
| Black share of U.S. population | ~13.6% | Census Bureau, 2023 |
| Hispanic drug arrest overrepresentation | 1.4x population share | Sentencing Project, 2023 |
| Past-month illicit drug use (white) | 14.6% | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |
| Past-month illicit drug use (Black) | 15.4% | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |

### Consequences of Drug Possession Convictions

A drug possession conviction -- even a misdemeanor -- triggers a cascade of collateral consequences that extend far beyond the courtroom.

| Consequence | Federal | State (typical) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Employment barriers | Background check disqualification for federal jobs | Varies; 12 states ban the box for private employers | NELP, 2024 |
| Housing restrictions | Ineligible for federal public housing | Most public housing authorities maintain exclusions | HUD, 2023 |
| Education aid | FAFSA drug question eliminated (2023) | Some states maintain restrictions | Dept. of Education, 2023 |
| SNAP/TANF ban | Felony drug conviction ban (many state opt-outs) | 25 states have fully or partially lifted ban | CLASP, 2023 |
| Driver's license suspension | Federal mandate repealed (most states) | 7 states still suspend for drug offenses | NCSL, 2024 |
| Immigration consequences | Drug conviction = deportation risk for non-citizens | N/A | INA Section 237(a)(2)(B) |

## State-Level Decriminalization Landscape

### Cannabis Decriminalization and Legalization

Cannabis policy has undergone the most rapid shift. As of 2024, the landscape divides into several tiers.

| Category | Number of States | Examples | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Full legalization (recreational + medical) | 24 + D.C. | CO, WA, CA, IL, NY, VA | NCSL, 2024 |
| Medical only | 14 | FL, PA, OH (rec approved 2023), NC | NCSL, 2024 |
| Decriminalized (civil penalty, no legal market) | 5 | MS, NE, NC, ND, MN (prior to legalization) | NORML, 2024 |
| Full prohibition (criminal penalty for any amount) | 7 | ID, WY, KS, SC, WI, IN, TN | NORML, 2024 |

### Broader Drug Decriminalization

Beyond cannabis, only a handful of jurisdictions have decriminalized possession of other controlled substances.

| Jurisdiction | Year | Scope | Mechanism | Current Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Oregon (Measure 110) | 2020 (effective Feb. 2021) | All drugs, personal quantities | Ballot measure; $100 citation, health assessment | Recriminalized Sept. 2024 (HB 4002) |
| Oregon (HB 4002) | 2024 | Reversed Measure 110 | Restored misdemeanor for possession | In effect |
| Washington State (*State v. Blake*) | 2021 | All drugs (court ruling) | Supreme Court struck down felony possession statute | Legislature passed new misdemeanor statute (SB 5536, 2023) |
| British Columbia (Canada) | 2023 | All drugs, 2.5g threshold | Federal exemption from CDSA | Partially reversed 2024; public use re-prohibited |
| Philadelphia (DA Krasner) | 2018 | Cannabis, small amounts of other drugs | Prosecutorial discretion | Ongoing |
| Manhattan (DA Bragg) | 2022 | Marijuana, non-violent drug possession | Prosecutorial non-enforcement | Ongoing |

### Oregon Measure 110: Case Study

Oregon's Measure 110, approved by 58.5% of voters in November 2020, was the most ambitious drug decriminalization initiative in U.S. history. Understanding its trajectory is essential.

**Key Design Features:**

- Reclassified personal possession of all drugs from a misdemeanor to a Class E violation (max $100 fine)
- Fine waived if individual called a health assessment hotline
- Funded by redirecting cannabis tax revenue (~$300 million over two years)
- Created Behavioral Health Resource Networks (BHRNs) in each county

**Implementation Challenges:**

| Issue | Detail | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Hotline call rate | Only ~1% of cited individuals called the health assessment hotline | Oregon Health Authority, 2023 |
| Treatment capacity | BHRNs slow to deploy; only 37% of projected services operational by Year 2 | Oregon Audits Division, 2023 |
| Funding distribution delays | $265 million in cannabis tax funds delayed 18+ months due to bureaucratic processes | Oregonian, 2023 |
| Public drug use complaints | Portland 911 calls for "unwanted persons" increased 34% (2021-2023) | Portland Police Bureau, 2023 |
| Overdose deaths | Oregon overdose deaths rose 41% (2020-2022), though national average rose 28% | CDC WONDER, 2023 |

**2024 Recriminalization (HB 4002):**

- Signed by Governor Tina Kotzee March 2024, effective September 1, 2024
- Restored misdemeanor penalties for personal possession (up to 180 days jail)
- Created "deflection" pathway: charges dismissed if individual engages with treatment
- Maintained Measure 110's treatment funding structure
- Did not repeal the underlying health infrastructure investments

## Treatment System Capacity

The effectiveness of decriminalization depends fundamentally on the capacity of the treatment system to serve individuals diverted from the criminal justice system.

### Treatment Gap

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Americans with SUD (2023) | 48.7 million | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |
| Received any SUD treatment | ~11.7 million (24%) | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |
| Treatment gap (SUD, no treatment) | ~37 million (76%) | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |
| Opioid use disorder (OUD) | ~6.1 million | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |
| OUD receiving medication treatment (MOUD) | ~1.8 million (30%) | SAMHSA, 2024 |
| Treatment facilities accepting Medicaid | 63% | SAMHSA N-SSATS, 2023 |
| Average wait time for publicly funded treatment | 25 days | NSDUH supplement, 2023 |

### Treatment Infrastructure by State (Selected)

| State | Treatment facilities per 100K pop. | MOUD providers per 100K | Medicaid expansion | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Oregon | 8.2 | 12.4 | Yes | SAMHSA, 2024 |
| California | 7.1 | 10.8 | Yes | SAMHSA, 2024 |
| West Virginia | 5.3 | 8.7 | Yes | SAMHSA, 2024 |
| Texas | 3.4 | 4.2 | No | SAMHSA, 2024 |
| Mississippi | 2.8 | 3.1 | Yes (2024) | SAMHSA, 2024 |
| **National average** | **5.6** | **7.3** | **41 states + D.C.** | SAMHSA, 2024 |

## International Decriminalization Models

### Portugal (2001 to Present)

Portugal provides the most studied and comprehensive model. Key outcomes after 20+ years:

| Indicator | Pre-Decrim (2001) | Current (2022) | Change | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Drug-related deaths | 80 | 74 | -7.5% | EMCDDA, 2023 |
| HIV cases among PWID (annual) | 1,016 | ~30 | >90% decline | EMCDDA, 2023 |
| Adults reporting past-year drug use | 7.8% | 12.8% | +5 pp (but below EU avg of 18.8%) | EMCDDA, 2023 |
| Drug offenders in prison | ~44% of inmates | ~15% | -29 pp | Portuguese Ministry of Justice, 2023 |
| People in drug treatment | 23,654 | 33,479 | +41% | SICAD, 2023 |

**Key Design Features:**

1. Possession of any drug below a 10-day personal supply threshold is an administrative offense, not a crime
2. Police issue a citation and confiscate drugs but do not arrest
3. Cited individuals appear before a Dissuasion Commission (CDT) -- a three-member panel including a legal expert, a social worker, and a psychologist
4. CDT can impose sanctions (community service, fines, travel restrictions) but emphasizes voluntary treatment referral
5. Trafficking and dealing remain criminal offenses

### Czech Republic

| Indicator | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Year of decriminalization | 2010 | Czech Drug Policy Act |
| Threshold system | Substance-specific quantity limits | Government Order No. 467/2009 |
| Cannabis threshold | 10 grams (dried) or 5 plants | Gov. Order 467/2009 |
| Cocaine threshold | 1 gram | Gov. Order 467/2009 |
| Penalty for below-threshold possession | Misdemeanor, max fine CZK 15,000 (~$650) | Czech Drug Policy Act |
| Drug use rate trend | Stable; cannabis use slightly above EU average | EMCDDA, 2023 |

## Key Indicators Summary

| Indicator | Current Value | 5-Year Trend | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| U.S. drug possession arrests | ~1.3 million/year | Declining slightly (cannabis down, stimulants up) | FBI UCR, 2023 |
| States with any cannabis decriminalization | 29 + D.C. | Increasing rapidly | NORML, 2024 |
| States with broader decriminalization | 0 (Oregon reversed) | Net decrease since 2024 | NCSL, 2024 |
| Treatment gap (SUD) | 76% untreated | Slight improvement (from ~80% in 2019) | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |
| Overdose deaths (annual) | 107,543 (2023) | Stabilizing after rapid increase | CDC WONDER, 2024 |
| Portugal drug deaths | 74 (2022) | Stable; well below EU average | EMCDDA, 2023 |
| Public support for ending arrest for drug possession | 66% | Increasing (52% in 2014) | Pew Research, 2024 |

## Legal Framework

### Federal Law

| Law/Regulation | Year | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Controlled Substances Act (CSA)** | 1970 | Establishes federal drug scheduling and penalties; simple possession is a misdemeanor (first offense) under 21 U.S.C. Section 844 |
| **Anti-Drug Abuse Act** | 1986 | Created mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses including possession with intent |
| **Fair Sentencing Act** | 2010 | Reduced crack-powder cocaine sentencing disparity from 100:1 to 18:1 |
| **First Step Act** | 2018 | Reduced mandatory minimums, expanded good-time credits, retroactive Fair Sentencing Act relief |
| **EQUAL Act** (proposed) | 2021-2023 | Would eliminate crack-powder sentencing disparity entirely; passed Senate committee, stalled |

### State Law Variation

States employ a wide range of approaches to drug possession penalties:

| Approach | Example States | Max Penalty (First Offense, Small Qty) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Civil infraction (cannabis only) | CT, DE, MD, RI, VT | Fine ($100-$500), no criminal record | NCSL, 2024 |
| Misdemeanor (all drugs) | Most states | Up to 1 year jail, fine | NCSL, 2024 |
| Felony (any amount, some substances) | TX (>1g cocaine), FL, AZ | 2-10+ years prison | State statutes |
| Defelonization (reduced from felony to misdemeanor) | CA (Prop 47, 2014), OK, UT | Misdemeanor up to 1 year | NCSL, 2024 |

## Recent Trends

### Prosecutorial Non-Enforcement

A growing number of elected prosecutors have adopted policies declining to prosecute low-level drug possession cases, effectively achieving decriminalization through discretion.

- **Philadelphia DA Larry Krasner** (2018): Declined prosecution of cannabis possession and directed diversion for small quantities of other drugs
- **Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg** (2022): Declined prosecution of marijuana possession and presumption of non-incarceration for drug possession
- **Baltimore State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby** (2020-2023): Stopped prosecuting drug possession; policy reversed by successor
- **Los Angeles DA George Gascon** (2020-2024): Directed misdemeanor filing for drug possession; replaced by DA Nathan Hochman who reversed policy

### Defelonization Movement

Several states have reclassified drug possession from a felony to a misdemeanor, reducing -- but not eliminating -- criminal penalties.

- **California Proposition 47** (2014): Reclassified drug possession from felony to misdemeanor; reduced state prison population by ~10,000
- **Oklahoma HB 2472** (2016): Reclassified simple drug possession from felony to misdemeanor; estimated $50 million annual savings
- **Utah HB 348** (2015): Created drug possession reduction program; reclassified first and second possession offenses as misdemeanors

## Emerging Challenges

### Fentanyl Complicates Decriminalization Politics

The fentanyl crisis has shifted public discourse. Drug overdose deaths surged from 70,630 in 2019 to 107,543 in 2023 (CDC WONDER, 2024), with synthetic opioids driving roughly 70% of fatalities. This has created political headwinds for decriminalization advocates, as opponents argue that removing criminal penalties during a lethal overdose epidemic is irresponsible. Proponents counter that criminalization deters people from calling 911 during overdoses and from seeking treatment.

### Post-Oregon Backlash

Oregon's 2024 recriminalization sent a signal that has affected decriminalization efforts nationally. No state legislature introduced a comprehensive drug decriminalization bill in 2024, and several municipal non-enforcement policies have been scaled back. Reform advocates are recalibrating, emphasizing the need for treatment infrastructure to precede or accompany decriminalization rather than follow it.

### Supreme Court and Homelessness

The Supreme Court's 2024 decision in *City of Grants Pass v. Johnson* upheld the ability of cities to enforce anti-camping ordinances, reflecting a broader judicial and political trend toward enforcement-based responses to public disorder -- a sentiment that has bled into drug policy debates, particularly around public drug use.
