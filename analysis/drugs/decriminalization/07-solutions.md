# Drug Decriminalization: Solutions

Drug decriminalization requires a multi-faceted approach that replaces criminal penalties for personal drug possession with health-centered civil responses while simultaneously building the treatment and harm reduction infrastructure necessary to support diverted individuals. The goal is not to ignore drug use but to respond to it through systems that actually reduce harm -- treatment, harm reduction, social services -- rather than through a criminal justice system that has demonstrably failed.

---

## Reform Framework

### Guiding Principles

- **Health first, not punishment first**: Drug use and addiction are health issues that should be addressed primarily through the health system, with criminal justice reserved for trafficking, manufacturing, and distribution
- **Infrastructure before or simultaneous with decriminalization**: Treatment, harm reduction, and social services must be funded and operational before or at the same time as criminal penalties are removed -- Oregon's central lesson
- **Accountability without criminalization**: Civil responses should include meaningful engagement mechanisms (mandatory health assessments, graduated sanctions) that provide structure without criminal records
- **Racial equity as design criterion**: Every component of the civil penalty system must be designed and monitored to prevent reproducing the racial disparities embedded in criminal enforcement
- **Evidence-based and data-driven**: All policies should be evaluated using measurable outcomes (overdose deaths, treatment enrollment, racial disparity metrics) with built-in mechanisms for adjustment

### Theory of Change

Decriminalization works through three interconnected pathways: (1) removing the deterrent effect of criminalization that prevents people from seeking treatment, calling 911 during overdoses, and accessing harm reduction services; (2) eliminating the collateral consequences of criminal records that trap people in cycles of poverty and instability that fuel continued drug use; and (3) redirecting criminal justice resources toward treatment and harm reduction, expanding the capacity of the health system to serve people with substance use disorders. The evidence from Portugal demonstrates that all three pathways can operate simultaneously, producing reduced overdose deaths, lower HIV transmission, and decreased incarceration without increasing drug use.

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Federal Decriminalization of Personal Possession

**Description**: Amend the Controlled Substances Act to reclassify simple possession of personal-use quantities of all controlled substances from a criminal offense to a civil violation. Personal-use quantities would be defined through a schedule of substance-specific thresholds (see Solution 3). Violations would be subject to a civil citation carrying a maximum fine of $100 (waivable upon completion of a health screening) rather than arrest, prosecution, or incarceration. Trafficking, manufacturing, and distribution would remain criminal offenses with existing penalty structures.

**Evidence Base**: Portugal's 2001 decriminalization -- the most studied model -- produced drug-related death reductions, >90% decline in HIV among people who inject drugs, and drug use rates below the EU average over 20+ years (EMCDDA, 2023). A 2020 *Lancet Public Health* systematic review of 22 studies across multiple countries found no significant increase in drug use following decriminalization. The National Research Council's 2014 review found that severity of punishment does not deter drug use.

**Implementation**: Requires Congressional amendment to the CSA (21 U.S.C. Section 844). The amendment would redefine simple possession of personal-use quantities as a civil violation rather than a misdemeanor. The DOJ and HHS would jointly develop implementing regulations within 180 days.

**Cost/Resources**: Minimal direct federal cost for the reclassification itself. Savings from reduced federal prosecution and incarceration estimated at $2-4 billion annually. Treatment infrastructure investment (see Solution 2) would require $15-25 billion over 10 years.

**Timeline**: Legislative drafting and passage: 1-3 years. Implementation: 6-12 months after enactment. Full treatment infrastructure buildout: 3-5 years.

**Challenges**: Political opposition from law enforcement groups; association with Oregon's perceived failure; fentanyl crisis creates headwinds; federal action requires Congressional majority.

**Impact Metrics**: Annual drug possession arrests; overdose death rates; treatment enrollment; racial disparities in drug enforcement; criminal record burden on affected populations.

### Solution 2: Treatment Infrastructure Expansion Act

**Description**: Provide $25 billion over 10 years in federal block grants to states and localities for treatment infrastructure expansion, with the explicit goal of achieving "treatment on demand" -- defined as the ability of any person seeking publicly funded substance use disorder treatment to begin treatment within 72 hours of initial contact. Funds would support: (a) expanding medication-assisted treatment (MAT) capacity, particularly buprenorphine and methadone access in underserved areas; (b) building or expanding residential and outpatient treatment facilities; (c) training and hiring addiction counselors, social workers, and peer support specialists; (d) establishing or expanding harm reduction services including naloxone distribution, syringe services, and drug checking.

**Evidence Base**: The SAMHSA treatment gap shows 37 million Americans with SUD but no treatment (SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024). RAND Corporation research estimates that treatment spending returns $4-7 for every $1 invested through reduced crime, healthcare costs, and lost productivity. The average wait time for publicly funded treatment is 25 days (NSDUH supplement, 2023), far too long to capitalize on moments of motivation.

**Implementation**: Federal block grants allocated to states based on a formula incorporating SUD prevalence, treatment gap, overdose death rates, and per capita treatment capacity. States would submit treatment expansion plans as a condition of receiving funds. SAMHSA would administer the program and monitor progress toward treatment-on-demand benchmarks.

**Cost/Resources**: $2.5 billion annually for 10 years ($25 billion total). Offsets from reduced incarceration costs ($2-4 billion annually) and reduced emergency department utilization.

**Timeline**: First grants disbursed within 12 months of enactment. Treatment-on-demand capability achieved in participating states within 3-5 years.

**Challenges**: State administrative capacity varies; workforce shortages in addiction medicine; rural areas lack existing infrastructure to build on; competing budget priorities.

**Impact Metrics**: Wait time for treatment (goal: <72 hours); treatment enrollment rates; MOUD prescriber density per 100K population; treatment gap (goal: reduce from 76% to <40% within 10 years).

### Solution 3: Evidence-Based Possession Threshold System

**Description**: Establish a federal schedule of substance-specific personal-use quantity thresholds that distinguish between possession for personal use (civil violation) and possession with intent to distribute (criminal offense). Thresholds would be based on pharmacological evidence, international precedents, and public health data rather than arbitrary political determinations.

**Proposed Thresholds** (based on Portugal, Czech Republic, and public health research):

| Substance | Threshold (Personal Use) | Basis |
|-----------|--------------------------|-------|
| Cannabis | 28 grams (1 oz) dried flower; 8 grams concentrate | Consistent with most state legal/decriminalized amounts |
| Cocaine/crack | 2 grams | ~10 typical use doses; Portugal threshold equivalent |
| Heroin | 1 gram | ~10 typical use doses; Portugal threshold equivalent |
| Methamphetamine | 2 grams | ~10 typical use doses |
| MDMA | 1 gram or 5 tablets | ~5-10 typical use doses |
| Fentanyl | 0.5 grams (500 mg) | Reflects high potency; ~50 typical use doses |
| Psilocybin | 5 grams (dried) | ~3-5 typical use doses |
| LSD | 10 doses (blotter) | ~10 typical use doses |

**Evidence Base**: The Czech Republic's substance-specific threshold system (since 2010) has been associated with stable drug use rates and reduced incarceration without significant enforcement problems (EMCDDA, 2023). Portugal's 10-day supply standard has functioned effectively for over 20 years. Australia's threshold system (varying by state) provides additional evidence for workability.

**Implementation**: Thresholds established by HHS/DEA joint rulemaking based on pharmacological and public health data. Regular review every 3 years by an independent scientific advisory panel.

**Cost/Resources**: Minimal direct cost; regulatory rulemaking expenses only.

**Timeline**: Rulemaking completed within 12 months of decriminalization enactment; thresholds effective upon publication.

**Challenges**: Any threshold creates a bright line that dealers can exploit by carrying amounts just below the threshold; thresholds must be paired with "totality of circumstances" provisions allowing intent-to-distribute charges based on packaging, cash, communications, and other evidence regardless of quantity.

**Impact Metrics**: Percentage of possession cases falling below thresholds; dealer prosecution rates; racial disparity in threshold enforcement.

### Solution 4: Civil Citation and Health Assessment System

**Description**: Create a standardized civil response system modeled on Portugal's Dissuasion Commissions but adapted for the U.S. context. When an individual is found in possession of drugs below the personal-use threshold, police would issue a civil citation (no arrest, no booking, no criminal record) and confiscate the drugs. Within 14 days, the cited individual would be required to appear for a health screening and assessment conducted by a trained counselor. The assessment would evaluate substance use patterns, mental health status, and social needs, and produce a recommended care plan. Failure to appear for the assessment would result in escalating civil fines ($250, $500, $1,000) and could ultimately be enforced through civil collection mechanisms (similar to unpaid traffic tickets). Repeat citations would trigger more intensive interventions.

**Evidence Base**: Portugal's Dissuasion Commissions have processed over 100,000 cases since 2001, with the majority resulting in treatment referrals or suspended sanctions. The system has been associated with increased treatment enrollment and decreased incarceration (SICAD, 2023). Oregon's failure to design an effective engagement mechanism (the phone call hotline) demonstrates the importance of mandatory in-person assessments.

**Implementation**: States would establish health assessment panels (or contract with community health providers) staffed by licensed counselors, social workers, or peer specialists. Federal grants (from Solution 2) would fund initial setup. Assessment panels would operate out of community health centers, mobile clinics, or dedicated facilities.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $500 million annually for a national network of health assessment panels serving ~1 million citations per year. Average cost per assessment: ~$500. Compare to average cost of a drug arrest and prosecution: ~$10,000.

**Timeline**: Pilot programs in 10 states within 18 months; national rollout within 3 years.

**Challenges**: Workforce requirements (counselors, social workers); ensuring assessments are genuinely therapeutic rather than punitive; accessibility for rural populations; language and cultural competency.

**Impact Metrics**: Assessment completion rate (goal: >70%, compared to Oregon's ~1%); treatment referral acceptance rate; 90-day treatment retention; repeat citation rate.

### Solution 5: Criminal Record Expungement and Sealing Program

**Description**: Establish a federal program to automatically expunge or seal criminal records for prior drug possession convictions where the conduct has been decriminalized. The program would: (a) automatically expunge federal drug possession convictions (misdemeanor and felony) for personal-use quantities; (b) provide federal grants to states to establish or expand automatic expungement processes for state-level drug possession convictions; (c) prohibit employers, housing providers, and educational institutions from considering expunged drug possession convictions; (d) restore federal benefits eligibility (SNAP, TANF, public housing) for individuals with expunged drug convictions.

**Evidence Base**: An estimated 20 million Americans have drug-related criminal records (BJS, 2022). Research from the University of Michigan Law School (2020) found that criminal record expungement increased employment rates by 11% and wages by 22% within two years. Collateral consequences of drug convictions have been identified by the American Bar Association's National Inventory as exceeding 40,000 distinct legal penalties across states.

**Implementation**: Federal expungement administered by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. State grants administered by DOJ, with requirements for automated processes that do not require individual petitions.

**Cost/Resources**: $500 million over 5 years for federal expungement processing and state grants. Expected economic returns: increased tax revenue and reduced recidivism costs estimated at $2-5 billion over 10 years.

**Timeline**: Federal automatic expungement within 24 months. State programs funded within 12 months, operational within 36 months.

**Challenges**: Technical challenges of identifying qualifying records across fragmented criminal record databases; potential employer resistance; political opposition framed as "letting criminals off."

**Impact Metrics**: Number of records expunged; employment rates among expungement beneficiaries; recidivism rates; housing stability.

### Solution 6: Pre-Arrest Deflection Programs

**Description**: Fund and scale law enforcement-based "deflection" programs that allow police officers to redirect individuals they encounter using drugs toward treatment and services rather than arresting them. Four deflection models would be supported: (a) self-referral (individuals can approach police to request treatment without arrest); (b) active outreach (officers proactively offer services); (c) naloxone-plus (officers administer naloxone and connect to treatment post-overdose); (d) officer-initiated (officers divert individuals to treatment rather than arrest at point of contact). Programs would be funded through DOJ grants and would provide liability protection for officers.

**Evidence Base**: The PAARI (Police Assisted Addiction and Recovery Initiative) model, operating in over 600 departments, has connected over 20,000 individuals to treatment. Gloucester, Massachusetts's 2015 "angel program" (self-referral) connected over 4,000 people to treatment in its first three years with a 17% treatment completion rate (higher than the criminal justice comparison group). The Madison, Wisconsin CARES model (active outreach) reduced repeat emergency contacts by 38% (University of Wisconsin, 2022).

**Implementation**: DOJ grants to law enforcement agencies for deflection program design, training, and operation. Partnership agreements between police departments and community treatment providers. Training curriculum for officers on harm reduction, trauma-informed response, and referral procedures.

**Cost/Resources**: $500 million annually in DOJ grants. Average cost per deflection: $2,000-5,000 (compared to $10,000+ per arrest/prosecution cycle).

**Timeline**: Grant program operational within 12 months; 1,000+ participating departments within 3 years.

**Challenges**: Law enforcement culture resistant to non-arrest responses; requires buy-in from police leadership; treatment provider capacity in the community.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of deflections; treatment enrollment rate post-deflection; overdose death rates in participating jurisdictions; arrest rates for drug possession.

### Solution 7: Harm Reduction Infrastructure Act

**Description**: Establish federal funding and legal protections for a comprehensive harm reduction infrastructure including: (a) naloxone distribution at no cost through pharmacies, community organizations, and vending machines; (b) syringe service programs in every state; (c) fentanyl test strip legalization and distribution; (d) supervised consumption sites (overdose prevention centers) authorized through a federal pilot program; (e) drug checking services where individuals can test substances for contaminants and potency.

**Evidence Base**: Naloxone has reversed over 100,000 overdoses from 2017-2023 (CDC, 2024). Syringe service programs reduce HIV transmission by 50% or more without increasing drug use (CDC, 2019). Supervised consumption sites -- operating in 14 countries -- have recorded zero overdose deaths at any official site worldwide (Drug Policy Alliance, 2024). New York City's two overdose prevention centers reversed over 1,000 overdoses in their first two years of operation with zero deaths (NYC Health, 2024).

**Implementation**: Federal grants to states, counties, and community organizations. Amendment to the Federal Analogue Act to explicitly legalize fentanyl test strips. HHS-authorized pilot program for supervised consumption sites in 10 cities.

**Cost/Resources**: $1.5 billion annually. Naloxone distribution: $500 million; syringe services: $200 million; supervised consumption pilots: $300 million; drug checking: $100 million; administrative: $400 million.

**Timeline**: Naloxone and test strip programs within 12 months; syringe services and drug checking within 24 months; supervised consumption pilots within 36 months.

**Challenges**: Supervised consumption sites face legal barriers under federal "crack house statute" (21 U.S.C. Section 856); political opposition in conservative jurisdictions; NIMBY resistance to siting harm reduction facilities.

**Impact Metrics**: Overdose deaths averted; naloxone kits distributed; HIV and hepatitis C incidence among PWID; supervised consumption site utilization.

## International Models

### Portugal: Comprehensive Decriminalization (2001)

**Description**: Portugal decriminalized personal possession and use of all drugs, replacing criminal penalties with administrative proceedings before Dissuasion Commissions. Simultaneously invested heavily in treatment, harm reduction, and social reintegration services.

**Results**: Drug-related deaths stable at ~74/year (2022), well below EU average. HIV infections among PWID declined >90%. Drug use rates below EU average. Drug offenders as share of prison population fell from ~44% to ~15%. Treatment enrollment increased 41% (EMCDDA, 2023; SICAD, 2023).

**Applicability to U.S.**: Portugal's universal healthcare system facilitated treatment access; the U.S. would need to build parallel infrastructure through Medicaid expansion and federal grants. Portugal's small size (10.3 million people) enabled centralized implementation; the U.S. federal system requires a more decentralized approach. The Dissuasion Commission model is directly transferable with adaptation.

### Czech Republic: Threshold-Based Decriminalization (2010)

**Description**: Established substance-specific quantity thresholds below which possession is a misdemeanor (administrative offense) rather than a criminal offense. Each drug has a defined "greater than small" quantity.

**Results**: Drug use rates stable; cannabis use slightly above EU average but no increase attributable to decriminalization. Drug-related deaths remained low (~50/year for a country of 10.7 million). No significant increase in drug tourism or dealing (EMCDDA, 2023).

**Applicability to U.S.**: The threshold system is directly applicable and provides a clear model for the proposed U.S. threshold schedule. The Czech system demonstrates that substance-specific thresholds can function without producing enforcement problems.

### Switzerland: Heroin-Assisted Treatment (1994)

**Description**: While not full decriminalization, Switzerland pioneered heroin-assisted treatment (HAT) -- medical-grade heroin prescribed to people with severe opioid use disorder who have not responded to other treatments. The program includes supervised consumption in clinical settings.

**Results**: Crime among participants reduced by 60%. Employment doubled. Illicit heroin use declined. Zero overdose deaths among program participants. Cost-effective when compared to criminal justice alternatives ($30/day HAT vs. $125/day incarceration) (Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, 2022).

**Applicability to U.S.**: HAT is legally prohibited in the United States under the CSA. Enabling HAT would require legislative change. However, the model demonstrates the effectiveness of medical approaches to severe addiction and complements decriminalization by providing treatment pathways for the hardest-to-reach populations.

## Pilot Programs and Demonstrations

- **Gloucester, MA Angel Program** (2015-present): Self-referral deflection allowing anyone to request treatment through the police department. Over 4,000 people connected to treatment. 17% completion rate (comparable to non-criminal-justice referrals).
- **New York City Overdose Prevention Centers** (2021-present): Two supervised consumption sites operating legally under city authorization. Over 1,000 overdoses reversed. Zero deaths. Demonstration that supervised consumption is operationally feasible in the U.S.
- **Seattle LEAD Program** (2011-present): Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion program allowing officers to divert low-level drug and prostitution offenders to case management. 58% reduction in recidivism. Cost savings of $2.40 for every $1 invested (University of Washington, 2017).
- **California Proposition 47** (2014): Defelonized drug possession. Reduced state prison population by ~10,000. $150 million annual savings reinvested in treatment, mental health, and victim services. No measurable increase in crime (Public Policy Institute of California, 2018).
