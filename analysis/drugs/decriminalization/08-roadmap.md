# Drug Decriminalization: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

The implementation strategy is organized around a central lesson from Oregon's Measure 110: treatment infrastructure must precede or accompany decriminalization to avoid political backlash and ensure that individuals diverted from the criminal justice system have somewhere to go. The three phases of this roadmap follow a "build, bridge, transform" sequence: Phase 1 builds treatment capacity and deploys quick-win programs that demonstrate effectiveness; Phase 2 bridges the criminal-civil divide through federal and state decriminalization legislation; Phase 3 transforms the system at scale, achieving treatment on demand and full criminal record expungement. Each phase builds political support for the next by generating measurable outcomes.

## Phase 1: Foundation Building (Years 1-2)

### Objectives

- Build treatment infrastructure to reduce the treatment gap from 76% to 60%
- Deploy deflection programs in 500+ law enforcement agencies
- Remove federal barriers to harm reduction tools
- Begin automatic expungement of federal drug possession records
- Generate evidence base for decriminalization through pilot programs

### Key Actions

### Expected Outcomes

Phase 1 produces the infrastructure and evidence base for Phase 2. By the end of Year 2: treatment wait times reduced from 25 days to <14 days in participating states; 500+ police departments operating deflection programs; 15 million naloxone kits distributed annually; 500,000+ federal records expunged; independent evaluation of Oregon providing lessons for national design; and 10 pilot states testing decriminalization models with built-in evaluation.

## Governance and Oversight

- **ONDCP Coordination**: The Office of National Drug Control Policy would coordinate implementation across DOJ, HHS, SAMHSA, DEA, and state agencies, publishing annual implementation reports
- **Congressional Oversight**: Semi-annual reports to the Senate Judiciary Committee and House Judiciary Committee, with GAO audits every two years
- **Independent Evaluation**: A permanent Drug Policy Evaluation Office (created in Phase 3) would conduct ongoing, independent assessment of decriminalization outcomes using randomized and quasi-experimental designs
- **State-Level Accountability**: States receiving treatment infrastructure grants would be required to submit annual reports on treatment capacity, wait times, enrollment, and outcomes, with funding adjustments based on performance
- **Racial Equity Monitoring**: All civil citation systems would be required to collect and publicly report data on citations by race, ethnicity, geography, and income, with mandatory corrective action plans if disparities exceed defined thresholds

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Political Backlash from Visible Public Drug Use

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Ensure Phase 1 builds treatment and outreach capacity before Phase 2 removes criminal penalties. Include public use prohibitions in decriminalization legislation (private possession decriminalized, public consumption subject to civil fines). Fund street outreach teams to connect visibly affected individuals to services.

**Contingency Plan**: If backlash occurs in specific jurisdictions, deploy rapid-response technical assistance teams to improve service delivery and outreach. Pause Phase 2 expansion in jurisdictions that have not met Phase 1 treatment capacity benchmarks.

### Risk 2: Fentanyl-Driven Overdose Surge During Implementation

**Likelihood**: Medium-High

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Front-load naloxone distribution and harm reduction investment in Phase 1, before decriminalization takes effect. Ensure fentanyl test strip legalization is an immediate priority. Fund supervised consumption site pilots to provide safer use environments.

**Contingency Plan**: If overdose deaths increase in pilot states beyond national trends, conduct rapid evaluation to determine whether the increase is attributable to decriminalization or to supply-side factors (fentanyl availability). Adjust implementation pace accordingly.

### Risk 3: Threshold Exploitation by Low-Level Dealers

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Include "totality of circumstances" provisions allowing intent-to-distribute charges based on packaging, cash, communications, frequency of contact, and other evidence regardless of quantity. Set thresholds based on pharmacological evidence to cover genuine personal use while making commercial quantities subject to criminal penalties.

**Contingency Plan**: If threshold exploitation is documented, convene scientific advisory panel to review and adjust thresholds. Enhance law enforcement training on totality-of-circumstances investigations.

### Risk 4: Treatment Infrastructure Delays (Oregon Repeat)

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Require states to meet treatment capacity benchmarks before activating decriminalization provisions. Build treatment infrastructure using block grants disbursed 12-18 months before decriminalization takes effect. Use existing SAMHSA grantee networks for rapid deployment.

**Contingency Plan**: If treatment buildout lags, delay Phase 2 activation in affected states. Redirect underperforming state grants to states meeting benchmarks.

### Risk 5: Federal-State Legal Conflicts

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Draft federal decriminalization legislation with clear preemption provisions establishing that state laws may be more lenient but not more punitive than the federal civil penalty framework. Include savings clause preserving state authority over drug trafficking enforcement.

**Contingency Plan**: If legal challenges arise, DOJ provides amicus support for decriminalization provisions. Seek expedited Supreme Court review if circuit split develops.

## Resource Requirements

### Funding

| Phase | Estimated Cost | Funding Source | Notes |

- **Health assessment sites**: 1,000+ locations nationwide for civil citation health screenings, co-located with community health centers where possible.
- **Data systems**: National decriminalization data dashboard; inter-agency data sharing infrastructure; state reporting systems.
- **Training programs**: Addiction medicine fellowships; social work training expansions; law enforcement deflection training curriculum.
