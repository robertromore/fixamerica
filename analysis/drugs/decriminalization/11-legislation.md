# Drug Decriminalization: Legislation

## Overview

Drug decriminalization requires legislative action at both the federal and state levels. At the federal level, the Controlled Substances Act must be amended to reclassify simple possession of personal-use quantities from a criminal offense to a civil violation. At the state level -- where 95% of drug arrests occur -- model legislation can replace criminal penalties with civil citations, mandatory health assessments, and treatment referrals. This document provides draft legislative text for a federal decriminalization act, a companion treatment infrastructure act, and state model legislation, along with regulatory frameworks, legal analysis, and loopholes assessment.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for drug decriminalization. The federal government's authority to regulate controlled substances under the Commerce Clause (upheld in* Gonzales v. Raich*, 545 U.S. 1, 2005) extends to modifying penalties for drug possession. State legislatures have plenary authority over state criminal law and can reclassify drug possession penalties without constitutional amendment. The Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment (*Robinson v. California*, 370 U.S. 660, 1962, which held that criminalizing the status of addiction is unconstitutional) provides additional constitutional support for decriminalization.*

119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To amend the Controlled Substances Act to reclassify simple possession
of personal-use quantities of controlled substances as a civil
violation, establish a health-centered response system, expand treatment
infrastructure, and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Drug Decriminalization and Health
Response Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) According to the FBI Uniform Crime Reports (2023), the United
States makes approximately 1.5 million drug arrests annually, of
which approximately 87 percent (1.3 million) are for simple
possession rather than manufacturing or distribution.

(2) According to the SAMHSA National Survey on Drug Use and Health
(2024), 48.7 million Americans aged 12 or older had a substance
use disorder in 2023, but only approximately 24 percent received
any form of treatment.

(3) According to the ACLU (2020), Black Americans are 3.73 times
more likely to be arrested for cannabis possession than white
Americans despite comparable usage rates.

(4) According to the Vera Institute of Justice (2023), the annual
cost of drug-related incarceration in the United States exceeds
$47 billion at the federal, state, and local levels.

(5) Portugal's 2001 decriminalization of personal drug possession
has been associated with stable drug use rates, declining
drug-related deaths, and a greater than 90 percent reduction in
HIV infections among people who inject drugs, according to the
European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (2023).

(6) A systematic review published in The Lancet Public Health
(2020) found no significant increase in drug use associated with
drug decriminalization across 22 studies in multiple countries.

(7) The National Research Council (2014) found that the severity of
criminal penalties does not meaningfully deter drug use, and that
incarceration for drug offenses does not reduce substance use or
improve public safety outcomes.

(8) Oregon's 2020 decriminalization and 2024 partial reversal
demonstrated that decriminalization must be accompanied by
adequate treatment infrastructure and effective civil engagement
mechanisms to succeed.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:

(1) CIVIL CITATION.—The term "civil citation" means a written
notice issued by a law enforcement officer to an individual found
in possession of a controlled substance in a personal-use quantity,
as defined in the threshold schedule established under section 5,
that directs the individual to appear for a health assessment within
14 calendar days.

(2) CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE.—The term "controlled substance" has the
meaning given such term in section 102 of the Controlled Substances
Act (21 U.S.C. 802).

(3) HEALTH ASSESSMENT.—The term "health assessment" means an
evaluation conducted by a licensed counselor, social worker, or
other qualified health professional that screens for substance use
disorders, mental health conditions, and social service needs, and
produces a recommended care plan.

(4) PERSONAL-USE QUANTITY.—The term "personal-use quantity" means a
quantity of a controlled substance that does not exceed the threshold
established by the Secretary under section 5 for that substance.

(5) SECRETARY.—The term "Secretary" means the Secretary of Health
and Human Services.

(6) TREATMENT ON DEMAND.—The term "treatment on demand" means the
ability of any individual seeking publicly funded substance use
disorder treatment to begin evidence-based treatment within 72 hours
of initial contact with the treatment system.

SEC. 4. RECLASSIFICATION OF SIMPLE POSSESSION.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 844(a) of the Controlled Substances Act
(21 U.S.C. 844(a)) is amended by adding at the end the following:

"Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subsection, it
shall not be a criminal offense for any person to possess a
controlled substance in a personal-use quantity, as defined in the
threshold schedule established under section 5 of the Drug
Decriminalization and Health Response Act of 2026. Possession of a
personal-use quantity shall be subject to a civil citation as
provided in section 6 of that Act."

(b) TRAFFICKING UNAFFECTED.—Nothing in this Act shall be construed
to modify penalties for the manufacture, distribution, dispensing,
or possession with intent to distribute any controlled substance
under sections 841, 842, 843, or 846 of the Controlled Substances
Act (21 U.S.C. 841-843, 846).

(c) TOTALITY OF CIRCUMSTANCES.—An individual found in possession
of a quantity of a controlled substance at or below the personal-use
threshold may nonetheless be charged with possession with intent to
distribute under section 841 of the Controlled Substances Act if the
totality of the circumstances — including the manner of packaging,
the presence of drug paraphernalia associated with distribution, the
presence of large amounts of cash, communications evidence, and other
factors — establishes probable cause for intent to distribute.

SEC. 5. PERSONAL-USE QUANTITY THRESHOLDS.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—Not later than 180 days after the date of
enactment of this Act, the Secretary, in consultation with the
Attorney General and the Administrator of the Drug Enforcement
Administration, shall establish by regulation a schedule of
substance-specific personal-use quantity thresholds.

(b) CRITERIA.—In establishing thresholds under subsection (a), the
Secretary shall consider—
    (1) the pharmacological properties of each substance, including
    potency, typical dose ranges, and duration of effect;
    (2) international precedents, including the threshold systems
    of Portugal, the Czech Republic, and other nations;
    (3) public health data on use patterns and risk profiles;
    (4) the need to distinguish personal use from distribution; and
    (5) input from the National Institute on Drug Abuse, the
    Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and
    an independent scientific advisory panel appointed by the
    Secretary.

(c) REVIEW.—The Secretary shall review and, if appropriate, revise
the threshold schedule not less frequently than once every 3 years.

(d) INITIAL THRESHOLDS.—Until the Secretary publishes thresholds
under subsection (a), the following interim thresholds shall apply:
    (1) Cannabis: 28 grams dried flower or 8 grams concentrate.

    personal-use quantity shall—
        (A) confiscate and document the substance;
        (B) issue a civil citation directing the individual to
        appear for a health assessment within 14 calendar days; and
        (C) provide the individual with written information about
        available treatment and harm reduction services.
    (2) NO ARREST.—An individual issued a civil citation under this
    section shall not be arrested, booked, or detained solely on the
    basis of possession of a personal-use quantity.
    (3) NO CRIMINAL RECORD.—A civil citation issued under this
    section shall not constitute a criminal conviction or appear on
    any criminal background check.

(b) HEALTH ASSESSMENT.—
    (1) CONTENT.—The health assessment shall include—
        (A) screening for substance use disorders using validated
        instruments;
        (B) screening for co-occurring mental health conditions;
        (C) assessment of social service needs, including housing,
        employment, and family support;
        (D) development of a recommended care plan; and
        (E) referral to appropriate treatment, harm reduction, or
        social services.
    (2) VOLUNTARY TREATMENT.—Treatment participation recommended
    by the health assessment shall be voluntary. No individual shall
    be compelled to enter treatment as a result of a civil citation.
    (3) ASSESSMENT PROVIDERS.—Health assessments shall be conducted

under section 5.

(b) STATE GRANTS.—The Attorney General shall award grants to
States to establish or expand automated expungement processes for
State drug possession convictions. There is authorized to be
appropriated $500,000,000 for the 5-fiscal-year period beginning
with fiscal year 2027 for grants under this subsection.

(c) EFFECT OF EXPUNGEMENT.—An expunged record under this section

of enactment of this Act.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 2 (Findings)**: Establishes the evidentiary basis for decriminalization using current data from federal agencies, peer-reviewed research, and international evidence. Explicitly acknowledges Oregon's implementation lessons to address political concerns.
- **Section 4 (Reclassification)**: The core provision. Amends 21 U.S.C. Section 844(a) to exclude personal-use quantities from criminal penalties. Includes "totality of circumstances" provision to prevent threshold exploitation by dealers.
- **Section 5 (Thresholds)**: Establishes science-based thresholds through HHS rulemaking, with interim thresholds effective immediately. Three-year review cycle ensures thresholds remain current.
- **Section 6 (Civil Citation)**: Creates the health-centered response system: citation, confiscation, 14-day health assessment requirement, graduated fines for non-compliance. No arrest, no criminal record.
- **Section 7 (Treatment)**: $2.5 billion/year for 5 years in block grants tied to treatment-on-demand benchmarks. Addresses Oregon's core failure by building infrastructure simultaneously with decriminalization.
- **Section 8 (Expungement)**: Automatic federal record expungement plus state grants. Addresses historical harms of criminalization.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Enactment | Year 1 | Congress/President |
| Treatment infrastructure grants begin | Upon enactment | SAMHSA |
| HHS publishes threshold schedule | 18 months after enactment | HHS/DEA |
| Civil citation system activated | 18 months after enactment (or upon threshold publication) | DOJ/HHS |
| Federal record expungement completed | 24 months after enactment | DOJ/AOUSC |
| First annual report to Congress | 12 months after enactment | HHS |
| State expungement grants awarded | 12-18 months after enactment | DOJ |

**Regulatory Authority**: HHS has primary regulatory authority for thresholds and health assessments. DOJ has authority for civil citation enforcement and expungement. SAMHSA administers treatment grants.

**Challenges**:

- **Political viability**: Comprehensive decriminalization faces opposition from law enforcement groups and may be difficult to pass in Congress
- **Federal-state coordination**: States must adopt complementary civil penalty frameworks for the system to function effectively at the point of arrest (which is typically a state/local action)
- **Threshold exploitation**: Dealers may carry personal-use quantities; "totality of circumstances" provision mitigates but does not eliminate this risk

**Refinements**:

- **Phase-in option**: Congress could begin with cannabis and lower-schedule substances before extending to all controlled substances
- **State opt-in**: Framework could allow states to opt in to the civil citation system rather than mandating uniform application
- **Pilot program**: A 10-state pilot before national implementation would generate evidence and build political support

## State Model Legislation

### Model Drug Decriminalization and Health Response Act

**Purpose**: To replace criminal penalties for personal possession of controlled substances with civil citations and mandatory health assessments at the state level.

**Adaptability Notes**: States should customize thresholds based on local drug use patterns, treatment capacity, and political context. States without Medicaid expansion will need additional treatment funding. Rural states may need mobile health assessment units rather than fixed-location panels.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "[State] Drug
Decriminalization and Health Response Act of [Year]".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS.

(a) Approximately [number] residents of [State] are arrested
annually for drug possession, at an estimated cost of $[amount]
per arrest to State and local governments.

(b) Approximately [number] residents of [State] have a substance
use disorder, but only [percentage] receive treatment.

(c) Criminal penalties for drug possession have not reduced drug
use in [State] but have generated criminal records that impede
recovery, employment, and housing.

    (7) All other controlled substances: a quantity consistent
    with 10 typical single-use doses as determined by the
    [State Health Department].

(b) "Civil citation" means a written notice directing an
individual to appear for a health assessment.

(c) "Health assessment" means a screening for substance use
disorders and co-occurring conditions conducted by a qualified
professional, resulting in a recommended care plan.

SECTION 4. RECLASSIFICATION.

(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, possession of a
controlled substance in a personal-use quantity shall constitute
a civil violation and not a criminal offense.

(b) A person found in possession of a personal-use quantity shall
be issued a civil citation and directed to appear for a health
assessment within 14 calendar days.

(c) A person issued a civil citation shall not be arrested,
booked, or detained solely for possession of a personal-use
quantity.

(d) A civil citation shall not constitute a criminal conviction
and shall not appear on any criminal background check.

(e) This section shall not apply to possession with intent to
distribute, manufacture, or trafficking offenses, which remain
subject to existing criminal penalties.

SECTION 5. HEALTH ASSESSMENT AND RESPONSE.

(a) The [State Health Department] shall establish health
assessment panels in each county, staffed by licensed counselors,
social workers, or certified peer support specialists.

(b) The health assessment shall include screening for substance
use disorders, mental health conditions, and social service needs.

(c) The assessment panel shall develop a recommended care plan
and offer voluntary referral to treatment, harm reduction, or
social services.

SECTION 6. SANCTIONS.

(a) Failure to appear for a health assessment within 14 days
shall result in a civil fine: $250 (first), $500 (second),
$1,000 (third and subsequent).

(b) Fines shall be collected through civil mechanisms and shall
not result in arrest or incarceration.

(c) The [State] shall establish a hardship waiver process.

SECTION 7. TREATMENT INFRASTRUCTURE.

(a) The [State] shall appropriate not less than $[amount]
annually for treatment infrastructure expansion.

(b) The [State Health Department] shall achieve treatment on
demand (72-hour access) within 5 years of the effective date
of this Act.

SECTION 8. EXPUNGEMENT.

(a) Within 24 months of the effective date, all [State] criminal
records for simple drug possession of personal-use quantities
shall be automatically expunged.

SECTION 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on [date], provided that the [State
Health Department] certifies that health assessment panels are
operational in at least [percentage] of counties.
```

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: Department of Health and Human Services (federal); State Health Departments (state-level)

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **Threshold Schedule**: HHS to publish substance-specific personal-use quantity thresholds within 180 days, based on pharmacological evidence and international precedents. Notice-and-comment rulemaking under the APA.
2. **Health Assessment Standards**: HHS to publish standards for health assessment content, provider qualifications, and care plan development within 12 months. Coordination with SAMHSA.
3. **Data Collection and Reporting**: HHS to establish data collection requirements for civil citations, health assessments, treatment referrals, and outcomes disaggregated by race, ethnicity, and geography.
4. **Treatment Grant Allocation Formula**: SAMHSA to publish the block grant allocation formula within 6 months, incorporating SUD prevalence, treatment gap, overdose rates, and treatment capacity.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Civil Fines**: Graduated fines for failure to appear for health assessment ($250/$500/$1,000), collected through civil mechanisms (no arrest or incarceration)
- **Administrative Actions**: HHS monitoring of state grant compliance; funding adjustments for states failing to meet treatment-on-demand benchmarks
- **Private Right of Action**: None created by this Act. Individuals may challenge civil citations through existing administrative review processes.
- **Criminal Penalties**: Maintained for trafficking, manufacturing, and distribution under existing CSA sections 841-843 and 846

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Commerce Clause Authority**: Federal authority to regulate controlled substances under the Commerce Clause is well-established (*Gonzales v. Raich*, 545 U.S. 1, 2005). This authority extends to modifying the penalty structure for possession.

**Eighth Amendment**: The Supreme Court held in *Robinson v. California* (370 U.S. 660, 1962) that criminalizing the status of addiction violates the Eighth Amendment. Decriminalization is consistent with this holding and may be constitutionally required for individuals whose possession is incident to addiction.

**Equal Protection**: Current drug enforcement produces racial disparities (3.73x Black-white arrest ratio for cannabis). Decriminalization removes the mechanism producing these disparities. Civil citation systems must be monitored for equitable application.

**Due Process**: Civil fines for failure to appear for health assessments must include notice, opportunity to be heard, and hardship waiver provisions to satisfy due process requirements.

### Preemption

Federal decriminalization would preempt state laws that impose more severe penalties for personal-use possession (criminal penalties for conduct that is a civil violation under federal law). States would remain free to adopt more lenient approaches, including full legalization of specific substances. A savings clause would preserve state authority over trafficking and distribution enforcement.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance is ensured through: (1) mandatory HHS reporting on civil citation and health assessment data; (2) GAO audits of treatment grant expenditures; (3) Congressional oversight hearings; (4) racial equity monitoring with mandatory corrective action plans; and (5) treatment-on-demand benchmarks as conditions of grant funding.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| Threshold exploitation | Drug dealers carry personal-use quantities to avoid criminal charges, effectively operating below the enforcement radar | High | Section 4(c) "totality of circumstances" provision allows intent-to-distribute charges based on packaging, cash, communications, and other evidence regardless of quantity. Strengthen by requiring law enforcement training on circumstantial evidence gathering. |
| Citation non-compliance | Individuals may ignore civil citations and treat fines as a cost of doing business, undermining the engagement mechanism | High | Graduated fine structure ($250/$500/$1,000) with civil collection enforcement. Add: after 3 non-appearances, mandatory community service (50 hours) enforced through civil contempt. |
| Health assessment rubber-stamping | Assessment providers may conduct perfunctory screenings to process volume, failing to make meaningful treatment connections | Medium | HHS to establish minimum assessment duration (45 minutes), validated screening instrument requirements, and audit process. Tie provider funding to treatment referral follow-through rates. |
| Geographic arbitrage | Individuals cited in decriminalized jurisdictions may reside in non-decriminalized jurisdictions, complicating follow-up | Medium | Establish interstate compact for health assessment reciprocity. Allow health assessments to be completed in the individual's county of residence regardless of citation location. |
| Fentanyl threshold gaming | The 500mg fentanyl threshold may be too high given the drug's extreme potency (2mg is a lethal dose for non-tolerant individuals), potentially covering quantities with distribution potential | High | HHS scientific advisory panel should review the fentanyl threshold within 12 months of enactment. Consider dose-based (rather than weight-based) thresholds for ultra-potent synthetics. |
| Expungement gaps | Automated expungement may miss records in fragmented state databases, leaving some individuals with un-expunged records | Medium | Require states to conduct comprehensive database sweeps. Establish individual petition process as backstop for records missed by automated systems. |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| Treatment workforce shortage | Health assessment and treatment capacity limited by insufficient number of addiction counselors, social workers, and peer specialists | Decades of under-investment in behavioral health workforce; low wages; high burnout | Workforce development provisions in Section 7; loan forgiveness for addiction medicine professionals; expanded peer specialist certification |
| Rural access gaps | Rural communities lack treatment facilities and health assessment infrastructure | Geographic maldistribution of health services; low population density makes fixed facilities uneconomical | Mobile health assessment units; telehealth assessment options; hub-and-spoke treatment models |
| Voluntary treatment limitation | Health assessments result in voluntary treatment referrals; individuals may decline treatment | Ethical commitment to patient autonomy; coerced treatment raises human rights concerns | Graduated engagement: first citation = assessment; repeat citations = increasingly intensive outreach and engagement, though treatment itself remains voluntary |
| Public use not addressed | Decriminalization of possession does not directly address public drug use, which drives much of the political backlash | Separate policy question from possession decriminalization | Maintain civil penalties (fines) for public drug consumption as distinct from private possession. Fund street outreach teams. |
| Federal-state gap period | 18-month delay between enactment and activation of civil citation system creates an ambiguous enforcement period | Need for rulemaking and infrastructure development | Encourage states to adopt complementary legislation during the gap period. Issue DOJ guidance to federal prosecutors to exercise discretion during transition. |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Fentanyl threshold review**: Within 12 months of enactment, the HHS scientific advisory panel shall conduct a special review of the fentanyl and synthetic opioid threshold, considering dose-based (rather than weight-based) measurement and recommending adjustments.
2. **Citation compliance enhancement**: If health assessment completion rates fall below 50% in any state within the first 2 years, SAMHSA shall provide targeted technical assistance and the state shall implement enhanced outreach including mobile assessment teams and same-day walk-in assessment availability.
3. **Workforce development acceleration**: If treatment wait times exceed 14 days in any state after 3 years, SAMHSA shall activate emergency workforce grants for that state, including expedited peer specialist certification and temporary practice authority for trainees.
4. **Public use response**: HHS shall publish guidance within 12 months on distinguishing civil responses to private possession from responses to public drug consumption, ensuring that decriminalization does not preclude local enforcement against public use.
5. **Data system integration**: Within 24 months, HHS and DOJ shall establish an interoperable data system for tracking civil citations, health assessments, treatment referrals, and outcomes across jurisdictions, enabling real-time monitoring and adjustment.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

The treatment infrastructure authorization (Section 7) would be authorized for an initial 5-year period (FY2027-FY2031) with reauthorization required. The threshold schedule (Section 5) includes a mandatory 3-year review cycle. The civil citation system (Section 6) includes annual reporting requirements that provide ongoing data for Congressional evaluation. A comprehensive 5-year evaluation by GAO is required to assess overall program effectiveness before reauthorization.
