# Drug Decriminalization: Root Causes

## Systemic Analysis

The continued criminalization of drug possession in the United States -- despite decades of evidence that it fails to reduce drug use, disproportionately harms communities of color, and diverts resources from effective treatment -- is not the result of a single failure. It is the product of several interlocking structural, institutional, political, and cultural forces. These include the political economy of the criminal justice system, the moral framing of drug use, institutional inertia, racial dynamics, federalism constraints, and the genuine complexity of implementation.

## Structural and Institutional Causes

### The Criminal Justice System as Default Response

The United States has built an enormous institutional infrastructure around drug enforcement. Approximately 1.3 million drug possession arrests per year (FBI UCR, 2023) flow through a system of police departments, prosecutors' offices, courts, jails, prisons, and probation agencies that collectively employ millions of people and consume tens of billions of dollars annually. This infrastructure creates path dependency: once built, the criminal justice apparatus generates its own demand for continued activity.

**Evidence**: Federal, state, and local governments spend approximately $47 billion annually on drug incarceration alone (Vera Institute, 2023). The Drug Enforcement Administration employs over 10,000 personnel with an annual budget of $3.3 billion (FY2024). State and local drug enforcement units, drug courts, drug testing companies, bail bond agents, and prison phone service providers all depend on the continued criminalization of drug possession.

### Absence of Treatment Infrastructure

The U.S. treatment system is severely underdeveloped relative to need. With 48.7 million Americans experiencing a substance use disorder and only 24% receiving any treatment (SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024), the criminal justice system functions as the de facto response to addiction by default -- not because it works, but because treatment alternatives are unavailable. Oregon's experience demonstrated this vividly: decriminalization without treatment capacity produced public drug use without pathways to recovery.

**Evidence**: The average wait time for publicly funded drug treatment is 25 days (NSDUH supplement, 2023). Only 63% of treatment facilities accept Medicaid (SAMHSA N-SSATS, 2023). Rural areas in particular lack treatment infrastructure, with many counties having zero buprenorphine providers.

### Federal-State Misalignment

The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 establishes federal drug scheduling and penalties, but approximately 95% of drug arrests occur at the state and local level. This creates a fragmented system in which federal policy sets the framework of prohibition while state and local enforcement determines who is actually arrested and prosecuted. States that wish to decriminalize face the structural constraint that their actions cannot override federal law, creating legal uncertainty for individuals, businesses, and government agencies.

**Evidence**: Oregon's Measure 110 decriminalized drug possession under state law, but possession remained a federal offense. This created confusion among law enforcement, service providers, and the public about the legal status of drug possession.

## Political Economy

### Who Benefits from the Status Quo

| Actor | Benefit | Economic Value | Incentive to Block Reform |
|-------|---------|----------------|---------------------------|
| Private prison companies (CoreCivic, GEO Group) | Revenue from housing drug offenders | ~$4 billion combined annual revenue (FY2023) | Drug inmates represent significant share of population; decriminalization reduces census |
| Law enforcement agencies | Drug enforcement justifies budgets, equipment, personnel | Federal Byrne JAG grants ($442 million FY2024) tied to drug enforcement metrics | Loss of civil asset forfeiture revenue; reduced justification for staffing levels |
| Police unions | Drug arrests are high-volume, low-risk enforcement activity | Union dues from large officer complements | Decriminalization reduces officer demand and enforcement discretion |
| Bail bond industry | Drug possession charges generate bail revenue | ~$14 billion annual industry | Decriminalization eliminates arrest and pre-trial detention for possession |
| Drug testing companies | Workplace, court-ordered, and probation drug testing | ~$5 billion annual market | Decriminalization reduces court-ordered testing |
| Prosecutors' offices | Drug cases are high-volume, easily resolved through plea bargains | N/A (institutional prestige and political capital) | Drug cases provide conviction statistics used in reelection campaigns |
| Pharmaceutical companies | Criminalization of competitors (illicit drugs) maintains prescription monopoly | Opioid market: ~$19 billion annually | Legal substitutes for illicit drugs threaten market share |

### Perverse Incentives

The current system contains multiple incentive misalignments that perpetuate criminalization:

- **Civil asset forfeiture**: Law enforcement agencies can seize cash and property suspected of involvement in drug offenses without a criminal conviction. The DOJ's Assets Forfeiture Fund held $4.3 billion in net assets in FY2023, creating a direct financial incentive for drug enforcement.
- **Arrest metrics**: Police performance is often measured by arrest volume and clearance rates. Drug possession arrests are relatively easy to make and inflate these statistics, disincentivizing a shift to non-arrest responses.
- **Plea bargain efficiency**: Drug possession cases are typically resolved through plea bargains, allowing prosecutors to process high volumes of cases with minimal trial resources. This efficiency would be lost under decriminalization.
- **Federal grant incentives**: Programs like the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant and the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) program tie federal funding to drug enforcement activity, rewarding states and localities for maintaining criminalization.

## Political and Cultural Causes

### Moral Framing of Drug Use

American political culture has historically treated drug use as a moral failing rather than a health condition. This framing -- rooted in Protestant temperance traditions, amplified by War on Drugs rhetoric, and reinforced by media portrayals -- creates a political environment in which punishment feels intuitively appropriate and medical responses feel like "letting people off."

**Evidence**: In a 2023 Pew Research poll, 34% of Americans still said drug possession should always be treated as a crime. The phrase "tough on crime" remains a politically potent frame, and candidates who support decriminalization risk being characterized as "soft on drugs" -- a label that has derailed political careers.

### Racial Dynamics

The War on Drugs was designed, at least in part, as a tool of racial control. Because communities of color bear the disproportionate burden of drug enforcement (Black Americans are 3.73x more likely to be arrested for cannabis possession per the ACLU, 2020), the political costs of criminalization fall primarily on populations with less political power. White suburban voters -- who are more politically influential in most electoral systems -- experience drug enforcement less directly, reducing their motivation to demand reform.

**Evidence**: The crack-powder cocaine sentencing disparity (100:1 from 1986 to 2010, 18:1 thereafter) encoded racial disparities into law. Crack, used primarily in Black communities, carried penalties 100 times more severe than powder cocaine, used primarily by white individuals, for the same weight of substance.

### Fear of the "Sending a Message" Reversal

Politicians across the spectrum fear that supporting decriminalization will be interpreted as endorsing drug use. The "sending the wrong message" argument -- that decriminalizing possession signals societal approval -- persists despite evidence from Portugal and other countries that decriminalization does not increase drug use. This fear is amplified during overdose crises, when politicians feel pressure to appear to be "doing something" about drugs, and enforcement is more visible and politically legible than treatment investment.

**Evidence**: Oregon's recriminalization in 2024 was explicitly framed by legislators as "sending a message" that drug use is unacceptable, despite the lack of evidence that the message sent by Measure 110 had increased drug use rates in Oregon relative to other states.

## Institutional Inertia

### The Controlled Substances Act Framework

The CSA has been the foundation of U.S. drug policy for over 50 years. It establishes five schedules of controlled substances, with Schedule I (including heroin, LSD, cannabis, and psilocybin) defined as having "high potential for abuse" and "no currently accepted medical use." This framework is remarkably resistant to change because it is embedded in thousands of federal and state statutes, regulations, and institutional practices. Decriminalization requires not just a policy shift but a structural reorganization of how the government classifies, regulates, and responds to controlled substances.

### Professional and Institutional Cultures

Law enforcement agencies, prosecutors' offices, and judicial systems have developed professional cultures organized around drug enforcement. Officers are trained to detect and arrest drug offenders; prosecutors specialize in drug cases; judges manage drug dockets. Decriminalization asks these professionals to abandon core competencies and institutional identities.

**Evidence**: The National Association of Police Organizations, the National District Attorneys Association, and the National Sheriffs' Association have all opposed comprehensive drug decriminalization.

## Causal Chain

```text
Moral framing of drug use + racial politics
    ↓
War on Drugs creates massive criminal justice infrastructure

Treatment infrastructure remains underfunded (resources directed to enforcement)
    ↓
Without treatment alternatives, criminal justice remains the default response
    ↓
Criminal records trap individuals in cycles of poverty and substance use
    ↓
Continued drug use and visible public disorder reinforce moral framing

## Why Reform Has Failed

### Oregon's Measure 110 Failures

Oregon's 2020 decriminalization and 2024 reversal provides the clearest case study of reform failure. The core failures were:

1. **Implementation lag**: Cannabis tax revenue designated for treatment was delayed 18+ months by bureaucratic processes, leaving decriminalization in place without services
2. **Civil citation design failure**: The $100 citation with a phone call opt-out produced a near-zero engagement rate (~1% called the health assessment hotline)
3. **No accountability mechanism**: Without either criminal consequences or effective civil alternatives, there was no mechanism to connect individuals to treatment
4. **Political timing**: The measure took effect during the fentanyl surge, causing rising overdose deaths to be attributed (incorrectly but understandably) to decriminalization

### Broader Reform Challenges

- **Bipartisan coalitions are fragile**: The First Step Act coalition of progressives and libertarian-leaning conservatives holds on sentencing reform but fragments on decriminalization
- **Public opinion is ahead of legislators on principle but behind on specifics**: 66% support ending arrest for drug possession (Pew, 2024), but support drops when specific drugs (heroin, methamphetamine) are named
- **Media coverage amplifies disorder**: Stories of public drug use and open-air drug markets dominate coverage, while the quieter benefits of treatment expansion receive less attention
