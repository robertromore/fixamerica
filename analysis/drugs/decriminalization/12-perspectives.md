# Drug Decriminalization: Political Perspectives Analysis

## Overview

Drug decriminalization raises fundamental questions about the role of government in regulating personal behavior, the balance between public safety and individual liberty, the proper response to addiction as a health condition versus a moral failing, and the racial equity implications of criminal enforcement. Few policy areas produce such complex cross-cutting alignments: libertarians and progressives may agree on ending criminal penalties while disagreeing on the role of government in treatment; conservatives may oppose decriminalization on moral grounds while supporting treatment investment on fiscal grounds; populists may demand harsh penalties for dealers while sympathizing with users in their communities.

Different political traditions offer distinct visions for how to approach drug decriminalization. This analysis examines the issue through nine distinct political perspectives, exploring how each tradition approaches the core questions and proposed solutions.

## Scoring Framework

### Position Scores (1-10)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10 | Full agreement with project analysis |
| 7-9 | Substantial to strong agreement |
| 5-6 | Mixed/moderate agreement |
| 3-4 | Substantial disagreement |
| 1-2 | Strong opposition |

### Engagement Consistency (1-5)

This metric assesses how reliably a perspective's stated positions align with its underlying principles, and how stable those positions are when concerns are addressed. Higher scores indicate more predictable negotiating partners.

| Level | Label | Indicators |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 5 | Highly Consistent | Stated positions reflect underlying principles; positions stable when concerns addressed |
| 4 | Mostly Consistent | Principles generally align with positions; minor strategic flexibility |
| 3 | Mixed Consistency | Some positions principled, others reflect coalition pressures or unstated concerns |
| 2 | Low Consistency | Positions shift frequently; stated concerns differ from underlying priorities |
| 1 | Unpredictable | Positions appear driven primarily by opposition dynamics rather than principles |

### Legislation Status Reference (as of January 2025)

## Perspective Analyses

### Conservative Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Stated concern is public safety and moral order; underlying priority often includes maintaining law enforcement authority and electoral positioning as "tough on crime" |
| Principle consistency | Limited government and individual liberty principles would logically support decriminalization, but these principles are selectively applied to drug policy |
| Goalpost stability | Goalposts have shifted: conservatives supported the First Step Act (2018) sentencing reform but oppose broader decriminalization; the boundary between acceptable and unacceptable reform is politically rather than principally determined |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate; some conservatives engage constructively on treatment funding while opposing decriminalization |

**Justification:** Conservatives demonstrate mixed consistency on drug decriminalization because their stated principles (limited government, individual responsibility, fiscal conservatism) logically support reducing the government's role in punishing personal drug use, but their political positioning and law enforcement alliances pull in the opposite direction. The opioid crisis has created openness to treatment investment but not to removing criminal penalties.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- The First Step Act (2018), signed by President Trump with bipartisan support, demonstrated conservative willingness to reduce drug sentences -- but only for existing prisoners, not for prospective decriminalization
- Heritage Foundation policy papers emphasize "accountability" and oppose decriminalization while supporting expanded drug courts and faith-based treatment
- Conservative governors in red states (e.g., Oklahoma's Kevin Stitt) have signed defelonization legislation, suggesting openness to reducing severity but not eliminating criminal penalties

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Agree with data on treatment gap and overdose deaths; dispute emphasis on racial disparities as evidence of systemic problems; emphasize individual responsibility over structural causes |
| Root Cause Agreement | 3/10 | Reject framing that criminalization is the root cause; attribute drug problems to family breakdown, cultural decline, and individual choices rather than policy failures |

**Source references:**

- Heritage Foundation. "The Wrong Approach: Drug Decriminalization." 2021. Argues criminalization provides necessary structure for recovery.
- American Conservative Union scorecard positions on drug policy votes.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Federal Decriminalization | 2/10 | Opposes: "Sends wrong message; removes accountability for drug use" | Loss of law enforcement authority; vulnerability to "soft on crime" attacks |
| Treatment Infrastructure | 7/10 | Supports: "Treatment is preferable to incarceration when fiscally responsible" | Treatment must include faith-based options; cost must be offset by enforcement savings |
| Possession Thresholds | 3/10 | Opposes: "Creates safe harbor for dealers carrying small amounts" | Concern about enabling drug markets; preference for enforcement discretion |
| Civil Citation System | 3/10 | Skeptical: "Fines without teeth; no real consequences for drug use" | Preference for drug courts that maintain criminal justice leverage |
| Expungement | 4/10 | Cautiously supportive for marijuana only: "Cannabis records should be cleared, but not hard drug convictions" | Concern about erasing accountability; openness limited to cannabis |
| Deflection Programs | 7/10 | Supports: "Police-led diversion is better than removing police entirely" | Maintains law enforcement role; compatible with tough-on-crime positioning |
| Harm Reduction | 3/10 | Opposes supervised consumption; cautiously supports naloxone: "Saving lives yes, enabling drug use no" | Moral objection to facilitating drug use; support for overdose reversal |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Drug Decriminalization and Health Response Act | 2/10 | "Goes too far; removes all accountability" | Would undermine law enforcement; political liability |
| Model State Decriminalization Act | 2/10 | "State-level decriminalization failed in Oregon" | Uses Oregon as evidence against the approach |

#### Alternative Proposals

Conservatives would support: expanded drug courts with mandatory treatment; increased funding for faith-based recovery programs; enhanced penalties for fentanyl trafficking; deflection programs that maintain police discretion and criminal justice backup; and defelonization (reducing possession from felony to misdemeanor) as a compromise position short of full decriminalization.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Libertarian (on limited government grounds), Centrist (on fiscal responsibility)
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (on treatment for affected communities), Liberal (on treatment funding)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist (fundamental disagreement on criminalization role)

### Liberal Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Stated concerns about racial equity and public health genuinely reflect underlying values; some caution driven by electoral vulnerability on "crime" issues |
| Principle consistency | Government responsibility for public health and racial equity consistently supports decriminalization; may hesitate on all-drug decriminalization for political reasons |
| Goalpost stability | Positions have moved steadily toward decriminalization over the past decade; unlikely to reverse |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low; generally willing to compromise on implementation details |

**Justification:** Liberals demonstrate mostly consistent support for decriminalization because their core values -- government responsibility for public health, racial equity, evidence-based policy -- all point toward replacing criminal penalties with health responses. Minor inconsistency arises from electoral caution; some liberal politicians hesitate to fully embrace decriminalization for fear of "soft on crime" attacks.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Democratic Party platform (2020) included support for drug decriminalization and treatment over incarceration
- Liberal DAs (Bragg in Manhattan, Krasner in Philadelphia) have implemented non-prosecution policies for drug possession
- Biden administration removed the X-waiver requirement for buprenorphine prescribing and issued a National Drug Control Strategy emphasizing harm reduction (2022)

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Strong agreement with data on treatment gap, racial disparities, and enforcement costs; may emphasize racial equity dimensions even more |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | Agree that criminalization is a root cause; emphasize systemic racism and pharmaceutical industry culpability; may add more focus on social determinants |

**Source references:**

- Center for American Progress. "Ending the War on Drugs." 2020. Supports decriminalization and treatment investment.
- Democratic Party Platform (2020). Section on criminal justice reform.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Federal Decriminalization | 8/10 | Supports: "Health issue, not a criminal issue" | Wants to ensure robust treatment infrastructure accompanies decriminalization |
| Treatment Infrastructure | 9/10 | Strongly supports: "Government must invest in treatment for all" | Would prefer larger investment; wants Medicaid expansion linked |
| Possession Thresholds | 7/10 | Supports: "Science-based thresholds are appropriate" | Wants thresholds set generously to avoid re-criminalizing users |
| Civil Citation System | 8/10 | Supports: "Health assessments are the right response" | Wants to ensure fines don't disproportionately burden low-income individuals |
| Expungement | 9/10 | Strongly supports: "People deserve a second chance; records must be cleared" | Wants broadest possible expungement including felony drug convictions |
| Deflection Programs | 7/10 | Supports: "Useful bridge, but shouldn't replace full decriminalization" | Concerned about maintaining police as gatekeepers to health services |
| Harm Reduction | 9/10 | Strongly supports including supervised consumption: "Save lives first" | Wants comprehensive harm reduction without exceptions |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Drug Decriminalization and Health Response Act | 8/10 | "Good framework; would strengthen treatment funding" | May seek larger appropriations; wants stronger equity provisions |
| Model State Decriminalization Act | 8/10 | "Important for states to lead" | Wants federal action to accompany state reform |

#### Alternative Proposals

Liberals would additionally support: Medicaid expansion requirements as a condition of decriminalization; racial equity impact assessments for all civil citation systems; cannabis legalization (beyond decriminalization) with social equity provisions; and pharmaceutical industry accountability measures.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist (shared values on health and equity)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (evidence-based approach), Libertarian (personal liberty)
- **Unlikely partners:** Religious Right (fundamental value differences on drug use morality)

---

### Progressive Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Stated concerns about racial justice, structural inequality, and public health genuinely reflect underlying priorities |
| Principle consistency | Decriminalization is a natural extension of consistent positions on mass incarceration, racial equity, and public health |
| Goalpost stability | Positions are stable and have been consistent for over a decade; will push for more, not less, reform |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low; willing to accept incremental steps while advocating for transformative change |

**Justification:** Progressives are the most consistent advocates for drug decriminalization because the position directly follows from their core analysis: the War on Drugs is a tool of racial and economic oppression that produces mass incarceration, and the alternative -- health-centered responses -- aligns with their vision of robust public services.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Congressional Progressive Caucus has consistently supported drug decriminalization legislation
- Progressive organizations (Drug Policy Alliance, ACLU) have led decriminalization campaigns for two decades
- Progressive DA movement (Krasner, Boudin, Gascon) implemented non-prosecution policies for drug possession

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strong agreement; would emphasize structural racism and class dimensions even more prominently |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | Deep agreement with systemic analysis; would additionally emphasize capitalism and profit motives in maintaining criminalization |

**Source references:**

- Congressional Progressive Caucus drug policy positions
- Drug Policy Alliance policy platform
- ACLU. "A Tale of Two Countries: Racially Targeted Arrests in the Era of Marijuana Reform." 2020.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Federal Decriminalization | 9/10 | Strongly supports: "Essential step toward ending the War on Drugs" | Would go further -- supports full legalization and regulation of all drugs |
| Treatment Infrastructure | 9/10 | Strongly supports: "Universal treatment is a right, not a privilege" | Wants universal healthcare as the delivery mechanism, not block grants |
| Possession Thresholds | 7/10 | Supports but prefers higher limits: "Set thresholds to protect users, not to create new enforcement tools" | Concerned thresholds may still criminalize people of color disproportionately |
| Civil Citation System | 7/10 | Supports with caveats: "Must not recreate racial disparities in civil form" | Wants strong equity monitoring; opposes any fines that burden low-income people |
| Expungement | 10/10 | Strongest support: "Full expungement plus reparative investment in affected communities" | Wants expungement paired with community reinvestment and reparations |
| Deflection Programs | 6/10 | Cautious: "Police should not be gatekeepers to health services" | Prefers community-based alternatives to police-led programs |
| Harm Reduction | 10/10 | Full support: "Every tool that saves lives should be available" | Would expand to include heroin-assisted treatment and safe supply programs |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Drug Decriminalization and Health Response Act | 7/10 | "Good start but doesn't go far enough; should include community investment" | Wants larger appropriations, community reparations, police role minimized |
| Model State Decriminalization Act | 7/10 | "Useful tool but must include equity provisions" | Wants mandatory racial equity impact assessments |

#### Alternative Proposals

Progressives would additionally support: full legalization and regulation of all drugs with public health framework; reparative community investment in neighborhoods most harmed by the War on Drugs; elimination of police role in drug response (replaced by health workers); safe supply programs providing pharmaceutical-grade alternatives to street drugs; and abolition of the DEA with reallocation of its budget to SAMHSA.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberal, Democratic Socialist (shared systemic analysis)
- **Potential bridges:** Libertarian (personal liberty overlap), Centrist (evidence-based common ground)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative, Religious Right (fundamental disagreement on government role and morality)

### Libertarian Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Stated concern about individual liberty and government overreach genuinely reflects core principles |
| Principle consistency | Opposition to drug criminalization is among the most consistent libertarian positions across decades |
| Goalpost stability | Stable; libertarians have supported drug decriminalization/legalization since the party's founding |
| Zero-sum behavior | Very low; willing to support any reduction in government control over personal behavior |

**Justification:** Libertarians are the most philosophically consistent perspective on drug decriminalization because their opposition to government regulation of personal behavior is foundational and long-standing. They would go further than decriminalization to full legalization, but strongly support any step that reduces state power over individual drug use.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Libertarian Party platform has included drug legalization since 1972
- Cato Institute published foundational analysis of Portugal's decriminalization (Greenwald, 2009)
- Reason Foundation consistently advocates for drug policy reform on liberty grounds

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 7/10 | Agree with data on enforcement costs and individual harm from criminalization; less emphasis on racial disparities as systemic issue; frame as government overreach |
| Root Cause Agreement | 6/10 | Agree that criminalization is the problem; disagree with framing that emphasizes government solutions (treatment infrastructure) as the answer; prefer market-based alternatives |

**Source references:**

- Cato Institute. "Drug Decriminalization in Portugal." 2009.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Federal Decriminalization | 9/10 | Strongly supports: "Government has no right to criminalize what individuals put in their bodies" | Would prefer full legalization with no civil penalties whatsoever |
| Treatment Infrastructure | 4/10 | Skeptical: "Government-funded treatment creates dependency on the state" | Prefers private, voluntary, market-based treatment; opposes large federal spending |
| Possession Thresholds | 6/10 | Mixed: "Better than criminalization, but government shouldn't define 'personal use'" | Philosophically opposed to government determining what quantity an individual may possess |
| Civil Citation System | 5/10 | Ambivalent: "Civil fines are better than jail, but still government overreach" | Prefers no government response to personal drug use at all |
| Expungement | 9/10 | Strongly supports: "Criminal records for victimless crimes are unjust" | Consistent with opposition to criminalization |
| Deflection Programs | 5/10 | Mixed: "Reduces harm of enforcement, but maintains police involvement in a health issue" | Prefers no police role whatsoever |
| Harm Reduction | 7/10 | Supports: "People should have access to tools that reduce harm from their own choices" | Opposes government funding; supports private/nonprofit provision |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Drug Decriminalization and Health Response Act | 5/10 | "Decriminalization provisions are excellent; $25 billion government spending is excessive" | Supports removing criminal penalties; opposes large federal programs |
| Model State Decriminalization Act | 6/10 | "State-level action is preferable to federal; but still too much government" | Prefers state action over federal, but dislikes government-run health assessment systems |

#### Alternative Proposals

Libertarians would support: full drug legalization with no government penalties for production, sale, or use; elimination of the DEA; tax-funded treatment only through voluntary insurance markets; private certification and quality control for drug products; and elimination of all drug scheduling.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive (on ending criminalization), Liberal (on personal liberty)
- **Potential bridges:** Conservative (on limited government), Constitutionalist (on federalism)
- **Unlikely partners:** Religious Right (on moral regulation), Populist (on enforcement preferences)

---

### Constitutionalist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine concern about federal overreach and enumerated powers; consistent application to drug policy |
| Principle consistency | Federalism principles consistently support state authority over drug policy; may diverge on whether states should criminalize |
| Goalpost stability | Stable; federalism positions are long-held |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low; willing to engage on structural questions |

**Justification:** Constitutionalists consistently apply federalism principles to drug policy, arguing that the Constitution does not grant the federal government authority to criminalize drug possession and that this power should reside with the states. This analysis is constitutionally grounded and largely stable, though some constitutionalists may personally favor criminalization at the state level.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Dissenting opinion in *Gonzales v. Raich* (Thomas, J.) argued federal drug regulation exceeds Commerce Clause authority
- Tenth Amendment Center consistently opposes federal drug scheduling authority
- Several constitutionalist legal scholars argue the CSA exceeds enumerated powers

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Agree that federal drug enforcement is constitutionally questionable; less focused on racial disparities or public health data |
| Root Cause Agreement | 5/10 | Agree that federal overreach through the CSA is a root cause; disagree with framing that implies federal government should solve the problem through new programs |

**Source references:**

- Justice Thomas, dissent in *Gonzales v. Raich*, 545 U.S. 1 (2005)
- Tenth Amendment Center drug policy publications
- Barnett, R.E. "The Original Meaning of the Commerce Clause." *University of Chicago Law Review* 68 (2001).

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Federal Decriminalization | 6/10 | Mixed: "Federal government shouldn't criminalize drug possession, but also shouldn't preempt state choices" | Supports federal restraint; opposes federal mandates on states |
| Treatment Infrastructure | 4/10 | Skeptical: "Treatment is a state responsibility; federal block grants expand federal power" | Tenth Amendment concerns about federal involvement in state health policy |
| Possession Thresholds | 4/10 | Opposes federal thresholds: "States should set their own threshold levels" | Federal threshold schedule seen as usurping state legislative authority |
| Civil Citation System | 4/10 | "If states want to create civil citation systems, that is their prerogative, not the federal government's" | Supports state innovation; opposes federal mandates |
| Expungement | 6/10 | Supports federal expungement of federal records only: "Federal government can expunge its own records; should not mandate state action" | Respects state sovereignty over state records |
| Deflection Programs | 5/10 | "Voluntary programs through DOJ grants are acceptable; mandates are not" | Distinguishes between voluntary and mandated federal programs |
| Harm Reduction | 5/10 | "States should decide whether to allow these services" | Opposes federal authorization as overreach; supports state experimentation |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Drug Decriminalization and Health Response Act | 4/10 | "Correctly limits federal criminal penalties, but creates excessive new federal programs" | Approves of Section 4 (decriminalization); opposes Sections 5-7 (federal thresholds and treatment mandates) |
| Model State Decriminalization Act | 7/10 | "State-level action is the appropriate venue for drug policy reform" | Strongly prefers state-level reform over federal legislation |

#### Alternative Proposals

Constitutionalists would support: repeal or significant narrowing of the Controlled Substances Act's federal possession provisions; returning drug policy authority to states under the Tenth Amendment; federal non-interference with state decriminalization experiments; and individual state decisions on criminal vs. civil responses without federal mandates.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Libertarian (federalism and limited government), Conservative (states' rights)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (incremental reform), Progressive (on ending federal criminalization)
- **Unlikely partners:** Democratic Socialist (fundamental disagreement on federal program expansion)

### Populist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 2/5 - Low Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Stated concern is protecting communities from drugs; underlying priorities include cultural identity and anti-elite sentiment |
| Principle consistency | Populist positions on drugs are internally contradictory: sympathize with users in their communities while demanding harsh penalties |
| Goalpost stability | Unstable; positions shift based on political winds, media narratives, and which communities are affected |
| Zero-sum behavior | High; tends to view drug policy as us-vs-them (communities vs. dealers/elites) |

**Justification:** Populists demonstrate low consistency on drug decriminalization because their positions are driven by emotional identification with affected communities rather than coherent principles. They sympathize with opioid-addicted rural Americans (who are "our people") while supporting harsh enforcement against drug traffickers and dealers. This creates an internally contradictory position: support for treatment but opposition to removing the criminal framework that criminalizes the same users they sympathize with.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- President Trump signed the First Step Act (sentencing reform) and the SUPPORT Act (opioid treatment) while simultaneously calling for the death penalty for drug dealers
- Populist media figures (Tucker Carlson, J.D. Vance) frame drug policy as cultural warfare rather than evidence-based analysis
- Populist constituencies in Appalachia and rural Midwest simultaneously demand treatment access and law enforcement action

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Agree that drug crisis is devastating communities; blame cartels, China, and elites rather than structural policy failure; downplay racial disparities |
| Root Cause Agreement | 3/10 | Reject systemic analysis; attribute drug problems to foreign actors (cartels, Chinese fentanyl labs), cultural decline, and elite neglect of working-class communities |

**Source references:**

- Vance, J.D. *Hillbilly Elegy* (2016). Frames drug crisis in cultural and community terms.
- Trump Administration SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act (2018)
- Fox News/populist media framing of fentanyl crisis as border security issue

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Federal Decriminalization | 2/10 | Opposes: "We need to be tougher on drugs, not weaker" | Views decriminalization as elite permissiveness; threatens cultural identity |
| Treatment Infrastructure | 7/10 | Supports: "Our communities need help, not more drugs" | Treatment must be accessible to working-class communities; not just urban areas |
| Possession Thresholds | 2/10 | Opposes: "This lets drug dealers walk free" | Views thresholds as protecting criminals |
| Civil Citation System | 3/10 | Skeptical: "A $100 fine is a joke" | Wants meaningful consequences for drug use |
| Expungement | 4/10 | Mixed: "Marijuana records yes; fentanyl and heroin records no" | Sympathetic to marijuana users; hostile to "hard drug" users |
| Deflection Programs | 6/10 | Supports: "Police should help people get clean" | Maintains police role; consistent with community protection frame |
| Harm Reduction | 3/10 | Opposes supervised consumption; tepid on naloxone: "We need to stop drugs from coming in, not make them safer to use" | Frames harm reduction as defeatism |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Drug Decriminalization and Health Response Act | 2/10 | "Soft on drugs; wrong signal during fentanyl crisis" | Views as elite-driven policy that ignores community safety concerns |
| Model State Decriminalization Act | 3/10 | "States that want to try this can, but most won't" | Prefers local control but doesn't support the policy |

#### Alternative Proposals

Populists would support: death penalty or severe mandatory minimums for fentanyl trafficking; border wall and enhanced border enforcement to stop drug supply; treatment investment focused on rural and working-class communities; holding pharmaceutical companies (Purdue Pharma, Sackler family) criminally accountable; and drug testing for welfare recipients.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (on enforcement), Religious Right (on moral framework)
- **Potential bridges:** Liberal (on treatment investment), Centrist (on treatment focus)
- **Unlikely partners:** Libertarian (fundamental disagreement on enforcement), Progressive (on enforcement approach)

---

### Centrist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine commitment to evidence-based policy and pragmatic compromise |
| Principle consistency | Consistent application of cost-benefit analysis and empirical evidence to drug policy |
| Goalpost stability | Stable; positions track evidence and outcomes rather than political winds |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low; actively seeks compromise and bipartisan solutions |

**Justification:** Centrists demonstrate mostly consistent positions on drug decriminalization because their evidence-based approach naturally leads them toward harm reduction and treatment when the data supports those approaches. Minor inconsistency arises from the tendency to prioritize political feasibility over optimal policy, sometimes accepting compromises that evidence would not support.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Third Way and No Labels policy positions on drug reform emphasize evidence and bipartisan appeal
- Bipartisan Policy Center endorses treatment investment and sentencing reform
- Centrist senators (e.g., Chris Coons, Lisa Murkowski) have co-sponsored treatment funding legislation

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Strong agreement with evidence-based presentation of treatment gap, overdose data, and enforcement costs; may place less emphasis on racial framing |
| Root Cause Agreement | 7/10 | Agree with most systemic analysis; may view some root cause claims (e.g., War on Drugs as racial control) as overstated; emphasize practical system failures |

**Source references:**

- Bipartisan Policy Center drug policy recommendations
- Brookings Institution Hamilton Project drug policy proposals

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Federal Decriminalization | 6/10 | Cautiously supportive: "The evidence supports it, but implementation must be careful" | Wants phased approach with proven treatment capacity before decriminalization activates |
| Treatment Infrastructure | 9/10 | Strongly supports: "Treatment is the most cost-effective approach" | Broad support; wants rigorous evaluation and outcome-based funding |
| Possession Thresholds | 7/10 | Supports: "Science-based thresholds are reasonable" | Wants regular review and adjustment based on evidence |
| Civil Citation System | 8/10 | Supports: "Portugal model adapted for U.S. context makes sense" | Wants robust compliance mechanisms; concerned about Oregon-style failure |
| Expungement | 7/10 | Supports: "Records for decriminalized conduct should be cleared" | Comfortable with automatic process; may want graduated approach by offense severity |
| Deflection Programs | 8/10 | Strongly supports: "Proven results; bipartisan appeal; pragmatic approach" | Views as the most politically viable entry point for reform |
| Harm Reduction | 7/10 | Supports most measures: "Naloxone and test strips save lives; supervised consumption needs more evidence" | Wants evidence before scaling controversial programs like supervised consumption |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Drug Decriminalization and Health Response Act | 6/10 | "Good framework; would prefer phased implementation starting with less controversial substances" | Wants to sequence reform to build evidence and political support |
| Model State Decriminalization Act | 7/10 | "State-level experimentation is the right approach to build evidence" | Supports states leading before federal action |

#### Alternative Proposals

Centrists would support: phased decriminalization starting with cannabis, then expanding based on evidence; robust deflection programs as a bridge between criminalization and decriminalization; outcome-based treatment funding with rigorous evaluation; and bipartisan commission to evaluate Oregon's experience and recommend federal policy.

#### Coalition Potential

### Religious Right Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Stated concern is moral order and human dignity; underlying motivations include cultural authority and maintenance of traditional social norms |
| Principle consistency | Christian emphasis on compassion and redemption supports treatment; moral framework opposes permitting drug use; these principles conflict |
| Goalpost stability | Moderate; positions have softened on treatment but remain firm on enforcement |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate; willing to engage on treatment but views decriminalization as moral capitulation |

**Justification:** The Religious Right demonstrates mixed consistency because its tradition contains both a compassionate impulse (caring for the sick, visiting prisoners, redemption narratives) and a moral-order impulse (punishing sin, maintaining standards). On drug policy, these impulses conflict: compassion supports treatment, but moral order supports maintaining criminal penalties as a deterrent and expression of societal disapproval.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Faith-based recovery programs (Teen Challenge, Celebrate Recovery) are among the largest treatment providers in the U.S.
- Family Research Council and Focus on the Family oppose decriminalization while supporting faith-based treatment
- Evangelical leaders increasingly acknowledge opioid crisis as requiring compassionate response, but frame it through redemption narrative rather than policy analysis

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 4/10 | Acknowledge the scope of the drug crisis; attribute it primarily to moral and spiritual decline rather than policy failure; less emphasis on racial disparities |
| Root Cause Agreement | 3/10 | Disagree fundamentally: root causes are spiritual (loss of faith, family breakdown, cultural permissiveness) rather than structural (criminalization, treatment gaps, systemic racism) |

**Source references:**

- Family Research Council. "Policy Positions: Drugs and Substance Abuse." Opposition to decriminalization, support for faith-based treatment.
- National Association of Evangelicals. "Resolution on the Opioid Crisis." 2018. Calls for compassionate response including treatment.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Federal Decriminalization | 2/10 | Opposes: "Society must signal that drug use is morally wrong" | Views decriminalization as societal endorsement of sin |
| Treatment Infrastructure | 7/10 | Supports: "Faith-based treatment transforms lives" | Wants faith-based providers included; objects to purely secular approaches |
| Possession Thresholds | 2/10 | Opposes: "There should be no 'acceptable' amount of hard drugs" | Moral objection to any implicit acceptance of drug use |
| Civil Citation System | 3/10 | Skeptical: "Without real consequences, people won't change" | Prefers court-ordered treatment through drug courts |
| Expungement | 5/10 | Mixed: "Redemption is real, but consequences teach lessons" | Supports case-by-case review with demonstrated rehabilitation; opposes automatic process |
| Deflection Programs | 7/10 | Supports: "Bringing people to help is Christian mercy" | Wants faith-based treatment options available through deflection |
| Harm Reduction | 2/10 | Opposes most measures: "You don't help people by making it easier to sin" | Moral objection to enabling drug use; supports naloxone (saving lives) but opposes supervised consumption |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Drug Decriminalization and Health Response Act | 2/10 | "Removes moral accountability; sends wrong message" | Fundamental moral objection to decriminalization |
| Model State Decriminalization Act | 2/10 | "States should not condone drug use" | Same moral objection at state level |

#### Alternative Proposals

The Religious Right would support: expanded faith-based treatment programs with federal funding; drug courts that mandate treatment with criminal justice backup; mentoring and recovery support through church networks; anti-drug education programs in schools emphasizing abstinence; and enhanced penalties for drug trafficking near schools and churches.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (shared moral framework), Populist (community protection)
- **Potential bridges:** Liberal (treatment investment), Centrist (treatment focus)
- **Unlikely partners:** Libertarian (fundamental disagreement on moral regulation), Progressive (on enforcement role), Democratic Socialist (on secular vs. faith-based approach)

### Democratic Socialist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Stated concerns about structural inequality, racism, and corporate power genuinely reflect analysis |
| Principle consistency | Decriminalization follows directly from critique of mass incarceration as a tool of capitalist social control |
| Goalpost stability | Stable; positions are rooted in structural analysis and will not shift based on political winds |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low; advocates for transformation but willing to accept incremental steps |

**Justification:** Democratic Socialists demonstrate high consistency on drug decriminalization because their structural analysis -- that the War on Drugs serves capital and racial hierarchy, that addiction is a product of alienation and inequality, and that the health system must be public and universal -- generates a clear and internally coherent position: decriminalize, invest in universal public treatment, address root causes of addiction through economic reform.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- DSA platform explicitly calls for drug decriminalization and legalization
- Bernie Sanders supported decriminalization during 2020 presidential campaign
- Democratic Socialist elected officials (AOC, Rashida Tlaib) have co-sponsored drug reform legislation

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strong agreement; would add more emphasis on capitalism, pharmaceutical industry profit motive, and class dimensions of enforcement |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | Deep agreement with systemic analysis; would add critique of capitalism as producing the alienation and despair that drives addiction |

**Source references:**

- Democratic Socialists of America. "Political Platform: Criminal Justice Reform." Calls for drug decriminalization and universal public treatment.
- Sanders, B. 2020 campaign platform on drug policy

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Federal Decriminalization | 9/10 | Strongly supports: "End the War on Drugs, which is a war on the working class and people of color" | Would go further to full legalization with public regulation |
| Treatment Infrastructure | 10/10 | Strongest support: "Universal public treatment as part of Medicare for All" | Wants treatment delivered through public healthcare, not private insurance or block grants |
| Possession Thresholds | 7/10 | Supports but views as insufficient: "The goal should be no penalties for personal use, not just reduced penalties" | Philosophically opposed to any state regulation of personal consumption |
| Civil Citation System | 6/10 | Mixed: "Better than criminalization, but still punitive; fines are regressive" | Concerned about civil fines burdening working-class people; prefers purely health-based response with no penalties |
| Expungement | 10/10 | Strongest support: "Full expungement plus community investment and reparations" | Wants reparative justice beyond record-clearing |
| Deflection Programs | 5/10 | Cautious: "Police should be replaced by community health workers, not given new roles" | Opposed to expanding police function; prefers non-police crisis response |
| Harm Reduction | 10/10 | Full support: "Every tool that keeps people alive is essential; add safe supply programs" | Would expand to include public heroin-assisted treatment and government-provided safe drug supply |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Drug Decriminalization and Health Response Act | 7/10 | "Good start but insufficient; need universal public treatment, not block grants to states" | Wants Medicare for All as delivery mechanism; larger investment; community reparations |
| Model State Decriminalization Act | 6/10 | "Useful but state-by-state approach perpetuates inequality" | Prefers federal universal approach over patchwork state reform |

#### Alternative Proposals

Democratic Socialists would additionally support: full drug legalization with public regulation (similar to alcohol); universal public treatment through Medicare for All; safe supply programs providing pharmaceutical-grade alternatives to illicit drugs; community reinvestment and reparations for neighborhoods devastated by the War on Drugs; abolition of the DEA and private prison industry; and worker-owned recovery cooperatives.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive, Liberal (shared analysis of racial and structural causes)
- **Potential bridges:** Libertarian (on ending criminalization), Centrist (on treatment investment)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative (fundamental disagreement on government role), Religious Right (on secular vs. faith approach), Populist (on enforcement)

### Common Ground Synthesis

This matrix identifies which reforms have potential cross-ideological support and which face structural opposition.

| Reform Category | Broad Support (5+) | Narrow Support (3-4) | Structural Opposition |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Treatment Infrastructure | Liberal, Progressive, Conservative, Populist, Centrist, Religious Right, Democratic Socialist (7) | Libertarian, Constitutionalist (2) | None |
| Deflection Programs | Conservative, Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Religious Right, Populist (6) | Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Democratic Socialist (3) | None |
| Expungement | Liberal, Progressive, Libertarian, Centrist, Constitutionalist, Democratic Socialist (6) | Conservative, Religious Right, Populist (3) | None |
| Federal Decriminalization | Liberal, Progressive, Libertarian, Centrist, Constitutionalist, Democratic Socialist (6) | None | Conservative, Populist, Religious Right (3) |
| Possession Thresholds | Liberal, Progressive, Libertarian, Centrist, Democratic Socialist (5) | None | Conservative, Constitutionalist, Populist, Religious Right (4) |
| Harm Reduction | Liberal, Progressive, Libertarian, Centrist, Democratic Socialist (5) | Constitutionalist (1) | Conservative, Populist, Religious Right (3) |
| Civil Citation System | Liberal, Progressive, Centrist (3) | Libertarian, Democratic Socialist (2) | Conservative, Constitutionalist, Populist, Religious Right (4) |

**Key insight:** Treatment infrastructure investment has near-universal support (7/9 perspectives) and should be the foundation of any reform package. Deflection programs and expungement also enjoy broad support (6/9). Federal decriminalization has majority support (6/9) but faces structural opposition from three perspectives with significant political power. The most viable legislative strategy is to lead with treatment and deflection funding (building the bipartisan coalition) and follow with decriminalization once infrastructure is in place and evidence is generated.

## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: Treatment and Deflection First Act

**Bridges:** Conservative + Liberal + Centrist + Populist + Religious Right

**Core Agreement:** All five perspectives agree that (a) the treatment gap is unacceptable, (b) people with addiction should be able to access treatment, and (c) police-led deflection programs are a useful tool. This compromise builds treatment infrastructure and deploys deflection programs without decriminalization, creating the foundation for future reform.

**Policy Description:**

$15 billion over 5 years for treatment infrastructure expansion through SAMHSA block grants. $2.5 billion over 5 years for DOJ deflection program grants. Requirement that deflection programs include faith-based treatment options. Treatment-on-demand benchmark (72-hour access) as a condition of continued funding. No change to criminal penalties for drug possession.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | Maintains criminal penalties; invests in treatment including faith-based; fiscally responsible through incarceration savings |
| Liberal | Expands treatment access; reduces de facto criminalization through deflection; builds infrastructure for future decriminalization |
| Centrist | Evidence-based; bipartisan; incremental approach that generates data for future reform |
| Populist | Helps affected communities; maintains law enforcement role; doesn't "go soft on drugs" |
| Religious Right | Includes faith-based treatment; maintains moral framework; compassionate response to addiction |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Accepts large federal spending on treatment |
| Liberal | Defers decriminalization; accepts maintenance of criminal penalties in the short term |
| Centrist | Accepts slower pace of reform than evidence would support |
| Populist | Accepts treatment investment rather than enforcement escalation |
| Religious Right | Accepts secular treatment alongside faith-based options |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 5/9 perspectives (potentially 6 with Constitutionalist support for state-based implementation)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 3/5 coalition members rated 4+ consistency (Liberal, Centrist, Constitutionalist if included)
- **Durability:** Strong -- treatment investment has bipartisan support and generates visible results
- **Implementation Path:** Bipartisan legislation modeled on the SUPPORT Act (2018); could pass with 60+ Senate votes

---

### Compromise 2: Phased Decriminalization with Treatment Benchmarks

**Bridges:** Liberal + Centrist + Libertarian + Constitutionalist

**Core Agreement:** These four perspectives agree that (a) criminal penalties for drug possession are disproportionate to the harm, (b) evidence supports health-centered alternatives, (c) states should lead experimentation, and (d) decriminalization should be conditioned on treatment infrastructure readiness. This compromise creates a federal framework enabling but not mandating state decriminalization, with treatment capacity benchmarks.

**Policy Description:**

Federal law amended to allow states to opt in to decriminalization for personal-use quantities without federal penalty. States opting in must demonstrate treatment-on-demand capability (72-hour access) before activating decriminalization. Federal threshold schedule published as guidance (not mandate). Automatic federal expungement for drug possession records in opted-in states. $10 billion in incentive grants for states that opt in.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Liberal | Enables decriminalization in willing states; provides federal support and expungement |
| Centrist | Evidence-based benchmarks prevent Oregon-style failure; phased approach builds support |
| Libertarian | Reduces government punishment; state-based approach respects federalism |
| Constitutionalist | Respects state sovereignty; no federal mandates; opt-in structure |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Liberal | Accepts state-by-state approach rather than universal federal decriminalization |
| Centrist | Accepts that some states may never opt in, creating inequitable outcomes |
| Libertarian | Accepts treatment benchmarks (government program) as condition of decriminalization |
| Constitutionalist | Accepts federal incentive grants that may nudge state behavior |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 4/9 perspectives (potentially 5-6 with Progressive and Democratic Socialist support)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 4/4 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** Moderate -- state opt-in structure creates variability; red states unlikely to participate early
- **Implementation Path:** Requires 60 Senate votes; moderate Republican support possible if framed as states' rights

---

### Compromise 3: Defelonization and Expungement Act

**Bridges:** Conservative + Liberal + Centrist + Libertarian + Progressive

**Core Agreement:** All five perspectives can agree that (a) felony penalties for simple drug possession are excessive, (b) criminal records for minor drug offenses impose disproportionate collateral consequences, and (c) reducing penalties from felony to misdemeanor is a reasonable compromise. This is the narrowest reform with the broadest coalition.

**Policy Description:**

Federal law amended to reclassify first-offense simple drug possession from a potential felony to a misdemeanor (maximum 6 months) at the federal level. Federal incentive grants ($5 billion over 5 years) for states that similarly defelonize drug possession. Automatic expungement of prior federal felony drug possession convictions that would now be misdemeanors. Restoration of federal benefits eligibility (SNAP, public housing) for individuals with defelonized drug convictions.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | Maintains criminal penalties (misdemeanor); reduces excessive punishment; fiscally responsible |
| Liberal | Reduces incarceration and collateral consequences; expungement restores rights |
| Centrist | Pragmatic, achievable reform with broad support; evidence-based |
| Libertarian | Reduces government punishment; step toward further reform |
| Progressive | Reduces harm of criminalization; expungement addresses historical injustice (partial) |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Accepts that some drug possession offenses should not be felonies |
| Liberal | Accepts maintenance of misdemeanor criminal penalties rather than full decriminalization |
| Centrist | Accepts that this is insufficient on the evidence but pragmatically achievable |
| Libertarian | Accepts continued criminal penalties (misdemeanor) rather than full legalization |
| Progressive | Accepts incremental reform rather than transformative change |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 5/9 perspectives (potentially 6-7 with Populist and Constitutionalist support)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 4/5 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** Strong -- California Prop 47 (2014) and Oklahoma HB 2472 (2016) demonstrate defelonization is durable
- **Implementation Path:** Strong bipartisan potential; models exist at state level; could pass with 65+ Senate votes

## Strategic Implications

### Most Viable Coalition

The most viable near-term coalition is the **Treatment and Deflection First** alliance (Conservative + Liberal + Centrist + Populist + Religious Right), which commands majority support across 5 perspectives and focuses on the universally supported investment in treatment infrastructure. This coalition avoids the politically divisive question of whether to remove criminal penalties while building the infrastructure necessary for decriminalization to succeed later.

### Key Obstacles

1. **Conservative-Populist bloc** holds effective veto power on federal decriminalization. Their opposition is rooted in moral conviction (drugs are wrong) and political identity (tough on crime), both of which are resistant to evidence-based persuasion.
2. **Oregon backlash effect** has weakened the political case for decriminalization by providing opponents with a concrete example of failure, even though the failure was one of implementation rather than concept.
3. **Fentanyl crisis** creates political headwinds by making any "softening" of drug penalties appear dangerous during a period of record overdose deaths.

### Low Consistency Partners

The **Populist** perspective (2/5 consistency) is the most challenging partner because its positions are emotionally rather than principally driven. Populist support for treatment is genuine but may evaporate if media narratives shift. The strategy for engaging populists is to frame reform in their language: protecting communities, helping "our people," holding elites accountable, and strengthening law enforcement tools (deflection) rather than removing them.

### Recommended Approach

1. **Year 1-2**: Build the Treatment and Deflection coalition. Pass $15 billion treatment infrastructure act with deflection program funding. Generate bipartisan political capital.
2. **Year 2-4**: Transition to the Defelonization and Expungement coalition. Reduce drug possession to misdemeanor nationwide. Begin automatic expungement. Demonstrate that reduced penalties do not increase drug use.
3. **Year 4-6**: Introduce Phased Decriminalization with Treatment Benchmarks. Allow willing states to opt in to full decriminalization. Build evidence base from state experiments.
4. **Year 6-10**: If state experiments succeed, advance federal decriminalization. Use evidence from opted-in states to neutralize opposition arguments.

This sequenced approach respects political constraints while steadily advancing evidence-based reform, learning from Oregon's central lesson: infrastructure must precede decriminalization.
