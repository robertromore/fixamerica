# Drug Decriminalization: Opposition to Reform

Proposals to decriminalize drug possession face significant resistance from actors who believe that criminal penalties are necessary to deter drug use, maintain public order, and protect communities from the harms associated with substance abuse. This opposition draws on a mix of genuine public safety concerns, institutional interests, ideological commitments, and political calculation.

## Who Opposes Reform

### Organized Opposition

| Actor | Interest | Resources | Tactics |
|-------|----------|-----------|---------|
| Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) | Maintains arrest authority, drug enforcement budgets, and civil asset forfeiture revenue | 365,000+ members; $4.8 million lobbying (2022) | Lobbying legislators; endorsing tough-on-crime candidates; public statements framing decriminalization as dangerous |
| National District Attorneys Association (NDAA) | Preserves prosecutorial discretion and drug case volume | Represents 2,700+ DA offices; policy statements, Congressional testimony | Testimony against decriminalization bills; op-eds; support for drug courts over decriminalization |
| Private prison companies (CoreCivic, GEO Group) | Revenue from housing drug offenders | ~$4 billion combined annual revenue; $5.6 million lobbying (2022) | Campaign contributions to anti-reform legislators; lobbying against decriminalization bills |
| Drug-Free America Foundation | Ideological commitment to prohibition and abstinence-based treatment | ~$2 million annual budget; media campaigns | Op-eds, Congressional testimony, media appearances opposing harm reduction and decriminalization |
| Smart Approaches to Marijuana (SAM) | Opposes cannabis legalization and broader decriminalization | Founded by former ONDCP official Kevin Sabet; ~$3 million annual budget | Media campaigns, polling, lobbying, policy briefs |
| National Sheriffs' Association | Preserves law enforcement authority over drug offenses | Represents 3,000+ sheriffs | Resolutions opposing decriminalization; Congressional testimony |

### Ideological Opposition

- **Social conservatives**: View drug use as a moral failing that should be punished, not accommodated. Argue that decriminalization sends a message of societal approval and undermines personal responsibility. Organizations like the Heritage Foundation and Family Research Council oppose decriminalization on these grounds.
- **Law-and-order conservatives**: Believe that criminal penalties are essential for public safety and community order. Cite rising public drug use and disorder in cities like Portland and San Francisco as evidence that reduced enforcement produces chaos. Figures like Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton have been vocal opponents.
- **Some law enforcement professionals**: Beyond institutional interest, many police officers and prosecutors genuinely believe that the threat of arrest deters drug use and that removing consequences will increase addiction and public disorder. The International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) has expressed concern about decriminalization.
- **Community safety advocates**: Residents of neighborhoods affected by open-air drug markets and public drug use sometimes oppose decriminalization, viewing enforcement as a necessary tool for quality of life. This opposition is particularly notable in communities of color that experience both the harms of drug enforcement and the harms of drug markets.

## Opposition Arguments and Rebuttals

### Argument 1: Decriminalization Increases Drug Use

**Claim**: "Removing criminal penalties sends the message that drug use is acceptable, leading to increased use, especially among young people."

**Evidence Cited**: Opponents point to Oregon's post-Measure 110 experience, where overdose deaths increased 41% between 2020 and 2022, and visible public drug use in Portland grew substantially.

**Reality**: The most comprehensive evidence comes from Portugal, where drug use rates have remained below the European average for over two decades following decriminalization. Adult past-year drug use increased modestly (from 7.8% to 12.8% between 2001 and 2022), but this trend paralleled broader European increases and remained below the EU average of 18.8% (EMCDDA, 2023). Oregon's overdose death increase tracked national trends -- the U.S. national average rose 28% over the same period -- and was driven primarily by the fentanyl supply, not by policy changes. A 2020 systematic review in *The Lancet Public Health* found "no significant increase in drug use" associated with decriminalization across 22 studies in multiple countries.

**Rebuttal**: Criminal penalties do not meaningfully deter drug use. The National Research Council concluded in 2014 that the severity of punishment has little deterrent effect on drug offenses. What deters is the certainty of consequences, and civil responses -- health assessments, treatment referrals, graduated sanctions -- can provide more certain and more useful consequences than an overburdened criminal justice system that processes most drug cases through perfunctory plea bargains.

### Argument 2: Decriminalization Removes Leverage for Treatment

**Claim**: "Without the threat of jail, there is no incentive for people to enter treatment. Criminal justice coercion is the only way to get many addicted individuals into recovery."

**Evidence Cited**: Drug courts, which use the leverage of pending criminal charges to mandate treatment participation, report completion rates of 50-75% and recidivism reductions of 8-14 percentage points (National Drug Court Institute, 2023).

**Reality**: While drug courts show positive outcomes compared to standard criminal processing, this comparison is misleading. Drug courts serve a selected population (those deemed eligible and motivated), and their outcomes are compared to the baseline of incarceration -- a very low bar. Research by the RAND Corporation (2006) and the Vera Institute (2013) finds that voluntary treatment produces outcomes comparable to or better than coerced treatment when treatment is accessible. The key variable is access, not coercion. Portugal's voluntary treatment system, which has no criminal leverage mechanism, has increased treatment enrollment by 41% since decriminalization (SICAD, 2023).

**Rebuttal**: The choice is not between coercion and nothing. Well-designed decriminalization includes robust civil engagement mechanisms -- mandatory health assessments, graduated sanctions for non-compliance, proactive outreach -- that provide structure without the devastating collateral consequences of a criminal record. The question is whether coercion through the criminal justice system or engagement through the health system produces better outcomes, and the evidence favors the health system.

### Argument 3: Decriminalization Leads to Public Disorder

**Claim**: "Without the threat of arrest, drug use will become open and visible, degrading public spaces and quality of life for residents and businesses."

**Evidence Cited**: Portland, Oregon saw significant increases in visible public drug use, public complaints, and open-air drug markets following Measure 110. San Francisco's Tenderloin district became a national symbol of urban drug disorder.

**Reality**: Public drug use is a function of several factors: homelessness, lack of indoor spaces for drug consumption, mental health crisis, and inadequate outreach services. Oregon's public drug use problems pre-dated Measure 110 and were exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, the fentanyl surge, and the housing crisis. Portugal -- which decriminalized in 2001 -- has not experienced the public drug use visible in Portland, in large part because it simultaneously invested in treatment, housing, and outreach services. The disorder argument is an argument for better implementation, not for continued criminalization.

**Rebuttal**: Decriminalization does not mean tolerance of public drug use. Well-designed civil penalty systems can include fines and mandatory engagement for public consumption while removing criminal penalties for private possession. The distinction between possession (which decriminalization addresses) and public use (which can be regulated separately) is critical. Moreover, criminalization has not prevented public drug use in cities that maintain enforcement -- the problem exists in non-decriminalized jurisdictions as well.

### Argument 4: Oregon Proves Decriminalization Doesn't Work

**Claim**: "Oregon tried decriminalization and it was a disaster. The state had to reverse course, proving the approach is unworkable."

**Evidence Cited**: Oregon's 2024 recriminalization (HB 4002), passed with broad bipartisan support, is presented as definitive evidence that decriminalization fails in the U.S. context.

**Reality**: Oregon's experience is better understood as an implementation failure than a policy failure. The core problems were: (1) treatment funding was delayed 18+ months; (2) the civil citation mechanism was poorly designed (only ~1% of cited individuals called the health assessment hotline); (3) the measure lacked accountability mechanisms for individuals who received citations; and (4) implementation coincided with the worst phase of the fentanyl crisis. Portugal's success demonstrates that decriminalization can work; Oregon's failure demonstrates that it must be accompanied by treatment infrastructure, effective engagement mechanisms, and adequate implementation planning.

**Rebuttal**: Oregon's experience is an argument for better decriminalization design, not against decriminalization as a concept. The state invested in the right direction but failed on execution. Future decriminalization efforts must learn from Oregon's mistakes by pre-building treatment capacity, designing effective civil engagement mechanisms, and implementing in phases with measurable benchmarks.

### Argument 5: Decriminalization Enables Drug Trafficking

**Claim**: "Decriminalization makes it harder for police to investigate and disrupt drug trafficking networks, because possession arrests are often the entry point for building cases against dealers."

**Evidence Cited**: Law enforcement officials argue that possession arrests provide leverage to turn users into informants, identify supply chains, and build cases against higher-level traffickers.

**Reality**: While possession arrests can sometimes generate intelligence, the vast majority of 1.3 million annual drug possession arrests do not lead to trafficking investigations. The National Research Council (2014) found that drug enforcement has not meaningfully reduced drug supply or increased street prices. Moreover, the informant system creates its own harms -- unreliable information, racial bias in targeting, and the ethical problems of leveraging addiction for intelligence purposes. Decriminalization proposals maintain criminal penalties for trafficking, manufacturing, and distribution.

**Rebuttal**: Decriminalization does not decriminalize dealing. Trafficking, manufacturing, and distribution remain criminal offenses. Law enforcement retains all existing tools for investigating supply-side actors. The argument that police need to arrest users to catch dealers reflects a model of policing that has failed to reduce the drug supply for 50 years.

## Historical Patterns of Opposition

Opposition to drug decriminalization follows patterns visible across decades:

- **1970s**: Opponents of state cannabis decriminalization predicted surging use; studies found no significant increase (National Academy of Sciences, 1982).
- **1980s-1990s**: Opponents of needle exchange programs predicted they would enable addiction; research demonstrated they reduced HIV transmission without increasing drug use (National Academy of Sciences, 1995).
- **2000s**: Opponents predicted that Portugal's decriminalization would make the country a "drug tourism destination"; drug use rates remained below European averages (EMCDDA, 2023).
- **2010s**: Opponents of cannabis legalization predicted surging youth use; youth cannabis use has remained flat or declined in legalized states (Monitoring the Future, 2023).
- **2020s**: Opponents cite Oregon as proof of failure while ignoring the specific implementation failures that caused the backlash.

The consistent pattern is that predicted catastrophes from reduced enforcement do not materialize when alternative systems are in place.

## Counter-Strategies

### Political Strategies

- **Build treatment infrastructure first**: The most effective counter to opposition is demonstrating that decriminalization includes, not replaces, accountability. Investing in treatment capacity before or simultaneously with decriminalization defuses the "no consequences" argument.
- **Engage law enforcement reformers**: Organizations like Law Enforcement Action Partnership (LEAP) provide credible voices for reform from within policing. Former police chiefs, sheriffs, and prosecutors who support decriminalization undermine the narrative that all law enforcement opposes it.
- **Center the opioid crisis**: The fentanyl crisis has created unusual political dynamics, as it disproportionately affects rural white communities. Framing decriminalization as a response to the overdose emergency -- rather than as a progressive cause -- can broaden the coalition.
- **Use ballot measures in initiative states**: When legislative paths are blocked by law enforcement lobbying, direct democracy through ballot measures has proven effective (California Prop 47, Oregon Measure 110, numerous cannabis measures).

### Communication Strategies

- **Frame as health, not permissiveness**: "We are replacing a system that produces criminal records with one that produces treatment appointments" is more effective than "we are decriminalizing drugs."
- **Use the word 'deflection' rather than 'decriminalization'**: Oregon's 2024 HB 4002 introduced the concept of "deflection" -- a pathway that maintains legal consequences but redirects to treatment. This framing is more palatable to swing voters.
- **Highlight costs of status quo**: The $47 billion annual cost of drug incarceration (Vera Institute, 2023) and the 76% treatment gap (SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024) are powerful data points that frame the current system as wasteful and ineffective.
- **Tell recovery stories**: Personal narratives of individuals who entered recovery through health-based systems rather than criminal punishment are the most persuasive communication tool.

### Policy Design Strategies

- **Include accountability mechanisms**: Civil citations with mandatory health assessments, graduated sanctions for non-compliance, and regular check-ins address the "no consequences" objection.
- **Maintain public use prohibitions**: Decriminalizing possession while maintaining penalties for public drug use addresses quality-of-life concerns.
- **Phase implementation**: Beginning with cannabis and lower-schedule substances before extending to all drugs allows for evaluation and adjustment.
- **Invest in measurement**: Building robust data collection and reporting requirements allows policymakers to demonstrate outcomes and adjust course.
