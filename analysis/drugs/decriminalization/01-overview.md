# Drug Decriminalization: Overview

## Overview

Drug decriminalization is the policy of removing criminal penalties for the personal possession and use of controlled substances, replacing them with civil sanctions such as fines, mandatory health assessments, or referrals to treatment services. Unlike legalization, which creates a regulated legal market for production and sale, decriminalization maintains the underlying prohibition -- drugs remain illegal -- but reclassifies personal-quantity possession from a criminal offense to a civil or administrative violation. This distinction is critical: decriminalization targets the demand side of drug markets by reducing punishment for users while preserving criminal penalties for manufacturing, trafficking, and distribution.

The case for decriminalization rests on decades of evidence demonstrating that criminal penalties for drug possession have failed to reduce drug use, have imposed enormous costs on individuals and communities, and have perpetuated racial disparities in the criminal justice system. The United States arrests approximately 1.5 million people annually for drug offenses (FBI UCR, 2023), with roughly 87% of those arrests -- about 1.3 million -- for simple possession rather than sales or manufacturing (BJS, 2023). These arrests generate criminal records that impede access to employment, housing, education, and public benefits, creating barriers to stability that paradoxically increase the risk of continued substance use. The racial impact is stark: Black Americans are 3.73 times more likely than white Americans to be arrested for cannabis possession despite comparable usage rates (ACLU, 2020).

The most comprehensive evidence for decriminalization comes from Portugal, which in 2001 decriminalized the personal possession and use of all drugs. Over two decades, Portugal has seen drug-related deaths fall from 80 in 2001 to 74 in 2022, HIV infections among people who inject drugs decline by over 90%, and drug use rates remain below the European average (EMCDDA, 2023). In the United States, Oregon became the first state to decriminalize personal possession of all drugs through Measure 110 in 2020, though the state partially recriminalized in 2024 amid concerns about implementation failures and rising public drug use. This reversal -- driven more by execution failures than by the decriminalization concept itself -- underscores the critical importance of simultaneously building robust treatment infrastructure.

Drug decriminalization sits at the intersection of criminal justice reform, public health, racial equity, and individual liberty, making it one of the most politically complex yet potentially transformative policy shifts available. The core question is not whether drug use should be encouraged -- no serious decriminalization proposal advocates that -- but whether the criminal justice system or the public health system is the more effective and humane mechanism for responding to it.

## Scope

This analysis covers the key aspects of drug decriminalization:

- **Decriminalization vs. Legalization**: The critical distinctions between removing criminal penalties (decriminalization), creating regulated legal markets (legalization), and maintaining full prohibition -- and the policy implications of each approach
- **International Models**: Evidence from Portugal's comprehensive decriminalization, the Czech Republic's threshold system, the Netherlands' tolerance policy, and other national approaches
- **State and Local Reforms**: Oregon Measure 110 and its 2024 reversal, state cannabis decriminalization, municipal citation programs, and prosecutorial non-enforcement policies
- **Civil Penalty Systems**: Design of alternative response frameworks including civil fines, mandatory health assessments, treatment referrals, and administrative sanctions
- **Possession Thresholds**: Establishing quantity limits that distinguish personal use from distribution, including weight-based and dose-based approaches
- **Treatment Infrastructure**: The health system capacity required to make decriminalization work, including treatment on demand, harm reduction services, and peer support networks

## Key Facts

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Annual drug possession arrests (U.S.) | ~1.3 million (87% of 1.5 million total drug arrests) | FBI UCR, 2023 |
| Americans with substance use disorder (2023) | 48.7 million | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |
| SUD treatment gap (no treatment received) | ~76% (37 million untreated) | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |
| Drug arrest racial disparity (cannabis) | Black Americans 3.73x more likely to be arrested | ACLU, 2020 |
| States with some form of cannabis decriminalization | 29 + D.C. | NORML, 2024 |
| Oregon Measure 110 passage (2020) | 58.5% voter approval | Oregon Secretary of State, 2020 |
| Portugal drug-related deaths (pre-decrim, 2001) | 80 deaths | EMCDDA, 2023 |
| Portugal drug-related deaths (2022) | 74 deaths | EMCDDA, 2023 |
| Annual cost of drug incarceration (U.S.) | ~$47 billion (state and federal) | Vera Institute, 2023 |
| Portugal HIV infections among PWID (decline since 2001) | >90% reduction | EMCDDA, 2023 |

## Core Tensions and Tradeoffs

- **Public Safety vs. Individual Liberty**: Criminalization aims to deter drug use through punishment, but imposes significant liberty costs on individuals whose drug use may harm primarily themselves. Decriminalization accepts some risk of increased visibility of drug use in exchange for reduced incarceration and improved access to treatment.
- **Deterrence vs. Evidence**: Many policymakers believe criminal penalties deter drug use, but decades of research -- including the National Research Council's 2014 review -- find that the certainty of punishment, not severity, drives deterrence, and that arrest and incarceration do not meaningfully reduce drug consumption rates.
- **Implementation Sequencing**: Oregon's experience demonstrates that decriminalization without adequate treatment infrastructure can produce backlash. The tension between moving quickly to end harmful criminalization and building capacity slowly and carefully is a genuine policy dilemma.
- **Threshold Design**: Setting possession quantity thresholds that distinguish personal use from distribution requires balancing inclusivity (higher thresholds protect more users) against concerns about enabling de facto low-level dealing (lower thresholds limit this risk but snare more users).
- **Federal vs. State Authority**: Drug scheduling and the Controlled Substances Act are federal, but 95% of drug arrests occur at the state and local level. Comprehensive decriminalization requires action at multiple levels of government, creating coordination challenges and potential federal-state conflicts.
- **Racial Equity vs. Enforcement Neutrality**: Drug criminalization has been enforced with stark racial disparities. Decriminalization addresses this by removing the mechanism of arrest, but critics argue it does not address the underlying causes of disparate enforcement and may reduce pressure for deeper structural reform.

## Key Questions

1. Can the United States achieve the public health benefits Portugal demonstrated -- reduced overdose deaths, lower HIV transmission, stable drug use rates -- without replicating Portugal's specific institutional context, including its universal healthcare system?
2. What possession thresholds and civil penalty structures best balance the goals of diverting users from the criminal justice system, maintaining deterrence against dealing, and ensuring connection to treatment?
3. How should decriminalization be sequenced with treatment infrastructure expansion to avoid the implementation failures that led to Oregon's 2024 recriminalization?
4. What federal policy changes are necessary to enable state-level decriminalization, and is federal decriminalization politically achievable?

## Vision of Success

A successful drug decriminalization policy in the United States would feature:

- **Elimination of Arrest for Personal Possession**: No American arrested, prosecuted, or incarcerated solely for possessing personal-use quantities of any controlled substance, with civil responses (health assessments, referrals, graduated fines) replacing criminal penalties nationwide
- **Treatment on Demand**: Every person identified through the civil response system able to access evidence-based treatment -- including medication-assisted treatment, behavioral therapy, and harm reduction services -- within 72 hours of request, with no financial barriers to care
- **Measurable Public Health Outcomes**: Drug overdose deaths reduced by at least 30% within five years through expanded treatment access, harm reduction, and removal of barriers that deter people from seeking help; HIV and hepatitis C infections among people who inject drugs reduced by at least 50%
- **Racial Disparity Elimination**: The 3.73x racial disparity in drug arrests effectively eliminated by removing the arrest mechanism, with civil responses monitored for equitable application across racial and socioeconomic groups
