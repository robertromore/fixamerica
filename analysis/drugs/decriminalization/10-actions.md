# Drug Decriminalization: What You Can Do

Drug decriminalization affects millions of Americans -- the 1.3 million arrested annually for drug possession, the 48.7 million with substance use disorders, the families disrupted by incarceration, and the communities shaped by enforcement disparities. Shifting from criminal to health-centered responses to drug use requires sustained civic engagement at every level of government. Here is how you can contribute.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- Subscribe to the Drug Policy Alliance newsletter for monthly updates on decriminalization legislation and reform efforts: <https://drugpolicy.org>
- Follow the CDC's overdose death data dashboard to track the fentanyl crisis and its impact: <https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm>
- Read Johann Hari's *Chasing the Scream* (2015) or Carl Hart's *Drug Use for Grown-Ups* (2021) for accessible introductions to decriminalization arguments
- Review the EMCDDA's annual European Drug Report for updated data on Portugal's decriminalization outcomes: <https://www.emcdda.europa.eu>
- Follow Filter Magazine (<https://filtermag.org>) for specialized drug policy and harm reduction journalism

### Make Personal Changes

- Carry naloxone (Narcan) -- available without prescription at most pharmacies -- and learn how to administer it. Training is available at <https://www.naloxoneforall.org>
- If you or someone you know is struggling with substance use, call SAMHSA's National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 (free, confidential, 24/7)
- Challenge stigma by using person-first language: say "person with a substance use disorder" rather than "addict" or "junkie"
- If you witness an overdose, call 911 immediately. Most states have Good Samaritan laws that protect callers from drug charges

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact Your Representatives**: Call or email your state legislators and Congressional representatives to express support for decriminalization and treatment investment. Focus on your state legislature, where drug possession penalties are set.
- **Submit Public Comments**: When state or federal agencies propose drug policy regulations, submit public comments supporting evidence-based approaches. Track federal rulemaking at <https://www.regulations.gov>.
- **Write Letters to the Editor**: When your local newspaper covers drug policy, arrests, or overdose deaths, write a letter connecting the story to decriminalization evidence. Local media shapes public opinion in your community.
- **Share Information**: Share credible data about decriminalization outcomes (Portugal, Czech Republic) on social media. Counter misinformation about Oregon by emphasizing the implementation failures rather than the policy concept.

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- Form a local drug policy study group to educate community members about decriminalization, treatment alternatives, and harm reduction. The Drug Policy Alliance provides free educational materials.
- Host town halls with elected officials focused specifically on drug policy, inviting local treatment providers, harm reduction workers, and people with lived experience of the criminal justice system.
- Partner with local harm reduction organizations to distribute naloxone, fentanyl test strips, and educational materials in your community.
- Attend local government meetings (city council, county board) when drug enforcement budgets, police policies, or public health funding are discussed.

### Build Coalitions

- Connect with faith communities that support treatment over punishment. Many churches, synagogues, and mosques operate recovery programs and can be powerful allies for decriminalization.
- Engage local business leaders, who bear costs from workforce shortages caused by criminal records and from untreated addiction affecting employees and customers.
- Build relationships with local law enforcement leaders open to deflection and diversion approaches. Organizations like PAARI (<https://paariusa.org>) can help identify receptive departments.
- Partner with racial justice organizations that understand drug enforcement as a civil rights issue.

## Political Actions

### Contact Elected Officials

**When to Contact**:

- When your state legislature is considering drug penalty reform, defelonization, or decriminalization bills
- During state and federal budget debates, when treatment and harm reduction funding is at stake
- After high-profile overdose events in your community, when policymakers may be considering response
- When candidates are campaigning for office and can be asked about their drug policy positions

**What to Say - Template Email**:

```
Subject: Support Evidence-Based Drug Decriminalization

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

As your constituent in [City], I am writing to urge you to support
evidence-based drug decriminalization and treatment investment. The United
States arrests approximately 1.3 million people annually for drug
possession, yet 76% of the 48.7 million Americans with substance use
disorders receive no treatment. Criminal penalties have not reduced drug
use but have created criminal records that prevent millions from accessing
employment, housing, and education.

Portugal's 2001 decriminalization of all drugs -- which replaced criminal
penalties with health assessments and treatment referrals -- produced
declining drug-related deaths and a >90% reduction in HIV among people
who inject drugs, without increasing drug use. I urge you to support
similar evidence-based approaches here, including expanding treatment
funding, supporting deflection programs, and replacing criminal penalties
for possession with civil health responses.

Thank you for your service and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say - Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City]. I'm calling
about drug policy reform. I'd like the [Representative/Senator] to support
decriminalization of drug possession and increased investment in treatment.
Portugal's experience shows that health-based responses reduce overdose
deaths without increasing drug use. Can you please note my position?"
```

### Support Legislation

Current or proposed legislation to support:

- **State-level defelonization bills**: Many states are considering reducing drug possession from felony to misdemeanor. Contact your state legislator to support these bills as an incremental step.
- **Treatment investment legislation**: Support state and federal bills that expand treatment funding, reduce wait times, and build treatment capacity.
- **EQUAL Act** (federal): Would eliminate the remaining 18:1 crack-powder cocaine sentencing disparity. Contact Senate Judiciary Committee members.
- **Expungement legislation**: Support state automatic expungement bills that clear drug possession records without requiring individual petitions.
- **Good Samaritan law expansion**: If your state lacks a Good Samaritan law protecting 911 callers during overdoses, advocate for one.

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "Do you support replacing criminal penalties for drug possession with civil health responses, as Portugal has done successfully since 2001?"
2. "What is your plan to close the treatment gap that leaves 76% of Americans with substance use disorders without any treatment?"
3. "Do you support automatic expungement of drug possession convictions for conduct that has been decriminalized or defelonized?"
4. "Will you support increased funding for harm reduction services including naloxone distribution, syringe services, and fentanyl test strips?"

**Voting Considerations**:

- Look for candidates who distinguish between drug use (a health issue) and drug trafficking (a criminal justice issue)
- Pay attention to candidates' positions on the Judiciary, Health, and Appropriations committees at state and federal levels -- these committees control drug policy
- Support candidates who cite evidence and outcomes rather than "tough on crime" rhetoric when discussing drug policy

## Professional Actions

- **Healthcare professionals**: Advocate within your professional organizations (AMA, APA, NASW) for position statements supporting decriminalization and treatment expansion. Obtain buprenorphine prescribing training (now available to all DEA-registered practitioners without the former X-waiver).
- **Educators**: Integrate evidence-based drug education into curricula, replacing outdated scare-based approaches (like D.A.R.E.) with programs shown to reduce harm, such as Life Skills Training or Good Behavior Game.
- **Attorneys**: Provide pro bono representation for drug possession expungement. Support bar association resolutions favoring decriminalization. Educate clients about their rights and available diversion programs.
- **Social workers**: Connect with local deflection programs and offer services to individuals encountered by police. Advocate within NASW for decriminalization policy positions.
- **Journalists**: Cover decriminalization with nuance -- distinguish between implementation failures (Oregon) and policy failures. Seek data and expert sources rather than relying solely on anecdotal street-level narratives.
- **Business leaders**: Support ban-the-box hiring policies. Partner with reentry organizations to provide employment to people with drug records. Advocate for decriminalization as a workforce development issue.

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing drug decriminalization with others, emphasize:

1. **The numbers**: 1.3 million drug possession arrests per year, 76% of people with SUD untreated, 107,543 overdose deaths in 2023. The current system is failing by every metric.
2. **Portugal works**: Over 20 years of evidence showing decriminalization reduces drug deaths, HIV transmission, and incarceration without increasing drug use. This is not theory -- it is proven policy.
3. **Oregon failed on execution, not concept**: Oregon's problems stemmed from delayed treatment funding and a poorly designed citation system, not from the principle of decriminalization itself. The lesson is to build infrastructure first, not to abandon reform.
4. **It saves money**: Drug incarceration costs ~$47 billion/year. Treatment returns $4-7 for every $1 invested. Decriminalization is fiscally responsible.
5. **Racial justice**: Black Americans are 3.73x more likely to be arrested for cannabis possession despite comparable usage rates. Decriminalization ends this disparity by removing the arrest mechanism.

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "Decriminalization means drugs are legal" | Decriminalization maintains prohibition; drugs remain illegal. Only the penalty for personal possession changes from criminal to civil. | Drug Policy Alliance, 2024 |
| "Decriminalization increases drug use" | A 2020 Lancet systematic review of 22 studies found no significant increase in drug use from decriminalization. | Stevens et al., *The Lancet Public Health*, 2020 |
| "Oregon proves decriminalization doesn't work" | Oregon's problems were implementation failures (delayed treatment funding, poor citation design), not evidence that decriminalization itself fails. | Oregon Audits Division, 2023 |
| "People need the threat of jail to get treatment" | Research shows voluntary treatment produces comparable or better outcomes than coerced treatment when treatment is accessible. | RAND Corporation, 2006; Vera Institute, 2013 |
| "Decriminalization helps drug dealers" | Trafficking, manufacturing, and distribution remain criminal offenses under decriminalization. Only personal possession penalties change. | Portugal Law 30/2000 |
