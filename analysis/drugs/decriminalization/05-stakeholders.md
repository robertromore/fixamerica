# Drug Decriminalization: Stakeholders

The drug decriminalization debate is shaped by the interactions of numerous groups, each with distinct interests, levels of power, and capacities to influence policy. Stakeholders range from the millions of Americans directly affected by drug arrests to the institutional actors that administer, benefit from, or seek to reform the current system.

## Who Is Affected

### Primary Stakeholders

| Group | Impact | Size | Key Interests |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|
| People arrested for drug possession | Criminal records, incarceration, collateral consequences (employment, housing, education barriers) | ~1.3 million arrests/year; ~20 million Americans with drug-related criminal records | End of criminalization; record expungement; access to treatment |
| People with substance use disorders | Criminalization deters treatment-seeking; criminal records create barriers to recovery | 48.7 million (SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024) | Treatment access without legal consequences; harm reduction; destigmatization |
| Communities of color | Disproportionate enforcement; intergenerational damage from mass incarceration | ~27% of drug arrests are of Black Americans despite ~13.6% population share | Racial equity in enforcement; end of disparate impact; community investment |
| Families of incarcerated individuals | Economic hardship; family disruption; stigma; children's developmental outcomes | ~2.7 million children have a parent incarcerated (any offense); drug offenses drive ~20% | Family preservation; economic stability; reduced incarceration |
| People who use drugs (non-SUD) | Risk of arrest, criminal record, and violence associated with illegal markets | Estimated 59.3 million past-year illicit drug users (SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024) | Personal autonomy; safety; drug quality/purity; no criminal consequences |

### Secondary Stakeholders

- **Employers and workforce**: Drug possession convictions exclude millions from the labor market, costing employers productive workers and increasing labor shortages. Estimated economic cost of drug-related employment barriers: $65 billion annually (CEA, 2022).
- **Taxpayers**: Drug enforcement and incarceration consume ~$47 billion annually (Vera Institute, 2023). Taxpayers bear the cost of a system that fails to reduce drug use while generating collateral consequences that increase future public costs.
- **Healthcare system**: Emergency departments handle overdoses and drug-related injuries that a functioning treatment and harm reduction system would prevent. ED visits for drug-related causes exceeded 5 million in 2022 (HCUP, 2023).
- **Children and youth**: Young people observe the consequences of drug enforcement in their families and communities, shaping attitudes toward authority, the legal system, and drug use itself.

## Who Has Power

### Decision Makers

| Actor | Role | Authority | Resources | Influence Level |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| U.S. Congress | Sets federal drug scheduling and penalties under the CSA | Legislative authority over the Controlled Substances Act | N/A | High |
| President / Executive Branch | Directs DOJ enforcement priorities; appoints DEA administrator | Prosecutorial discretion; executive orders; regulatory authority | $46.1 billion federal drug control budget (FY2025) | High |
| State legislatures | Set state drug possession penalties; can decriminalize at state level | Full authority over state criminal law | State criminal justice budgets | High |
| Governors | Sign or veto decriminalization bills; set enforcement priorities | Executive authority; clemency power | State enforcement agencies | High |
| District attorneys / prosecutors | Decide whether to charge drug possession cases; can decline prosecution | Prosecutorial discretion | Office budgets; plea bargaining power | High |
| DEA Administrator | Schedules and reschedules controlled substances; enforces CSA | Administrative scheduling authority under 21 U.S.C. Section 811 | ~$3.3 billion budget (FY2024); 10,000+ personnel | High |
| Local police chiefs | Direct day-to-day drug enforcement; set arrest policies | Enforcement discretion | Local police budgets | Medium |
| Federal judges | Interpret constitutionality of drug laws; set sentencing precedents | Judicial review; sentencing discretion | Lifetime appointment (federal) | Medium |

### Key Organizations and Institutions

- **Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)**: The primary federal drug enforcement agency. The DEA has opposed decriminalization and rescheduling efforts consistently, viewing its institutional mission as enforcement of the CSA. Budget: $3.3 billion (FY2024).
- **Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)**: The federal agency responsible for treatment and prevention programs. SAMHSA supports expanding treatment access and has cautiously endorsed harm reduction approaches. Budget: $9.7 billion (FY2025).
- **Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP)**: Coordinates federal drug policy across agencies. Historically enforcement-oriented, ONDCP under the Biden administration released a 2022 National Drug Control Strategy emphasizing harm reduction and treatment. Budget: ~$46.1 billion (FY2025, total drug control budget).
- **National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)**: NIH institute funding drug research. NIDA's research consistently supports treatment and harm reduction over criminal justice approaches. Budget: ~$1.6 billion (FY2024).

### Influencers

- **Drug Policy Alliance (DPA)**: The leading advocacy organization for drug decriminalization and reform. DPA helped draft and campaign for Oregon's Measure 110 and publishes influential policy research. Annual budget: ~$25 million.
- **American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)**: Advocates for decriminalization on civil liberties and racial justice grounds. The ACLU's 2020 report documenting racial disparities in cannabis enforcement has been widely cited.
- **Law Enforcement Action Partnership (LEAP)**: Organization of current and former law enforcement officials who support drug policy reform, including decriminalization. Provides political cover for reform by countering the narrative that all police oppose it.
- **National District Attorneys Association (NDAA)**: Generally opposes comprehensive decriminalization; represents prosecutors who process drug cases as a core function.
- **Fraternal Order of Police (FOP)**: The largest police union, with over 365,000 members. Opposes decriminalization; advocates for maintaining criminal penalties and enforcement tools.
- **National Association of Drug Court Professionals (NADCP)**: Supports drug courts as an alternative to standard prosecution but generally opposes full decriminalization, preferring court-supervised treatment.

## Stakeholder Interests and Alignment

### Aligned Interests (Potential Coalition Partners)

| Coalition | Shared Interest | Strength |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Public health advocates + racial justice organizations + libertarian groups | End arrest for personal possession; redirect resources to treatment | Strong -- shared goal, different motivations |
| Treatment providers + SAMHSA + state health departments | Expand treatment infrastructure; increase funding; reduce barriers | Strong -- institutional alignment |
| Fiscal conservatives + criminal justice reformers | Reduce incarceration costs; invest in evidence-based alternatives | Moderate -- agreement on savings, divergent on specifics |
| Prosecutors (reform-minded) + harm reduction advocates | Diversion programs; pre-arrest deflection; treatment mandates | Moderate -- growing alignment in progressive DA offices |
| Families of incarcerated + reentry organizations + employers | Remove criminal record barriers; restore workforce participation | Moderate -- shared interest in reducing collateral consequences |

### Conflicting Interests

- **Law enforcement agencies vs. public health advocates**: Police agencies benefit from drug enforcement budgets, civil asset forfeiture revenue, and arrest-based performance metrics. Public health advocates seek to redirect these resources to treatment. The conflict is both institutional (budget competition) and philosophical (criminal vs. health response).
- **Drug courts vs. full decriminalization advocates**: Drug courts use the leverage of criminal charges to compel treatment participation. Decriminalization removes this leverage, threatening the drug court model. Drug court professionals argue that coerced treatment works; advocates respond that voluntary treatment is more effective and more ethical.
- **Treatment providers vs. harm reduction advocates**: Some treatment providers -- particularly abstinence-based programs -- view harm reduction (needle exchange, supervised injection, drug checking) as enabling drug use. Harm reduction advocates argue that keeping people alive is the prerequisite for any treatment to work.
- **Prosecutors vs. prosecutorial reformers**: Traditional prosecutors view high drug conviction rates as a measure of effectiveness and a political asset. Reform prosecutors view non-prosecution of possession as a public health improvement.

### The Criminal Justice Iron Triangle

The drug enforcement system operates as a classic iron triangle connecting three mutually reinforcing interests:

1. **Congressional committees** (Judiciary, Appropriations) that authorize and fund drug enforcement
2. **Executive agencies** (DEA, ONDCP, Bureau of Prisons) that implement drug policy and depend on enforcement budgets
3. **Interest groups** (police unions, private prison companies, bail bond industry, drug testing firms) that benefit financially from criminalization and lobby to maintain it

Breaking this iron triangle requires either disrupting one side (e.g., realigning Congressional priorities) or building an alternative power center (e.g., a treatment-centered coalition with its own funding streams and political allies).

## Influence Mechanisms

How stakeholders exert influence on drug decriminalization policy:

- **Lobbying**: The private prison industry spent $5.6 million on federal lobbying in 2022 (OpenSecrets, 2023). Police unions spent $4.8 million. Drug policy reform organizations spent approximately $2.1 million. The spending disparity favors the status quo.
- **Campaign contributions**: Law enforcement PACs and private prison companies contributed $7.2 million to federal candidates in the 2022 cycle (OpenSecrets, 2023). These contributions disproportionately target Judiciary Committee members and candidates in competitive districts.
- **Revolving door**: Former DEA officials frequently join private security firms, pharmaceutical consulting firms, and lobbying organizations. Former prosecutors become defense attorneys or private prison consultants. These career pathways reinforce enforcement-oriented perspectives.
- **Public advocacy**: The Drug Policy Alliance, ACLU, and allied organizations conduct public education campaigns, publish reports, and organize grassroots support for decriminalization. The "public safety" frame used by opponents is generally more politically potent than the "public health" frame used by reformers, though this gap has narrowed.
- **Ballot measures**: In states with initiative processes, reformers have bypassed legislative opposition through direct democracy. Oregon's Measure 110, California's Proposition 47, and numerous cannabis legalization measures have all succeeded at the ballot box when legislative paths were blocked.
- **Expertise/information**: NIDA, SAMHSA, and academic researchers produce evidence supporting treatment and harm reduction over criminalization. However, this evidence competes with anecdotal narratives (media stories about public drug use, open-air markets) that favor enforcement responses.
