# Drug Decriminalization: History

## Historical Development

The history of drug decriminalization in the United States is inseparable from the history of drug criminalization itself. Understanding why drugs were criminalized -- and who benefited from that criminalization -- is essential to understanding the contemporary push for decriminalization. The trajectory moves from a largely unregulated era through progressive-era moralism, mid-century racial politics, the War on Drugs, and the slow emergence of evidence-based alternatives.

### Pre-Prohibition Era (Before 1914): Open Markets and Patent Medicines

- **Unregulated access**: Throughout the 19th century, opiates, cocaine, cannabis, and other substances were legally available in the United States. Opium-based medicines were sold in pharmacies, general stores, and by mail order. The Sears, Roebuck catalog advertised syringes and cocaine.
- **Widespread use**: An estimated 300,000 Americans were addicted to opiates by 1900, primarily middle-class white women who used patent medicines containing opium or morphine (Courtwright, *Dark Paradise*, 2001).
- **Early racial targeting**: The first drug restrictions were explicitly racial. San Francisco banned opium dens in 1875, targeting Chinese immigrants. Southern states criminalized cocaine in the early 1900s, citing fears of Black men under the influence. Cannabis prohibition in the Southwest targeted Mexican immigrants.
- **Medical profession's role**: The American Medical Association began advocating for physician control of drug dispensing, framing addiction as a medical concern but supporting regulatory rather than criminal approaches.

### The Criminalization Era (1914-1970): From Regulation to Prohibition

- **Harrison Narcotics Tax Act (1914)**: Technically a tax and registration measure, the Harrison Act was interpreted by Treasury Department enforcement agents and courts as effectively prohibiting physicians from prescribing opiates to addicts for maintenance. The Supreme Court upheld this interpretation in *Webb v. United States* (1919) and *Jin Fuey Moy v. United States* (1920).
- **Marihuana Tax Act (1937)**: Federal Bureau of Narcotics Commissioner Harry Anslinger led a campaign to criminalize cannabis, relying on racial stereotypes and fabricated claims. The Act effectively prohibited cannabis through a prohibitive tax structure.
- **Boggs Act (1951) and Narcotics Control Act (1956)**: Introduced mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses, including first-offense possession. The 1956 Act prescribed a minimum of 2 years for first-offense marijuana possession and permitted the death penalty for selling heroin to a minor.
- **1960s counter-culture**: The widespread use of marijuana and psychedelics by the anti-war movement and counterculture created a political dynamic in which drugs became associated with political dissent and social upheaval.
- **Nixon and racial politics**: In a 1994 interview published by Harper's Magazine in 2016, former Nixon domestic policy advisor John Ehrlichman stated: "The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people... We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities."

### The War on Drugs (1971-2000): Escalation and Mass Incarceration

- **Nixon declares war (1971)**: President Nixon declared drug abuse "public enemy number one" and created the Special Action Office for Drug Abuse Prevention. Initially, Nixon's approach included significant treatment funding -- the 1971 budget allocated two-thirds to treatment and one-third to enforcement. This balance shifted rapidly under subsequent administrations.
- **Creation of the DEA (1973)**: The Drug Enforcement Administration consolidated federal drug enforcement into a single agency with 2,775 agents and a budget of $75 million (approximately $530 million in 2024 dollars).
- **Reagan escalation (1981-1989)**: President Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan elevated the War on Drugs with the "Just Say No" campaign. Federal anti-drug spending increased from $1.5 billion (FY1981) to $6.6 billion (FY1989). The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 created the 100:1 crack-powder cocaine sentencing disparity, mandating a 5-year minimum for 5 grams of crack (used disproportionately by Black Americans) versus 500 grams of powder cocaine.
- **Prison population explosion**: The number of Americans incarcerated for drug offenses rose from approximately 41,000 in 1980 to 458,000 in 2000 -- a more than tenfold increase (Sentencing Project, 2023).
- **1994 Crime Bill**: The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act expanded federal drug penalties and provided $9.7 billion for prison construction, further embedding criminalization.
- **Oregon decriminalizes cannabis (1973)**: In a counter-trend, Oregon became the first state to decriminalize cannabis possession in 1973, reducing possession of less than one ounce to a civil violation with a maximum $100 fine. Ten states followed by 1978, but the movement stalled during the Reagan era.

### The First Wave of Reform (2000-2015): Cracks in the Consensus

- **Portugal decriminalizes (2001)**: Facing a severe heroin crisis -- with the highest rate of drug-related AIDS in the European Union -- Portugal decriminalized personal possession and use of all drugs, effective July 1, 2001. Trafficking remained criminal. The law (Law 30/2000) created Dissuasion Commissions as the primary response mechanism. Initial results showed declining drug-related deaths, plummeting HIV rates, and stable or declining drug use among young people.
- **State sentencing reforms**: Beginning in the early 2000s, states including New York (2004 reform of the Rockefeller Drug Laws), California (Proposition 36, 2000; Proposition 47, 2014), and Texas (2007 diversion programs) began reducing penalties for drug possession.
- **Medical marijuana expansion**: Between 2000 and 2015, the number of states with medical marijuana laws grew from 8 to 23, gradually normalizing the concept that cannabis had legitimate medical uses and challenging Schedule I classification.
- **Colorado and Washington legalize (2012)**: The first two states to legalize recreational cannabis through ballot measures, fundamentally shifting the political landscape.
- **Fair Sentencing Act (2010)**: Reduced the crack-powder cocaine sentencing disparity from 100:1 to 18:1, the first Congressional acknowledgment that the disparity was unjust.
- **Holder Memo (2013)**: Attorney General Eric Holder directed federal prosecutors to avoid charging mandatory minimums for low-level, non-violent drug offenders, signaling a shift in federal enforcement posture.

### The Modern Decriminalization Movement (2016-Present): Breakthrough and Backlash

- **UNGASS 2016**: The United Nations General Assembly Special Session on drugs acknowledged for the first time that the global drug control framework needed to incorporate public health approaches, marking a shift from the enforcement-only consensus.
- **Cannabis legalization wave (2016-2024)**: Between 2016 and 2024, the number of states with legal recreational cannabis grew from 4 to 24 plus D.C. This mainstreaming of cannabis reform created political space for broader decriminalization discussions.
- **Oregon Measure 110 (2020)**: Approved by 58.5% of voters in November 2020, Oregon became the first U.S. state to decriminalize personal possession of all drugs. The measure replaced criminal penalties with $100 civil citations and funded treatment through cannabis tax revenue.
- **Washington *State v. Blake* (2021)**: The Washington Supreme Court struck down the state's felony drug possession statute as unconstitutional (it lacked a mens rea requirement), effectively decriminalizing drug possession for approximately 18 months before the legislature passed a new misdemeanor statute (SB 5536).
- **First Step Act (2018)**: Bipartisan federal legislation signed by President Trump reduced mandatory minimums, expanded good-time credits, and made the Fair Sentencing Act retroactive. While focused on sentencing rather than decriminalization, it represented conservative engagement with criminal justice reform.
- **Oregon recriminalizes (2024)**: Governor Tina Kotzee signed HB 4002 in March 2024, restoring misdemeanor penalties for drug possession. The legislation passed with broad bipartisan support amid public concern about rising overdose deaths, visible public drug use, and the slow rollout of treatment services.
- **British Columbia reversal (2024)**: Canada's British Columbia, which had received a federal exemption to decriminalize personal possession in January 2023, requested re-prohibition of public drug use in May 2024, citing similar public safety concerns.

## Lessons from History

### Pattern 1: Racial Politics Drive Criminalization

At every stage of U.S. drug history, the criminalization of specific substances has been linked to racial anxieties: opium to Chinese immigrants, cocaine to Black Americans, cannabis to Mexican immigrants, crack to Black urban communities. This pattern suggests that decriminalization advocacy must explicitly address racial equity to succeed politically and to avoid reproducing disparities in civil penalty systems.

### Pattern 2: Treatment Infrastructure Determines Decriminalization Success

Portugal's success rested on a pre-existing national health service and a deliberate, simultaneous investment in treatment infrastructure. Oregon's difficulties stemmed largely from the failure to deploy treatment services quickly enough to serve decriminalized populations. The historical pattern is clear: removing criminal penalties without providing alternative pathways to care produces political backlash.

### Pattern 3: Reform Follows Crisis, Not Evidence

The most significant drug policy reforms in U.S. history have been driven by crises -- the opioid epidemic motivated the First Step Act; overdose deaths motivated Measure 110; the crack epidemic, paradoxically, both intensified criminalization in the 1980s and eventually produced the Fair Sentencing Act. Evidence-based arguments alone have rarely been sufficient; political will has typically required visible suffering among politically sympathetic populations.

### Pattern 4: Federalism Enables Experimentation but Limits Scale

The U.S. federal system has allowed states to serve as "laboratories of democracy" for drug policy -- from Oregon's 1973 cannabis decriminalization to Colorado's 2012 legalization to Oregon's 2020 Measure 110. However, federalism also limits the scale of reform, as federal law (the Controlled Substances Act) remains the baseline, and federal penalties, banking restrictions, and scheduling classifications constrain state innovation.
