# Drug Decriminalization

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of drug decriminalization policy in the United States, examining the shift from criminal penalties to civil responses for personal drug possession and use.

## Overview

Drug decriminalization removes criminal penalties -- arrest, prosecution, incarceration, and the acquisition of a criminal record -- for the personal possession and use of controlled substances, replacing them with civil sanctions such as fines, mandatory health assessments, or referrals to treatment. Decriminalization is distinct from legalization: decriminalized substances remain illegal, but violations are treated as administrative or civil infractions rather than crimes. This approach redirects individuals away from the criminal justice system and toward public health interventions while maintaining prohibitions on manufacturing, trafficking, and large-scale distribution.

The United States arrests approximately 1.5 million people annually for drug offenses (FBI UCR, 2023), with the majority -- roughly 87% -- for simple possession rather than sales or manufacturing. These arrests impose enormous costs: criminal records that impede employment, housing, and education; racial disparities that see Black Americans arrested at nearly four times the rate of white Americans for cannabis possession despite comparable usage rates; and criminal justice expenditures exceeding $47 billion annually at the federal, state, and local level. Portugal's 2001 decriminalization of all drugs provides the most studied international model, demonstrating that removing criminal penalties while investing in treatment infrastructure can reduce drug-related deaths, HIV infections, and incarceration without increasing drug use.

This analysis examines the distinctions between decriminalization and legalization, evaluates the evidence from Portugal, Oregon's Measure 110, and other domestic and international models, and proposes a framework for shifting U.S. drug policy from punitive enforcement to health-centered intervention. It explores possession thresholds, civil penalty systems, treatment infrastructure requirements, and the political landscape for reform.
