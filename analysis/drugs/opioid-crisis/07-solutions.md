# The Opioid Crisis: Solutions

## Overview

Addressing the opioid crisis requires a comprehensive, multi-system response that integrates treatment expansion, harm reduction, prevention, regulatory reform, corporate accountability, workforce development, and data infrastructure improvement. No single intervention is sufficient. The evidence base strongly supports a "health-first" approach that treats opioid use disorder as a chronic medical condition while maintaining enforcement focus on major trafficking and corporate diversion.

This analysis identifies eight evidence-based solution areas, each with specific policy interventions, expected outcomes, and implementation considerations.

---

## Solution 1: Universal Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) Access

### The Problem

Only approximately 22% of Americans with opioid use disorder receive medication-assisted treatment, the evidence-based standard of care. The treatment gap kills tens of thousands annually.

### Proposed Interventions

**1.1 Remove Remaining Regulatory Barriers to Buprenorphine**

While the X-waiver was eliminated in 2023, significant barriers remain:

- **Require buprenorphine training in all medical education**: Mandate addiction medicine and MAT competency in medical school curricula, residency programs, and continuing medical education requirements
- **Incentivize prescriber participation**: Provide loan forgiveness, enhanced reimbursement, and practice support for providers who actively prescribe buprenorphine
- **Establish prescriber support systems**: Fund the SAMHSA Provider Clinical Support System (PCSS) and state-level clinical consultation services (telehealth "warm lines") that offer real-time guidance to prescribers
- **Eliminate institutional barriers**: Prohibit hospitals, health systems, and clinical practices from restricting provider authority to prescribe buprenorphine

**1.2 Reform Methadone Access**

- **Authorize office-based methadone prescribing**: Allow board-certified addiction medicine physicians and other qualified providers to prescribe methadone for OUD in office settings, as is standard practice in Canada, the UK, Australia, and most other developed nations
- **Expand take-home eligibility**: Make the COVID-era flexibilities for methadone take-home doses permanent, allowing stable patients to receive 14-28 day supplies rather than requiring daily clinic visits
- **Increase OTP capacity**: Fund the establishment of new opioid treatment programs in underserved areas, with priority for rural and tribal communities
- **Mobile OTP units**: Authorize and fund mobile methadone dispensing units for areas without fixed OTPs

**1.3 Expand Emergency Department-Initiated MAT**

- **Fund ED bridge programs**: Provide grants for all emergency departments to establish buprenorphine initiation protocols with warm handoff to community treatment
- **Require ED screening**: Implement universal opioid use disorder screening in emergency departments, with protocols for immediate treatment initiation
- **Develop post-discharge navigation**: Fund peer recovery support specialists to facilitate continuity of care after ED-initiated treatment

**1.4 Ensure MAT in All Criminal Justice Settings**

- **Mandate jail and prison MAT**: Require all jails and prisons to screen for OUD and provide all FDA-approved medications, with penalties for non-compliance
- **Protect MAT in drug courts**: Prohibit drug courts from requiring MAT discontinuation as a condition of participation
- **Re-entry MAT continuity**: Require pre-release MAT planning and 90-day medication supply upon release

### Evidence Base

- MAT reduces all-cause mortality by approximately 50% (National Academies, 2019)
- MAT reduces illicit opioid use by 50-75% (Mattick et al., *Cochrane Review*, 2014)
- MAT reduces criminal activity by 50-70% (Schwartz et al., 2013)
- MAT reduces HIV and HCV transmission by 50% or more (MacArthur et al., 2012)
- Cost-effectiveness: MAT saves an estimated $25,000-$38,000 per patient per year in healthcare, criminal justice, and productivity costs (RAND Corporation, 2021)

### Expected Outcomes

Increasing the MAT treatment rate from 22% to 50% of the OUD population could prevent an estimated 20,000-30,000 overdose deaths annually and produce $25-50 billion in annual economic savings.

## Solution 2: Universal Naloxone Access

### The Problem

Despite significant progress, naloxone remains insufficiently available to the populations at highest risk of witnessing or experiencing an overdose.

### Proposed Interventions

**2.1 Free Public Naloxone Distribution**

- **Fund a national naloxone distribution program**: Allocate $500 million annually for naloxone procurement and distribution through public health departments, community organizations, libraries, and other public access points
- **Include naloxone in every opioid prescription**: Require co-prescribing of naloxone with every opioid prescription exceeding 50 MME/day or 7 days duration
- **Equip all first responders**: Ensure every law enforcement officer, firefighter, and EMT carries naloxone, with annual refresher training
- **Vending machine programs**: Fund naloxone vending machines in high-need locations (emergency departments, community centers, homeless shelters, correctional facility lobbies)

**2.2 Reduce Cost Barriers**

- **Negotiate federal naloxone pricing**: Use federal purchasing power to negotiate bulk naloxone pricing below $10 per dose
- **Eliminate copays**: Require all insurance plans (including Medicaid and Medicare) to cover naloxone with zero copay
- **Subsidize OTC naloxone**: Provide manufacturer subsidies or price controls to reduce the retail price of OTC Narcan below $20 per kit

**2.3 Expand Training**

- **Community naloxone training programs**: Fund free community training in naloxone administration, overdose recognition, and rescue breathing
- **School-based training**: Require naloxone awareness education in high school health curricula
- **Workplace training**: Encourage large employers (particularly in construction, hospitality, and other high-risk industries) to train employees and stock naloxone

### Evidence Base

- Each naloxone kit distributed prevents an estimated 0.037 deaths per year (Coffin and Sullivan, 2013)
- Community naloxone distribution programs have reduced overdose mortality by 9-11% in areas where they operate (Walley et al., *BMJ*, 2013)
- Cost-effectiveness: $438 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained, far below standard thresholds (Coffin and Sullivan, 2013)

### Expected Outcomes

Universal naloxone access could prevent an estimated 10,000-15,000 overdose deaths annually at a total program cost of $500-750 million per year.

## Solution 3: Comprehensive Harm Reduction

### The Problem

The fentanyl crisis has made every instance of illicit drug use potentially fatal. Harm reduction strategies reduce death and disease while maintaining connection to people who are not yet in treatment.

### Proposed Interventions

**3.1 Expand Syringe Services Programs**

- **Federal funding authorization**: Remove the remaining prohibition on federal funding for syringe purchase (currently, federal funds can support SSP operations but not syringe procurement)
- **State legalization**: Support efforts to legalize SSPs in the remaining states that restrict them
- **Integrated service model**: Fund SSPs as comprehensive health access points providing naloxone, fentanyl test strips, wound care, infectious disease testing and treatment, contraception, and linkage to treatment and social services

**3.2 Drug Checking Services**

- **Legalize drug checking equipment nationwide**: Support state legislation to remove fentanyl test strips and other drug checking tools from paraphernalia definitions
- **Fund spectrometry-based drug checking**: Provide grants for harm reduction organizations to offer mass spectrometry or FTIR-based drug checking that provides detailed substance identification
- **Public health alert systems**: Develop real-time public health alert systems that communicate drug checking results to communities (modeled on the DanceSafe and drug checking programs operating in Canada and Europe)

**3.3 Safe Consumption Sites (Pilot Program)**

- **Authorize a federal pilot program**: Amend 21 U.S.C. 856 to allow SAMHSA-approved safe consumption site pilots in jurisdictions that request them, with rigorous evaluation
- **Learn from existing programs**: Study outcomes from the New York City OPC (OnPoint NYC) sites, which reversed over 1,000 overdoses in their first two years with zero deaths
- **Integrate with treatment**: Require SCS pilots to provide on-site MAT initiation, treatment referral, and social services

**3.4 Safer Supply Programs (Research)**

- **Fund research on prescribed safer supply**: Support NIDA-funded clinical trials of prescribed pharmaceutical-grade opioids for people with severe OUD who have not responded to existing MAT options, modeled on programs operating in British Columbia, Canada
- **Evaluate feasibility and outcomes**: Assess whether prescribed safer supply reduces overdose deaths, fentanyl exposure, and criminal activity while improving health outcomes

### Evidence Base

- SSPs reduce HIV transmission by 56% and HCV transmission by 38% (Platt et al., *International Journal of Epidemiology*, 2018)
- SSPs increase treatment entry fivefold (Hagan et al., 2000)
- SCS have prevented all overdose deaths at supervised sites across 12 countries (EMCDDA, 2023)
- Drug checking leads to behavioral changes that reduce overdose risk (Peiper et al., *International Journal of Drug Policy*, 2019)

## Solution 4: Litigation, Accountability, and Settlement Fund Stewardship

### The Problem

More than $50 billion in opioid settlements has been secured, but effective allocation and oversight remain uncertain. The tobacco settlement experience--where most funds were diverted to general budgets--is a cautionary precedent.

### Proposed Interventions

**4.1 Settlement Fund Oversight**

- **Independent oversight boards**: Require states receiving settlement funds to establish independent oversight boards with representation from public health, treatment providers, people in recovery, and affected communities
- **Transparency requirements**: Mandate public reporting of all settlement fund expenditures, including amounts, recipients, and outcomes
- **Evidence-based allocation standards**: Develop and disseminate evidence-based menus of approved uses, with priority for MAT expansion, naloxone distribution, harm reduction, prevention, and recovery support services
- **Clawback provisions**: Establish mechanisms to redirect funds from jurisdictions that divert settlement money to non-opioid purposes

**4.2 Continued Accountability**

- **Individual criminal liability**: Pursue criminal charges against pharmaceutical executives whose decisions contributed to the crisis, where evidence supports prosecution
- **Enhanced corporate transparency**: Require pharmaceutical companies to publicly disclose all payments to physicians, patient advocacy organizations, and professional medical societies
- **Strengthen whistleblower protections**: Enhance protections and rewards for pharmaceutical industry employees who report misconduct

**4.3 Ongoing Regulatory Enforcement**

- **Restore DEA enforcement authority**: Repeal or amend the 2016 Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act to restore the DEA's ability to immediately suspend suspicious drug shipments
- **FDA post-market surveillance reform**: Require the FDA to conduct independent post-market studies of all opioid products within five years of approval and empower the agency to mandate labeling changes or restrict distribution based on findings
- **Distributor accountability**: Maintain heightened DEA scrutiny of distributor suspicious order monitoring systems and enforce compliance through meaningful penalties

## Solution 5: Prevention

### The Problem

Prevention has been the least-funded component of the opioid response despite its potential for upstream impact. Preventing new cases of OUD is ultimately more cost-effective than treating established cases.

### Proposed Interventions

**5.1 Prescribing Prevention**

- **Continue evidence-based prescribing guidelines**: Support implementation of the CDC's 2022 Clinical Practice Guideline with resources for provider education and decision support tools
- **Universal PDMP consultation**: Require prescriber consultation of the state PDMP before every opioid prescription, with interstate data sharing
- **Non-opioid pain management**: Expand insurance coverage for non-opioid pain treatment alternatives (physical therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, acupuncture, non-opioid medications) and reduce prior authorization barriers
- **Post-surgical opioid stewardship**: Implement evidence-based post-surgical opioid prescribing protocols that limit initial prescriptions to 3-7 days and require follow-up before refills

**5.2 Youth and Community Prevention**

- **Evidence-based school programs**: Fund school-based prevention programs with demonstrated effectiveness (e.g., Life Skills Training, Strengthening Families Program), replacing discredited programs like DARE
- **Community coalitions**: Expand Drug-Free Communities grants and community anti-drug coalition support
- **Social media and counterfeit pill awareness**: Fund public awareness campaigns targeting adolescents and young adults about fentanyl contamination of counterfeit pills sold on social media
- **Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) screening and intervention**: Expand ACE screening and trauma-informed care in pediatric and school settings as upstream addiction prevention

**5.3 Economic and Social Prevention**

- **Invest in affected communities**: Direct federal economic development resources to communities devastated by the opioid crisis, including workforce development, infrastructure, and small business support
- **Social determinants of health**: Address housing instability, food insecurity, unemployment, and social isolation as risk factors for substance use disorders
- **Early intervention**: Fund screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) in primary care, emergency departments, and community health centers

## Solution 6: Workforce Development

### The Problem

The addiction treatment workforce is vastly smaller than needed, and the existing workforce is underpaid, under-trained, and insufficiently diverse.

### Proposed Interventions

**6.1 Expand the Addiction Medicine Workforce**

- **Loan forgiveness**: Provide federal loan forgiveness for physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and counselors who commit to addiction medicine practice in underserved areas
- **Residency and fellowship expansion**: Fund new addiction medicine residency positions and addiction psychiatry fellowships
- **Medical school curriculum reform**: Require medical schools to include minimum competency in addiction medicine and medication-assisted treatment as a condition of accreditation
- **Interprofessional training**: Fund training programs that prepare social workers, nurses, pharmacists, and other professionals to participate in OUD treatment teams

**6.2 Build the Peer Recovery Support Workforce**

- **Peer support certification**: Support national standards for peer recovery support specialist certification, with training programs accessible to people in recovery
- **Medicaid reimbursement**: Require all state Medicaid programs to reimburse peer recovery support services
- **Career pathways**: Develop career advancement pathways from peer support to counseling, social work, and other professional roles
- **Livable wages**: Establish minimum compensation standards for peer recovery support specialists to reduce turnover (current median wage: approximately $17/hour)

**6.3 Expand Telehealth Treatment Capacity**

- **Permanent telehealth MAT authorization**: Make permanent the COVID-era flexibilities allowing telehealth initiation and maintenance of buprenorphine treatment
- **Telehealth training**: Fund training for rural and underserved-area providers in telehealth-delivered addiction treatment
- **Broadband access**: Address broadband infrastructure gaps in rural areas that limit telehealth access

## Solution 7: Data Systems and Surveillance

### The Problem

Timely, comprehensive data is essential for effective crisis response, but current surveillance systems lag months behind real-time events and fail to integrate across agencies.

### Proposed Interventions

**7.1 Real-Time Overdose Surveillance**

- **National real-time overdose surveillance system**: Build a national system integrating EMS data, emergency department syndromic surveillance, medical examiner reports, and law enforcement data to provide near-real-time overdose tracking
- **Predictive analytics**: Develop and deploy predictive models that identify emerging overdose clusters and direct rapid response resources
- **Drug supply monitoring**: Integrate drug checking data, forensic laboratory results, and seizure analysis to track changes in the illicit drug supply

**7.2 Treatment System Data**

- **Unified treatment data system**: Develop a national data system tracking treatment admissions, retention, outcomes, and capacity across all payer types and settings
- **Quality measurement**: Implement standardized addiction treatment quality measures (building on Shatterproof's ATLAS initiative) across all treatment settings
- **Disparities monitoring**: Track treatment access and outcomes by race, ethnicity, gender, geography, and insurance status to identify and address disparities

**7.3 Settlement Fund Tracking**

- **National settlement fund dashboard**: Create a publicly accessible dashboard tracking the allocation, expenditure, and outcomes of all opioid settlement funds across jurisdictions
- **Outcomes evaluation**: Fund independent evaluation of settlement-funded programs to identify effective models for replication

## Solution 8: Supply-Side and Enforcement Reforms

### The Problem

While the analysis throughout this document emphasizes demand-reduction approaches, supply-side measures remain relevant for targeting major trafficking operations and diversion schemes, controlling precursor chemicals, and disrupting the most dangerous actors in illicit drug markets.

### Proposed Interventions

**8.1 International Precursor Control**

- **Bilateral agreements**: Strengthen diplomatic efforts to secure enforceable precursor chemical control agreements with China, India, and other source countries
- **Precursor scheduling**: Work through the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs to schedule additional fentanyl precursor chemicals under international conventions
- **Financial sanctions**: Apply targeted financial sanctions to identified precursor chemical suppliers and money laundering networks

**8.2 Refocused Domestic Enforcement**

- **Prioritize high-level trafficking**: Focus federal enforcement resources on major trafficking organizations, distribution networks, and fentanyl production operations rather than individual users and low-level dealers
- **Drug-induced homicide reform**: Oppose state "drug-induced homicide" laws that prosecute people who share drugs with someone who dies, as these laws deter overdose bystanders from calling 911 and disproportionately target people who use drugs rather than major distributors
- **Diversion and deflection**: Expand police-assisted diversion and deflection programs (e.g., LEAD model, PAARI) that route people with OUD to treatment rather than the criminal justice system
- **Mail and express consignment screening**: Increase technological investment in screening capacity at international mail facilities and express consignment hubs

**8.3 Demand Reduction Focus**

- **Rebalance enforcement and treatment spending**: Shift the federal drug control budget toward demand reduction (treatment, prevention, harm reduction) from its historical supply-reduction emphasis. The current split is approximately 55% supply reduction / 45% demand reduction; evidence supports a reversal of this ratio

## Solution Cost-Benefit Summary

| Solution | Estimated Annual Cost | Estimated Annual Benefit | Benefit-Cost Ratio | Source |
|----------|----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------|--------|
| Universal MAT access | $5-8 billion | $25-50 billion (economic savings) | 3:1 to 6:1 | RAND, 2021; Fairley et al., 2021 |
| Universal naloxone | $500-750 million | $2-5 billion (lives saved, productivity) | 4:1 to 7:1 | Coffin & Sullivan, 2013 |
| Comprehensive harm reduction | $1-2 billion | $3-8 billion (avoided healthcare, corrections) | 3:1 to 4:1 | Wilson et al., 2015 |
| Prevention programs | $1-3 billion | $5-15 billion (avoided future treatment) | 5:1 to 10:1 | ONDCP, 2022 |
| Workforce development | $2-4 billion | Enables all other interventions | N/A (foundational) | SAMHSA, 2023 |
| Data and surveillance | $500 million - $1 billion | Improves targeting of all investments | N/A (foundational) | CDC, 2023 |

**Total estimated investment needed**: $10-18 billion annually above current spending

**Total estimated economic benefit**: $35-78 billion annually in reduced mortality, healthcare costs, criminal justice costs, and productivity losses

The economic case for comprehensive investment is overwhelming. The crisis costs the economy more than $1 trillion per year; the investments needed to dramatically reduce its impact represent less than 2% of that cost.
