# The Opioid Crisis: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

This document presents draft legislation addressing the opioid crisis through three complementary bills: the Comprehensive Opioid Crisis Response and Accountability Act (addressing systemic reform), the Medication-Assisted Treatment Access Act (expanding treatment), and the Naloxone for All Act (universal overdose reversal access). Together, these bills would establish the legal framework for the comprehensive response outlined in the Solutions and Roadmap analyses. Each bill includes draft legislative text, explanatory notes, and analysis of potential challenges and refinements.

## Federal Legislation

### Bill 1: Comprehensive Opioid Crisis Response and Accountability Act

**Purpose**: Establish a comprehensive federal framework for opioid crisis response, including treatment system reform, harm reduction authorization, settlement fund oversight, pharmaceutical accountability, and workforce development.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Comprehensive Opioid Crisis Response
and Accountability Act" or the "OCRAA".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Since 1999, more than 700,000 Americans have died from
    opioid-involved overdoses, constituting the deadliest drug
    epidemic in the Nation's history.
(2) The crisis was substantially caused by pharmaceutical industry
    practices that misrepresented the addiction risk of opioid
    medications and by regulatory failures that permitted those
    practices to continue.
(3) Synthetic opioids, primarily illicitly manufactured fentanyl,
    now account for approximately 75 percent of all drug overdose
    deaths in the United States.
(4) Only approximately 22 percent of Americans with opioid use
    disorder receive medication-assisted treatment, the
    evidence-based standard of care.
(5) More than $50,000,000,000 in opioid litigation settlements
    requires effective oversight to ensure funds are directed to
    evidence-based treatment, prevention, and harm reduction.
(6) The annual economic cost of the opioid crisis exceeds
    $1,000,000,000,000.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(a) MEDICATION-ASSISTED TREATMENT.—The term "medication-assisted
    treatment" or "MAT" means the use of FDA-approved medications
    (methadone, buprenorphine, or naltrexone) in combination with
    counseling and behavioral therapies for the treatment of opioid
    use disorder.
(b) OPIOID USE DISORDER.—The term "opioid use disorder" means a
    substance use disorder involving opioids as defined by the
    Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th
    edition, or subsequent editions.
(c) HARM REDUCTION.—The term "harm reduction" means evidence-based
    practices, programs, and policies that reduce the negative
    consequences of drug use without requiring abstinence as a
    precondition for services.
(d) SETTLEMENT FUNDS.—The term "settlement funds" means any
    monetary payments received by State or local governments from
    opioid-related litigation, including settlements, judgments,
    and bankruptcy distributions.

SEC. 4. OPIOID SETTLEMENT FUND OVERSIGHT.

(d) RESTORE DEA ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY.—
    Section 303(f) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C.
    823(f)) is amended to restore the authority of the Attorney
    General to immediately suspend a registration upon a finding
    of imminent danger to the public health or safety, as such
    authority existed prior to the enactment of the Ensuring
    Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act of 2016
    (Public Law 114-145).

SEC. 6. HARM REDUCTION AUTHORIZATION.

        may authorize not more than 10 pilot safe consumption
        sites in jurisdictions that apply and meet standards
        established under paragraph (2).
    (2) STANDARDS.—The Secretary shall promulgate standards
        including requirements for medical supervision, naloxone
        availability, treatment referral capacity, community
        engagement, and data collection.
    (3) EVALUATION.—The Secretary shall contract with an
        independent evaluator to assess pilot site outcomes
        including overdose deaths prevented, treatment entries,
        community impact, and cost-effectiveness.
    (4) SUNSET.—The authorization under this subsection shall
        expire 5 years after the date of enactment unless
        renewed by Congress.

SEC. 7. WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT.

(a) LOAN FORGIVENESS.—The Secretary of Education, in coordination
    with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall
    establish a program providing up to $100,000 in student loan
    forgiveness for—
    (1) physicians who obtain board certification in addiction
        medicine and practice in underserved areas for not less

This Act shall take effect 90 days after the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**: This comprehensive bill addresses the systemic dimensions of the crisis--settlement fund oversight, pharmaceutical accountability, harm reduction authorization, and workforce development--that are not adequately covered by existing legislation. It builds on the foundation established by the SUPPORT Act (2018) and the X-waiver elimination (2023).

**Potential Challenges**:
- Safe consumption site authorization will face strong opposition from law enforcement groups and many Republican legislators
- Revolving door restrictions may face legal challenges under First Amendment and due process grounds
- Appropriation levels may be reduced in the legislative process
- Settlement fund oversight provisions may face federalism objections

**Refinements**:
- If SCS authorization is not achievable, it could be removed without compromising the rest of the bill
- Revolving door provisions could be narrowed to specific decision-making roles
- Appropriation levels could be structured as authorizations with actual funding determined in appropriations process

### Bill 2: Medication-Assisted Treatment Access Act

**Purpose**: Remove remaining barriers to medication-assisted treatment access, with particular focus on methadone reform, criminal justice settings, and insurance coverage.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Medication-Assisted Treatment Access Act"
or the "MAT Access Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Medication-assisted treatment reduces all-cause mortality among
    persons with opioid use disorder by approximately 50 percent.
(2) The United States is one of the only developed nations that
    restricts methadone for opioid use disorder to federally
    regulated opioid treatment programs, preventing office-based
    prescribing that is standard in Canada, Australia, the United
    Kingdom, and most European nations.
(3) Approximately 2,200 counties in the United States lack any
    opioid treatment program, and approximately 500 counties lack
    any buprenorphine prescriber.
(4) The treatment gap—the difference between the number of Americans
    with opioid use disorder and the number receiving evidence-based
    treatment—represents the single largest failure in the crisis
    response.

SEC. 3. METHADONE PRESCRIBING REFORM.

(a) OFFICE-BASED METHADONE.—
    (1) Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment, the
        Secretary of Health and Human Services shall promulgate
        regulations permitting board-certified addiction medicine
        physicians, and other qualified practitioners as determined
        by the Secretary, to prescribe and dispense methadone for
        opioid use disorder in office-based settings.
    (2) Practitioners prescribing methadone under this subsection
        shall meet training and practice standards established by
        the Secretary, including—
        (A) board certification or equivalent qualification in
            addiction medicine;
        (B) completion of not fewer than 24 hours of training in
            methadone pharmacology, dosing, and safety;
        (C) capacity for observed dosing during initiation periods;
        (D) established protocols for drug interaction screening
            and cardiac monitoring; and
        (E) participation in a prescriber support and mentorship
            network.

(b) TAKE-HOME FLEXIBILITY.—
    (1) The regulations governing take-home methadone doses under
        42 CFR Part 8 are amended to make permanent the
        flexibilities adopted during the COVID-19 public health
        emergency.
    (2) Stable patients, as defined by the treating physician, may
        receive up to 28 days of take-home methadone doses.
    (3) New patients may receive up to 3 days of take-home doses
        upon initiation, with expansion based on clinical assessment.

(c) MOBILE UNITS.—
    (1) The Secretary shall authorize the operation of mobile
        methadone dispensing units in areas designated as medically
        underserved.
    (2) There are authorized to be appropriated $500,000,000 for
        the establishment and operation of not fewer than 200
        mobile methadone units over 5 years.

SEC. 4. CRIMINAL JUSTICE MAT MANDATE.

(a) FEDERAL FACILITIES.—
    (1) Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment, the
        Bureau of Prisons shall implement universal screening for
        opioid use disorder and provision of all three FDA-approved
        medications for OUD in all federal correctional facilities.
    (2) No federal correctional facility may prohibit, restrict,
        or discourage the use of medication-assisted treatment by
        any incarcerated person with opioid use disorder.

(b) FEDERALLY FUNDED FACILITIES.—
    (1) As a condition of receiving Federal funds under the State
        Criminal Alien Assistance Program, Byrne JAG, COPS, or
        any other Federal grant program for correctional facilities,
        State and local jails and prisons shall—
        (A) screen all incoming inmates for opioid use disorder
            within 72 hours of intake;
        (B) provide all three FDA-approved MAT medications to
            inmates with OUD;
        (C) continue MAT for inmates who were receiving treatment
            prior to incarceration; and
        (D) provide a minimum 30-day supply of medication and
            treatment referral upon release.
    (2) COMPLIANCE TIMELINE.—Facilities shall achieve compliance
        within 3 years of enactment, with intermediate milestones
        at 1 and 2 years.

(c) DRUG COURTS.—No drug court receiving Federal funds may
    prohibit or discourage participation by persons receiving
    medication-assisted treatment or require discontinuation of
    MAT as a condition of program participation.

SEC. 5. INSURANCE COVERAGE.

(a) PARITY ENFORCEMENT.—
    (1) The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and
        Treasury shall issue joint guidance clarifying that prior
        authorization, step therapy, and quantity limits applied
        to medications for opioid use disorder that are not equally
        applied to other chronic disease medications constitute
        violations of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction
        Equity Act.
    (2) The Departments shall conduct annual compliance audits of
        the 20 largest health insurers and Medicaid managed care
        organizations and publish results publicly.

(b) MEDICARE METHADONE COVERAGE.—Section 1861 of the Social
    Security Act is amended to include coverage of methadone for
    opioid use disorder under Medicare Part D, effective not later
    than January 1 of the year following enactment.

(c) COST SHARING.—All FDA-approved medications for opioid use
    disorder shall be covered with zero cost-sharing by all health
    plans subject to Federal regulation, including Medicare,
    Medicaid, CHIP, TRICARE, Federal Employees Health Benefits,
    and plans sold on ACA exchanges.

SEC. 6. TELEHEALTH.

(a) PERMANENT AUTHORIZATION.—The authority to prescribe
    buprenorphine via audio-visual telehealth without an initial
    in-person visit, as authorized under temporary DEA and SAMHSA
    flexibilities, is hereby made permanent.
(b) AUDIO-ONLY.—For patients in areas without broadband access,
    initial buprenorphine prescriptions may be issued via
    audio-only telehealth, provided that an in-person or
    audio-visual follow-up occurs within 30 days.

SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act
$3,000,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2026 through 2030.

SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.

Except as otherwise provided, this Act shall take effect 90 days
after the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**: This bill targets the treatment gap directly by reforming the two most significant structural barriers to MAT access: methadone regulation and criminal justice system exclusion. Methadone reform is particularly critical because methadone remains the only FDA-approved medication for OUD that is restricted to specialized clinics.

**Potential Challenges**:
- Methadone reform will face opposition from existing OTP operators concerned about competition and from those citing diversion and safety risks
- Criminal justice MAT mandates will face cost and implementation concerns from state and local corrections administrators
- Insurance parity enforcement may face industry pushback

**Refinements**:
- Methadone reform could begin as a pilot program limited to board-certified addiction medicine physicians before broader expansion
- Criminal justice compliance timelines could be extended with technical assistance support
- Insurance provisions could include implementation support for small insurers

### Bill 3: Naloxone for All Act

**Purpose**: Establish universal access to naloxone through a national distribution program, price controls, and comprehensive training.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Naloxone for All Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that safely and effectively
    reverses opioid overdoses when administered in time.
(2) The FDA approved over-the-counter naloxone nasal spray in
    March 2023, but the retail price of approximately $45 per
    kit remains a barrier for many Americans at highest risk.
(3) Community naloxone distribution programs have been shown to
    reduce overdose mortality by 9-11 percent in areas where
    they operate.
(4) At a cost of $438 per quality-adjusted life year gained,
    naloxone distribution is among the most cost-effective
    public health interventions available.

SEC. 3. NATIONAL NALOXONE DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall
    establish a National Naloxone Distribution Program to ensure
    that every American at risk of experiencing or witnessing an
    opioid overdose has access to free naloxone.

(b) DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.—Naloxone shall be made available
    without cost through—
    (1) public health departments;
    (2) community health centers;
    (3) emergency departments;
    (4) syringe services programs and harm reduction organizations;
    (5) public libraries;
    (6) schools and universities;
    (7) homeless shelters and housing programs;
    (8) correctional facilities upon release;
    (9) substance use disorder treatment programs;
    (10) Veterans Affairs facilities;
    (11) naloxone vending machines in high-need locations; and
    (12) mail-based distribution programs.

(c) CO-PRESCRIBING.—Any prescription for an opioid analgesic
    exceeding 50 morphine milligram equivalents per day or 7 days
    duration shall be accompanied by a prescription or direct
    provision of naloxone, at no additional cost to the patient.

(d) FIRST RESPONDER EQUIPPING.—The Secretary, through the Office
    of Justice Programs, shall provide grants to ensure that all
    State and local law enforcement officers, firefighters, and
    emergency medical technicians are equipped with naloxone and
    trained in its administration.

SEC. 4. PRICING.

(a) FEDERAL PRICING.—The Secretary shall negotiate naloxone pricing
    for the National Distribution Program at not more than $10 per
    single-dose unit.

(b) RETAIL PRICING.—If the manufacturer's suggested retail price of
    any OTC naloxone product exceeds twice the price negotiated under
    subsection (a), the Secretary may invoke compulsory licensing
    authority under 28 U.S.C. 1498 to authorize generic manufacture
    for the National Distribution Program.

SEC. 5. TRAINING.

(a) COMMUNITY TRAINING.—The Secretary shall fund free, community-based
    naloxone administration training programs in every State, with
    priority for communities with the highest overdose death rates.

(b) SCHOOL-BASED EDUCATION.—The Secretary of Education shall develop
    and disseminate age-appropriate overdose recognition and naloxone
    awareness curricula for inclusion in secondary school health
    education.

(c) WORKPLACE PROGRAMS.—The Secretary of Labor shall issue guidance
    encouraging employers in high-risk industries to maintain
    workplace naloxone supplies and train employees in administration.

SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this Act—
(1) $1,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2026;
(2) $750,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2027 through 2030.

SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect 60 days after the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**: The Naloxone for All Act addresses the gap between naloxone's legal availability and its actual accessibility for the populations at highest risk. Despite OTC approval, cost and distribution remain barriers. This bill creates a proactive distribution infrastructure rather than relying on individuals to purchase naloxone at retail.

**Potential Challenges**:
- Appropriations levels may face fiscal opposition
- Compulsory licensing provisions will face pharmaceutical industry opposition
- Co-prescribing mandates may face physician and pharmacy pushback

**Refinements**:
- Compulsory licensing could be replaced with negotiated pricing with volume guarantees
- Co-prescribing thresholds could be adjusted based on clinical input
- Distribution infrastructure could leverage existing public health systems to reduce costs

## State Model Legislation

### Model Comprehensive Opioid Response Act

**Purpose**: Provide a template for state-level opioid response legislation that can be adapted to individual state circumstances.

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
This Act may be cited as the "[State] Comprehensive Opioid
Response Act".

SECTION 2. OPIOID SETTLEMENT FUND.
(a) There is established the [State] Opioid Settlement Fund as
    a special fund in the State Treasury.
(b) All opioid settlement funds received by the State shall be

(d) Fund expenditures shall be limited to opioid abatement
    purposes as defined in the applicable settlement agreements.

SECTION 3. OPIOID RESPONSE BOARD.
(a) There is established the [State] Opioid Response Board
    consisting of 11 members appointed by the Governor with
    the advice and consent of the Senate.
(b) Members shall include public health professionals, treatment
    providers, persons in recovery, family advocates, law
    enforcement, and community representatives.
(c) The Board shall develop and publish an annual Opioid Response
    Plan with measurable targets and expenditure priorities.
(d) The Board shall publish quarterly financial and outcome reports.

SECTION 4. HARM REDUCTION AUTHORIZATION.

## Regulatory Framework

### SAMHSA Methadone Regulation Reform

**Existing Authority**: 42 CFR Part 8 (Certification of Opioid Treatment Programs)

**Draft Regulatory Change**: Amend 42 CFR Part 8 to add a new category of authorized methadone prescriber (office-based opioid treatment, or OBOT) meeting specified training and practice standards, in addition to existing OTP framework.

**Explanation**: This regulatory change could be accomplished by SAMHSA without new legislation, though Congressional authorization would strengthen and protect the reform. The regulatory approach allows for faster implementation while legislative authorization provides long-term stability.

### FDA Opioid Post-Market Requirements

**Existing Authority**: 21 U.S.C. 355(o) (post-market studies and clinical trials)

**Draft Regulatory Action**: Require all manufacturers of opioid analgesics to conduct and submit post-market studies on long-term addiction outcomes within 5 years of approval, with public reporting of results. Expand the existing opioid REMS to include mandatory patient education and prescriber competency verification.

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

- **Commerce Clause**: Federal authority to regulate pharmaceutical manufacturing, distribution, and prescribing is well established under the Commerce Clause. Regulation of settlement funds received by states raises federalism questions that the bill addresses through conditional spending (tying oversight requirements to federal funding)
- **Due Process**: Revolving door restrictions must be carefully calibrated to survive due process scrutiny. The 4-year cooling-off period is within the range upheld by courts for similar restrictions on government employees
- **Eighth Amendment**: Criminal justice MAT mandates are consistent with the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment, as courts have increasingly recognized the denial of MAT to incarcerated persons as a potential constitutional violation

### Preemption Questions

- Federal legislation would preempt inconsistent state laws regarding methadone prescribing authority and harm reduction authorization
- Settlement fund oversight provisions operate as conditions on federal funding rather than direct preemption, preserving state discretion while incentivizing compliance
- Insurance provisions would establish a federal floor without preventing states from adopting stronger protections

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- Settlement fund oversight relies on a combination of independent board oversight, public transparency, federal funding conditions, and private right of action
- Pharmaceutical accountability provisions are enforced through existing DOJ and FDA enforcement mechanisms, supplemented by whistleblower rewards
- Criminal justice MAT mandates are enforced through federal funding conditions, with compliance timelines and technical assistance

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Comprehensive Opioid Crisis Response and Accountability Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Settlement fund fungibility | States could redirect existing opioid spending to other purposes while using settlement funds to backfill, producing no net increase | Critical |
| Revolving door circumvention | Former officials could consult indirectly through intermediaries or join companies without opioid products that later acquire them | Medium |
| SCS pilot limitations | 10-site pilot may be insufficient to generate generalizable evidence; opponents could use negative results from individual sites to block expansion | Medium |
| Whistleblower retaliation through non-obvious mechanisms | Employers could retaliate through subtle means (reassignment, exclusion from projects) that are difficult to prove | Medium |
| Oversight board capture | Board members could be selected from industry-friendly backgrounds despite composition requirements | High |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Appropriation-dependent funding | Programs vulnerable to annual budget politics | Authorization does not guarantee appropriation |
| No mandatory spending | Long-term sustainability uncertain | Political difficulty of establishing entitlements |
| Limited international authority | Cannot compel Chinese precursor chemical cooperation | Sovereignty limitations, diplomatic complexity |
| Voluntary prescriber participation | Cannot force physicians to treat OUD | Professional autonomy, constitutional limits |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Add non-supplanting requirements: Settlement funds must supplement, not replace, existing state and local opioid spending. Require maintenance-of-effort documentation
2. Broaden revolving door definitions: Include consulting, advisory, and indirect employment relationships; require disclosure of all post-government compensation from regulated entities
3. Expand SCS pilot scope: Authorize 15-20 sites across diverse geographic and demographic settings with a minimum 7-year evaluation period
4. Strengthen whistleblower protections: Establish a rebuttable presumption of retaliation for any adverse employment action within 2 years of a protected disclosure; provide interim relief during investigation
5. Add board independence safeguards: Require financial disclosure by board members; prohibit appointment of individuals with current or recent (5-year) pharmaceutical industry ties; establish removal-for-cause protections

### MAT Access Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Methadone diversion | Office-based methadone prescribing could increase diversion risk | High |
| Compliance gaming by correctional facilities | Facilities could technically comply (screening, offering) while discouraging uptake | High |
| Insurance workarounds | Insurers could create other barriers (network restrictions, authorization for counseling component) while technically complying with MAT parity | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Methadone safety concerns are legitimate | Office-based prescribing requires careful safeguards | Methadone's narrow therapeutic index and drug interactions |
| Correctional cost burden | Implementation costs fall on already-strained corrections budgets | Unfunded mandate structure |
| Workforce limitations | Insufficient providers even with regulatory reform | Training pipeline takes years to expand |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Methadone safety: Require cardiac monitoring (QTc screening) at baseline and dose changes; mandate observed dosing during initiation; limit initial office-based prescribing to addiction medicine specialists; establish adverse event reporting requirements
2. Correctional compliance: Fund technical assistance programs; provide grants for initial implementation costs; establish peer learning networks among correctional healthcare systems; create objective compliance metrics
3. Workforce: Pair regulatory reform with aggressive workforce development (loan forgiveness, training funding, telehealth); establish prescriber mentorship networks

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| Federal-state coordination complexity | Establish regional coordination offices; designate state points of contact; create standardized reporting frameworks |
| Political sustainability across administrations | Build bipartisan support; establish mandatory spending where possible; create independent oversight that survives political transitions |
| Equity in distribution | Require geographic and demographic equity analysis in fund allocation; weight distribution formulas for disproportionately affected communities |
| Data system fragmentation | Mandate interoperable data systems; establish national data standards; fund state system upgrades |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

- All pilot programs (SCS, mobile methadone) include 5-year sunset clauses with evaluation requirements
- The Opioid Settlement Fund Oversight requirements remain in effect for the duration of settlement fund distributions (15-18 years)
- Appropriation authorizations are structured in 5-year cycles requiring Congressional reauthorization
- The Secretary of HHS shall submit a biennial report to Congress on the implementation and effectiveness of all provisions
