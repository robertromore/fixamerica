# The Opioid Crisis: History

## Overview

The American opioid crisis did not emerge spontaneously. It was constructed through decades of decisions by pharmaceutical companies, regulators, healthcare institutions, and policymakers. Understanding this history is essential to preventing future crises and holding responsible parties accountable. The crisis unfolded in three overlapping waves, each building on the failures and consequences of the previous one, and each more lethal than the last.

## Pre-Crisis Context: Opioids in American Medicine (Pre-1990)

### Historical Opioid Caution

For most of the twentieth century, the American medical establishment treated opioid analgesics with significant caution. This conservatism had deep roots:

- **1914 Harrison Narcotics Tax Act**: Established federal regulation of opioids and cocaine, reflecting concerns about widespread addiction in the patent medicine era
- **1920s-1960s**: Medical training emphasized addiction risk; opioids were reserved primarily for acute pain and terminal illness
- **1970 Controlled Substances Act**: Created the modern scheduling system; placed opioids in Schedules II-IV with prescribing restrictions
- **1973 DEA established**: Consolidated federal drug enforcement and diversion control

This cautious approach was not without costs. By the 1980s, legitimate concerns had emerged that chronic pain was undertreated in American medicine, particularly for cancer patients and patients in palliative care settings.

### The Seeds of Change: 1980-1995

Several developments in the 1980s and early 1990s laid the groundwork for the prescribing revolution:

- **1980 Porter and Jick letter**: A five-sentence letter to the *New England Journal of Medicine* reported that among 11,882 hospitalized patients who received opioids, only four developed addiction. This letter--later described by the journal itself as having been "heavily and uncritically cited" to support long-term opioid use for non-cancer pain--would become one of the most consequential publications in medical history
- **1986 Portenoy and Foley article**: Published in the journal *Pain*, this case series of 38 patients argued that opioids could be safely used for chronic non-cancer pain, helping shift medical opinion
- **1990 WHO Pain Ladder**: The World Health Organization's cancer pain relief guidelines, while designed for cancer pain, began to influence thinking about non-cancer pain management
- **1990-1995 Pain as the "Fifth Vital Sign"**: The American Pain Society began promoting the concept that pain should be assessed as a vital sign at every clinical encounter, a campaign later adopted by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO)

## Wave One: Prescription Opioids (1996-2010)

### The OxyContin Launch (1996)

The single most consequential event in the opioid crisis was Purdue Pharma's introduction of OxyContin (extended-release oxycodone) in 1996. Key aspects of the launch:

- **Formulation claim**: Purdue marketed OxyContin as having a lower addiction risk than immediate-release opioids due to its controlled-release mechanism, claiming it provided "smooth and sustained pain control all day and all night" with "less potential for abuse"
- **FDA approval**: The FDA approved OxyContin's labeling claim that the controlled-release formulation was "believed to reduce the abuse liability of the drug" based on limited evidence. The FDA reviewer who approved this language, Curtis Wright, left the FDA shortly afterward and took a position at Purdue Pharma
- **Marketing scale**: Purdue spent an estimated $207 million on OxyContin marketing in 2001 alone--more than Pepsi spent on advertising that year
- **Sales force**: Purdue doubled its sales force to more than 600 representatives focused on OxyContin and incentivized high-volume prescribing with bonuses averaging $71,000 per representative in 2001
- **Revenue**: OxyContin generated $1.1 billion in revenue in 2000, $2.4 billion in 2003, and more than $3 billion annually by 2010

### The Prescribing Revolution (1996-2012)

Purdue's marketing was part of a broader industry-wide campaign to expand opioid prescribing:

- **Key opinion leaders**: Pharmaceutical companies funded and cultivated physicians who advocated for aggressive opioid prescribing. Organizations like the American Pain Foundation (which received 90% of its funding from opioid manufacturers and dissolved in 2012 after a U.S. Senate investigation) served as industry-friendly advocacy platforms
- **Pain as the Fifth Vital Sign**: In 2001, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO)--under influence from the pain management advocacy community with pharmaceutical industry ties--adopted pain management standards that effectively pressured hospitals and physicians to increase opioid prescribing
- **Continuing medical education**: Pharmaceutical companies funded thousands of continuing medical education (CME) programs promoting opioid use for chronic pain, reaching an estimated 20,000+ physicians annually
- **State medical board pressure**: Multiple state medical boards adopted policies threatening disciplinary action against physicians who "undertreated" pain, creating an asymmetric enforcement environment where prescribing too many opioids carried less professional risk than prescribing too few
- **Prescription volume**: Total opioid prescriptions rose from approximately 76 million in 1991 to a peak of 255 million in 2012--enough for every adult American to have a bottle of pills
- **Dosage escalation**: Average prescribed doses also increased, with high-dose prescriptions (more than 90 morphine milligram equivalents per day) becoming routine

### Early Warnings Ignored (1997-2007)

Evidence of harm emerged almost immediately after OxyContin's launch, but was systematically dismissed:

- **1997-2000**: Reports of OxyContin abuse, crushing, and injection surfaced in Appalachian communities. Purdue's internal data showed abuse rates rising. The company's response was to blame users rather than its product
- **2001**: The *New York Times* published "The Alchemy of OxyContin," one of the first major media exposés. Purdue attributed the problem to a small number of "criminals" who misused the drug
- **2001**: DEA flagged disproportionate OxyContin distribution to certain pharmacies and regions; Purdue resisted calls for reformulation
- **2003**: The General Accounting Office (GAO) report found that Purdue's promotion had minimized OxyContin's addictive potential and overstated the abuse-deterrent properties of its controlled-release formulation
- **2004**: A Purdue Pharma internal study showed that the controlled-release mechanism was not as effective as claimed--the drug delivered its opioid load faster than marketed, contributing to abuse potential. This study was not shared with the FDA or physicians
- **2007**: Purdue Frederick (a Purdue subsidiary) pled guilty to a federal felony charge of "misbranding" OxyContin--a charge that understated the severity of the company's conduct. Three executives pled guilty to misdemeanor charges. The total fine was $634 million--a fraction of OxyContin revenues. No individual went to prison

### The Sackler Family

The Sackler family, which privately owned Purdue Pharma, played a direct role in the company's marketing strategy:

- **Richard Sackler** served as Purdue's president and was personally involved in OxyContin strategy. Internal emails released during litigation showed him urging sales teams to "hammer" reluctant prescribers and writing in 2001 that abusers of OxyContin were "the culprits and the problem" rather than the drug itself
- **Family wealth**: The Sackler family extracted an estimated $10-12 billion from Purdue Pharma between 2008 and 2018, even as the company faced mounting litigation, transferring assets to family trusts and offshore accounts
- **Philanthropy**: The Sackler name appeared on wings and galleries at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Smithsonian, the Louvre, and numerous universities. Beginning in 2019, many institutions began refusing Sackler donations or removing the name
- **Bankruptcy and immunity**: Purdue Pharma filed for bankruptcy in 2019. The Sackler family negotiated a settlement providing them with broad civil immunity in exchange for payments initially valued at $4.5 billion, later revised to $6 billion after the Supreme Court rejected the initial settlement structure in *Harrington v. Purdue Pharma* (2024)

### Other Pharmaceutical Actors

Purdue was not alone. The broader industry contributed significantly:

- **Johnson & Johnson**: Through its subsidiary Tasmanian Alkaloids (later Noramco), J&J was the dominant supplier of raw opiate materials used to manufacture opioids. J&J also marketed its own opioid products and was found liable by an Oklahoma court in 2019 (later overturned on state-specific legal grounds)
- **Insys Therapeutics**: Marketed Subsys, a fentanyl spray, through a bribery scheme that paid kickbacks to prescribers. Founder John Kapoor was convicted of racketeering in 2019 and sentenced to 66 months in prison--one of the few pharmaceutical executives to face criminal consequences
- **Mallinckrodt**: The nation's largest producer of generic oxycodone, Mallinckrodt was accused of ignoring suspicious orders. It filed for bankruptcy in 2020
- **Distributors (McKesson, Cardinal Health, AmerisourceBergen)**: The "Big Three" distributors were legally required to maintain systems to detect and report suspicious orders. Evidence showed they shipped millions of pills to small-town pharmacies at volumes impossible to reconcile with legitimate medical use. A DEA database revealed that 76 billion oxycodone and hydrocodone pills were distributed between 2006 and 2012

## Wave Two: Heroin Resurgence (2010-2015)

### The Transition

As prescription opioid access tightened through reformulation (abuse-deterrent OxyContin launched in 2010), prescription monitoring programs (PDMPs), and law enforcement action against "pill mills," many people with established opioid dependence transitioned to heroin:

- **Economics**: A single OxyContin pill could cost $40-80 on the black market, while a comparable dose of heroin cost $5-10
- **Reformulation effect**: The introduction of abuse-deterrent OxyContin in 2010 eliminated the ability to crush and snort or inject the drug, accelerating the transition to heroin
- **Supply availability**: Mexican drug trafficking organizations responded to growing demand by increasing heroin production and expanding distribution networks into suburban and rural areas that had not previously been major heroin markets
- **Demographic shift**: Unlike earlier heroin epidemics centered in urban areas with predominantly minority users, the new heroin market followed the geographic and demographic pattern of prescription opioid misuse--primarily affecting white, suburban, and rural populations

### Heroin Death Trends

| Year | Heroin Overdose Deaths | % Change from Previous Year | Source |
|------|------------------------|----------------------------|--------|
| 2010 | 3,036 | - | CDC WONDER |
| 2011 | 4,397 | +45% | CDC WONDER |
| 2012 | 5,925 | +35% | CDC WONDER |
| 2013 | 8,257 | +39% | CDC WONDER |
| 2014 | 10,574 | +28% | CDC WONDER |
| 2015 | 12,989 | +23% | CDC WONDER |
| 2016 | 15,469 | +19% | CDC WONDER |

The heroin death surge followed a clear temporal and geographic pattern linked to prescription opioid markets, confirming the "gateway" mechanism created by pharmaceutical industry marketing.

## Wave Three: Synthetic Opioids (2013-Present)

### Fentanyl's Emergence

The third and most lethal wave began with the appearance of illicitly manufactured fentanyl in U.S. drug markets around 2013:

- **2013-2014**: Fentanyl began appearing in heroin supplies in the northeastern United States, initially as an adulterant. Overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids (primarily fentanyl) rose from 3,105 in 2013 to 5,544 in 2014
- **2015-2016**: Fentanyl spread rapidly through eastern U.S. drug markets. Synthetic opioid deaths more than tripled from 9,580 in 2015 to 19,413 in 2016
- **2017-2019**: Fentanyl became the dominant opioid in most eastern and Midwestern markets, penetrated western markets, and began appearing in stimulant supplies. Deaths rose to 36,359 in 2019
- **2020-2021**: The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated deaths dramatically. Social isolation, treatment disruption, economic stress, and reduced access to harm reduction services contributed to a 55% increase in synthetic opioid deaths from 2019 to 2021 (36,359 to 70,601)
- **2022-2024**: Deaths plateaued at approximately 73,000-74,000 annually before provisional 2024 data suggested a modest decline

### Why Fentanyl Is Different

Fentanyl's characteristics fundamentally changed the crisis:

- **Potency**: 50-100 times more potent than morphine, meaning lethal doses are measured in milligrams
- **Profit margin**: Synthesis from chemical precursors is far cheaper than cultivating opium poppies, creating larger profit margins for traffickers
- **Compact volume**: A kilogram of fentanyl is equivalent to approximately 50 kilograms of heroin in potency, making interdiction through volume-based methods far less effective
- **Inconsistent dosing**: Unlike pharmaceutical products, illicitly pressed pills and mixed powder batches contain wildly variable amounts of fentanyl, making every use a potential lethal event
- **Market contamination**: Fentanyl has been detected in cocaine, methamphetamine, and counterfeit prescription pills, exposing users who do not intend to consume opioids

## Government Response Timeline

### Federal Response

| Year | Action | Significance |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 2010 | Abuse-deterrent OxyContin introduced | Reduced OxyContin abuse but accelerated heroin transition |
| 2011 | DEA "Operation Pill Nation" | Targeted Florida pill mills; first major enforcement action |
| 2012 | FDA REMS for extended-release opioids | Required manufacturer-funded prescriber education |
| 2016 | CDC Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain | Recommended lower doses, shorter durations; highly influential but initially voluntary |
| 2016 | Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) | Expanded naloxone, authorized NPs/PAs for buprenorphine |
| 2016 | 21st Century Cures Act | $1 billion over two years for state opioid grants |
| 2017 | President Trump declared public health emergency | Symbolic but did not unlock significant new funding |
| 2018 | SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act | Most comprehensive opioid legislation; expanded MAT, Medicaid coverage, telehealth |
| 2020 | DEA temporary telehealth flexibility (COVID) | Allowed telehealth initiation of buprenorphine; later extended |
| 2022 | CDC updated prescribing guideline | Replaced 2016 guideline with more flexible, patient-centered approach |
| 2023 | X-waiver eliminated (Consolidated Appropriations Act) | Any DEA-registered practitioner can prescribe buprenorphine |
| 2023 | FDA approved OTC naloxone (Narcan nasal spray) | First over-the-counter opioid reversal agent |
| 2023 | White House xylazine response plan | Addressed emerging fentanyl-xylazine threat |

### State and Local Responses

States and localities have been both laboratories of innovation and sites of policy failure:

- **Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs)**: All 50 states now have operational PDMPs, though their comprehensiveness and integration vary widely. The most effective programs (like those in Kentucky and New York) require prescriber consultation before every opioid prescription
- **Naloxone access laws**: 50 states and D.C. have enacted laws expanding naloxone access through standing orders, pharmacist prescribing, or third-party prescriptions
- **Good Samaritan laws**: 48 states and D.C. have enacted laws providing legal protection to people who call 911 to report an overdose
- **Syringe services programs (SSPs)**: Authorized in approximately 40 states, SSPs provide sterile injection equipment, naloxone, disease testing, and linkage to treatment
- **Drug courts**: More than 3,800 drug courts operate across all 50 states, diverting eligible defendants from incarceration to supervised treatment
- **Medicaid expansion**: States that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act saw larger gains in substance use disorder treatment and smaller increases in overdose mortality

## The Litigation Era (2014-Present)

### Origins of Litigation

The opioid litigation was modeled in part on the 1990s tobacco litigation but has far exceeded it in complexity:

- **2014**: The first wave of local government lawsuits was filed against opioid manufacturers and distributors, alleging public nuisance, fraud, and negligence
- **2017**: Multidistrict litigation (MDL) consolidated thousands of federal cases before Judge Dan Polster in the Northern District of Ohio (*In re: National Prescription Opiate Litigation*, MDL No. 2804)
- **2019**: Purdue Pharma filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
- **2019**: Oklahoma trial against Johnson & Johnson resulted in a $465 million judgment (later reversed on state-specific grounds)
- **2021-2024**: Major settlements with manufacturers, distributors, and pharmacy chains totaling more than $50 billion
- **2024**: Supreme Court decided *Harrington v. Purdue Pharma*, rejecting the initial bankruptcy plan that provided broad civil immunity to the Sackler family. Subsequent renegotiation produced a revised plan with increased Sackler payments

### Settlement Fund Allocation

The allocation of settlement funds has become a critical policy issue. Learning from the tobacco settlement experience--where most funds were diverted to general government revenue--most opioid settlement agreements include:

- **Allocation frameworks**: Typically 15% to state government, 15% to a statewide fund, and 70% to local governments and regional trusts
- **Use restrictions**: Funds must generally be used for opioid abatement purposes, with approved use lists typically including treatment, prevention, harm reduction, and criminal justice programs
- **Oversight mechanisms**: Many states have created independent oversight boards, though their authority and independence vary
- **Distribution timelines**: Most settlements distribute funds over 15-18 years, creating long-term funding streams but limiting immediate impact

## Lessons of History

The history of the opioid crisis yields several critical lessons for policy:

1. **Industry self-regulation fails catastrophically when profit incentives are misaligned with public health**: The pharmaceutical industry's decades-long campaign to expand opioid prescribing demonstrates that voluntary compliance and self-policing are insufficient safeguards
2. **Regulatory agencies can be captured**: The FDA's approval of OxyContin's misleading labeling and its slow response to mounting evidence of harm reflect systemic vulnerability to industry influence
3. **Supply-side restrictions alone are insufficient and can cause harm**: Tightening prescription access without simultaneously expanding treatment pushes dependent populations to more dangerous illicit markets
4. **The "Three Waves" model is misleading if taken literally**: The waves overlap significantly, and all three continue to operate simultaneously. Prescription opioid misuse has not ended; heroin use continues; and fentanyl now pervades all categories
5. **Economic despair creates vulnerability**: The geographic pattern of the crisis--concentrated in deindustrialized regions, rural areas with limited economic opportunity, and communities with weakened social infrastructure--demonstrates that addiction epidemics exploit existing social fractures
6. **Stigma kills**: The decades-long characterization of addiction as a moral failing rather than a medical condition has delayed treatment expansion, discouraged people from seeking help, and enabled punitive policies that increase harm
