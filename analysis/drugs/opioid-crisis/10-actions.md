# The Opioid Crisis: Citizen Actions

## Overview

Every American can contribute to addressing the opioid crisis, regardless of whether they are personally affected by addiction. The actions in this guide range from immediate life-saving steps (carrying naloxone) to sustained civic engagement (advocating for policy reform). They are organized by the level of commitment and expertise required.

## Immediate Actions: Save Lives Today

### 1. Get Trained in Naloxone Administration

Naloxone (Narcan) is an opioid overdose reversal medication that is safe, effective, and now available over the counter. Any person can administer it.

**How to get trained**:
- Contact your local health department for free naloxone training sessions
- Visit https://www.getnaloxonetraining.org/ for online training
- Many pharmacies offer brief training when dispensing naloxone
- NEXT Distro (https://nextdistro.org/) ships free naloxone by mail in most states

**How to get naloxone**:
- Purchase OTC Narcan nasal spray at any pharmacy (~$45 per 2-dose kit)
- Obtain free naloxone through local harm reduction organizations or public health programs
- Request a prescription from your physician (may be covered by insurance with zero copay)
- Check your state's standing order provisions, which allow pharmacists to dispense without an individual prescription

**When to carry naloxone**:
- If you or anyone in your household takes opioid medications
- If you have family members or friends who use substances
- If you work in settings where overdoses may occur (shelters, social services, hospitality, construction)
- If you live in a community with high overdose rates
- Consider keeping naloxone in your home, vehicle, or workplace as you would a first aid kit

### 2. Learn to Recognize an Overdose

An opioid overdose may present as:
- Slow, shallow, or stopped breathing
- Blue or gray lips and fingertips (cyanosis)
- Pinpoint (very small) pupils
- Unresponsiveness to stimulation (sternal rub, loud voice)
- Gurgling or choking sounds
- Limp body

**What to do**:
1. Call 911 immediately
2. Administer naloxone if available (nasal spray into one nostril)
3. If no response in 2-3 minutes, administer a second dose
4. Place person in the recovery position (on their side)
5. Perform rescue breathing if trained
6. Stay with the person until emergency services arrive
7. Be aware that Good Samaritan laws in 48 states protect people who call 911 to report an overdose from prosecution for drug possession

### 3. Safely Store and Dispose of Medications

- **Lock up opioid medications**: Use a medication lockbox if anyone in the household is at risk
- **Dispose of unused opioids**: Use DEA Take Back Day events (held biannually), permanent drop-off locations at pharmacies and police stations, or FDA-authorized disposal methods (mixing with coffee grounds, cat litter, or dirt in a sealed container)
- **Do not flush medications** unless the FDA specifically authorizes flushing for that product
- **Inventory your medicine cabinet**: Discard expired medications and opioids that are no longer needed

## Community Engagement Actions

### 4. Support Local Treatment and Harm Reduction Services

**Volunteer opportunities**:
- Syringe services programs need volunteers for supplies distribution, data entry, and outreach
- Recovery community organizations welcome volunteers for peer support, event organizing, and advocacy
- Naloxone distribution events need volunteers for training and kit assembly
- Community health centers may need volunteers for intake, navigation, and follow-up support

**Donate**:
- Local harm reduction organizations
- Shatterproof (https://www.shatterproof.org/)
- National Harm Reduction Coalition (https://harmreduction.org/)
- Your local community health center's substance use disorder program
- NEXT Distro naloxone mail distribution (https://nextdistro.org/)

**Host or attend community events**:
- International Overdose Awareness Day (August 31)
- National Recovery Month (September)
- Red Sand Project and other awareness campaigns
- Community forums on opioid response
- Public hearings on settlement fund allocation

### 5. Reduce Stigma

Stigma is one of the most powerful barriers to treatment-seeking and policy reform. Individual actions matter:

- **Use non-stigmatizing language**: Say "person with opioid use disorder" rather than "addict," "junkie," or "drug abuser." Say "medication-assisted treatment" or "medication for opioid use disorder" rather than "replacement therapy" or "substituting one drug for another"
- **Educate yourself and others**: Share accurate information about addiction as a chronic medical condition with neurobiological underpinnings, not a moral failing or character defect
- **Challenge stigmatizing statements**: When you hear someone characterize addiction as a choice or moral failure, respectfully provide evidence-based context
- **Support people in recovery**: Treat recovery as you would recovery from any chronic illness--with respect, encouragement, and practical support
- **Advocate for workplace inclusion**: Support hiring people in recovery and oppose employment discrimination based on substance use disorder history

### 6. Support Affected Families

- If someone you know has a family member with OUD, offer specific practical help (childcare, meals, transportation) rather than generic sympathy
- Share information about family support resources: Partnership to End Addiction helpline (1-855-DRUGFREE), Al-Anon, Nar-Anon, CRAFT (Community Reinforcement and Family Training)
- Do not blame families for their loved one's addiction
- If someone discloses a family member's overdose death, treat it with the same compassion you would any other cause of death

## Civic and Political Actions

### 7. Advocate for Evidence-Based Policy

**Contact your elected representatives** about the following priority issues:

- **Federal level**: Increased SAMHSA funding, methadone reform, permanent telehealth MAT authorization, FDA reform, settlement fund oversight
- **State level**: Medicaid MAT coverage, harm reduction authorization, settlement fund allocation, MAT in correctional settings, Good Samaritan law protections
- **Local level**: Naloxone availability, syringe services program authorization, police diversion/deflection programs, settlement fund spending priorities

**How to contact representatives effectively**:
- Phone calls are most impactful for Congressional offices (find your representatives at https://www.congress.gov/members/find-your-member)
- State and local officials are often more responsive to constituent contact
- Attend town halls and ask specific questions about opioid policy
- Submit written testimony for legislative hearings
- Participate in public comment periods for proposed regulations

### 8. Monitor Settlement Fund Spending

**Why it matters**: More than $50 billion in opioid settlement funds is being distributed to state and local governments over the next 15-18 years. Whether these funds are directed to evidence-based treatment, prevention, and harm reduction--or diverted to general government budgets--will significantly affect the crisis trajectory.

**What you can do**:
- Attend public meetings where settlement fund allocation is discussed
- Request transparency reports from your state attorney general's office
- Support independent settlement fund oversight boards
- Contact local officials about evidence-based allocation of settlement funds
- Join or support organizations tracking settlement spending (e.g., Christine Minhee's OpioidSettlementTracker.com)

### 9. Support Harm Reduction in Your Community

When harm reduction services (syringe programs, naloxone distribution, potential safe consumption sites) are proposed in your community:
- Attend public hearings and speak in support
- Counter misinformation about harm reduction with evidence
- Engage neighbors who may have concerns with information about program benefits and safeguards
- Write letters to local newspapers and media outlets
- Share evidence from successful programs in other communities

---

## Workplace Actions

### 10. Promote Opioid Awareness at Work

- **Encourage employer naloxone policies**: Advocate for workplace naloxone availability, especially in high-risk industries (construction, hospitality, manufacturing)
- **Support Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs)**: Ensure your workplace EAP includes substance use disorder resources and promote awareness of these services
- **Reduce workplace stigma**: Advocate for workplace policies that support employees seeking treatment, including leave policies for addiction treatment comparable to those for other medical conditions
- **Safe prescribing after workplace injuries**: Advocate for evidence-based post-injury pain management protocols that emphasize non-opioid approaches and limit opioid prescriptions

## Template Letters for Advocacy

### Template: Letter to Federal Legislator Supporting MAT Expansion

```text
[Your Name]
[Your Address]
[Date]

The Honorable [Name]
[Office Address]

Dear [Senator/Representative] [Last Name]:

As your constituent from [City/Town], I urge you to support legislation
expanding access to medication-assisted treatment (MAT) for opioid use
disorder. The opioid crisis continues to claim more than 80,000 American
lives each year, and only 22% of people with opioid use disorder receive
the evidence-based treatment that can cut their mortality risk in half.

Specifically, I ask you to support:

1. Increased funding for SAMHSA State Opioid Response grants
2. Reform of methadone regulations to allow office-based prescribing
3. Permanent authorization of telehealth for MAT
4. Mandatory MAT provision in all federally funded correctional settings
5. Loan forgiveness programs for addiction medicine professionals

The evidence is clear: medication-assisted treatment saves lives, reduces
crime, and is cost-effective. I urge you to prioritize this issue.

Thank you for your service and attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
```

### Template: Letter to State Legislator on Settlement Fund Oversight

```text
[Your Name]
[Your Address]
[Date]

The Honorable [Name]
[State Legislature Address]

Dear [Title] [Last Name]:

I write to urge you to support strong oversight and evidence-based
allocation of opioid settlement funds in [State]. Our state is expected
to receive [estimated amount] over the next 15-18 years from opioid
litigation settlements.

The tobacco settlement experience teaches us that without strong
oversight, these funds will be diverted to general government budgets
rather than addressing the crisis they were intended to remedy.

I urge you to support:

1. An independent settlement fund oversight board with representation
   from public health experts, treatment providers, and people with
   lived experience of addiction and recovery
2. Mandatory public reporting of all settlement fund expenditures
3. Evidence-based allocation priorities including medication-assisted
   treatment, naloxone distribution, harm reduction services,
   prevention programs, and recovery support
4. Prohibition on using settlement funds to supplant existing
   government spending on opioid response

[State]'s families deserve assurance that these funds will be used to
save lives, not to fill budget holes.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
```

### Template: Letter to Local Officials Supporting Harm Reduction

```text
[Your Name]
[Your Address]
[Date]

[Official Name and Title]
[Office Address]

Dear [Title] [Last Name]:

I am writing to express my support for [specific harm reduction program,
e.g., syringe services program, naloxone distribution site] in our
community. I understand this proposal may generate concern, and I want
to share what the evidence shows.

Thirty years of research across dozens of countries demonstrates that
harm reduction services:

- Reduce overdose deaths in surrounding areas
- Reduce HIV and hepatitis C transmission by 50% or more
- Increase entry into drug treatment (participants are 5x more likely
  to enter treatment)
- Do NOT increase drug use in surrounding communities
- Save money through avoided healthcare costs ($7-19 per dollar invested)

Our community is losing [number] people per year to overdose. Harm
reduction services are not a replacement for treatment or prevention--
they are a complement that keeps people alive long enough to reach
recovery.

I urge you to support this program and ensure it receives the resources
and community cooperation it needs to succeed.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
```
