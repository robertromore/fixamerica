# Opioid Crisis

The opioid crisis represents the deadliest drug epidemic in American history, having claimed more than 700,000 lives from opioid-involved overdoses since 1999. What began with the aggressive marketing of prescription opioids--particularly OxyContin by Purdue Pharma starting in 1996--evolved into a multi-wave catastrophe that now centers on illicitly manufactured fentanyl and its analogs. The crisis has devastated communities across every demographic and geographic category, though rural Appalachian and Rust Belt regions, Native American communities, and increasingly Black and Latino populations have been disproportionately affected.

This analysis examines the opioid crisis as a systemic failure spanning the pharmaceutical industry, federal regulatory agencies, the healthcare system, law enforcement, and the social safety net. It traces the historical arc from aggressive prescribing through the transition to heroin and the emergence of fentanyl, analyzes the root causes that allowed each wave to develop, and evaluates the full spectrum of responses from medication-assisted treatment expansion to supply-side interdiction. The analysis also addresses the unprecedented litigation that has resulted in more than $50 billion in settlements from pharmaceutical manufacturers and distributors, and the ongoing debate over how those funds should be allocated.

The crisis continues to evolve rapidly, with synthetic opioids now accounting for the vast majority of overdose deaths and new challenges emerging from the contamination of stimulant supplies with fentanyl. Effective response requires coordinating across federal, state, and local governments; integrating public health and public safety approaches; expanding treatment capacity while reducing stigma; and holding accountable the corporate actors whose decisions fueled the epidemic.
