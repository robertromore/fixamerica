# The Opioid Crisis: Opposition to Reform

## Overview

Efforts to address the opioid crisis through evidence-based treatment expansion, harm reduction, regulatory reform, and corporate accountability face opposition from diverse sources with distinct motivations. Some opposition is rooted in genuine philosophical disagreements about the nature of addiction and the proper role of government. Some reflects economic interests threatened by reform. Some arises from cultural attitudes about drug use, personal responsibility, and morality. Understanding these sources of opposition--and distinguishing principled objections from self-interested obstruction--is essential to building effective reform coalitions.

## Opposition to Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) Expansion

### The Abstinence-Only Treatment Establishment

**Who**: Some residential treatment facilities, 12-step purist organizations, drug court judges, faith-based recovery programs, and segments of the recovery community

**Arguments Against MAT**:
- MAT "replaces one drug with another" and does not represent genuine recovery
- Long-term MAT use creates dependence on medication and does not address underlying psychological and spiritual issues
- Patients on MAT are not truly "clean" or "sober" and should not be considered in recovery
- Abstinence-based approaches are morally superior because they require complete freedom from all substances
- MAT undermines the discipline and personal responsibility that recovery requires

**Rebuttals**:
- MAT reduces all-cause mortality by approximately 50%, making it the most effective treatment available for opioid use disorder (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2019)
- Buprenorphine and methadone stabilize brain chemistry without producing euphoria at therapeutic doses, functioning analogously to insulin for diabetes or antihypertensives for high blood pressure
- Abstinence-only approaches have significantly higher relapse rates (60-90% within 12 months) compared to MAT (30-50% relapse rates with good retention)
- The American Society of Addiction Medicine, American Medical Association, and World Health Organization all classify MAT as first-line treatment
- Characterizing MAT as "not real recovery" deters treatment-seeking and contributes to the treatment gap that kills tens of thousands annually
- People on MAT demonstrate improved employment, reduced criminal activity, reduced infectious disease transmission, and improved family functioning

**Underlying Dynamics**:
- Many residential treatment facilities depend financially on the abstinence-only model and would face competitive pressure if MAT becomes standard
- Cultural investment in abstinence as a marker of moral strength creates identity-based resistance to medication
- Some drug court judges impose abstinence requirements as conditions of participation, effectively barring MAT patients
- Insurance reimbursement structures have historically favored residential treatment over outpatient MAT

### Criminal Justice System Resistance

**Who**: Some drug court judges, corrections administrators, probation/parole officers, and prosecutors

**Arguments Against MAT in Criminal Justice Settings**:
- MAT medications are themselves controlled substances and are inconsistent with a drug-free corrections environment
- Diversion risk: buprenorphine and methadone have street value and can be diverted within correctional facilities
- Security concerns related to medication administration in correctional settings
- Philosophical commitment to abstinence as a component of accountability and rehabilitation

**Rebuttals**:
- Discontinuing MAT upon incarceration dramatically increases overdose death risk upon release (12.7x mortality risk in first two weeks post-release, *NEJM*, 2007)
- The Rhode Island Department of Corrections demonstrated a 61% reduction in post-release overdose deaths after implementing universal MAT screening and provision (Green et al., *JAMA Psychiatry*, 2018)
- Federal courts have increasingly ruled that denying MAT to incarcerated individuals violates the Eighth Amendment and ADA protections (*Pesce v. Coppinger*, *Smith v. Aroostook County*)
- Diversion risk can be managed through observed dosing protocols and long-acting formulations (e.g., injectable buprenorphine)

## Opposition to Harm Reduction

### Opposition to Syringe Services Programs (SSPs)

**Who**: Law enforcement associations, some elected officials (particularly in conservative jurisdictions), neighborhood opposition groups, "not in my backyard" (NIMBY) advocates

**Arguments Against SSPs**:
- Providing clean syringes "enables" and "condones" drug use
- SSPs attract drug users to neighborhoods, increasing crime, disorder, and public drug use
- Public resources should fund treatment, not drug paraphernalia
- SSPs send a message that society has given up on abstinence
- Religious and moral objections to facilitating drug use

**Rebuttals**:
- Thirty years of research across multiple countries demonstrates that SSPs reduce HIV and hepatitis C transmission by 50% or more without increasing drug use (CDC, WHO, National Academies)
- SSPs serve as critical entry points to treatment; participants are five times more likely to enter treatment than non-participants (Hagan et al., *American Journal of Public Health*, 2000)
- SSPs reduce community needle litter and improper disposal
- The federal government has permitted use of funds for SSPs since 2016 (excluding purchase of syringes themselves until 2022)
- Cost-benefit analysis consistently shows SSPs save money through avoided HIV/HCV treatment costs ($7-19 saved per dollar spent, Nguyen et al., 2014)

### Opposition to Safe Consumption Sites (SCS)

**Who**: Federal enforcement agencies (DOJ has historically opposed SCS), many elected officials of both parties, law enforcement, neighborhood groups

**Arguments Against SCS**:
- Federal law (21 U.S.C. 856, the "crack house statute") prohibits maintaining premises for the purpose of drug use
- SCS normalize and facilitate illegal drug use
- SCS attract drug markets, crime, and disorder to surrounding areas
- Public money should not subsidize drug use
- SCS represent a failure of societal expectations

**Rebuttals**:
- International evidence from more than 100 SCS operating in 12 countries shows zero overdose deaths at supervised sites (EMCDDA, 2023)
- The first authorized SCS in North America (Insite, Vancouver) reduced overdose deaths in the surrounding area by 35% and increased treatment entries by 30% (*Lancet*, 2011)
- New York City opened the first authorized U.S. SCS in November 2021; in its first year, staff reversed more than 700 overdoses and connected hundreds to treatment
- Legal challenges remain: the Third Circuit ruled in *United States v. Safehouse* (2021) that a proposed Philadelphia SCS would violate federal law, though the legal landscape continues to evolve
- Site-level evidence does not support claims of increased crime or disorder in surrounding areas

### Opposition to Drug Checking Services

**Who**: Some law enforcement agencies, prosecutors who view providing drug checking equipment as facilitating drug use

**Arguments Against Drug Checking**:
- Fentanyl test strips were classified as drug paraphernalia in many states (now changed in most)
- Drug checking may provide a "false sense of security" because it cannot detect all contaminants or provide quantitative dosing information
- Resources should focus on getting people to stop using drugs, not making drug use safer

**Rebuttals**:
- Studies show that people who use fentanyl test strips and find their drugs contain fentanyl are significantly more likely to change their behavior (use less, use with someone present, have naloxone available) (Johns Hopkins, 2018)
- As of 2024, at least 35 states have legalized fentanyl test strips
- Drug checking is a low-cost intervention (test strips cost approximately $1 each) that can prevent deaths
- Mass spectrometry-based drug checking services (available in some harm reduction programs) provide more detailed analysis

## Opposition to Regulatory Reform

### Pharmaceutical Industry Opposition

**Who**: Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), industry lobbyists, some patient advocacy groups with industry funding

**Arguments Against Stricter Regulation**:
- Excessive regulation restricts patient access to needed pain medications
- Post-market requirements increase costs and delay drug availability
- The industry has already reformed its practices voluntarily
- Regulatory burden drives innovation offshore
- Settlements have already imposed sufficient accountability

**Rebuttals**:
- Industry self-regulation demonstrably failed during the opioid crisis; voluntary measures were adopted only after litigation and public pressure forced change
- The industry spent $880 million on opioid-related lobbying between 2006 and 2015 specifically to weaken regulatory oversight
- Post-market surveillance failures (failure to detect and act on OxyContin abuse signals) cost hundreds of thousands of lives
- Settlements, while large in absolute terms, represent a fraction of the revenue generated from opioid sales and the costs imposed on society ($1 trillion annual economic burden)

### Opposition to Prescribing Guidelines

**Who**: Chronic pain patient advocacy groups, some physicians, libertarian-leaning organizations

**Arguments Against Prescribing Restrictions**:
- The CDC's 2016 Guideline for Prescribing Opioids was misapplied as rigid rules by insurers, pharmacies, and state legislatures, leading to forced tapering and patient abandonment
- Chronic pain patients who are stable on long-term opioid therapy should not have their prescriptions reduced or eliminated
- "One-size-fits-all" dosage limits ignore individual patient variation
- Prescribing restrictions have driven patients to suicide when their pain becomes unmanageable
- Physicians should make prescribing decisions based on individual patient assessment, not population-level guidelines

**Rebuttals and Nuance**:
- These concerns have substantial legitimacy. The 2016 CDC Guideline was widely misapplied, and the CDC's 2022 updated guideline explicitly addresses this problem, emphasizing individualized care and opposing rigid dose thresholds
- The goal should be appropriate prescribing, not minimal prescribing
- Patient abandonment--forced tapering without alternatives or consent--is a genuine harm that has been documented and should be prohibited
- However, the original overprescribing that created the crisis was also driven by individual physician decisions influenced by industry marketing; the solution requires both clinical judgment and evidence-based guardrails
- This is one area where opposition arguments have led to genuine policy improvement (the revised 2022 CDC guideline)

## Opposition to Litigation and Accountability

### Industry Defense Arguments

**Who**: Pharmaceutical companies, distributors, defense attorneys, some free-market advocates

**Arguments Against Opioid Litigation**:
- Opioid manufacturers produced FDA-approved medications prescribed by licensed physicians; liability should rest with prescribers, not manufacturers
- Public nuisance theory (used in many opioid cases) inappropriately extends tort liability beyond its traditional boundaries
- Litigation diverts resources from patient care and treatment
- Settlement funds will be wasted by governments, as occurred with tobacco settlement money
- The litigation amounts to a "shakedown" of legitimate businesses
- Individual responsibility: patients chose to use opioids and bear personal responsibility for addiction

**Rebuttals**:
- Internal documents revealed during litigation demonstrate that manufacturers knew their products were being abused and actively concealed this information
- Distributors were legally required to maintain suspicious order monitoring systems and demonstrably failed to do so
- The "blame the prescriber" argument ignores that prescribers were systematically misled by manufacturer-funded education and marketing
- Public nuisance theory has been used in lead paint, tobacco, and environmental contamination cases; its application to opioids follows established precedent
- The economic costs imposed by the crisis ($1 trillion annually) far exceed settlement amounts
- Settlement agreements include use restrictions designed to prevent the tobacco settlement diversion problem

### Opposition to Settlement Fund Oversight

**Who**: Some state and local government officials who prefer maximum flexibility in spending

**Arguments Against Strict Settlement Fund Use Requirements**:
- Local governments should have flexibility to allocate funds based on local needs
- Prescriptive use requirements prevent adaptation to changing circumstances
- Government oversight boards create additional bureaucracy
- Some affected jurisdictions need general revenue support because the crisis has depleted budgets

**Rebuttals**:
- The tobacco settlement experience demonstrates that without use restrictions, the vast majority of funds will be diverted to general budgets
- Evidence-based allocation (treatment, prevention, harm reduction) produces the largest public health return on investment
- Independent oversight boards provide accountability and prevent political capture of funds
- Flexible spending categories within an opioid-related framework can accommodate local variation while maintaining focus

## Opposition to Decriminalization and Diversion

### Law Enforcement and Prosecutorial Opposition

**Who**: Some district attorneys, police unions, drug enforcement agencies, "tough on crime" advocates

**Arguments Against Decriminalizing Drug Possession**:
- Criminal penalties serve as a deterrent to drug use
- Court-mandated treatment (drug courts) requires the leverage of criminal penalties to be effective
- Decriminalization sends a message that drug use is acceptable
- Oregon's Measure 110 (drug decriminalization, passed 2020) has not produced the hoped-for treatment increases and has coincided with increased public drug use (Oregon voters partially repealed Measure 110 in 2024)
- Removing criminal penalties eliminates a pathway to treatment for people who would not seek help voluntarily

**Rebuttals**:
- Decades of evidence from Portugal (decriminalized all drugs in 2001) show that decriminalization combined with treatment investment reduces drug use, overdose deaths, HIV transmission, and incarceration costs
- The deterrent effect of criminal penalties on drug use is not supported by cross-national evidence; countries with harsh penalties do not have lower use rates
- Oregon's experience is better explained by implementation failures (inadequate treatment infrastructure, slow funding deployment) than by the principle of decriminalization itself
- Criminal records create barriers to employment, housing, and education that impede recovery
- Diversion programs (police-assisted referral to treatment without arrest) are showing promising results in jurisdictions across the country

**Nuance**: The Oregon experience has genuinely complicated the decriminalization argument, and advocates must grapple with the lesson that decriminalization without adequate treatment infrastructure is insufficient. Opposition arguments on this point have empirical support that should inform policy design.

## Opposition to Naloxone Expansion

### Limited but Persistent Opposition

**Who**: A small number of elected officials, some community members, occasional law enforcement voices

**Arguments Against Expanded Naloxone Access**:
- Naloxone creates a "safety net" that encourages riskier drug use (moral hazard argument)
- Repeated naloxone administration to the same individuals wastes resources
- Naloxone distribution normalizes drug use
- Resources should focus on prevention and treatment, not enabling continued use

**Rebuttals**:
- No peer-reviewed study has found that naloxone access increases drug use or risky behavior
- The alternative to naloxone administration is death; every reversal is a life saved and a potential treatment entry point
- Cost-effectiveness analysis consistently supports naloxone distribution ($438 per quality-adjusted life year gained; well below standard cost-effectiveness thresholds)
- Naloxone distribution does not preclude simultaneous investment in prevention and treatment
- Opposition to naloxone is declining; it now has broad bipartisan support, and OTC availability reflects this consensus

---

## Opposition to Federal Funding

### Fiscal Conservative Opposition

**Who**: Budget hawks in Congress, some taxpayer advocacy groups, ideological opponents of federal spending

**Arguments Against Increased Federal Opioid Funding**:
- The federal government should not subsidize treatment for conditions resulting from personal choices
- State and local governments should bear primary responsibility
- Settlement funds should replace, not supplement, federal funding
- Existing funding is poorly managed and has not produced results commensurate with investment
- Federal spending creates dependency and displaces private-sector and charitable responses

**Rebuttals**:
- The crisis was fueled by federal regulatory failures (FDA, DEA) and federal policy decisions; federal responsibility for response is appropriate
- State and local capacity varies enormously; the most affected jurisdictions are often the least able to fund response
- Settlement funds, while significant, are distributed over 15-18 years and are insufficient to close the treatment gap
- Federal funding has demonstrably expanded treatment capacity; SAMHSA's State Opioid Response grants have funded hundreds of thousands of treatment episodes
- The $1 trillion annual economic cost of the crisis far exceeds federal response spending; failure to invest in response is itself a fiscal failure

## Organized Opposition Infrastructure

### Industry Lobbying

| Entity | Spending (2006-2015) | Primary Focus |
|--------|---------------------|---------------|
| Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) | $226 million | Federal drug policy, pricing, regulation |
| Purdue Pharma | $11.7 million | Opioid regulation, enforcement reform |
| Pain Care Forum (industry coalition) | $740 million (all members) | Prescribing guidelines, scheduling, enforcement |
| McKesson | $6.4 million | Distribution regulation, CSA enforcement |
| Cardinal Health | $5.8 million | Distribution regulation, DEA authority |

*Source: Center for Public Integrity/Associated Press investigation, 2016*

The Pain Care Forum--an industry-funded coalition of pharmaceutical companies, trade associations, and allied patient advocacy groups--coordinated lobbying across federal and state governments to oppose prescribing restrictions, weaken DEA enforcement authority, and block regulatory reform. Between 2006 and 2015, member organizations spent an estimated $740 million on political activities related to opioid policy.

### Astroturf Patient Advocacy

Several organizations that presented themselves as independent patient advocacy groups were substantially funded by the pharmaceutical industry:

- **American Pain Foundation**: Received 90% of its funding from opioid manufacturers. Dissolved in 2012 after a U.S. Senate investigation revealed the extent of industry influence
- **U.S. Pain Foundation**: Received substantial pharmaceutical funding while advocating against prescribing restrictions
- **American Academy of Pain Medicine**: Received significant industry support while issuing guidelines favorable to expanded opioid prescribing

The role of these organizations illustrates how industry funding can corrupt advocacy and create the appearance of grassroots support for industry positions.

## Evolving Opposition Landscape

Several opposition positions have weakened significantly in recent years:

| Position | Previous Strength | Current Strength | Driver of Change |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Opposition to MAT | Strong | Moderate | Evidence, litigation discoveries, workforce training |
| Opposition to naloxone | Moderate | Weak | Bipartisan support, FDA OTC approval, death toll |
| Opposition to SSPs | Strong | Moderate | Federal authorization, CDC evidence reviews |
| Opposition to prescribing guidelines | Moderate | Moderate-Strong | Legitimate patient harm from misapplication |
| Opposition to litigation | Strong | Weak | Overwhelming evidence of industry misconduct |
| Opposition to decriminalization | Strong | Moderate-Strong | Oregon experience complicated advocacy |
| Opposition to federal funding | Moderate | Moderate | Bipartisan crisis recognition, economic impact data |

The overall trajectory is toward greater acceptance of evidence-based approaches, though significant resistance remains in specific domains and jurisdictions. The most durable opposition comes from stakeholders with economic interests in the status quo and from deeply held cultural beliefs about drug use, personal responsibility, and the nature of addiction.
