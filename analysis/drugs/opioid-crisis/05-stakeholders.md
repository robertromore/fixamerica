# The Opioid Crisis: Stakeholders

## Overview

The opioid crisis involves an extraordinarily broad set of stakeholders spanning those directly affected by addiction, families and communities bearing its costs, healthcare providers caught between clinical demands and systemic constraints, pharmaceutical companies whose products and marketing created the crisis, government agencies responsible for regulation and response, and advocacy organizations working toward various--and sometimes competing--solutions. Understanding each stakeholder's interests, power, and constraints is essential to designing effective policy interventions.

## People Directly Affected

### People with Opioid Use Disorder (OUD)

**Population**: Approximately 5.6 million Americans (SAMHSA NSDUH, 2022)

**Interests**:
- Access to evidence-based treatment, particularly medication-assisted treatment (MAT)
- Reduction in stigma from healthcare providers, employers, and the public
- Protection from criminalization of addiction
- Access to harm reduction services (naloxone, syringe services, drug checking)
- Economic supports (housing, employment, education) that facilitate recovery
- Continuity of care, particularly during transitions (e.g., release from incarceration, changes in insurance)

**Power and Constraints**:
- Limited political power due to stigma, marginalization, and criminalization
- Growing advocacy voice through organizations like the National Alliance for Medication Assisted Recovery (NAMA Recovery) and VOCAL-NY
- Disproportionately poor, uninsured, and disconnected from political processes
- People actively using substances face the greatest barriers to accessing both treatment and political participation
- Recovery community has growing influence but remains underrepresented in policy decision-making

### People in Recovery

**Population**: Estimated 20+ million Americans in recovery from substance use disorders (Faces and Voices of Recovery, 2022)

**Interests**:
- Sustained access to recovery support services
- Protection from employment and housing discrimination
- Reduction in stigma
- Expansion of peer recovery support workforce
- Prevention of relapse through ongoing community support
- Ensuring that new policy responses reflect recovery experience

**Power and Constraints**:
- More politically engaged than active users
- Growing organizational infrastructure (recovery community organizations, peer support networks)
- Internal tension between abstinence-based and medication-assisted recovery communities limits unified advocacy
- Public disclosure of recovery status carries social and professional risk

### Families of People with OUD

**Population**: Tens of millions of Americans have a family member affected by opioid addiction

**Interests**:
- Treatment access for family members
- Family support services (Al-Anon, family therapy, respite)
- Accountability for pharmaceutical companies
- Prevention programs to protect younger family members
- Bereavement support for families who have lost members to overdose
- Clear, reliable information about treatment options

**Power and Constraints**:
- Significant political power when organized; family advocacy was instrumental in passing the SUPPORT Act
- Emotional narrative power in legislative testimony and media
- Range of views on appropriate responses (some favor enforcement-heavy approaches, others prioritize treatment and harm reduction)
- Organizations like Shatterproof and the Partnership to End Addiction mobilize family voice

## Stakeholder Power Mapping

| Stakeholder | Political Power | Financial Resources | Policy Alignment with Evidence | Organizational Capacity |
|------------|----------------|--------------------|---------------------------------|------------------------|
| Pharmaceutical industry (opioid mfrs.) | Moderate (declining) | High | Low | High |
| Pharmaceutical industry (treatment/naloxone) | Moderate | High | High | High |
| AMA / medical associations | High | High | Moderate-High | High |
| Federal agencies (DEA, FDA, SAMHSA) | High | High (govt. budgets) | Variable | High |
| State attorneys general | High | Moderate | Moderate-High | High |
| Insurance industry | High | High | Moderate | High |
| Recovery/advocacy organizations | Low-Moderate | Low | High | Moderate |
| People with active OUD | Very Low | Very Low | N/A | Very Low |
| Families of affected people | Moderate | Low | Variable | Moderate |
| Harm reduction organizations | Low | Low | High | Moderate |
| Law enforcement | High | Moderate | Variable | High |
| Local governments | Moderate | Low | Variable | Moderate |

The stakeholder power analysis reveals a fundamental inequity: the populations most affected by the crisis have the least political power, while the institutions most responsible for creating the crisis retain substantial influence. Effective policy requires amplifying the voices of affected communities and aligning powerful institutional stakeholders with evidence-based approaches.
