# The Opioid Crisis: Current State

## Overview

The opioid crisis remains the leading cause of injury death in the United States. After reaching a peak of approximately 111,000 total drug overdose deaths in the twelve-month period ending in April 2023, provisional data from the CDC suggests a modest decline to approximately 107,500 deaths in the twelve-month period ending in mid-2024. While any decline is welcome, the absolute number remains catastrophic--roughly equivalent to a fully loaded commercial airliner crashing every day with no survivors. Synthetic opioids, overwhelmingly illicitly manufactured fentanyl and its analogs, account for approximately 75% of all drug overdose deaths, a dominance that has fundamentally altered the risk landscape for every person who uses drugs.

The current phase of the crisis is characterized by several intersecting trends: the continued dominance of fentanyl in illicit drug markets, the increasing contamination of stimulant supplies (cocaine and methamphetamine) with fentanyl, rising overdose rates among Black and Native American populations, a slowly expanding but still grossly inadequate treatment infrastructure, and the early stages of distributing more than $50 billion in opioid litigation settlement funds.

## Overdose Mortality Data

### National Trends

| Year | Total Drug Overdose Deaths | Opioid-Involved Deaths | Synthetic Opioid Deaths | Source |
|------|---------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|--------|
| 2015 | 52,404 | 33,091 | 9,580 | CDC WONDER |
| 2017 | 70,237 | 47,600 | 28,466 | CDC WONDER |
| 2019 | 70,630 | 49,860 | 36,359 | CDC WONDER |
| 2020 | 91,799 | 68,630 | 56,516 | CDC WONDER |
| 2021 | 106,699 | 80,411 | 70,601 | CDC WONDER |
| 2022 | 107,941 | 81,083 | 73,838 | CDC WONDER |
| 2023 (provisional) | ~107,500 | ~81,000 | ~74,500 | CDC NCHS Provisional |
| 2024 (12-mo. ending Q2) | ~101,000 | ~74,000 | ~68,000 | CDC NCHS Provisional |

The modest decline observed in 2024 provisional data is cautiously encouraging but must be interpreted carefully. Provisional data is subject to revision, geographic variation is enormous, and previous apparent plateaus (2017-2019) were followed by sharp increases. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated deaths by approximately 30% between 2019 and 2021 through social isolation, disrupted treatment, and increased economic distress.

### Demographic Disparities

| Demographic Group | Overdose Death Rate per 100,000 (2022) | Change from 2019 | Source |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------|--------|
| Non-Hispanic White | 36.8 | +29% | CDC WONDER |
| Non-Hispanic Black | 44.2 | +89% | CDC WONDER |
| American Indian/Alaska Native | 56.6 | +67% | CDC WONDER |
| Hispanic/Latino | 25.4 | +63% | CDC WONDER |
| Asian/Pacific Islander | 5.8 | +75% | CDC WONDER |
| Males (all races) | 43.5 | +41% | CDC WONDER |
| Females (all races) | 19.2 | +40% | CDC WONDER |
| Ages 25-34 | 54.7 | +42% | CDC WONDER |
| Ages 35-44 | 55.3 | +58% | CDC WONDER |
| Ages 55-64 | 33.1 | +22% | CDC WONDER |

The most significant recent trend is the rapid increase in overdose deaths among Black Americans, whose death rate has nearly doubled since 2019 and now exceeds the rate for White Americans. This shift reflects the infiltration of fentanyl into cocaine and crack cocaine markets, which historically had lower overdose risk. Native American communities continue to have the highest per-capita overdose death rates of any demographic group.

### Geographic Variation

| State/Region | Overdose Death Rate per 100,000 (2022) | Primary Driver | Source |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|----------------|--------|
| West Virginia | 81.4 | Fentanyl, methamphetamine | CDC WONDER |
| Tennessee | 56.6 | Fentanyl | CDC WONDER |
| Louisiana | 55.9 | Fentanyl | CDC WONDER |
| Ohio | 47.2 | Fentanyl | CDC WONDER |
| Kentucky | 49.2 | Fentanyl | CDC WONDER |
| Delaware | 48.0 | Fentanyl | CDC WONDER |
| Pennsylvania | 44.5 | Fentanyl | CDC WONDER |
| National Average | 32.6 | Fentanyl | CDC WONDER |
| Nebraska | 11.4 | Mixed | CDC WONDER |
| South Dakota | 13.7 | Mixed | CDC WONDER |
| Iowa | 15.6 | Fentanyl rising | CDC WONDER |

West Virginia continues to lead the nation in per-capita overdose deaths by a wide margin. Appalachian states, the Ohio Valley, and the mid-Atlantic corridor remain the most heavily affected regions. However, fentanyl has now penetrated nearly every state's drug supply, and formerly lower-rate states in the South and West are seeing accelerating increases.

## The Fentanyl Supply

### Supply Chain Characteristics

Illicitly manufactured fentanyl has fundamentally transformed the illicit opioid market. Key characteristics of the current supply include:

- **Precursor sourcing**: Chemical precursors are primarily sourced from chemical manufacturers in China, shipped to Mexico either directly or through transshipment points, and synthesized into fentanyl by Mexican drug trafficking organizations (primarily the Sinaloa Cartel and Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generacion)
- **Production efficiency**: A kilogram of fentanyl can be synthesized from precursors costing approximately $1,000-$3,000, yielding product with a street value of $500,000-$1,000,000, creating enormous profit incentives
- **Distribution**: Fentanyl enters the U.S. primarily through legal ports of entry concealed in vehicles and commercial shipments, with smaller quantities shipped through mail and express consignment carriers
- **Potency variation**: Illicit fentanyl pills and powder exhibit extreme potency variation, with DEA laboratory analysis finding that approximately 7 out of every 10 pills seized contain a potentially lethal dose (more than 2 milligrams)
- **Analog proliferation**: Novel analogs such as para-fluorofentanyl, carfentanil, and nitazenes have been detected in drug supplies, complicating both interdiction and clinical response

### Seizure Data

| Metric | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 | Source |
|--------|------|------|------|------|--------|
| Fentanyl seized at border (lbs) | 4,776 | 11,201 | 14,700 | 26,700+ | CBP |
| Fentanyl pills seized (millions) | 4.5 | 9.5 | 50.6 | 79.4 | DEA |
| Fentanyl-related submissions to forensic labs | 68,000 | 93,000 | 112,000 | 128,000+ | DEA NFLIS |
| States where fentanyl is primary opioid threat | 32 | 38 | 44 | 48 | DEA |

The dramatic increase in seizures reflects both increased supply and increased enforcement effort. However, interdiction alone cannot meaningfully reduce availability: the potency-to-volume ratio of fentanyl means that even seizing the majority of shipments may not significantly reduce street-level supply.

## Treatment Landscape

### Treatment Gap

The treatment gap--the difference between the number of Americans with opioid use disorder and the number receiving evidence-based treatment--remains the most critical failure in the crisis response.

| Metric | Estimate | Source |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Americans with opioid use disorder (past year) | 5.6 million | SAMHSA NSDUH 2022 |
| Receiving any substance use treatment | 1.5 million | SAMHSA NSDUH 2022 |
| Receiving medication-assisted treatment (MAT) | ~1.2 million | SAMHSA, 2023 |
| MAT treatment rate (% of OUD population) | ~22% | Calculated |
| Buprenorphine patients | ~950,000 | SAMHSA, 2023 |
| Methadone patients | ~410,000 | SAMHSA, 2023 |
| Naltrexone patients (for OUD) | ~65,000 | SAMHSA, 2023 |
| Opioid treatment programs (OTPs) | ~1,900 | SAMHSA, 2023 |
| Buprenorphine prescribers (waivered) | ~130,000 | SAMHSA, 2023 |
| Counties with no buprenorphine prescriber | ~500 | SAMHSA locator data |
| Counties with no OTP | ~2,200 | SAMHSA locator data |

The elimination of the federal X-waiver requirement for buprenorphine prescribing in December 2022 (through the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023) was a significant step toward expanding access. Any DEA-registered practitioner with a Schedule III prescribing authority can now prescribe buprenorphine for OUD. However, this policy change alone has not yet produced the hoped-for surge in prescribers, as many providers lack training, confidence, institutional support, or willingness to treat OUD patients.

### Medications for Opioid Use Disorder

| Medication | Mechanism | Effectiveness | Access Model | Key Barriers |
|------------|-----------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| Methadone | Full opioid agonist | 60-90% reduction in illicit use; 50% reduction in mortality | Federally regulated OTPs only; daily observed dosing initially | Geographic access; daily clinic visits; stigma; regulatory burden |
| Buprenorphine (Suboxone) | Partial opioid agonist | 50-75% reduction in illicit use; 50% reduction in mortality | Office-based; pharmacy dispensing | Provider willingness; cost ($200-600/month without insurance); diversion concerns |
| Naltrexone (Vivitrol) | Opioid antagonist | 40-60% reduction in relapse (when adherent) | Office-based; monthly injection | Requires full detoxification first; lower initiation and retention rates; cost ($1,500/month) |

All three FDA-approved medications for OUD have strong evidence of effectiveness, but methadone and buprenorphine consistently demonstrate the largest mortality reductions. The evidence base strongly supports expanding access to these medications as the single highest-impact intervention available.

## Naloxone and Overdose Prevention

### Naloxone Access

Naloxone (brand name Narcan), an opioid antagonist that can reverse an overdose, has become increasingly accessible:

| Metric | Status | Source |
|--------|--------|--------|
| States with naloxone standing orders | 50 + DC | PDAPS, 2024 |
| States with Good Samaritan laws | 48 + DC | PDAPS, 2024 |
| Naloxone kits distributed by SAMHSA-funded programs (2022) | 3.2 million | SAMHSA, 2023 |
| FDA approval of OTC naloxone (Narcan nasal spray) | March 2023 | FDA |
| OTC Narcan retail price | ~$45 per 2-dose kit | RxSaver, 2024 |
| Overdose reversals reported by law enforcement (2022) | 53,000+ | ODMAP, 2023 |

The FDA's March 2023 approval of over-the-counter naloxone was a landmark step. However, the retail price of approximately $45 per kit remains a barrier for many, and distribution still relies heavily on public health programs and community organizations rather than the commercial market reaching the highest-risk populations.

---

## Prescribing Trends

### Prescription Opioid Landscape

Prescription opioid volume has declined substantially from its 2012 peak but remains significant:

| Metric | Peak (2012) | Current (2022) | Change | Source |
|--------|-------------|----------------|--------|--------|
| Total prescriptions dispensed | 255 million | 142 million | -44% | CDC |
| Prescribing rate per 100 persons | 81.3 | 43.3 | -47% | CDC |
| Average daily MME per prescription | 58 | 42 | -28% | CDC |
| High-dose prescriptions (>90 MME/day) | 11.5% | 5.2% | -55% | CDC |
| Prescriptions >7-day duration (initial) | 37% | 18% | -51% | CDC |

While reduced prescribing has slowed the creation of new cases of prescription opioid dependence, it has not reduced overall overdose deaths because users who lose prescription access frequently transition to illicit markets. This transition effect--well documented in research--underscores that supply-side measures must be paired with treatment expansion.

## Regulatory and Legal Framework

### Current Federal Regulatory Structure

| Agency | Role | Key Authority |
|--------|------|---------------|
| DEA | Scheduling, quota management, enforcement | Controlled Substances Act |
| FDA | Drug approval, labeling, post-market surveillance | Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act |
| SAMHSA | Treatment funding, OTP regulation, data systems | 42 U.S.C. 290aa et seq. |
| CDC | Surveillance, prescribing guidelines, prevention | Public Health Service Act |
| ONDCP | Policy coordination, National Drug Control Strategy | ONDCP Reauthorization Act |
| CMS | Medicare/Medicaid coverage, reimbursement | Social Security Act |
| NIDA | Research funding, evidence development | Public Health Service Act |
| CBP/DHS | Border interdiction, precursor control | Multiple statutes |

### Key Federal Legislation

| Law | Year | Key Provisions |
|-----|------|----------------|
| Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) | 2016 | Expanded naloxone access, authorized nurse practitioners to prescribe buprenorphine |
| 21st Century Cures Act | 2016 | $1 billion in state opioid grants over two years |
| SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act | 2018 | Expanded Medicaid MAT coverage, reformed Medicare opioid prescribing, increased penalties for illicit fentanyl |
| Consolidated Appropriations Act (X-waiver elimination) | 2023 | Removed X-waiver requirement for buprenorphine prescribing |
| Mainstreaming Addiction Treatment (MAT) Act | 2023 | Codified X-waiver elimination, added training requirements |
| Bipartisan Safer Communities Act | 2022 | Included provisions for mental health and substance use disorder services |

### Opioid Litigation Status

The opioid litigation represents the largest and most complex mass tort in American history, exceeding the tobacco litigation in scope:

| Defendant Category | Settlement Amount | Status | Source |
|--------------------|-------------------|--------|--------|
| Purdue Pharma / Sackler family | $6 billion (bankruptcy) | Final; distributions beginning | DOJ, 2024 |
| Johnson & Johnson | $5 billion | Settled; 46 states participating | State AG offices |
| Three major distributors (McKesson, Cardinal, AmerisourceBergen) | $21 billion | Settled; distributions underway | Settlement administrator |
| Walgreens | $5.7 billion | Settled; distributions beginning | Settlement administrator |
| CVS Health | $5 billion | Settled; distributions beginning | Settlement administrator |
| Walmart | $3.1 billion | Settled | Settlement administrator |
| Teva Pharmaceutical | $4.25 billion | Settled; distributions beginning | Settlement administrator |
| Allergan | $2.37 billion | Settled | Settlement administrator |
| Endo International | $450 million (bankruptcy) | Final | Bankruptcy court |
| Mallinckrodt | $1.7 billion (bankruptcy) | Final | Bankruptcy court |
| **Total major settlements** | **>$50 billion** | **Ongoing** | **Various** |

The critical question now is whether these funds will be directed to evidence-based treatment, prevention, and harm reduction, or whether they will be diverted to general government revenues as occurred with most tobacco settlement funds. Most state settlement agreements include provisions directing 70-85% of funds to opioid-related purposes, but enforcement and oversight mechanisms vary widely.

## Federal Funding

| Funding Stream | FY2023 Appropriation | Purpose | Source |
|----------------|---------------------|---------|--------|
| SAMHSA State Opioid Response (SOR) Grants | $1.5 billion | Treatment, recovery, prevention | SAMHSA |
| SAMHSA State Targeted Response (STR) Grants | Legacy; absorbed into SOR | Treatment, MAT expansion | SAMHSA |
| CDC Overdose Prevention | $483 million | Surveillance, prescribing safety, prevention | CDC |
| HRSA Rural Opioid Programs | $165 million | Rural treatment access | HRSA |
| NIDA Research | $1.6 billion (total institute) | Addiction science research | NIDA |
| DEA Diversion Control | $492 million | Scheduling, enforcement, regulation | DEA |
| DOJ/COPS Community Policing - Opioids | $47 million | Deflection, diversion programs | DOJ |
| VA Opioid Safety Initiative | ~$270 million | Veteran treatment, alternatives to opioids | VA |

Total federal spending specifically directed to opioid response exceeds $4 billion annually, a significant increase from pre-crisis levels but still insufficient relative to the estimated $1 trillion annual economic burden. The time-limited nature of most grant funding (typically 2-3 year cycles) creates instability in treatment and prevention programs.

## Emerging Challenges

### Xylazine ("Tranq")

Xylazine, a veterinary sedative not approved for human use, has been increasingly detected in the illicit fentanyl supply, particularly in the eastern United States. Xylazine complicates overdose response because it does not respond to naloxone, causes severe skin wounds at injection sites, and produces prolonged sedation. The DEA designated the fentanyl-xylazine combination as an "emerging threat" in 2023, and the White House released a National Response Plan for fentanyl combined with xylazine in July 2023.

### Nitazenes

A class of synthetic opioids called nitazenes--some of which are significantly more potent than fentanyl--has been detected in drug supplies in several states. While not yet widespread, nitazenes represent the potential next escalation in the synthetic opioid crisis.

### Polysubstance Use

An increasing proportion of overdose deaths involve multiple substances, particularly the combination of opioids with stimulants (methamphetamine or cocaine) or benzodiazepines. Polysubstance use complicates both treatment and overdose response and reflects broader patterns of drug market contamination.

### Youth and Counterfeit Pills

Counterfeit prescription pills manufactured with fentanyl and sold through social media have led to rising overdose deaths among adolescents and young adults who may not have recognized they were consuming opioids. The DEA's "One Pill Can Kill" campaign highlights this emerging risk vector.
