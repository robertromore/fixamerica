# Cannabis Legalization: Stakeholders

## Overview

Cannabis legalization involves a broad and diverse set of stakeholders with varying degrees of power, interest, and influence. These range from the millions of Americans directly affected by prohibition to the federal agencies that enforce it, from the emerging legal industry to the established industries that view cannabis as either a threat or an opportunity. Understanding these stakeholders -- their interests, resources, and political strategies -- is essential to designing reform that can build effective coalitions and navigate opposition.

## Primary Stakeholders

### Cannabis Businesses and Industry

**Multi-State Operators (MSOs)**

- **Who**: Large, publicly traded or venture-backed companies operating cultivation, processing, and retail operations across multiple states. Major MSOs include Curaleaf (revenue: $1.35 billion, 2023), Trulieve ($1.13 billion), Green Thumb Industries ($1.05 billion), and Columbia Care/Cresco Labs ($780 million).
- **Interest**: Federal legalization or descheduling to access banking, capital markets, and interstate commerce; elimination of Section 280E tax penalties; expansion of legal markets to new states; protection of market position through limited licensing and high regulatory barriers.
- **Resources**: Significant lobbying budgets (the top 10 MSOs spent an estimated $15 million on lobbying in 2023), political donations, and institutional relationships. Many employ former government officials and regulators.
- **Political strategy**: Support SAFE Banking as an immediate priority; generally support descheduling with regulatory framework; lobby for licensing structures that favor established operators.
- **Tensions**: MSOs are frequently criticized by social equity advocates and small operators for lobbying in favor of limited licensing, high capital requirements, and regulatory structures that entrench their market dominance.

**Small and Independent Operators**

- **Who**: Single-location dispensaries, small cultivators, craft processors, and social equity licensees. These businesses constitute the majority of cannabis licenses but a minority of industry revenue.
- **Interest**: Access to banking and capital; reduction of regulatory compliance costs; opposition to vertical integration mandates and limited licensing; support for social equity programs.
- **Resources**: Limited compared to MSOs; organized through trade associations such as the National Cannabis Roundtable and state-level organizations.
- **Challenges**: High compliance costs, limited access to capital, competition from MSOs and the illicit market, and the 280E tax burden (which falls disproportionately on smaller operations with lower margins).

**Industry Trade Associations**

| Organization | Focus | Key Positions |
|-------------|-------|---------------|
| National Cannabis Industry Association (NCIA) | Broad industry | Federal descheduling, SAFE Banking, business normalization |
| Cannabis Trade Federation (CTF) | Federal policy | Federal regulation, interstate commerce framework |
| National Cannabis Roundtable (NCR) | Bipartisan policy | Incremental reform, coalition-building |
| US Cannabis Council | Major operators | Federal legalization, capital market access |

### Cannabis Consumers

- **Who**: An estimated 52 million Americans used cannabis in the past year (2022), including approximately 36 million who used in the past month.
- **Interest**: Legal access, affordable pricing, product safety, variety and potency, privacy, and freedom from criminal penalties.
- **Demographics**: Cannabis use spans all demographic groups but is highest among adults 18-34 (35.4% past-year use), males (25% vs. 19% females), and individuals in states with legal access.
- **Political influence**: Consumers are a large but diffuse constituency. Cannabis legalization ballot initiatives have consistently passed with 55-70% support, but cannabis is rarely cited as a top voting issue.
- **Medical patients**: An estimated 3.6 million Americans are registered medical cannabis patients as of 2023. These patients have more concentrated political interests and advocacy organizations (e.g., Americans for Safe Access).

### Communities Impacted by Prohibition

- **Who**: Predominantly Black and Latino communities that experienced the highest rates of cannabis enforcement, arrest, incarceration, and collateral consequences. Also includes rural communities where cannabis cultivation was a significant part of the informal economy.
- **Interest**: Expungement and record clearing; social equity licensing; community reinvestment of cannabis tax revenue; removal of collateral consequences (employment barriers, housing restrictions, immigration consequences); meaningful ownership participation in the legal industry.
- **Resources**: Limited institutional resources; organized through civil rights organizations (NAACP, ACLU, National Urban League), criminal justice reform organizations (Drug Policy Alliance, Last Prisoner Project), and community-based organizations.
- **Challenges**: Social equity programs have largely failed to deliver on promises of meaningful community benefit, leading to frustration and skepticism about the sincerity of equity commitments.

### Law Enforcement

**Federal Law Enforcement**

- **Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)**: The DEA is the primary federal agency responsible for enforcing the Controlled Substances Act. The DEA has institutional interests in maintaining cannabis as a controlled substance, as cannabis enforcement has historically been a significant portion of its activity and budget justification.
    - The DEA employs approximately 10,000 personnel with a budget of $3.2 billion (FY2024).
    - Cannabis-related enforcement has declined as a share of DEA activity but remains significant.
    - The DEA has authority over scheduling decisions and has historically resisted rescheduling petitions.
- **Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)**: The FBI tracks cannabis arrests through the Uniform Crime Reporting system and has jurisdiction over large-scale trafficking and money laundering cases.

**State and Local Law Enforcement**

- **Interest**: Mixed. Some agencies oppose legalization due to concerns about impaired driving, youth access, and increased workload (e.g., enforcement against illicit market). Others support it due to the reduction in low-level arrests and ability to redirect resources.
- **Fraternal Order of Police (FOP)**: The largest police union, representing over 350,000 members, has historically opposed legalization but has shown increasing openness to banking reform and rescheduling.
- **Major Cities Chiefs Association (MCCA)**: Has not taken a formal position on legalization but has supported banking reform for public safety reasons (reducing cash operations).
- **Law Enforcement Action Partnership (LEAP)**: An organization of current and former law enforcement professionals that supports drug policy reform including cannabis legalization.

## Secondary Stakeholders

### Banking and Financial Services Industry

- **Who**: Banks, credit unions, payment processors, insurance companies, and capital markets participants.
- **Interest**: Regulatory clarity to serve cannabis businesses without fear of federal prosecution or regulatory sanction. The cannabis banking market represents an estimated $2-4 billion in annual revenue opportunity for financial institutions.
- **Key organizations**:
    - **American Bankers Association (ABA)**: Supports SAFE Banking Act.
    - **Credit Union National Association (CUNA)**: Supports SAFE Banking Act.
    - **Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA)**: Supports SAFE Banking Act.
- **Position**: Virtually unanimous support for SAFE Banking or equivalent legislative safe harbor. Financial industry lobbying has been a significant driver of bipartisan support for banking reform.
- **Constraints**: Even with SAFE Banking, large banks may be slow to enter cannabis banking due to remaining federal illegality, reputational risk, and the complexity of compliance programs.

### State Governments

- **Governors and legislatures**: States have been the primary drivers of cannabis policy reform. Governors in both parties have signed legalization bills (e.g., Republican Phil Scott of Vermont signed the 2018 legalization bill; Democratic J.B. Pritzker of Illinois signed the 2019 Cannabis Regulation and Tax Act).
- **Interest**: Tax revenue (over $15 billion cumulative through 2023), regulatory control, public health and safety, and responding to voter preferences.
- **State tax agencies**: Responsible for collecting cannabis taxes and managing the significant administrative complexity of the industry.
- **State regulatory agencies**: Implement and enforce cannabis regulations, including licensing, testing, tracking, and compliance. These agencies vary widely in structure and resources.

### Federal Agencies

| Agency | Role | Position |
|--------|------|----------|
| **DEA** | Scheduling authority, enforcement | Historically resistant to reform; implementing proposed rescheduling |
| **FDA** | Drug safety, medical approval | Completed scientific review recommending Schedule III; cautious on unregulated market |
| **HHS** | Public health oversight | Recommended Schedule III reclassification (2023) |
| **DOJ** | Prosecution policy | Varies by administration; current practice is non-enforcement in legal states |
| **Treasury/FinCEN** | Financial regulation | Issued 2014 guidance enabling limited banking; supports legislative clarity |
| **IRS** | Tax enforcement | Enforces 280E; collects significant revenue from cannabis businesses |
| **USDA** | Agriculture regulation | Regulates hemp under 2018 Farm Bill; potential role in cannabis agriculture |
| **VA** | Veteran healthcare | Prohibits VA physicians from recommending cannabis despite state legality |
| **USCIS/CBP** | Immigration | Treats cannabis involvement as grounds for inadmissibility or deportation |

### Advocacy Organizations

**Pro-Reform**

| Organization | Founded | Focus | Approach |
|-------------|---------|-------|----------|
| NORML | 1970 | Cannabis legalization | Grassroots advocacy, legal support |
| Marijuana Policy Project (MPP) | 1995 | State and federal legalization | Ballot initiatives, legislative lobbying |
| Drug Policy Alliance (DPA) | 2000 | Broad drug policy reform | Policy research, social equity |
| Last Prisoner Project | 2019 | Cannabis prisoner release, expungement | Clemency advocacy, legal services |
| Americans for Safe Access (ASA) | 2002 | Medical cannabis access | Patient advocacy, legal challenges |
| Parabola Center | 2022 | Cannabis criminal justice | Data-driven advocacy, legal services |

**Opposition Organizations** (detailed further in [06-opposition.md](06-opposition.md))

| Organization | Focus | Position |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| Smart Approaches to Marijuana (SAM) | Anti-commercialization | Opposes legalization; supports decriminalization |
| Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America (CADCA) | Prevention | Opposes legalization |
| National Sheriffs' Association | Law enforcement | Generally opposes legalization |

### Alcohol and Tobacco Industries

- **Alcohol industry**: Increasingly invested in cannabis. Constellation Brands invested $4 billion in Canopy Growth (Canada) in 2018. Molson Coors launched a cannabis beverage joint venture. The industry's position is shifting from opposition to seeking integration.
- **Tobacco industry**: Altria invested $1.8 billion in Cronos Group (cannabis company) in 2018. Philip Morris International has explored cannabis and hemp products. The tobacco industry views cannabis as a potential diversification opportunity.
- **Wine and spirits distributors**: Some state-level opposition to cannabis legalization or support for three-tier distribution models that would give existing distributors control over cannabis distribution.

### Pharmaceutical Industry

- **Interest**: Complex. Pharmaceutical companies have invested in FDA-approved cannabis-derived drugs (e.g., GW Pharmaceuticals/Jazz Pharmaceuticals' Epidiolex for epilepsy, $683 million in 2023 sales) but face competitive threats from unregulated cannabis products.
- **Position**: Generally support maintaining cannabis as a controlled substance with pharmaceutical development pathways; oppose unregulated commercial markets.
- **Lobbying**: The pharmaceutical industry has been accused of lobbying against legalization to protect markets for opioids, sleep aids, anti-anxiety medications, and other drugs that cannabis may substitute for. A 2019 study found that medical cannabis legalization was associated with a 6.6% reduction in opioid prescriptions.

### Agricultural Community

- **Hemp farmers**: The 2018 Farm Bill legalized hemp (cannabis with <0.3% THC), creating a new agricultural sector. However, the hemp market experienced a boom-bust cycle, with oversupply and low prices devastating early entrants.
- **Cannabis cultivators**: Outdoor and indoor cannabis farmers, including many in California's Emerald Triangle (Humboldt, Mendocino, Trinity counties), who have cultivated cannabis for generations. Many of these legacy operators have struggled to transition to the legal market due to licensing costs, regulatory complexity, and federal prohibition.
- **Farm organizations**: The American Farm Bureau Federation has supported hemp policy clarification but has not taken a strong position on cannabis legalization.

### Labor Organizations

- **United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW)**: The primary union organizing cannabis workers, with over 10,000 cannabis workers organized as of 2023. UFCW supports legalization and labor protections for cannabis workers.
- **Interest**: Worker safety, fair wages, benefits, right to organize. Cannabis workers often face low wages, hazardous working conditions (especially in cultivation), and limited labor protections.

### Academic and Research Community

- **Interest**: Removal of Schedule I research barriers; access to diverse cannabis samples for study; funding for public health research on cannabis effects, dosing, impaired driving, and medical applications.
- **Challenges**: The Schedule I classification has severely constrained cannabis research. Until 2021, all federally authorized research cannabis came from a single source (University of Mississippi), which produced material widely criticized as unrepresentative of commercial products.
- **Key institutions**: University of Mississippi (NIDA contract), University of California Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research, Colorado School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University.
