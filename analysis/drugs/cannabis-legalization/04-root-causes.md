# Cannabis Legalization: Root Causes

## Introduction

The problems surrounding cannabis policy in the United States -- the persistence of federal prohibition, the patchwork of state regulations, racial disparities in enforcement, the banking crisis, the thriving illicit market, and the failure of social equity programs -- are not accidental. They are the product of identifiable systemic causes rooted in history, institutional design, political incentives, and economic structures. Understanding these root causes is essential to designing effective reforms.

## Root Cause 1: Racial Origins of Cannabis Prohibition

### The Problem

Cannabis prohibition was not established on the basis of scientific evidence or public health analysis. It was constructed on a foundation of racial prejudice, primarily targeting Mexican immigrants and Black Americans.

### Mechanism

- **Anti-Mexican sentiment (1910s-1930s)**: The earliest state-level cannabis bans were explicitly linked to fears about Mexican immigrants. The term "marijuana" was deliberately adopted to emphasize the substance's foreign and Mexican association, replacing the familiar medical term "cannabis."
- **Anti-Black racism (1930s-1970s)**: Harry Anslinger's Federal Bureau of Narcotics promoted cannabis prohibition through racist narratives linking the drug to Black Americans and other minorities. The Controlled Substances Act's Schedule I placement of cannabis was, by the admission of Nixon administration officials, politically motivated to disrupt Black communities and the anti-war movement.
- **Structural persistence**: Although the explicitly racist rhetoric has faded from official discourse, the structures built on that foundation persist. Enforcement patterns continue to disproportionately target Black and Latino communities, even in states that have reformed possession penalties.

### Evidence

- Black Americans are arrested for cannabis at 3.73 times the rate of white Americans nationally, despite comparable usage rates (ACLU, 2020).
- In 31 states, the Black-white arrest disparity actually *increased* between 2010 and 2018, even as overall arrest numbers declined (ACLU, 2020).
- John Ehrlichman's 1994 admission (published 2016) that the Nixon drug war was designed to target Black Americans and the anti-war left.
- The American Medical Association actively opposed the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 on the grounds that there was no scientific evidence supporting prohibition.

## Root Cause 2: Schedule I Classification Without Scientific Basis

### The Problem

Cannabis has been classified as Schedule I -- defined as having "no currently accepted medical use" and "a high potential for abuse" -- since 1970, despite overwhelming scientific evidence contradicting both criteria.

### Mechanism

- **Political placement**: Cannabis was placed in Schedule I as a temporary measure by the Nixon administration, pending the Shafer Commission report. When the commission recommended decriminalization, Nixon rejected the finding and the "temporary" classification became permanent.
- **Self-reinforcing restriction**: Schedule I classification makes research on cannabis extremely difficult. Researchers must obtain a DEA Schedule I research license, use cannabis supplied exclusively by the University of Mississippi (the sole federally authorized grower until 2021), and navigate extensive regulatory requirements. This scarcity of research has been used to justify maintaining the classification by arguing there is "insufficient evidence" of medical benefit -- a circular logic.
- **FDA standards**: The FDA has traditionally required large-scale, controlled clinical trials for drug approval. The Schedule I research restrictions make conducting such trials extraordinarily difficult, creating a catch-22: cannabis cannot be rescheduled because there is insufficient research, and there is insufficient research because it is Schedule I.
- **Institutional inertia**: The DEA, which has authority over scheduling decisions, has repeatedly denied rescheduling petitions (1972, 1995, 2001, 2011, 2016). Even when DEA Administrative Law Judge Francis Young ruled in 1988 that cannabis was "one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man" and should be rescheduled, DEA Administrator John Lawn overruled him.

### Evidence

- The FDA itself, in its 2023 scientific review, concluded that cannabis has "currently accepted medical use" -- the first official federal acknowledgment contradicting the Schedule I classification.
- 38 states have legalized medical cannabis, representing a de facto consensus among state-level medical and regulatory authorities.
- The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2017) found "conclusive or substantial evidence" that cannabis is effective for chronic pain, chemotherapy-induced nausea, and multiple sclerosis spasticity.
- Cannabis is classified less restrictively than Schedule I in virtually every other developed nation.

## Root Cause 3: Federal-State Structural Conflict

### The Problem

The coexistence of state legalization and federal prohibition creates a legal and practical crisis that undermines the rule of law, distorts markets, and prevents rational regulation.

### Mechanism

- **Supremacy Clause**: Under Article VI of the Constitution, federal law is "the supreme law of the land." Technically, state legalization does not override federal prohibition -- it merely means the state itself will not enforce cannabis laws, while federal enforcement remains legally possible.
- **Prosecutorial discretion**: The federal government has chosen not to enforce cannabis prohibition in legal states through a series of executive policy decisions (Cole Memorandum, subsequent practice). This discretion is revocable at any time by a new administration.
- **No safe harbor**: There is no federal statute or regulation that provides legal protection to state-legal cannabis businesses. Every cannabis business in the United States technically violates federal law, regardless of state compliance.
- **Downstream effects**: The federal-state conflict produces cascading problems in banking (BSA/AML compliance), taxation (Section 280E), employment law (federal contractors, employees subject to federal drug testing), immigration (non-citizens can be denied entry or deported for cannabis involvement), intellectual property (trademark registration challenges), and bankruptcy (federal courts will not protect cannabis businesses).

### Evidence

- Cannabis businesses cannot access standard banking services because banks fear federal prosecution under the Bank Secrecy Act.
- Cannabis businesses pay effective federal tax rates of 40-70% under Section 280E, compared to 21% for other industries.
- Non-citizens have been denied entry to the United States or had immigration applications denied for admitting past cannabis use, even in states where it is legal.
- Cannabis companies cannot file for bankruptcy protection in federal courts.
- Cannabis cannot be transported across state lines, even between two legal states, because crossing a state line triggers federal jurisdiction.

## Root Cause 4: Banking Exclusion and Financial Marginalization

### The Problem

The federal illegality of cannabis creates a financial crisis for the legal industry, forcing businesses into cash-intensive operations, denying them basic financial services, and creating public safety hazards.

### Mechanism

- **Bank Secrecy Act conflict**: The Bank Secrecy Act (31 U.S.C. 5311 et seq.) requires financial institutions to file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) for transactions involving proceeds of illegal activity. Cannabis transactions meet this definition under federal law, even when state-legal.
- **Regulatory risk**: Federal bank regulators (OCC, FDIC, NCUA) have not explicitly prohibited cannabis banking, but neither have they provided a safe harbor. Banks that serve cannabis businesses face heightened examination scrutiny and potential enforcement action.
- **Risk-averse institutions**: Major banks, which have compliance obligations spanning dozens of federal and state regulators, have determined that the regulatory risk of serving cannabis businesses outweighs the revenue opportunity.
- **Cash economy consequences**: Cannabis businesses forced to operate in cash face heightened risks of robbery, employee theft, and tax compliance difficulties. The IRS must physically count cash for audits of cannabis businesses. Armored car services charge premium rates or refuse service entirely.
- **Capital access**: Cannabis businesses cannot access SBA loans, traditional bank lines of credit, or standard capital markets. They rely on private equity, specialized cannabis lending firms, and Canadian stock exchanges (CSE, TSX Venture) for capital formation.

### Evidence

- Only approximately 812 banks and credit unions (out of ~9,000 nationally) reported serving cannabis businesses as of mid-2024.
- Major national banks (JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citibank) do not serve cannabis businesses.
- Cannabis businesses report paying banking fees 5-10 times higher than comparable non-cannabis businesses.
- The IRS estimates $10 billion in annual cannabis transactions are cash-based.
- The SAFE Banking Act has passed the U.S. House seven times with bipartisan support but has been blocked in the Senate each time.

## Root Cause 5: Social Equity Gaps and Captured Legalization

### The Problem

Despite widespread recognition that cannabis prohibition disproportionately harmed Black and Latino communities, the legal cannabis industry is overwhelmingly white-owned and well-capitalized, while communities harmed by prohibition have seen limited benefits.

### Mechanism

- **Capital requirements**: Cannabis licensing typically requires significant capital investment ($250,000 to $1 million or more for a dispensary license, depending on the state). Individuals from communities harmed by prohibition -- who by definition have faced economic disadvantage exacerbated by criminal records, asset forfeiture, and employment discrimination -- are least likely to have access to this capital.
- **Criminal record barriers**: Many states impose background check requirements for cannabis licensing that disqualify individuals with prior cannabis convictions -- the very people who bore the brunt of prohibition enforcement.
- **Regulatory complexity**: Cannabis regulatory compliance requires sophisticated legal, accounting, and consulting support that smaller operators and equity applicants often cannot afford.
- **First-mover advantage**: In most states, existing medical cannabis operators had a significant head start in obtaining recreational licenses, and these operators were predominantly white-owned and well-capitalized.
- **Lobbying dynamics**: Large multi-state operators lobby for high barriers to entry (limited licenses, high capital requirements, extensive compliance mandates) that protect their market position while making entry difficult for small businesses and equity applicants.
- **Implementation failures**: Even well-designed equity programs (e.g., New York, Illinois) have been plagued by lawsuits, regulatory delays, and insufficient funding, allowing incumbents and well-resourced applicants to dominate.

### Evidence

- A 2021 survey by Leafly found that approximately 81% of cannabis business owners are white, while Black Americans represent only 4.3% of owners, despite being disproportionately affected by prohibition.
- In Illinois, social equity dispensary licenses were not awarded until 2022, three years after legalization, due to litigation and regulatory delays.
- New York's cannabis program awarded only 103 of 463 planned equity licenses in its first two years, while an estimated 1,500 unlicensed shops operated in New York City alone.
- California's local equity programs closed or were unfunded in many jurisdictions within two years.

## Root Cause 6: Illicit Market Persistence and Regulatory Design Failures

### The Problem

The illicit cannabis market remains larger than the legal market nationally, undermining public health goals, tax revenue, and the economic viability of legal operators.

### Mechanism

- **Over-taxation**: When combined state and local taxes exceed 25-30%, legal cannabis becomes significantly more expensive than illicit product, which bears no tax burden. California's effective tax rates exceeding 40% in some jurisdictions have been widely cited as a primary driver of illicit market persistence.
- **Under-licensing**: States that limit the number of licenses (e.g., New York, New Jersey, Connecticut) create artificial supply shortages that allow illicit operators to meet unserved demand.
- **Regulatory burden**: Extensive testing, packaging, labeling, tracking (seed-to-sale), and security requirements impose costs that legal operators pass to consumers, further widening the price gap with illicit products.
- **Enforcement gaps**: Many states have not adequately resourced enforcement against illicit operators, particularly unlicensed dispensaries operating openly in cities like New York, Los Angeles, and Portland.
- **Interstate diversion**: States with oversupply (Oregon, Oklahoma) see significant diversion of cannabis to the illicit market in other states, undermining both source and destination state regulatory frameworks.
- **Consumer inertia**: Many consumers, particularly in newly legal markets, continue purchasing from established illicit sources due to convenience, price, product familiarity, or lack of nearby legal dispensaries.

### Evidence

- The illicit cannabis market was estimated at $60-70 billion in 2023, compared to $33.6 billion in legal sales.
- California's illicit market is estimated to be 2-3 times the size of its legal market, despite being legal since 2016.
- Oregon experienced a massive oversupply crisis, with wholesale prices dropping below $50/pound (legal) and significant diversion to out-of-state illicit markets.
- New York City had an estimated 1,500 unlicensed cannabis shops in 2023, compared to approximately 100 licensed dispensaries.

## Root Cause 7: Political Incentive Misalignment

### The Problem

Despite supermajority public support for legalization (70% nationally per Gallup, 2023), federal cannabis reform remains stalled due to political dynamics that reward inaction.

### Mechanism

- **Senate structural bias**: The U.S. Senate's structure gives disproportionate representation to small, rural, and more conservative states where legalization is less popular.
- **Filibuster**: Cannabis reform bills cannot pass the Senate with a simple majority under current filibuster rules, requiring 60 votes.
- **Committee gatekeeping**: Senate committee chairs can prevent bills from receiving hearings or floor votes.
- **Issue bundling**: Some progressive senators have blocked narrower reforms (e.g., SAFE Banking) by insisting that any cannabis legislation must include comprehensive descheduling and social equity provisions, creating a dynamic where the perfect becomes the enemy of the good.
- **Industry lobbying fragmentation**: The cannabis industry's lobbying power is fragmented, with cannabis companies, existing alcohol/tobacco industries, pharmaceutical companies, and private prison interests all pulling in different directions.
- **Electoral calculation**: Most elected officials perceive little electoral benefit from championing cannabis reform (voters rarely rank it as a top priority) but significant risk from opposition attack ads.

### Evidence

- 70% of Americans support legalization (Gallup, 2023), yet federal legalization has not passed either chamber.
- The SAFE Banking Act passed the House seven times with bipartisan support but was blocked in the Senate each time.
- No comprehensive cannabis reform bill has received a Senate floor vote.
- Cannabis legalization has won every competitive ballot initiative since 2012 (where it was on the ballot), yet Congress has not acted.

## Root Cause 8: International Treaty Constraints

### The Problem

The United States is a signatory to international drug control treaties that technically prohibit the legalization of cannabis for non-medical and non-scientific purposes.

### Mechanism

- **1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs**: Requires parties to limit cannabis use "exclusively to medical and scientific purposes" and to criminalize production and distribution for other purposes.
- **1988 Convention Against Illicit Traffic**: Requires parties to criminalize cultivation, production, and possession of narcotic drugs for personal consumption.
- **U.S. leadership role**: The United States was instrumental in creating the international drug control regime and has historically pressured other countries to maintain strict prohibition. This creates diplomatic complications as the U.S. itself moves toward legalization.
- **Treaty withdrawal or modification**: The U.S. could withdraw from or seek modification of these treaties, but this would require significant diplomatic effort and could undermine other aspects of the international drug control framework.

### Evidence

- The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) has publicly criticized both Uruguay's and Canada's legalization as violations of international treaty obligations.
- The UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs voted only narrowly (27-25) in 2020 to remove cannabis from Schedule IV, the most restrictive UN category.
- Bolivia withdrew from and re-acceded to the Single Convention with a reservation to permit traditional coca leaf chewing, demonstrating a possible diplomatic pathway.

## Systemic Interaction

These root causes do not operate in isolation. They form an interconnected system:

1. **Racial origins** (Root Cause 1) established the political and cultural foundation for **Schedule I classification** (Root Cause 2).
2. **Schedule I classification** creates the **federal-state conflict** (Root Cause 3), which produces the **banking crisis** (Root Cause 4).
3. The **banking crisis** and high barriers to entry reproduce **social equity failures** (Root Cause 5), as communities harmed by prohibition cannot access capital.
4. **Over-taxation and under-licensing** (Root Cause 6) sustain the illicit market, which undermines public support for legalization and provides ammunition to opponents.
5. **Political incentive misalignment** (Root Cause 7) prevents Congress from addressing any of the above, despite supermajority public support.
6. **International treaty constraints** (Root Cause 8) provide a convenient justification for inaction, even though the treaties are increasingly violated by U.S. practice and international trends.

Breaking this cycle requires action at the federal level -- specifically, descheduling or rescheduling cannabis and passing banking reform -- which then enables progress on every other dimension.
