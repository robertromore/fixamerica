# Cannabis Legalization: History

## Pre-Prohibition Era (Pre-1900)

Cannabis has been cultivated by humans for thousands of years, used for fiber (hemp), food, medicine, and psychoactive purposes. In the American context:

- **Colonial era**: Hemp cultivation was actively encouraged and in some colonies legally required. Virginia, Massachusetts, and Connecticut had laws compelling farmers to grow hemp for rope, sailcloth, and textiles. George Washington and Thomas Jefferson both cultivated hemp on their plantations.
- **19th century medicine**: Cannabis was widely available in American pharmacies as a patent medicine and tincture. The U.S. Pharmacopeia listed cannabis as a recognized medicine from 1851 to 1942, recommended for neuralgia, tetanus, typhus, cholera, rabies, dysentery, alcoholism, and other conditions.
- **No regulation**: Through the end of the 19th century, cannabis was not subject to any specific legal restriction at the federal or state level. Its medical use was routine and its recreational use was uncommon but not criminalized.

## The Origins of Prohibition (1900-1937)

### State-Level Criminalization

The first wave of cannabis regulation in the United States occurred at the state level in the early 20th century, driven primarily by racial and ethnic prejudice rather than public health concerns.

- **1911-1913**: Massachusetts (1911), California (1913), and several other states passed laws restricting or criminalizing cannabis. These early laws were frequently associated with anti-Mexican immigrant sentiment in the Southwest, where cannabis use was associated with Mexican laborers and migrant communities.
- **1910-1920**: The Mexican Revolution (1910-1920) drove significant immigration to the American Southwest, and cannabis use became associated in the public mind with Mexican immigrants. The Spanish-language spelling "marihuana" (or "marijuana") was deliberately used instead of the familiar English term "cannabis" to emphasize its foreign association.
- **El Paso, 1915**: El Paso, Texas, banned cannabis in 1915, one of the earliest municipal prohibitions, explicitly linked to anti-Mexican sentiment.
- **By 1931**: Twenty-nine states had criminalized cannabis, with legislative debates frequently featuring racist stereotypes about Mexican and Black Americans.

### Harry Anslinger and the Federal Bureau of Narcotics

The single most influential figure in the creation of federal cannabis prohibition was Harry J. Anslinger, the first commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN), who served from 1930 to 1962.

Anslinger promoted cannabis prohibition through a sustained campaign of racial fear-mongering and sensationalized claims:

- He testified to Congress that "most [marijuana users] are Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos, and entertainers" and that marijuana caused "white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes."
- He promoted the narrative of "reefer madness" -- that cannabis caused insanity, violence, and moral degradation.
- He built alliances with William Randolph Hearst, whose newspaper empire published lurid stories about marijuana-fueled crimes, and with DuPont, which had commercial interests in synthetic fibers that competed with hemp.
- The American Medical Association opposed the Marihuana Tax Act, with its legislative counsel Dr. William C. Woodward testifying that "the AMA knows of no evidence that marijuana is a dangerous drug" and protesting that the bill had been drafted using the unfamiliar term "marihuana" to prevent medical professionals from recognizing it as cannabis.

### The Marihuana Tax Act of 1937

The Marihuana Tax Act, signed into law on August 2, 1937, did not technically criminalize cannabis but imposed a prohibitively complex and expensive tax and registration system that made legal possession or transfer virtually impossible for anyone not registered with the government. Key provisions:

- Required a transfer tax stamp for any cannabis transaction
- Imposed a $1/ounce tax for registered handlers and $100/ounce for unregistered handlers (equivalent to approximately $2,100/ounce in 2024 dollars)
- Failure to pay the tax or possess the stamp was a criminal offense
- The effect was de facto prohibition

The Act was passed after minimal congressional debate. Few legislators understood that "marihuana" was the same plant as the well-known medicine cannabis.

## Counterculture and Backlash (1960s-1970s)

### The 1960s

Cannabis use surged among white middle-class Americans, particularly college students and the counterculture movement of the 1960s:

- **Usage rates**: An estimated 5% of American adults had tried cannabis in 1965; by 1972, that figure exceeded 20%.
- **Cultural shift**: Cannabis became associated with the anti-Vietnam War movement, civil rights activism, and the broader counterculture. This association intensified political opposition from conservative leaders who viewed cannabis as a symbol of social disorder.
- **NORML founded (1970)**: The National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws was founded by attorney Keith Stroup, becoming the first major national cannabis advocacy organization.

### The Controlled Substances Act of 1970

The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, which included the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), replaced the Marihuana Tax Act with a new federal drug classification system. The CSA placed cannabis in Schedule I -- the most restrictive category -- despite a lack of scientific evidence supporting that classification.

Key aspects:

- **Scheduling**: The Act created five schedules (I-V) based on potential for abuse, accepted medical use, and safety. Cannabis was placed in Schedule I alongside heroin and LSD.
- **Temporary placement**: The Nixon administration placed cannabis in Schedule I as a temporary measure pending the report of a presidential commission. Cannabis was never reclassified.
- **The Shafer Commission (1972)**: The National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse (the "Shafer Commission"), appointed by President Nixon and chaired by former Pennsylvania Governor Raymond Shafer, recommended decriminalization of personal possession and use. Nixon rejected the recommendation entirely.
- **Political motivation**: White House counsel John Ehrlichman later admitted in a 1994 interview (published in 2016 by Harper's Magazine) that the Nixon administration's drug policy was politically motivated: "We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or Black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and Blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities."

### Decriminalization Wave (1973-1978)

Following the Shafer Commission report, eleven states decriminalized possession of small amounts of cannabis between 1973 and 1978:

| State | Year | Details |
|-------|------|---------|
| Oregon | 1973 | First state to decriminalize; fine-only for <1 oz |
| Alaska | 1975 | Decriminalized + state constitutional privacy right |
| Maine | 1975 | Fine-only for small amounts |
| Colorado | 1975 | Fine-only |
| California | 1975 | Moscone Act; infraction for <1 oz |
| Ohio | 1975 | Fine-only |
| Minnesota | 1976 | Fine-only (petty misdemeanor) |
| Mississippi | 1977 | Fine-only for first offense <30g |
| New York | 1977 | Fine-only for <25g in private |
| North Carolina | 1977 | Fine-only for <0.5 oz |
| Nebraska | 1978 | Fine-only |

President Jimmy Carter (1977-1981) endorsed federal decriminalization, stating, "Penalties against possession of a drug should not be more damaging to an individual than the use of the drug itself."

## The War on Drugs Escalation (1980s-1990s)

### Reagan Administration (1981-1989)

The Reagan administration reversed the decriminalization trend and launched an aggressive escalation of drug enforcement:

- **"Just Say No" campaign (1982)**: First Lady Nancy Reagan's public awareness campaign framed drug use as a moral failing.
- **Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986**: Established mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses, including cannabis. The law created a 100:1 sentencing disparity between crack cocaine and powder cocaine, which disproportionately impacted Black communities.
- **Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988**: Created the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) and the position of "Drug Czar."
- **Asset forfeiture expansion**: Federal asset forfeiture laws were strengthened, allowing law enforcement agencies to seize property associated with drug offenses and retain the proceeds.
- **Cannabis arrests doubled**: Annual cannabis arrests rose from approximately 400,000 in 1980 to over 700,000 by 1990.

### George H.W. Bush (1989-1993)

President Bush continued the Reagan-era War on Drugs, declaring drugs "the gravest domestic threat facing our nation" in his first televised address to the nation in September 1989.

### Clinton Administration (1993-2001)

Despite widespread expectations that the Clinton administration would moderate drug policy, enforcement intensified:

- Annual cannabis arrests continued to rise, reaching 734,000 by 2000.
- Clinton signed the Higher Education Act amendment (1998) denying federal financial aid to students with drug convictions -- a provision that disproportionately affected students of color.
- Clinton's Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey was an outspoken opponent of medical cannabis.

### Incarceration Impact

The combined effect of mandatory minimums, asset forfeiture, and aggressive enforcement was a dramatic expansion of incarceration:

- The U.S. incarcerated population grew from approximately 500,000 in 1980 to over 2.1 million by 2000.
- Drug offenses accounted for the largest share of the growth in federal prison populations.
- By 2000, Black Americans constituted approximately 58% of all people incarcerated for drug offenses, despite comprising 13% of the population and using drugs at comparable rates to white Americans.

## The Medical Cannabis Movement (1996-2012)

### California Compassionate Use Act (1996)

On November 5, 1996, California voters approved Proposition 215, the Compassionate Use Act, making California the first state to legalize medical cannabis. The measure passed with 55.6% of the vote.

Key provisions:

- Patients with a physician's recommendation could possess and cultivate cannabis for medical use
- Qualifying conditions included cancer, AIDS, glaucoma, chronic pain, and other serious illnesses
- The law did not create a state regulatory framework for distribution, leading to a largely unregulated dispensary system

The federal government responded with hostility. Drug Czar Barry McCaffrey threatened to revoke the DEA registrations of physicians who recommended cannabis. A federal court injunction (Conant v. Walters, 2002) ultimately protected physician recommendations as free speech under the First Amendment.

### State Medical Expansion (1998-2012)

Following California, medical cannabis legalization spread steadily:

| Period | States Legalizing Medical Cannabis | Cumulative Total |
|--------|-----------------------------------|-----------------|
| 1996-2000 | CA, AK, OR, WA, ME, HI, NV, CO | 8 |
| 2001-2005 | MT, VT, RI | 11 |
| 2006-2010 | NM, MI, NJ, DC, AZ | 16 |
| 2011-2012 | CT, MA, DE | 19 |

Key milestones:

- **2004, Montana**: Voters approved medical cannabis with 62% support, one of the highest margins.
- **2008, Michigan**: First Midwest state to approve medical cannabis by ballot (63% support).
- **2010, New Jersey**: First state to enact medical cannabis legislatively (rather than by ballot initiative) in the modern era.
- **2012**: By the time Colorado and Washington voted on recreational legalization, 19 states had medical programs.

### Federal Responses

Federal enforcement of cannabis laws in medical states was inconsistent:

- **DEA raids**: The DEA continued to raid medical dispensaries in California and other states throughout the 2000s, including raids during the George W. Bush administration that targeted compliant operators.
- **Ogden Memorandum (2009)**: Deputy AG David Ogden issued guidance directing U.S. Attorneys not to focus resources on individuals in "clear and unambiguous compliance" with state medical cannabis laws.
- **Cole Memorandum (2013)**: Expanded Ogden guidance to address state-legal operations more broadly, establishing the enforcement framework that persists in practice today.

## Recreational Legalization (2012-2024)

### The Breakthrough: Colorado and Washington (2012)

On November 6, 2012, voters in Colorado (Amendment 64, 55.3%) and Washington (Initiative 502, 55.7%) became the first jurisdictions in the world to legalize recreational cannabis for adults through ballot initiatives. This marked the most significant shift in drug policy since the adoption of the Controlled Substances Act.

Key design differences between the two states:

| Feature | Colorado | Washington |
|---------|----------|------------|
| Home cultivation | Permitted (6 plants) | Prohibited |
| Vertical integration | Permitted | Prohibited |
| Tax structure | 15% excise + 15% retail | 37% excise (consolidated from original three-tier) |
| Local control | Opt-out (municipalities may ban) | Opt-out |
| DUI standard | 5 ng/mL THC permissible inference | 5 ng/mL THC per se |

### Federal Response to 2012 Legalization

The Obama administration's response was cautious but ultimately permissive:

- **Cole Memorandum (August 2013)**: Deputy AG James Cole issued updated guidance establishing eight federal enforcement priorities and indicating that the DOJ would not challenge state legalization if states maintained "strong and effective" regulatory systems. The eight priorities: preventing distribution to minors, preventing revenue to criminal enterprises, preventing diversion to non-legal states, preventing cannabis as a pretext for other illegal activity, preventing violence, preventing drugged driving, preventing growing on public lands, and preventing cannabis possession on federal property.
- **FinCEN Guidance (February 2014)**: The Treasury Department issued guidance allowing banks to serve cannabis businesses under enhanced reporting requirements.
- **Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment (2014)**: Congress passed (and has renewed annually) an appropriations rider prohibiting the DOJ from using funds to interfere with state medical cannabis programs.

### The Legalization Wave (2014-2024)

Following Colorado and Washington, legalization spread rapidly:

| Year | States Legalizing | Method | Key Notes |
|------|------------------|--------|-----------|
| 2014 | Alaska, Oregon, D.C. | Ballot | D.C. prohibited from implementing commercial sales by Congressional rider |
| 2016 | California, Nevada, Massachusetts, Maine | Ballot | California was the largest market to legalize |
| 2018 | Vermont, Michigan | Legislature (VT), Ballot (MI) | Vermont was first state to legalize legislatively; no commercial sales initially |
| 2019 | Illinois | Legislature | First state to legalize with comprehensive social equity provisions |
| 2020 | Arizona, Montana, New Jersey, South Dakota* | Ballot | South Dakota measure struck down by state Supreme Court |
| 2021 | New York, New Mexico, Connecticut, Virginia | Legislature | Major shift to legislative action rather than ballot initiative |
| 2022 | Rhode Island, Maryland, Missouri | Legislature (RI), Ballot (MD, MO) | Missouri included automatic expungement |
| 2023 | Delaware, Minnesota, Ohio | Legislature (DE, MN), Ballot (OH) | Ohio was a significant Midwest addition |

### 2024 and Beyond

As of late 2024, several states were considering legalization:

- **Florida**: Amendment 3 was on the November 2024 ballot, requiring 60% approval.
- **Pennsylvania**: Governor Shapiro endorsed legalization; legislative action was under consideration.
- **Hawaii, New Hampshire, Kansas**: Various legislative proposals were pending.
- **Federal**: The DEA rescheduling process was ongoing; comprehensive federal legalization bills remained stalled in Congress.

## Federal Policy Evolution (2020-2024)

### Biden Administration

President Biden took several significant steps on cannabis policy, though he stopped short of supporting legalization:

- **October 2022**: Issued a blanket pardon for all persons convicted of simple possession of cannabis under federal law and D.C. law, affecting approximately 6,500 people with federal convictions and an unknown number with D.C. convictions.
- **October 2022**: Directed the Secretary of HHS and the Attorney General to review the scheduling of cannabis.
- **August 2023**: HHS recommended rescheduling cannabis to Schedule III.
- **May 2024**: DEA published proposed rule to reschedule to Schedule III.
- **December 2023**: Issued a second round of pardons expanding clemency for cannabis offenses.
- **Position**: Biden publicly stated he supported decriminalization and medical use but did not endorse full recreational legalization during his presidency.

### International Context

The United States is not alone in its reconsideration of cannabis policy:

- **Uruguay (2013)**: First country to fully legalize cannabis for recreational use.
- **Canada (2018)**: First major industrialized nation to legalize cannabis nationally (Cannabis Act, C-45).
- **Germany (2024)**: Legalized limited personal possession and home cultivation; cannabis social clubs approved.
- **Thailand (2022)**: Decriminalized cannabis, though subsequent regulatory framework remained in flux.
- **Mexico**: Supreme Court ruled prohibition unconstitutional (2021), though comprehensive legislation remained pending.
- **UN treaty tension**: All of these developments exist in tension with the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, which classifies cannabis as requiring strict control. In December 2020, the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs voted 27-25 to remove cannabis from Schedule IV (the most restrictive UN schedule) while keeping it in Schedule I.
