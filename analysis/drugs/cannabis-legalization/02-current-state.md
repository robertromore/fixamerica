# Cannabis Legalization: Current State

## State Legalization Status

As of late 2024, the United States has a complex patchwork of cannabis laws that vary dramatically by state. No two state programs are identical, and the regulatory landscape continues to evolve rapidly.

### Recreational (Adult-Use) Cannabis States

Twenty-four states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational cannabis for adults aged 21 and over. The following table reflects the status as of November 2024.

| State | Year Legalized | Method | Sales Operational | Regulatory Agency |
|-------|---------------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Colorado | 2012 | Ballot (Amendment 64) | Jan 2014 | Dept. of Revenue, Marijuana Enforcement Division |
| Washington | 2012 | Ballot (I-502) | Jul 2014 | Liquor and Cannabis Board |

### Medical Cannabis States

Thirty-eight states, the District of Columbia, and four U.S. territories have operational medical cannabis programs. Qualifying conditions, possession limits, and program structures vary significantly. Key models include:

- **Broad access states** (e.g., Oklahoma): Physician discretion with minimal qualifying condition restrictions; Oklahoma issued over 380,000 medical licenses to a population of 4 million before approving and then rejecting recreational legalization.
- **Restrictive access states** (e.g., Texas): Limited to low-THC products for a narrow set of qualifying conditions, with very few licensed dispensaries.
- **CBD-only states** (e.g., historical programs in Georgia, Alabama): Allow only cannabidiol products with negligible THC content.

### Prohibition States

As of 2024, Idaho, Wyoming, Kansas, and Nebraska maintain full cannabis prohibition with no medical or recreational exceptions beyond federal hemp law (2018 Farm Bill, defining hemp as cannabis with less than 0.3% delta-9 THC by dry weight).

## Market Data and Industry

### Market Size and Growth

The U.S. legal cannabis market has grown rapidly since the first recreational sales in 2014, though growth rates have moderated as early markets mature.

| Year | Estimated Legal Market Size | Year-over-Year Growth |
|------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| 2018 | $10.4 billion | -- |
| 2019 | $12.2 billion | +17% |
| 2020 | $17.5 billion | +43% (COVID boost) |
| 2021 | $25.2 billion | +44% |
| 2022 | $30.5 billion | +21% |
| 2023 | $33.6 billion | +10% |
| 2024 (projected) | $36-38 billion | +8-12% |

*Sources: MJBizDaily Factbook, 2024; New Frontier Data, 2024; Headset Analytics, 2024*

### Employment

The legal cannabis industry employed an estimated 440,000 full-time equivalent workers in 2023, making it one of the fastest-growing employment sectors in the country. For context, this exceeds the number of electrical engineers (330,000) or dental hygienists (226,000) in the U.S. workforce.

| Employment Category | Estimated Workers |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| Cultivation | ~120,000 |
| Manufacturing/Processing | ~65,000 |
| Retail/Dispensary | ~160,000 |
| Testing/Compliance | ~20,000 |
| Ancillary (legal, consulting, technology) | ~75,000 |

*Source: Leafly Jobs Report, 2024; Vangst Cannabis Industry Employment Report, 2023*

### Illicit Market Persistence

Despite legalization, the illicit cannabis market remains larger than the legal market nationally. In 2023, an estimated $60-70 billion in cannabis was sold through illicit channels, compared to $33.6 billion in legal sales. Key drivers include:

- **Tax avoidance**: Legal cannabis in California can carry a combined tax burden exceeding 40% in some cities, making illicit product significantly cheaper.
- **Licensing barriers**: Limited license availability in states like New York and New Jersey has delayed legal supply while demand exists.
- **Interstate trafficking**: Cannabis produced in high-supply states (Oregon, Oklahoma) is diverted to prohibition or newly legal states where prices are higher.
- **Consumer habits**: Many consumers, particularly in newly legal states, continue purchasing through established illicit sources.

*Sources: New Frontier Data, 2024; Whitney Economics, 2023; California Department of Tax and Fee Administration, 2023*

### Market Structure

The cannabis industry includes a range of business sizes and models:

- **Multi-state operators (MSOs)**: Large publicly traded companies operating in multiple states (e.g., Curaleaf, Trulieve, Green Thumb Industries). The top 10 MSOs generated approximately $7 billion in combined revenue in 2023.
- **Single-state operators**: Medium-sized companies operating within one state.
- **Small cultivators and retailers**: Small businesses, including many social equity licensees, often struggling with high compliance costs and limited access to capital.
- **Vertical integration**: Some states (e.g., New Jersey, Florida) require or incentivize vertical integration, where a single company controls cultivation, processing, and retail. Others (e.g., Washington) prohibit it.

## Federal Status

### Schedule I Classification

Cannabis (referred to as "marihuana" in federal law, per the original 1937 spelling) remains a Schedule I controlled substance under 21 U.S.C. 812. Schedule I substances are defined as having:

1. A high potential for abuse
2. No currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States
3. A lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision

This classification places cannabis alongside heroin, LSD, and MDMA, and above Schedule II substances including cocaine, methamphetamine, fentanyl, and oxycodone -- all of which are recognized as having accepted medical uses.

### Rescheduling Efforts (2022-2024)

In October 2022, President Biden directed the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to review the scheduling of cannabis. In August 2023, HHS recommended that cannabis be rescheduled to Schedule III, based on an FDA scientific review finding that cannabis has a currently accepted medical use and a moderate-to-low potential for physical and psychological dependence.

In May 2024, the DEA published a proposed rule to reschedule cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III. The key implications of Schedule III reclassification would include:

- **Tax relief**: Elimination of the Section 280E tax penalty, which prohibits cannabis businesses from deducting ordinary business expenses
- **Research access**: Simplified research protocols, though cannabis would still be controlled
- **Medical recognition**: Formal federal acknowledgment that cannabis has accepted medical use
- **No legalization effect**: Rescheduling to Schedule III would not legalize recreational cannabis or resolve the state-federal conflict for adult-use markets

As of late 2024, the DEA rulemaking process was ongoing, with a public comment period that generated over 40,000 submissions and an administrative law judge hearing scheduled.

*Sources: 88 Fed. Reg. 44920 (proposed rule, 2024); HHS Recommendation Letter, August 2023; Congressional Research Service, "Cannabis Rescheduling," R47934, 2024*

### Cole Memorandum and Federal Enforcement

The Department of Justice has taken varied approaches to cannabis enforcement:

- **2013 Cole Memorandum**: Deputy AG James Cole issued guidance directing federal prosecutors to deprioritize enforcement in states with "strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems," focusing instead on eight federal priorities (preventing distribution to minors, preventing revenue from going to criminal enterprises, preventing diversion to other states, etc.).
- **2018 Sessions Memorandum**: AG Jeff Sessions rescinded the Cole Memorandum, returning discretion to individual U.S. Attorneys.
- **2022 Biden pardons**: President Biden issued a blanket pardon for all federal simple possession offenses and directed the scheduling review.
- **Current practice**: Despite the rescission of the Cole Memo, no significant federal enforcement actions have been taken against state-legal cannabis businesses since 2014. Federal enforcement has focused primarily on large-scale interstate trafficking, unlicensed operations, and operations violating state law.

### Congressional Gridlock

Multiple cannabis reform bills have been introduced in recent Congresses but none has been enacted:

| Bill | Sponsor | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|---------|--------|
| MORE Act | Rep. Nadler (D-NY) | Deschedule cannabis, expunge records | Passed House (2020, 2022); not taken up by Senate |
| Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act (CAOA) | Sen. Schumer (D-NY) | Comprehensive descheduling and regulation | Introduced 2022; no floor vote |
| SAFE Banking Act | Rep. Perlmutter (D-CO) | Allow financial services for cannabis businesses | Passed House 7 times; blocked in Senate |
| STATES Act | Sen. Gardner (R-CO) | Protect states with legal cannabis from federal interference | Introduced 2019; no floor vote |
| HOPE Act | Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) | Reschedule cannabis to Schedule III | Introduced 2023; no floor vote |

## Banking and Financial Access

### The Banking Crisis

Cannabis businesses in the United States operate in a financial gray zone that would be untenable for any other legal industry. Because cannabis remains federally illegal, financial institutions that serve cannabis businesses face potential liability under multiple federal statutes:

- **Bank Secrecy Act (BSA)**: Requires banks to file Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) for transactions involving proceeds of illegal activity.
- **Money laundering statutes**: 18 U.S.C. 1956-1957 criminalize transactions involving proceeds of specified unlawful activity, which includes cannabis trafficking under federal law.
- **FDIC/NCUA risk**: Federally insured banks and credit unions risk regulatory action for serving cannabis businesses.

### FinCEN Guidance

In 2014, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued guidance allowing financial institutions to serve cannabis businesses under certain conditions, primarily by filing detailed SARs and conducting enhanced due diligence. As of June 2024, approximately 812 banks and credit unions reported serving cannabis businesses, up from fewer than 100 in 2014.

| Year | Banks/Credit Unions Filing Cannabis SARs |
|------|----------------------------------------|
| 2014 | ~105 |
| 2017 | ~411 |
| 2020 | ~706 |
| 2022 | ~755 |
| 2024 (Q2) | ~812 |

*Source: FinCEN BSA/SAR Statistics, 2024*

However, the vast majority of these institutions are small community banks or credit unions. Most major national banks -- JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citibank -- do not serve cannabis businesses. The result:

- Cannabis businesses pay banking fees 5-10 times higher than comparable non-cannabis businesses
- Many businesses still operate primarily in cash, creating security risks (the IRS estimates $10 billion in annual cannabis transactions are cash-based)
- Armored car services charge premium rates, and some refuse cannabis clients entirely
- Payroll processing, merchant services, and business insurance remain difficult to obtain
- Cannabis companies cannot access Small Business Administration loans or federally backed financing

### SAFE Banking Act

The Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act would prohibit federal regulators from penalizing financial institutions for serving cannabis businesses operating in compliance with state law. The bill has passed the U.S. House of Representatives seven times between 2019 and 2023, with bipartisan support (most recently 321-101 in 2023). It has been blocked in the Senate repeatedly, primarily due to:

- Some senators insisting on attaching comprehensive reform (descheduling, expungement) to any cannabis legislation
- Senate leadership decisions on floor time
- Concerns from some members about appearing to normalize cannabis use

## Tax Revenue

### State Tax Revenue

Legal cannabis has generated substantial tax revenue for state and local governments. Cumulative collections from 2014 through 2023 exceeded $15.1 billion.

| State | Cumulative Tax Revenue (through 2023) | Annual Revenue (FY2023) | Tax Structure |
|-------|--------------------------------------|------------------------|---------------|
| Colorado | $2.51 billion | $354 million | 15% excise + 15% retail |
| Washington | $3.85 billion | $530 million | 37% excise |
| California | $2.05 billion | $480 million | 15% excise + local taxes |
| Illinois | $1.56 billion | $490 million | 7% excise + 10-25% THC-based + local |
| Oregon | $950 million | $161 million | 17% retail |
| Michigan | $850 million | $330 million | 10% excise + 6% sales |
| Massachusetts | $740 million | $205 million | 10.75% excise + 6.25% sales + 3% local |
| Nevada | $650 million | $195 million | 10% wholesale + 10% excise |
| Arizona | $520 million | $265 million | 16% excise |
| New Jersey | $160 million | $115 million | 6.625% social equity excise + local |

*Sources: Marijuana Policy Project Revenue Tracker, 2024; state Department of Revenue reports; Tax Foundation, 2024*

### Revenue Allocation

States allocate cannabis tax revenue to a variety of purposes:

- **Education**: Colorado directs the first $40 million in excise tax annually to school construction (BEST program); Illinois directs 25% to the General Revenue Fund.
- **Social equity/community reinvestment**: Illinois allocates 25% of revenue to its R3 (Restore, Reinvest, Renew) program for communities harmed by the War on Drugs; New Jersey directs 70% to Impact Zones.
- **General fund**: Most states direct a significant portion to their general fund.
- **Drug treatment and prevention**: Oregon allocates 40% to behavioral health; Washington directs a portion to substance abuse prevention.
- **Public safety**: Several states fund law enforcement training, DUI enforcement, and other public safety programs.

### Section 280E Federal Tax Burden

Under Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code, businesses trafficking in Schedule I or II controlled substances cannot deduct ordinary business expenses (rent, payroll, utilities, marketing) from their federal tax obligations. They may only deduct cost of goods sold (COGS). This results in effective federal tax rates of 40-70% for cannabis businesses, compared to the standard 21% corporate rate.

The 280E burden costs the cannabis industry an estimated $1.8 billion annually in excess federal taxes. Rescheduling cannabis to Schedule III would eliminate the 280E penalty, as Section 280E applies only to Schedule I and II substances.

## Social Equity and Enforcement Disparities

### Arrest and Enforcement Data

Although cannabis use rates are roughly similar across racial groups (approximately 18% of white adults and 19% of Black adults reported past-year use in 2022, per SAMHSA), enforcement has been dramatically unequal.

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Total cannabis arrests (2022) | ~170,000 | FBI Crime Data Explorer, 2023 |
| Peak annual cannabis arrests (2007) | 872,000+ | FBI UCR, 2008 |
| Cannabis share of all drug arrests (2022) | ~31% | FBI Crime Data Explorer, 2023 |
| Black-white arrest ratio (national, 2018) | 3.73:1 | ACLU, 2020 |
| Black-white arrest ratio (Montana) | 9.6:1 | ACLU, 2020 |
| Black-white arrest ratio (Kentucky) | 9.4:1 | ACLU, 2020 |
| Estimated Americans with cannabis records | 15-20 million | Last Prisoner Project, 2023 |
| People incarcerated for cannabis offenses (2022) | ~40,000 | Prison Policy Initiative, 2023 |

*Sources: FBI Uniform Crime Reporting / Crime Data Explorer; ACLU, "A Tale of Two Countries," 2020; SAMHSA National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2022*

### Social Equity Programs

As of 2024, at least 18 states with legal cannabis have established social equity programs of varying scope and effectiveness. Common elements include:

- **Priority licensing**: Preference in license applications for individuals with cannabis convictions or residents of disproportionately impacted areas (e.g., Illinois, New York, New Jersey)
- **Reduced fees**: Lowered licensing and application fees for equity applicants
- **Technical assistance**: Business training, mentorship, and regulatory compliance support
- **Community reinvestment**: Directing tax revenue to communities disproportionately harmed by enforcement (e.g., Illinois R3 program)
- **Expungement**: Automatic or facilitated expungement of cannabis convictions (e.g., Illinois automatic expungement of records under 30 grams)

### Challenges with Social Equity Implementation

Despite good intentions, social equity programs have faced significant criticism:

- **New York**: The state prioritized equity licenses but faced lawsuits from existing operators, regulatory delays, and a thriving illicit market that undercut legal equity businesses. Only 103 of 463 planned equity licenses were awarded in the first two years.
- **California**: The state's equity programs were administered at the local level with inconsistent funding and support; many equity licensees closed within two years due to undercapitalization.
- **Illinois**: Despite one of the most ambitious equity frameworks, delays in licensing and litigation over the lottery process meant that social equity dispensary licenses were not awarded until 2022, three years after legalization.
- **Access to capital**: Social equity licensees typically cannot access traditional bank loans or venture capital, and the industry's federal illegality makes fundraising exceptionally difficult.

## Public Health Data

### Usage Rates

| Population | Past-Year Use Rate (2022) | Past-Month Use Rate (2022) |
|------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Adults 18+ | 22.0% | 14.0% |
| Adults 18-25 | 35.4% | 22.0% |
| Adolescents 12-17 | 11.1% | 6.3% |

*Source: SAMHSA, National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 2023*

### Youth Usage Trends

A central concern regarding legalization is its potential impact on youth use. The available evidence from states with legal recreational cannabis shows:

- **No significant increase in youth use post-legalization**: The National Survey on Drug Use and Health and the CDC's Youth Risk Behavior Survey have not found statistically significant increases in teen cannabis use in states that legalized recreational cannabis. Colorado data from 2011-2023 shows teen use rates fluctuating but not meaningfully increasing since legalization in 2012.
- **Monitoring the Future survey (2023)**: 30-day prevalence of cannabis use among 12th graders was 29.0%, essentially unchanged from pre-legalization levels (2012: 22.9% -- though national data includes states without legalization).
- **Mechanism**: Legalization replaces illegal dealers (who do not check IDs) with regulated dispensaries (which are required to verify age 21+). However, adult-use legalization may increase social availability through adult purchasers.

*Sources: SAMHSA NSDUH, 2023; Monitoring the Future, University of Michigan, 2023; Colorado Dept. of Public Health and Environment, 2023*

### Impaired Driving

Cannabis-impaired driving remains a significant public health concern, though measurement challenges complicate assessment:

- There is no scientifically validated roadside test equivalent to a breathalyzer for cannabis impairment
- THC can remain detectable in blood for days or weeks after impairment has subsided
- States use per se limits (e.g., Washington: 5 ng/mL blood THC; Colorado: 5 ng/mL permissible inference) or impairment-based standards
- Studies on the impact of legalization on traffic fatalities show mixed results: a 2022 JAMA Internal Medicine study found a modest increase in fatal crashes in states with recreational dispensaries, while a 2023 Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs analysis found no significant effect

*Sources: National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), 2023; Santaella-Tenorio et al., JAMA Internal Medicine, 2022; Kamer et al., Journal of Studies on Alcohol and Drugs, 2023*

---

## Regulatory Models

States have adopted several distinct regulatory approaches:

### Licensing Models

| Model | States | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| **Open licensing** | Oklahoma (medical), Oregon | Unlimited or high-cap licenses; market-driven entry |
| **Limited licensing** | New Jersey, Connecticut, New York | Capped licenses awarded through competitive application or lottery |
| **Hybrid** | Colorado, Michigan | Initially limited, expanded over time |

### Vertical Integration

| Approach | States | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Required** | Florida (medical), historically NJ | Supply chain control, but limits competition |
| **Prohibited** | Washington | Prevents monopolization, but may reduce efficiency |
| **Permitted** | Colorado, California, Illinois | Market flexibility |

### Consumption

| Policy | States | Details |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Consumption lounges** | Nevada, New York, New Jersey | Licensed on-site consumption venues |
| **Home cultivation** | Most legal states | Typically 6-12 plants per household |
| **Prohibited home cultivation** | Washington, New Jersey, Illinois | Dispensary-only access |

---

## Recent Developments (2024)

- **DEA rescheduling**: Proposed rule to move cannabis to Schedule III published May 2024; comment period and ALJ hearing underway.
- **Ohio**: Voters approved Issue 2 in November 2023; regulatory framework being developed for 2024-2025 sales launch.
- **Florida**: A legalization ballot measure (Amendment 3) was on the November 2024 ballot, requiring 60% approval.
- **South Dakota**: A legalization ballot measure was being considered after a 2020 voter-approved measure was struck down by the state Supreme Court.
- **Federal enforcement**: No change in the de facto non-enforcement posture toward state-legal operations.
- **Industry consolidation**: Continued mergers and acquisitions among MSOs amid price compression and margin pressure in mature markets.
