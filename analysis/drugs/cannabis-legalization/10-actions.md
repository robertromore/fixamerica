## Individual Actions

### Educate Yourself

**Effort level**: Low

1. **Understand your state's cannabis laws**: Know the current legal status of cannabis in your state, including medical and recreational provisions, possession limits, and penalties. The National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) maintains a current state-by-state tracker.

2. **Learn the key issues**: Familiarize yourself with the core policy debates:
    - Federal scheduling and the difference between rescheduling and descheduling
    - The SAFE Banking Act and why cannabis businesses lack banking access
    - Section 280E and its impact on cannabis business taxation
    - Racial disparities in cannabis enforcement
    - Social equity programs and their challenges
    - The arguments for and against legalization (see [06-opposition.md](06-opposition.md))

3. **Follow reliable sources**: Subscribe to policy-focused cannabis news sources:
    - Marijuana Moment (marijuanamoment.net) -- daily legislative and policy coverage
    - Cannabis Wire (cannabiswire.com) -- investigative policy journalism
    - NORML newsletter (norml.org) -- advocacy updates and state law tracking

4. **Read the research**: Review key studies and reports:
    - National Academies of Sciences, *The Health Effects of Cannabis and Cannabinoids* (2017)
    - ACLU, *A Tale of Two Countries* (2020) -- racial disparities in enforcement
    - Congressional Research Service reports on cannabis scheduling and federal policy

### Contact Your Representatives

**Effort level**: Low-Medium

1. **Identify your representatives**: Find your U.S. senators, U.S. representative, state legislators, and governor using:
    - U.S. Senate: senate.gov/senators
    - U.S. House: house.gov/representatives
    - State legislators: openstates.org

2. **Express your position on key federal bills**:
    - **SAFE Banking Act**: Ask your senators to support bringing the SAFE Banking Act to a floor vote and passing it.
    - **Rescheduling/Descheduling**: Express your position on federal scheduling reform and the DEA's proposed rescheduling to Schedule III.
    - **Comprehensive reform**: Urge support for comprehensive cannabis reform legislation (e.g., Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act or future comprehensive bills).
    - **Expungement**: Ask your representatives to support federal expungement legislation for cannabis offenses.

3. **Effective communication tips**:
    - Be specific: Reference specific bills by name and number.
    - Be personal: If cannabis policy has affected you, your family, or your community, share your story.
    - Be concise: One clear ask per communication is most effective.
    - Use multiple channels: Phone calls, emails, letters, town halls, and social media all have value. Phone calls to district offices are considered most impactful by congressional staff.
    - Follow up: Sustained engagement is more effective than one-time contacts.

4. **State-level engagement**:
    - If your state has not legalized cannabis, contact state legislators about introducing legalization bills.
    - If your state has legalized, contact legislators about improving social equity provisions, reducing excessive tax rates, or expanding expungement programs.
    - Attend state legislative hearings on cannabis policy and provide public testimony.

### Participate in the Democratic Process

**Effort level**: Medium

1. **Vote informed**: Research candidates' positions on cannabis policy before elections. Organizations like NORML and MPP publish voter guides and candidate scorecards.

2. **Support ballot initiatives**: If your state is considering a cannabis legalization ballot initiative:
    - Sign petitions to qualify measures for the ballot
    - Volunteer for initiative campaigns (canvassing, phone banking, voter education)
    - Donate to initiative campaign organizations
    - Share accurate information about the initiative with your community

3. **Participate in the federal rulemaking process**: When the DEA or other federal agencies publish proposed rules on cannabis (such as the 2024 rescheduling proposal), submit public comments. Instructions are available on regulations.gov. Public comments are part of the official record and do influence the final rule.

4. **Attend town halls**: Ask your elected officials about their position on cannabis reform at public forums. This creates a public record and signals constituent interest.

### Engage in the Public Comment Process

**Effort level**: Low-Medium

Federal rulemaking on cannabis (such as the DEA's rescheduling proposal) includes a public comment period during which any individual can submit comments. Effective comments:

- Reference specific aspects of the proposed rule
- Cite evidence and data
- Explain how the rule affects you, your community, or public policy
- Are respectful and substantive
- Can be submitted online at regulations.gov

The 2024 DEA rescheduling proposal generated over 40,000 public comments, demonstrating significant public engagement.

## Community Actions

### Support Expungement and Record Relief

**Effort level**: Medium

1. **Volunteer with expungement clinics**: Organizations across the country hold free legal clinics to help individuals clear cannabis records. Volunteer as an organizer, intake worker, or (if qualified) legal advisor.
    - Last Prisoner Project (lastprisonerproject.org) coordinates expungement efforts
    - Many local legal aid organizations and law school clinics offer expungement assistance
    - Some states (e.g., Illinois) host state-organized expungement events

2. **Advocate for automatic expungement**: If your state does not have automatic expungement for cannabis offenses, advocate for legislation modeled on Illinois's or Missouri's automatic systems, which do not require individuals to petition courts individually.

3. **Employer advocacy**: If you are an employer or have influence in your workplace:
    - Advocate for "ban the box" policies that remove criminal history questions from initial job applications
    - Support policies that do not disqualify candidates based solely on cannabis convictions
    - Educate HR departments about the changing legal landscape of cannabis

### Support Social Equity

**Effort level**: Medium-High

1. **Support equity businesses**: In states with legal cannabis, seek out and patronize social equity-licensed dispensaries and brands. Ask your dispensary about the ownership and equity status of the products they carry.

2. **Advocate for equity provisions**: In your state or municipality:
    - Push for dedicated social equity licensing with genuine support (capital access, technical assistance, reduced fees)
    - Advocate for community reinvestment of cannabis tax revenue in disproportionately impacted neighborhoods
    - Oppose licensing structures that create barriers to entry for small businesses and equity applicants

3. **Support community reinvestment**: Engage with local government to ensure cannabis tax revenue is directed to communities impacted by prohibition, including:
    - Education and workforce development
    - Housing assistance
    - Healthcare and mental health services
    - Youth programs
    - Small business support

### Organize Locally

**Effort level**: High

1. **Join or start a local advocacy chapter**: NORML has state and local chapters across the country that organize advocacy events, voter education, and community engagement.

2. **Build coalitions**: Cannabis reform intersects with multiple issues:
    - **Criminal justice reform**: Partner with organizations working on mass incarceration, racial justice, and sentencing reform
    - **Civil liberties**: Partner with ACLU chapters and civil liberties organizations
    - **Small business advocacy**: Partner with small business associations and chambers of commerce
    - **Veterans**: Partner with veterans organizations advocating for cannabis access (e.g., Veterans Cannabis Coalition)
    - **Faith communities**: Engage faith leaders who support restorative justice and compassionate drug policy

3. **Engage local government**: Cannabis regulation often has a significant local component:
    - Attend city council and county board meetings where cannabis zoning, licensing, and local opt-in/opt-out decisions are made
    - Advocate for your municipality to opt in to cannabis sales if your state allows local control
    - Push for local social equity provisions and community benefit agreements

## Organizational Actions

### For Businesses

1. **Cannabis industry**: Join trade associations (NCIA, Cannabis Trade Federation) that lobby for federal reform. Contribute to social equity funds and mentorship programs. Practice responsible marketing that does not target youth.

2. **Non-cannabis businesses**: If your business serves cannabis companies (law, accounting, real estate, consulting), advocate for SAFE Banking and descheduling through your industry associations.

3. **Financial institutions**: If your bank or credit union is considering cannabis banking, the American Bankers Association provides guidance and advocacy resources. Support the SAFE Banking Act through your industry lobbyists.

### For Legal Professionals

1. **Pro bono expungement**: Provide pro bono legal services for cannabis record expungement. Many state bar associations have organized efforts.

2. **Policy advocacy**: Submit comments on proposed regulations, draft amicus briefs in cannabis-related litigation, and advise legislators on regulatory design.

3. **Legal education**: Write and publish on cannabis law developments; present at bar association and CLE events.

### For Healthcare Professionals

1. **Stay informed**: Follow the latest research on cannabis health effects, dosing, drug interactions, and medical applications.

2. **Patient education**: Provide evidence-based information to patients who use or are considering cannabis, including risks, benefits, and legal status.

3. **Professional advocacy**: Support the removal of research barriers through professional medical associations (AMA, specialty societies).

4. **Veterans**: VA physicians are currently prohibited from recommending cannabis even in legal states. Support policy change through the VA and congressional advocacy.

### For Educators and Researchers

1. **Evidence-based education**: Develop and implement evidence-based cannabis education programs for youth that provide accurate information about risks and legal status, avoiding "reefer madness"-style scare tactics that have been shown to be counterproductive.

2. **Research**: Apply for cannabis research grants through NIH, NIDA, and state-funded programs. Conduct studies on health effects, public health outcomes, regulatory effectiveness, and social equity.

3. **Public scholarship**: Translate research findings into accessible formats for policymakers, media, and the public.
