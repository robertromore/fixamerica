# Cannabis Legalization: Solutions

## Overview

The problems identified in this analysis -- federal-state conflict, banking exclusion, racial disparities, illicit market persistence, social equity failures, and irrational scheduling -- require a comprehensive set of reforms at the federal, state, and local levels. These solutions range from incremental steps that could be achieved under current political conditions to transformative reforms that would require significant legislative action.

The solutions are organized from most immediately achievable to most comprehensive.

---

## Solution 1: SAFE Banking Act -- Financial Services Access

### Problem Addressed

Cannabis businesses operating legally under state law cannot access standard banking services, forcing them into dangerous cash-only operations and denying them basic financial tools available to every other legal industry.

### Proposal

Enact the Secure and Fair Enforcement (SAFE) Banking Act to:

- Prohibit federal banking regulators from penalizing financial institutions solely for serving cannabis businesses that comply with state law
- Establish a safe harbor for banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions that provide services to state-legal cannabis businesses
- Protect depository institutions from adverse regulatory action, including loss of federal deposit insurance, for cannabis banking
- Require FinCEN to issue updated guidance for cannabis-related banking activities
- Extend protections to ancillary businesses (landlords, accountants, lawyers) that provide services to the cannabis industry

### Evidence Base

- The SAFE Banking Act has passed the U.S. House seven times with bipartisan support (most recently 321-101 in September 2023).
- Only approximately 812 of ~9,000 financial institutions nationally serve cannabis businesses.
- Cannabis cash operations create documented public safety risks: armed robberies at dispensaries and grows are a significant concern in legal states.
- The American Bankers Association, Credit Union National Association, and Independent Community Bankers of America all support the legislation.

### Implementation

- **Federal legislation**: SAFE Banking Act or equivalent provision
- **Regulatory guidance**: Updated FinCEN guidance, OCC bulletins, and FDIC/NCUA letters
- **Timeline**: Could be enacted immediately; implementation within 6-12 months
- **Cost**: Minimal federal cost; significant cost savings for cannabis businesses and increased tax compliance

### Limitations

- Does not address the underlying federal illegality of cannabis
- Does not resolve Section 280E tax issues
- Does not provide access to bankruptcy protection, SBA loans, or full capital market access
- Some advocates argue passing banking reform alone reduces urgency for comprehensive legalization

---

## Solution 2: Federal Rescheduling to Schedule III

### Problem Addressed

Schedule I classification of cannabis contradicts scientific evidence, creates the 280E tax burden, impedes research, and forms the legal basis for the federal-state conflict.

### Proposal

Reschedule cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act, as recommended by HHS and proposed by the DEA in 2024. Schedule III substances are defined as having moderate-to-low potential for physical and psychological dependence and currently accepted medical use.

### Effects of Schedule III Reclassification

| Issue | Current (Schedule I) | After Schedule III |
|-------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Section 280E tax penalty | Applies (40-70% effective rate) | Eliminated |
| Research | Extremely restricted | Simplified (still requires DEA license) |
| Medical recognition | Federally denied | Federally acknowledged |
| State-legal recreational markets | Still federally illegal | Still federally illegal |
| Banking | Ambiguous | Somewhat improved but not fully resolved |
| Prescriptions | Not possible | Possible through registered practitioners |

### Evidence Base

- The FDA's 2023 scientific review found that cannabis has "currently accepted medical use," directly contradicting the Schedule I criteria.
- HHS formally recommended Schedule III in August 2023.
- 38 states have independently concluded that cannabis has medical value.
- The National Academies of Sciences found substantial evidence of cannabis efficacy for multiple conditions.
- Schedule III would save the cannabis industry an estimated $1.8 billion annually in excess federal taxes under 280E.

### Limitations

- Does not legalize recreational cannabis at the federal level
- Does not fully resolve the banking crisis (cannabis businesses still potentially violate federal drug trafficking laws)
- Does not address expungement or social equity
- Does not create a framework for interstate commerce
- May reduce political urgency for more comprehensive reform

---

## Solution 3: Federal Descheduling and Comprehensive Legalization

### Problem Addressed

The most comprehensive solution would remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act entirely and establish a federal regulatory framework for legal production, distribution, and sale.

### Proposal

Enact comprehensive federal legislation (modeled on the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act or similar framework) to:

- **Deschedule cannabis**: Remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act entirely, eliminating the federal prohibition
- **Establish federal regulation**: Create a regulatory framework governed by the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Cannabis) or a new agency, modeled on alcohol regulation:
    - Federal licensing for cultivators, processors, distributors, and retailers
    - Product safety standards (testing, labeling, packaging)
    - Advertising restrictions (modeled on tobacco/alcohol)
    - Age restrictions (21+ for recreational; medical access under physician supervision)
    - Potency labeling requirements
    - Impaired driving standards and research mandates
- **Preserve state authority**: Allow states to maintain their own regulatory frameworks, including the right to maintain prohibition (similar to alcohol "dry" counties/states)
- **Establish federal excise tax**: Implement a federal excise tax on cannabis sales, with revenue directed to social equity, public health, and research
- **Interstate commerce framework**: Establish rules for interstate cannabis trade once federal legalization takes effect
- **Expungement and social equity**: Include comprehensive criminal record relief and social equity provisions (see Solutions 5 and 6)

### Regulatory Model Options

| Model | Analogy | Pros | Cons |
|-------|---------|------|------|
| **Alcohol-style** | ATF regulation, state control, three-tier system | Familiar framework, state flexibility | Three-tier system may limit innovation |
| **Tobacco-style** | FDA regulation, heavy restrictions on marketing | Strong public health protections | Overly restrictive for a less harmful substance |
| **Novel cannabis agency** | New federal Cannabis Control Authority | Tailored to cannabis-specific issues | Political difficulty of creating new agency |
| **Hybrid** | Federal standards + state flexibility | Balances uniformity and experimentation | Complex implementation |

### Evidence Base

- 70% of Americans support legalization (Gallup, 2023).
- 24 states + D.C. have legalized recreational cannabis, providing extensive regulatory experience.
- Canada's national legalization (2018) provides a comparable international model.
- Alcohol's post-prohibition regulatory framework (21st Amendment, Federal Alcohol Administration Act) provides a tested template for ending prohibition while maintaining regulatory control.

### Limitations

- Requires significant congressional action (unlikely in the near term under current political dynamics)
- Complex regulatory design with potential for unintended consequences
- Interstate commerce could threaten small operators in high-cost states
- International treaty compliance issues
- Risk of federal regulation overriding effective state programs

## Solution 4: Taxation Reform

### Problem Addressed

Excessively high cannabis tax rates drive consumers to the illicit market, undermining public safety and revenue goals. Section 280E imposes crushing federal tax burdens on cannabis businesses.

### Proposals

**Federal level:**

- **Eliminate 280E**: Either through descheduling, rescheduling to Schedule III, or targeted legislation
- **Federal excise tax**: If cannabis is descheduled, establish a federal excise tax at a level that generates revenue without driving consumers to the illicit market. Recommended range: 5-15% of retail price.
- **Revenue allocation**: Direct federal cannabis tax revenue to:
    - Social equity and community reinvestment (40%)
    - Public health research and education (25%)
    - Substance abuse treatment (20%)
    - Federal enforcement against illicit market (15%)

**State level best practices:**

| Practice | Recommendation | Evidence |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| Tax rate | Combined state/local tax burden should not exceed 20-25% | States exceeding this threshold (CA, IL) see larger illicit markets |
| Tax structure | Weight-based or THC-based tax preferred over ad valorem percentage | Prevents regressive taxation of lower-price products |
| Phase-in | Start with lower rates and increase gradually | Allows legal market to establish price competitiveness |
| Local caps | Limit local add-on taxes to prevent cumulative over-taxation | California's uncontrolled local taxes drive total burden above 40% |
| Revenue allocation | Earmark for specified purposes (equity, education, health) | Builds public support and accountability |

### Evidence Base

- Colorado's initial 28.15% combined rate (since adjusted) is widely considered near the upper limit of viability.
- Washington's original three-tier tax system (producer, processor, retail) was consolidated to a single 37% retail tax in 2015 due to the complexity and economic distortion of the multi-tier approach.
- California's combination of 15% state excise, state cultivation tax (eliminated 2022 due to market distress), sales tax, and local taxes created rates exceeding 40%, widely cited as a primary driver of illicit market persistence.
- Oregon's relatively low 17% retail tax has contributed to one of the more competitive legal markets, though oversupply has been a separate problem.

## Solution 5: Comprehensive Expungement and Record Relief

### Problem Addressed

An estimated 15-20 million Americans carry cannabis criminal records that impede employment, housing, education, travel, immigration status, and civic participation. These records fall disproportionately on Black and Latino Americans.

### Proposals

**Federal level:**

- **Automatic federal expungement**: Automatically expunge all federal cannabis convictions for conduct that is no longer illegal under the new legal framework
- **Resentencing**: Allow individuals currently incarcerated for federal cannabis offenses to petition for resentencing or release
- **Clemency**: Presidential clemency for all individuals serving federal sentences for cannabis offenses
- **Collateral consequences removal**: Federal legislation to prohibit denial of federal benefits, employment, or housing based solely on a cannabis conviction

**State level model:**

- **Automatic expungement**: States should adopt automatic expungement for all cannabis offenses below the threshold set by their legalization law (e.g., Illinois automatically expunges records for amounts under 30 grams)
- **Proactive notification**: States should notify affected individuals that their records have been cleared
- **No fee**: Expungement should be free of charge; many current processes impose fees that are barriers for affected individuals
- **Timeline**: Expungement should be completed within 12-18 months of legalization taking effect

### Implementation Models

| State | Mechanism | Scope | Timeline |
|-------|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Illinois** | Automatic (governor's pardon + expungement) | <30g possession | Ongoing since 2020 |
| **California** | Automatic (AB 1793, 2018) | Eligible convictions per Prop 64 | Completed 2022 |
| **New Jersey** | Automatic (CREAMMA, 2021) | Eligible convictions | Ongoing |
| **Vermont** | Automatic (2022) | Eligible possession convictions | Completed 2023 |
| **Missouri** | Automatic (Amendment 3, 2022) | Eligible cannabis convictions | Ongoing |

### Evidence Base

- Illinois has processed over 800,000 cannabis arrest records for expungement since 2020.
- California processed over 200,000 convictions for dismissal or redesignation under AB 1793.
- Studies show that criminal record relief increases employment (13% increase in employment within one year, University of Michigan study) and reduces recidivism.
- The estimated economic cost of cannabis criminal records is $30-50 billion annually in lost wages and economic output.

## Solution 6: Social Equity Framework

### Problem Addressed

Communities most harmed by cannabis prohibition -- predominantly Black and Latino neighborhoods -- are underrepresented in the legal cannabis industry and have received limited tangible benefits from legalization.

### Proposals

**Licensing equity:**

- Dedicate a minimum percentage (25-50%) of cannabis licenses to social equity applicants, defined as:
    - Individuals with cannabis convictions
    - Residents of communities disproportionately impacted by cannabis enforcement (using data-driven criteria)
    - Individuals whose family members have cannabis convictions
- Provide priority processing for equity applications
- Reduce or waive licensing fees for equity applicants
- Prohibit equity licenses from being immediately transferred to non-equity entities

**Capital access:**

- Create state and federal loan and grant programs specifically for social equity cannabis businesses
- Establish cannabis-specific Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs)
- Require MSOs that benefit from legalization to contribute to equity funds (as a condition of licensing)
- Leverage cannabis tax revenue for low-interest loans to equity businesses

**Technical support:**

- Fund regulatory compliance assistance for equity licensees
- Provide business incubators and shared manufacturing/retail spaces
- Offer mentorship programs pairing equity licensees with experienced operators
- Provide legal services for equity applicants navigating licensing and compliance

**Community reinvestment:**

- Direct a minimum percentage (15-25%) of cannabis tax revenue to disproportionately impacted communities
- Invest in education, housing, healthcare, job training, and community development in affected neighborhoods
- Establish community advisory boards to guide reinvestment spending
- Create metrics and accountability mechanisms for reinvestment outcomes

### Evidence Base

- Illinois's R3 (Restore, Reinvest, Renew) program has distributed over $140 million to affected communities since 2020.
- New Jersey directs 70% of cannabis tax revenue to Impact Zones (municipalities with the highest rates of cannabis arrests).
- Despite these programs, approximately 81% of cannabis business owners are white (Leafly, 2021), demonstrating the need for more effective equity mechanisms.

## Solution 7: Illicit Market Reduction Strategy

### Problem Addressed

The illicit cannabis market remains larger than the legal market nationally, undermining public health, safety, and tax revenue.

### Proposals

**Demand-side (make legal market competitive):**

- Reduce excessive tax rates to keep combined state/local burden below 20-25%
- Increase licensing to eliminate supply shortages
- Streamline regulatory compliance to reduce costs passed to consumers
- Improve product variety, quality, and convenience in legal markets
- Allow delivery services and online ordering in all legal states

**Supply-side (reduce illicit supply):**

- Fund state and local enforcement against unlicensed operators, particularly unlicensed storefronts
- Target large-scale illicit cultivation and interstate trafficking operations
- Coordinate enforcement between legal and prohibition states
- Address oversupply in source states (Oregon, Oklahoma) through production controls or interstate commerce

**Transition support:**

- Create pathways for legacy (previously illicit) operators to enter the legal market through amnesty and licensing programs
- California's legacy operator transition programs provide a model, though implementation has been challenging
- Reduce barriers to entry for small cultivators and retailers

---

## Solution 8: Interstate Commerce Framework

### Problem Addressed

Cannabis cannot currently be transported across state lines, even between two legal states. This creates market inefficiencies, prevents states with favorable growing conditions from supplying other states, and contributes to both oversupply in some states and undersupply in others.

### Proposal

As part of or following federal legalization, establish an interstate commerce framework:

- **Federal commerce clause authority**: Federal legislation would establish the legal basis for interstate cannabis trade
- **State opt-in**: States would choose whether to allow imports and exports (similar to alcohol)
- **Tracking and compliance**: Interstate shipments would use federal tracking systems to prevent diversion
- **Phased implementation**: Allow a 3-5 year transition period before full interstate commerce to let newer state markets develop
- **Small farmer protections**: Consider appellation and origin protections (similar to wine appellations) to protect small and craft cultivators

### Considerations

- Interstate commerce would likely reduce prices nationally, benefiting consumers but potentially harming operators in high-cost states
- States with established industries (Colorado, Oregon) would benefit from exporting to new markets
- States with nascent programs may need transition protections
- Oregon passed the first state law (2019) authorizing interstate cannabis commerce, contingent on federal legalization

---

## Solution 9: Research and Public Health Infrastructure

### Problem Addressed

Decades of Schedule I restrictions have left significant gaps in scientific understanding of cannabis effects, optimal dosing, impaired driving measurement, and public health best practices.

### Proposals

- **Remove research barriers**: Descheduling or rescheduling would simplify research access. Even before federal action, expand DEA-licensed cannabis research suppliers and streamline approval processes.
- **Federal research funding**: Appropriate $500 million over five years (from cannabis tax revenue) for NIH, NIDA, and FDA research on:
    - Health effects of cannabis use across populations and consumption methods
    - Development of scientifically validated impairment testing for driving enforcement
    - Efficacy of cannabis for medical conditions (pain, PTSD, epilepsy, nausea)
    - Adolescent brain development effects
    - Cannabis potency and health risk relationship
    - Cannabis-drug interactions
- **Real-world evidence**: Establish post-market surveillance systems in legal states to collect data on health outcomes, emergency department visits, and population-level trends.
- **Public health campaigns**: Fund evidence-based public education on responsible use, risks of adolescent use, impaired driving, and cannabis use disorder.
