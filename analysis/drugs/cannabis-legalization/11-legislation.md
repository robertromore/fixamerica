# Cannabis Legalization: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

This document provides draft legislative text for the key federal reforms needed to resolve the contradictions in American cannabis policy. The legislation addresses three core priorities: (1) comprehensive federal descheduling and regulation, (2) financial services access for state-legal businesses, and (3) social equity and criminal record relief. Each bill includes findings, substantive provisions, appropriations, and a loopholes analysis.

These drafts are informed by existing congressional proposals (the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act, the SAFE Banking Act, and the MORE Act) as well as state-level legislative experience from the 24 states that have legalized recreational cannabis.

## Federal Legislation

### Bill 1: The Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act (CAOA)

**Purpose**: Remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act, establish a comprehensive federal regulatory framework, and ensure that legalization addresses the harms of prohibition through social equity and expungement provisions.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Cannabis has been classified as a Schedule I controlled substance
since 1970, a classification that contradicts the scientific evidence
and the judgment of 38 states that have established medical cannabis
programs.
(2) Cannabis prohibition has been enforced in a racially
disproportionate manner, with Black Americans arrested at 3.73 times
the rate of white Americans for cannabis offenses despite comparable
rates of use.
(3) An estimated 15 to 20 million Americans carry criminal records
for cannabis offenses, impeding their employment, housing, education,
and civic participation.
(4) Twenty-four states and the District of Columbia have legalized
adult-use cannabis, representing a population of approximately 170
million people.
(5) The federal illegality of cannabis prevents state-legal
businesses from accessing banking services, deducting ordinary
business expenses, and operating on equal terms with other legal
industries.
(6) The legal cannabis market generated $33.6 billion in sales
and supported approximately 440,000 jobs in 2023.
(7) Seventy percent of Americans support the legalization of
cannabis.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(a) "Cannabis" means all parts of the plant Cannabis sativa L., whether
growing or not, including the seeds, resin, and every compound,
manufacture, salt, derivative, or preparation of the plant, but does
not include hemp as defined in section 297A of the Agricultural Marketing
Act of 1946 (7 U.S.C. 1639o).
(b) "Cannabis product" means any product containing cannabis or cannabis
extracts, including but not limited to flower, concentrates, edibles,
tinctures, and topicals.
(c) "Lawful cannabis-related conduct" means any conduct relating to
cannabis that is lawful under state law.
(d) "Disproportionately impacted area" means a census tract or
comparable geographic area where the cannabis arrest rate or poverty
rate exceeds the state median by 150 percent or more.
(e) "Social equity applicant" means an individual who meets at least
one of the following criteria:
    (1) Has been convicted of a cannabis offense that has been
    or would be eligible for expungement under this Act;

preempt, limit, or otherwise affect any state law that regulates,
restricts, or prohibits the cultivation, production, processing,
distribution, sale, possession, or use of cannabis.

SEC. 5. FEDERAL REGULATORY FRAMEWORK.

SEC. 7. EXPUNGEMENT AND RESENTENCING.

(a) AUTOMATIC EXPUNGEMENT.—Not later than 1 year after the date of
enactment, the Attorney General shall expunge the records of all
individuals convicted of a federal offense for conduct that would be
lawful under this Act, including:
    (1) Simple possession of cannabis in any amount;
    (2) Distribution or cultivation of cannabis in amounts consistent
    with personal use or state-legal activity.
(b) RESENTENCING.—Any individual currently serving a federal sentence
for a cannabis offense may petition the court for resentencing or
release. The court shall grant such petition unless it finds that the
individual poses a significant risk to public safety unrelated to
cannabis.
(c) SENTENCING LIMITATION.—No federal criminal penalty may be imposed
for conduct relating to cannabis that is lawful under the law of the
state in which the conduct occurs.
(d) COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES.—
    (1) No person may be denied federal employment, housing assistance,

```

**Explanation**: This comprehensive bill follows the structure of the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act introduced by Senators Schumer, Booker, and Wyden, with refinements based on state-level experience. Key design choices include: (1) TTB as the primary regulator, leveraging existing alcohol/tobacco regulatory infrastructure; (2) a phased tax rate to avoid over-taxing the nascent legal market; (3) automatic expungement rather than petition-based, which has proven far more effective in reaching affected individuals; (4) a dedicated trust fund to ensure equity provisions are funded; (5) a 3-year delay on interstate commerce to allow developing state markets to mature.

**Potential Challenges**:

- Senate filibuster requires 60 votes or budget reconciliation pathway
- Constitutional questions about federal authority to regulate intrastate cannabis commerce (mitigated by *Gonzales v. Raich* precedent)
- Industry opposition to tax rates, even at moderate levels
- State concerns about federal preemption of existing regulatory frameworks
- International treaty compliance issues

**Refinements**:

- Tax rate could be further reduced in the initial period to accelerate illicit market displacement
- Interstate commerce timeline could be extended to 5 years for additional state market protection
- Appellation and origin protections could be added for craft and legacy cultivators

### Bill 2: The SAFE Banking Act

**Purpose**: Provide a safe harbor for financial institutions serving state-legal cannabis businesses, eliminating the banking crisis without requiring comprehensive federal legalization.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking
Act" or the "SAFE Banking Act".

SEC. 2. SAFE HARBOR FOR DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS.

(a) IN GENERAL.—A federal banking regulator may not:
    (1) Prohibit, penalize, or otherwise discourage a depository
    institution from providing financial services to a covered
    business solely because the business is engaged in lawful
    cannabis-related conduct;
    (2) Terminate or limit the deposit insurance of a depository
    institution solely because it provides financial services to a
    covered business;
    (3) Recommend, incentivize, or encourage a depository
    institution to not offer financial services to a covered
    business solely on the basis of the business being engaged in
    lawful cannabis-related conduct;
    (4) Take any adverse action against a depository institution
    solely for providing financial services to a covered business.
(b) SAFE HARBOR.—A depository institution that provides financial
services to a covered business shall not be held liable under any
federal law solely for providing such services, provided that the
institution complies with applicable state law and the requirements
of this Act.
(c) COVERED BUSINESS DEFINED.—A "covered business" is a cannabis
business that is operating in compliance with applicable state law.

SEC. 3. PROTECTIONS FOR ANCILLARY BUSINESSES.

(a) The protections under Section 2 extend to ancillary businesses,
including landlords, accountants, lawyers, insurers, and service
providers, that provide services to covered businesses.
(b) No person may be penalized under federal law solely for providing
goods, services, or real property to a covered business.

SEC. 4. FINCEN GUIDANCE.

(a) The Director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network shall,
within 180 days of enactment, issue updated guidance for financial
institutions serving cannabis businesses.
(b) The guidance shall include simplified Suspicious Activity Report
filing requirements that reflect the legal status of cannabis
businesses under state law.

SEC. 5. INSURANCE.

Nothing in federal law shall be construed to prohibit an insurer
from providing insurance to a covered business or to a depository
institution that provides financial services to a covered business.

SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**: This bill is modeled on H.R. 2891 (118th Congress), which passed the U.S. House with a 321-101 bipartisan vote. The text provides explicit protections not only for banks and credit unions but also for ancillary businesses (landlords, lawyers, accountants, insurers) that currently face legal risk for serving cannabis companies.

**Potential Challenges**:

- Senate passage remains the primary obstacle
- Some senators prefer to attach banking reform to comprehensive legislation
- Financial institutions may remain cautious even with a safe harbor due to residual federal illegality

---

### Bill 3: The Social Equity and Expungement Act

**Purpose**: Provide comprehensive criminal record relief for cannabis offenses and establish a federal framework for social equity in the cannabis industry.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Cannabis Social Equity and
Expungement Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that:
(1) An estimated 15 to 20 million Americans carry criminal records
for cannabis offenses.
(2) Black Americans have been arrested for cannabis offenses at 3.73
times the rate of white Americans nationally, despite comparable
rates of use.
(3) Cannabis criminal records create barriers to employment, housing,
education, public benefits, immigration status, and civic participation.
(4) Automatic expungement is more effective than petition-based
systems at reaching affected individuals, as petition-based systems
require awareness, legal assistance, and court fees that many cannot
access.
(5) Communities disproportionately impacted by cannabis enforcement
have not equitably shared in the economic benefits of legalization.

SEC. 3. FEDERAL AUTOMATIC EXPUNGEMENT.

(a) SCOPE.—The Attorney General shall, within 1 year of enactment,
expunge all federal cannabis-related convictions and arrests for:
    (1) Simple possession of cannabis;
    (2) Possession with intent to distribute cannabis in amounts of
    1 kilogram or less;
    (3) Cultivation of 100 plants or fewer;
    (4) Any cannabis offense for which the individual has completed
    their sentence, including probation and parole.
(b) PROCESS.—The Attorney General shall:
    (1) Identify all eligible records using the National Crime
    Information Center (NCIC) and other federal databases;
    (2) Automatically expunge eligible records without requiring
    individual petitions;
    (3) Notify affected individuals of their expungement;
    (4) Ensure that expunged records are not disclosed in background
    checks, except to law enforcement agencies for law enforcement
    purposes.

SEC. 4. RESENTENCING AND RELEASE.

(a) Any individual currently serving a federal sentence for a cannabis
offense covered by Section 3 may petition the court for immediate
release or resentencing.
(b) There shall be a presumption in favor of release, which may be
overcome only by a showing that the individual poses a specific, articulable
risk to public safety unrelated to cannabis.

SEC. 5. STATE EXPUNGEMENT INCENTIVE GRANTS.

(a) The Attorney General shall establish a grant program to incentivize
and assist states in implementing automatic cannabis expungement.
(b) Eligible states must commit to:
    (1) Automatic expungement of cannabis possession offenses;
    (2) Resentencing review for cannabis distribution or cultivation
    offenses;
    (3) Notification of affected individuals.
(c) AUTHORIZATION.—There is authorized to be appropriated $250,000,000
over 5 years for state expungement grants.

SEC. 6. COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES.

(a) FEDERAL BENEFITS.—No person shall be denied federal employment,
housing assistance, student financial aid, veterans' benefits,
professional licensing, or other federal benefits solely on the basis
of a cannabis offense.
(b) IMMIGRATION.—No person shall be deemed inadmissible to or deportable
from the United States solely on the basis of cannabis-related conduct
that is lawful in the state where it occurred.
(c) FIREARMS.—An expunged cannabis conviction shall not serve as the
basis for denial of firearms rights under 18 U.S.C. 922(g).

SEC. 7. SOCIAL EQUITY PROGRAM.

(a) FEDERAL SOCIAL EQUITY OFFICE.—There is established within the
Department of Commerce a Cannabis Social Equity Office to:
    (1) Develop and administer federal social equity standards;
    (2) Provide technical assistance to states and municipalities;
    (3) Administer the Social Equity Fund.
(b) SOCIAL EQUITY FUND.—There is established the Cannabis Social Equity
Fund, funded at $200,000,000 annually for 5 years, to provide:
    (1) Low-interest loans and grants to social equity cannabis
    businesses;
    (2) Business incubation and technical assistance;
    (3) Legal services for licensing and compliance;
    (4) Workforce development in disproportionately impacted
    communities.

SEC. 8. REPORTING.

The Attorney General and the Secretary of Commerce shall jointly
submit an annual report to Congress on:
(a) The number of records expunged;
(b) The number of individuals resentenced or released;
(c) The amount and allocation of Social Equity Fund disbursements;
(d) Demographic data on social equity program participation;
(e) Metrics on employment, housing, and economic outcomes for
expungement recipients.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**: This bill addresses both backward-looking justice (expungement and resentencing) and forward-looking equity (social equity programs and collateral consequence removal). The automatic expungement mechanism is modeled on the Illinois and California approaches, which have proven far more effective at reaching affected individuals than petition-based systems.

---

## State Model Legislation

### Model Cannabis Social Equity Licensing Act

**Purpose**: Provide states with a template for social equity provisions in cannabis licensing.

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "[State] Cannabis Social Equity
Licensing Act".

SECTION 2. DEFINITIONS.

(a) "Social equity applicant" means an individual who:
    (1) Has been convicted of a cannabis offense in this state;
    (2) Is a resident of a disproportionately impacted area as
    determined by the [regulatory agency] based on arrest rate,
    poverty rate, and unemployment data; or
    (3) Has a parent, guardian, child, sibling, or spouse who
    has been convicted of a cannabis offense.
(b) "Disproportionately impacted area" means a census tract where
the cannabis arrest rate or poverty rate exceeds the statewide
median by 150 percent or more.

SECTION 3. SOCIAL EQUITY LICENSE ALLOCATION.

(a) Not less than 30 percent of all cannabis licenses issued under
this Act shall be designated as social equity licenses.
(b) Social equity licenses shall receive:
    (1) Reduced application fees (not to exceed 25 percent of the
    standard fee);
    (2) Priority review and processing;
    (3) Access to the Social Equity Technical Assistance Program.

SECTION 4. ANTI-TRANSFER PROTECTIONS.

(a) A social equity license may not be sold, transferred, or assigned
to a non-social equity entity within the first 5 years of issuance.
(b) Any management or consulting agreement that transfers effective
control of a social equity-licensed business to a non-equity entity
shall be void as against public policy.

SECTION 5. COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT.

(a) Not less than 25 percent of cannabis tax revenue collected under
[applicable tax provision] shall be deposited in the Community
Reinvestment Fund.
(b) The Fund shall support programs in disproportionately impacted
areas, including education, job training, healthcare, housing, and
small business development.
```

**Adaptations**: States should customize the social equity applicant definition, license allocation percentage, and anti-transfer protections based on local conditions, demographics, and existing regulatory frameworks.

---

## Regulatory Framework

### Federal Cannabis Advertising Regulations

**Existing Authority**: Upon descheduling, regulatory authority would be established by the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act (above) and implemented by TTB and FDA.

**Draft Regulation**:

Cannabis advertising shall comply with the following requirements:

1. No advertising shall target persons under 21 years of age.
2. No advertising shall appear in media where more than 15 percent of the audience is under 21.
3. All advertising shall include the following health warning: "WARNING: Cannabis use during pregnancy may harm your baby. Keep cannabis products away from children."
4. No advertising shall make health claims unless approved by the FDA.
5. No advertising shall feature cartoon characters, celebrities under 21, or imagery primarily appealing to minors.
6. Point-of-sale advertising in retail locations is permitted.
7. Digital advertising must use age-gating mechanisms.

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

- **Commerce Clause**: *Gonzales v. Raich* (2005) established that Congress has authority to regulate cannabis under the Commerce Clause, even for purely intrastate activity. Federal descheduling and regulation would be on strong constitutional footing.
- **Tenth Amendment**: The preservation of state authority to prohibit or regulate cannabis within their borders addresses federalism concerns.
- **First Amendment**: Advertising restrictions must comply with the *Central Hudson* commercial speech test. The restrictions proposed above are narrowly tailored to the substantial government interest of protecting youth.

### Preemption Questions

- The CAOA explicitly preserves state regulatory authority, avoiding preemption of existing state programs.
- States may set stricter but not less strict standards than federal requirements.
- Local governments' authority to prohibit or zone cannabis businesses is preserved.

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- TTB enforcement through licensing compliance, inspections, and civil penalties (modeled on alcohol enforcement)
- FDA enforcement of health claims and product safety through existing authority
- DOJ enforcement of age restrictions, advertising violations, and illicit market operations
- State enforcement of intrastate regulations

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Corporate capture of equity licenses | MSOs may use management agreements, loans, or predatory partnerships to gain effective control of social equity licenses | Critical |
| Interstate commerce displacement | When interstate commerce opens (Year 3), small operators in high-cost states may be displaced by lower-cost producers | High |
| Tax avoidance through hemp reclassification | Producers may attempt to classify high-THC products as hemp derivatives to avoid cannabis excise taxes | Medium |
| State opt-out as de facto prohibition | States may use opt-out provisions to maintain prohibition indefinitely, leaving residents without access | Medium |
| Under-enforcement of advertising restrictions | Digital advertising platforms may be difficult to regulate, allowing targeted advertising that reaches youth | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| No federal impaired driving standard | Inconsistent enforcement across states; no validated testing tool | Scientific limitations of current THC impairment measurement |
| Insufficient social equity funding | $100M/year SBA allocation may be inadequate for national scale | Political constraints on appropriations |
| No potency limits | Very high-potency products (90%+ THC concentrates) remain unregulated at federal level | Insufficient evidence base for specific limits; industry opposition |
| Treaty conflict unresolved | U.S. remains technically in violation of 1961 Single Convention | Diplomatic complexity of treaty modification |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Anti-capture provisions**: Strengthen social equity license protections by (a) prohibiting management agreements that transfer more than 25% of equity or revenue; (b) requiring annual ownership audits; (c) creating a complaint mechanism for equity licensees experiencing predatory practices.
2. **Interstate commerce transition**: Extend the interstate commerce delay to 5 years; establish appellation and origin protections; create a small farmer transition fund.
3. **Hemp-cannabis boundary**: Clarify that products marketed for psychoactive effect are subject to cannabis regulation regardless of technical THC concentration.
4. **Impaired driving**: Fund a $50 million NHTSA research program to develop validated impairment testing within 5 years.
5. **Potency**: Direct the Surgeon General to issue a report on cannabis potency and health within 2 years, with regulatory recommendations.

### SAFE Banking Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Narrow safe harbor | Banks may interpret the safe harbor narrowly and continue to deny services based on residual federal illegality concerns | Medium |
| Money laundering exception | The safe harbor does not protect against money laundering prosecutions if cannabis proceeds are commingled with illicit funds | Medium |
| SBA and bankruptcy exclusion | SAFE Banking does not address SBA loan eligibility or bankruptcy protection | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Does not address underlying illegality | Cannabis businesses remain federally criminal enterprises; banking is the only protection | Incrementalism -- full reform requires separate legislation |
| Does not address 280E | Tax burden remains regardless of banking access | Section 280E requires separate legislative action or rescheduling |
| Major banks may delay entry | Even with safe harbor, large institutions may wait for full legalization | Risk aversion and compliance culture at major banks |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Include explicit language that banking services include SBA lending eligibility.
2. Add a provision clarifying that compliance with state law and SAFE Banking requirements creates a presumption against money laundering prosecution.
3. Pair SAFE Banking with 280E relief legislation to address both financial access and tax burden simultaneously.

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| Federal regulatory capacity | Appropriate adequate funding for TTB/FDA cannabis regulatory programs; hire experienced state cannabis regulators |
| State-federal coordination | Establish formal intergovernmental coordination mechanisms; recognize state licenses as meeting federal requirements |
| Industry consolidation | Include antitrust provisions limiting single-entity market share; protect small business access |
| Data collection | Mandate standardized data collection across states for public health monitoring |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

- The Cannabis Opportunity Trust Fund and Social Equity Fund authorizations should be reviewed and reauthorized every 5 years.
- The federal excise tax rate should be reviewed every 3 years and adjusted to maintain competitiveness with the illicit market.
- The Surgeon General should issue a comprehensive report on the public health effects of legalization every 5 years.
- GAO should conduct a study of social equity program effectiveness within 3 years of enactment.
