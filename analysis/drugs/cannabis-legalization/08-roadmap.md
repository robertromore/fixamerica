# Cannabis Legalization: Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines a phased approach to comprehensive cannabis policy reform in the United States. Given the current political landscape -- supermajority public support for legalization, a Biden-initiated rescheduling process, repeated bipartisan House passage of banking reform, but Senate gridlock on comprehensive legislation -- the roadmap is designed to achieve incremental progress in the near term while building toward comprehensive federal legalization.

The phases are not strictly sequential; multiple tracks can and should advance simultaneously.

## State-Level Roadmap

Parallel to federal action, state-level reform continues to be essential.

### States Most Likely to Legalize Next (2024-2026)
