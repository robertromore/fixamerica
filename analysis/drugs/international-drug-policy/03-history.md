# International Drug Policy: History

## Historical Development

International drug control has evolved from nineteenth-century colonial trade disputes into a global prohibitionist framework led by the United States. This history is shaped by great-power politics, moral entrepreneurship, Cold War strategy, and the cascading consequences of policies that prioritized enforcement over public health. Understanding this trajectory is essential for evaluating current reform proposals.

### The Origins of International Drug Control (1839-1914): Colonial Trade and Moral Reform

- **The Opium Wars (1839-1842, 1856-1860)**: Britain fought two wars to force China to accept opium imports from British India. The resulting treaties established a precedent: drugs were instruments of trade and geopolitical power. China's devastating opium addiction crisis -- affecting an estimated 13.5 million users by 1906 -- became a rallying cause for international regulation.
- **The Shanghai Opium Commission (1909)**: Convened at U.S. initiative, this was the first multilateral meeting on drug control. The United States, which had recently acquired the Philippines and confronted opium use there, pushed for international controls. The commission produced non-binding recommendations but established the principle of multilateral drug regulation.
- **The Hague International Opium Convention (1912)**: The first binding international drug control treaty, requiring signatories to limit opium, morphine, and cocaine to medical and scientific purposes. Ratification was slow; the treaty was attached to the Treaty of Versailles (1919) to compel broader adoption.
- **American Moral Entrepreneurship**: U.S. diplomats, particularly Bishop Charles Brent and Dr. Hamilton Wright, drove the early international drug control movement, framing drug use as a moral and racial threat. Wright explicitly linked opium to Chinese immigrants and cocaine to Black Americans in Congressional testimony, embedding racial politics into the foundations of international drug control.

### The League of Nations Era (1920-1945): Institutionalization

- **The Advisory Committee on Traffic in Opium (1920)**: The League of Nations created the first permanent international drug control body, which conducted surveys, drafted conventions, and monitored compliance.
- **The 1925 Geneva Conventions**: Two conventions expanded controls to cannabis (at Egypt's insistence) and established the Permanent Central Board to monitor drug trade statistics. Cannabis was added with minimal scientific evidence, based primarily on Egyptian and South African delegates' moral objections.
- **The 1931 Limitation Convention**: Introduced a system of estimates and quotas to limit drug manufacture to quantities needed for medical and scientific purposes, establishing the supply-control paradigm that persists today.
- **The 1936 Convention for the Suppression of Illicit Traffic**: The first treaty focused specifically on criminal enforcement, though it was weakly ratified due to World War II.

### Building the Modern Framework (1946-1970): The Single Convention and U.S. Dominance

- **Transfer to the United Nations (1946)**: Drug control functions moved from the League of Nations to the UN, with the Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) established as the central policy body and the Division of Narcotic Drugs as the secretariat.
- **Harry Anslinger's Influence (1930-1962)**: As head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics for 32 years, Anslinger dominated both U.S. and international drug policy. He promoted a strict prohibitionist approach, personally represented the U.S. at CND meetings, and used diplomatic pressure to ensure that international drug control reflected American enforcement priorities.
- **The 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs**: The foundational treaty of the modern system, consolidating earlier agreements into a single framework. Key features:
    - Established four schedules classifying drugs by medical utility and abuse potential
    - Required parties to limit drug production and trade to medical and scientific purposes
    - Created the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) to monitor compliance
    - Included provisions (Article 49) requiring elimination of quasi-traditional uses of cannabis, coca, and opium within 25 years -- a provision that directly targeted indigenous practices in South America, South Asia, and Africa
    - Permitted parties to adopt measures they deemed necessary for domestic implementation, language later cited by reformers
- **The 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances**: Extended controls to synthetic and psychotropic drugs (amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, psychedelics). Notably weaker than the 1961 convention due to lobbying by pharmaceutical companies based in developed countries, which successfully limited controls on commercially profitable psychotropics while maintaining strict prohibitions on plant-based drugs used in developing nations.

### The War on Drugs Goes Global (1971-1999): Militarization and the 1988 Convention

- **Nixon's Declaration (1971)**: President Nixon declared drug abuse "public enemy number one" and created the Special Action Office for Drug Abuse Prevention. While Nixon initially invested in treatment (including methadone programs), the enforcement apparatus expanded rapidly.
- **The 1988 Convention against Illicit Traffic**: The third and most enforcement-oriented convention, adopted amid the crack cocaine crisis and escalating U.S. drug war rhetoric. Key provisions:
    - Required criminalization of drug production, distribution, and trafficking
    - Article 3(2) called for criminalization of personal drug possession (with the constitutional principles caveat)
    - Established frameworks for asset seizure, extradition, and mutual legal assistance
    - Introduced precursor chemical controls
    - Made money laundering from drug trafficking a criminal offense
- **The Certification Process (1986)**: The U.S. Anti-Drug Abuse Act established an annual certification process requiring the President to certify that major drug-producing countries were cooperating with U.S. anti-drug efforts, with aid sanctions for decertified nations. This unilateral tool generated significant resentment in Latin America.
- **Andean Strategy and Plan Colombia Origins (1989-1999)**: President George H.W. Bush launched the Andean Initiative in 1989, directing military assistance and interdiction resources to Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia. The Clinton administration expanded this approach, culminating in Plan Colombia (2000), a $1.3 billion initial package focused primarily on military and police assistance.
- **Eradication Campaigns**: The U.S. funded aerial spraying of coca fields with glyphosate in Colombia (beginning in the 1990s), manual eradication in Peru and Bolivia, and opium poppy eradication in Afghanistan and Southeast Asia. These programs destroyed crops but failed to reduce aggregate production, as cultivation shifted to new areas (the "balloon effect").

### Plan Colombia and Its Aftermath (2000-2015): The Apex of Supply-Side Diplomacy

- **Plan Colombia (2000-2016)**: The United States invested $10 billion over 16 years, making Colombia the third-largest recipient of U.S. foreign assistance globally. The program:
    - Provided Black Hawk helicopters, training, and intelligence to the Colombian military and police
    - Funded aerial glyphosate spraying of over 1.6 million hectares of coca (cumulative)
    - Supported the creation of elite counter-narcotics units
    - Reduced coca cultivation temporarily from 163,000 hectares (2000) to 78,000 hectares (2012), but cultivation rebounded to 230,000 hectares by 2022 -- far exceeding pre-Plan Colombia levels
    - Was associated with human rights abuses, including the "false positives" scandal in which Colombian military units killed at least 6,402 civilians and dressed them as guerrilla fighters to inflate body counts
- **The Merida Initiative (2008-2021)**: The United States committed $3.5+ billion to Mexico for counter-narcotics equipment, training, and institutional reform. The program coincided with an explosion of drug violence following President Calderon's 2006 military offensive against cartels, with over 400,000 drug-related homicides in Mexico since 2006.
- **Afghanistan Counter-narcotics (2001-2021)**: The U.S. spent $9+ billion on Afghan drug control, including eradication, alternative livelihoods, interdiction, and public information campaigns. A 2019 SIGAR report described the program as a "failure," noting that opium production increased from 185 metric tons (2001) to over 6,800 metric tons (2017) during the U.S. presence.
- **The Balloon Effect**: A consistent pattern across all major supply-side programs: reducing production in one area causes it to shift to another. Coca moved between Peru, Bolivia, and Colombia. Opium shifted between Afghanistan and Myanmar. Methamphetamine production moved from the U.S. to Mexico. This effect has been documented by UNODC, RAND, and the Congressional Research Service.

### Reform Emergence (2001-Present): Cracks in the Consensus

- **Portugal's Decriminalization (2001)**: Portugal decriminalized personal possession of all drugs, replacing criminal penalties with administrative "Dissuasion Commissions." The reform was accompanied by major investment in treatment infrastructure. Drug-related deaths, HIV infections among people who inject drugs, and drug-related incarceration all declined significantly.
- **Latin American Reform Declarations**: Former presidents Fernando Henrique Cardoso (Brazil), Ernesto Zedillo (Mexico), and Cesar Gaviria (Colombia) published a joint declaration in 2009 calling the War on Drugs a failure. This led to the formation of the Global Commission on Drug Policy (2011), which advocated for decriminalization and regulated markets.
- **The 2012 Cartagena Summit**: At the Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, multiple Latin American leaders confronted President Obama over the failure of the War on Drugs. The OAS was tasked with producing a report exploring alternatives, which was published in 2013 as "The Drug Problem in the Americas."
- **Uruguay Cannabis Legalization (2013)**: Uruguay became the first country to legalize recreational cannabis, establishing a state-regulated market with three access channels (pharmacies, cannabis clubs, and home cultivation).
- **Canada Cannabis Act (2018)**: Canada became the first G7 nation to legalize recreational cannabis at the national level, creating a federal regulatory framework with provincial implementation.
- **2016 UNGASS on Drugs**: The UN General Assembly Special Session on the World Drug Problem was convened at the request of Mexico, Colombia, and Guatemala. While the outcome document fell short of treaty reform -- blocked by Russia, China, and several Asian and Middle Eastern states -- it opened political space by acknowledging the importance of "health-oriented" approaches and "proportionate sentencing."
- **Germany Cannabis Legalization (2024)**: Germany became the first large EU member state to legalize recreational cannabis, permitting personal use, home growing, and cannabis social clubs.

## Lessons from History

### Pattern 1: The Balloon Effect -- Supply Disruption Without Demand Reduction is Futile

Every major supply-side program has produced the same result: temporary local reductions followed by displacement to new areas and eventual recovery of production. Coca moved between Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia. Opium shifted between Afghanistan and Myanmar. Methamphetamine production migrated from domestic U.S. labs to Mexican super-labs. The fundamental driver -- consumer demand in wealthy nations -- remains unaddressed by supply-side interventions.

### Pattern 2: Prohibition Generates Violence and Institutional Corruption

When drug markets are pushed underground by prohibition, they are governed by violence rather than contract law. The pattern repeats across decades and continents: Colombia's cartels in the 1980s-1990s, Mexico's cartels since 2006, the heroin trade in Afghanistan, and trafficking routes through West Africa. Prohibition concentrates enormous profits in criminal organizations, which then corrupt police, judges, politicians, and military officers.

### Pattern 3: Treaty Frameworks Reflect Power, Not Evidence

The international drug control framework was shaped more by geopolitical power than by scientific evidence. Cannabis was scheduled internationally in 1925 based on Egyptian and South African moral objections, not pharmacological research. The 1971 Convention applied weaker controls to synthetic drugs manufactured by Western pharmaceutical companies than to plant-based drugs produced in the Global South. The 1988 Convention's enforcement mandate reflected Reagan-era U.S. drug war ideology. Reforming this framework requires confronting its political origins.

### Pattern 4: Reform Success Requires Health System Investment

Portugal's decriminalization succeeded not simply because it removed criminal penalties but because it simultaneously invested in treatment, harm reduction, and social services. Countries that decriminalize without building health infrastructure -- as Oregon's Measure 110 arguably attempted -- face challenges. The lesson is that legal reform and health system investment must proceed together.
