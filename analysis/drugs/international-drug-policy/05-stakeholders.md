# International Drug Policy: Stakeholders

The international drug control system is shaped by the interactions of multilateral institutions, national governments, law enforcement agencies, advocacy organizations, and affected populations, each with distinct interests, resources, and influence.

## Who Is Affected

### Primary Stakeholders

| Group | Impact | Size | Key Interests |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|
| Drug crop farmers (coca, opium, cannabis) | Livelihoods destroyed by eradication; criminalized for poverty-driven cultivation | ~6 million farmers globally (UNODC estimate) | Economic survival, land rights, legal alternatives |
| People who use drugs (globally) | Criminalized, incarcerated, denied treatment; overdose and disease risk | ~296 million (UNODC World Drug Report, 2024) | Access to treatment, harm reduction, decriminalization |
| Communities in producer/transit countries | Drug violence, corruption, displacement, institutional erosion | Tens of millions across Latin America, West Africa, Southeast Asia | Security, governance, economic opportunity |
| Indigenous populations | Traditional practices (coca, cannabis, peyote, ayahuasca) criminalized by treaties | Hundreds of millions globally; Bolivia alone has 4+ million coca-chewing population | Cultural rights, sovereignty, treaty reform |
| Victims of drug violence | Homicides, kidnapping, extortion, forced displacement | 400,000+ killed in Mexico since 2006; 260,000+ disappeared in Colombia | Justice, security, reparations |

### Secondary Stakeholders

- **U.S. taxpayers**: Fund $5.5 billion/year (FY2024) in international drug control with limited evidence of effectiveness
- **Health workers and researchers**: Constrained by scheduling barriers that limit drug research; health-based approaches underfunded
- **Legal cannabis industries**: Canadian and Uruguayan legal markets face international trade barriers due to treaty framework
- **Migrants and refugees**: Drug violence is a primary driver of migration from Central America, Mexico, and Colombia, creating humanitarian and political consequences in the United States

## Who Has Power

### Decision Makers

| Actor | Role | Authority | Resources | Influence Level |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| U.S. President and National Security Council | Sets international drug policy priorities | Executive authority over diplomacy, military, intelligence | $5.5 billion/year international drug budget | High |
| U.S. Congress (Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, Appropriations Committees) | Authorizes and funds programs; conducts oversight | Legislative authority, appropriations power | Controls all U.S. drug spending | High |
| Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) | Primary UN drug policy body; schedules substances | Policy resolutions; scheduling decisions | Part of UNODC budget | High (formal) |
| International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) | Treaty compliance monitoring | Quasi-judicial review; public criticism of non-compliance | ~$7 million via UNODC | Medium (moral/reputational) |
| UNODC Executive Director | Leads UN drug control operations | Research, technical assistance, norm-setting | ~$410 million annual budget | Medium |
| WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence | Scientific scheduling recommendations | Recommends scheduling to CND based on health evidence | Limited (expert body) | Medium (scientific authority) |

### Key Organizations and Institutions

- **U.S. State Department Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL)**: Manages the largest bilateral drug control portfolio in the world ($1.56 billion FY2024). Funds counter-narcotics police training, judicial reform, eradication programs, and alternative development in over 90 countries. INL's orientation has traditionally been enforcement-first, though it has gradually incorporated development elements.
- **U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)**: Operates 93 foreign offices in 69 countries. Conducts investigations, intelligence gathering, and capacity building for foreign law enforcement. DEA has resisted reform efforts and maintains a strong institutional commitment to the prohibition paradigm.
- **U.S. Department of Defense**: DOD counter-narcotics programs (~$1.2 billion FY2024) fund detection and monitoring, military training for partner nations, and equipment transfers. Counter-narcotics authority has been used to build military relationships in Latin America that serve broader strategic objectives.
- **U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)**: Manages alternative development and governance programs in drug-producing regions (~$350 million FY2024). USAID programs are generally more development-oriented than INL or DOD programs but receive a smaller share of funding.
- **European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA/EUDA)**: The EU's drug policy research agency, providing data-driven analysis that supports evidence-based approaches. Has become increasingly influential in shaping European drug policy toward harm reduction.

### Influencers

- **Global Commission on Drug Policy**: Founded in 2011, includes former presidents of Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Switzerland, and Portugal, plus Kofi Annan, Richard Branson, and other public figures. Has published influential reports calling for decriminalization, harm reduction, and regulated markets. Has no formal authority but significant media and political influence.
- **Drug Policy Alliance (DPA)**: The largest U.S.-based drug policy reform organization ($20+ million annual budget). Funds advocacy, litigation, and ballot initiatives. Has driven cannabis legalization and harm reduction expansion in U.S. states.
- **Transform Drug Policy Foundation**: UK-based organization producing detailed policy analyses and model regulatory frameworks. Published influential "After the War on Drugs" blueprint.
- **International Drug Policy Consortium (IDPC)**: Network of 192 organizations in 70+ countries advocating for evidence-based drug policies. Coordinates civil society engagement with UN drug policy processes.
- **Transnational Institute (TNI)**: Amsterdam-based research organization providing analysis on drug policy reform, particularly regarding treaty flexibility and Latin American perspectives.
- **Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA)**: Monitors U.S. policy in Latin America, including drug policy. Produces influential analyses of Plan Colombia, Merida Initiative, and human rights impacts.

## Stakeholder Interests and Alignment

### Aligned Interests (Potential Coalition Partners)

| Coalition | Shared Interest | Strength |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Latin American reformist governments + Global Commission + IDPC | Ending prohibition-driven violence; treaty flexibility | Strong (shared experience and values) |
| Public health community + harm reduction NGOs + WHO | Prioritizing health outcomes over enforcement metrics | Strong (evidence-based consensus) |
| Libertarian/civil liberties groups + progressive reformers | Individual autonomy; ending criminalization | Moderate (different underlying philosophy) |
| U.S. fiscal conservatives + reform advocates | Reducing wasteful international drug spending | Moderate (potential but underdeveloped) |
| Legal cannabis industries (Canada, Uruguay, U.S. states) + trade advocates | Treaty modernization to enable legal international cannabis trade | Growing (economic interest aligning with reform) |

### Conflicting Interests

- **U.S. enforcement agencies vs. reform advocates**: DEA, INL, and DOD counter-narcotics programs are institutionally committed to supply-side enforcement. Reform advocates seek to rebalance funding toward health and development. This is the central conflict in U.S. international drug policy.
- **INCB vs. legalizing nations**: The INCB views cannabis legalization as a treaty violation. Canada, Uruguay, and Germany assert that their reforms are consistent with treaty obligations or that health protection justifies departure. The INCB has no enforcement mechanism, making this a reputational rather than legal conflict.
- **Producer-country governments vs. U.S. pressure**: Colombia, Bolivia, and Mexico face U.S. pressure to maintain eradication and enforcement programs that their own populations increasingly oppose. These governments must balance sovereignty, domestic politics, and the economic leverage the U.S. holds through aid and trade.
- **Pharmaceutical industry vs. traditional use advocates**: Pharmaceutical companies benefit from strict scheduling that limits competition from natural substances (cannabis, psilocybin, coca). Indigenous communities seek protection for traditional practices that the treaty framework criminalizes.

### The Supply-Side Iron Triangle

The most entrenched power structure in international drug policy is the triangle connecting:

1. **U.S. enforcement agencies** (DEA, INL, DOD counter-narcotics) that depend on supply-side programs for budgets and institutional identity
2. **Defense and security contractors** that supply helicopters, surveillance equipment, weapons, and training services for counter-narcotics programs
3. **Congressional committees** (Judiciary, Armed Services, Foreign Affairs) whose members receive campaign contributions from defense contractors and political support from law enforcement unions

This triangle ensures continued funding for supply-side programs even when evaluations show they are not achieving their stated objectives. Breaking this triangle requires building an alternative constituency around health outcomes, fiscal responsibility, and human rights.

## Influence Mechanisms

How stakeholders exert influence on international drug policy:

- **Lobbying**: Defense contractors (Lockheed Martin, Bell Helicopter/Textron, Raytheon) lobby Congress for counter-narcotics equipment sales. The pharmaceutical industry lobbies to maintain scheduling restrictions on competing substances. Law enforcement unions lobby against decriminalization.
- **Diplomatic Pressure**: The United States uses aid conditions, trade negotiations, and the annual certification process to pressure partner nations on drug policy. The INCB uses public criticism to pressure reforming nations. The EU uses development aid conditions to promote harm reduction.
- **Public Advocacy**: The Global Commission and reform organizations use media, reports, and public campaigns to shift public opinion. Counter-narcotics agencies use seizure announcements and threat briefings to justify continued funding.
- **Expertise/Information**: UNODC and EMCDDA/EUDA shape the evidence base through research publications. The DEA and ONDCP produce competing analyses emphasizing enforcement successes. Think tanks (RAND, Brookings, WOLA, TNI) provide independent analysis.
- **Campaign Contributions**: In the U.S., defense contractors contributed $32.4 million to Congressional candidates in the 2022 cycle (OpenSecrets). Drug policy reform organizations contributed significantly less but have been effective through ballot initiatives in states where direct democracy bypasses legislative gatekeepers.
