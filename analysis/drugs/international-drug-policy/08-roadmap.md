# International Drug Policy: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

Reform of U.S. international drug policy proceeds in three phases: foundation-building (executive action, diplomatic signaling, pilot programs), structural reform (Congressional reauthorization, new funding streams, treaty modernization), and systemic transformation (full spending rebalance, treaty reform, alternative development at scale). Each phase builds on the previous one, creating political space and evidentiary support for progressively more ambitious reforms. The strategy prioritizes executive branch actions that can proceed without Congressional approval in Phase 1, while building the political coalition needed for legislative action in Phase 2.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation and Signaling (Years 1-2)

### Objectives

- Signal a new U.S. approach to international drug policy through executive action and diplomatic engagement
- Launch pilot programs that generate evidence for expanded reforms
- Begin replacing unilateral certification with cooperative frameworks
- Build the interagency and international coalition for Phase 2

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Issue ONDCP strategy revision prioritizing health outcomes in international programs | ONDCP/NSC | Months 1-6 | Staff time; interagency coordination | Strategy published with new metrics |
| Launch diplomatic initiative for flexible treaty interpretation at CND | State Department | Months 3-12 | Diplomatic engagement; legal analysis ($5-10M) | Coalition of 15+ nations endorsing flexibility |
| Begin bilateral negotiations to replace certification process | State/INL | Months 6-18 | Negotiation teams; $2-3M | First 3-5 cooperative agreements signed |
| Launch pilot international harm reduction programs in 5 countries | USAID/State | Months 6-24 | $50M initial allocation | Programs operational in 5 high-burden countries |
| Commission independent evaluation of all international drug programs | ONDCP/GAO | Months 1-12 | $10-15M evaluation contracts | Comprehensive evaluation completed |
| Establish interagency working group on precursor chemical diplomacy | NSC/State/DEA | Months 1-6 | Staff time | Working group operational with action plan |

### Legislative Requirements

- No new legislation required for Phase 1 -- all actions within existing executive authority
- Congressional notification required for budget reprogramming above $1M
- Begin informal Congressional engagement to prepare for Phase 2 legislation

### Expected Outcomes

Phase 1 establishes the policy foundation through executive action: a revised ONDCP strategy, a diplomatic coalition at the CND, pilot harm reduction programs generating evidence, and the beginning of a shift from certification to cooperation. These actions create political space and evidentiary support for the Congressional action required in Phase 2.

---

## Phase 2: Structural Reform (Years 3-5)

### Objectives

- Achieve Congressional reauthorization of international drug programs with new allocation mandates
- Establish the Global Drug Harm Reduction Initiative
- Triple alternative development funding
- Launch multilateral fentanyl precursor control negotiations
- Formalize cooperative bilateral agreements replacing certification

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Congressional reauthorization of INL programs with 60/40 demand/supply mandate | Congress (Foreign Affairs/Appropriations) | Years 3-4 | Legislative effort; coalition support | Signed legislation |
| Establish Global Drug Harm Reduction Initiative (PEPFAR model) | Congress/USAID | Years 3-4 | $500M/year authorization | Initiative operational in 15+ countries |
| Triple USAID alternative development funding | Congress/USAID | Years 3-5 | $1B/year (up from $350M) | Expanded programs in all major producer countries |
| Negotiate multilateral fentanyl precursor control agreement | State Department | Years 3-5 | $50-100M negotiation/implementation | Treaty text agreed among major parties |
| Complete bilateral cooperative agreements replacing certification | State/INL | Years 3-5 | Diplomatic resources | Agreements with all 22 certified countries |
| Scale pilot harm reduction programs based on evaluation results | USAID/State | Years 3-5 | $200-300M additional | Evidence-based program expansion |
| Co-sponsor CND resolution affirming national discretion in drug policy | State Department | Year 4-5 | Diplomatic engagement | Resolution adopted by CND |

### Legislative Requirements

- Reauthorization of INL programs with allocation mandates (requires new legislation)
- Global Drug Harm Reduction Initiative Act (new legislation, modeled on PEPFAR reauthorization)
- Appropriations increases for USAID alternative development
- Repeal of certification requirements in the Foreign Assistance Act

### Expected Outcomes

Phase 2 institutionalizes reform through legislation: Congressional mandates for spending rebalancing, a dedicated harm reduction initiative, expanded alternative development, and the replacement of certification with cooperative frameworks. The fentanyl precursor agreement addresses the most urgent synthetic drug challenge. A CND resolution affirms the legitimacy of diverse national approaches.

## Phase 3: Systemic Transformation (Years 6-10)

### Objectives

- Complete the transition to 60/40 demand/supply spending balance
- Achieve measurable reductions in drug violence and cultivation in partner countries
- Establish an international track record of evidence-based reform success
- Support formal treaty modernization or inter se modification

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Complete spending rebalance to 60/40 demand/supply | ONDCP/OMB | Years 6-7 | Budget authority | Verified 60/40 allocation |
| Scale alternative development to full coverage in major producer regions | USAID | Years 6-10 | $1B+/year sustained | Measurable cultivation reduction |
| Operationalize fentanyl precursor control agreement | State/International body | Years 6-8 | $200-300M/year | Inspection regime operational |
| Support inter se treaty modification among willing nations | State Department | Years 7-10 | Diplomatic effort | Agreement among 30+ nations |
| Publish comprehensive 10-year evaluation of reform outcomes | ONDCP/GAO | Year 10 | $15-20M evaluation | Report published with data |

### Expected Outcomes

Phase 3 completes the transformation: a fully rebalanced international drug budget, measurable declines in drug violence and cultivation in partner countries, an operational precursor control regime, and formal or informal treaty modernization. The 10-year evaluation provides the evidence base for sustained policy and identifies areas for further reform.

## Governance and Oversight

- **ONDCP**: Primary coordination responsibility for interagency international drug policy; publishes annual progress reports against roadmap metrics
- **Congressional Oversight**: Foreign Affairs and Appropriations Committees conduct biannual hearings on reform implementation; GAO conducts independent evaluations
- **Interagency Review Board**: New body comprising representatives from State, USAID, DEA, DOD, HHS, and ONDCP meets quarterly to review program performance and resolve disputes
- **Independent Evaluation**: GAO and contracted independent evaluators produce biennial assessments of all programs against health and development outcome metrics (replacing enforcement-activity metrics)
- **International Accountability**: Annual reports to CND on U.S. reform progress; peer review by partner nations

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Congressional Resistance to Spending Rebalancing

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Build bipartisan coalition around fiscal waste narrative ($5.5 billion/year with no supply reduction); enlist fiscal conservatives who oppose ineffective government spending; present independent evaluations showing enforcement program failures; engage state-level leaders from cannabis-legal states.

**Contingency Plan**: If Congressional reauthorization stalls, maximize executive branch reprogramming authority; use pilot program results to build case; seek bipartisan champions (historically, drug policy reform has attracted libertarian-conservative and progressive-liberal coalitions).

### Risk 2: Diplomatic Backlash from Prohibitionist Nations

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Frame reform as enabling national discretion, not imposing a model; maintain strong enforcement against transnational trafficking; engage Russia and China on shared fentanyl concerns; build reformist coalition to outnumber prohibitionist bloc at CND.

**Contingency Plan**: If CND resolution fails, pursue reform through bilateral agreements and inter se modification without formal CND endorsement; cite precedent of cannabis-legalizing nations operating outside strict treaty compliance without sanction.

### Risk 3: Escalation of Drug Violence During Transition

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Maintain enforcement against major trafficking organizations during transition; target financial networks rather than agricultural supply chains; support partner-country institutional strengthening; phase transition gradually to avoid destabilizing existing security arrangements.

**Contingency Plan**: If violence escalates in specific countries, provide emergency security assistance while maintaining long-term reform trajectory; adapt country-specific programs to local conditions; avoid reverting to failed enforcement-only approaches.

### Risk 4: China Refuses Meaningful Fentanyl Precursor Cooperation

**Likelihood**: Medium-High

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Embed precursor cooperation in broader U.S.-China diplomatic framework; offer reciprocal concessions in areas China values; build multilateral pressure through allies; develop alternative supply chain monitoring capabilities using AI and financial intelligence.

**Contingency Plan**: If bilateral negotiations fail, pursue multilateral precursor agreement without China; invest in border detection technology; focus on domestic demand reduction to limit the market for fentanyl; work with India and other alternative precursor sources.

### Risk 5: Alternative Development Programs Fail to Reduce Cultivation

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Apply lessons from Thailand and UNODC best practices; ensure programs address market access and infrastructure (not just crop substitution); provide multi-year guaranteed purchase agreements; involve communities in program design; sequence development before eradication.

**Contingency Plan**: If specific programs underperform, conduct rapid evaluations and redesign; accept that transition from drug crops takes 10-15 years (as it did in Thailand); maintain realistic expectations and communicate them to Congress.

## Resource Requirements

### Funding

| Phase | Estimated Cost | Funding Source | Notes |
|-------|----------------|----------------|-------|
