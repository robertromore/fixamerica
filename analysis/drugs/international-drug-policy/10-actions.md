# International Drug Policy: What You Can Do

International drug policy may seem distant from daily life, but U.S. foreign drug programs are funded by American taxpayers, shaped by American voters, and have profound consequences for millions of people in producer and transit countries. Citizen engagement can shift the political calculus that keeps failed policies in place.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- Subscribe to the **International Drug Policy Consortium (IDPC) Alert** for monthly updates on global drug policy developments: <https://idpc.net/>
- Follow the **UNODC World Drug Report** releases (annual, typically June) for the most comprehensive global data: <https://www.unodc.org/wdr/>
- Read the **Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA)** drug policy blog for accessible analysis of U.S.-Latin America drug policy: <https://www.wola.org/program/drug-policy/>
- Follow the **Global Commission on Drug Policy** reports for high-level reform advocacy: <https://www.globalcommissionondrugs.org/>
- Read the State Department's annual **International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR)** to understand how the U.S. government assesses its own programs: <https://www.state.gov/international-narcotics-control-strategy-reports/>

### Make Personal Changes

- Educate yourself on how U.S. drug demand drives violence abroad -- an estimated 400,000+ people have been killed in Mexico's drug war since 2006, driven in significant part by U.S. demand for illicit drugs
- If you use substances, learn about harm reduction practices and share knowledge with your community
- Support fair-trade and alternative-development products from former drug-producing regions when available

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact Your Representatives**: Urge them to support rebalancing international drug spending from enforcement to health and development programs. Specify that you support the recommendations of the Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission (2020).
- **Submit Public Comments**: When the ONDCP publishes its National Drug Control Strategy for public comment, advocate for health-centered international programs.
- **Write Letters to the Editor**: When news stories cover drug violence in Latin America, drug seizures at the border, or fentanyl precursor diplomacy, write letters connecting these issues to the failure of supply-side enforcement and the need for reform.
- **Share Information**: Share reports from the Global Commission on Drug Policy and WOLA on social media. Data-driven content about the failure of the War on Drugs consistently gains traction across political lines.

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- Form a local study group on international drug policy using materials from the Drug Policy Alliance or Transform Drug Policy Foundation
- Host a screening of documentaries on the War on Drugs (*Breaking the Taboo*, *The House I Live In*, *The 13th*) followed by discussion
- Partner with immigrant communities from Latin America -- many of whom have direct experience with drug violence -- to amplify their voices in drug policy debates
- Invite speakers from WOLA, DPA, or IDPC to community events

### Build Coalitions

- Connect drug policy reform with immigration advocacy -- drug violence is a primary driver of migration from Central America and Mexico, making these natural allies
- Engage faith communities through the moral case for ending policies that cause violence and suffering abroad while failing to reduce drug use at home
- Build common ground with fiscal conservatives who oppose wasteful government spending -- $5.5 billion/year on international drug programs with no measurable reduction in drug supply is a powerful fiscal argument
- Connect with veterans' organizations, as many veterans served in counter-narcotics operations and can speak to the limitations of military approaches

## Political Actions

### Contact Elected Officials

**When to Contact**:

- During annual appropriations debates (typically March-September), when INL, DOD counter-narcotics, and foreign assistance budgets are set
- When the ONDCP publishes its annual National Drug Control Strategy (typically February-March)
- When international drug policy bills are introduced or scheduled for committee hearings
- When drug-related violence escalates in Latin America and the media covers the story

**What to Say - Template Email**:

```
Subject: Reform U.S. International Drug Control Programs

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

I am a constituent from [City, State] writing to urge you to support reforming U.S. international drug control programs. The United States spends approximately $5.5 billion annually on international drug enforcement, yet global coca cultivation hit record highs in 2022 and fentanyl seizures continue to increase.

The Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission -- a bipartisan Congressional commission -- recommended in 2020 that the U.S. shift toward health-based approaches in international drug policy. I urge you to support:

1. Rebalancing international drug spending from enforcement (currently ~80%) to health, development, and alternative livelihood programs (at least 60%)
2. Replacing the unilateral drug certification process with cooperative bilateral agreements
3. Supporting evidence-based approaches including harm reduction and decriminalization at the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs

The current approach has failed by its own metrics. We need the courage to try evidence-based alternatives.

Thank you for your service and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say - Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City]. I'm calling about U.S. international drug policy. I'd like the [Representative/Senator] to support rebalancing our $5.5 billion in international drug spending from enforcement toward health and development programs, as recommended by the Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission. The current approach has not reduced drug supply. Can you please note my position?"
```

### Support Legislation

Current or proposed legislation to support:

- **Global Drug Harm Reduction Act** (proposed): Would establish a PEPFAR-style harm reduction initiative for international drug programs -- contact your representatives to request they introduce or co-sponsor
- **Appropriations amendments**: Support amendments to the State-Foreign Operations appropriations bill that increase funding for USAID alternative development and reduce funding for aerial eradication
- **Fentanyl precursor legislation**: Support bills that strengthen multilateral precursor chemical controls while avoiding militarized enforcement approaches

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "The U.S. spends $5.5 billion per year on international drug control, yet coca cultivation is at record highs and fentanyl continues to flow. What would you do differently?"
2. "Would you support shifting international drug spending from military and law enforcement approaches toward health and development programs?"
3. "What is your position on the UN drug treaty framework and whether the U.S. should support international drug policy reform?"

**Voting Considerations**:

- Look for candidates who reference evidence-based drug policy, health-centered approaches, and the need to reform the War on Drugs internationally
- Key committees: Senate Foreign Relations, House Foreign Affairs, Senate/House Appropriations (State-Foreign Operations subcommittee), Senate/House Judiciary

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing international drug policy with others, emphasize:

1. **Fiscal waste**: "The U.S. spends $5.5 billion per year on international drug enforcement, but global coca cultivation is at record highs and fentanyl keeps flowing. We're throwing money at approaches that don't work."
2. **Human cost**: "The War on Drugs has killed over 400,000 people in Mexico since 2006 and destabilized communities across Latin America -- while doing nothing to reduce drug use in the United States."
3. **Evidence-based alternatives**: "Portugal decriminalized all drugs in 2001 and saw drug deaths and HIV infections plummet. We should be supporting evidence-based approaches, not doubling down on prohibition."
4. **Bipartisan issue**: "The bipartisan Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission recommended shifting U.S. international drug policy toward health-based approaches. This isn't a left-right issue -- it's about what works."

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "We just need to enforce harder and the drug supply will dry up" | The U.S. has spent $50+ billion on international drug enforcement since 1980 with no sustained reduction in drug supply. Coca cultivation hit record highs in 2022. | UNODC World Drug Report, 2023 |
| "Decriminalization causes drug use to skyrocket" | Portugal decriminalized all drugs in 2001 and drug use rates did not significantly increase over 20+ years; drug-related deaths fell dramatically | EMCDDA, 2023 |
| "Legalizing drugs would empower cartels" | Prohibition is the source of cartel profits. Canada's legal cannabis market captured ~70% of sales by 2023, eroding the black market | Statistics Canada, 2023; Health Canada, 2023 |
| "Crop eradication is the best way to reduce supply" | Decades of eradication have failed due to the balloon effect -- production simply shifts elsewhere. Treatment is 7-10x more cost-effective | RAND Corporation, 1994/2005 |
| "International drug policy doesn't affect ordinary Americans" | U.S. drug policy drives violence that fuels migration, costs taxpayers $5.5B/year, and fails to prevent overdose deaths at home | ONDCP, 2024; CDC, 2024 |
