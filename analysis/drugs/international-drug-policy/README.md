# International Drug Policy

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of international drug policy as it relates to U.S. foreign drug control efforts, global treaty frameworks, and comparative national approaches to drug regulation.

## Overview

International drug policy encompasses the web of treaties, bilateral agreements, foreign aid programs, and multilateral institutions that govern how nations address the production, trafficking, and consumption of controlled substances. The United States has been the dominant force shaping international drug control since the early twentieth century, embedding prohibition-oriented approaches into the three core UN drug conventions and channeling billions of dollars into supply-side programs from Plan Colombia to the Merida Initiative. The result is a global framework that criminalizes drug production and use in most countries while failing to reduce the overall supply of illicit substances reaching consumer markets.

A growing number of countries have diverged from the prohibitionist consensus. Portugal decriminalized personal possession of all drugs in 2001 and saw drug-related deaths, HIV infections, and incarceration rates decline significantly. Uruguay legalized cannabis in 2013, followed by Canada in 2018. Multiple Latin American leaders have publicly called for alternatives to the War on Drugs, citing the devastating violence, corruption, and institutional erosion that supply-side enforcement has produced in their countries. These developments challenge the U.S.-led prohibition model and raise fundamental questions about whether American foreign drug policy serves its stated goals.

This analysis examines the international treaty framework, U.S. foreign drug policy programs, comparative national models, the role of multilateral institutions, and the emerging global reform movement. It proposes evidence-based reforms that rebalance U.S. international drug policy from enforcement-dominated approaches toward health-centered strategies that address the root causes of both drug supply and demand.
