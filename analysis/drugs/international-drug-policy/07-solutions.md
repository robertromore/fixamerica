# International Drug Policy: Solutions

Reforming international drug policy requires a multi-faceted approach that rebalances U.S. foreign drug spending from enforcement to health, modernizes the treaty framework, strengthens alternative development, and supports partner nations in adopting evidence-based approaches.

---

## Reform Framework

### Guiding Principles

- Evidence over ideology: Base international drug policy on scientific evidence and public health outcomes, not on moral prohibition or political expedience
- Health outcomes as the primary metric: Measure success by reductions in overdose deaths, HIV transmission, drug-related violence, and incarceration -- not by hectares eradicated or kilograms seized
- Respect sovereignty: Support partner nations in choosing approaches that fit their circumstances, rather than conditioning aid on compliance with U.S. enforcement priorities
- Address root causes: Invest in the poverty, governance failures, and lack of economic opportunity that drive drug crop cultivation and trafficking
- Maintain enforcement against trafficking organizations: Continue targeting large-scale trafficking networks and their financial infrastructure while decriminalizing personal use

### Theory of Change

The current system fails because it targets the supply of drugs rather than the demand, economics, and governance failures that drive the drug trade. Reform works by: (1) shifting U.S. international spending from enforcement to health and development; (2) supporting treaty flexibility that enables evidence-based national approaches; (3) investing in alternative development that addresses why farmers grow drug crops; (4) building partner-country health systems to reduce demand; and (5) targeting trafficking organizations' finances rather than their agricultural supply chains.

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Rebalance U.S. International Drug Spending from Enforcement to Health and Development

**Description**: Restructure the allocation of the approximately $5.5 billion U.S. international drug control budget to direct at least 60% toward demand reduction, alternative development, public health infrastructure, and governance strengthening, with no more than 40% to supply-side enforcement. Currently, approximately 80% goes to supply-side programs and 20% to demand-side programs. This rebalancing would shift approximately $2.2 billion annually from enforcement to health and development.

**Evidence Base**: RAND Corporation research consistently demonstrates that treatment and prevention are 7-10 times more cost-effective than supply-side interventions at reducing drug consumption. The London School of Economics IDPP report (2016) concluded that enforcement-heavy approaches have failed to reduce global drug supply. USAID's own evaluations show that development-oriented programs produce more sustainable outcomes than enforcement-conditioned assistance.

**Implementation**: Executive branch rebalancing through ONDCP strategy revision and Presidential Decision Directive; Congressional reauthorization of INL and DOD counter-narcotics programs with new allocation mandates; phased transition over 5 years to avoid destabilizing existing programs.

**Cost/Resources**: Budget-neutral at the aggregate level -- same total spending, different allocation. May require new personnel with public health and development expertise at INL and in U.S. embassies.

**Timeline**: 2 years for executive branch rebalancing; 3-5 years for Congressional reauthorization; 5-7 years for full transition.

**Challenges**: Institutional resistance from DEA, DOD, and defense contractors; Congressional defense hawks; concern about abandoning partner-country security forces.

**Impact Metrics**: Share of budget allocated to demand reduction vs. supply reduction; partner-country treatment access rates; overdose rates in countries receiving U.S. assistance; independent program evaluations.

### Solution 2: Support UN Drug Treaty Modernization Through Flexible Interpretation

**Description**: Lead a coalition of willing nations to advance flexible interpretation of the existing drug conventions -- rather than formal treaty amendment -- to accommodate evidence-based approaches including decriminalization, harm reduction, and regulated markets. This approach uses the "constitutional principles" and "basic concepts of legal system" language in Article 3(2) of the 1988 Convention, plus the general welfare clauses in all three treaties, to argue that nations may adopt health-oriented approaches consistent with their treaty obligations.

**Evidence Base**: Legal scholarship by Bewley-Taylor (2012), Walsh (2014), and the Transnational Institute documents extensive treaty flexibility. The INCB has not taken enforcement action against any nation that has legalized cannabis, suggesting de facto acceptance. The Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties permits interpretation in light of subsequent practice, and the practice of 30+ nations that have decriminalized constitutes significant subsequent practice.

**Implementation**: Issue a formal legal opinion from the State Department Legal Adviser supporting flexible treaty interpretation; co-sponsor a CND resolution affirming national discretion in drug policy; establish an inter se agreement among reformist nations (Canada, Uruguay, Germany, Portugal, Colombia) creating a "drug policy reform caucus" at the CND.

**Cost/Resources**: Minimal direct cost -- diplomatic effort and legal analysis. Estimated $5-10 million for diplomatic engagement and legal work.

**Timeline**: Legal opinion within 1 year; CND resolution within 2 years; inter se agreement within 3 years.

**Challenges**: Opposition from Russia, China, and prohibitionist states at CND; INCB criticism; domestic political criticism of "weakening" treaties; complexity of multinational legal negotiations.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of nations supporting flexible interpretation; CND voting outcomes; INCB annual report language; number of nations adopting evidence-based reforms.

### Solution 3: Scale Effective Alternative Development Programs

**Description**: Dramatically expand and improve alternative development programs in drug-producing regions, drawing on lessons from Thailand's successful transition from opium production and UNODC best practices. Key improvements include: sequencing alternative development *before* eradication (not after); investing in market access infrastructure (roads, processing facilities, cold chains); securing land tenure for farming communities; and providing multi-year guaranteed purchase agreements for legal crops.

**Evidence Base**: Thailand's Royal Project reduced opium cultivation from 17,920 hectares (1965) to under 300 hectares (2002) through sustained investment in alternative crops, infrastructure, and market access over 30+ years. UNODC Alternative Development Guidelines (2015) identify sequencing, market access, and participatory design as critical success factors. Colombia's own studies show that 78% of coca farmers would switch to legal crops given equivalent income and market access (Colombia National Survey, 2018).

**Implementation**: Triple USAID alternative development funding from $350 million to $1 billion annually; establish multi-year guaranteed purchase programs for coca/poppy region farmers; invest in rural infrastructure; condition eradication on availability of viable alternatives; create public-private partnerships for legal crop marketing.

**Cost/Resources**: $1 billion/year (up from $350 million); offset by reducing eradication and military programs. 10-year total investment of approximately $10 billion, comparable to Plan Colombia's total but directed at root causes.

**Timeline**: Program design and partnerships in years 1-2; initial deployments in years 2-3; measurable cultivation shifts in years 5-7; sustained transition in years 7-15.

**Challenges**: Farmer skepticism based on past broken promises; narco-trafficking organizations threatening farmers who switch to legal crops; infrastructure deficits in remote growing regions; political difficulty of reducing eradication budgets.

**Impact Metrics**: Hectares transitioned from drug crops to legal agriculture; farmer income levels; road and infrastructure investment; legal crop export volumes; cultivation survey trends.

### Solution 4: Establish International Harm Reduction Funding

**Description**: Create a dedicated U.S. international harm reduction funding stream of $500 million annually to support naloxone distribution, opioid substitution therapy, syringe service programs, drug checking services, and supervised consumption facilities in partner countries. Model this on the PEPFAR (President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) framework, which demonstrated that U.S. global health investments can achieve transformative results.

**Evidence Base**: PEPFAR invested $100+ billion since 2003 and is credited with saving 25+ million lives through HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention. Harm reduction programs have been shown to reduce HIV transmission by 50-70% (WHO, 2023), reduce overdose deaths by 25-50% where naloxone is widely available (CDC, 2023), and reduce drug-related crime by connecting users to services. Switzerland's heroin-assisted treatment program reduced crime among participants by 60% and new heroin initiations by 82%.

**Implementation**: Congressional authorization of a "Global Drug Harm Reduction Initiative" modeled on PEPFAR; housed at USAID with coordination by the Global Health Security Agenda; bilateral agreements with high-burden countries; partnerships with WHO and UNODC.

**Cost/Resources**: $500 million/year; offset partially by reduced enforcement spending. This represents roughly 10% of U.S. international drug spending redirected to harm reduction.

**Timeline**: Congressional authorization in year 1-2; initial programs in year 2-3; scale-up in years 3-5; global coverage of high-burden countries by year 7.

**Challenges**: Congressional opposition to funding harm reduction internationally; stigma around supervised consumption; partner-country legal barriers to harm reduction; coordination with existing health programs.

**Impact Metrics**: Lives saved (overdose deaths averted); HIV infections prevented; treatment enrollment rates; naloxone kits distributed; syringe service program coverage.

### Solution 5: Restructure Fentanyl Response Around Precursor Diplomacy and Demand Reduction

**Description**: Shift the U.S. fentanyl response from interdiction-focused (seizing drugs at the border) to precursor-focused (controlling chemical supply chains) and demand-focused (expanding treatment at home and abroad). Establish a multilateral precursor chemical monitoring system modeled on the Chemical Weapons Convention's verification regime, with dedicated inspectors, declared facilities, and challenge inspections.

**Evidence Base**: CBP seized 27,023 kg of fentanyl in FY2023 -- representing an unknown but likely small fraction of total flow. The DEA estimates that one kilogram of fentanyl can produce approximately 500,000 lethal doses, meaning interdiction alone cannot prevent mass casualties. The November 2023 Biden-Xi agreement on fentanyl precursors produced limited enforcement results through 2024. A comprehensive precursor control regime, combined with demand reduction (expanded MAT and harm reduction), offers a more viable path.

**Implementation**: Negotiate a multilateral Fentanyl Precursor Control Agreement with China, India, and other precursor-producing nations; establish a dedicated inspection and monitoring body; create an early warning system for novel precursors; simultaneously expand domestic treatment capacity and international harm reduction.

**Cost/Resources**: $200-300 million annually for the multilateral precursor regime; additional demand-reduction costs addressed in domestic policy. Total new international spending of approximately $300 million/year.

**Timeline**: Diplomatic negotiations in years 1-3; treaty ratification in years 2-4; inspection regime operational in years 3-5; measurable precursor supply reduction in years 4-7.

**Challenges**: China's reluctance to enforce precursor controls; India's large chemical industry; detection of novel precursors; diplomatic complexity of a new multilateral regime.

**Impact Metrics**: Volume of scheduled precursors seized; number of clandestine labs identified; fentanyl purity/availability trends; overdose death trends.

### Solution 6: End the Drug Certification Process and Replace with Cooperative Frameworks

**Description**: Repeal the U.S. drug certification process -- the annual Presidential Determination that judges whether major drug-producing countries are cooperating sufficiently with U.S. anti-drug efforts -- and replace it with bilateral cooperation agreements that establish shared metrics, mutual accountability, and joint evaluation. The certification process is widely viewed as a paternalistic, unilateral tool that generates resentment and undermines genuine cooperation.

**Evidence Base**: The Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission (2020) recommended moving away from unilateral certification toward cooperative frameworks. Latin American governments and civil society organizations have consistently criticized the process as hypocritical -- the world's largest drug-consuming nation judging producer countries. The process has not demonstrably improved cooperation; nations deemed "fully cooperative" (like Mexico under the Merida Initiative) have often seen drug production and violence increase.

**Implementation**: Congressional repeal of certification requirements in the Foreign Assistance Act; negotiation of bilateral cooperation agreements with major partner countries; establishment of joint monitoring and evaluation mechanisms with shared metrics.

**Cost/Resources**: Minimal direct cost; savings from reduced bureaucratic overhead. Diplomatic investment in negotiating new agreements.

**Timeline**: Congressional action in years 1-2; bilateral agreements negotiated in years 2-4; new cooperative framework operational by year 5.

**Challenges**: Congressional reluctance to relinquish a perceived leverage tool; concern about losing pressure on non-cooperative nations; need for credible alternative accountability mechanisms.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of bilateral cooperation agreements signed; partner-country satisfaction surveys; joint evaluation outcomes; drug-related violence and health metrics in partner countries.

## International Models

### Portugal: Decriminalization with Health Investment

**Description**: Portugal decriminalized personal possession of all drugs in 2001 (Law 30/2000), replacing criminal penalties with administrative Dissuasion Commissions. Simultaneously invested heavily in treatment infrastructure, including opioid substitution therapy for approximately 40,000 people.

**Results**: Drug-related deaths fell from 80 (2001) to 16 (2012); HIV infections among people who inject drugs fell from 1,016 (2001) to 18 (2017); drug-related incarceration fell from 44% to ~24% of prison population. Drug use did not significantly increase (EMCDDA, 2023).

**Applicability to U.S. International Policy**: Portugal demonstrates that decriminalization, when paired with health investment, produces measurable improvements. The U.S. should support partner nations in adopting similar approaches rather than pressuring them to maintain criminal penalties. USAID and INL should fund technical assistance to help countries design and implement Dissuasion Commission models.

### Switzerland: Heroin-Assisted Treatment

**Description**: Beginning in 1994, Switzerland introduced heroin-assisted treatment (HAT) for treatment-resistant opioid users, providing pharmaceutical-grade heroin in supervised clinical settings.

**Results**: Crime among HAT participants fell 60%; new heroin initiations declined 82% over 10 years; employment among participants increased; HIV transmission declined sharply. The program costs approximately CHF 15,000 ($17,000) per patient per year, compared to CHF 75,000 ($85,000) for incarceration (Swiss Federal Office of Public Health, 2023).

**Applicability to U.S. International Policy**: The Swiss model demonstrates that providing alternatives to illicit markets reduces both crime and public health harms. The U.S. should support HAT and other medication-assisted treatment programs in partner countries through the proposed Global Drug Harm Reduction Initiative.

### Thailand: Alternative Development Success

**Description**: Thailand's Royal Project (1969-present) transitioned highland communities from opium cultivation to legal crops including coffee, strawberries, and cut flowers, with sustained investment in roads, irrigation, education, and market access.

**Results**: Opium cultivation fell from 17,920 hectares (1965) to under 300 hectares (2002). Former opium-growing communities now earn higher incomes from legal agriculture. Thailand is now a net exporter of highland agricultural products.

**Applicability to U.S. International Policy**: Thailand's success demonstrates that alternative development works when it is adequately funded, sustained over decades, and addresses market access and infrastructure -- not just crop substitution. The U.S. should model its alternative development programs in Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia on Thai principles.

### Canada: National Cannabis Regulation

**Description**: Canada's Cannabis Act (2018) legalized recreational cannabis with federal regulation and provincial implementation, including age restrictions, potency limits, packaging requirements, and public health campaigns.

**Results**: Legal market captured approximately 70% of sales by 2023; youth use remained stable; impaired driving did not significantly increase; cannabis-related criminal charges dropped 74% (Statistics Canada, 2023).

**Applicability to U.S. International Policy**: Canada's experience demonstrates that national cannabis regulation is viable in a G7 economy without the catastrophic consequences predicted by prohibition advocates. The U.S. should support treaty flexibility that enables similar regulatory approaches globally.

## Pilot Programs and Demonstrations

- **Colombia Total Peace Program (2022-present)**: President Petro's government is piloting a "total peace" approach that treats coca communities as development partners rather than enforcement targets, offering land titles, crop substitution support, and infrastructure investment in exchange for voluntary transition away from coca. Early results are mixed but the approach merits monitoring and potential U.S. support.
- **USAID Development-First Model (Peru, 2019-present)**: USAID-Peru is testing an approach that sequences development assistance before eradication, providing market access and infrastructure to coca communities that voluntarily reduce cultivation. Initial evaluations show higher farmer participation rates than eradication-first models.
- **Bolivia Coca Regulation Model (2004-present)**: Bolivia allows legal coca cultivation within a defined area (the "cato" system of 1,600 square meters per farmer) for traditional use and industrialization (coca tea, flour, medicines). This model regulates rather than prohibits cultivation, with community-based enforcement.

- Establish a track record of alternative development success that enables broader eradication phase-down
- Support inter se treaty modification among willing nations to formalize reform approaches

## Complementary Policies

- **Domestic Drug Policy Reform**: International reform is difficult to advance while U.S. domestic policy remains anchored in prohibition. Federal cannabis legalization, expanded treatment access, and harm reduction funding domestically would strengthen the credibility of reform advocacy abroad. See [Cannabis Legalization](../cannabis-legalization/07-solutions.md) and [Harm Reduction](../harm-reduction/07-solutions.md).
- **Anti-Money Laundering**: Strengthening financial intelligence and anti-money laundering enforcement targeting drug trafficking organizations' assets is essential to maintain enforcement credibility while shifting away from supply-side agricultural programs. See [Drug Trafficking](../drug-trafficking/07-solutions.md).
- **Immigration Policy**: Drug violence is a primary driver of migration from Central America and Mexico. Effective international drug policy reform would reduce push factors for migration. See [analysis/immigration/](../../immigration/01-overview.md).
