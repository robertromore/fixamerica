# International Drug Policy: Legislation

## Overview

Reforming U.S. international drug policy requires both new federal legislation and executive action. The legislative approach is incremental rather than comprehensive, reflecting the political reality that wholesale reform of U.S. foreign drug policy faces significant institutional resistance. The strategy centers on three legislative vehicles: (1) a reauthorization of international narcotics control programs with new allocation mandates, (2) establishment of a dedicated international harm reduction initiative, and (3) repeal of the unilateral drug certification process. No constitutional amendments are required.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for international drug policy reform. The relevant authorities -- foreign affairs, treaty implementation, foreign assistance, and appropriations -- are well-established Congressional powers under Article I and presidential powers under Article II.*

## Federal Legislation

### The International Drug Policy Reform Act

**Purpose**: Reauthorize and restructure U.S. international narcotics control programs to rebalance spending from supply-side enforcement toward demand reduction, health, and alternative development, with outcome-based evaluation requirements.

**Key Provisions**:

1. Mandates a phased transition to 60% demand reduction / 40% supply reduction spending allocation for international drug programs
2. Replaces the unilateral drug certification process with cooperative bilateral evaluation frameworks
3. Requires outcome-based evaluation of all international drug programs using health and development metrics
4. Restricts aerial fumigation of drug crops to cases where environmental and health impact assessments have been completed

119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To reauthorize and reform United States international narcotics
control programs, to require evidence-based evaluation of
program effectiveness, and to rebalance program spending
toward demand reduction and alternative development.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "International Drug Policy Reform
Act of 2027".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) The United States has spent more than $50 billion on
international drug control programs since 1980, yet global
coca cultivation reached a record 355,000 hectares in 2022
(UNODC World Drug Report, 2023).

(2) Approximately 80 percent of U.S. international drug control
spending is directed to supply-side interventions (eradication,
interdiction, law enforcement training), despite evidence that
demand reduction is 7 to 10 times more cost-effective at
reducing drug consumption (RAND Corporation, 1994; 2005).

(3) Plan Colombia invested $10 billion in U.S. funds from 2000
to 2016, yet Colombian coca cultivation in 2022 exceeded
pre-Plan Colombia levels.

(4) The bipartisan Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission
recommended in 2020 that the United States adopt health-
centered approaches in international drug policy.

(5) More than 30 nations have decriminalized personal drug
possession without experiencing significant increases in drug
use, while observing improvements in public health outcomes.

(6) The emergence of synthetic drugs, particularly fentanyl,
has fundamentally undermined agricultural supply-side strategies
including crop eradication.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4 (Rebalancing)**: The phased 50% by FY2029 and 60% by FY2032 targets provide a manageable transition period for agencies to shift resources. The transition plan requirement ensures implementation is orderly.
- **Section 5 (Outcome-Based Evaluation)**: This is the most consequential provision. By prohibiting activity-based metrics (hectares, seizures, arrests) as primary success measures and requiring health and development outcomes, it forces fundamental reform of how programs are designed and evaluated.
- **Section 6 (Cooperative Frameworks)**: Replacing certification with cooperative evaluation addresses the most persistent source of diplomatic friction in hemispheric drug policy. Joint evaluation teams build genuine cooperation rather than unilateral judgment.
- **Section 7 (Aerial Fumigation)**: Requiring environmental assessments and alternative livelihood sequencing addresses the most controversial element of U.S. eradication programs.
- **Section 10 (Appropriations)**: The graduated increase from $5.8 billion to $7.5 billion reflects the additional investment needed for demand reduction scaling, while the rebalancing mandate ensures the increase goes to health and development programs.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Transition plan submitted to Congress | 180 days after enactment | ONDCP |
| First annual spending report | 1 year after enactment | State Department |
| GAO baseline evaluation completed | 18 months after enactment | GAO |
| First 10 cooperative agreements signed | 2 years after enactment | State Department |
| 50% demand reduction spending achieved | FY2029 | ONDCP/OMB |
| All cooperative agreements completed | 4 years after enactment | State Department |
| 60% demand reduction spending achieved | FY2032 | ONDCP/OMB |

**Regulatory Authority**: ONDCP coordinates interagency implementation; State Department INL administers bilateral programs; USAID manages alternative development; GAO provides independent evaluation.

**Challenges**:

- **Institutional resistance**: DEA, DOD, and defense contractors will lobby against spending rebalancing
- **Congressional politics**: Members on defense and judiciary committees may resist reducing enforcement budgets
- **Partner-country transition**: Some partner nations' security forces depend on U.S. counter-narcotics funding

**Refinements**:

- **Include grandfather clause**: Allow continuation of critical security programs during transition with annual justification requirements
- **Create reform incentives**: Offer additional funding to countries that voluntarily adopt evidence-based approaches
- **Add flexibility**: Allow the President to waive spending mandates for specific countries facing acute security crises, with Congressional notification

**Draft Text**:

```text
119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To establish a global drug harm reduction initiative to reduce
drug-related mortality, disease transmission, and suffering
in high-burden countries.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Global Drug Harm Reduction
Initiative Act of 2027".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) An estimated 600,000 people die annually from drug-related
causes worldwide (UNODC World Drug Report, 2024).

(2) Injection drug use accounts for approximately 10 percent
of new HIV infections globally and 33 percent of new hepatitis
C infections (WHO, 2023).

(3) Harm reduction programs -- including naloxone distribution,
opioid substitution therapy, and syringe service programs --
have been shown to reduce overdose deaths by 25 to 50 percent
and HIV transmission by 50 to 70 percent (WHO/UNODC, 2023).

(4) The President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)
demonstrated that U.S. global health investments can achieve
transformative results, saving an estimated 25 million lives
since 2003.

(5) Only 1 in 8 people who inject drugs worldwide has access
to harm reduction services (Harm Reduction International, 2023).

SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF INITIATIVE.

(a) IN GENERAL.—The Administrator of the United States Agency
for International Development shall establish the Global Drug
Harm Reduction Initiative to provide evidence-based harm
reduction services in high-burden countries.

(b) COORDINATOR.—The Administrator shall appoint a Global
Drug Harm Reduction Coordinator to oversee the initiative.

(c) ELIGIBLE ACTIVITIES.—The initiative shall support—
    (1) naloxone distribution programs;

    (4) drug checking services;
    (5) supervised consumption facilities (where legally permitted
    by partner nations);
    (6) overdose prevention training;
    (7) linkage to substance use disorder treatment and recovery
    services; and
    (8) technical assistance and capacity building for partner
    country health systems.

SEC. 4. COUNTRY PRIORITIZATION.

(a) HIGH-BURDEN COUNTRIES.—The Coordinator shall prioritize
countries based on—
    (1) drug-related mortality rates;
    (2) HIV and hepatitis C prevalence among people who inject
    drugs;
    (3) availability of existing harm reduction services;
    (4) government willingness to cooperate; and
    (5) potential for measurable impact.

SEC. 5. PARTNERSHIPS.

The Administrator shall coordinate with—
    (1) the World Health Organization;
    (2) the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime;
    (3) the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria;
    (4) partner country health ministries; and
    (5) civil society organizations with harm reduction expertise.

SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated—

## State Model Legislation

### Model International Drug Policy Accountability Resolution

**Purpose**: State legislatures can pass resolutions calling on the federal government to reform international drug policy, creating bottom-up political pressure.

**Adaptability Notes**: States with significant immigrant populations from drug-affected countries (California, Texas, Florida, New York) may emphasize the connection between drug violence and migration. States with cannabis legalization may emphasize treaty reform.

**Draft Text**:

```text
A RESOLUTION

Urging the United States Congress and the President to reform
international drug control programs to prioritize evidence-based
approaches over enforcement-only strategies.

WHEREAS, the United States spends approximately $5.5 billion
annually on international drug control programs;

WHEREAS, global coca cultivation reached record highs in 2022
despite decades of eradication programs;

WHEREAS, drug-related violence has caused more than 400,000
deaths in Mexico since 2006;

WHEREAS, evidence from Portugal, Switzerland, Canada, and other
nations demonstrates that health-centered drug policies reduce
drug-related deaths, disease, and crime;

WHEREAS, the bipartisan Western Hemisphere Drug Policy Commission
recommended in 2020 that the United States adopt health-centered
approaches in international drug policy;

WHEREAS, drug violence in Latin America is a primary driver of
migration to the United States, affecting communities in
[State]; NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT

RESOLVED, That the Legislature of the State of [State] urges
the United States Congress to rebalance international drug
control spending toward health, development, and alternative
livelihood programs; and be it further

RESOLVED, That the Legislature urges the President to support
evidence-based approaches including harm reduction and
decriminalization at the United Nations Commission on Narcotic
Drugs; and be it further

RESOLVED, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to
[State]'s Congressional delegation, the President of the
United States, and the Secretary of State.
```

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agencies**: State Department (INL), USAID, ONDCP, DEA, DOD

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **ONDCP International Program Guidelines**: Updated guidelines establishing outcome-based evaluation criteria for all international drug programs; deadline: 180 days after enactment
2. **State/INL Program Rebalancing Regulations**: Regulations implementing the phased spending rebalancing mandate; deadline: 1 year after enactment
3. **Cooperative Evaluation Framework Template**: Standard template for bilateral cooperation agreements replacing certification; deadline: 120 days after enactment

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Congressional Oversight**: Annual reporting requirements with specific data on spending allocation and program outcomes
- **GAO Audits**: Biennial independent evaluations of programs exceeding $10 million annual expenditure
- **Budget Conditionality**: OMB may withhold funds from agencies not meeting rebalancing targets
- **Inspector General Review**: State Department and USAID Inspectors General review program compliance

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Treaty Power and Congressional Authority**: Congress has clear authority to legislate international drug policy under the Commerce Clause, Necessary and Proper Clause, and spending power. The President has authority to negotiate and interpret treaties under Article II. Reform does not require treaty withdrawal, only flexible interpretation and new legislation governing U.S. programs.

**Separation of Powers**: The certification process replacement (Section 6) transfers some executive discretion to bilateral cooperative frameworks. This is permissible because Congress is conditioning aid (a spending power) rather than directing foreign policy (an executive power).

### Preemption

Federal international drug policy preempts conflicting state actions under the Supremacy Clause. However, state resolutions urging federal reform are permissible exercises of state legislative authority.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance is ensured through annual Congressional reporting, GAO evaluations, and budget conditionality. No private right of action is created. Enforcement against non-cooperating partner nations operates through the bilateral cooperative frameworks' dispute resolution mechanisms.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| Reclassifying supply programs as "demand reduction" | Agencies could relabel enforcement programs (e.g., calling interdiction "demand reduction" because it reduces supply) to meet spending mandates | High | Add detailed definitions of demand and supply programs with explicit exclusions; require GAO classification review |
| Waiver provisions for acute security crises | The presidential waiver for spending mandates could be invoked routinely to avoid rebalancing | Medium | Limit waivers to 1 year per country; require Congressional notification within 30 days; cap waived funds at 15% of total |
| Cooperative framework negotiations stalling | Partner nations could delay negotiations indefinitely, maintaining certification by default | Medium | Set mandatory timelines with automatic certification suspension if frameworks are not completed |
| Outcome metrics manipulation | Agencies could select favorable metrics or cherry-pick data to demonstrate success | Medium | Require GAO to independently verify all outcome data; establish standardized metric definitions in regulation |
| Aerial fumigation workarounds | Agencies could fund partner-country fumigation programs rather than conducting fumigation directly | Low | Extend prohibition to "funding, supporting, or assisting" aerial fumigation; cover both direct and indirect activities |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| No treaty reform mandate | Legislation reforms U.S. programs but does not address the UN convention framework directly | Treaty reform requires multilateral action that legislation cannot mandate | Include sense-of-Congress provision directing the executive branch to pursue treaty flexibility at CND |
| Insufficient enforcement against trafficking organizations | Focus on rebalancing may be perceived as weakening anti-trafficking enforcement | Political sensitivity of appearing "soft on cartels" | Explicitly maintain and strengthen financial intelligence and anti-money laundering programs; create separate trafficking enforcement authorization |
| Alternative development timeline mismatch | Crop transition takes 10-15 years but Congressional attention spans are 2-4 years | Structural mismatch between development timelines and political cycles | Build in 10-year authorization with automatic renewal; establish independent evaluation milestones |
| Partner-country capacity constraints | Many countries lack the health infrastructure to absorb increased harm reduction and treatment funding | Decades of underinvestment in public health systems in producer/transit countries | Include explicit capacity-building funding; partner with WHO and existing health programs; phase expansion based on absorption capacity |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Anti-relabeling provision**: Amend Section 3 definitions to include explicit lists of programs that qualify as demand reduction and supply reduction, with a prohibition on reclassification without GAO approval.
2. **Waiver limitation**: Amend Section 4 to limit presidential waivers to one year per country, require affirmative Congressional approval for extensions, and cap waived funds at 15% of total international drug spending.
3. **Treaty flexibility directive**: Add a sense-of-Congress section directing the Secretary of State to advocate for flexible treaty interpretation at the CND and to explore inter se modification among willing nations.
4. **Trafficking enforcement preservation**: Add a separate title maintaining and strengthening financial intelligence, anti-money laundering, and anti-trafficking enforcement, clearly separated from the spending rebalancing provisions.
5. **Long-term authorization**: Structure the authorization as a 10-year program with 5-year Congressional review, ensuring continuity while maintaining accountability.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

The legislation should include a 10-year authorization period (FY2028-FY2037) with a mandatory 5-year Congressional review at the midpoint (FY2032). The GAO shall produce a comprehensive evaluation report 90 days before the 5-year review. If Congress does not reauthorize by FY2037, programs continue at the FY2037 funding level for 2 years to prevent disruption while reauthorization is completed.
