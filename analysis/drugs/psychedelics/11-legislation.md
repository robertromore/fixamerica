# Psychedelics Policy: Legislation

## Overview

Federal psychedelic policy reform requires a multi-track legislative approach addressing three primary failures: (1) the Schedule I classification that impedes research and clinical access despite growing therapeutic evidence; (2) the absence of a regulatory framework for psychedelic-assisted therapy; and (3) the lack of protections for indigenous religious use and natural resource conservation. This document presents draft federal legislation, state model legislation, and a regulatory framework designed to work in sequence -- beginning with research expansion and rescheduling, progressing to therapeutic access, and culminating in comprehensive reform including decriminalization of personal use and indigenous protections.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for psychedelic policy reform.* Congress has clear authority under the Commerce Clause (Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 3) to regulate controlled substances, as affirmed in *Gonzales v. Raich*, 545 U.S. 1 (2005). The Religious Freedom Restoration Act provides a statutory framework for religious use protections without requiring constitutional amendment.

119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To remove barriers to psychedelic therapy research, establish evidence-based
scheduling for psychedelic substances, create a framework for psychedelic-assisted
therapy access, and ensure equitable patient access to FDA-approved treatments.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Psychedelic Research and Therapy Access
Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) The Food and Drug Administration has granted Breakthrough Therapy
designation to psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression (2018) and
major depressive disorder (2019), and to MDMA-assisted therapy for
post-traumatic stress disorder (2017), recognizing substantial
improvement over existing therapies.

(2) An estimated 8,900,000 adults in the United States have
treatment-resistant depression, approximately 13,000,000 adults have
post-traumatic stress disorder in any given year, and approximately
1,700,000 veterans receive Department of Veterans Affairs care for
post-traumatic stress disorder (NIMH, 2023; VA NCPTSD, 2024).

(3) Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials at leading academic medical
centers have demonstrated significant therapeutic efficacy of psilocybin
and MDMA for these conditions, including a 71.2 percent remission rate
for PTSD in MDMA-assisted therapy trials (Mitchell et al., Nature
Medicine, 2023).

(4) Schedule I classification under the Controlled Substances Act
creates substantial barriers to psychedelic research, including lengthy
DEA licensing processes, supply constraints, and institutional
reluctance to conduct Schedule I studies (GAO, 2022).

(5) Classical psychedelic substances (psilocybin, LSD, MDMA, DMT)
produce rapid tolerance, do not cause physical dependence, and have
among the lowest addiction potential of psychoactive substances.

(6) Seventeen and five-tenths veterans die by suicide each day in the
United States, and up to 50 percent of veterans with PTSD drop out of
conventional evidence-based psychotherapy before completion (VA, 2023;
Hoge et al., JAMA Psychiatry, 2023).

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

(2) PSYCHEDELIC-ASSISTED THERAPY.--The term "psychedelic-assisted
therapy" means the administration of a breakthrough psychedelic substance
in a clinical or therapeutic setting by a certified practitioner, in
conjunction with preparation, administration, and integration sessions.

(3) CERTIFIED PSYCHEDELIC THERAPY PRACTITIONER.--The term "certified
psychedelic therapy practitioner" means a healthcare professional who
has completed training and certification requirements established
pursuant to section 7 of this Act.

(4) SECRETARY.--The term "Secretary" means the Secretary of Health
and Human Services.

```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4 (Evidence-Based Rescheduling)**: Requires the Attorney General to initiate and complete rescheduling within 12 months of FDA approval, with deference to scientific rather than law enforcement judgment. This addresses the core structural problem of DEA control over scheduling decisions.
- **Section 5 (Research Licensing)**: Establishes a 30-day review timeline with deemed-approval if the DEA fails to act, eliminating the 6-12 month delays that have historically deterred researchers.
- **Section 6 (Research Funding)**: Authorizes $200 million over 5 years across NIH, VA, and SAMHSA, with diversity requirements to address the lack of representation in clinical trials.
- **Section 7 (Practitioner Training)**: Creates a national certification framework with 200-hour minimum training requirements, addressing safety concerns about practitioner competency.
- **Section 8 (Insurance Coverage)**: Mandates insurance, Medicare, Medicaid, and VA coverage for FDA-approved therapies, preventing psychedelic therapy from becoming a luxury treatment for the wealthy.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Act takes effect | 90 days after enactment | N/A |
| DEA expedited research licensing process established | 6 months after enactment | DEA |
| NIH funding opportunity announcements published | 12 months after enactment | NIMH/NIDA |
| National practitioner training standards published | 2 years after enactment | HHS |
| Rescheduling proceedings initiated (triggered by FDA approval) | Within 12 months of FDA approval | AG/DEA |
| Insurance coverage requirement effective | Within 1 year of FDA approval | Insurers/CMS |
| VA coverage operational | Within 6 months of FDA approval | VA |

**Regulatory Authority**: HHS and FDA have primary regulatory authority. DEA retains scheduling authority but under compressed timelines and scientific deference requirements. CMS implements coverage. VA implements veteran access.

**Challenges**:

- **DEA institutional resistance**: The DEA has historically resisted rescheduling. The "deemed approved" research licensing provision and 12-month rescheduling deadline are designed to overcome institutional inertia.
- **Insurance industry pushback**: Multi-hour psychedelic therapy sessions are expensive and do not fit standard billing models. The bill requires CMS to develop new billing codes.
- **Workforce shortage**: There are currently far too few trained psychedelic therapists to meet potential demand. The 5-year training investment begins to address this but workforce scale will take time.

**Refinements**:

- **Add independent scheduling commission**: Consider creating an independent scientific scheduling body, removing final scheduling authority from the DEA entirely
- **Strengthen diversity provisions**: Add specific targets for minority enrollment in clinical trials (e.g., proportional to population prevalence of target conditions)
- **Expand compassionate access**: Add explicit Right to Try provisions for psychedelic therapies while FDA approval is pending

## State Model Legislation

### Model Psychedelic Therapy Services Act

**Purpose**: Provide a template for states seeking to establish regulated psychedelic therapy access programs, drawing on Oregon and Colorado's experience while incorporating stronger safety, equity, and indigenous protection provisions.

**Adaptability Notes**: States should customize the substances covered, training requirements, local opt-out provisions, and funding mechanisms based on their specific legal, budgetary, and political contexts. States with existing medical marijuana regulatory infrastructure may be able to adapt those systems.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "[State] Psychedelic
Therapy Services Act of [Year]".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS.

The [State Legislature] finds that:

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: Department of Health and Human Services (federal); state health departments (state programs)

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **Psychedelic Therapy Practitioner Certification Standards**: HHS to publish within 2 years of enactment; covers training hours, supervised practice, continuing education, ethics, and cultural competency requirements
2. **Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)**: FDA to develop for each approved psychedelic therapy; covers prescribing requirements, patient screening, session monitoring, and adverse event reporting
3. **Billing and Reimbursement Codes**: CMS to develop CPT codes for psychedelic therapy sessions (preparation, administration, integration) within 1 year of FDA approval
4. **DEA Expedited Research Licensing Regulations**: DEA to publish within 6 months of enactment; covers 30-day review timeline and deemed-approval provisions

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Civil Penalties**: Fines of up to $50,000 per violation for operating unlicensed psychedelic therapy centers or practicing without certification
- **Administrative Actions**: License revocation for service centers or practitioners violating safety, screening, or ethical standards
- **Private Right of Action**: Patients harmed by negligent or unlicensed practitioners may bring civil suits for damages
- **Criminal Penalties**: Diversion or unauthorized distribution of psychedelic substances outside of licensed therapeutic or research settings remains subject to existing CSA penalties

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Commerce Clause Authority**: Federal regulation of psychedelic substances is well-established under the Commerce Clause, as affirmed by *Gonzales v. Raich*, 545 U.S. 1 (2005), which held that Congress may regulate even locally grown marijuana under its commerce power.

**Religious Freedom**: The Religious Freedom Restoration Act (42 U.S.C. Section 2000bb) provides a statutory framework for religious use exemptions, as established in *Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal*, 546 U.S. 418 (2006). Any scheduling reform must preserve existing religious use protections.

**Due Process**: Schedule I classification has been challenged on due process grounds by arguing that the "no accepted medical use" criterion is irrational in light of FDA Breakthrough Therapy designations. Courts have generally deferred to the DEA's scheduling authority, but the growing evidence base strengthens future legal challenges.

### Preemption

Federal rescheduling from Schedule I to Schedule II or III would resolve the current conflict between federal law and state programs in Oregon and Colorado. The proposed legislation includes a savings clause preserving state authority to establish additional therapeutic access programs consistent with federal minimum standards. Federal law would set a floor, not a ceiling.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance would be ensured through a combination of:

- FDA REMS requirements for approved therapies
- DEA enforcement of scheduling and diversion provisions
- State licensing and inspection of therapy centers
- Adverse event reporting systems (FDA MedWatch)
- Professional licensing board oversight of certified practitioners

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| DEA delays rescheduling despite 12-month deadline | DEA could interpret "initiate proceedings" narrowly and extend the process through procedural steps | High | Add judicial review provision allowing mandamus action if DEA misses deadline; include automatic rescheduling trigger |
| "Deemed approved" research licensing circumvented | DEA could request additional information at 29 days, resetting the clock | Medium | Specify that requests for additional information do not toll the 60-day final disposition deadline |
| Insurance coverage denied as "experimental" | Insurers could classify psychedelic therapy as experimental despite FDA approval to avoid coverage | High | Add explicit prohibition on denying coverage for FDA-approved therapies on experimental grounds; establish administrative penalty |
| Practitioners operate without proper certification | Providers could offer "psychedelic coaching" or "integration services" outside the certification framework | Medium | Define prohibited practices clearly; establish cease-and-desist authority; fund enforcement |
| Patent monopolies drive up costs | Pharmaceutical companies could patent therapy protocols, delivery methods, or synthetic variants to create monopolies | High | Add provisions limiting method-of-use patents for naturally occurring compounds; require reasonable pricing as condition of federal research support |
| Local opt-outs create access deserts | Widespread local opt-outs (as in Oregon, where ~100 jurisdictions opted out) could deny access to rural populations | Medium | Require state-level minimum access standards; fund telehealth preparation and integration sessions; limit opt-outs to a percentage of jurisdictions |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| Workforce shortage | Insufficient trained therapists to meet demand in first 3-5 years | New certification framework; lengthy training requirements | Phase implementation; fund accelerated training programs; allow supervised practice under provisional certification |
| Cost of therapy sessions | Multi-hour supervised sessions inherently expensive ($1,500-3,500+) | Labor-intensive therapy model | Insurance coverage mandate; group therapy research; community-based delivery models; sliding-scale requirements |
| Limited diversity in evidence base | Clinical trial participants disproportionately white and educated | Historical research enrollment patterns; institutional barriers | Diversity requirements in federally funded research; community-based recruitment; culturally competent study design |
| Unresolved federal-state tension during transition | State programs operate in legal gray area until rescheduling | Federal Schedule I classification | Interim access provision in Section 4(c); DOJ non-enforcement guidance |
| Incomplete coverage of all psychedelic compounds | Bill focuses on substances with FDA Breakthrough designation; excludes LSD, ibogaine, ayahuasca | Evidence base varies by compound | Include mechanism for adding compounds as evidence accumulates; allow Secretary to expand covered substances by rule |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Automatic rescheduling trigger**: Add provision that if the DEA fails to complete rescheduling within 18 months of FDA approval, the substance is automatically rescheduled to the classification recommended by the Secretary of HHS.
2. **Anti-evergreening provisions**: Add patent reform provisions preventing pharmaceutical companies from extending monopolies through trivial modifications to psychedelic therapy protocols.
3. **Access floor requirement**: Require states to ensure that at least 75% of the population lives within 100 miles of a licensed psychedelic therapy provider as a condition of receiving federal mental health funding.
4. **Compound expansion mechanism**: Authorize the Secretary to add additional psychedelic substances to the regulated therapy framework through expedited rulemaking when clinical evidence meets specified thresholds.
5. **Diversity enforcement**: Require that no federally funded psychedelic clinical trial receive continued funding if its participant demographics deviate by more than 20 percentage points from the demographic composition of the target patient population.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

The legislation should include:

- **5-year comprehensive review**: GAO evaluation of program implementation, access, safety outcomes, equity, and cost-effectiveness, with recommendations for amendments
- **10-year reauthorization**: Research funding and certification program funding subject to reauthorization, ensuring Congressional oversight
- **Annual reporting**: Secretary's annual report to Congress with outcome data, adverse events, and access metrics
