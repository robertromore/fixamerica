# Psychedelics Policy: Stakeholders

The psychedelics policy landscape is shaped by the interactions of patients, researchers, clinicians, indigenous communities, government agencies, pharmaceutical companies, and advocacy organizations, each with distinct interests, resources, and levels of power.

## Who Is Affected

### Primary Stakeholders

| Group | Impact | Size | Key Interests |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|
| Patients with treatment-resistant depression | Denied access to potentially effective therapy by Schedule I barriers | ~8.9 million adults (STAR*D estimates, NIMH) | Access to FDA-approved psilocybin therapy; insurance coverage; affordable treatment |
| Individuals with PTSD | Limited to conventional therapies with high failure/dropout rates | ~13 million adults in any year (NIMH, 2023) | Access to MDMA-assisted therapy; VA coverage for veterans |
| Veterans with PTSD | High suicide rates; conventional treatment dropout rates ~50% | ~1.7 million receiving VA PTSD care (VA NCPTSD, 2024) | VA research funding; therapeutic access; coverage through VA healthcare |
| Patients with substance use disorders | Promising psilocybin evidence for alcohol and tobacco addiction | 48.7 million with SUD (SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024) | Expanded research; treatment access for addiction |
| Patients with end-of-life anxiety | Psilocybin shows durable benefit for cancer-related distress | ~1.9 million new cancer diagnoses/year (ACS, 2024) | Compassionate access; palliative care integration |
| Indigenous communities | Cultural practices affected by scheduling, commercialization threats | NAC membership: 250,000-400,000; broader indigenous psychedelic traditions | Protection of ceremonial use; peyote conservation; benefit-sharing; cultural sovereignty |

### Secondary Stakeholders

- **Family members of patients**: Approximately 40-60 million Americans have a close family member with treatment-resistant mental illness. Family members bear caregiving burdens and are directly affected by treatment outcomes.
- **Employers and the economy**: Mental illness costs U.S. employers an estimated $210 billion annually in absenteeism, reduced productivity, and healthcare costs (National Alliance on Mental Illness, 2023). Effective new treatments benefit employers and the broader economy.
- **Criminal justice system**: Psychedelic-related arrests, while less common than cannabis arrests, still occur. Decriminalization and legalization would reduce law enforcement and court caseloads.
- **General public**: Public safety concerns about unregulated psychedelic use; interest in access to mental health treatments; taxpayer stake in research funding decisions.

## Who Has Power

### Decision Makers

| Actor | Role | Authority | Resources | Influence Level |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) | Scheduling authority; research licensing | Can schedule/reschedule substances (21 U.S.C. Section 811); issues research registrations | $3.3 billion budget (FY2024); 10,000+ employees | High |
| Food and Drug Administration (FDA) | Drug approval; clinical trial oversight | Approves NDAs; grants Breakthrough Therapy designation; issues guidance | $6.9 billion budget (FY2024) | High |
| U.S. Congress | Legislation; appropriations; oversight | Can amend CSA; direct agencies; appropriate research funding | Legislative authority | High |
| National Institutes of Health (NIDA/NIMH) | Research funding | Fund grants; operate Drug Supply Program | NIDA: $1.6 billion; NIMH: $2.4 billion (FY2024) | Medium-High |
| Department of Veterans Affairs | Veteran healthcare; research | Can fund and conduct psychedelic research for veterans | $325 billion total budget (FY2024) | Medium-High |
| State legislatures | State-level scheduling, regulation | Can create state regulatory programs (Oregon, Colorado model) | Varies by state | Medium |
| Oregon Health Authority | Psilocybin services regulation | Licenses service centers, facilitators; sets program rules | Oregon program budget | Medium (within Oregon) |

### Key Organizations and Institutions

- **MAPS (Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies)**: Founded 1986 by Rick Doblin. The single most important organizational driver of psychedelic research revival. Sponsored MDMA Phase 3 trials. Raised over $130 million for MDMA research. Created Lykos Therapeutics as its pharmaceutical arm. Influence: Very High.
- **Compass Pathways**: UK-based pharmaceutical company developing psilocybin therapy (COMP360) for treatment-resistant depression. Funded by investors including Peter Thiel. Controversial for seeking patents on psilocybin therapy protocols. Market cap fluctuated from $1.5 billion peak to ~$300 million (2024). Influence: High.
- **Usona Institute**: Nonprofit funding psilocybin research for major depressive disorder. Received FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation in 2019. Operates on a public benefit model (no patents on psilocybin itself). Influence: Medium-High.
- **Johns Hopkins Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research**: Premier academic research center. Founded 2019 with $17 million in private donations. Led by Matthew Johnson and Roland Griffiths (d. 2023). Published foundational studies. Influence: High (scientific credibility).
- **Drug Policy Alliance**: Major drug policy reform advocacy organization. Supports broad decriminalization and has been involved in state ballot initiatives. Influence: Medium-High.
- **Heroic Hearts Project**: Nonprofit connecting veterans with psychedelic therapy. Key bridge between veteran advocacy and psychedelic reform. Influence: Medium (growing).

### Influencers

- **Veteran advocacy organizations**: Veterans' groups including Heroic Hearts Project, Veterans Exploring Treatment Solutions (VETS), and American Legion (which passed a resolution supporting psychedelic research in 2022) have emerged as politically influential advocates. Their bipartisan credibility is significant.
- **Psychedelic therapy practitioners**: Licensed facilitators in Oregon and underground therapists shape public perception of psychedelic therapy through direct patient experience.
- **Public intellectuals and media**: Michael Pollan's *How to Change Your Mind* (2018) reached mainstream audiences through a bestselling book and Netflix documentary. Tim Ferriss has funded psychedelic research ($5+ million donated to Hopkins, Imperial College, UCSF) and used his media platform to popularize the field.
- **Tech industry leaders**: Silicon Valley figures including Steve Jobs (who credited LSD as among his most important life experiences), Tim Ferriss, and Sergey Brin have provided funding and cultural legitimacy to psychedelic research.

## Stakeholder Interests and Alignment

### Aligned Interests (Potential Coalition Partners)

| Coalition | Shared Interest | Strength |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Veterans' groups + bipartisan lawmakers | Therapeutic access for PTSD; veteran suicide prevention | Strong |
| Patients + researchers + clinicians | Expanded research funding; FDA-approved therapies | Strong |
| Libertarians + progressives | Individual freedom to use psychedelics; end prohibition | Moderate |
| Oregon/Colorado regulators + public health advocates | Evidence-based state regulatory models | Moderate |
| Indigenous communities + religious liberty advocates | Protection of ceremonial psychedelic use | Moderate |
| Psychedelic companies + patients | FDA approval pathway; insurance coverage | Moderate (interests may diverge on pricing) |

### Conflicting Interests

- **Medical model vs. broad access**: Pharmaceutical companies and FDA advocates want psychedelics channeled through the medical system (prescription, clinical settings), while decriminalization advocates want adults to have access without medical gatekeeping. Oregon's service center model represents a middle ground.
- **Indigenous rights vs. commercialization**: The National Council of Native American Churches has called for peyote to be excluded from decriminalization measures to protect limited supply. Indigenous communities are concerned about cultural appropriation and commercialization of traditional practices without benefit-sharing.
- **Patent holders vs. open access advocates**: Compass Pathways and other companies have filed patents on psychedelic therapy protocols, raising concerns about monopolization and high pricing. Open-access advocates argue that naturally occurring compounds and traditional practices should not be patentable.
- **DEA enforcement mission vs. therapeutic access**: The DEA's institutional interest in maintaining scheduling authority conflicts with the research and therapeutic access interests of patients, researchers, and clinicians.

### The Research-Access Power Structure

The psychedelic policy landscape features an unusual power dynamic:

- **Gatekeepers** (DEA, FDA, Congress) hold formal authority but are subject to increasing political pressure from stakeholders
- **Knowledge producers** (researchers, clinicians) generate the evidence that drives policy change but lack direct regulatory authority
- **Patients and advocates** generate political will but lack institutional power
- **Private capital** (pharmaceutical companies, investors) funds the research that feeds the FDA pathway but makes decisions based on return on investment rather than public health need
- **State governments** are creating regulatory facts on the ground that pressure federal reform

## Influence Mechanisms

How stakeholders exert influence on psychedelic policy:

- **Lobbying**: The psychedelic sector's lobbying presence is growing but still small relative to the pharmaceutical industry. In 2023, psychedelic-related lobbying spending was estimated at $2-5 million, compared to the pharmaceutical industry's $374 million in total lobbying (OpenSecrets, 2024).
- **Campaign Contributions**: Psychedelic reform PACs are emerging. New Approach PAC (which supported cannabis and psychedelic ballot initiatives) has spent millions on Oregon and Colorado campaigns.
- **Scientific Publications**: The primary influence mechanism for the research community. High-impact publications in *NEJM*, *JAMA*, *Nature Medicine*, and *Lancet Psychiatry* shape FDA decision-making, public opinion, and legislative attention.
- **Media and Public Advocacy**: Michael Pollan's *How to Change Your Mind*, Netflix documentaries, and mainstream media coverage have shifted public opinion. Major outlets (New York Times, Washington Post, 60 Minutes) have produced favorable coverage of psychedelic research.
- **Veteran Advocacy**: The American Legion's 2022 resolution supporting psychedelic research and the Heroic Hearts Project's Congressional testimony have created bipartisan political cover for reform. Veterans are among the most politically sympathetic constituencies in American politics.
- **State Ballot Initiatives**: Direct democracy has been the most effective mechanism for psychedelic policy change to date (Denver Initiative 301, Oregon Measure 109, Colorado Proposition 122).
- **Legal Challenges**: Religious freedom litigation (UDV, Santo Daime) has created legal precedents for psychedelic use outside the medical model. Right-to-try and compassionate use legal challenges are emerging.
