# Psychedelics Policy: Overview

## Overview

Psychedelic substances -- psilocybin (the active compound in "magic mushrooms"), MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), DMT/ayahuasca, mescaline, and ibogaine -- represent one of the most significant frontiers in mental health treatment and drug policy reform. After more than five decades of near-total prohibition under Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), a growing body of rigorous clinical evidence has demonstrated that several psychedelic compounds, administered in controlled therapeutic settings, produce substantial and durable improvements for conditions that resist conventional treatment: treatment-resistant depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), substance use disorders, end-of-life anxiety, and obsessive-compulsive disorder.

The modern psychedelic renaissance is driven by institutional science, not counterculture advocacy. Johns Hopkins University, New York University, Imperial College London, Yale, the University of California system, and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs have conducted or funded clinical trials. The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to psilocybin therapy for treatment-resistant depression in 2018 and for major depressive disorder in 2019, and to MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD in 2017. In August 2024, the FDA declined to approve Lykos Therapeutics' New Drug Application for MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD, citing concerns about clinical trial methodology, but the underlying science continues to advance through additional trials and expanded access programs.

State-level policy has outpaced federal reform. Oregon's Measure 109 (2020) created the first regulated psilocybin therapy program in the United States, with licensed service centers beginning operations in 2023. Colorado's Natural Medicine Health Act (Proposition 122, 2022) established a broader framework encompassing psilocybin, DMT, ibogaine, and mescaline (excluding peyote). More than a dozen cities -- including Denver, Oakland, Santa Cruz, Seattle, Ann Arbor, and Washington, D.C. -- have decriminalized psychedelic plants and fungi. Yet the fundamental federal-state conflict created by Schedule I classification persists, creating legal uncertainty for patients, providers, and researchers.

The core challenge of psychedelics policy is reconciling legitimate public safety concerns with the imperative to make effective treatments available to millions of Americans suffering from treatment-resistant mental health conditions. An estimated 8.9 million adults in the United States have treatment-resistant depression (STAR*D trial estimates, NIMH, 2006), and approximately 13 million adults have PTSD in any given year (NIMH, 2023). Current treatments fail a substantial share of these patients. The question is not whether psychedelics deserve serious policy attention, but how to construct a regulatory framework that maximizes therapeutic access while ensuring safety, equity, and scientific integrity.

## Scope

This analysis covers the key aspects of psychedelics policy:

- **Therapeutic Research and FDA Pathway**: Clinical trial evidence for psilocybin, MDMA, LSD, and other psychedelics; FDA Breakthrough Therapy designations; the New Drug Application process; and the path to potential approval
- **Federal Scheduling and Classification**: The impact of Schedule I status on research, clinical access, and state programs; rescheduling and descheduling options under the Controlled Substances Act
- **State and Local Reform**: Oregon Measure 109, Colorado Proposition 122, municipal decriminalization resolutions, and emerging state legislative proposals
- **Religious and Indigenous Use**: The American Indian Religious Freedom Act, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, Native American Church peyote exemptions, and ayahuasca church litigation
- **Access, Equity, and Cost**: Ensuring that psychedelic therapies are affordable, covered by insurance, and accessible across race, income, and geography
- **Safety and Regulation**: Therapist training standards, adverse event monitoring, contraindications, and prevention of recreational market harms

## Key Facts

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| FDA Breakthrough Therapy designations for psychedelics | 3 (psilocybin x2, MDMA x1) | FDA, 2017-2019 |
| Estimated U.S. adults with treatment-resistant depression | 8.9 million | STAR*D trial estimates, NIMH, 2006 |
| U.S. adults with PTSD in a given year | ~13 million | NIMH, 2023 |
| Psilocybin clinical trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov | >100 | ClinicalTrials.gov, 2024 |
| MDMA-assisted therapy PTSD remission rate (Phase 3 trial) | 71.2% at 18-month follow-up | Mitchell et al., *Nature Medicine*, 2023 |
| States with legal psilocybin therapy frameworks | 2 (Oregon, Colorado) | Oregon Measure 109; Colorado Prop 122 |
| Cities/jurisdictions that have decriminalized psychedelics | 15+ | Drug Policy Alliance, 2024 |
| Oregon psilocybin service center licenses issued (by end 2024) | ~30 | Oregon Psilocybin Services, 2024 |
| Estimated cost of a single psilocybin therapy session (Oregon) | $1,500-$3,500 | Oregon Psilocybin Services, 2024 |
| Veterans with PTSD receiving VA care | ~1.7 million | VA National Center for PTSD, 2024 |

## Core Tensions and Tradeoffs

- **Schedule I vs. Scientific Evidence**: Federal law classifies psychedelics as having "no currently accepted medical use" and "high potential for abuse," directly contradicting the growing clinical evidence base. Rescheduling enables research but may not address the full scope of therapeutic access; descheduling raises concerns about unregulated recreational markets.
- **Speed of Access vs. Regulatory Rigor**: Patients with treatment-resistant conditions suffer and die while the FDA approval process proceeds over years. Expedited pathways risk undermining safety data; standard timelines delay access to potentially life-saving treatments.
- **Medical Model vs. Broader Access**: Restricting psychedelics to FDA-approved, clinician-supervised therapy ensures safety but limits access and drives costs up. Oregon's "service center" model and religious use frameworks offer broader access but with less clinical oversight.
- **Indigenous Rights vs. Commercialization**: Indigenous communities have used peyote, ayahuasca, and psilocybin mushrooms for centuries. The commercialization of psychedelic therapy raises concerns about cultural appropriation, resource depletion (particularly for slow-growing peyote), and exclusion of indigenous communities from economic benefits.
- **Federal Uniformity vs. State Innovation**: State-level programs in Oregon and Colorado are generating real-world data on regulated access, but the federal-state conflict creates legal risk, banking challenges, and interstate commerce barriers analogous to those in cannabis policy.
- **Public Safety vs. Individual Liberty**: Some argue that adults should have the right to use psychedelics without state permission, while others emphasize the risks of unsupervised use, psychological crises, and vulnerability to exploitation in unregulated settings.

## Key Questions

1. How should the federal scheduling system be reformed to reflect the scientific evidence on psychedelics' therapeutic potential while maintaining appropriate safety controls?
2. What regulatory framework best balances therapeutic access, patient safety, affordability, and equity -- the FDA pharmaceutical model, the Oregon service center model, or a hybrid approach?
3. How can psychedelic therapy be made affordable and accessible to underserved communities, including veterans, low-income patients, and communities of color, rather than becoming a luxury treatment?
4. How should federal policy protect indigenous religious practices and traditional knowledge while allowing broader therapeutic and research access to psychedelic compounds?

## Vision of Success

A successful psychedelics policy framework in the 21st century would feature:

- **Evidence-Based Scheduling**: Psychedelic compounds classified based on scientific evidence of medical utility and safety profiles, not political stigma, with Schedule I status revised for substances with demonstrated therapeutic value
- **Regulated Therapeutic Access**: FDA-approved psychedelic-assisted therapies available through the healthcare system, covered by insurance, and accessible to patients who have not responded to conventional treatments
- **Robust Research Infrastructure**: Streamlined DEA licensing, adequate NIDA supply of research-grade compounds, and federal funding for large-scale clinical trials across diverse patient populations
- **Equitable Access**: Sliding-scale pricing, Medicaid and VA coverage, community-based delivery models, and workforce training programs that ensure psychedelic therapy is not restricted to affluent, white, urban populations
- **Indigenous Protections**: Legal safeguards for traditional religious use, benefit-sharing agreements with indigenous communities, and peyote conservation programs
- **Safety Framework**: Comprehensive therapist training and certification standards, adverse event reporting systems, patient screening protocols, and enforcement against unlicensed practitioners
