# Psychedelics Policy: What You Can Do

Psychedelic policy reform is advancing rapidly at the state and local level, but federal change requires sustained citizen engagement. The gap between scientific evidence and federal policy creates an urgent need for informed advocacy. Whether you are a patient, veteran, healthcare professional, or concerned citizen, there are concrete actions you can take to support evidence-based psychedelic reform.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- Read Michael Pollan's *How to Change Your Mind* (2018) for an accessible introduction to psychedelic science and history
- Follow the MAPS Bulletin (quarterly publication from the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies) for updates on clinical trials and policy developments
- Review the FDA's 2023 draft guidance on psychedelic drug development to understand the federal regulatory pathway
- Track clinical trial results on ClinicalTrials.gov by searching "psilocybin" or "MDMA"
- Follow STAT News psychedelics coverage for rigorous, independent health journalism on the topic

### Make Personal Changes

- If you or a family member has treatment-resistant depression, PTSD, or substance use disorder, discuss psychedelic-assisted therapy research with your healthcare provider
- Ask your healthcare provider whether clinical trial enrollment might be appropriate (ClinicalTrials.gov lists active studies with eligibility criteria and enrollment locations)
- If you are a veteran, contact the Heroic Hearts Project or Veterans Exploring Treatment Solutions (VETS) for information on psychedelic therapy access programs
- Educate yourself about the risks and safety considerations of psychedelics before forming policy opinions -- the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies and the Johns Hopkins Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research publish accessible safety information

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact Your Representatives**: Urge your U.S. Senators and Representative to support federal psychedelic research funding, DEA research licensing reform, and evidence-based scheduling policy. The most effective advocacy is specific: reference particular bills, funding levels, or policy actions.
- **Submit Public Comments**: When the FDA, DEA, or HHS issue proposed rules or guidance related to psychedelics, submit public comments. The FDA's public comment process is accessible at Regulations.gov.
- **Write Letters to the Editor**: Local newspapers and online publications are influential in shaping public opinion. Write about the therapeutic potential of psychedelics, citing clinical trial data, or share a personal story about treatment-resistant mental illness.
- **Share Information**: Share credible research findings and policy developments with your social networks. Emphasize clinical evidence and patient stories rather than recreational use narratives.

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- Form or join a local psychedelic society chapter -- organizations like Students for Sensible Drug Policy (SSDP) and Decriminalize Nature have active local chapters in many cities
- Host educational events featuring researchers, clinicians, or patients who have participated in psychedelic therapy clinical trials
- Partner with local mental health advocacy organizations (NAMI chapters, Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance) to raise awareness of psychedelic therapy research
- If you live in a city that has not yet addressed psychedelic decriminalization, organize a community education campaign modeled on successful efforts in Denver, Oakland, and other cities

### Build Coalitions

- Connect psychedelic reform advocacy with veteran service organizations -- many American Legion posts have passed resolutions supporting psychedelic research
- Engage faith communities -- some religious leaders have supported psychedelic research as a means of alleviating suffering, and indigenous religious use provides a bridge to religious liberty advocates
- Build relationships with local healthcare providers and mental health professionals who may be supportive of psychedelic therapy research
- Work with local government officials to understand the decriminalization process in your jurisdiction

## Political Actions

### Contact Elected Officials

**When to Contact**:

- When psychedelic-related bills are introduced or moved through committee in Congress or your state legislature
- During the annual federal appropriations process (advocate for NIH and VA psychedelic research funding)
- When the FDA or DEA issue guidance, proposed rules, or make scheduling decisions related to psychedelics
- During election season -- ask candidates about their positions on psychedelic therapy and drug scheduling reform

**What to Say -- Template Email**:

```
Subject: Support Evidence-Based Psychedelic Therapy Research and Reform

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

I am writing as your constituent from [City, State] to urge you to support federal policy reforms that would expand access to psychedelic-assisted therapy for Americans with treatment-resistant mental health conditions.

The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression and to MDMA for PTSD, reflecting the significant clinical evidence that these therapies can help patients who have not responded to conventional treatments. An estimated 8.9 million Americans have treatment-resistant depression, and approximately 13 million adults have PTSD in any given year. Veterans are disproportionately affected: 1.7 million veterans receive VA care for PTSD, and 17.5 veterans die by suicide every day.

I urge you to:
1. Support increased federal funding for psychedelic therapy research through NIH and the VA
2. Co-sponsor legislation to streamline DEA research licensing for psychedelic studies
3. Support evidence-based scheduling reform so that substances with demonstrated therapeutic value are not trapped in Schedule I

Thank you for your service and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say -- Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City]. I'm calling to urge [Representative/Senator] [Last Name] to support federal psychedelic therapy research funding and scheduling reform. The FDA has recognized the breakthrough potential of psilocybin and MDMA for treatment-resistant depression and PTSD. I'd like the [Representative/Senator] to support increased NIH and VA research funding and evidence-based scheduling reform. Can you please note my position? Thank you."
```

### Support Legislation

Current or proposed legislation to support:

- **Breakthrough Therapies Act**: Would require expedited DEA review of scheduling for substances with FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation -- contact your Senators and Representative to co-sponsor
- **Veterans Access to Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy Act**: Would fund VA research on psychedelic therapies for PTSD -- especially important for members of the Senate and House Veterans Affairs Committees
- **Right to Try Psychedelics Act**: Would clarify that the federal Right to Try Act applies to psychedelic therapies in development -- contact House Energy & Commerce Committee members
- **State-level legislation**: If your state is considering psychedelic therapy or decriminalization legislation, contact your state legislators with information about Oregon and Colorado's programs

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "Do you support increased federal funding for psychedelic-assisted therapy research through NIH and the VA?"
2. "Would you support rescheduling psychedelics that receive FDA approval from Schedule I to a schedule that permits medical use?"
3. "What is your position on Oregon's and Colorado's regulated psychedelic therapy programs?"
4. "How would you address the mental health treatment gap for the millions of Americans with treatment-resistant depression and PTSD?"

**Voting Considerations**:

- Look for candidates who support evidence-based drug policy and mental health reform
- Key committees: Senate HELP Committee, House Energy & Commerce Committee, Senate and House Veterans Affairs Committees, Senate and House Appropriations Committees (Labor-HHS-Education Subcommittee)
- Bipartisan support is essential -- psychedelic reform has drawn support from both parties, particularly on veteran-focused research

## Professional Actions

- **For Healthcare Providers**: Stay informed about psychedelic therapy research. Consider incorporating knowledge of psychedelic-assisted therapy into clinical practice (preparation and integration therapy can be provided within existing licensure). Support colleagues pursuing psychedelic research.
- **For Researchers**: Apply for NIH/NIDA/NIMH funding for psychedelic research. Collaborate with established psychedelic research centers. Include diverse populations in study designs.
- **For Mental Health Professionals**: Pursue psychedelic therapy training through programs at institutions like the California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS), Naropa University, or MAPS. Advocate within professional organizations (APA, AMA) for evidence-based positions on psychedelic therapy.
- **For Attorneys**: Provide pro bono legal support to psychedelic reform organizations. Assist with religious liberty cases. Support Right to Try legal challenges.
- **For Veterans**: Share your experience with elected officials. Participate in clinical trials at VA medical centers. Advocate through veteran service organizations.

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing psychedelic policy reform with others, emphasize:

1. **Clinical evidence is substantial**: The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to psilocybin (2018, 2019) and MDMA (2017), recognizing "substantial improvement" over existing treatments. Phase 2 and 3 trials at Johns Hopkins, NYU, and other leading institutions demonstrate significant efficacy for treatment-resistant depression and PTSD.
2. **Millions of Americans need better treatments**: An estimated 8.9 million adults have treatment-resistant depression and ~13 million have PTSD. Current treatments fail a substantial share of these patients. Psychedelic therapy offers a new option.
3. **Veterans are a priority population**: 1.7 million veterans receive VA care for PTSD, and 17.5 veterans die by suicide every day. MDMA-assisted therapy showed 71.2% of participants no longer meeting PTSD diagnostic criteria in Phase 3 trials.
4. **This is a medical and scientific issue**: Psychedelic reform is about evidence-based medicine, not counterculture politics. Leading medical institutions and the FDA itself recognize the therapeutic potential.

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "Psychedelics are highly addictive" | Classical psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD) produce rapid tolerance, do not cause physical dependence, and have among the lowest addiction potential of any psychoactive substances | Nutt et al., *Lancet*, 2010 (drug harm ranking) |
| "Psychedelics are extremely dangerous" | Psilocybin mushrooms had the lowest rate of emergency medical treatment (0.2%) of any recreational drug surveyed by the Global Drug Survey (2017). No deaths have occurred from psilocybin or LSD in clinical trials. | Global Drug Survey, 2017 |
| "There is no medical evidence for psychedelics" | The FDA itself granted 3 Breakthrough Therapy designations for psychedelic therapies (2017-2019), a designation reserved for substances showing "substantial improvement" over existing treatments | FDA, 2017-2019 |
| "Legalizing psychedelics means everyone would use them unsupervised" | Reform proposals focus on regulated therapeutic access (FDA-approved therapy, state service center models) with trained practitioners, not unregulated recreational use | Oregon Measure 109; Colorado Prop 122 |
| "Psychedelic reform is just about getting high" | Modern psychedelic reform is driven by institutional science (Johns Hopkins, NYU, VA) and focused on treating treatment-resistant depression, PTSD, addiction, and end-of-life distress | Goodwin et al., *NEJM*, 2022; Mitchell et al., *Nature Medicine*, 2023 |
