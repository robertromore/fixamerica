# Psychedelics Policy: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

The implementation strategy for psychedelic policy reform follows a sequenced, evidence-building approach that leverages bipartisan opportunities, accumulates regulatory precedents, and builds institutional capacity. Each phase creates the political and evidentiary foundation for the next. The strategy begins with the most politically viable actions (veteran-focused research, DEA process reform) and progresses toward comprehensive regulatory reform (rescheduling, insurance coverage, national access framework).

The key strategic insight is that FDA approval of a psychedelic-assisted therapy is the single most important enabler of broader reform. Once the FDA declares that a psychedelic substance has an "accepted medical use," the legal basis for Schedule I classification collapses, creating irresistible pressure for rescheduling. The roadmap is therefore organized around accelerating the path to FDA approval while simultaneously building the infrastructure (workforce, coverage, safety systems) needed to translate approval into equitable patient access.

## Governance and Oversight

Implementation oversight should be structured as follows:

- **Interagency Psychedelic Policy Task Force** (Phase 1): Chaired by HHS Secretary, including FDA, DEA, SAMHSA, VA, DOI, and NIH. Responsible for coordinating federal policy, resolving interagency conflicts, and reporting to Congress annually.
- **National Psychedelic Therapy Advisory Committee** (Phase 2): Appointed by HHS Secretary, including researchers, clinicians, patients, indigenous representatives, ethicists, and public members. Advises on training standards, access policies, and safety monitoring.
- **Congressional oversight**: Senate HELP Committee and House Energy & Commerce Committee should hold annual hearings on program implementation.
- **GAO evaluation**: Congress should mandate GAO evaluation at Years 3, 5, and 10.

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: FDA Delays or Rejects Psychedelic Therapy Applications

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Diversify the pipeline. Support multiple sponsors pursuing different psychedelic therapies for different indications. Fund additional Phase 3 trials to generate robust data. Engage FDA early and often through pre-NDA meetings and advisory committee interactions.

**Contingency Plan**: If FDA approval is delayed, pursue expanded access programs (compassionate use), support state-level regulated access models, and continue building the evidence base through federally funded research.

### Risk 2: Political Backlash Against Psychedelic Reform

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium-High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Maintain bipartisan framing centered on veterans, treatment-resistant patients, and scientific evidence. Avoid association with broader drug legalization. Build support among conservative constituencies through faith-based recovery and individual liberty arguments.

**Contingency Plan**: If federal reform stalls, focus on state-level progress and executive branch administrative actions (DEA research licensing, VA research funding, FDA guidance) that do not require legislation.

### Risk 3: Safety Incident Generates Negative Publicity

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Invest heavily in safety infrastructure: robust screening protocols, trained practitioners, adverse event monitoring, and facility standards. Proactively communicate known risks and mitigation strategies.

**Contingency Plan**: Respond transparently to incidents with data on overall safety record. Strengthen safety protocols as needed. Do not allow individual incidents to derail evidence-based policy.

### Risk 4: Equity Failures -- Therapy Accessible Only to Wealthy Patients

**Likelihood**: High (without intervention)

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Build equity into the regulatory framework from the outset: insurance coverage mandates, Medicaid inclusion, community-based delivery models, sliding-scale pricing requirements, diverse workforce training.

**Contingency Plan**: If private market access is inequitable, expand publicly funded programs through SAMHSA and community health centers.

### Risk 5: Indigenous Resource Depletion and Cultural Harm

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium-High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Exclude peyote from commercial access frameworks. Fund conservation programs. Establish benefit-sharing agreements. Include indigenous representatives in all advisory and regulatory bodies.

**Contingency Plan**: If commercial demand threatens indigenous resources, impose supply management regulations and increase conservation funding.
