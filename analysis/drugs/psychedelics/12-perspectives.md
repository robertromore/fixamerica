# Psychedelics Policy: Political Perspectives Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes psychedelic policy through nine distinct political perspectives, evaluating current state assessments, root cause analyses, proposed solutions, and legislation. Each perspective receives engagement consistency ratings and position scores, culminating in compromise proposals that bridge multiple viewpoints.

Psychedelics policy raises fundamental questions about the proper role of government in regulating what individuals put in their own bodies, the relationship between scientific evidence and drug classification, the balance between public safety and therapeutic access, and the tension between commercial pharmaceutical development and individual freedom. Different political traditions approach these questions from distinct philosophical foundations, creating an unusually complex coalition landscape where libertarians and progressives may agree on access while disagreeing on regulation, and where conservatives find themselves divided between law-and-order instincts and veteran advocacy.

Different political traditions offer distinct visions for how to approach psychedelics policy. This analysis examines the issue through 9 distinct political perspectives, exploring how each tradition approaches the core questions and proposed solutions.

## Perspective Definitions

| Perspective | Core Values | Policy Orientation |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Tradition, limited government, individual responsibility | Incremental change, fiscal restraint, market solutions |
| Liberal | Progress, equality, social responsibility | Government as problem-solver, regulation, safety nets |
| Progressive | Systemic change, economic justice, structural reform | Transformative reform, wealth redistribution, worker power |
| Libertarian | Individual liberty, minimal state, free markets | Deregulation, privatization, voluntary association |
| Constitutionalist | Original intent, enumerated powers, federalism | Strict constitutional limits, states' rights |
| Populist | Anti-elite, pro-worker, economic nationalism | Trade protection, anti-monopoly, immigration restriction |
| Centrist | Pragmatism, compromise, incremental progress | Bipartisan solutions, evidence-based policy |
| Religious Right | Faith-based values, traditional morality | Social conservatism, religious liberty |
| Democratic Socialist | Worker ownership, public goods, democratic control | Public investment, labor rights, universal programs |

## Scoring Framework

### Position Scores (1-10)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10 | Full agreement with project analysis |
| 7-9 | Substantial to strong agreement |
| 5-6 | Mixed/moderate agreement |
| 3-4 | Substantial disagreement |
| 1-2 | Strong opposition |

### Engagement Consistency (1-5)

This metric assesses how reliably a perspective's stated positions align with its underlying principles, and how stable those positions are when concerns are addressed. Higher scores indicate more predictable negotiating partners.

| Level | Label | Indicators |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 5 | Highly Consistent | Stated positions reflect underlying principles; positions stable when concerns addressed |
| 4 | Mostly Consistent | Principles generally align with positions; minor strategic flexibility |
| 3 | Mixed Consistency | Some positions principled, others reflect coalition pressures or unstated concerns |
| 2 | Low Consistency | Positions shift frequently; stated concerns differ from underlying priorities |
| 1 | Unpredictable | Positions appear driven primarily by opposition dynamics rather than principles |

**Coalition-Building Considerations:**

- Alignment gap: When stated concerns differ from underlying priorities, addressing stated concerns may not secure support
- Position stability: Perspectives with shifting positions require ongoing negotiation
- Principle consistency: Perspectives that apply principles uniformly are more predictable partners
- Internal diversity: Some perspectives contain factions with different priorities

### Legislation Status Reference (as of January 2025)

| Bill/Amendment | Type | Current Status | Last Action |
|----------------|------|----------------|-------------|
| Psychedelic Research and Therapy Access Act (proposed) | Federal | Draft/not introduced | Modeled on existing proposals |
| Model Psychedelic Therapy Services Act | State | Template | Based on OR/CO models |
| Breakthrough Therapies Act (H.R. 7295, 118th) | Federal | Introduced; in committee | Referred to Energy & Commerce |
| Veterans Access to Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy Act | Federal | Introduced; in committee | Referred to Veterans Affairs |

## Perspective Analyses

### Conservative Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Conservatives state concern about public safety and "slippery slope" to drug normalization, but veteran advocacy creates genuine cross-pressure that is authentic |
| Principle consistency | Inconsistent: the "limited government" principle should favor reduced regulation, but "law and order" tradition favors continued prohibition |
| Goalpost stability | Moderate: conservative positions on psychedelics have shifted meaningfully since 2018, driven by veteran suicide data and PTSD treatment outcomes |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low: many conservatives genuinely want veterans to have access to effective PTSD treatments and are willing to support targeted reform |

**Justification:** Conservatives are internally divided on psychedelics. The traditional "tough on drugs" instinct conflicts with the growing recognition that veterans need better PTSD treatments and that Schedule I classification is blocking medical innovation. The veteran advocacy pathway has created real movement in conservative positions, but broader reform (decriminalization, non-medical access) remains opposed.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- The First Step Act (2018), signed by President Trump, demonstrated conservative willingness to reform drug sentencing when framed around specific populations
- The American Legion passed a resolution supporting psychedelic research in 2022, reflecting the influence of veteran advocacy on conservative opinion
- Texas (Republican-led legislature) appropriated $2.8 million for MDMA and psilocybin research for veterans in 2021, renewed in 2023

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Agree that treatment-resistant mental health conditions are a serious problem, especially for veterans; skeptical of characterization of Schedule I as the primary barrier; wary of framing that implies prohibition has failed |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | Reject the characterization of the War on Drugs as racially motivated; skeptical of institutional critique of DEA; agree that bureaucratic barriers impede medical innovation |

**Source references:**

- Heritage Foundation has not published a comprehensive position on psychedelic reform, reflecting internal ambiguity
- R Street Institute (center-right) published "Psychedelic Policy Reform: A Conservative Case" (2023), arguing for research expansion

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Reschedule psychedelics with therapeutic value | 5/10 | Support rescheduling after FDA approval; oppose pre-approval rescheduling | Concern about normalization; support for medical pathway |
| Federal psychedelic therapy access program | 4/10 | Prefer private-sector-led therapy delivery; skeptical of new federal programs | Opposition to government healthcare expansion |
| Expand federal research funding ($200M/5yr) | 7/10 | Support research funding, especially VA-focused | Want funding directed to veterans; concerned about fiscal responsibility |
| Insurance and VA coverage mandates | 4/10 | Support VA coverage; oppose private insurance mandates | Opposition to government mandates on private insurers |
| Indigenous protections program | 5/10 | Support religious liberty protections; cautious on benefit-sharing | Uncomfortable with identity-based policy; support religious freedom |
| Therapist training standards | 6/10 | Support professional standards; prefer market-driven certification | Want rigorous standards; oppose government-run credentialing |
| Decriminalize personal possession | 2/10 | Oppose decriminalization; view as normalization of drug use | Core "law and order" position; slippery slope concern |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Psychedelic Research and Therapy Access Act | 4/10 | Support research and VA provisions; oppose insurance mandates and decriminalization | Prefer narrower veteran-focused bill |
| Model Psychedelic Therapy Services Act | 3/10 | Oppose state-level programs that bypass FDA approval | Prefer federal pharmaceutical pathway over state service center models |

#### Alternative Proposals

Conservatives would support a narrower approach: (1) expanded VA research funding specifically for veterans with PTSD; (2) streamlined DEA research licensing; (3) rescheduling only after FDA approval and only for approved indications; (4) VA coverage for approved therapies; (5) no decriminalization; (6) private-sector-led therapy delivery without new federal programs.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Centrist, Libertarian (on research expansion)
- **Potential bridges:** Liberal, Populist (on veteran-focused reform)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist (on decriminalization and government program design)

### Liberal Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Liberals genuinely support evidence-based medicine and therapeutic access; equity concerns are sincere |
| Principle consistency | Consistent: support for science-based policy, regulated access, and equity aligns with broader liberal principles |
| Goalpost stability | Stable: liberal positions on psychedelics have been consistently supportive of research and regulated therapeutic access |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low: willing to compromise on pace and scope of reform to build bipartisan support |

**Justification:** Liberals are the most natural constituency for psychedelic therapy reform through the medical model. Their commitment to evidence-based policy, regulated access, and equity provisions aligns well with the comprehensive reform framework. Some tension exists between liberal support for FDA regulatory rigor and the desire for faster access.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Democratic members of Congress have introduced multiple psychedelic research and therapy bills (Cory Booker, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Dan Crenshaw -- bipartisan)
- California Governor Newsom's 2023 veto of SB 58 (decriminalization) while supporting therapeutic access reflects liberal preference for regulated access over decriminalization
- The Democratic Party platform has increasingly embraced mental health treatment expansion, which naturally encompasses psychedelic therapy

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Agree that Schedule I impedes research and treatment; accept the mental health crisis framing; may emphasize equity dimensions more |
| Root Cause Agreement | 7/10 | Agree that DEA has improperly controlled scheduling; agree that the War on Drugs was racially motivated; may want more emphasis on pharmaceutical industry role |

**Source references:**

- Center for American Progress supports psychedelic therapy reform within a regulated framework
- Brookings Institution has published favorable analysis of psychedelic therapy regulatory reform (2024)

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Reschedule psychedelics with therapeutic value | 8/10 | Strongly support evidence-based rescheduling | Want robust safety framework alongside rescheduling |
| Federal psychedelic therapy access program | 8/10 | Support comprehensive federal framework | Want strong equity provisions and safety standards |
| Expand federal research funding ($200M/5yr) | 9/10 | Strongly support research investment | Want diversity requirements and public benefit provisions |
| Insurance and VA coverage mandates | 9/10 | Strongly support; consider essential for equity | Want comprehensive coverage including Medicaid |
| Indigenous protections program | 8/10 | Support cultural protections and benefit-sharing | Genuine concern about indigenous rights and cultural appropriation |
| Therapist training standards | 8/10 | Support national standards with diversity requirements | Want accessibility and workforce diversity |
| Decriminalize personal possession | 6/10 | Mixed; support therapeutic decriminalization but cautious on broad personal use | Concerned about unregulated use without safety infrastructure |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Psychedelic Research and Therapy Access Act | 8/10 | Strong support for core provisions; want stronger equity provisions | Would add community health center integration and Medicaid expansion |
| Model Psychedelic Therapy Services Act | 7/10 | Support state innovation with federal minimum standards | Want stronger sliding-scale and diversity requirements |

#### Alternative Proposals

Liberals would enhance the framework by: (1) stronger Medicaid coverage provisions; (2) community health center integration for psychedelic therapy; (3) mandatory diverse clinical trial enrollment; (4) public option for psychedelic therapy delivery to prevent corporate monopolization; (5) expanded workforce diversity programs.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive, Centrist, Democratic Socialist (on access and equity)
- **Potential bridges:** Conservative (on veteran-focused reform), Libertarian (on research expansion)
- **Unlikely partners:** Religious Right (on broad reform)

---

### Progressive Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Progressives genuinely concerned about equity, corporate capture, and access for marginalized communities |
| Principle consistency | Consistent: progressive positions on psychedelics reflect broader commitment to public health over criminalization and equity over market-driven access |
| Goalpost stability | Stable, though progressives may advocate for broader reform (decriminalization, public ownership) than other coalition partners accept |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate: willing to support incremental reform but push for more comprehensive change |

**Justification:** Progressives are strong supporters of psychedelic reform but push for more comprehensive change than the medical model alone. Their emphasis on equity, anti-corporate provisions, and decriminalization goes beyond what centrists and conservatives support. They are reliable coalition partners on core therapeutic access issues but may resist corporate-driven pharmaceutical models.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez co-sponsored psychedelic research legislation with bipartisan support
- Progressive organizations (Drug Policy Alliance) have advocated for both therapeutic access and decriminalization
- Progressive critique of Compass Pathways' patenting strategy reflects genuine concern about corporate capture

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strong agreement with analysis of research barriers, mental health crisis, and racial disparities; would emphasize class and race dimensions more |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | Full agreement that War on Drugs was racially motivated; agree on DEA institutional resistance; want more emphasis on pharmaceutical industry profit motives |

**Source references:**

- Drug Policy Alliance advocacy platform supports comprehensive psychedelic reform including decriminalization
- Progressive Caucus members have supported psychedelic research and broader drug policy reform

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Reschedule psychedelics with therapeutic value | 8/10 | Support, but prefer descheduling over rescheduling for some compounds | Want to go further than Schedule II/III |
| Federal psychedelic therapy access program | 7/10 | Support with public ownership provisions; skeptical of corporate-led model | Concerned about pharmaceutical profiteering |
| Expand federal research funding ($200M/5yr) | 9/10 | Strongly support; want higher funding levels | Want public benefit conditions on funded research |
| Insurance and VA coverage mandates | 9/10 | Strongly support; want single-payer integration | Want universal coverage, not just mandate |
| Indigenous protections program | 9/10 | Strongly support; want robust benefit-sharing | Genuine commitment to indigenous sovereignty and anti-colonialism |
| Therapist training standards | 7/10 | Support, with emphasis on community health workers and non-traditional providers | Want broader practitioner pipeline beyond licensed professionals |
| Decriminalize personal possession | 9/10 | Strongly support broad decriminalization | View criminalization as fundamentally unjust |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Psychedelic Research and Therapy Access Act | 7/10 | Support core provisions; want decriminalization added and anti-patent provisions strengthened | Would add broader decriminalization, anti-monopoly provisions, community ownership |
| Model Psychedelic Therapy Services Act | 7/10 | Support state innovation; want cooperative and community-ownership models | Skeptical of private profit models |

#### Alternative Proposals

Progressives would advocate for: (1) full decriminalization of personal possession and cultivation; (2) public or cooperative ownership of psychedelic therapy centers; (3) patent reform preventing monopolies on naturally occurring compounds; (4) community health worker-led therapy models; (5) reparative justice provisions directing resources to communities harmed by the War on Drugs.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberal, Democratic Socialist (on equity and access)
- **Potential bridges:** Libertarian (on decriminalization), Populist (on anti-corporate provisions)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative, Religious Right (on decriminalization and broad access)

### Libertarian Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Libertarians genuinely believe individuals have the right to use psychedelics; position is principle-driven |
| Principle consistency | Highly consistent: opposition to drug prohibition is a core libertarian position applied uniformly across substances |
| Goalpost stability | Very stable: libertarian position on drug policy has been consistent for decades |
| Zero-sum behavior | None: willing to support incremental reform as steps toward full legalization |

**Justification:** Libertarians are the most philosophically consistent advocates for psychedelic access. Their position -- that adults should be free to use any substance without government permission -- applies to psychedelics as it does to all drugs. They are reliable supporters of reform but may oppose regulatory frameworks they view as creating new government bureaucracies.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Libertarian Party platform has consistently opposed drug prohibition since 1972
- Cato Institute published influential drug decriminalization research (Greenwald, 2009)
- Reason Foundation has published multiple analyses supporting psychedelic reform (2023-2024)

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Agree that Schedule I impedes access and research; view the entire scheduling system as government overreach |
| Root Cause Agreement | 7/10 | Agree that government regulation is the primary barrier; disagree with framing that implies better regulation is the solution (prefer less regulation entirely) |

**Source references:**

- Cato Institute. "Drug Decriminalization in Portugal." 2009.
- Reason Foundation. "Removing Barriers to Psychedelic Research and Therapy." 2024.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Reschedule psychedelics with therapeutic value | 6/10 | Support as improvement over Schedule I; prefer descheduling or abolishing the CSA | View rescheduling as half-measure |
| Federal psychedelic therapy access program | 3/10 | Oppose new federal program; prefer market-based access | Object to government regulation of therapeutic practice |
| Expand federal research funding ($200M/5yr) | 4/10 | Prefer private-sector research; oppose taxpayer funding | Government should not direct research |
| Insurance and VA coverage mandates | 3/10 | Oppose mandates on private insurers; accept VA coverage for veterans | Government mandates violate freedom of contract |
| Indigenous protections program | 5/10 | Support property rights and religious freedom; skeptical of benefit-sharing mandates | Benefit-sharing = government-mandated wealth transfer |
| Therapist training standards | 3/10 | Oppose government certification requirements; prefer market credentialing | View licensing as barrier to entry and government overreach |
| Decriminalize personal possession | 10/10 | Full support; prefer complete legalization of all drugs | Core libertarian position |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Psychedelic Research and Therapy Access Act | 3/10 | Support rescheduling and research licensing reform; oppose new federal programs and mandates | Too much government; prefer simple descheduling |
| Model Psychedelic Therapy Services Act | 4/10 | Prefer unregulated market over state licensing | State licensing creates barriers to entry |

#### Alternative Proposals

Libertarians would advocate for: (1) descheduling all psychedelics (removing them from the CSA entirely); (2) allowing adults to purchase and use psychedelics without a prescription; (3) voluntary professional certification (not government licensing); (4) eliminating DEA authority over drug scheduling; (5) market-based quality standards rather than government regulation.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive (on decriminalization), Constitutionalist (on limited federal authority)
- **Potential bridges:** Conservative (on reducing government barriers to innovation), Centrist (on research expansion)
- **Unlikely partners:** Liberal, Democratic Socialist (on regulatory framework and mandates)

---

### Constitutionalist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Constitutionalists genuinely concerned about federal overreach and enumerated powers |
| Principle consistency | Mostly consistent: federalism position applies to drug policy as to other areas; some tension with law-and-order positions |
| Goalpost stability | Stable: constitutional principles provide a fixed analytical framework |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low: willing to support reforms that restore constitutional balance |

**Justification:** Constitutionalists approach psychedelic policy through the lens of enumerated powers and federalism. They are natural supporters of state-level experimentation (Oregon, Colorado) and skeptical of expansive federal regulatory power. Their position creates unexpected alignment with progressives on state-level reform and with libertarians on limiting federal authority, though they may diverge on the constitutional basis for federal drug regulation itself.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Constitutional originalists have questioned whether the Commerce Clause extends to intrastate drug use (see Justice Thomas's dissent in *Gonzales v. Raich*)
- Federalist Society has hosted panels on drug scheduling and constitutional authority
- State's rights advocates have supported state-level psychedelic programs

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | Agree that federal scheduling is constitutionally questionable when applied to purely intrastate activity; skeptical of expansive federal authority claims |
| Root Cause Agreement | 5/10 | Agree that DEA has excessive authority; frame the problem as constitutional overreach rather than policy failure |

**Source references:**

- Justice Thomas, dissenting in *Gonzales v. Raich*, 545 U.S. 1 (2005), questioned Congress's Commerce Clause authority over purely local marijuana cultivation
- Federalist Society, "Controlled Substances and Constitutional Limits," 2023

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Reschedule psychedelics with therapeutic value | 5/10 | Prefer state-level action over federal rescheduling | Question whether federal scheduling itself is constitutionally sound |
| Federal psychedelic therapy access program | 3/10 | Oppose new federal program; prefer state authority | Enumerated powers concern |
| Expand federal research funding ($200M/5yr) | 4/10 | Cautious about expanding federal spending | Prefer state and private funding |
| Insurance and VA coverage mandates | 3/10 | Oppose federal insurance mandates; support VA for veterans as explicit federal obligation | Commerce Clause overreach concern |
| Indigenous protections program | 6/10 | Support AIRFA as existing federal obligation; support treaty-based protections | Federal trust responsibility is constitutionally grounded |
| Therapist training standards | 3/10 | Prefer state licensing over federal certification | 10th Amendment concern |
| Decriminalize personal possession | 6/10 | Support federal decriminalization; view intrastate personal use as beyond federal authority | Consistent with limited federal power |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Psychedelic Research and Therapy Access Act | 3/10 | Support DEA reform provisions; oppose expanded federal programs and mandates | Prefer narrower, constitutionally grounded bill |
| Model Psychedelic Therapy Services Act | 7/10 | Support state-level approach as proper exercise of state police power | States are the appropriate level of government for this |

#### Alternative Proposals

Constitutionalists would advocate for: (1) affirming state authority to regulate psychedelic therapy within their borders; (2) limiting federal role to interstate commerce and military/veteran contexts; (3) reducing DEA scheduling authority to what the Commerce Clause can legitimately support; (4) protecting religious freedom through existing RFRA framework.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Libertarian (on limited federal power), Populist (on anti-elite sentiment)
- **Potential bridges:** Conservative (on federalism), Progressive (on state-level reform)
- **Unlikely partners:** Liberal, Democratic Socialist (on federal program expansion)

---

### Populist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 2/5 - Low Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Populists express concern about drug safety but actual motivations are shaped by anti-elite sentiment and cultural identity |
| Principle consistency | Inconsistent: populist "anti-elite" position could support either side (against Big Pharma blocking access OR against coastal liberal drug culture) |
| Goalpost stability | Unstable: populist positions on psychedelics are still forming and highly responsive to framing |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate: may oppose reform if framed as coastal elite priority |

**Justification:** Populists are the most unpredictable constituency on psychedelics. Their anti-elite sentiment could cut either way: against the pharmaceutical companies and DEA bureaucrats blocking access to effective treatments, or against the Silicon Valley and counterculture elites promoting psychedelic use. The veteran angle is the strongest entry point, as populists are deeply sympathetic to veterans and hostile to institutional failures that harm them.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Populist sentiment supported the First Step Act when framed around justice and anti-establishment themes
- Right-wing populists have been inconsistent on drug policy: supportive of tough enforcement against cartels but increasingly sympathetic to veteran treatment needs
- Tucker Carlson and Joe Rogan (influential in populist media) have both expressed positive views on psychedelic therapy research

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Agree that the system is failing veterans and ordinary people; suspicious of both government bureaucracy (DEA) and Big Pharma |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | Agree that elites (DEA, pharma) are blocking access; disagree with racial justice framing; resonant with anti-establishment narrative |

**Source references:**

- Joe Rogan Experience episodes on psychedelic therapy (audience of 11+ million per episode) reflect populist media engagement
- American Legion psychedelic research resolution (2022) reflects veteran-populist overlap

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Reschedule psychedelics with therapeutic value | 5/10 | Support for veterans; cautious for broader population | Don't want to enable recreational drug culture |
| Federal psychedelic therapy access program | 4/10 | Suspicious of new government programs; want veterans prioritized | Anti-bureaucracy, but pro-veteran |
| Expand federal research funding ($200M/5yr) | 6/10 | Support veteran-focused research; skeptical of academic establishment | Want research that benefits ordinary Americans, not just academics |
| Insurance and VA coverage mandates | 5/10 | Support VA coverage; ambivalent on private insurance mandates | Pro-veteran; anti-government mandate |
| Indigenous protections program | 4/10 | Ambivalent; generally skeptical of identity-based programs | View as special interest policy |
| Therapist training standards | 5/10 | Support quality standards; concerned about credentialing creating barriers | Don't want elites to control access |
| Decriminalize personal possession | 3/10 | Generally opposed; view as soft on drugs | Cultural opposition to drug normalization |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Psychedelic Research and Therapy Access Act | 4/10 | Support veteran provisions; skeptical of broader regulatory framework | Would prefer veteran-only bill |
| Model Psychedelic Therapy Services Act | 3/10 | Skeptical of state programs operating outside federal framework | Uncomfortable with unregulated access |

#### Alternative Proposals

Populists would advocate for: (1) veteran-only psychedelic therapy programs through the VA; (2) cracking down on Big Pharma companies that suppress alternative treatments; (3) keeping psychedelics illegal for recreational use; (4) ensuring ordinary Americans, not coastal elites, benefit from any reform.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (on veteran focus and anti-drug-culture stance)
- **Potential bridges:** Liberal (on veteran-focused reform), Progressive (on anti-corporate provisions)
- **Unlikely partners:** Libertarian (on full legalization), Democratic Socialist (on structural reform)

---

### Centrist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Centrists genuinely motivated by evidence and pragmatism; support follows the data |
| Principle consistency | Consistent: centrist approach of following evidence and seeking bipartisan solutions applies cleanly to psychedelics |
| Goalpost stability | Stable: positions track accumulating evidence; shift toward support as evidence grows |
| Zero-sum behavior | Very low: centrists seek bipartisan solutions and are natural coalition builders |

**Justification:** Centrists are the most natural allies for the "follow the science" approach to psychedelic reform. They support FDA-pathway therapeutic access, evidence-based rescheduling, and incremental reform that builds on bipartisan common ground (veteran research, DEA process reform). They are the key swing constituency for moving reform through Congress.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Bipartisan Policy Center has increasingly engaged with psychedelic policy as a health innovation issue
- Centrist senators (e.g., Cory Booker, D-NJ, and Dan Crenshaw, R-TX) have co-sponsored psychedelic research legislation
- No Labels and Third Way have published supportive analysis of psychedelic therapy reform

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Strong agreement with evidence-based framing; appreciate the data-driven analysis; may want more emphasis on safety data |
| Root Cause Agreement | 7/10 | Agree that institutional barriers impede research; less interested in War on Drugs historical narrative; focused on forward-looking solutions |

**Source references:**

- Third Way. "The Case for Psychedelic Therapy Reform." 2023.
- Bipartisan Policy Center health innovation analyses

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Reschedule psychedelics with therapeutic value | 8/10 | Strongly support evidence-based rescheduling after FDA approval | Want rescheduling tied to FDA evidence, not political pressure |
| Federal psychedelic therapy access program | 7/10 | Support regulated federal framework | Want phased implementation with safety data |
| Expand federal research funding ($200M/5yr) | 8/10 | Strongly support research investment | Want rigorous scientific standards and oversight |
| Insurance and VA coverage mandates | 7/10 | Support coverage for approved therapies | Want cost-effectiveness data before mandating |
| Indigenous protections program | 7/10 | Support religious freedom and conservation | Pragmatic approach to indigenous issues |
| Therapist training standards | 8/10 | Strongly support professional standards | Want evidence-based training requirements |
| Decriminalize personal possession | 4/10 | Cautious; prefer regulated therapeutic access over decriminalization | Concerned about moving too fast without safety infrastructure |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Psychedelic Research and Therapy Access Act | 7/10 | Support most provisions; would moderate decriminalization elements | Want bipartisan viability |
| Model Psychedelic Therapy Services Act | 7/10 | Support state experimentation with evaluation requirements | Want strong data collection and program evaluation |

#### Alternative Proposals

Centrists would advocate for: (1) incremental reform starting with research and DEA process improvements; (2) FDA-pathway therapeutic access as the priority; (3) strong program evaluation and data collection; (4) bipartisan veteran-focused entry legislation; (5) phased expansion based on evidence.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberal (on regulated access), Conservative (on veteran-focused reform)
- **Potential bridges:** Progressive (on access), Libertarian (on research expansion)
- **Unlikely partners:** None (centrists can work with all perspectives on specific issues)

### Religious Right Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Stated concern is moral opposition to drug use; actual motivations mix genuine moral conviction with cultural identity politics |
| Principle consistency | Mixed: religious freedom principle should support religious psychedelic use (peyote, ayahuasca), but drug use opposition creates tension |
| Goalpost stability | Shifting: religious right has softened on some drug issues (marijuana for medical use) but psychedelics remain more culturally loaded |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate: may oppose reform that seems to validate secular or New Age spiritual practices |

**Justification:** The Religious Right faces genuine internal tension on psychedelics. Their commitment to religious freedom should logically extend to psychedelic religious practices (NAC peyote use, ayahuasca churches), and their concern for veterans aligns with therapeutic access. However, their broader moral opposition to drug use and concern about cultural normalization creates resistance to comprehensive reform.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Evangelical leaders have increasingly supported compassionate approaches to addiction (faith-based recovery)
- Religious liberty advocacy has supported peyote and ayahuasca church protections

### Democratic Socialist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Democratic Socialists genuinely concerned about corporate capture and equity; support driven by public health principles |
| Principle consistency | Consistent: public health orientation, anti-corporate stance, and universal access align with broader democratic socialist principles |
| Goalpost stability | Stable: positions reflect principled commitment to public provision and equity |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low: willing to support incremental reform while advocating for more comprehensive change |

**Justification:** Democratic Socialists support psychedelic reform but insist on public rather than private models for therapy delivery. They share progressive concerns about corporate capture and equity but go further in advocating for public ownership, universal access, and integration with a broader universal healthcare system. They are reliable reform supporters but resistant to market-driven solutions.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- DSA platform supports drug decriminalization as part of broader criminal justice reform
- Democratic socialist elected officials (e.g., Bernie Sanders, AOC) have supported drug policy reform and mental health investment
- DSA healthcare platform emphasizes universal public provision, which naturally extends to psychedelic therapy

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strong agreement with analysis of institutional barriers, mental health crisis, and racial disparities; would add class analysis |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | Agree with institutional and political economy analysis; want more emphasis on capitalism and pharmaceutical industry profit motive |

**Source references:**

- Democratic Socialists of America healthcare platform
- Jacobin magazine has published supportive analysis of psychedelic decriminalization and public mental health investment

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Reschedule psychedelics with therapeutic value | 8/10 | Support rescheduling as step toward broader reform | Want to prevent corporate monopolization |
| Federal psychedelic therapy access program | 6/10 | Support federal program but want public ownership, not private delivery | Oppose for-profit psychedelic therapy |
| Expand federal research funding ($200M/5yr) | 9/10 | Strongly support public research investment | Want public benefit requirements; oppose patent privatization of publicly funded research |
| Insurance and VA coverage mandates | 8/10 | Support coverage within single-payer framework | Prefer universal public insurance to mandated private coverage |
| Indigenous protections program | 9/10 | Strongly support indigenous sovereignty and benefit-sharing | Commitment to anti-colonialism and reparative justice |
| Therapist training standards | 7/10 | Support public training programs; want community health workers included | Want diverse workforce not limited to expensive credentialed professionals |
| Decriminalize personal possession | 9/10 | Strongly support full decriminalization | View criminalization as class warfare |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Psychedelic Research and Therapy Access Act | 7/10 | Support research and access provisions; want anti-patent and public ownership provisions | Would add public delivery infrastructure and anti-monopoly provisions |
| Model Psychedelic Therapy Services Act | 6/10 | Support state programs; want cooperative/public ownership models | Oppose for-profit service center model |

#### Alternative Proposals

Democratic Socialists would advocate for: (1) publicly owned psychedelic therapy centers integrated into universal healthcare; (2) prohibition on patenting naturally occurring psychedelic compounds; (3) public ownership of psychedelic compound manufacturing; (4) community health worker delivery models; (5) integration with single-payer healthcare system; (6) reparative justice provisions for communities harmed by the War on Drugs.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive (on equity and anti-corporate provisions), Liberal (on access and public health)
- **Potential bridges:** Libertarian (on decriminalization), Populist (on anti-corporate provisions)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative, Religious Right (on government program expansion and cultural values)

### Common Ground Synthesis

This matrix identifies which reforms have potential cross-ideological support and which face structural opposition.

| Reform Category | Broad Support (5+) | Narrow Support (3-4) | Structural Opposition |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Research funding expansion | Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Conservative, Populist, Democratic Socialist | Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Religious Right | None |
| Evidence-based rescheduling (post-FDA) | Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Democratic Socialist, Libertarian | Conservative, Constitutionalist, Populist | Religious Right |
| VA coverage for veterans | Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Conservative, Populist, Democratic Socialist, Religious Right | Libertarian, Constitutionalist | None |
| Indigenous protections | Liberal, Progressive, Democratic Socialist, Centrist, Religious Right | Conservative, Constitutionalist, Libertarian | Populist |
| Decriminalization | Progressive, Libertarian, Democratic Socialist | Liberal, Constitutionalist | Conservative, Populist, Religious Right, Centrist |
| Federal therapy access program | Liberal, Progressive, Centrist | Democratic Socialist, Conservative, Populist, Religious Right | Libertarian, Constitutionalist |

**Key insight:** The broadest coalition exists around (1) expanded research funding and (2) VA coverage for veterans, both of which enjoy support from 7+ perspectives. Evidence-based rescheduling after FDA approval commands a working majority (6/9 perspectives). Decriminalization of personal possession faces significant opposition and should be pursued separately from therapeutic access reform.

## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: Veterans First Psychedelic Therapy Act

**Bridges:** Conservative + Liberal + Centrist + Populist + Progressive + Democratic Socialist

**Core Agreement:** Veterans deserve access to the most effective treatments for PTSD and traumatic brain injury. Veteran suicide is a national crisis. All perspectives prioritize veteran welfare.

**Policy Description:**

Fund $100 million over 5 years for VA psychedelic therapy research at 15+ medical centers. Streamline DEA research licensing for VA studies. Upon FDA approval, immediately provide VA coverage for psychedelic-assisted therapy for eligible veterans. Include veteran employment pipeline to psychedelic therapy careers.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | Focused on veterans, not broad drug reform; respects FDA pathway |
| Liberal | Addresses mental health crisis for underserved population; expands evidence base |
| Progressive | Directs resources to veterans harmed by government policy; creates public delivery model |
| Centrist | Evidence-based, bipartisan, incremental approach |
| Populist | Prioritizes ordinary Americans (veterans) over elite interests |
| Democratic Socialist | Public healthcare delivery; veterans are working class |
| Religious Right | Pro-veteran; medical pathway only |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Accepting expanded federal spending on research |
| Progressive | Deferring broader decriminalization and non-veteran access |
| Libertarian | Accepting government-run (VA) delivery model |
| Religious Right | Accepting psychedelic use in medical context |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 7/9 perspectives (Libertarian and Constitutionalist are not opposed, merely not prioritizing this approach)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 4/7 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** High -- veteran-focused reform has strong bipartisan precedent (First Step Act, PACT Act)
- **Implementation Path:** Bipartisan legislation through Senate and House Veterans Affairs Committees; could pass with strong majorities

---

### Compromise 2: Evidence-Based Scheduling Reform

**Bridges:** Liberal + Centrist + Progressive + Democratic Socialist + Libertarian

**Core Agreement:** Drug scheduling should be based on scientific evidence, not political stigma. If the FDA approves a psychedelic therapy, Schedule I classification is scientifically indefensible.

**Policy Description:**

Require the Attorney General to initiate rescheduling proceedings within 12 months of FDA approval of a psychedelic-assisted therapy. Create an independent scientific advisory panel to recommend scheduling classification. Give "substantial deference" to scientific over law enforcement judgment. Include 30-day DEA research licensing timeline with deemed-approval.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Liberal | Evidence-based scheduling; removes DEA veto over medical science |
| Centrist | Follows FDA evidence; incremental, process-focused reform |
| Progressive | Removes structural barrier to access; weakens DEA institutional power |
| Democratic Socialist | Public health over enforcement; builds foundation for broader reform |
| Libertarian | Reduces government barriers; weakens DEA authority |
| Conservative | Tied to FDA approval (not pre-emptive); maintains scheduling framework |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Libertarian | Accepting continued scheduling system (rather than abolition) |
| Progressive | Accepting Schedule II/III rather than full descheduling |
| Conservative | Accepting mandatory rescheduling timeline that limits DEA discretion |
| Religious Right | Accepting that rescheduling does not increase recreational access |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 6/9 perspectives (Conservative, Populist, and Religious Right may resist but unlikely to actively block)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 5/6 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** High -- tied to objective FDA decisions, not political dynamics
- **Implementation Path:** Legislation through Senate HELP and House Energy & Commerce Committees; likely requires 60 Senate votes

---

### Compromise 3: Indigenous and Religious Use Protection Act

**Bridges:** Religious Right + Liberal + Progressive + Constitutionalist + Democratic Socialist

**Core Agreement:** Religious freedom is a foundational American value. Indigenous ceremonial practices deserve protection. Peyote conservation is urgent.

**Policy Description:**

Expand AIRFA protections for indigenous psychedelic practices. Fund a $20 million peyote conservation and cultivation program. Codify existing RFRA protections for ayahuasca churches. Exclude peyote from broader decriminalization or commercial access measures. Require indigenous representation on any federal psychedelic advisory body. Establish benefit-sharing framework for commercialization of indigenous knowledge.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Religious Right | Strengthens religious liberty; protects faith-based practices |
| Liberal | Addresses indigenous equity and cultural protections |
| Progressive | Anti-colonial framework; indigenous sovereignty |
| Constitutionalist | Grounded in existing federal authority (treaty obligations, RFRA) |
| Democratic Socialist | Reparative justice; public benefit over private profit |
| Conservative | Religious freedom; conservation |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Libertarian | Accepting government-managed conservation program |
| Populist | Supporting identity-based policy provisions |
| Conservative | Funding new federal program |
| Progressive | Accepting peyote exclusion from broader reform |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 6/9 perspectives
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 4/6 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** High -- religious freedom and indigenous rights have deep constitutional foundations
- **Implementation Path:** Could be standalone or attached to broader reform legislation; likely faces minimal active opposition

## Strategic Implications

### Most Viable Coalition

The most viable legislative coalition for psychedelic reform consists of **Liberal + Centrist + Progressive** perspectives, with **Conservative** support achievable through veteran-focused framing. This coalition of 4 perspectives includes 3 rated at 4+ consistency, making them reliable partners. Reaching 60 Senate votes likely requires engaging centrist Republicans and conservative Democrats through the veteran pathway.

### Key Obstacles

- **Religious Right** and **Populist** opposition to anything framed as "drug legalization" requires careful communication strategy
- **Libertarian** objections to new federal programs and mandates create tension with the regulatory framework most reform advocates support
- **Conservative** internal division between law-and-order and veteran-advocacy factions is the key swing dynamic

### Low Consistency Partners

- **Populist** (2/5): Positions are highly responsive to framing. Veterans-focused messaging and anti-establishment framing (against DEA bureaucracy and Big Pharma) are the most effective approaches. Avoid cultural association with coastal elites or counterculture.
- **Religious Right** (3/5): Religious freedom pathway is the strongest bridge. Emphasize NAC peyote protections, ayahuasca church rights, and the distinction between religious/medical use and recreational use.

### Recommended Approach

1. **Begin with Veterans First legislation** -- highest bipartisan support, builds evidence base, creates political momentum
2. **Pursue Evidence-Based Scheduling Reform** as FDA approvals accumulate -- tie rescheduling to objective scientific milestones
3. **Pass Indigenous Protections** early -- high cross-ideological support, addresses legitimate concerns, builds goodwill
4. **Defer decriminalization** until therapeutic access is established -- decriminalization faces the most opposition and is least necessary for patient access
5. **Build state-level momentum** concurrently -- Oregon and Colorado program outcomes provide real-world evidence that reduces uncertainty and builds confidence among cautious perspectives
