# Psychedelics Policy: History

## Historical Development

The history of psychedelics in America spans millennia of indigenous use, a brief period of extraordinary scientific promise in the mid-20th century, decades of prohibition driven by political rather than scientific considerations, and a modern renaissance that is attempting to reclaim these substances for medicine and therapy. Understanding this history is essential for designing policy that avoids repeating past mistakes.

### Indigenous and Pre-Modern Use (Pre-1938): Ancient Roots

- **Indigenous ceremonial use**: Psilocybin mushrooms have been used in Mesoamerican religious ceremonies for at least 3,000 years. The Aztecs called them *teonanacatl* ("flesh of the gods"). Archaeological evidence from Saharan Africa suggests mushroom use dating back 7,000-9,000 years.
- **Peyote traditions**: The Native American Church and its predecessors have used peyote (containing mescaline) in religious ceremonies for centuries. The Huichol people of Mexico have used peyote for at least 2,000 years. Peyote use spread to North American indigenous communities in the 19th century.
- **Ayahuasca ceremonies**: Indigenous communities in the Amazon Basin have used ayahuasca (containing DMT and MAO inhibitors) for healing and spiritual purposes for an estimated 1,000+ years.
- **Western discovery of mescaline**: German pharmacologist Arthur Heffter first isolated mescaline from peyote in 1897. Aldous Huxley's *The Doors of Perception* (1954) popularized mescaline experiences in Western culture.

### The First Wave of Research (1938-1965): Scientific Promise

- **LSD synthesis**: Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann synthesized LSD at Sandoz Laboratories in 1938 and discovered its psychoactive properties in 1943 when he accidentally absorbed a small amount through his fingertips. His intentional self-experiment on April 19, 1943 ("Bicycle Day") confirmed the compound's extraordinary potency.
- **Psychiatric research explosion**: Between 1950 and 1965, more than 1,000 peer-reviewed papers were published on LSD, involving more than 40,000 research subjects. LSD was investigated as a treatment for alcoholism, depression, anxiety, and other conditions, with promising results.
- **Sandoz distribution**: Sandoz Pharmaceuticals distributed LSD under the trade name Delysid to researchers and psychiatrists worldwide, marketing it as an aid to psychotherapy and as a tool for understanding psychosis.
- **CIA and military programs**: The CIA's MKUltra program (1953-1973) conducted covert experiments with LSD and other psychoactive substances, often on unwitting subjects, including prisoners, mental patients, and members of the public. The Army also tested LSD at Edgewood Arsenal. These programs were unethical, illegal, and ultimately damaging to the scientific legitimacy of psychedelic research.
- **Psilocybin identification**: R. Gordon Wasson's 1957 *Life* magazine article about his participation in a Mazatec mushroom ceremony in Oaxaca, Mexico introduced psilocybin to mainstream Western awareness. Albert Hofmann subsequently isolated and synthesized psilocybin and psilocin in 1958.
- **Harvard Psilocybin Project**: Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert (later Ram Dass) conducted psilocybin experiments at Harvard University from 1960 to 1963, including the Concord Prison Experiment and the Marsh Chapel Experiment. Their increasingly evangelical promotion of psychedelics and departure from scientific protocols led to their dismissal from Harvard in 1963.

### Prohibition and the Culture Wars (1965-1990): Political Backlash

- **Counterculture association**: By the mid-1960s, LSD had become a symbol of the counterculture movement, anti-Vietnam War protests, and generational rebellion. Timothy Leary's exhortation to "Turn on, tune in, drop out" became a cultural flashpoint.
- **State-level bans**: California became the first state to ban LSD in 1966. Other states followed rapidly.
- **Federal criminalization**: The Drug Abuse Control Amendments of 1965 placed restrictions on LSD, psilocybin, and other hallucinogens. The Staggers-Dodd Bill (1968) made possession of LSD a misdemeanor and sale a felony.
- **Controlled Substances Act (1970)**: President Nixon signed the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act, which created the five-schedule classification system. LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, and DMT were placed in Schedule I -- defined as having "high potential for abuse," "no currently accepted medical use," and "lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision." This classification effectively ended clinical research for decades.
- **Nixon's political motivations**: Nixon aide John Ehrlichman later acknowledged that the drug war was designed to target political opponents: "We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities."
- **MDMA scheduling (1985)**: MDMA, which had been used therapeutically by an estimated 4,000 therapists during the late 1970s and early 1980s, was emergency-scheduled as Schedule I by the DEA in 1985 despite an administrative law judge's recommendation against Schedule I placement. Judge Francis Young recommended Schedule III, which would have permitted medical use, but DEA Administrator John Lawn overruled the recommendation.
- **Research shutdown**: Between 1970 and 1990, virtually no clinical research with psychedelics was conducted in the United States. The number of published papers on LSD dropped from over 1,000 per year in the 1960s to near zero by the late 1970s.

### The Underground Period (1990-2006): Quiet Persistence

- **MAPS founded (1986)**: Rick Doblin founded the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies with the explicit goal of making MDMA a legal prescription medicine. MAPS became the primary organizational driver of the psychedelic research revival.
- **First modern trial approved (1990)**: The FDA approved Rick Strassman's DMT study at the University of New Mexico, the first federally approved human psychedelic research in over two decades. Results published in *Archives of General Psychiatry* (1994).
- **Peyote protections (1994)**: Congress passed the American Indian Religious Freedom Act Amendments, codifying the right of Native American Church members to use peyote in religious ceremonies (42 U.S.C. Section 1996a).
- **Heffter Research Institute (1993)**: Founded to support rigorous scientific research on psychedelics, the Heffter Research Institute funded early psilocybin studies at Johns Hopkins and NYU.
- **UDV Supreme Court case (2006)**: In *Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal*, 546 U.S. 418 (2006), the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the federal government could not prohibit the UDV church from using ayahuasca in religious ceremonies under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.

### The Psychedelic Renaissance (2006-Present): Scientific Revival

- **Johns Hopkins landmark study (2006)**: Roland Griffiths and colleagues published "Psilocybin Can Occasion Mystical-Type Experiences Having Substantial and Sustained Personal Meaning and Spiritual Significance" in *Psychopharmacology*, the first rigorously controlled psilocybin study in the modern era. This study is widely credited with catalyzing the current research revival.
- **NYU and Hopkins cancer anxiety studies (2016)**: Two landmark randomized controlled trials published simultaneously in the *Journal of Psychopharmacology* demonstrated that psilocybin produced rapid and sustained reductions in anxiety and depression in patients with life-threatening cancer diagnoses.
- **FDA Breakthrough Therapy designations (2017-2019)**: The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD (2017), psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression (Compass Pathways, 2018), and psilocybin for major depressive disorder (Usona Institute, 2019).
- **Denver decriminalization (2019)**: Denver voters passed Initiative 301 (50.6%), making Denver the first U.S. city to decriminalize psilocybin mushrooms. Oakland followed weeks later with a broader resolution covering all entheogenic plants.
- **Oregon Measure 109 (2020)**: Oregon voters approved the first-in-the-nation regulated psilocybin therapy program (55.8%). The same ballot included Measure 110, which decriminalized personal possession of all drugs.
- **Colorado Proposition 122 (2022)**: Colorado voters approved the Natural Medicine Health Act (53.6%), decriminalizing and creating a regulated access framework for psilocybin, DMT, ibogaine, and mescaline (excluding peyote).
- **FDA MDMA decision (2024)**: The FDA declined to approve Lykos Therapeutics' NDA for MDMA-assisted PTSD therapy, requesting an additional clinical trial. While a setback, the decision did not reject the scientific basis for psychedelic therapy.
- **Expanding federal research funding**: NIH and VA began funding psychedelic research directly, with NIDA launching psilocybin-focused initiatives in 2023 and the VA funding studies on MDMA and psilocybin for veterans with PTSD.

## Lessons from History

### Pattern 1: Political Decisions Override Scientific Evidence

The scheduling of psychedelics in 1970 and the emergency scheduling of MDMA in 1985 were driven by political considerations rather than scientific assessment. In both cases, the substances were placed in the most restrictive category despite evidence of therapeutic potential and, in MDMA's case, an administrative law judge's explicit recommendation against Schedule I. This pattern -- political interference overriding scientific evidence -- is the central failure that modern reform must address. Any successful reform framework must insulate scheduling decisions from political pressure.

### Pattern 2: Cultural Backlash Can Destroy Legitimate Science

The association of psychedelics with the 1960s counterculture and anti-war movement made them political targets. The resulting prohibition destroyed a legitimate and promising field of psychiatric research for decades. The modern psychedelic movement has deliberately distanced itself from counterculture aesthetics and centered institutional science, clinical data, and medical applications -- a strategic lesson from history that explains the emphasis on "psychedelic-assisted therapy" rather than "psychedelic liberation."

### Pattern 3: State Innovation Precedes Federal Reform

As with cannabis, state-level experimentation with psychedelic policy (Oregon, Colorado, municipal decriminalization) is creating real-world evidence and building political momentum before federal reform. This federalism-driven pattern suggests that federal change is most likely after states demonstrate workable regulatory models.

### Pattern 4: Covert Government Programs Undermine Public Trust

The CIA's MKUltra program and military experiments -- which used psychedelics on unwitting subjects -- created lasting public distrust that continues to complicate reform efforts. Any policy framework must include robust informed consent protections and transparency requirements to rebuild trust.
