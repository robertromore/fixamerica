# Psychedelics Policy: Solutions

Psychedelics policy reform requires a multi-faceted approach that aims to align federal scheduling with scientific evidence, expand access to psychedelic-assisted therapy through regulated pathways, protect indigenous practices, ensure equitable access, and build a robust safety infrastructure.

---

## Reform Framework

### Guiding Principles

- Evidence-based scheduling: Federal classification of psychedelic substances must reflect current scientific knowledge of therapeutic potential and safety profiles, not political stigma from the 1970s
- Patient access: Patients with treatment-resistant mental health conditions should not be denied access to effective therapies because of outdated regulatory barriers
- Safety through regulation: Regulated access with appropriate screening, training, and oversight is safer than prohibition, which drives use underground without safeguards
- Equity by design: Reform must proactively address access disparities by race, income, geography, and insurance status
- Indigenous sovereignty: Policy must protect traditional ceremonial use, conserve threatened species (peyote), and ensure benefit-sharing with indigenous communities

### Theory of Change

Federal psychedelic reform is most likely to succeed through a sequenced strategy that builds political coalitions, accumulates evidence, and creates facts on the ground:

1. **Veteran-focused research funding** creates bipartisan legislative beachhead
2. **FDA approval of psilocybin or MDMA therapy** establishes "accepted medical use," undermining Schedule I rationale
3. **State-level programs** (Oregon, Colorado) generate real-world safety and efficacy data
4. **Rescheduling to Schedule II or III** follows logically from FDA approval and state evidence
5. **Insurance coverage mandates** ensure access beyond early adopters
6. **Comprehensive federal framework** integrates therapeutic access, research, indigenous protections, and safety standards

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Reschedule Psychedelics with Demonstrated Therapeutic Value to Schedule II or III

**Description**: Amend the Controlled Substances Act or direct the DEA to reschedule psilocybin, MDMA, and other psychedelics with demonstrated therapeutic potential from Schedule I to Schedule II (high medical value, restricted access) or Schedule III (moderate abuse potential, accepted medical use). Schedule II would permit prescribing by licensed physicians; Schedule III would allow broader therapeutic access with fewer restrictions. The appropriate schedule should be determined by an independent scientific review process, not by DEA discretion alone.

**Evidence Base**: The FDA's Breakthrough Therapy designations for psilocybin (2018, 2019) and MDMA (2017) represent federal recognition of "substantial improvement" over existing therapies. Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials demonstrate efficacy for treatment-resistant depression (Goodwin et al., *NEJM*, 2022), PTSD (Mitchell et al., *Nature Medicine*, 2021, 2023), and substance use disorders (Bogenschutz et al., *JAMA Psychiatry*, 2022). The pharmacological profile of classical psychedelics (rapid tolerance, no physical dependence, no compulsive use patterns) does not match Schedule I criteria. Ketamine, which has similar psychoactive properties, is Schedule III and legally administered off-label for depression.

**Implementation**: Congress could amend the CSA to require rescheduling within a specified timeframe after FDA approval of a psychedelic-assisted therapy. Alternatively, the Attorney General could initiate rescheduling proceedings under 21 U.S.C. Section 811(a). An independent scientific advisory committee (modeled on the UK's Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs) should conduct the review.

**Cost/Resources**: Minimal direct cost. The rescheduling process is administrative. Savings would accrue from reduced enforcement costs and improved mental health outcomes.

**Timeline**: 1-3 years from legislative action or rescheduling petition to final rule.

**Challenges**: DEA institutional resistance. Political opposition from "tough on drugs" constituencies. Potential legal challenges from parties opposing rescheduling.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of DEA research registrations approved per year; number of clinical trials initiated; time from petition to final scheduling decision; prescribing volume post-rescheduling.

### Solution 2: Establish a Federal Psychedelic Therapy Access Program

**Description**: Create a regulated federal framework for psychedelic-assisted therapy that sets minimum standards for practitioner training, patient screening, session protocols, adverse event reporting, and facility requirements. The program would operate through licensed treatment centers and qualified healthcare providers, similar to the REMS (Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy) framework the FDA uses for high-risk medications.

**Evidence Base**: Oregon's Measure 109 and Colorado's Proposition 122 demonstrate that regulated access models can operate safely. Clinical trial protocols (MAPS, Compass Pathways, Usona) provide established templates for screening, dosing, and session management. The REMS framework has been successfully used for medications including opioids (Opioid Analgesic REMS), isotretinoin (iPLEDGE), and thalidomide (THALOMID REMS).

**Implementation**: FDA approval of psychedelic-assisted therapies would trigger REMS development. Congress should authorize HHS to develop comprehensive therapy access standards. A new interagency office or task force (involving FDA, SAMHSA, DEA, and VA) should coordinate implementation.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $50-100 million over 5 years for regulatory development, practitioner training infrastructure, and program oversight. This is a fraction of the estimated $210 billion annual economic cost of mental illness.

**Timeline**: 2-5 years for full program implementation following FDA approval.

**Challenges**: Workforce development (insufficient number of trained therapists); facility development; insurance coverage; interstate regulatory coordination.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of licensed treatment centers per state; patient volumes; treatment outcomes (PTSD remission rates, depression response rates); adverse event rates; demographic diversity of patients served.

### Solution 3: Expand Federal Research Funding for Psychedelic Therapy

**Description**: Significantly increase federal research funding for psychedelic-assisted therapy through NIMH, NIDA, and the VA. Create a dedicated NIH funding opportunity announcement (FOA) for psychedelic therapy research. Mandate that VA medical centers participate in psychedelic clinical trials. Streamline DEA research licensing for psychedelic studies.

**Evidence Base**: Federal research funding for psychedelics (~$40 million from NIH and ~$10 million from VA in FY2024) is a fraction of the need. By comparison, NIH spent $4.9 billion on mental health research in FY2023 and the VA spent $2.7 billion on mental health services. The gap between the therapeutic promise of psychedelics and the federal research investment is enormous. Private capital has funded the bulk of modern psychedelic research, but a market correction has reduced private investment.

**Implementation**: Congressional appropriation of $200 million over 5 years for psychedelic therapy research across NIH, NIDA, NIMH, and VA. DEA should create an expedited research licensing track for psychedelic studies (30-day review target). NIDA should expand the Drug Supply Program to ensure adequate supply of research-grade psychedelics.

**Cost/Resources**: $200 million over 5 years ($40 million/year), distributed across NIH institutes and VA.

**Timeline**: Could begin in the next fiscal year with Congressional appropriation.

**Challenges**: Congressional appropriations process. NIH grant review culture. DEA resistance to expedited licensing.

**Impact Metrics**: Total federal funding for psychedelic research per year; number of active federally funded psychedelic clinical trials; diversity of trial participants; publication output; time from grant submission to award.

### Solution 4: Mandate Insurance and VA Coverage for FDA-Approved Psychedelic Therapies

**Description**: Require that private health insurers, Medicare, Medicaid, and VA healthcare cover FDA-approved psychedelic-assisted therapies under mental health parity provisions. Develop appropriate billing codes (CPT codes) for psychedelic-assisted therapy sessions, including preparation sessions, dosing sessions (6-12 hours), and integration sessions.

**Evidence Base**: The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 requires insurers to cover mental health treatments on par with physical health treatments. However, without specific billing codes and coverage mandates, insurers may deny coverage for psychedelic therapies as "experimental." Oregon's program demonstrates the access barrier: at $1,500-$3,500 per session without insurance coverage, psilocybin therapy is inaccessible to most Americans.

**Implementation**: Following FDA approval, CMS should develop billing codes for psychedelic therapy. HHS should issue guidance clarifying that mental health parity requires coverage. Congress should amend the parity act if necessary to explicitly include FDA-approved psychedelic therapies. The VA should cover psychedelic therapies for eligible veterans immediately upon FDA approval.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $500 million-$1 billion annually if 500,000-1 million patients receive treatment per year (at $3,000-$5,000 per treatment course including preparation and integration sessions). Offset by reduced long-term mental health care costs, reduced disability claims, and improved productivity. Studies suggest treatment-resistant depression costs $17,000-$25,000 more per patient per year than treatment-responsive depression (Amos et al., *Journal of Clinical Psychiatry*, 2018).

**Timeline**: 1-2 years after FDA approval for initial coverage decisions; 3-5 years for full implementation across all payers.

**Challenges**: Insurance industry resistance to novel therapy models. Billing code development for multi-hour sessions. Actuarial uncertainty about utilization rates.

**Impact Metrics**: Percentage of health plans covering psychedelic therapy; out-of-pocket cost to patients; demographic diversity of patients receiving coverage; Medicaid coverage adoption by states.

### Solution 5: Create an Indigenous Psychedelic Protections Program

**Description**: Establish a federal program that protects indigenous religious use of psychedelics, conserves threatened species (particularly peyote), and ensures that indigenous communities benefit from the commercialization of psychedelic therapy. The program would include: expanded AIRFA protections, a peyote conservation fund, benefit-sharing requirements for companies commercializing indigenous knowledge, and indigenous representation on federal psychedelic regulatory bodies.

**Evidence Base**: Wild peyote populations in South Texas are declining. The National Council of Native American Churches has called for peyote to be excluded from broader decriminalization measures. International frameworks such as the Nagoya Protocol on benefit-sharing from genetic resources provide models for indigenous knowledge protections.

**Implementation**: Congress should amend AIRFA to expand protections. DOI should fund peyote conservation and cultivation programs. FDA should require benefit-sharing agreements as a condition of approval for therapies derived from indigenous practices. Federal psychedelic advisory committees should include indigenous representatives.

**Cost/Resources**: $20 million over 5 years for conservation programs; administrative costs for benefit-sharing framework.

**Timeline**: 1-2 years for legislative action; 3-5 years for full program implementation.

**Challenges**: Defining "indigenous knowledge" for benefit-sharing purposes. Balancing conservation with access. Ensuring meaningful rather than token indigenous representation.

**Impact Metrics**: Peyote population assessments; number of AIRFA enforcement actions; indigenous representation on advisory bodies; benefit-sharing agreements executed.

### Solution 6: Establish Therapist Training and Certification Standards

**Description**: Create a national framework for psychedelic therapy practitioner training and certification, developed in collaboration with professional medical and psychological associations. The framework should include didactic training, supervised clinical practice, personal experience requirements (optional), cultural competency, and continuing education. Training programs should actively recruit practitioners from underrepresented communities.

**Evidence Base**: Oregon's facilitator training requirement (120-160 hours) provides a starting point but is less rigorous than the training protocols used in clinical trials (MAPS requires 100+ hours of specialized training for MDMA therapists, in addition to existing clinical credentials). Professional organizations including the American Psychological Association and the American Psychiatric Association are developing position statements on psychedelic therapy training.

**Implementation**: HHS or an independent professional body should develop national certification standards. Medical schools and graduate psychology programs should integrate psychedelic therapy training. Scholarship programs should fund training for practitioners from underserved communities.

**Cost/Resources**: $30 million over 5 years for curriculum development, scholarship programs, and certification infrastructure.

**Timeline**: 2-4 years for standards development; 5-7 years for workforce at scale.

**Challenges**: Resistance from professional licensing boards. Workforce shortage during transition. Quality variation across training programs.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of certified practitioners; geographic distribution; demographic diversity of practitioner workforce; patient-to-practitioner ratio by state; adverse event rates by practitioner certification level.

### Solution 7: Decriminalize Personal Possession of Psychedelic Plants and Fungi

**Description**: Remove criminal penalties for personal possession and cultivation of naturally occurring psychedelic plants and fungi (psilocybin mushrooms, DMT-containing plants, mescaline-containing cacti excluding peyote) for adults aged 21 and over. Decriminalization would not create a commercial market or permit sales, but would end criminal prosecution for personal use.

**Evidence Base**: Municipal decriminalization in Denver, Oakland, Washington D.C., and other cities has not produced documented increases in emergency medical events, public safety incidents, or youth use. Portugal decriminalized personal possession of all drugs in 2001 and subsequently saw reductions in drug-related deaths, HIV infections, and incarceration, with no increase in overall drug use (Greenwald, *Cato Institute*, 2009; EMCDDA, 2024). Classical psychedelics have among the lowest rates of emergency medical treatment of any recreational drug (Global Drug Survey, 2017).

**Implementation**: Congress could amend the CSA to remove criminal penalties for personal possession of specified psychedelic plants and fungi below a threshold quantity. Alternatively, the federal government could adopt a non-enforcement policy (similar to the Cole Memorandum for cannabis) while states legislate decriminalization.

**Cost/Resources**: Minimal cost; would produce savings from reduced law enforcement, prosecution, and incarceration costs.

**Timeline**: 1-2 years for federal legislative action; immediate for executive non-enforcement policy.

**Challenges**: Political opposition from "tough on drugs" constituencies. Concerns about unregulated use without clinical oversight. Distinguishing personal use from distribution.

**Impact Metrics**: Psychedelic-related arrests per year; emergency department visits; youth use rates; public opinion polling.

## International Models

### Jamaica: Legal Psilocybin Retreat Industry

**Description**: Psilocybin mushrooms are not classified as controlled substances in Jamaica. A legal psilocybin retreat industry has emerged, attracting international participants for therapeutic, wellness, and ceremonial experiences.

**Results**: Jamaica's retreat industry serves thousands of international participants annually. The absence of regulatory framework has led to wide variation in quality and safety standards, with some facilities offering medically supervised experiences and others operating without professional oversight.

**Applicability to U.S.**: Demonstrates market demand for legal psychedelic access and the importance of establishing quality and safety standards. The unregulated nature of Jamaica's market illustrates the risks of legalization without regulatory infrastructure.

### Netherlands: Legal Psilocybin Truffles

**Description**: While psilocybin mushrooms were banned in the Netherlands in 2008, psilocybin-containing truffles (sclerotia) remain legal and are sold openly in "smart shops." The Netherlands also hosts legal psilocybin retreat centers.

**Results**: The legal truffle market operates with commercial regulations but without therapeutic oversight. Emergency medical events remain low. The market demonstrates that legal access to psilocybin can coexist with public safety.

**Applicability to U.S.**: The Dutch model illustrates the distinction between legal access and therapeutic access. The U.S. should aim for a more structured therapeutic framework rather than a purely commercial model.

### Switzerland: Compassionate Use (SAP) for Psychedelics

**Description**: Switzerland permits individual physicians to prescribe psychedelics (LSD, psilocybin, MDMA) through a compassionate use pathway (Sonderbewilligung, or Special Authorization). Physicians apply to the Federal Office of Public Health for individual patient authorization.

**Results**: As of 2024, hundreds of Swiss patients have received psychedelic-assisted therapy through the SAP pathway. The program provides a model for individualized clinical access within an existing regulatory framework.

**Applicability to U.S.**: The Swiss model could inform a U.S. compassionate use program for psychedelics, potentially administered through the FDA's Expanded Access (compassionate use) pathway.

### Australia: TGA Rescheduling of Psilocybin and MDMA (2023)

**Description**: In February 2023, Australia became the first country to formally reschedule psilocybin and MDMA for therapeutic use. The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) authorized specially licensed psychiatrists to prescribe these substances for treatment-resistant depression (psilocybin) and PTSD (MDMA).

**Results**: As of 2024, uptake has been limited due to high costs ($10,000-$25,000 AUD per treatment course), limited supply of authorized psychiatrists, and insurance non-coverage. The TGA rescheduling demonstrates political feasibility but highlights the access challenges.

**Applicability to U.S.**: Australia's experience confirms that rescheduling alone is insufficient -- it must be accompanied by insurance coverage, workforce development, and affordability measures to achieve meaningful access.

## Pilot Programs and Demonstrations

- **Oregon Psilocybin Services**: The first U.S. regulated psilocybin therapy program (2023-present). Generating real-world data on safety, efficacy, access patterns, and regulatory challenges. Approximately 10,000 sessions completed through 2024.
- **VA Psychedelic Research**: The VA is funding clinical trials of MDMA and psilocybin for veterans with PTSD at multiple medical centers. These studies will generate evidence specific to the veteran population and inform VA coverage decisions.
- **Right-to-Try psychedelic access**: Some advocates have sought to use the federal Right to Try Act (2018) to access psychedelic therapies outside of clinical trials. Legal viability is uncertain but the concept could serve as a pilot for compassionate access.
