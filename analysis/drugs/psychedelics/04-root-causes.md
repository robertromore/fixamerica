# Psychedelics Policy: Root Causes

## Systemic Analysis

The current restrictive framework for psychedelics in the United States is not the result of a single policy failure but of several interlocking structural, political, and institutional factors. Despite growing clinical evidence that psilocybin, MDMA, and other psychedelics have significant therapeutic potential, these substances remain in Schedule I -- the most restrictive federal category, reserved for substances with "no currently accepted medical use" and "high potential for abuse." The persistence of this classification in the face of contradictory evidence reveals deep-rooted systemic problems in how the United States regulates controlled substances, funds mental health research, and responds to political rather than scientific signals.

## Structural Deficiencies in the Controlled Substances Act

### The Schedule I Catch-22

The most fundamental root cause of the psychedelics policy failure is a structural flaw in the Controlled Substances Act itself. Schedule I classification creates a self-reinforcing barrier to the research needed to change the classification:

- **Schedule I substances are defined as having "no currently accepted medical use"** -- yet the scheduling itself makes it extremely difficult to conduct the research that would demonstrate medical use
- Researchers must obtain a DEA Schedule I Researcher Registration (6-12 month average processing time), use only DEA-approved laboratory facilities, store substances in DEA-compliant safes, and submit to periodic inspections
- Research-grade psychedelics must be obtained through the NIDA Drug Supply Program or DEA-licensed manufacturers, creating supply bottlenecks
- Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) at universities and hospitals are often reluctant to approve Schedule I research due to legal liability concerns
- NIH grant reviewers have historically scored psychedelic proposals lower due to perceived political risk, creating a funding disadvantage

**Evidence**: A 2022 Government Accountability Office report found that Schedule I research barriers were "substantial" and that the DEA registration process was "cumbersome and time-consuming," deterring researchers. Between 1970 and 2000, fewer than a dozen human psychedelic studies were approved in the United States (Nutt et al., *Lancet Psychiatry*, 2020).

### DEA Administrative Power Without Scientific Accountability

The DEA holds scheduling authority under the CSA (21 U.S.C. Section 811) and has repeatedly exercised this power in ways that override scientific recommendation:

- In 1985, DEA Administrative Law Judge Francis Young recommended that MDMA be placed in Schedule III, which would have permitted medical use. DEA Administrator John Lawn rejected the recommendation and placed MDMA in Schedule I.
- In 1988, Judge Young ruled that marijuana should be rescheduled to Schedule II, calling it "one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man." The DEA rejected this recommendation as well.
- The DEA has denied every rescheduling petition for psychedelics filed since 1970

**Evidence**: The structural problem is that the DEA -- a law enforcement agency -- has final scheduling authority. Its institutional mission is drug enforcement, not therapeutic access. This creates an inherent conflict of interest when evaluating substances for medical potential.

## Political Economy

### Who Benefits from the Status Quo

| Actor | Benefit | Economic Value | Incentive to Block Reform |
|-------|---------|----------------|---------------------------|
| DEA and drug enforcement agencies | Budget justification, scheduling authority, enforcement missions | DEA budget: $3.3 billion (FY2024) | Rescheduling reduces enforcement mandate and budget justification |
| Pharmaceutical companies (conventional) | Antidepressant and anxiolytic markets maintained | U.S. antidepressant market: ~$15 billion annually (IQVIA, 2023) | Psychedelic therapies could displace long-term daily medication revenue |
| Private prison industry | Continued criminalization ensures prisoner pipeline | CoreCivic and GEO Group combined revenue: $3.8 billion (2023) | Drug offenses remain a significant share of federal inmates (45% of BOP population) |
| Drug testing companies | Schedule I status ensures testing demand | U.S. drug testing market: $5.7 billion (2023) | Rescheduling reduces testing demand |
| Professional licensing boards | Gatekeeping role reinforced by prohibition | N/A | Reform requires new credentialing frameworks |

### Perverse Incentives

The current system creates several perverse incentives that perpetuate the status quo:

1. **Enforcement agencies benefit from maintaining Schedule I status** because it justifies larger budgets, broader surveillance authority, and more personnel
2. **Pharmaceutical companies profit more from daily medications** (SSRIs average $200-400/month) than from one-to-three-session psychedelic therapies that could produce lasting improvement
3. **Academic researchers face career risk** from associating with Schedule I substances, creating a chilling effect on the research pipeline
4. **Insurance companies have no reimbursement framework** for psychedelic-assisted therapy, which requires multi-hour sessions with trained therapists -- a model that does not fit standard billing codes

## Institutional and Bureaucratic Inertia

### FDA Regulatory Framework Not Designed for Psychedelic Therapy

The FDA's drug approval pathway was designed for pharmaceutical products (pills, injections) administered independently by patients, not for therapist-assisted experiences requiring multi-hour supervised sessions:

- **No standard regulatory category** for drug-plus-therapy combination treatments
- **Blinding challenges**: Psychedelics produce recognizable effects, making double-blind placebo-controlled trials -- the FDA gold standard -- difficult to design
- **Therapist variable**: Treatment outcomes depend partly on therapist skill, rapport, and adherence to protocols, introducing a variable that pharmaceutical trials do not typically address
- **Session duration**: Psilocybin therapy sessions last 6-8 hours; MDMA sessions last 8-12 hours. The FDA's standard clinical trial design does not easily accommodate this format

**Evidence**: The FDA's June 2023 draft guidance on psychedelic drug development acknowledged these challenges explicitly, noting the need for "novel approaches" to clinical trial design, including potentially unblinded studies with appropriate controls.

### NIDA Funding Bias Toward Abuse Research

The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), which is the primary NIH funder of research on controlled substances, has an institutional mandate focused on drug abuse and addiction, not therapeutic applications:

- NIDA's budget (~$1.6 billion in FY2024) is oriented toward understanding and preventing substance abuse
- Research proposals framing psychedelics as therapeutic agents rather than drugs of abuse have historically received lower priority
- Until 2023, NIH/NIDA had not issued a specific funding opportunity announcement (FOA) for psychedelic therapy research

**Evidence**: Between 2000 and 2020, NIDA funded fewer than 20 grants related to psychedelic therapy research, compared to hundreds for opioid and stimulant abuse research (NIMH portfolio analysis, 2023). NIMH has begun to fill this gap, but funding remains a fraction of the need.

## Cultural and Ideological Factors

### The Stigma Legacy of the War on Drugs

The deliberate association of psychedelics with the 1960s counterculture, anti-war movement, and social disruption created a stigma that persists in public attitudes, media coverage, and political discourse:

- **Public perception**: Many Americans still associate psychedelics primarily with recreational drug use, "bad trips," and the counterculture, rather than with clinical medicine
- **Media framing**: Despite the growing evidence base, media coverage often defaults to sensationalized narratives about psychedelic experiences rather than clinical outcomes
- **Political framing**: "Tough on drugs" rhetoric remains politically potent in many constituencies, making elected officials reluctant to champion psychedelic reform

**Evidence**: A 2023 Pew Research Center poll found that 61% of Americans support further research on psychedelics for therapeutic use, but only 36% support full legalization. The gap between support for "research" and support for "legalization" reflects lingering stigma.

### "Just Say No" Cultural Inertia

The Reagan-era "Just Say No" campaign and the D.A.R.E. program (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) instilled a generation-spanning association between all illegal drugs -- regardless of pharmacological properties -- and moral failure. This cultural framework:

- Makes no distinction between addiction-prone substances (opioids, methamphetamine) and psychedelics (which produce tolerance rapidly and have low addictive potential)
- Treats any positive claim about an illegal substance as "pro-drug" advocacy rather than scientific information
- Creates political risk for elected officials who support evidence-based reform

## Regulatory Fragmentation

### Federal-State Conflict

The absence of a coherent federal framework creates a patchwork system with contradictory incentives:

- Oregon and Colorado have created state-regulated psychedelic programs that exist in legal tension with federal Schedule I classification
- State-licensed practitioners and service centers technically violate federal law
- Banks and financial institutions are reluctant to serve psychedelic businesses due to federal illegality (the same problem that plagues cannabis businesses)
- Interstate commerce in psychedelic substances is federally prohibited, preventing efficient supply chains

### No Single Federal Agency Owns the Issue

Psychedelics policy responsibility is fragmented across multiple federal agencies with different missions:

- **DEA**: Scheduling and enforcement
- **FDA**: Drug approval and safety
- **NIDA/NIMH/NIH**: Research funding
- **SAMHSA**: Treatment services
- **VA**: Veteran healthcare
- **HHS**: Overall health policy coordination

No single agency has a mandate to develop a comprehensive psychedelic policy, and the agencies with the most institutional power (DEA) have the least incentive to reform.

## Why Reform Has Failed

Despite growing scientific evidence and shifting public attitudes, federal psychedelic reform has not yet succeeded for several compounding reasons:

1. **Congressional inaction**: No psychedelic reform bill has reached a floor vote in either chamber of Congress. Bills introduced (such as the Breakthrough Therapies Act and the Right to Try Clarification Act for psychedelics) have stalled in committee.
2. **DEA institutional resistance**: The DEA has not initiated a rescheduling review for any classical psychedelic substance, and its track record of rejecting rescheduling petitions suggests institutional resistance to reform.
3. **FDA setback**: The August 2024 MDMA decision, while based on methodological concerns rather than rejection of psychedelic therapy, delayed the first potential federal approval and dampened reform momentum.
4. **Pharmaceutical industry ambivalence**: While psychedelic biotech companies support reform, the larger pharmaceutical industry (which profits from daily medications that psychedelic therapy could displace) has not actively lobbied for scheduling reform.
5. **Divided advocacy**: The psychedelic reform movement includes both medical model advocates (who favor FDA-approved therapy) and broader decriminalization advocates (who favor personal use access), creating strategic tensions that dilute political pressure.
6. **Political polarization**: Drug policy remains a polarized issue. While bipartisan support exists for veteran-focused psychedelic research, broader reform proposals face reflexive opposition from "tough on drugs" constituencies.
