# Psychedelics Policy: Current State

## Clinical Research Pipeline

The psychedelic research renaissance has produced a substantial and growing body of clinical evidence. As of 2024, more than 100 clinical trials involving psilocybin are registered on ClinicalTrials.gov, with dozens more studying MDMA, LSD, DMT, and other compounds. Research is concentrated at major academic medical centers and supported by a mix of nonprofit organizations, private pharmaceutical companies, and emerging federal funding.

### Psilocybin Research

Psilocybin is the most extensively studied psychedelic in modern clinical trials. The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to psilocybin therapy for treatment-resistant depression (Compass Pathways, 2018) and for major depressive disorder (Usona Institute, 2019).

| Trial/Study | Institution | Indication | Key Finding | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| COMP360 Phase 2b | Compass Pathways | Treatment-resistant depression | 29.1% remission at 3 weeks (25 mg dose) | Goodwin et al., *NEJM*, 2022 |
| Usona Phase 2 | Usona Institute/multiple sites | Major depressive disorder | Significant reduction in MADRS scores vs. niacin placebo | Raison et al., *JAMA*, 2023 |
| Hopkins pilot | Johns Hopkins | Major depression | 71% response, 54% remission at 4 weeks | Davis et al., *JAMA Psychiatry*, 2021 |
| NYU end-of-life | NYU Langone | Cancer-related distress | 60-80% showed clinically significant reduction in anxiety and depression at 6.5 months | Griffiths et al., *Journal of Psychopharmacology*, 2016 |
| Alcohol use disorder | NYU | Alcohol use disorder | 83% reduction in heavy drinking days | Bogenschutz et al., *JAMA Psychiatry*, 2022 |
| Tobacco cessation | Johns Hopkins | Smoking cessation | 80% abstinence at 6 months (pilot) | Johnson et al., *Journal of Psychopharmacology*, 2014 |

### MDMA Research

MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD has advanced furthest toward FDA approval. The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) sponsored Phase 3 clinical trials that demonstrated significant efficacy.

| Trial | Phase | Key Finding | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| MAPP1 (MAPS Phase 3) | Phase 3 | 67% no longer met PTSD diagnostic criteria; 33% remission | Mitchell et al., *Nature Medicine*, 2021 |
| MAPP2 (MAPS Phase 3) | Phase 3 | 71.2% no longer met PTSD criteria at 18-month follow-up | Mitchell et al., *Nature Medicine*, 2023 |
| FDA Advisory Committee | NDA review | 9-2 vote against recommending approval (June 2024) | FDA AdComm Proceedings, 2024 |
| FDA Complete Response Letter | NDA decision | FDA declined to approve; requested additional clinical trial | Lykos Therapeutics, August 2024 |

The FDA's August 2024 decision not to approve MDMA-assisted therapy was based on concerns about the adequacy of the clinical trial design -- specifically, challenges with blinding due to MDMA's recognizable effects, therapist adherence issues, and insufficient diversity in trial participants -- rather than a rejection of the underlying scientific premise. Lykos Therapeutics (formerly MAPS Public Benefit Corporation) has indicated it will conduct an additional Phase 3 trial to address these concerns.

### Other Compounds Under Investigation

| Compound | Indication | Trial Stage | Key Sponsor | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| LSD | Generalized anxiety disorder | Phase 2 | MindMed (Project Lucy) | MindMed, 2024 |
| LSD microdosing | ADHD, depression | Phase 2 | MindMed | MindMed, 2024 |
| DMT (IV) | Treatment-resistant depression | Phase 2 | Small Pharma/Cybin | Cybin, 2024 |
| 5-MeO-DMT | Treatment-resistant depression | Phase 1 | GH Research | GH Research, 2024 |
| Ibogaine | Opioid use disorder | Observational/Phase 1 | MAPS, academic centers | Davis et al., *Nature*, 2024 |
| Mescaline | Various | Preclinical/observational | Academic centers | Limited data |

### Research Funding

| Source | Estimated Annual Funding (2024) | Trend | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Private/venture capital | >$1.5 billion (cumulative since 2019) | Declining from 2021 peak | Psychedelic biotech sector experienced market correction |
| MAPS/nonprofit | ~$70 million annually | Stable | Largest nonprofit funder; MAPS raised $130 million for Phase 3 MDMA trials |
| NIDA/NIH | ~$40 million (FY2024) | Increasing | NIH launched psilocybin research initiatives in 2023 |
| VA/DoD | ~$10 million (FY2024) | Increasing | VA funding MDMA and psilocybin studies for veterans |
| State governments | <$5 million | Emerging | Oregon funding limited program evaluation |

## Federal Scheduling and Regulatory Status

### Current Classification

All classic psychedelics remain Schedule I under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. Section 812):

| Substance | Schedule | CSA Classification Rationale | Year Scheduled |
|---|---|---|---|
| Psilocybin/psilocin | Schedule I | "High potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use" | 1970 |
| MDMA | Schedule I | Same | 1985 (emergency scheduling) |
| LSD | Schedule I | Same | 1968 (initially); CSA 1970 |
| DMT | Schedule I | Same | 1970 |
| Mescaline | Schedule I | Same | 1970 |
| Ibogaine | Schedule I | Same | 1970 |

**Notable exception**: Peyote (containing mescaline) is exempt from Schedule I for members of the Native American Church under the American Indian Religious Freedom Act Amendments of 1994 (42 U.S.C. Section 1996a).

### DEA Research Licensing

Conducting research with Schedule I substances requires a DEA Schedule I Researcher Registration, a process that has historically created significant delays:

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Average time to obtain DEA Schedule I research license | 6-12 months | Researchers' reports; GAO, 2022 |
| Active DEA Schedule I research registrations for psilocybin (2024) | ~75 | DEA, estimated from registrations |
| NIDA Drug Supply Program: psilocybin available | Yes (since 2022) | NIDA, 2023 |
| NIDA Drug Supply Program: MDMA available | Yes | NIDA, 2023 |
| Federally authorized psilocybin suppliers | Limited (primarily Usona, academic synthesis) | DEA/NIDA, 2024 |

### FDA Regulatory Pathway

The FDA has established a clear pathway for psychedelic-assisted therapy approval:

1. **Breakthrough Therapy Designation**: Granted for psilocybin (2018, 2019) and MDMA (2017); enables accelerated development and review
2. **Phase 1-3 Clinical Trials**: Standard drug development process with additional considerations for therapist-assisted models
3. **New Drug Application (NDA)**: Lykos filed NDA for MDMA-assisted PTSD therapy in late 2023; FDA issued Complete Response Letter in August 2024
4. **Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS)**: Expected to be required for any approved psychedelic therapy, including therapist training and certification requirements
5. **Advisory Committee Review**: FDA advisory panels provide non-binding recommendations

The FDA has issued draft guidance on psychedelic drug development (June 2023) addressing unique considerations including therapist qualifications, session monitoring, and blinding challenges.

## State and Local Reform

### Oregon Measure 109 (Psilocybin Services)

Oregon voters approved Measure 109 in November 2020 with 55.8% of the vote. The Oregon Psilocybin Services (OPS) program launched in January 2023.

| Feature | Detail | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Effective date | January 1, 2023 (service centers opening mid-2023) | Oregon Revised Statutes 475A |
| Regulatory body | Oregon Health Authority, Psilocybin Advisory Board | OHA, 2024 |
| Licenses issued (by end 2024) | ~30 service centers, ~300 facilitators | Oregon Psilocybin Services, 2024 |
| Client sessions completed (through 2024) | ~10,000 estimated | OPS Program Reports, 2024 |
| Session cost | $1,500-$3,500 (not covered by insurance) | Service center price surveys, 2024 |
| Facilitator training requirement | 120-160 hours (didactic + practicum) | OAR 333-333 |
| Medical prescription required | No (client-directed, 21+ years) | Oregon Measure 109 |
| Local opt-out | Permitted; ~100 jurisdictions have opted out | OPS, 2024 |

**Key challenges**: High cost and lack of insurance coverage limit access. Approximately 100 Oregon jurisdictions (out of 242 cities and 36 counties) have opted out. The program has no medical gatekeeping requirement, which supporters view as expanding access and critics view as insufficient safety oversight.

### Colorado Natural Medicine Health Act (Proposition 122)

Colorado voters approved Proposition 122 in November 2022 with 53.6% of the vote.

| Feature | Detail | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Substances covered | Psilocybin, psilocin, DMT, ibogaine, mescaline (excluding peyote) | Colorado Revised Statutes 12-170 |
| Effective date | Phased: decriminalization immediate (2023); regulated access by 2026 | Prop 122 text |
| Regulatory body | Colorado Department of Regulatory Agencies (DORA), Natural Medicine Advisory Board | DORA, 2024 |
| Personal use | Decriminalized for adults 21+ (immediate) | Prop 122 Section 5 |
| Healing centers | Licensed "healing centers" to be operational by 2026 | Prop 122 Section 6 |
| Personal cultivation | Permitted for adults 21+ (psilocybin only) | Prop 122 Section 5 |
| Local opt-out | Permitted | Prop 122 text |

### Municipal Decriminalization

As of 2024, over 15 U.S. cities and jurisdictions have passed measures decriminalizing psychedelic plants and fungi:

| Jurisdiction | Year | Scope | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| Denver, CO | 2019 | Psilocybin mushrooms | Ballot initiative (50.6%) |
| Oakland, CA | 2019 | All entheogenic plants/fungi | City council resolution |
| Santa Cruz, CA | 2020 | All entheogenic plants/fungi | City council resolution |
| Ann Arbor, MI | 2020 | All entheogenic plants/fungi | City council resolution |
| Washington, D.C. | 2020 | All entheogenic plants/fungi | Ballot initiative (76.2%) |
| Somerville, MA | 2021 | All entheogenic plants/fungi | City council resolution |
| Cambridge, MA | 2021 | All entheogenic plants/fungi | City council resolution |
| Northampton, MA | 2021 | All entheogenic plants/fungi | City council resolution |
| Seattle, WA | 2021 | All entheogenic plants/fungi | City council resolution |
| Detroit, MI | 2021 | All entheogenic plants/fungi | Ballot initiative (61.1%) |
| San Francisco, CA | 2022 | All entheogenic plants/fungi | Board of Supervisors resolution |
| Minneapolis, MN | 2023 | All entheogenic plants/fungi | City council resolution |

### Emerging State Legislation

Several states have introduced or advanced psychedelic-related legislation:

| State | Status (2024) | Key Provisions |
|---|---|---|
| Connecticut | Task force established (2023) | Study therapeutic psilocybin access |
| Texas | Funded study (2021, renewed 2023) | $2.8 million for MDMA/psilocybin research for veterans |
| Massachusetts | Bills introduced (2023-2024) | Psilocybin therapy legalization; under committee review |
| New Jersey | Bills introduced (2024) | Psilocybin-assisted therapy pilot program |
| California | SB 58 vetoed by governor (2023) | Would have decriminalized psilocybin, DMT, mescaline for adults 21+ |
| Vermont | Study commission (2023) | Evaluate therapeutic psilocybin access |
| Hawaii | Resolution passed (2023) | Establish therapeutic psilocybin task force |
| Utah | Bill introduced (2024) | MDMA/psilocybin research for veterans |

## Religious and Indigenous Use

### Native American Church Peyote Exemption

The use of peyote in bona fide religious ceremonies of the Native American Church (NAC) has been federally protected since 1994 under the American Indian Religious Freedom Act Amendments (42 U.S.C. Section 1996a). The exemption applies only to enrolled members of federally recognized tribes.

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Estimated NAC membership | 250,000-400,000 | Scholarly estimates, 2020 |
| Federal protection | American Indian Religious Freedom Act Amendments (1994) | 42 U.S.C. Section 1996a |
| DEA regulatory exemption | 21 C.F.R. Section 1307.31 | DEA regulations |
| Peyote conservation status | Threatened (slow-growing, overharvested) | Texas Parks & Wildlife, 2023 |

### Ayahuasca Churches

Two ayahuasca-using churches have obtained federal legal protections through Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) litigation:

- **UDV (Uniao do Vegetal)**: Won unanimous Supreme Court ruling in *Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal*, 546 U.S. 418 (2006), securing the right to import and use ayahuasca (containing DMT) in religious ceremonies.
- **Santo Daime (Church of the Holy Light of the Queen)**: Obtained a federal court injunction in 2009 (*Church of the Holy Light of the Queen v. Mukasey*, 615 F.Supp.2d 1210 (D. Or. 2009)) protecting ceremonial ayahuasca use.

### Indigenous Equity Concerns

Indigenous communities have raised significant concerns about the psychedelic commercialization movement:

- **Peyote depletion**: Wild peyote populations in South Texas are declining due to habitat loss and overharvesting; commercial demand could worsen this
- **Cultural appropriation**: Commercialization of traditional practices without indigenous consent or benefit-sharing
- **Exclusion from markets**: Indigenous communities lack capital to participate in licensed psychedelic therapy markets
- **National Council of Native American Churches** has called for peyote to be excluded from broader decriminalization measures to protect limited supply

## Mental Health Context

The psychedelic research renaissance is occurring against a backdrop of severe mental health crisis in the United States:

### Key Indicators Table

| Indicator | Current Value | 5-Year Trend | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| U.S. adults with any mental illness (2023) | 59.3 million (23.1%) | Increasing | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |
| Adults with serious mental illness (2023) | 16.2 million (6.3%) | Increasing | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |
| Adults with treatment-resistant depression | ~8.9 million | Stable (as share of MDD) | STAR*D estimates, NIMH |
| Adults with PTSD in a given year | ~13 million | Increasing | NIMH, 2023 |
| Veterans with PTSD receiving VA care | ~1.7 million | Increasing | VA NCPTSD, 2024 |
| Veteran suicides per day (2021) | 17.5 | Slight decrease from 2020 | VA National Suicide Prevention Report, 2023 |
| Adults receiving mental health treatment (2023) | 55.0 million (21.5%) | Increasing | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |
| Antidepressant prescriptions filled (2023) | ~300 million | Stable | IQVIA, 2024 |

### Treatment Gaps

Conventional psychiatric treatments fail a substantial share of patients:

- **Treatment-resistant depression**: Approximately 30% of patients with major depressive disorder do not respond adequately to two or more antidepressant trials (the clinical definition of treatment resistance), representing an estimated 8.9 million adults
- **PTSD treatment dropout**: Up to 50% of PTSD patients drop out of evidence-based psychotherapy (prolonged exposure, cognitive processing therapy) before completion (Hoge et al., *JAMA Psychiatry*, 2023)
- **Antidepressant limitations**: SSRIs and SNRIs typically take 4-8 weeks to show effect and produce meaningful symptom reduction in only 40-60% of patients (Cipriani et al., *Lancet*, 2018)
- **Substance use disorder**: Only 24% of the 48.7 million Americans with SUD received any form of treatment in 2023 (SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024)

## Emerging Challenges

### Market and Investment Dynamics

The psychedelic pharmaceutical sector experienced a boom-and-bust cycle. After attracting more than $1.5 billion in investment between 2019 and 2022, the sector saw significant market corrections in 2023-2024 following the FDA's MDMA decision and slower-than-expected clinical timelines. Key companies including Compass Pathways and Atai Life Sciences saw share prices decline by more than 70% from 2021 peaks. This capital contraction threatens to slow clinical development.

### Unregulated Use and Underground Markets

As public awareness of psychedelic therapy has grown, so has unregulated use:

- **Underground therapy**: Unlicensed practitioners offer psychedelic-assisted therapy sessions, creating risks of sexual abuse, psychological harm, and medical emergencies without accountability structures
- **Retreat tourism**: Americans travel to Jamaica, Costa Rica, Peru, and Mexico for psychedelic experiences with varying quality and safety standards
- **Self-medication**: Growing numbers of individuals microdose or use psychedelics without clinical guidance, with limited safety data on long-term effects

### Safety Considerations

While psychedelics have a favorable physiological safety profile (low toxicity, no established lethal dose for psilocybin or LSD), psychological risks require careful management:

- **Adverse psychological reactions**: Anxiety, paranoia, psychotic episodes (rare but documented, especially in individuals with personal or family history of psychotic disorders)
- **Therapist misconduct**: Reports of sexual abuse and boundary violations in underground and clinical psychedelic therapy settings
- **Cardiac risk (MDMA)**: MDMA carries cardiovascular risks including tachycardia and hypertension, particularly for individuals with pre-existing cardiac conditions
- **Serotonin syndrome**: Risk with MDMA when combined with SSRIs, MAOIs, or other serotonergic drugs
