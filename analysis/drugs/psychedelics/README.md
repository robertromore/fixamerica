# Psychedelics Policy

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of psychedelics policy in the United States, covering the therapeutic, regulatory, legal, and cultural dimensions of psilocybin, MDMA, LSD, ayahuasca, and other psychedelic substances.

## Overview

Psychedelic substances -- including psilocybin, MDMA, LSD, DMT/ayahuasca, and mescaline -- are experiencing a dramatic scientific and policy reassessment after decades of near-total prohibition under Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. Clinical trials at leading research institutions have demonstrated significant therapeutic potential for treatment-resistant depression, PTSD, anxiety, addiction, and end-of-life distress. The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression (2018) and major depressive disorder (2019), and to MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD (2017), signaling that federal regulators recognize the scientific promise of these compounds.

State-level policy has moved ahead of federal law. Oregon became the first state to legalize regulated psilocybin therapy services through Measure 109 (2020), with licensed service centers opening in 2023. Colorado passed the Natural Medicine Health Act (Proposition 122) in 2022, creating a framework for regulated access to psilocybin, DMT, ibogaine, and mescaline (excluding peyote). Over a dozen cities have decriminalized possession of psychedelic plants and fungi. Yet federal Schedule I classification continues to impede research, restrict clinical access, and create legal uncertainty for state programs.

This analysis examines the scientific evidence for psychedelic therapies, the regulatory and legal barriers to access, the state-level reform landscape, religious use exemptions, equity considerations, and a comprehensive legislative framework for federal reform.
