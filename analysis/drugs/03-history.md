# Drug Policy: History

## Overview

The history of American drug policy is a story of moral panics, racial targeting, political opportunism, and repeated policy failure. From the first federal drug laws in 1914 to the fentanyl crisis of the 2020s, the United States has oscillated between periods of relative tolerance and aggressive prohibition, but the dominant trajectory has been toward ever-harsher criminalization -- even as evidence of its ineffectiveness has mounted. Understanding this history is essential to understanding why current policy is what it is, and what must change.

## The Patent Medicine Era and First Federal Laws (1890s-1930s)

### Context

Before federal drug regulation, Americans had essentially unrestricted access to drugs. Patent medicines containing opium, morphine, cocaine, cannabis, and alcohol were widely sold without prescription. Coca-Cola contained cocaine until 1903. Opium dens operated openly in many cities. An estimated 300,000 Americans were addicted to opiates by 1900, many of them middle-class white women who had been prescribed laudanum or morphine by physicians.

### Harrison Narcotics Tax Act (1914)

- **What it did**: Required registration and taxation of anyone who produced, imported, or distributed opium or coca-derived products. Did not technically prohibit drug use but was interpreted and enforced as a prohibition measure.
- **Racial context**: The Act was propelled by racist narratives -- particularly claims that cocaine made Black men violent and dangerous. Dr. Hamilton Wright, a key proponent, told Congress that cocaine was the "direct incentive" for the "debasing of the negro."
- **Effect**: Transformed drug use from a medical issue into a criminal one. Physicians who prescribed opiates to maintain addicts were prosecuted. The number of addicts in the medical system plummeted, driving them to illicit markets.

### Prohibition (1920-1933) and the Marihuana Tax Act (1937)

- **Alcohol Prohibition** (18th Amendment, 1920): Demonstrated that prohibition of widely used substances creates black markets, organized crime, and corruption. Repealed in 1933 after spectacular failure, but the lesson was not applied to other drugs.
- **Marihuana Tax Act** (1937): Led by Federal Bureau of Narcotics Commissioner Harry Anslinger, who promoted racist claims that cannabis made Mexican Americans and Black people violent and criminal. Congressional hearings lasted approximately two hours. The American Medical Association opposed the Act but was overridden.
- **Anslinger's legacy**: As head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (1930-1962), Anslinger shaped American drug policy for three decades, establishing the template of racialized enforcement and moral panic that persists today. He famously targeted jazz musician Billie Holiday for her heroin use while protecting white celebrities.

## Post-War Period and the Rise of the Drug Enforcement Bureaucracy (1950s-1960s)

### The Boggs Act (1951) and Narcotics Control Act (1956)

- **Established mandatory minimum sentences** for drug offenses for the first time: 2-5 years for first offense possession, 5-10 years for second offense.
- **Reflected Cold War anxieties**: Drug use was framed as a Communist threat to American moral fiber and national security.
- **Impact**: Drug enforcement became a growth industry. The Federal Bureau of Narcotics expanded. State and local police created narcotics bureaus.

### The 1960s Counterculture

- **Context**: The explosion of recreational drug use among young white Americans in the 1960s -- cannabis, LSD, psychedelics -- challenged the framework of prohibition.
- **Timothy Leary**: The Harvard psychologist's advocacy for LSD use ("Turn on, tune in, drop out") provoked a political backlash. His arrest for cannabis possession led to *Leary v. United States* (1969), which struck down the Marihuana Tax Act as unconstitutional (self-incrimination), forcing a legislative replacement.
- **Political dimension**: Drug use was associated with the antiwar movement, civil rights activism, and the counterculture -- making it a political target.

## Nixon and the War on Drugs (1969-1974)

### Declaration of the War on Drugs (1971)

President Richard Nixon declared drug abuse "public enemy number one" on June 17, 1971, launching what he called a "war on drugs" and requesting emergency funding.

### The Political Motivation

Nixon aide John Ehrlichman revealed the political calculation in a 1994 interview published in *Harper's Magazine* in 2016:

> "The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did."

### The Controlled Substances Act (1970)

- **What it created**: The modern drug scheduling system (Schedules I-V) and the framework for federal drug enforcement that persists today.
- **Cannabis classification**: Cannabis was temporarily placed in Schedule I pending review by the Shafer Commission. When the Commission recommended decriminalization in 1972, Nixon rejected the findings and cannabis remained Schedule I permanently.
- **Created the DEA**: The Drug Enforcement Administration was established in 1973 by combining existing federal drug agencies, giving the executive branch a powerful enforcement bureaucracy.

### Nixon's Dual Approach

It is worth noting that Nixon also significantly increased federal funding for drug treatment, including methadone maintenance programs. Federal treatment funding reached 64% of the drug control budget in 1973 -- the highest share in history and far higher than today. This dual approach was abandoned by subsequent administrations.

## The Escalation: Reagan, Crack, and Mandatory Minimums (1980-1992)

### The Reagan War on Drugs

President Ronald Reagan dramatically escalated the War on Drugs, both rhetorically and through policy:

- **"Just Say No"**: First Lady Nancy Reagan's anti-drug campaign became the era's defining slogan. While memorable, it reflected a simplistic moral framework that treated drug use as a choice rather than a medical condition.
- **Zero tolerance**: The administration promoted zero-tolerance policies in schools, workplaces, and communities.
- **Military involvement**: Reagan authorized the use of the U.S. military in drug enforcement for the first time since Prohibition, including border operations and foreign interdiction.

### The Crack Epidemic (1984-1992)

- **The crisis**: The emergence of cheap, smokable crack cocaine in American cities in the mid-1980s coincided with a spike in violent crime and gang activity. Media coverage was intense and racialized, depicting crack as a uniquely destructive "Black drug."
- **The response**: Congress responded with the Anti-Drug Abuse Acts of 1986 and 1988, which:
    - Established **mandatory minimum sentences** for drug offenses (5 years for 5 grams of crack, 10 years for 50 grams)
    - Created the **100:1 crack/powder cocaine sentencing disparity**: 5 grams of crack triggered the same mandatory minimum as 500 grams of powder cocaine. Since crack users were predominantly Black and powder cocaine users were predominantly white, this created massive racial disparities by design.
    - Established the **drug czar** position (Director of ONDCP)
    - Created the **federal death penalty** for drug "kingpins"
- **Impact**: Between 1980 and 2000, the number of Americans incarcerated for drug offenses increased from approximately 41,000 to over 450,000 -- a tenfold increase. Black Americans bore the overwhelming brunt.

### George H.W. Bush

- Continued Reagan's approach. In 1989, Bush held up a bag of crack cocaine in an Oval Office address, claiming it had been purchased across the street from the White House (the DEA had orchestrated the sale specifically for the speech).
- Federal drug enforcement budget rose from $4.7 billion in 1988 to $12.7 billion in 1993.

## The Clinton Era: Expansion of the Drug War (1993-2000)

### "Tough on Crime" Democrats

President Bill Clinton, determined to inoculate Democrats from "soft on crime" attacks, expanded the drug war rather than reforming it:

- **1994 Crime Bill** (Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act): Allocated $9.7 billion for prison construction, expanded the federal death penalty to include additional drug offenses, and created the "three strikes" provision for federal offenses.
- **Welfare reform** (1996): Imposed a lifetime ban on TANF (welfare) and SNAP (food stamps) benefits for anyone convicted of a drug felony, affecting millions of the poorest Americans and their children.
- **Clinton's record**: The federal prison population grew by 60% during the Clinton years. The racial incarceration disparity reached its peak.

### International Drug War

- **Plan Colombia** (2000): A $1.3 billion military aid package to Colombia for coca eradication and counternarcotics operations. The program succeeded in reducing Colombian cocaine production but displaced it to other countries, with no lasting reduction in cocaine availability in the United States.
- **War on drugs in Mexico**: U.S. pressure on Mexican drug trafficking organizations contributed to cartel fragmentation and escalating violence.

---

## The Opioid Epidemic: Phase One -- Prescription Opioids (1996-2010)

### The Origins

- **OxyContin launch** (1996): Purdue Pharma introduced OxyContin with an aggressive marketing campaign claiming it had low addiction potential due to its extended-release formulation. Sales representatives told physicians that the risk of addiction was "less than one percent" -- a claim based on a misrepresented single-paragraph letter in the *New England Journal of Medicine* (Porter & Jick, 1980).
- **"Pain as the fifth vital sign"**: The American Pain Society and Veterans Health Administration promoted aggressive pain treatment. The Joint Commission (which accredits hospitals) incorporated pain management into its standards. This created institutional pressure to prescribe opioids.
- **FDA failure**: The FDA approved OxyContin's labeling claim of lower abuse potential despite limited evidence. It did not require Purdue to conduct adequate abuse-liability studies.
- **DEA failure**: Despite receiving reports of OxyContin diversion and abuse, the DEA did not restrict distribution quotas for years. Internal DEA memos show that officials were aware of the crisis and failed to act.

### The Scale

- **Prescribing peak** (2012): U.S. physicians wrote 255 million opioid prescriptions -- enough for every adult in the country to have a bottle. The prescribing rate was 81.3 per 100 persons, with some counties exceeding 150 prescriptions per 100 residents.
- **Addiction**: An estimated 2.1 million Americans had an opioid use disorder related to prescription painkillers by 2012. Approximately 80% of people who later used heroin reported that their opioid use began with prescription painkillers.

### Accountability

- **Purdue Pharma**: In 2007, three Purdue executives pleaded guilty to federal charges of misbranding OxyContin and paid $634 million in fines -- a fraction of the company's profits. No executive served prison time. The company subsequently filed for bankruptcy (2019) amid thousands of lawsuits.
- **The Sackler family**: The family that owns Purdue Pharma extracted over $10 billion from the company before bankruptcy. Their liability has been the subject of protracted litigation culminating in a $6 billion settlement plan.

## The Opioid Epidemic: Phase Two -- Heroin and Fentanyl (2010-Present)

### The Transition to Heroin

As prescribing restrictions tightened after 2010 (new OxyContin formulation, state PDMP programs, DEA enforcement), many people with opioid use disorders transitioned to cheaper, more accessible heroin. Heroin deaths tripled between 2010 and 2015 (from 3,036 to 12,989).

### The Fentanyl Wave (2014-Present)

- **What changed**: Illicitly manufactured fentanyl (IMF), produced primarily in Mexico using Chinese-sourced precursor chemicals, entered the U.S. drug supply beginning around 2013-2014. Fentanyl is 50-100 times more potent than morphine and far cheaper to produce than heroin (it requires no agricultural inputs -- only chemical precursors).
- **Contamination of the drug supply**: Fentanyl is now found not only in heroin but also in counterfeit prescription pills, cocaine, methamphetamine, and other drugs. Many overdose victims had no idea they were consuming fentanyl.
- **Death toll**: Synthetic opioid deaths rose from 3,007 in 2010 to over 75,000 in 2023 -- a 2,400% increase.
- **Policy implications**: Fentanyl fundamentally undermines supply-side enforcement. Because it is synthetic, it cannot be eradicated at the source like coca or opium poppies. A lethal dose can be as small as 2 milligrams, making it nearly impossible to interdict effectively.

---

## The Reform Era: Partial Shifts (2010-Present)

### Sentencing Reform

- **Fair Sentencing Act** (2010): Reduced the crack/powder cocaine sentencing disparity from 100:1 to 18:1 (but did not achieve the 1:1 parity recommended by the U.S. Sentencing Commission).
- **First Step Act** (2018): Bipartisan criminal justice reform that reduced some mandatory minimums, allowed retroactive application of the Fair Sentencing Act, and expanded early release programs. Approximately 4,000 people were released in the first year, most of them incarcerated for crack cocaine offenses.
- **Attorney General guidance**: The Obama administration (Holder memoranda) and, partially, the Trump administration deprioritized prosecution of low-level drug offenders.

### Cannabis Legalization

- **Colorado and Washington** (2012): First states to legalize recreational cannabis by ballot initiative.
- **Rapid expansion**: By 2024, 24 states and D.C. had legalized recreational cannabis. The industry generates $33.6 billion in annual revenue and employs 440,000 people.
- **Federal non-enforcement**: The Obama administration issued the Cole Memorandum (2013) directing federal prosecutors not to prioritize cannabis enforcement in legalization states. The Trump administration rescinded it (Sessions memo, 2018) but did not increase enforcement. The Biden administration renewed non-enforcement and initiated rescheduling.
- **Banking**: The SAFE Banking Act, which would allow cannabis businesses access to banking services, has passed the House multiple times but stalled in the Senate.

### Harm Reduction Expansion

- **Naloxone**: Expanded access through standing orders, pharmacy distribution, and community programs. Over-the-counter approval (Narcan) in 2023.
- **Syringe service programs**: Expanded from approximately 200 in 2010 to over 430 by 2024.
- **Good Samaritan laws**: Adopted by 48 states and D.C., providing limited immunity from prosecution for people who call 911 during an overdose.
- **Fentanyl test strips**: Legalized for harm reduction purposes in approximately 35 states (previously classified as drug paraphernalia in many jurisdictions).
- **Supervised consumption**: OnPoint NYC opened the first two authorized overdose prevention centers in the United States in November 2021.

### Treatment Access

- **Affordable Care Act** (2010): Required insurance plans to cover substance use disorder treatment as an essential health benefit, dramatically expanding coverage in theory. Implementation has been uneven.
- **X-waiver elimination** (2023): Removed the requirement for physicians to obtain a special waiver to prescribe buprenorphine, theoretically allowing any licensed physician to prescribe. Take-up has been slower than hoped.
- **Telehealth expansion**: COVID-19 pandemic emergency measures allowed telehealth prescribing of buprenorphine, which was made permanent in 2024.

### Oregon's Experiment and Reversal

- **Measure 110** (2020): Oregon became the first state to decriminalize personal possession of all drugs, replacing criminal penalties with $100 citations and referrals to treatment. Funded by cannabis tax revenue.
- **Implementation challenges**: Treatment infrastructure was slow to develop, and citation compliance was very low (under 1% of citations resulted in treatment engagement).
- **Reversal** (2024): Facing public concerns about open drug use in Portland and rising overdose deaths (driven primarily by fentanyl), the Oregon legislature recriminalized personal possession in 2024, making possession a misdemeanor again. The reversal was widely debated as either evidence that decriminalization "failed" or evidence that decriminalization without adequate treatment infrastructure is insufficient.

## Lessons from History

### 1. Prohibition Does Not Eliminate Drug Use

No drug prohibition has ever eliminated use of the targeted substance. Alcohol Prohibition failed. The War on Drugs failed. Drug use rates in the United States are comparable to or higher than those in countries with far less punitive approaches.

### 2. Enforcement Falls Disproportionately on Communities of Color

From the Harrison Act's targeting of Chinese opium users and Black cocaine users, through Anslinger's racialized cannabis campaigns, to the crack/powder disparity, drug enforcement has consistently been applied most aggressively against communities of color -- even when white Americans use drugs at similar rates.

### 3. Supply-Side Enforcement Creates Perverse Effects

Successful interdiction of one drug or one supply route consistently leads to substitution (the "balloon effect") or the emergence of more potent alternatives. The crackdown on prescription opioids drove users to heroin; the crackdown on heroin created a market for fentanyl, which is far deadlier.

### 4. Treatment Works When Available

Methadone maintenance, introduced under Nixon in the early 1970s, has been consistently shown to reduce opioid use, overdose deaths, criminal behavior, and HIV transmission. Yet decades of stigma and regulatory barriers have kept it from reaching the majority of people who could benefit.

### 5. Political Incentives Favor Punishment Over Health

The War on Drugs has been politically useful to both parties. "Tough on crime" positions carry less political risk than treatment-oriented approaches, even when the evidence overwhelmingly favors the latter. Every expansion of the drug war has followed a moral panic amplified by media and exploited by politicians.

### 6. Corporate Accountability Requires Enforcement

The pharmaceutical industry's role in creating the opioid epidemic demonstrates that corporate actors will prioritize profit over safety when enforcement is weak. The FDA and DEA failed to exercise their existing authority, and criminal accountability for pharmaceutical executives has been virtually nonexistent.
