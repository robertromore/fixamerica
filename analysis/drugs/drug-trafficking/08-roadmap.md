# Drug Trafficking: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

This roadmap implements a three-phase counter-trafficking reform strategy that builds progressively from technology modernization and institutional capacity building to demand reduction investment and international partnership reform. Each phase establishes the preconditions for the next, creating compounding pressure on trafficking organizations through simultaneous supply disruption, financial degradation, and demand shrinkage. The strategy recognizes that enforcement alone cannot defeat trafficking and that demand reduction is essential to sustainable progress.

---

## Phase 1: Technology Modernization and Institutional Strengthening (Years 1-2)

### Objectives

- Deploy non-intrusive inspection (NII) technology at 50 highest-volume ports of entry
- Triple FinCEN analytical capacity and begin Corporate Transparency Act implementation
- Establish U.S.-China Counter-Narcotics Working Group
- Create DOJ digital trafficking task force
- Remove remaining barriers to medication-assisted treatment prescribing

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Procure and install 100 NII systems at top 50 ports of entry | CBP | Months 1-18 | $2 billion procurement; 500 new CBP officers | NII coverage at 50 top ports; scanning rate >40% of commercial vehicles |
| Triple FinCEN staff from 300 to 900 analysts | Treasury/FinCEN | Months 1-12 | $300 million annually; federal hiring authority | SAR analysis rate increases from <20% to 50% |
| Launch CTA beneficial ownership database | FinCEN | Months 1-6 | Per CTA requirements | Database operational; 5+ million entities registered |
| Establish U.S.-China Counter-Narcotics Working Group | State Department/ONDCP | Months 1-6 | $50 million diplomatic program | Quarterly senior-level meetings; precursor watchlist agreed |
| Create 500-person DOJ digital trafficking task force | DOJ/FBI/DEA | Months 1-12 | $300 million annually | Task force operational; first dark web takedown operations |
| Eliminate X-waiver equivalents and MAT prescribing barriers | HHS/SAMHSA/DEA | Months 1-6 | Regulatory action (minimal cost) | All licensed physicians can prescribe buprenorphine |

### Legislative Requirements

- FY2026 supplemental appropriation for NII technology procurement ($2 billion)
- FY2026 appropriation for FinCEN expansion ($300 million)
- Authorization for DOJ digital trafficking task force ($300 million)
- SAMHSA block grant expansion authorization ($2 billion increase)

### Expected Outcomes

By the end of Phase 1, the U.S. will have significantly increased its technological capacity to interdict fentanyl at ports of entry, strengthened its ability to detect and disrupt money laundering, established diplomatic frameworks for precursor chemical cooperation with China, and removed regulatory barriers to treatment access. These are necessary preconditions for the more ambitious reforms in Phases 2 and 3.

- Close treatment gap to below 40% (from 76% baseline)
- Reduce overdose deaths by 50% from 2023 baseline (target: below 54,000/year)
- Achieve measurable reduction in cartel revenues and Mexican drug violence
- Establish sustainable international counter-narcotics cooperation frameworks

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Achieve 40/60 budget ratio | ONDCP/Congress | FY2031-2035 | Redirect additional $4.6 billion to demand reduction | 40/60 ratio sustained |
| Expand MAT access to all correctional facilities | BOP/state DOCs | Years 6-10 | $1 billion annually | 100% of incarcerated individuals with OUD offered MAT |
| Establish overdose prevention centers in 50 highest-overdose cities | HHS/SAMHSA | Years 6-8 | $500 million annually | 50 OPCs operational; measurable overdose reduction |

| Implement AI-driven precursor chemical monitoring system | DEA/Treasury/China | Years 6-8 | $500 million | Real-time tracking of precursor shipments |

### Expected Outcomes

By the end of Phase 3, the United States will have fundamentally rebalanced its counter-trafficking approach from enforcement-dominant to demand-reduction-dominant. Overdose deaths will have been reduced by at least 50%, treatment access will be broadly available, and cartel revenues will have been meaningfully degraded through combined financial disruption and demand reduction. International partnerships will be institutionalized and sustainable.

## Governance and Oversight

- **ONDCP**: Primary coordinating body for the National Drug Control Strategy, responsible for budget certification, interagency coordination, and annual progress reporting to Congress
- **Congressional oversight**: Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control and House Judiciary Committee receive quarterly briefings on implementation progress
- **GAO audits**: Annual GAO evaluation of counter-trafficking program effectiveness, including outcome-based assessment (not just input metrics)
- **Independent evaluation**: RAND Corporation or equivalent independent research organization contracted to conduct 5-year and 10-year comprehensive evaluations
- **Interagency task force**: ONDCP-chaired interagency task force meets monthly to coordinate implementation across DEA, CBP, Treasury, State, DOJ, and HHS

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Political Reversal of Demand Reduction Investment

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Build bipartisan support by framing demand reduction as "defunding the cartels." Lock in funding through multi-year authorizations with sunset provisions requiring affirmative Congressional action to terminate. Build state-level coalitions that sustain programs regardless of federal policy shifts.

**Contingency Plan**: If federal demand reduction funding is cut, prioritize state-level funding mechanisms (Medicaid expansion, state block grants) and philanthropic partnerships to maintain minimum treatment capacity.

### Risk 2: U.S.-China Relations Deterioration Undermines Precursor Cooperation

**Likelihood**: Medium-High

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Compartmentalize counter-narcotics cooperation from broader geopolitical disputes. Build redundant supply chain monitoring through partner intelligence services (Australia, UK, Canada). Develop technical capacity to detect precursor shipments without Chinese cooperation.

**Contingency Plan**: If Chinese cooperation collapses, shift to unilateral sanctions against Chinese chemical companies, enhanced precursor detection at Mexican ports, and accelerated demand reduction to reduce the market for fentanyl.

### Risk 3: Cartel Adaptation to Financial Disruption

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Diversify financial disruption methods to cover cryptocurrency, trade-based laundering, real estate, and traditional banking simultaneously. Build adaptive analytical capacity that can identify new laundering methods as they emerge.

**Contingency Plan**: If cartels shift to methods not covered by current regulations, expedite regulatory updates through existing rulemaking authority rather than waiting for new legislation.

### Risk 4: NII Technology Deployment Slows Trade at Border

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Negotiate pre-clearance arrangements with Mexico for northbound commercial traffic. Deploy AI-assisted risk assessment to prioritize high-risk vehicles for secondary inspection. Invest in infrastructure to expand port capacity alongside scanning capacity.

**Contingency Plan**: If trade delays become severe, implement trusted trader programs that allow pre-screened companies to use expedited lanes, focusing NII resources on unknown or high-risk shipments.

### Risk 5: Dark Web Markets Evolve Faster Than Enforcement

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: Low-Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Maintain a dedicated, well-resourced digital task force with private-sector technology partnerships. Focus on marketplace infrastructure (hosting, payment processing) rather than individual vendors. Build international cooperation for cross-jurisdictional takedowns.

**Contingency Plan**: If dark web markets grow beyond enforcement capacity, focus resources on disrupting the most dangerous products (fentanyl, nitazenes) while accepting that lower-risk substances will circulate.
