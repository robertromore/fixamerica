# Drug Trafficking

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of drug trafficking in the United States, covering supply chain dynamics, cartel organizations, interdiction strategies, and the policy debate between supply-side enforcement and demand reduction approaches.

## Overview

Drug trafficking is a multi-billion-dollar transnational enterprise that delivers illegal substances from production zones in Latin America, China, and elsewhere to American consumers. The United States is the world's largest consumer market for illicit drugs, with an estimated retail value exceeding $150 billion annually. Transnational criminal organizations -- principally the Sinaloa Cartel and Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) -- dominate the supply chain for fentanyl, methamphetamine, heroin, and cocaine entering the country. The emergence of synthetic opioids, particularly illicitly manufactured fentanyl, has fundamentally altered trafficking dynamics: a single kilogram of fentanyl can produce 500,000 lethal doses and can be shipped through the mail, rendering traditional agricultural-based interdiction models increasingly obsolete.

Despite the United States spending over $51 billion annually on supply-side drug control efforts including border interdiction, international cooperation, and domestic enforcement, drug availability on American streets has not meaningfully declined. Federal agencies seize only an estimated 5-10% of illicit drugs crossing the border. The rise of dark web marketplaces and cryptocurrency-enabled money laundering has added new layers of complexity to enforcement. This analysis examines the full scope of drug trafficking -- from production and transit to interdiction and prosecution -- and evaluates whether current strategies can succeed or whether a fundamentally different approach is needed.
