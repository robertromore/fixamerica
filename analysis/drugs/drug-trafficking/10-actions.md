# Drug Trafficking: What You Can Do

Drug trafficking policy is shaped by public opinion, political pressure, and citizen engagement. The choices the government makes about how to allocate resources between enforcement and treatment, how to cooperate with international partners, and how to address the fentanyl crisis directly affect whether Americans live or die. Your voice matters.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- Subscribe to the **DEA National Drug Threat Assessment** annual release to understand current trafficking trends and agency priorities
- Follow the **CDC's Drug Overdose Surveillance** data to track overdose deaths in your state and community: <https://www.cdc.gov/overdose-prevention/>
- Read RAND Corporation drug policy research to understand the evidence base for reform: <https://www.rand.org/well-being/justice-policy/centers/dprc.html>
- Follow **InSight Crime** (<https://insightcrime.org/>) for investigative reporting on cartels and organized crime in the Americas

### Make Personal Changes

- Learn to recognize and avoid counterfeit pills -- the DEA warns that 7 out of 10 fentanyl-laced counterfeit pills contain a potentially lethal dose (DEA, 2024). Only use medications prescribed by a licensed physician and dispensed by a licensed pharmacy.
- Carry naloxone (Narcan). Over-the-counter naloxone is available at most pharmacies without a prescription. One dose can reverse an opioid overdose and save a life.
- If you or someone you know has a substance use disorder, contact SAMHSA's National Helpline at **1-800-662-4357** for free, confidential treatment referrals available 24/7.
- Properly dispose of unused prescription medications through DEA Take Back events or pharmacy drop-off programs to prevent diversion.

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact Your Representatives**: Urge members of Congress to support demand reduction funding, anti-money laundering reform, and border technology modernization -- not just enforcement escalation.
- **Submit Public Comments**: When DEA proposes drug scheduling actions or FinCEN proposes AML regulations, submit public comments through regulations.gov.
- **Write Letters to the Editor**: Counter simplistic "just enforce harder" narratives with evidence about the cost-effectiveness of treatment and the failure of enforcement-only approaches.
- **Share Information**: Help others understand that the fentanyl crisis is a public health emergency requiring health-focused responses, not just a border security issue.

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- Form a community coalition to advocate for local treatment capacity. Many communities lack adequate substance use disorder treatment facilities, particularly medication-assisted treatment (MAT) providers.
- Support local naloxone distribution programs. Many health departments and harm reduction organizations distribute free naloxone kits and provide overdose reversal training.
- Host community education events on recognizing and responding to opioid overdoses. The Good Samaritan laws in most states protect people who call 911 during an overdose from drug possession charges.
- Advocate for your local school district to adopt evidence-based drug prevention curricula rather than ineffective programs like D.A.R.E.

### Build Coalitions

- Connect with local harm reduction organizations to support syringe services, drug checking programs, and overdose prevention efforts
- Partner with faith communities that support recovery programs -- many churches, synagogues, and mosques host 12-step meetings and recovery support groups
- Engage business organizations in supporting anti-money laundering reform and beneficial ownership transparency -- legitimate businesses have an interest in clean financial systems
- Build relationships with local law enforcement leaders who support reform. Organizations like Law Enforcement Action Partnership (LEAP) can connect you with reform-minded officers.

## Political Actions

### Contact Elected Officials

**When to Contact**:

- During federal budget debates (January-October annually) -- advocate for drug control budget rebalancing toward demand reduction
- When counter-narcotics legislation is pending in committee (check Congress.gov for current bills)
- After major fentanyl seizures or overdose spikes, when public attention is high
- During election campaigns, when candidates are formulating policy positions

**What to Say - Template Email**:

```
Subject: Rebalance Drug Control Spending to Save Lives

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

I am writing as a constituent from [City/District] to urge you to support
rebalancing our federal drug control budget from enforcement-heavy to
treatment-centered approaches.

The United States currently spends $46.1 billion annually on drug control,
with 57% going to supply reduction (enforcement, interdiction) and only 43%
to demand reduction (treatment, prevention, harm reduction). Despite decades
of increasing enforcement spending, drug availability has not decreased and
107,543 Americans died of overdoses in 2023.

RAND Corporation research consistently shows that treatment is 7-10 times
more cost-effective than enforcement at reducing drug use. I urge you to
support legislation that shifts federal drug control spending to at least
60% demand reduction and 40% supply reduction over the next decade.

Thank you for your service and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say - Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City]. I'm calling
about drug trafficking policy. I'd like the [Representative/Senator] to
support rebalancing federal drug control spending from enforcement to
treatment and prevention. RAND Corporation research shows treatment is
7-10 times more cost-effective than enforcement. Can you please note my
position? Thank you."
```

### Support Legislation

Current or proposed legislation to support:

- **FENTANYL Results Act reauthorization**: Maintains temporary scheduling of fentanyl-related substances while Congress debates permanent scheduling reform -- contact Judiciary Committee members to ensure reauthorization includes demand reduction provisions
- **Corporate Transparency Act implementation**: Supports FinCEN's beneficial ownership database that helps track cartel money laundering -- contact Financial Services Committee members to ensure full funding
- **SAMHSA Block Grant expansion**: Increases federal funding for substance use disorder treatment -- contact Appropriations Committee members to support increased funding
- **Cryptocurrency Anti-Money Laundering legislation**: Would require crypto exchanges to comply with Bank Secrecy Act reporting -- contact Banking Committee members

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "What is your specific plan to reduce the 107,543 overdose deaths that occurred in 2023? How much would you invest in treatment versus enforcement?"
2. "Do you support rebalancing the federal drug control budget to invest more in treatment and prevention? If not, why not, given the evidence that treatment is 7-10 times more cost-effective?"
3. "What is your strategy for disrupting cartel money laundering, which is estimated at $80-100 billion annually through the U.S. financial system?"
4. "How would you approach diplomatic engagement with China on fentanyl precursor chemicals without jeopardizing cooperation?"

**Voting Considerations**:

- Look for candidates who propose specific, evidence-based counter-trafficking strategies rather than vague "secure the border" rhetoric
- Examine candidates' positions on the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, Senate/House Judiciary Committees, and Appropriations subcommittees that oversee drug policy
- Evaluate whether candidates support both enforcement modernization and demand reduction investment, or only one side

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing drug trafficking policy with others, emphasize:

1. **The enforcement-only approach has failed by its own metrics**: The U.S. has spent over $1 trillion on the War on Drugs since 1971, yet drug availability has not decreased and overdose deaths have reached 107,543 per year. The inflation-adjusted price of cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine has fallen while purity has increased.

2. **Treatment is 7-10 times more cost-effective than enforcement**: RAND Corporation research demonstrates that every dollar invested in treatment reduces drug consumption more than every dollar invested in enforcement. Demand reduction is the most effective way to "defund the cartels."

3. **Follow the money**: Drug cartels launder an estimated $80-100 billion through the U.S. financial system annually. Stronger anti-money laundering enforcement -- including beneficial ownership transparency and bank executive accountability -- would degrade cartel operations more effectively than additional border agents.

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "Most drugs come across the border between ports of entry" | ~90% of fentanyl is seized at legal ports of entry, hidden in commercial vehicles and cars. A border wall does not address the primary entry method. | CBP, 2023 |
| "More enforcement spending will reduce drug availability" | Drug enforcement spending has increased from $1.5 billion (1981) to $26.3 billion (FY2025). Drug prices have fallen and availability has increased over the same period. | ONDCP, 2024; DEA data |
| "Harm reduction enables drug use" | Countries with robust harm reduction (Portugal, Switzerland) have lower overdose rates than the U.S. Harm reduction saves lives while connecting people to treatment. | EMCDDA, 2024 |
| "Drug traffickers would stop if penalties were harsher" | The U.S. already imposes some of the harshest drug penalties in the developed world. Countries with the death penalty for trafficking still have drug problems. Deterrence fails against highly profitable criminal enterprises. | UNODC, 2024 |
