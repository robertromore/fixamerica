# Drug Policy: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

This chapter presents draft legislative text for comprehensive drug policy reform. The legislation addresses four major areas: (1) overall drug policy reform through a framework act, (2) drug scheduling modernization, (3) harm reduction access, and (4) sentencing reform and equity. Each proposal includes draft federal legislative text, explanatory notes, anticipated legal challenges, and analysis of potential loopholes and shortcomings. State model legislation is included where applicable.

The legislative approach recognizes that drug policy reform requires action across multiple fronts simultaneously. No single bill can address the full scope of needed reforms, but a coordinated package can achieve transformative change.

## Federal Legislation

### I. Comprehensive Drug Policy Reform Act

**Purpose**: Establish a public health framework for federal drug policy, rebalance the federal drug budget toward treatment and prevention, create accountability standards for opioid settlement funds, and authorize overdose prevention centers.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Comprehensive Drug Policy Reform Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) Drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in the
    United States, with over 107,000 deaths in 2023.
(2) Synthetic opioids, primarily illicit fentanyl, account for
    approximately 70 percent of all overdose deaths.
(3) Approximately 48,700,000 Americans aged 12 or older have a
    substance use disorder, yet only 24 percent receive any form of
    treatment.
(4) The Federal Government has spent in excess of $1,000,000,000,000
    on drug enforcement since 1971, yet drug use rates, addiction
    prevalence, and overdose deaths have all increased.
(5) Enforcement of drug laws has produced severe racial disparities:
    Black Americans are arrested for cannabis possession at 3.6 times
    the rate and incarcerated for drug offenses at 5.9 times the rate
    of white Americans, despite comparable rates of drug use.
(6) Evidence-based treatment, including medication-assisted treatment,
    reduces opioid overdose deaths by 50 to 75 percent.
(7) Countries that have adopted public health approaches to drug
    policy, including Portugal and Switzerland, have achieved
    dramatically lower rates of overdose death and drug-related harm.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:

(1) DEMAND REDUCTION.--The term "demand reduction" means activities
    related to substance use disorder treatment, prevention, harm
    reduction, and recovery support services.

    treatment" or "MAT" means the use of FDA-approved medications
    (including methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone), in
    combination with counseling and behavioral therapies, to treat
    substance use disorders.
(4) OVERDOSE PREVENTION CENTER.--The term "overdose prevention center"
    means a facility that provides a hygienic space for the
    consumption of pre-obtained substances under the supervision of
    trained staff, with the primary purpose of preventing overdose
    deaths and connecting individuals to health and social services.

    years after the date of enactment of this Act, not less than 65
    percent of the total Federal drug control budget shall be
    allocated to demand reduction activities.

(c) ONDCP CERTIFICATION.--The Director of the Office of National Drug
    Control Policy shall certify annually that the budget allocation
    requirements of this section have been met and shall report to
    Congress on the specific allocation of funds across treatment,
    prevention, harm reduction, and supply reduction categories.

SEC. 5. TREATMENT ON DEMAND.

(a) STANDARD OF ACCESS.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services
    shall establish, not later than 1 year after the date of
    enactment of this Act, a Federal standard requiring that any

    through 2030 to carry out this subsection.

SEC. 8. OPIOID SETTLEMENT FUND GOVERNANCE.

(a) ALLOCATION REQUIREMENTS.--Any State, territory, or political
    subdivision receiving funds from opioid-related litigation
    settlements shall allocate not less than 80 percent of such
    funds to--
    (1) substance use disorder treatment and recovery services;
    (2) harm reduction programs, including naloxone distribution and

SEC. 10. INSURANCE PARITY ENFORCEMENT.

(a) ANNUAL COMPLIANCE AUDITS.--The Secretary, acting through the
    Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, shall conduct annual
    audits of health plans subject to the Mental Health Parity and
    Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-343) to assess
    compliance with parity requirements for substance use disorder
    treatment.

(b) PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.--Any individual who has been denied
    coverage for substance use disorder treatment in violation of
    parity requirements may bring a civil action in Federal court
    for injunctive relief, compensatory damages, and reasonable
    attorney's fees.

(c) PENALTIES.--A health plan found to be in violation of parity

    programs and at least 20 percent directed to programs addressing
    adverse childhood experiences and social determinants of health.

SEC. 12. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect 180 days after the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**: This framework act establishes the foundation for a public health approach to drug policy. It rebalances federal spending, expands treatment access, authorizes harm reduction, governs opioid settlement funds, and invests in the addiction medicine workforce. The phased budget rebalancing (55% in 2 years, 65% in 5 years) allows time for demand reduction infrastructure to scale.

**Potential Challenges**:

- **Appropriations**: The total authorization ($19+ billion annually in new spending) faces budget constraints. Offset by cannabis tax revenue, incarceration savings, and healthcare savings.
- **State resistance to settlement fund governance**: States may resist federal oversight of settlement funds. The enforcement mechanism (withholding federal grants) provides leverage.
- **OPC opposition**: Overdose prevention center authorization will face strong opposition from law enforcement and conservative members. The opt-in design (state/local governments must request authorization) provides political cover.

**Refinements**:

- Include a 5-year sunset provision with mandatory congressional review and reauthorization.
- Create an independent inspector general for opioid settlement fund oversight.
- Include tribal government consultation requirements for all provisions.

### II. Drug Scheduling Modernization Act

**Purpose**: Transfer drug scheduling authority from the DEA to an independent scientific body, establish evidence-based scheduling criteria, and remove barriers to controlled substance research.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Drug Scheduling Modernization Act".

SEC. 2. INDEPENDENT DRUG SCHEDULING COMMISSION.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.--There is established an Independent Drug
    Scheduling Commission (hereinafter "the Commission").

(b) COMPOSITION.--The Commission shall consist of 11 members:
    (1) 3 members appointed by the President;
    (2) 2 members appointed by the Speaker of the House;
    (3) 2 members appointed by the Senate Majority Leader;
    (4) 2 members appointed by the minority leaders of the House and
        Senate (1 each); and
    (5) 2 members appointed by the National Academy of Sciences.

(c) QUALIFICATIONS.--Members shall have expertise in pharmacology,
    toxicology, addiction medicine, psychiatry, epidemiology, or
    public health. No member shall be a current employee of the Drug
    Enforcement Administration or any pharmaceutical company. No more
    than 6 members shall be of the same political party.

(d) TERMS.--Members shall serve for terms of 6 years, staggered so
    that no more than 4 members' terms expire in any 2-year period.

SEC. 3. TRANSFER OF SCHEDULING AUTHORITY.

(a) IN GENERAL.--Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment
    of this Act, the authority to schedule, reschedule, or deschedule
    controlled substances under the Controlled Substances Act
    (21 U.S.C. 811) shall be transferred from the Attorney General
    (acting through the Drug Enforcement Administration) to the
    Commission.

(b) ADVISORY ROLE OF DEA.--The Drug Enforcement Administration shall
    serve in an advisory capacity to the Commission on matters of
    enforcement feasibility but shall not have authority to approve
    or deny scheduling decisions.

(c) HHS ROLE PRESERVED.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services
    shall continue to provide scientific and medical evaluations to
    inform scheduling decisions, as provided under 21 U.S.C. 811(b).

SEC. 4. EVIDENCE-BASED SCHEDULING CRITERIA.

(a) The Commission shall evaluate all scheduling decisions based on
    the following evidence-based criteria:
    (1) PHARMACOLOGICAL HARM.--Acute toxicity, chronic toxicity, and
        lethality of the substance.
    (2) ADDICTION POTENTIAL.--Physical dependence potential,
        psychological dependence potential, and reinforcement
        magnitude.
    (3) SOCIAL HARM.--Crime, family disruption, economic costs, and
        community impact attributable to use of the substance.
    (4) THERAPEUTIC VALUE.--Accepted medical use, including
        conditions for which the substance has demonstrated efficacy
        in peer-reviewed research or FDA-approved applications.
    (5) COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS.--Comparison of the substance's harm
        profile with those of currently legal substances (alcohol,
        tobacco, caffeine) and other scheduled substances.

(b) MULTICRITERIA FRAMEWORK.--The Commission shall employ a
    multicriteria decision analysis framework, consistent with
    methodologies published in peer-reviewed scientific literature,
    for all scheduling decisions.

SEC. 5. MANDATORY REVIEW OF ALL SCHEDULED SUBSTANCES.

(a) The Commission shall conduct a comprehensive review of all
    substances currently listed in Schedules I through V within 3
    years of the transfer of authority described in Section 3.

(b) Thereafter, the Commission shall review each scheduled substance
    at least once every 5 years, incorporating new scientific
    evidence and real-world data.

(c) The Commission shall publish its findings and recommendations
    for each review in the Federal Register and provide a 90-day
    public comment period before any scheduling change takes effect.

SEC. 6. SCHEDULE I RESEARCH EXEMPTION.

(a) IN GENERAL.--Any researcher affiliated with an accredited
    institution of higher education, Federal research agency, or
    approved research organization may conduct research on any
    Schedule I substance upon registration with the Commission
    and approval of an Institutional Review Board, without
    additional DEA registration or licensing.

(b) SUPPLY.--The Commission shall ensure that adequate supplies of
    Schedule I substances are available for approved research,
    including by licensing multiple manufacturers as needed.

(c) TIMELINE.--Applications for Schedule I research registration
    shall be processed within 90 days of submission.

SEC. 7. CANNABIS-SPECIFIC PROVISIONS.

(a) RECLASSIFICATION.--Not later than 180 days after the effective
    date of this Act, the Commission shall complete a review of
    cannabis and its derivatives and issue a scheduling
    determination based on the criteria established in Section 4.

(b) Nothing in this section shall preclude Congress from enacting
    separate comprehensive cannabis legislation, including
    descheduling cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act
    entirely.

SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date of enactment, except that the
transfer of scheduling authority described in Section 3 shall take
effect 2 years after the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**: This act addresses the fundamental structural problem in drug scheduling: a law enforcement agency (the DEA) controls scientific decisions about drug classification. The independent commission model, modeled on the Federal Reserve and similar bodies, insulates scheduling from political pressure while ensuring expert-led, evidence-based classification. The mandatory review cycle prevents substances from remaining misclassified indefinitely.

**Potential Challenges**:

- **DEA resistance**: The DEA will aggressively oppose loss of scheduling authority. This is the strongest institutional opposition this legislation will face.
- **Appointments process**: Political appointments could be used to stack the Commission. The bipartisan requirement and NAS appointments provide safeguards.
- **Cannabis review timeline**: The 180-day cannabis review may be challenged as insufficient. However, the scientific evidence base for cannabis reclassification is extensive.

### III. Harm Reduction Access Act

**Purpose**: Establish a federal framework for harm reduction services, authorize and fund overdose prevention centers, expand syringe service programs, and ensure universal naloxone access.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Harm Reduction Access Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) Over 107,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2023.
(2) Naloxone, an opioid overdose reversal medication, has reversed
    an estimated 100,000 or more overdoses annually.
(3) Syringe service programs reduce HIV transmission by over 50
    percent and serve as effective entry points to treatment.
(4) Overdose prevention centers have operated in Canada, Australia,
    and Europe for decades without a single overdose death on-site.
(5) Fentanyl test strips enable people who use drugs to detect the
    presence of fentanyl in their supply, leading to behavior change
    that reduces overdose risk.

SEC. 3. FEDERAL HARM REDUCTION GRANT PROGRAM.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall
    establish a Federal Harm Reduction Grant Program to award grants
    to States, territories, tribal governments, units of local
    government, and nonprofit organizations for the establishment
    and operation of harm reduction services.

(b) ELIGIBLE ACTIVITIES.--Grant funds may be used for--
    (1) naloxone purchase and distribution;
    (2) syringe service program operation, including purchase of
        syringes and injection supplies;
    (3) fentanyl test strip distribution;
    (4) drug checking services using laboratory-grade equipment;
    (5) overdose prevention center operation;
    (6) wound care and basic medical services for people who use
        drugs;
    (7) peer outreach and navigation services;
    (8) training for harm reduction workers; and
    (9) data collection and program evaluation.

(c) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.--There is authorized to be
    appropriated $3,000,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2026
    through 2030 to carry out this section.

SEC. 4. OVERDOSE PREVENTION CENTER AUTHORIZATION.

(a) IN GENERAL.--No Federal law, including section 856 of title 21,
    United States Code (commonly known as the "crack house statute"),
    shall be construed to prohibit the operation of an overdose
    prevention center that is--
    (1) authorized by a State, territory, tribal government, or
        unit of local government; and
    (2) operated in compliance with the standards established under
        subsection (b).

(b) FEDERAL STANDARDS.--The Secretary shall establish standards for
    overdose prevention centers, including requirements for--
    (1) trained staff with the ability to administer naloxone and
        provide basic medical assessment;
    (2) immediate access to naloxone and other overdose reversal
        agents;
    (3) referral pathways to substance use disorder treatment,
        mental health services, housing, and other social services;
    (4) data collection and reporting on utilization, overdose
        reversals, treatment referrals, and other outcomes;
    (5) community engagement and input processes; and
    (6) compliance with applicable State and local public health
        requirements.

SEC. 5. SYRINGE SERVICE PROGRAM EXPANSION.

(a) LIFTING FEDERAL FUNDING RESTRICTIONS.--Section 505 of Public Law
    114-113 is repealed. Federal funds may be used for all aspects
    of syringe service program operation, including the purchase of
    syringes.

(b) GRANT PRIORITY.--The Secretary shall give priority to grant
    applications from jurisdictions with--
    (1) high rates of drug overdose deaths;
    (2) high rates of HIV or hepatitis C transmission associated
        with injection drug use; and
    (3) limited existing harm reduction infrastructure.

SEC. 6. UNIVERSAL NALOXONE ACCESS.

(a) BULK PURCHASE.--The Secretary shall negotiate and purchase
    naloxone in bulk quantities sufficient to ensure that naloxone
    is available at no cost to individuals through--
    (1) all pharmacies participating in Federal healthcare programs;
    (2) harm reduction organizations;
    (3) emergency departments;
    (4) community health centers;
    (5) schools and universities;
    (6) homeless shelters and transitional housing programs; and
    (7) correctional facilities (for distribution upon release).

(b) STANDING ORDER.--The Secretary shall issue a nationwide standing
    order for naloxone, allowing any individual to obtain naloxone
    without a prescription from any distribution point described in
    subsection (a).

SEC. 7. FENTANYL TEST STRIPS AND DRUG CHECKING.

(a) FEDERAL PARAPHERNALIA EXEMPTION.--Fentanyl test strips, drug
    checking reagents, and drug checking equipment shall not be
    considered drug paraphernalia under Federal law, including
    section 863 of title 21, United States Code.

(b) PREEMPTION.--The exemption described in subsection (a) shall
    preempt any State or local law that classifies fentanyl test
    strips or drug checking supplies as drug paraphernalia.

SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect 90 days after the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**: This act provides the federal legal framework for harm reduction services that have been shown to save lives. The most controversial provision -- overdose prevention center authorization -- is designed with an opt-in structure that requires state or local government authorization before a center can operate. The preemption of state paraphernalia laws for fentanyl test strips reflects the urgent public health need to make these tools universally available.

**Potential Challenges**:

- **Section 856 (crack house statute)**: The current law has been interpreted to potentially prohibit supervised consumption. Explicit exemption is essential.
- **State preemption for test strips**: Federal preemption of state paraphernalia laws may face federalism challenges, though the Commerce Clause and spending power provide strong bases.

### IV. Sentencing Reform and Equity Act

**Purpose**: Eliminate mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses, achieve 1:1 crack/powder cocaine sentencing parity, establish automatic expungement for cannabis convictions, and remove collateral consequences of drug convictions.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Sentencing Reform and Equity Act".

SEC. 2. ELIMINATION OF DRUG MANDATORY MINIMUMS.

(a) IN GENERAL.--Sections 401(b)(1) and 404 of the Controlled
    Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 841(b)(1), 844) are amended to
    eliminate all mandatory minimum terms of imprisonment for drug
    offenses.

(b) JUDICIAL DISCRETION.--Judges shall retain full discretion to
    impose sentences within the ranges established by the United
    States Sentencing Guidelines, taking into account the nature and
    circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of
    the defendant, and the need for the sentence imposed.

(c) RETROACTIVE APPLICATION.--Any person serving a Federal sentence
    that includes a mandatory minimum term for a drug offense may
    petition the court for resentencing under this section.

SEC. 3. CRACK/POWDER COCAINE SENTENCING PARITY.

(a) The quantities of cocaine base (crack) and powder cocaine that
    trigger penalties under section 401(b)(1) of the Controlled
    Substances Act shall be equalized at a 1:1 ratio.

(b) RETROACTIVE APPLICATION.--The amendment described in subsection
    (a) shall apply retroactively to all persons sentenced before
    the effective date of this Act. Any person serving a Federal
    sentence for an offense involving cocaine base may petition the
    court for resentencing.

SEC. 4. AUTOMATIC CANNABIS EXPUNGEMENT.

(a) FEDERAL CONVICTIONS.--Not later than 1 year after the date of
    enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall--
    (1) expunge all Federal convictions for simple possession of
        cannabis (21 U.S.C. 844) from all criminal records; and
    (2) vacate any outstanding warrants, probation terms, or
        supervised release conditions related to such convictions.

(b) RESENTENCING.--Any person currently serving a Federal sentence
    for an offense in which cannabis possession was the sole or
    primary charge shall be entitled to immediate resentencing.

(c) NOTIFICATION.--The Attorney General shall make reasonable efforts
    to notify all individuals whose records are expunged under this
    section.

SEC. 5. REMOVAL OF COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES.

(a) TANF AND SNAP ELIGIBILITY.--Section 115 of the Personal
    Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996
    (21 U.S.C. 862a) is repealed. No individual shall be
    disqualified from receiving benefits under the Temporary
    Assistance for Needy Families program or the Supplemental
    Nutrition Assistance Program solely on the basis of a drug
    conviction.

(b) FEDERAL HOUSING.--No individual shall be denied Federal housing
    assistance or admission to federally assisted housing solely
    on the basis of a drug conviction, unless the conviction
    involves the manufacture or distribution of methamphetamine on
    the premises of federally assisted housing.

(c) FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT.--No Federal agency shall inquire about an
    applicant's drug conviction history on an initial employment
    application. Drug conviction history may be considered only
    after a conditional offer of employment has been extended, and
    only to the extent that the conviction is directly relevant to
    the position.

(d) STUDENT AID.--Section 484(r) of the Higher Education Act of
    1965 (20 U.S.C. 1091(r)) is repealed. No student shall be
    disqualified from Federal student aid solely on the basis of a
    drug conviction.

(e) VOTING RIGHTS.--No State shall deny or abridge the right to
    vote of any citizen of the United States on the basis of a drug
    conviction. This subsection shall apply to all Federal, State,
    and local elections.

SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect 180 days after the date of enactment,
except that the expungement provisions of Section 4 shall take
effect 1 year after the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**: This act addresses the criminal justice failures of drug policy by eliminating mandatory minimums, completing crack/powder parity, automatically expunging cannabis convictions, and removing the collateral consequences that prevent people with drug convictions from rebuilding their lives. Retroactive application is essential for equity -- thousands of people are serving sentences under laws that are now recognized as unjust.

**Potential Challenges**:

- **Voting rights provision**: Section 5(e) may require a constitutional amendment (echoing the 15th Amendment's structure) or rely on congressional enforcement power under the 14th Amendment. Standalone voting rights restoration legislation is an alternative pathway.
- **Mandatory minimum elimination**: Will face strong opposition from prosecutors and some law enforcement organizations.
- **Retroactive resentencing**: Will require significant judicial resources for petition processing.

    be subject to arrest, prosecution, or penalty for possession
    of a controlled substance or drug paraphernalia discovered as
    a result of seeking such assistance.

(b) The protections described in subsection (a) shall extend to the
    person experiencing the overdose.

(c) This section shall not provide immunity for offenses involving
    the manufacture, distribution, or trafficking of controlled
    substances.

SECTION 4. APPROPRIATIONS.

There is appropriated from the [State fund] the sum of
$[amount] for fiscal year [year] for the implementation of
this Act.
```

**Adaptations**: States may adjust the scope of authorized services, appropriation levels, and governance structures. States with existing syringe service programs may focus on adding overdose prevention center authorization and drug checking services.

## Regulatory Framework

### Methadone Dispensing Reform

**Existing Authority**: 42 C.F.R. Part 8 (SAMHSA regulations for opioid treatment programs); 21 C.F.R. Sections 1301-1321 (DEA regulations for controlled substances).

**Proposed Regulatory Changes**:

1. **Pharmacy dispensing**: Amend 42 C.F.R. Part 8 to authorize certified pharmacies to dispense methadone for opioid use disorder, subject to pharmacist training requirements and patient monitoring protocols.
2. **Take-home dose liberalization**: Amend 42 C.F.R. Section 8.12 to allow all clinically stable patients (defined as 90+ days of treatment without illicit drug use) to receive 28-day take-home supplies.
3. **Telehealth integration**: Allow initial methadone treatment assessments via telehealth, with in-person evaluation required within 30 days.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

- **Commerce Clause**: Federal drug policy authority rests on the Commerce Clause, as affirmed in *Gonzales v. Raich* (2005). The proposed legislation operates within established constitutional authority.
- **Spending Power**: Federal grant conditions (opioid settlement fund governance, evidence-based prevention requirements) rely on the spending power, subject to the limitations established in *NFIB v. Sebelius* (2012) (conditions must not be coercive).
- **Voting Rights**: Section 5(e) of the Sentencing Reform and Equity Act may face challenges under the political question doctrine or federalism principles. Congressional authority under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment provides the strongest constitutional basis.
- **Preemption**: The Harm Reduction Access Act's preemption of state paraphernalia laws for fentanyl test strips is supportable under the Supremacy Clause and the Commerce Clause.

### Preemption Questions

- The proposed legislation does not generally preempt state drug laws, which operate under the state police power. States remain free to maintain stricter or more lenient drug policies.
- The exception is fentanyl test strip preemption (Harm Reduction Access Act, Section 7(b)), which is narrowly targeted and justified by urgent public health need.
- Cannabis descheduling (if pursued through separate legislation) would eliminate the federal-state conflict but would not require states to legalize cannabis.

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- **Budget rebalancing**: ONDCP certification requirement creates annual accountability. Congressional appropriations committees serve as enforcement backstop.
- **Treatment access**: Grant conditions tied to the 48-hour access standard. Noncompliant jurisdictions lose SAMHSA funding.
- **Settlement fund governance**: Federal grant withholding for noncompliant states. Inspector general oversight.
- **Insurance parity**: Private right of action with attorney's fees provides individual enforcement mechanism. CMS audits provide systematic oversight.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- 5-year sunset clause on major appropriations authorizations with mandatory reauthorization.
- GAO evaluation mandate at 3-year and 5-year marks for each major program.
- Annual ONDCP reporting on all outcome metrics.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Comprehensive Drug Policy Reform Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Budget accounting manipulation | ONDCP could reclassify enforcement spending as "demand reduction" to meet the 55/65% threshold | High |
| Treatment quality standards | The Act mandates treatment access but does not establish quality standards, risking expansion of low-quality programs | Medium |
| Settlement fund diversion | States could create nominally compliant programs that effectively divert funds to non-treatment purposes | High |
| OPC regulatory delay | HHS could delay establishing OPC standards, effectively blocking implementation | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| No personal possession decriminalization | Individuals continue to face criminal penalties for drug use | Political feasibility constraint |
| Appropriations dependency | Authorized funding levels are not guaranteed | Congressional appropriations process |
| State opt-out | States can decline to participate in treatment expansion or harm reduction | Federalism |
| Limited pharmaceutical accountability | Does not address pharmaceutical marketing reform or executive criminal liability directly | Scope limitation |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Budget accounting**: Require GAO audit of ONDCP demand reduction classifications annually. Define demand reduction categories explicitly in legislative text to prevent reclassification.
2. **Treatment quality**: Require SAMHSA to establish minimum treatment quality standards (evidence-based practices, outcome measurement, staffing ratios) as a condition of federal funding within 2 years.
3. **Settlement fund governance**: Establish an independent inspector general with audit authority over settlement fund expenditures. Publish annual transparency reports.
4. **OPC standards**: Impose a statutory deadline (12 months) for HHS to promulgate OPC standards. Include a default standard that takes effect if HHS misses the deadline.

### Drug Scheduling Modernization Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Commission capture | Appointees could be selected for political rather than scientific credentials | Medium |
| Delayed implementation | The 2-year transfer timeline could be extended through administrative delays | Medium |
| Industry influence | Pharmaceutical companies could lobby Commission members to schedule competitors or delay rescheduling | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Does not address cannabis specifically beyond requiring review | Cannabis rescheduling depends on Commission action, not guaranteed | Separation of powers design |
| DEA retains enforcement authority | DEA may use enforcement discretion to undermine scheduling changes | Institutional resistance |
| No international treaty reform | U.S. treaty obligations under the 1961 Single Convention may conflict with descheduling | International law constraints |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Commission composition**: Strengthen conflict-of-interest provisions. Require public financial disclosure. Prohibit appointees who have received pharmaceutical industry compensation within 5 years.
2. **Implementation timeline**: Include penalties for missed deadlines. Authorize congressional subpoena of Commission progress reports.
3. **Cannabis**: Consider separate cannabis legislation (descheduling) that does not depend on Commission action.

### Sentencing Reform and Equity Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| State mandatory minimums unaffected | Federal reform does not apply to state drug sentencing | High |
| Prosecutorial charging workaround | Prosecutors may increase use of non-drug charges (conspiracy, RICO) to maintain long sentences | Medium |
| Expungement implementation delays | DOJ could slow-walk the expungement process | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Does not address state-level sentencing | Most drug incarceration is at the state level | Federal jurisdiction limitation |
| Voting rights provision may be constitutionally challenged | Unclear congressional authority to mandate state restoration of voting rights for state offenses | Constitutional ambiguity |
| No compensation for unjust incarceration | People who served mandatory minimum sentences under now-reformed laws receive no restitution | Political feasibility |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **State model legislation**: Include model state sentencing reform legislation for state adoption. Condition federal criminal justice grants on state adoption of sentencing guidelines consistent with federal reform.
2. **Prosecutorial workarounds**: Monitor federal charging patterns post-reform. Require DOJ reporting on use of non-drug charges in cases involving drug conduct.
3. **Expungement timeline**: Impose statutory deadlines for expungement processing. Authorize private right of action if DOJ fails to process expungement within 1 year.

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| Funding sustainability beyond authorization period | Build sunset reviews with mandatory reauthorization votes; tie funding to dedicated revenue sources (cannabis tax) |
| State resistance to reform | Use incentive-based rather than mandate-based approaches; preserve state flexibility within federal frameworks |
| Workforce pipeline | Begin training program funding immediately; expand residency slots before treatment expansion mandates take effect |
| Data and evaluation infrastructure | Invest in SAMHSA data capacity; require program-level outcome reporting; fund independent evaluation |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

All provisions of the proposed legislation should include:

1. **5-year sunset clause**: Major provisions expire after 5 years unless reauthorized by Congress.
2. **GAO evaluation mandate**: GAO shall conduct comprehensive evaluations of each major program at the 3-year and 5-year marks.
3. **Outcome-based metrics**: Each program must establish measurable outcome targets (overdose death reduction, treatment access, racial disparity reduction) within 1 year and report progress annually.
4. **Public reporting**: All program data and evaluation findings shall be published on a public dashboard maintained by ONDCP.
