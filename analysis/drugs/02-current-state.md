# Drug Policy: Current State

## Overview

The current state of U.S. drug policy is defined by a convergence of crises: record overdose deaths driven by illicit fentanyl, a vast treatment gap affecting tens of millions of Americans, an evolving patchwork of state cannabis legalization in direct conflict with federal law, and persistent racial disparities in drug enforcement. Federal policy remains anchored in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, even as the drug landscape has been transformed by synthetic opioids, psychedelic medicine research, and shifting public attitudes. This chapter presents the key data, trends, and frameworks that define the current moment.

## The Overdose Crisis

Drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in the United States. The crisis has evolved through distinct waves, each driven by different substances.

### Overdose Deaths by Year and Substance Category

| Year | Total Overdose Deaths | Synthetic Opioids (Fentanyl) | Other Opioids (Heroin, Rx) | Psychostimulants (Meth) | Cocaine | Source |
|------|----------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|---------|--------|
| 2010 | 38,329 | 3,007 | 21,089 | 1,854 | 4,183 | CDC WONDER |
| 2015 | 52,404 | 9,580 | 27,056 | 5,716 | 6,784 | CDC WONDER |
| 2017 | 70,237 | 28,466 | 17,029 | 10,333 | 13,942 | CDC WONDER |
| 2019 | 70,630 | 36,359 | 14,019 | 16,167 | 15,883 | CDC WONDER |
| 2020 | 91,799 | 56,516 | 13,165 | 23,837 | 19,447 | CDC WONDER |
| 2021 | 106,699 | 70,601 | 9,173 | 32,537 | 24,486 | CDC WONDER |
| 2022 | 109,680 | 73,838 | 8,529 | 34,022 | 27,569 | CDC WONDER |
| 2023 | 107,543 | ~75,000 | ~7,800 | ~34,000 | ~28,000 | CDC WONDER (provisional) |

**Key trends:**

- Synthetic opioids (primarily illicit fentanyl) now account for approximately 70% of all overdose deaths.
- Polysubstance use is increasingly common: fentanyl is frequently found in combination with methamphetamine and cocaine, meaning stimulant-involved deaths are also driven by the fentanyl supply.
- The slight decline from 2022 to 2023 (~2%) represents the first year-over-year decrease since 2018, but the total remains historically catastrophic.
- Overdose deaths have increased approximately 180% since 2010.

### Geographic Variation

Overdose death rates vary significantly by state and region.

| State/Region | Overdose Death Rate (per 100,000, 2023) | Primary Driver | Source |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|----------------|--------|
| West Virginia | 81.4 | Fentanyl | CDC WONDER |
| Tennessee | 56.2 | Fentanyl | CDC WONDER |
| Louisiana | 55.9 | Fentanyl | CDC WONDER |
| Ohio | 47.2 | Fentanyl | CDC WONDER |
| Kentucky | 45.8 | Fentanyl | CDC WONDER |
| National Average | 32.4 | Fentanyl | CDC WONDER |
| California | 25.1 | Fentanyl/Meth | CDC WONDER |
| Texas | 17.3 | Fentanyl/Meth | CDC WONDER |
| Nebraska | 10.8 | Meth/Fentanyl | CDC WONDER |
| South Dakota | 9.2 | Meth | CDC WONDER |

The Appalachian region and the Southeast have been hit hardest by fentanyl, while the West and Upper Midwest see higher proportions of methamphetamine involvement. Urban areas have higher absolute numbers, but rural areas often have higher per-capita rates and less access to treatment and harm reduction services.

### Demographic Disparities in Overdose Deaths

| Demographic Group | Overdose Death Rate (per 100,000, 2022) | Trend (2019-2022) | Source |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------|--------|
| American Indian/Alaska Native | 56.6 | +62% | CDC MMWR |
| Black/African American | 38.4 | +44% | CDC MMWR |
| White | 36.8 | +35% | CDC MMWR |
| Hispanic/Latino | 24.4 | +56% | CDC MMWR |
| Asian/Pacific Islander | 5.8 | +51% | CDC MMWR |
| Males (all races) | 44.3 | +39% | CDC WONDER |
| Females (all races) | 19.8 | +32% | CDC WONDER |
| Ages 25-34 | 51.7 | +40% | CDC WONDER |
| Ages 35-44 | 55.2 | +45% | CDC WONDER |

American Indian/Alaska Native populations have the highest per-capita overdose death rate of any racial/ethnic group, a crisis that receives disproportionately little attention. Black Americans have experienced the fastest growth in overdose deaths in recent years, driven by fentanyl contamination of the cocaine and illicit drug supply.

## Substance Use and Addiction

### Substance Use Disorder Prevalence

The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) conducts the annual National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), the primary source for national prevalence data.

| Metric | Estimate (2023) | Source |
|--------|-----------------|--------|
| Any substance use disorder (age 12+) | 48.7 million (17.3%) | SAMHSA NSDUH |
| Alcohol use disorder | 29.5 million (10.5%) | SAMHSA NSDUH |
| Illicit drug use disorder | 27.2 million (9.7%) | SAMHSA NSDUH |
| Opioid use disorder | 6.1 million (2.2%) | SAMHSA NSDUH |
| Cannabis use disorder | 16.3 million (5.8%) | SAMHSA NSDUH |
| Stimulant use disorder (meth/cocaine) | 4.8 million (1.7%) | SAMHSA NSDUH |
| Co-occurring SUD + mental illness | 21.5 million | SAMHSA NSDUH |

### The Treatment Gap

Despite the scale of addiction, the treatment system reaches only a fraction of those who need help.

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| People with SUD who received treatment (2023) | ~11.7 million (24%) | SAMHSA NSDUH |
| People with SUD who did not receive treatment | ~37 million (76%) | SAMHSA NSDUH |
| People with opioid use disorder receiving MAT | ~1.8 million (30%) | SAMHSA |
| Specialty SUD treatment facilities | ~16,000 | SAMHSA N-SSATS |
| Treatment facilities offering MAT (buprenorphine) | ~42% | SAMHSA N-SSATS |
| Treatment facilities offering methadone | ~12% | SAMHSA N-SSATS |
| Average wait time for publicly funded treatment | 25-30 days | NIDA |

The barriers to treatment are numerous: cost and insurance coverage gaps, geographic scarcity (especially in rural areas), workforce shortages (the U.S. has approximately 32,000 addiction medicine specialists for 48.7 million people with SUDs), stigma, and regulatory barriers. Only 42% of specialty treatment facilities offer buprenorphine, the gold-standard medication for opioid use disorder, and only 12% offer methadone.

## Drug Use Trends

### Past-Year Drug Use, Population Aged 12+ (2023)

| Substance | Users (millions) | Prevalence | Trend (5-year) | Source |
|-----------|-----------------|------------|----------------|--------|
| Alcohol | 174.6 | 62.0% | Stable | SAMHSA NSDUH |
| Cannabis | 61.9 | 22.0% | Up (+35%) | SAMHSA NSDUH |
| Prescription pain relievers (misuse) | 8.5 | 3.0% | Down (-25%) | SAMHSA NSDUH |
| Hallucinogens | 8.1 | 2.9% | Up (+50%) | SAMHSA NSDUH |
| Cocaine | 5.7 | 2.0% | Stable | SAMHSA NSDUH |
| Prescription stimulants (misuse) | 4.5 | 1.6% | Down (-10%) | SAMHSA NSDUH |
| Methamphetamine | 2.7 | 1.0% | Stable | SAMHSA NSDUH |
| Heroin | 0.9 | 0.3% | Down (-40%) | SAMHSA NSDUH |
| Prescription sedatives (misuse) | 3.4 | 1.2% | Down (-15%) | SAMHSA NSDUH |

Notable trends include the significant increase in cannabis use (consistent with state legalization), the rise in hallucinogen use (driven by psychedelic interest and microdosing), and the decline in prescription opioid misuse (reflecting tighter prescribing) even as illicit opioid deaths have skyrocketed.

## Criminal Justice and Enforcement

### Drug Arrests and Incarceration

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Total drug arrests (2022) | ~1.5 million | FBI UCR |
| Drug possession arrests | ~1.2 million (80%) | FBI UCR |
| Drug sale/manufacturing arrests | ~300,000 (20%) | FBI UCR |
| Cannabis possession arrests | ~350,000 (23% of total) | FBI UCR |
| Federal prisoners with drug offense | ~66,000 (45% of BOP) | Bureau of Prisons |
| State prisoners with drug offense | ~143,000 (14% of state) | Bureau of Justice Statistics |
| Average federal drug sentence (2022) | 74 months | U.S. Sentencing Commission |
| Drug mandatory minimum sentences imposed (2022) | ~6,700 (26% of drug cases) | U.S. Sentencing Commission |

### Racial Disparities in Drug Enforcement

| Metric | Black Americans | White Americans | Ratio | Source |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|-------|--------|
| Cannabis arrest rate (per 100,000) | 567 | 156 | 3.6:1 | ACLU, 2020 |
| Drug incarceration rate (per 100,000) | 334 | 57 | 5.9:1 | The Sentencing Project |
| Average federal drug sentence | 78 months | 66 months | 1.2:1 | USSC |
| Mandatory minimum application rate | 35% | 24% | 1.5:1 | USSC |

Despite roughly equal rates of drug use across racial groups (according to NSDUH data), Black Americans are arrested for cannabis at 3.6 times the rate and incarcerated for drug offenses at 5.9 times the rate of white Americans. These disparities reflect enforcement patterns -- not drug use patterns -- including the concentration of policing in Black neighborhoods, racial profiling in traffic stops, and prosecutorial charging decisions.

## Cannabis Legalization Status

### State Cannabis Laws (as of 2024)

| Category | Number of States | Notes |
|----------|-----------------|-------|
| Recreational legalization | 24 + D.C. | Plus Guam, CNMI, USVI |
| Medical only | 14 | Various qualifying conditions |
| CBD/Low-THC only | 5 | Limited programs |
| Fully illegal | 7 | Idaho, Wyoming, Kansas, Wisconsin, Indiana, South Carolina, Nebraska |
| Decriminalized (no legalization) | 4 | Additional states with civil penalties only |

### Cannabis Market Data

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Legal cannabis market revenue (2023) | ~$33.6 billion | MJBizDaily |
| Cannabis tax revenue to states (2023) | ~$4.2 billion | Tax Foundation |
| Licensed cannabis businesses | ~20,000+ | State data |
| Cannabis industry jobs | ~440,000 | Leafly Jobs Report |
| Adults who report past-year cannabis use | 61.9 million (22%) | SAMHSA NSDUH |
| Public support for legalization | 70% | Gallup, 2023 |

The legal cannabis industry employs approximately 440,000 people -- more than the coal mining, steel manufacturing, or brewing industries. Yet federal prohibition creates pervasive problems: cannabis businesses cannot access FDIC-insured banking, cannot deduct ordinary business expenses on federal taxes (Section 280E), cannot patent innovations or enforce contracts in federal court, and cannot transport product across state lines.

## Federal Drug Policy Framework

### The Controlled Substances Act: Drug Schedules

| Schedule | Definition | Examples | Research Access |
|----------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| I | High abuse potential, no accepted medical use, not safe for use under medical supervision | Heroin, cannabis, LSD, MDMA, psilocybin | Requires DEA Schedule I research license; severe restrictions |
| II | High abuse potential, accepted medical use, severe dependence potential | Fentanyl, oxycodone, cocaine, methamphetamine, Adderall | Standard DEA research registration |
| III | Moderate abuse potential, accepted medical use, moderate dependence | Ketamine, testosterone, buprenorphine | Standard DEA registration |
| IV | Low abuse potential, accepted medical use, limited dependence | Benzodiazepines (Xanax, Valium), Ambien, tramadol | Standard DEA registration |
| V | Lowest abuse potential, accepted medical use, limited dependence | Cough preparations with codeine, pregabalin | Standard DEA registration |

The scheduling system is widely criticized as scientifically indefensible. Cannabis (Schedule I: "no accepted medical use") is classified as more dangerous than fentanyl (Schedule II) and cocaine (Schedule II). The DEA has approved only one rescheduling in 53 years (hydrocodone combination products from III to II in 2014). The HHS recommended rescheduling cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III in 2023, and the DEA initiated rulemaking in 2024, but the process remains incomplete.

### Federal Drug Control Budget (FY2025)

| Category | Amount (billions) | % of Total | Source |
|----------|------------------|------------|--------|
| **Demand Reduction** | **$19.8** | **43%** | ONDCP |
| - Treatment | $13.2 | 29% | ONDCP |
| - Prevention | $4.8 | 10% | ONDCP |
| - Harm Reduction | $1.8 | 4% | ONDCP |
| **Supply Reduction** | **$26.3** | **57%** | ONDCP |
| - Domestic Law Enforcement | $11.2 | 24% | ONDCP |
| - Interdiction | $8.4 | 18% | ONDCP |
| - International | $6.7 | 15% | ONDCP |
| **Total** | **$46.1** | **100%** | ONDCP |

The supply/demand split has improved from its historical pattern (in the 1990s, supply reduction received over 65% of the budget), but enforcement still consumes the majority of federal drug spending. Treatment funding remains inadequate relative to the scale of need -- $13.2 billion for 48.7 million people with substance use disorders amounts to approximately $271 per person with an SUD, while the average cost of residential treatment is $35,000-$70,000 per episode.

### Key Federal Agencies

| Agency | Role | Annual Budget | Employees |
|--------|------|---------------|-----------|
| DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) | Drug enforcement, scheduling, regulation | ~$3.5 billion | ~10,000 |
| ONDCP (Office of National Drug Control Policy) | Policy coordination, strategy | ~$400 million | ~55 |
| SAMHSA (Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration) | Treatment and prevention grants | ~$8.2 billion | ~550 |
| NIDA (National Institute on Drug Abuse) | Research | ~$1.7 billion | ~370 |
| FDA (Food and Drug Administration, Center for Drug Evaluation) | Drug approval, pharmaceutical regulation | ~$6.9 billion (total FDA) | ~18,000 (total FDA) |

## Harm Reduction Infrastructure

### Current Harm Reduction Programs

| Program Type | Estimated Number | Coverage | Source |
|--------------|-----------------|----------|--------|
| Syringe service programs (SSPs) | ~430 | 48 states + D.C. | NASEN |
| Naloxone distribution programs | ~850+ | All 50 states | CDC |
| Drug checking services (fentanyl test strips) | ~200+ | ~35 states legal | NDEWS |
| Overdose prevention centers (supervised consumption) | 2 | New York City only | OnPoint NYC |
| Good Samaritan laws | 48 states + D.C. | Nearly universal | NCSL |

The United States has significantly expanded harm reduction infrastructure in recent years, but coverage remains far below need. Syringe service programs operate in most states but reach only an estimated 20-30% of people who inject drugs. Naloxone (Narcan) was approved for over-the-counter sale in 2023, but cost ($45/kit retail) remains a barrier. Only two supervised consumption sites operate in the entire country (both in New York City), compared to over 200 worldwide.

## Pharmaceutical Industry and the Opioid Crisis

### Opioid Litigation Settlements (Major)

| Defendant | Settlement Amount | Year | Status |
|-----------|------------------|------|--------|
| Purdue Pharma / Sackler Family | $6 billion (bankruptcy) | 2024 | Supreme Court rejected initial plan; revised settlement approved |
| Johnson & Johnson | $5 billion | 2022 | Settling with states |
| McKesson, Cardinal Health, AmerisourceBergen (distributors) | $21 billion | 2022 | Settling with states and subdivisions |
| Walmart | $3.1 billion | 2022 | Settling with states |
| Walgreens | $5.7 billion | 2022-2023 | Settling with states |
| CVS | $5 billion | 2022 | Settling with states |
| Teva Pharmaceutical | $4.25 billion | 2023 | Settling with states |
| Allergan | $2.37 billion | 2023 | Settling with states |

Total opioid-related settlements now exceed $50 billion, making this the largest pharmaceutical litigation in history. However, settlement funds are disbursed over many years, and there are significant concerns about whether states are spending the funds on addiction treatment and prevention or diverting them to general budgets.

## International Comparisons

### Drug Policy Approaches by Country

| Country | Approach | Key Features | Overdose Death Rate (per 100,000) |
|---------|----------|--------------|-----------------------------------|
| United States | Prohibition-dominant | War on Drugs, high incarceration, fragmented treatment | 32.4 |
| Portugal | Decriminalization (2001) | Personal possession decriminalized; treatment expanded; dissuasion commissions | 0.4 |
| Switzerland | Four-pillar model | Prevention, treatment (including heroin-assisted), harm reduction, enforcement | 3.1 |
| Netherlands | De facto legalization (cannabis) | Coffeeshops, pragmatic tolerance, health-focused | 2.5 |
| Canada | Legalization (cannabis) + harm reduction | Federal cannabis legalization (2018), supervised consumption sites, safe supply programs | 13.8 |
| Australia | Harm reduction emphasis | Supervised injection room (Sydney), needle exchange, naloxone | 5.4 |
| Czech Republic | Decriminalization | Personal quantities decriminalized, health-focused approach | 0.5 |

The United States has a drug overdose death rate that is 80 times higher than Portugal's -- a country that decriminalized personal drug possession in 2001 and invested heavily in treatment and harm reduction. While direct comparison is complicated by differences in drug markets (fentanyl is far less prevalent in Europe), the contrast underscores the failure of the American prohibitionist approach.

## Public Opinion

### Attitudes Toward Drug Policy (2023-2024)

| Issue | Support | Oppose | Source |
|-------|---------|--------|--------|
| Legalizing cannabis | 70% | 28% | Gallup, 2023 |
| Treating drug addiction as a health issue vs. crime | 64% | 31% | Pew Research, 2024 |
| Making naloxone widely available | 79% | 15% | KFF, 2023 |
| Reducing mandatory minimums for drug offenses | 61% | 32% | Pew Research, 2023 |
| Supervised injection sites | 38% | 53% | Gallup, 2023 |
| Decriminalizing personal drug possession | 43% | 49% | Pew Research, 2024 |
| Holding pharmaceutical companies accountable | 87% | 9% | KFF, 2023 |

Public opinion has shifted dramatically in favor of cannabis legalization (from 25% support in 1995 to 70% in 2023) and toward treating addiction as a health issue. Support for harm reduction measures like naloxone is strong, but more controversial approaches like supervised injection sites and full decriminalization face majority opposition, reflecting the ongoing tension between public health evidence and cultural attitudes about drug use.

## Summary Assessment

The current state of U.S. drug policy is characterized by:

1. **A catastrophic overdose crisis** that kills over 100,000 Americans annually, driven by illicit fentanyl, with no adequate national response.
2. **A massive treatment gap** where three out of four Americans with substance use disorders receive no treatment at all.
3. **A federal-state policy collision** on cannabis that undermines the rule of law and creates economic distortions.
4. **Persistent racial disparities** in drug enforcement that cannot be explained by differences in drug use.
5. **An outdated regulatory framework** (the Controlled Substances Act) that classifies drugs based on politics rather than science.
6. **Insufficient harm reduction infrastructure**, with the U.S. far behind peer nations in implementing evidence-based programs to prevent death and disease.
7. **Incomplete pharmaceutical accountability**, with settlement funds flowing but governance of those funds weak.
8. **Shifting but still conflicted public attitudes**, with broad support for cannabis legalization and treatment-first approaches but unease about decriminalization and supervised consumption.
