# Drug Policy: Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap presents a phased approach to comprehensive drug policy reform, sequencing reforms from those with the highest political feasibility and most immediate impact to those requiring more time and political capital. The roadmap is designed to produce measurable results in the short term while building toward systemic transformation over a decade.

## Dependencies

### Critical Path Items

1. **Harm reduction expansion must precede decriminalization**: Oregon's experience demonstrates that decriminalization without treatment infrastructure fails. Phase 1 investments in naloxone, SSPs, and treatment must be operational before Phase 3 decriminalization.
2. **Cannabis legalization should precede broader scheduling reform**: The political momentum from cannabis legalization creates the foundation for comprehensive scheduling reform. Success in cannabis regulation demonstrates that the government can manage drug markets without prohibition.
3. **Treatment workforce must scale alongside treatment access expansion**: Expanding treatment entitlements without expanding the workforce creates wait times and poor quality. The Addiction Medicine Corps must be funded simultaneously with treatment expansion.
4. **Pharmaceutical accountability must precede settlement fund governance**: Settlement funds are flowing now; governance structures must be established quickly to prevent diversion. This is time-sensitive.
5. **Federal authorization of OPCs should follow successful pilot data**: The New York City pilot will generate essential data by Year 3. Using this data for federal authorization increases political feasibility.

### Enabling Conditions

- **Bipartisan political leadership**: Drug policy reform requires champions in both parties. The First Step Act model (bipartisan sponsorship, White House support) should be replicated.
- **State-level experimentation**: States should continue to serve as laboratories for innovation (cannabis regulation models, harm reduction approaches, treatment delivery systems).
- **Public education**: Sustained public education campaigns are needed to shift cultural attitudes about addiction, harm reduction, and drug policy from moral frameworks to health frameworks.
- **Data infrastructure**: Improved data systems are needed to track reform outcomes in real time. Investment in SAMHSA's data collection capacity, CDC overdose surveillance, and state-level data systems is essential.

## Resource Summary

### Total Investment by Phase

| Phase | Timeline | New Federal Investment | Revenue/Savings Offset | Net Cost |
|-------|----------|----------------------|----------------------|----------|
| Phase 1 | Years 1-2 | ~$5.85 billion/year | $2-3 billion (early savings) | ~$3-4 billion/year |
| Phase 2 | Years 2-5 | ~$25-35 billion/year | $15-25 billion | ~$10-15 billion/year |
| Phase 3 | Years 5-10 | ~$30-40 billion/year | $25-35 billion | ~$5-10 billion/year |

At full implementation, the net federal cost of comprehensive drug policy reform is approximately $5-10 billion annually above current spending -- while saving an estimated 50,000+ lives per year and generating $30+ billion in economic benefits through reduced healthcare costs, increased productivity, and reduced criminal justice spending.
