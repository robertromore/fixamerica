# Drug Testing: History

## Historical Development

Drug testing in the United States has evolved from a narrow military application in the 1970s to a vast, multi-billion-dollar system that permeates employment, welfare, education, and criminal justice. Its expansion has been driven less by scientific evidence of effectiveness than by political imperatives, moral panics, catastrophic accidents, and the commercial interests of a growing testing industry. Understanding this history is essential to evaluating whether the current system serves its stated goals.

### Origins: Military Drug Testing (1960s-1970s): From Vietnam to the Pentagon

- **Vietnam War and Heroin Use**: The modern era of drug testing began with the U.S. military's response to widespread heroin use among soldiers in Vietnam. In 1971, the military implemented Operation Golden Flow, which required all service members to test negative for opiates before returning to the United States. Approximately 5% of returning soldiers tested positive.
- **Nixon's War on Drugs**: President Richard Nixon declared drug abuse "public enemy number one" in June 1971 and signed the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act (1970), which established the drug scheduling system. Nixon's drug policy was explicitly political: aide John Ehrlichman later acknowledged that the administration's drug policy targeted "the antiwar left and black people."
- **Early Technology**: Testing in this era relied on thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and early immunoassay techniques. The technology was rudimentary, with high false positive rates and limited substance coverage.
- **Military Expansion**: Following initial heroin screening, the Department of Defense expanded its testing program in the late 1970s to include cannabis, cocaine, and amphetamines, eventually creating the largest drug testing program in the world.

### The Reagan Era (1981-1989): Drug-Free America and the Workplace Testing Explosion

- **Executive Order 12564 (1986)**: Following the crash of a Navy jet on the USS *Nimitz* in 1981 -- in which autopsies revealed marijuana metabolites in several deceased crew members -- and the derailment of a Conrail train in Chase, Maryland in 1987 (linked to cannabis and PCP use by the engineer), President Reagan signed Executive Order 12564, declaring the federal government a "Drug-Free Workplace" and authorizing testing of federal employees in "sensitive positions."
- **Drug-Free Workplace Act (1988)**: Congress enacted the Drug-Free Workplace Act, requiring all federal contractors and grantees to certify drug-free workplace policies. While the Act did not mandate testing, it created powerful incentives for employers to adopt testing programs.
- **SAMHSA Guidelines (1988)**: The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA, originally NIDA) published Mandatory Guidelines for Federal Workplace Drug Testing Programs, establishing the technical standards (cutoff levels, confirmation requirements, chain of custody protocols) that remain the foundation of the system.
- **Corporate Adoption Surge**: Private-sector employers rapidly adopted drug testing after 1986. The American Management Association reported that the percentage of large companies testing employees rose from 18% in 1987 to 48% in 1990.
- **"Just Say No" and Moral Panic**: First Lady Nancy Reagan's "Just Say No" campaign and the media-fueled crack cocaine panic created intense public pressure for visible anti-drug measures. Drug testing served a symbolic function -- demonstrating institutional commitment to a drug-free environment -- regardless of its empirical effectiveness.

### The DOT Era (1989-2000): Mandated Testing for Safety-Sensitive Workers

- **Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act (1991)**: Following the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989 (in which the ship's captain had a history of alcohol problems) and a series of transportation accidents, Congress passed the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act, mandating pre-employment, random, post-accident, reasonable suspicion, and return-to-duty testing for all transportation workers under DOT jurisdiction.
- **49 CFR Part 40**: The DOT codified comprehensive testing procedures, including the Substance Abuse Professional (SAP) evaluation process, Medical Review Officer (MRO) review of results, and split specimen procedures.
- **Testing Industry Growth**: The mandated testing market created a multi-billion-dollar industry of certified laboratories, collection sites, MROs, SAPs, and testing technology companies. The number of SAMHSA-certified laboratories grew from fewer than 30 in 1988 to over 80 by 2000.
- **Supreme Court Cases**: The Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of drug testing in several landmark cases:
    - ***Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Association***, 489 U.S. 602 (1989): Upheld post-accident drug testing of railroad employees as a "special needs" exception to the Fourth Amendment's warrant requirement.
    - ***National Treasury Employees Union v. Von Raab***, 489 U.S. 656 (1989): Upheld suspicionless testing of U.S. Customs employees seeking transfer to positions involving drug interdiction or carrying firearms.
    - ***Chandler v. Miller***, 520 U.S. 305 (1997): Struck down Georgia's requirement that candidates for state office pass a drug test, finding the state's interest was "symbolic, not special."

### Welfare and Student Testing (1996-2010): Expanding the Testing Regime

- **Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (1996)**: Welfare reform legislation signed by President Clinton included a provision (Section 902) explicitly authorizing states to drug test TANF recipients, though it did not require it. This opened the door to state welfare drug testing programs.
- **Michigan's Failed Experiment**: Michigan became the first state to implement suspicionless drug testing of all welfare recipients in 1999, but the program was struck down by the 6th Circuit in *Marchwinski v. Howard*, 309 F.3d 330 (6th Cir. 2002), which held that blanket testing without individualized suspicion violated the Fourth Amendment.
- **Student Athlete Testing**: In ***Vernonia School District 47J v. Acton***, 515 U.S. 646 (1995), the Supreme Court upheld random urinalysis of student athletes, finding that students in school have reduced privacy expectations and that the government interest in deterring drug use among athletes was sufficient.
- **Expansion to All Extracurricular Activities**: In ***Board of Education of Independent School District No. 92 of Pottawatomie County v. Earls***, 536 U.S. 822 (2002), the Supreme Court extended the *Vernonia* ruling to all students participating in extracurricular activities, not just athletes. This decision significantly expanded the scope of permissible student drug testing.
- **ONDCP and Drug-Free Schools**: The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) under the George W. Bush administration promoted random student drug testing as a prevention strategy, directing $10-15 million annually in grant funding to schools implementing testing programs through 2008.

### Cannabis Legalization and the Testing Crisis (2012-Present): A System Under Strain

- **Colorado and Washington (2012)**: The passage of cannabis legalization ballot measures in Colorado (Amendment 64) and Washington (Initiative 502) in 2012 created the first direct conflict between state-legal cannabis use and workplace drug testing.
- **Court Rulings Against Workers**: In *Coats v. Dish Network*, 350 P.3d 849 (Colo. 2015), the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that employers could terminate employees for off-duty cannabis use, finding that Colorado's lawful off-duty activities statute did not protect conduct that was illegal under federal law.
- **State Employment Protections (2019-2024)**: Beginning with Nevada (2019) and Maine (2020), a growing wave of states enacted laws prohibiting employers from taking adverse action based on pre-employment or off-duty cannabis tests, with varying exemptions for safety-sensitive positions.
- **Amazon's Shift (2021)**: Amazon's decision to drop pre-employment cannabis screening for non-DOT positions represented a major corporate inflection point, with the company publicly advocating for the MORE Act (federal cannabis legalization).
- **Fentanyl Test Strip Movement (2018-2024)**: The explosion of fentanyl-related overdose deaths prompted a rapid legislative movement to legalize fentanyl test strips. Maryland and the District of Columbia were among the first jurisdictions to explicitly exempt FTS from paraphernalia laws (2018), and by 2024, 39 states and D.C. had followed.
- **SAMHSA Oral Fluid Guidelines (2019-2024)**: SAMHSA published revised Mandatory Guidelines in 2019 authorizing oral fluid testing as an alternative specimen for federal workplace testing, with full implementation phased in through 2024. Oral fluid tests detect more recent use (24-48 hours for cannabis vs. 1-30 days for urine), partially addressing the impairment detection gap.

## Lessons from History

### Pattern 1: Political Symbolism Over Scientific Evidence

Drug testing policies have historically been adopted in response to political pressure and public fear rather than scientific evidence of effectiveness. Executive Order 12564 was issued amid the height of the crack cocaine panic. The Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act followed high-profile accidents. Welfare drug testing was enacted during the welfare reform movement's focus on personal responsibility. In each case, the policy served a symbolic function -- demonstrating toughness on drugs or personal responsibility -- before (and in some cases, without) evidence that it achieved its stated goals. The 2007 National Research Council review's finding of "no evidence" that workplace testing reduces drug use underscores this pattern.

### Pattern 2: Technology Lag Behind Policy Needs

The testing technologies adopted in the 1980s -- primarily urine immunoassay screening with GC-MS confirmation -- were designed to detect metabolites of substances consumed days or weeks earlier, not to measure current impairment. Thirty-five years later, the system still lacks a validated, widely deployed test for real-time cannabis impairment. This technological lag has become the central obstacle to rational drug testing policy in the era of cannabis legalization.

### Pattern 3: Industry Momentum Creates Policy Inertia

The $12 billion drug testing industry has created powerful constituencies with economic interests in maintaining the current testing regime. SAMHSA-certified laboratories, specimen collection networks, Medical Review Officers, Substance Abuse Professionals, and testing technology companies all depend on the continuation and expansion of testing programs. This economic momentum makes reform difficult even when the evidence base for testing is weak.

### Pattern 4: Courts Expand Government Testing Power Incrementally

From *Skinner* (1989) to *Earls* (2002), the Supreme Court progressively expanded the "special needs" doctrine to permit suspicionless drug testing in an expanding set of contexts: railroad workers, customs agents, student athletes, all extracurricular students. Each ruling narrowed the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches in the drug testing context. The *Lebron* decision (2013) represents a rare counterexample, limiting welfare testing to cases with individualized suspicion.
