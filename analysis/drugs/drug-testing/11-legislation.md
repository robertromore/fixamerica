# Drug Testing: Legislation

## Overview

Drug testing reform requires a multi-track legislative approach. The primary federal legislation addresses three pillars: (1) protecting workers from adverse employment action based on off-duty cannabis use in non-safety-sensitive positions, (2) legalizing drug checking equipment and funding harm reduction testing services, and (3) mandating confirmatory testing procedures for all workplace drug tests. State model legislation provides a template for employment protections and drug checking legalization at the state level. The regulatory framework addresses DOT testing modernization, SAMHSA guideline updates, and EEOC enforcement guidance. No constitutional amendment is required.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments required for this reform.* The proposed legislation operates within existing Congressional commerce power (workplace regulation), spending power (federal grants), and federal preemption authority. Fourth Amendment considerations are addressed by narrowing, not expanding, the scope of government-mandated testing.

## Federal Legislation

### The Workplace Drug Testing Fairness Act

**Purpose**: To protect employees and job applicants from adverse employment action based on off-duty cannabis use in non-safety-sensitive positions, while preserving safety-sensitive testing under DOT and NRC regulations.

**Key Provisions**:

1. Prohibits employers from testing for cannabis metabolites in pre-employment screening for non-safety-sensitive positions
2. Prohibits adverse employment action based solely on a positive cannabis test reflecting off-duty use
3. Preserves employer authority to prohibit cannabis use during work hours and to enforce reasonable suspicion and post-accident testing
4. Exempts DOT-regulated and NRC-regulated safety-sensitive positions from cannabis testing restrictions

**Draft Text**:

```text
119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To protect employees and job applicants from adverse employment action based
on the use of cannabis during non-work hours, and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Workplace Drug Testing Fairness Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) As of 2024, 24 States and the District of Columbia have enacted laws
legalizing recreational cannabis for adults, covering approximately 180
million Americans (54 percent of the U.S. population).

(2) Standard urine drug tests detect cannabis metabolites (THC-COOH) for
3 to 30 days after last use, and do not measure current impairment or
fitness for duty.

(3) A 2019 study in the International Journal of Drug Policy found no
increase in workplace fatalities in States with legal cannabis compared
to States without legalization.

(4) Major employers including Amazon, Apple, and Google have eliminated
pre-employment cannabis screening without reported safety impacts.

(5) Twelve States have enacted employment protections for off-duty cannabis
use, creating an inconsistent patchwork of worker protections.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:

(1) CANNABIS.—The term "cannabis" means all parts of the plant Cannabis
sativa L. and any compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or
preparation of such plant.

(2) CANNABIS METABOLITE.—The term "cannabis metabolite" means any
substance produced by the metabolism of cannabis in the human body,
including 11-nor-9-carboxy-delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC-COOH).

(3) NON-SAFETY-SENSITIVE POSITION.—The term "non-safety-sensitive
position" means any employment position that is not subject to drug
testing requirements under—
    (A) the Omnibus Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991;
    (B) regulations of the Department of Transportation under title 49,
    Code of Federal Regulations, part 40;
    (C) regulations of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; or
    (D) any other Federal safety-sensitive testing mandate.

(4) ADVERSE EMPLOYMENT ACTION.—The term "adverse employment action"
includes termination, suspension, demotion, refusal to hire, refusal to
promote, or any other materially adverse change in the terms or conditions
of employment.

SEC. 4. PROTECTIONS FOR OFF-DUTY CANNABIS USE.

(a) IN GENERAL.—No employer shall take an adverse employment action against
an employee or applicant for employment in a non-safety-sensitive position
based on—
    (1) a positive drug test for cannabis metabolites, unless the employer
    has evidence that the employee or applicant was impaired by cannabis
    during work hours or on the employer's premises; or
    (2) the employee's or applicant's lawful use of cannabis during
    non-work hours and off the employer's premises.

(b) EMPLOYER RIGHTS PRESERVED.—Nothing in this section shall be construed
to—
    (1) prohibit an employer from maintaining a policy against cannabis
    use during work hours or on the employer's premises;
    (2) prohibit an employer from conducting reasonable suspicion or
    post-accident drug testing for cannabis;
    (3) prohibit an employer from taking adverse action against an
    employee who is demonstrably impaired by cannabis during work hours; or
    (4) require an employer to permit cannabis use on the employer's
    premises.

(c) SAFETY-SENSITIVE EXEMPTION.—This section does not apply to employees
or applicants in safety-sensitive positions as defined in section 3(3).

SEC. 5. CONFIRMATORY TESTING REQUIREMENT.

(a) IN GENERAL.—No employer shall take an adverse employment action against
an employee or applicant based on a drug test result unless—
    (1) the initial screening result has been confirmed by gas
    chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), liquid chromatography-tandem
    mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), or an equivalent confirmation method
    approved by SAMHSA; and
    (2) the confirmed result has been reviewed by a Medical Review Officer
    or other qualified medical professional.

(b) COST OF CONFIRMATION.—The cost of confirmatory testing shall be borne
by the employer.

SEC. 6. ENFORCEMENT.

(a) PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.—An employee or applicant aggrieved by a
violation of this Act may bring a civil action in any court of competent
jurisdiction.

(b) REMEDIES.—A court may award—
    (1) compensatory damages;
    (2) reinstatement or front pay;
    (3) reasonable attorney's fees and costs; and
    (4) such other equitable relief as the court deems appropriate.

(c) ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT.—The Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission shall have authority to enforce this Act in the same manner
as title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

SEC. 7. PREEMPTION.

(a) FLOOR, NOT CEILING.—This Act establishes minimum protections and does
not preempt any State or local law that provides greater protections to
employees or applicants.

(b) FEDERAL SAFETY-SENSITIVE TESTING.—Nothing in this Act shall be
construed to modify or limit drug testing requirements under the Omnibus
Transportation Employee Testing Act of 1991, regulations of the Department
of Transportation, or regulations of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.

SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect 180 days after the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 2 (Findings)**: Establishes the factual record supporting legislation, including the scale of state legalization, the scientific basis for the metabolite-impairment distinction, and evidence that major employers have reformed without safety impacts.
- **Section 4 (Protections)**: The core provision protects workers in non-safety-sensitive positions from adverse action based on cannabis metabolite tests while preserving employer authority over on-duty conduct and reasonable suspicion testing.
- **Section 5 (Confirmatory Testing)**: Mandates that all adverse employment actions based on drug tests require confirmation by GC-MS or LC-MS/MS, addressing the 5-10% false positive rate of initial immunoassay screening.
- **Section 7 (Preemption)**: Establishes a federal floor that does not preempt stronger state protections, resolving the current patchwork while allowing state innovation.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Act takes effect | 180 days after enactment | N/A |
| EEOC publishes enforcement guidance | 270 days after enactment | EEOC |
| Employers update testing policies | 180 days after enactment | Employers |
| First enforcement actions | 1 year after enactment | EEOC, private litigants |

**Regulatory Authority**: EEOC enforces alongside private right of action. SAMHSA provides technical guidance on confirmatory testing standards.

**Challenges**:

- **Testing industry opposition**: DATIA and testing laboratories will lobby against reduced testing volume
- **Safety-sensitive boundary disputes**: Employers may classify positions as "safety-sensitive" to avoid cannabis protections; clear regulatory guidance needed
- **Federal-state cannabis conflict**: Until cannabis is descheduled or rescheduled, the federal illegality creates tension with employment protections

**Refinements**:

- **Define "safety-sensitive" with specificity**: EEOC guidance should provide clear criteria to prevent employers from overclassifying positions
- **Include anti-retaliation provision**: Protect workers who assert rights under this Act from employer retaliation

### The Drug Checking Equipment Legalization Act

**Purpose**: To remove drug checking equipment, fentanyl test strips, and immunoassay reagent strips from the federal definition of drug paraphernalia, and to establish a federal grant program for community-based drug checking services.

**Key Provisions**:

1. Amends 21 U.S.C. Section 863 to exclude drug checking equipment from the definition of drug paraphernalia
2. Establishes a SAMHSA grant program for community-based drug checking services
3. Authorizes $100 million annually for drug checking grants

**Draft Text**:

```text
119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To amend the Controlled Substances Act to exclude drug checking equipment
from the definition of drug paraphernalia, to establish a grant program
for community drug checking services, and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Drug Checking Equipment Legalization Act
of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) In 2023, 107,543 Americans died from drug overdoses, with
approximately 75,000 deaths (70 percent) involving synthetic opioids
including fentanyl (CDC WONDER, 2024).

(2) Fentanyl test strips, which cost approximately $1 each, have been
shown to change drug use behavior in 63 percent of users who receive a
positive result (Peiper et al., Drug and Alcohol Dependence, 2019).

(3) As of 2024, 39 States and the District of Columbia have removed
fentanyl test strips from their drug paraphernalia definitions, but 11
States retain paraphernalia classifications, and the federal statute
creates legal uncertainty.

(4) Community-based drug checking services using Fourier-transform
infrared spectroscopy and mass spectrometry have identified emerging
contaminants including xylazine and novel synthetic opioids before
public health alerts.

SEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES ACT.

Section 863 of title 21, United States Code, is amended by adding at the
end the following:

"(g) DRUG CHECKING EQUIPMENT EXCEPTION.—
    (1) IN GENERAL.—The term 'drug paraphernalia' does not include any
    item, product, or material used, designed for use, or intended for use
    in testing or analyzing the composition, purity, or potency of a
    controlled substance or counterfeit substance, including—
        (A) fentanyl test strips or immunoassay reagent strips;
        (B) colorimetric reagent testing kits;
        (C) Fourier-transform infrared spectrometers;
        (D) gas chromatography-mass spectrometry equipment;
        (E) liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry equipment; and
        (F) any other equipment used for the purpose of drug checking or
        substance analysis to reduce the risk of overdose or adverse health
        outcomes.
    (2) LIMITATION.—The exception under paragraph (1) applies regardless
    of whether the item is possessed by an individual, organization,
    public health agency, or other entity."

SEC. 4. GRANT PROGRAM.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Administrator of the Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration shall establish a grant program to support
community-based drug checking services.

(b) ELIGIBLE ENTITIES.—Grants under this section may be awarded to—
    (1) State and local health departments;
    (2) syringe service programs;
    (3) community health centers;
    (4) harm reduction organizations;
    (5) academic medical centers; and
    (6) other entities as determined by the Administrator.

(c) USE OF FUNDS.—Grant funds may be used for—
    (1) procurement of drug checking equipment;
    (2) training of staff to operate and interpret drug checking results;
    (3) distribution of fentanyl test strips;
    (4) integration of drug checking with naloxone distribution, syringe
    services, and treatment referral;
    (5) data collection and reporting on drug checking results; and
    (6) public health surveillance based on drug checking data.

(d) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.—There are authorized to be
appropriated to carry out this section—
    (1) $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
    (3) $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
    (4) $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 5. REPORTING.

Not later than 1 year after the first grants are awarded under section 4,
and annually thereafter, SAMHSA shall submit to Congress a report that
includes—
    (1) the number and location of funded drug checking services;
    (2) the number of samples analyzed and substances detected;
    (3) behavioral outcomes data (changes in drug use behavior following
    drug checking results);
    (4) naloxone distribution and treatment referrals at drug checking
    sites; and
    (5) recommendations for program improvements.

SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 3 (Paraphernalia Amendment)**: Broadly excludes all drug checking equipment from the federal paraphernalia statute, providing legal protection for fentanyl test strips, colorimetric tests, and laboratory-grade equipment.
- **Section 4 (Grant Program)**: Establishes sustained federal funding for community-based drug checking services, modeled on SAMHSA's existing harm reduction grant programs.
- **Section 5 (Reporting)**: Requires annual reporting to Congress to build the evidence base and ensure accountability.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Act takes effect (paraphernalia amendment) | Immediately upon enactment | N/A |
| SAMHSA publishes grant solicitation | 180 days after enactment | SAMHSA |
| First grants awarded | 1 year after enactment | SAMHSA |
| First annual report to Congress | 2 years after enactment | SAMHSA |

**Regulatory Authority**: SAMHSA administers the grant program. The amendment to 21 U.S.C. Section 863 is self-executing.

**Challenges**:

- **State paraphernalia laws**: Federal legalization does not preempt state paraphernalia laws; 11 states may still classify drug checking equipment as paraphernalia
- **Law enforcement opposition**: Some law enforcement agencies oppose drug checking as enabling drug use
- **Appropriations risk**: The authorized $100 million/year must be appropriated annually

**Refinements**:

- **Add preemption clause**: Consider federal preemption of state paraphernalia laws as applied to drug checking equipment
- **Include state incentive grants**: Provide financial incentives for remaining 11 states to legalize drug checking equipment

## State Model Legislation

### Model Cannabis Employment Protection Act

**Purpose**: To protect employees and job applicants from adverse employment action based on off-duty cannabis use in states where recreational cannabis is legal.

**Adaptability Notes**: This model is designed for states with legal recreational cannabis. States should adapt the safety-sensitive exemption list to their regulatory framework and adjust the enforcement mechanism to their existing employment discrimination law structure.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "[State] Cannabis
Employment Protection Act of [Year]".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS.

The [Legislature] finds that:

(1) [State] legalized recreational cannabis for adults in [Year].
(2) Standard urine drug tests detect cannabis metabolites for 3 to 30
days after last use and do not measure current impairment.
(3) Employees in [State] face the paradox of legal off-duty cannabis
use resulting in job loss or denial of employment.
(4) [Number] employers in [State] have already eliminated cannabis
screening from pre-employment testing.

SECTION 3. PROTECTIONS.

(a) No employer shall refuse to hire, discharge, or otherwise discriminate
against an individual in compensation or in terms of employment based on—
    (1) the individual's use of cannabis during non-work hours and off the
    employer's premises; or
    (2) a positive drug test for cannabis metabolites, unless the employer
    has evidence of impairment during work hours.

(b) EXCEPTIONS.—This section does not apply to—
    (1) positions subject to federal DOT testing requirements;
    (2) positions designated as safety-sensitive under [State] law;
    (3) law enforcement officers; or
    (4) positions where cannabis use is prohibited by a federal contract
    or grant.

SECTION 4. ENFORCEMENT.

An aggrieved individual may file a complaint with the [State Human Rights
Commission/Labor Department] or bring a civil action within [2 years].

SECTION 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect [90/180] days after enactment.
```

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agencies**: SAMHSA (testing guidelines), DOT (transportation testing), EEOC (employment discrimination), DOL (Drug-Free Workplace Act compliance)

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **EEOC Enforcement Guidance on Cannabis Testing**: Guidance on employer obligations under the Workplace Drug Testing Fairness Act, including definition of safety-sensitive positions and standards for "reasonable suspicion" - statutory deadline: 270 days after enactment.
2. **SAMHSA Confirmatory Testing Standards Update**: Revised Mandatory Guidelines incorporating confirmatory testing requirements for all employer testing programs - statutory deadline: 1 year after enactment.
3. **DOT Oral Fluid Testing Rule**: Final rule adopting oral fluid as an authorized primary specimen for DOT-regulated testing programs - timeline: 18-24 months after authorization.
4. **SAMHSA Drug Checking Grant Program Rules**: Notice of Funding Opportunity (NOFO) for community-based drug checking services - statutory deadline: 180 days after enactment.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Civil Penalties**: Employers who violate the Workplace Drug Testing Fairness Act face compensatory damages, reinstatement/front pay, and attorney's fees through private right of action and EEOC enforcement.
- **Administrative Actions**: EEOC investigation and conciliation under Title VII enforcement model.
- **Private Right of Action**: Individual employees and applicants may sue in federal court.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Commerce Clause Authority**: The Workplace Drug Testing Fairness Act regulates employer conduct in interstate commerce, well within Congress's Commerce Clause authority under established precedent (*Heart of Atlanta Motel v. United States*, 379 U.S. 241 (1964); *Katzenbach v. McClung*, 379 U.S. 294 (1964)).

**Fourth Amendment**: The Drug Checking Equipment Legalization Act reduces government intrusion by legalizing equipment currently classified as paraphernalia, presenting no Fourth Amendment issues. The Workplace Drug Testing Fairness Act narrows the scope of permissible employer testing, which is consistent with Fourth Amendment principles where government mandates or incentivizes testing.

**Federal-State Conflict**: Until cannabis is rescheduled or descheduled under the Controlled Substances Act, employment protections for cannabis use create a novel federal framework that protects conduct that remains federally illegal. This is constitutionally permissible -- Congress can choose to protect employees from discrimination based on conduct it has not legalized -- but creates policy tension that would be resolved by separate cannabis rescheduling or descheduling legislation.

### Preemption

The Workplace Drug Testing Fairness Act establishes a federal floor, not a ceiling. States with stronger protections retain their laws. States without protections must comply with the federal minimum. DOT and NRC testing mandates are explicitly preserved and not preempted.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance is ensured through EEOC enforcement, private right of action, and employer liability for violations. The confirmatory testing mandate is enforced through the private right of action -- an employee terminated based on an unconfirmed screening result may sue for reinstatement and damages.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| Overclassification of safety-sensitive positions | Employers designate non-safety roles as "safety-sensitive" to continue cannabis testing | High | EEOC guidance with specific criteria; burden on employer to justify classification; employees may challenge classification through EEOC complaint |
| "Reasonable suspicion" pretext | Employers use vague "reasonable suspicion" claims as a pretext to test employees suspected of off-duty cannabis use | Medium | Require documented, articulable facts supporting reasonable suspicion; supervisor training requirement; contemporaneous written record |
| Federal contractor exemption expansion | Employers seek unnecessary federal contracts to invoke the Drug-Free Workplace Act exemption | Low | Limit exemption to positions directly performing federal contract work; EEOC enforcement of abuse |
| State paraphernalia laws persist | 11 states maintain drug checking equipment as paraphernalia despite federal legalization | Medium | Federal preemption clause for drug checking equipment; or condition federal grant funding on state legalization |
| Confirmatory testing delays | Employers delay confirmatory testing to extend the period of adverse action (suspension pending results) | Medium | Require expedited confirmation (72-hour turnaround); prohibit suspension pending confirmation unless safety-sensitive |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| Does not address DOT cannabis testing | 12.5 million DOT-regulated workers remain subject to cannabis metabolite testing | Federal cannabis scheduling prevents DOT reform without separate scheduling legislation | Pursue cannabis rescheduling/descheduling in parallel; transition DOT to oral fluid to narrow detection window |
| Impairment testing not yet available | Cannot mandate impairment-based testing because technology is not validated | Scientific and technological immaturity | Fund $200 million R&D program through separate appropriation |
| Does not address hair testing racial bias directly | Hair testing remains available for employer use | Legislative scope limited to cannabis employment protections | Pursue separate Hair Follicle Testing Prohibition Act or EEOC disparate impact guidance |
| Does not preempt state paraphernalia laws | 11 states may still ban drug checking equipment | Political compromise to avoid preemption backlash | Include incentive grants for state legalization; pursue state-level advocacy in remaining 11 states |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Safety-sensitive overclassification fix**: Within 1 year of enactment, EEOC publishes guidance with specific criteria for safety-sensitive designation, including a presumption that office, retail, hospitality, and technology positions are non-safety-sensitive. Employees may file EEOC complaints challenging classifications.
2. **Reasonable suspicion documentation fix**: Regulatory amendment requiring employers to maintain contemporaneous written records of articulable facts supporting reasonable suspicion cannabis testing; records subject to EEOC inspection.
3. **State paraphernalia preemption fix**: If 11 states have not legalized drug checking equipment within 3 years of federal legalization, Congress should consider a narrow preemption clause applicable only to drug checking equipment listed in 21 U.S.C. Section 863(g).
4. **Confirmatory testing timeline fix**: Regulatory amendment establishing a 72-hour maximum turnaround for confirmatory testing, with employer prohibited from maintaining adverse action (other than safety-sensitive duty removal) pending results.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

The Drug Checking Equipment Legalization Act does not require a sunset clause -- paraphernalia legalization should be permanent. The grant program is authorized for 5 years (FY2027-FY2031) and requires Congressional reauthorization thereafter, providing a natural review point.

The Workplace Drug Testing Fairness Act should include a 5-year Congressional review requirement: GAO evaluation of employment outcomes, safety data, and enforcement effectiveness, with findings reported to the Senate HELP Committee and House Education and Workforce Committee.
