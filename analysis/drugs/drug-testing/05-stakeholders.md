# Drug Testing: Stakeholders

The drug testing policy landscape is shaped by the interactions of employers, government agencies, testing industry companies, workers, civil liberties organizations, harm reduction advocates, and public health agencies, each with distinct interests, power, and resources.

## Who Is Affected

### Primary Stakeholders

| Group | Impact | Size | Key Interests |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|
| Workers subject to workplace drug testing | May face job loss, denial of employment, or career damage from positive tests for legal off-duty conduct | ~55-60 million tested annually | Job security, privacy, fairness, ability to use legal cannabis off-duty |
| DOT-regulated safety-sensitive workers | Subject to mandatory testing regardless of state cannabis law; positive test triggers removal from duty and SAP process | ~12.5 million | Continued employment, clarity on cannabis rules, impairment-based standards |
| TANF/welfare applicants subject to drug testing | Must submit to testing as a condition of benefits; face denial or delay of assistance | ~200,000-400,000 tested annually (across 15 states) | Access to benefits without invasive surveillance, dignity, privacy |
| People who use drugs (PWUD) | Directly affected by drug checking access, paraphernalia laws, and testing as a condition of employment/benefits/housing | ~48.7 million with SUD; ~30 million current illicit drug users | Access to drug checking services, harm reduction, non-punitive policies |
| Students in public schools with testing programs | Subject to random testing as a condition of extracurricular participation | ~5-6 million in schools with testing programs | Participation in activities, privacy, non-stigmatization |
| Job applicants | May be denied employment based on pre-employment drug test results | Tens of millions annually | Fair hiring practices, privacy, ability to use legal substances off-duty |

### Secondary Stakeholders

- **Families of workers**: Affected by job loss, financial instability, and stress when breadwinners face adverse testing consequences
- **Employers in tight labor markets**: Struggle to fill positions when drug testing eliminates otherwise qualified candidates, particularly in states with legal cannabis
- **Criminal defendants on supervised release**: Subject to frequent drug testing as a condition of probation or parole; face reincarceration for positive results
- **Medical marijuana patients**: Hold state medical marijuana cards but may face employment consequences due to positive THC tests

## Who Has Power

### Decision Makers

| Actor | Role | Authority | Resources | Influence Level |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| U.S. Congress | Sets federal drug testing mandates, drug scheduling, paraphernalia laws | Legislative authority over DOT testing, Drug-Free Workplace Act, CSA | N/A | High |
| Department of Transportation (DOT) | Administers the largest mandated testing program; sets testing regulations for safety-sensitive workers | 49 CFR Part 40; modal administrations (FMCSA, FAA, FRA, FTA, PHMSA, USCG) | ~$12 million (drug testing program budget) | High |
| SAMHSA | Sets technical standards for federal workplace testing, certifies laboratories, publishes Mandatory Guidelines | SAMHSA Mandatory Guidelines; National Laboratory Certification Program (NLCP) | ~$7 billion (total SAMHSA budget, FY2024); testing program is small fraction | High |
| State legislatures | Enact cannabis legalization, employment protections, welfare testing mandates, paraphernalia laws | State legislative authority | Varies | High (within state) |
| Individual employers | Set testing policies for their workforce (beyond federal mandates) | Employment-at-will doctrine; company policy authority | Varies; Fortune 500 testing budgets: $1-10 million annually | High (for employees) |
| Federal courts | Interpret constitutional limits on drug testing under Fourth Amendment | Judicial review authority | N/A | High (precedential) |

### Key Organizations and Institutions

- **Drug and Alcohol Testing Industry Association (DATIA)**: The primary trade association for the drug testing industry, representing laboratories, collection sites, MROs, SAPs, and testing technology companies. DATIA lobbies against cannabis testing reform and advocates for expanded testing mandates. Annual revenue: ~$3 million; membership: ~1,500 companies.
- **Quest Diagnostics**: The largest drug testing laboratory in the U.S., processing approximately 11 million workplace drug tests annually. Publishes the annual Drug Testing Index, the most widely cited source of testing data. Revenue from drug testing services: ~$500 million annually.
- **Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM)**: Represents ~300,000 HR professionals; publishes guidance on workplace drug testing policy. Has adopted an increasingly nuanced position on cannabis testing, acknowledging employer challenges in legal states.
- **National Safety Council (NSC)**: Advocates for workplace safety including drug testing, particularly in safety-sensitive industries. Publishes employer toolkits and safety data.
- **American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)**: Leading opponent of suspicionless drug testing, welfare drug testing, and student drug testing. Has litigated multiple cases challenging testing programs as Fourth Amendment violations.
- **National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML)**: Advocates against workplace cannabis testing and for employment protections for off-duty cannabis use.
- **Drug Policy Alliance (DPA)**: Advocates for drug checking services, fentanyl test strip legalization, and comprehensive drug policy reform including testing reform.
- **National Harm Reduction Coalition (NHRC)**: Promotes drug checking services and fentanyl test strips as evidence-based harm reduction interventions.

### Influencers

- **NORML and cannabis industry trade groups**: The National Cannabis Industry Association (NCIA) and state-level cannabis trade associations lobby for removal of cannabis from workplace testing panels and for employment protections. The legal cannabis industry ($33.6 billion market, 2023) has growing political influence.
- **Trial lawyers**: Plaintiff attorneys who represent workers terminated for positive tests; defense attorneys who represent employers in negligent hiring/retention litigation. Both sides have financial interests in the rules governing testing.
- **Medical and public health professional organizations**: The American Medical Association (AMA), American Public Health Association (APHA), and American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine (ACOEM) have issued statements on testing policy, generally supporting evidence-based and impairment-focused approaches.
- **Labor unions**: The International Brotherhood of Teamsters, BLET, and other transportation unions represent DOT-regulated workers and negotiate testing policies in collective bargaining agreements. Unions generally support reasonable testing standards but oppose punitive policies that fail to distinguish impairment from off-duty use.

## Stakeholder Interests and Alignment

### Aligned Interests (Potential Coalition Partners)

| Coalition | Shared Interest | Strength |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Workers, ACLU, NORML, cannabis industry | End workplace cannabis testing for non-safety-sensitive positions | Strong |
| Harm reduction orgs, public health agencies, PWUD | Expand and fund drug checking services and fentanyl test strips | Strong |
| Employers in tight labor markets, cannabis industry, workers | Remove cannabis from pre-employment testing to expand applicant pool | Moderate-Strong |
| Civil liberties orgs, welfare recipients, fiscal conservatives | End welfare drug testing programs (ineffective, costly, unconstitutional) | Moderate |
| Safety advocates, DOT, impairment technology developers | Develop and validate impairment-based testing to replace metabolite testing | Moderate |
| Labor unions, workers, civil liberties orgs | Strengthen privacy protections and confirmatory testing requirements | Strong |

### Conflicting Interests

- **Employers vs. Workers on Testing Scope**: Employers assert the right to maintain drug-free workplaces and to test as a condition of employment; workers assert the right to privacy in off-duty legal conduct.
- **Testing Industry vs. Reform Advocates**: The $12 billion testing industry has financial interests in maintaining current testing volume and panels; reform advocates seek to reduce unnecessary testing and remove cannabis from panels.
- **DOT/Safety Regulators vs. Cannabis Legalization**: DOT mandates cannabis testing for all safety-sensitive workers regardless of state law; cannabis legalization advocates argue that metabolite testing fails to measure impairment and punishes legal conduct.
- **Law Enforcement vs. Harm Reduction on Drug Checking**: Some law enforcement agencies view drug checking services and fentanyl test strips as enabling drug use; harm reduction advocates present strong evidence that these tools reduce overdose deaths.

### The Testing Industry Iron Triangle

The drug testing system is sustained by a reinforcing relationship among three pillars:

1. **Government Regulators** (DOT, SAMHSA): Set testing mandates and standards that create the market.
2. **Testing Industry** (laboratories, device manufacturers, MROs, SAPs, collection sites): Provide services required by mandates and lobby for maintenance/expansion of testing requirements.
3. **Employer Compliance Departments**: Implement testing programs to satisfy regulatory requirements and reduce liability exposure.

This iron triangle is self-reinforcing: regulators create mandates that generate industry revenue, the industry lobbies for maintenance of mandates, and employers comply because non-compliance carries legal risk. Workers and civil liberties advocates are largely outside this triangle.

## Influence Mechanisms

How stakeholders exert influence on drug testing policy:

- **Lobbying**: DATIA and its member companies lobby Congress and state legislatures to maintain and expand testing mandates. In 2023, the testing industry spent an estimated $5-8 million on federal and state lobbying combined. Cannabis industry lobbying (NCIA, state associations) has grown to exceed testing industry lobbying in many states.
- **Campaign Contributions**: Drug testing companies contribute to candidates on transportation and labor committees who oversee DOT testing policy. Cannabis industry political contributions have grown rapidly, reaching approximately $20 million in the 2022 federal election cycle (OpenSecrets, 2023).
- **Revolving Door**: SAMHSA and DOT officials who oversee testing programs frequently move to private-sector positions in the testing industry, and industry officials serve on SAMHSA advisory boards.
- **Public Advocacy**: ACLU, NORML, and DPA conduct public advocacy campaigns including litigation, ballot measures, and media campaigns. NORML's #EndCannabisTestingNow campaign has generated significant media coverage.
- **Expertise and Data Control**: Quest Diagnostics' Drug Testing Index is the most widely cited data source on workplace testing, giving the company significant influence over the public narrative. Quest's annual reports emphasize rising positivity rates, which industry advocates use to argue for maintaining or expanding testing.
- **Litigation**: The ACLU has been the most active litigator against drug testing programs, successfully challenging welfare testing in Florida (*Lebron*) and other states. NORML and cannabis industry groups have filed amicus briefs in employment testing cases.
