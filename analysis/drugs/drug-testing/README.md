# Drug Testing

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of drug testing policy in the United States, encompassing workplace testing programs, government-mandated testing requirements, welfare and public benefits drug screening, student and athlete testing, drug checking services, and the technologies and civil liberties issues that pervade the field.

## Overview

Drug testing is a $12 billion industry in the United States that touches the lives of tens of millions of Americans each year. Approximately 56% of U.S. employers require some form of drug testing, and the federal government mandates testing for millions of workers in safety-sensitive positions under Department of Transportation (DOT) regulations. Beyond the workplace, drug testing is imposed as a condition for receiving public benefits in multiple states, for participation in school athletics, as part of criminal justice supervision, and in child custody proceedings.

The policy landscape is shaped by deep tensions between public safety, employer prerogatives, individual privacy, scientific accuracy, and racial equity. The proliferation of fentanyl-adulterated substances has also spurred a new category of drug testing -- drug checking services and fentanyl test strips -- that operates under a harm reduction framework fundamentally different from the punitive model underlying traditional drug testing. This analysis examines the full spectrum of drug testing policy, from DOT-regulated urinalysis to community-based drug checking, and proposes evidence-based reforms to modernize a system that has not kept pace with changes in drug use patterns, testing technology, or civil liberties law.
