# Drug Testing: What You Can Do

Drug testing policy affects tens of millions of Americans each year -- as workers, job applicants, benefits recipients, students, and people who use drugs. Reform requires citizen engagement at every level, from individual workplace advocacy to federal legislative campaigns. The fentanyl crisis has added urgency: drug checking services save lives, and removing legal barriers to their use is literally a life-or-death policy issue.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- Subscribe to *Marijuana Moment* (<https://www.marijuanamoment.net>) for daily updates on cannabis legalization and workplace testing reform
- Follow the Drug Policy Alliance (<https://drugpolicy.org>) for updates on drug checking legalization and harm reduction policy
- Read the Quest Diagnostics Drug Testing Index (<https://www.questdiagnostics.com/dti>) for annual data on workplace testing trends
- Review your state's laws on cannabis employment protections at NORML's state law tracker (<https://norml.org/laws>)

### Know Your Rights

- **If you are asked to take a workplace drug test**: Understand whether the test is required by federal regulation (DOT), state law, or employer policy. Federal employees and DOT-regulated workers have different rights than private-sector employees.
- **If you receive a positive result**: You have the right to request a confirmatory test (GC-MS/LC-MS) in federally regulated programs. In non-regulated programs, check your state law -- some states require confirmation before adverse action.
- **If you use medical marijuana**: At least 38 states have medical marijuana programs, but employment protections vary widely. Some states protect medical marijuana patients from employer discrimination; others do not.
- **If you are a TANF applicant subject to testing**: The 11th Circuit ruled in *Lebron v. Secretary, FL DCF* (2013) that suspicionless testing of TANF applicants violates the Fourth Amendment. If you believe your rights have been violated, contact the ACLU.

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact Your Representatives**: When cannabis employment protection bills or drug checking legalization bills are pending in your state legislature or in Congress, contact your representatives to express support.
- **Submit Public Comments**: When DOT, SAMHSA, or state agencies issue proposed rules related to drug testing, submit public comments during the notice-and-comment period. Federal rulemaking comments can be submitted at <https://www.regulations.gov>.
- **Write Letters to the Editor**: Share your experience with drug testing, especially if you or someone you know has faced job loss or denial of benefits due to a positive test for legal off-duty cannabis use.
- **Share Information**: Distribute fentanyl test strips and information about drug checking services to people who may benefit. Many harm reduction organizations provide free FTS and training.

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- Form a local coalition of workers, employers, civil liberties advocates, and harm reduction organizations to advocate for state-level drug testing reform
- Host community information sessions on workers' rights regarding drug testing in your state, particularly in states with new cannabis employment protections
- Partner with local harm reduction organizations to distribute fentanyl test strips and connect people to drug checking services
- Organize a screening and discussion event around drug testing policy using materials from the Drug Policy Alliance or ACLU

### Build Coalitions

- Connect with local chapters of NORML, the ACLU, and the Drug Policy Alliance to coordinate advocacy
- Engage local business groups and chambers of commerce -- many employers, particularly in tight labor markets, support cannabis testing reform to expand their applicant pools
- Partner with labor unions (Teamsters, BLET, transit unions) that represent DOT-regulated workers and can advocate for testing modernization
- Engage faith communities that support addiction treatment over punishment

**What to Say - Template Email**:

```
Subject: Support Evidence-Based Drug Testing Reform

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

I am writing as a constituent from [City, State] to urge your support for evidence-based drug testing reform.

Current workplace drug testing policies are outdated. They rely on metabolite detection that identifies past use of legal substances rather than current impairment. With 24 states having legalized recreational cannabis, millions of Americans risk losing their jobs for legal off-duty conduct. Meanwhile, fentanyl test strips -- which cost $1 and are proven to reduce overdose deaths -- remain illegal in [X] states because they are classified as drug paraphernalia.

I urge you to support:
- Federal employment protections for off-duty cannabis use in non-safety-sensitive positions
- Legalization of fentanyl test strips and drug checking services
- Federal investment in impairment detection technology research
- An end to wasteful welfare drug testing programs

Over 107,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2023. Drug checking saves lives. Modernizing workplace testing protects workers and improves safety. These reforms are supported by evidence and endorsed by public health organizations.

Thank you for your service and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say - Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City]. I'm calling about drug testing reform. I'd like the [Representative/Senator] to support the legalization of fentanyl test strips, federal employment protections for off-duty cannabis use, and investment in impairment detection technology. These are evidence-based reforms that save lives and protect workers. Can you please note my position?"
```

### Support Legislation

Current or proposed legislation to support:

- **Federal Drug Checking Equipment Legalization Act**: Would amend 21 U.S.C. Section 863 to exclude fentanyl test strips and drug checking equipment from the federal paraphernalia definition -- contact your Senators and Representative to co-sponsor
- **State-level cannabis employment protection bills**: Active or proposed in multiple states; check NORML's legislative tracker for your state
- **State fentanyl test strip legalization**: If you live in one of the 11 states where FTS remain illegal (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, South Carolina, Texas, Wyoming), contact your state legislators

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "Do you support protecting workers from being fired for legal off-duty cannabis use in non-safety-sensitive positions?"
2. "Do you support legalizing fentanyl test strips and funding drug checking services to reduce overdose deaths?"
3. "Do you support ending welfare drug testing programs that cost more than they save and find positive rates of less than 1%?"
4. "Would you support federal investment in impairment detection technology so that safety-sensitive testing can focus on actual fitness for duty?"

**Voting Considerations**:

- Look for candidates who support evidence-based drug policy and harm reduction
- Check candidate positions on cannabis legalization and employment protections
- Note candidates' positions on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Senate HELP Committee, and Appropriations subcommittees that fund SAMHSA and NIDA

## Professional Actions

- **For Employers/HR Professionals**: Review your company's drug testing policy in light of state cannabis legalization. Consider whether pre-employment cannabis screening is necessary for non-safety-sensitive positions. Amazon, Apple, Google, and other major employers have eliminated cannabis screening without safety impacts.
- **For Attorneys**: Take on pro bono cases for workers terminated based on false positives or legal off-duty cannabis use. File amicus briefs in pending cannabis employment protection cases.
- **For Healthcare Providers**: Educate patients about drug testing rights, fentanyl test strips, and drug checking services. Distribute naloxone and FTS at clinical sites.
- **For Harm Reduction Workers**: Expand fentanyl test strip distribution and drug checking services. Document and publicize the results of drug checking programs to build the evidence base.
- **For Researchers**: Pursue federally funded research on impairment detection technology, drug checking effectiveness, and the relationship between drug testing and safety outcomes.
- **For Labor Union Representatives**: Negotiate for fair drug testing procedures in collective bargaining agreements, including mandatory confirmatory testing and protection for off-duty legal cannabis use.

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing drug testing reform with others, emphasize:

1. **Testing detects, it does not prevent**: "Urine drug testing detects metabolites from days or weeks ago, not current impairment. A positive cannabis test tells you nothing about whether a worker is fit for duty. We need impairment testing, not metabolite testing."
2. **Drug checking saves lives**: "Fentanyl test strips cost $1 and are proven to change behavior in 63% of users, reducing overdose risk. Over 107,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2023. Drug checking is one of the most cost-effective interventions available."
3. **Welfare testing is wasteful**: "State welfare drug testing programs find positive rates of 0.05-1.4% -- far below the general population rate of 9.4%. They cost $200-$7,000 per positive result. The money would be better spent on voluntary treatment services."
4. **Employers are already reforming**: "Amazon, Apple, Google, and hundreds of other employers have dropped pre-employment cannabis screening. They report no safety impact. The market is ahead of the law."

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "Drug testing makes workplaces safer" | The National Research Council found "no evidence" that testing reduces drug use or improves safety (2007). A 2022 meta-analysis confirmed weak evidence. | NRC, 2007; JOEM, 2022 |
| "Most welfare recipients use drugs" | Welfare testing programs find positive rates of 0.05-1.4%, far below the 9.4% general population rate. | State program reports; SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |
| "Fentanyl test strips enable drug use" | 63% of users who get a positive FTS result modify their behavior to reduce risk. FTS serve as engagement points for naloxone and treatment. | Peiper et al., 2019 |
| "Hair testing is the gold standard" | Hair testing has documented racial bias -- Black individuals produce 2-4x higher concentrations due to melanin binding. | Forensic Science International; Boston PD review, 2004 |
| "You can't test for impairment" | Oral fluid detects recent use (24-48 hrs). Breath-based THC and cognitive impairment testing are in development. | SAMHSA, 2024; Hound Labs; DRUID |
