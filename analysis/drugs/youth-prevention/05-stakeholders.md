# Youth Drug Prevention: Stakeholders

The youth drug prevention system is shaped by the interactions of several key groups, each with distinct interests, resources, and perspectives on what effective prevention looks like. The fundamental tension is between those who prioritize scientific evidence and those who prioritize political visibility, institutional preservation, or cultural values.

## Who Is Affected

### Primary Stakeholders

| Group | Impact | Size | Key Interests |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|
| Adolescents (ages 10-18) | Direct recipients of prevention programming; affected by substance use outcomes | ~42 million (Census, 2023) | Receiving credible, relevant information; not being patronized or scared; access to help when needed |
| Parents and families | Primary influence on adolescent substance attitudes; affected by children's outcomes | ~65 million parents of children under 18 | Confidence that schools address substance risks; practical tools for family conversations; assurance of child safety |
| Young adults (18-25) | Highest-risk age group for substance use escalation; affected by quality of earlier prevention | ~31 million (Census, 2023) | Continuity of prevention messaging into college/early adulthood; harm reduction information; treatment access |
| Adolescents in high-risk environments | Youth exposed to ACEs, poverty, community violence, parental substance use | ~10 million (estimated, SAMHSA, 2023) | Targeted prevention and early intervention; trauma-informed programming; connection to support services |
| Families affected by adolescent substance use | Parents, siblings of youth with substance use disorders | ~4 million families (SAMHSA, 2023) | Early identification; family-based intervention; support services; destigmatization |

### Secondary Stakeholders

- **K-12 educators and school staff**: 3.7 million teachers (NCES, 2023) who are expected to deliver or facilitate prevention programming, often without adequate training, time, or resources
- **School counselors**: 119,000 school counselors (ASCA, 2023) with an average caseload of 385 students, far exceeding the recommended 250:1 ratio, limiting capacity for prevention work
- **Pediatricians and family physicians**: 40,000+ pediatricians and family doctors who could conduct Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) but face time and training barriers
- **College and university administrators**: Overseeing campus prevention for the highest-risk age cohort; affected by enrollment, retention, and campus safety
- **Communities with high substance use burden**: Rural Appalachian, Native American, and economically distressed urban communities where adolescent substance use rates are highest and prevention resources are scarcest

## Who Has Power

### Decision Makers

| Actor | Role | Authority | Resources | Influence Level |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| U.S. Congress | Authorizes and funds prevention programs | Legislative authority; appropriations power | ~$494 million in direct prevention funding (FY2025) | High |
| SAMHSA/Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) | Administers federal prevention grants and technical assistance | Grant administration; evidence standards; technical assistance | $352 million (prevention set-aside + strategic prevention framework, FY2025) | High |
| ONDCP | Coordinates national drug policy including prevention | Policy coordination; Drug-Free Communities program | $110 million (DFC grants, FY2025); policy authority | High |
| State education agencies | Set curriculum standards and administer education funding | Curriculum authority; funding distribution; teacher certification | Varies by state; collectively billions in education funding | High |
| Local school boards and superintendents | Select prevention curricula and allocate school budgets | Curriculum selection; budget allocation; policy implementation | Local education budgets; direct programming decisions | High |
| FDA Center for Tobacco Products | Regulates tobacco and nicotine products including vaping devices | Product approval/denial; marketing restrictions; enforcement | $712 million (FY2024, funded by tobacco user fees) | Medium-High |

### Key Organizations and Institutions

- **NIDA (National Institute on Drug Abuse)**: The primary federal funder of prevention research, with a budget of $1.6 billion (FY2025). NIDA funds the Monitoring the Future survey and supports prevention science research, but does not directly administer prevention programs.
- **Blueprints for Healthy Youth Development (University of Colorado)**: The most rigorous independent registry of evidence-based prevention programs, rating programs on research quality and replication evidence. Widely recognized as the gold standard for prevention evidence ratings.
- **Society for Prevention Research (SPR)**: The leading professional organization for prevention scientists, representing approximately 1,500 researchers who generate the evidence base for prevention policy. SPR issues standards for prevention research and advocates for evidence-based policy.
- **D.A.R.E. America**: Nonprofit organization administering the D.A.R.E. program in approximately 6,500 communities. Maintains significant political relationships with law enforcement organizations and Congressional supporters.
- **Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America (CADCA)**: National organization representing over 5,000 community coalitions. CADCA provides training, advocacy, and technical assistance and is a key intermediary between ONDCP and local prevention efforts.

### Influencers

- **Prevention science researchers**: Academics at universities including the University of Washington (Social Development Research Group), Penn State (Prevention Research Center), Iowa State, and University of Colorado who develop, test, and advocate for evidence-based programs
- **E-cigarette and tobacco industry**: Companies including JUUL (now restructured), Reynolds American, Altria, and numerous disposable vape manufacturers who market products that drive adolescent nicotine use; collectively spend $8.6 billion/year on marketing (FTC, 2023)
- **Social media companies**: Meta (Instagram, Facebook), Snap (Snapchat), ByteDance (TikTok), and Alphabet (YouTube) whose platforms shape adolescent substance-related norms and have been used for illicit drug sales targeting youth
- **Pharmaceutical industry**: Companies that manufacture addiction treatment medications (buprenorphine, naltrexone) and whose marketing practices contributed to the opioid epidemic that now drives adolescent fentanyl exposure
- **Media and entertainment industry**: Television, film, music, and streaming platforms that portray substance use; alcohol and cannabis industry advertising that reaches adolescents despite age restrictions

## Stakeholder Interests and Alignment

### Aligned Interests (Potential Coalition Partners)

| Coalition | Shared Interest | Strength |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Prevention scientists + SAMHSA/CSAP + Blueprints | Scaling evidence-based programs nationwide | Strong -- shared evidence framework and policy goals |
| Parents + schools + pediatricians | Protecting adolescent health; practical prevention tools | Strong -- aligned goals despite different capacities |
| Public health advocates + fiscal conservatives | Demonstrating prevention ROI to justify investment; reducing downstream treatment and enforcement costs | Moderate -- agreed on cost-effectiveness but different framing |
| Rural communities + Native communities + urban high-need areas | Targeted prevention resources for high-risk populations | Moderate -- shared needs but different contexts and political relationships |
| School counselors + mental health advocates + prevention advocates | Integrating prevention with school-based mental health services | Strong -- increasing recognition of co-occurring risks |

### Conflicting Interests

- **D.A.R.E./law enforcement vs. prevention scientists**: D.A.R.E.'s institutional survival depends on continued funding and school access, which evidence-based reform would redirect. Law enforcement organizations view school-based prevention roles as valuable community engagement, while researchers argue that uniformed officer delivery is less effective than trained educator delivery.
- **Tobacco/vaping industry vs. public health**: The e-cigarette industry profits from adolescent nicotine initiation (JUUL's growth was driven disproportionately by youth users). Public health advocates seek stricter regulation, flavor bans, and marketing restrictions that directly reduce industry revenue.
- **Local control advocates vs. evidence standards advocates**: School boards and state legislators who prioritize local curricular autonomy resist federal evidence requirements. Prevention scientists argue that public funds should only support programs with demonstrated effectiveness.
- **Abstinence-focused groups vs. harm reduction advocates**: Religious and conservative organizations insist that prevention messaging must promote complete abstinence from all substances. Harm reduction advocates argue that realistic risk information (including safer use messages for those who will experiment) is more effective and could save lives in the fentanyl era.

### The Prevention-Enforcement Triangle

A self-reinforcing dynamic connects law enforcement agencies, prevention program vendors, and school administrators:

- **Law enforcement** benefits from school-based prevention roles (D.A.R.E. officer positions, community engagement, overtime funding)
- **Prevention vendors** sell curricula and training to schools without outcome accountability
- **School administrators** satisfy parental and political demands for "doing something" with minimal effort

This triangle is sustained by the absence of outcome-based accountability. No party in this relationship has a strong incentive to evaluate whether prevention activities actually reduce substance use.

## Influence Mechanisms

How stakeholders exert influence on prevention policy:

- **Lobbying**: D.A.R.E. America and the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) lobby Congress to maintain D.A.R.E. funding. CADCA advocates for Drug-Free Communities appropriations. The Society for Prevention Research advocates for evidence-based funding requirements. The e-cigarette industry spends $5+ million annually on federal lobbying (OpenSecrets, 2024).
- **Campaign Contributions**: The tobacco/nicotine industry contributed $4.3 million to federal candidates in the 2024 election cycle (OpenSecrets, 2024). Law enforcement unions contribute significantly to state and local candidates who control school policies.
- **Expertise/Information Control**: Prevention scientists control the evidence base through peer-reviewed research and registries. D.A.R.E. and other legacy programs counter with parent satisfaction surveys and anecdotal testimony.
- **Public Advocacy**: Organizations like the Truth Initiative (anti-tobacco/vaping) and Parents Against Vaping E-cigarettes (PAVe) use media campaigns and grassroots organizing. The "One Pill Can Kill" campaign (DEA, launched 2021) targets fentanyl awareness among parents and youth.
- **Revolving Door**: Limited in prevention compared to other policy areas, but former ONDCP officials have joined advocacy organizations and consulting firms that advise on prevention policy.
