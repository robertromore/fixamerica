# Youth Drug Prevention

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of youth drug prevention policy in the United States, covering school-based programs, family interventions, community coalitions, and the evolving landscape of adolescent substance use.

## Overview

Youth drug prevention is one of the most broadly supported yet poorly executed areas of American drug policy. For decades, the dominant approach -- the D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) program -- consumed billions of dollars while rigorous evaluations consistently showed it had no meaningful effect on adolescent drug use. Meanwhile, evidence-based prevention programs developed through decades of research in developmental psychology and public health remain dramatically underfunded and underdeployed. Only about 10% of American schools implement prevention curricula with strong evidence of effectiveness.

The landscape of adolescent substance use has shifted dramatically since 2015. Traditional drug and alcohol use among teens has declined to historic lows, but the emergence of nicotine vaping, the proliferation of fentanyl-contaminated substances, and the influence of social media on substance-related norms have created new prevention challenges. Adolescent brain development research has fundamentally reshaped scientific understanding of why youth are uniquely vulnerable to substance use initiation and why early intervention is critical.

This analysis examines the science of youth drug prevention, the failure of legacy approaches, the evidence base for what works, and the policy reforms needed to align prevention spending with prevention science. It covers school-based interventions, family strengthening programs, community coalitions, digital-age challenges, and the legislative framework for a modern, evidence-based prevention system.
