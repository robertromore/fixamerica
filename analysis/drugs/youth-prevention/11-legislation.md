# Youth Drug Prevention: Legislation

## Overview

The legislative approach to youth drug prevention reform centers on two complementary strategies: (1) establishing federal evidence standards that require prevention funding to flow to programs with demonstrated effectiveness, and (2) substantially increasing prevention investment to scale evidence-based programs to reach the majority of American youth. The current legislative framework -- primarily ESSA Title IV-A and the Drug-Free Communities Act -- provides a foundation but lacks the evidence requirements and funding levels necessary for effective national prevention. Federal legislation is necessary because states and school districts will not voluntarily adopt evidence standards at scale, and the prevention funding gap cannot be closed through state action alone.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for youth drug prevention reform. The proposed legislation relies on Congress's spending power (Article I, Section 8) to condition federal education and prevention grants on evidence standards, a well-established constitutional mechanism upheld in numerous cases including South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203 (1987).*

119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To establish evidence-based standards for federally funded youth drug
prevention programs, to increase investment in prevention science and
infrastructure, and to protect American youth from emerging substance
threats including fentanyl.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Evidence-Based Youth Prevention Act
of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) According to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration (SAMHSA), 90 percent of adults with substance use
disorders began using substances before age 18.

(2) According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, every dollar
invested in evidence-based prevention programs yields an estimated
$18 in avoided healthcare, criminal justice, and lost productivity
costs.

(3) According to the RAND Corporation (2022), only approximately
10 percent of American schools implement drug prevention programs
rated as effective by independent evidence registries.

(4) The Monitoring the Future survey (2024) found that 30.3 percent
of 12th graders reported past-year use of any illicit drug, and
10.0 percent reported past-month nicotine vaping.

(5) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
approximately 1,800 adolescents ages 14-18 died of drug overdoses
in 2023, predominantly from fentanyl-contaminated substances.

(6) The Drug Enforcement Administration reports that 70 percent of
counterfeit pills seized contain a potentially lethal dose of
fentanyl.

(7) Multiple rigorous scientific evaluations, including a 2009
Cochrane systematic review, have found that the Drug Abuse
Resistance Education (D.A.R.E.) program in its original form had
no statistically significant effect on drug use, yet D.A.R.E. and
similar non-evidence-based programs continue to receive
substantial public funding.

(8) Evidence-based programs such as Life Skills Training, the
Strengthening Families Program, and Communities That Care have
demonstrated reductions in adolescent substance use of 25 to 50
percent in rigorous randomized controlled trials.

(9) The Federal Government currently allocates approximately 2.4
percent of the federal drug control budget to prevention, a level
fundamentally inadequate given the demonstrated return on investment
of evidence-based prevention.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

    outcomes on substance use or substance use risk factors; and
    (C) is rated as "Model" or "Promising" by the Blueprints
    for Healthy Youth Development registry, or receives an
    equivalent rating from a federally recognized evidence
    registry designated by the Secretary of Health and Human
    Services.

(2) EVIDENCE REGISTRY.—The term "evidence registry" means a
system for evaluating and rating prevention programs maintained

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 2 (Findings)**: Establishes the Congressional factual basis for action, citing specific data from SAMHSA, NIDA, RAND, CDC, DEA, and Monitoring the Future. These findings establish both the need for reform and the evidence base for the approach.
- **Section 4 (Evidence Standards)**: The core reform provision. Phases in evidence requirements over 3 years, recognizes multiple evidence registries, includes an innovation waiver for emerging threats and underserved populations, and establishes a Technical Assistance Center to support implementation.
- **Section 5 (Appropriations)**: Phases funding from $750 million to $1.5 billion over 5 years, with specified allocations for school-based, family-based, community, workforce, and research activities. State matching requirements leverage additional resources.
- **Section 6 (Workforce)**: Addresses the critical implementation gap by investing in prevention specialist certification, training, and recruitment, including loan forgiveness for underserved areas.
- **Section 7 (Fentanyl Education)**: Responds to the acute crisis of adolescent fentanyl deaths with mandatory education and naloxone access provisions. Structured as a condition of existing federal education funding rather than a new mandate.
- **Section 9 (Reporting)**: Ensures accountability through annual reporting and independent GAO evaluation.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Act takes effect | 180 days after enactment | N/A |
| SAMHSA publishes proposed evidence standards rules | 12 months after enactment | SAMHSA |
| 50% evidence-based funding compliance | Year 1 | States, school districts, coalitions |
| National Prevention Technical Assistance Center operational | 18 months after enactment | SAMHSA |
| Fentanyl awareness curricula available | 18 months after enactment | SAMHSA/CDC |
| 75% evidence-based funding compliance | Year 2 | States, school districts, coalitions |
| Prevention Workforce Development Initiative launches | Year 2 | SAMHSA/HRSA |
| 95% evidence-based funding compliance | Year 3 | States, school districts, coalitions |
| First GAO evaluation completed | Year 3 | GAO |
| Full appropriation ($1.5 billion) | Year 4 | Congress |

**Regulatory Authority**: SAMHSA's Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP) would administer evidence standards and technical assistance. NIDA would administer the Rapid Response Center. HRSA would administer workforce loan forgiveness. The Department of Education would oversee ESSA Title IV-A compliance with evidence standards.

**Challenges**:

- **Local control opposition**: School districts and state education agencies may resist federal evidence mandates as overreach
- **D.A.R.E. political constituency**: Congressional supporters of D.A.R.E. may oppose evidence standards that disadvantage the program
- **Appropriations uncertainty**: Authorizing $1.5 billion does not guarantee appropriation; annual funding fights are likely
- **Registry capacity**: Evidence registries may need expanded capacity to evaluate and rate programs at the pace required

**Refinements**:

- **Sunset clause for registries**: Require periodic review of evidence registry standards to prevent capture or stagnation
- **Cultural adaptation pathway**: Expand the innovation waiver to include a streamlined pathway for cultural adaptations of existing evidence-based programs
- **D.A.R.E. transition bridge**: Include specific technical assistance for D.A.R.E. programs transitioning to evidence-based delivery, recognizing the program's infrastructure and community relationships

## State Model Legislation

### Model Evidence-Based Prevention Education Act

**Purpose**: Require state-funded and state-administered prevention programs to meet evidence standards, complementing federal legislation and applicable to state prevention funding that does not flow through federal programs.

**Adaptability Notes**: States should customize evidence registry recognition based on state-level evaluation capacity. States with existing prevention infrastructure (Washington, Iowa, Colorado) can implement more rapidly. States with cannabis legalization should link cannabis tax revenue to prevention funding.

**Draft Text**:

```text

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: SAMHSA Center for Substance Abuse Prevention (CSAP)

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **Evidence Registry Standards Rule**: Define criteria for recognized evidence registries, establish the process for program rating and listing, and specify the innovation waiver process. Statutory deadline: 12 months after enactment.
2. **Prevention Grant Conditions Rule**: Update all SAMHSA prevention grant guidance to incorporate evidence standards, reporting requirements, and phase-in timelines. Statutory deadline: 12 months after enactment.
3. **Workforce Certification Standards Rule**: Establish national prevention specialist certification standards and loan forgiveness program criteria. Statutory deadline: 18 months after enactment.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Grant Conditions**: Non-compliant grantees would face reduction or termination of federal prevention grants. SAMHSA would provide a 1-year corrective action period before termination.
- **Reporting Requirements**: States, school districts, and coalitions would report annually on evidence-based program implementation rates and outcomes.
- **GAO Oversight**: Independent evaluation every 3 years with public reporting and Congressional testimony.
- **Private Right of Action**: Not included; enforcement is administrative through grant conditions.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Spending Clause Authority**: The legislation conditions federal education and prevention grants on evidence standards, using Congress's spending power under Article I, Section 8. This is well-established constitutional ground. The Supreme Court in *South Dakota v. Dole*, 483 U.S. 203 (1987), upheld conditions on federal highway funds (the 21 drinking age requirement), establishing that Congress may condition grants on state compliance with federal objectives provided the conditions are (1) related to the federal interest in the program, (2) unambiguous, and (3) not coercive. Evidence standards for prevention grants meet all three criteria.

**First Amendment Considerations**: The fentanyl education mandate could raise First Amendment compelled-speech concerns if framed as requiring specific government messaging. However, curriculum standards for schools receiving federal funds have been upheld as legitimate conditions of funding rather than compelled speech. The mandate specifies content areas, not specific viewpoints, and districts retain discretion over delivery methods.

**Tenth Amendment/Federalism**: The legislation does not mandate state action; it conditions federal funds on compliance with evidence standards. States and districts that decline federal prevention funds would not be subject to evidence requirements. This structure avoids the anti-commandeering doctrine concerns raised in *Printz v. United States*, 521 U.S. 898 (1997).

### Preemption

The legislation does not preempt state prevention laws or programs. States remain free to adopt more stringent evidence requirements or fund additional prevention activities. The federal evidence standard establishes a floor, not a ceiling. State model legislation is designed to complement, not be superseded by, federal law.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance is ensured through federal grant conditions administered by SAMHSA. The 3-year phase-in provides adequate transition time. The Technical Assistance Center and workforce development provisions reduce compliance barriers. The GAO evaluation provides independent accountability.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| Broad registry eligibility | Programs with minimal evidence could obtain "Promising" ratings from lenient registries, satisfying the standard without genuine effectiveness | High | Require that recognized registries use standards equivalent to Blueprints Tier 2 or higher; SAMHSA must approve registry methodology through rulemaking |
| Innovation waiver abuse | Communities could use the 5% innovation waiver to continue funding non-evidence-based legacy programs without genuine innovation | Medium | Require waiver applications to include a theory of change, evaluation design, and demonstration that the proposed program addresses a gap not covered by existing evidence-based options |
| Fidelity gap | Schools could adopt evidence-based programs in name but implement them poorly, satisfying the letter but not the spirit of the mandate | High | Require funded programs to include fidelity monitoring and reporting; establish minimum training requirements for program delivery staff |
| State matching manipulation | States could count existing spending as "matching" funds without providing additional resources | Medium | Define matching requirements to include only new or increased prevention spending above a baseline year |
| School-level compliance gaming | Districts could implement evidence-based programs in some schools while maintaining non-evidence-based programs in others | Low | Require district-wide compliance reporting showing that the percentage standard applies to all schools, not just aggregate spending |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| Authorization does not guarantee appropriation | Actual funding may fall short of $1.5 billion target | Congressional appropriations process is unpredictable | Build bipartisan support; identify offsets within existing drug enforcement spending; pursue mandatory rather than discretionary funding if possible |
| 3-year phase-in delays full implementation | Non-evidence-based programs continue receiving some federal funds for up to 3 years | Political necessity to avoid abrupt defunding of legacy programs | Phase-in is shortest feasible timeline; executive action can strengthen SAMHSA evidence guidance immediately |
| Limited enforcement for school-based fentanyl education | "Encouraged" naloxone provision (Sec. 7(d)) lacks mandate | Political sensitivity about requiring controlled substances in schools | Strengthen to "shall" in future amendments; fund naloxone directly through SAMHSA grants |
| No direct regulation of social media platforms | Legislation does not address social media drug marketing or sales to minors | Requires separate legislation addressing Section 230 and platform liability | Cross-reference with technology policy reform; support companion legislation on platform accountability |
| Workforce development timeline | 10,000 additional prevention specialists takes 3-5 years to train and deploy | Training pipeline constraints; recruitment challenges in rural areas | Begin workforce development in Phase 1 using executive authority; increase loan forgiveness incentives |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Strengthen registry standards**: After initial implementation, SAMHSA should conduct a review of evidence registry quality and, if necessary, narrow the definition of recognized registries to ensure only programs with genuine evidence of effectiveness qualify.
2. **Add fidelity requirements through rulemaking**: SAMHSA should issue regulations requiring funded programs to demonstrate implementation fidelity through standardized monitoring, with fidelity data reported annually.
3. **Convert fentanyl education naloxone provision from "encouraged" to "required"**: In a future amendment, require schools receiving fentanyl education funds to maintain naloxone accessible to trained staff.
4. **Index appropriations to inflation**: Amend the authorization to include automatic inflation adjustment, preventing the erosion of purchasing power that has affected existing prevention funding.
5. **Expand evidence infrastructure**: Fund expansion of the Blueprints registry and other recognized registries to evaluate programs more rapidly, particularly culturally specific and digital prevention interventions.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

The Act includes a GAO evaluation every 3 years (Section 9(c)). The authorization expires after 5 years (FY2031), requiring reauthorization and providing an opportunity for legislative refinement based on implementation experience. The reauthorization should evaluate whether the 95% evidence-based target has been achieved, whether the evidence standard has effectively improved adolescent substance use outcomes, and whether the appropriation level is adequate.
