# Youth Drug Prevention: What You Can Do

Youth drug prevention is an area where individual, community, and political action can have outsized impact. Because the current system wastes billions on ineffective programs while proven alternatives are underdeployed, informed advocacy can redirect resources toward approaches that actually protect young people. The fentanyl crisis has created urgent bipartisan motivation for reform that citizens can leverage.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- Read the Monitoring the Future annual survey results (released each January at <https://monitoringthefuture.org>) to understand current adolescent substance use trends
- Follow the Blueprints for Healthy Youth Development registry (<https://www.blueprintsprograms.org>) to understand which prevention programs have strong evidence
- Read NIDA's "Principles of Substance Abuse Prevention for Early Childhood" and "Preventing Drug Use Among Children and Adolescents" research-based guides (<https://nida.nih.gov/research-topics/prevention>)
- Subscribe to the Society for Prevention Research newsletter for updates on prevention science (<https://www.preventionresearch.org>)

### Make Personal Changes

- **If you are a parent**: Learn about evidence-based family communication strategies. The Strengthening Families Program and the "Parents Who Host Lose the Most" campaign provide practical tools for discussing substance use with children
- **Talk early and honestly**: Research shows that parent-child conversations about drugs are most effective when they begin before age 10, are ongoing rather than one-time events, and acknowledge the reality of peer pressure while building refusal skills
- **Monitor without micromanaging**: Parental monitoring (knowing where your child is, who they are with, and what they are doing) is one of the strongest protective factors against adolescent substance use (SAMHSA, 2023)
- **Secure medications**: Store prescription medications securely and dispose of unused medications through DEA Take Back events or pharmacy disposal programs. Prescription drug diversion from family medicine cabinets remains a pathway to adolescent opioid use
- **Discuss fentanyl risks explicitly**: Ensure your adolescent knows that any pill not prescribed by their doctor may contain lethal fentanyl, including pills that look like legitimate pharmaceuticals

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact Your Representatives**: Urge them to support increased funding for evidence-based prevention and evidence standards for federal prevention grants
- **Submit Public Comments**: When SAMHSA, FDA, or the Department of Education issue proposed rules related to prevention programming, submit comments supporting evidence-based requirements
- **Write Letters to the Editor**: When local media covers youth substance use, emphasize the importance of evidence-based prevention and the failure of legacy programs
- **Share Information**: Share the evidence on D.A.R.E.'s historical ineffectiveness and the availability of proven alternatives through school parent networks and social media

---

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- **Attend school board meetings**: Ask your school district what prevention curriculum it uses and whether it is rated as effective by the Blueprints registry or SAMHSA. If the district uses D.A.R.E. or another non-evidence-based program, request a transition to an evidence-based alternative
- **Form a parent prevention coalition**: Connect with other parents interested in evidence-based prevention. Organizations like the Partnership to End Addiction (<https://drugfree.org>) provide resources for parent-led action
- **Support or start a Drug-Free Community coalition**: If your community has a DFC coalition, volunteer. If it does not, explore applying for an ONDCP Drug-Free Communities grant (<https://www.cadca.org>)
- **Advocate for naloxone in schools**: Request that your school district equip school nurses with naloxone and implement fentanyl awareness education. The National Association of School Nurses provides implementation guidance

### Build Coalitions

- Connect evidence-based prevention advocates with fiscal conservatives who support accountability for public spending
- Partner with local pediatricians and family physicians to advocate for universal adolescent SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment)
- Engage faith communities, which often support youth protection goals even when they differ on specific prevention approaches
- Reach out to local law enforcement leaders who may support transition from D.A.R.E. to evidence-based programs while maintaining community engagement roles

## Political Actions

### Contact Elected Officials

**When to Contact**:

- During appropriations season (February-September) when prevention funding levels are set
- When prevention-related legislation is introduced or moving through committee
- After incidents of adolescent overdose deaths in your community
- When your school district is selecting or reviewing prevention curricula

**What to Say - Template Email**:

```
Subject: Support Evidence-Based Youth Drug Prevention Funding

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

I am a constituent from [City], and I am writing about youth drug
prevention. As a [parent/educator/health professional/concerned citizen],
I believe our children deserve prevention programs that actually work.

Research consistently shows that programs like Life Skills Training, the
Strengthening Families Program, and Communities That Care reduce
adolescent substance use by 25-50%. Yet only about 10% of American
schools implement evidence-based prevention programs. Meanwhile, the
federal government spends less than 3% of the drug control budget on
prevention, and much of that funding goes to programs with no evidence
of effectiveness.

With adolescent overdose deaths driven by fentanyl contamination,
effective prevention has never been more urgent. I urge you to:

1. Support increased appropriations for evidence-based youth prevention
2. Require that federal prevention funds flow to programs with
   demonstrated effectiveness
3. Support fentanyl awareness education in all schools

Every dollar invested in evidence-based prevention returns $18 in
avoided future costs. This is smart fiscal policy and lifesaving
public health policy.

Thank you for your service and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say - Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City]. I'm
calling about youth drug prevention funding. I'd like the
[Representative/Senator] to support evidence-based prevention programs
and increased funding for proven approaches like Life Skills Training
and Communities That Care. Only 10% of schools use programs that
actually work, and adolescent fentanyl deaths make reform urgent.
Can you please note my position? Thank you."
```

### Support Legislation

Current or proposed legislation to support:

- **Evidence-Based Youth Prevention Act** (proposed): Would establish federal evidence standards for all prevention funding and increase appropriations -- contact your representatives to encourage introduction and co-sponsorship
- **ESSA Title IV-A Strengthening**: Advocate for strengthened evidence requirements and protected prevention funding within the next ESSA reauthorization
- **Drug-Free Communities Act Reauthorization**: Support expanded authorization and appropriation when the DFC Act comes up for reauthorization
- **SBIRT Coverage Act** (proposed): Would require all insurers to cover adolescent substance use screening

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "What is your position on requiring evidence-based standards for federally funded youth drug prevention programs?"
2. "Do you support increasing federal prevention funding from the current ~$494 million to at least $1.5 billion annually?"
3. "How would you address fentanyl awareness education for adolescents in schools?"
4. "Do you support transitioning from legacy prevention programs like D.A.R.E. to programs with demonstrated effectiveness?"

**Voting Considerations**:

- Look for candidates who distinguish between prevention programs that are popular and programs that are effective
- Support candidates who commit to evidence-based spending accountability, regardless of party
- Key committees: Senate HELP Committee, House Energy and Commerce Committee, and Appropriations subcommittees for Labor-HHS-Education and Commerce-Justice-Science

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing youth drug prevention with others, emphasize:

1. **The evidence gap**: "Only about 10% of American schools use drug prevention programs that research shows actually work. We're spending billions on programs that feel good but don't reduce drug use."
2. **The return on investment**: "Every dollar invested in evidence-based prevention returns $18 in avoided healthcare, criminal justice, and productivity costs. This is one of the best investments in public policy."
3. **The fentanyl urgency**: "Adolescent overdose deaths more than doubled between 2019 and 2022 because of fentanyl-contaminated pills. Our kids need prevention education that addresses this lethal threat, not curricula designed for the 1980s."

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "D.A.R.E. works -- my kids went through it and they're fine" | Multiple rigorous studies including a 10-year follow-up found D.A.R.E. had no statistically significant effect on drug use. Individual outcomes cannot be attributed to the program. | Lynam et al., 1999; Cochrane Review, 2009 |
| "Scare tactics keep kids off drugs" | Research shows that fear-based approaches have minimal effect on behavior and may reduce program credibility with adolescents who observe that scare claims are exaggerated | Faggiano et al., 2014; Cochrane Review |
| "Drug testing in schools prevents drug use" | The most rigorous study (NIDA-funded RCT, 2003) found no significant deterrent effect. The AAP and APHA oppose school-based random drug testing. | Yamaguchi et al., 2003; AAP Policy, 2015 |
| "Teaching kids about drug risks normalizes drug use" | Evidence-based programs that discuss risks realistically reduce substance use more effectively than abstinence-only approaches. Information is not permission. | Faggiano et al., 2014 |
| "Prevention is less important than enforcement" | The federal government spends ~57% of the drug budget on enforcement and ~2.4% on prevention. Evidence shows prevention generates far higher returns per dollar. | ONDCP, 2024; RAND, 2022 |
