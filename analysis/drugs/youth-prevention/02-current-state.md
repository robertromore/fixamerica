# Youth Drug Prevention: Current State

## Adolescent Substance Use Trends

The overall trajectory of adolescent substance use in the United States represents a paradox: most traditional substances are at or near historic lows, yet emerging threats -- particularly nicotine vaping and fentanyl-contaminated drugs -- have created new and potentially more dangerous patterns.

### Monitoring the Future Survey Data (2024)

The Monitoring the Future (MTF) study, conducted annually by the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research since 1975 and funded by NIDA, is the primary national surveillance system for adolescent substance use. The 2024 survey included approximately 24,100 students across 8th, 10th, and 12th grades in 235 public and private schools.

| Substance | 8th Grade (Past-Month) | 10th Grade (Past-Month) | 12th Grade (Past-Month) | 5-Year Trend | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Alcohol | 7.3% | 16.6% | 26.4% | Declining | MTF, 2025 |
| Marijuana | 4.8% | 12.1% | 20.4% | Stable/Declining | MTF, 2025 |
| Nicotine vaping | 4.6% | 8.1% | 10.0% | Declining from 2019 peak | MTF, 2025 |
| Cigarettes | 1.1% | 1.6% | 2.2% | Historic low | MTF, 2025 |
| Any illicit drug (past year) | 8.4% | 14.8% | 30.3% | Stable | MTF, 2025 |
| Binge drinking (past 2 weeks) | 2.8% | 6.4% | 11.4% | Declining | MTF, 2025 |

### Nicotine Vaping: The Defining Challenge of the 2020s

Nicotine vaping among adolescents represents the most significant shift in youth substance use patterns in decades. After explosive growth from 2017 to 2019, rates have declined but remain elevated.

| Year | 12th Grade Past-Month Vaping (Nicotine) | Source |
|---|---|---|
| 2017 | 11.0% | MTF, 2018 |
| 2018 | 20.9% | MTF, 2019 |
| 2019 | 25.5% (peak) | MTF, 2020 |
| 2020 | 16.4% (COVID-19 disruption) | MTF, 2021 |
| 2021 | 19.6% | MTF, 2022 |
| 2022 | 14.1% | MTF, 2023 |
| 2023 | 12.4% | MTF, 2024 |
| 2024 | 10.0% | MTF, 2025 |

The decline from the 2019 peak reflects a combination of FDA enforcement actions against flavored cartridge-based products (particularly JUUL), the Tobacco 21 law (effective December 2019), COVID-19 school closures, and increased awareness. However, 10.0% past-month vaping among 12th graders still represents approximately 360,000 high school seniors using nicotine vaping products monthly.

### The Fentanyl Threat to Adolescents

While overall adolescent drug use has declined, the lethality of the drug supply has increased dramatically due to fentanyl contamination. Adolescent overdose deaths, though a small share of total overdose mortality, have risen sharply.

| Metric | Value | Trend | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Adolescent overdose deaths (ages 14-18, 2023) | ~1,800 | Down 20% from 2022 peak | CDC WONDER, 2024 |
| Adolescent overdose deaths (ages 14-18, 2021) | ~1,146 | Doubled from 2019 | CDC WONDER, 2023 |
| Counterfeit pills containing fentanyl seized by DEA (2023) | 79.3 million | Up 50% from 2022 | DEA, 2024 |
| Percentage of counterfeit pills containing lethal dose of fentanyl | 70% | Stable | DEA, 2024 |

The critical distinction is that adolescents are not dying because they are using drugs more frequently; they are dying because the drugs available are more lethal. Many adolescent fentanyl deaths involve counterfeit pills purchased through social media platforms, with victims unaware they were consuming fentanyl.

### Substance Use by Demographics

Significant disparities exist in adolescent substance use patterns across demographic groups:

| Population | Key Finding | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Native American/Alaska Native youth | Highest rates of substance use across all categories; 2.5x national average for past-year illicit drug use | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2023 |
| LGBTQ+ youth | 2-3x higher rates of substance use compared to heterosexual/cisgender peers | CDC YRBS, 2023 |
| Rural adolescents | Higher rates of methamphetamine use; comparable alcohol and marijuana rates to urban peers | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2023 |
| Black adolescents | Lower rates of alcohol and tobacco use; comparable marijuana use to white peers | MTF, 2025 |
| Hispanic adolescents | Higher rates of early alcohol initiation; comparable rates of other substance use | MTF, 2025 |

## Federal Prevention Infrastructure

### Funding Overview

Federal investment in youth drug prevention is distributed across multiple agencies and programs, with SAMHSA and ONDCP serving as primary conduits.

| Program | FY2025 Funding | Administering Agency | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| SAMHSA Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant (prevention set-aside) | $235 million | SAMHSA/CSAP | 20% of SAPT block grant reserved for prevention activities |
| Drug-Free Communities (DFC) Support Program | $110 million | ONDCP | Grants of up to $125,000/year for community anti-drug coalitions |
| SAMHSA Strategic Prevention Framework | $117 million | SAMHSA/CSAP | State-level prevention system development |
| CDC Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance | $7 million | CDC | Biennial school-based survey on health risk behaviors |
| National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign | $25 million | ONDCP | Public service advertising targeting youth and parents |
| Department of Education Safe and Drug-Free Schools | $0 (defunded 2010) | N/A | Previously largest federal school-based prevention program |
| **Total federal prevention-specific funding** | **~$494 million** | | |

### The Prevention Funding Gap

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Federal drug control budget (FY2025) | $46.1 billion | ONDCP, 2024 |
| Prevention share of federal drug control budget | ~2.4% ($1.1 billion including indirect) | ONDCP, 2024 |
| Treatment share | ~41% | ONDCP, 2024 |
| Law enforcement and interdiction share | ~57% | ONDCP, 2024 |
| Estimated cost of universal evidence-based school prevention | $3-5 billion annually | RAND Corporation, 2022 |
| Current federal prevention-specific spending | ~$494 million | Multiple agencies, 2024 |

The United States spends approximately 50 times more on drug enforcement than on youth prevention. Even within the demand reduction budget, prevention receives a small fraction compared to treatment -- despite evidence that prevention generates higher returns on investment.

## Program Implementation

### Evidence-Based Program Adoption

The gap between prevention science and prevention practice is the central challenge in the field. Despite decades of research identifying effective programs, adoption rates remain low.

| Implementation Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Schools using any prevention curriculum | ~65% | National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, 2023 |
| Schools using evidence-based prevention programs | ~10% | RAND Corporation, 2022 |
| Schools using D.A.R.E. or similar non-evidence-based programs | ~35% | RAND Corporation, 2022 |
| Schools with no structured prevention programming | ~35% | National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse, 2023 |
| Drug-Free Communities coalitions operating nationwide | ~700 | ONDCP, 2024 |
| Communities using Communities That Care model | ~500 | Social Development Research Group, 2023 |

### Evidence-Based Programs: Key Examples

| Program | Target | Setting | Evidence Rating | Effect Size | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Life Skills Training (LST) | Grades 6-9 | School | Blueprints Model Plus | 25-50% reduction in drug use | Botvin et al., 2023 |
| Strengthening Families Program (SFP 10-14) | Ages 10-14 | Family/Community | Blueprints Model | 30% reduction in substance initiation | Spoth et al., 2023 |
| Good Behavior Game (GBG) | Grades 1-2 | School | Blueprints Model | 50% reduction in drug use at age 19-21 | Kellam et al., 2008 |
| Communities That Care (CTC) | Community-wide | Community | Blueprints Model | 25-33% reduction in delinquency and drug use | Hawkins et al., 2014 |
| PROSPER | Community-wide | School + Family | Blueprints Promising | 10-20% reduction in substance initiation | Spoth et al., 2017 |
| PAX Good Behavior Game | Grades K-5 | School | SAMHSA NREPP | Significant reductions in conduct problems and later substance use | Embry, 2023 |

### D.A.R.E.: Legacy and Current Status

D.A.R.E. remains the most widely recognized prevention brand in the United States, though it has undergone significant changes since its evidence failures were documented.

| D.A.R.E. Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Communities with active D.A.R.E. programs | ~6,500 | D.A.R.E. America, 2024 |
| Countries with D.A.R.E. programs | 52 | D.A.R.E. America, 2024 |
| Annual cost estimate (all D.A.R.E. programs, U.S.) | ~$700 million (local + federal) | GAO estimate, 2023 |
| Current curriculum | "keepin' it REAL" (adopted 2012) | D.A.R.E. America |
| "keepin' it REAL" evidence rating | SAMHSA NREPP listed, moderate evidence | SAMHSA, 2023 |

D.A.R.E. replaced its original curriculum in 2012 with "keepin' it REAL," a program developed by researchers at Arizona State University with moderate evidence of effectiveness. However, fidelity of implementation varies widely, and the program remains largely delivered by uniformed police officers -- a delivery model that research suggests is less effective than delivery by trained teachers or prevention specialists.

## Regulatory and Legal Framework

### Key Laws and Regulations

| Law/Regulation | Year | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act** | 1986 | Required schools receiving federal funds to implement drug prevention programs; no evidence standards |
| **Anti-Drug Abuse Act** | 1988 | Created ONDCP and expanded prevention funding |
| **Drug-Free Communities Act** | 1997 | Established community coalition grant program administered by ONDCP |
| **No Child Left Behind Act (Title IV)** | 2001 | Required "scientifically based" prevention programs; defunded in 2010 |
| **Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA, Title IV-A)** | 2015 | Restored some prevention funding; requires "evidence-based" activities but definition is broad |
| **Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act** | 2009 | Gave FDA authority to regulate tobacco products, later extended to e-cigarettes |
| **Tobacco 21 (T21)** | 2019 | Raised federal minimum age for tobacco/nicotine products from 18 to 21 |
| **SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act** | 2018 | Expanded prevention provisions within broader opioid legislation |

### ESSA Title IV-A: The Current School Prevention Framework

The Every Student Succeeds Act provides the primary current mechanism for federal prevention funding in schools. Title IV-A (Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grants) authorizes funds for "safe and healthy students" activities, including drug prevention. However, the program is structured as a flexible block grant, and districts are not required to spend any specific amount on prevention. In FY2024, Title IV-A was funded at $1.29 billion, but substance abuse prevention competes with school safety, mental health, arts education, and educational technology for these funds.

## Geographic Variation

Prevention implementation and adolescent substance use patterns vary significantly by state:

| State/Region | Key Characteristic | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Iowa, Pennsylvania | State-level PROSPER prevention infrastructure reaching multiple communities | Spoth et al., 2023 |
| Washington State | Birthplace of Communities That Care; most extensive CTC implementation | Social Development Research Group, 2023 |
| Colorado | Post-legalization prevention funded by marijuana tax revenue ($10 million/year) | CO Dept. of Revenue, 2024 |
| West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky | Highest adolescent overdose death rates; Appalachian opioid crisis | CDC WONDER, 2024 |
| Native American reservations | Most limited prevention infrastructure; highest adolescent substance use rates | IHS, 2023 |

## Recent Trends

### Positive Developments (2019-2024)

- Adolescent cigarette smoking has declined to historic lows (2.2% past-month among 12th graders, down from 36.5% in 1997)
- Adolescent nicotine vaping has declined from its 2019 peak of 25.5% to 10.0% among 12th graders
- Adolescent alcohol use continues its long-term decline (26.4% past-month among 12th graders, down from 52.7% in 1997)
- Several states have directed cannabis tax revenue toward evidence-based prevention
- The Tobacco 21 law has reduced adolescent access to nicotine products

### Concerning Developments (2019-2024)

- Adolescent overdose deaths surged from ~600 (2019) to ~2,250 (2022) before declining to ~1,800 (2023), driven by fentanyl contamination
- Social media platforms (Snapchat, Instagram, TikTok) have become drug distribution channels, with adolescents purchasing counterfeit pills online
- Youth mental health crisis (43% of high school students reporting persistent sadness/hopelessness in 2023, per CDC YRBS) increases substance use vulnerability
- Federal prevention funding has remained flat in real terms for over a decade while enforcement spending has increased
- The defunding of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools program in 2010 was never replaced with an equivalent evidence-based alternative

## Emerging Challenges

### Social Media and Drug Normalization

Social media platforms present unprecedented challenges for youth prevention. Adolescents encounter substance-related content through algorithmic promotion, influencer marketing (particularly for alcohol and cannabis brands), and peer-to-peer communication that normalizes use. DEA and CDC investigations have documented numerous adolescent fentanyl deaths linked to pills purchased through Snapchat, Instagram, and other platforms. Prevention programs developed before the smartphone era lack frameworks for addressing these digital-age risks.

### Novel Psychoactive Substances

The rapid proliferation of novel psychoactive substances -- including synthetic cannabinoids, designer benzodiazepines, and emerging hallucinogens -- outpaces prevention messaging and regulatory responses. Adolescents may encounter substances with unknown risk profiles before prevention curricula can address them.

### Cannabis Legalization and Youth Messaging

As more states legalize recreational cannabis, prevention programs face the challenge of maintaining credible anti-use messaging for adolescents within a legal framework that permits adult use. Research from Colorado, Washington, and Oregon provides early evidence on post-legalization adolescent use trends, but the messaging challenge remains unresolved.

### Integration with Mental Health

The adolescent mental health crisis and substance use vulnerability are deeply intertwined. Prevention programs increasingly need to address co-occurring mental health and substance use risks, requiring integration with school-based mental health services that are themselves severely underfunded.
