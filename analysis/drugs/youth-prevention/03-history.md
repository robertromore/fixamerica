# Youth Drug Prevention: History

## Historical Development

Youth drug prevention in the United States has evolved through distinct phases, each reflecting broader cultural attitudes toward drugs, scientific understanding of adolescent development, and political dynamics. The history is marked by a recurring pattern: well-intentioned programs gain political support before scientific evidence can confirm their effectiveness, then persist long after research demonstrates their failure.

### The Temperance and Moral Education Era (1880s-1960s): Prevention as Character Building

- **Scientific Temperance Instruction**: Beginning in the 1880s, the Women's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) successfully lobbied every state to mandate "Scientific Temperance Instruction" in public schools. By 1902, all states required some form of alcohol and drug education. The curriculum was moralistic rather than scientific, emphasizing the degradation caused by alcohol and drugs with vivid, often exaggerated descriptions of physical harm.
- **Fear-Based Messaging**: Early prevention relied on scare tactics -- films like *Reefer Madness* (1936) depicted marijuana as causing insanity, violence, and death. While culturally influential, this approach had no grounding in behavioral science and set a pattern of prevention messaging that prioritized emotional impact over accuracy.
- **Limited Federal Role**: Drug education was almost entirely a state and local function. The federal government's primary drug policy apparatus (the Federal Bureau of Narcotics, established 1930) focused exclusively on enforcement, not prevention.
- **Emerging Youth Drug Culture**: The post-World War II era saw the first modern moral panics about youth drug use, initially focused on heroin in urban communities and later on marijuana associated with the Beat Generation. Prevention remained moralistic and disconnected from emerging behavioral science.

### The War on Drugs and the Birth of Modern Prevention (1970s-1980s): "Just Say No"

- **Nixon and the Controlled Substances Act (1970)**: President Nixon's declaration of the War on Drugs in 1971 fundamentally shaped the prevention landscape. While Nixon actually invested significantly in treatment, the rhetorical framing positioned drug use as a threat requiring government mobilization -- including in schools.
- **Affective Education Movement (1970s)**: The first wave of "modern" prevention moved beyond scare tactics to focus on self-esteem, values clarification, and decision-making skills. Programs like "Here's Looking at You" assumed that improving adolescents' self-concept would reduce drug use. Research eventually showed that affective approaches alone were no more effective than scare tactics at reducing substance use (Tobler, 1986).
- **The Rise of D.A.R.E. (1983)**: The Drug Abuse Resistance Education program was created in 1983 by the Los Angeles Police Department and the Los Angeles Unified School District. D.A.R.E. placed uniformed police officers in elementary school classrooms to deliver a 17-week curriculum emphasizing drug refusal skills, self-esteem, and decision-making. The program rapidly became the most widely implemented prevention program in American history.
- **"Just Say No" Campaign (1982-1989)**: First Lady Nancy Reagan's "Just Say No" campaign became the defining prevention slogan of the 1980s. The campaign simplified drug prevention to a single act of individual willpower, aligning with conservative emphasis on personal responsibility but ignoring the social, environmental, and developmental factors that drive adolescent substance use.
- **Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act (1986)**: This legislation required all school districts receiving federal funds to implement drug prevention programs. However, the law imposed no evidence requirements, enabling districts to adopt whatever programs they chose regardless of effectiveness. Federal prevention funding surged from $3 million in 1981 to $660 million by 1992.
- **Anti-Drug Abuse Act (1988)**: Created the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) and expanded federal prevention funding. The law reinforced the punitive framework by coupling prevention with enforcement in a single legislative package.

### The Evidence Crisis and D.A.R.E. Backlash (1990s-2000s): Science Challenges Politics

- **First Rigorous Evaluations (1990s)**: As prevention science matured, researchers began conducting randomized controlled trials of prevention programs. The findings were devastating for the status quo. A 1994 study by Ennett et al. in the *American Journal of Public Health* was among the first to find that D.A.R.E. had no significant effect on drug use. Subsequent studies by Lynam et al. (1999) and others confirmed the finding.
- **The Surgeon General's Report (2001)**: The U.S. Surgeon General's report on youth violence explicitly listed D.A.R.E. among programs that "do not work" for preventing substance use. This was the highest-profile federal acknowledgment of D.A.R.E.'s ineffectiveness, though it prompted limited policy change.
- **Emergence of Evidence-Based Programs**: Simultaneously, researchers developed and tested programs that actually worked. Gilbert Botvin's Life Skills Training (developed in the 1980s, validated through multiple trials in the 1990s) demonstrated 25-50% reductions in substance use by teaching social skills, resistance skills, and personal self-management. The Strengthening Families Program, Good Behavior Game, and Communities That Care model also accumulated strong evidence bases during this period.
- **Safe and Drug-Free Schools Controversies**: The Department of Education's Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities program (authorized under the 1994 reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act) was the primary federal conduit for school-based prevention funding. A 2002 Department of Education report found that only a small fraction of funded activities met basic evidence criteria, describing the program as "ineffective" in its current form.
- **GAO Critiques**: The Government Accountability Office issued multiple reports in the late 1990s and early 2000s criticizing federal prevention spending for lack of evidence standards and accountability. A 2003 GAO report on D.A.R.E. specifically concluded that the program had no detectable impact on drug use.
- **D.A.R.E.'s Political Resilience**: Despite mounting scientific evidence, D.A.R.E. retained strong political support. In 2001, Congress specifically restored D.A.R.E. funding that the Clinton administration had attempted to cut. The program's popularity with parents, police departments, and local officials created a political constituency that insulated it from evidence-based reform.

### The Evidence-Based Movement and Federal Reform (2005-2015): Partial Progress

- **SAMHSA's National Registry of Evidence-based Programs and Practices (NREPP)**: Launched in 2005, NREPP created a federal system for rating prevention programs based on research quality and outcomes. This provided school districts and community organizations with a tool for identifying effective programs, though use was voluntary.
- **Defunding of Safe and Drug-Free Schools (2010)**: The Obama administration proposed and Congress approved the elimination of the Safe and Drug-Free Schools state grant program in FY2010, based on evidence that the program was ineffective. While this removed a wasteful program, it also eliminated the largest dedicated federal funding stream for school-based prevention, and no equivalent evidence-based replacement was established.
- **ESSA Title IV-A (2015)**: The Every Student Succeeds Act created a new block grant (Title IV-A) that included prevention among eligible activities. The law required "evidence-based" practices but defined the term broadly, allowing programs with minimal evidence. Prevention funding was not protected within the block grant, forcing it to compete with other priorities.
- **Drug-Free Communities Program Expansion**: The DFC program, which funds community coalitions, expanded to support approximately 700 coalitions by 2015. Independent evaluations showed modest but consistent positive effects on community-level prevention.
- **Prevention Science Maturation**: The field of prevention science continued to develop, with long-term follow-up studies demonstrating that well-implemented programs in childhood could reduce substance use disorders and criminal behavior into adulthood. The Good Behavior Game trial showed that first-grade intervention reduced drug and alcohol abuse disorders by nearly 50% at ages 19-21 (Kellam et al., 2008).

### The Vaping Crisis, Fentanyl, and Digital Age (2015-Present): New Threats, Old Gaps

- **JUUL and the Youth Vaping Epidemic (2017-2019)**: The rapid adoption of JUUL and similar nicotine vaping products among adolescents caught prevention systems completely unprepared. JUUL's marketing -- which used social media influencers, youth-oriented aesthetic design, and flavors appealing to young people -- exposed a fundamental gap in prevention infrastructure. Schools had no curricula addressing vaping, and existing prevention programs focused on traditional substances.
- **FDA Regulatory Response**: The FDA declared youth vaping an "epidemic" in 2018 and took enforcement actions against flavored cartridge-based products. The agency restricted flavored products in 2020, contributing to the decline in youth vaping from its 2019 peak. However, disposable vape products largely evaded these restrictions.
- **Fentanyl and Adolescent Overdose Deaths (2020-present)**: The contamination of the illicit drug supply with fentanyl created an unprecedented threat to adolescents. Overdose deaths among 14-18 year-olds more than doubled between 2019 and 2022. Social media platforms became drug distribution channels, with counterfeit pills sold through Snapchat, Instagram, and encrypted messaging apps.
- **D.A.R.E. Curriculum Reform (2012-present)**: Under sustained criticism, D.A.R.E. adopted the "keepin' it REAL" curriculum in 2012, developed by researchers at Arizona State University. The new curriculum has moderate evidence of effectiveness but continues to be delivered primarily by uniformed police officers, and implementation fidelity varies widely.
- **COVID-19 Disruption (2020-2021)**: School closures disrupted prevention programming for nearly two school years. Adolescent substance use initially declined (likely due to reduced peer exposure), but mental health deteriorated dramatically, increasing long-term vulnerability. Prevention programs were slow to adapt to virtual delivery.
- **SAMHSA Prevention Budget Stagnation**: Despite the opioid and fentanyl crises, SAMHSA prevention funding has remained largely flat in real terms since 2010. The prevention set-aside within the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant remains at 20%, unchanged since 1992.

## Lessons from History

### Pattern 1: Political Popularity Trumps Scientific Evidence

The history of D.A.R.E. demonstrates that prevention programs can persist for decades despite strong evidence of ineffectiveness if they enjoy political support, institutional backing, and cultural resonance. D.A.R.E. survived because it was visible (uniformed officers in classrooms), emotionally satisfying (doing something about drugs), and backed by powerful constituencies (law enforcement, parent groups). The lesson is that evidence-based prevention must build its own political constituency, not merely publish research papers.

### Pattern 2: Federal Mandates Without Evidence Standards Waste Resources

Both the Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act (1986) and the Safe and Drug-Free Schools program allowed districts to implement any prevention programming regardless of evidence. The result was billions of dollars spent on programs that did not work. Effective federal prevention policy requires coupling funding with evidence standards and implementation quality requirements.

### Pattern 3: Prevention Infrastructure Lags Emerging Threats

The vaping epidemic caught prevention systems unprepared because existing curricula focused on traditional substances. The fentanyl crisis similarly outpaced prevention messaging. Prevention infrastructure must be adaptive, with mechanisms for rapid curriculum updates and responsive programming rather than static, multi-year development cycles.

### Pattern 4: Defunding Without Replacement Creates Voids

The elimination of Safe and Drug-Free Schools in 2010 removed an ineffective program but also eliminated the primary dedicated funding stream for school-based prevention. The resulting void was not filled by evidence-based alternatives at equivalent scale. Reformers must ensure that eliminating wasteful programs is paired with investment in effective replacements.
