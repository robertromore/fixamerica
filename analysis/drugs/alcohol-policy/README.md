# Alcohol Policy

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of U.S. alcohol policy, covering the regulatory framework governing the production, sale, marketing, and consumption of alcoholic beverages, as well as the public health consequences of alcohol use and the policy tools available to reduce alcohol-related harm.

## Overview

Alcohol is the most widely consumed psychoactive substance in the United States, used by approximately 133 million Americans aged 12 and older. It is also the third leading preventable cause of death, responsible for an estimated 178,000 deaths annually -- more than all illicit drug overdose deaths combined. Despite this toll, alcohol occupies a uniquely privileged position in American drug policy: legal, lightly taxed, heavily advertised, and culturally normalized in ways that no other substance approaches.

U.S. alcohol policy is shaped by the legacy of Prohibition (1920-1933), which created lasting institutional structures -- including the three-tier distribution system and state-level liquor control -- that persist today. The National Minimum Drinking Age Act of 1984 established 21 as the uniform drinking age, a policy credited with saving thousands of lives but also criticized for driving underage drinking underground. Federal and state excise taxes on alcohol have declined dramatically in real terms since the 1950s, weakening one of the most evidence-based tools for reducing consumption and harm.

This analysis examines the full spectrum of alcohol policy, including taxation, advertising regulation, DUI/DWI enforcement, the three-tier distribution system, treatment parity, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, and the alcohol industry's political influence. It explores how evidence-based reforms could reduce alcohol-related deaths, injuries, and social costs while respecting individual liberty and commercial interests.
