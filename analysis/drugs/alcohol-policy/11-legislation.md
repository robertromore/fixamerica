# Alcohol Policy: Legislation

## Overview

The legislative approach to alcohol policy reform is necessarily incremental and multi-jurisdictional. The Twenty-first Amendment grants states uniquely broad authority over alcohol regulation, making a purely federal approach insufficient. This legislation package therefore includes federal bills addressing taxation, DUI standards, and health labeling -- areas where federal authority is well-established -- alongside model state legislation for minimum unit pricing and outlet density regulation, where state authority is primary. The approach is regulatory rather than prohibitionist, using evidence-based tools (pricing, information, enforcement) to reduce harm without restricting legal access.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for this reform.* The Twenty-first Amendment already provides states with broad regulatory authority over alcohol, and existing federal powers under the Taxing and Spending Clause, Commerce Clause, and Spending Clause provide sufficient authority for the proposed federal legislation. The Supreme Court has upheld federal spending conditions on alcohol policy (e.g., *South Dakota v. Dole*, 483 U.S. 203 (1987)) and affirmed that the Twenty-first Amendment does not override core constitutional provisions including the Commerce Clause (*Granholm v. Heald*, 544 U.S. 460 (2005)).

## Federal Legislation

### The Alcohol Tax Modernization Act

**Purpose**: Restore the real value of federal alcohol excise taxes eroded by 33 years of inflation since the 1991 increase, and prevent future erosion by indexing all rates to the Consumer Price Index.

**Key Provisions**:

1. Increase federal excise tax rates on beer, wine, and spirits to restore 1991 purchasing power
2. Index all federal alcohol excise tax rates to the CPI-U, adjusted annually
3. Phase in increases over 3 years (one-third per year) to allow industry adjustment
4. Maintain reduced rates for qualifying small producers, proportionally adjusted
5. Earmark 25% of additional revenue for SAMHSA alcohol treatment and prevention programs

119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To modernize federal alcohol excise tax rates, index such rates to
inflation, and dedicate a portion of additional revenue to alcohol
treatment and prevention programs.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Alcohol Tax Modernization Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) Federal alcohol excise tax rates were last increased by the
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-508), effective
January 1, 1991.

(2) Since 1991, the Consumer Price Index has increased by approximately
112 percent, reducing the real value of federal alcohol excise taxes by
approximately 50 percent.

(3) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2024),
excessive alcohol use causes approximately 178,000 deaths annually in the
United States and costs the economy approximately $249 billion per year.

(4) A systematic review of 112 studies (Wagenaar et al., Addiction,
2009) found that higher alcohol prices are consistently associated with
reduced consumption, reduced heavy drinking, and reduced alcohol-related
mortality.

(5) The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that restoring alcohol
excise tax rates to their 1991 real value would generate $8 to $12
billion in additional annual federal revenue.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:

(1) CPI-U.--The term "CPI-U" means the Consumer Price Index for All
Urban Consumers published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

(2) BASE YEAR.--The term "base year" means calendar year 1991.

(3) ADJUSTMENT YEAR.--The term "adjustment year" means the first
calendar year beginning after the date of enactment of this Act,
and each calendar year thereafter.

SEC. 4. RESTORATION AND INDEXING OF BEER EXCISE TAX.

(a) IN GENERAL.--Section 5051(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986 is amended by striking "$18" and inserting "$36".

(b) SMALL BREWER RATE.--Section 5051(a)(2)(A) of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986 is amended by striking "$3.50" and inserting "$7.00".

    phased in as follows:
        (A) For the first calendar year beginning after the date of
        enactment, the rate shall be the sum of the prior rate plus
        one-third of the difference between the prior rate and the
        rate established under this section.
        (B) For the second such year, the rate shall be the sum of the
        prior rate plus two-thirds of such difference.
        (C) For the third such year and thereafter, the full rate
        established under this section shall apply.

(d) ANNUAL ADJUSTMENT.--Beginning in the fourth calendar year after
the date of enactment, and annually thereafter, the rates established
under this section shall be adjusted by the percentage change in the
CPI-U for the 12-month period ending on August 31 of the preceding
year, rounded to the nearest cent.

SEC. 5. RESTORATION AND INDEXING OF WINE EXCISE TAX.

(a) IN GENERAL.--Section 5041(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of
1986 is amended by striking "$1.07" and inserting "$2.15".

annual adjustment mechanism established under sections 4(c) and 4(d)
shall apply to the rate established under this section.

SEC. 7. ALCOHOL TREATMENT AND PREVENTION TRUST FUND.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.--There is hereby established in the Treasury of
the United States a trust fund to be known as the "Alcohol Treatment
and Prevention Trust Fund" (hereinafter "the Fund").

(b) TRANSFERS.--For each fiscal year beginning after the date of
enactment, there shall be transferred to the Fund an amount equal to
25 percent of the excess of alcohol excise tax revenue collected under
sections 5001, 5041, and 5051 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
over the revenue collected under such sections in fiscal year 2025.

(c) USE OF FUNDS.--Amounts in the Fund shall be available, without
further appropriation, to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration for--
    (1) grants to States for alcohol use disorder treatment programs;
    (2) community-based alcohol prevention programs;

    Treatment) implementation in primary care settings; and
    (4) alcohol treatment workforce development.

SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date that is 180 days after the
date of enactment of this Act.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4-6 (Rate Restoration)**: Doubles nominal rates to restore 1991 real values. The 3-year phase-in prevents price shock and allows businesses to adjust inventory and pricing.
- **Section 4(d) (CPI Indexing)**: Prevents future real-value erosion by linking rates to inflation. This is the single most important structural reform, as it eliminates the political barrier of periodic rate increases.
- **Section 7 (Trust Fund)**: Dedicates 25% of additional revenue to treatment and prevention, creating a self-reinforcing cycle: higher taxes reduce harm, and the revenue funds programs that further reduce harm. This earmarking also builds political support by linking the tax to a concrete benefit.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Enactment | Year 1 | Congress/President |
| First-year phase-in rate takes effect | 180 days after enactment | TTB/IRS |
| Second-year phase-in rate | 1 year + 180 days | TTB/IRS |
| Full rate effective | 2 years + 180 days | TTB/IRS |
| First CPI adjustment | Year 4 (October 1) | TTB/IRS |
| Trust Fund first disbursements | Year 2 | SAMHSA |

**Regulatory Authority**: TTB (collection and compliance); IRS (enforcement); SAMHSA (Trust Fund disbursement).

**Challenges**:

- **Industry opposition**: Beer, wine, and spirits trade associations will oppose aggressively. The NBWA, DISCUS, and Beer Institute collectively spend ~$15 million annually on lobbying.
- **Congressional tax aversion**: Any tax increase faces political headwinds, particularly in the House.
- **Small producer concerns**: Craft beverage industry will argue disproportionate impact despite proportional adjustment of reduced rates.

**Refinements**:

- **Revenue neutrality option**: Pair excise increase with income tax credit for moderate-income households ($250/household) to address regressivity
- **Small producer protection**: Cap phase-in increase for producers below 10,000 barrels/year at 50% of the standard increase

### The National 0.05% BAC Standard Act

**Purpose**: Reduce alcohol-impaired driving fatalities by incentivizing all states to adopt a 0.05% blood alcohol concentration standard for DUI, consistent with the scientific consensus and international practice.

**Key Provisions**:

1. Condition 5% of federal highway safety funding on state adoption of 0.05% BAC standard within 5 years
2. Require states to maintain zero-tolerance (0.00-0.02%) standards for drivers under 21
3. Authorize $50 million in grants for state law enforcement training on 0.05% enforcement
4. Require NHTSA to study and report on the impact within 3 years of adoption

**Draft Text**:

```text
119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To reduce alcohol-impaired driving fatalities by establishing a national
0.05 percent blood alcohol concentration standard through incentive
funding.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "National 0.05 BAC Standard Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) Alcohol-impaired driving killed 13,524 Americans in 2022,
accounting for 32 percent of all traffic fatalities (NHTSA FARS, 2023).

(2) The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine
recommended in 2018 that all states adopt a 0.05 percent BAC limit.

(3) Utah's adoption of a 0.05 percent BAC limit in 2018 produced a
19.8 percent reduction in alcohol-related fatal crashes (Thomas et al.,
American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 2022).

(4) More than 100 countries, including all European Union member states,
Australia, and most of Latin America, have adopted 0.05 percent or lower
BAC limits for standard drivers.

(5) Experimental studies consistently demonstrate significant impairment
in reaction time, judgment, and coordination at 0.05 percent BAC
(Moskowitz & Fiorentino, NHTSA, 2000).

SEC. 3. NATIONAL 0.05 BAC STANDARD.

(a) WITHHOLDING OF FUNDS.--Beginning in the fiscal year beginning 5
years after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of
Transportation shall withhold 5 percent of the amount required to be
apportioned to a State under section 402 of title 23, United States
Code, if the State has not enacted and is not enforcing a law that
provides that any person with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05
percent or greater while operating a motor vehicle in the State shall
be deemed to be driving under the influence of alcohol.

(b) ZERO TOLERANCE.--Nothing in this section shall be construed to
modify the requirement that States maintain zero-tolerance laws for
operators under 21 years of age.

(c) RESTORATION OF WITHHELD FUNDS.--Funds withheld under subsection
(a) shall be restored to the State upon certification by the Secretary
that the State has enacted and begun enforcing a compliant law.

SEC. 4. TRAINING GRANTS.

There are authorized to be appropriated $50,000,000 for each of fiscal
years 2027 through 2031 for grants to States to train law enforcement
officers and prosecutors in the enforcement of 0.05 percent BAC laws.

SEC. 5. IMPACT STUDY.

Not later than 3 years after the date on which the first State enacts
a 0.05 percent BAC law in response to this Act, and every 3 years
thereafter, the Administrator of NHTSA shall submit to Congress a
report evaluating the impact of 0.05 percent BAC laws on--
    (1) alcohol-related traffic fatalities;
    (2) alcohol-related traffic injuries;
    (3) DUI arrest rates;
    (4) alcohol consumption patterns; and
    (5) court and correctional system impacts.

SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date of enactment of this Act.
```

**Challenges**:

- **Hospitality industry opposition**: Restaurants and bars will argue reduced patronage
- **State sovereignty arguments**: Some states will resist federal conditions on highway funding
- **Enforcement capacity**: States must train law enforcement and update procedures

**Refinements**:

- **Graduated escalation**: Start with 3% funding reduction in Year 5, increasing to 5% in Year 7 and 8% in Year 9 for non-compliant states
- **Safe harbor for states with equivalent results**: Allow states demonstrating DUI fatality rates below the national median to qualify for an alternative compliance path

## State Model Legislation

### Model Minimum Unit Pricing Act

**Purpose**: Establish a floor price per unit of alcohol to target the cheapest, highest-strength products disproportionately consumed by heavy drinkers, following the evidence from Scotland (2018) and Ireland (2022).

**Adaptability Notes**: States should adjust the minimum price per unit based on local cost of living and existing tax rates. Control states may implement MUP through their wholesale pricing authority without new legislation. License states require statutory authorization.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "[State] Minimum
Unit Pricing for Alcohol Act of [Year]".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS.

The Legislature finds that:

(1) Cheap, high-strength alcoholic beverages are disproportionately
consumed by heavy drinkers and young people.

(2) Scotland's implementation of minimum unit pricing in 2018 produced
a 13 percent reduction in alcohol-attributable deaths over three years
(Public Health Scotland, 2023).

(3) Minimum unit pricing targets harmful drinking patterns while having
minimal impact on moderate drinkers.

SECTION 3. DEFINITIONS.

(a) "Unit of alcohol" means 8 grams of ethanol, equivalent to 10
milliliters of pure alcohol.

(b) "Minimum unit price" means the lowest price at which a unit of
alcohol may be sold to a consumer.

SECTION 4. MINIMUM UNIT PRICE.

(a) No person shall sell or offer for sale any alcoholic beverage at
a price below the minimum unit price multiplied by the number of units
of alcohol contained in the product.

(b) The minimum unit price shall be $0.75 per unit of alcohol.

(c) The [State Alcohol Control Board/Commissioner] shall adjust the
minimum unit price annually by the percentage change in the state
Consumer Price Index, effective January 1 of each year.

SECTION 5. ENFORCEMENT.

(a) Violation of Section 4 shall be punishable by a fine of not less
than $500 and not more than $5,000 per violation.

(b) Repeated violations (three or more within 12 months) shall be
grounds for license suspension.

SECTION 6. EVALUATION.

The [Department of Health] shall conduct and publish an evaluation of
the impact of this Act on alcohol consumption, alcohol-related
mortality, and alcohol-related emergency department visits within
three years of the effective date.

SECTION 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect 180 days after enactment.
```

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agencies**: TTB (labeling, taxation); FTC (advertising); NHTSA (DUI enforcement); SAMHSA (treatment); state alcohol control boards (distribution, access).

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **TTB Health Warning Label Update**: Rulemaking under 27 U.S.C. Section 215 to modernize the 1988 warning label. Must include cancer risk, caloric content, standard drink equivalents, and treatment referral number. Deadline: 18 months after enactment of enabling legislation.
2. **FTC Digital Advertising Standards**: Rulemaking under Section 5 FTC Act to establish enforceable standards for digital alcohol marketing, including age-verification requirements and audience composition thresholds. Deadline: 24 months.
3. **CMS SBIRT Reimbursement Enhancement**: Rulemaking to increase Medicare/Medicaid reimbursement rates for SBIRT in primary care settings. Deadline: 12 months.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Civil Penalties**: TTB may impose fines of $10,000-$100,000 per violation for labeling non-compliance; FTC may impose fines under Section 5 for advertising violations
- **Administrative Actions**: License suspension or revocation for retailers violating state laws; TTB permit revocation for producers violating labeling requirements
- **Private Right of Action**: None created by this legislation (enforcement is exclusively governmental)
- **Criminal Penalties**: Reserved for willful, repeated violations of tax provisions (existing IRS criminal penalties apply)

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Spending Clause Authority (0.05% BAC Incentive)**: The 0.05% BAC incentive legislation follows the model upheld in *South Dakota v. Dole*, 483 U.S. 203 (1987), where the Court upheld conditioning highway funds on MLDA 21 adoption. The conditions must be: (1) in pursuit of the general welfare; (2) unambiguous; (3) related to the federal interest in highway safety; and (4) not independently unconstitutional. The 0.05% BAC standard meets all four requirements. The 5% funding withholding is less than the 10% upheld in *Dole* and falls below the "coercion" threshold identified in *NFIB v. Sebelius*, 567 U.S. 519 (2012).

**Taxing Power (Excise Tax Modernization)**: Federal excise taxation of alcohol is well-established under Article I, Section 8, Clause 1. Excise tax rates are subject to rational-basis review and have never been successfully challenged.

**Commercial Speech (Advertising Regulation)**: Content-based restrictions on alcohol advertising must satisfy the four-part *Central Hudson* test. Placement restrictions (time, manner, place) and factual disclosure requirements face lower scrutiny under *Zauderer*. The FTC rulemaking should prioritize placement standards and disclosure requirements to minimize First Amendment vulnerability.

### Preemption

The Twenty-first Amendment complicates federal preemption analysis. Federal labeling and taxation requirements preempt conflicting state laws under the Supremacy Clause, but states retain authority to impose additional requirements under the Twenty-first Amendment. The proposed legislation includes savings clauses preserving state authority to adopt stricter standards.

### Enforcement and Compliance

TTB will conduct compliance inspections for labeling requirements. FTC will monitor digital advertising through annual audits and consumer complaint investigations. NHTSA will certify state compliance with the 0.05% BAC standard through annual reporting. Non-compliant states will receive notice and a 1-year cure period before funding withholding begins.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| Tax phase-in delay | Industry stockpiles inventory at lower rates before increases take effect | Medium | Include anti-stockpiling provision: tax assessed at rate in effect at time of retail sale, not production |
| CBMA small producer thresholds | Large producers create subsidiary entities to qualify for small producer rates | High | Apply controlled-group aggregation rules (similar to 26 U.S.C. Section 1563) to prevent entity splitting |
| MUP enforcement gaps | Retailers offer "buy one get one free" or other promotions that effectively price below MUP | Medium | Define "effective price" to include promotional discounts; prohibit below-MUP promotions |
| Digital advertising age-gating | Platforms use self-reported age data easily falsified by minors | High | Require third-party age verification technology (ID-based) for alcohol advertising on digital platforms |
| State non-compliance with 0.05% BAC | States adopt 0.05% nominally but fail to enforce through inadequate prosecution standards | Medium | Require annual NHTSA enforcement audits as condition of continued compliance certification |
| Warning label placement | Producers place warnings in illegible font or inconspicuous locations | Low | Specify minimum font size (12pt), contrast ratio, and front-label placement occupying 20% of label area |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| Excise tax regressivity | Lower-income consumers pay a larger share of income in alcohol taxes | Excise taxes are consumption-based, not income-based | Earmark revenue for treatment programs that disproportionately benefit lower-income populations; consider refundable tax credits |
| Federal-state fragmentation | No single authority coordinates alcohol policy across taxation, regulation, enforcement, and treatment | Twenty-first Amendment design; historical institutional separation | Establish Office of Alcohol Policy (Phase 3) to coordinate federal agencies |
| First Amendment barriers to advertising regulation | Content-based advertising restrictions face strict judicial scrutiny | Commercial speech doctrine under *Central Hudson* | Focus on placement restrictions and factual disclosure requirements; build evidentiary record of harm |
| Treatment workforce shortage | Expanding treatment access requires providers who do not yet exist | Decades of underfunding addiction medicine education | Include workforce development provisions in Trust Fund disbursements |
| Industry capture of self-regulation | Self-regulatory codes lack enforcement and accountability | No statutory mandate for third-party oversight | FTC rulemaking replaces self-regulation with enforceable standards for digital media |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Anti-stockpiling amendment**: Add provision to Alcohol Tax Modernization Act requiring excise tax to be assessed at the rate in effect on the date of removal from bonded premises or retail sale, whichever is later, for the 18-month phase-in period
2. **Controlled group aggregation**: Add cross-reference to IRC Section 1563 controlled group rules to prevent entity-splitting for CBMA small producer benefits
3. **Effective price definition**: In model MUP legislation, define "selling price" as the net price after all discounts, promotions, loyalty credits, and bundled offers
4. **Third-party age verification mandate**: Require FTC to certify age-verification technologies meeting a 95% accuracy threshold for digital advertising compliance
5. **NHTSA enforcement audit requirement**: Add annual reporting requirement to the 0.05% BAC Act requiring states to demonstrate enforcement through arrest, prosecution, and conviction data

### Sunset and Review Provisions

The Alcohol Tax Modernization Act includes no sunset provision, as CPI indexing is designed to be permanent. However, the Act requires GAO to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the tax's impact on consumption, revenue, industry, and public health at the 5-year and 10-year marks, with findings reported to Congress.

The 0.05% BAC Standard Act includes a 10-year reauthorization requirement for the training grant program (Section 4) but no sunset for the funding condition itself, consistent with the permanent structure of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act.
