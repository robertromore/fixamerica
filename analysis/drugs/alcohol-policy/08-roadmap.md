# Alcohol Policy: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

The roadmap follows a three-phase strategy that builds political momentum by starting with reforms that have existing coalitions and demonstrated results, then leveraging those successes to advance more ambitious structural changes. Phase 1 focuses on extending proven interventions (ignition interlocks, treatment parity enforcement) that face manageable opposition. Phase 2 tackles the two most impactful structural reforms -- taxation and BAC standards -- after building a coalition and evidence base. Phase 3 pursues comprehensive institutional reform and long-term cultural change.

Each phase builds on the preceding one: Phase 1 enforcement successes demonstrate that alcohol regulation works without constituting "prohibition"; Phase 2 fiscal and safety reforms reduce harm at population scale; Phase 3 institutionalizes evidence-based governance and closes the treatment gap.

### Expected Outcomes

By Year 10: all 50 states at 0.05% BAC, reducing DUI fatalities below 8,000 annually; federal Office of Alcohol Policy coordinating taxation, regulation, treatment, and research; AUD treatment rate at 25% (up from 7.6%); alcohol-attributable mortality reduced by at least 25% (from ~178,000 to ~135,000 or fewer); 10+ states with minimum unit pricing; health warning labels fully implemented and evaluated; comprehensive evaluation demonstrating return on investment.

## Governance and Oversight

**Phase 1-2**: The Surgeon General's office will coordinate interagency implementation through an Alcohol Policy Task Force including TTB, NHTSA, FTC, FDA, SAMHSA, NIAAA, and CDC. The task force will issue annual progress reports and testify before relevant Congressional committees.

**Phase 3**: The Office of Alcohol Policy (OAP) will assume permanent coordination responsibility, with statutory authority to convene agencies, set policy priorities, and submit an annual National Alcohol Policy Report to Congress. The OAP director will be Senate-confirmed and report to the Secretary of HHS.

**Evaluation**: NIAAA and GAO will conduct independent evaluations at Year 3, Year 5, and Year 10, with findings reported to Congress and the public.

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Industry Legal Challenge to Advertising Regulations

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Design FTC rules to regulate placement rather than content where possible (time/manner/place restrictions face lower First Amendment scrutiny than content restrictions). Include strong evidentiary record documenting youth exposure and self-regulatory failure. Model rules on tobacco advertising restrictions upheld by courts.

**Contingency Plan**: If content restrictions are struck down, pursue expanded disclosure requirements (compelled factual speech faces lower scrutiny than content bans under *Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel*, 471 U.S. 626, 1985).

### Risk 2: State Non-Compliance with 0.05% BAC Incentive

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Structure funding conditions as incentives rather than mandates (5% of highway safety funding). Publicize Utah results extensively. Engage law enforcement organizations as advocates.

**Contingency Plan**: If adoption stalls below 30 states after 5 years, increase the funding condition to 8% (consistent with the MLDA 21 Act precedent of 10% of highway construction funds).

### Risk 3: Tax Increase Fails in Congress

**Likelihood**: High (initially)

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Build coalition of public health organizations, fiscal hawks (deficit reduction), and treatment advocates. Earmark revenue to popular programs (treatment, veterans, DUI prevention). Introduce as part of broader fiscal package rather than standalone.

**Contingency Plan**: If federal increase fails, pursue state-level increases through ballot initiatives (where available) and model legislation. Even without federal action, state increases in the 10 largest states would significantly affect national consumption.

### Risk 4: Treatment Workforce Insufficient for Expansion

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Include workforce development provisions in SAMHSA grants (training stipends, loan forgiveness for addiction medicine). Expand scope of practice for nurse practitioners and physician assistants to prescribe AUD medications. Use telehealth to extend provider reach.

**Contingency Plan**: Prioritize medication-assisted treatment (naltrexone, acamprosate) which requires less intensive clinical support than psychosocial interventions, enabling faster capacity expansion.

## Resource Requirements
