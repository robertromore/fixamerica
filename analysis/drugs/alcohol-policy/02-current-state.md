# Alcohol Policy: Current State

## Consumption Patterns

Alcohol remains the most widely consumed psychoactive substance in the United States. Consumption patterns vary significantly by age, gender, race/ethnicity, and geography, with important implications for policy design.

### Overall Consumption

| Metric | Value | Trend | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Current drinkers (past month, aged 12+) | 133.1 million (48.7%) | Stable | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |
| Binge drinkers (past month, aged 12+) | 61.2 million (22.4%) | Slight decline from 2019 peak | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |
| Heavy drinkers (past month, aged 12+) | 16.1 million (5.9%) | Stable | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |
| Per capita ethanol consumption (gallons/year) | 2.51 gallons | Up from 2.33 in 2010 | NIAAA Surveillance Report, 2024 |
| Alcohol market revenue (2023) | $283 billion | Up 3.2% from 2022 | IWSR/Distilled Spirits Council, 2024 |

Per capita consumption, after declining from its 1981 peak of 2.76 gallons per year, has been rising since 2010 and accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase has been driven partly by the growth of spirits and ready-to-drink (RTD) cocktails at the expense of beer.

### Demographic Variation

| Demographic | Past-Month Use Rate | Binge Rate | Heavy Use Rate | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Males aged 18-25 | 55.8% | 36.9% | 10.2% | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |
| Females aged 18-25 | 51.4% | 24.1% | 5.7% | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |
| Males aged 26+ | 56.3% | 27.2% | 7.6% | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |
| Females aged 26+ | 47.0% | 15.2% | 3.4% | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |
| Non-Hispanic White | 56.2% | 25.1% | 6.7% | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |
| Non-Hispanic Black | 43.2% | 19.8% | 4.6% | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |
| Hispanic/Latino | 44.7% | 22.6% | 5.2% | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |
| American Indian/Alaska Native | 37.5% | 21.4% | 6.1% | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |

### Underage Drinking

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Underage drinkers (ages 12-20, past month) | 7.1 million | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |
| Underage binge drinkers (past month) | 3.9 million | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |
| Percentage of 12-20 year-olds who drank (past month) | 15.1% | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |
| Average age of first drink | 14.1 years | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |
| Youth who obtained alcohol from someone 21+ | 67% of underage drinkers | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |

Underage drinking has declined significantly over the past two decades. In 2002, 28.8% of 12-20 year-olds reported past-month alcohol use; by 2023, that figure had fallen to 15.1% -- a 48% decrease. Nevertheless, nearly 4 million minors binge-drank in the past month.

## Mortality and Morbidity

### Alcohol-Attributable Deaths

The CDC's Alcohol-Related Disease Impact (ARDI) application estimates approximately 178,000 alcohol-attributable deaths annually in the United States, encompassing both acute causes (motor vehicle crashes, alcohol poisoning, falls, drownings, suicides, homicides) and chronic causes (liver disease, heart disease, cancer, stroke).

| Cause Category | Annual Deaths | Share of Total | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Chronic liver disease and cirrhosis | 56,585 | 31.8% | CDC WONDER, 2024 |
| Alcohol-related cancers (breast, liver, colorectal, esophageal, oral) | ~20,000 | 11.2% | ACS/Lancet Oncology, 2023 |
| Alcohol-impaired driving fatalities | 13,524 | 7.6% | NHTSA FARS, 2023 |
| Alcohol poisoning/acute intoxication | 2,580 | 1.4% | CDC WONDER, 2024 |
| Alcohol-attributable suicides | ~7,500 | 4.2% | CDC/ARDI, 2024 |
| Alcohol-attributable homicides | ~7,800 | 4.4% | CDC/ARDI, 2024 |
| Cardiovascular (net effect) | ~35,000 | 19.7% | CDC/ARDI, 2024 |
| Other causes (falls, drownings, injuries) | ~35,000 | 19.7% | CDC/ARDI, 2024 |

### Trend in Alcohol-Related Deaths

Alcohol-related deaths have increased substantially over the past two decades:

| Period | Annual Deaths (est.) | Per 100,000 Population | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1999-2001 (average) | ~75,000 | 26.0 | CDC WONDER |
| 2009-2011 (average) | ~88,000 | 28.3 | CDC WONDER |
| 2019 | ~95,000 | 29.0 | CDC ARDI |
| 2020 | ~140,000 | 42.8 | CDC/Lancet, 2024 |
| 2021 | ~178,000 | 53.9 | CDC ARDI, 2024 |
| 2022 (provisional) | ~175,000 | 52.5 | CDC WONDER, 2024 |

The COVID-19 pandemic produced a sharp spike in alcohol-related mortality. While alcohol consumption increased modestly during the pandemic, deaths surged due to increased heavy drinking, reduced access to treatment, and compounding health effects.

### Alcohol Use Disorder

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Americans with AUD (past year, 2023) | 29.5 million (10.5% of adults) | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |
| AUD prevalence among males | 14.1% | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |
| AUD prevalence among females | 7.3% | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |
| Received any treatment (past year) | 2.2 million (7.6% of those with AUD) | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |
| Treatment gap (AUD but no treatment) | 27.3 million (92.4%) | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |

The treatment gap for alcohol use disorder is the largest in substance use medicine. Fewer than 1 in 13 Americans with AUD receive any form of treatment. Barriers include stigma, cost, lack of awareness of treatment options, and insufficient provider capacity.

### Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Estimated FASD prevalence (U.S. children) | 1-5% of school-age children | NIAAA/May et al., 2018 |
| Women who drink during pregnancy (any amount) | ~13.5% | CDC BRFSS, 2023 |
| Binge drinking during pregnancy | ~5.2% | CDC BRFSS, 2023 |
| Estimated annual cost of FASD | $5.5 billion | CDC, 2024 estimate |
| Children with FASD in foster care | ~60% of foster children affected | NIAAA, 2019 |

## DUI/DWI Enforcement

### Impaired Driving Statistics

| Metric | Value | Trend | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Alcohol-impaired driving fatalities (2022) | 13,524 | Up 14% from 2019 | NHTSA FARS, 2023 |
| Share of all traffic fatalities | 32% | Stable (30-33% range since 2010) | NHTSA, 2023 |
| DUI arrests (2022) | ~1 million | Down from 1.4 million in 2010 | FBI UCR, 2023 |
| Repeat DUI offenders (share of DUI fatalities) | ~33% | Stable | NHTSA, 2023 |
| Drivers in fatal crashes with BAC >= 0.08% | 11,654 | Up from 10,142 in 2019 | NHTSA FARS, 2023 |

### State DUI/DWI Legal Framework

| Standard | States Adopting | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| BAC limit of 0.08% (standard) | 50 states + D.C. | Universal since 2004 |
| BAC limit of 0.05% (standard) | 1 (Utah, since 2018) | No other state has followed |
| Zero tolerance for under-21 (0.00-0.02% BAC) | 50 states + D.C. | Universal |
| Mandatory ignition interlock (first offense) | 34 states + D.C. | Up from 18 states in 2015 |
| Mandatory ignition interlock (all offenses) | 34 states + D.C. | MADD model |
| Implied consent laws | 50 states + D.C. | License suspension for refusal |
| Sobriety checkpoints authorized | 38 states + D.C. | 12 states prohibit |
| .15%+ BAC enhanced penalties | 46 states | High-BAC offender laws |

Utah's 2018 adoption of a 0.05% BAC limit is the only state to move below the 0.08% standard. Studies from the University of Utah found a 19.8% reduction in alcohol-related fatal crashes in the first year (American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 2022).

## Taxation and Pricing

### Federal Excise Tax Rates

| Beverage | Tax Rate | Effective Rate per Standard Drink | Last Adjusted |
|---|---|---|---|
| Beer (standard rate) | $18.00 per barrel (31 gal) | ~$0.05 | 1991 |
| Beer (small brewer, first 60,000 bbl) | $3.50 per barrel | ~$0.01 | 2020 (CBMA/CARES Act) |
| Wine (still, 14% or less) | $1.07 per gallon | ~$0.04 | 1991 |
| Spirits (distilled) | $13.50 per proof gallon | ~$0.13 | 1991 |

Federal excise tax rates on alcohol were last increased in 1991 (Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act). Since then, inflation has eroded their real value by approximately 50%. In 1991 dollars, the current beer excise would need to be approximately $36 per barrel to maintain the same real rate.

### State Excise Tax Rates (Selected)

| State | Beer ($/gallon) | Wine ($/gallon) | Spirits ($/gallon) | Control State? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Tennessee | $1.29 | $1.21 | $4.40 | No |
| Alaska | $1.07 | $2.50 | $12.80 | No |
| Washington | $0.26 | $0.87 | $35.31 (incl. liter tax) | No (was until 2012) |
| Wyoming | $0.02 | $0.00 | State-controlled | Yes |
| Missouri | $0.06 | $0.42 | $2.00 | No |
| Median state beer tax | $0.25 | -- | -- | -- |

State excise taxes vary by more than a factor of 60 for beer ($0.02 in Wyoming to $1.29 in Tennessee). Seventeen states operate as "control" states that directly manage wholesale or retail distribution of spirits (and in some cases wine), which affects both pricing and availability.

### Real Tax Value Decline

| Year | Federal Beer Tax (nominal) | Federal Beer Tax (2023 dollars) | Real Value Index (1951=100) |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1951 | $9.00/barrel | $108.00/barrel | 100 |
| 1976 | $9.00/barrel | $48.90/barrel | 45 |
| 1991 | $18.00/barrel | $40.50/barrel | 38 |
| 2024 | $18.00/barrel | $18.00/barrel | 17 |

The real value of the federal beer excise tax has declined by approximately 83% since 1951, representing one of the most dramatic erosions of any federal revenue instrument.

## Advertising and Marketing

### Industry Spending

| Category | Annual Spending | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Total alcohol marketing (all media) | ~$7.7 billion | FTC, 2022 report |
| Television advertising | ~$2.1 billion | Kantar Media/FTC, 2022 |
| Digital and social media | ~$1.9 billion | FTC, 2022 |
| Sponsorships and events | ~$1.3 billion | FTC, 2022 |
| Print, radio, outdoor | ~$0.9 billion | FTC, 2022 |
| Point-of-sale and promotions | ~$1.5 billion | FTC, 2022 |

### Youth Exposure

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Youth (12-20) exposure to TV alcohol ads (annual) | ~570 ads per year | CAMY/Johns Hopkins, 2023 |
| Share of digital alcohol ads reaching underage users | 23-29% | FTC, 2022 |
| Alcohol brands with social media presence accessible to minors | >95% | Jernigan et al., JAMA Pediatrics, 2022 |
| Youth who report seeing alcohol ads on social media (past month) | 70% of 13-17 year-olds | Alcohol Justice, 2023 |

The alcohol industry operates under a self-regulatory framework administered by the Distilled Spirits Council (DISCUS), the Beer Institute, and the Wine Institute. The FTC has periodically reviewed these self-regulatory codes and found persistent shortcomings, particularly in digital media where age-gating mechanisms are easily circumvented.

## Geographic Variation

### Regional Consumption Differences

| Region | Per Capita Ethanol (gal/year) | Binge Drinking Rate | DUI Fatality Rate (per 100k) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Northeast | 2.64 | 21.7% | 2.8 |
| Midwest | 2.58 | 24.3% | 3.4 |
| South | 2.19 | 19.8% | 3.7 |
| West | 2.72 | 22.9% | 3.1 |
| National average | 2.51 | 22.4% | 3.3 |

Source: NIAAA Surveillance Report, 2024; SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024; NHTSA FARS, 2023

The South has the lowest per-capita consumption but the highest DUI fatality rate, a pattern partly explained by lower seatbelt use, more rural driving, and in some areas, less robust DUI enforcement infrastructure.

## Recent Trends

### Changes in the Past Decade

- **Spirits market share growth**: Spirits surpassed beer in revenue share for the first time in 2022, reflecting consumer preference shifts toward cocktails and RTD beverages (DISCUS, 2023)
- **Ready-to-drink (RTD) explosion**: RTD cocktails grew from $1.6 billion in sales (2019) to $10.5 billion (2023), blurring regulatory categories (IWSR, 2024)
- **COVID-19 impact**: Alcohol consumption increased during the pandemic, with a 3% rise in per-capita consumption from 2019-2021 and a sharp increase in alcohol-related emergency department visits and deaths (NIAAA, 2023)
- **Ignition interlock expansion**: 34 states now require ignition interlock for all DUI offenders (up from 18 in 2015), the most significant DUI policy shift in a decade (MADD, 2024)
- **Health messaging evolution**: Growing public awareness of alcohol-cancer links following WHO International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classification and 2023 WHO statement that "no level of alcohol consumption is safe for health"
- **Cannabis substitution effect**: Research suggests modest substitution of alcohol with cannabis in legalization states, with a 5-10% reduction in alcohol sales in some jurisdictions (Baggio et al., Journal of Health Economics, 2023)

## Emerging Challenges

### New Product Categories

The rapid growth of RTD cocktails, hard seltzers, and other hybrid products has outpaced regulatory frameworks designed for traditional beer, wine, and spirits categories. Many RTD products fall into ambiguous tax and regulatory classifications, and their marketing frequently targets younger demographics with flavored, low-calorie positioning.

### Digital Marketing and Age Verification

Social media platforms have become the dominant advertising channel for alcohol brands targeting 21-34 year-olds, but age-gating on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube is easily circumvented. Influencer marketing creates additional accountability gaps, as individual content creators are not bound by industry self-regulatory codes.

### Alcohol-Related Liver Disease in Younger Adults

Alcohol-associated liver disease hospitalizations among adults aged 25-34 increased by 30% between 2016 and 2022 (Tapper & Parikh, BMJ, 2023). This trend, accelerated by pandemic-era drinking patterns, represents a worrying shift toward earlier-onset severe alcohol-related illness.

### International Policy Divergence

Other nations are moving more aggressively on alcohol policy. Ireland enacted the Public Health (Alcohol) Act in 2018 mandating minimum unit pricing and health labeling. Scotland implemented minimum unit pricing in 2018 with positive early results. Canada's updated Low-Risk Drinking Guidelines (2023) recommend no more than 2 drinks per week. These international developments are creating pressure for U.S. policy reassessment.
