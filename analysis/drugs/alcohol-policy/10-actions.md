# Alcohol Policy: What You Can Do

Alcohol-related harm is one of the most preventable public health crises in the United States, yet it receives far less advocacy attention than many problems that cause fewer deaths. The 178,000 annual alcohol-attributable deaths, the 92.4% treatment gap for alcohol use disorder, and the 13,524 DUI fatalities represent failures of policy, not inevitability. Citizen engagement -- informed by evidence and directed at specific reform targets -- can shift the political calculus that has protected the status quo.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- Read the WHO's 2023 statement on alcohol and health and the 2025 U.S. Surgeon General's advisory on alcohol and cancer to understand the current scientific consensus
- Subscribe to NIAAA's *Alcohol Alert* newsletter for research updates: <https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications>
- Follow the NIAAA Alcohol Policy Information System (APIS) to track state-level policy changes: <https://alcoholpolicy.niaaa.nih.gov>
- Read Philip J. Cook's *Paying the Tab: The Costs and Benefits of Alcohol Control* (Princeton, 2007) for a foundational understanding of alcohol economics

### Make Personal Changes

- Know your state's DUI laws and never drive after drinking -- use ride-sharing services, designated drivers, or public transit
- If you or someone you know has concerns about alcohol use, contact SAMHSA's National Helpline at 1-800-662-4357 (free, confidential, 24/7)
- Model responsible attitudes toward alcohol with young people in your family and community; discuss the evidence on alcohol and health openly
- If you are a healthcare provider, integrate SBIRT (Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment) into your practice

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact Your Representatives**: Write to your U.S. Senators and Representative about indexing alcohol excise taxes to inflation and updating health warning labels. These are concrete, actionable legislative asks.
- **Submit Public Comments**: When the FTC or TTB publish proposed rules on alcohol advertising or labeling, submit comments supporting evidence-based standards. Federal rulemaking comment periods are published at <https://www.regulations.gov>.
- **Write Letters to the Editor**: Respond to local media coverage of DUI incidents, alcohol-related deaths, or industry marketing by framing the issue as a policy problem, not just a personal responsibility problem.
- **Share Information**: Share the Surgeon General's 2025 alcohol-cancer advisory and WHO guidance on social media. Public awareness is the foundation of political will.

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- Form or join a local coalition to monitor alcohol outlet density in your community, particularly in low-income neighborhoods. CADCA (Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America) provides organizing resources at <https://www.cadca.org>
- Attend city council or county commission meetings when liquor license applications are considered. Advocate for community input requirements and density limits.
- Partner with local hospitals and health departments to organize community education events on alcohol and cancer, FASD prevention, and treatment options
- Support or start a local chapter of MADD if one does not exist in your area: <https://www.madd.org/get-involved/>

### Build Coalitions

- Connect alcohol policy reform with broader public health coalitions working on substance use, traffic safety, domestic violence, and cancer prevention. The alcohol-cancer link is a powerful bridge to cancer advocacy organizations.
- Engage faith communities, which have historical roots in temperance advocacy and current interest in family well-being, addiction recovery, and youth protection
- Reach out to law enforcement and first responder organizations that see the consequences of alcohol misuse daily -- they can be powerful allies for DUI reform and treatment funding

## Political Actions

### Contact Elected Officials

**When to Contact**:

- When alcohol tax legislation is introduced or markup is scheduled in Ways and Means or Finance committees
- When state DUI laws are under consideration (particularly 0.05% BAC proposals)
- During federal budget season (February-October) when SAMHSA and NIAAA appropriations are debated
- When the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee releases its recommendations (every 5 years, next due 2025-2026)

**What to Say -- Template Email**:

```
Subject: Support Evidence-Based Alcohol Policy Reform

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

I am writing as a constituent from [City, State] to urge you to support evidence-based alcohol policy reform. Alcohol is responsible for approximately 178,000 American deaths annually -- more than opioid overdoses -- yet our regulatory framework has not been substantively updated in decades.

Specifically, I ask you to support:

1. Indexing federal alcohol excise taxes to inflation (unchanged since 1991)
2. Updated health warning labels reflecting the alcohol-cancer link, as recommended by the Surgeon General
3. Federal incentive legislation for a 0.05% BAC standard, which has saved lives in Utah and over 100 countries

These are evidence-based policies supported by the National Academies of Sciences, the World Health Organization, and the American Medical Association. They would save thousands of lives and generate billions in revenue for prevention and treatment.

Thank you for your service and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say -- Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City]. I'm calling about alcohol policy reform. Alcohol kills 178,000 Americans a year, and federal excise taxes haven't been raised since 1991. I'd like the [Representative/Senator] to support indexing alcohol taxes to inflation and updating health warning labels. Can you please note my position?"
```

### Support Legislation

Current or proposed legislation to support:

- **Alcohol Tax Modernization**: Any bill proposing CPI indexing of federal alcohol excise taxes -- contact the House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Finance Committee to express support
- **0.05% BAC Standard**: Support any bill conditioning highway safety funding on state adoption of 0.05% BAC limits, modeled on the National Minimum Drinking Age Act approach
- **Health Warning Label Modernization**: Support TTB rulemaking or Congressional legislation to update the 1988 warning labels to include cancer risk information
- **MHPAEA Enforcement**: Support appropriations for HHS enforcement of mental health parity for alcohol treatment

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "Do you support indexing federal alcohol excise taxes to inflation? They haven't been raised since 1991 and have lost half their real value."
2. "Do you support updating alcohol health warning labels to include cancer risk information, as the Surgeon General has recommended?"
3. "Would you support federal incentive legislation for a 0.05% BAC DUI standard, as recommended by the National Academies of Sciences?"

**Voting Considerations**:

- Look for candidates who demonstrate independence from alcohol industry contributions
- Check candidate positions on MADD's scorecard: <https://www.madd.org/the-solution/policy/>
- Note committee assignments -- members of Ways and Means, Finance, Commerce, and Judiciary have the most direct influence on alcohol policy

## Professional Actions

- **For Healthcare Providers**: Integrate alcohol screening (AUDIT-C or CAGE) into routine clinical practice. Prescribe naltrexone or acamprosate for patients with AUD. Report barriers to treatment parity to your state insurance commissioner.
- **For Educators**: Implement evidence-based prevention curricula (not D.A.R.E.) in schools. Resources available from NIAAA: <https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/make-difference-talk-child-about-alcohol>
- **For Public Health Professionals**: Advocate for alcohol-specific surveillance and intervention funding within your agency. Include alcohol in comprehensive community health assessments.
- **For Lawyers**: Support pro bono representation of DUI victims seeking civil remedies. Monitor and challenge self-regulatory practices that fail to protect the public.
- **For Journalists**: Cover alcohol as a policy issue, not just an individual behavior issue. Report on industry lobbying, tax erosion, and the treatment gap alongside DUI incidents and alcohol-related deaths.

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing alcohol policy with others, emphasize:

1. **The death toll is hidden in plain sight**: Alcohol kills approximately 178,000 Americans per year -- more than opioid overdoses -- but receives a fraction of the policy attention and funding (CDC, 2024).
2. **Taxes work and they are historically cheap**: Federal alcohol excise taxes have not been raised since 1991 and have lost half their real value. Evidence from 112 studies shows higher prices reduce consumption and save lives (Wagenaar et al., 2009).
3. **The treatment gap is a disgrace**: Only 7.6% of the 29.5 million Americans with alcohol use disorder receive any treatment. Effective medications exist. The barrier is policy, not science (SAMHSA, 2024).
4. **This is not about Prohibition**: Evidence-based regulation -- taxes, labeling, DUI enforcement, advertising standards -- is the opposite of an outright ban. Every other dangerous legal product is regulated this way.
5. **Other countries are ahead of us**: Over 100 countries have 0.05% BAC limits. Scotland's minimum pricing reduced deaths by 13%. Canada updated its drinking guidelines to 2 per week. The U.S. is falling behind.

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "Moderate drinking is good for your heart" | Mendelian randomization studies find no cardiovascular benefit at any consumption level; apparent benefits were due to confounding | *Lancet* (Millwood et al., 2019); *JAMA Network Open* (Biddinger et al., 2022) |
| "The drinking age should be 18 like in Europe" | MLDA 21 has saved an estimated 30,000 lives; European countries have higher rates of youth binge drinking and alcohol-related harm | NHTSA, 2020; WHO Global Status Report, 2024 |
| "Raising taxes just hurts responsible drinkers" | Tax increases disproportionately reduce heavy drinking; the top 20% of drinkers consume 85% of all alcohol sold | Cook, *Paying the Tab*, 2007; Wagenaar et al., 2009 |
| "Self-regulation of advertising works fine" | FTC found 23-29% of digital alcohol ads reach underage audiences under self-regulation; no enforceable penalties exist | FTC, 2022 |
| "DUI is already heavily enforced" | DUI arrests have declined 30% since 2010 while fatalities have increased 14%; enforcement resources are inadequate | FBI UCR, 2023; NHTSA FARS, 2023 |
