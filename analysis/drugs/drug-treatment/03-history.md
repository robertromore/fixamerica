# Drug Treatment: Historical Context

## Overview

The history of drug treatment in America is a story of cyclical progress and regression, shaped by moral panics, scientific discovery, political expediency, and the persistent tension between viewing addiction as a crime versus a medical condition. For most of American history, the criminal model dominated. The medical model has gained ground in fits and starts, with each advance typically followed by political backlash. Understanding this history is essential for comprehending why the treatment system remains so fragmented and underfunded despite decades of evidence demonstrating that treatment works.

## Timeline of Key Developments

### The Pre-Modern Era (Pre-1900)

| Year | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1800s | Patent medicines widely available | Opium, morphine, cocaine, and cannabis sold without restriction |
| 1861-1865 | Civil War | Widespread morphine use for wounded soldiers; "soldier's disease" |
| 1870s | Keeley Institutes | First commercial addiction treatment chain; "gold cure" (bichloride of gold injections) |
| 1880s | Addiction recognized as medical condition | Early medical literature describes addiction as a disease |
| 1898 | Bayer markets heroin | Marketed as a "non-addictive" morphine substitute and cough suppressant |

Before 1900, addiction was widespread but largely unregulated. Opium-laced patent medicines were sold in every general store, and an estimated 300,000 Americans were addicted to opiates by the 1890s--disproportionately middle-class white women who consumed laudanum and morphine preparations prescribed by physicians.

### The Criminalization Era (1900-1960)

| Year | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1906 | Pure Food and Drug Act | Required labeling of contents; first federal drug regulation |
| 1909 | Shanghai Opium Commission | First international drug control effort; U.S. led |
| 1914 | Harrison Narcotics Tax Act | Required registration and taxation of opioids and cocaine; first federal drug law |
| 1919 | *Webb v. United States* | Supreme Court ruled that prescribing narcotics to maintain addiction was not legitimate medical practice |
| 1920s | Closure of morphine maintenance clinics | 44 municipal narcotic clinics closed under federal pressure |
| 1922 | Narcotic Drugs Import and Export Act | Restricted narcotic imports to medical and scientific use |
| 1929 | Porter Act | Established two federal "narcotic farms" for addiction treatment |
| 1935 | U.S. Public Health Service Hospital, Lexington | First federal treatment facility opened (also a prison) |
| 1938 | Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act | Expanded FDA authority over drug safety |
| 1951 | Boggs Act | Mandatory minimums for drug offenses; treatment further marginalized |
| 1956 | Narcotic Control Act | Increased penalties; death penalty for selling heroin to minors |

The Harrison Act of 1914 was the watershed moment. While ostensibly a tax and registration measure, federal enforcement agencies interpreted it--and courts upheld this interpretation--as prohibiting physicians from maintaining addicted patients on opioids. The result was the closure of every morphine maintenance clinic in the country by the mid-1920s and the effective criminalization of addiction treatment. Physicians who continued to prescribe maintenance doses were prosecuted; approximately 25,000 physicians were indicted, and 3,000 served prison sentences.

The Lexington "narcotic farm," opened in 1935, represented a hybrid model: part hospital, part prison, treating voluntary and involuntary patients. While it produced important early addiction research, relapse rates exceeded 90%, in part because patients returned to environments without support.

### The Medical Model Emerges (1960-1980)

| Year | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1961 | Synanon founded | Residential therapeutic community model; influenced treatment field for decades |
| 1963 | Community Mental Health Act | Deinstitutionalization; limited impact on addiction treatment |
| 1964 | Dole and Nyswander begin methadone research | Landmark studies demonstrating methadone maintenance effectiveness |
| 1966 | Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act (NARA) | First federal recognition of addiction as a disease; civil commitment for treatment |
| 1970 | Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act | Created drug schedules; included treatment provisions |
| 1970 | Controlled Substances Act | Established DEA scheduling system |
| 1971 | Nixon declares "War on Drugs" | Paradoxically, Nixon also expanded treatment funding dramatically |
| 1971 | Special Action Office for Drug Abuse Prevention (SAODAP) | First White House drug treatment office; Dr. Jerome Jaffe appointed |
| 1972 | Drug Abuse Office and Treatment Act | Authorized methadone maintenance programs |
| 1972 | FDA approves methadone for OUD treatment | First FDA-approved medication for opioid addiction |
| 1973 | DEA established | Consolidated federal drug enforcement |
| 1974 | National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) established | Federal research agency dedicated to addiction science |
| 1975 | Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration | Consolidated federal agencies |
| 1976 | Methadone regulations finalized | Established OTP framework (21 CFR Part 291, later 42 CFR Part 8) |

**The Nixon paradox**: Richard Nixon is remembered for launching the "War on Drugs," but his administration also presided over the greatest expansion of drug treatment in American history. In 1971, alarmed by heroin addiction among Vietnam veterans, Nixon allocated two-thirds of drug control funding to treatment and prevention (compared to one-third for law enforcement). Federal treatment funding increased from $80 million in 1970 to $462 million by 1973. Methadone maintenance programs expanded from a handful of research sites to over 300 clinics nationally.

The research of Drs. Vincent Dole and Marie Nyswander at Rockefeller University (1964-1966) was foundational. Their work demonstrated that methadone maintenance could normalize the lives of heroin-addicted patients--reducing crime, improving employment, and dramatically reducing heroin use. This was the first rigorous scientific evidence that pharmacological treatment of addiction was effective.

### Retrenchment and the War on Drugs (1980-2000)

| Year | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1981 | Reagan cuts treatment funding | Federal treatment block grants cut 25%; shifted to states |
| 1984 | Comprehensive Crime Control Act | Increased drug penalties; asset forfeiture |
| 1986 | Anti-Drug Abuse Act | Mandatory minimums; crack/cocaine disparity (100:1) |
| 1988 | Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 | Created ONDCP; "drug-free workplace" policies |
| 1988 | Drug-Free Workplace Act | Required federal contractors to maintain drug-free workplaces |
| 1989 | ADAMHA Reorganization Act | NIDA, NIMH, NIAAA moved to NIH |
| 1992 | SAMHSA established | Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration created |
| 1993 | Naltrexone approved for alcohol use disorder | First medication for AUD since disulfiram (1951) |
| 1994 | Violent Crime Control Act | Expanded drug courts; also expanded incarceration |
| 1995 | NIDA brain disease model | Dr. Alan Leshner publishes "Addiction Is a Brain Disease" in *Science* |
| 1996 | HIPAA | Privacy protections; 42 CFR Part 2 maintained stricter SUD protections |
| 1997 | Drug courts expand | ~400 drug courts operating |
| 2000 | Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA 2000) | Created X-waiver for buprenorphine; limit of 30 patients |

The Reagan era marked a sharp pivot away from treatment and toward enforcement. Federal treatment funding was consolidated into block grants to states, which were cut by 25% in real terms between 1981 and 1985. The "Just Say No" campaign emphasized abstinence and moral responsibility rather than medical treatment. Treatment facilities closed, waiting lists grew, and the prison population--driven by drug offenses--began its explosive growth from 330,000 in 1980 to over 2 million by 2000.

The crack cocaine epidemic of the mid-1980s intensified the punitive approach. The 100:1 sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine (reduced to 18:1 in 2010) channeled African Americans into prisons rather than treatment. By 2000, more than 50% of federal prisoners were incarcerated for drug offenses.

The Drug Addiction Treatment Act of 2000 (DATA 2000) was a critical counter-current. Championed by Senators Orrin Hatch and Joe Biden, it created the framework for office-based buprenorphine prescribing via the X-waiver system. This was the first time since the Harrison Act era that a physician could prescribe an opioid for the purpose of treating addiction outside a licensed OTP. However, the initial patient limit of 30 severely restricted its impact.

### The Modern Treatment Era (2000-Present)

| Year | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 2002 | FDA approves buprenorphine (Suboxone/Subutex) | First office-based opioid treatment medication |
| 2005 | X-waiver patient limit raised to 100 | Modest expansion of buprenorphine access |
| 2006 | Vivitrol (injectable naltrexone) approved for AUD | Monthly injection for alcohol use disorder |
| 2008 | Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA) | Required insurance parity for SUD/MH with medical benefits |
| 2010 | ACA enacted | SUD treatment as essential health benefit; Medicaid expansion |
| 2010 | Vivitrol approved for OUD | Extended naltrexone option for opioid use disorder |
| 2016 | Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) | Authorized NPs/PAs to prescribe buprenorphine; expanded naloxone |
| 2016 | 21st Century Cures Act | $1 billion in SOR grants; mental health and SUD research |
| 2016 | X-waiver patient limit raised to 275 | For physicians in practice 1+ year |
| 2017 | Sublocade (buprenorphine injection) approved | Monthly injectable buprenorphine |
| 2018 | SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act | Most comprehensive opioid legislation; Medicaid IMD exclusion waiver |
| 2018 | HHS declaration of opioid emergency | Enabled public health flexibility |
| 2020 | COVID-19 pandemic | Telehealth flexibilities; take-home methadone; increased overdose deaths |
| 2020 | Medicaid covers methadone | CMS allows Medicaid reimbursement for OTP-dispensed methadone |
| 2022 | California approves Medicaid contingency management | First state to cover CM through Medicaid |
| 2023 | X-waiver eliminated | Consolidated Appropriations Act removes buprenorphine prescribing barriers |
| 2023 | SAMHSA finalizes methadone flexibility rule | COVID-era take-home provisions made permanent |
| 2024 | DEA proposes pharmacy-based methadone | Potential paradigm shift in methadone access |
| 2024 | MHPAEA final rule strengthened | Stricter parity enforcement requirements |

## Evolution of Treatment Approaches

### The Moral Model (Pre-1900s)

Addiction was understood as a failure of character, will, or morality. "Treatment" consisted of religious conversion, moral education, and abstinence pledges. The temperance movement applied this framework primarily to alcohol.

### The Disease Model (1960s-Present)

Following the work of E.M. Jellinek (*The Disease Concept of Alcoholism*, 1960) and the American Medical Association's 1956 recognition of alcoholism as a disease, the medical model gradually gained acceptance. NIDA's 1995 articulation of addiction as a "chronic, relapsing brain disease" became the dominant scientific framework.

### The Twelve-Step Model (1935-Present)

Alcoholics Anonymous (founded 1935) and its successors (Narcotics Anonymous, 1953) developed a spiritual/mutual-aid approach that became deeply embedded in American treatment culture. By the 1980s, most residential treatment programs were "Minnesota Model" programs built around 12-step principles.

| Era | Twelve-Step Dominance | Medication Acceptance |
|-----|----------------------|----------------------|
| 1935-1960 | AA dominant for alcohol; no organized drug treatment | Hostile to all medications |
| 1960-1980 | 12-step and therapeutic communities dominate | Methadone accepted for "worst cases" only |
| 1980-2000 | 12-step still dominant; "treatment industry" grows | Slow acceptance; many programs refuse MOUD patients |
| 2000-Present | Declining dominance; evidence-based practices grow | Growing acceptance, but significant resistance remains |

### The Evidence-Based Practice Movement (2000-Present)

The push to align treatment with scientific evidence has been the defining trend of the 21st century. Key milestones:

- 2000: NIDA publishes *Principles of Drug Addiction Treatment*
- 2005: SAMHSA establishes National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and Practices (NREPP)
- 2012: SAMHSA Treatment Improvement Protocols (TIPs) updated for MOUD
- 2016: Surgeon General's Report on Alcohol, Drugs, and Health (*Facing Addiction in America*)
- 2018: National Academies report on MOUD (*Medications for Opioid Use Disorder Save Lives*)
- 2023: SAMHSA updates treatment guidelines post X-waiver removal

## Key Historical Patterns

### Pattern 1: Criminalization Follows Racialization

Throughout American history, the criminalization of drug use has been closely linked to racial and ethnic prejudice:

| Drug | Associated Group | Policy Response |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Opium (smoking) | Chinese immigrants (1870s-1900s) | Opium den bans, Chinese Exclusion Act context |
| Cocaine | African Americans (1900s-1910s) | Harrison Act; myths of cocaine-fueled violence |
| Marijuana | Mexican Americans (1930s) | Marihuana Tax Act of 1937; "reefer madness" |
| Heroin | Urban Black communities (1960s-1970s) | Tough sentencing; limited treatment access |
| Crack cocaine | Urban Black communities (1980s-1990s) | 100:1 sentencing disparity; mass incarceration |
| Opioids (prescription/fentanyl) | White suburban/rural (2010s-present) | More medicalized response; treatment expansion |

This pattern is critical for understanding the treatment gap: communities that were historically targeted for criminalization continue to have the worst treatment access.

### Pattern 2: Science Leads, Policy Lags

Scientific understanding of addiction has consistently outpaced policy response by decades:

| Scientific Discovery | Year | Policy Implementation | Lag |
|---------------------|------|----------------------|-----|
| Addiction as a medical condition | 1890s | NARA (1966) | ~70 years |
| Methadone effectiveness | 1964 | Widespread access | ~40 years (still incomplete) |
| Buprenorphine effectiveness | 1990s | FDA approval (2002) | ~10 years |
| Contingency management effectiveness | 1990s | Medicaid coverage (2024, one state) | ~30 years |
| Naloxone overdose reversal | 1971 | Widespread community access | ~40 years |

### Pattern 3: Crisis Drives Reform, Backlash Follows

Every major expansion of drug treatment has been driven by a perceived crisis that made the status quo politically untenable:

| Crisis | Reform | Backlash |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Vietnam veteran heroin addiction (1971) | Nixon treatment expansion | Reagan cuts (1981) |
| AIDS epidemic (1980s-1990s) | Needle exchange, methadone expansion | "Drug-free" policies, NIMBY opposition |
| Prescription opioid crisis (2010s) | ACA, CARA, SUPPORT Act | Concerns about "enabling" addiction |
| Fentanyl crisis (2020s) | X-waiver removal, methadone reform | Political resistance to harm reduction |

## Historical Funding Patterns

### Federal Drug Control Budget: Treatment vs. Enforcement

| Era | Treatment Share | Enforcement Share | Total Budget (Adj. 2024$) |
|-----|----------------|-------------------|--------------------------|
| 1971-1976 (Nixon/Ford) | 66% | 34% | $4.2 billion |
| 1977-1980 (Carter) | 58% | 42% | $3.8 billion |
| 1981-1988 (Reagan) | 29% | 71% | $6.5 billion |
| 1989-1992 (Bush I) | 32% | 68% | $12.1 billion |
| 1993-2000 (Clinton) | 35% | 65% | $15.8 billion |
| 2001-2008 (Bush II) | 38% | 62% | $22.4 billion |
| 2009-2016 (Obama) | 42% | 58% | $27.3 billion |
| 2017-2020 (Trump) | 45% | 55% | $35.7 billion |
| 2021-2024 (Biden) | 48% | 52% | $41.1 billion |

*Source: ONDCP National Drug Control Budget, various years, adjusted to 2024 dollars*

The trend toward parity between treatment and enforcement spending is real but slow. Even in the current era, the criminal justice system spends more on incarcerating people with substance use disorders than the public health system spends treating them.

## Lessons from History

1. **The criminalization of addiction never worked**: A century of evidence demonstrates that criminal penalties do not reduce addiction rates; they merely drive addiction underground and prevent people from seeking help.

2. **Medication works, but policy prevents access**: Every FDA-approved medication for addiction has been effective in clinical trials, yet each has faced decades of regulatory barriers, stigma, and political opposition before achieving meaningful access.

3. **Race and class determine who gets treatment and who gets prison**: The response to drug crises has consistently been shaped by the perceived demographics of those affected.

4. **Progress requires political crisis**: Treatment expansions have occurred only when drug-related crises became politically impossible to ignore.

5. **Gains are fragile**: Treatment funding and access can be reversed rapidly by political shifts, as the Reagan-era cuts demonstrated.
