# Drug Treatment: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Drug treatment legislation must address a web of federal, state, and regulatory barriers that prevent effective treatment from reaching the tens of millions of Americans who need it. The legislative approach here focuses on four pillars: (1) removing regulatory barriers to medication access, (2) enforcing insurance parity, (3) expanding treatment capacity and workforce, and (4) building recovery infrastructure. Each proposed bill includes draft text, explanation, and analysis of potential challenges.

## Federal Legislation

### Bill 1: The Treatment Access and Recovery Act

**Purpose:** Comprehensive federal legislation to close the drug treatment gap by removing medication barriers, enforcing parity, expanding the workforce, and investing in recovery infrastructure.

**Draft Text:**

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Treatment Access and Recovery Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

(a) FINDINGS.—Congress finds the following:
    (1) Approximately 48,700,000 Americans aged 12 and older had a
        substance use disorder in 2022, yet fewer than 25 percent
        received treatment.
    (2) Drug overdose deaths exceeded 107,000 in 2023, making
        overdose the leading cause of accidental death for Americans
        under age 50.
    (3) Medications for opioid use disorder reduce overdose
        mortality by 50 to 80 percent, yet only 36 percent of
        treatment facilities offer any FDA-approved medication.
    (4) The economic cost of untreated substance use disorders
        exceeds $1,000,000,000,000 annually.
    (5) Treatment for substance use disorders yields a return on
        investment of 4:1 to 12:1.

(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to—
    (1) remove regulatory barriers to evidence-based treatment
        for substance use disorders;
    (2) enforce insurance parity for substance use disorder
        treatment;
    (3) expand the treatment workforce;
    (4) invest in recovery support infrastructure; and
    (5) integrate substance use disorder treatment into the
        mainstream healthcare system.

```

**Explanation:**

- **Section 3** codifies pharmacy-based methadone dispensing, ending the OTP monopoly while maintaining safety requirements
- **Section 4** eliminates the most common insurance barrier to medication access (prior authorization)
- **Section 5** creates dedicated parity enforcement and enables patients to sue for parity violations
- **Section 6** addresses the workforce crisis through GME expansion, loan repayment, and peer specialist standards
- **Section 7** nearly doubles the SAPT Block Grant with evidence-based spending requirements
- **Section 8** ensures incarcerated people receive MOUD and are not forcibly withdrawn
- **Section 9** invests in recovery housing with quality standards and zoning protections

**Potential Challenges:**

| Challenge | Severity | Mitigation |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Cost ($6+ billion/year new spending) | High | Demonstrate ROI (4:1 to 12:1); offset with reduced criminal justice spending |
| DEA resistance to pharmacy methadone | Medium | DEA already proposed rule; congressional mandate overrides reluctance |
| Insurance industry opposition to Section 4 | High | Build on MHPAEA precedent; emphasize modest cost impact |
| State resistance to block grant conditions | Medium | Set-asides are floors, not mandates; states retain flexibility |
| Correctional facility opposition to MOUD | Medium | Rhode Island evidence is compelling; federal prison mandate leads |

**Refinements:**

1. Consider phased implementation for pharmacy methadone (pilot program in Year 1, full authorization in Year 3)
2. Include demonstration waiver authority for innovative state models
3. Add whistleblower protections for parity violation reporting

**Proposed Regulation:**

- Allow DEA-registered pharmacies to dispense methadone for OUD under physician prescription
- Require pharmacist training on OUD and methadone safety
- Implement electronic monitoring for diversion prevention
- Phase in over 24 months with pilot evaluation

**Status:** DEA published proposed rule in April 2024; final rule pending.

### SAMHSA OTP Regulation Updates

**Existing Authority:** 42 CFR Part 8

**Proposed Updates:**

- Codify COVID-era take-home flexibilities (completed February 2024)
- Allow clinical judgment rather than rigid time-based criteria for take-home doses
- Reduce administrative burden for OTP certification
- Enable mobile OTP units for underserved areas

### CMS Medicaid Guidance

**Proposed Guidance:**

- Mandate same-day or next-day access standards for MOUD initiation
- Prohibit prior authorization for FDA-approved SUD medications in Medicaid

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|---------|
| Commerce Clause (pharmacy methadone) | Federal authority to regulate controlled substance dispensing is well-established under Commerce Clause |
| Eighth Amendment (correctional MOUD) | Growing case law supports MOUD access as required under Eighth Amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment |
| Due Process (drug court medication restrictions) | Restricting evidence-based medication may violate due process rights of drug court participants |
| Spending Clause (block grant conditions) | Evidence-based practice requirements as block grant conditions are permissible under spending power |
| ADA (medication-based discrimination) | Discrimination against individuals receiving MOUD may violate ADA; DOJ has issued guidance |

### Preemption Questions

| Question | Analysis |
|----------|---------|
| Federal pharmacy methadone vs. state OTP laws | Federal legislation would preempt more restrictive state requirements |
| MHPAEA vs. state insurance regulation | Federal parity law sets floor; states may be more protective |
| Block grant conditions vs. state autonomy | Conditions are permissible but states retain implementation flexibility |
| Zoning preemption for recovery housing | Fair Housing Act already provides some protection; explicit preemption strengthens |

### Enforcement Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Private right of action | Parity enforcement; recovery housing discrimination |
| Federal grant conditions | Block grant set-asides; evidence-based practice requirements |
| Civil penalties | State parity enforcement; quality standards compliance |
| DOJ enforcement | ADA violations; Fair Housing Act |
| DOL investigations | ERISA plan parity compliance |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Treatment Access and Recovery Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Pharmacy opt-out | Pharmacies may refuse to stock/dispense methadone | High |
| Training requirement vagueness | "Training program as determined by the Secretary" is undefined | Medium |
| Block grant set-aside workarounds | States may redefine existing spending as new set-aside compliance | Medium |
| Correctional medical exception | "Absent clinical determination" language could be abused by anti-MOUD physicians | High |
| Private right of action limitations | ERISA preemption may limit state-law parity claims | Medium |
| Recovery housing quality enforcement | Voluntary standards may not prevent predatory operators | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Does not mandate Medicaid expansion | 2.2 million adults remain in coverage gap | Political infeasibility of federal expansion mandate |
| Workforce pipeline takes years | Treatment gap persists during buildout period | GME training cycle is inherently slow |
| No stimulant medication solution | Legislative focus on opioids; stimulant crisis growing | No FDA-approved stimulant SUD medication exists |
| NIMBYism difficult to legislate away | Zoning preemption faces local resistance | Community opposition is emotional, not legal |
| Insurance industry compliance lag | Parity violations will continue during enforcement ramp-up | Enforcement capacity takes time to build |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Add pharmacy "conscience clause" override requiring pharmacies that refuse methadone to refer patients to the nearest willing pharmacy within 30 miles
2. Define minimum training requirements in statute (8 hours for pharmacists; 16 hours for prescribers) rather than delegating to the Secretary
3. Require independent audits of block grant set-aside compliance
4. Replace "clinical determination by a physician" with "clinical determination by the treating addiction medicine team" to prevent individual physician obstruction
5. Include explicit ERISA preemption carve-out for SUD parity claims
6. Establish mandatory (not voluntary) recovery housing quality standards with enforcement authority

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| DEA rulemaking may lag congressional mandate | Include hard deadlines with automatic authority transfers if missed |
| State resistance to federal conditions | Provide enhanced federal match for compliant states rather than punitive withholding |
| For-profit treatment industry may resist quality standards | Phase in requirements over 3 years; provide technical assistance |
| Pharmacy workforce unprepared for methadone dispensing | Fund pharmacist training programs; include continuing education requirements |
| Data systems inadequate for outcome tracking | Include $200 million for HIT infrastructure for SUD treatment outcome measurement |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

- Block grant authorization: 5-year reauthorization cycle with GAO evaluation at Year 3
- Pharmacy methadone pilot evaluation at 18 months; full implementation contingent on safety data
- Parity enforcement effectiveness review at 3 years; congressional report required
- Workforce pipeline evaluation at 5 years with target metrics
- Recovery housing standards review at 3 years with quality outcome data
