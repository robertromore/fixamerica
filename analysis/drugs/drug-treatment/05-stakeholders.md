# Drug Treatment: Stakeholders

## Overview

Drug treatment policy involves a broad constellation of stakeholders with varying degrees of power, investment, and alignment. People with substance use disorders and their families are the primary affected population, but their political influence is minimal compared to institutional actors such as the pharmaceutical industry, insurance companies, provider organizations, and government agencies. Understanding stakeholder dynamics is essential for identifying reform allies, anticipating opposition, and designing politically viable strategies.

## Primary Stakeholders: Those Most Affected

### People with Substance Use Disorders

| Characteristic | Data | Source |
|---------------|------|--------|
| Population size | 48.7 million (aged 12+, 2022) | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2022 |
| Currently receiving treatment | ~11.7 million (24.1%) | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2022 |
| Perceived need but no treatment | 10.3 million | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2022 |
| Annual overdose deaths | 107,543 (2023) | CDC WONDER, 2024 |
| Incarcerated with SUD | ~1.5 million | BJS, 2023 |

**Key interests:**

- Access to effective treatment without financial ruin or criminal consequences
- Removal of stigma and discrimination in healthcare, employment, and housing
- Choice of treatment modality, including medication-assisted treatment
- Privacy protections (42 CFR Part 2)
- Recovery support services and long-term care

**Political power:** Low. People with active SUD face multiple barriers to political participation: stigma prevents public advocacy, criminal records restrict voting in some states, and the chaos of active addiction limits organizational capacity. However, the growing recovery community (22.3 million Americans) is increasingly organized politically.

### Families and Caregivers

| Characteristic | Data | Source |
|---------------|------|--------|
| Family members affected by a loved one's SUD | ~100 million | Partnership to End Addiction, 2023 |
| Annual family economic burden of SUD | Estimated $67 billion | RAND Corporation, 2022 |
| Children living with a parent with SUD | 7.5 million (under 18) | SAMHSA, 2022 |
| Grandparents raising grandchildren due to parental SUD | 2.6 million | Census Bureau, 2022 |

**Key interests:**

- Access to treatment for loved ones
- Family-inclusive treatment approaches
- Respite and support services
- Information about addiction and recovery
- Protection from financial devastation caused by loved one's SUD

**Political power:** Moderate and growing. Family advocacy organizations (e.g., Partnership to End Addiction, Shatterproof) have become effective lobbying forces. The opioid crisis mobilized thousands of families, particularly in suburban and rural communities with political influence.

### Recovery Community

| Characteristic | Data | Source |
|---------------|------|--------|
| Americans in recovery | 22.3 million | Recovery Research Institute, 2023 |
| Recovery advocacy organizations | 200+ (national and state) | Faces & Voices of Recovery, 2024 |
| Recovery community organizations (RCOs) | ~150 | SAMHSA, 2023 |
| Recovery voters registered | Unknown (not tracked) | -- |

**Key interests:**

- Sustained access to recovery support services
- Reduction of stigma and discrimination
- Multiple pathways to recovery recognized and supported
- Employment protections and second-chance hiring
- Recovery housing quality and availability

**Political power:** Moderate and increasing. Recovery advocacy has professionalized significantly since 2000. Recovery community organizations, peer recovery support specialists, and groups like Faces & Voices of Recovery are increasingly effective in state and federal policy advocacy.

## Institutional Stakeholders: Government

### Federal Agencies

| Agency | Role | Budget (SUD-Related, FY2024) | Alignment |
|--------|------|------------------------------|-----------|
| SAMHSA | Primary federal SUD treatment agency; block grants, programs, OTP oversight | $7.5 billion | Strongly pro-treatment |
| NIDA/NIH | Addiction research; evidence development | $1.6 billion | Strongly pro-treatment |
| CMS/Medicaid | Largest payer for SUD treatment; 1115 waivers | ~$18 billion (federal share) | Pro-treatment; bureaucratic |
| DEA | Controlled substance regulation; schedules; OTP registration | N/A (enforcement) | Historically cautious; enforcement-oriented |
| FDA | Medication approval; regulation of treatment products | N/A (regulatory) | Pro-medication; evidence-based |
| ONDCP | National drug control policy coordination | Coordinating role | Varies by administration |
| HRSA | Workforce development; community health centers | $380 million | Pro-treatment |
| VA | Veteran SUD treatment | $3.1 billion | Pro-treatment; MOUD advocate |
| BOP | Federal prison SUD treatment | $420 million | Limited; improving |

**Key dynamics:**

- SAMHSA and NIDA are the strongest pro-treatment voices within the federal government
- DEA historically acts as a brake on treatment expansion, particularly regarding medication access
- CMS wields enormous power through Medicaid policy; 1115 waivers have become primary vehicles for state innovation
- ONDCP's orientation varies dramatically by presidential administration

### State Governments

| Entity | Role | Key Leverage |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Governors | Set state drug policy priorities | Budgets, executive orders, Medicaid expansion |
| State legislatures | Enact treatment laws, appropriate funds | Licensing, scope of practice, Medicaid rules |
| State Medicaid agencies | Administer SUD Medicaid benefits | Covered services, reimbursement rates, network adequacy |
| State mental health/SUD agencies | Oversee treatment system, distribute block grants | Licensing, certification, quality standards |
| State attorneys general | Opioid litigation, parity enforcement | Settlement fund allocation, consumer protection |

**Key dynamics:**

- State variation in treatment access is enormous (Vermont: 48% treatment rate; Texas: 9%)
- Medicaid expansion remains the single most impactful state-level decision for SUD treatment access
- State attorneys general control billions in opioid settlement funds, with variable commitment to treatment spending
- Gubernatorial priorities can shift state approaches rapidly

## Institutional Stakeholders: Healthcare Industry

### Pharmaceutical Industry

| Stakeholder | Interest | Political Influence |
|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Indivior (buprenorphine/Sublocade)** | Market expansion; patent protection | Lobbying, advertising, provider education |
| **Alkermes (Vivitrol/naltrexone)** | Market share; MAT competition | Strong lobbying; criminal justice marketing |
| **Lyndra/other generics** | Generic buprenorphine market | Lower-cost access |
| **Emergent BioSolutions (Narcan OTC)** | Naloxone market | Consumer marketing since 2023 OTC approval |
| **Opioid manufacturers (Purdue, Endo, Mallinckrodt)** | Bankruptcy/liability resolution | Settlement negotiations; diminished direct influence |

**Key dynamics:**

- The pharmaceutical industry's relationship with drug treatment is complex: manufacturers profit from both the medications that caused the crisis (opioid painkillers) and the medications used to treat it (buprenorphine, naltrexone)
- Alkermes (Vivitrol) has controversially lobbied for naltrexone over buprenorphine/methadone, including marketing directly to criminal justice systems, where patients cannot readily choose alternatives
- Generic buprenorphine availability has reduced costs but also reduced manufacturer investment in access expansion
- Opioid settlement negotiations have reshaped the industry; Purdue Pharma dissolved; others face ongoing liability

### Insurance Industry

| Stakeholder | Interest | Political Influence |
|-------------|----------|-------------------|
| Commercial insurers (UHC, Anthem, Cigna, Aetna) | Minimize SUD treatment costs; manage utilization | Extensive lobbying; parity resistance |
| Managed Medicaid organizations | State contracts; beneficiary management | State lobbying; regulatory relationships |
| Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) | Formulary management; rebate negotiations | Medication access decisions |

**Key dynamics:**

- Insurance industry compliance with MHPAEA remains the most significant financial barrier to treatment access
- Prior authorization and utilization review practices systematically restrict SUD treatment more than comparable medical care
- Managed Medicaid organizations control access for the single largest SUD treatment population
- PBMs make formulary decisions that affect which medications are accessible and at what cost

### Treatment Provider Industry

| Provider Type | Number | Interests | Influence |
|--------------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Non-profit treatment organizations | ~8,800 | Funding, policy alignment, workforce | Moderate; advocacy-oriented |
| For-profit treatment chains | ~4,200 | Revenue, regulatory environment, market | Growing; consolidation trend |
| Opioid treatment programs (OTPs) | 2,067 | Licensing, regulation, reimbursement | Moderate; AATOD lobbying |
| Individual practitioners (MOUD) | ~130,000 | Prescribing flexibility, reimbursement | Low; dispersed |
| Recovery residence operators | ~18,000 | Funding, standards, zoning | Low but growing |

**Key dynamics:**

- The treatment industry is consolidating rapidly; private equity-backed chains have acquired hundreds of facilities since 2016
- Quality varies enormously; there is no national accreditation requirement
- The American Association for the Treatment of Opioid Dependence (AATOD) is the primary lobby for OTPs
- National Council for Mental Wellbeing and National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers represent broader provider interests

## Institutional Stakeholders: Criminal Justice

### Law Enforcement

| Entity | Position on Treatment | Key Leverage |
|--------|---------------------|-------------|
| Police chiefs associations | Increasingly supportive of treatment diversion | Local enforcement discretion |
| Prosecutors | Mixed; some champion drug courts, others prioritize prosecution | Charging decisions; plea bargaining |
| Drug courts | Treatment-oriented but limited | ~3,800 drug courts nationally |
| Federal prosecutors | Focus on supply reduction | Federal sentencing |
| Corrections departments | Slowly expanding MOUD access | Control over 1.5 million incarcerated people with SUD |

**Key dynamics:**

- Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) programs, pioneered in Seattle, represent a new model of police-to-treatment diversion now operating in 50+ jurisdictions
- Drug courts have expanded to ~3,800 nationally but serve only ~150,000 participants per year
- Correctional MOUD is expanding but remains available in only 10% of U.S. jails and 30% of state prisons
- The Major Cities Chiefs Association and International Association of Chiefs of Police have both endorsed treatment-first approaches

### Judiciary

- Federal and state judges have significant discretion in drug sentencing
- Some judges mandate treatment; others remain skeptical of MOUD
- Drug court judges are typically strong treatment advocates
- Judicial education on addiction science remains limited

### Academic and Research Community

| Institution/Organization | Contribution | Influence |
|-------------------------|--------------|-----------|
| NIDA Intramural and Extramural Programs | Foundational addiction research | Highest; sets evidence base |
| NIH HEAL Initiative | Translational research, pain/addiction | High; $1.5+ billion investment |
| Academic medical centers (addiction medicine programs) | Training, clinical research, model programs | High; evidence generation |
| Recovery Research Institute (MGH/Harvard) | Recovery science, public education | Moderate; shapes narrative |
| RAND Corporation | Drug policy research, cost-benefit analysis | High; policy credibility |
