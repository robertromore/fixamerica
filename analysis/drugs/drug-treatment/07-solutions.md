# Drug Treatment: Proposed Solutions

## Overview

The drug treatment system's failures are well-documented and their root causes well-understood. The solutions presented here are drawn from decades of research, evidence from international models, and successful U.S. state innovations. They are organized into seven domains: medication access, treatment quality, workforce development, financing reform, recovery support, system integration, and stigma reduction. Each solution includes evidence of effectiveness, implementation requirements, and estimated impact.

---

## Solution Domain 1: Expand Medication Access

### 1.1 Allow Pharmacy-Based Methadone Dispensing

**Problem addressed:** 52% of U.S. counties lack an OTP within 30 miles. Daily travel to an OTP is incompatible with employment and family obligations.

**Proposal:** Allow DEA-registered pharmacies to dispense methadone for opioid use disorder under physician prescription, as is standard in Canada, the UK, France, and Australia.

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Regulatory change required | DEA rulemaking (proposed April 2024); amendment to 42 CFR Part 8 |
| Eligible pharmacies | Those meeting security and training requirements |
| Oversight | Prescribing physician plus pharmacist monitoring |
| Implementation model | Canadian model: prescriber writes order; community pharmacy dispenses |
| Expected impact | Access within 10 miles for 90%+ of Americans vs. current 48% |
| Precedent | DEA proposed rule, April 2024; international practice in 30+ countries |

**Evidence:** In France, pharmacy-based methadone dispensing (adopted 1995) increased methadone patients from 2,000 to 60,000 within five years and reduced opioid overdose deaths by 80% over the following decade. Canada's pharmacy dispensing model serves ~65,000 patients with lower diversion rates than the U.S. OTP model.

### 1.2 Eliminate Remaining Barriers to Buprenorphine Prescribing

**Problem addressed:** Despite X-waiver removal, only ~6.5% of primary care physicians prescribe buprenorphine.

**Proposal:** Multi-pronged strategy to move buprenorphine from specialty niche to routine primary care:

| Action | Responsible Entity | Timeline |
|--------|-------------------|----------|
| Require addiction medicine content in medical education | LCME, AAMC | 2-5 years |
| Integrate buprenorphine training into residency programs | ACGME | 2-3 years |
| Fund practice support for new prescribers (clinical mentoring, hotlines) | SAMHSA, HRSA | Immediate |
| Mandate buprenorphine in FQHC formularies | HRSA | 1 year |
| Remove prior authorization requirements for buprenorphine | CMS, state insurance regulators | 1-2 years |
| Establish reimbursement parity for addiction visits | CMS, commercial insurers | 1-2 years |

**Evidence:** Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) has demonstrated that primary care clinicians with mentoring support achieve outcomes comparable to addiction specialists. Vermont's Hub-and-Spoke model increased buprenorphine access by 64% by pairing specialized hubs with primary care spokes.

### 1.3 Make Methadone Take-Home Flexibilities Permanent and Expand

**Problem addressed:** Even post-COVID reforms, initial methadone patients must attend OTPs daily, creating employment and family barriers.

**Proposal:**

- Codify COVID-era take-home flexibilities permanently (done by SAMHSA in 2024)
- Expand take-home eligibility criteria to allow clinical judgment rather than rigid time-based requirements
- Allow mobile methadone units to operate in underserved areas
- Permit telehealth assessments for stable methadone patients

**Evidence:** During COVID, expanded take-home provisions were associated with no increase in diversion, overdose, or adverse events, and were associated with improved retention in treatment (JAMA Psychiatry, 2022).

### 1.4 Expand Medications for Alcohol and Stimulant Use Disorders

**Problem addressed:** Only 9% of people with alcohol use disorder receive medication, despite three FDA-approved options. No FDA-approved medications exist for stimulant use disorders.

| Medication | Condition | Prescribing Rate | Target |
|-----------|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| Naltrexone (oral/injectable) | AUD | 9% of AUD patients | 30% |
| Acamprosate | AUD | <5% of AUD patients | 15% |
| Disulfiram | AUD | <2% of AUD patients | 5% |
| Contingency management | Stimulant UD | <10% of facilities | 50% |

**Actions:**

- Integrate AUD medication screening into primary care (SBIRT expansion)
- Fund NIH/NIDA research pipeline for stimulant use disorder medications
- Expand FDA-approved contingency management for stimulant use disorder
- CMS coverage of contingency management (following California's 2024 waiver)

---

## Solution Domain 2: Improve Treatment Quality

### 2.1 Establish National Treatment Quality Standards

**Problem addressed:** No national evidence-based quality standards exist for SUD treatment. Program quality varies enormously, and most programs do not track outcomes.

**Proposal:**

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| National quality framework | SAMHSA-developed minimum standards for all licensed SUD facilities |
| Required evidence-based practices | MOUD offered (or referral); CBT or MI; integrated mental health screening |
| Outcome measurement mandate | All programs track and report standardized patient outcomes |
| Accreditation alignment | CARF/Joint Commission standards aligned with evidence base |
| Public reporting | Treatment outcomes publicly available (like Hospital Compare) |
| Enforcement mechanism | Federal block grant funds contingent on meeting standards |

**Evidence:** The Shatterproof ATLAS program rates treatment facilities on evidence-based practice adoption and has documented significant quality variation. Countries with national treatment standards (UK, Australia) have more consistent outcomes.

### 2.2 Close the Contingency Management Gap

**Problem addressed:** Contingency management (CM)--providing tangible incentives for verified abstinence or treatment adherence--is the most effective behavioral intervention for stimulant use disorders, yet fewer than 10% of facilities offer it.

**Proposal:**

- CMS approves contingency management as a covered Medicaid benefit in all states (following California's 2024 precedent)
- SAMHSA issues clinical guidance and training resources for CM implementation
- Establish incentive limits at $599 per year to avoid anti-kickback concerns (VA model)
- Require CM training in SUD counselor certification programs

**Evidence:** CM is supported by over 100 randomized controlled trials. The VA's CM program for stimulant use disorders achieved 92% greater abstinence rates compared to standard care (JAMA Psychiatry, 2023). California's Medicaid CM program (launched 2024) is the first state-level implementation.

### 2.3 Integrate Behavioral Health and Primary Care

**Problem addressed:** SUD treatment is siloed from primary care, mental health care, and social services. 55% of people with co-occurring mental illness and SUD receive treatment in separate systems.

**Proposal:**

| Integration Model | Description | Evidence Base |
|------------------|-------------|---------------|
| Collaborative care model | Primary care-based team with behavioral health consultant | IMPACT trial: 2x improvement in depression; adapting for SUD |
| CCBHC (Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics) | Comprehensive integrated mental health and SUD clinics | SAMHSA demonstration: 24% increase in access; 16% reduction in ED visits |
| Hub-and-spoke model | Specialized addiction hubs linked to primary care spokes | Vermont: 64% increase in MOUD access |
| ED-initiated treatment | Emergency department buprenorphine initiation with warm handoff | Yale study: 78% in treatment at 30 days vs. 37% with referral alone |

**Actions:**

- Expand CCBHC model to all states (currently authorized as a demonstration)
- Fund hub-and-spoke infrastructure in all states
- Require emergency departments to screen for SUD and initiate MOUD when appropriate
- Create integrated billing codes that support team-based SUD/primary care

## Solution Domain 3: Strengthen the Workforce

### 3.1 Addiction Medicine Workforce Expansion

**Problem addressed:** The U.S. has approximately 7,300 addiction medicine and addiction psychiatry specialists--far fewer than needed.

| Action | Target | Investment |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Double addiction medicine fellowship positions | From 14 to 28 ACGME programs by 2030 | $50 million/year |
| Create addiction medicine residency track | New GME pathway for addiction-focused physicians | $30 million/year |
| Loan repayment for addiction medicine specialists | NHSC-equivalent for addiction medicine | $40 million/year |
| Integrate addiction into all primary care residencies | ACGME requirement | Regulatory change |
| Expand psychiatric NP programs with addiction focus | Double addiction-focused NP graduates | $25 million/year |

### 3.2 Counselor Workforce Stabilization

**Problem addressed:** SUD counselors earn 40% less than comparable behavioral health professionals, driving 33-50% annual turnover.

| Action | Target | Impact |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Medicaid and block grant reimbursement increases | 20% increase in SUD counselor reimbursement | Reduce turnover; increase recruitment |
| National credential portability | Mutual recognition agreements across states | Remove geographic barriers |
| Loan repayment programs | Expanded NHSC eligibility for SUD counselors | Attract graduates |
| Career ladder creation | Peer specialist to counselor to supervisor pathway | Retention and advancement |
| Burnout prevention | Mandatory supervision ratios; wellness programs | Reduce 40-60% burnout rate |

### 3.3 Peer Recovery Specialist Expansion

**Problem addressed:** Peer recovery support specialists (people with lived experience of recovery) are among the most effective treatment interventions, but the workforce is small (~30,000) and underpaid.

| Action | Target | Evidence |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Medicaid coverage in all 50 states | From 42 states to 50 | States with coverage: 3x more peers employed |
| Standardize certification nationally | National peer certification standards | Currently varies dramatically by state |
| Increase reimbursement rates | $25-$35/hour (from $18.50 average) | Reduce turnover; increase quality |
| Place peers in emergency departments | All high-overdose EDs by 2030 | 25% improvement in treatment engagement |
| Place peers in criminal justice settings | Peer specialists at point of release | Rhode Island model: 61% reduction in post-release overdose |

## Solution Domain 4: Fix Financing

### 4.1 Enforce Mental Health Parity Aggressively

**Problem addressed:** 50%+ of insurance plans violate the MHPAEA; enforcement has been weak.

| Action | Mechanism | Expected Impact |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Fund DOL parity enforcement division | Dedicated staff and budget for parity investigations | Quadruple investigation capacity |
| Private right of action | Allow patients to sue insurers for parity violations | Litigation incentive for compliance |
| State parity enforcement mandates | Require state insurance departments to conduct parity audits | Catch violations in state-regulated plans |
| Comparative analysis requirement | Plans must demonstrate parity compliance (2024 final rule) | Shift burden of proof to insurers |
| Prior authorization elimination for MOUD | Prohibit prior authorization for FDA-approved OUD medications | Immediate access improvement |
| Network adequacy standards | Define minimum SUD provider-to-member ratios | Address network adequacy violations |

**Evidence:** States with strong parity enforcement (Connecticut, New York) have 25-40% higher treatment access rates. The Kennedy Forum's model enforcement framework has been adopted by 12 states.

### 4.2 Increase SAMHSA Block Grant Funding

**Problem addressed:** The SAPT Block Grant has been flat at ~$1.86 billion since 2020, not keeping pace with inflation or the scope of the crisis.

**Proposal:** Increase SAPT Block Grant to $3.5 billion over five years, with:

- Maintenance of effort requirements for states
- Evidence-based practice adoption requirements tied to funding
- Outcome reporting requirements
- Set-aside for MOUD expansion (25% of new funding)
- Set-aside for workforce development (15% of new funding)

### 4.3 Deploy Opioid Settlement Funds Effectively

**Problem addressed:** $50+ billion in opioid settlement funds are flowing to states and localities, but there is no binding requirement to spend on evidence-based treatment.

| Action | Mechanism | Impact |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Establish minimum treatment spending requirements | Legislation or settlement modification | Prevent diversion to general funds |
| Create evidence-based spending guidelines | National model spending framework | Direct funds to effective interventions |
| Require public reporting of settlement spending | Transparency mandates | Accountability for fund deployment |
| Establish independent oversight bodies | State-level settlement fund commissions | Prevent misallocation |
| Fund evaluation of settlement-funded programs | Research investment | Build evidence base for effective deployment |

### 4.4 Expand Medicaid Coverage

**Problem addressed:** 10 states have not expanded Medicaid; 2.2 million adults in the coverage gap.

| Action | Mechanism | Impact |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Enact federal Medicaid expansion mandate | Legislation | Cover 2.2 million adults |
| Or: increase federal match for expansion states | Budget incentive | Encourage holdout states |
| Remove IMD exclusion | Legislation or CMS waiver | Expand residential capacity |
| Expand 1115 waiver authority for SUD | CMS guidance | Enable state innovation |

---

## Solution Domain 5: Strengthen Recovery Support

### 5.1 Fund Recovery Housing

**Problem addressed:** Recovery housing is effective but in short supply (~225,000 beds) and largely unfunded by public sources.

| Action | Investment | Expected Impact |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| Federal recovery housing grant program | $500 million/year | 50,000 additional beds |
| National quality standards for recovery housing | NARR standards mandated for federal funding | Quality assurance |
| Zoning preemption for recovery housing | Federal legislation under Fair Housing Act | Prevent NIMBYism |
| Recovery housing tax credits | Tax incentive for developers | Leverage private investment |

### 5.2 Employment Support Programs

**Problem addressed:** Employment is the single strongest predictor of sustained recovery, yet people with SUD face pervasive employment discrimination.

| Action | Mechanism | Evidence |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Individual Placement and Support (IPS) for SUD | SAMHSA-funded program expansion | 55-65% employment rates in IPS vs. 20-25% in traditional vocational rehab |
| Ban the Box for SUD records | Prohibit employer inquiry into SUD treatment history | Remove discrimination barriers |
| Recovery-friendly workplace certification | Federal program recognizing recovery-supportive employers | ~200 employers certified in NH model; expand nationally |
| Federal contractor recovery-friendly requirements | Executive order or legislation | Incentivize major employers |

### 5.3 Recovery-Oriented Systems of Care (ROSC)

**Problem addressed:** Treatment is episodic; recovery is a long-term process. The current system treats acute episodes but does not manage recovery over time.

**Proposal:** Fund transformation to ROSC model:

- Continuing care (step-down) for minimum 12 months post-treatment
- Recovery checkups at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months
- Peer-based recovery management
- Recovery community centers
- Recovery coaching for high-risk populations

**Evidence:** Studies show that continuing care for 12+ months reduces relapse rates by 40-60% compared to time-limited treatment (Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment, 2021).

## Solution Domain 6: System Integration

### 6.1 Criminal Justice-Treatment Integration

**Problem addressed:** 85% of incarcerated people with SUD receive no treatment; post-release overdose risk increases 12x in the first two weeks.

| Action | Model | Evidence |
|--------|-------|---------|
| Mandatory MOUD in all prisons and jails | Rhode Island statewide model | 61% reduction in post-release overdose deaths |
| Pre-release treatment planning | 90-day pre-release engagement | 30% improvement in post-release treatment retention |
| Reentry peer support | Peer specialists at point of release | 40% reduction in recidivism |
| Drug court MOUD mandate | Federal guidance; funding conditions | Eliminate MOUD restrictions in drug courts |
| LEAD (Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion) | Police diversion to treatment | 60% reduction in recidivism vs. arrest (Seattle) |

### 6.2 Emergency Department Integration

**Problem addressed:** Emergency departments see the highest-risk SUD patients but rarely initiate treatment.

**Proposal:**

- Require all hospital EDs to screen for SUD (SBIRT mandate)
- Fund ED-initiated buprenorphine programs in all hospitals with >10,000 annual visits
- Place peer recovery specialists in high-volume EDs
- Create "bridge clinic" models for immediate post-ED follow-up
- Reimburse ED buprenorphine initiation at rates that cover staff time

**Evidence:** The landmark D'Onofrio et al. study (JAMA, 2015) demonstrated that ED-initiated buprenorphine with referral resulted in 78% treatment engagement at 30 days, compared to 37% for referral alone and 45% for brief intervention.

---

## Solution Domain 7: Reduce Stigma

### 7.1 Language Reform

**Problem addressed:** Stigmatizing language in policy, medicine, and media reinforces the moral model of addiction and discourages help-seeking.

| Replace | With | Rationale |
|---------|------|-----------|
| Addict, substance abuser | Person with substance use disorder | Person-first language |
| Clean/dirty (urine tests) | Positive/negative, expected/unexpected | Removes moral judgment from clinical results |
| Drug abuse | Drug use, substance misuse | "Abuse" implies moral failing |
| Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) | Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) | Treatment is not merely "assisted" by medication |
| Opioid substitution therapy | Opioid agonist therapy | "Substitution" implies no therapeutic value |

### 7.2 Provider Training

**Problem addressed:** Healthcare provider stigma reduces quality of care for SUD patients.

| Action | Target | Investment |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Require SUD clinical rotations in medical school | All medical students | Curricular reform |
| Anti-stigma training in all healthcare education | Nursing, pharmacy, social work, psychology | Accreditation standards |
| Grand Rounds and CME on addiction medicine | All hospital systems | $10 million/year for programming |
| Patient contact-based education | Structured interaction with people in recovery | Most effective stigma reduction method |

### 7.3 Public Education Campaign

**Problem addressed:** 52% of Americans still view addiction as reflecting "lack of willpower."

**Proposal:** National public education campaign modeled on successful anti-stigma campaigns for mental illness:

- "Addiction is a medical condition" messaging
- Recovery success stories (with diverse representation)
- Evidence-based treatment information for families
- Counter-narrative to "War on Drugs" framing
- Investment: $50 million/year for five years
