# Drug Treatment: Overview

## Executive Summary

The United States faces a drug treatment crisis of staggering proportions. Approximately 48.7 million Americans aged 12 and older had a substance use disorder (SUD) in 2022, yet fewer than 25% received any form of treatment--and for many substances, the figure is closer to 10%. This "treatment gap" represents the single largest failure in the American approach to drug policy: a system that criminalizes addiction while simultaneously failing to provide the medical and behavioral interventions that decades of research have proven effective.

The consequences are measured in lives. Drug overdose deaths exceeded 107,000 in 2023, making overdose the leading cause of accidental death for Americans under 50. The economic toll reaches an estimated $1.02 trillion annually when accounting for healthcare costs, lost productivity, criminal justice expenditures, and premature mortality. Yet federal and state spending on substance use treatment totals roughly $42 billion per year--a fraction of the cost of inaction.

The science is clear. Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD)--methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone--reduce overdose mortality by 50-80%. Cognitive behavioral therapy, contingency management, and other evidence-based behavioral interventions produce sustained recovery. Recovery support services including peer specialists, recovery housing, and employment programs dramatically improve long-term outcomes. The problem is not a lack of knowledge about what works. The problem is a system that prevents these interventions from reaching the people who need them.

## Scope of This Analysis

This section examines:

- **Medication-assisted treatment (MAT/MOUD)**: Methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone access, regulation, and effectiveness
- **Behavioral therapies**: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), contingency management (CM), motivational interviewing (MI), and other evidence-based approaches
- **Treatment access and capacity**: Geographic distribution, wait times, bed availability, and workforce constraints
- **Insurance coverage and parity**: The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA), Medicaid expansion, and insurance barriers
- **Treatment workforce**: Counselor shortages, credentialing barriers, physician prescribing, and workforce development
- **Recovery support services**: Peer support, recovery housing, employment programs, and long-term recovery management
- **The treatment gap**: Why approximately 90% of people with SUD do not receive treatment
- **Evidence-based approaches**: What research shows works, and the gap between evidence and practice
- **Special populations**: Adolescents, pregnant women, justice-involved individuals, rural communities, and racial/ethnic minorities
- **Funding mechanisms**: SAMHSA block grants, Medicaid, opioid settlement funds, and private insurance

## The Core Problem

### The Treatment Gap

The treatment gap--the difference between the number of Americans who need treatment and those who receive it--is the central failure of U.S. drug policy. Multiple barriers create and sustain this gap:

| Barrier Category | Examples | Affected Population |
|-----------------|----------|-------------------|
| Structural | Insufficient treatment capacity, geographic maldistribution, workforce shortages | All individuals with SUD |
| Financial | Lack of insurance, high cost-sharing, parity violations, prior authorization denials | Uninsured and underinsured |
| Regulatory | Methadone clinic restrictions, DEA scheduling barriers, state licensing requirements | People seeking MOUD |
| Stigma | Provider attitudes, employment discrimination, housing exclusion, self-stigma | All individuals with SUD |
| Knowledge | Lack of awareness of treatment options, misinformation about medication efficacy | General public |
| Criminal justice | Incarceration without treatment, probation conditions, drug court limitations | Justice-involved individuals |

### The Medication Access Problem

Despite overwhelming evidence that MOUD is the most effective treatment for opioid use disorder, regulatory barriers severely limit access:

```text
Evidence Base                    vs.           Regulatory Reality
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
MOUD reduces mortality 50-80%                  Only 11% of SUD facilities
                                               offer all three FDA-approved
                                               medications

Buprenorphine can be prescribed                ~830 counties have no
in office settings                             buprenorphine provider

Methadone is the gold standard                 Methadone available ONLY
for severe OUD                                 at licensed OTPs with
                                               daily supervised dosing

X-waiver eliminated Jan 2023                   Many prescribers still do
                                               not offer buprenorphine
                                               due to training gaps
```

### The Quality Problem

Even when treatment is available, it often does not reflect current evidence:

| Evidence-Based Practice | Adoption Rate | Gap |
|------------------------|---------------|-----|
| MOUD for opioid use disorder | 36% of specialty facilities | 64% do not offer any medication |
| Contingency management | <10% of facilities | >90% do not use this effective approach |
| Integrated mental health/SUD treatment | 45% of facilities | 55% treat these separately |
| Recovery support services | 32% of facilities | 68% do not offer post-treatment support |
| Standardized outcome measurement | ~20% of programs | ~80% do not systematically track outcomes |

## Why This Matters

### Public Health Impact

Substance use disorders are among the leading causes of preventable death, disability, and disease in the United States:

- **Overdose**: Drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental death for Americans aged 18-45
- **Infectious disease**: 10% of new HIV infections and 50-60% of new hepatitis C infections are linked to injection drug use
- **Neonatal outcomes**: Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) increased 500% between 2004 and 2014, affecting approximately 7 per 1,000 hospital births
- **Mental health**: 9.2 million adults have co-occurring mental illness and SUD, and integrated treatment remains the exception

### Economic Impact

| Impact Category | Annual Cost | Source |
|-----------------|-------------|--------|
| Healthcare costs (SUD-related) | $295 billion | Milliman, 2022 |
| Lost workplace productivity | $350 billion | CDC/NIDA, 2022 |
| Criminal justice costs | $193 billion | NDIC, 2022 |
| Premature mortality (value of statistical life) | $180 billion | CEA, 2022 |
| **Total estimated annual cost** | **$1.02 trillion** | Surgeon General, 2023 |

### Return on Investment

Treatment is among the most cost-effective interventions in all of medicine:

| Intervention | Cost per Patient/Year | Savings per Patient/Year | ROI |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------------------|-----|
| Methadone maintenance | $6,800 | $25,200 | 3.7:1 |
| Buprenorphine treatment | $5,980 | $21,500 | 3.6:1 |
| Residential treatment | $26,000 | $52,000 | 2.0:1 |
| Outpatient treatment | $2,700 | $9,200 | 3.4:1 |
| Incarceration (no treatment) | $35,000 | -$6,400 | Negative |

*Sources: NIDA, 2020; California DHCS, 2021; RAND Corporation, 2022*

Every dollar invested in addiction treatment yields $4-$7 in reduced drug-related crime, criminal justice costs, and theft. When healthcare savings are included, the ratio can exceed 12:1.

## The Path Forward

Addressing the drug treatment crisis requires action across six dimensions:

1. **Expand access**: Eliminate regulatory barriers to MOUD, increase treatment capacity, address geographic gaps, and reduce wait times to same-day or next-day access
2. **Ensure quality**: Require evidence-based practices, implement outcome measurement, close the gap between research and practice
3. **Strengthen the workforce**: Expand training programs, create career pathways, integrate addiction medicine into primary care
4. **Fix financing**: Enforce parity, expand Medicaid coverage, increase SAMHSA block grants, deploy opioid settlement funds effectively
5. **Support recovery**: Fund peer support, recovery housing, employment programs, and long-term recovery management
6. **Reduce stigma**: Change language, train providers, reform employment and housing discrimination, integrate SUD treatment into mainstream healthcare
