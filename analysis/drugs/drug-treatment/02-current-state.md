# Drug Treatment: Current State

## The Treatment Gap

The defining feature of America's drug treatment system is the gap between need and access. In 2022, 48.7 million Americans aged 12 and older met criteria for a substance use disorder, yet only 24.1% received any form of treatment at a specialty facility. For specific substances, the gap is even more severe.

### Treatment Receipt by Substance (2022)

| Substance Use Disorder | Estimated Prevalence | Received Any Treatment | Treatment Rate |
|------------------------|---------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| Alcohol use disorder | 29.5 million | 7.6% | 2.24 million |
| Illicit drug use disorder | 27.2 million | 12.1% | 3.29 million |
| Opioid use disorder | 6.1 million | 22.4% | 1.37 million |
| Stimulant use disorder (methamphetamine) | 2.5 million | 11.2% | 280,000 |
| Stimulant use disorder (cocaine) | 1.7 million | 9.8% | 167,000 |
| Cannabis use disorder | 17.7 million | 3.4% | 602,000 |
| Any SUD | 48.7 million | 24.1% | 11.7 million |

*Note: Individuals may have multiple SUDs; totals do not sum.*

### Reasons for Not Receiving Treatment (2022)

Among the 10.3 million people who perceived a need for treatment but did not receive it:

| Reason | Percentage | Estimated Number |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| No health insurance coverage for treatment | 30.5% | 3.14 million |
| Could not afford cost | 28.7% | 2.96 million |
| Not ready to stop using | 22.3% | 2.30 million |
| Did not know where to go for treatment | 18.9% | 1.95 million |
| Concerned about negative effect on job | 16.4% | 1.69 million |
| Stigma: did not want others to find out | 15.2% | 1.57 million |
| No transportation | 12.1% | 1.25 million |
| No available programs or no openings | 10.8% | 1.11 million |
| Did not think treatment would help | 8.6% | 886,000 |
| Could not find program for specific needs | 7.3% | 752,000 |

*Source: SAMHSA, NSDUH 2022. Respondents could select multiple reasons.*

### Wait Times and Access Barriers

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Average wait for publicly funded residential treatment | 25 days | NIDA, 2023 |
| Average wait for outpatient MOUD | 8 days | JAMA Network Open, 2023 |
| Wait time for methadone initiation (non-OTP) | N/A (not permitted) | Federal regulation |
| Percentage of emergency departments offering buprenorphine initiation | 18% | Annals of Emergency Medicine, 2023 |
| Percentage of primary care physicians prescribing buprenorphine | ~6.5% | JAMA Internal Medicine, 2024 |

## Medication for Opioid Use Disorder

### FDA-Approved Medications

Three medications are approved by the FDA for treating opioid use disorder. All three are listed as essential medicines by the World Health Organization.

| Medication | Brand Names | Mechanism | Administration | Regulatory Status |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|----------------|-------------------|
| Methadone | Dolophine, Methadose | Full opioid agonist | Daily oral dosing at licensed OTP | Schedule II; dispensed only at OTPs under 42 CFR Part 8 |
| Buprenorphine | Suboxone, Sublocade, Zubsolv | Partial opioid agonist | Sublingual, injectable, implant | Schedule III; prescribable by any DEA-licensed prescriber since Jan 2023 |
| Naltrexone | Vivitrol | Opioid antagonist | Monthly injection or daily oral | Not scheduled; no special prescribing requirements |

### Buprenorphine Landscape Post X-Waiver Removal

The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 eliminated the DATA 2000 X-waiver requirement effective January 12, 2023. This was the most significant deregulatory action in the history of addiction medicine.

**Before January 2023:**

- Physicians needed a special DEA waiver (X-waiver) to prescribe buprenorphine
- Required 8 hours of training (physicians) or 24 hours (NPs/PAs)
- Patient limits: initially 30, then 100, then 275 patients per prescriber
- Only ~130,000 providers held the waiver; fewer than half actively prescribed

**After January 2023:**

- Any practitioner with a DEA license may prescribe buprenorphine for OUD
- No special waiver, training, or patient limit required
- 8-hour training requirement for new DEA registrants only (phased in)
- An estimated 1.8 million DEA-licensed practitioners theoretically eligible

**Impact Assessment (2023-2024):**

| Metric | Pre-Reform (2022) | Post-Reform (2024 est.) | Change |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|--------|
| Active buprenorphine prescribers | ~58,000 | ~130,000 | +124% |
| Patients receiving buprenorphine | ~1.1 million | ~1.6 million | +45% |
| Counties without any buprenorphine prescriber | ~1,150 | ~830 | -28% |
| Prescribers in rural areas | ~8,200 | ~16,400 | +100% |
| Emergency departments initiating buprenorphine | ~12% | ~18% | +50% |

*Sources: DEA ARCOS data, 2024; SAMHSA practitioner locator, 2024; JAMA Network Open, 2024*

While the X-waiver removal was transformative, significant gaps remain. Many newly eligible prescribers report insufficient training, discomfort managing OUD patients, or clinic infrastructure that does not support ongoing addiction care.

### Methadone Treatment

Methadone remains the most heavily regulated medication in American medicine, available only through approximately 2,067 federally certified Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs) as of 2023.

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Certified OTPs in the U.S. | 2,067 (2023) | SAMHSA OTP directory |
| Patients enrolled in OTPs | ~430,000 (2023) | SAMHSA, 2024 |
| States with <10 OTPs | 8 (WY, MT, ND, SD, AK, ID, NE, WV) | SAMHSA OTP directory |
| Counties with no OTP within 30 miles | ~1,650 (52%) | JAMA, 2023 |
| Average daily methadone dose | 80-120 mg | SAMHSA TIP 63 |
| Annual cost per patient (methadone) | $6,552-$7,560 | NIDA, 2023 |

**Regulatory burden for methadone patients:**

- Daily observed dosing required for initial patients (first 90 days minimum)
- Take-home doses earned gradually: typically 1 per week after 90 days, up to 28 days after 2 years of stability
- COVID-era flexibilities (28-day take-homes for stable patients) made permanent by SAMHSA in 2024
- DEA proposal (2024) to allow pharmacies to dispense methadone for OUD--not yet finalized

### Naltrexone Access

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Patients receiving injectable naltrexone (Vivitrol) | ~85,000 (2023) | Alkermes data, 2024 |
| Monthly cost of Vivitrol injection | $1,800-$2,200 | GoodRx, 2024 |
| Insurance coverage challenges (prior authorization) | 62% of plans | AATOD survey, 2023 |
| Programs using naltrexone for alcohol use disorder | ~22% of SUD facilities | N-SSATS, 2022 |

## Treatment Infrastructure

### Facility Types and Capacity

| Facility Type | Number | Patients Served | Average Occupancy |
|--------------|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| Outpatient (non-MOUD) | 9,241 | 2.8 million | 72% |
| Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs) | 2,067 | 430,000 | 85% |
| Residential/inpatient (short-term) | 2,892 | 184,000 (at a time) | 91% |
| Residential/inpatient (long-term) | 1,234 | 78,000 (at a time) | 88% |
| Hospital inpatient | 632 | 112,000 (at a time) | 94% |
| **Total facilities** | **16,066** | | |

### Evidence-Based Practice Adoption

| Practice | Facilities Offering | Percentage |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| Any FDA-approved medication for SUD | 5,782 | 36% |
| All three FDA-approved OUD medications | 1,767 | 11% |
| Cognitive behavioral therapy | 11,085 | 69% |
| Motivational interviewing | 10,280 | 64% |
| 12-step facilitation | 11,889 | 74% |
| Contingency management | 1,446 | 9% |
| Dialectical behavior therapy | 4,339 | 27% |
| Trauma-informed care | 6,574 | 41% |
| Integrated dual-diagnosis treatment | 7,229 | 45% |
| Telehealth services | 8,835 | 55% |

*Source: N-SSATS, 2022*

### Geographic Distribution

The distribution of treatment facilities is highly uneven across the United States:

| Region | Facilities per 100,000 Population | Relative to National Average |
|--------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Northeast | 6.8 | +42% |
| West | 5.4 | +12% |
| Midwest | 4.9 | +2% |
| South | 3.6 | -25% |
| **National average** | **4.8** | -- |

**Treatment deserts:**

- 40% of rural counties lack any SUD treatment facility
- 52% of all U.S. counties lack an OTP within 30 miles
- 27% of U.S. counties have no buprenorphine prescriber
- The South has the fewest facilities per capita despite having among the highest overdose rates

## Insurance Coverage and Parity

### Coverage Landscape

| Insurance Type | SUD Coverage | Parity Compliance | Unique Challenges |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Employer-sponsored | Required by MHPAEA (2008) | Partial--50%+ plans have violations | Network adequacy, prior authorization |
| Medicaid (expansion states) | Required by ACA | Variable by state | Low reimbursement, provider shortages |
| Medicaid (non-expansion states) | Limited | Minimal | 10 states have not expanded; adults without children often ineligible |
| Medicare | Part D covers MOUD; limited behavioral | Parity applies since 2020 | Prior auth for naltrexone, limited residential |
| ACA marketplace | Essential health benefit | Required | High deductibles, narrow networks |
| Uninsured | Self-pay only | N/A | 8.3 million uninsured Americans with SUD |

### Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA)

The MHPAEA, enacted in 2008 and strengthened by the ACA in 2010, requires insurance plans to cover mental health and substance use disorders at parity with medical/surgical benefits.

**Enforcement status (as of 2024):**

| Indicator | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Plans found in violation of MHPAEA | 50%+ | DOL investigations, 2023 |
| Comparative analyses submitted by plans (required by 2024 rule) | <30% | DOL estimate, 2024 |
| State parity enforcement actions (2020-2024) | 147 | Kennedy Forum tracker |
| Federal parity enforcement actions (2020-2024) | 23 | DOL annual reports |
| Average out-of-network utilization for SUD (vs. medical) | 5.6x higher | Milliman, 2022 |
| Prior authorization denials for SUD treatment | 29% (vs. 7% for medical) | Parity at 10 report, 2020 |

**Key parity violations identified:**

- Quantitative treatment limitations (day/visit limits for SUD not applied to medical)
- Non-quantitative treatment limitations (prior authorization, step therapy, fail-first)
- Network inadequacy (insufficient SUD providers in-network)
- Reimbursement rates (SUD providers reimbursed 20-30% less than medical counterparts)

### Medicaid and SUD Treatment

Medicaid is the single largest payer for SUD treatment in the United States.

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Medicaid beneficiaries with SUD | ~12 million | CMS, 2023 |
| Share of SUD treatment paid by Medicaid | 26% | SAMHSA, 2023 |
| States with Medicaid 1115 SUD waivers | 40 (2024) | KFF, 2024 |
| States that have expanded Medicaid | 40 + DC (2024) | KFF, 2024 |
| SUD treatment spending by Medicaid | $31 billion (FY2023) | CMS, 2024 |
| Medicaid coverage of methadone maintenance | All 50 states (since 2020) | CMS, 2023 |

**Impact of Medicaid expansion on SUD treatment:**

- Expansion states saw a 70% increase in Medicaid-funded SUD treatment admissions (2014-2020)
- Opioid-related hospitalization rates declined 11% faster in expansion states
- Overdose deaths grew 6% slower in expansion states (2014-2019)
- Uninsured rates among people with SUD dropped by 40% in expansion states

### Workforce Shortages

| Indicator | Value | Source |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Estimated additional SUD counselors needed | 40,000-60,000 | HRSA, 2023 |
| Annual turnover rate for SUD counselors | 33-50% | Addiction journal, 2022 |
| Median salary for SUD counselors | $48,520 (2023) | BLS, 2024 |
