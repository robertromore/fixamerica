# Overdose Prevention: Solutions

## Overview

The overdose crisis is the most lethal public health emergency in modern American history, but the tools to address it are well-established and evidence-based. The gap between what is known to work and what is implemented at scale is the central failure of U.S. overdose prevention policy. Closing this gap requires action across six domains: naloxone access, legal protections, drug supply monitoring, overdose response infrastructure, treatment integration, and system coordination.

This document presents solutions organized by domain, with an emphasis on specificity, evidence, and political viability. Each proposal includes its evidence base, estimated cost, and the level of government responsible for implementation.

## Domain 1: Universal Naloxone Access

### Solution 1.1: Free Naloxone Distribution Program

**Description**: Establish a federally funded program to distribute naloxone at no cost to individuals at high risk of witnessing or experiencing an overdose, and to community organizations, first responders, schools, and libraries.

**Evidence**: Community-based naloxone distribution programs reduce overdose mortality by 27-46% (Walley et al., *BMJ*, 2013; McDonald & Strang, *Addiction*, 2016). The cost per life saved ranges from $438 to $1,162, among the most cost-effective health interventions available.

**Implementation**:

- Fund through SAMHSA State Opioid Response (SOR) grants and new dedicated appropriations.
- Utilize existing community-based organizations and syringe service programs as distribution points.
- Mandate naloxone distribution at jail and prison release in all states.
- Deploy naloxone vending machines in high-overdose areas, emergency departments, and transportation hubs.
- Establish a national mail-order naloxone program for rural areas.

**Cost Estimate**: $1.5-2 billion annually (federal share, supplemented by state funds and opioid settlement dollars).

**Level of Government**: Federal (funding), state (distribution infrastructure), local (implementation).

### Solution 1.2: Naloxone Co-Prescribing Mandates

**Description**: Require healthcare providers to co-prescribe naloxone alongside any opioid prescription exceeding a defined threshold (e.g., 50 morphine milligram equivalents per day) and for any patient with a history of substance use disorder or prior overdose.

**Evidence**: Co-prescribing naloxone with opioids is associated with a 47% reduction in opioid-related emergency department visits (Coffin et al., *Annals of Internal Medicine*, 2016). Five states and the VA system have implemented co-prescribing policies with positive results.

**Implementation**:

- Amend state prescribing laws and medical board regulations.
- Include in CMS quality measures for Medicare and Medicaid.
- Integrate naloxone co-prescribing prompts into electronic health record (EHR) systems.

**Cost Estimate**: Minimal incremental cost; naloxone is covered by most insurance plans.

**Level of Government**: State (prescribing laws), federal (CMS quality measures).

### Solution 1.3: Higher-Dose Naloxone Development and Distribution

**Description**: Fund the development and distribution of higher-dose naloxone formulations (8mg intranasal or equivalent) to address the increasing potency of fentanyl and its analogs, including carfentanil and nitazenes.

**Evidence**: Standard-dose naloxone (4mg intranasal) is effective for single-agent fentanyl overdoses in 55-75% of cases with a single dose, but increasingly potent analogs and polysubstance combinations may require multiple doses. Higher initial doses improve first-dose reversal rates.

**Implementation**:

- FDA priority review for higher-dose naloxone products.
- Federal procurement contracts for higher-dose products for first responder distribution.
- Update OEND training protocols to reflect higher-dose products.

**Cost Estimate**: $200-400 million annually for procurement and distribution.

**Level of Government**: Federal (FDA, procurement), state and local (distribution).

## Domain 2: Strengthened Legal Protections

### Solution 2.1: Comprehensive Good Samaritan Law Reform

**Description**: Enact federal legislation establishing a floor of Good Samaritan protections that applies nationwide, while encouraging states to adopt broader protections. At minimum, protections should include:

- Immunity from arrest and prosecution for drug possession, paraphernalia possession, and underage alcohol consumption for anyone who calls 911 during a drug overdose.
- Immunity for the person experiencing the overdose.
- Protection from probation, parole, and pretrial release violations.
- Protection from outstanding warrants for non-violent drug offenses at the overdose scene.

**Evidence**: Good Samaritan laws are associated with a 15% reduction in opioid overdose deaths (Rees et al., *JAMA Internal Medicine*, 2021). Broader protections produce larger effects. States without protections for probation/parole violations see significantly less impact from their laws.

**Implementation**:

- Federal floor legislation under the Commerce Clause.
- Model state legislation with expanded protections.
- Mandatory training for law enforcement on Good Samaritan law provisions.
- Public awareness campaigns targeting populations at highest risk.

**Cost Estimate**: Minimal direct cost; savings from reduced overdose deaths and EMS calls.

**Level of Government**: Federal (floor), state (expanded protections), local (enforcement training).

### Solution 2.2: Repeal Drug Paraphernalia Barriers

**Description**: Remove fentanyl test strips, drug checking equipment, syringes, and other harm reduction supplies from the definition of drug paraphernalia in all state and federal law. Amend the Federal Analogue Act to explicitly exclude public health tools from paraphernalia definitions.

**Evidence**: States that have decriminalized fentanyl test strips report increased use and associated behavior change (Goldman et al., *Harm Reduction Journal*, 2023). Syringe service program legalization is associated with reduced HIV and hepatitis C transmission and does not increase drug use (Hagan et al., *Lancet Infectious Diseases*, 2011).

**Implementation**:

- Federal legislation amending 21 U.S.C. 863 to exclude harm reduction supplies.
- Model state legislation for remaining states.
- CDC guidance clarifying that harm reduction supplies are medical tools.

**Cost Estimate**: Negligible; generates savings through avoided infections and overdose deaths.

**Level of Government**: Federal (amend federal law), state (repeal paraphernalia classifications).

### Solution 2.3: Reform Drug-Induced Homicide Laws

**Description**: Limit drug-induced homicide prosecutions to cases involving commercial-scale trafficking, and include explicit safe harbor provisions protecting people who share drugs in personal-use quantities from homicide charges. Require states receiving federal overdose prevention funds to adopt these limitations.

**Evidence**: Drug-induced homicide laws are associated with reduced 911 calls during overdoses, the opposite of their intended effect (Beletsky, *American Journal of Public Health*, 2019). The majority of people prosecuted under these laws are not large-scale dealers but friends, partners, or fellow users of the deceased.

**Implementation**:

- Federal incentive legislation (conditional funding).
- Model state legislation with trafficking-threshold requirements.
- Prosecutorial guidelines distinguishing sharing from selling.

**Cost Estimate**: Minimal; may reduce prosecution costs.

**Level of Government**: Federal (funding conditions), state (law reform).

## Domain 3: Drug Supply Monitoring and Checking

### Solution 3.1: National Drug Supply Surveillance Network

**Description**: Establish a real-time national drug supply surveillance network that collects, analyzes, and disseminates information about the composition of the illicit drug supply. The network would integrate data from drug checking programs, forensic laboratories, emergency department toxicology, overdose death investigations, and DEA seizure analyses.

**Evidence**: Canada's Drug Checking Program and the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) provide models. British Columbia's drug checking network has demonstrated the ability to detect emerging adulterants weeks before they appear in overdose death data (Tupper et al., *International Journal of Drug Policy*, 2018).

**Implementation**:

- CDC as the lead federal agency, with partnerships across DEA, SAMHSA, and NIH.
- Fund drug checking sites at community organizations, emergency departments, and syringe service programs.
- Deploy FTIR and mass spectrometry at regional hubs.
- Real-time public dashboards and alerts to harm reduction organizations and people who use drugs.

**Cost Estimate**: $300-500 million annually (startup and ongoing operations).

**Level of Government**: Federal (network coordination, funding), state and local (distribution sites).

### Solution 3.2: Universal Fentanyl Test Strip Access

**Description**: Ensure universal access to fentanyl test strips by legalizing them in all 50 states, including them in naloxone distribution kits, and funding bulk procurement for community distribution.

**Evidence**: 50-70% of people who test positive for fentanyl modify their behavior to reduce risk (Goldman et al., *Harm Reduction Journal*, 2023). At $1-2 per strip, FTS are among the cheapest prevention tools available.

**Implementation**:

- Federal legislation prohibiting states from classifying FTS as paraphernalia.
- Federal procurement contracts for bulk FTS distribution through SOR grants.
- Integration of FTS into all OEND programs.

**Cost Estimate**: $50-100 million annually for universal distribution.

**Level of Government**: Federal (legalization, procurement), state and local (distribution).

## Domain 4: Overdose Response Infrastructure

### Solution 4.1: Authorize and Fund Overdose Prevention Centers

**Description**: Amend the federal "crack house" statute (21 U.S.C. 856) to create a legal pathway for state- or locally-authorized overdose prevention centers (supervised consumption facilities). Provide federal funding for a multi-site pilot program.

**Evidence**: More than 200 supervised consumption facilities operate in 14 countries. Meta-analyses consistently show reductions in overdose deaths, increases in treatment engagement, and reductions in public drug use and syringe litter (Potier et al., *Drug and Alcohol Dependence*, 2014; Kennedy et al., 2017; Cochrane review, 2023). OnPoint NYC reported 1,000+ overdose interventions and zero deaths in its first year.

**Implementation**:

- Federal legislation creating an explicit exemption for authorized facilities.
- $500 million federal pilot program for 10-20 sites in high-burden areas.
- Required evaluation component with standardized outcome measures.
- Community impact mitigation requirements for all sites.

**Cost Estimate**: $500 million over five years (pilot program); ongoing costs of $10-20 million per site annually.

**Level of Government**: Federal (legal authority, pilot funding), state and local (authorization and operation).

### Solution 4.2: Post-Overdose Response Teams

**Description**: Fund multidisciplinary post-overdose response teams (PORTs) that contact individuals within 24-72 hours of a nonfatal overdose to offer naloxone, treatment referrals, social services, and peer support. Teams should include peer recovery specialists with lived experience.

**Evidence**: Post-overdose outreach programs are associated with reduced subsequent overdose events and increased treatment engagement (Samuels et al., *Academic Emergency Medicine*, 2019). Programs in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and North Carolina have demonstrated significant reductions in repeat overdose.

**Implementation**:

- Federal grant program for POST teams, administered by SAMHSA.
- Require emergency departments to offer opt-in referrals to PORT programs.
- Integrate with existing community health worker and peer support infrastructure.

**Cost Estimate**: $200-400 million annually for national deployment.

**Level of Government**: Federal (funding), state and local (implementation).

### Solution 4.3: Institutionalize Overdose Fatality Review Teams

**Description**: Mandate and fund Overdose Fatality Review Teams (OFRTs) in every state, with standardized data collection, multi-agency participation, and mechanisms for translating findings into policy and practice changes.

**Evidence**: OFRTs identify systemic failures that contribute to overdose deaths, including missed clinical opportunities, gaps in information sharing, and failures of coordination among agencies. Currently, 150+ OFRTs operate in 30 states, but most are unfunded or underfunded and lack standardized data collection.

**Implementation**:

- Federal legislation mandating OFRTs in all states receiving SOR funds.
- Standardized data collection tools (modeled on the National OFRT Toolkit).
- Annual national synthesis report identifying cross-cutting findings.
- Requirements for local implementation of OFRT recommendations.

**Cost Estimate**: $75-150 million annually.

**Level of Government**: Federal (mandate, funding, standardization), state (implementation).

## Domain 5: Treatment Integration

### Solution 5.1: Emergency Department Buprenorphine Initiation

**Description**: Require all emergency departments that receive Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement to implement protocols for initiating buprenorphine (medication for opioid use disorder) for patients presenting with opioid overdose, and to provide naloxone and warm referrals to ongoing treatment at discharge.

**Evidence**: Emergency department initiation of buprenorphine doubles the rate of ongoing treatment engagement at 30 days (D'Onofrio et al., *JAMA*, 2015). Currently, only 35% of emergency departments have such protocols.

**Implementation**:

- CMS condition of participation for Medicare/Medicaid.
- Fund training for emergency physicians and nurses.
- Integrate buprenorphine prescribing prompts into EHR systems.
- Bridge prescription programs to cover the gap until outpatient treatment begins.

**Cost Estimate**: $200-300 million annually (training, EHR integration, bridge prescriptions).

**Level of Government**: Federal (CMS conditions, funding), state (medical board regulations).

### Solution 5.2: Jail and Prison Release Protocols

**Description**: Mandate comprehensive overdose prevention protocols for all people released from jails and prisons, including naloxone distribution, overdose education, MOUD initiation or continuation, and warm referral to community treatment.

**Evidence**: People released from incarceration have a 40-fold higher risk of fatal overdose in the two weeks following release (Binswanger et al., *NEJM*, 2007). States that have implemented jail-based MOUD programs (e.g., Rhode Island, Vermont) have seen significant reductions in post-release overdose deaths.

**Implementation**:

- Federal legislation mandating release protocols for all federal, state, and local facilities.
- Fund through Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) grants.
- Require Medicaid enrollment prior to release to ensure continuity of care.

**Cost Estimate**: $300-500 million annually.

**Level of Government**: Federal (mandate, funding), state and local (implementation).

## Domain 6: System Coordination and Surveillance

### Solution 6.1: Real-Time Overdose Surveillance System

**Description**: Build a national real-time overdose surveillance system that integrates EMS dispatch data, emergency department visits, toxicology results, and mortality data to provide near-real-time intelligence on overdose trends, geographic hot spots, and emerging threats.

**Evidence**: Near-real-time surveillance systems enable rapid response to outbreaks and emerging substances. The CDC DOSE (Drug Overdose Surveillance and Epidemiology) system provides a foundation but currently has significant latency and coverage gaps.

**Implementation**:

- Expand CDC DOSE to all 50 states and territories.
- Integrate EMS dispatch data (currently underutilized).
- Fund state and local health departments to contribute to the system.
- Public-facing dashboards for community awareness.

**Cost Estimate**: $200-300 million annually.

**Level of Government**: Federal (CDC lead), state and local (data contribution).

### Solution 6.2: Xylazine and Novel Substance Response

**Description**: Develop a comprehensive federal response to xylazine and other non-opioid adulterants, including research on reversal agents, clinical guidance for treatment of xylazine-associated wounds, public health alerts, and expanded drug checking capacity.

**Evidence**: Xylazine-involved deaths increased 1,127% between 2020 and 2023. There is currently no FDA-approved reversal agent for xylazine in humans. The DEA designated xylazine as an "emerging threat" in 2023 but has not scheduled it.

**Implementation**:

- NIH expedited research funding for xylazine reversal agents (tolazoline and others).
- CDC clinical guidance for xylazine wound care.
- SAMHSA funding for mobile wound care units in high-xylazine areas.
- Integration of xylazine testing into drug checking programs.

**Cost Estimate**: $300-500 million over five years.

**Level of Government**: Federal (research, guidance, funding).
