# Overdose Prevention: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

The legislative landscape for overdose prevention is a patchwork of federal and state laws that has expanded significantly since 2010 but remains inadequate to the scale of the crisis. This document presents draft federal legislation, model state legislation, and regulatory recommendations designed to close the critical gaps that contribute to preventable overdose deaths. The proposals are organized by priority and designed to be politically viable, building on the bipartisan foundation established by the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA, 2016) and the SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act (2018).

## Federal Legislation

### Bill 1: Overdose Prevention and Good Samaritan Act

**Purpose**: Establish a federal floor for Good Samaritan protections that applies to all drug overdose emergency calls, ensuring that no American dies because a witness was afraid to call 911.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Overdose Prevention and Good
Samaritan Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in
the United States, claiming more than 100,000 lives annually.
(2) Research demonstrates that fear of arrest or prosecution is
the primary reason witnesses fail to call 911 during a drug
overdose.
(3) States with Good Samaritan laws experience approximately 15
percent fewer opioid overdose deaths.
(4) As of the date of enactment of this Act, 2 States lack any
Good Samaritan law, and most State laws contain significant
gaps in their protections.

SEC. 3. FEDERAL GOOD SAMARITAN PROTECTIONS.

(a) IN GENERAL.—No person shall be subject to arrest,
prosecution, or penalty under Federal law for a controlled
substance offense arising from the same circumstances as a
good-faith request for emergency medical assistance for a
drug overdose, provided that—
    (1) the person placed the call to emergency services or
    otherwise sought emergency medical assistance in good
    faith;
    (2) the person remained at the scene until emergency
    medical services arrived; and
    (3) the person cooperated with emergency medical
    personnel.

(b) SCOPE OF PROTECTION.—The protections under subsection
(a) shall apply to—
    (1) the person who called for emergency assistance;
    (2) the person experiencing the drug overdose;
    (3) any person who administered naloxone or other opioid
    antagonist to the person experiencing the overdose; and
    (4) any other person present at the scene who cooperated
    with emergency medical personnel.

(c) COVERED OFFENSES.—The protections under subsection (a)
shall apply to—
    (1) possession of a controlled substance in a quantity
    consistent with personal use;
    (2) possession of drug paraphernalia;
    (3) being under the influence of a controlled substance;
    (4) violation of conditions of pretrial release, probation,
    parole, or supervised release related to substance use;
    and
    (5) minor outstanding warrants for nonviolent offenses.

(d) EXCLUSIONS.—The protections under subsection (a) shall not
apply to—
    (1) offenses involving the manufacture or distribution of
    controlled substances in quantities exceeding personal
    use;
    (2) offenses involving violence or threats of violence; or
    (3) offenses involving the operation of a motor vehicle
    while impaired.

(e) NALOXONE ADMINISTRATION.—No person shall be subject to
civil or criminal liability for administering naloxone or
another opioid antagonist to a person reasonably believed to
be experiencing a drug overdose, regardless of the outcome.

SEC. 4. INCENTIVES FOR STATE COMPLIANCE.

(a) GRANT CONDITIONS.—Beginning 2 years after the date of
enactment of this Act, no State shall be eligible for grants
under the State Opioid Response program (42 U.S.C. 290ee-3)
unless the State has enacted a Good Samaritan law that provides
protections no less comprehensive than those established in
Section 3 of this Act.

(b) TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.—The Secretary of Health and Human
Services shall provide technical assistance to States in
drafting and enacting compliant legislation.

SEC. 5. LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING.

(a) IN GENERAL.—The Attorney General, in consultation with the
Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall develop and
disseminate training materials for Federal, State, and local
law enforcement officers on the provisions and intent of Good
Samaritan laws.

(b) FUNDING.—There are authorized to be appropriated $25,000,000
for each of fiscal years 2026 through 2030 to carry out this
section.

SEC. 6. PUBLIC AWARENESS CAMPAIGN.

(a) IN GENERAL.—The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall
conduct a national public awareness campaign to educate the
public about Good Samaritan protections and the importance of
calling 911 during a drug overdose.

(b) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.—There are authorized to be
appropriated $15,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2026 through
2028 to carry out this section.
```

**Explanation**: This bill establishes federal protections that serve as a floor, not a ceiling. States may enact broader protections. The bill addresses the most critical gaps in existing state laws: probation/parole violation immunity, warrant protections, and protection for the person experiencing the overdose. Grant conditions incentivize state compliance without federal preemption.

**Potential Challenges**:

- Federalism concerns: Some may argue that drug possession is primarily a state matter. The bill uses the Commerce Clause and federal grant conditions rather than direct preemption.
- Enforcement: Federal law cannot directly control state and local police behavior. The grant conditions and training provisions are designed to create incentives rather than mandates.

**Refinements**:

- Consider including a private right of action for individuals whose Good Samaritan protections are violated.
- Add data collection requirements for 911 calls and outcomes.

---

### Bill 2: Comprehensive Naloxone Access Act

**Purpose**: Ensure universal access to naloxone by funding a national free distribution program, mandating co-prescribing, and eliminating legal barriers.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Comprehensive Naloxone Access Act".

SEC. 2. NATIONAL NALOXONE DISTRIBUTION PROGRAM.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Secretary of Health and Human Services,
acting through the Administrator of the Substance Abuse and
Mental Health Services Administration, shall establish a
National Naloxone Distribution Program to provide naloxone at
no cost to—
    (1) community-based organizations;
    (2) syringe service programs;
    (3) State and local health departments;
    (4) emergency departments;
    (5) first responder agencies;
    (6) correctional facilities;
    (7) schools and institutions of higher education;
    (8) libraries, shelters, and other community facilities;
    and
    (9) individuals at elevated risk of witnessing or
    experiencing a drug overdose.

(b) PROCUREMENT.—The Secretary shall procure naloxone for the
program through competitive bidding, negotiated pricing, or
such other mechanisms as the Secretary determines appropriate
to achieve the lowest practicable cost.

(c) MAIL-ORDER DISTRIBUTION.—The program shall include a
mail-order component to ensure access in rural and underserved
areas.

(d) VENDING MACHINES.—The Secretary shall deploy automated
naloxone distribution devices (vending machines) in not fewer
than 2,000 high-traffic locations within 2 years of enactment.

(e) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.—There are authorized to be
appropriated—
    (1) $2,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2026;
    (2) $2,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2027; and
    (3) such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 2028
    through 2030.

SEC. 3. CO-PRESCRIBING REQUIREMENT.

(a) MEDICARE AND MEDICAID.—The Secretary shall, as a condition
of participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, require
that any provider prescribing an opioid analgesic at a dosage
exceeding 50 morphine milligram equivalents per day, or to a
patient with a documented history of substance use disorder or
prior overdose, shall also prescribe or offer naloxone.

(b) PRIVATE INSURANCE.—Each group health plan and health
insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance
coverage shall provide coverage for naloxone without prior
authorization or cost-sharing when prescribed or dispensed
pursuant to subsection (a) or a standing order.

SEC. 4. CORRECTIONAL FACILITY REQUIREMENTS.

(a) FEDERAL FACILITIES.—The Director of the Bureau of Prisons
shall ensure that every person released from a Federal
correctional facility receives—
    (1) naloxone;
    (2) overdose education training;
    (3) an offer of medication for opioid use disorder; and
    (4) a warm referral to community-based treatment and
    support services.

(b) STATE AND LOCAL INCENTIVES.—Beginning 3 years after the date
of enactment of this Act, no State shall be eligible for grants
under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program
(42 U.S.C. 3751) unless the State requires that all State and
local correctional facilities provide naloxone and overdose
education to persons upon release.

SEC. 5. HIGHER-DOSE NALOXONE.

(a) The Secretary, acting through the Commissioner of Food and
Drugs, shall prioritize the review and approval of naloxone
formulations with dosages exceeding 4 milligrams (intranasal
equivalent) designed to address overdoses involving high-potency
synthetic opioids.

(b) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.—There are authorized to be
appropriated $50,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2026 through
2028 to support the development and procurement of higher-dose
naloxone formulations.
```

**Explanation**: This bill addresses the three primary barriers to naloxone access: cost, availability, and awareness. Free distribution ensures that price is not a barrier. Co-prescribing reaches people in the healthcare system. Correctional facility requirements target the highest-risk population (post-release). Higher-dose provisions address the evolving fentanyl threat.

**Potential Challenges**:

- Cost: The $2 billion annual appropriation is significant, though it represents less than 0.2% of the estimated annual cost of the crisis.
- Pharmaceutical industry: Bulk procurement may face industry opposition if it reduces unit prices.
- Correctional facilities: State and local facilities may resist unfunded mandates. The bill uses grant conditions rather than direct mandates.

### Bill 3: Drug Safety and Checking Act

**Purpose**: Remove federal legal barriers to drug checking services and fund a national drug supply surveillance network.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Drug Safety and Checking Act".

SEC. 2. AMENDMENT TO FEDERAL PARAPHERNALIA LAW.

(a) EXEMPTION.—Section 863 of title 21, United States Code, is
amended by adding at the end the following:

"(g) EXEMPTION FOR PUBLIC HEALTH TOOLS.—The term 'drug
paraphernalia' as used in this section shall not include—
    (1) fentanyl test strips, immunoassay test strips, or
    other reagent-based testing materials designed to detect
    the presence of fentanyl or its analogs;
    (2) drug checking equipment, including but not limited to
    Fourier-transform infrared spectrometers, mass
    spectrometers, and other analytical instruments used to
    identify the composition of substances for public health
    purposes;
    (3) sterile syringes, needles, and other injection
    equipment distributed by authorized syringe service
    programs; or
    (4) naloxone or other opioid antagonists."

SEC. 3. PREEMPTION.

(a) No State or political subdivision of a State may classify
as drug paraphernalia any item described in Section 2(a) of
this Act.

SEC. 4. NATIONAL DRUG SUPPLY SURVEILLANCE NETWORK.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—The Director of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention shall establish a National Drug Supply
Surveillance Network to collect, analyze, and disseminate
real-time information about the composition of the illicit
drug supply in the United States.

(b) COMPONENTS.—The Network shall include—
    (1) data from community-based drug checking programs;
    (2) forensic laboratory analyses from law enforcement
    seizures;
    (3) emergency department toxicology data;
    (4) medical examiner and coroner toxicology data; and
    (5) data from the Drug Enforcement Administration.

(c) PUBLIC REPORTING.—The Director shall publish real-time
alerts and weekly summary reports on emerging drug supply
threats, accessible to the public, harm reduction organizations,
and healthcare providers.

(d) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.—There are authorized to be
appropriated $300,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2026 through
2030 to carry out this section.

SEC. 5. GRANT PROGRAM FOR DRUG CHECKING SERVICES.

(a) The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall award
grants to community-based organizations, syringe service
programs, and public health departments to operate drug
checking services using fentanyl test strips, FTIR
spectrometry, or other analytical methods.

(b) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.—There are authorized to be
appropriated $100,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2026 through
2030 to carry out this section.
```

**Explanation**: This bill takes the critical step of preempting state paraphernalia laws that classify harm reduction tools as illegal. Federal preemption is necessary because a state-by-state approach has left eight states with dangerous gaps. The surveillance network addresses the fundamental problem that the drug supply evolves faster than existing detection systems can track.

**Potential Challenges**:

- Federalism: Federal preemption of state paraphernalia laws will face states' rights objections. The Commerce Clause and the spending power provide constitutional authority.
- DEA cooperation: The DEA may resist sharing seizure data with a public health surveillance network. Mandatory data sharing provisions address this.

### Bill 4: Overdose Prevention Center Authorization Act

**Purpose**: Amend the federal "crack house" statute to create a legal pathway for state- or locally-authorized overdose prevention centers (supervised consumption facilities).

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Overdose Prevention Center
Authorization Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) More than 200 supervised consumption facilities operate
in 14 countries. No facility has ever recorded a death from
overdose on site.
(2) Meta-analyses and systematic reviews consistently
demonstrate that supervised consumption facilities reduce
overdose deaths, increase treatment engagement, and reduce
public drug use and discarded syringes without increasing
drug use or crime in surrounding areas.
(3) OnPoint NYC, the first authorized facility in the United
States, intervened in more than 1,000 overdose events and
recorded zero deaths in its first year of operation.
(4) Section 856 of title 21, United States Code, has been
interpreted to prohibit supervised consumption facilities,
creating a conflict between Federal drug law and evidence-based
public health practice.

SEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO SECTION 856.

Section 856 of title 21, United States Code, is amended by
adding at the end the following:

"(e) EXEMPTION FOR AUTHORIZED OVERDOSE PREVENTION CENTERS.—

    (1) IN GENERAL.—Subsections (a) and (b) shall not apply to
    the operation of an overdose prevention center that—

        (A) is authorized by the law of the State, territory,
        or Indian Tribe in which it is located;

        (B) is operated by or under contract with a State or
        local government agency, nonprofit organization, or
        healthcare facility;

        (C) provides on-site medical supervision by trained
        personnel capable of responding to drug overdose;

        (D) offers referrals to substance use disorder
        treatment, including medication for opioid use disorder;

        (E) complies with applicable State and local health,
        safety, and zoning regulations; and

        (F) submits annual reports to the Secretary of Health
        and Human Services documenting the number of visits,
        overdose interventions, treatment referrals, and adverse
        events.

    (2) NO FEDERAL REQUIREMENT.—Nothing in this subsection
    shall be construed to require any State, territory, or
    Indian Tribe to authorize overdose prevention centers."

SEC. 4. FEDERAL PILOT PROGRAM.

(a) The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall award
competitive grants for the establishment and operation of
overdose prevention centers in not fewer than 10 and not more
than 20 high-burden jurisdictions.

(b) EVALUATION.—The Secretary shall fund an independent,
rigorous evaluation of the pilot program, with interim reports
at 2 and 4 years and a final report at 5 years.

(c) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.—There are authorized to be
appropriated $100,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2026 through
2030 to carry out this section.
```

**Explanation**: This bill takes a permissive rather than mandatory approach, creating a federal exemption for state-authorized facilities without requiring any state to establish them. This respects federalism principles while removing the federal legal barrier that prevents willing states from acting. The pilot program provides federal funding and evaluation to build the evidence base.

**Potential Challenges**:

- Political opposition: Supervised consumption is the most politically contentious overdose prevention intervention. Framing as a state-option approach may reduce opposition.
- Legal: The Third Circuit's decision in *United States v. Safehouse* (2021) held that 21 U.S.C. 856 prohibits supervised consumption. This bill directly amends the statute to resolve the conflict.

## State Model Legislation

### Model Act 1: Comprehensive Good Samaritan Overdose Prevention Act

**Purpose**: Provide model state legislation that exceeds the federal floor.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "[State] Comprehensive Good
Samaritan Overdose Prevention Act".

SECTION 2. DEFINITIONS.

(a) "Drug overdose" means an acute medical condition resulting

## Regulatory Framework

### FDA: Higher-Dose Naloxone Priority Review

**Existing Authority**: The FDA has authority under 21 U.S.C. 356 to grant priority review to drugs that address unmet medical needs.

**Recommendation**: The FDA should designate higher-dose naloxone formulations (8mg intranasal or equivalent) for priority review, recognizing that the increasing potency of synthetic opioids creates an unmet need for more effective reversal products. The FDA should also explore emergency use authorization pathways for rapid deployment of new naloxone formulations.

### CMS: Emergency Department Buprenorphine Initiation

**Existing Authority**: CMS has authority to establish conditions of participation for facilities receiving Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement (42 CFR Parts 482, 485).

**Recommendation**: CMS should issue a condition of participation requiring all hospitals that operate emergency departments to establish protocols for initiating buprenorphine or offering medication for opioid use disorder to patients presenting with opioid overdose or opioid use disorder. Hospitals should also be required to provide naloxone at discharge to all patients treated for overdose.

### DEA: Xylazine Classification

**Existing Authority**: The DEA has authority to schedule substances under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 811).

**Recommendation**: The DEA should not schedule xylazine as a controlled substance, as scheduling would likely increase criminalization of people who use drugs without reducing xylazine availability (which is cheap, legal in veterinary contexts, and easily obtained). Instead, the DEA should issue an "emerging threat" designation with associated public health reporting requirements, and HHS should lead research into reversal agents and harm reduction strategies.

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

- **Commerce Clause**: Federal legislation on naloxone access, paraphernalia preemption, and Good Samaritan protections is supported by the Commerce Clause, given the interstate nature of the drug supply and the economic impact of the overdose crisis.
- **Spending Power**: Conditional grant provisions (linking SOR and Byrne JAG funding to state compliance) are permissible under *South Dakota v. Dole* (1987) and subsequent precedent, provided conditions are related to the purpose of the grant and do not constitute coercion.
- **Section 856 Amendment**: Amending 21 U.S.C. 856 to permit supervised consumption is straightforwardly constitutional, as Congress has the power to define the scope of federal criminal law.

### Preemption Questions

- Federal preemption of state paraphernalia laws (Bill 3) is the most legally aggressive proposal. It is justified by the direct conflict between state paraphernalia laws and federal overdose prevention goals, and by the Commerce Clause.
- Good Samaritan floor legislation (Bill 1) does not preempt broader state protections; it establishes a minimum standard.

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- Grant conditions are the primary enforcement mechanism for state compliance.
- Good Samaritan law violations by law enforcement could be addressed through a private right of action (included as a refinement option in Bill 1).
- CMS conditions of participation are enforced through survey and certification processes.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Overdose Prevention and Good Samaritan Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| "Personal use" ambiguity | The distinction between personal use and distribution quantities is not defined, potentially allowing prosecutors to circumvent protections | High |
| Warrant exception scope | Protection for "nonviolent offense" warrants may be interpreted narrowly | Medium |
| Federal-only direct application | Direct protections apply only to federal offenses; state protections depend on grant conditions | High |
| "Good faith" interpretation | Subjective standard may be interpreted differently by different courts | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|---|---|---|
| Cannot compel state law enforcement behavior | Police practices at overdose scenes may not change despite legal protections | Federalism; limited federal authority over state/local police |
| 2-year compliance timeline | States may take the full 2 years, leaving gaps in protection | Political compromise necessary for passage |
| Awareness gap not fully addressed | Funding for awareness campaigns may be insufficient to reach most-at-risk populations | Budget limitations |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Define "personal use quantity" by reference to DEA thresholds or establish a statutory quantity (e.g., 5 grams or less of any substance).
2. Expand warrant exception to cover all non-felony warrants.
3. Add a private right of action allowing individuals to sue for damages if their Good Samaritan protections are violated.
4. Increase public awareness funding to $50 million annually and require targeted outreach to populations experiencing homelessness, incarceration, and poverty.

### Comprehensive Naloxone Access Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| Procurement gaming | Pharmaceutical companies may raise base prices to offset bulk procurement discounts | Medium |
| Co-prescribing opt-out | Providers may find ways to avoid co-prescribing requirements (e.g., documenting patient refusal without genuinely offering) | Medium |
| Correctional compliance gaps | State and local facilities may comply nominally without implementing effective programs | High |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|---|---|---|
| Does not guarantee free OTC naloxone | OTC price remains $44.99 for uninsured individuals outside the distribution program | FDA OTC approval does not control pricing |
| Higher-dose products not yet available | Even with priority review, new formulations may take 2-3 years | Regulatory timelines |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Include "most favored nation" pricing provisions in federal procurement contracts.
2. Add an audit requirement for co-prescribing compliance, with penalties for systematic non-compliance.
3. Require independent monitoring of correctional facility compliance, with on-site inspections.

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|---|---|
| Workforce shortages in harm reduction | Fund peer specialist credentialing programs and competitive wages |
| Grant-dependent sustainability | Transition from short-term grants to permanent authorization and appropriation |
| Data integration barriers | Establish national data standards for overdose surveillance and mandate interoperability |
| Political vulnerability to administration changes | Design programs with automatic triggers and permanent authorization rather than discretionary funding |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

- All authorized programs should include 5-year reauthorization reviews with mandatory GAO evaluation.
- The National Drug Supply Surveillance Network should provide annual reports to Congress on emerging threats and system performance.
- Supervised consumption pilot programs should include independent evaluation at 2, 4, and 5 years, with results published and available for congressional review.
