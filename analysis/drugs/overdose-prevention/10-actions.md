# Overdose Prevention: Actions

## Overview

Overdose prevention is one of the few policy areas where individual citizens can directly save lives through personal action, regardless of political affiliation or policy position. This document provides specific, actionable steps that individuals, families, and communities can take at every level, from carrying naloxone to advocating for legislative reform. Actions are organized by level of engagement: immediate personal action, community engagement, and systemic advocacy.

## Immediate Personal Actions

### 1. Get Naloxone and Learn to Use It

Naloxone (brand name Narcan) is available over the counter at most pharmacies without a prescription. It reverses opioid overdoses within minutes and has no potential for abuse.

**Steps**:

- Purchase OTC Narcan ($44.99 for a 2-pack) at any pharmacy, or obtain free naloxone from a community organization (find one at https://nextdistro.org/naloxone).
- If cost is a barrier, many state and local programs distribute naloxone at no charge. Call your local health department or search the SAMHSA helpline (1-800-662-4357).
- Watch the 5-minute training video at https://www.narcan.com/how-to-use or attend a free in-person training through a local harm reduction organization.
- Keep naloxone in your home, car, workplace, or backpack. It is safe, legal, and easy to carry.
- Replace naloxone every 2 years (check expiration date, though expired naloxone is still likely to be partially effective).

**Who should carry naloxone**:

- Anyone who has a friend or family member who uses drugs, prescribed or otherwise.
- Anyone who takes prescription opioids, including for chronic pain.
- Parents of teenagers and young adults.
- Anyone who works in a profession with elevated drug use risk (hospitality, construction, healthcare).
- Anyone who wants to be prepared to help a stranger in an emergency.

### 2. Learn to Recognize an Overdose

**Signs of opioid overdose**:

- Slow, shallow, or no breathing
- Blue or grayish lips and fingertips
- Unresponsive to noise or touch
- Gurgling, choking, or snoring sounds
- Pinpoint pupils
- Limp body

**What to do**:

1. Call 911 immediately. Good Samaritan laws protect you in 48 states and D.C.
2. Administer naloxone. Spray one dose into one nostril.
3. Perform rescue breathing if the person is not breathing.
4. Place the person in the recovery position (on their side) to prevent choking.
5. If no improvement in 2-3 minutes, administer a second dose of naloxone.
6. Stay with the person until EMS arrives.

**Important**: Naloxone is only effective for opioid overdoses. If the person has also taken xylazine, benzodiazepines, or other non-opioid substances, they may not respond fully. Continue rescue breathing and wait for EMS.

### 3. Get and Use Fentanyl Test Strips

If you or someone you know uses any drug that was not obtained from a pharmacy, fentanyl test strips can detect the presence of fentanyl.

**How to use**:

1. Dissolve a small amount of the drug in water (specific ratios vary by drug type; consult DanceSafe at https://dancesafe.org/fentanyl-test-strips/).
2. Dip the test strip for 15 seconds.
3. Wait 2-5 minutes and read the result. Two lines = negative (no fentanyl detected). One line = positive (fentanyl detected).
4. A negative result does not guarantee safety but significantly reduces risk.

**Cost**: $1-2 per strip. Available at https://dancesafe.org, many syringe service programs, and some pharmacies.

**Legal status**: Fentanyl test strips are legal in 42 states and D.C. Check your state at https://pdaps.org.

### 4. Know Your State's Good Samaritan Law

**Why it matters**: If you witness an overdose, fear of arrest is the biggest barrier to calling 911. Knowing your legal protections can save a life.

**Steps**:

- Look up your state's law at https://pdaps.org/datasets/good-samaritan-overdose-laws.
- Know what your law covers (arrest, prosecution, probation violations) and what it does not.
- If your state does not have a Good Samaritan law (Kansas, Wyoming), advocate for one (see Systemic Advocacy below).
- Share this information with anyone who uses drugs or might witness an overdose.

### 5. Talk to Your Family

**For parents**:

- Talk to your children about the reality of the drug supply. Counterfeit pills that look identical to prescription medications may contain lethal doses of fentanyl. Any pill not obtained from a pharmacy should be assumed to be potentially fatal.
- Do not rely on scare tactics. Evidence-based prevention (see SAMHSA's Talk. They Hear You. campaign) is more effective.
- Keep naloxone in your home, especially if you have teenagers or young adults.

**For families of people with substance use disorder**:

- Carry naloxone and ensure other family members do as well.
- Learn about medication-assisted treatment (buprenorphine, methadone, naltrexone) and support your loved one's access to it if they choose treatment.
- Connect with family support organizations such as Shatterproof (https://www.shatterproof.org), GRASP (https://grfrsp.org), or Nar-Anon (https://www.nar-anon.org).
- Reject the false choice between "enabling" and "cutting off." Supporting overdose prevention is not enabling; it is keeping your loved one alive.

## Community Engagement

### 6. Support Local Harm Reduction Organizations

Harm reduction organizations are the frontline of overdose prevention, and most are severely underfunded.

**Steps**:

- Find local organizations at https://harmreduction.org or through your local health department.
- Volunteer your time (naloxone distribution, outreach, administrative support).
- Donate money. Even small donations make a significant difference for organizations operating on shoestring budgets.
- Amplify their work on social media and in your community.

### 7. Advocate for Naloxone Access in Your Community

**Steps**:

- Ask your local library, community center, or house of worship to host naloxone training events.
- Advocate for naloxone vending machines in public locations (bus stations, community colleges, shelters).
- Encourage your employer to include naloxone in workplace first aid kits.
- Ask your school district whether naloxone is available in school nurse offices and whether staff are trained in its use.
- If your community has a police department that does not carry naloxone (rare but still the case in some small departments), contact your local government to request it.

### 8. Support Overdose Prevention Policies Locally

**Steps**:

- Attend city council and county board meetings when harm reduction policies are discussed.
- If a syringe service program, naloxone distribution site, or overdose prevention center is proposed in your community, support it publicly. NIMBY opposition is one of the biggest barriers to effective prevention.
- Write letters to the editor or op-eds supporting evidence-based overdose prevention.
- If your community has an overdose fatality review team, inquire about its findings and whether recommendations are being implemented.

### 9. Participate in Overdose Awareness Events

**International Overdose Awareness Day**: August 31 each year. Events include vigils, naloxone training, and advocacy actions.

**Steps**:

- Attend or organize a local event (resources at https://www.overdoseday.com).
- Share stories of loss and recovery to humanize the crisis and reduce stigma.
- Use the day to distribute naloxone and information about local resources.

## Systemic Advocacy

### 10. Contact Your Elected Officials

**Federal Priorities**:

- Fund the national free naloxone distribution program at $2 billion annually.
- Pass the federal Good Samaritan floor legislation.
- Amend 21 U.S.C. 856 to allow state-authorized supervised consumption facilities.
- Amend 21 U.S.C. 863 to exclude harm reduction supplies from the paraphernalia definition.
- Permanently reauthorize and fund the State Opioid Response (SOR) grants.

**State Priorities** (varies by state):

- Enact or strengthen Good Samaritan laws, including protection from probation/parole violations.
- Legalize fentanyl test strips (if your state is among the 8 holdouts).
- Fund naloxone distribution through state health departments.
- Require naloxone distribution at jail and prison release.
- Authorize supervised consumption facilities (following Rhode Island's model).

**How to contact**:

- Find your federal representatives at https://www.congress.gov/members/find-your-member.
- Find your state legislators at https://openstates.org.
- Phone calls are more effective than emails. A brief, personal message is most impactful.
- Reference specific bills by name and number when possible.

### 11. Support Candidates Who Prioritize Overdose Prevention

**Questions to ask candidates**:

- Do you support expanding naloxone access, including free distribution?
- Do you support comprehensive Good Samaritan laws that protect people from arrest when they call 911?
- Do you support legalizing fentanyl test strips?
- Do you support medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder?
- Do you believe the overdose crisis is primarily a public health issue or a criminal justice issue?

### 12. Advocate for Opioid Settlement Fund Accountability

Tens of billions of dollars in opioid settlement funds are being distributed to state and local governments. How these funds are spent will significantly shape overdose prevention for the next decade.

**Steps**:

- Research how your state and locality are spending settlement funds. Resources at https://www.opioidsettlementtracker.com.
- Advocate for allocation to evidence-based prevention and treatment rather than law enforcement or general government purposes.
- Attend public hearings on settlement fund allocation.
- Monitor compliance with settlement agreements that specify how funds should be used.

### 13. Challenge Stigma

Stigma is the single greatest barrier to effective overdose prevention. Every conversation that humanizes people who use drugs and reframes addiction as a health condition rather than a moral failing contributes to political support for evidence-based policy.

**Steps**:

- Use person-first language: "person with a substance use disorder" rather than "addict" or "junkie."
- Share factual information about harm reduction, naloxone, and treatment with your social network.
- Push back when you hear stigmatizing language or "tough love" rhetoric that conflicts with evidence.
- If you are a person in recovery, consider sharing your story publicly if you are comfortable doing so. Personal narratives are the most powerful tool for reducing stigma.
