# Overdose Prevention

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of overdose prevention policy in the United States, examining the tools, programs, and legal frameworks designed to reduce the catastrophic toll of drug overdose deaths.

## Overview

The United States is experiencing an unprecedented overdose crisis, with more than 100,000 Americans dying from drug overdoses annually since 2021. The crisis has been driven primarily by the proliferation of illicitly manufactured fentanyl and its analogs, which now account for more than 70% of all overdose fatalities. Overdose prevention encompasses a broad range of interventions, from naloxone distribution and Good Samaritan immunity laws to fentanyl test strips, overdose education programs, and emerging responses to novel substances such as xylazine.

This analysis examines the current landscape of overdose prevention, the historical evolution of the crisis and the policy responses it has generated, the systemic root causes that perpetuate preventable deaths, and the evidence-based solutions that could dramatically reduce mortality.
