# Overdose Prevention: Stakeholders

## Overview

Overdose prevention involves a diverse and often conflicting set of stakeholders, from federal agencies and pharmaceutical companies to harm reduction workers and people who use drugs themselves. Understanding the interests, power, and positions of these stakeholders is essential to crafting politically viable and operationally effective prevention strategies. This analysis maps the key actors, their roles, their incentives, and the tensions among them.

## Federal Government

### Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)

- **Role**: The lead federal agency for substance use prevention and treatment. Administers the State Opioid Response (SOR) grants ($1.5 billion in FY2024), the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant (SABG), and the Tribal Opioid Response (TOR) grants.
- **Interests**: Expanding access to treatment and harm reduction services; maintaining bipartisan support for its mission.
- **Power**: Significant through grant funding, guidance documents, and technical assistance. Its 2021 guidance permitting federal funds for fentanyl test strips was a major policy shift.
- **Limitations**: Subject to political pressure from the White House and Congress. Funding decisions reflect political priorities as much as public health evidence.

### Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)

- **Role**: Provides overdose surveillance data (WONDER database, NVSS), funds state prevention through the Overdose Data to Action (OD2A) program ($487 million in FY2024), and issues clinical guidance.
- **Interests**: Evidence-based prevention; accurate surveillance; rapid detection of emerging threats.
- **Power**: Data authority is critical; CDC data drives funding decisions and media coverage. OD2A grants support state-level surveillance and response infrastructure.
- **Limitations**: Chronic underfunding; limited ability to mandate state or local action; data often delayed 6-12 months.

### Food and Drug Administration (FDA)

- **Role**: Regulates naloxone and other overdose reversal medications. Made the landmark decision to approve OTC naloxone (Narcan) in March 2023 and RiVive in March 2024.
- **Interests**: Drug safety and efficacy; expanding access to lifesaving medications; balancing pharmaceutical innovation with public health.
- **Power**: Exclusive authority over drug approval and labeling. The OTC switch was transformative for naloxone access.
- **Limitations**: Cannot control retail pricing; regulatory process is slow relative to the pace of the crisis.

### Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)

- **Role**: Enforces federal drug laws, schedules controlled substances, and monitors the drug supply. Issues annual National Drug Threat Assessments.
- **Interests**: Supply-side enforcement; disrupting drug trafficking networks; maintaining its enforcement mandate.
- **Power**: Controls scheduling of substances (including potential scheduling of xylazine); investigates and prosecutes drug trafficking.
- **Limitations**: Enforcement-focused mandate can conflict with public health approaches. DEA regulation of methadone and buprenorphine prescribing has historically limited treatment access.

### Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP)

- **Role**: Coordinates federal drug policy across agencies. Publishes the National Drug Control Strategy. Administers the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) program and Drug-Free Communities (DFC) grants.
- **Interests**: Presenting a unified federal drug strategy; balancing enforcement, prevention, and treatment.
- **Power**: Coordination authority but limited operational control. Strategy documents signal White House priorities.
- **Limitations**: Effectiveness depends on the priority the President gives to drug policy. ONDCP budget authority has fluctuated significantly between administrations.

### National Institutes of Health (NIH) / NIDA

- **Role**: Funds research on addiction, prevention, and treatment. The HEAL Initiative ($1.5 billion in FY2024) is the largest NIH program focused on the overdose crisis.
- **Interests**: Scientific research; evidence generation; developing new treatments and prevention tools.
- **Power**: Research funding shapes the evidence base and influences policy debates.
- **Limitations**: Research timelines are often long relative to the urgency of the crisis. Translation of research into practice is slow.

## State and Local Government

### State Health Departments

- **Role**: Administer state-level overdose prevention programs, distribute federal grant funds, issue standing orders for naloxone, and operate surveillance systems.
- **Interests**: Reducing overdose deaths within their jurisdictions; securing and maintaining federal funding; implementing policies that are politically acceptable.
- **Power**: Significant discretion in how federal funds are used and what programs are supported. Can expand or restrict naloxone access, drug checking, and harm reduction through administrative action.
- **Limitations**: Subject to state legislative and gubernatorial priorities, which vary dramatically.

### State Legislatures

- **Role**: Enact Good Samaritan laws, naloxone access laws, drug paraphernalia laws, and funding appropriations.
- **Interests**: Responding to constituent concerns; balancing public health and law enforcement perspectives; electoral considerations.
- **Power**: Control the legal framework within which overdose prevention operates. Legislative action (or inaction) directly determines the availability and scope of prevention tools.
- **Limitations**: Political polarization can prevent evidence-based legislation. Rural legislators may have different priorities than urban legislators, even within the same state.

### Local Public Health Departments

- **Role**: Operate community-level prevention programs, distribute naloxone, coordinate with local organizations, and serve as the front line of overdose response.
- **Interests**: Meeting the needs of their communities; maintaining community trust; operating within budget constraints.
- **Power**: Direct service delivery; community relationships; local data collection.
- **Limitations**: Severely underfunded in most jurisdictions. Dependent on state and federal grants that may not align with local needs.

### Law Enforcement

- **Role**: First responders to overdose calls in many jurisdictions; naloxone administrators; enforcement of drug laws.
- **Interests**: Public safety; reducing crime associated with drug use; officer safety concerns related to fentanyl exposure.
- **Power**: Presence at overdose scenes; discretion in enforcement decisions; influence on legislative debates.
- **Position**: Varies widely. Some law enforcement agencies have embraced naloxone distribution and deflection programs (routing people to treatment rather than arrest). Others continue aggressive drug enforcement that undermines harm reduction efforts. The Police Assisted Addiction and Recovery Initiative (PAARI) represents the reform-oriented wing.
- **Key Tensions**: The perception that overdose prevention is incompatible with enforcement; concerns about officer exposure to fentanyl (often based on misinformation); and the role of drug-induced homicide prosecutions.

## Healthcare System

### Emergency Medical Services (EMS)

- **Role**: Primary medical responders to overdose calls. EMS crews in all 50 states carry and administer naloxone.
- **Interests**: Patient survival; efficient resource allocation; addressing the burden of repeat overdose calls on the system.
- **Power**: Direct clinical intervention; data collection on overdose incidents.
- **Key Concerns**: EMS systems in high-overdose areas report significant strain, with some units spending a majority of shifts responding to overdose calls. Burnout and secondary trauma among EMS personnel are significant problems.

### Emergency Departments

- **Role**: Treat nonfatal overdoses; potential starting point for medication-assisted treatment and treatment referrals.
- **Interests**: Patient outcomes; efficient throughput; reducing repeat visits.
- **Power**: Clinical authority to initiate buprenorphine and provide naloxone at discharge.
- **Gap**: Only 35% of emergency departments have protocols for initiating buprenorphine following a nonfatal overdose. Many still discharge overdose patients without naloxone, treatment referrals, or follow-up.

### Pharmacies

- **Role**: Primary retail distribution point for naloxone, including OTC Narcan. Can fill naloxone prescriptions, dispense under standing orders, and sell OTC products.
- **Interests**: Revenue; customer service; regulatory compliance; community health.
- **Power**: Extensive retail footprint, including in rural areas. The largest pharmacy chains (CVS, Walgreens, Walmart) have committed to stocking OTC naloxone.
- **Limitations**: OTC price point ($44.99) limits affordability. Pharmacist stigma toward people who use drugs has been documented and can create barriers.

### Pharmaceutical Companies

- **Naloxone Manufacturers**: Emergent BioSolutions (Narcan), Harm Reduction Therapeutics (RiVive), and generic manufacturers.
    - **Interests**: Market share; regulatory approval; pricing strategies; public relations.
    - **Key Tension**: The pricing of naloxone remains controversial. Narcan's OTC price of $44.99 is subsidized in some contexts but remains unaffordable for many uninsured individuals.
- **Opioid Manufacturers**: Companies such as Purdue Pharma (now dissolved), Johnson & Johnson, and others that manufactured or distributed prescription opioids that fueled the early phases of the crisis.
    - **Status**: Multiple companies have reached multi-billion-dollar settlements with state and local governments. These settlement funds are a significant source of overdose prevention funding, though their allocation varies widely.

## Harm Reduction Organizations

### National Organizations

- **National Harm Reduction Coalition (NHRC)**: Advocacy, training, and technical assistance for harm reduction programs nationally.
- **DanceSafe**: Drug checking services and education, particularly in nightlife and festival settings.
- **NEXT Distro**: Nationwide mail-based naloxone distribution.
- **OnPoint NYC**: Operates the first authorized overdose prevention centers (supervised consumption facilities) in the United States.

### Community-Based Organizations

- Hundreds of local organizations distribute naloxone, operate syringe service programs, conduct overdose education, and provide peer support. These organizations are overwhelmingly staffed by people with lived experience of drug use.
- **Interests**: Saving lives; reducing harm; advocating for policy change; serving their communities.
- **Power**: Deep community trust that government agencies often lack; direct access to people who use drugs; moral authority derived from frontline service.
- **Limitations**: Chronically underfunded; dependent on short-term grants; staff burnout and turnover; political vulnerability.

## People Who Use Drugs and Their Families

### People Who Use Drugs

- **Role**: The population most directly affected by the overdose crisis and the primary beneficiaries of prevention interventions. Also the most effective lay rescuers; people who use drugs administer the majority of community naloxone reversals.
- **Interests**: Survival; access to services without criminalization or coercion; autonomy and dignity; treatment when desired.
- **Power**: Limited formal political power due to stigma, marginalization, and criminalization. Growing influence through peer-led organizations and advocacy.
- **Key Concerns**: Fear of arrest; inadequate legal protections; lack of affordable naloxone; distrust of medical and government systems.

### Families and Loved Ones

- **Role**: Secondary victims of the overdose crisis; caregivers; advocates for policy change.
- **Interests**: Preventing the death of their family member; accessing treatment; navigating a complex and often hostile system.
- **Power**: Significant moral authority in policy debates. Family advocacy organizations (e.g., Shatterproof, GRASP, Faces and Voices of Recovery) have been influential in advancing naloxone access and Good Samaritan legislation.
- **Internal Divisions**: Families are not monolithic; some support harm reduction while others favor abstinence-only approaches, reflecting broader societal tensions.

---

## Research and Academic Community

- **Role**: Generate the evidence base for overdose prevention policy. Key institutions include Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Brown University School of Public Health, RTI International, RAND Corporation, and numerous university-based addiction research centers.
- **Interests**: Scientific rigor; evidence translation into policy; securing research funding.
- **Power**: Evidence authority; ability to shape public and policy narratives through peer-reviewed research and media engagement.
- **Key Contributions**: The evidence base for naloxone distribution, Good Samaritan laws, supervised consumption, and drug checking has been built primarily by academic researchers.

---

## Insurance Industry

- **Role**: Determines coverage and reimbursement for naloxone, substance use disorder treatment, and related services.
- **Interests**: Cost management; regulatory compliance; market positioning.
- **Power**: Coverage decisions directly affect access to naloxone, MOUD, and treatment.
- **Key Tensions**: Prior authorization requirements for buprenorphine and naloxone; limited coverage of harm reduction services; mental health parity compliance.

---

## Media

- **Role**: Shapes public understanding of the overdose crisis and overdose prevention. Media framing significantly influences political feasibility of prevention measures.
- **Interests**: Audience engagement; accuracy; public interest journalism.
- **Impact**: Research shows that media framing of overdose as a "crime story" versus a "health story" significantly affects public support for prevention measures. Coverage that features personal stories and humanizes people who use drugs is associated with greater support for harm reduction (McGinty et al., *JAMA*, 2019).

## Key Stakeholder Dynamics

### Alignment Opportunities

- **Public Health Coalition**: SAMHSA, CDC, FDA, state health departments, EMS, emergency departments, harm reduction organizations, and the research community are broadly aligned on expanding evidence-based prevention. This coalition is the strongest driver of reform.
- **Bipartisan Family Advocacy**: Family organizations that advocate for both harm reduction and treatment access have been effective bipartisan bridges, humanizing the crisis in ways that transcend partisan divisions.
- **Law Enforcement Reform Wing**: Progressive law enforcement leaders who support deflection programs, naloxone distribution, and alternatives to arrest represent a growing but still minority faction.

### Key Conflicts

- **Enforcement vs. Public Health**: The DEA's enforcement mandate, including regulation of methadone and buprenorphine prescribing, frequently conflicts with public health goals. Law enforcement opposition to supervised consumption facilities and some harm reduction programs remains strong.
- **Pharmaceutical Pricing**: The tension between pharmaceutical company pricing strategies and public health access goals is unresolved. OTC naloxone pricing remains a point of contention.
- **Abstinence vs. Harm Reduction**: The ideological divide between abstinence-based treatment and harm reduction approaches creates friction within the treatment community, among family organizations, and in legislative debates.
