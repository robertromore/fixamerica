# Overdose Prevention: Reform Roadmap

## Overview

Reforming the U.S. overdose prevention system requires a phased approach that prioritizes immediate mortality reduction through low-cost, high-impact interventions while building the institutional capacity for long-term, adaptive response. The roadmap is organized into three phases spanning ten years, recognizing that the crisis demands urgent action in the near term and sustained investment over time.

The fundamental principle is triage: interventions that save the most lives at the lowest cost and with the fewest political barriers are implemented first, while more complex reforms are built on the foundation of early successes.

## Phase 1: Emergency Response and Legal Reform (Years 1-2)

This phase focuses on actions that can be taken immediately through executive action, administrative guidance, and legislation with demonstrated bipartisan support. The goal is to maximize the number of lives saved in the shortest possible time.

## Total Program Cost

| Phase | Timeframe | Total Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 1 | Years 1-2 | $4.85 billion |
| Phase 2 | Years 3-5 | $9.775 billion |
| Phase 3 | Years 6-10 | $17.2 billion |

**Context**: The overdose crisis costs the U.S. economy approximately $1 trillion per year. The total ten-year investment proposed here represents approximately 0.3% of the estimated ten-year cost of the crisis. For every dollar invested in the program, the expected return in reduced mortality, healthcare savings, and economic productivity is estimated at $15-30.
