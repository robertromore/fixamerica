# Overdose Prevention: Opposition

## Overview

Despite broad consensus among public health experts that overdose prevention measures save lives, significant opposition exists at every level of government and society. This opposition draws on a mix of moral philosophy, political ideology, empirical claims, institutional interests, and community concerns. Understanding these arguments, their evidence basis, and their political strength is essential for designing reform strategies that can overcome resistance.

## 1. The Moral Hazard Argument

### The Claim

Making drug use safer reduces the consequences of drug use and thereby encourages it. Naloxone distribution, Good Samaritan laws, and supervised consumption facilities remove the natural deterrent of death and injury, enabling continued drug use rather than driving people toward treatment and recovery.

### Who Makes It

- Social conservatives and some religious leaders
- Certain law enforcement officials
- Some parents and family members who believe "tough love" is necessary
- Politicians who frame drug policy in terms of personal responsibility

### Evidence Assessment

The moral hazard argument is the most persistent objection to harm reduction, but it is not supported by the preponderance of evidence:

- **Naloxone and Drug Use**: A 2020 systematic review in *Addiction* (Caulkins et al.) found no evidence that naloxone distribution increases drug use or reduces treatment-seeking. A 2023 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) found that states with broader naloxone access laws saw increased treatment admissions, not decreased ones.
- **Good Samaritan Laws**: Research consistently shows that Good Samaritan laws increase 911 calls and reduce overdose deaths without increasing drug use (Rees et al., *JAMA Internal Medicine*, 2021).
- **Supervised Consumption Facilities**: A 2023 Cochrane review of supervised consumption facilities found that they reduce overdose deaths, increase treatment engagement, and reduce public drug use, with no evidence of increased drug use in surrounding communities.
- **International Experience**: Countries with comprehensive harm reduction systems (Portugal, Switzerland, the Netherlands) have significantly lower overdose death rates than the United States, despite less punitive approaches to drug use.

### Political Strength

**Strong.** Despite weak evidence, the moral hazard argument resonates deeply with the American public. A 2023 Pew Research Center poll found that 42% of Americans believe that making drug use safer "enables addiction," even as 78% support making naloxone widely available. This suggests that the general argument has emotional resonance even when specific interventions are supported.

## 2. The Enforcement Paradigm

### The Claim

Drug overdoses are best addressed through aggressive enforcement that reduces the drug supply, deters use, and incapacitates dealers. Harm reduction diverts attention and resources from enforcement and sends the message that drug use is acceptable. Drug-induced homicide prosecutions hold the right people accountable.

### Who Makes It

- DEA and some federal prosecutors
- Many state attorneys general and district attorneys
- Police unions and some sheriffs' associations
- Some members of Congress, particularly from rural and southern districts

### Evidence Assessment

The enforcement-first approach has significant limitations as an overdose prevention strategy:

- **Supply-Side Failure**: Despite spending over $1 trillion on drug enforcement since 1971, the United States has not achieved sustained reductions in drug availability or overdose deaths through enforcement alone. The illicit drug supply has become more potent, more diverse, and more dangerous over time.
- **Drug-Induced Homicide Laws**: A 2019 analysis in the *American Journal of Public Health* (Beletsky) found that drug-induced homicide prosecutions are associated with decreased 911 calls during overdoses, the opposite of their intended effect. These laws punish people who share drugs, often people who use drugs themselves, rather than large-scale traffickers.
- **Incarceration and Overdose Risk**: Enforcement that results in incarceration directly increases overdose risk upon release, as documented by multiple studies showing 40-fold higher overdose rates in the weeks following release.
- **Fentanyl's Challenge to Enforcement**: The extreme potency and compact size of fentanyl make traditional interdiction far less effective. A kilogram of fentanyl can produce 500,000 lethal doses and can be concealed in a small envelope.

### Political Strength

**Very Strong.** The enforcement paradigm is deeply embedded in American political culture and institutions. Law enforcement agencies have significant political influence, and the "tough on crime" frame remains electorally powerful in many districts. Federal drug control spending continues to allocate approximately 65% to supply reduction and enforcement.

## 3. Community Opposition to Harm Reduction Facilities

### The Claim

Harm reduction facilities, including syringe service programs, naloxone distribution sites, supervised consumption facilities, and drug checking services, attract drug users, increase crime, lower property values, and degrade neighborhood quality of life. No community should be forced to host such facilities.

### Who Makes It

- Neighborhood associations and homeowner groups
- Small business owners
- Local elected officials responsive to constituent concerns
- Real estate interests

### Evidence Assessment

Community impact concerns are understandable but generally not supported by evidence:

- **Crime**: A 2021 study in *The Lancet Public Health* found no increase in crime in areas surrounding supervised consumption facilities in Sydney, Australia, after 20 years of operation. Similar findings have been reported for syringe service programs in multiple U.S. cities.
- **Property Values**: A 2019 study in the *Journal of Urban Economics* found no measurable impact on property values near syringe service programs.
- **Litter and Public Drug Use**: Evidence from supervised consumption facilities shows that they reduce, rather than increase, public drug use and discarded syringes (Kennedy et al., *Drug and Alcohol Dependence*, 2017).
- **Concentration Effects**: The concern about "attracting" drug users to a neighborhood is partially valid: facilities do concentrate visible drug use. However, this represents a redistribution of existing activity, not an increase, and occurs in a managed setting with medical supervision.

### Political Strength

**Moderate to Strong Locally.** NIMBY opposition is a powerful barrier to opening specific facilities, even when statewide or citywide support exists. Local opposition has delayed or blocked harm reduction programs in multiple cities, including proposed supervised consumption facilities in San Francisco, Philadelphia, and Seattle.

## 4. Concerns About Enabling Without Treatment

### The Claim

Harm reduction without adequate treatment infrastructure simply keeps people alive in their addiction without helping them recover. Resources should be directed toward treatment expansion rather than harm reduction, which is a half-measure at best.

### Who Makes It

- Abstinence-based treatment providers
- Some recovery community leaders
- Families who have experienced the long-term suffering of a loved one's addiction
- Fiscal conservatives who question the cost-effectiveness of harm reduction versus treatment

### Evidence Assessment

This argument contains a legitimate concern wrapped in a false dichotomy:

- **Legitimate Concern**: Treatment access is indeed inadequate. Only 11% of people with opioid use disorder receive MOUD. Expanding treatment capacity is essential.
- **False Dichotomy**: Harm reduction and treatment are not competing alternatives; they are complementary. Research consistently shows that engagement with harm reduction services increases, rather than decreases, treatment uptake.
- **Sequencing**: Harm reduction is often the first point of contact between people who use drugs and the healthcare system. Without it, many people never reach treatment at all.
- **Moral Imperative**: The argument that resources should go to treatment rather than prevention ignores the fact that a person must be alive to enter treatment. Naloxone distribution costs $438-$1,162 per life saved, making it among the most cost-effective health interventions available.

### Political Strength

**Moderate.** This argument has bipartisan appeal because it positions treatment as the "real" solution while marginalizing harm reduction. It is particularly effective in legislative debates where funding is zero-sum.

## 5. Fentanyl Test Strip Opposition

### The Claim

Fentanyl test strips are drug paraphernalia that facilitate drug use. Legalizing them sends the wrong message and may make people more comfortable using drugs because they believe they have checked for fentanyl.

### Who Makes It

- Eight state legislatures that continue to classify FTS as paraphernalia
- Some law enforcement officials
- Anti-drug advocacy groups

### Evidence Assessment

This argument is contradicted by strong evidence:

- **Behavior Change**: Multiple studies show that 50-70% of people who test positive for fentanyl change their behavior, by using less, using more slowly, using with someone present, or having naloxone on hand (Goldman et al., *Harm Reduction Journal*, 2023).
- **False Security Concern**: While it is true that a negative test does not guarantee safety (test strips can miss some analogs), the appropriate response is to improve testing technology, not ban the tool.
- **Inconsistency**: States that ban fentanyl test strips while promoting naloxone distribution are logically inconsistent; both are harm reduction tools, and both save lives.
- **Legislative Trend**: The clear legislative trend is toward legalization. Between 2021 and 2024, more than 20 states decriminalized fentanyl test strips.

### Political Strength

**Declining.** Opposition to fentanyl test strips is weakening rapidly. Bipartisan support for legalization has been demonstrated in multiple conservative states, including Tennessee, Texas, and Florida. The remaining holdout states face increasing pressure.

## 6. Supervised Consumption Facility Opposition

### The Claim

Supervised consumption facilities (also called safe injection sites or overdose prevention centers) violate federal law, condone illegal drug use, undermine the rule of law, and represent a radical departure from acceptable drug policy.

### Who Makes It

- The DEA and Department of Justice (under most administrations)
- Many Republican and some Democratic elected officials
- Some community groups
- Anti-drug organizations

### Evidence Assessment

- **Legal Status**: The federal "crack house" statute (21 U.S.C. 856) has been interpreted to prohibit supervised consumption facilities, though legal opinions differ. The Supreme Court has not definitively ruled on the question.
- **International Evidence**: More than 200 supervised consumption facilities operate in 14 countries. No facility has ever recorded a death from overdose on site. A 2023 Cochrane review found strong evidence that they reduce overdose deaths, increase treatment entry, and reduce public drug use and syringe litter.
- **OnPoint NYC**: The first authorized U.S. facility reported more than 1,000 overdose interventions and zero deaths in its first year of operation (2022-2023).
- **Crime**: No evidence of increased crime around supervised consumption facilities has been documented in international or domestic evaluations.

### Political Strength

**Strong at the Federal Level; Mixed at the State and Local Level.** Federal opposition remains strong, and the "crack house" statute is a significant legal barrier. However, state and local support is growing, particularly in cities with high overdose rates. Rhode Island became the first state to explicitly authorize supervised consumption through legislation in 2021.

## 7. Cost and Fiscal Opposition

### The Claim

Overdose prevention programs are expensive and represent an ongoing cost that diverts resources from other public priorities. Taxpayers should not be expected to subsidize drug use indefinitely.

### Who Makes It

- Fiscal conservatives at all levels of government
- Taxpayer advocacy groups
- Budget-cutting coalitions

### Evidence Assessment

This argument is flatly contradicted by cost-effectiveness data:

- **Cost of Inaction**: The overdose crisis costs the United States an estimated $1 trillion annually in healthcare, lost productivity, criminal justice, and other costs (Stanford-Lancet Commission, 2024). This represents approximately $3,000 per American per year.
- **Cost of Prevention**: Naloxone distribution programs cost $438-$1,162 per life saved (Coffin & Sullivan, *Annals of Internal Medicine*, 2013; updated estimates, 2024). This is among the most cost-effective health interventions ever studied, comparable to childhood vaccination.
- **Treatment Cost-Effectiveness**: Every dollar invested in substance use disorder treatment generates $4-7 in savings from reduced criminal justice and healthcare costs (NIDA, 2023).
- **Settlement Funds**: State and local governments have secured tens of billions of dollars in opioid settlements that can fund prevention at no additional taxpayer cost, if allocated appropriately.

### Political Strength

**Moderate.** The cost argument is weakened by the overwhelming cost-effectiveness evidence, but it retains force in budget debates where spending on any new program faces resistance.

## Strategies for Overcoming Opposition

### Frame Around Saving Lives, Not Endorsing Drug Use

The most effective counter to the moral hazard argument is to reframe the discussion from "making drug use safer" to "keeping people alive so they can recover." Naloxone is a rescue medication, not a recreational tool.

### Use Data and Local Examples

Community opposition is most effectively addressed with data from comparable communities and, where possible, site visits to operational programs. The success of OnPoint NYC has been a powerful counter to abstract opposition.

### Build Bipartisan Coalitions

The most successful overdose prevention legislation, including CARA, the SUPPORT Act, and OTC naloxone, was enacted with bipartisan support. Framing prevention as a public safety issue rather than a liberal or progressive cause broadens the coalition.

### Engage Law Enforcement Allies

Progressive law enforcement leaders who support harm reduction are among the most credible advocates for reform within resistant communities. Organizations like the Police Assisted Addiction and Recovery Initiative (PAARI) and the Law Enforcement Action Partnership (LEAP) provide models.

### Address Legitimate Concerns

Some opposition reflects legitimate concerns that should be addressed rather than dismissed. Community impact mitigation plans, treatment integration requirements, and transparent data reporting can address concerns about facility siting and program accountability.
