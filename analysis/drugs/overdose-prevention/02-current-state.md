# Overdose Prevention: Current State

## Overdose Mortality Data

### National Overview

The United States has experienced an unprecedented and sustained increase in overdose deaths over the past two decades. Drug overdose is now the leading cause of injury death for Americans aged 25-64.

| Year | Total Overdose Deaths | Opioid-Involved | Synthetic Opioid (Fentanyl) | Year-over-Year Change |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1999 | 16,849 | 8,048 | — | — |
| 2010 | 38,329 | 21,089 | 3,007 | — |
| 2015 | 52,404 | 33,091 | 9,580 | +11.4% |
| 2017 | 70,237 | 47,600 | 28,466 | +9.6% |
| 2019 | 70,630 | 49,860 | 36,359 | -4.1% (from 2017 peak) |
| 2020 | 91,799 | 68,630 | 57,834 | +30.0% |
| 2021 | 106,699 | 80,411 | 70,601 | +16.2% |
| 2022 | 109,680 | 81,806 | 73,838 | +2.8% |
| 2023 | 107,543 | 79,770 | 74,702 | -1.9% |

### Geographic Distribution

Overdose death rates vary dramatically by state. The highest rates are concentrated in Appalachia, the Northeast, and parts of the South and Midwest.

| Rank | State | Age-Adjusted Rate per 100,000 (2023) | Primary Driver |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | West Virginia | 81.4 | Fentanyl, polysubstance |
| 2 | Tennessee | 56.2 | Fentanyl |
| 3 | Louisiana | 55.9 | Fentanyl |
| 4 | Kentucky | 53.7 | Fentanyl, methamphetamine |
| 5 | Ohio | 47.2 | Fentanyl |
| 6 | Delaware | 46.1 | Fentanyl |
| 7 | Pennsylvania | 44.8 | Fentanyl |
| 8 | Maryland | 43.1 | Fentanyl |
| 9 | New Mexico | 42.5 | Fentanyl, methamphetamine |
| 10 | Missouri | 40.3 | Fentanyl |

*Source: CDC NCHS, 2024. Note: Rates are age-adjusted and based on provisional data.*

**Lowest Rates**: Nebraska (10.3), South Dakota (12.1), Iowa (13.8), Kansas (14.5), Minnesota (16.2).

### Demographic Disparities

| Demographic Group | Overdose Death Rate per 100,000 (2023) | Trend |
|---|---|---|
| American Indian/Alaska Native | 56.1 | Declining from 2022 peak |
| Non-Hispanic Black | 38.4 | Still rising in some regions |
| Non-Hispanic White | 36.2 | Plateauing |
| Hispanic/Latino | 23.7 | Rising fastest of any group |
| Asian/Pacific Islander | 5.8 | Rising |
| Males (all races) | 43.8 | 2.5x female rate |
| Females (all races) | 17.4 | Rising faster than male rate |
| Ages 25-34 | 52.3 | Highest age group rate |
| Ages 35-44 | 51.8 | Second highest |
| Ages 55-64 | 30.1 | Rising due to polysubstance use |

*Source: CDC NCHS Provisional Mortality Statistics, 2024*

### Polysubstance Involvement

A critical development in the current crisis is the prevalence of polysubstance use and contamination. Many overdose deaths involve multiple substances.

| Substance Combination | Share of Overdose Deaths (2023) | Trend |
|---|---|---|
| Fentanyl only | ~25% | Declining share |
| Fentanyl + stimulant (cocaine or methamphetamine) | ~32% | Rising |
| Fentanyl + benzodiazepine (prescribed or illicit) | ~15% | Rising |
| Fentanyl + xylazine | ~12% | Rapidly rising |
| Methamphetamine (without opioids) | ~10% | Stable |
| Cocaine (without opioids) | ~5% | Stable |

## Naloxone Access and Distribution

### Regulatory Status

- **Over-the-Counter Availability**: The FDA approved Narcan (naloxone nasal spray, 4mg) for over-the-counter sale in March 2023. A second OTC product, RiVive (naloxone nasal spray, 3mg), was approved in March 2024.
- **Retail Price**: Narcan OTC retails at approximately $44.99 for a 2-dose pack. RiVive is priced at approximately $34.99.
- **Standing Orders**: All 50 states and D.C. have some form of standing order, protocol, or collaborative practice agreement that allows pharmacies to dispense naloxone without an individual prescription.
- **Insurance Coverage**: Most state Medicaid programs and many commercial insurers cover naloxone, but copays and formulary restrictions vary widely.

### Distribution Programs

| Distribution Channel | Estimated Doses Distributed (2023) | Coverage |
|---|---|---|
| Community-based organizations (CBOs) | 4.2 million | Concentrated in urban areas |
| Pharmacies (standing orders + OTC) | 2.8 million | Growing rapidly post-OTC approval |
| Emergency departments | 850,000 | Variable by hospital system |
| First responders (EMS, fire, police) | 1.1 million | Near-universal EMS carry; ~75% of police |
| Jails and prisons (at release) | 320,000 | Growing but still minority of facilities |
| Syringe service programs | 1.5 million | Concentrated in states permitting SSPs |
| VA health system | 280,000 | All VA facilities |

### Naloxone Effectiveness

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Success rate (single opioid overdose) | 93-100% | SAMHSA, 2023 |
| Success rate (fentanyl overdose, single dose) | 55-75% | Somerville et al., JAMA, 2024 |
| Success rate (fentanyl, multiple doses) | 85-95% | Somerville et al., JAMA, 2024 |
| Average time to reversal (intranasal) | 2-5 minutes | FDA prescribing information |
| Estimated reversals nationally (2023) | 250,000+ | HHS, 2024 |
| Cost per life saved (OEND programs) | $438-$1,162 | Coffin & Sullivan, Annals of Internal Medicine, 2013; updated 2024 |

### Gaps in Access

Despite expanded availability, significant gaps remain:

- **Rural Access**: Rural counties have approximately 40% fewer naloxone distribution points per capita than urban counties (Scholl et al., MMWR, 2024).
- **Cost Barriers**: The $44.99 OTC price remains prohibitive for many people who use drugs. Free distribution programs are concentrated in states with robust public health infrastructure.
- **Fentanyl Potency**: Increasingly potent fentanyl analogs (e.g., carfentanil) and polysubstance combinations may require multiple doses of naloxone, raising concerns about whether single-dose kits are sufficient.
- **Non-Opioid Overdoses**: Naloxone is ineffective against overdoses involving only stimulants, benzodiazepines, or xylazine. The growing share of polysubstance overdoses limits naloxone's effectiveness as a standalone intervention.

## Good Samaritan Laws

### Coverage and Scope

Good Samaritan laws provide legal protections for people who call 911 to report an overdose. As of 2024, 48 states and the District of Columbia have enacted some form of Good Samaritan law, with Kansas and Wyoming being the only holdouts.

| Protection Type | Number of States | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Immunity from arrest (drug possession) | 40 | Varies in scope of drugs covered |
| Immunity from prosecution | 45 | Some limited to misdemeanors only |
| Immunity from probation/parole violations | 17 | Major gap; most states do not protect |
| Protection for the person experiencing overdose | 44 | Some states only protect the caller |
| Protection for administering naloxone | 50 + D.C. | Broadest category of protection |
| Protection from civil liability (naloxone) | 50 + D.C. | For lay rescuers and prescribers |

*Source: PDAPS, Temple University, 2024; Legislative Analysis and Public Policy Association (LAPPA), 2024*

### Effectiveness and Barriers

Research consistently shows that Good Samaritan laws increase 911 calls during overdoses and reduce mortality:

- A 2021 study in *JAMA Internal Medicine* found that states with Good Samaritan laws experienced a 15% reduction in opioid overdose deaths in the first two years after enactment (Rees et al., 2021).
- A 2023 study in *Drug and Alcohol Dependence* found that only 34% of people who use drugs were aware that their state had a Good Samaritan law (Jakubowski et al., 2023).
- The most commonly cited barrier is fear of police response: 65% of people who use drugs reported that they would hesitate to call 911 during an overdose due to fear of arrest, even in states with Good Samaritan laws (Latimore & Bergstein, 2017; replicated in Koester et al., 2023).

### Key Limitations

- **Scope Gaps**: Many laws do not protect against violations of probation, parole, or pretrial release conditions, which affects a large share of people who use drugs.
- **Warrant Exceptions**: Most laws do not protect against arrest on outstanding warrants, which disproportionately affects people experiencing homelessness and poverty.
- **Awareness**: Low awareness among both the public and law enforcement significantly limits effectiveness.
- **Police Practices**: Despite legal protections, police in some jurisdictions continue to investigate and arrest people at overdose scenes, undermining the intent of Good Samaritan laws.

## Drug Checking Services

### Fentanyl Test Strips

Fentanyl test strips (FTS) are inexpensive immunoassay-based tools that can detect the presence of fentanyl and many of its analogs in a drug sample. They cost approximately $1-2 per strip.

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| States where FTS are legal | 42 + D.C. | PDAPS, 2024 |
| States classifying FTS as paraphernalia | 8 | PDAPS, 2024 |
| Accuracy for fentanyl detection | 96-100% sensitivity | Peiper et al., International Journal of Drug Policy, 2019 |
| Behavior change when fentanyl detected | 50-70% report using differently | Goldman et al., Harm Reduction Journal, 2023 |
| Cost per strip | $1-2 | DanceSafe, 2024 |

### Advanced Drug Checking

Several programs have implemented more sophisticated drug checking technologies:

- **Fourier-Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)**: Identifies the composition of a drug sample, including concentration levels. Deployed at approximately 30 programs nationally.
- **Mass Spectrometry**: The gold standard for drug composition analysis. Available at fewer than 10 programs in the United States, compared to widespread deployment in Canada and parts of Europe.
- **Point-of-Care Testing**: Emerging portable testing technologies that can provide detailed composition analysis in minutes rather than days.

### Legal Status

Despite mounting evidence of effectiveness, eight states continue to classify fentanyl test strips as drug paraphernalia, making their possession or distribution a criminal offense. This classification directly undermines overdose prevention by depriving people who use drugs of critical safety information.

## Xylazine and Emerging Threats

### Xylazine (Tranq)

Xylazine is a veterinary tranquilizer that has increasingly been found mixed with fentanyl in the illicit drug supply. It presents unique challenges for overdose prevention because it is not an opioid and does not respond to naloxone.

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Overdose deaths involving xylazine (2023) | ~12,000 | CDC, 2024 |
| Increase in xylazine-involved deaths (2020-2023) | +1,127% | DEA, 2024 |
| Regions with highest xylazine prevalence | Northeast, Mid-Atlantic | DEA National Drug Threat Assessment, 2024 |
| DEA scheduling status | Emerging threat (not scheduled) | DEA, 2024 |

**Clinical Challenges**:

- Xylazine causes severe sedation that does not respond to naloxone, though naloxone should still be administered because fentanyl is almost always co-present.
- Xylazine is associated with severe, necrotic skin wounds at injection sites, often requiring advanced wound care.
- There is currently no FDA-approved reversal agent for xylazine in humans, though research on the alpha-2 antagonist tolazoline is underway.

### Nitazenes

Nitazenes are a class of synthetic opioids that are significantly more potent than fentanyl. First detected in the U.S. illicit drug supply in 2019, they have appeared with increasing frequency in the Southeast and parts of the Midwest. Their extreme potency means that standard naloxone doses may be insufficient for reversal.

### Medetomidine

In 2024, medetomidine, another veterinary sedative similar to xylazine but approximately 10 times more potent, began appearing in the illicit drug supply in several East Coast cities. Like xylazine, it does not respond to naloxone.

## Overdose Fatality Review Teams

Overdose Fatality Review Teams (OFRTs) are multidisciplinary panels that review individual overdose deaths to identify systemic failures and missed opportunities for intervention.

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Active OFRTs nationally | 150+ (in 30 states) | BJS/ONDCP, 2024 |
| Average cases reviewed per team per year | 25-50 | National OFRT Network, 2024 |
| Most common missed intervention identified | No naloxone on scene (42%) | National OFRT data summary, 2024 |
| Second most common | Treatment not offered post-nonfatal OD (38%) | National OFRT data summary, 2024 |
| Third most common | Loss of insurance coverage (31%) | National OFRT data summary, 2024 |

### Key Findings from OFRT Reviews

- **Missed Touchpoints**: On average, a person who dies from an overdose has had 7-12 contacts with health, social service, or criminal justice systems in the 12 months prior to death (Acker et al., *Drug and Alcohol Dependence*, 2023).
- **Post-Nonfatal Overdose**: Approximately 60% of people who die from an overdose had at least one prior nonfatal overdose, representing a critical missed prevention opportunity.
- **Incarceration-to-Death Pipeline**: People released from jails and prisons have an overdose death rate 40 times higher than the general population in the two weeks following release (Binswanger et al., *NEJM*, 2007; confirmed in subsequent studies through 2024).

## Federal Funding

### Key Federal Programs

| Program | Agency | FY2024 Funding | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| State Opioid Response (SOR) Grants | SAMHSA | $1.5 billion | Treatment, recovery, prevention |
| Tribal Opioid Response (TOR) Grants | SAMHSA | $50 million | Tribal-specific programming |
| Overdose Data to Action (OD2A) | CDC | $487 million | Surveillance, prevention, response |
| Rural Communities Opioid Response (RCORP) | HRSA | $195 million | Rural treatment and prevention |
| HIDTA Program (overdose components) | ONDCP | $310 million | Intelligence-led prevention |
| Drug-Free Communities (DFC) | ONDCP | $105 million | Community coalition support |
| NIH HEAL Initiative | NIH | $1.5 billion | Research (treatment, prevention, pain) |

### Funding Gaps

Despite significant federal investment, funding falls far short of need:

- The Stanford-Lancet Commission on the North American Opioid Crisis estimated in 2024 that comprehensive response would require $7-10 billion annually in federal funding alone, roughly three to four times current levels.
- Harm reduction services receive a small fraction of total federal drug spending. Approximately 95% of federal drug control spending goes to supply reduction (interdiction and law enforcement) and treatment, with less than 5% dedicated to harm reduction and prevention.
- The Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant (SABG), a primary funding source for state substance use programs, has not been significantly increased since 2000, despite the crisis intensifying dramatically.
