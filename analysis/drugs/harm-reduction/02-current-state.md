# Harm Reduction: Current State

## Overdose Crisis Overview

The United States continues to experience the deadliest drug overdose crisis in its history, driven primarily by illicitly manufactured fentanyl and its analogs. The scale of preventable death provides the urgent context for harm reduction policy.

### National Overdose Trends

| Year | Total Overdose Deaths | Synthetic Opioid Deaths | % Change (Total) |
|------|----------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| 2015 | 52,404 | 9,580 | -- |
| 2017 | 70,237 | 28,466 | +34.0% (from 2015) |
| 2019 | 70,630 | 36,359 | +0.6% (from 2017) |
| 2020 | 93,655 | 57,834 | +32.6% (from 2019) |
| 2021 | 106,699 | 71,238 | +13.9% (from 2020) |
| 2022 | 109,680 | 73,654 | +2.8% (from 2021) |
| 2023 | 107,543 | 73,838 | -2.0% (from 2022) |

## Drug Checking Services

### Fentanyl Test Strips

Fentanyl test strips (FTS) are immunoassay-based lateral flow strips that detect the presence of fentanyl and many of its analogs in drug samples. Originally designed for urine drug testing, they have been adapted for drug supply checking.

| Metric | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Sensitivity | 96-100% for fentanyl detection |
| Specificity | 90-95% (some false positives with certain analogs) |
| Cost per strip | $0.50-$2.00 |
| Time to result | 2-5 minutes |
| Limitations | Qualitative only (presence/absence, not quantity); does not detect all novel analogs |

### Legal Status of Fentanyl Test Strips

| Category | States | Year of Change |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| Explicitly legal | 30 + D.C. | 2018-2024 |
| Legal (paraphernalia law does not cover) | 8 | Varies |
| Ambiguous/unclear legal status | 7 | -- |
| Still classified as drug paraphernalia | 5 | -- |
| Federal status | Legal for personal use (DOJ guidance, 2021) | 2021 |

*States where FTS remain paraphernalia as of 2024: Florida (partial), Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Texas (partial)*

*Source: Legislative Analysis Service / Network for Public Health Law, 2024*

### Behavioral Impact of Drug Checking

| Finding | Study | Source |
|---------|-------|--------|
| 70-90% of users who test positive for fentanyl change behavior | Multi-site study, 2019-2022 | Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School, 2022 |
| Common behavioral changes: use less, use with someone present, have naloxone nearby | Same study | Johns Hopkins, 2022 |
| 45% of positive-test individuals discarded the drug sample entirely | Vancouver DCHK study | *Drug and Alcohol Dependence*, 2021 |
| 63% increase in naloxone carrying after testing services used | Baltimore pilot program | *IJDP*, 2023 |
| Drug checking users 2.5x more likely to enter treatment within 6 months | French DCHK evaluation | *Addiction*, 2022 |

### Advanced Drug Checking Technologies

| Technology | Description | Deployment Status in U.S. |
|-----------|-------------|--------------------------|
| Fentanyl test strips | Immunoassay lateral flow | Widely available at SSPs and community orgs |
| Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) | Identifies drug composition by molecular fingerprint | Pilot programs in ~15 cities |
| Mass spectrometry (MS) | Quantitative analysis of drug composition | Academic/research settings; 5 community sites |
| Raman spectroscopy | Portable molecular identification | Emerging; 3-4 pilot sites |
| Paper spray mass spectrometry | Rapid quantitative field testing | Research phase |

## Medication-Assisted Treatment

### MAT Overview

Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) uses FDA-approved medications -- primarily buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone -- to treat opioid use disorder. While technically a treatment modality rather than harm reduction per se, MAT access is a core harm reduction priority because it is the single most effective intervention for preventing overdose death.

### MAT Medications

| Medication | Administration | Access Model | Key Barriers |
|------------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| Buprenorphine (Suboxone) | Sublingual or injectable | Office-based; any DEA-registered provider (X-waiver eliminated 2023) | Provider reluctance, insurance barriers, stigma |
| Methadone | Oral (liquid/tablet) | Opioid Treatment Programs (OTPs) only; daily observed dosing | Federal regulation requires clinic visits, limited locations, hours |
| Naltrexone (Vivitrol) | Monthly injection | Any prescriber; no special certification | Requires full detox first, injection site reactions, cost |

### Access Statistics

| Metric | Figure | Source |
|--------|--------|--------|
| People receiving buprenorphine | 1.7 million (2023) | SAMHSA, 2024 |
| People receiving methadone | 427,000 (2023) | SAMHSA OTP data, 2024 |
| People receiving naltrexone for OUD | 88,000 (2023 est.) | CMS/SAMHSA, 2024 |
| DEA-registered buprenorphine providers | 130,000+ | DEA/SAMHSA, 2024 |
| Opioid Treatment Programs (methadone clinics) | 2,067 | SAMHSA OTP Directory, 2024 |
| Counties with no buprenorphine provider | 400+ (13% of U.S. counties) | SAMHSA Behavioral Health Mapping, 2024 |
| Counties with no OTP | ~2,400 (77% of U.S. counties) | SAMHSA OTP Directory, 2024 |
| Average wait time for methadone enrollment | 7-14 days (urban); 21+ days (rural) | *Drug and Alcohol Dependence*, 2023 |
| Treatment gap (need MAT but do not receive) | 2.3 million people | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2023 |

### Recent Policy Changes

| Change | Year | Impact |
|--------|------|--------|
| X-waiver elimination (MATE Act / Omnibus 2023) | 2023 | Any DEA-registered provider can prescribe buprenorphine without special waiver |
| COVID-era methadone take-home flexibility | 2020-present | Allowed multi-day take-home doses; regulations being made permanent |
| DEA proposed methadone rulemaking | 2024 | Proposed expansion of take-home privileges and mobile units |
| Telehealth buprenorphine prescribing | 2020-present | Audio/video prescribing allowed; DEA proposing permanent rule |
| Medicare coverage of OTP services | 2020 | Medicare Part B covers methadone treatment |
