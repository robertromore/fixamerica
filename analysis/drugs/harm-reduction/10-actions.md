# Harm Reduction: What Citizens Can Do

## Overview

Every person can contribute to reducing drug-related death and disease in their community. This section provides concrete, actionable steps organized by level of engagement -- from immediate personal actions that take minutes to sustained advocacy that can change policy. The overdose crisis kills nearly 300 Americans every day; individual action matters.

## Immediate Actions (Today)

### Get Naloxone and Learn to Use It

Naloxone (Narcan) is the single most important tool any individual can carry. It reverses opioid overdoses and has no harmful effects if administered to someone not experiencing an opioid overdose.

| Action | How | Cost | Time |
|--------|-----|------|------|
| Get naloxone from a pharmacy | Walk into any pharmacy and ask; no prescription needed (OTC since 2023) | $0-$44.99 (free at many locations) | 10 minutes |
| Get free naloxone | Contact local SSP, health department, or community organization | Free | 15-30 minutes |
| Order naloxone online | getnaloxonenow.org or NEXT Distro (nextdistro.org) | Free (many programs) | Mail delivery |
| Complete naloxone training | Online at getnaloxonenow.org or through local health department | Free | 10-20 minutes |
| Carry naloxone | Keep in bag, car, desk, or home medicine cabinet | -- | Ongoing |

**Key facts about naloxone use:**

- Naloxone works only on opioid overdoses; it will not harm someone overdosing on other substances
- The nasal spray (Narcan) requires no medical training: spray into one nostril while the person is on their back
- If breathing does not resume within 2-3 minutes, administer a second dose
- Always call 911 after administering naloxone; the person may need additional medical care
- Good Samaritan laws in 48 states + D.C. protect callers from drug-related criminal liability

### Learn to Recognize an Overdose

| Sign | What You See |
|------|-------------|
| Unresponsive | Person does not respond to voice or sternal rub (knuckles on chest) |
| Slow or stopped breathing | Fewer than 8 breaths per minute; gasping; gurgling ("death rattle") |
| Blue or gray skin | Lips, fingertips, or face turning blue or grayish |
| Pinpoint pupils | Very small pupils (though not always visible) |
| Limpness | Body is limp; cannot support own weight |

**Overdose response steps:**

1. Call 911 immediately
2. Administer naloxone (nasal spray into one nostril)
3. Perform rescue breathing if trained (1 breath every 5 seconds)
4. Place person in recovery position (on their side) if breathing resumes
5. Stay with the person until EMS arrives
6. Administer second dose of naloxone if no response after 2-3 minutes

### Share What You Learn

- Tell five people you carry naloxone and why
- Share overdose response information with friends, family, and coworkers
- Post about naloxone availability on social media
- Leave informational materials at community spaces

### Key Talking Points for Advocacy

**For conservative audiences:**

- Naloxone and MAT reduce repeat 911 calls and emergency department visits
- People with substance use disorder are our neighbors, family members, and coworkers
- The overdose crisis affects rural, suburban, and urban communities alike
- Fiscal responsibility demands we invest in what works, not what feels punitive

**For progressive audiences:**

- Harm reduction is a racial justice issue: Black and Indigenous communities face highest overdose rates with least access to services
- The War on Drugs has failed by every measure and disproportionately harms communities of color
- Health is a human right; drug use should not be a barrier to healthcare
- Harm reduction is the evidence-based approach endorsed by every major medical organization

**For all audiences:**

- 107,543 Americans died of drug overdoses in 2023 -- nearly 300 per day
- Not a single person has died at any of the 120+ supervised consumption sites worldwide
- SSP participants are 5 times more likely to enter drug treatment
- Naloxone has no harmful side effects and saves lives in minutes
