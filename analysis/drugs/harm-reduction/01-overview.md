# Harm Reduction: Overview

## Executive Summary

Harm reduction is a set of practical strategies and evidence-based approaches aimed at reducing the negative consequences associated with drug use without requiring abstinence as a precondition. Rooted in public health principles, harm reduction recognizes that people will continue to use drugs regardless of legal prohibitions, and that pragmatic interventions -- syringe services programs, naloxone distribution, supervised consumption sites, drug checking services, and expanded access to medication-assisted treatment -- save lives, reduce disease transmission, and connect people to care. Despite overwhelming scientific evidence supporting these approaches, the United States has been slower than peer nations to adopt harm reduction at scale, constrained by moral objections, legal barriers, funding restrictions, and political stigma. The result is preventable death on a massive scale: over 107,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2023, a toll that harm reduction interventions demonstrably reduce wherever they are implemented.

## Scope of This Analysis

This section examines:

- **Syringe services programs (SSPs)**: Needle and syringe exchange, distribution of sterile injection equipment, and ancillary health services provided at SSP sites
- **Supervised consumption sites (SCS)**: Facilities where individuals can use pre-obtained drugs under medical supervision, also known as overdose prevention centers or safe injection facilities
- **Naloxone distribution**: Access to and deployment of the opioid overdose reversal medication naloxone (Narcan), including community distribution, over-the-counter availability, and co-prescribing
- **Drug checking services**: Fentanyl test strips, mass spectrometry, and other technologies that allow individuals to test the composition of substances before use
- **Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) access**: Barriers to and expansion of buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone treatment for opioid use disorder
- **Mobile and outreach services**: Street-based harm reduction, mobile health units, and peer navigation programs
- **Legal and policy frameworks**: Federal, state, and local laws governing harm reduction tools and services

This analysis does not cover broader drug decriminalization policy (see [Decriminalization](../decriminalization/01-overview.md)) or general addiction treatment beyond its intersection with harm reduction access (see [Drug Treatment](../drug-treatment/01-overview.md)).

## Core Tensions

### Public Health vs. Moral Framework

The central tension in U.S. harm reduction policy is between evidence-based public health practice and moral-ideological opposition. Public health data consistently demonstrates that harm reduction saves lives, prevents disease, reduces healthcare costs, and connects people to treatment. Opponents argue that harm reduction "enables" drug use, undermines personal responsibility, and sends a message of social tolerance for destructive behavior. This tension has shaped federal funding restrictions, state legislative battles, and local siting controversies for decades.

### Individual Autonomy vs. Community Impact

Harm reduction approaches respect individual autonomy by meeting people where they are in their drug use. Critics raise concerns about community impacts, including neighborhood effects of syringe services programs, the visibility of drug use near supervised consumption sites, and the perceived normalization of substance use. Balancing individual rights to health services with community concerns about safety and quality of life requires transparent engagement and site design.

### Federal Prohibition vs. State Innovation

Federal drug scheduling and the Controlled Substances Act create legal barriers to harm reduction that state-level innovation cannot fully overcome. Drug paraphernalia laws criminalize possession of syringes and fentanyl test strips in many jurisdictions. Federal funding restrictions (particularly the decades-long ban on using federal funds for syringe purchase) limit program reach. States and cities that move ahead with supervised consumption sites face uncertain federal enforcement postures.

### Evidence vs. Politics

The evidence base for harm reduction is among the strongest in public health. Decades of research from multiple countries consistently demonstrate effectiveness. Yet political dynamics -- particularly in election cycles -- often override evidence. Harm reduction funding and authorization remain vulnerable to political reversals driven by "tough on crime" rhetoric rather than outcome data.

## The Human Cost of Inaction

Every day in the United States, approximately 295 people die from drug overdoses. The vast majority of these deaths are preventable with existing harm reduction tools:

- **Naloxone** reverses opioid overdoses in minutes when administered promptly. Thousands of people die each year because naloxone was not available at the moment of overdose.
- **Fentanyl test strips** allow individuals to detect the presence of fentanyl in their supply. Studies show that 70-90% of people who test positive for fentanyl modify their behavior -- using less, using with others present, or having naloxone on hand (Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, 2022).
- **Supervised consumption sites** have operated in over 120 facilities across 14 countries. In their combined history of over 6 million supervised injections, not a single person has died of an overdose at a supervised consumption site (EMCDDA, 2023).
- **Syringe services programs** are the single most effective intervention for preventing HIV and hepatitis C transmission among people who inject drugs, while also serving as the primary entry point to treatment for many participants.

## Vision for Reform

A comprehensive harm reduction framework for the United States would include:

1. **Universal naloxone access**: Over-the-counter naloxone in every pharmacy, community distribution at no cost, naloxone in all first responder vehicles, and co-prescribing with every opioid prescription
2. **SSP expansion**: Legal authorization and public funding for syringe services programs in every state, with flexible operating models including fixed sites, mobile units, and secondary exchange
3. **Supervised consumption authorization**: Federal legal framework enabling states and localities to authorize supervised consumption sites, with rigorous evaluation and community engagement requirements
4. **Drug checking legalization**: Removal of fentanyl test strips and other drug checking technologies from paraphernalia statutes nationwide, with public funding for community-based drug checking services
5. **MAT on demand**: Elimination of the X-waiver and remaining barriers to buprenorphine prescribing, expansion of methadone access beyond the current clinic-based model, and same-day treatment initiation in emergency departments and jails
6. **Stigma reduction**: Federal public education campaigns, healthcare provider training, and language reform (person-first, non-stigmatizing terminology)
7. **Sustained funding**: Dedicated federal funding stream for harm reduction comparable to HIV prevention investment, not subject to annual appropriations politics
