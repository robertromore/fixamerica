# Harm Reduction: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

This document presents draft legislation to establish a comprehensive federal harm reduction framework, authorize supervised consumption sites, expand syringe services programs, and remove legal barriers to evidence-based harm reduction tools. The legislative approach addresses the primary legal obstacles identified in this analysis: federal funding restrictions, the "crack house" statute's application to supervised consumption, drug paraphernalia laws covering harm reduction tools, and regulatory barriers to medication-assisted treatment access.

## Federal Legislation

### The Harm Reduction Access Act

**Purpose**: Establish a comprehensive federal framework for harm reduction services, provide dedicated funding, remove the ban on federal syringe purchase, legalize drug checking technologies, and expand naloxone access.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Harm Reduction Access Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Drug overdose is the leading cause of accidental death in the
    United States, with over 107,000 deaths in 2023.
(2) Harm reduction strategies, including syringe services programs,
    naloxone distribution, drug checking services, and medication-
    assisted treatment, are evidence-based interventions that reduce
    overdose deaths, prevent disease transmission, and connect
    individuals to healthcare and treatment.
(3) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National
    Institutes of Health, the World Health Organization, and every
    major medical association in the United States have endorsed harm
    reduction as an essential component of the public health response
    to substance use.
(4) Syringe services programs reduce HIV transmission by 50 to 60
    percent and increase participants' likelihood of entering drug
    treatment fivefold.
(5) Community naloxone distribution has been shown to reduce overdose
    mortality by 27 to 46 percent in communities where it is implemented.
(6) Drug checking technologies, including fentanyl test strips, enable
    individuals to identify the presence of fentanyl in substances,
    with 70 to 90 percent of individuals who test positive modifying
    their behavior to reduce overdose risk.
(7) Current federal funding restrictions, drug paraphernalia statutes,
    and regulatory barriers prevent the implementation of these
    evidence-based interventions at a scale commensurate with the
    crisis.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(a) HARM REDUCTION SERVICES.—The term "harm reduction services" means
    evidence-based strategies that reduce the negative health, social,

    2030 to carry out this section.

SEC. 7. GOOD SAMARITAN PROTECTIONS.

(a) FEDERAL IMMUNITY.—A person who, in good faith, seeks emergency
    medical assistance for an individual experiencing a drug-related
    overdose shall not be subject to Federal criminal prosecution for
    the possession or use of a controlled substance if the evidence
    for such prosecution was obtained as a result of the person
    seeking such assistance.
(b) STATE INCENTIVE.—The Secretary of Justice shall condition 10
    percent of Byrne JAG grant funding on States having in effect a
    law that provides immunity from criminal prosecution for drug
    possession for individuals who seek emergency medical assistance
    for a drug-related overdose.

SEC. 8. REPORTING AND EVALUATION.

(a) ANNUAL REPORT.—Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment
    and annually thereafter, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a
    report on—
    (1) the number and location of harm reduction programs funded;
    (2) naloxone kits distributed and overdose reversals reported;

    independent research entity to conduct a 5-year evaluation of the
    program established under this Act.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**: The Harm Reduction Access Act creates a comprehensive federal funding and authorization framework. Its most significant provisions are: (1) lifting the ban on federal syringe purchase, (2) excluding drug checking technologies from paraphernalia definitions with federal preemption, (3) creating a dedicated harm reduction funding stream separate from general substance abuse grants, and (4) establishing federal Good Samaritan protections.

**Potential Challenges**:

- Appropriations: Even if authorized, funding requires annual appropriations
- Syringe purchase: Strong opposition from some members of Congress who have maintained the ban for decades
- Federal preemption: States' rights concerns about overriding state paraphernalia laws
- Evaluation timeline: Five-year evaluation may delay program adjustments

**Refinements**:

- Consider making the grant program mandatory spending rather than discretionary to ensure funding stability
- Add explicit protections for program staff from criminal liability
- Include workforce development provisions for peer workers (certification, pay standards)

### The Supervised Consumption Authorization Act

**Purpose**: Amend 21 U.S.C. 856 to create a legal framework for states and localities to authorize supervised consumption sites, with rigorous evaluation and community engagement requirements.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Supervised Consumption Authorization Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Supervised consumption sites have operated in over 120 facilities
    across 14 countries with a combined record of over 6,000,000
    supervised drug consumptions and zero overdose deaths.
(2) Studies demonstrate that supervised consumption sites reduce
    overdose mortality by 26 to 35 percent in surrounding areas,
    increase treatment uptake by 30 to 50 percent among users, and
    do not increase drug use, drug trafficking, or crime.
(3) The first legally sanctioned supervised consumption sites in the
    United States, OnPoint NYC, have demonstrated feasibility and
    effectiveness, with over 165,000 visits, 1,800 overdose
    interventions, zero overdose deaths, and over 5,200 treatment
    referrals in their first three years of operation.
(4) The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in
    United States v. Safehouse, 985 F.3d 225 (3d Cir. 2021),
    interpreted section 856 of title 21, United States Code, to
    prohibit supervised consumption sites, creating a legal barrier
    to an evidence-based public health intervention.
(5) A federal framework authorizing supervised consumption under
    specified conditions will enable States and localities to respond
    to the overdose crisis with the full range of evidence-based
    tools available to peer nations.

SEC. 3. AMENDMENT TO SECTION 856.

Section 856 of title 21, United States Code, is amended by adding at
the end the following new subsection:
"(c) SUPERVISED CONSUMPTION EXEMPTION.—
    (1) IN GENERAL.—Subsections (a)(1) and (a)(2) shall not apply
        to a supervised consumption site that—
        (A) is authorized by the State or political subdivision in
            which it is located;
        (B) operates under a plan approved by the Secretary of
            Health and Human Services pursuant to paragraph (2);
        (C) meets the operational standards established under
            paragraph (3); and
        (D) complies with the reporting requirements under
            paragraph (4).
    (2) APPLICATION AND APPROVAL.—
        (A) A State, political subdivision, or nonprofit organization

            demonstrates—
            (i) State or local authorization;
            (ii) compliance with operational standards;
            (iii) a community engagement plan;
            (iv) a memorandum of understanding with local law
                 enforcement;
            (v) a plan for independent evaluation; and
            (vi) adequate medical staffing and emergency protocols.
        (C) The Secretary shall approve or deny applications within
            90 days of receipt.
    (3) OPERATIONAL STANDARDS.—The Secretary shall, not later than
        180 days after the date of enactment, promulgate regulations
        establishing operational standards for supervised consumption
        sites, including—
        (A) minimum medical staffing requirements, including the
            presence of a registered nurse or licensed practical
            nurse during all operating hours;
        (B) overdose response protocols, including naloxone
            availability and emergency medical procedures;
        (C) drug consumption monitoring procedures;
        (D) treatment referral protocols, including on-site or
            proximate access to medication-assisted treatment;
        (E) community engagement requirements, including Good
            Neighbor Agreements and community advisory boards;
        (F) security and public order protocols;
        (G) data collection and reporting standards;
        (H) facility design and sanitation standards; and
        (I) prohibition on drug sales or distribution at or near
            the facility.
    (4) REPORTING.—Each approved supervised consumption site shall
        report to the Secretary, on a quarterly basis—
        (A) the number of visits;
        (B) the number of overdose interventions and outcomes;
        (C) the number of referrals to treatment and confirmed
            treatment entries;
        (D) the number of HIV and hepatitis C tests and results;
        (E) data on public order in the surrounding area; and
        (F) any adverse events.
    (5) INDEPENDENT EVALUATION.—The Secretary shall contract with an
        independent research institution to conduct a comprehensive
        evaluation of all approved supervised consumption sites,
        including—
        (A) impact on overdose mortality in surrounding areas;
        (B) impact on drug-related crime;
        (C) impact on public drug use and syringe litter;
        (D) treatment entry rates among site users;
        (E) HIV and hepatitis C transmission rates;
        (F) cost-effectiveness analysis; and
        (G) community perception and impact.
    (6) REVOCATION.—The Secretary may revoke approval of a
        supervised consumption site that—
        (A) fails to comply with operational standards;
        (B) fails to submit required reports; or
        (C) demonstrates adverse outcomes that outweigh benefits,
            as determined by independent evaluation.
    (7) STAFF AND PARTICIPANT PROTECTIONS.—
        (A) No employee, volunteer, or contractor of an approved
            supervised consumption site shall be subject to Federal
            criminal prosecution for actions taken in the course of
            their duties at such site.
        (B) No individual using the services of an approved
            supervised consumption site shall be subject to Federal
            criminal prosecution solely on the basis of their
            presence at or use of such site.
    (8) LIMITATION.—Nothing in this subsection shall be construed
        to authorize—
        (A) the distribution or sale of controlled substances at
            a supervised consumption site;
        (B) the operation of a supervised consumption site without
            State or local authorization; or
        (C) the use of Federal funds for the purchase of controlled
            substances.

SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section—
(a) $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2026 for the establishment and
    operation of up to 10 supervised consumption pilot sites;
(b) $75,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
(c) $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
(d) such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 2029 and 2030.

SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**: The Supervised Consumption Authorization Act takes a carefully structured approach: it amends the specific federal statute (21 U.S.C. 856) that has been interpreted to prohibit SCS, but only for sites that meet rigorous operational standards, have state/local authorization, and undergo independent evaluation. This framework respects federalism while removing the federal legal barrier.

**Potential Challenges**:

- Constitutional: Commerce Clause questions about federal preemption of state authority to not authorize SCS
- DOJ opposition: The Department of Justice may oppose amending 856
- NIMBY at siting level: Even with federal authorization, local siting battles will be intense
- Evaluation timeline: Initial evaluation results may take 2-3 years

**Refinements**:

- Consider a sunset provision requiring Congressional reauthorization after 5 years based on evaluation data
- Add explicit provisions for addressing community concerns through mandatory Good Neighbor Agreements
- Include funding for community education campaigns in areas where SCS are proposed

## Regulatory Framework

### DEA Methadone Access Reform

**Existing Authority**: 21 CFR 1306.07; SAMHSA 42 CFR Part 8

**Draft Regulation**:

```text
PROPOSED RULE: EXPANSION OF METHADONE ACCESS FOR OPIOID USE DISORDER

1. PHARMACY DISPENSING.—Registered pharmacies meeting specified
   training and security requirements may dispense methadone for
   opioid use disorder pursuant to a valid prescription from a
   practitioner authorized to treat opioid use disorder.

2. MOBILE UNITS.—Opioid Treatment Programs may operate mobile
   medication units without the requirement for a fixed-site
   location, provided that:
   (a) the mobile unit is registered with SAMHSA;
   (b) licensed medical personnel are present;
   (c) appropriate security and diversion controls are maintained.

3. TAKE-HOME FLEXIBILITY.—The COVID-19 era take-home dosing
   flexibilities, including 28-day take-home for stable patients
   and 14-day take-home for less stable patients, shall be made
   permanent.

4. TELEHEALTH INTEGRATION.—OTPs may conduct intake and ongoing
   assessments via telehealth technologies, with in-person
   evaluation required within 30 days of intake.
```

**Explanation**: These regulatory changes do not require Congressional action. DEA and SAMHSA have the authority to reform methadone access regulations. The COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that take-home flexibility is safe and effective; making these changes permanent aligns regulation with evidence.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| Commerce Clause | Federal authority to regulate harm reduction services is grounded in the Commerce Clause, as drug use and its consequences have substantial effects on interstate commerce. The Controlled Substances Act itself rests on this authority. |
| Tenth Amendment | The Supervised Consumption Authorization Act respects state sovereignty by requiring state/local authorization as a prerequisite; federal action removes a federal barrier rather than imposing a federal mandate. |
| Eighth Amendment | Criminalizing addiction-related behavior (including paraphernalia possession by people with SUD) raises Eighth Amendment concerns under *Robinson v. California*, 370 U.S. 660 (1962) and *Martin v. City of Boise*, 920 F.3d 584 (9th Cir. 2019). |
| Due Process | Federal and state paraphernalia laws that criminalize harm reduction tools may be vulnerable to substantive due process challenges as applied to people with substance use disorders. |

### Preemption Questions

| Question | Analysis |
|----------|----------|
| Can federal law preempt state paraphernalia laws for drug checking? | Yes; the Supremacy Clause permits federal preemption of conflicting state laws when Congress acts within its Commerce Clause authority. The Harm Reduction Access Act includes express preemption for drug checking technologies. |
| Can states authorize SCS despite federal law? | Not under current law (*Safehouse*). The Supervised Consumption Authorization Act would create an express exemption, resolving the preemption question. |
| Can states be required to authorize SSPs? | No; the Tenth Amendment prevents the federal government from commandeering state legislatures. The approach here uses funding incentives, not mandates. |

### Enforcement Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Grant conditions | Federal funding conditioned on program compliance with operational standards |
| Reporting requirements | Quarterly and annual reporting ensures transparency and accountability |
| Independent evaluation | Third-party evaluation provides objective assessment of program outcomes |
| Revocation authority | Secretary of HHS can revoke SCS approval for non-compliance |
| Judicial review | Program operators and affected parties may challenge adverse decisions |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Harm Reduction Access Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Appropriations vulnerability | Authorization does not guarantee funding; annual appropriations required | Critical |
| State opt-out | Federal preemption of paraphernalia for drug checking may face state resistance | High |
| Program definition gaming | Broad definition of "harm reduction services" could be stretched to include non-evidence-based activities | Medium |
| Evaluation gaming | Programs could manipulate data to show favorable outcomes | Medium |
| Funding diversion | States could redirect harm reduction grants to enforcement or abstinence-only programs | High |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| No mandatory spending | Funding subject to political cycles | Congressional budget process |
| No criminal justice reform | Does not address drug possession criminalization that drives people away from services | Separate legislative track |
| Limited scope on housing | Does not address Housing First or housing access for PWUD | Requires cross-domain legislation |
| No insurance reform | Does not mandate private insurance coverage of harm reduction | Would face industry opposition |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Convert authorization to mandatory spending through reconciliation or trust fund mechanism
2. Add anti-diversion provisions requiring that 90% of grant funds be used for direct harm reduction services
3. Strengthen program definitions with specific evidence requirements for funded activities
4. Add independent auditing requirements for all grantees
5. Include protections against state retaliation (e.g., states cannot penalize localities that operate SSPs)

### Supervised Consumption Authorization Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| State veto | Requires state/local authorization; hostile states can block SCS | High |
| Slow approval process | 90-day federal approval timeline could be extended by administrative delay | Medium |
| Operational standard manipulation | HHS could set standards so high as to effectively block SCS | High |
| Revocation power abuse | Secretary could revoke approval for political reasons | Medium |
| No private right of action | Individuals cannot sue to compel SCS authorization | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Requires both federal and state action | Double veto point reduces likelihood of implementation | Federalism design |
| Pilot scale limitation | Initial authorization for only 10 sites | Political feasibility |
| No federal funding for operations | Authorizes but may not fund ongoing SCS operations | Budget constraints |
| NIMBY not addressed | Does not preempt local zoning barriers | Local control concerns |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Add provisions allowing localities to authorize SCS even without state authorization (home rule protection)
2. Include dedicated operational funding in addition to startup grants
3. Add expedited judicial review for approval denials
4. Include provisions preventing discriminatory zoning barriers against SCS (analogous to RLUIPA for religious land use)
5. Establish an independent review board for revocation decisions to prevent politicization

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| Political reversibility | Sunset provisions with automatic renewal unless Congress acts to terminate; mandatory evaluation reporting to prevent quiet defunding |
| Workforce shortage | Include peer worker certification and training programs; student loan forgiveness for harm reduction workers |
| Data infrastructure | Require standardized data collection across all funded programs; invest in real-time surveillance |
| Equity gaps | Mandate demographic reporting and equity targets; prioritize funding for communities with highest disparities |
| Coordination across agencies | Establish interagency harm reduction coordination body (HHS, DOJ, DEA, CDC, SAMHSA) |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

- Five-year authorization with mandatory reauthorization review
- Annual Congressional reporting on program outcomes
- Independent evaluation at Year 3 and Year 5
- Automatic continuation of funding if reauthorization is not completed on time (preventing program disruption)
- GAO audit of program effectiveness at Year 4
