# Harm Reduction: Stakeholders

## Overview

The harm reduction landscape involves a complex web of stakeholders with varying levels of power, interest, and alignment. Understanding these relationships is essential for building effective coalitions and navigating opposition. This analysis maps stakeholders by their role, influence, position, and potential for engagement.

## Primary Stakeholders: People Directly Affected

### People Who Use Drugs (PWUD)

The most critical stakeholders are the people harm reduction is designed to serve.

| Dimension | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Estimated population | 20-25 million Americans use illicit drugs annually (SAMHSA NSDUH, 2023) |
| People who inject drugs (PWID) | 3.7 million estimated (CDC, 2022) |
| People with opioid use disorder | 5.6 million (SAMHSA NSDUH, 2023) |
| People with stimulant use disorder | 1.8 million (methamphetamine); 1.4 million (cocaine) |
| Polysubstance use | 65%+ of overdose deaths involve multiple substances |
| Current position | Strongly supportive of harm reduction |
| Political power | Very low; marginalized, often disenfranchised, stigmatized |

**Key needs:**

- Access to sterile injection supplies, naloxone, fentanyl test strips
- Non-judgmental healthcare and social services
- Medication-assisted treatment on demand
- Protection from criminalization
- Affordable housing and employment support
- Peer support from people with lived experience

**Barriers to engagement:**

- Stigma and fear of identification
- Criminal justice involvement
- Lack of political representation
- Health crises and survival priorities
- Distrust of institutions

### Families and Loved Ones

| Dimension | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Estimated affected families | 46+ million Americans have a family member with SUD (Surgeon General, 2016) |
| Position | Mixed; generally supportive of naloxone and treatment access; divided on SSPs and SCS |
| Political power | Moderate; increasingly organized and vocal |
| Key organizations | Moms United to End the War on Drugs, FED UP! Coalition, Parents for Drug Policy Reform |

**Internal divisions:**

- Families that have lost loved ones to overdose tend to strongly support harm reduction
- Families in active crisis are often divided between harm reduction and abstinence-based approaches
- Some family groups advocate for mandatory treatment (which conflicts with harm reduction principles)
- The "tough love" tradition creates internal tension about enabling vs. supporting

### Communities Near Harm Reduction Services

| Dimension | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Position | Mixed; concerns about neighborhood effects vs. improved public order |
| Political power | High at local level; zoning and permitting decisions |
| Key concern | Drug activity, public injection, discarded syringes, property values |
| Evidence | Studies consistently show SSPs reduce public syringe litter and do not increase crime |
