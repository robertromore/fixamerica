# Harm Reduction: Proposed Solutions

## Overview

The solutions for comprehensive harm reduction in the United States are well-established, evidence-based, and operational in peer nations. The challenge is not identifying what works but overcoming the political, legal, and cultural barriers to implementation. This section outlines a comprehensive policy framework organized by intervention type, with evidence, implementation considerations, and cost analyses for each.

| Funding | Dedicated federal funding stream for SSPs; lift ban on federal purchase of syringes |
| Coverage model | Fixed sites in urban centers; mobile units for suburban/rural areas; mail-based for remote areas; pharmacy-based partnerships |
| Service standard | Minimum service package: sterile equipment, naloxone, HIV/HCV testing, treatment referral, wound care |
| Needs-based distribution | Remove one-for-one exchange requirements; adopt needs-based distribution |
| Peer workforce | Fund peer worker positions at all SSPs; people with lived experience as core staff |

### Evidence Base

## Solution 7: Safer Smoking Supply Distribution

### Description

Expand distribution of safer smoking supplies (glass stems, mouthpieces, screens) to reduce risks associated with smoking drugs, including burns, infections, and transition to injection.

### Rationale

| Factor | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Smoking prevalence | Increasing proportion of drug use involves smoking (fentanyl, methamphetamine, crack cocaine) |
| Risk reduction | Safer smoking supplies prevent oral and respiratory injuries, reduce infection transmission |
| Injection prevention | Safer smoking supplies may prevent transition from smoking to injection |
| Current status | ~62% of SSPs distribute safer smoking supplies; political controversy around federal funding |

### Evidence Base

| Outcome | Evidence | Source |
|---------|----------|--------|
| Reduced sharing of smoking equipment | 35% reduction when safer supplies available | *Harm Reduction Journal*, 2021 |
| Reduced oral lesions and burns | Significant reduction in mouth/lip injuries | *Drug and Alcohol Review*, 2020 |
