# Racial Disparities in Drug Policy: Legislation

## Overview

Addressing racial disparities in drug enforcement requires a comprehensive legislative strategy operating at federal and state levels. The approach combines sentencing equalization (eliminating the crack/powder cocaine disparity), enforcement transparency (mandatory racial data collection), prosecutorial accountability (constraining discretion that produces disparate outcomes), collateral consequence relief (removing post-conviction penalties that perpetuate disadvantage), community reinvestment (directing resources to harmed communities), and cannabis equity (ensuring legalization benefits those most harmed by prohibition). This document provides draft text for the most critical federal legislation, a model state act, and a regulatory framework for implementation.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for the reforms proposed in this analysis.* The federal government possesses adequate authority under the Commerce Clause, the Spending Clause, and Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enact sentencing reform, condition federal funding on data collection, and regulate cannabis markets. State legislatures possess plenary authority over their own criminal sentencing, policing standards, and cannabis regulation.

## Federal Legislation

### The Drug Enforcement Equity Act

**Purpose**: Eliminate the crack/powder cocaine sentencing disparity, mandate racial data collection in drug enforcement, establish enforceable prosecutorial charging guidelines, remove federal collateral consequences of drug convictions, and create a community reinvestment fund for neighborhoods most harmed by the War on Drugs.

**Key Provisions**:

1. Equalize crack/powder cocaine sentencing at 1:1 (retroactive)
2. Require all federally funded law enforcement agencies to collect and report drug enforcement data by race
3. Codify prosecutorial charging guidelines limiting mandatory minimum use in low-level drug cases
4. Eliminate federal collateral consequences of drug convictions (public housing, SNAP/TANF, student aid)
5. Establish the Drug War Community Reinvestment Fund ($10 billion over 10 years)
6. Create the DOJ Office of Enforcement Equity

**Draft Text**:

119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To eliminate racial disparities in federal drug enforcement and sentencing,
establish data transparency requirements, provide collateral consequence
relief, and invest in communities harmed by the War on Drugs.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Drug Enforcement Equity Act of 2027".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) According to the ACLU (2020), Black Americans are 3.73 times more
likely than white Americans to be arrested for marijuana possession
despite roughly comparable rates of use.

(2) According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission (FY2022), Black
individuals constitute 77.1 percent of federal crack cocaine offenders
while representing 13.6 percent of the U.S. population.

(3) According to the Sentencing Project (2023), Black Americans are
incarcerated for drug offenses at 5.8 times the rate of white Americans.

(4) The U.S. Sentencing Commission has recommended elimination of the
crack/powder cocaine sentencing disparity in reports issued in 1995,
1997, 2002, and 2007, concluding that the disparity overstates the
relative harmfulness of crack cocaine.

(5) The First Step Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-391) made the Fair
Sentencing Act retroactive, resulting in approximately 4,000 sentence
reductions, 91 percent of which were granted to Black individuals.

(6) Federal collateral consequences of drug convictions, including
barriers to public housing, public benefits, and federal student aid,
disproportionately affect communities of color and perpetuate cycles
of disadvantage.

(7) The absence of comprehensive, disaggregated data on drug
enforcement actions by race prevents identification, measurement,
and remediation of disparities.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:

(1) COVERED AGENCY.—The term "covered agency" means any State or
local law enforcement agency that receives Federal funding under
the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program (34 U.S.C.

program.

(2) DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED AREA.—The term "disproportionately
impacted area" means a census tract that, during the period from
1980 through 2020, had a per-capita drug arrest rate in the top
quartile of census tracts nationally, as determined by the Attorney
General using available arrest data.

(3) DRUG ENFORCEMENT ACTION.—The term "drug enforcement action"
means any stop, search, arrest, charge, prosecution, conviction,
or sentence related to a controlled substance offense.

```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 2 (Findings)**: Establishes the factual record of racial disparities using the most authoritative sources, creating a legislative record supporting congressional action.
- **Section 4 (Crack/Powder Equalization)**: Eliminates the 18:1 crack/powder cocaine sentencing disparity by setting a 1:1 ratio, with full retroactivity and expedited judicial review. This addresses the single most documented example of racially disparate drug sentencing.
- **Section 5 (Data Transparency)**: Creates the data infrastructure essential for identifying, measuring, and remedying disparities. The graduated funding reduction for non-compliance ensures participation without creating an unfunded mandate.
- **Section 6 (Charging Guidelines)**: Constrains the prosecutorial discretion that the U.S. Sentencing Commission has identified as a primary driver of sentencing disparities. The APA notice-and-comment requirement prevents unilateral reversal by future administrations.
- **Section 7 (Collateral Consequence Relief)**: Removes the federal penalties that perpetuate disadvantage after a sentence is served, addressing housing, benefits, and education barriers.
- **Section 9 (Community Reinvestment)**: Directs investment to communities identified through arrest data as having borne the greatest burden of drug enforcement, with community-controlled governance.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Crack/powder equalization takes effect | Upon enactment | Automatic (statutory) |
| Attorney General issues charging guidelines | 180 days after enactment | DOJ |
| Federal agencies begin data reporting | 180 days after enactment | All federal law enforcement |
| Office of Enforcement Equity operational | 12 months after enactment | DOJ |
| State/local agencies begin data reporting | 24 months after enactment | Covered agencies |
| First community reinvestment grants awarded | 18-24 months after enactment | Office of Enforcement Equity |
| First annual disparity report published | 12 months after enactment | Attorney General |
| Retroactive resentencing petitions processed | 18 months after enactment | Federal courts |

**Regulatory Authority**: The Attorney General, through the Office of Enforcement Equity, implements data collection standards, community reinvestment grant guidelines, and prosecutorial charging guidelines. HUD, USDA, and the Department of Education implement collateral consequence reforms through agency rulemaking.

**Challenges**:

- **Senate filibuster**: The comprehensive nature of the bill may make it difficult to secure 60 Senate votes. Component parts (e.g., EQUAL Act, collateral consequence relief) could be advanced separately if needed.
- **Prosecutorial resistance**: The National District Attorneys Association will oppose statutory charging guidelines as an intrusion on prosecutorial independence.
- **Data system costs**: Building a national drug enforcement data system across 18,000 agencies requires significant investment and technical coordination.

**Refinements**:

- **Modular approach**: If the comprehensive bill stalls, advance Title I (crack/powder equalization), Title II (data transparency), and Title III (collateral consequence relief) as separate bills.
- **Sunset provision**: Include a 10-year reauthorization requirement for the community reinvestment fund to ensure ongoing congressional review.
- **Safe harbor**: Allow agencies a transition period for data compliance before funding reductions begin.

## State Model Legislation

### Model Drug Enforcement Equity Act

**Purpose**: Provide a template for states to mandate racial data collection in drug enforcement, restrict pretextual stops, establish prosecutorial transparency requirements, and provide for automatic record expungement of low-level drug convictions.

**Adaptability Notes**: States should customize data collection requirements based on existing infrastructure; adjust pretextual stop restrictions to reflect state constitutional law and existing traffic code; and tailor expungement provisions to the state's criminal record system.

**Draft Text**:

```text
AN ACT

Relating to racial equity in drug enforcement, data transparency,
pretextual traffic stops, prosecutorial accountability, and record
expungement.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "[State] Drug
Enforcement Equity Act of [Year]".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS.

The [State] Legislature finds that:

(a) Racial disparities exist in [State]'s drug enforcement system,
with [minority group] residents arrested for drug offenses at [X]
times the rate of white residents despite comparable rates of drug
use.

(b) These disparities erode public trust in law enforcement, impose
disproportionate costs on communities of color, and do not enhance
public safety.

(c) Data transparency, enforcement standards, and record relief are
necessary to ensure equal treatment under law.

SECTION 3. DRUG ENFORCEMENT DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING.

(a) Every law enforcement agency in this State shall collect and
report to the [State Bureau of Investigation / Department of Public
Safety], on a quarterly basis, disaggregated data on all drug
enforcement actions, including the race, ethnicity, age, and gender
of individuals subject to each action.

(b) The [Agency] shall publish an annual report analyzing the data
collected under this section, identifying agencies with statistically
significant racial disparities, and recommending corrective actions.

(c) The annual report shall be made publicly available on the
[Agency's] website.

SECTION 4. RESTRICTION ON PRETEXTUAL TRAFFIC STOPS.

(a) No law enforcement officer shall initiate a traffic stop based
solely on—
    (1) a non-moving vehicle equipment violation;
    (2) an expired vehicle registration of less than 120 days;
    (3) failure to use a turn signal where no other vehicle is
    affected; or
    (4) a single broken or non-functional taillight.

(b) No law enforcement officer shall request consent to search a
vehicle during a traffic stop for a minor traffic violation unless
the officer has probable cause to believe the vehicle contains
evidence of a crime.

SECTION 5. PROSECUTORIAL TRANSPARENCY.

(a) Each county or district prosecutor's office shall publish
annual data on drug offense charging decisions, including—
    (1) the race, ethnicity, and gender of defendants;
    (2) the charges filed;
    (3) the disposition of each case (dismissal, plea, trial);
    (4) the sentence imposed; and
    (5) whether mandatory minimum sentences were triggered.

SECTION 6. AUTOMATIC RECORD EXPUNGEMENT.

(a) Any conviction for simple possession of a controlled substance
in an amount consistent with personal use shall be automatically
expunged from the individual's criminal record—
    (1) 3 years after completion of the sentence (including any
    probation or parole); and
    (2) provided the individual has no subsequent felony conviction.

(b) The [State Courts Administrator] shall develop an automated
system to identify and process eligible records.

SECTION 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on [date], except that Section 3
shall take effect 12 months after [date] to allow agencies time
to develop data collection systems.
```

---

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: U.S. Department of Justice (federal); state departments of public safety and attorneys general (state)

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **Drug Enforcement Data Standards**: DOJ must promulgate regulations defining data collection fields, reporting formats, and privacy protections. Statutory deadline: 180 days after enactment.
2. **Community Reinvestment Grant Guidelines**: Office of Enforcement Equity must establish eligibility criteria, application procedures, and performance metrics for community reinvestment grants. Statutory deadline: 12 months after enactment.
3. **Charging Guidelines**: Attorney General must issue prosecutorial charging guidelines for federal drug cases. Statutory deadline: 180 days after enactment. Guidelines require APA notice-and-comment rulemaking for modification or rescission.
4. **Collateral Consequence Implementation**: HUD (public housing), USDA (SNAP/TANF), and Department of Education (student aid) must amend regulations to implement collateral consequence relief. Statutory deadline: 12 months after enactment.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Civil Penalties**: Agencies that fail to comply with data reporting requirements face graduated federal funding reductions (10%, 25%, 50%).
- **Administrative Actions**: The Office of Enforcement Equity may issue compliance orders to agencies with persistent unjustified disparities, requiring corrective action plans.
- **Inspector General Review**: The DOJ Inspector General reviews federal prosecutorial charging data annually for disparities.
- **Private Right of Action**: *Not included in this draft*. Enforcement relies on federal funding conditions and administrative oversight rather than private litigation, reducing the burden on individual plaintiffs and the courts.

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Commerce Clause Authority**: Congress has broad authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate controlled substances (upheld in *Gonzales v. Raich*, 545 U.S. 1, 2005). This authority extends to setting sentencing ratios, establishing data collection requirements, and creating federal grant conditions.

**Spending Clause**: Federal funding conditions (data transparency requirements tied to Byrne JAG and COPS grants) are constitutional under the Spending Clause as interpreted in *South Dakota v. Dole*, 483 U.S. 203 (1987), provided they are (1) related to the federal interest in the program, (2) unambiguous, and (3) not coercive. The graduated penalty structure and reasonable compliance timeline address the coercion concern raised in *NFIB v. Sebelius*, 567 U.S. 519 (2012).

**Equal Protection**: Community reinvestment provisions use geographic criteria (disproportionately impacted areas defined by arrest data) rather than racial classifications, avoiding strict scrutiny under current Equal Protection doctrine. This approach is designed to survive *Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard* (2023) by targeting communities based on the documented impact of drug enforcement rather than racial demographics per se.

### Preemption

Federal sentencing reform (crack/powder equalization) applies to federal cases only and does not preempt state sentencing laws. Data collection requirements are imposed as conditions of federal funding, not as direct mandates, preserving state sovereignty. Collateral consequence relief applies to federal programs (public housing, SNAP/TANF, student aid) and does not override state-imposed collateral consequences.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance is ensured through: (1) graduated federal funding reductions for non-compliant agencies, creating strong financial incentives; (2) Inspector General oversight of federal prosecutorial charging data; (3) annual public reporting requirements that create political accountability; and (4) community advisory boards for reinvestment grants that ensure local accountability.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| Data gaming by agencies | Agencies could reclassify drug stops or arrests under non-drug categories to avoid reporting disparities | High | Require reporting of all stops and searches, not just drug-specific actions; audit a random sample of agency records annually |
| Prosecutorial workaround on mandatory minimums | Federal prosecutors could circumvent charging restrictions by referring cases to state prosecutors who are not bound by federal guidelines | High | Include "anti-circumvention" provision prohibiting referral to state courts for the purpose of avoiding federal charging restrictions; track federal-to-state referral patterns |
| Geographic definition manipulation | The definition of "disproportionately impacted area" could be drawn to include or exclude specific neighborhoods based on political rather than equity considerations | Medium | Use census tract-level data with objective, publicly verifiable criteria; require independent verification by GAO |
| Delayed implementation by hostile administration | A future administration could delay rulemaking, slow data system development, or reduce Office of Enforcement Equity staffing | Medium | Include statutory deadlines with automatic consequences (e.g., default data standards take effect if DOJ misses deadline); protect Office of Enforcement Equity funding through mandatory appropriation |
| Collateral consequence workaround by states | States could create new collateral consequences for drug convictions to replace the federal ones eliminated by this Act | Medium | Include reporting requirement on state collateral consequences; condition additional federal funding on state reform of collateral consequences |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| No private right of action | Individuals cannot sue to enforce data transparency or charging guidelines; enforcement depends on DOJ and IG | Political compromise -- private right of action would face strong opposition from prosecutors and law enforcement | Strengthen IG independence and resources; provide for congressional enforcement through subpoena and oversight |
| State sentencing not directly addressed | Federal legislation reforms federal sentencing only; ~80% of drug incarceration occurs in state prisons | Federalism -- Congress lacks authority to directly reform state sentencing | Model state legislation provided; federal funding conditions incentivize state reform; state advocacy toolkit included |
| Data compliance lag | 24-month compliance window for state/local agencies means disparities continue unreported for 2+ years | Technical necessity -- agencies need time to develop data systems | Provide substantial technical assistance ($150 million); encourage early compliance through bonus grants |
| Community reinvestment fund requires annual appropriations | Future Congresses could underfund or zero out the Fund | Appropriations process is inherently political and uncertain | Authorize multi-year funding; advocate for mandatory (rather than discretionary) spending status |
| Retroactive resentencing depends on judicial willingness | Courts may deny petitions even when defendants are eligible | Judicial discretion; "dangerousness" determination is subjective | Establish presumption of resentencing; burden on government to prove dangerousness; provide public defenders for petition assistance |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Anti-gaming amendment**: Add a provision requiring reporting of all law enforcement stops and searches, not just those classified as drug-related. Require annual audits of a random sample of agency records by the Office of Enforcement Equity.
2. **Anti-circumvention provision**: Add Section 6(c): "No United States Attorney shall refer a case to state prosecution for the purpose of avoiding the charging restrictions established under this section. The Inspector General shall track federal-to-state referral patterns by race and report annually."
3. **Default standards provision**: Add Section 5(e): "If the Attorney General fails to issue data collection standards within 180 days of enactment, the interim standards published by the Office of Enforcement Equity shall take effect automatically."
4. **State incentive provision**: Add Section 13: "States that enact legislation substantially equivalent to the data collection and collateral consequence reform provisions of this Act shall receive a 10 percent bonus in federal law enforcement grant funding."
5. **Resentencing presumption**: Amend Section 4(b)(2) to read: "There shall be a rebuttable presumption that the petitioner is eligible for resentencing. The government shall bear the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the petitioner poses a specific, identifiable danger to public safety."

### Sunset and Review Provisions

The Drug War Community Reinvestment Fund is authorized for 10 years (FY2028-FY2037) and must be reauthorized by Congress. Data transparency requirements have no sunset provision and continue indefinitely. The Attorney General must submit a 5-year comprehensive evaluation to Congress, including recommendations for legislative amendments, no later than 5 years after enactment. GAO is directed to conduct an independent evaluation at year 7.
