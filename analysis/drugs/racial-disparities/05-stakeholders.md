# Racial Disparities in Drug Policy: Stakeholders

The landscape of racial disparities in drug enforcement is shaped by the interactions of communities directly harmed by disparate enforcement, law enforcement agencies that carry out drug policy, prosecutors who exercise charging discretion, legislators who set sentencing structures, reform organizations, and a growing cannabis industry whose ownership demographics reflect the very disparities reform seeks to address.

## Who Is Affected

### Primary Stakeholders

| Group | Impact | Size | Key Interests |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|
| Black Americans arrested or incarcerated for drug offenses | Disproportionate arrest, prosecution, and incarceration; collateral consequences in employment, housing, voting | ~330,000 Black individuals arrested annually for drug offenses; ~120,000 incarcerated for drug offenses (federal + state) | Equal enforcement, sentencing reform, record expungement, restoration of rights |
| Latino/Hispanic Americans targeted in drug enforcement | Disproportionate targeting in border enforcement, fentanyl and methamphetamine cases; immigration consequences | ~225,000 Hispanic individuals arrested annually for drug offenses; 42.7% of federal drug offenders | Equal enforcement, immigration consequence relief, equitable sentencing |
| Families of incarcerated individuals | Family disruption, economic hardship, children growing up with incarcerated parents | ~2.7 million children have an incarcerated parent; disproportionately Black and Hispanic | Family reunification, collateral consequence reform, economic support |
| Communities with concentrated drug enforcement | Neighborhood destabilization, erosion of police trust, economic disinvestment | Hundreds of communities, primarily in urban areas, with high per-capita drug arrest rates | Community investment, policing reform, economic opportunity |
| People with drug felony convictions | Lifetime collateral consequences in housing, employment, education, voting | ~14 million Americans with drug felony convictions (cumulative) | Expungement, record sealing, ban-the-box employment policies, restoration of voting rights |

### Secondary Stakeholders

- **Drug users across all racial groups**: Approximately 59.3 million Americans aged 12+ used illicit drugs in the past year (SAMHSA NSDUH, 2023), but only a fraction are arrested, and those arrested are disproportionately people of color.
- **Public housing residents**: Drug enforcement in and around public housing affects residents who may face eviction under "one-strike" policies for any household member's drug activity, regardless of personal involvement.
- **Students**: Young people with drug convictions face barriers to federal financial aid and school enrollment, disproportionately affecting Black and Hispanic students.
- **Employers and the labor market**: Criminal records reduce the employable labor pool and cost the economy an estimated $87 billion annually in lost GDP (Center for Economic and Policy Research, 2016).

## Who Has Power

### Decision Makers

| Actor | Role | Authority | Resources | Influence Level |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| U.S. Congress | Sets federal drug sentencing law, mandatory minimums, funding levels | Legislative authority over Controlled Substances Act, sentencing statutes | $46.1 billion federal drug control budget (FY2025) | High |
| U.S. Attorney General / DOJ | Sets federal prosecution policy, charging guidelines | Directs 93 U.S. Attorneys, oversees DEA, BOP | 113,000+ DOJ employees; $38.6 billion budget (FY2024) | High |
| State legislatures | Set state drug sentencing laws, decriminalization policies, cannabis legalization | Plenary state legislative authority | Varies by state | High |
| Local prosecutors (~2,300 elected DAs) | Charging decisions, plea bargaining, diversion eligibility | Near-total discretion over individual cases | Office budgets; political capital | High |
| Local police departments (~18,000 agencies) | Arrest decisions, patrol allocation, stop-and-search practices | Street-level enforcement discretion | Varies; collectively hundreds of billions in budgets | High |
| Federal judiciary | Sentencing within guidelines, constitutional review | Sentencing authority, judicial review | Lifetime appointment; independent budget | Medium |
| U.S. Sentencing Commission | Recommends sentencing guidelines, publishes disparity data | Advisory; guidelines are non-binding post-*Booker* (2005) | ~$19 million annual budget | Medium |
| State governors | Clemency power, appointment of corrections and public safety officials | Executive authority, pardon/commutation power | Varies by state | Medium |

### Key Organizations and Institutions

- **Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)**: Federal agency responsible for drug scheduling and enforcement. Budget of $3.3 billion (FY2024). The DEA has historically resisted calls to reschedule marijuana and has defended aggressive enforcement strategies.
- **Bureau of Prisons (BOP)**: Manages federal prisons where 45.3% of inmates are serving drug sentences. Budget of $8.9 billion (FY2024).
- **Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP)**: Coordinates federal drug policy across agencies. Has shifted rhetoric toward public health under Democratic administrations but retains enforcement-oriented structure.
- **National District Attorneys Association (NDAA)**: Represents elected prosecutors. Has historically opposed mandatory minimum reform and prosecutorial transparency requirements.
- **Fraternal Order of Police (FOP)**: The largest police union in the United States (356,000 members). Has opposed restrictions on pretextual stops, consent searches, and drug-free zone enhancements.

### Influencers

- **ACLU**: The leading organization documenting marijuana arrest disparities. Its 2013 and 2020 reports on marijuana arrest data have been the most cited evidence of racial disparities.
- **The Sentencing Project**: Provides authoritative data on racial disparities in incarceration and sentencing. Its reports are regularly cited by courts, legislators, and media.
- **Drug Policy Alliance (DPA)**: Major reform organization advocating for decriminalization, harm reduction, and racial equity. Played a key role in Oregon's Measure 110 campaign.
- **National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP)**: Has long advocated for criminal justice reform and has specifically targeted racial disparities in drug enforcement since the 1990s.
- **Last Prisoner Project**: Advocates for the release of people incarcerated for cannabis offenses, focusing on racial equity in the context of legalization.
- **Koch Network / Right on Crime**: Conservative criminal justice reform initiative that has supported sentencing reform and reentry programs, providing bipartisan cover for reform.
- **Cannabis industry trade groups (National Cannabis Industry Association, Marijuana Policy Project)**: Advocate for federal legalization and banking access; increasingly support social equity provisions.

## Stakeholder Interests and Alignment

### Aligned Interests (Potential Coalition Partners)

| Coalition | Shared Interest | Strength |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Civil rights organizations + Criminal justice reform groups + Public defenders | Eliminating racial disparities in arrests, sentencing, and collateral consequences | Strong |
| Progressive prosecutors + Defense attorneys + Reentry organizations | Reducing incarceration, expanding diversion, removing collateral consequences | Strong |
| Libertarian policy groups + Civil liberties organizations + Cannabis industry | Ending drug prohibition, reducing government enforcement power | Moderate |
| Conservative fiscal reformers + Criminal justice reform advocates | Reducing incarceration costs, improving public safety outcomes | Moderate |
| Cannabis industry + Social equity advocates | Federal legalization with equity provisions | Moderate (tension over pace and scope) |
| Faith communities + Reentry organizations + Families of incarcerated | Second chances, family reunification, community restoration | Moderate |

### Conflicting Interests

- **Law enforcement unions vs. Reform advocates**: Police unions seek to preserve officer discretion in stops, searches, and arrests, while reform organizations seek to constrain discretion through data collection mandates, consent search bans, and mandatory racial impact analysis.
- **Prosecutors vs. Transparency advocates**: Elected prosecutors resist charging data transparency requirements that would expose racial disparities in their offices, while reformers argue that transparency is essential for accountability.
- **Cannabis industry (established operators) vs. Social equity applicants**: Existing cannabis businesses, which are predominantly white-owned, resist equity licensing preferences that limit their market share, while equity advocates argue that communities harmed by prohibition must receive priority access to the legal market.
- **Tough-on-crime politicians vs. Data-driven reformers**: Some elected officials continue to advocate for aggressive drug enforcement as a public safety strategy, resisting evidence that enforcement disparities undermine public safety by eroding community trust in police.

### The Drug Enforcement Iron Triangle

The persistence of racially disparate drug enforcement is reinforced by a self-sustaining triangle of interests:

1. **Law enforcement agencies** benefit from drug arrest metrics that justify budgets, federal grants (Byrne JAG), and civil asset forfeiture revenue.
2. **Elected prosecutors** build careers on high conviction rates, which are easiest to achieve in over-policed minority communities where defendants lack resources for private counsel.
3. **Legislators** (particularly in competitive districts) benefit politically from appearing "tough on crime" and face little electoral cost from enforcement concentrated in minority communities that may not be their constituents.

These three actors reinforce each other: law enforcement provides arrest data that legislators cite to justify funding, prosecutors secure convictions that law enforcement uses to demonstrate effectiveness, and legislators provide the statutory authority and funding that sustain the system.

## Influence Mechanisms

How stakeholders exert influence on drug enforcement policy:

- **Lobbying**: The private prison industry spent $5.6 million on federal lobbying in 2022 (OpenSecrets). The Fraternal Order of Police and National District Attorneys Association lobby against mandatory data collection, sentencing reform, and prosecutorial accountability measures.
- **Campaign Contributions**: In the 2022 election cycle, law enforcement PACs contributed $5.2 million to federal candidates, predominantly to those opposing criminal justice reform (OpenSecrets, 2023). The cannabis industry contributed $10.1 million, predominantly to reform-supporting candidates.
- **Revolving Door**: Former prosecutors frequently enter politics or join law firms that defend the current system. Former law enforcement officials staff the DEA, ONDCP, and state drug enforcement agencies, perpetuating institutional culture.
- **Public Advocacy**: Civil rights organizations, reform groups, and affected families use media campaigns, protests, and community organizing to build public support for reform. The 2020 racial justice movement demonstrated the power of public advocacy to shift political discourse.
- **Expertise/Information**: The U.S. Sentencing Commission, academic researchers, and organizations like the ACLU and The Sentencing Project produce the data and analysis that inform legislative debates. Control over the framing of data -- whether disparities are presented as evidence of bias or as evidence of different crime rates -- significantly shapes policy outcomes.
