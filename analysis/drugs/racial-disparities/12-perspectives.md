# Racial Disparities in Drug Policy: Political Perspectives Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes racial disparities in drug policy through nine distinct political perspectives, evaluating current state assessments, root cause analyses, proposed solutions, and legislation. Each perspective receives engagement consistency ratings and position scores, culminating in compromise proposals that bridge multiple viewpoints.

Racial disparities in drug enforcement raise fundamental questions about the nature of American justice, the proper role of government power, individual liberty, racial equality, and the balance between public safety and civil rights. How one explains the documented 3.73:1 Black-to-white marijuana arrest ratio -- whether as evidence of systemic racism, differential offending, flawed policy design, or government overreach -- reveals deep philosophical commitments. Different political traditions offer sharply divergent diagnoses and prescriptions.

## Perspective Definitions

| Perspective | Core Values | Policy Orientation |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Tradition, limited government, individual responsibility | Incremental change, fiscal restraint, market solutions |
| Liberal | Progress, equality, social responsibility | Government as problem-solver, regulation, safety nets |
| Progressive | Systemic change, economic justice, structural reform | Transformative reform, wealth redistribution, worker power |
| Libertarian | Individual liberty, minimal state, free markets | Deregulation, privatization, voluntary association |
| Constitutionalist | Original intent, enumerated powers, federalism | Strict constitutional limits, states' rights |
| Populist | Anti-elite, pro-worker, economic nationalism | Trade protection, anti-monopoly, immigration restriction |
| Centrist | Pragmatism, compromise, incremental progress | Bipartisan solutions, evidence-based policy |
| Religious Right | Faith-based values, traditional morality | Social conservatism, religious liberty |
| Democratic Socialist | Worker ownership, public goods, democratic control | Public investment, labor rights, universal programs |

## Scoring Framework

### Position Scores (1-10)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10 | Full agreement with project analysis |
| 7-9 | Substantial to strong agreement |
| 5-6 | Mixed/moderate agreement |
| 3-4 | Substantial disagreement |
| 1-2 | Strong opposition |

### Engagement Consistency (1-5)

This metric assesses how reliably a perspective's stated positions align with its underlying principles, and how stable those positions are when concerns are addressed. Higher scores indicate more predictable negotiating partners.

| Level | Label | Indicators |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 5 | Highly Consistent | Stated positions reflect underlying principles; positions stable when concerns addressed |
| 4 | Mostly Consistent | Principles generally align with positions; minor strategic flexibility |
| 3 | Mixed Consistency | Some positions principled, others reflect coalition pressures or unstated concerns |
| 2 | Low Consistency | Positions shift frequently; stated concerns differ from underlying priorities |
| 1 | Unpredictable | Positions appear driven primarily by opposition dynamics rather than principles |

**Coalition-Building Considerations:**

- Alignment gap: When stated concerns differ from underlying priorities, addressing stated concerns may not secure support
- Position stability: Perspectives with shifting positions require ongoing negotiation
- Principle consistency: Perspectives that apply principles uniformly are more predictable partners
- Internal diversity: Some perspectives contain factions with different priorities

### Legislation Status Reference (as of January 2026)

## Perspective Analyses

### Conservative Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | States concern for "equal justice" but often prioritizes law enforcement authority and opposes measures that would constrain police or prosecutors |
| Principle consistency | Inconsistently applies limited-government and equal-treatment principles to criminal justice; supported First Step Act but resists more comprehensive reform |
| Goalpost stability | Shifted from defending 100:1 crack/powder ratio to accepting 18:1, then to partial openness to 1:1 -- but resistance resurfaces when paired with broader racial equity measures |
| Zero-sum behavior | Tends to view racial disparity reform as inherently anti-law enforcement or soft on crime |

**Justification:** The conservative perspective has demonstrated meaningful evolution on drug sentencing -- the First Step Act was signed by President Trump and passed with strong Republican support. However, this support was limited to measures framed as "criminal justice reform" rather than "racial justice," and conservative opposition to broader reforms (data transparency mandates, prosecutorial accountability, community reinvestment) often contradicts stated principles of limited government and equal treatment.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- First Step Act (2018) passed with 87 Senate votes, including strong Republican support, demonstrating willingness to reform sentencing
- Republican Study Committee has published criminal justice reform proposals emphasizing cost savings and reentry
- Conservative opposition to the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act and mandatory data collection mandates indicates limits of reform support
- Sessions memo (2017) reversing Holder charging guidelines demonstrated the fragility of conservative support for prosecutorial restraint

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 4/10 | Acknowledges some disparities exist but attributes them primarily to differential offending and geographic enforcement patterns rather than systemic bias; resistant to framing as "systemic racism" |
| Root Cause Agreement | 3/10 | Rejects the analysis that disparities are primarily caused by biased policing, prosecutorial discretion, and structurally racist sentencing laws; attributes disparities to individual choices and community-level factors |

**Source references:**

- Heritage Foundation. "Criminal Justice Reform: The Conservative Case." 2018. -- Supports sentencing reform on fiscal grounds but rejects systemic racism framing.
- National Review editorial board. Multiple editorials supporting First Step Act while opposing "defund the police" and racial equity mandates.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Crack/powder equalization (EQUAL Act) | 6/10 | Supports equalization as a matter of fairness | Concerned about appearing soft on crack cocaine; resistance to full retroactivity |
| Mandatory racial data collection | 3/10 | Opposes federal mandates on local agencies | Fears data will be used to impose racial quotas on policing |
| Prosecutorial charging guidelines | 2/10 | Opposes constraints on prosecutorial discretion | Views this as federal overreach and threat to law enforcement effectiveness |
| Cannabis legalization with equity | 4/10 | Mixed; some support legalization but oppose equity mandates | Equity provisions seen as race-based preferences violating equal treatment |
| Community reinvestment fund | 3/10 | Opposes large federal spending programs | Skeptical of government-directed community investment; prefers market solutions |
| Pretextual stop ban | 2/10 | Strongly opposes restrictions on police authority | Views pretextual stops as essential law enforcement tool |
| Automatic expungement | 5/10 | Supports some record relief for low-level offenses | Wants narrow eligibility; opposes automatic mechanisms without judicial review |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Drug Enforcement Equity Act | 3/10 | Opposes as overreach | Federal mandates on local agencies, community reinvestment spending, prosecutorial constraints |
| EQUAL Act | 6/10 | Supports crack/powder equalization component | Concerns about full retroactivity and crime messaging |
| Model State Drug Enforcement Equity Act | 3/10 | Opposes pretextual stop restrictions and mandatory prosecutorial transparency | Preservation of law enforcement and prosecutorial authority |

#### Alternative Proposals

Conservatives would support: targeted sentencing reform for non-violent first offenders (building on First Step Act); faith-based reentry programs with federal support; earned-time credits and compassionate release expansion; private-sector reentry partnerships with tax incentives; empowering judges with more discretion rather than eliminating mandatory minimums entirely.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Libertarian (on sentencing reform, drug legalization, limiting government power), Centrist (on evidence-based, bipartisan reform)
- **Potential bridges:** Populist (on anti-elitism framing, pharmaceutical accountability), Religious Right (on redemption and second chances)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist (fundamental disagreement on systemic racism, government intervention)

---

### Liberal Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Consistently frames drug enforcement disparities as a civil rights issue requiring government remedy; positions generally align with stated values of equality and justice |
| Principle consistency | Applies equality principles consistently to drug policy; supports both sentencing reform and enforcement accountability |
| Goalpost stability | Has maintained consistent support for crack/powder equalization, data transparency, and cannabis equity over multiple decades |
| Zero-sum behavior | Occasionally frames reform in ways that alienate potential conservative allies; can prioritize symbolism over achievable compromise |

**Justification:** The liberal perspective has been the most consistent advocate for addressing racial disparities in drug enforcement, with positions that align closely with the analysis presented in this document. The principal inconsistency is occasional prioritization of comprehensive, transformative legislation over achievable incremental reforms, which can slow progress.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Congressional Democrats have introduced and supported the EQUAL Act, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, and cannabis legalization with equity provisions across multiple Congresses
- Democratic Party platform has included drug enforcement racial equity since 2008
- Obama administration's Fair Sentencing Act and Holder Smart on Crime initiative demonstrated follow-through on stated positions
- Biden administration's executive order on policing reform (2022) and marijuana scheduling review (2024) show continued engagement

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Largely agrees with the data on arrest, sentencing, and incarceration disparities; would emphasize systemic and institutional factors more strongly |
| Root Cause Agreement | 8/10 | Agrees that disparities result from biased policing, unchecked prosecutorial discretion, and structurally discriminatory sentencing laws; may underemphasize some individual-behavior factors |

**Source references:**

- Center for American Progress. "Ending the War on Drugs: By the Numbers." 2018.
- Brennan Center for Justice. Multiple reports on racial disparities in criminal justice.
- Democratic Party Platform (2020, 2024): explicit commitment to addressing racial disparities in drug enforcement.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Crack/powder equalization | 10/10 | Strongly supports 1:1 ratio with full retroactivity | None; this is a core liberal priority |
| Mandatory racial data collection | 9/10 | Strongly supports federal data transparency mandates | Minor concerns about implementation cost and privacy |
| Prosecutorial charging guidelines | 8/10 | Supports statutory constraints on prosecutorial discretion | Some concern about judicial vs. legislative role |
| Cannabis legalization with equity | 9/10 | Strongly supports with robust equity provisions | Wants stronger equity provisions than politically feasible |
| Community reinvestment fund | 9/10 | Strongly supports federal investment in harmed communities | Wants larger funding levels than proposed |
| Pretextual stop ban | 8/10 | Supports restrictions on pretextual stops | Some concern about public safety impact messaging |
| Automatic expungement | 9/10 | Strongly supports automatic record relief | Wants broadest possible eligibility |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Drug Enforcement Equity Act | 9/10 | Strongly supports comprehensive approach | Would prefer even stronger enforcement mechanisms |
| EQUAL Act | 10/10 | Strongly supports | Core priority |
| Model State Drug Enforcement Equity Act | 8/10 | Supports state-level reform | Wants federal backstop if states fail to act |

#### Alternative Proposals

Liberals would support: all proposed reforms plus reparative justice frameworks including direct payments to individuals harmed by racially disparate enforcement; stronger anti-discrimination provisions with private right of action; mandatory diversionary programs for all non-violent drug offenses; expanded public defender funding.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist (shared commitment to racial justice and government remedy)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (on evidence-based reform), Libertarian (on drug legalization and reducing government power)
- **Unlikely partners:** Religious Right (different framing of moral issues), some Conservatives (fundamental disagreement on systemic racism)

---

### Progressive Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Frames drug enforcement disparities as an extension of structural racism requiring transformative systemic change; positions directly reflect stated values |
| Principle consistency | Applies anti-racist, anti-carceral principles consistently across all dimensions of drug policy |
| Goalpost stability | Maintains consistent demand for comprehensive reform; does not lower expectations in response to political opposition |
| Zero-sum behavior | May reject compromise positions that other allies would accept; strong preference for transformative over incremental reform |

**Justification:** The progressive perspective is the most internally consistent on this issue, applying a structural racism analysis to every dimension of drug enforcement disparities. The risk is that consistency can become rigidity -- unwillingness to accept incremental gains may slow progress in practice.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Congressional Progressive Caucus has consistently supported the most comprehensive drug reform legislation, including the MORE Act and CAOA
- Progressive organizations (Drug Policy Alliance, ACLU) have maintained racial equity framing since the 1990s
- Progressive prosecutors (Krasner, Boudin, Foxx) have implemented charging reforms and data transparency
- Movement for Black Lives policy platform includes drug decriminalization and community reinvestment

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 10/10 | Fully agrees with documented disparities and regards the analysis as accurately describing systemic racial injustice |
| Root Cause Agreement | 10/10 | Agrees that disparities are rooted in structural racism, deliberate policy choices, and a political economy that benefits from mass incarceration of people of color |

**Source references:**

- Movement for Black Lives. "A Vision for Black Lives: Policy Demands for Black Power, Freedom and Justice." 2016 (updated 2020).
- Drug Policy Alliance. "Drug Policy, Criminal Justice and Race." Multiple reports.
- Congressional Progressive Caucus. Criminal justice reform agenda.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Crack/powder equalization | 9/10 | Supports as necessary but insufficient | Views this as a minimum step; wants broader decriminalization |
| Mandatory racial data collection | 9/10 | Supports transparency as a reform tool | Concerned that data alone does not produce change without enforcement mechanisms |
| Prosecutorial charging guidelines | 8/10 | Supports but wants elected progressive prosecutors as the primary strategy | Skeptical that guidelines will be enforced against resistant prosecutors |
| Cannabis legalization with equity | 10/10 | Strongly supports with maximum equity provisions | Would prefer public ownership or cooperative models over corporate cannabis |
| Community reinvestment fund | 10/10 | Strongly supports; wants larger funding | Views $10 billion as insufficient relative to the harm caused |
| Pretextual stop ban | 10/10 | Strongly supports | Views pretextual stops as a tool of racial oppression |
| Automatic expungement | 10/10 | Strongly supports broadest possible eligibility | Wants full decriminalization to prevent future records |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Drug Enforcement Equity Act | 8/10 | Supports as a significant step | Wants stronger provisions: private right of action, higher funding, broader decriminalization |
| EQUAL Act | 9/10 | Supports | Wants full elimination of all drug-based mandatory minimums, not just crack/powder equalization |
| Model State Drug Enforcement Equity Act | 8/10 | Supports | Wants broader decriminalization and deeper police reform provisions |

#### Alternative Proposals

Progressives would support: full drug decriminalization (Portugal model); abolition of mandatory minimum sentences for all drug offenses; reparations for communities harmed by the War on Drugs (beyond community reinvestment); public and cooperative cannabis enterprises; police department restructuring with community control.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Democratic Socialist, Liberal (shared commitment to racial justice and structural reform)
- **Potential bridges:** Libertarian (on drug decriminalization and reducing government power), Populist (on anti-corporate cannabis, anti-elite framing)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative, Religious Right (fundamental disagreement on systemic racism and government role)

---

### Libertarian Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Frames drug enforcement disparities as evidence of government overreach; positions align with consistent individual liberty philosophy |
| Principle consistency | Applies limited-government and personal liberty principles consistently to drug policy; opposes both drug prohibition and race-conscious remedies |
| Goalpost stability | Has maintained consistent support for drug legalization and sentencing reform for decades |
| Zero-sum behavior | May oppose race-specific remedies (community reinvestment, equity programs) even when these address documented harm, in the name of colorblindness |

**Justification:** The libertarian perspective is highly consistent in applying individual liberty principles to drug policy, making it a reliable partner on legalization and sentencing reform. However, principled opposition to race-conscious remedies limits coalition potential on equity-focused reforms.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Cato Institute has published extensive research on drug policy reform, emphasizing individual liberty and government overreach
- Libertarian Party platform calls for full drug legalization
- Koch network's Right on Crime initiative partnered with ACLU on First Step Act
- Libertarian-leaning Republican senators (Rand Paul, Mike Lee) have introduced sentencing reform bills

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 7/10 | Agrees that disparities exist and are problematic, but attributes them to drug prohibition itself rather than racial bias; framing is "government overreach" rather than "systemic racism" |
| Root Cause Agreement | 5/10 | Agrees that prohibition creates opportunities for discriminatory enforcement but attributes root causes to government power rather than racial bias per se; rejects structural racism framing |

**Source references:**

- Cato Institute. "The War on Drugs: A Failed Experiment." Multiple publications.
- Reason Foundation. Criminal justice reporting and analysis.
- Libertarian Party Platform (2024): full drug legalization.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Crack/powder equalization | 9/10 | Supports equalization; would prefer eliminating both penalties entirely | Minimum government intervention preferred |
| Mandatory racial data collection | 4/10 | Opposes federal mandates on local agencies | Government data collection as surveillance concern; unfunded mandates |
| Prosecutorial charging guidelines | 5/10 | Mixed; supports reducing prosecutorial power but opposes federal mandates | Prefers eliminating mandatory minimums entirely rather than constraining prosecutors |
| Cannabis legalization with equity | 6/10 | Supports legalization; opposes equity mandates as race-based government intervention | Equity licensing seen as government picking winners; market should determine ownership |
| Community reinvestment fund | 3/10 | Opposes large federal spending programs | Government spending is ineffective; market-based approaches preferred |
| Pretextual stop ban | 8/10 | Supports; aligns with Fourth Amendment protections | Views pretextual stops as government overreach violating individual liberty |
| Automatic expungement | 8/10 | Supports record relief for victimless offenses | Government should not maintain records of non-crimes |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Drug Enforcement Equity Act | 4/10 | Supports sentencing reform and expungement components; opposes data mandates, prosecutorial guidelines, and community reinvestment fund | Federal government overreach; race-conscious remedies; large spending |
| EQUAL Act | 9/10 | Supports | Would prefer broader elimination of drug penalties |
| Model State Drug Enforcement Equity Act | 5/10 | Supports pretextual stop restrictions and expungement; opposes data mandates and prosecutorial transparency requirements | State-level government overreach |

#### Alternative Proposals

Libertarians would support: full drug legalization (eliminating the criminal penalties that create disparities); elimination of civil asset forfeiture; elimination of all mandatory minimum sentences; market-based cannabis without licensing preferences; tax relief for businesses hiring formerly incarcerated individuals.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive (on drug legalization), Conservative (on limited government, sentencing reform)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (on evidence-based reform), Liberal (on drug legalization and civil liberties)
- **Unlikely partners:** Populist (disagree on government spending and regulation), Religious Right (disagree on drug legalization)

---

### Constitutionalist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Claims constitutional fidelity as the guiding principle, but selectively applies originalist analysis -- expansive on federalism, narrow on Equal Protection |
| Principle consistency | Inconsistently applies states' rights and limited federal power principles; supports federal drug prohibition while opposing federal reform mandates |
| Goalpost stability | Positions shift depending on which level of government is acting and in which direction |
| Zero-sum behavior | Uses constitutional arguments strategically to oppose reforms rather than applying them consistently |

**Justification:** Constitutionalists' mixed consistency score reflects the tension between principled federalism (which would question both federal drug prohibition and federal reform mandates) and the strategic deployment of constitutional arguments primarily to block reform. A truly consistent originalist position would question the constitutional basis for the Controlled Substances Act itself.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Some originalist scholars (e.g., Randy Barnett) have questioned the constitutional basis for federal drug prohibition under the Commerce Clause
- However, most self-identified constitutionalists supported the War on Drugs while now opposing federal reform mandates
- Selective invocation of the Tenth Amendment to oppose data transparency mandates while accepting federal drug prohibition reveals inconsistency

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 4/10 | Acknowledges some disparities but frames them as incidental rather than systemic; focuses on federal overreach rather than racial bias |
| Root Cause Agreement | 3/10 | Attributes disparities to federal policy overreach rather than racial bias; argues the solution is returning drug policy to states, not federal equity mandates |

**Source references:**

- Federalist Society. Drug policy and criminal justice reform publications.
- Heritage Foundation. Constitutional analysis of federal criminal justice reform proposals.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Crack/powder equalization | 6/10 | Supports within federal sentencing reform | Accepts as Congress's authority to set sentencing ratios |
| Mandatory racial data collection | 2/10 | Opposes as exceeding federal authority over state/local agencies | Tenth Amendment; unfunded mandates |
| Prosecutorial charging guidelines | 3/10 | Opposes as executive encroachment on prosecutorial independence | Separation of powers; prosecutorial discretion |
| Cannabis legalization with equity | 4/10 | Supports returning cannabis to states; opposes federal equity mandates | Federal equity programs exceed enumerated powers |
| Community reinvestment fund | 2/10 | Opposes as federal spending outside enumerated powers | General Welfare Clause does not authorize targeted community spending |
| Pretextual stop ban | 4/10 | Mixed; Fourth Amendment concerns support some restrictions | Prefers judicial remedy over legislative mandate |
| Automatic expungement | 5/10 | Supports for federal convictions; opposes federal mandate on state records | Federalism; state records are state business |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Drug Enforcement Equity Act | 2/10 | Opposes most provisions as federal overreach | Spending Clause conditions on local agencies, prosecutorial mandates, community reinvestment fund |
| EQUAL Act | 6/10 | Supports equalization as within Congressional authority | Narrow support for sentencing reform; opposes broader package |
| Model State Drug Enforcement Equity Act | 5/10 | More supportive of state-level action than federal mandates | Accepts state authority to reform own enforcement and sentencing |

#### Alternative Proposals

Constitutionalists would support: federal drug policy devolution to states (allowing states to set their own drug policies without federal interference); elimination of federal marijuana prohibition as exceeding Commerce Clause authority; judicial remedies through Fourth Amendment litigation rather than legislative mandates; state-level sentencing reform.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Libertarian (on limited government, some drug reforms), Conservative (on federalism)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (on evidence-based reform at state level)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive, Democratic Socialist, Liberal (fundamental disagreement on federal authority to address racial disparities)

---

### Populist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 2/5 - Low Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | States concern for "ordinary Americans" and anti-elite sentiment, but positions on drug enforcement disparities shift based on which racial group is perceived as affected |
| Principle consistency | Inconsistently applies anti-elite and pro-worker principles to drug policy; supports pharmaceutical accountability but opposes enforcement equity reform |
| Goalpost stability | Positions shift significantly depending on whether reform is framed as helping "hardworking Americans" or as "racial justice" |
| Zero-sum behavior | Tends to view racial equity reforms as benefiting one group at the expense of another |

**Justification:** The populist perspective's low consistency score reflects the fundamental tension between its anti-elite, pro-worker rhetoric (which should support drug sentencing reform and pharmaceutical accountability) and its resistance to reforms explicitly framed around racial equity. The same populist who supports reducing sentences for opioid-affected white rural communities may oppose reducing sentences for crack-affected Black urban communities.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Populist support for the First Step Act demonstrated willingness to reform sentencing when framed as helping all Americans
- Populist support for pharmaceutical accountability (Purdue Pharma, Sackler family) demonstrates anti-elite commitment
- However, populist opposition to racial equity framing and community reinvestment reveals that "anti-elite" sentiment does not automatically extend to racial justice
- Trump-era populism simultaneously embraced First Step Act and "law and order" rhetoric targeting urban minority communities

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 4/10 | May acknowledge disparities exist but attributes them to crime patterns and urban disorder rather than systemic bias; more sympathetic when disparities affect white rural communities (opioid crisis) |
| Root Cause Agreement | 3/10 | Rejects structural racism analysis; attributes drug problems to moral decay, family breakdown, and cultural factors; blames "elites" (pharmaceutical companies, politicians) but not the enforcement system itself |

**Source references:**

- America First Policy Institute. Criminal justice and public safety publications.
- Tucker Carlson / populist media. Drug enforcement coverage emphasizing crime and border security.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Crack/powder equalization | 5/10 | Mixed; may support fairness framing but resistant to racial equity framing | Concerned about appearing soft on urban drug crime |
| Mandatory racial data collection | 2/10 | Opposes as government bureaucracy and political correctness | Sees data collection as tool for imposing racial quotas |
| Prosecutorial charging guidelines | 2/10 | Opposes constraints on "tough" prosecutors | Wants prosecutors to be tougher, not more constrained |
| Cannabis legalization with equity | 3/10 | Mixed on legalization; opposes equity mandates | Equity provisions seen as unfair racial preferences |
| Community reinvestment fund | 3/10 | May support investment in rural communities but opposes urban-focused programs | Views urban community investment as elite-directed spending |
| Pretextual stop ban | 2/10 | Opposes; supports strong policing | Wants more law enforcement, not less |
| Automatic expungement | 4/10 | Mixed; supports second chances but skeptical of broad automatic relief | Wants case-by-case review, not blanket forgiveness |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Drug Enforcement Equity Act | 2/10 | Opposes as "woke" criminal justice reform | Racial equity framing; federal spending; constraints on police and prosecutors |
| EQUAL Act | 5/10 | Mixed; fairness argument resonates but "soft on crime" concerns dominate | Political messaging risk |
| Model State Drug Enforcement Equity Act | 3/10 | Opposes most provisions | Restrictions on police authority; mandatory data collection; equity framing |

#### Alternative Proposals

Populists would support: harsh penalties for drug traffickers and cartels; mandatory sentences for fentanyl trafficking; expanded drug courts with treatment requirements; pharmaceutical company accountability; border security as drug enforcement strategy; support for recovery programs in affected communities (when framed without racial equity language).

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (on law and order, some sentencing reform), Religious Right (on moral framing of drug use)
- **Potential bridges:** Liberal (on pharmaceutical accountability), Progressive (on anti-corporate framing)
- **Unlikely partners:** Libertarian (disagree on drug legalization and government authority), Democratic Socialist (fundamental disagreement on racial justice framing)

---

### Centrist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine commitment to evidence-based, bipartisan reform; positions align with pragmatic problem-solving principles |
| Principle consistency | Consistently applies cost-benefit and evidence frameworks to drug policy; willing to accept reforms supported by data regardless of ideological origin |
| Goalpost stability | Maintains consistent support for achievable reforms; does not move goalposts based on political dynamics |
| Zero-sum behavior | Actively seeks compromise; may frustrate allies on both sides by accepting less than ideal outcomes in exchange for bipartisan support |

**Justification:** The centrist perspective is a reliable reform partner because it bases positions on evidence rather than ideology. Its principal limitation is a tendency toward incrementalism that may be insufficient to address the scale of documented disparities.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Bipartisan Policy Center has published criminal justice reform proposals with cross-party support
- Senators Durbin (D) and Grassley (R) partnership on sentencing reform demonstrates centrist coalition-building
- First Step Act represents the centrist approach in action: bipartisan, evidence-based, incremental
- Centrist think tanks (Brookings, Urban Institute) produce research used by both parties

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 7/10 | Agrees that disparities are well-documented and problematic; prefers evidence-based framing over "systemic racism" rhetoric; emphasizes data over ideology |
| Root Cause Agreement | 6/10 | Agrees that multiple factors contribute to disparities including enforcement practices, sentencing structures, and prosecutorial discretion; also acknowledges some role for community-level factors; seeks comprehensive rather than monocausal explanation |

**Source references:**

- Bipartisan Policy Center. "Criminal Justice Reform: A Bipartisan Approach." Multiple publications.
- Brookings Institution. Criminal justice and racial equity research.
- Urban Institute. Drug policy and incarceration analysis.

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Crack/powder equalization | 9/10 | Strongly supports; views as the most achievable and well-justified reform | Bipartisan precedent makes this viable |
| Mandatory racial data collection | 7/10 | Supports with reasonable compliance timelines and technical assistance | Wants to ensure data is used constructively, not punitively |
| Prosecutorial charging guidelines | 6/10 | Supports guidance but prefers incentives over mandates | Concerned about judicial vs. legislative boundary |
| Cannabis legalization with equity | 7/10 | Supports legalization with reasonable equity provisions | Wants market-functional design; concerned about overregulation |
| Community reinvestment fund | 6/10 | Supports targeted investment with measurable outcomes | Wants rigorous evaluation and accountability for spending |
| Pretextual stop ban | 5/10 | Cautiously supportive with evidence of effectiveness | Wants pilot programs and evaluation before nationwide adoption |
| Automatic expungement | 7/10 | Supports for clearly defined categories of offenses | Wants clear eligibility criteria and reasonable exclusions |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Drug Enforcement Equity Act | 6/10 | Supports most components; would prefer a more modular approach | Comprehensive package may be harder to pass than components |
| EQUAL Act | 9/10 | Strongly supports | Most bipartisan-viable reform |
| Model State Drug Enforcement Equity Act | 7/10 | Supports state-level action with reasonable provisions | Wants flexibility for states to adapt |

#### Alternative Proposals

Centrists would support: phased implementation of reforms starting with the most bipartisan (EQUAL Act, First Step Act expansion); evidence-based pilot programs before nationwide mandates; bipartisan task forces to develop consensus reforms; performance-based grants that reward disparity reduction; expanded drug courts and diversion programs.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberal (on evidence-based reform), Conservative (on bipartisan, fiscal reform)
- **Potential bridges:** Libertarian (on sentencing reform), Progressive (on data transparency)
- **Unlikely partners:** Populist (resistant to evidence-based framing when it conflicts with "tough on crime" messaging)

### Religious Right Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | States concern for moral order and human dignity; but applies redemption values inconsistently across racial groups and drug types |
| Principle consistency | Supports redemption and second chances in principle, but implementation is selective; more sympathetic to opioid-affected white communities than crack-affected Black communities |
| Goalpost stability | Has evolved on drug policy -- from strong "tough on crime" in 1990s to more nuanced position today -- but evolution has been uneven |
| Zero-sum behavior | May view racial equity reforms as threatening traditional moral order or promoting secular values |

**Justification:** The Religious Right has demonstrated meaningful evolution on criminal justice, with organizations like Prison Fellowship (founded by Chuck Colson) and the National Association of Evangelicals supporting sentencing reform and reentry programs. However, this support has been more readily extended to opioid-affected white communities than to crack-affected Black communities, and opposition to "racial justice" framing limits coalition potential on equity-focused reforms.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Prison Fellowship and the National Association of Evangelicals supported the First Step Act
- Southern Baptist Convention has passed resolutions calling for criminal justice reform
- However, evangelical voters disproportionately support "law and order" candidates and policies
- Religious Right organizations have not prioritized racial disparities in drug enforcement as a moral issue

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 4/10 | Acknowledges drug addiction as a moral and health crisis but does not prioritize racial disparities; frames the issue as personal sin and family breakdown rather than systemic bias |
| Root Cause Agreement | 3/10 | Attributes drug problems to moral decay, family instability, and departure from faith; does not accept structural racism as a primary cause; may agree that government has been unjust but focuses on individual moral reform |

### Democratic Socialist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Frames drug enforcement disparities as a product of capitalism, racism, and the carceral state; positions directly reflect stated anti-capitalist and anti-racist values |
| Principle consistency | Applies class analysis and anti-racist analysis consistently across all dimensions of drug policy; supports the most comprehensive reform proposals |
| Goalpost stability | Maintains consistent demand for transformative, structural change; does not compromise on analysis even when accepting incremental victories |
| Zero-sum behavior | Views the status quo as zero-sum (communities of color losing, private prison companies winning) and demands fundamental redistribution |

**Justification:** The democratic socialist perspective is highly consistent in applying a class-and-race analysis to drug enforcement disparities, making it a predictable (if ambitious) negotiating partner. Its principal limitation is that its transformative demands may exceed what is achievable in the current political environment, potentially leading to the rejection of achievable reforms.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) platform includes drug decriminalization, abolition of private prisons, and community reinvestment
- Sen. Bernie Sanders introduced comprehensive drug policy reform including cannabis legalization and expungement
- DSA-aligned elected officials (e.g., Jamaal Bowman, Rashida Tlaib) have supported the most comprehensive reform proposals
- Consistent framing across issues: racial disparities in drug enforcement are connected to broader systems of economic exploitation and racial control

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 10/10 | Fully agrees with documented disparities and views them as evidence of structural racism embedded in capitalism and the carceral state |
| Root Cause Agreement | 10/10 | Agrees with structural analysis and extends it to include capitalist incentives (private prisons, pharmaceutical profits) as fundamental drivers of racially disparate drug enforcement |

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Crack/powder equalization | 8/10 | Supports as a minimum step; wants elimination of all mandatory minimums | Incremental reform insufficient |
| Mandatory racial data collection | 8/10 | Supports transparency as reform tool | Concerned that data without power redistribution is insufficient |
| Prosecutorial charging guidelines | 7/10 | Supports constraining prosecutorial power | Prefers elected progressive prosecutors and community control over prosecution |
| Cannabis legalization with equity | 10/10 | Supports with public ownership and worker cooperative models | Wants public/cooperative cannabis rather than corporate cannabis |
| Community reinvestment fund | 10/10 | Strongly supports; wants much larger fund and community control | $10 billion insufficient; wants community-controlled budgeting |
| Pretextual stop ban | 10/10 | Strongly supports | Views pretextual stops as tool of capitalist state control |
| Automatic expungement | 10/10 | Strongly supports; wants full decriminalization | Records are tools of social control; all drug records should be expunged |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Drug Enforcement Equity Act | 7/10 | Supports as meaningful but insufficient | Wants larger reinvestment fund, full decriminalization, private right of action, abolition of private prisons |
| EQUAL Act | 8/10 | Supports | Wants broader mandatory minimum elimination |
| Model State Drug Enforcement Equity Act | 7/10 | Supports but wants stronger provisions | Wants community control of policing, participatory budgeting for reinvestment |

#### Alternative Proposals

Democratic socialists would support: full drug decriminalization; abolition of private prisons; public ownership of cannabis industry (state-run dispensaries with worker cooperatives); reparations for communities harmed by the War on Drugs (beyond reinvestment); community control of policing through elected civilian boards with binding authority; universal public health insurance covering addiction treatment.

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive (shared structural analysis and reform ambition), Liberal (shared racial justice commitment)
- **Potential bridges:** Libertarian (on drug legalization and reducing state power), Populist (on anti-corporate sentiment)
- **Unlikely partners:** Conservative, Religious Right, Constitutionalist (fundamental disagreement on role of government, capitalism, and racial analysis)

### Common Ground Synthesis

This matrix identifies which reforms have potential cross-ideological support and which face structural opposition.

| Reform Category | Broad Support (5+) | Narrow Support (3-4) | Structural Opposition |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Crack/powder equalization | Conservative, Liberal, Progressive, Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Populist, Centrist, Religious Right, Democratic Socialist | -- | -- |
| Automatic expungement | Liberal, Progressive, Libertarian, Centrist, Religious Right, Democratic Socialist | Conservative, Constitutionalist, Populist | -- |
| Mandatory data collection | Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Democratic Socialist | Libertarian | Conservative, Constitutionalist, Populist, Religious Right |
| Community reinvestment | Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Religious Right, Democratic Socialist | -- | Conservative, Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Populist |
| Pretextual stop ban | Liberal, Progressive, Libertarian, Centrist, Democratic Socialist | Constitutionalist | Conservative, Populist, Religious Right |
| Cannabis legalization + equity | Liberal, Progressive, Libertarian, Centrist, Democratic Socialist | Conservative, Constitutionalist | Populist, Religious Right |
| Prosecutorial guidelines | Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Democratic Socialist | Libertarian | Conservative, Constitutionalist, Populist, Religious Right |

**Key insight:** Crack/powder equalization has near-universal support across all 9 perspectives and should be the first legislative priority. Automatic expungement has the second-broadest coalition. Data collection and prosecutorial reform face the steepest opposition from right-of-center perspectives.

## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: The Fair Sentencing Completion Act

**Bridges:** Conservative + Liberal + Centrist + Libertarian + Religious Right + Progressive

**Core Agreement:** All perspectives agree that the crack/powder cocaine sentencing disparity is unjust and should be equalized at 1:1. This is the single reform with the broadest cross-ideological support.

**Policy Description:**

Equalize the crack/powder cocaine sentencing ratio at 1:1 (EQUAL Act), make the change fully retroactive, and combine it with expanded earned-time credits and faith-based reentry programs. This builds directly on the First Step Act model -- bipartisan, evidence-based, with components appealing to multiple perspectives.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | Builds on First Step Act precedent; includes faith-based reentry; framed as fairness, not racial equity |
| Liberal | Eliminates the most documented racial sentencing disparity; full retroactivity |
| Libertarian | Reduces government punishment; applies equal treatment |
| Centrist | Evidence-based; bipartisan precedent; achievable |
| Religious Right | Redemption and second chances; faith-based programs included |
| Progressive | Addresses a fundamental injustice; retroactivity helps those already harmed |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Accepts retroactivity despite "finality" concerns |
| Progressive | Accepts 1:1 ratio reform without broader decriminalization or community reinvestment |
| Libertarian | Accepts continued criminalization of cocaine rather than full legalization |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 8/9 perspectives (only Populist at 5/10 -- tepid but not opposed)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 5/8 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** High -- once sentencing ratio is equalized, reversal is politically untenable
- **Implementation Path:** Reintroduce EQUAL Act; attach to must-pass legislation; build on 361-66 House precedent

---

### Compromise 2: Second Chance and Record Relief Act

**Bridges:** Conservative + Liberal + Libertarian + Centrist + Religious Right + Progressive + Democratic Socialist

**Core Agreement:** Multiple perspectives support allowing people with low-level, non-violent drug convictions to clear their records and rebuild their lives. Conservatives frame this as "second chances," liberals as "justice," libertarians as "reducing government power," and the Religious Right as "redemption."

**Policy Description:**

Establish a federal automatic expungement system for simple drug possession convictions after a waiting period (3 years from sentence completion with no subsequent felony). Eliminate federal collateral consequences for drug convictions (public housing, SNAP/TANF, student aid). Fund legal aid organizations to assist with state-level expungement.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | "Second chance" framing; waiting period; exclusion of violent and trafficking offenses |
| Liberal | Broad eligibility; removal of collateral consequences |
| Libertarian | Reduces government's ability to punish victimless behavior |
| Centrist | Evidence-based (Agan & Starr research on employment effects); measurable outcomes |
| Religious Right | Redemption narrative; evidence of personal transformation through waiting period |
| Progressive | Addresses collateral consequences that perpetuate disadvantage |
| Democratic Socialist | Removes tools of social control; restores rights |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Accepts automatic (rather than petition-based) expungement for some categories |
| Progressive | Accepts waiting period and exclusion of some offense categories |
| Democratic Socialist | Accepts incremental record relief rather than full decriminalization |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 7/9 perspectives (Populist and Constitutionalist at lower support but not firmly opposed)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 5/7 coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** High -- once records are expunged, the change is permanent
- **Implementation Path:** Build on Clean Slate Act momentum; bipartisan co-sponsors; attach to appropriations

---

### Compromise 3: Evidence-Based Enforcement Transparency Pilot

**Bridges:** Liberal + Centrist + Libertarian + Progressive

**Core Agreement:** Data transparency is a prerequisite for identifying and addressing disparities. A voluntary pilot program with federal incentives (rather than mandates) could build evidence and political support for broader adoption.

**Policy Description:**

Create a voluntary federal pilot program offering bonus law enforcement funding (10% increase in Byrne JAG grants) to agencies that adopt comprehensive drug enforcement data collection and public reporting by race. Fund technical assistance for participating agencies. Require an independent evaluation after 3 years to assess impact on disparities and inform future legislation.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Liberal | Establishes the data infrastructure essential for reform |
| Centrist | Voluntary and evidence-based; pilot before mandate |
| Libertarian | Voluntary rather than mandated; transparency reduces government opacity |
| Conservative | Voluntary, not mandated; bonus funding is incentive, not coercion |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Liberal | Accepts voluntary pilot rather than mandatory nationwide reporting |
| Progressive | Accepts incremental transparency rather than immediate enforceable mandates |
| Centrist | Accepts that pilot results may support mandatory requirements later |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 4/9 perspectives actively supportive; 2-3 additional could be persuaded
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 4/4 active coalition members rated 4+ consistency
- **Durability:** Moderate -- pilot program creates evidence base for mandatory legislation; results could galvanize broader support or be ignored by hostile administrations
- **Implementation Path:** Introduce as standalone bill or include in DOJ appropriations; emphasize voluntary and evidence-based design to reduce opposition

## Strategic Implications

### Most Viable Coalition

The most viable near-term coalition combines **Conservative, Liberal, Centrist, and Libertarian** perspectives around crack/powder equalization and record relief -- reforms that align with fairness, fiscal responsibility, individual liberty, and evidence-based policy. This coalition mirrors the First Step Act model and has demonstrated viability. Adding **Religious Right** support through redemption-focused framing strengthens the coalition to 5 of 9 perspectives.

### Key Obstacles

The primary obstacle is the gap between reforms that have broad bipartisan support (sentencing equalization, record relief) and reforms that address the structural causes of disparity (data mandates, prosecutorial accountability, community reinvestment, enforcement reform). The former can be achieved with existing coalitions; the latter require either expanded coalitions or sufficient Democratic majorities to overcome filibuster opposition.

### Low Consistency Partners

The **Populist** perspective (2/5 consistency) is the least reliable partner. Its positions shift based on framing, making it possible to secure support for specific reforms (e.g., pharmaceutical accountability, sentencing fairness) when framed without racial equity language, but this support is fragile and may reverse in response to "tough on crime" counter-messaging. Coalition strategy should not depend on populist support but should seek it opportunistically.

### Recommended Approach

1. **Immediate priority**: Pass the EQUAL Act (crack/powder equalization) by assembling the broadest possible coalition (8-9 perspectives) around fairness framing. This is the single reform most likely to succeed and would demonstrate bipartisan commitment to addressing disparities.

2. **Near-term**: Advance record relief and collateral consequence reform through the "Second Chance" coalition (7 perspectives), building on First Step Act momentum and using redemption, fairness, and fiscal responsibility framing.

3. **Medium-term**: Use the voluntary data transparency pilot to build evidence for mandatory reporting. As data from pilot jurisdictions demonstrates the effectiveness of transparency in reducing disparities, expand political support for broader mandates.

4. **Long-term**: Build toward comprehensive reform (community reinvestment, enforcement accountability, cannabis equity) through incremental coalition expansion, evidence accumulation, and electoral change.
