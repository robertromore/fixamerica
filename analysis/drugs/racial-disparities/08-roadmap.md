# Racial Disparities in Drug Policy: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

Eliminating racial disparities in drug enforcement requires a sequenced strategy that builds political momentum through early, achievable wins; establishes the data infrastructure necessary to track progress; enacts structural reforms that constrain discretionary decisions at each stage of the system; and invests in affected communities to break the self-reinforcing cycle of enforcement concentration and disadvantage. Each phase builds on the prior: Phase 1 establishes transparency and achieves bipartisan sentencing reforms; Phase 2 enacts structural changes to enforcement, prosecution, and cannabis policy; Phase 3 institutionalizes accountability and community investment for long-term transformation.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation and Quick Wins (Years 1-2)

### Objectives

- Equalize crack/powder cocaine sentencing and secure retroactive resentencing
- Establish federal data collection requirements for drug enforcement by race
- Restore and codify prosecutorial charging guidelines limiting mandatory minimums for low-level offenses
- Eliminate remaining federal collateral consequences for drug convictions

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Pass EQUAL Act (crack/powder 1:1) | Congress | Months 1-12 | Legislative time; USSC rulemaking | Enactment; 1:1 ratio in effect |
| Executive order: mandatory drug enforcement data collection by race for all federal agencies | President / DOJ | Months 1-6 | Executive authority; DOJ guidance | Order issued; federal agencies reporting within 12 months |
| Codify Smart on Crime charging guidelines (statutory) | Congress / DOJ | Months 6-18 | Legislation; U.S. Attorney training | Statutory charging guidelines in effect; not reversible by future AG |
| Eliminate drug felony SNAP/TANF ban | Congress | Months 6-18 | Legislation | Federal ban repealed; states given incentives to follow |
| Eliminate public housing one-strike policy for drug offenses | HUD | Months 6-12 | HUD rulemaking | One-strike policy revised or eliminated |
| Remove drug conviction barrier to federal student aid | Congress / Dept. of Education | Months 6-18 | Legislation (FAFSA Simplification expansion) | Barrier removed |
| Establish DOJ Office of Enforcement Equity | DOJ | Months 6-12 | $15 million startup funding; 30 FTEs | Office operational; first disparity report within 18 months |

### Legislative Requirements

- EQUAL Act (equalize crack/powder sentencing at 1:1, retroactive)
- Drug Conviction Collateral Consequences Relief Act (repeal SNAP/TANF ban, student aid restriction)
- Smart on Crime Codification Act (statutory charging guidelines for federal drug cases)

### Expected Outcomes

Phase 1 achieves the most immediately impactful and bipartisan reforms: the crack/powder disparity is eliminated (reducing the single largest source of racially disparate federal drug sentencing), data infrastructure is established for tracking future progress, and collateral consequences that perpetuate disadvantage for millions of people with drug convictions are removed. Approximately 2,000-3,000 federal inmates receive reduced sentences under EQUAL Act retroactivity, saving $90-135 million annually in incarceration costs.

---

## Phase 2: Structural Reform (Years 3-5)

### Objectives

- Enact federal cannabis legalization with equity provisions and automatic expungement
- Pass Drug Enforcement Data Transparency Act conditioning federal funding on state/local racial data reporting
- Establish community reinvestment fund for disproportionately impacted areas
- Reform prosecutorial discretion through statutory accountability mechanisms

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Enact federal cannabis legalization with equity provisions | Congress | Years 3-4 | Legislation; agency rulemaking | Cannabis descheduled; equity licensing established |
| Automatic federal expungement of cannabis convictions | DOJ / Courts | Years 3-5 | $200 million processing budget; automated record systems | Millions of records cleared; processing complete by year 5 |
| Drug Enforcement Data Transparency Act | Congress | Year 3 | Legislation; $150 million for state/local technical assistance | Federal funding conditioned on data reporting by race |
| Drug War Community Reinvestment Fund ($1 billion/year) | Congress / HUD / DOJ | Years 3-5 | $1 billion annual appropriation | First grants awarded by year 4; measurable community outcomes by year 6 |
| Prosecutorial Integrity Act | Congress | Years 3-4 | Legislation; $50 million oversight infrastructure | Mandatory charging guidelines; racial impact analysis required |
| Expand LEAD diversion programs nationally | DOJ / SAMHSA | Years 3-5 | $200 million in federal grants | LEAD operational in 200+ jurisdictions |
| Federal pretextual stop study and recommendations | DOJ / NAS | Years 3-4 | $5 million for study | Evidence base for Phase 3 legislative action |

### Legislative Requirements

- Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act (or equivalent federal legalization)
- Drug Enforcement Data Transparency Act
- Drug War Community Reinvestment Act ($10 billion over 10 years)
- Prosecutorial Integrity Act

### Expected Outcomes

Phase 2 achieves the structural reforms that address the root causes of disparity: cannabis legalization eliminates the single largest category of racially disparate drug arrests; data transparency makes enforcement disparities visible at all levels of government; the community reinvestment fund begins directing resources to areas most harmed by the War on Drugs; and prosecutorial accountability mechanisms constrain the discretionary decisions that amplify arrest disparities into sentencing disparities. Millions of Americans have cannabis records expunged, removing barriers to employment, housing, and civic participation.

## Phase 3: Institutional Transformation (Years 6-10)

### Objectives

- Ban pretextual traffic stops for drug enforcement through federal funding conditions
- Achieve measurable closure of racial disparity gaps at every system stage
- Institutionalize ongoing accountability and community investment
- Establish enforcement equity as a permanent feature of U.S. drug policy

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Federal ban on pretextual stops for drug enforcement (funding condition) | Congress | Year 6-7 | Legislation | States adopt pretextual stop restrictions |
| Full implementation of automatic expungement across states | State legislatures / DOJ | Years 6-8 | Federal matching grants ($500 million) | 90%+ of eligible records cleared in all 50 states |
| Racial disparity reduction targets for federal funding | DOJ | Years 6-10 | Annual reporting and compliance review | Agencies with persistent unjustified disparities lose funding |
| Community reinvestment fund full operational capacity | HUD / DOJ | Years 6-10 | $1 billion/year ongoing | Measurable improvements in employment, health, education in target areas |
| Reauthorize and strengthen Drug Enforcement Data Transparency Act | Congress | Year 8-10 | Legislation | Enhanced standards, increased penalties for non-compliance |
| Comprehensive evaluation of disparity reduction efforts | GAO / NAS | Year 9-10 | $10 million for evaluation | Evidence-based assessment; recommendations for next decade |

### Expected Outcomes

Phase 3 institutionalizes the reforms of Phases 1 and 2, embedding enforcement equity into the permanent infrastructure of U.S. drug policy. Pretextual stop bans reduce the pipeline of racially disparate drug encounters at the earliest stage. Full state-level expungement removes barriers for millions. Community reinvestment produces measurable improvement in targeted neighborhoods. The comprehensive evaluation provides the evidence base for the next decade of reform.

## Success Metrics and Milestones

| Milestone | Target Date | Metric | Baseline (Current) | Year 3 Target | Year 5 Target | Year 10 Target |
|-----------|-------------|--------|-------------------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| Black-to-white marijuana arrest ratio | Ongoing | ACLU/FBI ratio | 3.73:1 (2018) | 2.5:1 | 1.5:1 | <1.2:1 |
| Black-to-white drug incarceration ratio | Ongoing | Sentencing Project | 5.8:1 (2020) | 4.5:1 | 3.0:1 | <2.0:1 |
| Crack/powder sentencing ratio | Year 1 | Federal statute | 18:1 | 1:1 | 1:1 | 1:1 |
| Federal agencies reporting drug enforcement data by race | Year 2 | DOJ compliance report | ~30% | 100% federal | 75% state/local | 95% state/local |
| Cannabis records expunged (federal) | Year 5 | DOJ processing data | 0 (federal automatic) | 500,000 | 2 million | 5 million+ |
| Community reinvestment funds deployed | Year 10 | HUD/DOJ grants data | $0 | $1 billion | $5 billion | $10 billion |

| LEAD diversion programs operational | Year 5 | DOJ program count | ~60 jurisdictions | 100 | 200 | 500+ |

## Governance and Oversight

- **DOJ Office of Enforcement Equity**: New office within the Department of Justice responsible for collecting, analyzing, and publishing drug enforcement data by race; reviewing compliance with data reporting requirements; and recommending corrective action for agencies with persistent unjustified disparities.
- **Congressional Oversight**: Annual reporting to the Senate Judiciary Committee and House Judiciary Committee on progress toward disparity reduction targets. GAO required to conduct biennial audits.
- **Independent Evaluation**: National Academies of Sciences commissioned to conduct a comprehensive 10-year evaluation of disparity reduction efforts, with interim reports at years 3, 5, and 7.
- **Community Advisory Boards**: Each community reinvestment grant requires establishment of a local advisory board with majority representation from affected community members to ensure that investment decisions reflect community priorities.

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Political Reversal by Future Administration

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Embed core reforms in statute rather than executive orders. The Smart on Crime Codification Act ensures that charging guidelines survive administration changes. The Drug Enforcement Data Transparency Act creates statutory (not discretionary) reporting requirements. Community reinvestment is authorized through multi-year appropriations.

**Contingency Plan**: If statutory reform is partially reversed, state-level reforms continue. DOJ Office of Enforcement Equity is structurally embedded within the department and protected by civil service rules.

### Risk 2: Cannabis Legalization Without Equity

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Build equity provisions into the core legalization statute as non-severable requirements. Require equity impact assessments before licensing proceeds. Fund equity applicants directly through federal programs rather than relying solely on state implementation.

**Contingency Plan**: If federal legalization passes without robust equity provisions, pursue state-level equity programs and federal supplemental equity legislation.

### Risk 3: Data Collection Resistance from Local Agencies

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Phase in requirements gradually, provide substantial technical assistance funding ($150 million), and tie compliance to popular federal funding streams (Byrne JAG, COPS) to create strong incentives. Engage progressive police chiefs and the Police Executive Research Forum as reform partners.

**Contingency Plan**: If compliance remains low, increase funding withholding percentages and publish non-compliance lists to generate political pressure.

### Risk 4: Cannabis Social Equity Programs Fail to Achieve Ownership Targets

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Provide direct federal capital through low-interest SBA loans (not just licensing preferences); technical assistance programs for equity applicants; caps on the number of licenses held by any single entity to prevent corporate consolidation.

**Contingency Plan**: If ownership targets are not met, strengthen anti-consolidation rules, increase direct capital programs, and consider publicly operated cannabis retail options (modeled on state liquor stores) with equity hiring mandates.

## Resource Requirements

### Funding

| Phase | Estimated Cost | Funding Source | Notes |
