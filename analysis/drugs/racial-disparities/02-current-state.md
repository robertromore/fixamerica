# Racial Disparities in Drug Policy: Current State

## Arrest Disparities

Racial disparities in drug arrests remain substantial despite declining overall arrest numbers. The legalization of cannabis in 24 states and the District of Columbia has reduced total marijuana arrests nationally, but the racial gap in arrest rates has proven resistant to change.

### Marijuana Arrest Disparities

The ACLU's 2020 report, "A Tale of Two Countries," found that despite roughly equal rates of marijuana use, Black people were 3.73 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white people -- a ratio that was virtually unchanged from the 3.73:1 disparity documented in the ACLU's original 2013 report, even as overall marijuana arrests declined.

| Metric | Value | Year | Source |
|--------|-------|------|--------|
| Black-to-white marijuana arrest ratio (national) | 3.73:1 | 2018 | ACLU, 2020 |
| Black-to-white marijuana arrest ratio (2001) | 3.73:1 | 2001 | ACLU, 2013 |
| States where ratio exceeds 5:1 | Montana, Kentucky, Illinois, West Virginia, Iowa | 2018 | ACLU, 2020 |
| Highest state ratio | Montana (9.6:1) | 2018 | ACLU, 2020 |
| Total marijuana arrests (2022) | ~170,856 | 2022 | FBI NIBRS, 2023 |
| Marijuana possession share of drug arrests | ~28% | 2022 | FBI NIBRS, 2023 |

### Overall Drug Arrest Disparities

| Metric | Value | Trend | Source |
|--------|-------|-------|--------|
| Total drug abuse violation arrests (2022) | ~1.24 million | Declining from 1.56M in 2018 | FBI NIBRS, 2023 |
| Black share of drug arrests (2020) | 26.6% | Stable | FBI UCR, 2021 |
| Black share of U.S. population | 13.6% | Stable | Census Bureau, 2020 |
| Hispanic share of drug arrests | 18.2% (of known ethnicity) | Stable | FBI UCR, 2021 |
| White share of drug arrests (2020) | 69.4% | Stable | FBI UCR, 2021 |
| Black-to-white drug arrest rate ratio (all drugs) | ~2.5:1 | Slightly declining | Sentencing Project, 2023 |

### Stop-and-Frisk and Search Disparities

Policing tactics that precede drug arrests show pronounced racial disparities. Data from jurisdictions that track stop data reveal consistent patterns.

| Jurisdiction | Finding | Year | Source |
|--------------|---------|------|--------|
| New York City (pre-reform) | 87% of stops targeted Black and Hispanic individuals (who were 52% of population) | 2011 | NYCLU, 2012 |
| Ferguson, Missouri | Black residents were 2.07 times more likely to be searched during traffic stops, despite a lower contraband hit rate (26% vs. 30% for white drivers) | 2013 | DOJ Ferguson Report, 2015 |
| Connecticut (statewide) | Black and Hispanic drivers searched at 2x and 1.5x the rate of white drivers | 2020 | CT Racial Profiling Prohibition Project, 2021 |
| Stanford Open Policing Project | Across 21 state patrol agencies, Black drivers were stopped at higher rates; lower search thresholds applied to Black and Hispanic drivers | 2015-2020 | Stanford Open Policing, 2020 |

## Sentencing Disparities

### Federal Sentencing

The U.S. Sentencing Commission provides the most detailed data on racial disparities in federal drug sentencing.

| Metric | Value | Year | Source |
|--------|-------|------|--------|
| Average federal drug sentence (Black defendants) | 65 months | FY2022 | USSC, 2023 |
| Average federal drug sentence (white defendants) | 54 months | FY2022 | USSC, 2023 |
| Average federal drug sentence (Hispanic defendants) | 46 months | FY2022 | USSC, 2023 |
| Black-to-white sentence length ratio (drug offenses) | 1.20:1 | FY2022 | USSC, 2023 |
| Black share of federal drug offenders | 33.2% | FY2022 | USSC, 2023 |
| Black share of federal crack cocaine offenders | 77.1% | FY2022 | USSC, 2023 |
| Hispanic share of federal drug offenders | 42.7% | FY2022 | USSC, 2023 |
| White share of federal drug offenders | 21.4% | FY2022 | USSC, 2023 |

### Crack vs. Powder Cocaine

The crack/powder cocaine sentencing disparity remains the most cited example of racial bias embedded in drug sentencing law.

| Year | Crack-to-Powder Ratio | Legislative Basis |
|------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| 1986-2010 | 100:1 | Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 |
| 2010-present | 18:1 | Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 |
| Proposed (EQUAL Act) | 1:1 | Passed House 2021; stalled in Senate |

The 100:1 ratio meant that 5 grams of crack cocaine (associated with Black users) triggered the same mandatory minimum sentence as 500 grams of powder cocaine (associated with white users). The Fair Sentencing Act raised the crack threshold to 28 grams, producing an 18:1 ratio. The First Step Act of 2018 made this change retroactive, resulting in approximately 4,000 sentence reductions, 91% of which went to Black individuals (U.S. Sentencing Commission, 2023).

### Mandatory Minimums

Mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses disproportionately affect people of color.

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Black defendants receiving mandatory minimums (federal drug cases) | 38.5% | USSC, 2023 |
| White defendants receiving mandatory minimums (federal drug cases) | 24.1% | USSC, 2023 |
| Hispanic defendants receiving mandatory minimums (federal drug cases) | 47.1% | USSC, 2023 |
| Rate of government-sponsored below-mandatory-minimum departures (white defendants) | 47.3% | USSC, 2023 |
| Rate of government-sponsored below-mandatory-minimum departures (Black defendants) | 39.1% | USSC, 2023 |

### Prosecutorial Discretion

Federal prosecutors exercise significant discretion in charging decisions, particularly regarding mandatory minimum triggers.

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Cases where prosecutors filed mandatory minimum charges (Black defendants) | 65.4% | USSC Mandatory Minimum Report, 2017 |
| Cases where prosecutors filed mandatory minimum charges (white defendants) | 59.3% | USSC Mandatory Minimum Report, 2017 |
| Safety valve eligibility denial rate (Black defendants) | Higher than white | USSC, 2023 |
| Substantial assistance departures (Black defendants) | 25.3% of cases | USSC, 2023 |
| Substantial assistance departures (white defendants) | 29.5% of cases | USSC, 2023 |

## Incarceration Disparities

### Drug Imprisonment by Race

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Black drug incarceration rate (state prisons) | 469 per 100,000 Black adults | Sentencing Project, 2023 |
| White drug incarceration rate (state prisons) | 81 per 100,000 white adults | Sentencing Project, 2023 |
| Black-to-white drug incarceration ratio | 5.8:1 | Sentencing Project, 2023 |
| Hispanic drug incarceration rate (state prisons) | 202 per 100,000 Hispanic adults | Sentencing Project, 2023 |
| Total people incarcerated for drug offenses (federal + state) | ~400,000 | Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2023 |
| Drug offenders as share of federal prison population | 45.3% | Bureau of Prisons, 2024 |
| Drug offenders as share of state prison population | ~14.4% | Bureau of Justice Statistics, 2023 |

### Trends Over Time

| Period | Black Drug Imprisonment Rate (per 100,000) | White Rate | Ratio | Source |
|--------|---------------------------------------------|------------|-------|--------|
| 2000 | 891 | 102 | 8.7:1 | Sentencing Project, 2016 |
| 2010 | 603 | 88 | 6.9:1 | Sentencing Project, 2016 |
| 2020 | 469 | 81 | 5.8:1 | Sentencing Project, 2023 |
| 5-year trend | Declining in absolute terms | Stable | Narrowing slowly | Sentencing Project, 2023 |

The Black-to-white drug imprisonment ratio has declined from 8.7:1 in 2000 to 5.8:1 in 2020, driven primarily by reduced Black drug incarceration rates rather than increased white rates. However, the remaining disparity of nearly 6:1 remains far in excess of any difference in drug use or selling rates.

## Collateral Consequences

Drug convictions produce cascading penalties that disproportionately affect communities of color.

### Key Collateral Consequences by Race

| Consequence | Scope | Racial Impact | Source |
|-------------|-------|---------------|--------|
| Employment barriers (criminal record) | ~77 million Americans have criminal records | Black men: 33% have felony convictions vs. 8% of all adults | Shannon et al., *Demography*, 2017 |
| Public housing exclusion | Federal "one-strike" policy; HUD discretion | Disproportionately affects Black and Hispanic families in public housing | HUD, 2015 |
| Federal student aid loss | Drug conviction = automatic ineligibility (partially repealed in FAFSA Simplification Act, 2021) | Black students disproportionately affected by prior convictions | NASFAA, 2020 |
| SNAP/TANF ban for drug felons | 26 states retain full or partial ban | Black families overrepresented among those denied benefits | The Sentencing Project, 2021 |
| Felon disenfranchisement | ~4.6 million Americans disenfranchised | 1 in 16 Black adults disenfranchised (vs. 1 in 59 non-Black) | Sentencing Project, 2022 |
| Child welfare involvement | Drug conviction increases foster care placement risk | Black children 2x more likely to be in foster care | Children's Bureau, 2023 |

## Cannabis Legalization and Equity

### Social Equity in Legal Cannabis

Twenty states have established cannabis social equity programs designed to ensure that communities harmed by prohibition benefit from legalization. Implementation has been uneven.

| State | Equity Program Features | Status (2024) | Source |
|-------|------------------------|---------------|--------|
| Illinois | Prioritized licenses for disproportionately impacted areas; $30M community reinvestment fund | Operational but criticized for slow rollout | Illinois DCEO, 2024 |
| New York | 50% of licenses reserved for social equity applicants; $200M community reinvestment fund | First licenses issued 2023; legal challenges pending | NY OCM, 2024 |
| New Jersey | Priority licensing; 70% of cannabis tax revenue to Impact Zones | Operational | NJ CRC, 2024 |
| California | Local equity programs in Oakland, Los Angeles, San Francisco | Mixed results; equity licensees face capital barriers | CA DCC, 2024 |
| Massachusetts | Social equity program; priority review | Slow progress; equity applicants outpaced by corporate entrants | MA CCC, 2024 |

### Ownership Disparities

| Metric | Value | Source |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Black ownership of cannabis businesses | ~2-4% of licensed operators nationally | Marijuana Business Daily, 2023 |
| White ownership of cannabis businesses | ~80-85% of licensed operators | Marijuana Business Daily, 2023 |
| Legal cannabis industry revenue (2023) | ~$33.6 billion | MJBizDaily, 2024 |
| Share of cannabis industry employment (minorities) | ~28% | Headset/Leafly, 2023 |

## Geographic Variation

Racial disparities in drug enforcement vary substantially by jurisdiction, reflecting differences in policing strategies, prosecutorial cultures, and state law.

### Regional Patterns

| Region | Characteristic Disparity Pattern | Key Examples |
|--------|----------------------------------|--------------|
| Northeast | Lower overall arrest rates post-legalization; persistent disparities in non-cannabis drug enforcement | New York, Massachusetts |
| South | Higher absolute arrest rates; pronounced Black-white disparities | Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama |
| Midwest | Highest marijuana arrest disparity ratios | Iowa, Illinois (pre-legalization), Wisconsin |
| West | Lower disparities where cannabis is legal; persistent disparities in methamphetamine enforcement targeting Latino communities | California, Oregon |

## Recent Developments (2020-2025)

- **George Floyd Policing Reforms**: Following the 2020 racial justice protests, several cities and states enacted policing reforms including restrictions on pretextual stops and consent searches, though most did not directly address drug enforcement disparities.
- **Oregon Measure 110**: Oregon decriminalized personal possession of all drugs in 2020, the first U.S. state to do so. Black Oregonians represented 2% of the state population but 6% of drug possession arrests pre-decriminalization (Oregon Criminal Justice Commission, 2022). Oregon partially reversed the policy in 2024 amid concerns about public drug use and inadequate treatment infrastructure.
- **Federal Marijuana Scheduling Review**: In 2024, the DEA initiated a rulemaking process to reschedule marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III, following an HHS recommendation. Rescheduling would not legalize marijuana but could reduce some federal enforcement disparities.
- **EQUAL Act**: The Eliminating a Quantifiably Unjust Application of the Law (EQUAL) Act, which would have eliminated the crack/powder cocaine sentencing disparity entirely, passed the House in 2021 but stalled in the Senate despite bipartisan support.
- **Expungement Movement**: As of 2024, at least 13 states have enacted automatic or streamlined expungement for cannabis convictions, though implementation has been slow. Illinois expunged approximately 800,000 cannabis-related records through its Clean Slate program (Illinois Governor's Office, 2023).

## Emerging Challenges

- **Fentanyl Enforcement Disparities**: As enforcement focus shifts to fentanyl, early data suggests racial disparities are replicating in synthetic opioid cases. Black individuals constituted 19.4% of federal fentanyl trafficking defendants in FY2022, while Hispanic individuals constituted 52.8% (USSC, 2023). Latino communities face increasing targeting in fentanyl enforcement operations near the southern border.
- **Digital Surveillance**: Drug enforcement increasingly relies on geofence warrants, cell-site location information, and social media monitoring, tools that may reproduce racial bias when directed at historically over-policed communities.
- **Cannabis Banking Gap**: The lack of federal banking access for cannabis businesses disproportionately affects social equity licensees who lack the capital reserves to operate as cash-only businesses.
- **Data Gaps**: The FBI's transition from the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) system to the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) in 2021 created data gaps that make trend analysis more difficult, as not all agencies initially complied with NIBRS reporting requirements.
