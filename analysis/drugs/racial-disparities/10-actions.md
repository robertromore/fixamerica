# Racial Disparities in Drug Policy: What You Can Do

Racial disparities in drug enforcement are sustained by political choices, institutional inertia, and public indifference. They can be changed by sustained citizen engagement -- through advocacy, electoral action, community organizing, and professional practice. The reforms outlined in this analysis require not only legislative action but also the persistent public pressure that makes such action politically feasible.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- Read the ACLU's "A Tale of Two Countries" report (2020) for definitive data on marijuana arrest disparities: <https://www.aclu.org/report/tale-two-countries-racially-targeted-arrests-era-marijuana-reform>
- Follow The Sentencing Project's research updates for the most current data on racial incarceration disparities: <https://www.sentencingproject.org>
- Subscribe to The Marshall Project's daily newsletter for ongoing criminal justice reporting: <https://www.themarshallproject.org/subscribe>
- Track federal sentencing data through the U.S. Sentencing Commission's Interactive Data Analyzer: <https://ida.ussc.gov>
- Read Michelle Alexander's *The New Jim Crow* for foundational analysis of how the War on Drugs created a system of racial control

### Make Personal Changes

- Examine your own assumptions about who uses drugs, who sells drugs, and who is dangerous. Research shows that drug use rates are comparable across racial groups (~15% for Black adults, ~14% for white adults, SAMHSA NSDUH 2023).
- If you serve on a jury in a drug case, be aware of the research on racial bias in drug enforcement and exercise your role as a check on prosecutorial power.
- If you are an employer, evaluate your criminal background check policies. Consider "ban the box" approaches and individualized assessment rather than blanket exclusions for drug convictions.

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact Your Representatives**: Urge your Senators to pass the EQUAL Act (crack/powder cocaine equalization). Urge your House member to support the Drug Enforcement Data Transparency Act and federal cannabis legalization with equity provisions.
- **Submit Public Comments**: When the DEA, DOJ, or HUD propose rules related to drug scheduling, enforcement policy, or public housing drug policies, submit comments advocating for racial equity. Federal rulemaking notices are published at <https://www.regulations.gov>.
- **Write Letters to the Editor**: Respond to local media coverage of drug enforcement with data on racial disparities. Local newspapers remain influential in shaping opinions of elected officials.
- **Share Information**: Amplify credible research on drug enforcement disparities from the ACLU, Sentencing Project, and Drug Policy Alliance on social media platforms.

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- Attend your local city council or county commission meetings when drug enforcement budgets, police department policies, or marijuana ordinances are on the agenda. Many jurisdictions have deprioritized marijuana enforcement through local ordinances.
- Organize community forums on drug enforcement disparities featuring local data. Contact your police department's public information office to request demographic data on drug arrests in your jurisdiction.
- Partner with local chapters of the NAACP, ACLU, and Drug Policy Alliance to build coalitions for local reform.
- Support or establish a civilian police oversight board with authority to review drug enforcement practices and demographics.

### Build Coalitions

- Connect criminal justice reform advocates with faith communities, which can provide moral authority and institutional support for reform efforts. Many religious traditions emphasize redemption, second chances, and justice.
- Bridge the gap between cannabis industry entrepreneurs and social equity advocates -- legal cannabis businesses have financial resources and political access that can support equity campaigns.
- Engage public health organizations as allies: racial disparities in drug enforcement are a public health issue that undermines treatment access and community well-being.

## Political Actions

### Contact Elected Officials

**When to Contact**:

- When the EQUAL Act or cannabis legalization legislation is scheduled for committee markup or floor vote
- During budget season (February-September) when drug enforcement funding is being determined
- After high-profile incidents of racially disparate drug enforcement in your community
- During judicial confirmation hearings for judges who will hear drug cases

**What to Say - Template Email**:

```
Subject: Support the EQUAL Act and Drug Enforcement Equity Reform

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

I am a constituent from [City, State] writing to urge your support for addressing
racial disparities in drug enforcement -- one of the most well-documented civil
rights issues in our criminal justice system.

Specifically, I ask you to:

1. Co-sponsor and vote for the EQUAL Act to eliminate the crack/powder cocaine
   sentencing disparity (currently 18:1). This bill passed the House in 2021 with
   bipartisan support (361-66).

2. Support federal cannabis legalization with robust equity provisions, including
   automatic expungement of cannabis convictions and community reinvestment in
   neighborhoods most harmed by the War on Drugs.

3. Support mandatory data collection and public reporting on drug enforcement
   outcomes by race, conditioned on federal law enforcement funding.

The data is clear: Black Americans are 3.73 times more likely to be arrested for
marijuana possession despite roughly comparable use rates (ACLU, 2020). Black
individuals constitute 77.1% of federal crack cocaine offenders while representing
13.6% of the population (USSC, 2023). These are not statistics -- they are people
whose lives have been unjustly disrupted.

I would appreciate knowing your position on these issues.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say - Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City]. I'm calling to ask
the [Representative/Senator] to support the EQUAL Act to eliminate the crack/powder
cocaine sentencing disparity, and to support federal cannabis legalization with social
equity provisions. Black Americans are nearly four times more likely to be arrested
for marijuana despite similar use rates. Can you please note my position?"
```

### Support Legislation

Current or proposed legislation to support:

- **EQUAL Act**: Eliminates the crack/powder cocaine sentencing disparity by setting a 1:1 ratio. Passed the House in 2021 with 361 votes. Contact your Senators to co-sponsor and advance to a vote.
- **Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act (CAOA)**: Comprehensive federal cannabis legalization with social equity provisions, expungement, and community reinvestment. Contact your Representative and Senator to co-sponsor.
- **Clean Slate Act**: Automatic sealing of federal criminal records after a waiting period. Contact your Representative and Senator to co-sponsor.
- **George Floyd Justice in Policing Act**: Includes restrictions on pretextual stops, mandatory data collection, and reforms to qualified immunity. Contact your Senators to overcome the filibuster.
- **State-level cannabis legalization and equity bills**: Check your state legislature's calendar for pending cannabis legalization bills and advocate for inclusion of social equity provisions, expungement, and reinvestment.

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "What is your position on the crack/powder cocaine sentencing disparity? Do you support the EQUAL Act to equalize sentencing at 1:1?"
2. "Do you support requiring law enforcement agencies to collect and publicly report drug enforcement data by race as a condition of federal funding?"
3. "Do you support federal cannabis legalization with social equity provisions, automatic expungement, and community reinvestment?"
4. "As prosecutor [if applicable], will you adopt charging guidelines that limit mandatory minimum triggers for low-level, non-violent drug offenses, and will you publicly report charging data by race?"
5. "Do you support eliminating collateral consequences of drug convictions, including barriers to housing, employment, and public benefits?"

**Voting Considerations**:

- Research candidates' positions on criminal justice reform through organizations like the ACLU's voter guide and the Drug Policy Alliance's scorecard
- For local prosecutor races, examine whether candidates commit to data transparency, diversion programs, and reduced reliance on mandatory minimums
- Support candidates for state legislature who back cannabis legalization with equity provisions
- Pay attention to judicial candidates' records on drug sentencing and racial equity

## Professional Actions

- **For Attorneys**: Volunteer with public defender offices or legal aid organizations providing expungement assistance. Organizations like the National Expungement Project coordinate pro bono expungement clinics.
- **For Healthcare Professionals**: Advocate within your institution for treatment-first approaches to substance use disorder that reduce reliance on criminal justice referrals. Support medication-assisted treatment access in communities of color.
- **For Educators**: Incorporate evidence on racial disparities in drug enforcement into criminal justice, public health, and social studies curricula. Support students affected by the collateral consequences of drug convictions.
- **For Journalists**: Investigate and report on drug enforcement disparities in your local jurisdiction. Request demographic data on drug arrests, charges, and sentences from local law enforcement and courts.
- **For Business Leaders**: Adopt fair-chance hiring practices that evaluate individuals with drug convictions based on qualifications rather than blanket exclusion. Partner with reentry organizations to create employment pathways.
- **For Social Workers and Counselors**: Provide culturally competent support to individuals and families affected by racially disparate drug enforcement. Advocate for policy changes within your professional organizations.

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing racial disparities in drug enforcement with others, emphasize:

1. **The data is unambiguous**: Black Americans are 3.73 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana despite comparable use rates (ACLU, 2020). This is not a matter of opinion -- it is documented by the federal government's own data.
2. **Disparities exist at every stage**: From stops and searches (Stanford Open Policing Project) to charging (USSC Mandatory Minimum Report, 2017) to sentencing (USSC Annual Report, FY2022) to incarceration (5.8:1 Black-to-white drug imprisonment ratio, Sentencing Project 2023).
3. **This costs everyone**: Drug-related incarceration costs taxpayers $47.8 billion annually (BJS, 2022). Treatment is seven times more cost-effective than law enforcement at reducing drug use (RAND Corporation).
4. **Reform has bipartisan precedent**: The First Step Act passed the Senate 87-12. The EQUAL Act passed the House 361-66. These are not partisan issues.

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "Black Americans use drugs at higher rates" | Drug use rates are roughly comparable across races (~15% vs. ~14% past-year illicit drug use) | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2023 |
| "Disparities reflect different crime rates" | Arrest rate disparities far exceed any plausible difference in offending; search hit rates are lower for Black drivers | Stanford Open Policing Project, 2020; ACLU, 2020 |
| "The crack/powder disparity was based on science" | The USSC has repeatedly found the disparity unjustified; crack and powder cocaine are pharmacologically identical | USSC Reports, 1995-2007 |
| "Reducing sentences will increase crime" | States that reduced drug penalties have not seen crime increases; treatment is 7x more effective | National Research Council, 2014; RAND Corporation |
| "Cannabis legalization has fixed the problem" | The 3.73:1 Black-to-white marijuana arrest ratio was unchanged after years of legalization | ACLU, 2020 |
