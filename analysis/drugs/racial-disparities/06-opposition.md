# Racial Disparities in Drug Policy: Opposition to Reform

Proposals to address racial disparities in drug enforcement face resistance from those who believe that disparities reflect differences in criminal behavior rather than systemic bias, that aggressive enforcement protects minority communities, that reform will increase drug use and crime, and that race-conscious remedies violate principles of equal treatment under law.

## Who Opposes Reform

### Organized Opposition

| Actor | Interest | Resources | Tactics |
|-------|----------|-----------|---------|
| Fraternal Order of Police (FOP) | Preserve officer discretion; oppose restrictions on stops, searches, and drug-free zone enhancements | 356,000 members; significant lobbying budget; endorsed candidates in every presidential cycle | Lobbying against consent search bans, mandatory data collection, and prosecutorial accountability; public campaigns framing reform as anti-police |
| National District Attorneys Association (NDAA) | Maintain prosecutorial discretion; oppose charging transparency requirements | Represents ~2,300 elected prosecutors; political access at state and federal levels | Oppose mandatory data reporting on charging decisions by race; resist diversion mandates; lobby against mandatory minimum reform |
| CoreCivic and GEO Group (private prisons) | Revenue dependent on incarceration rates | $3.9 billion combined annual revenue (FY2022); $5.6 million in federal lobbying (2022) | Lobby against sentencing reform, decriminalization, and early release programs; contribute to candidates opposing reform |
| National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO) | Protect law enforcement authority; oppose oversight mandates | Coalition of police unions and associations | Campaign against federal policing reform legislation; oppose DOJ pattern-and-practice investigations |
| Some elected prosecutors (particularly in Southern and rural jurisdictions) | Maintain tough-on-crime political brand; preserve charging discretion | Electoral incentives in jurisdictions where "soft on crime" attacks are effective | Public opposition to sentencing reform; resistance to data collection mandates; use of media to frame reform as increasing crime |

### Ideological Opposition

- **Traditionalist Conservatives**: Believe that disparities reflect different rates of criminal behavior, not systemic bias. Oppose race-conscious remedies as violating equal treatment principles. Argue that drug enforcement protects law-abiding residents of minority communities who are victimized by drug markets.
- **Law-and-Order Populists**: View drug enforcement as essential public safety. Oppose reducing penalties for drug offenses. Frame reform as benefiting criminals at the expense of victims and communities.
- **Some Religious Right Leaders**: Support punitive approaches to drug use as moral deterrence. Oppose harm reduction and decriminalization as enabling sin. Some have shifted toward treatment-oriented approaches for opioids but resist applying the same framework to drugs associated with minority communities.
- **Constitutional Originalists**: Oppose federal mandates on state and local law enforcement as exceeding federal authority. Argue that Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment does not authorize Congress to impose data collection or anti-disparate-impact requirements on local police and prosecutors.

## Opposition Arguments and Rebuttals

### Argument 1: Disparities Reflect Differential Offending, Not Bias

**Claim**: Racial disparities in drug arrests and incarceration reflect differences in the nature, frequency, and visibility of drug offenses committed by different racial groups, not discrimination by law enforcement or prosecutors. Black Americans are arrested for drug offenses at higher rates because they are more likely to conduct drug transactions in open-air markets, in public housing, and in high-crime neighborhoods, making offenses more visible to police.

**Evidence Cited**: Arrest data showing higher rates of drug offending in Black neighborhoods; studies suggesting that outdoor drug markets are more common in urban areas; arguments that drug dealing (not just use) is more concentrated in minority communities.

**Reality**: The foundational premise -- that drug use rates are comparable across racial groups -- is supported by the federal government's own data. SAMHSA's National Survey on Drug Use and Health consistently finds roughly comparable rates of illicit drug use across racial groups (~15% past-year use for Black adults vs. ~14% for white adults, NSDUH 2023). Drug selling rates are also roughly comparable: a 2012 study by Ramchand, Pacula, and Iguchi in the *Journal of Quantitative Criminology* found that rates of drug selling are similar across racial groups. The "visibility" argument assumes that enforcement should target the most *visible* offenses rather than the most *harmful*, and ignores that law enforcement agencies choose where to deploy officers, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy of higher arrests in over-policed neighborhoods.

**Rebuttal**: If differential offending explained the disparities, we would expect contraband hit rates during searches to be higher for Black individuals. In fact, the opposite is true: the Stanford Open Policing Project found lower contraband hit rates for searches of Black and Hispanic drivers, indicating that police apply lower evidentiary thresholds to minority individuals. Disparities in arrest rates far exceed any plausible difference in offending rates.

### Argument 2: Drug Enforcement Protects Minority Communities

**Claim**: Aggressive drug enforcement benefits law-abiding residents of minority communities who are most victimized by open-air drug markets, drug-related violence, and the social disorder associated with drug use. Reducing enforcement will leave these communities more vulnerable to drug-related crime.

**Evidence Cited**: Community surveys showing that Black residents want police presence and safety; crime victimization data showing higher violent crime rates in neighborhoods with active drug markets; the "Ferguson effect" theory that reduced policing leads to increased crime.

**Reality**: While it is true that many residents of minority communities want effective policing, there is a critical distinction between targeted enforcement of violent drug trafficking and broad-sweep arrest strategies that criminalize low-level users and non-violent participants. Gallup and Pew Research polling consistently shows that Black Americans want a police presence *and* want reform -- these are not contradictory. A 2021 Gallup poll found that 81% of Black Americans wanted police to spend the same amount of time or more in their area, but a 2020 Pew Research Center survey found that 87% of Black adults said the criminal justice system needs major changes.

**Rebuttal**: The evidence shows that aggressive drug enforcement does not reduce drug availability or drug-related violence in minority communities; it destabilizes them. Research by Doleac (2017) in the *Journal of Political Economy* found that mass incarceration in Black communities increases future crime by removing working-age men, destabilizing families, and concentrating disadvantage. The communities most targeted by drug enforcement are not safer -- they are more destabilized.

### Argument 3: Race-Conscious Remedies Are Unconstitutional or Counterproductive

**Claim**: Reforms that explicitly target racial disparities -- such as social equity licensing programs, race-based expungement priorities, or community reinvestment directed to neighborhoods defined by racial demographics -- violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The remedy for past discrimination should be race-neutral policies, not policies that grant preferences based on race.

**Evidence Cited**: Supreme Court decisions restricting race-conscious government action, including *Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard* (2023); arguments that race-neutral alternatives (e.g., income-based targeting) would achieve similar results without constitutional risk.

**Reality**: Most reform proposals are not explicitly race-based. Cannabis social equity programs typically use geographic and socioeconomic criteria (e.g., residence in a "disproportionately impacted area") rather than racial classifications, which avoids strict scrutiny under current Equal Protection doctrine. Sentencing reform, prosecutorial transparency requirements, and data collection mandates are race-neutral on their face but designed to reduce disparate impact. The choice to frame these proposals as "race-conscious" is often a rhetorical strategy to generate opposition.

**Rebuttal**: The Equal Protection Clause was designed to protect against government discrimination, not to prevent government from remedying it. Even under current doctrine, race-neutral policies designed to address documented disparities -- such as geographic targeting based on arrest data -- are constitutionally permissible. The *Students for Fair Admissions* decision addressed race-conscious admissions, not all race-aware policy-making.

### Argument 4: Reducing Drug Sentences Will Increase Drug Use and Crime

**Claim**: Harsh sentences deter drug use and drug dealing. Reducing mandatory minimums and decriminalizing possession will lead to increased drug consumption, more addiction, and higher crime rates.

**Evidence Cited**: Basic deterrence theory; anecdotal evidence from jurisdictions perceived to have "gone soft" on drugs; the Oregon Measure 110 experience.

**Reality**: Decades of research on deterrence find that the certainty of apprehension, not the severity of punishment, is the primary deterrent. A 2014 National Research Council report concluded that "the evidence is insufficient to justify the conclusion that these policies [mandatory minimums] have a meaningful deterrent effect." States that have reduced drug penalties have not experienced increases in drug use. A RAND Corporation review found that drug treatment is seven times more cost-effective than domestic law enforcement at reducing cocaine consumption. Oregon's challenges with Measure 110 were primarily implementation failures (insufficient treatment infrastructure) rather than evidence that decriminalization increases drug use.

**Rebuttal**: If harsh sentences deterred drug use, the United States -- which has the harshest drug penalties in the developed world -- should have the lowest drug use rates. Instead, it has among the highest. The 50-year experiment with escalating drug penalties has produced no reduction in drug use and has generated the world's highest incarceration rate.

### Argument 5: The Crack/Powder Disparity Reflected Legitimate Concerns

**Claim**: The 100:1 crack/powder cocaine sentencing disparity was a rational legislative response to the crack epidemic, which brought devastating violence to urban communities. Crack cocaine was associated with more violent behavior, more addictive patterns, and a broader social harm than powder cocaine. Congress was responding to urgent constituent demands from communities affected by crack violence.

**Evidence Cited**: High homicide rates during the crack epidemic; the Congressional Black Caucus's initial support for tough crack penalties; pharmacological arguments about crack's faster onset and more addictive potential.

**Reality**: Crack and powder cocaine are pharmacologically identical -- both are cocaine hydrochloride. The method of delivery (smoking vs. snorting) produces a faster onset but shorter duration. The U.S. Sentencing Commission has repeatedly concluded that the sentencing disparity "overstate[s] the relative harmfulness of crack cocaine." While the Congressional Black Caucus did support the 1986 Anti-Drug Abuse Act, this support was a product of the crisis facing their constituents and occurred before the disparate racial impact was clear. By the mid-1990s, the CBC was actively fighting to repeal the disparity. The violence associated with the crack epidemic was driven by the economics of drug markets (turf wars, cash transactions), not by the pharmacological properties of crack cocaine.

**Rebuttal**: If the crack/powder disparity were based on legitimate pharmacological or public safety distinctions, it would have been supported by the U.S. Sentencing Commission -- the expert body charged with evaluating federal sentencing policy. Instead, the Commission has recommended elimination of the disparity in every report since 1995. The disparity was a product of moral panic, racial stereotyping, and legislative haste, not evidence-based policy-making.

## Historical Patterns of Opposition

Opposition to addressing racial disparities in drug enforcement has followed a consistent pattern since the 1990s:

1. **Deny the Disparity** (1990s): Initial responses to disparity data argued that the statistics were misleading or that they reflected differential offending.
2. **Acknowledge but Justify** (2000s): As data accumulated, opponents shifted to arguing that disparities were justified by legitimate public safety concerns or were an unavoidable consequence of geography-based enforcement.
3. **Accept Partial Reform, Block Comprehensive Change** (2010s-present): Opponents conceded that the 100:1 crack/powder ratio was unjust but resisted equalization to 1:1. They supported the First Step Act's modest reforms but opposed comprehensive legislation like the EQUAL Act or mandatory prosecutorial transparency.

## Counter-Strategies

### Political Strategies

- **Bipartisan Framing**: Emphasize fiscal conservatism (mass incarceration costs $47.8 billion annually for drug offenses), limited government principles (prosecutorial accountability, data transparency), and Second Chance values (reentry, faith-based programs) to appeal to conservative reform allies.
- **Unlikely Alliances**: Continue building on the Koch-network/ACLU alliance that supported the First Step Act. Engage faith communities, veterans' organizations, and business groups that support workforce reentry.
- **Electoral Accountability**: Support progressive prosecutor candidates who commit to data transparency, charging reform, and diversion programs. Track and publicize racial disparity data by jurisdiction to hold elected prosecutors accountable.

### Communication Strategies

- **Lead with Stories**: Use specific cases of individuals whose lives were destroyed by racially disparate drug enforcement -- e.g., people serving decades for low-level crack offenses while equivalent powder cocaine offenses received probation.
- **Emphasize Shared Values**: Frame reform in terms of equal treatment under law, fiscal responsibility, family stability, and community safety rather than exclusively as a racial justice issue. Polling shows broader support for "fairness" and "equal treatment" framing than for "racial equity" framing.
- **Respond to Crime Concerns Directly**: Acknowledge that communities affected by drug markets deserve safety, and explain how targeted enforcement of violent trafficking -- rather than mass arrest of low-level users -- better serves public safety.

### Policy Design Strategies

- **Race-Neutral, Disparity-Reducing Design**: Use geographic and socioeconomic criteria rather than racial classifications to target reform benefits, reducing constitutional vulnerability while still directing resources to the communities most affected by disparate enforcement.
- **Transparency First**: Mandatory data collection and public reporting requirements are difficult to oppose on principle -- who is against transparency? -- and create the factual foundation for further reform.
- **Bipartisan Sequencing**: Begin with sentencing reforms and retroactivity provisions that have demonstrated bipartisan support (the First Step Act passed 87-12 in the Senate), then build momentum for enforcement and prosecutorial reforms.
