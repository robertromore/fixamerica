# Racial Disparities in Drug Policy

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of racial disparities in the enforcement, prosecution, sentencing, and collateral consequences of U.S. drug policy.

## Overview

The War on Drugs has been enforced with profound and well-documented racial disparities at every stage of the criminal justice process -- from stops and searches, to arrests, to prosecution, to sentencing, to incarceration. Despite roughly comparable rates of drug use across racial groups, Black Americans are nearly four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white Americans, and Black and Latino individuals are disproportionately represented among those incarcerated for drug offenses. The crack/powder cocaine sentencing disparity, which Congress partially addressed in the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010 and the EQUAL Act discussions that followed, remains a defining example of how facially neutral drug laws produce racially disparate outcomes.

These disparities are not incidental -- they reflect deliberate policy choices, structural incentives in policing and prosecution, and the cumulative effects of decades of racially targeted enforcement. The consequences extend far beyond incarceration: drug convictions trigger collateral penalties including loss of public housing eligibility, exclusion from federal student aid, employment discrimination, and disenfranchisement in many states. Communities of color bear the compounding costs of family disruption, economic exclusion, and diminished civic participation.

This analysis examines the historical origins of racially disparate drug enforcement, the current data on disparities at each stage of the system, the root causes that sustain these patterns, and a range of reform proposals -- from sentencing reform and prosecutorial accountability to cannabis social equity programs and community reinvestment strategies.
