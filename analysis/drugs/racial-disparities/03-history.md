# Racial Disparities in Drug Policy: History

## Historical Development

Racial disparities in American drug enforcement are not an unintended byproduct of well-meaning policy -- they are a defining feature of drug prohibition from its origins. From the earliest narcotics laws of the early 1900s through the crack cocaine panic of the 1980s and the mass incarceration era that followed, racial animus, racial stereotyping, and racially selective enforcement have been embedded in the design, rhetoric, and implementation of drug policy. Understanding this history is essential to grasping why disparities persist and why structural reform -- not merely better intentions -- is required.

### Early Narcotics Regulation (1875-1937): Race as the Foundation of Prohibition

- **Anti-Chinese Opium Laws (1875-1909)**: The first American drug prohibition -- San Francisco's 1875 ordinance banning opium dens -- was explicitly targeted at Chinese immigrants. The law criminalized smoking opium in dens (associated with Chinese laborers) while leaving oral opium consumption (common among white Americans) legal. The federal Harrison Narcotics Tax Act of 1914 was debated in Congress with explicit racial rhetoric about "drug-crazed" minorities.

- **Anti-Cocaine Legislation and Black Americans (1900-1914)**: Early 20th-century campaigns for cocaine prohibition were fueled by lurid, fabricated newspaper accounts of Black men using cocaine and becoming violent, sexually aggressive, and impervious to bullets. Dr. Hamilton Wright, a key architect of the Harrison Act, testified to Congress in 1910 that cocaine made Black men rape white women. These racial myths drove the inclusion of cocaine in federal narcotics control.

- **Marijuana Prohibition and Mexican Americans (1910-1937)**: The criminalization of marijuana was intertwined with anti-Mexican sentiment following the Mexican Revolution (1910-1920). Harry Anslinger, the first commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (1930-1962), promoted marijuana prohibition using racist claims about Mexican and Black people. Anslinger told Congress that marijuana caused white women to seek relations with "Negroes" and that "most are Negroes, Hispanics, Filipinos, and entertainers" who used the drug. The Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 formalized federal prohibition.

### Mid-Century Enforcement (1937-1970): Selective Enforcement Takes Shape

- **Jazz and Counterculture Targeting**: The Federal Bureau of Narcotics under Anslinger specifically targeted Black jazz musicians including Billie Holiday, who was arrested for heroin possession in 1947 and denied medical treatment while hospitalized, dying handcuffed to her hospital bed in 1959. The FBN used drug laws as tools to control Black cultural figures perceived as threatening racial hierarchies.

- **The Boggs Act (1951) and Daniel Act (1956)**: Congress established mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses for the first time, setting a 2-year minimum for first-time marijuana possession and up to 10 years for repeat offenses. These laws fell disproportionately on urban communities of color. They were partially repealed in 1970 but established the template for later mandatory minimum regimes.

- **Shift Toward Treatment (1960s)**: President Kennedy's 1963 Community Mental Health Act and the Narcotic Addict Rehabilitation Act of 1966 briefly shifted federal policy toward treatment -- but primarily for white, middle-class heroin users. Black addicts were more likely to be channeled into the criminal justice system.

### The War on Drugs Begins (1971-1985): Racial Targeting by Design

- **Nixon's War on Drugs (1971)**: President Richard Nixon declared drug abuse "public enemy number one" in June 1971 and launched the War on Drugs, creating the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in 1973. John Ehrlichman, Nixon's domestic policy advisor, later acknowledged the racial and political motivations in a 1994 interview published by Harper's Magazine in 2016: "We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or Black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and Blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities."

- **Heroin Crackdown**: Nixon-era enforcement concentrated on heroin, which was associated in public discourse with Black urban communities. Federal funding surged for enforcement in cities while treatment funding, though initially increased, was soon eclipsed by enforcement spending.

- **Rockefeller Drug Laws (1973)**: New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller signed the nation's harshest drug sentencing laws, imposing mandatory minimum sentences of 15 years to life for possession of four ounces of narcotics. These laws devastated Black and Latino communities in New York City. By 2002, 94% of those imprisoned under the Rockefeller Laws were Black or Hispanic (Correctional Association of New York, 2003).

- **Reagan Escalation (1981-1985)**: President Ronald Reagan dramatically escalated the War on Drugs, increasing federal drug enforcement spending from $1.5 billion in FY1981 to $4.2 billion by FY1986. First Lady Nancy Reagan's "Just Say No" campaign simplified drug policy into a moral crusade. The Administration on its own initiative began the military's involvement in drug interdiction.

### The Crack Era (1986-1994): Disparity Codified in Law

- **Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986**: In the wake of Len Bias's cocaine-related death, Congress passed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, which established the 100:1 crack-to-powder cocaine sentencing disparity. Under this law, possession of 5 grams of crack cocaine (the form predominantly used by Black Americans) triggered the same 5-year mandatory minimum as 500 grams of powder cocaine (the form predominantly used by white Americans). The law was passed with minimal deliberation -- there were no hearings and no testimony from pharmacological experts, judges, or the Sentencing Commission.

- **Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988**: This law created the federal "drug kingpin" statute with a potential death penalty for major drug traffickers, established the Office of National Drug Control Policy ("drug czar"), and created the "crack house" statute. It also added the public housing "one-strike" eviction policy, which allowed federally assisted housing authorities to evict entire households if any member or guest was involved in drug activity.

- **The 1994 Crime Bill**: The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 expanded federal death penalty eligibility to 60 additional offenses including large-scale drug trafficking, provided $9.7 billion for prison construction, established "three strikes" mandatory life sentences, and funded 100,000 new police officers. The Congressional Black Caucus voted for the bill, but with significant internal dissent, viewing it as a painful trade-off to secure the bill's Violence Against Women Act provisions and an assault weapons ban.

- **Racial Impact of the Crack Era**: Between 1986 and 2000, the number of Black Americans incarcerated in state prisons for drug offenses increased by a factor of 4.6, from approximately 25,000 to 115,000 (Human Rights Watch, 2000). By 1996, Black Americans constituted 84.5% of federal crack cocaine convictions (USSC, 1997).

### Reform Begins (1995-2015): Slow, Partial Corrections

- **U.S. Sentencing Commission Reports (1995-2002)**: The U.S. Sentencing Commission issued four reports recommending reduction or elimination of the crack/powder disparity in 1995, 1997, 2002, and 2007. Congress rejected the 1995 recommendation -- the only time it has overridden a Sentencing Commission recommendation.

- **Declining Crime and the "Smart on Crime" Shift**: As crime rates fell sharply from their early-1990s peak, political space opened for reform. Conservative commentators including Pat Nolan and Newt Gingrich joined reform coalitions, arguing that mass incarceration was fiscally unsustainable.

- **Fair Sentencing Act of 2010**: After 15 years of advocacy, Congress passed the Fair Sentencing Act, reducing the crack/powder cocaine sentencing disparity from 100:1 to 18:1 and eliminating the mandatory minimum for simple crack possession. President Obama signed it on August 3, 2010. The law was prospective only, leaving approximately 12,000 federal prisoners serving sentences under the old 100:1 ratio.

- **Holder Memoranda (2013-2014)**: Attorney General Eric Holder issued the "Smart on Crime" initiative, directing federal prosecutors to avoid charging mandatory minimum sentences in certain low-level, non-violent drug cases ("charge below the mandatory minimum") and to expand use of compassionate release. This policy reduced the Black-white gap in federal drug sentencing during Holder's tenure but was reversed under Attorney General Jeff Sessions in 2017.

- **State-Level Reforms**: Between 2000 and 2015, numerous states reformed drug sentencing laws. New York partially repealed the Rockefeller Laws in 2004 and 2009. California voters approved Proposition 47 in 2014, reclassifying drug possession from a felony to a misdemeanor, leading to significant reductions in incarceration.

### Contemporary Era (2016-Present): Partial Progress, Persistent Disparities

- **First Step Act (2018)**: The most significant federal criminal justice reform in a generation, the First Step Act made the Fair Sentencing Act retroactive, expanded the safety valve for mandatory minimums, allowed for earned time credits, and reformed mandatory sentences for certain drug offenses. Approximately 4,000 people received sentence reductions under the retroactivity provision, 91% of whom were Black (USSC, 2023). The Act passed with broad bipartisan support, 87-12 in the Senate.

- **Cannabis Legalization Wave (2016-2024)**: Beginning with California, Massachusetts, Nevada, and Maine in 2016, a wave of state cannabis legalization created a $33.6 billion legal industry by 2023. However, the economic benefits have accrued overwhelmingly to white entrepreneurs, prompting social equity programs in states including Illinois, New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.

- **George Floyd and Racial Justice (2020-2021)**: The murder of George Floyd in May 2020 catalyzed the largest racial justice protests in American history and brought renewed scrutiny to racially disparate policing and drug enforcement. Several cities deprioritized low-level drug possession enforcement. President Biden issued an executive order in May 2022 promoting accountability in federal law enforcement.

- **Oregon's Decriminalization Experiment (2020-2024)**: Oregon voters approved Measure 110 in November 2020, decriminalizing personal possession of all drugs. The measure was intended partly to address racial disparities -- Black Oregonians, 2% of the population, comprised 6% of drug possession arrests. In 2024, Oregon partially reversed course, recriminalizing public drug use amid concerns about implementation.

- **Sessions and Trump Reversal**: Attorney General Jeff Sessions in 2017 rescinded the Holder-era charging memoranda, directing prosecutors to charge the most serious readily provable offense in every case. This reversal was associated with a temporary increase in racial disparities in federal charging (USSC, 2019).

## Lessons from History

### Pattern 1: Drug Laws as Instruments of Racial Control

From the anti-Chinese opium ordinances of the 1870s through the crack cocaine laws of the 1980s, American drug prohibitions have repeatedly been enacted during periods of racial anxiety and have targeted substances associated with disfavored racial or ethnic groups. The pattern is remarkably consistent: a substance is associated with a minority group through media campaigns and political rhetoric, severe penalties are enacted with minimal deliberation, enforcement concentrates on minority communities, and the resulting disparities are defended as race-neutral law enforcement. This pattern was not hidden from legislators -- it was the explicit rationale for many of these laws.

### Pattern 2: Reform Follows Changing Demographics of Impact

Political will for drug policy reform has historically emerged when the consequences of harsh enforcement begin to affect white communities. The opioid crisis -- which disproportionately affected rural white Americans -- generated a public health framing that had been largely absent from the crack cocaine epidemic. The bipartisan support for the First Step Act reflected, in part, the recognition by Republican legislators that their constituents were now affected by mandatory minimums and inadequate treatment access.

### Pattern 3: Partial Reforms Leave Structural Disparities Intact

Each major reform -- the Fair Sentencing Act, the First Step Act, state-level sentencing reforms -- has reduced disparities at the margins while leaving the structural architecture of racially disparate enforcement in place. Arrest disparities have not declined despite cannabis legalization. Prosecutorial discretion remains unconstrained. Collateral consequences continue to cascade. The lesson is that incremental reform of individual laws is necessary but insufficient; structural transformation of enforcement systems, data transparency requirements, and community investment is required.
