# Drug Pricing

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of pharmaceutical drug pricing in the United States, including the structural factors that make American prescription drugs the most expensive in the world, the policy mechanisms available to control costs, and the reform efforts underway at both the federal and state levels.

## Overview

Americans pay the highest prescription drug prices of any nation, spending an estimated $405 billion on retail prescription drugs in 2023. The United States lacks the centralized price negotiation systems used by virtually every other developed country, instead relying on a fragmented system of pharmacy benefit managers, rebates, formularies, and limited government negotiation authority. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 authorized Medicare to negotiate prices for a small number of high-expenditure drugs for the first time, but the program covers only 10 drugs in its initial cycle and does not apply to commercial insurance markets.

This analysis examines the full landscape of drug pricing policy, including the role of patent evergreening and pay-for-delay settlements in blocking generic competition, the dysfunction of the pharmacy benefit manager and rebate system, the potential for international reference pricing and drug importation, the 340B drug discount program, and emerging transparency requirements. It explores why previous reform efforts have stalled, who benefits from the current system, and what comprehensive reform could achieve in reducing costs while preserving pharmaceutical innovation.
