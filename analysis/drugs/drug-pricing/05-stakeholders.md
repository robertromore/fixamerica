# Drug Pricing: Stakeholders

The drug pricing system is shaped by the interactions of several key groups, each with distinct financial interests, political power, and capacity to influence policy outcomes. The system's complexity -- spanning patents, regulation, insurance, and distribution -- means that no single actor controls prices, but the balance of power overwhelmingly favors those who benefit from high prices.

## Who Is Affected

### Primary Stakeholders

| Group | Impact | Size | Key Interests |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|
| Patients requiring prescription drugs | Bear the direct cost of high prices through copays, coinsurance, and full-price purchases; 29% skip medications due to cost | ~131 million adults with chronic conditions; 66 million Medicare beneficiaries | Affordable medications; transparent pricing; access to new treatments |
| Uninsured and underinsured Americans | Pay full or near-full retail prices; face the most severe affordability barriers | ~27 million uninsured; ~42 million underinsured | Access to discount programs; price caps; generic availability |
| Medicare beneficiaries | Largest single group affected by drug pricing; IRA reforms directly benefit them | ~66 million (2024) | Part D coverage improvements; negotiated prices; out-of-pocket caps |
| Employers purchasing group health insurance | Bear rising drug costs through premiums; largest private payer group | ~157 million Americans covered by employer insurance | Controlling premium growth; PBM accountability; value-based purchasing |
| State Medicaid programs | Must cover most FDA-approved drugs; depend on manufacturer rebates for affordability | ~90 million enrollees across 50 states | Adequate federal rebates; 340B program integrity; supplemental rebate authority |
| Safety-net healthcare providers | Depend on 340B discounts to serve low-income patients; face financial pressure from drug costs | ~50,000 covered entities | 340B program preservation; drug cost predictability; adequate reimbursement |

### Secondary Stakeholders

- **Taxpayers**: Federal spending on prescription drugs through Medicare, Medicaid, VA, and other programs exceeds $200 billion annually, funded by general revenue and payroll taxes
- **Pharmacies (independent and chain)**: Face declining reimbursement from PBMs; independent pharmacies particularly squeezed by PBM-owned competitors
- **Healthcare providers**: Must navigate formulary restrictions, prior authorization requirements, and patient affordability concerns when prescribing
- **Researchers and academic institutions**: Drug pricing affects research funding through NIH budgets and industry-sponsored clinical trials
- **Generic and biosimilar manufacturers**: Dependent on timely patent expiration and regulatory pathways for market entry

## Who Has Power

### Decision Makers

| Actor | Role | Authority | Resources | Influence Level |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Congress | Legislates drug pricing policy, patent law, Medicare/Medicaid rules | Unlimited within constitutional bounds; budget/appropriations power | Full legislative authority | High |
| CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services) | Administers Medicare Part D, IRA negotiation program, Medicaid drug rebate program | Regulatory authority over $145 billion in Part D spending; IRA negotiation authority | 6,000+ staff; $1.5 trillion total program spending | High |
| FDA (Food and Drug Administration) | Approves drugs, generics, and biosimilars; administers REMS; manages exclusivity periods | Controls market entry for all drugs; patent listing in Orange Book | ~$7 billion budget (FY2024); 18,000+ employees | High |
| HHS Secretary | Leads IRA drug price negotiation; oversees CMS, FDA, and HRSA | Direct authority over Medicare negotiation; 340B program oversight | Cabinet-level authority | High |
| FTC (Federal Trade Commission) | Enforces antitrust law; investigates PBMs; challenges pay-for-delay | Section 5 authority; merger review; rulemaking | ~$430 million budget (FY2024); 1,100+ staff | Medium |
| U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) | Grants patents; inter partes review (IPR) proceedings | Determines patent validity; can invalidate patents through IPR | ~$4 billion budget (FY2024, fee-funded) | Medium |
| State legislatures | Enact state drug pricing laws, PBM regulations, insulin copay caps | Authority over state-regulated insurance, Medicaid programs | 50 state legislatures; 7,383 state legislators | Medium |

### Key Organizations and Institutions

- **PhRMA (Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America)**: The primary trade association for brand-name pharmaceutical manufacturers; 33 member companies; spent $374 million on lobbying in the 2022-2023 cycle; advocates against government price negotiation, international reference pricing, and importation
- **BIO (Biotechnology Innovation Organization)**: Represents biotechnology companies, including many smaller firms; advocates for patent protections and opposes compulsory licensing; 1,000+ member organizations
- **Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (PCMA)**: Trade association for PBMs; advocates against PBM transparency mandates and rebate pass-through requirements; represents CVS Caremark, Express Scripts, OptumRx, and others
- **Association for Accessible Medicines (AAM)**: Represents generic and biosimilar manufacturers; advocates for patent reform, faster FDA approvals, and policies that promote competition
- **National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA)**: Represents independent pharmacies; advocates against PBM anticompetitive practices and for direct-and-indirect remuneration (DIR) fee reform
- **AARP**: The largest advocacy organization for seniors (38 million members); has campaigned aggressively for Medicare drug price negotiation, insulin copay caps, and out-of-pocket limits
- **Patients for Affordable Drugs**: Non-profit patient advocacy organization; campaigns for drug pricing reform; does not accept pharmaceutical industry funding

### Influencers

- **Academic health economists**: Researchers at institutions like Harvard, Johns Hopkins, and RAND produce the evidence base for drug pricing policy; their findings shape Congressional debate
- **Congressional Budget Office (CBO)**: CBO "scores" (cost estimates) of drug pricing legislation can determine whether a bill advances; CBO's methodology for estimating innovation effects of price regulation has been contentious
- **State attorneys general**: Have pursued pharmaceutical companies for pricing practices, deceptive marketing, and opioid-related harms; multistate settlements have generated billions in recoveries
- **Institutional investors**: Large shareholders (BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street) own significant stakes in pharmaceutical companies and PBMs; investor pressure can influence corporate pricing decisions
- **Patient advocacy groups**: Organizations like the American Diabetes Association, American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, and disease-specific groups advocate for affordability; some accept pharmaceutical industry funding, which can influence their positions

## Stakeholder Interests and Alignment

### Aligned Interests (Potential Coalition Partners)

| Coalition | Shared Interest | Strength |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Patients, employers, state Medicaid programs | Lower drug prices; PBM transparency; generic competition | Strong -- combined constituency of 250+ million Americans |
| Generic/biosimilar manufacturers, FTC, patients | Patent reform; anti-pay-for-delay enforcement; faster generic entry | Strong -- aligned economic and policy interests |
| Independent pharmacies, patients, state regulators | PBM regulation; transparent pricing; anti-spread-pricing | Moderate -- aligned but pharmacies have limited political power |
| AARP, patient advocacy groups, labor unions | Medicare negotiation expansion; out-of-pocket caps; insulin affordability | Strong -- large membership bases and public support |
| Safety-net providers, public health advocates, Medicaid programs | 340B program preservation; drug affordability for low-income populations | Moderate -- complicated by 340B program controversies |

### Conflicting Interests

- **Manufacturers vs. Patients/Payers**: Brand-name manufacturers seek to maximize prices and extend monopoly periods; patients and payers seek affordable drugs and timely generic competition. This is the fundamental conflict in drug pricing.
- **PBMs vs. Independent Pharmacies**: PBMs use vertical integration to steer prescriptions to PBM-owned pharmacies and reimburse independent pharmacies below acquisition cost; independent pharmacies seek fair reimbursement and protection from PBM market power.
- **Brand Manufacturers vs. Generic/Biosimilar Manufacturers**: Brand companies use patent evergreening, pay-for-delay, and REMS abuse to block generic entry; generic companies seek timely market access and patent reform.
- **340B Covered Entities vs. Manufacturers**: Covered entities seek to maintain and expand 340B discounts; manufacturers argue the program has grown beyond its original intent and seek to restrict contract pharmacy arrangements.
- **Innovation Advocates vs. Affordability Advocates**: Some stakeholders (industry, some academic researchers, IP attorneys) argue that high prices are necessary to fund innovation; affordability advocates argue that the current system generates excess profits that go to shareholders rather than R&D.

### The Pharmaceutical Iron Triangle

The pharmaceutical industry maintains its influence through a classic iron triangle of mutually reinforcing relationships:

1. **Congress**: Pharmaceutical companies and their trade associations provide campaign contributions ($64 million in the 2022 cycle, OpenSecrets) and lobbying (1,500+ registered lobbyists). Key members of the Energy and Commerce, Finance, and HELP committees receive disproportionate contributions.
2. **Regulatory Agencies (FDA, CMS)**: The revolving door between industry and regulators ensures that agency officials often have industry backgrounds and may return to industry after government service. FDA user fees (PDUFA) make the agency partially dependent on industry funding.
3. **Industry**: Pharmaceutical manufacturers benefit from favorable legislation (patent extensions, non-interference clause, 12-year biologic exclusivity) and regulatory decisions (Orange Book patent listings, REMS approvals) that protect pricing power.

## Influence Mechanisms

How stakeholders exert influence on policy:

- **Lobbying**: PhRMA and individual pharmaceutical companies spent $374 million on lobbying in the 2022-2023 cycle (OpenSecrets, 2024). The pharmaceutical and health products sector deploys approximately 1,500 registered lobbyists, roughly 3 per member of Congress. Key firms include Akin Gump, Covington & Burling, and Sidley Austin.
- **Campaign Contributions**: The pharmaceutical and health products industry contributed $64 million to federal candidates and political committees in the 2022 election cycle (OpenSecrets, 2024). Contributions are bipartisan but heavily weighted toward members of committees with jurisdiction over drug policy.
- **Revolving Door**: Former members of Congress and senior staff frequently join pharmaceutical companies or lobbying firms. Notable examples include former Rep. Billy Tauzin (R-LA), who became PhRMA president after shepherding the Medicare Modernization Act; and numerous former FDA and CMS officials who join pharmaceutical company boards or consulting firms.
- **Astroturf and Patient Group Funding**: Pharmaceutical companies fund patient advocacy groups that then advocate against price controls. A 2020 study in the *Journal of General Internal Medicine* found that 12 of the 14 largest patient advocacy groups received pharmaceutical industry funding, and industry-funded groups were significantly less likely to support drug pricing reform.
- **Academic and Think Tank Funding**: Pharmaceutical companies fund academic research and think tank reports that support industry positions. Industry-funded studies are more likely to find that price regulation harms innovation (Lexchin et al., *BMJ*, 2003).
- **Legal Challenges**: The pharmaceutical industry uses litigation to delay or block reform implementation. Nine federal lawsuits challenging the IRA's constitutionality demonstrate the industry's willingness to use courts as an extension of its lobbying strategy.
