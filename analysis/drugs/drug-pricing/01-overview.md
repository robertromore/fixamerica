# Drug Pricing: Overview

## Overview

Americans pay far more for prescription drugs than citizens of any other developed nation. Total U.S. prescription drug spending reached approximately $405 billion in 2023, with per capita spending roughly 2.5 times the average of other OECD countries. A single vial of insulin that costs $10 to manufacture can retail for over $300 in the United States while selling for $30-$50 in Canada or Europe. The cancer drug Keytruda (pembrolizumab), the world's top-selling pharmaceutical product at $25 billion in global revenue in 2023, costs U.S. payers roughly $191,000 per year -- more than double the price in many European markets. These prices are not driven by manufacturing costs or market forces alone; they are the product of deliberate policy choices that shield the pharmaceutical industry from the price competition and government negotiation that exist in every other wealthy country.

The structural foundations of high drug prices in the United States include the absence of comprehensive government price negotiation (only partially addressed by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022), an expansive patent system that enables brand-name manufacturers to extend monopoly periods through "evergreening" and "pay-for-delay" settlements with generic competitors, a pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) system that operates with minimal transparency while extracting billions in rebates that often fail to reach patients, and the prohibition on commercial drug importation from countries with lower prices. The Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 explicitly prohibited Medicare from negotiating drug prices for nearly two decades, a provision that cost taxpayers an estimated $90 billion or more over that period.

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 represented the most significant drug pricing reform in a generation, authorizing Medicare to negotiate prices on a limited set of high-expenditure drugs, capping insulin copays at $35 per month for Medicare beneficiaries, and penalizing manufacturers who raise prices faster than inflation. However, the IRA's negotiation authority covers only 10 drugs in its first year (rising to 20 per year by 2029), applies only to Medicare (not commercial insurance), and excludes drugs in their first 9-13 years on the market. Comprehensive reform remains unfinished.

High drug prices have direct, measurable consequences for patient health. An estimated 29% of U.S. adults report not taking medications as prescribed due to cost, including skipping doses, cutting pills, or abandoning prescriptions entirely. This medication non-adherence contributes to an estimated 125,000 preventable deaths and $290 billion in avoidable healthcare costs annually. The burden falls disproportionately on the uninsured, the elderly, and communities of color.

## Scope

This analysis covers the key aspects of drug pricing policy:

- **Price Levels and International Comparisons**: How U.S. drug prices compare to other countries and what drives the differential
- **Patent and Exclusivity Practices**: Patent evergreening, pay-for-delay settlements, REMS abuse, and other tactics that delay generic and biosimilar competition
- **Medicare and Government Purchasing**: Medicare Part D, the IRA drug price negotiation program, Medicaid drug rebates, the 340B program, and VA/DoD purchasing
- **Pharmacy Benefit Managers and the Rebate System**: The role of PBMs in drug pricing, rebate flow, spread pricing, and transparency failures
- **Cost Transparency and Patient Burden**: Out-of-pocket costs, list price vs. net price dynamics, copay accumulator programs, and patient assistance
- **Generic and Biosimilar Competition**: Barriers to generic entry, biosimilar adoption rates, and policies to accelerate competition

## Core Tensions and Tradeoffs

- **Innovation vs. Affordability**: The pharmaceutical industry argues that high U.S. prices fund the research and development that produces new treatments. However, the 15 largest pharmaceutical companies spent more on stock buybacks and dividends ($747 billion, 2012-2021) than on R&D ($552 billion) over the same period. The tension is real but often overstated by industry lobbyists to block any price regulation.
- **Patent Protection vs. Market Competition**: Patents are essential to incentivize drug development, but the current system enables manufacturers to extend effective monopoly periods well beyond the intended 20-year patent term through evergreening strategies, sometimes blocking generics for 30+ years. Balancing innovation incentives with timely generic entry is a central policy challenge.
- **List Price vs. Net Price Transparency**: The gap between a drug's "list price" (what is published) and "net price" (what is actually paid after rebates and discounts) can exceed 50%. This opacity benefits PBMs and manufacturers while obscuring true costs from patients and policymakers.
- **Federal Authority vs. Market Freedom**: Government price negotiation is standard practice in every other developed country but has been fiercely opposed in the U.S. as an intrusion on free markets. The IRA's limited negotiation authority faces ongoing legal challenges from the pharmaceutical industry.
- **Medicare Coverage vs. Commercial Market**: The IRA's negotiation authority applies only to Medicare, leaving the 177 million Americans with employer-sponsored or individual insurance subject to unconstrained prices. This creates a two-tier system where the same drug can cost dramatically different amounts depending on the patient's coverage.

## Key Questions

1. How should the United States balance pharmaceutical innovation incentives with the need for affordable medications, and does the current pricing system actually maximize innovation?
2. Should Medicare's drug price negotiation authority be expanded to cover more drugs more quickly, and should negotiated prices extend to commercial insurance markets?
3. What reforms to the patent system, FDA approval process, and PBM regulation would most effectively increase competition and lower prices?
4. How can international reference pricing or drug importation be implemented while maintaining drug safety and supply chain integrity?

## Vision of Success

A successful drug pricing policy in the 21st century would feature:

- **Affordable Medications for All**: No American skips prescribed medications due to cost; out-of-pocket spending is capped at reasonable levels across all insurance types, and uninsured patients have access to fair prices
- **Robust Generic and Biosimilar Competition**: Generic drugs enter the market promptly after patent expiration, biosimilar adoption reaches 80%+ within 3 years of approval, and anti-competitive tactics like pay-for-delay are effectively prohibited
- **Transparent Pricing**: Drug prices reflect actual costs and value; the rebate system is reformed to pass savings directly to patients; PBM conflicts of interest are eliminated through structural reform
- **Sustainable Innovation**: Pharmaceutical R&D investment grows through targeted public funding and reformed incentive structures, while drug prices reflect therapeutic value rather than monopoly power
