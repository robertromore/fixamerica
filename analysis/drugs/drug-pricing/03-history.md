# Drug Pricing: History

## Historical Development

The high cost of prescription drugs in the United States is not an accident of market forces but the cumulative result of deliberate policy choices made over four decades. The history of U.S. drug pricing reflects a recurring pattern: Congress creates frameworks intended to balance innovation with affordability, and the pharmaceutical industry exploits, circumvents, or lobbies to weaken those frameworks. Each era has produced new tools for controlling prices -- and new strategies by industry to maintain pricing power.

### The Pre-Modern Era (Before 1984): Unregulated Markets

- **Limited Patent Exploitation**: Before the mid-1980s, the pharmaceutical market was smaller, drug development was less capital-intensive, and the modern strategies of patent evergreening did not yet exist. Most drugs were small-molecule chemicals with relatively short development cycles.
- **Government as Price Setter**: The federal government set prices for drugs purchased through the VA and military health systems. Medicare did not cover outpatient prescription drugs, so the question of government negotiation for a large civilian population had not yet arisen.
- **Early Generic Market**: The generic drug market was underdeveloped. Without a clear regulatory pathway for generic approvals, brand-name manufacturers faced limited competition even after patents expired, and generic drugs accounted for a small fraction of prescriptions.
- **Growing Research Enterprise**: The National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded basic biomedical research that laid the foundation for many blockbuster drugs, but the translation from basic research to commercial products was slower and less systematic than it would later become.

### The Hatch-Waxman Era (1984-2002): Balancing Innovation and Access

- **Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act (1984)**: The Hatch-Waxman Act created the modern framework for U.S. drug pricing by establishing two key mechanisms: (1) the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) process, which allowed generic manufacturers to gain FDA approval by demonstrating bioequivalence to brand-name drugs rather than repeating full clinical trials, and (2) patent term restoration, which compensated brand-name manufacturers for time lost during FDA review by extending effective patent life by up to 5 years.
- **Generic Drug Boom**: Hatch-Waxman catalyzed the growth of the generic drug industry. Generic utilization rose from approximately 19% of prescriptions in 1984 to over 47% by 2000. Generic drugs saved consumers an estimated $734 billion between 1984 and 2000 (Generic Pharmaceutical Association, 2002).
- **Paragraph IV Challenges**: The Act created a pathway for generic manufacturers to challenge brand-name patents before expiration (Paragraph IV certification), with a 180-day exclusivity incentive for the first generic filer. This mechanism was intended to promote generic entry but also created the conditions for pay-for-delay settlements.
- **Emergence of Pay-for-Delay**: Beginning in the late 1990s, brand-name manufacturers discovered they could pay generic companies to abandon or delay Paragraph IV challenges. The FTC documented the first major pay-for-delay settlement in 1999 (Hytrin/Abbott Laboratories). By the early 2000s, pay-for-delay had become a widespread industry strategy.
- **Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (1990)**: The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA 90) required drug manufacturers to provide rebates to Medicaid in exchange for Medicaid coverage. The program established the "best price" requirement -- manufacturers must offer Medicaid the lowest price available to any purchaser -- and created an inflation-based additional rebate for price increases exceeding CPI.
- **340B Program Established (1992)**: The Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 created the 340B Drug Pricing Program, requiring manufacturers participating in Medicaid to offer discounted outpatient drugs to safety-net providers. Initially limited to a narrow set of entities, the program would expand dramatically in subsequent decades.
- **Rise of Specialty Drugs**: The 1990s saw the emergence of high-cost biologic drugs, beginning with treatments like erythropoietin (Epogen/Procrit) for anemia and interferons for multiple sclerosis. These drugs cost thousands of dollars per month and created new affordability challenges that the Hatch-Waxman framework was not designed to address.

### The Medicare Part D Era (2003-2009): The Non-Negotiation Clause

- **Medicare Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA)**: The MMA established Medicare Part D, the first outpatient prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries, effective January 2006. The program was structured as a subsidy to private insurance plans rather than a direct government benefit, and -- critically -- Section 1860D-11(i) of the Social Security Act explicitly prohibited the Secretary of Health and Human Services from "interfering" with drug price negotiations between plans and manufacturers. This "non-interference clause" was the pharmaceutical industry's primary legislative achievement in exchange for its support of the bill.
- **Industry Lobbying**: PhRMA and individual drug companies spent an estimated $116 million on lobbying in 2003 to shape the MMA. Former Rep. Billy Tauzin (R-LA), who shepherded the bill through the House, became president of PhRMA in 2004 at a reported salary of $2 million per year, one of the most prominent examples of the pharmaceutical revolving door.
- **Coverage Gap ("Donut Hole")**: The original Part D design included a notorious "donut hole" in which beneficiaries paid 100% of drug costs between $2,250 and $5,100 in annual spending, creating a cliff that forced many seniors to choose between medications and other necessities.
- **Cost Overruns**: Medicare Part D cost significantly more than originally projected. The CBO initially estimated $395 billion over 10 years (2004-2013); actual spending exceeded $550 billion over that period. The absence of price negotiation authority was a primary cost driver.
- **International Comparison**: The MMA's non-interference clause made the U.S. the only major developed country in which the government purchaser of drugs for elderly citizens could not negotiate prices. The VA, by contrast, negotiated drug prices averaging 40% below Medicare Part D prices for the same medications (CBO, 2005).

### The ACA and Biologic Competition Era (2010-2021): Incremental Progress

- **Affordable Care Act (2010)**: The ACA included several drug pricing provisions: (1) phased closure of the Medicare Part D donut hole by 2020 through manufacturer discounts and federal subsidies; (2) creation of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA), establishing a regulatory pathway for biosimilar approval; (3) increased Medicaid drug rebates from 15.1% to 23.1% for brand-name drugs.
- **Biosimilar Pathway**: The BPCIA granted 12 years of market exclusivity to reference biologics before biosimilar competition could begin -- significantly longer than the 5 years of data exclusivity for small-molecule drugs. The first U.S. biosimilar (Zarxio, a biosimilar to Neupogen) was approved in 2015, nearly 6 years after the BPCIA was enacted. By contrast, Europe had approved its first biosimilar in 2006.
- **Price Increases as Business Strategy**: Between 2010 and 2020, average annual brand-name drug price increases exceeded inflation by 5-10 percentage points annually. Pharmaceutical manufacturers adopted a strategy of regular, above-inflation list price increases as a primary revenue growth mechanism, even for drugs with no new clinical evidence supporting higher prices.
- **High-Profile Price Shocks**: Public outrage over drug pricing surged following several highly publicized incidents:
    - **Sovaldi (2013)**: Gilead Sciences priced its hepatitis C cure at $84,000 for a 12-week course ($1,000 per pill), provoking a Senate investigation.
    - **Daraprim (2015)**: Martin Shkreli's Turing Pharmaceuticals acquired Daraprim and raised its price from $13.50 to $750 per tablet overnight (5,456% increase).
    - **EpiPen (2016)**: Mylan raised the price of the EpiPen auto-injector from $94 to $609 between 2007 and 2016, a 548% increase for a product containing approximately $1 of epinephrine.
    - **Insulin Pricing (2012-2019)**: The average annual cost of insulin tripled between 2012 and 2019, from approximately $3,000 to $9,600, despite the drug having been discovered in 1921 and production costs of approximately $2-$6 per vial.
- **Trump Administration Actions (2017-2020)**: President Trump signed several executive orders on drug pricing in 2020, including the Most Favored Nation (MFN) rule linking Medicare Part B drug prices to international prices. Most provisions were either blocked by courts or reversed by the Biden administration before taking effect. The administration's "Rebate Rule" -- which would have required PBM rebates to be passed through to patients at the point of sale -- was finalized but never implemented.
- **Congressional Stalemate**: Multiple bipartisan drug pricing bills advanced in Congress between 2019 and 2021, including the Elijah Cummings Lower Drug Costs Now Act (H.R. 3) and the bipartisan Senate Finance Committee bill (S. 2543, the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Act). None passed both chambers due to pharmaceutical industry lobbying and partisan disagreements over the scope of government intervention.

### The IRA Era (2022-Present): Breakthrough with Limitations

- **Inflation Reduction Act of 2022**: After decades of failed efforts, the IRA authorized Medicare drug price negotiation for the first time, along with the $35 insulin copay cap, inflation-based rebate penalties, and the $2,000 out-of-pocket cap. The legislation passed with zero Republican votes and through the budget reconciliation process, which limited its scope.
- **First Negotiation Cycle (2023-2024)**: CMS selected 10 high-expenditure Medicare drugs in August 2023 and announced negotiated prices in August 2024, with savings ranging from 38% to 79% off list prices. The first negotiated prices take effect in January 2026.
- **Industry Legal Challenges**: Pharmaceutical companies and trade groups filed nine federal lawsuits challenging the IRA's constitutionality. As of early 2025, all judicial rulings have upheld the law, with courts finding that manufacturers voluntarily participate in Medicare and can exit if they choose. Cases remain in various stages of appeal.
- **Voluntary Price Reductions**: In anticipation of the IRA and public scrutiny, several manufacturers announced voluntary price cuts. Eli Lilly, Novo Nordisk, and Sanofi all capped insulin list prices at $35 per vial for all patients (not just Medicare). Amgen reduced the list price of its Humira biosimilar.
- **Continued Gaps**: The IRA does not cover commercial insurance, addresses only a small fraction of drugs, and excludes drugs in their first 9-13 years on the market (small-molecule drugs are eligible 9 years after approval; biologics after 13 years). GLP-1 receptor agonists like Ozempic and Wegovy are not yet eligible for negotiation under the IRA timeline.

## Lessons from History

### Pattern 1: Industry Adaptation to Regulation

Every major drug pricing reform has been followed by pharmaceutical industry adaptation that erodes the reform's effectiveness. Hatch-Waxman created generic competition, and industry responded with pay-for-delay settlements and patent evergreening. The Medicaid rebate program tied discounts to "best price," and manufacturers responded by structuring rebates and discounts to circumvent the best-price calculation. The ACA created a biosimilar pathway, and manufacturers responded with patent thickets (Humira amassed 132 patents). This pattern suggests that any drug pricing reform must be designed with anti-circumvention provisions and must be updated regularly to close emerging loopholes.

### Pattern 2: The Non-Negotiation Clause as Cautionary Tale

The 2003 decision to prohibit Medicare from negotiating drug prices stands as one of the most consequential and costly lobbying victories in American legislative history. For nearly 20 years, the world's largest drug purchaser was barred from negotiating with its suppliers -- a provision that no other developed country has adopted and that cost American taxpayers tens of billions of dollars. The lesson is that structural provisions embedded in foundational legislation can be extraordinarily difficult to reverse, even when their costs are well-documented.

### Pattern 3: Public Outrage as Catalyst

Major drug pricing reforms have consistently been catalyzed by high-profile pricing controversies that generate public anger. The Sovaldi ($84,000), Daraprim (5,456% increase), and EpiPen (548% increase) controversies each generated Congressional hearings and legislative proposals. The insulin pricing crisis produced the IRA's $35 copay cap. History shows that sustained public pressure is necessary to overcome pharmaceutical industry lobbying, but that public attention is episodic and difficult to maintain.

### Pattern 4: Incrementalism vs. Comprehensive Reform

U.S. drug pricing reform has been overwhelmingly incremental -- addressing one drug, one program, or one market segment at a time. The IRA covers only Medicare, only a small number of drugs, and only after extended exclusivity periods. This incrementalism leaves the majority of the drug market unaddressed and allows industry to shift pricing pressure to uncovered segments. Countries that have achieved lower drug prices (Germany, UK, Japan, Australia) have done so through comprehensive, system-wide frameworks -- not piecemeal fixes.
