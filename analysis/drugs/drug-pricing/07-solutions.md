# Drug Pricing: Solutions

Drug pricing reform requires a multi-faceted approach that aims to lower prices for patients, increase market competition, ensure transparency throughout the pharmaceutical supply chain, and sustain innovation through reformed incentive structures.

---

## Reform Framework

### Guiding Principles

- Patients should never skip prescribed medications due to cost
- Drug prices should reflect therapeutic value, not monopoly power
- Generic and biosimilar competition should begin promptly after patent expiration, and anti-competitive tactics should be effectively prohibited
- The pharmaceutical supply chain (manufacturers, PBMs, insurers, pharmacies) should operate with full transparency
- Innovation incentives should be restructured to reward genuine therapeutic advances, not incremental modifications designed to extend monopolies
- Reforms should apply across all market segments (Medicare, commercial, uninsured), not just one program

### Theory of Change

The current system sustains high prices through three reinforcing mechanisms: prolonged monopolies (patent evergreening), absence of countervailing buyer power (limited negotiation authority), and supply chain opacity (PBM rebate system). Comprehensive reform must address all three simultaneously. Expanding government negotiation authority creates downward price pressure; patent reform accelerates generic and biosimilar competition; and PBM transparency reform ensures that savings reach patients. Together, these reforms shift the pharmaceutical market from one driven by monopoly pricing power to one driven by therapeutic value and competition.

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Expand Medicare Drug Price Negotiation

**Description**: Expand the IRA's Medicare drug price negotiation program to cover all drugs with annual Medicare spending exceeding $1 billion (approximately 50-100 drugs), eliminate the 9-year and 13-year exclusivity windows that delay negotiation eligibility, and extend negotiated prices to the commercial insurance market. Establish a permanent Drug Price Negotiation Board within CMS staffed by independent health economists, clinical pharmacologists, and patient representatives.

**Evidence Base**: The IRA's first negotiation cycle (2024) achieved savings of 38-79% on the 10 selected drugs, demonstrating that negotiation produces substantial price reductions without manufacturer withdrawal from Medicare. The VA negotiation model has achieved drug prices averaging 40% below Medicare Part D for decades (CBO, 2005). Every other major developed country uses some form of government price negotiation or regulation, and none has experienced the manufacturer market exit that industry predicts.

**Implementation**: Amend 42 U.S.C. Section 1395w-111 to remove the non-interference clause entirely. Establish the Drug Price Negotiation Board by statute with independence protections similar to the Federal Reserve Board. Require negotiations to use international reference pricing (see Solution 3) as a benchmark. Extend negotiated "maximum fair prices" to commercial insurance through a new section of the Public Health Service Act.

**Cost/Resources**: CBO estimated in 2019 that comprehensive Medicare negotiation would save $456 billion over 10 years. Extending to commercial markets could save an additional $200-$300 billion over 10 years. Administrative costs for an expanded negotiation program are estimated at $150-$250 million annually (based on comparable programs in Germany and the UK).

**Timeline**: Legislation in Year 1; first expanded negotiations in Year 2; commercial market extension by Year 3.

**Challenges**: Pharmaceutical industry opposition and legal challenges; potential need for 60 Senate votes; CBO scoring of innovation effects; implementation complexity for commercial market extension.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of drugs negotiated; average price reduction; reduction in Medicare spending; reduction in commercial premiums; reduction in patient out-of-pocket costs; medication adherence rates.

### Solution 2: End Patent Evergreening and Pay-for-Delay

**Description**: Enact comprehensive patent reform to close the loopholes that enable manufacturers to extend effective monopoly periods beyond their intended terms. Prohibit pay-for-delay settlements outright (rather than applying the difficult "rule of reason" antitrust standard). Limit the number of patents that can be listed in the FDA Orange Book for a single drug product. Establish a "use it or lose it" provision requiring that secondary patents be actively practiced to remain valid.

**Evidence Base**: I-MAK found that the top 12 grossing U.S. drugs had an average of 74 patents each, with claimed protection averaging 38 years. The FTC estimated that pay-for-delay settlements cost consumers $3.5 billion annually. The CREATES Act (2019) addressed REMS abuse but did not address patent thickets or pay-for-delay. European countries that have implemented patent linkage reforms have seen faster generic entry without reducing innovation.

**Implementation**: Amend the Hatch-Waxman Act to (1) limit Orange Book patent listings to composition-of-matter and method-of-use patents that are directly relevant to the approved product; (2) prohibit reverse payment settlements in ANDA litigation, with a safe harbor for de minimis consideration; (3) require the USPTO to apply heightened scrutiny to pharmaceutical secondary patents; (4) create an expedited inter partes review (IPR) process for pharmaceutical patents challenged by generic applicants.

**Cost/Resources**: Minimal direct government cost. CBO and FTC have estimated that comprehensive patent reform could save consumers $8-$15 billion annually through earlier generic entry.

**Timeline**: Legislation in Year 1; USPTO rulemaking in Year 2; full effect on new patent filings by Year 3; impact on existing drugs as current patents are challenged.

**Challenges**: IP attorney and pharmaceutical industry opposition; constitutional constraints on retroactive patent invalidation; international treaty obligations (TRIPS Agreement); complexity of patent law reform.

**Impact Metrics**: Average time from brand-name approval to generic entry; number of pay-for-delay settlements; number of Orange Book patent listings per drug; generic drug market share growth rate.

### Solution 3: International Reference Pricing

**Description**: Establish an international reference pricing (IRP) system that benchmarks U.S. drug prices against a basket of comparable high-income countries. Set the maximum allowable U.S. price for brand-name drugs at no more than 120% of the median price in the reference basket (Canada, UK, Germany, France, Japan, Australia). Apply IRP to both Medicare and commercial markets.

**Evidence Base**: The RAND Corporation estimated in 2021 that applying international reference pricing to the U.S. would reduce brand-name drug spending by 52-85%, depending on the reference basket. Thirty-three OECD countries use some form of reference pricing. Germany's AMNOG system, which benchmarks prices against comparator drugs and international prices, has reduced drug spending growth without reducing access to new drugs.

**Implementation**: CMS would establish a Price Reference Unit to collect and verify international drug prices from reference countries. Maximum allowable prices would apply to all payers (Medicare, Medicaid, commercial insurance, uninsured). Manufacturers that exceed the maximum price would face penalties (excise tax or loss of patent enforcement rights). Phase in over 3 years to allow market adjustment.

**Cost/Resources**: Administrative costs of $200-$400 million annually for international price collection and verification. Savings estimated at $80-$150 billion annually (based on RAND modeling).

**Timeline**: Legislation in Year 1; reference price database established in Year 2; IRP phase-in begins Year 3; full implementation by Year 5.

**Challenges**: International data collection complexity; manufacturer threats of delayed U.S. launches (though empirical evidence from other IRP countries shows minimal launch delay); trade policy implications; defining the reference basket.

**Impact Metrics**: U.S. brand-name drug prices relative to reference basket; new drug launch timing; patient out-of-pocket costs; total drug spending as share of GDP.

### Solution 4: PBM Transparency and Structural Reform

**Description**: Require comprehensive transparency from PBMs, mandate that 100% of manufacturer rebates be passed through to patients at the point of sale, prohibit spread pricing in all government programs and commercial markets, and require PBMs to divest from owned specialty and mail-order pharmacies to eliminate self-dealing conflicts of interest.

**Evidence Base**: The FTC's July 2024 interim report found that the three largest PBMs mark up specialty drug prices by 30-60% at PBM-owned pharmacies, retain significant shares of manufacturer rebates, and use spread pricing to extract hidden margins. State-level PBM reforms in Arkansas, Ohio, and West Virginia have improved pharmacy reimbursement and transparency without increasing drug costs. The FTC identified vertical integration as a primary source of PBM conflicts of interest.

**Implementation**: Federal legislation requiring (1) fiduciary duty for PBMs acting on behalf of plan sponsors; (2) 100% rebate pass-through to patients at point of sale; (3) prohibition on spread pricing; (4) divestiture of PBM-owned pharmacies within 3 years; (5) annual public disclosure of all rebate, fee, and pricing arrangements. FTC enforcement authority with civil penalties.

**Cost/Resources**: Minimal direct government cost; potential savings of $20-$40 billion annually from reduced PBM margin extraction, based on FTC estimates and state-level reform outcomes.

**Timeline**: Legislation in Year 1; FTC rulemaking in Year 2; divestiture compliance by Year 4.

**Challenges**: PBM and insurer industry opposition; complexity of vertical integration divestiture; need to ensure plan sponsors can still access volume-based discounts; potential disruption to existing pharmacy networks.

**Impact Metrics**: Patient out-of-pocket costs at the pharmacy counter; PBM spread margins (target: zero); pharmacy reimbursement relative to acquisition cost; market concentration (HHI) in PBM industry.

### Solution 5: Safe Drug Importation

**Description**: Establish a comprehensive federal drug importation program allowing importation from Canada and other countries with FDA-recognized regulatory systems. Require track-and-trace verification for all imported drugs. Authorize personal importation for individual patients and commercial importation through licensed wholesalers.

**Evidence Base**: Canadian drug prices average 52% lower than U.S. prices for brand-name drugs (PMPRB, 2023). The Florida drug importation program, authorized by HHS in January 2024, is the first state-level implementation under existing federal authority. An estimated $8-$12 billion in annual savings is achievable from importation of the 50 most expensive brand-name drugs (Commonwealth Fund, 2023).

**Implementation**: Amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to authorize importation from countries with FDA-equivalent regulatory systems (Canada, UK, EU, Japan, Australia). Establish a verification system for imported drugs using existing FDA inspection infrastructure. License importation wholesalers subject to FDA oversight.

**Cost/Resources**: FDA inspection and verification costs estimated at $50-$100 million annually. Potential savings of $8-$12 billion annually for patients and payers.

**Timeline**: Legislation in Year 1; FDA rulemaking and wholesaler licensing in Year 2; importation begins in Year 3.

**Challenges**: Manufacturer supply restrictions (limiting exports to Canada to prevent re-importation); FDA implementation capacity; pharmaceutical industry lobbying against importation; ensuring adequate supply for source countries.

**Impact Metrics**: Volume of drugs imported; average price of imported vs. domestic drugs; patient cost savings; any adverse events from imported drugs (target: zero increase).

### Solution 6: Biosimilar Competition Acceleration

**Description**: Reduce the 12-year biologic exclusivity period to 7 years (aligned with European standards), require automatic substitution of interchangeable biosimilars at the pharmacy level (as with generics), prohibit "rebate wall" tactics by reference biologic manufacturers, and create a federal biosimilar education program for physicians and patients.

**Evidence Base**: European biosimilars achieve 60-85% market share within 3 years of launch, compared to 25-35% in the U.S. (IQVIA, 2024). The 12-year exclusivity period delays biosimilar competition far longer than the 5-year data exclusivity for small-molecule generics, despite comparable development timelines. Humira biosimilars captured only 14% of the U.S. market one year after launch, compared to 80%+ in Europe over a similar timeframe.

**Implementation**: Amend the BPCIA to reduce biologic exclusivity from 12 to 7 years. Require state pharmacy boards to allow automatic biosimilar substitution (or establish federal preemption of state substitution laws). Prohibit manufacturers from conditioning rebates on formulary exclusion of biosimilars. Fund a CMS biosimilar education campaign targeting physicians and patients.

**Cost/Resources**: CBO estimated that reducing biologic exclusivity from 12 to 7 years would save $6.6 billion over 10 years. Biosimilar education program: $50-$100 million annually.

**Timeline**: Legislation in Year 1; state substitution reforms in Years 2-3; biosimilar education program launch in Year 2.

**Challenges**: Biologic manufacturer opposition; state legislative complexity for substitution laws; physician and patient hesitancy about biosimilar quality; need for FDA guidance on interchangeability.

**Impact Metrics**: Biosimilar market share (target: 60%+ within 3 years of launch); average biosimilar discount vs. reference biologic; number of biosimilars approved and marketed; biologic drug spending growth rate.

### Solution 7: Out-of-Pocket Cost Caps Across All Markets

**Description**: Extend the IRA's $35/month insulin copay cap and $2,000 annual out-of-pocket cap to all insurance markets (employer-sponsored, individual market, Medicaid). Prohibit copay accumulator programs that prevent patient assistance from counting toward deductibles. Establish a federal patient assistance program for uninsured patients.

**Evidence Base**: The IRA's insulin copay cap reduced Medicare beneficiaries' average insulin out-of-pocket costs by 66% (from $104 to $35 per month). Prior to the IRA, 1.3 million Medicare beneficiaries had annual out-of-pocket drug costs exceeding $2,000 (KFF, 2023). An estimated 14 million Americans with employer insurance face insulin costs above $35/month.

**Implementation**: Federal legislation extending IRA out-of-pocket protections to all markets, with the Department of Labor and HHS enforcing compliance for employer and individual plans. Establish a federal pharmaceutical assistance program (modeled on state programs like New Jersey PAAD) for uninsured patients with incomes below 400% FPL.

**Cost/Resources**: Federal cost of commercial market mandates: $5-$10 billion annually (partially offset by improved adherence reducing downstream healthcare costs). Uninsured assistance program: $3-$5 billion annually.

**Timeline**: Legislation in Year 1; commercial market implementation in Year 2; uninsured assistance program in Year 3.

**Challenges**: Employer opposition to new mandates; ERISA preemption issues for self-insured plans; cost of uninsured assistance program; industry concern about moral hazard.

**Impact Metrics**: Medication non-adherence rate (target: reduce from 29% to 15%); share of Americans with annual OOP drug costs above $2,000; insulin affordability for non-Medicare populations; preventable hospitalizations from non-adherence.

## International Models

### Germany: AMNOG (Act on the Reform of the Market for Medicinal Products)

**Description**: Since 2011, Germany's AMNOG system requires manufacturers to demonstrate the "added therapeutic benefit" of new drugs compared to existing treatments within one year of launch. An independent body (IQWiG) evaluates the evidence, and prices are then negotiated based on the assessed benefit level. Drugs with no added benefit are priced at the level of existing comparators.

**Results**: AMNOG saved the German statutory health insurance system an estimated 9.9 billion euros between 2011 and 2023. Drug spending growth slowed from 5.2% annually (2005-2010) to 2.8% annually (2011-2023) (GKV-Spitzenverband, 2024). Germany continues to have among the fastest new drug launch times in Europe, with manufacturers launching 90%+ of new drugs within 3 months of EMA approval.

**Applicability to U.S.**: The AMNOG model of value-based pricing could be adapted through the proposed Drug Price Negotiation Board. Key adaptations needed: establishing an independent U.S. health technology assessment body (comparable to IQWiG), applying the model across all payers (not just one insurer), and addressing the larger U.S. market size.

### UK: NICE and Voluntary Pricing and Access Scheme (VPAS)

**Description**: The UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) evaluates the cost-effectiveness of new drugs using Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). The Voluntary Pricing and Access Scheme (VPAS) caps total NHS branded drug spending growth at 2% annually, with manufacturers paying rebates if growth exceeds the cap.

**Results**: UK drug prices are approximately 66% lower than U.S. prices for brand-name drugs (RAND, 2024). NICE's cost-effectiveness threshold (typically 20,000-30,000 pounds per QALY) ensures that NHS spending is directed toward drugs with demonstrated value. UK per capita drug spending is approximately 40% of U.S. levels.

**Applicability to U.S.**: NICE's cost-effectiveness methodology could inform U.S. value-based pricing. The VPAS model of total spending caps could be adapted for Medicare or a broader U.S. system. Key challenge: the U.S. has no institutional equivalent to NICE, and QALY-based evaluations face political opposition from some patient groups and disability advocates who view them as devaluing certain lives.

### Japan: National Health Insurance Drug Pricing System

**Description**: Japan sets drug prices through a centralized committee that evaluates new drugs using international reference pricing, cost-effectiveness analysis, and therapeutic category comparisons. Prices are automatically revised downward every two years (reduced from every three years in 2021) and face additional reductions when sales exceed forecasts.

**Results**: Japan's drug prices are approximately 58% lower than U.S. prices (RAND, 2024). The automatic biennial price reduction system ensures that drug prices decline over time as evidence accumulates. Japan ranks second globally in pharmaceutical R&D spending per capita, demonstrating that price regulation is compatible with innovation.

**Applicability to U.S.**: Japan's automatic price revision system could inform U.S. post-launch pricing policy. The principle that drug prices should decline as sales exceed forecasts directly addresses the U.S. problem of prices increasing after launch rather than declining.

## Pilot Programs and Demonstrations

- **Florida Drug Importation Program**: Authorized by HHS in January 2024 under Section 804 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, Florida's program is the first state-level drug importation initiative. The program requires extensive safety verification and is expected to cover select expensive brand-name drugs. Results will inform federal importation policy.
- **CMS Part D Senior Savings Model**: A voluntary Medicare Part D model that capped insulin copays at $35/month in 2020, two years before the IRA made the cap mandatory. Enrollment reached 3.3 million beneficiaries and reduced average insulin costs by 66%. This pilot directly informed the IRA's insulin copay cap.
- **State Prescription Drug Affordability Boards**: Colorado, Maryland, Oregon, and Washington have established boards with authority to set upper payment limits on expensive drugs. These state-level experiments will generate evidence on the feasibility and impact of price-setting at the state level.
