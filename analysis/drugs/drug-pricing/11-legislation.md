# Drug Pricing: Legislation

## Overview

Drug pricing reform requires a multi-pronged legislative strategy that addresses the structural causes of high U.S. drug prices. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (P.L. 117-169) provided a foundation, but comprehensive reform demands legislation in four additional areas: (1) expansion of Medicare price negotiation to cover more drugs across all markets, (2) patent reform to end evergreening and pay-for-delay, (3) PBM transparency and structural reform, and (4) safe drug importation authorization. This legislative package is designed to work as a complementary system -- negotiation reduces prices for existing monopoly drugs; patent reform accelerates generic competition; PBM reform ensures savings reach patients; and importation provides an additional competitive pressure.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for drug pricing reform.* Federal authority to regulate pharmaceutical pricing rests on well-established constitutional foundations: the Commerce Clause (regulating interstate pharmaceutical commerce), the Spending Clause (conditioning Medicare/Medicaid participation on pricing terms), the Tax Clause (excise taxes on non-compliant manufacturers), and the Necessary and Proper Clause. Federal courts have consistently upheld the IRA's negotiation provisions under these authorities.

## Federal Legislation

### The Comprehensive Drug Pricing Reform Act

**Purpose**: Expand Medicare drug price negotiation to cover all high-expenditure drugs, extend negotiated prices to commercial insurance markets, and establish an independent Drug Price Negotiation Board to conduct evidence-based negotiations.

**Key Provisions**:

1. Expand Medicare negotiation to all drugs with annual spending exceeding $500 million
2. Eliminate the 9-year and 13-year exclusivity windows that delay negotiation eligibility
3. Extend Medicare-negotiated "maximum fair prices" to the commercial insurance market
4. Establish an independent Drug Price Negotiation Board within CMS
5. Require international reference pricing as a negotiation benchmark

**Draft Text**:

119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To expand Medicare drug price negotiation authority, extend negotiated
prices to all Americans, and establish an independent Drug Price
Negotiation Board.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Comprehensive Drug Pricing Reform
Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) According to the RAND Corporation (2024), U.S. brand-name
drug prices are 2.78 times the average of comparable OECD nations.

(2) According to the Kaiser Family Foundation (2024), 29 percent
of U.S. adults (approximately 83 million people) report not taking
medications as prescribed due to cost.

(3) Medication non-adherence due to cost contributes to an
estimated 125,000 preventable deaths annually (NCPA/IMS Health, 2023).

(4) The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 authorized Medicare to
negotiate prices for 10 drugs in its first year, but more than 250
brand-name drugs have annual U.S. spending exceeding $500 million.

(5) The first cycle of Medicare drug price negotiations (2024)
achieved price reductions of 38 to 79 percent, demonstrating that
negotiation produces substantial savings.

(6) The IRA's negotiation authority does not extend to commercial
insurance markets, which cover approximately 177 million Americans.

(7) Every other major developed nation uses some form of
government drug price negotiation or regulation, and none has
experienced significant manufacturer market withdrawal.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:

(1) BOARD.—The term "Board" means the Drug Price Negotiation
Board established under section 5 of this Act.

(2) COVERED DRUG.—The term "covered drug" means any drug or
biological product approved by the Food and Drug Administration
with total annual U.S. spending (across all payers) exceeding
$500,000,000, as determined by the Secretary.

(3) MAXIMUM FAIR PRICE.—The term "maximum fair price" means the
price negotiated by the Board under section 6 of this Act, which
shall apply to all payers.

(4) REFERENCE BASKET.—The term "reference basket" means the group
of nations specified in section 7 whose drug prices serve as
benchmarks for negotiation.

(5) SECRETARY.—The term "Secretary" means the Secretary of Health
and Human Services.

SEC. 4. EXPANSION OF MEDICARE DRUG PRICE NEGOTIATION.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 1191 of the Social Security Act
(42 U.S.C. 1320e) is amended to—
    (1) remove the numerical limitation on the number of drugs
    subject to negotiation in any calendar year;
    (2) require the Secretary to select all covered drugs (as
    defined in section 3) for negotiation; and
    (3) eliminate the small molecule exclusivity period under
    section 1192(d)(1)(A) and the biologic exclusivity period under
    section 1192(d)(1)(B), replacing both with a uniform 5-year
    post-approval eligibility window.

    (5) $250,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.

Except as otherwise provided, this Act shall take effect on the
date that is 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4 (Expansion)**: Removes the IRA's numerical cap on drugs eligible for negotiation and its 9-year/13-year exclusivity windows, replacing them with universal eligibility for drugs with > $500 million in annual spending after 5 years post-approval. Extends maximum fair prices to all payers, closing the gap between Medicare and commercial markets.
- **Section 5 (Board)**: Creates an independent board with staggered terms and conflict-of-interest protections, insulated from pharmaceutical industry influence and political interference.
- **Section 6 (Methodology)**: Establishes evidence-based negotiation criteria including international reference pricing, clinical effectiveness, and manufacturer R&D costs. The 120% ceiling on reference basket median prevents extreme U.S. premiums while allowing prices above international averages.
- **Section 7 (IRP)**: Creates the international reference basket and data collection infrastructure needed for evidence-based negotiation.
- **Section 9 (Appropriations)**: Funds Board operations and IRP infrastructure. CBO estimates total savings of $400-$600 billion over 10 years, dwarfing implementation costs.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Board members appointed | 120 days after enactment | HHS Secretary |
| International reference pricing database operational | 365 days after enactment | CMS |
| First expanded negotiation cycle begins | 18 months after enactment | Board |
| Maximum fair prices effective for first expanded cohort | January 1, Year 3 | Board/CMS |
| Extension to commercial markets effective | January 1, Year 3 | DOL/HHS |

**Regulatory Authority**: CMS administers the negotiation program and IRP database. DOL enforces commercial market compliance for employer-sponsored plans. HHS enforces compliance for individual market plans.

**Challenges**:

- **Pharmaceutical industry opposition**: Nine lawsuits have already challenged the IRA's more limited negotiation authority; expanded negotiation will face additional legal challenges.
- **Senate filibuster**: Without 60 Senate votes, this legislation may need to be structured as a budget reconciliation bill (limited to fiscal provisions).
- **CBO scoring**: CBO's methodology for estimating innovation effects of price regulation is contested and could produce a higher cost estimate than warranted.

**Refinements**:

- **Innovation safe harbor**: Provide extended exclusivity (additional 2 years) for drugs that represent genuine first-in-class therapeutic advances, as determined by the FDA
- **Small biotech carve-out**: For drugs developed entirely by companies with fewer than 500 employees and annual revenue below $1 billion, apply a higher price ceiling (150% of reference basket median) for the first 3 years after approval

Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(b)(1)) is
amended to provide that the only patents eligible for listing in the
Orange Book with respect to an approved drug shall be—
    (1) patents claiming the active pharmaceutical ingredient
    (composition of matter); and
    (2) patents claiming a method of using the drug for the
    approved indication, provided that such method-of-use patent
    is not directed solely to a method of administration,
    formulation, dosage form, or manufacturing process.

(b) DELISTING OF INELIGIBLE PATENTS.—Not later than 180 days
after the date of enactment of this Act, the Commissioner of Food
and Drugs shall delist from the Orange Book all patents that do not
meet the criteria established in subsection (a).

(c) PENALTY FOR IMPROPER LISTING.—Any applicant that lists a
patent in the Orange Book that does not meet the criteria of
subsection (a) shall be subject to a civil monetary penalty of not
more than $10,000,000 per patent improperly listed.

SEC. 3. PROHIBITION ON PAY-FOR-DELAY SETTLEMENTS.

(a) IN GENERAL.—It shall be unlawful for any person, in
connection with the settlement of a patent infringement claim
involving a pharmaceutical product, to—
    (1) provide any consideration (monetary or non-monetary) to a
    generic or biosimilar applicant in exchange for delaying the
    applicant's entry into the market; or
    (2) agree to any provision that restricts the timing of a
    generic or biosimilar applicant's market entry, except as
    provided in subsection (b).

(b) SAFE HARBOR.—Subsection (a) shall not apply to—
    (1) a settlement that permits generic entry no later than
    the date that is 180 days after the settlement date; or
    (2) consideration consisting solely of the right to market
    an authorized generic of the brand-name product.

(c) ENFORCEMENT.—
    (1) FTC ENFORCEMENT.—The Federal Trade Commission shall have
    authority to enforce this section under section 5 of the
    Federal Trade Commission Act.
    (2) PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.—Any person or entity that pays
    a higher price for a pharmaceutical product as a result of a
    violation of this section may bring a civil action for treble
    damages and reasonable attorney's fees.

SEC. 4. STRENGTHENING GENERIC ACCESS TO REMS-RESTRICTED DRUGS.

(a) AMENDMENTS TO CREATES ACT.—The CREATES Act (21 U.S.C.
355-2) is amended to—
    (1) reduce the timeline for generic manufacturers to file
    civil actions for sample access from 150 days to 60 days after
    an initial request;
    (2) provide for expedited judicial review of sample access
    claims; and
    (3) authorize the FDA to require brand-name manufacturers to
    provide a single, shared REMS that facilitates generic access.

SEC. 5. EXPEDITED PHARMACEUTICAL PATENT REVIEW.

(a) PHARMACEUTICAL IPR.—The Director of the United States Patent
and Trademark Office shall establish an expedited inter partes review
(IPR) track for pharmaceutical patents, with—
    (1) institution decisions within 60 days of petition;
    (2) final written decisions within 9 months of institution;
    (3) priority scheduling for patents listed in the Orange Book.

There are authorized to be appropriated—
    (1) $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2027 for FTC enforcement;
    (2) $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2027 for USPTO expedited review;
    (3) $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2027 for FDA implementation.

SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date that is 90 days after the
date of enactment of this Act.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 2 (Orange Book Reform)**: Limits patentable claims that can block generic entry to genuine composition-of-matter and method-of-use patents, eliminating the ability to list dozens of formulation, device, and process patents that create "patent thickets."
- **Section 3 (Pay-for-Delay Ban)**: Creates a bright-line prohibition with a safe harbor for settlements that permit generic entry within 180 days, avoiding the difficult rule-of-reason analysis under *FTC v. Actavis*.
- **Section 5 (Expedited IPR)**: Accelerates the patent challenge process to prevent years-long litigation delays.

## State Model Legislation

### Model State Drug Price Transparency and Affordability Act

**Purpose**: Establish a state-level prescription drug affordability board with authority to set upper payment limits on expensive drugs sold within the state, and require drug price transparency from manufacturers.

**Adaptability Notes**: States should customize the spending threshold and board composition based on state population size, Medicaid enrollment, and existing regulatory infrastructure. States with existing PBM regulations should integrate rather than duplicate oversight. The model is designed for states where federal reform has not yet addressed commercial market pricing.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "[State]
Prescription Drug Affordability Act of [Year]".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS.

The [State] Legislature finds that:

(1) Prescription drug spending in [State] exceeds $[X] billion
annually, and per capita drug spending has increased [X]% over
the past 5 years.

(2) [X]% of [State] residents report not taking medications as
prescribed due to cost.

(3) [State] Medicaid program spending on prescription drugs was
$[X] billion in fiscal year [Year], consuming [X]% of the
Medicaid budget.

SECTION 3. PRESCRIPTION DRUG AFFORDABILITY BOARD.

(a) There is established the [State] Prescription Drug
Affordability Board, consisting of 5 members appointed by the
Governor with the advice and consent of the [Senate/Legislature].

(b) The Board shall have authority to—
    (1) conduct affordability reviews of drugs with annual
    spending exceeding $[threshold] in [State];
    (2) set upper payment limits for drugs determined to create
    affordability challenges; and
    (3) require manufacturers to submit cost and pricing
    justifications for reviewed drugs.

SECTION 4. MANUFACTURER TRANSPARENCY.

(a) Any manufacturer that increases the wholesale acquisition
cost of a drug by more than 10% in a single calendar year, or by
more than the Consumer Price Index increase over any 2-year period,
shall submit to the Board a report including—
    (1) the specific factors contributing to the price increase;
    (2) research and development costs for the drug;
    (3) marketing and advertising expenditures; and
    (4) net profit attributable to the drug.

SECTION 5. UPPER PAYMENT LIMITS.

(a) When the Board determines that a drug's price creates an
affordability challenge, the Board may set an upper payment limit
applicable to—
    (1) state-regulated health insurance plans;
    (2) the state Medicaid program; and
    (3) state employee health plans.

(b) Upper payment limits shall take into account—
    (1) the drug's cost in other states and countries;
    (2) the drug's clinical effectiveness relative to alternatives;
    (3) the impact on patient access; and
    (4) the manufacturer's cost of production and R&D investment.

SECTION 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on [date].
```

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: CMS (Drug Price Negotiation Board), FTC (PBM oversight), FDA (patent and generic approval reforms)

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **CMS Negotiation Rules**: Procedures for drug selection, negotiation methodology, international reference pricing data collection, and maximum fair price determination (statutory deadline: 180 days after enactment)
2. **FTC PBM Rules**: Rebate pass-through requirements, spread pricing prohibition, divestiture procedures, and reporting obligations (statutory deadline: 180 days after enactment)
3. **FDA Orange Book Rules**: Revised patent listing criteria, delisting procedures, and penalties for improper listing (statutory deadline: 180 days after enactment)
4. **USPTO IPR Rules**: Expedited pharmaceutical patent review procedures (statutory deadline: 90 days after enactment)

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Civil Penalties**: Up to $10 million per improperly listed patent (FDA); up to $1 million per PBM violation (FTC); civil monetary penalties for manufacturers violating maximum fair prices (CMS)
- **Excise Tax**: 95% excise tax on U.S. revenue of any covered drug sold above the maximum fair price
- **Private Right of Action**: Treble damages for persons harmed by pay-for-delay settlements; state attorney general enforcement for PBM violations
- **Administrative Actions**: Medicare/Medicaid exclusion for manufacturers that refuse to participate in negotiation; FTC consent decrees for PBM violations

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Commerce Clause Authority**: Congress has broad authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate the pharmaceutical industry, which is fundamentally interstate in nature. Drug manufacturing, distribution, and sales cross state lines, and the pharmaceutical market is a national market. The Supreme Court has consistently upheld federal regulation of the pharmaceutical industry under the Commerce Clause.

**Spending Clause Authority**: The IRA's negotiation program is structured as a condition of Medicare participation under the Spending Clause. The Comprehensive Drug Pricing Reform Act extends this model. Federal courts have upheld the IRA against Spending Clause challenges, finding that manufacturer participation in Medicare is voluntary and that the government may set conditions on its spending programs (see *Bristol-Myers Squibb v. Becerra*, D.D.C. 2024).

**Takings Clause Concerns**: The pharmaceutical industry has argued that compelled price reductions constitute a taking of property without just compensation. Federal courts have rejected this argument, finding that (1) manufacturers have no property right to sell drugs at any particular price; (2) the maximum fair price allows manufacturers to remain profitable; and (3) participation in government programs is voluntary.

**First Amendment Concerns**: Industry challenges to the IRA's requirement that manufacturers "agree" to negotiated prices have been rejected, with courts finding that the requirement to offer drugs at a specified price is commercial conduct, not compelled speech.

### Preemption

The Comprehensive Drug Pricing Reform Act includes a savings clause preserving state authority to enact additional drug pricing protections (e.g., state affordability boards, transparency laws). Federal maximum fair prices serve as a ceiling, not a floor -- states may set lower upper payment limits for state-regulated plans. PBM provisions expressly preempt conflicting state laws to ensure uniform national standards.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance is ensured through a combination of civil monetary penalties, excise taxes, private rights of action, and program exclusion. The 95% excise tax on non-compliant manufacturer revenue is designed to be economically prohibitive, ensuring compliance without requiring criminal enforcement. FTC enforcement of PBM provisions follows established Section 5 procedures. State attorney general enforcement provides an additional enforcement layer.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| Manufacturer withdrawal from Medicare | Manufacturers could theoretically withdraw from Medicare to avoid negotiated prices, though no manufacturer has done so | Low (withdrawal would forfeit ~36% of U.S. revenue) | If a manufacturer withdraws from Medicare, authorize CMS to issue a compulsory license under 28 U.S.C. Section 1498 for the drug |
| International price manipulation | Manufacturers could raise prices in reference basket countries to increase the U.S. ceiling | Medium | Weight reference basket prices using a 3-year rolling average; exclude prices above the 75th percentile; add emerging market countries to the basket |
| Product hopping before negotiation | Manufacturers could reformulate drugs and launch "new" versions to restart the 5-year eligibility clock | High | Define "covered drug" to include all formulations and dosage forms of the same active ingredient; treat reformulations as the same drug for negotiation eligibility |
| PBM reconstitution after divestiture | Divested PBMs could create new affiliated entities that replicate self-dealing | Medium | Define "affiliate" broadly to include any entity with shared ownership, management, or revenue-sharing; FTC monitoring for 10 years post-divestiture |
| Pay-for-delay evasion through non-cash consideration | Manufacturers could structure patent settlements to provide non-cash value (co-promotion rights, supply agreements) that delays generic entry without cash payments | High | The draft bill prohibits "any consideration (monetary or non-monetary)" and includes a private right of action for affected parties |
| Offshore pricing arbitrage | Manufacturers could shift pricing to offshore subsidiaries to circumvent U.S. price regulations | Medium | Apply maximum fair price to all sales of a covered drug within the United States regardless of the seller's domicile; cross-reference with customs data |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| $500 million spending threshold excludes many expensive drugs | Patients taking drugs below the threshold still face high prices | Political compromise to limit negotiation scope | Phase in lower thresholds (e.g., $100 million) in subsequent legislation |
| 5-year post-approval eligibility delay | New drugs remain at unregulated prices for 5 years after approval | Balance between innovation incentives and price regulation | Apply IRP ceiling (120% of reference basket) during the 5-year window even without formal negotiation |
| Commercial market extension depends on ERISA preemption | Self-insured employer plans (covering ~60% of employer market) may challenge federal price mandates | ERISA's broad preemption of state regulation of employee benefit plans | Structure federal price mandate as a Public Health Service Act requirement that preempts ERISA, or use Tax Code provisions |
| PBM divestiture may reduce bargaining leverage | Separated PBMs may negotiate less effectively with manufacturers | Vertical integration provides some efficiencies alongside its conflicts of interest | Compensate by strengthening government negotiation; allow PBMs to negotiate collectively through a clearinghouse |
| Gene therapy pricing not well-addressed | One-time therapies costing $1-$3.5 million present unique pricing challenges not captured by annual spending thresholds | Novel payment model needed for one-time cures | Establish separate payment frameworks for gene therapies (outcomes-based contracts, installment payments) |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Anti-Product-Hopping Amendment**: Add statutory language defining "covered drug" to encompass all formulations, dosage forms, and combination products containing the same active pharmaceutical ingredient, with eligibility dates based on the first FDA approval of any product containing that ingredient.
2. **Reference Price Anti-Manipulation Rule**: Require CMS to calculate reference basket prices using a 3-year rolling average and to disregard price increases in reference countries that exceed 10% in a single year, treating such increases as potential manipulation.
3. **ERISA Preemption Fix**: Structure the commercial market maximum fair price as a federal floor-price requirement under the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. Section 300gg series), which has been upheld as preempting ERISA for health insurance market reforms. Alternatively, impose the requirement through the Tax Code (deny tax deductions for drug purchases above the maximum fair price).
4. **Gene Therapy Framework**: Within 2 years of enactment, require CMS to establish a value-based payment framework for gene and cell therapies that spreads costs over the expected therapeutic benefit period (5-10 years) and includes outcomes-based refund provisions if the therapy fails.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

The Drug Price Negotiation Board's authority should be reauthorized every 10 years, with a mandatory GAO evaluation at Year 5 and Year 9 examining: (1) price reductions achieved, (2) impact on new drug approvals (innovation metric), (3) patient access and affordability improvements, (4) manufacturer compliance and enforcement actions, and (5) international reference pricing accuracy and reliability. The Board's authority should continue unless Congress affirmatively votes to discontinue it (reverse sunset).
