# Drug Pricing: Root Causes

## Systemic Analysis

The current challenges in U.S. drug pricing are not the result of a single failure but of several long-term, interlocking structural features of the American pharmaceutical market. These include the absence of comprehensive government price negotiation, an expansive patent and exclusivity system that enables prolonged monopolies, a concentrated and opaque pharmacy benefit manager industry, regulatory capture of key government agencies, and the unique political economy of pharmaceutical lobbying. Together, these factors create a system in which drug prices are set primarily by manufacturer pricing power rather than by competition, clinical value, or patient affordability.

## Absence of Price Regulation

### No Comprehensive Price-Setting Authority

The United States is the only major developed country that does not have a government body responsible for evaluating drug prices and setting or negotiating reimbursement rates. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) evaluates the cost-effectiveness of new drugs and sets maximum NHS reimbursement prices. Germany's Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) assesses the added therapeutic benefit of new drugs and negotiates prices with manufacturers. Australia's Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC) recommends drugs for government subsidy based on clinical and cost-effectiveness evidence. Japan's Central Social Insurance Medical Council sets drug prices within a comprehensive national framework.

In the U.S., the closest analog is the IRA's Medicare negotiation program, which covers only 10-20 drugs per year and only for Medicare beneficiaries. For the commercial market -- which covers 177 million Americans with employer-sponsored or individual insurance -- there is no government price-setting authority. Prices are set unilaterally by manufacturers and then subject to opaque negotiations between manufacturers, PBMs, and insurers.

**Evidence**: The RAND Corporation found in 2024 that U.S. brand-name drug prices are 2.78 times higher than the OECD average, with the gap widest for drugs with no therapeutic alternatives. Countries with formal price evaluation systems consistently achieve lower prices without demonstrable harm to their citizens' access to new therapies.

### The Medicare Non-Interference Clause Legacy

Although the IRA partially reversed the 2003 Medicare Modernization Act's prohibition on government negotiation, the legacy of nearly 20 years without negotiation authority established manufacturer expectations of unconstrained pricing for the Medicare population. The IRA's negotiation program is phased in slowly (10 drugs in 2026, rising to 20 per year by 2029) and excludes drugs in their first 9 years (small-molecule) or 13 years (biologics) on the market -- precisely the period when drugs command the highest prices and face no generic or biosimilar competition.

**Evidence**: CBO estimated in 2019 that allowing Medicare to negotiate all Part D drug prices would save $456 billion over 10 years. The IRA's limited program is projected to save $237 billion over 10 years -- significant but roughly half of what comprehensive negotiation could achieve.

## Patent System Abuse

### Patent Evergreening

The U.S. patent system grants 20-year patents to genuinely novel inventions, which for pharmaceuticals translates to an effective monopoly period during which no generic or biosimilar competition is possible. In practice, brand-name manufacturers systematically extend their effective monopoly periods far beyond 20 years through "evergreening" -- filing secondary patents on minor modifications to existing drugs, including new formulations, dosing regimens, delivery devices, methods of use, and manufacturing processes.

A single drug can be protected by dozens or even hundreds of patents, each filed at different times, creating a "patent thicket" that generic manufacturers must navigate. The Initiative for Medicines, Access and Knowledge (I-MAK) found that the top 12 grossing drugs in the U.S. had an average of 74 patents each, with claimed patent protection extending an average of 38 years -- nearly double the statutory 20-year term.

**Evidence**: AbbVie's Humira (adalimumab) accumulated 132 patents, enabling the company to block biosimilar competition in the U.S. until 2023 despite the drug's key composition patent expiring in 2016. During this extended monopoly period, AbbVie raised Humira's price from $19,000 per year (2012) to $84,000 per year (2022), generating over $200 billion in U.S. revenue.

### Pay-for-Delay Settlements

Pay-for-delay (also known as "reverse payment") settlements occur when brand-name manufacturers pay generic companies to settle patent challenges and delay their entry into the market. The FTC has documented hundreds of such settlements, estimating they cost U.S. consumers $3.5 billion per year in higher drug costs.

In *FTC v. Actavis* (2013), the Supreme Court ruled that pay-for-delay settlements can violate antitrust law, but the "rule of reason" standard adopted by the Court makes enforcement difficult. Manufacturers have adapted by structuring settlements to include non-cash consideration (e.g., authorized generic licenses, co-promotion agreements) that are harder to challenge.

**Evidence**: The FTC reported 140 pay-for-delay-type settlements between 2004 and 2020, with an estimated consumer cost of $3.5 billion annually. Post-*Actavis*, the number of cash settlements declined, but the total number of settlements with delayed generic entry has not decreased significantly (FTC, 2023).

### REMS and Distribution Restrictions

Some brand-name manufacturers use Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) -- FDA safety programs -- to prevent generic manufacturers from obtaining the drug samples needed for bioequivalence testing. Without these samples, generic companies cannot file ANDAs. The FDA has identified this practice as a significant barrier to generic competition.

**Evidence**: FDA reported in 2023 that it had received over 200 inquiries from generic developers unable to obtain samples of REMS-restricted drugs. The CREATES Act (2019) provided a limited legal remedy, allowing generic manufacturers to sue for access, but litigation is slow and costly.

## Pharmacy Benefit Manager Opacity

### Misaligned Incentives

PBMs are compensated in ways that do not align with lowering drug costs for patients. PBMs negotiate manufacturer rebates (averaging 30-50% of list price for brand-name drugs), but they may retain a significant share of those rebates rather than passing them to patients or plan sponsors. PBMs also earn revenue through "spread pricing" -- charging plans more than they reimburse pharmacies -- and by steering prescriptions to PBM-owned specialty pharmacies.

The result is a system in which PBMs may prefer higher-cost drugs with larger rebates over lower-cost alternatives, because the PBM's revenue increases with the size of the rebate. This creates a "gross-to-net" bubble in which manufacturers set high list prices to fund large rebates that benefit PBMs, while patients (whose copays are often based on list prices) pay more.

**Evidence**: The FTC's July 2024 interim report on PBMs found that the three largest PBMs marked up prices on specialty drugs by 30-60% above acquisition cost, that PBM-affiliated specialty pharmacies charged higher prices than independent pharmacies, and that PBMs' rebate retention practices may increase net drug costs.

### Market Concentration

Three PBMs -- CVS Caremark, Express Scripts, and OptumRx -- control approximately 80% of the prescription drug market. Each is vertically integrated with a major health insurer (Aetna/CVS, Cigna, UnitedHealthcare) and a major specialty pharmacy. This concentration creates significant barriers to entry, limits plan sponsors' bargaining power, and enables anti-competitive practices.

**Evidence**: A 2024 study by the American Economic Association found that PBM consolidation since 2012 has been associated with a 5-8% increase in net drug spending for employer-sponsored plans, as concentrated PBMs extract more favorable terms from plans while not proportionally reducing manufacturer prices.

## Political Economy

### Who Benefits from the Status Quo

| Actor | Benefit | Economic Value | Incentive to Block Reform |
|-------|---------|----------------|---------------------------|
| Brand-name pharmaceutical manufacturers | Monopoly pricing power; freedom to set prices without government negotiation | U.S. pharmaceutical revenue: ~$600 billion/year | Any price regulation reduces revenue and stock valuation |
| Pharmacy benefit managers | Rebate retention; spread pricing; vertical integration revenue | Top 3 PBMs: combined revenue ~$423 billion/year | Transparency mandates would expose profit margins; price reductions shrink rebate pool |
| Pharmaceutical investors/shareholders | Above-market returns driven by pricing power | S&P Pharmaceuticals Index outperformed S&P 500 by 47% (2013-2023) | Regulation perceived as threat to returns |
| Patent attorneys and IP firms | Complex patent strategies generate substantial legal fees | Pharmaceutical patent litigation: ~$5 billion/year | Simplified patent system reduces demand for services |
| Pharmaceutical lobbyists | High-value lobbying and revolving door positions | PhRMA lobbying: $374 million (2022-2023 cycle) | Policy status quo maintains demand for lobbying |

### Perverse Incentives

The current system contains multiple misaligned incentives that sustain high prices:

1. **Manufacturer incentive to raise list prices**: Higher list prices enable larger rebates, which PBMs demand, creating a spiral. Manufacturers raise list prices to fund rebates, and PBMs demand larger rebates, prompting further list price increases. The average "gross-to-net" gap (difference between list and net price) for brand drugs reached 52% in 2023 (Drug Channels, 2024).

2. **PBM incentive to prefer high-cost drugs**: PBMs may earn more from rebates on a $50,000 drug than from rebates on a $5,000 drug that treats the same condition. This can lead to formulary decisions that favor expensive brand drugs over cheaper alternatives.

3. **Hospital/340B incentive to use expensive drugs**: Under 340B, covered entities purchase drugs at deep discounts but may be reimbursed by insurers at or near full list price. The spread incentivizes use of expensive drugs and expansion of the 340B program beyond its safety-net mission.

4. **Insurer incentive to shift costs to patients**: Insurers increasingly use high-deductible plans, copay accumulators, and coinsurance (percentage-of-price cost sharing) that expose patients to high costs, particularly for specialty drugs. This shifts the financial burden from insurers to patients without addressing underlying prices.

## Regulatory Capture and Weak Enforcement

### FDA Resource Constraints

The FDA's Office of Generic Drugs has historically been underfunded relative to its workload. A backlog of over 1,000 generic drug applications persisted through much of the 2010s, delaying market entry for cheaper alternatives. The Generic Drug User Fee Act (GDUFA) has improved review times, but the FDA lacks authority to proactively prevent anti-competitive patent strategies.

**Evidence**: The FDA's median ANDA approval time improved from 48 months (2012) to 22 months (2023) following GDUFA implementation, but the agency estimates that delayed generic entry costs consumers $3-$4 billion annually (FDA, 2023).

### FTC Enforcement Limitations

The FTC has authority to challenge anti-competitive pharmaceutical practices under Section 5 of the FTC Act, but enforcement has been slow and limited. Post-*Actavis*, the FTC has settled or won relatively few pay-for-delay cases, and settlements that do not involve explicit cash payments remain difficult to challenge. The FTC lacks the resources to investigate the hundreds of patent settlement agreements filed annually.

### Congressional Inaction and Lobbying

The pharmaceutical industry is the largest lobbying sector in the United States. PhRMA and individual drug companies spent $374 million on lobbying in the 2022-2023 election cycle (OpenSecrets, 2024). The industry deploys approximately 1,500 registered lobbyists -- roughly three for every member of Congress. This lobbying infrastructure has successfully blocked or weakened drug pricing legislation for decades.

**Evidence**: Between 2000 and 2022, at least 35 significant drug pricing bills were introduced in Congress. Only two enacted meaningful price controls: the ACA's Medicaid rebate increase (2010) and the IRA's Medicare negotiation authority (2022). All others were blocked, weakened, or allowed to expire.

## Institutional and Market Structure Factors

### Inelastic Demand

Prescription drugs, particularly for serious or life-threatening conditions, have highly inelastic demand -- patients cannot simply choose not to buy a drug they need to survive. This gives manufacturers pricing power that does not exist in most consumer markets. A patient with cancer, diabetes, or a rare disease has no realistic option to refuse treatment or "shop around" for alternatives that may not exist.

### Information Asymmetry

Patients, physicians, and even insurers often lack real-time information about drug prices, alternatives, and the availability of patient assistance programs. The opacity of the rebate system means that even sophisticated payers cannot determine the true net cost of a drug. This information asymmetry benefits manufacturers and PBMs while disadvantaging patients and employers.

### Fragmented Purchasing

Unlike countries with single-payer or coordinated multi-payer systems, the U.S. has thousands of separate payers (employers, insurers, government programs) that negotiate individually with manufacturers. This fragmentation reduces collective bargaining power. Even large employers cannot match the purchasing leverage of a national health system.

## Why Reform Has Failed

1. **Lobbying Power**: The pharmaceutical industry's $374 million in lobbying spending during the 2022-2023 cycle exceeds that of any other sector. This spending funds direct lobbying of Congress, campaign contributions ($64 million in the 2022 cycle), grassroots advocacy campaigns, and academic/think tank research that supports industry positions.

2. **Complexity as Shield**: The drug pricing system is extraordinarily complex -- involving patents, exclusivities, rebates, formularies, prior authorization, and multiple payer systems. This complexity makes it difficult for the public to understand who is responsible for high prices and enables each actor (manufacturers, PBMs, insurers) to blame others.

3. **Innovation Narrative**: The pharmaceutical industry has successfully framed any price regulation as a threat to innovation, arguing that U.S. prices subsidize global drug development. This narrative resonates with policymakers and the public, even though evidence shows that major pharmaceutical companies spend more on stock buybacks and dividends than on R&D.

4. **Incremental Legislative Design**: When reforms do pass, they are typically narrow in scope (e.g., the IRA covers only Medicare, only a limited number of drugs). Narrow reforms are easier to pass politically but leave most of the market unaddressed and allow industry to shift costs to unreformed segments.

5. **Legal Challenges**: The pharmaceutical industry has challenged the IRA's constitutionality through multiple federal lawsuits, demonstrating its willingness to use litigation to delay or block implementation of enacted reforms. Even if these challenges fail, they create uncertainty and delay that slows reform momentum.
