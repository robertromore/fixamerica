# Drug Pricing: What You Can Do

Drug pricing reform has overwhelming public support -- 83% of Americans favor allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices (KFF, 2023) -- yet the pharmaceutical industry's $374 million lobbying machine has repeatedly blocked or weakened reform efforts. Sustained citizen engagement is the most important counterweight to industry influence. Whether you are personally affected by high drug costs or simply believe that no one should ration their medications in the world's wealthiest country, there are concrete actions you can take.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- Subscribe to **KFF Health News** (kffhealthnews.org) for patient-focused drug pricing reporting and the **STAT Pharmalittle** daily newsletter (statnews.com) for pharmaceutical industry news
- Follow the **CMS Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program** page (cms.gov) for updates on negotiated prices and program expansion
- Read the **RAND International Drug Price Comparisons** report (rand.org) to understand how U.S. prices compare globally
- Track your Congressional representatives' positions on drug pricing bills using **GovTrack.us** or **Congress.gov**

### Manage Your Personal Drug Costs

- **Ask about generics and biosimilars**: Ask your physician or pharmacist whether a generic or biosimilar alternative exists for any brand-name drug you take. Generics account for 90% of prescriptions dispensed but only 20% of spending.
- **Compare pharmacy prices**: Use tools like **GoodRx** (goodrx.com), **RxSaver** (rxsaver.retailmenot.com), or **Cost Plus Drugs** (costplusdrugs.com) to compare prices across pharmacies. Prices for the same drug can vary by 500%+ between pharmacies in the same city.
- **Check patient assistance programs**: Most major manufacturers offer patient assistance programs (PAPs) for uninsured or underinsured patients. The **NeedyMeds** database (needymeds.org) lists over 5,000 programs. **RxAssist** (rxassist.org) provides a comprehensive directory.
- **Review your insurance formulary**: Understand which drugs are on your plan's preferred tier (lowest copay). Ask your doctor to prescribe preferred-tier alternatives when clinically appropriate.
- **Apply for the Medicare Extra Help program**: If you are a Medicare beneficiary with limited income (< $22,590 individual / $30,660 couple in 2024), you may qualify for the Low-Income Subsidy (Extra Help) program that significantly reduces Part D costs.
- **Use the $2,000 Medicare OOP cap**: Starting in 2025, Medicare Part D beneficiaries have a $2,000 annual out-of-pocket cap with monthly payment smoothing. Opt into the Medicare Prescription Payment Plan to spread costs evenly.

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact Your Representatives**: Call or write your U.S. Senators and Representative about drug pricing legislation. Personal stories about medication costs are the most effective form of constituent communication.
- **Submit Public Comments**: When CMS, FDA, or FTC propose rules related to drug pricing, submit comments during the public comment period. Federal agencies are required to read and respond to all substantive comments. Regulations.gov lists open comment periods.
- **Write Letters to the Editor**: Letters about drug pricing experiences published in local newspapers reach elected officials and help shape public opinion in your community.
- **Share Your Story**: Organizations like Patients for Affordable Drugs (patientsforaffordabledrugs.org) collect and amplify patient stories about drug costs. Sharing your experience can influence policy.

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- Form or join a local **drug pricing advocacy group** through organizations like AARP chapters, Patients for Affordable Drugs, or Families USA state affiliates
- Host a **community forum on prescription drug costs** featuring local pharmacists, patient advocates, and elected officials. Invite local media coverage.
- Partner with **community health centers** (FQHCs) to educate patients about the 340B program, patient assistance programs, and state-level affordability resources
- Organize **"Empty Pill Bottle" campaigns** -- collect empty bottles from people who have rationed medications due to cost and deliver them to Congressional offices as a visual demonstration of the problem

### Build Coalitions

- Connect with **labor unions**, **senior groups**, and **chronic disease organizations** (American Diabetes Association, American Cancer Society, etc.) that share drug pricing reform as a priority
- Engage **small business owners** who face rising health insurance premiums driven partly by drug costs -- they are a powerful, bipartisan constituency for reform
- Work with **independent pharmacists** who face PBM squeeze pricing and can speak to the supply chain dynamics that raise costs for patients

---

## Political Actions

### Contact Elected Officials

**When to Contact**:
- When drug pricing bills are introduced or approaching committee votes (check Congress.gov for status of pending legislation)
- During budget season (October-December) when appropriations for FDA, FTC, and NIH are determined
- When CMS announces new drugs selected for Medicare negotiation (typically August-September annually)
- After personal experiences with high drug costs or medication rationing

**What to Say - Template Email**:

```
Subject: Support Comprehensive Drug Pricing Reform

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

I am a constituent from [City, State] writing to urge your support for drug pricing reform. [Personal sentence about your experience -- e.g., "I pay $X per month for [drug name], which I need for [condition]" or "My [family member] has been forced to ration their [medication] due to cost."]

I urge you to support legislation that would:
1. Expand Medicare's drug price negotiation authority to cover more drugs
2. Require pharmacy benefit manager transparency and rebate pass-through
3. Reform the patent system to end evergreening and pay-for-delay
4. Extend the $35 insulin copay cap and $2,000 OOP cap to all insurance

Americans pay 2-3 times more for brand-name drugs than citizens of any other developed country. This is a policy choice, not an inevitability, and it costs 125,000 American lives per year through medication non-adherence.

Thank you for your service and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say - Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City]. I'm calling about prescription drug pricing. I'd like [Representative/Senator] [Name] to support expanding Medicare drug price negotiation and requiring PBM transparency. [Optional: brief personal story about drug costs.] Can you please note my position? Thank you."
```

### Support Legislation

Current or proposed legislation to support:

- **IRA Expansion Bills**: Legislation to extend Medicare negotiation to more drugs, eliminate exclusivity windows, and extend negotiated prices to commercial insurance -- contact Senate Finance and House Energy & Commerce Committee members
- **PBM Transparency/Reform Bills**: The Pharmacy Benefit Manager Reform Act and similar bills requiring PBM disclosure, rebate pass-through, and divestiture -- bipartisan support exists in both chambers
- **Insulin Price Cap Extension**: Legislation to extend the $35/month insulin cap to commercial insurance and uninsured patients -- broad bipartisan support
- **Patent Reform**: The TERM Act, CREATES Act amendments, and other bills targeting patent evergreening and pay-for-delay -- contact Senate Judiciary and House Judiciary Committee members
- **Drug Importation**: The Safe and Affordable Drugs from Canada Act and similar importation bills -- contact Senate HELP and House Energy & Commerce Committee members

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "Do you support expanding Medicare's authority to negotiate drug prices beyond the current 10-20 drugs per year? If so, how many drugs should be covered?"
2. "What would you do about pharmacy benefit managers that mark up drug prices by 30-60% and keep rebates that should go to patients?"
3. "The pharmaceutical industry spent $374 million lobbying in the last election cycle. Will you pledge not to take campaign contributions from pharmaceutical companies or their trade associations?"
4. "Do you support extending the $35 insulin copay cap and $2,000 out-of-pocket limit to Americans with commercial insurance?"

**Voting Considerations**:
- Check candidates' positions on drug pricing through their campaign websites, debate statements, and voting records
- Look for endorsements from or opposition by PhRMA and pharmaceutical industry PACs -- industry opposition often signals genuine reform commitment
- Review which committees candidates serve on or seek: Senate Finance, Senate HELP, House Energy & Commerce, and House Ways & Means have primary jurisdiction over drug pricing

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing drug pricing with others, emphasize:

1. **The price gap is a policy choice**: Americans pay 2.78 times the OECD average for brand-name drugs because the U.S. is the only wealthy country that does not negotiate or regulate drug prices. This is a policy choice, not a market inevitability.
2. **People are dying from high prices**: 29% of American adults (83 million people) report not taking medications as prescribed due to cost, contributing to an estimated 125,000 preventable deaths per year. This is not an abstract economic debate -- it is a public health crisis.
3. **The innovation argument is overstated**: The 15 largest pharmaceutical companies spent $747 billion on stock buybacks and dividends between 2012 and 2021, compared to $552 billion on R&D. Two-thirds of new drugs originate from publicly funded NIH research. Countries with price regulation continue to innovate.
4. **The IRA is a start, not a finish**: Medicare negotiation covers only 10 drugs initially and does not apply to commercial insurance. Comprehensive reform would extend negotiated prices to all Americans and address patent abuse, PBM opacity, and the lack of competition.

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "High prices are necessary for drug innovation" | Top 15 pharma companies spent $195 billion more on buybacks/dividends than R&D (2012-2021); 2/3 of new drugs originate from NIH-funded research | Accountable.US, 2022; PNAS, 2018 |
| "The free market will lower drug prices" | Prescription drugs have inelastic demand (patients can't refuse needed treatments), patents create legal monopolies, and 3 PBMs control 80% of the market -- this is not a free market | FTC PBM Report, 2024; RAND, 2024 |
| "Drug importation is unsafe" | Canada, UK, and EU have regulatory systems comparable to the FDA; safety protocols can be built into importation programs | FDA Safety and Innovation Act, 2012; HHS Florida Importation Authorization, 2024 |
| "Medicare negotiation will lead to drug shortages" | Drug shortages affect cheap generics, not expensive brand-name drugs; countries with price negotiation do not have more shortages | ASHP Drug Shortage Data, 2024; OECD, 2024 |
| "PBMs save patients money" | FTC found PBMs mark up specialty drugs 30-60%, steer prescriptions to PBM-owned pharmacies, and retain significant rebate shares | FTC Interim Report on PBMs, July 2024 |
