# Drug Pricing: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

Drug pricing reform must proceed in three phases that build on each other: immediate patient relief and transparency (Phase 1), structural market reform through expanded negotiation and patent reform (Phase 2), and systemic transformation establishing value-based pricing across all markets (Phase 3). Each phase generates political momentum for the next by demonstrating concrete benefits to patients and the healthcare system. The strategy leverages the IRA's existing framework as a foundation, expanding proven mechanisms while introducing new tools as political conditions allow.

---

## Phase 1: Patient Relief and Transparency (Years 1-2)

### Objectives

- Extend proven IRA patient protections to all insurance markets
- Establish PBM transparency requirements
- Accelerate generic and biosimilar competition
- Build the political coalition for structural reform

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Extend $35 insulin copay cap to commercial insurance and uninsured | Congress (legislation); DOL/HHS (enforcement) | Months 1-6 (legislation); Month 12 (effective date) | $3-5 billion/year federal cost | Insulin affordability rate reaches 95%+ |
| Extend $2,000 annual OOP cap to commercial insurance | Congress (legislation); DOL/HHS (enforcement) | Months 1-6 (legislation); Month 18 (effective date) | $5-10 billion/year | Patients with OOP > $2,000 reduced by 90% |
| Ban copay accumulator programs nationally | Congress/HHS rulemaking | Months 1-9 | Minimal federal cost | 100% of copay assistance counts toward deductibles |
| Require PBM transparency disclosures | Congress (legislation); FTC (enforcement) | Months 3-12 (legislation); Month 18 (first reports) | $50 million FTC enforcement budget | Public disclosure of rebate retention, spread pricing |
| Additional GDUFA funding for generic approvals | Congress (appropriations) | Months 1-6 | $100 million additional FDA funding | Median ANDA approval time < 18 months |
| Launch federal biosimilar education campaign | CMS/FDA | Month 6 | $50 million/year | Physician biosimilar prescribing increases 20% |

### Legislative Requirements

- Affordable Medications Act (comprehensive bill extending IRA protections to all markets)
- PBM Transparency Act (standalone or incorporated into larger bill)
- FY2027 appropriations increase for FDA Office of Generic Drugs

### Expected Outcomes

Phase 1 should produce immediate, visible benefits for patients: lower insulin costs across all insurance types, capped out-of-pocket spending for all Americans with insurance, and the first comprehensive public data on PBM pricing practices. These outcomes build public support and political momentum for the structural reforms in Phase 2. Generic and biosimilar pipeline acceleration begins but will not produce full effects until Phase 2.

---

## Phase 2: Structural Market Reform (Years 3-5)

### Objectives

- Expand Medicare drug price negotiation to 50-100 drugs annually
- Enact comprehensive patent reform to end evergreening and pay-for-delay
- Restructure PBM industry to eliminate conflicts of interest
- Launch federal drug importation program
- Reduce biologic exclusivity from 12 to 7 years

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Expand Medicare negotiation to all drugs with > $1 billion annual spend | Congress (legislation); CMS (implementation) | Year 3 (legislation); Year 4 (first expanded negotiations) | $250 million CMS implementation budget | 50-100 drugs under negotiation; avg. 50% price reduction |
| Eliminate 9-year/13-year negotiation exclusivity windows | Congress (amend IRA) | Year 3 | Included in negotiation expansion bill | All drugs eligible for negotiation after 5 years |
| Enact patent reform (limit Orange Book listings, ban pay-for-delay) | Congress (legislation); USPTO/FTC (enforcement) | Years 3-4 | $50 million USPTO implementation; $75 million FTC enforcement | Pay-for-delay eliminated; avg. patents per drug reduced 60% |
| Require PBM divestiture of specialty/mail-order pharmacies | Congress (legislation); FTC (enforcement/monitoring) | Year 3 (legislation); Year 5 (compliance deadline) | FTC monitoring: $25 million/year | Complete PBM-pharmacy separation by Year 5 |
| Mandate 100% rebate pass-through to patients at point of sale | Congress (legislation); DOL/CMS (enforcement) | Year 3-4 | Minimal direct cost | Patient OOP costs reflect net (not list) prices |
| Launch federal drug importation program | Congress (legislation); FDA (implementation) | Year 3 (legislation); Year 4 (first imports) | $100 million FDA implementation | $8-12 billion annual savings |
| Reduce biologic exclusivity from 12 to 7 years | Congress (amend BPCIA) | Year 4 | Minimal direct cost | Biosimilar market share > 40% within 3 years of entry |

### Legislative Requirements

- Drug Price Competition and Innovation Reform Act (patent reform package)
- PBM Accountability Act (divestiture and rebate pass-through requirements)
- Safe Drug Importation Act (federal importation authorization)
- Biosimilar Competition Enhancement Act (exclusivity reduction)
- Medicare Negotiation Expansion Act (expanded negotiation authority)

### Expected Outcomes

Phase 2 produces structural changes in the pharmaceutical market. Expanded negotiation authority drives down prices for the costliest drugs. Patent reform accelerates generic entry, generating billions in annual savings. PBM restructuring eliminates hidden margins and ensures rebate savings reach patients. Drug importation provides an additional competitive pressure on domestic prices. Biologic exclusivity reduction begins the pipeline for earlier biosimilar competition, though full effects emerge in Phase 3.

## Phase 3: Value-Based Transformation (Years 6-10)

### Objectives

- Extend Medicare-negotiated prices to commercial insurance markets
- Implement international reference pricing across all payers
- Establish an independent Drug Value Assessment Board
- Reform 340B to ensure savings reach patients
- Restructure pharmaceutical R&D incentives

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Extend negotiated maximum fair prices to commercial markets | Congress (legislation); HHS (implementation) | Year 6 (legislation); Year 7 (effective) | $500 million implementation budget | U.S. brand-name prices within 150% of OECD avg. |
| Implement international reference pricing | CMS (IRP database); HHS (enforcement) | Year 7 (IRP database operational); Year 8 (IRP applied) | $300 million/year IRP infrastructure | U.S. prices converge toward 120% of OECD median |
| Establish Drug Value Assessment Board | Congress (legislation); independent Board (operations) | Year 6 (authorizing legislation); Year 8 (first assessments) | $200 million/year board operations | All new drugs assessed for therapeutic value within 1 year of approval |
| Reform 340B program | Congress (legislation); HRSA (oversight) | Year 7 | $50 million enhanced HRSA oversight | 340B savings documented as reaching low-income patients |
| Increase NIH funding to $60 billion/year | Congress (appropriations) | Years 6-10 (phased increase) | $12 billion additional over 5 years | Public-sector R&D increases as share of total; new drug pipeline diversifies |

### Expected Outcomes

Phase 3 completes the transformation from monopoly-based to value-based drug pricing. Commercial market prices converge with Medicare prices. International reference pricing creates a durable benchmark that prevents price escalation. The Drug Value Assessment Board provides independent, evidence-based assessments that inform pricing across all markets. NIH funding increases sustain innovation independent of manufacturer pricing power. By Year 10, the U.S. drug pricing system more closely resembles those of other developed nations while maintaining global leadership in pharmaceutical innovation.

## Governance and Oversight

- **Congressional Drug Pricing Oversight Committee**: Establish a joint Senate-House committee with jurisdiction over all drug pricing programs, including Medicare negotiation, PBM regulation, and 340B oversight. Require annual reports from CMS, FTC, and FDA on drug pricing reform implementation.
- **CMS Drug Price Negotiation Board**: Independent board within CMS, with members appointed for staggered 6-year terms, responsible for Medicare price negotiations and international reference price determinations.
- **FTC Pharmaceutical Competition Bureau**: Dedicated FTC division responsible for pharmaceutical antitrust enforcement, PBM oversight, and pay-for-delay monitoring.
- **GAO and CBO Evaluations**: Require GAO audits of drug pricing reform implementation every 2 years and CBO re-scoring of reform provisions every 5 years.
- **Drug Value Assessment Board**: Independent federal body modeled on NICE/IQWiG, with authority to assess the therapeutic value of new drugs and inform pricing decisions across all payers.

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Pharmaceutical Industry Legal Challenges

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: Medium (delays implementation but unlikely to block reforms entirely)

**Mitigation Strategy**: Design legislation to survive judicial scrutiny based on the Spending Clause (conditioning program participation on price terms), Commerce Clause (regulating interstate pharmaceutical commerce), and Tax Clause (excise taxes on non-compliant manufacturers). Incorporate strong severability clauses so that if one provision is struck down, others survive.

**Contingency Plan**: If courts strike down specific provisions, pivot to alternative mechanisms (e.g., if excise tax is invalidated, use Medicare exclusion as enforcement mechanism).

### Risk 2: Drug Shortages from Price Reductions

**Likelihood**: Low (for brand-name drugs); Medium (for generics)

**Impact**: High (drug shortages directly harm patients)

**Mitigation Strategy**: Establish a Strategic Pharmaceutical Reserve for essential drugs. Set minimum viable prices for generic drugs to prevent race-to-the-bottom pricing that causes manufacturer exit. Require advance notice (18 months) from manufacturers intending to discontinue a drug. Fund domestic manufacturing capacity for essential generics.

**Contingency Plan**: Emergency importation authority from FDA-recognized countries; mandatory licensing for drugs in shortage.

### Risk 3: Reduced Pharmaceutical Innovation

**Likelihood**: Low (based on international evidence)

**Impact**: High (fewer new drugs harms long-term patient outcomes)

**Mitigation Strategy**: Pair price reforms with increased NIH funding ($48 billion to $60 billion annually), enhanced R&D tax credits, extended exclusivity for genuinely novel drugs (first-in-class), and prizes for priority drug development. Monitor new drug approvals annually and compare to pre-reform baseline.

**Contingency Plan**: If new drug approvals decline significantly (> 20% below baseline), trigger automatic increase in NIH funding and review of exclusivity periods.

### Risk 4: Manufacturer Market Withdrawal

**Likelihood**: Very Low (manufacturers will not exit the world's largest pharmaceutical market)

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Negotiated prices include manufacturer profitability floors. International reference pricing uses 120% of median (not lowest) international price. Phase-in periods allow manufacturers to adjust business models.

**Contingency Plan**: March-in rights on publicly funded patents; compulsory licensing under 28 U.S.C. Section 1498 for drugs where manufacturers refuse to supply U.S. market at negotiated prices.

### Risk 5: Political Opposition Blocks Legislation

**Likelihood**: High (pharmaceutical industry spending exceeds $374 million per cycle)

**Impact**: High (without legislation, reforms cannot proceed)

**Mitigation Strategy**: Build overwhelming public support (83% of Americans favor Medicare negotiation); leverage bipartisan support for insulin caps and PBM transparency; use budget reconciliation to bypass filibuster for fiscal provisions; sequence reforms to build momentum from early wins.

**Contingency Plan**: Pursue executive actions where legislative authority exists (FDA generic approvals, FTC PBM enforcement, CMS demonstration projects); support state-level reforms as laboratories of democracy.
