# Drug Pricing: Current State

## Overall Drug Spending

The United States spends more on prescription drugs than any other country in both absolute and per capita terms. Total retail prescription drug spending reached approximately $405 billion in 2023, representing roughly 8.4% of total national health expenditures of $4.8 trillion. When non-retail drug spending (physician-administered drugs, hospital outpatient drugs) is included, total pharmaceutical spending exceeds $600 billion annually.

### Spending by Payer

| Payer | Spending (2023) | Share of Total | Trend |
|---|---|---|---|
| Private insurance | $175 billion | 43% | Up 7.2% YoY |
| Medicare Part D | $145 billion (FY2023) | 36% | Up 5.8% YoY |
| Out-of-pocket | $53 billion | 13% | Stable |
| Medicaid | $30 billion (net of rebates) | 7% | Down 2.1% YoY |
| Other (VA, DoD, IHS, etc.) | $12 billion | 3% | Stable |

### Spending Growth Trends

| Period | Average Annual Growth | Primary Driver |
|---|---|---|
| 2014-2018 | 4.3% | Specialty drug launches (hepatitis C, oncology) |
| 2019-2021 | 2.8% | Generic substitution offset by specialty growth |
| 2022-2023 | 6.1% | Obesity drugs (GLP-1s), cell and gene therapies |
| Projected 2024-2028 | 5-7% annually | GLP-1 uptake, gene therapies, oncology pipeline |

## International Price Comparisons

U.S. drug prices consistently exceed those in other developed nations, with the disparity most pronounced for brand-name drugs.

### Brand-Name Drug Prices: U.S. vs. International Comparisons

| Drug | U.S. Price (Annual) | Average OECD Price | U.S. Premium |
|---|---|---|---|
| Keytruda (pembrolizumab) | $191,000 | $79,000 | 142% higher |
| Humira (adalimumab) | $84,000 | $24,000 | 250% higher |
| Eliquis (apixaban) | $6,600 | $1,900 | 247% higher |
| Stelara (ustekinumab) | $78,000 | $26,000 | 200% higher |
| Ozempic (semaglutide, 1mg) | $12,000 | $3,400 | 253% higher |
| Insulin lispro (Humalog) | $3,400 | $530 | 542% higher |

Source: RAND Corporation, "International Prescription Drug Price Comparisons," 2024; Pharmaceutical Technology, 2024

### Aggregate Price Differentials

| Comparison | Brand-Name Drugs | Generic Drugs | Overall |
|---|---|---|---|
| U.S. vs. OECD average | 2.78x higher | 0.84x (16% lower) | 2.56x higher |
| U.S. vs. Canada | 2.18x higher | 0.97x (similar) | 2.08x higher |
| U.S. vs. Germany | 1.67x higher | 1.02x (similar) | 1.58x higher |
| U.S. vs. UK | 3.40x higher | 0.67x (lower) | 3.08x higher |
| U.S. vs. Japan | 2.52x higher | 0.88x (lower) | 2.37x higher |

Source: RAND Corporation, 2024

Generic drugs are modestly cheaper in the U.S. due to robust generic competition (generics account for 90% of prescriptions dispensed), but brand-name drugs -- which account for only 10% of prescriptions but approximately 80% of total drug spending -- drive the overall price differential.

## The Inflation Reduction Act Drug Price Negotiation Program

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 (P.L. 117-169) authorized Medicare to negotiate prices for select high-expenditure drugs for the first time. This represents the most significant drug pricing legislation since the creation of Medicare Part D in 2003.

### Key IRA Drug Pricing Provisions

| Provision | Details | Effective Date |
|---|---|---|
| Medicare drug price negotiation | CMS selects high-spending drugs for negotiation; manufacturers must participate or face excise tax of up to 95% of sales | First prices effective January 2026 |
| Number of drugs negotiated | 10 drugs (2026), 15 additional (2027), 15 additional (2028), 20 per year (2029+) | Phased rollout |
| Insulin copay cap | $35/month for Medicare beneficiaries | January 2023 |
| Inflation rebates | Manufacturers must pay rebates if price increases exceed CPI-U | January 2023 (Part B), 2024 (Part D) |
| Part D out-of-pocket cap | $2,000 annual cap for Medicare beneficiaries | January 2025 |
| Part D "smoothing" | Beneficiaries can spread out-of-pocket costs monthly | January 2025 |
| Vaccine cost sharing | $0 copay for Part D covered vaccines | January 2023 |

### First 10 Drugs Selected for Medicare Negotiation (2026 Prices)

| Drug | Condition | Medicare Spending (2022) | Pre-Negotiation Price | Negotiated Price | Savings |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Eliquis (apixaban) | Blood clots | $16.5 billion | $521/month | $231/month | 56% |
| Jardiance (empagliflozin) | Diabetes/heart failure | $7.1 billion | $573/month | $197/month | 66% |
| Xarelto (rivaroxaban) | Blood clots | $6.4 billion | $517/month | $197/month | 62% |
| Januvia (sitagliptin) | Diabetes | $4.1 billion | $527/month | $113/month | 79% |
| Farxiga (dapagliflozin) | Diabetes/heart failure | $3.3 billion | $556/month | $178/month | 68% |
| Entresto (sacubitril/valsartan) | Heart failure | $2.9 billion | $628/month | $295/month | 53% |
| Enbrel (etanercept) | Autoimmune | $2.8 billion | $7,106/month | $2,355/month | 67% |
| Imbruvica (ibrutinib) | Blood cancers | $2.7 billion | $14,934/month | $9,319/month | 38% |
| Stelara (ustekinumab) | Autoimmune | $2.6 billion | $13,836/month | $4,695/month | 66% |
| Fiasp/NovoLog (insulin aspart) | Diabetes | $2.6 billion | $495/month | $119/month | 76% |

Source: CMS, "Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program: Negotiated Prices," August 2024

CMS estimates these negotiated prices will save Medicare $6 billion in the first year (2026) and approximately $237 billion over 10 years across all drugs eventually negotiated.

## Medicare Part D

### Structure and Spending

Medicare Part D, the prescription drug benefit established by the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003, covers approximately 52 million beneficiaries through private insurance plans. Gross Part D spending reached $145 billion in FY2023, with the federal government subsidizing approximately 74% of program costs.

### Part D Coverage Phases (2025, Post-IRA Reform)

| Phase | Cost Range | Who Pays |
|---|---|---|
| Deductible | $0-$590 | Beneficiary (100%) |
| Initial coverage | $590-$2,000 OOP | Plan pays 75%, beneficiary pays 25% |
| After $2,000 OOP cap | All remaining costs | Plan and manufacturer share costs; beneficiary pays $0 |

Source: CMS, 2024

The IRA's $2,000 annual out-of-pocket cap (effective 2025) replaces the prior "catastrophic coverage" phase in which beneficiaries paid 5% of costs with no cap -- a provision that had exposed the sickest seniors to thousands of dollars in annual out-of-pocket costs for specialty drugs.

## Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs)

Three PBMs -- CVS Caremark, Express Scripts (Cigna), and OptumRx (UnitedHealth Group) -- control approximately 80% of the U.S. prescription drug market. PBMs negotiate rebates from manufacturers, design plan formularies, and process claims, but their operations are largely opaque.

### PBM Market Concentration

| PBM | Parent Company | Market Share (2023) | Annual Revenue |
|---|---|---|---|
| CVS Caremark | CVS Health | ~33% | $174 billion |
| Express Scripts | Cigna Group | ~24% | $139 billion |
| OptumRx | UnitedHealth Group | ~23% | $110 billion |
| Humana Pharmacy Solutions | Humana | ~8% | $31 billion |
| Prime Therapeutics | Blue Cross affiliates | ~6% | $24 billion |
| All others | Various | ~6% | — |

Source: Drug Channels Institute, 2024

### Key PBM Practices and Concerns

| Practice | Description | Concern |
|---|---|---|
| Rebate retention | PBMs negotiate manufacturer rebates but may retain 25-50% | Rebate savings not fully passed to patients or plans |
| Spread pricing | PBMs charge plans more than they reimburse pharmacies, keeping the "spread" | Hidden profit margins; Medicaid programs lost est. $2.6 billion (2017-2019) |
| Formulary steering | Preferring higher-rebate drugs over lower-cost alternatives | Drug selection based on PBM profit, not patient value |
| Copay accumulators | Preventing manufacturer copay assistance from counting toward deductibles | Patients pay full out-of-pocket despite using assistance |
| Vertical integration | PBMs own specialty pharmacies, mail-order pharmacies, and health plans | Self-dealing; directing prescriptions to affiliated pharmacies |

Source: FTC Interim Staff Report on PBMs, July 2024

The Federal Trade Commission issued an interim staff report in July 2024 finding that the three largest PBMs had engaged in practices that "squeeze" independent pharmacies, steer patients to PBM-affiliated pharmacies, and may inflate drug costs. The FTC report noted that PBM-affiliated specialty pharmacies charged significantly higher prices than independent pharmacies for the same drugs.

## The 340B Drug Pricing Program

The 340B program, established by the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. Section 256b), requires drug manufacturers participating in Medicaid to sell outpatient drugs at discounted prices to eligible healthcare organizations ("covered entities"), primarily safety-net hospitals and federally qualified health centers.

### 340B Program Scale

| Metric | Value (2022) | Trend |
|---|---|---|
| 340B purchase volume (acquisition cost) | $53.7 billion | Up from $29 billion in 2018 |
| Covered entities | ~50,000 unique sites | Up 43% since 2017 |
| Contract pharmacies | ~32,000 | Up from ~21,000 in 2018 |
| Estimated 340B discounts (savings) | $43-$54 billion | Approaching Medicaid rebate program in size |
| Share of U.S. drug purchases through 340B | ~12% | Up from ~5% in 2014 |

Source: HRSA, 2023; Drug Channels Institute, 2024

The 340B program has grown rapidly and controversially. Critics argue that the program has expanded far beyond its original safety-net intent, with covered entities using contract pharmacy arrangements to generate revenue rather than reduce costs for low-income patients. Supporters counter that 340B savings are essential for safety-net providers to maintain services in underserved communities. Multiple lawsuits between manufacturers and covered entities over contract pharmacy arrangements are ongoing.

## Patent and Exclusivity Landscape

### Current Patent Practices

Brand-name manufacturers use a variety of legal strategies to extend their effective monopoly periods well beyond the 20-year patent term.

| Strategy | Description | Estimated Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Patent evergreening | Filing secondary patents on formulations, delivery methods, or minor modifications | Extends monopoly 5-15 years beyond original patent |
| Pay-for-delay (reverse payments) | Paying generic manufacturers to delay market entry | Cost U.S. consumers est. $3.5 billion/year (FTC, 2010) |
| Product hopping | Switching patients to new formulation before patent expiry to maintain market share | Avg. 6 years of additional exclusivity |
| REMS abuse | Using Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies to block generic access to samples | Delays generic entry by 2-5 years |
| Patent thickets | Filing dozens of patents on a single drug | Humira: 132 patents; top biologics avg. 74 patents each |
| Citizen petitions | Filing FDA petitions to delay generic approvals | FDA found 92% of petitions did not raise valid safety concerns |

### Top Drugs by Patent Count

| Drug | Manufacturer | Number of Patents | Years of Protection Claimed |
|---|---|---|---|
| Humira (adalimumab) | AbbVie | 132 | 39 years of patent protection filed |
| Revlimid (lenalidomide) | Bristol Myers Squibb | 98 | 31 years |
| Enbrel (etanercept) | Amgen | 48 | 27 years |

## Biosimilar Competition

Biosimilars -- the biological drug equivalent of generics -- offer significant savings potential but have seen slower U.S. adoption compared to Europe.

### Biosimilar Adoption Rates

| Metric | U.S. (2023) | Europe (2023) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| FDA/EMA-approved biosimilars | 45 | 94 | FDA/EMA, 2024 |
| Biosimilars marketed and available | 30 | 78 | GaBI Journal, 2024 |
| Biosimilar market share (volume, where available) | 25-35% | 60-85% | IQVIA, 2024 |
| Average discount vs. reference biologic | 30-40% | 50-80% | RAND, 2024 |
| Humira biosimilar share (1 year post-launch) | ~14% | ~80% (3 years post-launch) | Drug Channels, 2024 |

The first Humira biosimilars launched in the U.S. in January 2023 after AbbVie settled with biosimilar manufacturers in patent litigation, with most settlements delaying entry until 2023 despite the drug's key patents having expired years earlier. One year after biosimilar launch, Humira biosimilars captured only approximately 14% of the U.S. market, compared to 80%+ market share achieved by biosimilars in Europe within 3 years. Analysts cite PBM formulary decisions, rebate structures that favor the reference product, and physician hesitancy as factors slowing U.S. adoption.

## Recent Trends

### Emerging Cost Drivers

- **GLP-1 receptor agonists**: Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound for diabetes and obesity are projected to cost U.S. payers $100+ billion annually by 2030. Wegovy lists at $1,349/month in the U.S. vs. $140/month in Denmark (where manufacturer Novo Nordisk is based). CBO estimates that covering GLP-1s for Medicare obesity would cost $35 billion over 10 years.
- **Cell and gene therapies**: One-time treatments with list prices of $1-$3.5 million per patient (e.g., Hemgenix at $3.5 million for hemophilia B, Casgevy at $2.2 million for sickle cell disease). An estimated 50+ cell and gene therapies are expected by 2030.
- **Oncology drugs**: Average annual cost of a cancer drug regimen exceeds $200,000 as of 2024, up from $50,000 in 2010.

### State-Level Activity

As of 2024, at least 37 states have enacted some form of drug pricing legislation, including:

| State Action | Number of States | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Prescription drug affordability boards | 9 states + D.C. | Colorado, Maryland, Oregon, Washington |
| Drug price transparency laws | 37 states | California, Connecticut, Maine, Oregon |
| Insulin copay caps | 25 states + D.C. | Illinois ($35/month), Colorado ($100/month) |
| PBM regulation/transparency | 40+ states | Arkansas, Ohio, West Virginia |
| Drug importation programs | 7 states (approved or pending) | Florida, Colorado, Vermont, New Hampshire |

## Emerging Challenges

- **Legal challenges to IRA**: The pharmaceutical industry has filed at least nine lawsuits challenging the IRA's Medicare negotiation authority, arguing it violates the Fifth Amendment (takings), First Amendment (compelled speech), and Eighth Amendment (excessive fines). Federal courts have so far rejected these challenges, but cases remain pending.
- **Drug shortages**: The U.S. experienced a record 323 active drug shortages in early 2024, driven by manufacturing quality problems, low generic drug prices that discourage production, and supply chain fragility. Shortages disproportionately affect older, low-cost generic drugs.
- **Interchangeability debates**: As biosimilars enter the market, debates over automatic substitution at the pharmacy level, physician prescribing habits, and patient trust continue to slow adoption.
- **International trade implications**: U.S. trade agreements have historically included provisions strengthening pharmaceutical patent protections abroad, which other countries argue raises their drug costs while benefiting U.S. manufacturers.
