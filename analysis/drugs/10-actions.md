# Drug Policy: What Citizens Can Do

## Overview

Drug policy reform requires sustained civic engagement. This chapter provides concrete, actionable steps for individuals, communities, and organizations seeking to advance evidence-based drug policy reform. Actions are organized from individual learning to systemic advocacy, with specific talking points, template communications, and common misconceptions to address.

## Learn

### Educate Yourself on Key Issues

Before advocating, build a foundation of knowledge:

- **Read the data**: Review the CDC WONDER overdose data, SAMHSA NSDUH survey results, and your state's drug-related statistics. Understanding the numbers makes advocacy more credible.
- **Understand the history**: The War on Drugs has a documented history of racial targeting, political manipulation, and policy failure. Michelle Alexander's *The New Jim Crow* and Johann Hari's *Chasing the Scream* are accessible starting points.
- **Learn about harm reduction**: Understand what naloxone, syringe services, fentanyl test strips, and supervised consumption sites do and why the evidence supports them. SAMHSA and the Harm Reduction Coalition offer introductory guides.
- **Know your state's laws**: Cannabis legalization status, Good Samaritan law coverage, syringe service program legality, fentanyl test strip legality, and Medicaid SUD treatment coverage vary significantly by state.
- **Understand addiction as a medical condition**: The brain disease model of addiction is supported by decades of neuroscience. Addiction involves changes in brain circuitry related to reward, stress, and self-control. It is not a moral failing or a choice.

## Advocate

### Contact Your Elected Officials

#### Federal Level

Call, write, or visit:

- **Your U.S. Senators**: Express support for cannabis legalization, sentencing reform, harm reduction funding, treatment expansion, and pharmaceutical accountability. The SAFE Banking Act and the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act are specific vehicles.
- **Your U.S. Representative**: Advocate for scheduling reform, increased SAMHSA funding, harm reduction authorization, and elimination of mandatory minimums for drug offenses.
- **The White House**: Urge the President to prioritize drug policy reform, expand executive actions on scheduling, and appoint evidence-oriented leadership at DEA and ONDCP.

#### State Level

- **Your state legislators**: Many of the most impactful drug policy reforms happen at the state level. Advocate for cannabis legalization, fentanyl test strip legalization, syringe service program expansion, Good Samaritan law strengthening, Medicaid SUD coverage expansion, and social equity programs.
- **Your governor**: Urge executive action on treatment access, harm reduction, and clemency for people incarcerated for drug offenses.
- **Your local officials**: City councils and county commissions make decisions about harm reduction services, policing practices, and local drug policy. Attend meetings and provide public comment.

### Template Letter to Federal Legislator

> Dear [Senator/Representative] [Name],
>
> I am writing as a constituent from [City, State] to urge you to support evidence-based drug policy reform. The United States is losing over 107,000 lives annually to drug overdoses, yet our federal drug policy remains anchored in a 1970 law that prioritizes punishment over public health.
>
> I respectfully ask you to:
>
> 1. **Support federal cannabis legalization** -- 70% of Americans support this, and 24 states have already acted. The conflict between state and federal law must be resolved.
> 2. **Increase federal funding for treatment and harm reduction** -- Only 24% of Americans with substance use disorders receive any treatment. Naloxone, syringe services, and fentanyl test strips save lives.
> 3. **Reform drug sentencing** -- Mandatory minimum sentences have not reduced drug use or trafficking but have produced stark racial disparities. Judicial discretion should be restored.
> 4. **Hold the pharmaceutical industry accountable** -- Ensure that opioid settlement funds are spent on addiction treatment and prevention, not diverted to general budgets.
>
> Drug policy reform is not partisan. The First Step Act of 2018 demonstrated that sentencing reform can achieve bipartisan support. I urge you to continue that work.
>
> Sincerely,
> [Your Name]
> [Your Address]

## Support Organizations

### Donate or Volunteer

The following organizations are at the forefront of drug policy reform and welcome financial support, volunteer time, and grassroots engagement:

| Organization | Focus | How to Support |
|-------------|-------|----------------|
| Drug Policy Alliance | Comprehensive reform | Donate, volunteer, join action alerts |
| NORML | Cannabis legalization | Donate, join local chapter, attend events |
| Harm Reduction Coalition | Harm reduction services | Donate, volunteer at SSPs, distribute naloxone |
| Last Prisoner Project | Cannabis prisoner release | Donate, write letters to incarcerated individuals |
| Faces & Voices of Recovery | Recovery advocacy | Share your story, attend rallies, donate |
| ACLU | Racial justice in enforcement | Donate, join legal advocacy campaigns |
| Law Enforcement Action Partnership | Reform from within | Connect LEAP speakers with community events |

### Volunteer for Direct Service

- **Naloxone distribution**: Many organizations train volunteers to distribute naloxone and teach overdose recognition and response. Contact your local health department or harm reduction organization.
- **Syringe service programs**: SSPs need volunteers for supply distribution, data collection, and outreach. Contact the North American Syringe Exchange Network (NASEN) to find programs near you.
- **Recovery support**: Recovery community organizations need peer mentors, drivers, and event volunteers. Contact Faces & Voices of Recovery or your local recovery community organization.
- **Letter writing**: Write letters to people incarcerated for drug offenses. The Last Prisoner Project coordinates letter-writing campaigns.

## Engage Your Community

### Have Conversations

- **Talk about addiction as a health issue**: When friends, family, or colleagues discuss drug policy, frame addiction as a medical condition rather than a moral failing. Use person-first language ("person with a substance use disorder" rather than "addict" or "junkie").
- **Share your story**: If you or a family member has been affected by addiction, sharing your experience reduces stigma and puts a human face on policy debates. Over 20 million Americans are in recovery.
- **Challenge misinformation**: Counter the gateway drug myth, fentanyl passive exposure claims, and the narrative that enforcement reduces drug use. Use specific data and citations.

### Community Organizing

- **Attend city council and school board meetings**: Drug policy decisions happen at the local level. Advocate for harm reduction services, evidence-based prevention in schools, and police reform.
- **Support ballot initiatives**: Cannabis legalization, sentencing reform, and harm reduction measures often appear on state ballots. Volunteer for campaigns, donate, and vote.
- **Organize community forums**: Invite speakers from harm reduction organizations, treatment providers, recovery community organizations, and reform advocates to educate your community.
- **Support treatment facility siting**: NIMBYism (Not In My Backyard) is a major barrier to treatment and harm reduction services. When treatment centers, SSPs, or overdose prevention sites are proposed in your community, show up in support.

## Talking Points

### When Someone Says: "Addiction is a choice."

**Respond**: Addiction involves changes in brain circuitry related to reward, motivation, and self-control. The American Medical Association, American Society of Addiction Medicine, and National Institute on Drug Abuse all classify addiction as a chronic brain condition. While initial drug use may involve choice, the development of addiction involves genetic, developmental, and environmental factors beyond individual control. Approximately 40-60% of addiction risk is genetic. We do not call diabetes or hypertension "choices," even though lifestyle factors contribute to both.

### When Someone Says: "We need tougher drug laws, not weaker ones."

**Respond**: The United States has the toughest drug laws in the developed world and the highest overdose death rate. We arrest 1.5 million people for drug offenses every year and incarcerate more people for drugs than any other country. Despite over $1 trillion spent on the War on Drugs, drug use rates have not declined. The countries with the lowest overdose death rates -- Portugal, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands -- use public health approaches, not mass incarceration. The evidence is clear: tougher laws have not made us safer.

### When Someone Says: "Cannabis is a gateway drug."

**Respond**: The gateway theory has been rejected by the National Academy of Sciences, NIDA, and most major scientific bodies. Approximately 91% of cannabis users never progress to other drugs. The gateway effect is better explained by social factors -- when cannabis is sold in illicit markets, users are exposed to dealers who also sell harder drugs. Legalization actually separates cannabis from illicit markets, potentially reducing gateway effects. In legal cannabis states, youth cannabis use has not increased.

### When Someone Says: "Harm reduction enables drug use."

**Respond**: Harm reduction saves lives. The 107,000 Americans who died of overdoses in 2023 are not helped by letting them die. Naloxone has reversed hundreds of thousands of overdoses. Syringe services reduce HIV and hepatitis C by over 50%. Supervised consumption sites have operated for decades in multiple countries without a single overdose death on-site -- and they increase, not decrease, treatment engagement. Meeting people where they are is the first step toward helping them get where they want to go.

### When Someone Says: "Oregon proved decriminalization doesn't work."

**Respond**: Oregon implemented decriminalization during the worst fentanyl crisis in history without adequate treatment infrastructure. The citation system was poorly designed, and treatment services were slow to come online. The lesson of Oregon is that decriminalization without treatment investment is insufficient -- not that criminalization works. Portugal, which has maintained decriminalization for over two decades with strong treatment and harm reduction services, has an overdose death rate that is 80 times lower than ours.

## Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality |
|---------------|---------|
| The War on Drugs reduces drug use | Drug use rates are comparable to countries with far less punitive approaches |
| Cannabis has no medical value | FDA-approved cannabis-derived medication (Epidiolex); therapeutic evidence for chronic pain, nausea, spasticity |
| Mandatory minimums deter drug trafficking | U.S. Sentencing Commission finds no deterrent effect beyond standard guideline sentences |
| Supervised injection sites increase crime | Peer-reviewed studies from Canada, Australia, and Europe consistently show no increase in crime |
| Fentanyl can cause overdose through skin contact | American College of Medical Toxicology: passive fentanyl exposure cannot cause clinically significant effects |
| Treatment doesn't work | Medication-assisted treatment reduces opioid overdose deaths by 50-75%; treatment ROI is 4:1 to 7:1 |
| Drug enforcement reduces racial disparities | Drug enforcement creates racial disparities: 3.6:1 arrest ratio, 5.9:1 incarceration ratio despite equal use |
| Drug legalization means no regulation | Legalization means regulation, like alcohol and tobacco -- age restrictions, safety standards, marketing limits |
