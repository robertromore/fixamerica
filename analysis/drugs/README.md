# Drug Policy

This directory contains a comprehensive analysis of United States drug policy, encompassing the War on Drugs, the opioid and fentanyl crises, cannabis legalization, harm reduction, drug scheduling, sentencing reform, treatment access, pharmaceutical regulation, and related issues.

## Overview

American drug policy sits at the intersection of public health, criminal justice, racial equity, and economics. For more than fifty years, the dominant paradigm has been punitive prohibition -- the "War on Drugs" declared by President Nixon in 1971 and escalated by every subsequent administration. The results are well-documented: the United States incarcerates more people for drug offenses than any other nation, yet drug use rates, overdose deaths, and substance use disorders remain at crisis levels. In 2023, over 107,000 Americans died from drug overdoses, the majority involving synthetic opioids like fentanyl -- a toll that exceeds annual deaths from car accidents and gun violence combined.

A growing bipartisan consensus now recognizes that the punitive approach has failed to reduce drug supply or demand while inflicting enormous collateral damage, particularly on Black and Latino communities. Meanwhile, 24 states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational cannabis, the FDA has approved new addiction treatment medications, and cities from New York to San Francisco have launched harm reduction programs. Yet federal law remains largely unchanged: cannabis is still classified as a Schedule I substance alongside heroin, the DEA retains enormous discretion over drug scheduling, and mandatory minimum sentences continue to fill federal prisons.

This analysis examines the full landscape of U.S. drug policy, identifies root causes of failure, and proposes evidence-based reforms that prioritize public health while maintaining appropriate law enforcement.
