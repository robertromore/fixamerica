# Drug Scheduling: What You Can Do

The federal drug scheduling system affects millions of Americans -- patients denied access to therapeutic substances, researchers blocked from studying Schedule I compounds, people facing criminal penalties disproportionate to actual harm, and communities bearing the weight of racially disparate enforcement. Citizen engagement is essential because scheduling reform requires both Congressional action and sustained administrative pressure. Here is how you can make a difference.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- Subscribe to *Marijuana Moment* (<https://www.marijuanamoment.net/newsletter/>) for daily coverage of federal cannabis scheduling developments
- Follow the DEA's Federal Register notices on scheduling actions: <https://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/fed_regs/>
- Read the National Academies report *The Health Effects of Cannabis and Cannabinoids* (2017) for the scientific consensus on cannabis therapeutic potential
- Track the cannabis rescheduling process through CRS reports at <https://crsreports.congress.gov/> (search "marijuana scheduling")
- Follow MAPS (<https://maps.org/>) for updates on MDMA and psilocybin therapeutic research and scheduling implications

### Make Personal Changes

- Educate yourself about the actual harm profiles of common substances; David Nutt's *The Lancet* (2010) harm ranking is an accessible starting point
- Challenge misconceptions about drug scheduling in personal conversations -- most people are surprised to learn that cannabis is classified alongside heroin while fentanyl is Schedule II
- If you are a healthcare provider, stay current on clinical evidence for Schedule I substances and support institutional participation in clinical trials

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact Your Representatives**: Urge your Senators and House member to support scheduling reform legislation (see specific bills below). Call during key moments: when scheduling bills are in committee, during DEA rulemaking comment periods, and during appropriations debates.
- **Submit Public Comments**: When the DEA publishes proposed scheduling rules (as it did in May 2024 for cannabis rescheduling), submit public comments through the Federal Register at <https://www.regulations.gov/>. Comments supporting evidence-based scheduling that cite specific scientific evidence are most impactful.
- **Write Letters to the Editor**: Local newspapers are read by Congressional staff. Write about how scheduling reform would benefit research, patients, or your community. Focus on specific, local impacts.
- **Share Information**: Share evidence-based scheduling reform content on social media. NORML, Drug Policy Alliance, and MAPS produce shareable fact sheets and graphics.

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- Form a local advocacy group focused on drug scheduling reform; connect with national organizations (NORML, DPA, MAPS) for resources and training
- Host community forums featuring researchers, patients, and medical professionals who can speak to the impact of scheduling on their work
- Partner with veterans' organizations to advocate for psychedelic therapy research access -- this is one of the most effective bipartisan entry points for scheduling reform
- Connect with local harm reduction organizations to understand how scheduling affects drug checking, naloxone access, and treatment availability

### Build Coalitions

- Build bipartisan coalitions by emphasizing shared interests: conservatives care about federalism and government overreach; libertarians care about individual liberty; progressives care about racial justice; veterans' organizations care about PTSD treatment access
- Engage medical professional associations at the local level -- county medical societies, nursing associations, and pharmacy boards can pass resolutions supporting scheduling reform
- Partner with university researchers who face Schedule I barriers; their stories are compelling and credible with both legislators and the public

## Political Actions

### Contact Elected Officials

**When to Contact**:

- During DEA rulemaking on cannabis rescheduling (comment periods and hearing schedules published in Federal Register)
- When scheduling reform bills are in committee markup (track at <https://www.congress.gov/>)
- During annual appropriations process (opportunity to defund enforcement of cannabis prohibition or fund scheduling reform studies)
- After major scheduling-related developments (new clinical trial results, state legalization votes, international reform actions)

**What to Say - Template Email**:

```
Subject: Support Evidence-Based Drug Scheduling Reform

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

I am writing as a constituent from [City, State] to urge your support for reforming the federal drug scheduling system to align with scientific evidence.

Cannabis has been classified as Schedule I -- alongside heroin -- since 1970, despite legalization in 24 states and the District of Columbia, authorization for medical use in 38 states, and HHS's own 2023 recommendation to reschedule it to Schedule III. Meanwhile, fentanyl, which killed approximately 75,000 Americans in 2023, is classified as Schedule II. This system is not based on science.

I urge you to:
1. Support completing cannabis rescheduling to Schedule III
2. Co-sponsor legislation to remove Schedule I barriers to medical research (such as the SAFE Research Act)
3. Support creating mandatory periodic scientific review of all scheduled substances

Evidence-based scheduling reform is a matter of medical research, patient access, and basic government credibility. Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say - Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City]. I'm calling to urge [Representative/Senator] [Name] to support drug scheduling reform. Cannabis has been Schedule I for over 50 years despite HHS recommending rescheduling. I'd like the [Representative/Senator] to support the cannabis rescheduling process and co-sponsor legislation to remove Schedule I research barriers. Can you please note my position? Thank you."
```

### Support Legislation

Current or proposed legislation to support:

- **Cannabis rescheduling (administrative)**: Support the DEA's proposed rule to reschedule cannabis to Schedule III by submitting public comments at <https://www.regulations.gov/>
- **MORE Act (Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act)**: Descheduling cannabis, establishing federal regulatory framework, and automatic expungement -- contact House Judiciary Committee members
- **Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act (CAOA)**: Comprehensive Senate descheduling bill -- contact Senate Judiciary Committee members
- **SAFE Banking Act**: Allows cannabis businesses in legal states to access banking services -- contact Senate Banking Committee members
- **SAFE Research Act**: Removes Schedule I research barriers -- contact Senate HELP Committee members
- **Right to Try for Psychedelics Act**: Expands access to psilocybin and MDMA for terminal patients -- contact Senate sponsors

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "Do you support rescheduling or descheduling cannabis at the federal level? If so, what specific legislative action would you take?"
2. "Do you believe the DEA -- a law enforcement agency -- should have final authority over the scientific classification of drugs? If not, what alternative would you support?"
3. "Would you support legislation to create mandatory periodic scientific review of all scheduled substances?"
4. "What is your position on expanding research access for Schedule I substances like psilocybin and MDMA that have received FDA breakthrough therapy designations?"

**Voting Considerations**:

- Check candidates' positions on cannabis legalization and scheduling reform at Vote Smart (<https://votesmart.org/>)
- Review candidates' campaign contributors -- pharmaceutical industry and private prison donations may predict opposition to scheduling reform
- Key committees: Senate Judiciary, House Judiciary, House Energy and Commerce, Senate HELP Committee

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing drug scheduling reform with others, emphasize:

1. **The Schedule I Absurdity**: "Cannabis is classified alongside heroin as Schedule I while fentanyl -- responsible for 75,000 deaths in 2023 -- is Schedule II. The scheduling system does not reflect science."
2. **Research Barriers**: "Schedule I classification blocks the medical research needed to determine whether substances have therapeutic value. Researchers face 9-12 months of additional licensing just to study Schedule I substances. This is a research barrier, not a safety measure."
3. **Patient Access**: "Over 3.4 million Americans use medical cannabis under physician supervision in state programs, but federal Schedule I status blocks VA doctors from recommending it to veterans and prevents FDA-standard clinical trials that would improve patient care."
4. **Bipartisan Issue**: "70% of Americans support cannabis legalization (Gallup, 2023). Support crosses party lines. The First Step Act showed bipartisan criminal justice reform is possible."

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "Schedule I means a drug is the most dangerous" | Schedule I means "no accepted medical use," not "most dangerous." Fentanyl (Schedule II) is far more lethal than cannabis (Schedule I). | 21 U.S.C. Section 812; CDC WONDER, 2024 |
| "Cannabis was placed in Schedule I based on scientific evidence" | Cannabis was placed in Schedule I as a "temporary" measure in 1970. The Shafer Commission recommended decriminalization in 1972, but Nixon rejected the recommendation. | National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse, 1972 |
| "Rescheduling cannabis means legalizing it" | Rescheduling to Schedule III would allow medical prescriptions and research access but would not legalize recreational use. Cannabis would be regulated like ketamine or buprenorphine. | CRS Report R47931, 2024 |
| "The DEA scheduling process is purely scientific" | The DEA is a law enforcement agency that has repeatedly overridden scientific recommendations. The DEA rejected its own ALJ's recommendation on MDMA and ignored the Shafer Commission on cannabis. | Brookings Institution, 2022 |
| "Rescheduling would violate international treaties" | Canada, Uruguay, and Germany have legalized cannabis while remaining parties to the 1961 Convention. The UN removed cannabis from Schedule IV in 2020. | UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs, 2020 |
