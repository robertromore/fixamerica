# Drug Scheduling: Solutions

Drug scheduling reform requires a multi-faceted approach that aims to align classification with scientific evidence, remove barriers to medical research, resolve the federal-state cannabis conflict, and ensure that criminal penalties are proportional to actual harm.

---

## Reform Framework

### Guiding Principles

- Evidence-based classification: Scheduling decisions should be determined by pharmacological evidence, not political calculations or law enforcement priorities
- Research facilitation: The scheduling system should enable, not obstruct, rigorous scientific research on controlled substances
- Proportional consequences: Legal and criminal consequences should be proportional to the actual harm potential of each substance
- Institutional independence: Classification authority should be insulated from law enforcement agencies with inherent conflicts of interest
- Periodic reassessment: Scheduling decisions should be subject to mandatory review as new evidence emerges

### Theory of Change

Reforming drug scheduling requires breaking the self-reinforcing cycle in which Schedule I barriers prevent research, the absence of research is used to justify maintaining Schedule I status, and institutional resistance blocks administrative reform. The theory of change operates on three levels: (1) immediate administrative actions to reduce research barriers and advance cannabis rescheduling; (2) legislative reform to restructure scheduling authority and create independent scientific review; and (3) diplomatic engagement to modernize international treaty obligations. Quick wins on research access and cannabis rescheduling build political momentum for deeper structural reform.

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Establish an Independent Drug Classification Commission

**Description**: Create a new, independent scientific body -- the Drug Classification Commission (DCC) -- with binding authority to classify, reclassify, and declassify controlled substances based on pharmacological evidence. The DCC would replace the DEA's scheduling authority with an expert panel modeled on the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). The Commission would consist of 7 members appointed by the President with Senate confirmation, serving staggered 7-year terms, with expertise in pharmacology, toxicology, addiction medicine, epidemiology, and public health. No more than 4 members could belong to the same political party, and former law enforcement officials would be ineligible for 5 years after leaving government service.

**Evidence Base**: Multiple countries have adopted independent scientific advisory bodies for drug classification. The United Kingdom's Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD) -- established in 1971 -- provides scientific advice to the government on drug classification, though its recommendations are advisory rather than binding. Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) uses independent expert committees for scheduling decisions. The U.S. Sentencing Commission demonstrates that an independent body can make binding policy decisions in the criminal justice domain. Research by Nutt et al. (2007, 2010) demonstrated systematic misalignment between UK drug classifications and evidence-based harm rankings, supporting the case for independent scientific review.

**Implementation**: Requires Congressional legislation to establish the DCC, define its authority, and transfer scheduling functions from the DEA. The DEA would retain enforcement of scheduling decisions but would no longer make them. A 2-year transition period would allow staffing, rulemaking, and transfer of pending petitions.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $25-35 million annually (comparable to the U.S. Sentencing Commission's $20 million budget). Cost offset by reducing DEA scheduling functions.

**Timeline**: 1-2 years for legislation; 1-2 years for establishment and staffing; operational by Year 3.

**Challenges**: Strong opposition from the DEA and law enforcement organizations. Requires Congressional action during a period of legislative gridlock.

**Impact Metrics**: Time from petition to final scheduling decision (target: <18 months vs. current 10+ years for contested substances); number of substances reclassified based on new evidence within first 5 years; research publication volume for reclassified substances.

### Solution 2: Reschedule Cannabis to Schedule III (Administrative Action)

**Description**: Complete the administrative rescheduling process initiated by President Biden in 2022 and proposed by the DEA in May 2024. Reclassify cannabis from Schedule I to Schedule III, consistent with the August 2023 HHS scientific recommendation.

**Evidence Base**: HHS completed an 8-factor analysis and concluded that cannabis has "currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States," "abuse potential less than the drugs or other substances in Schedules I and II," and a dependence profile consistent with Schedule III. This analysis drew on 38 states' medical cannabis programs, published clinical evidence, and widespread physician authorization.

**Implementation**: The DEA's proposed rule (published May 2024) must proceed through public comment, potential administrative law judge hearing, and final rulemaking. The process could be completed within 12-18 months if the DEA acts expeditiously.

**Cost/Resources**: Minimal incremental federal cost. Significant economic impact through elimination of 26 U.S.C. Section 280E tax burden on cannabis businesses (estimated ~$2 billion annually in effective tax relief, Joint Committee on Taxation estimate).

**Timeline**: 12-18 months for final rule; immediate effect on research access and tax treatment upon publication.

**Challenges**: Litigation from opponents (likely, but precedent favors agency deference on scheduling); treaty compliance questions; political opposition framing rescheduling as endorsing drug use; does not resolve banking or full legalization issues.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of active cannabis clinical trials (target: double within 2 years); cannabis business tax burden reduction; cannabis-related federal arrests (track for decline).

### Solution 3: Eliminate Schedule I Research Barriers

**Description**: Enact legislation or administrative changes to remove the unique research barriers imposed by Schedule I classification. Key elements include: (a) automatic provisional research access for substances with FDA breakthrough therapy designation; (b) streamlined DEA registration for academic researchers studying Schedule I substances; (c) requirement that the DEA process research license applications within 90 days; (d) authorization of multiple DEA-licensed suppliers for all Schedule I research substances; (e) elimination of the requirement for a separate Schedule I researcher registration (integrate into standard DEA researcher registration).

**Evidence Base**: The National Academies of Sciences (2017) identified Schedule I research barriers as a major impediment to cannabis science. A 2020 *Science* editorial signed by 150+ researchers called for removing Schedule I research barriers. The Brookings Institution (2022) documented average licensing delays of 9-12 months for Schedule I research. Studies comparing U.S. cannabis research output to countries without equivalent barriers (Israel, Canada, Netherlands) show significantly higher per-capita publication rates abroad.

**Implementation**: Executive action: HHS could establish streamlined inter-agency research protocols. Legislative action: the SAFE Research Act or similar bill could codify research access reforms. Administrative: DEA could revise 21 C.F.R. Part 1301 to expedite Schedule I researcher registration.

**Cost/Resources**: Minimal federal cost ($5-10 million for DEA process improvements). Substantial return on investment through accelerated scientific knowledge generation.

**Timeline**: Executive actions within 6-12 months; legislation within 1-2 years; full implementation within 2-3 years.

**Challenges**: DEA institutional resistance to losing control over research gatekeeping; potential need for additional DEA staff to process expedited applications; concerns about diversion of research substances.

**Impact Metrics**: Average time from application to Schedule I research license (target: <90 days); number of active Schedule I research registrations (target: 50% increase within 3 years); annual publication volume on Schedule I substances.

### Solution 4: Create Mandatory Periodic Scheduling Review

**Description**: Require the DEA (or the proposed Drug Classification Commission) to conduct a comprehensive review of every scheduled substance at least once every 10 years. The review would apply the CSA's 8-factor analysis using current scientific evidence and would require either reaffirmation of the current classification or initiation of rescheduling proceedings. Reviews would be conducted by HHS/FDA scientific staff, with the reviewing body required to publish findings publicly and act on them within 24 months.

**Evidence Base**: Cannabis has remained in Schedule I for 55 years without a formal review outside the petition-denial process. Many Schedule I substances have not been reviewed since their initial classification in 1970. Mandatory review mechanisms are standard in other regulatory contexts: the FDA requires periodic review of approved drugs; the EPA reviews pesticide registrations every 15 years; the Nuclear Regulatory Commission requires periodic license renewal. The absence of such mechanisms in the CSA is an outlier.

**Implementation**: Requires legislative amendment to the CSA adding Section 811(i) mandating periodic review. Phased implementation: highest-priority substances (those with active rescheduling petitions or significant new evidence) reviewed in Years 1-3; remaining substances on a rolling 10-year cycle.

**Cost/Resources**: $10-15 million annually for HHS/FDA review capacity; offset by more efficient use of DEA enforcement resources when substances are appropriately classified.

**Timeline**: Legislation in Year 1-2; first review cycle complete by Year 5.

**Challenges**: Resource-intensive for HHS/FDA; potential for political interference in review timing; requires Congressional action.

**Impact Metrics**: Percentage of scheduled substances reviewed within the 10-year cycle (target: 100%); number of substances reclassified through periodic review; time from review initiation to final action.

### Solution 5: Deschedule Cannabis and Establish Federal Regulatory Framework

**Description**: Remove cannabis entirely from the Controlled Substances Act and establish a separate federal regulatory framework -- modeled on the Federal Alcohol Administration Act -- that regulates cannabis production, distribution, marketing, testing, and taxation. Key elements: (a) federal descheduling of cannabis; (b) creation of a Bureau of Cannabis Regulation (within Treasury or a new independent agency); (c) establishment of federal quality and safety standards (potency labeling, contaminant testing, pesticide limits); (d) federal excise tax; (e) protection of state regulatory programs; (f) automatic expungement of federal cannabis convictions.

**Evidence Base**: Canada's Cannabis Act (2018) provides a working model of national cannabis legalization with robust public health regulation. In the first 5 years of legalization, Canada's youth cannabis use rates remained stable or declined (Canadian Cannabis Survey, 2023), the illicit market share declined from ~90% to ~40% (Health Canada, 2023), and cannabis tax revenue exceeded C$3 billion cumulatively. Uruguay, which legalized in 2013, also shows stable use rates with reduced criminal justice costs. In the U.S., state-level legalization has generated $15+ billion in cumulative tax revenue across legal states (Tax Foundation, 2024).

**Implementation**: Requires Congressional legislation. The MORE Act (passed the House in 2020 and 2022) and the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act (CAOA) provide legislative templates. A federal regulatory framework would need to address interstate commerce, banking, employment protections, impaired driving standards, and international treaty obligations.

**Cost/Resources**: Revenue-positive. Federal cannabis excise tax at 10-25% could generate $5-15 billion annually. Regulatory costs of $100-200 million annually for new agency operations. Net fiscal impact: positive.

**Timeline**: Legislation in Years 1-3; regulatory framework established in Years 2-4; full implementation in Years 3-5.

**Challenges**: Senate supermajority requirement (filibuster); opposition from anti-drug organizations, some law enforcement, and pharmaceutical industry; treaty compliance concerns; disagreements within reform movement about optimal framework; need for impaired driving standards.

**Impact Metrics**: Federal cannabis tax revenue; illicit market share (target: decline to <30% within 5 years); cannabis arrest rates (target: near elimination for adults); state program stability.

### Solution 6: Reform the Federal Analogue Act

**Description**: Replace the current Federal Analogue Act (21 U.S.C. Section 813) -- which treats "substantially similar" substances as Schedule I by default -- with a more targeted approach that (a) creates a rapid scientific assessment process for novel substances, (b) establishes a tiered temporary scheduling framework (not all analogues default to Schedule I), and (c) requires scientific review within 12 months of temporary scheduling to determine permanent classification.

**Evidence Base**: The Federal Analogue Act has been criticized for vagueness -- courts have struggled with the "substantially similar" standard, leading to inconsistent prosecution outcomes. A 2018 *Harvard Law Review* analysis found that the Analogue Act's ambiguity creates due process concerns. Meanwhile, the act has not prevented the proliferation of novel psychoactive substances; the DEA has identified over 900 NPS since 2009. More targeted approaches -- like New Zealand's Psychoactive Substances Act (2013), which requires manufacturers to demonstrate safety before marketing -- have shown promise in reducing NPS proliferation.

**Implementation**: Congressional legislation amending 21 U.S.C. Section 813 and modifying the emergency scheduling process under 21 U.S.C. Section 811(h).

**Cost/Resources**: $5-10 million annually for rapid scientific assessment capacity. Potentially reduces costs of failed Analogue Act prosecutions.

**Timeline**: Legislation in Years 1-2; regulatory implementation in Years 2-3.

**Challenges**: Balancing speed of response to dangerous new substances with scientific rigor; potential for analogue manufacturers to exploit definitional gaps.

**Impact Metrics**: Prosecution success rate for novel substance cases; time from substance identification to final classification; number of NPS reaching U.S. markets.

### Solution 7: Align Criminal Penalties with Evidence-Based Harm Assessment

**Description**: Reform the penalty structure of the CSA so that criminal penalties for drug offenses are proportional to the actual harm potential of each substance as determined by scientific evidence, rather than tied rigidly to schedule classification. Key elements: (a) eliminate mandatory minimum sentences for simple possession of any controlled substance; (b) create a scientifically derived harm index that informs sentencing guidelines; (c) ensure that penalties for trafficking distinguish between substances based on lethality and dependence potential (e.g., fentanyl trafficking penalties should far exceed cannabis penalties, regardless of schedule placement).

**Evidence Base**: Professor David Nutt's landmark 2010 study in *The Lancet* ranked drugs by 16 criteria of harm to users and others, finding that current scheduling bears little relationship to evidence-based harm. Alcohol ranked as the most harmful drug overall; cannabis ranked lower than tobacco. The U.S. Sentencing Commission's own data shows that mandatory minimums have not achieved their deterrence objectives and have contributed to racial disparities in sentencing.

**Implementation**: Congressional legislation amending CSA penalty provisions (21 U.S.C. Sections 841, 844) and directing the U.S. Sentencing Commission to revise guidelines based on evidence-based harm assessment.

**Cost/Resources**: Net savings from reduced incarceration. The federal government spends approximately $40,000 per federal prisoner per year; reducing drug incarceration by 20% would save ~$1.6 billion annually.

**Timeline**: Legislation in Years 1-3; Sentencing Commission guidelines revision in Years 2-4.

**Challenges**: "Soft on crime" political framing; opposition from prosecutors who use mandatory minimums as plea bargaining leverage; need for bipartisan support.

**Impact Metrics**: Sentencing disparity between substances of comparable harm (target: elimination); federal drug incarceration rate; racial disparities in drug sentencing (target: significant reduction).

## International Models

### United Kingdom: Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD)

**Description**: The UK's ACMD is an independent statutory body that provides evidence-based advice to the government on drug classification under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. The ACMD comprises scientists, medical professionals, and practitioners who review drug harm evidence and recommend classification changes.

**Results**: The ACMD has produced numerous evidence-based recommendations, including a 2009 recommendation to downgrade cannabis from Class B to Class C (rejected by the government) and Professor David Nutt's harm ranking methodology. However, the government is not required to follow ACMD advice, and in 2009, then-Home Secretary Alan Johnson dismissed Professor Nutt from the ACMD for publicly criticizing the government's rejection of scientific advice.

**Applicability to U.S.**: The ACMD model demonstrates the value and limitations of independent scientific advice. The U.S. should adopt the advisory structure but make recommendations binding rather than advisory to prevent political override.

### Australia: Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) Rescheduling

**Description**: Australia's TGA approved MDMA and psilocybin for therapeutic use in January 2023 (effective July 2023), becoming the first country to authorize these substances for clinical treatment of PTSD and treatment-resistant depression, respectively. The TGA made this decision through an independent expert committee review process.

**Results**: As of early 2024, authorized prescribers have begun treating patients under strict regulatory conditions. Early implementation has been cautious, with limited numbers of authorized prescribers and treatment centers.

**Applicability to U.S.**: Australia demonstrates that a developed nation can reclassify psychedelic substances for therapeutic use through an independent regulatory process. The TGA's approach -- allowing medical use within a tightly regulated framework -- could serve as a model for FDA/DEA rescheduling of psilocybin and MDMA.

### Canada: Cannabis Act (2018)

**Description**: Canada legalized recreational cannabis through the Cannabis Act (Bill C-45), removing it from the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act and establishing a comprehensive federal regulatory framework covering production, distribution, marketing, packaging, potency limits, and minimum age (18 federally, higher in most provinces).

**Results**: After 5 years: youth use rates remained stable (Canadian Cannabis Survey, 2023); illicit market share declined from ~90% to ~40% (Health Canada, 2023); cannabis tax revenue exceeded C$3 billion cumulatively; no significant increases in cannabis-impaired driving fatalities; over 500,000 cannabis criminal records eligible for expedited pardons.

**Applicability to U.S.**: Canada provides the strongest evidence that national cannabis legalization does not produce the catastrophic outcomes predicted by opponents. Key lessons: robust regulation matters more than prohibition status; youth protections can be maintained under legalization; illicit market displacement takes years; tax revenue is substantial.

### Portugal: Decriminalization Model (2001)

**Description**: Portugal decriminalized personal possession of all drugs in 2001, reclassifying possession for personal use (defined as up to 10 days' supply) as an administrative violation rather than a criminal offense. Users are referred to "dissuasion commissions" that can recommend treatment, impose fines, or take no action.

**Results**: In the first 15 years after decriminalization, Portugal experienced: reduced HIV infections among drug users (from 1,016 new cases in 2001 to 18 in 2017); reduced drug-related deaths; increased treatment enrollment; and no significant increase in overall drug use rates (European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, 2019).

**Applicability to U.S.**: Portugal's model demonstrates that decriminalizing possession does not increase drug use. While Portugal did not change its drug scheduling system, the decriminalization model informs the U.S. debate about whether criminal penalties -- which are tied to scheduling -- are an effective tool for drug policy.

## Pilot Programs and Demonstrations

- **Oregon Measure 109 (Psilocybin Therapy)**: Oregon launched licensed psilocybin therapy services in 2023, establishing the first state-level regulatory framework for therapeutic use of a federally Schedule I substance. Early data is being collected on treatment outcomes, safety, and implementation challenges. This program serves as a natural experiment in regulated psychedelic access.
- **Colorado Proposition 122 (Natural Medicines)**: Colorado's 2022 law created a regulatory framework for therapeutic use of psilocybin, DMT, ibogaine, and mescaline (non-peyote). The state's Natural Medicine Division is developing licensing, training, and facility requirements. Operational programs expected by 2025-2026.
- **DEA Additional Cannabis Cultivators**: Since 2021, the DEA has licensed additional cannabis cultivators for research beyond the University of Mississippi monopoly. This expansion is a pilot of sorts -- demonstrating that multiple suppliers can produce research-grade cannabis within the federal regulatory framework.

## Sequencing and Prioritization

### Quick Wins (0-2 years)

- Complete cannabis rescheduling to Schedule III through existing administrative process
- Issue executive order directing DEA to process Schedule I research applications within 90 days
- Expand DEA-licensed cannabis cultivators for research
- Publish HHS guidance clarifying that FDA breakthrough therapy designation creates presumption of research access

### Medium-term Reforms (2-5 years)

- Enact legislation establishing mandatory periodic scheduling review (10-year cycle)
- Pass the SAFE Research Act or equivalent to codify Schedule I research access reforms
- Reform the Federal Analogue Act to create tiered temporary scheduling
