# Drug Scheduling: Legislation

## Overview

Legislative reform of the drug scheduling system requires a multi-track approach: (1) structural reform to transfer scheduling authority from the DEA to an independent scientific body; (2) specific rescheduling or descheduling actions for cannabis, psilocybin, and MDMA; (3) removal of Schedule I research barriers; and (4) reform of criminal penalties tied to scheduling. This analysis presents two major federal bills -- the Evidence-Based Drug Classification Act (structural reform) and the SAFE Research Act (research access) -- along with state model legislation and a comprehensive regulatory framework. Constitutional amendments are not required because scheduling reform falls within Congress's existing Commerce Clause authority.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments required for this reform.* Congress has clear authority under the Commerce Clause (Art. I, Section 8, Cl. 3) and the Necessary and Proper Clause to regulate drug scheduling, as confirmed in *Gonzales v. Raich*, 545 U.S. 1 (2005). Reforms to the scheduling process, including transfer of authority to an independent commission, fall within Congress's established power to structure executive agencies and regulate interstate commerce in controlled substances.

## Federal Legislation

### The Evidence-Based Drug Classification Act

**Purpose**: Establish an independent Drug Classification Commission with binding authority to classify controlled substances based on pharmacological evidence, replacing the DEA's scheduling authority with expert scientific review, and requiring mandatory periodic reassessment of all scheduled substances.

**Key Provisions**:

1. Creates a 7-member Drug Classification Commission (DCC) with binding scheduling authority
2. Transfers scheduling, rescheduling, and descheduling authority from the DEA to the DCC
3. Requires mandatory scientific review of all scheduled substances on a 10-year cycle
4. Establishes evidence-based harm criteria replacing the CSA's vague "abuse potential" standard
5. Requires the DCC to act on scheduling recommendations within 24 months

119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To establish an independent Drug Classification Commission to make
evidence-based scheduling decisions for controlled substances, and
for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Evidence-Based Drug Classification
Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 established a five-
schedule classification system administered by the Drug Enforcement
Administration, a law enforcement agency.

(2) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
(2024), drug overdose deaths reached 107,543 in 2023, with
approximately 75,000 attributable to synthetic opioids (fentanyl),
which are classified as Schedule II.

(3) Cannabis has been classified as Schedule I since 1970 despite
legalization for recreational use in 24 States and the District of
Columbia, medical authorization in 38 States, and a 2023
recommendation by the Department of Health and Human Services to
reschedule it to Schedule III.

(4) Schedule I classification impedes medical research by imposing
an average of 9-12 months of additional licensing requirements on
researchers, as documented by the Brookings Institution (2022) and
the Government Accountability Office (2021).

(5) The Drug Enforcement Administration has overruled scientific
recommendations on scheduling in multiple documented instances,
including the placement of MDMA in Schedule I over the
recommendation of an administrative law judge (1985) and the
rejection of five cannabis rescheduling petitions between 1972
and 2020.

(6) An independent scientific body with binding scheduling
authority would better serve public safety, research access,
and evidence-based policy than the current system, in which a
law enforcement agency exercises final authority over medical
and scientific classification.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:

(1) COMMISSION.—The term "Commission" means the Drug
Classification Commission established under section 4.

(2) CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE.—The term "controlled substance"
has the meaning given the term in section 102 of the Controlled
Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802).

(3) EVIDENCE-BASED HARM ASSESSMENT.—The term "evidence-based
harm assessment" means a systematic evaluation of a substance's
risk profile based on the criteria established in section 5(b).

(4) SCHEDULING ACTION.—The term "scheduling action" means
the placement, reclassification, or removal of a substance from
the schedules of controlled substances under section 202 of the
Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 812).

```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 2 (Findings)**: Establishes the factual foundation for reform, citing specific data on overdose deaths, cannabis scheduling inconsistencies, and DEA's track record of overriding scientific evidence.
- **Section 4 (Commission)**: Models the DCC on successful independent agencies (NTSB, NRC, Sentencing Commission). The 7-member structure, political balance requirement, law enforcement disqualification, and removal-only-for-cause protection ensure scientific independence.
- **Section 5 (Transfer of Authority)**: Transfers scheduling authority while preserving DEA enforcement role. The evidence-based harm criteria (Section 5(b)) replace the CSA's vague "abuse potential" with specific, measurable pharmacological and social harm metrics.
- **Section 6 (Mandatory Review)**: Creates the periodic review mechanism that the CSA lacks, with prioritization criteria ensuring the most contested substances are reviewed first.
- **Section 8 (Appropriations)**: $35 million annual operating budget is comparable to the U.S. Sentencing Commission ($20 million) and reflects the Commission's broader scope.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Act signed into law | Year 1 | Congress / President |
| Commission members nominated | 180 days after enactment | President |
| Senate confirmation of members | 1 year after enactment | Senate |
| Commission operational; staff hired | 18 months after enactment | Commission |
| Scheduling authority transfers from DEA | 2 years after enactment | Commission / DEA |
| First mandatory review cycle begins | 3 years after enactment | Commission |
| First annual report to Congress | 1 year after enactment | Commission |

**Regulatory Authority**: The Commission would issue final scheduling rules through notice-and-comment rulemaking under the Administrative Procedure Act, maintaining public participation while ensuring scientific basis.

**Challenges**:

- **DEA opposition**: The DEA will resist loss of scheduling authority. Mitigation: the DEA retains enforcement authority, which is its core operational function.
- **Senate confirmation delays**: Commission members may face extended confirmation battles. Mitigation: allow acting members or quorum operation with 4+ confirmed members.
- **Political interference**: Future administrations may attempt to influence the Commission. Mitigation: removal-only-for-cause protection and staggered terms.

**Refinements**:

- **Add judicial review standard**: Specify that courts review Commission decisions under the "arbitrary and capricious" standard, maintaining appropriate judicial oversight while respecting scientific expertise.
- **Include advisory committee**: Create a broader advisory committee of stakeholders (patient advocates, researchers, law enforcement, state officials) to provide input without binding authority.

### The Scheduling Access for Evidence-Based Research (SAFE Research) Act

**Purpose**: Remove unique regulatory barriers imposed on Schedule I research, streamline researcher licensing, and ensure adequate supply of controlled substances for scientific study.

**Key Provisions**:

1. Requires DEA to process Schedule I research applications within 90 days
2. Eliminates separate Schedule I researcher registration (integrate into standard DEA researcher registration)
3. Mandates multiple DEA-licensed suppliers for every Schedule I substance
4. Creates automatic provisional research access for substances with FDA breakthrough therapy designation
5. Prohibits DEA from using manufacturing quotas to restrict research supply

**Draft Text**:

```text
119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To remove barriers to scientific research on Schedule I controlled
substances and ensure adequate supply for federally authorized
research, and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Scheduling Access for Evidence-Based
Research Act of 2026" or the "SAFE Research Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) Schedule I classification under the Controlled Substances Act
(21 U.S.C. 812(b)(1)) imposes unique research barriers, including
separate DEA registration, limited substance supply, and extended
licensing timelines averaging 9-12 months (GAO-22-104387).

(2) These barriers have impeded research on substances with
documented therapeutic potential, including cannabis (medical use
authorized in 38 States), psilocybin (FDA breakthrough therapy
designation, 2018), and MDMA (FDA breakthrough therapy
designation, 2017).

(3) The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine
found in 2017 that "regulatory barriers, including the
classification of cannabis as a Schedule I substance, impede the
advancement of cannabis research."

(4) The Government Accountability Office found in 2021 that DEA
and HHS should improve the federal process for marijuana research,
including research application processing times and cannabis
supply quality.

SEC. 3. EXPEDITED RESEARCH REGISTRATION.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 303 of the Controlled Substances Act
(21 U.S.C. 823) is amended by adding at the end the following:

"(k) EXPEDITED SCHEDULE I RESEARCH REGISTRATION.—
    (1) TIMELINE.—The Attorney General shall approve or deny
    any application for registration to conduct research with
    a schedule I controlled substance not later than 90 days
    after the date on which the application is received.
    (2) DEEMED APPROVAL.—If the Attorney General fails to act
    on an application within the 90-day period described in
    paragraph (1), the application shall be deemed approved,
    subject to standard security and compliance requirements.
    (3) INTEGRATED REGISTRATION.—The Attorney General shall
    integrate schedule I research registration into the standard
    researcher registration process under this section, eliminating
    the requirement for a separate schedule I researcher
    registration.".

SEC. 4. RESEARCH SUPPLY REQUIREMENTS.

(a) MULTIPLE SUPPLIERS.—Not later than 1 year after the date
of enactment of this Act, the Attorney General shall ensure
that not fewer than 3 entities hold active registrations to
manufacture each schedule I controlled substance for which
there is an active research demand, as determined by the
number of pending or approved research registrations.

(b) QUOTA PROTECTIONS.—The Attorney General may not use the
manufacturing quota authority under section 306 of the
Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 826) to restrict
the supply of any schedule I controlled substance below
the level necessary to fulfill approved research
requirements.

(c) QUALITY STANDARDS.—Research substances manufactured
under this section shall meet quality standards equivalent
to those required for substances used in clinical trials
under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

SEC. 5. BREAKTHROUGH THERAPY RESEARCH ACCESS.

(a) IN GENERAL.—When the Secretary of Health and Human
Services grants a breakthrough therapy designation under
section 506(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act (21 U.S.C. 356(a)) for a schedule I controlled
substance, the Attorney General shall—
    (1) expedite processing of all pending research
    registration applications for that substance;
    (2) grant provisional research access to any
    investigator conducting an FDA-authorized clinical
    trial of that substance within 30 days of application;
    and
    (3) ensure adequate manufacturing supply to support
    all authorized clinical trials.

SEC. 6. REPORTING.

Not later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this
Act, and annually thereafter, the Attorney General shall
submit to Congress a report that includes—
    (1) the number of schedule I research applications
    received, approved, denied, and pending;
    (2) the average processing time for schedule I
    research applications;
    (3) the number of registered schedule I manufacturers
    and the quantity produced for research; and
    (4) any instances in which the 90-day timeline under
    section 3 was not met, with explanations.

SEC. 7. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to the Department
of Justice $10,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2027
through 2031 to carry out this Act.

SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date that is 90 days
after the date of enactment of this Act.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 3 (Expedited Registration)**: The 90-day processing requirement with deemed approval addresses the DEA's history of slow-walking research applications. Integration of Schedule I registration into standard researcher registration eliminates duplicative paperwork.
- **Section 4 (Research Supply)**: The multiple-supplier requirement ends the effective monopoly that has plagued cannabis research. Quota protections prevent the DEA from using administrative tools to restrict research supply.
- **Section 5 (Breakthrough Therapy)**: Automatic provisional access for breakthrough therapy substances addresses the current absurdity of FDA-designated breakthrough therapies being simultaneously classified as having "no accepted medical use."

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Act effective | 90 days after enactment | DOJ/DEA |
| Integrated registration process implemented | 90 days after enactment | DEA |
| First 90-day processing cycle complete | 180 days after enactment | DEA |
| Three manufacturers licensed per in-demand Schedule I substance | 1 year after enactment | DEA |
| First annual report to Congress | 180 days after enactment | Attorney General |

**Challenges**:

- **DEA resistance to deemed approval**: The DEA will argue that automatic approval creates safety risks. Mitigation: standard security and compliance requirements still apply; approval is for research registration, not commercial distribution.
- **Manufacturer capacity**: Scaling up to 3+ suppliers per substance requires time. Mitigation: 1-year timeline with interim supply from existing manufacturers.

**Refinements**:

- **Add reciprocity provisions**: Allow researchers with state Schedule I licenses to receive expedited federal registration.
- **Include retrospective application**: Apply expedited processing to all pending applications at time of enactment.

## State Model Legislation

### Model State Drug Scheduling Review Act

**Purpose**: Require state-level periodic review of controlled substance classifications to ensure alignment with scientific evidence and federal developments.

**Adaptability Notes**: States should customize based on their existing controlled substance acts, scheduling authority structures, and relationships with state pharmacy boards and medical associations.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "[State]
Evidence-Based Drug Scheduling Review Act of 2026".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS.

The Legislature finds that:

(a) The state controlled substances schedule should reflect
current scientific evidence regarding the pharmacological
properties, medical utility, and harm potential of regulated
substances.

(b) Federal scheduling decisions have not kept pace with
scientific evidence, as demonstrated by the continued
Schedule I classification of cannabis despite its
authorization for medical use in [number] states.

(c) A periodic state-level review process would ensure
that [State] scheduling decisions are informed by the
best available evidence.

SECTION 3. SCHEDULING REVIEW COMMISSION.

(a) There is established the [State] Drug Scheduling
Review Commission, consisting of 5 members appointed
by the Governor with the advice and consent of the
[State Senate/Legislature].

(b) Members shall include:
    (1) A pharmacologist or toxicologist;
    (2) A physician specializing in addiction medicine;
    (3) An epidemiologist or public health researcher;
    (4) A representative of a state medical association; and
    (5) A patient advocate.

(c) The Commission shall conduct a review of the state
controlled substances schedule not less frequently than
every 5 years and shall recommend reclassification of
any substance for which current scientific evidence
does not support the existing classification.

SECTION 4. RESEARCH FACILITATION.

(a) The [State Department of Health / Pharmacy Board]
shall establish an expedited state-level research
license process for substances classified in the
most restrictive state schedule.

(b) No state licensing requirement shall impose a
processing timeline longer than 60 days for bona fide
research applications from accredited institutions.

SECTION 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on [date].
```

---

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: Drug Classification Commission (upon establishment); DEA (interim)

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **Evidence-Based Harm Assessment Methodology**: The Commission must publish a final rule within 18 months establishing the specific methodology, weighting, and data sources for the 8-factor harm assessment under Section 5(b) of the Evidence-Based Drug Classification Act.
2. **Mandatory Review Procedures**: The Commission must publish procedures for the 10-year mandatory review cycle, including public input mechanisms, expedited review triggers, and publication requirements.
3. **Research Registration Integration**: The DEA must publish revised 21 C.F.R. Part 1301 regulations integrating Schedule I research registration into the standard registration process within 90 days of the SAFE Research Act's enactment.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Civil Penalties**: The Commission may impose civil penalties of up to $100,000 per violation for non-compliance with scheduling requirements by manufacturers or distributors.
- **Administrative Actions**: The Commission may suspend or revoke registrations for failure to comply with scheduling terms.
- **Private Right of Action**: Researchers whose applications are not processed within the 90-day statutory timeline may bring suit in federal district court for mandamus relief.
- **Criminal Penalties**: Criminal penalties for controlled substance violations remain under existing CSA provisions as enforced by the DEA.

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Commerce Clause Authority**: Congress's power to regulate drug scheduling is well-established under the Commerce Clause, as affirmed in *Gonzales v. Raich*, 545 U.S. 1 (2005). The creation of an independent scheduling commission falls within Congress's authority to structure the executive branch under the Necessary and Proper Clause.

**Non-Delegation Doctrine**: Transferring scheduling authority to an independent commission raises potential non-delegation concerns under *Gundy v. United States*, 588 U.S. ___ (2019). Mitigation: the Evidence-Based Drug Classification Act provides an "intelligible principle" through the 8-factor harm assessment criteria in Section 5(b), which is more specific than the CSA's existing delegation to the DEA.

**Due Process**: The deemed-approval provision in the SAFE Research Act could face due process challenges. Mitigation: standard security and compliance requirements remain; deemed approval applies only to research registration, not commercial activity; applicants have no right to manufacture or distribute.

### Preemption

Federal scheduling reform does not preempt state controlled substance laws. States retain authority to impose more restrictive (but not less restrictive) controls under the CSA's savings clause (21 U.S.C. Section 903). Cannabis descheduling at the federal level would remove federal prohibition but would not force states to legalize.

### Enforcement and Compliance

The DEA retains enforcement authority for scheduling violations. The Drug Classification Commission makes classification decisions; the DEA enforces them. This separation of authority mirrors the FDA/DOJ model for pharmaceutical regulation enforcement.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| Commission capture by industry interests | Pharmaceutical companies could lobby for appointees sympathetic to blocking natural substance rescheduling | High | Strengthen conflict-of-interest provisions; require financial disclosure; bar members with recent pharmaceutical industry ties |
| Deemed approval gaming | Applicants could submit incomplete applications knowing DEA cannot process within 90 days, obtaining automatic approval | Medium | Require completeness review within 15 days; incomplete applications do not trigger 90-day clock until deficiencies cured |
| Treaty compliance loophole | Opponents could challenge scheduling decisions as violating international treaty obligations | Medium | Include treaty consistency analysis requirement in Commission procedures; provide diplomatic authority to seek treaty modifications |
| Quota manipulation during transition | DEA could restrict manufacturing quotas during the 2-year transition period to limit research supply before authority transfers | Medium | Include anti-retaliation provision prohibiting DEA from reducing research quotas during transition period |
| State scheduling divergence | States could maintain Schedule I classifications even after federal rescheduling, creating continued barriers | Low | Include federal funding incentives for states that align scheduling with Commission recommendations; no preemption but financial carrots |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| 2-year transition delay for Commission authority | Reform benefits delayed; DEA retains scheduling power during transition | Need for orderly transition, Senate confirmation process | Allow interim scheduling recommendations by Commission during transition that DEA must respond to within 180 days |
| Commission cannot address non-scheduling policy issues | Criminal penalties, sentencing, and state laws remain unchanged by scheduling reform alone | Limited scope of legislation; scheduling reform is necessary but not sufficient | Pair with separate sentencing reform and cannabis regulatory legislation |
| 10-year review cycle may be too slow for rapidly evolving substances | Novel psychoactive substances may emerge faster than the review cycle | Balance between thoroughness and responsiveness | Emergency review authority allowing Commission to initiate out-of-cycle reviews; maintain expedited temporary scheduling for acute threats |
| Does not directly address cannabis banking | Rescheduling to Schedule III may not fully resolve banking access issues | Banking access depends on FDIC/FinCEN guidance and SAFE Banking Act, not just scheduling | Include provision directing Treasury to issue updated guidance within 180 days of any cannabis rescheduling action |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Anti-capture provisions**: Amend Section 4(b) to add a 3-year cooling-off period for appointees with pharmaceutical industry ties; require annual financial disclosures; create a public recusal process for conflicts of interest.
2. **Completeness check for deemed approval**: Amend Section 3 of the SAFE Research Act to include a 15-day completeness review period; the 90-day clock begins only upon determination of a complete application.
3. **Transition safeguards**: Add Section 5(e) prohibiting the DEA from reducing manufacturing quotas for research substances, denying pending research applications, or initiating new restrictive scheduling actions during the 2-year transition period without Commission concurrence.
4. **Emergency review authority**: Amend Section 6 to allow the Commission to initiate expedited out-of-cycle reviews upon petition from HHS, FDA, or any Commission member, with a 12-month action deadline for emergency reviews.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

The Evidence-Based Drug Classification Act should include a 10-year reauthorization requirement with a mandatory GAO evaluation at Year 7. The evaluation should assess: (a) whether the Commission has maintained scientific independence; (b) the quality and timeliness of scheduling decisions; (c) the impact on research access and public health outcomes; and (d) recommendations for structural improvements. The SAFE Research Act should include a 5-year sunset with reauthorization conditioned on demonstrated improvement in Schedule I research licensing times.
