# Drug Scheduling

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of the federal drug scheduling system under the Controlled Substances Act, examining how substances are classified, the role of the DEA and FDA in scheduling decisions, the tension between scientific evidence and political considerations, and proposals for comprehensive scheduling reform.

## Overview

The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) of 1970 established a five-schedule classification system that determines the legal status, criminal penalties, research accessibility, and medical availability of drugs in the United States. Schedule I -- the most restrictive category -- designates substances as having "no currently accepted medical use" and a "high potential for abuse," subjecting them to near-total prohibition including severe restrictions on scientific research. Schedules II through V apply progressively less restrictive controls.

The scheduling system has become one of the most consequential and contested features of U.S. drug policy. Cannabis remains classified as Schedule I despite legalization in 24 states and the District of Columbia for recreational use, and in 38 states for medical use. Psilocybin and MDMA remain Schedule I despite FDA breakthrough therapy designations and growing clinical evidence of therapeutic efficacy. Meanwhile, fentanyl -- responsible for approximately 75,000 overdose deaths in 2023 -- is classified as Schedule II, a category shared with prescription medications available by physician order. Critics argue that the scheduling system reflects the political and racial dynamics of the early 1970s more than modern pharmacological science, while defenders contend that it provides an essential framework for controlling dangerous substances.

This analysis examines the structure, history, and dysfunction of the federal scheduling system, identifies the institutional, political, and legal factors that perpetuate scientifically indefensible classifications, and proposes evidence-based reforms that would align drug scheduling with contemporary science while maintaining appropriate public safety protections.
