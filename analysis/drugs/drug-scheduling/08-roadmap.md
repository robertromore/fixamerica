# Drug Scheduling: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

Scheduling reform requires a phased approach that sequences politically achievable actions before more ambitious structural changes. Phase 1 leverages existing administrative authority and bipartisan consensus to deliver quick wins -- cannabis rescheduling and research access improvements -- that build political momentum. Phase 2 enacts legislative reforms to restructure scheduling authority and align penalties with evidence. Phase 3 achieves the long-term vision of an independent, science-based classification system and comprehensive federal cannabis regulation. Each phase builds on the credibility and coalition support generated by the previous phase.

---

## Phase 1: Administrative Action and Research Access (Years 1-2)

### Objectives

- Complete cannabis rescheduling from Schedule I to Schedule III
- Remove critical research barriers for Schedule I substances
- Expand DEA-licensed suppliers for research cannabis and psychedelics
- Establish inter-agency coordination for scheduling reform

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Finalize cannabis rescheduling rule (Schedule I to Schedule III) | DEA | Months 1-18 | Legal counsel; administrative law judge proceeding; public comment review | Final rule published in Federal Register |
| Issue executive order requiring DEA to process Schedule I research applications within 90 days | White House / DOJ | Month 1-3 | Presidential directive; DOJ implementation guidance | 90-day processing standard met for 90%+ of applications |
| Expand DEA-licensed cannabis cultivators to 10+ facilities | DEA | Months 1-12 | DEA licensing staff; facility inspections | Number of licensed cultivators |
| Publish HHS guidance on breakthrough therapy research access | HHS / FDA | Months 3-6 | FDA staff time; inter-agency coordination | Guidance document published; research applications for BT-designated substances prioritized |
| Establish inter-agency Scheduling Reform Working Group | ONDCP | Month 1-3 | Representatives from DEA, HHS, FDA, NIDA, ONDCP | Working group established; quarterly reports |
| Pardon all federal simple cannabis possession offenses | President | Month 1 | DOJ Office of the Pardon Attorney | Number of pardons issued |

### Legislative Requirements

- No new legislation required for Phase 1 actions (all within existing executive authority)
- Congressional support helpful for cannabis rescheduling (reduces litigation risk)
- Appropriations for additional DEA licensing staff ($5-10 million)

### Expected Outcomes

Phase 1 should achieve: cannabis reclassified to Schedule III, ending the 55-year Schedule I designation; average Schedule I research licensing time reduced from 9-12 months to under 90 days; at least 10 DEA-licensed cannabis cultivators operational; significant increase in new Schedule I research applications; elimination of Section 280E tax burden on cannabis businesses (~$2 billion annual effective tax relief); and presidential pardons for all federal simple cannabis possession convictions.

## Governance and Oversight

- **Phase 1 oversight**: ONDCP Scheduling Reform Working Group reports quarterly to the President and Congress. GAO conducts independent assessment of cannabis rescheduling implementation at 12 and 24 months.
- **Phase 2 oversight**: Congressional oversight through Senate Judiciary Committee and House Energy and Commerce Committee. Annual reporting from HHS on mandatory scheduling review progress. U.S. Sentencing Commission monitors penalty reform implementation.
- **Phase 3 oversight**: Drug Classification Commission publishes annual report and testifies before Congress. Inspector General audits of Commission operations. Public transparency requirements for all scheduling decisions, including full publication of scientific analyses.

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: DEA Institutional Resistance Delays Cannabis Rescheduling

**Likelihood**: Medium-High

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Presidential directive with clear timeline expectations; DOJ oversight of DEA rulemaking; Congressional pressure through oversight hearings and appropriations conditions.

**Contingency Plan**: If administrative rescheduling stalls, pursue Congressional scheduling action (e.g., MORE Act or CAOA) as alternative pathway.

### Risk 2: Federal Litigation Blocks Rescheduling

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium-High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Ensure rescheduling rule is built on robust administrative record; HHS scientific analysis provides strong evidentiary foundation; DOJ prepares for immediate litigation defense.

**Contingency Plan**: Even if initial rule is enjoined, litigation will produce judicial guidance on scheduling criteria interpretation that informs subsequent attempts.

### Risk 3: Political Backlash -- "Soft on Drugs" Framing

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Frame reform as pro-research, pro-veteran, and pro-law enforcement (focusing resources on fentanyl and violent crime). Lead with patient stories and veteran advocacy. Avoid framing as "legalization" where possible; emphasize "evidence-based classification."

**Contingency Plan**: If political environment becomes hostile, prioritize research access reforms (least politically controversial) and defer more ambitious reforms to more favorable conditions.

### Risk 4: International Treaty Complications

**Likelihood**: Low-Medium

**Impact**: Low-Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Engage diplomatically with like-minded nations (Canada, Germany, Uruguay) before domestic action. Develop legal analysis demonstrating treaty compatibility. The International Narcotics Control Board has no enforcement mechanism.

**Contingency Plan**: If treaty compliance is formally challenged, propose treaty amendments or interpretive declarations through UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs.

### Risk 5: State-Federal Regulatory Conflicts During Transition

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Design federal framework to accommodate existing state programs; include grandfathering provisions; establish joint state-federal regulatory coordination mechanisms.

**Contingency Plan**: Issue interim DOJ guidance (updated Cole Memorandum) during transition period to protect state programs from federal enforcement.
