# Drug Scheduling: Stakeholders

The drug scheduling system is shaped by the interactions of federal agencies, researchers, healthcare providers, patients, industry actors, advocacy organizations, and international bodies, each with distinct interests, resources, and levels of influence.

## Who Is Affected

### Primary Stakeholders

| Group | Impact | Size | Key Interests |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|
| Patients with conditions treatable by Schedule I substances | Denied legal access to potentially effective therapies (cannabis for chronic pain, epilepsy; psilocybin for depression; MDMA for PTSD) | Tens of millions (e.g., ~3.4 million cannabis patients in state medical programs, NCSL 2024) | Legal access to therapeutic substances; reduced stigma; insurance coverage |
| Medical researchers | Schedule I barriers delay studies by 9-18 months; limited substance supply; institutional reluctance | ~780 DEA-registered Schedule I researchers (DEA, 2023); thousands more deterred by barriers | Streamlined research access; adequate supply; removal of regulatory duplication |
| Cannabis industry workers and businesses | Operate in conflict with federal law; denied banking, tax deductions, bankruptcy protection | ~440,000 full-time jobs in legal cannabis (Leafly, 2024); ~$33.6 billion market (MJBizDaily, 2024) | Federal legalization or rescheduling; banking access; end of 26 U.S.C. Section 280E |
| People arrested or convicted for Schedule I offenses | Criminal records, incarceration, collateral consequences (housing, employment, education, immigration) | ~1.5 million drug arrests annually; ~350,000 for cannabis (FBI UCR, 2023) | Decriminalization; expungement; reduced penalties |
| People with substance use disorders | Scheduling affects treatment access (e.g., methadone distribution restrictions under Schedule II) | 48.7 million Americans with SUD (SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024) | Treatment access; reduced stigma; evidence-based scheduling of treatment medications |

### Secondary Stakeholders

- **Healthcare providers**: Physicians, psychiatrists, and addiction specialists whose prescribing authority is constrained by scheduling. ~1.1 million DEA-registered practitioners (DEA, 2023) must navigate scheduling-specific prescribing rules, including separate registrations for Schedule I research and electronic prescribing mandates for Schedule II.
- **State governments**: 38 states operate medical cannabis programs and 24 operate recreational programs in direct conflict with federal Schedule I classification. State regulators face legal uncertainty, banking obstacles, and inability to conduct quality research using federally classified substances.
- **Veterans**: Approximately 1.5 million veterans seek VA treatment for chronic pain, PTSD, and other conditions (VA, 2023). VA physicians cannot recommend cannabis even in legal states due to federal scheduling, and MDMA/psilocybin research for PTSD is slowed by Schedule I barriers.
- **Families and communities**: Communities of color disproportionately affected by Schedule I enforcement -- particularly cannabis arrests -- experience cascading effects across generations through criminal records, family separation, and economic marginalization.
- **Taxpayers**: Federal drug enforcement spending ($46.1 billion, FY2025) and incarceration costs (~$40,000 per federal prisoner per year) are substantially driven by scheduling classifications.

## Who Has Power

### Decision Makers

| Actor | Role | Authority | Resources | Influence Level |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| DEA Administrator | Final scheduling authority; administers CSA | Can schedule, reschedule, or deschedule substances; sets manufacturing quotas; registers researchers | $3.3 billion budget (FY2024); ~10,000 employees | High |
| HHS Secretary | Provides binding scientific/medical evaluations | HHS recommendations on scientific matters are binding on DEA under 21 U.S.C. Section 811(b) | FDA, NIDA, SAMHSA scientific resources | High (on scientific questions) |
| FDA Commissioner | Leads 8-factor analysis for scheduling decisions | Evaluates abuse potential, medical use, safety | FDA drug evaluation division; clinical trial expertise | High |
| NIDA Director | Funds and shapes drug abuse research | Controls largest federal investment in drug research; historically controlled cannabis supply | NIDA budget: ~$1.6 billion (FY2024) | Medium-High |
| Attorney General | DEA is within DOJ; AG can direct scheduling priorities | Legal authority over DEA; can direct rescheduling proceedings | DOJ institutional authority | High |
| Congressional committees | Can schedule/deschedule directly by legislation; oversee DEA/FDA | Senate Judiciary, House Judiciary, House Energy and Commerce | Appropriations power; legislative authority | High |
| President | Directs executive agencies; issues policy directives | Cannot unilaterally reschedule but can direct AG/HHS to initiate review | Executive authority; public platform | Medium-High |

### Key Organizations and Institutions

- **Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)**: The primary gatekeeper of the scheduling system. The DEA administers the CSA, processes scheduling petitions, conducts enforcement, and registers researchers. Its institutional culture is oriented toward prohibition, and its institutional interests align with maintaining restrictive classifications.
- **Food and Drug Administration (FDA)**: Conducts the scientific analysis underlying scheduling recommendations. The FDA's evaluation is binding on the DEA for medical and scientific questions, but the DEA retains discretion on non-scientific factors. The FDA's clinical trial framework shapes what counts as "currently accepted medical use."
- **National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)**: The largest federal funder of drug abuse research. NIDA has historically focused on the harmful effects of drug use rather than therapeutic potential, and its monopoly on research cannabis supply (until 2021) significantly shaped the research landscape.
- **Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP)**: Coordinates federal drug policy and certifies the national drug control budget ($46.1 billion, FY2025). ONDCP does not have direct scheduling authority but shapes policy priorities and messaging.

### Influencers

- **American Medical Association (AMA)**: Has called for reclassification of cannabis to facilitate research since 2009 and supports removing Schedule I barriers to clinical research.
- **American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)**: Advocates for cannabis legalization and scheduling reform on civil liberties and racial justice grounds. Published influential reports on racial disparities in cannabis enforcement (2013, 2020).
- **Drug Policy Alliance (DPA)**: Leading drug policy reform organization. Advocates for decriminalization, harm reduction, and evidence-based scheduling.
- **NORML (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws)**: Oldest cannabis reform organization (founded 1970). Filed the first cannabis rescheduling petition in 1972.
- **Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS)**: Sponsored and funded the MDMA-PTSD clinical trials that earned breakthrough therapy designation. Primary advocate for psychedelic rescheduling.
- **Cannabis industry trade groups**: National Cannabis Industry Association (NCIA), U.S. Cannabis Council, and state-level trade associations lobby for federal reform, banking access, and favorable tax treatment.

## Stakeholder Interests and Alignment

### Aligned Interests (Potential Coalition Partners)

| Coalition | Shared Interest | Strength |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Researchers + patients + medical associations | Removing Schedule I research barriers and expanding therapeutic access | Strong |
| Cannabis industry + state governments + tax reform advocates | Federal cannabis legalization/rescheduling for banking, tax, and regulatory clarity | Strong |
| Civil liberties organizations + racial justice advocates + criminal justice reformers | Ending Schedule I cannabis enforcement; expungement; addressing racial disparities | Strong |
| Veterans organizations + psychedelic researchers + PTSD treatment advocates | Rescheduling psilocybin and MDMA to expand therapeutic options for PTSD | Moderate-Strong |
| Libertarians + progressives + some conservatives | Reducing federal scheduling authority over substances with state-level legalization | Moderate |

### Conflicting Interests

- **DEA vs. researchers**: The DEA's institutional interest in maintaining broad scheduling authority conflicts with researchers' need for streamlined access to controlled substances. The DEA's registration and quota systems create bottlenecks that serve enforcement objectives at the expense of scientific progress.
- **Pharmaceutical industry vs. plant-medicine advocates**: Pharmaceutical companies benefit from Schedule I classification of natural substances (cannabis, psilocybin) that could compete with patented medications. The pharmaceutical industry also resists scheduling reforms that could enable low-cost, unpatentable therapies.
- **Federal enforcement agencies vs. state legalization advocates**: Federal agencies (DEA, DOJ) are legally bound to enforce the CSA regardless of state law. State governments and the cannabis industry want federal accommodation of state programs.
- **Rescheduling advocates vs. descheduling advocates**: Within the cannabis reform movement, there is a significant strategic disagreement between those who support rescheduling (moving cannabis to Schedule III, within the existing CSA framework) and those who support descheduling (removing cannabis from the CSA entirely and regulating it like alcohol or tobacco). Rescheduling is more politically achievable but maintains federal restrictions; descheduling would fully resolve the federal-state conflict but is more politically difficult.

### The DEA Iron Triangle

The scheduling system is sustained by an "iron triangle" of mutually reinforcing interests:

1. **DEA** (agency): Maintains scheduling authority, enforcement mandate, and budget
2. **Congressional committees** (legislature): Judiciary committees receive campaign contributions from law enforcement groups and private prison industry; use "tough on drugs" messaging
3. **Law enforcement interest groups** (lobbying): National Association of Police Organizations, Fraternal Order of Police, and private prison companies lobby to maintain punitive drug policies and oppose rescheduling

This iron triangle is supplemented by pharmaceutical industry lobbying, which quietly opposes scheduling reforms that would enable competition from natural substances.

## Influence Mechanisms

How stakeholders exert influence on scheduling policy:

- **Lobbying**: The pharmaceutical industry spent $374 million on federal lobbying in 2023 (OpenSecrets, 2024). Cannabis industry lobbying is growing but smaller -- the NCIA spent ~$2.1 million in 2023. Law enforcement groups and private prison companies also lobby against scheduling reform.
- **Campaign Contributions**: Pharmaceutical companies are among the top contributors to members of the Senate Judiciary and Health committees. The private prison industry contributes primarily to Republican members who oppose cannabis reform.
- **Revolving Door**: Former DEA officials frequently move to pharmaceutical industry consulting, lobbying firms, or private sector drug testing companies. Former congressional staff move to industry lobbying. This revolving door reinforces institutional resistance to scheduling reform.
- **Public Advocacy**: Organizations like NORML, DPA, and MAPS conduct public education campaigns, grassroots organizing, and ballot initiative efforts. The success of state-level cannabis legalization has been driven primarily by ballot initiatives rather than legislative action.
- **Expertise/Information**: The DEA, FDA, and NIDA control the scientific and enforcement data that inform scheduling decisions. Researchers and advocacy organizations challenge this information monopoly through independent studies, but face structural disadvantages in resources and institutional credibility.
- **Litigation**: Organizations like Americans for Safe Access have filed lawsuits challenging scheduling decisions and demanding DEA action on rescheduling petitions. While litigation has forced procedural improvements (e.g., requiring DEA to license additional cannabis cultivators), courts have generally deferred to DEA expertise on substantive scheduling questions.
