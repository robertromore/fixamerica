# Drug Scheduling: Current State

## The Five-Schedule Classification System

The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) classifies drugs into five schedules based on three statutory criteria: potential for abuse, currently accepted medical use, and potential for physical or psychological dependence. Each schedule carries distinct regulatory requirements and criminal penalties.

### Schedule Definitions and Key Substances

| Schedule | Criteria | Key Substances | Prescribing | Criminal Penalties (First Offense, Trafficking) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Schedule I** | High abuse potential; no accepted medical use; no accepted safety for medical use | Cannabis, heroin, LSD, psilocybin, MDMA, mescaline | Prohibited | Up to 20 years (varies by substance/quantity) |
| **Schedule II** | High abuse potential; accepted medical use with restrictions; severe dependence potential | Fentanyl, oxycodone, cocaine, methamphetamine, Adderall | Written Rx, no refills | Up to 20 years |
| **Schedule III** | Moderate abuse potential; accepted medical use; moderate dependence potential | Ketamine, anabolic steroids, buprenorphine, testosterone | Rx with up to 5 refills in 6 months | Up to 10 years |
| **Schedule IV** | Low abuse potential; accepted medical use; limited dependence potential | Benzodiazepines (Xanax, Valium), zolpidem, tramadol | Rx with up to 5 refills in 6 months | Up to 5 years |
| **Schedule V** | Lowest abuse potential; accepted medical use; limited dependence potential | Cough preparations with codeine, pregabalin, lacosamide | Rx or OTC (varies by state) | Up to 1 year |

### Schedule I Substance Categories

| Category | Examples | Number of Substances | Research Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Opioids | Heroin, alpha-methylfentanyl, MPPP | ~85 | Limited (heroin used in clinical studies abroad) |
| Hallucinogens | LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, DMT, ibogaine | ~75 | Psilocybin and MDMA in FDA clinical trials |
| Cannabis-related | Marijuana, THC (except FDA-approved forms) | ~15 | HHS recommended Schedule III (August 2023) |
| Stimulants | Cathinone, MDMA, methcathinone | ~40 | MDMA breakthrough therapy designation (2017) |
| Depressants | GHB (except Xyrem formulation), methaqualone | ~25 | Limited |

### Substances with Contested Scheduling

| Substance | Current Schedule | Scientific Consensus | Policy Conflict |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cannabis | Schedule I | Therapeutic uses well-documented; lower abuse potential than alcohol | 24 states + D.C. legalized recreational; 38 states medical programs |
| Psilocybin | Schedule I | Breakthrough therapy designation for depression (2018, 2019); promising Phase II/III data | Oregon legalized supervised therapeutic use (2020); Colorado followed (2022) |
| MDMA | Schedule I | Breakthrough therapy designation for PTSD (2017); Phase III trials completed | FDA advisory committee voted against approval in June 2024 |
| Kratom | Not scheduled (DEA withdrawal of intent to schedule, 2016) | Mixed evidence; opioid-like effects; dependence potential | Several states have banned; FDA has issued import alerts |
| Fentanyl analogs | Temporarily Schedule I (CLASS Act extensions) | Extremely high lethality; limited legitimate medical use for most analogs | Temporary scheduling requires repeated Congressional reauthorization |

## The Scheduling Process

### Administrative Scheduling (DEA-Initiated or Petition-Based)

The CSA provides two primary pathways for scheduling, rescheduling, or descheduling a substance:

1. **DEA-Initiated Process**: The DEA Administrator identifies a substance for scheduling review and requests a scientific and medical evaluation from HHS.
2. **Petition-Based Process**: Any interested party -- including individuals, organizations, state governors, or manufacturers -- may petition the DEA to initiate scheduling proceedings under 21 C.F.R. Section 1308.43.

#### Steps in the Administrative Process

| Step | Action | Responsible Party | Typical Timeline |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Petition filed or DEA initiates review | Petitioner or DEA | N/A |
| 2 | DEA requests scientific and medical evaluation | DEA to HHS/FDA | 30-90 days |
| 3 | HHS/FDA conducts 8-factor analysis | FDA (with NIDA input) | 6-18 months |
| 4 | HHS provides binding medical/scientific recommendation | HHS to DEA | Included in Step 3 |
| 5 | DEA considers HHS recommendation and additional factors | DEA | 6-24 months |
| 6 | DEA publishes proposed rule in Federal Register | DEA | Variable |
| 7 | Public comment period | Public | 30-60 days |
| 8 | DEA publishes final rule | DEA | 3-12 months after comment period |

**Critical Legal Point**: Under 21 U.S.C. Section 811(b), the HHS recommendation on scientific and medical matters is *binding* on the DEA -- the DEA cannot schedule a substance in a more restrictive category than HHS recommends based on medical and scientific evaluation. However, the DEA retains discretion to schedule a substance in a *less* restrictive category or to decline to schedule it at all.

### Congressional Scheduling

Congress may directly schedule or deschedule a substance through legislation, bypassing the administrative process entirely. Notable examples include:

| Year | Action | Substance | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1970 | Scheduled | All substances in original CSA | Controlled Substances Act (P.L. 91-513) |
| 1984 | Scheduled | MDMA emergency scheduling | DEA emergency authority under Comprehensive Crime Control Act |
| 1986 | Penalty changes | Crack cocaine vs. powder cocaine | Anti-Drug Abuse Act (100:1 sentencing disparity) |
| 2010 | Rescheduled | Crack cocaine penalty adjustment | Fair Sentencing Act (reduced to 18:1) |
| 2018 | Descheduled | Hemp (<0.3% THC) | Agriculture Improvement Act (Farm Bill) |
| 2022 | Extended temporary scheduling | Fentanyl-related substances | Temporary Reauthorization and Study of Emergency Schedules Act |

### Emergency Scheduling

The DEA Administrator may temporarily place a substance in Schedule I for up to two years (with one-year extension) under 21 U.S.C. Section 811(h) if doing so is "necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety." Emergency scheduling bypasses the HHS evaluation process. Since 2015, the DEA has used this authority extensively for fentanyl analogs.

## The Cannabis Rescheduling Process (2022-Present)

### Timeline

| Date | Event | Significance |
|---|---|---|
| October 2022 | President Biden directs HHS and AG to review cannabis scheduling | First presidential directive to reconsider cannabis classification |
| August 2023 | HHS recommends rescheduling cannabis to Schedule III | Binding scientific recommendation based on FDA 8-factor analysis |
| May 2024 | DEA publishes Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to reschedule cannabis to Schedule III | First formal DEA action toward cannabis rescheduling |
| August 2024 | DEA extends comment period; receives >40,000 public comments | Unprecedented public engagement |
| December 2024 | Administrative law judge hearing scheduled | Required under CSA for contested scheduling actions |
| 2025 (projected) | Final rule expected | Subject to litigation and potential Congressional action |

### Implications of Schedule III Classification for Cannabis

| Area | Schedule I (Current) | Schedule III (Proposed) |
|---|---|---|
| **Criminal penalties** | Up to 20 years (trafficking) | Up to 10 years (trafficking) |
| **Research access** | Separate DEA registration; single source (until 2021) | Standard DEA registration; multiple suppliers |
| **Prescribing** | Prohibited | Allowed with DEA registration |
| **Tax treatment (Section 280E)** | No ordinary business deductions for cannabis businesses | Section 280E no longer applies |
| **Banking access** | De facto prohibition (FDIC guidance) | Likely improved but uncertain without SAFE Banking |
| **State programs** | Federal conflict with all state programs | Reduced conflict; medical programs more defensible |
| **International treaties** | Arguably compliant (prohibition) | Treaty compliance questions (1961 Single Convention) |

## Research Barriers

### DEA Research Registration

Researchers seeking to study Schedule I substances must obtain a separate DEA registration (Schedule I Researcher Registration), in addition to standard institutional approvals (IRB, IBC). This process involves:

| Requirement | Description | Timeline |
|---|---|---|
| DEA Form 225 | Application for researcher registration | 2-4 weeks to submit |
| Protocol review | DEA reviews research protocol for compliance | 4-8 months |
| Site inspection | DEA physical inspection of research facility | 1-3 months |
| State license | Some states require additional controlled substance research licenses | 1-6 months |
| Supply procurement | Researcher must obtain substances from DEA-licensed supplier | 1-6 months |
| **Total typical process** | **From application to first experiment** | **9-18 months** |

### Cannabis Research Supply

Until 2021, the University of Mississippi held the sole DEA license to cultivate cannabis for federally authorized research, under a contract with the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). This monopoly was widely criticized:

| Issue | Impact | Source |
|---|---|---|
| THC potency of NIDA cannabis | Averaged 5-8% THC vs. 20-30% in state-legal markets | Vergara et al., *Scientific Reports*, 2017 |
| Limited product forms | No concentrates, edibles, or vaporizable products available | National Academies, 2017 |
| Supply delays | Wait times of 6-12 months for approved researchers | Brookings Institution, 2022 |
| Strain availability | Limited variety compared to thousands of state-market cultivars | Stith et al., *JAMA Network Open*, 2022 |

In May 2021, the DEA announced it would register additional cannabis cultivators for research, and by 2024, the agency had approved additional growers. However, the supply infrastructure remains far more limited than for other Schedule I substances.

### Research Volume Comparison

| Substance | PubMed Publications (2023) | FDA Clinical Trials Active (2024) | Schedule |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cannabis/cannabinoids | ~4,800 | ~180 | I |
| Psilocybin | ~650 | ~30 | I |
| MDMA | ~350 | ~12 | I |
| Oxycodone | ~1,200 | ~45 | II |
| Ketamine | ~2,400 | ~120 | III |
| Buprenorphine | ~1,500 | ~40 | III |

## Key Indicators Table

| Indicator | Current Value | 5-Year Trend | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| Schedule I substances | ~240 | Increasing (primarily fentanyl analogs) | Emergency scheduling adds ~5-15 per year |
| DEA Schedule I researcher registrations | ~780 | Increasing (~15% since 2019) | Driven by psilocybin and cannabis interest |
| Average Schedule I research license time | 9-12 months | Stable | Little improvement despite stated DEA goals |
| State recreational cannabis programs | 24 + D.C. | Increasing (from 11 in 2019) | Federal-state conflict widening |
| State medical cannabis programs | 38 + D.C. | Increasing (from 33 in 2019) | Broad bipartisan state-level support |
| Cannabis rescheduling petitions filed | 6 since 1972 | Periodic | All denied or pending prior to 2023 |
| Fentanyl analog emergency schedules | >30 analogs since 2015 | Increasing | Temporary scheduling authority repeatedly extended |

## Regulatory and Legal Framework

| Multiple states | Decriminalization resolutions | 2019-2024 | Local jurisdictions in 15+ cities |

## Recent Developments

### 2023-2024 Key Actions

- **August 2023**: HHS completed its 8-factor analysis and recommended to the DEA that cannabis be rescheduled from Schedule I to Schedule III, finding that cannabis has a "currently accepted medical use" based on widespread physician authorization and state-level regulatory frameworks.
- **May 2024**: The DEA published a proposed rule to reschedule cannabis to Schedule III, initiating formal rulemaking. This marked the first time the DEA had proposed to change cannabis's classification since the CSA's enactment in 1970.
- **June 2024**: An FDA advisory committee voted 9-2 against recommending approval of MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD, citing concerns about clinical trial methodology, despite two positive Phase III trials. This decision highlighted the tension between promising clinical data and FDA evidentiary standards.
- **2024**: Multiple bills introduced in Congress addressing scheduling, including the STATES Act, MORE Act, Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act, and various bipartisan measures to reschedule or deschedule cannabis.

## Emerging Challenges

### Novel Psychoactive Substances

The proliferation of novel psychoactive substances (NPS) -- synthetic drugs designed to mimic the effects of controlled substances while evading scheduling -- presents an ongoing challenge. The DEA has identified over 900 NPS since 2009, and the pace of emergence exceeds the capacity of the administrative scheduling process. The Federal Analogue Act (21 U.S.C. Section 813) provides a partial solution by treating "substantially similar" substances as Schedule I, but prosecution under the Analogue Act is complex and has yielded inconsistent results.

### Temporary Scheduling Expiration

Congressional authority for temporary scheduling of fentanyl-related substances requires periodic reauthorization. Lapses in authorization create enforcement gaps during which newly identified fentanyl analogs cannot be immediately controlled, even as they contribute to overdose deaths.

### International Divergence

Canada legalized recreational cannabis in 2018. Germany legalized in 2024. Uruguay legalized in 2013. Australia approved MDMA and psilocybin for therapeutic use in 2023. These international developments increasingly isolate the United States' restrictive scheduling approach and create pressure for domestic reform.
