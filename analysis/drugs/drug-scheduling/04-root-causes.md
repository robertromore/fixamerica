# Drug Scheduling: Root Causes

## Systemic Analysis

The drug scheduling system's failure to reflect scientific evidence is not the result of a single policy error but of several deeply rooted structural, institutional, and political dynamics. These include the placement of scheduling authority within a law enforcement agency, the design of statutory criteria that embed circular logic, the influence of industries that benefit from the status quo, and the entanglement of domestic classification with international treaty obligations. These causes interact and reinforce each other, creating a system that is extraordinarily resistant to evidence-based correction.

## Institutional Design Failures

### Law Enforcement Agency as Scientific Arbiter

The most fundamental structural flaw in the scheduling system is that final scheduling authority rests with the Drug Enforcement Administration -- a law enforcement agency whose institutional mission, culture, budget, and personnel incentives are oriented toward prohibition and enforcement rather than scientific evaluation. Although the CSA requires the DEA to request and consider an HHS scientific evaluation, the DEA retains final decision-making authority on scheduling actions.

**Evidence**: The DEA has overruled or delayed acting on scientific recommendations in multiple high-profile cases. In 1985, DEA Administrator John Lawn placed MDMA in Schedule I over the recommendation of administrative law judge Francis Young, who had concluded that MDMA had accepted medical use and should be placed in Schedule III. In 1988, Judge Young issued a ruling describing cannabis as "one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man" and recommending rescheduling; the DEA rejected this recommendation. The DEA denied five cannabis rescheduling petitions between 1972 and 2020, each time concluding that cannabis lacked "currently accepted medical use" despite accumulating evidence to the contrary.

### The "Currently Accepted Medical Use" Catch-22

The CSA's definition of "currently accepted medical use" has been interpreted by the DEA to require FDA-approved clinical trials demonstrating safety and efficacy -- the same standard required for new drug approval. But Schedule I classification itself impedes the research needed to generate this evidence. Researchers face 9-18 months of additional licensing requirements, limited substance supply, and institutional reluctance to pursue Schedule I studies. The result is a self-reinforcing cycle:

**Evidence**: A 2015 study in the *New England Journal of Medicine* found that regulatory barriers unique to Schedule I substances delayed cannabis research timelines by an average of 6-12 months compared to Schedule II-V research. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine noted in its 2017 report *The Health Effects of Cannabis and Cannabinoids* that "regulatory barriers, including the classification of cannabis as a Schedule I substance, impede the advancement of cannabis research."

### Fragmented and Conflicting Authority

The scheduling process divides authority between the DEA (final decision), HHS/FDA (scientific evaluation), and Congress (which can directly schedule or deschedule substances). This fragmentation creates coordination problems:

- The DEA and HHS may disagree on scheduling recommendations, leading to extended delays
- Congress can schedule substances without scientific review, as it did with the original CSA classifications
- Executive branch agencies face political pressure that may conflict with scientific findings
- State governments have no formal role in the federal scheduling process despite operating cannabis programs that directly conflict with federal classification

**Evidence**: The cannabis rescheduling process initiated by President Biden in October 2022 took over two years from directive to proposed rule, with the timeline driven by inter-agency negotiations rather than the complexity of the scientific analysis.

## Political Economy

### Who Benefits from the Status Quo

| Actor | Benefit | Economic Value | Incentive to Block Reform |
|-------|---------|----------------|---------------------------|
| DEA | Scheduling authority justifies budget, personnel, and enforcement operations | DEA budget: $3.3 billion (FY2024) | Rescheduling reduces enforcement scope and institutional relevance |
| Federal prosecutors | Drug scheduling provides basis for harsh mandatory minimums | ~25% of federal criminal cases are drug-related (DOJ, 2023) | Lower schedules reduce sentencing leverage and plea bargaining power |
| Private prison industry | Drug offenders constitute ~45% of federal prison population | CoreCivic and GEO Group: combined revenue ~$3.8 billion (FY2023) | Fewer Schedule I offenses reduce incarceration volume |
| Pharmaceutical industry | Schedule I status blocks competition from natural and generic alternatives | Cannabis therapeutics market potentially ~$15-20 billion | Natural plant-based medicines threaten patented drug revenues |
| Drug testing industry | Schedule I status for cannabis supports workplace drug testing | Industry revenue ~$5 billion annually (IBISWorld, 2023) | Cannabis rescheduling could undermine employer testing policies |
| Alcohol and tobacco industries | Schedule I cannabis status reduces competition | U.S. alcohol market: ~$285 billion (2023); tobacco: ~$125 billion | Cannabis legalization captures market share from legal substances |

### Perverse Incentives

The DEA's institutional interests are fundamentally misaligned with evidence-based scheduling. The agency's budget, headcount, and political influence are tied to the scope of its enforcement mandate. Rescheduling or descheduling substances reduces the universe of activity that justifies DEA resources. This creates a structural incentive to maintain restrictive classifications even when scientific evidence supports reclassification.

The DEA also administers the quota system that controls the total quantity of controlled substances manufactured in the United States each year. For Schedule I substances, this quota system functions as a supply bottleneck for research. The DEA has historically set cannabis production quotas that are insufficient to meet researcher demand, further impeding the scientific evidence generation needed to support rescheduling.

## Statutory Design Flaws

### Vague and Manipulable Criteria

The CSA's scheduling criteria -- "high potential for abuse," "currently accepted medical use," and "safety for use under medical supervision" -- are defined in terms that allow significant interpretive discretion. The term "abuse" is not defined in the statute and has been interpreted by the DEA to encompass any non-medical use that produces psychoactive effects, a definition so broad that it could technically encompass caffeine or alcohol.

**Evidence**: The DEA's 1992 interpretation of "currently accepted medical use" established a five-part test: (1) the drug's chemistry is known and reproducible; (2) adequate safety studies exist; (3) adequate and well-controlled studies prove efficacy; (4) the drug is accepted by qualified experts; and (5) the scientific evidence is widely available. This test was designed to be virtually impossible to meet for Schedule I substances, since the regulatory barriers imposed by Schedule I classification prevent the very studies the test requires.

### No Mandatory Review Mechanism

The CSA contains no requirement for periodic reassessment of scheduling decisions. Once a substance is scheduled, it remains in that schedule indefinitely unless the DEA initiates rescheduling, responds to a petition, or Congress acts directly. There is no sunset provision, no mandatory scientific review cycle, and no mechanism for automatically updating classifications when new evidence emerges.

**Evidence**: Cannabis has remained in Schedule I for over 50 years despite the Shafer Commission's 1972 recommendation, accumulating medical evidence, and legalization in a majority of states. The average time from rescheduling petition to final DEA action has exceeded 10 years for cannabis-related petitions.

## Cultural and Ideological Factors

### The Prohibition Paradigm

American drug policy has been dominated by a prohibitionist ideology that treats psychoactive substance use as inherently deviant and dangerous. This paradigm -- rooted in the temperance movement, reinforced by racial anxieties, and institutionalized by the War on Drugs -- treats drug scheduling as a tool of moral control rather than public health regulation. Within this paradigm, rescheduling a substance can be perceived as "going soft on drugs" regardless of the scientific evidence.

**Evidence**: When the Obama administration considered cannabis rescheduling, political advisors warned that the action could be portrayed as endorsing drug use, despite the fact that rescheduling would have no direct effect on recreational availability. This political calculus -- the fear of being seen as "soft on drugs" -- has deterred multiple administrations from acting on scientific evidence.

### Racial Dynamics and Selective Enforcement

The scheduling system's racial history creates both institutional inertia and a political dynamic that impedes reform. Communities of color have borne the disproportionate burden of Schedule I enforcement, particularly for cannabis. Reforming the scheduling system implicitly acknowledges the injustice of past enforcement, creating political discomfort for officials who supported or implemented punitive drug policies.

**Evidence**: Black Americans are nearly 4 times more likely to be arrested for cannabis possession than white Americans despite comparable usage rates (ACLU, 2020). The cumulative impact of these arrests -- criminal records, employment barriers, housing restrictions, immigration consequences -- has devastated communities and created a constituency that demands not just rescheduling but expungement, reparations, and structural accountability.

## International Constraints

### Treaty Obligations

The 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs places cannabis in Schedule I and Schedule IV (the most restrictive categories), obligating signatory nations to limit cannabis use to "medical and scientific purposes." The 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances similarly restricts psychedelics. Full descheduling of cannabis from the CSA could create tension with U.S. treaty obligations.

**Evidence**: However, several nations have effectively legalized cannabis while remaining parties to the 1961 Convention. Canada legalized recreational cannabis in 2018 by arguing that its regulatory framework served public health objectives consistent with the Convention's goals. Uruguay took a similar approach in 2013. The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) has criticized these actions but has no enforcement mechanism. Germany legalized in 2024 with an explicit statement that its approach is compatible with treaty obligations.

## Why Reform Has Failed

### Failed Reform Attempt 1: Cannabis Rescheduling Petitions (1972-2020)

Six rescheduling petitions were filed between 1972 and 2020. All were either denied or remained pending for years. The DEA applied its restrictive interpretation of "currently accepted medical use" -- requiring FDA-approval-level evidence that Schedule I restrictions made nearly impossible to generate -- creating a procedural Catch-22 that insulated the classification from scientific correction.

### Failed Reform Attempt 2: Congressional Legislation

Multiple bills to reschedule or deschedule cannabis have been introduced in Congress since 2010, including the MORE Act (passed the House in 2020 and 2022), the STATES Act, and the Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act. None has been enacted into law due to Republican opposition in the Senate, competing legislative priorities, and disagreements among reform advocates about the appropriate framework (rescheduling vs. descheduling vs. comprehensive regulatory reform).

### Failed Reform Attempt 3: Executive Action

Despite growing public support for reform (70% of Americans support cannabis legalization per Gallup, 2023), successive administrations have been reluctant to use executive authority to initiate rescheduling. The Obama administration declined to reschedule. The Biden administration initiated a review in 2022 but the process has proceeded slowly through administrative channels, taking over two years to reach the proposed rule stage.

### Common Thread: Structural Resistance

Each failed reform attempt points to the same underlying dynamic: the scheduling system is structurally designed to resist change. The DEA controls the process and benefits from the status quo. The statutory criteria create evidentiary requirements that Schedule I restrictions prevent from being met. Political leaders fear the "soft on drugs" label. And international treaties provide a convenient justification for inaction. Reform requires either restructuring the system itself -- removing scheduling authority from the DEA, changing the statutory criteria, or creating mandatory review mechanisms -- or overwhelming political pressure that forces action despite structural resistance.
