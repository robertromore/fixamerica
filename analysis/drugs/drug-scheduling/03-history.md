# Drug Scheduling: History

## Historical Development

The federal drug scheduling system did not emerge in a vacuum. It was the product of more than a century of evolving government approaches to drug regulation -- from laissez-faire commerce in patent medicines, through racially motivated prohibition statutes, to the comprehensive framework of the Controlled Substances Act. Understanding this history is essential to comprehending why the scheduling system classifies substances as it does and why reform has been so difficult.

### Pre-Federal Regulation (Pre-1906): The Patent Medicine Era

- **Unregulated Drug Markets**: Throughout the 19th century, opiates, cocaine, cannabis, and other psychoactive substances were widely available without prescription. Patent medicines containing morphine, laudanum, and cocaine were sold openly, including in products marketed for children.
- **Medical Use of Cannabis**: Cannabis was included in the U.S. Pharmacopeia from 1851 to 1942. Physicians prescribed cannabis tinctures for pain, nausea, insomnia, and other conditions. Eli Lilly, Parke-Davis, and other major pharmaceutical firms manufactured cannabis products.
- **Growing Alarm**: By the late 1800s, concern about opiate addiction -- particularly among Civil War veterans and middle-class women who had been prescribed morphine -- led to early calls for regulation.

### Early Federal Drug Control (1906-1937): Racial Politics and Revenue

- **Pure Food and Drug Act (1906)**: Required accurate labeling of drug contents but did not prohibit any substance. Marked the first federal assertion of authority over drug commerce.
- **Harrison Narcotics Tax Act (1914)**: Imposed registration and tax requirements on the manufacture and distribution of opiates and cocaine. Originally a revenue measure, the Harrison Act was progressively interpreted by the Treasury Department and federal courts as a prohibition statute. The Supreme Court in *Webb v. United States* (1919) and *United States v. Behrman* (1922) upheld prosecutions of physicians prescribing opiates to addicted patients, effectively criminalizing maintenance therapy for decades.
- **Racial Motivations**: The Harrison Act was propelled in part by racially charged narratives. Dr. Hamilton Wright, a key architect of federal drug policy, warned Congress about "cocaine-crazed Negroes" and Chinese opium dens. These racialized fears shaped both the political support for drug control and the populations targeted by enforcement.
- **Marihuana Tax Act (1937)**: Imposed a prohibitive tax on cannabis, effectively banning it. Harry Anslinger, head of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics (FBN), led the campaign using sensationalized racial rhetoric, including claims that cannabis caused violence among Mexican immigrants and Black Americans. The American Medical Association opposed the act, arguing it would impede medical research and practice. Congress enacted it over AMA objections.

### The Federal Bureau of Narcotics Era (1937-1970): Anslinger's Legacy

- **Harry Anslinger (1930-1962)**: As FBN Commissioner for 32 years, Anslinger shaped American drug policy around punitive prohibition. He opposed medical approaches to addiction, successfully pushed for harsher penalties, and used racist narratives to generate public support for drug enforcement.
- **Boggs Act (1951)**: Established mandatory minimum sentences for drug offenses -- two years for first offense possession of cannabis or narcotics.
- **Narcotics Control Act (1956)**: Increased penalties further, imposing sentences of 5-20 years for first offense possession and allowing the death penalty for selling heroin to minors.
- **International Treaties**: The 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs consolidated previous international drug control treaties and established a four-schedule classification system administered by the United Nations. Cannabis was placed in Schedule I (most restrictive) and Schedule IV (substances with particularly dangerous properties with limited therapeutic value). The United States was a primary architect of the Convention, and Anslinger personally led the U.S. delegation.
- **1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances**: Extended international controls to psychedelics (LSD, mescaline, psilocybin), amphetamines, and barbiturates, establishing a separate four-schedule system for these substances.

### The Controlled Substances Act (1970): Creating the Modern System

- **Nixon Administration Origins**: The Controlled Substances Act was enacted as Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970 (P.L. 91-513). It replaced the patchwork of prior federal drug laws with a unified five-schedule system.
- **Scientific Design**: The CSA's scheduling criteria were designed to reflect scientific and medical considerations. The five-schedule framework was based on recommendations from a joint AMA-ABA advisory committee and incorporated pharmacological concepts of abuse potential, medical utility, and dependence liability.
- **Political Compromise on Cannabis**: Cannabis was placed in Schedule I as a "temporary" measure. Congress directed the National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Abuse (the Shafer Commission) to study cannabis and recommend appropriate policy. The Shafer Commission's 1972 report, *Marihuana: A Signal of Misunderstanding*, recommended decriminalizing personal use and possession. President Nixon rejected the recommendation and kept cannabis in Schedule I.
- **DEA Creation (1973)**: The DEA was established by executive order, consolidating the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs, the Office for Drug Abuse Law Enforcement, and other agencies. The DEA was given authority to administer the CSA's scheduling provisions.

### The War on Drugs Era (1971-2000): Escalating Penalties and Expanding Schedules

- **Nixon's War on Drugs (1971)**: President Nixon declared drug abuse "public enemy number one." Former Nixon aide John Ehrlichman later acknowledged in a 1994 interview (published in 2016): "The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people... We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities."
- **Emergency Scheduling Authority (1984)**: The Comprehensive Crime Control Act granted the DEA Administrator emergency scheduling authority, allowing temporary placement of substances in Schedule I without the full scientific review process. This authority was first used to schedule MDMA in 1985.
- **MDMA Scheduling Controversy (1985)**: Administrative law judge Francis Young recommended placing MDMA in Schedule III based on evidence of therapeutic potential and relatively low abuse risk. DEA Administrator John Lawn overruled the recommendation and placed MDMA in Schedule I.
- **Crack Cocaine Disparity (1986)**: The Anti-Drug Abuse Act established a 100:1 sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine -- 5 grams of crack triggered the same mandatory minimum sentence as 500 grams of powder cocaine. Because crack cocaine was used disproportionately in Black communities while powder cocaine was used in white communities, this disparity produced massive racial disparities in sentencing.
- **Federal Analogue Act (1986)**: Created a legal framework for prosecuting distribution of "substantially similar" chemical analogues of Schedule I or II substances, addressing the emergence of designer drugs.

### Reform Efforts and Scientific Challenges (2000-2020): Slow Evolution

- **Cannabis Rescheduling Petitions**: Multiple rescheduling petitions were filed and denied:
    - **NORML petition (1972)**: Filed the same year the CSA took effect. DEA denied it in 1989 after 17 years.
    - **Alliance for Cannabis Therapeutics (1995)**: Denied in 2001.
    - **Americans for Safe Access (2002)**: Denied in 2011. D.C. Circuit upheld denial in *Americans for Safe Access v. DEA* (2013).
    - **Governors of Rhode Island and Washington (2011)**: Still pending as of 2020; effectively superseded by Biden administration process.
- **State Cannabis Legalization Wave**: California legalized medical cannabis in 1996 (Proposition 215). Colorado and Washington legalized recreational cannabis in 2012. By 2020, 15 states had legalized recreational use.
- **Cole Memorandum (2013)**: DOJ Deputy Attorney General James Cole issued guidance deprioritizing federal enforcement of cannabis laws in states with robust regulatory systems. Rescinded by Attorney General Sessions in 2018.
- **Fair Sentencing Act (2010)**: Reduced the crack-powder cocaine sentencing disparity from 100:1 to 18:1 but did not eliminate it.
- **FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designations**: FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation to psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression (2018) and major depressive disorder (2019), and to MDMA-assisted therapy for PTSD (2017). These designations signaled significant therapeutic potential for Schedule I substances.
- **Hemp Descheduling (2018)**: The Agriculture Improvement Act (Farm Bill) removed hemp -- defined as cannabis with <0.3% THC -- from the CSA entirely, creating the first legal distinction between forms of the cannabis plant.

---

### The Current Era (2020-Present): Accelerating Reform

- **Oregon Measure 110 (2020)**: Oregon became the first state to decriminalize personal possession of all drugs and redirect cannabis tax revenue to treatment services. The measure was partially rolled back by the legislature in 2024 amid concerns about implementation.
- **Oregon Measure 109 (2020)**: Established a regulated framework for therapeutic psilocybin use -- the first state-level program to legalize a Schedule I psychedelic for supervised therapeutic sessions.
- **Colorado Proposition 122 (2022)**: Legalized personal use and regulated therapeutic access to psilocybin, DMT, ibogaine, and mescaline (non-peyote derived).
- **Biden Administration Cannabis Review (2022-Present)**: President Biden directed HHS and the Attorney General to review cannabis scheduling. HHS recommended Schedule III in August 2023. DEA proposed rescheduling via notice of proposed rulemaking in May 2024.
- **Epidiolex Precedent (2018-2020)**: The FDA approved Epidiolex (cannabidiol) for treatment of certain seizure disorders in 2018. The DEA initially placed it in Schedule V, then fully descheduled it in 2020 after determining it did not meet scheduling criteria. This established a precedent for removing cannabis-derived substances from the CSA.

## Lessons from History

### Pattern 1: Political Override of Scientific Evidence

The scheduling system has repeatedly elevated political and law enforcement considerations over scientific evidence. The Shafer Commission's cannabis recommendations were rejected by Nixon. The DEA overruled its own administrative law judge on MDMA. Multiple cannabis rescheduling petitions were denied despite accumulating medical evidence. This pattern demonstrates that scheduling reform requires not just scientific evidence but political will -- or structural changes that insulate classification decisions from political interference.

### Pattern 2: Racial Motivations Driving Drug Classification

From the Harrison Act's targeting of Chinese opium users and "cocaine-crazed Negroes" to Anslinger's racist cannabis campaigns to the crack-powder sentencing disparity, drug scheduling and enforcement have been intertwined with racial control. The Ehrlichman admission confirmed what scholars had long argued: the War on Drugs was designed to target racial minorities and political dissenters. Any reform that fails to address this legacy risks reproducing it.

### Pattern 3: International Treaties as Domestic Constraints

The United States played a leading role in creating the 1961 and 1971 international drug control conventions, and these treaties now constrain domestic reform. However, Canada, Uruguay, and Germany have demonstrated that signatory nations can effectively legalize cannabis while maintaining nominal treaty compliance. The United States has the diplomatic and legal capacity to navigate treaty obligations if domestic political will exists.

### Pattern 4: Emergency Measures Becoming Permanent

Emergency scheduling authority, created in 1984 as a temporary measure for urgent public safety threats, has become a routine tool for expanding the schedule. Temporary scheduling of fentanyl analogs has been repeatedly extended rather than resolved through permanent administrative or legislative action. This pattern illustrates how expedient enforcement tools can calcify into permanent features of the regulatory landscape.
