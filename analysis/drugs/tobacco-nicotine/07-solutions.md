# Tobacco and Nicotine Policy: Solutions

Reducing tobacco's toll -- 480,000 deaths and $300+ billion in annual costs -- requires a multi-faceted approach that accelerates the decline of combustible tobacco, expands cessation access, establishes a coherent framework for novel nicotine products, and addresses the structural disparities that concentrate tobacco's harms among the most vulnerable populations.

---

## Reform Framework

### Guiding Principles

- End combustible tobacco use as the primary goal, recognizing that cigarettes cause the overwhelming majority of tobacco-related death and disease
- Ground regulation in science, proportioning regulatory burden to product risk along the nicotine continuum
- Protect youth from nicotine initiation while preserving adult access to less harmful alternatives under appropriate controls
- Address racial and socioeconomic disparities that concentrate tobacco's harms among disadvantaged populations
- Invest in cessation as a public health priority, closing the treatment gap for the 28.8 million American adults who currently smoke

### Theory of Change

Combustible tobacco use can be driven below 5% within 15 years through a combination of mutually reinforcing policies: (1) a nicotine reduction standard that makes cigarettes minimally or non-addictive, reducing initiation and facilitating cessation; (2) flavor restrictions that remove the most youth-attractive products from the market; (3) price policies that increase the cost of the most harmful products while keeping cessation treatments affordable; (4) universal cessation coverage that ensures every smoker has access to evidence-based quit support; and (5) a science-based harm reduction framework that provides regulated alternatives for those unable or unwilling to quit nicotine entirely. These policies, implemented together, would create a coherent regulatory continuum that pushes consumers from the most harmful products toward the least harmful options or abstinence.

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Nicotine Reduction Standard for Combustible Cigarettes

**Description**: The FDA would use its existing authority under Section 907 of the Tobacco Control Act to set a product standard reducing nicotine levels in combustible cigarettes to minimally addictive or non-addictive levels (0.3-0.5 mg/g of tobacco filler, compared to the current 10-15 mg/g). This would be the single most transformative tobacco regulatory action possible. A very low nicotine content (VLNC) standard would make cigarettes unable to create or sustain addiction, dramatically reducing initiation among youth and enabling cessation among current smokers.

**Evidence Base**: The FDA-funded Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study and multiple randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that VLNC cigarettes reduce nicotine dependence, cigarettes smoked per day, and nicotine exposure without significant compensatory smoking. Donny et al. (2015) published a landmark trial in the *New England Journal of Medicine* finding that smokers randomized to VLNC cigarettes reduced their cigarette consumption by 50% over six weeks. Modeling by the FDA and academic researchers (Apelberg et al., 2018) estimates that a nicotine reduction standard could prevent 8.5 million smoking-related deaths and 33 million cases of smoking-attributable disease over a multi-decade period.

**Implementation**: The FDA would initiate a proposed rulemaking, followed by a public comment period, finalization, and an implementation timeline of 2-3 years. The standard would apply to all combustible tobacco products sold in the United States.

**Cost/Resources**: Minimal direct government cost (regulatory rulemaking costs absorbed by FDA CTP). Industry compliance costs would be significant but feasible -- tobacco companies already have the technology to produce VLNC cigarettes.

**Timeline**: 1-2 years for rulemaking; 2-3 years for manufacturer compliance; full implementation within 5 years of initiation.

**Challenges**: Industry litigation (Commerce Clause, Fifth Amendment takings claims); potential illicit market for full-nicotine cigarettes; need for complementary cessation support; political opposition from tobacco-state legislators.

**Impact Metrics**: Adult smoking prevalence, cigarettes sold per capita, youth smoking initiation rates, cessation quit rates, nicotine dependence prevalence.

### Solution 2: Comprehensive Menthol and Flavor Restrictions

**Description**: Finalize the FDA's proposed rule banning menthol as a characterizing flavor in cigarettes and prohibiting all characterizing flavors (other than tobacco) in cigars. Simultaneously, extend flavor restrictions to all tobacco and nicotine products sold through general retail channels, while permitting flavored products in adult-only specialty retail environments with enhanced age verification.

**Evidence Base**: The FDA's own regulatory impact analysis (2022) estimated that a menthol ban would lead 923,000 smokers to quit within the first year and prevent 654,000 deaths over 40 years. Canada banned menthol cigarettes in 2017; subsequent research found significant increases in quit attempts among menthol smokers with no substantial illicit market emergence (Chaiton et al., 2020). The European Union's 2020 menthol ban similarly showed positive cessation outcomes across member states.

**Implementation**: Finalize FDA rulemaking; implement with 1-year compliance timeline for manufacturers and retailers; establish illicit market enforcement task force.

**Cost/Resources**: Enforcement costs estimated at $50-100 million annually (FDA/ATF/CBP coordination). Revenue from fines and civil penalties would partially offset costs.

**Timeline**: Finalization and implementation within 2 years.

**Challenges**: Industry litigation; enforcement concerns related to racial equity; cross-border smuggling; political opposition; illicit market monitoring requirements.

**Impact Metrics**: Menthol cigarette sales volume, quit attempts among menthol smokers, Black smoking prevalence, illicit market indicators, youth use of flavored products.

### Solution 3: Federal Tobacco Tax Reform

**Description**: Increase the federal cigarette excise tax from $1.01 to $3.00 per pack, index it to inflation for automatic annual adjustment, and equalize tax rates across all tobacco and nicotine products based on a risk-proportionate framework. Tax combustible products at the highest rate, smokeless tobacco and heated tobacco at a moderate rate, and e-cigarettes and nicotine pouches at a lower rate. Dedicate a minimum of 30% of new revenue to tobacco cessation and prevention programs.

**Evidence Base**: Price increases are the single most effective population-level tool for reducing tobacco consumption. A 10% increase in cigarette prices reduces adult consumption by approximately 4% and youth consumption by approximately 7% (Chaloupka et al., 2012; IARC Handbook of Cancer Prevention, Vol. 14). The World Health Organization recommends that tobacco taxes constitute at least 75% of retail price. The U.S. currently falls far below this threshold. A $2.00/pack increase would prevent an estimated 2.8 million premature smoking-caused deaths among current and future generations (Levy et al., 2018).

**Implementation**: Congressional legislation required. Could be included in broader revenue or health legislation.

**Cost/Resources**: Net revenue positive -- estimated $17-20 billion in additional annual federal revenue at proposed rates, partially offset by declining sales volumes over time.

**Timeline**: Legislative enactment within 1-2 years; implementation 90-180 days after enactment.

**Challenges**: Congressional opposition (tobacco-state delegations, anti-tax coalitions); regressivity concerns; cross-border smuggling; need for companion cessation funding.

**Impact Metrics**: Cigarette sales per capita, smoking prevalence, youth initiation rates, cessation program enrollment, tobacco tax revenue, illicit market indicators.

### Solution 4: Universal Cessation Coverage

**Description**: Require all health insurance plans (private, Medicaid, Medicare, TRICARE, VA) to cover all seven FDA-approved cessation medications and individual, group, and telephone counseling with no prior authorization, no cost-sharing, and no limits on quit attempts per year. Fund a national cessation infrastructure including enhanced quitline services, digital cessation programs, and community-based cessation support in underserved areas.

**Evidence Base**: The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force gives tobacco cessation interventions an "A" recommendation. Combination treatment (medication plus counseling) triples quit rates compared to unaided attempts. The ACA requires private plans to cover cessation, but compliance is inconsistent and access barriers persist. Only 14 states cover all FDA-approved cessation medications plus counseling under Medicaid without barriers (American Lung Association, 2024). Comprehensive cessation coverage generates a return on investment of $2-3 for every $1 spent through reduced healthcare costs (Maciosek et al., 2017).

**Implementation**: CMS rulemaking for Medicaid and Medicare; HHS enforcement of ACA cessation coverage requirements; Congressional appropriation for quitline enhancement.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $2-3 billion annually for comprehensive federal and state cessation infrastructure. Offset by $6-9 billion in reduced healthcare costs within 5-10 years.

**Timeline**: Regulatory actions within 1-2 years; full infrastructure within 3-5 years.

**Challenges**: State Medicaid variability; provider training; reaching populations with the highest smoking rates; integration with behavioral health services.

**Impact Metrics**: Quit attempts using evidence-based treatments, successful quit rate, cessation treatment utilization by demographic group, Medicaid cessation coverage compliance.

### Solution 5: Science-Based Nicotine Product Framework

**Description**: Establish a clear, risk-proportionate regulatory framework for all nicotine products based on the continuum of risk. Streamline the PMTA process for products demonstrated to be significantly less harmful than cigarettes. Create a "modified risk" pathway with transparent standards and reasonable timelines. Authorize appropriately regulated less harmful products as explicit alternatives for adult smokers while maintaining strict youth access controls. Require post-market surveillance for all authorized products.

**Evidence Base**: The UK's approach to e-cigarette regulation -- which treats vaping as a cessation tool and integrates it into the National Health Service -- has contributed to the UK achieving some of the lowest smoking rates in Europe (12.9% in 2023; ONS, 2024). The Swedish snus experience demonstrates that availability of less harmful nicotine alternatives can dramatically reduce combustible tobacco use: Sweden has the lowest male smoking rate in Europe (~6%) and the lowest rates of tobacco-related disease, largely attributed to widespread snus use (Public Health Agency of Sweden, 2023).

**Implementation**: FDA rulemaking to establish clear PMTA and modified risk standards; Congressional appropriation for enhanced review capacity.

**Cost/Resources**: $200-300 million additional annual CTP funding for expanded review capacity.

**Timeline**: Regulatory framework within 2-3 years; ongoing product review.

**Challenges**: Balancing youth protection with adult access; industry gaming of modified risk claims; public distrust of tobacco companies; evolving science on long-term effects of novel products.

**Impact Metrics**: PMTA review timelines, number of authorized reduced-risk products, dual use rates, combustible-to-alternative switching rates, youth use of authorized vs. unauthorized products.

### Solution 6: Tobacco Retail Licensing and Density Reduction

**Description**: Establish a federal tobacco retail license requirement (analogous to alcohol retail licensing) with annual fees, compliance obligations, and revocation authority for violations. Provide grants to states and localities to reduce tobacco retail density, particularly in low-income communities and near schools. Cap the number of tobacco retail licenses based on population and geographic criteria.

**Evidence Base**: An estimated 300,000+ retail locations in the U.S. sell tobacco products -- more than the combined number of McDonald's, Starbucks, and Walmart locations. High tobacco retail density is associated with higher smoking rates, increased youth access, and greater difficulty quitting (Cantrell et al., 2015). Communities with higher tobacco outlet density have 13% higher smoking prevalence than those with lower density (Finan et al., 2019). Tobacco retail licensing has been successfully implemented at the local level (San Francisco, New York City, and others) and provides an enforcement mechanism for age verification, flavor restrictions, and marketing limitations.

**Implementation**: Federal legislation establishing the licensing framework; state and local implementation with federal grants and technical assistance.

**Cost/Resources**: Net revenue positive -- license fees would cover administrative costs. Federal grants of $100-200 million annually for state density reduction programs.

**Timeline**: Legislative enactment within 2-3 years; phased implementation over 5 years.

**Challenges**: Retailer opposition; small business impacts; equitable implementation; federal-state coordination.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of licensed tobacco retailers, retail density by neighborhood income/demographics, youth purchase attempt success rate, retailer compliance rates.

### Solution 7: Targeted Youth Prevention and Education

**Description**: Expand funding for evidence-based youth tobacco and nicotine prevention programs. Continue and enhance the FDA's "Real Cost" campaign with updated messaging about e-cigarettes and nicotine pouches. Integrate tobacco and nicotine education into school curricula using programs with demonstrated effectiveness. Fund peer-led prevention initiatives and social media counter-marketing targeting youth.

**Evidence Base**: The "Real Cost" campaign, launched in 2014, has been credited with preventing an estimated 587,000 youth from initiating smoking between 2014 and 2016 (Farrelly et al., 2017). Truth Initiative's truth campaign has demonstrated sustained effectiveness in changing youth attitudes toward tobacco. Evidence-based school programs (e.g., Project Towards No Tobacco Use) have shown significant reductions in youth initiation when implemented with fidelity.

**Implementation**: Increased CTP funding for prevention campaigns; CDC grants for school-based programs; partnership with social media platforms for counter-marketing.

**Cost/Resources**: $300-500 million annually for comprehensive youth prevention (currently under-funded).

**Timeline**: Program expansion within 1-2 years; ongoing.

**Challenges**: Keeping messaging current with evolving products; reaching at-risk youth; competing with industry marketing; digital platform cooperation.

**Impact Metrics**: Youth tobacco/nicotine use rates (NYTS), campaign awareness and attitude metrics, school program implementation fidelity, youth purchase attempt rates.

## International Models

### United Kingdom: Pragmatic Harm Reduction

**Description**: The UK has adopted a more permissive approach to e-cigarettes than the U.S., actively promoting vaping as a cessation tool through the National Health Service (NHS). Public Health England (now Office for Health Improvement and Disparities) concluded in 2015 that e-cigarettes are approximately 95% less harmful than smoking, and this position has been maintained. E-cigarettes are available on NHS prescription in some regions, and "swap to stop" programs distribute free vape starter kits to smokers.

**Results**: Adult smoking rates in the UK declined from 20.2% in 2011 to 12.9% in 2023. Youth vaping has increased but at lower rates than in the U.S., partly due to stricter nicotine concentration limits (20 mg/mL vs. 50+ mg/mL in U.S. products). The UK is now pursuing a generational smoking ban (Tobacco and Vapes Bill) that would progressively raise the legal smoking age, eventually ending cigarette sales entirely.

**Applicability to U.S.**: The UK model demonstrates that e-cigarette harm reduction can coexist with declining smoking rates. However, the UK has a single-payer healthcare system that enables integrated cessation support, stricter nicotine limits, and different advertising regulations. The U.S. would need to adapt these approaches to its more fragmented regulatory and healthcare landscape.

### Sweden: The Snus Model

**Description**: Sweden has the lowest male smoking rate in Europe (~6%) and the lowest rates of lung cancer and cardiovascular disease among European nations, largely attributed to widespread use of Swedish snus (moist, pasteurized smokeless tobacco). Sweden demonstrates that transitioning a population from combustible tobacco to less harmful oral nicotine products can produce dramatic public health benefits.

**Results**: Male daily smoking declined from 23% in 1990 to 6% in 2023. Male lung cancer rates are approximately 40% lower than the European average. Sweden is expected to achieve "smoke-free" status (below 5% daily smoking) by 2025 for both sexes.

**Applicability to U.S.**: The Swedish experience supports risk-proportionate regulation and suggests that oral nicotine products (snus, pouches) can serve as effective combustible alternatives. However, Swedish snus manufacturing standards differ from U.S. smokeless tobacco, and cultural factors limit direct comparability. The U.S. could apply lessons about product standards and regulatory frameworks while adapting to its unique market conditions.

### Canada: Menthol Ban Implementation

**Description**: Canada banned menthol cigarettes nationally in October 2017. The ban was implemented through Health Canada regulations and applied to all menthol cigarettes, blunts, and most smokeless tobacco products.

**Results**: Studies found that approximately 21% of Canadian menthol smokers reported quitting after the ban, significantly higher than quit rates among non-menthol smokers during the same period (Chaiton et al., 2020). No significant illicit menthol market emerged. The ban demonstrated that menthol restrictions are implementable and effective.

**Applicability to U.S.**: Canada's experience directly informs the U.S. menthol ban debate. The absence of a large illicit market post-ban counters one of the primary opposition arguments. However, the U.S. menthol market is larger in absolute terms and more racially concentrated, requiring additional attention to equity and enforcement design.

### Australia: Plain Packaging

**Description**: Australia became the first country to implement plain (standardized) tobacco packaging in December 2012. All cigarette packages use the same drab olive-brown color with large graphic health warnings, brand name in standardized font, and no logos or promotional imagery.

**Results**: Post-implementation studies found significant increases in calls to quitlines, negative perceptions of cigarette packages, and reduced brand appeal. Australian daily smoking rates declined from 15.1% (2010) to 10.6% (2019). While multiple factors contributed, plain packaging was associated with reduced brand attachment and increased cessation motivation (Wakefield et al., 2015).

**Applicability to U.S.**: The U.S. has not implemented plain packaging and faces First Amendment challenges that did not apply in Australia. However, the Tobacco Control Act authorizes graphic health warnings, which the FDA proposed in 2020 (covering 50% of the front and back of cigarette packages). These warnings have been delayed by industry litigation.

## Pilot Programs and Demonstrations

- **California Tobacco Control Program (CTCP)**: California's comprehensive tobacco control program, funded by Proposition 99 (1988) and later Proposition 56 (2016), has been one of the most successful state-level programs. Between 1988 and 2020, California prevented an estimated 1.8 million smoking-attributable deaths and saved over $134 billion in healthcare costs (Pierce et al., 2019). The program's combination of media campaigns, cessation services, clean air laws, and community-based interventions provides a model for national scale-up.

- **NYC Tobacco Control**: New York City reduced adult smoking from 21.5% (2002) to 12.8% (2020) through aggressive policies including high tobacco taxes ($1.50/pack local tax on top of state and federal), smoke-free air laws, free nicotine replacement therapy distribution, and graphic anti-smoking campaigns. The city's approach demonstrates the power of combining multiple interventions.

- **VLNC Cigarette Clinical Trials**: Multiple FDA-funded clinical trials have tested very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes. The Project 1 trial (Donny et al., 2015) and subsequent studies demonstrated that VLNC cigarettes reduce dependence and cigarette consumption without significant compensatory behavior, providing the evidence base for a federal nicotine reduction standard.
