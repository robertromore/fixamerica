# Tobacco and Nicotine Policy: Overview

## Overview

Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, responsible for approximately 480,000 deaths annually -- more than alcohol, illegal drugs, motor vehicle accidents, firearms, and HIV combined. Cigarette smoking alone costs the nation an estimated $240 billion per year in direct medical care and $185 billion in lost productivity, totaling more than $300 billion in annual economic burden. Despite six decades of anti-smoking efforts that reduced adult cigarette smoking from 42.4% in 1965 to 11.6% in 2023, tobacco use continues to exact a staggering toll, particularly among low-income populations, racial and ethnic minorities, those with mental health conditions, and LGBTQ+ communities.

The regulatory landscape shifted fundamentally in 2009 when the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act granted the FDA authority to regulate the manufacturing, marketing, and distribution of tobacco products. This authority has been tested repeatedly by the rapid emergence of new nicotine delivery systems -- electronic cigarettes, nicotine pouches, heated tobacco products -- that complicate the traditional public health consensus around tobacco control. The youth vaping epidemic that surged between 2017 and 2020, driven largely by JUUL's high-nicotine salt pods and later by disposable flavored devices, demonstrated the FDA's struggle to exercise its regulatory authority at the pace of product innovation.

The proposed ban on menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars, first announced by the FDA in April 2022 and then delayed repeatedly, illustrates the intersection of public health, racial equity, and political economy that defines modern tobacco policy. Menthol cigarettes account for approximately 37% of the U.S. cigarette market and are used by 85% of Black smokers, a disparity rooted in decades of targeted industry marketing. A menthol ban could prevent an estimated 654,000 deaths over 40 years according to FDA modeling, yet the proposal has faced opposition from both industry and some civil rights organizations concerned about enforcement-driven criminalization.

At the heart of tobacco and nicotine policy lies a profound tension: the imperative to eliminate combustible tobacco use, which causes nearly all tobacco-related death and disease, while navigating the uncertain promise and risks of novel nicotine products that may help adult smokers quit but also threaten to addict a new generation. The concept of a "nicotine continuum of risk" -- with combustible cigarettes at the most dangerous end and FDA-approved cessation medications at the safest -- has gained traction among public health researchers, but translating this framework into coherent regulatory policy remains an ongoing challenge.

## Scope

This analysis covers the key aspects of tobacco and nicotine policy:

- **FDA Tobacco Regulation**: The Tobacco Control Act of 2009, premarket tobacco product applications (PMTAs), the Center for Tobacco Products, enforcement actions, and regulatory gaps
- **E-Cigarettes and Vaping**: The youth vaping epidemic, JUUL litigation and settlements, disposable device proliferation, flavor restrictions, and the modified risk framework
- **Menthol and Flavored Products**: The proposed menthol cigarette ban, racial equity dimensions, flavored cigar restrictions, and state-level flavor bans
- **Tobacco Harm Reduction**: The nicotine continuum of risk, heated tobacco products (IQOS), nicotine pouches (Zyn), smokeless tobacco, and the Swedish snus model
- **Smoking Cessation**: FDA-approved cessation medications, quitline infrastructure, insurance coverage mandates, and the treatment gap
- **Tobacco Taxation and Economics**: Federal and state excise taxes, the Master Settlement Agreement, industry economics, and illicit trade concerns

## Key Facts

| Annual economic cost of smoking | $300+ billion ($240B medical, $185B productivity) | CDC, 2024 |
| Adult cigarette smoking rate (2023) | 11.6% (~28.8 million adults) | NHIS/CDC, 2024 |
| High school students currently using e-cigarettes (2024) | 5.9% (~890,000 students) | NYTS/FDA, 2024 |
| High school students currently using any tobacco product (2024) | 10.0% (~1.51 million) | NYTS/FDA, 2024 |
| Menthol cigarette market share | ~37% of U.S. cigarette market | FTC Cigarette Report, 2023 |

| Deaths preventable from menthol ban (40-year estimate) | 654,000 | FDA Regulatory Impact Analysis, 2022 |

## Core Tensions and Tradeoffs

- **Harm Reduction vs. Abstinence**: Should policy encourage adult smokers to switch to less harmful nicotine products (e-cigarettes, pouches, heated tobacco), or should the goal be eliminating all nicotine dependence? Harm reduction could save lives faster but risks normalizing nicotine use and creating new addictions.

- **Youth Protection vs. Adult Access**: Restricting flavored e-cigarettes and nicotine products reduces youth initiation but also removes options that may help adult smokers quit combustible cigarettes. Every flavor restriction must balance these competing interests.

- **Racial Equity vs. Enforcement Risk**: A menthol cigarette ban would address decades of predatory marketing to Black communities and save hundreds of thousands of Black lives, but enforcement could create new opportunities for racially disparate policing of individual users or illicit markets.

- **Regulatory Speed vs. Scientific Certainty**: The FDA's premarket review process is scientifically rigorous but has been too slow to address rapidly proliferating products. More than 26 million product applications remain in various stages of review while unauthorized products flood the market.

- **Federal Authority vs. State Innovation**: States like California, Massachusetts, and New York have enacted flavor bans and other tobacco regulations that exceed federal standards. The question of whether FDA authority should set a floor or a ceiling for state regulation has significant implications for policy experimentation.

- **Industry Transformation vs. Industry Accountability**: Major tobacco companies are investing heavily in "reduced risk" products and positioning themselves as partners in harm reduction. Whether to engage with or resist this industry pivot is a defining question for public health advocates.

## Key Questions

1. How should the FDA regulate novel nicotine products to protect youth while preserving potential adult harm reduction benefits?
2. Can the menthol cigarette ban be implemented in a way that achieves public health goals without creating racially disparate enforcement outcomes?
3. What is the appropriate role of tobacco harm reduction in a comprehensive regulatory framework, and how should the nicotine continuum of risk be translated into product standards?
4. How can the tobacco treatment gap be closed so that the majority of the 28.8 million American smokers who want to quit have access to evidence-based cessation support?

## Vision of Success

A successful tobacco and nicotine policy in the 21st century would feature:

- **Combustible Tobacco Elimination**: Adult cigarette smoking rates reduced below 5% within 15 years through a combination of nicotine reduction standards, flavor restrictions, cessation support, and price policies
- **Youth Nicotine Use Below 3%**: Comprehensive enforcement of age verification, flavor restrictions on products appealing to youth, and evidence-based prevention programs keeping youth tobacco and nicotine use at minimal levels
- **Universal Cessation Access**: Every smoker who wants to quit has access to FDA-approved cessation medications and behavioral counseling at no out-of-pocket cost, with quitline and digital cessation services available in all 50 states
- **Evidence-Based Harm Reduction**: A clear, science-driven regulatory framework that permits less harmful nicotine products for adult smokers under strict marketing and access controls while preventing youth uptake
- **Equity-Centered Enforcement**: Tobacco regulations designed and enforced in ways that address historical disparities without creating new vectors for racially discriminatory policing
