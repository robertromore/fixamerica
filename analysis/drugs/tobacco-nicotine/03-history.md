# Tobacco and Nicotine Policy: History

## Historical Development

The history of tobacco regulation in the United States is a story of an industry that wielded extraordinary political power for centuries, a public health catastrophe that unfolded in slow motion, and a regulatory framework that arrived decades after the science was settled. From colonial cash crop to the leading cause of preventable death, tobacco's trajectory reveals recurring patterns of industry deception, regulatory capture, and hard-won public health victories.

### Colonial Era to Industrial Revolution (1600s-1890s): Tobacco as Economic Foundation

- **Colonial Cash Crop**: Tobacco was the first major cash crop of the English colonies. Virginia's economy was built on tobacco cultivation beginning in 1612 when John Rolfe developed a commercially viable strain. Tobacco served as currency in several colonies and was central to the establishment of the plantation economy and chattel slavery.

- **Early Industry Growth**: By the mid-19th century, tobacco was consumed primarily as chewing tobacco, snuff, cigars, and pipe tobacco. The invention of the cigarette-rolling machine by James Bonsack in 1881 transformed the industry. James Buchanan Duke used the Bonsack machine to mass-produce cigarettes at his American Tobacco Company, reducing the cost from hand-rolled luxury to mass-market commodity.

- **First Regulatory Efforts**: Several states banned cigarette sales in the late 19th and early 20th centuries on moral and health grounds (15 states had bans between 1890 and 1927), but these were repealed by the 1920s as cigarette smoking became culturally normalized and tobacco tax revenue became important to state budgets.

### The Cigarette Century (1900-1963): Mass Adoption and Growing Evidence

- **World War I and II Normalization**: Cigarettes were included in soldiers' ration kits during both World Wars, creating millions of new smokers and cementing cigarettes as a cultural norm. By 1950, adult per-capita cigarette consumption had risen to approximately 3,500 cigarettes per year.

- **Early Scientific Warnings**: In 1950, landmark epidemiological studies by Ernst Wynder and Evarts Graham (published in JAMA) and Richard Doll and A. Bradford Hill (published in BMJ) established a statistical link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer. Reader's Digest published "Cancer by the Carton" in 1952, bringing the findings to a mass audience.

- **Industry Response -- The Doubt Campaign**: On December 15, 1953, executives from the major tobacco companies met at the Plaza Hotel in New York and hired the public relations firm Hill & Knowlton. On January 4, 1954, they published the "Frank Statement to Cigarette Smokers" in 448 newspapers, pledging to investigate health concerns through the newly created Tobacco Industry Research Committee (TIRC). Internal documents later revealed this was a deliberate strategy to manufacture scientific doubt. As a Brown & Williamson memo stated: "Doubt is our product since it is the best means of competing with the 'body of fact' that exists in the mind of the general public."

- **Filter Cigarettes and "Light" Marketing**: In response to health concerns, the industry introduced filter-tip cigarettes and eventually "light" and "low-tar" brands -- changes later shown to provide no health benefit but which successfully reassured smokers and delayed quitting.

### The Surgeon General and the Regulatory Era (1964-1997): Confirming the Science, Building a Framework

- **1964 Surgeon General's Report**: On January 11, 1964, Surgeon General Luther Terry released *Smoking and Health: Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General*, concluding that cigarette smoking caused lung cancer in men and was a probable cause in women. The report, based on over 7,000 scientific studies, is one of the most consequential public health documents in American history.

- **Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (1965)**: Required the warning "Caution: Cigarette Smoking May Be Hazardous to Your Health" on all cigarette packages. The law also preempted state and local warning label requirements, effectively providing the industry with a uniform national standard that shielded it from more aggressive state regulations.

- **Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act (1970)**: Banned cigarette advertising on television and radio, effective January 2, 1971. Strengthened the warning label to: "Warning: The Surgeon General Has Determined That Cigarette Smoking Is Dangerous to Your Health."

- **Anti-Smoking Movement Growth (1970s-1980s)**: The non-smokers' rights movement gained momentum. Arizona became the first state to restrict smoking in public places (1973). Airlines progressively banned smoking on flights (completed by 1990). The 1986 Surgeon General's report established that secondhand smoke caused lung cancer in nonsmokers.

- **Comprehensive Smoking Education Act (1984)**: Required four rotating warnings on cigarette packages, replacing the single warning used since 1965.

- **Smokeless Tobacco Restrictions (1986)**: The Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act banned smokeless tobacco advertising on television and radio and required warning labels.

- **Synar Amendment (1992)**: Required states to enact and enforce laws prohibiting the sale of tobacco products to minors under age 18 as a condition of receiving federal Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant funds.

- **EPA Classification (1993)**: The Environmental Protection Agency classified environmental tobacco smoke (secondhand smoke) as a Group A carcinogen -- a known human carcinogen. The tobacco industry sued to block the classification but ultimately lost.

- **FDA Attempt at Regulation (1996)**: Under Commissioner David Kessler, the FDA declared nicotine an addictive drug and cigarettes a drug delivery device, proposing comprehensive regulation including restrictions on youth access and marketing. The tobacco industry challenged the rule, and in *FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.*, 529 U.S. 120 (2000), the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that Congress had not granted the FDA authority to regulate tobacco products.

### The Settlement Era and Industry Accountability (1994-2009): Litigation, Exposure, and the MSA

- **The Whistleblowers**: In 1994, Dr. Jeffrey Wigand, former vice president of research at Brown & Williamson, revealed to *60 Minutes* and in congressional testimony that the company had knowingly concealed the addictive nature of nicotine and manipulated nicotine delivery. His testimony shattered the industry's decades-long claim that the health effects of smoking were uncertain.

- **Congressional Testimony (1994)**: On April 14, 1994, the CEOs of the seven largest tobacco companies testified before the House Subcommittee on Health and the Environment. Each swore under oath that nicotine was not addictive. This testimony, later contradicted by internal documents, became an iconic image of corporate deception.

- **State Litigation**: Beginning in 1994, state attorneys general sued tobacco companies to recover Medicaid costs of treating smoking-related illness. Mississippi filed the first suit (1994), followed by Minnesota, Texas, Florida, and eventually 46 states.

- **Master Settlement Agreement (1998)**: On November 23, 1998, 46 states, 5 U.S. territories, and D.C. reached the MSA with Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, Brown & Williamson, and Lorillard. The MSA required the companies to pay more than $200 billion over 25 years, restricted advertising (including banning billboard and transit ads, cartoon characters like Joe Camel, and merchandise branding), dissolved tobacco industry front groups (TIRC, CTR, Tobacco Institute), and created the American Legacy Foundation (now Truth Initiative). The four remaining states (Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi, Texas) settled individually for an additional ~$40 billion.

- **DOJ RICO Case (1999-2006)**: The U.S. Department of Justice filed a civil racketeering lawsuit under RICO against the major tobacco companies. In *United States v. Philip Morris USA, Inc.* (2006), Judge Gladys Kessler found that the companies had engaged in a decades-long conspiracy to deceive the public about the health effects of smoking, the addictiveness of nicotine, and the health effects of secondhand smoke. The companies were ordered to publish "corrective statements" in newspapers and on cigarette packaging (implementation delayed until 2017).

### FDA Authority and the E-Cigarette Revolution (2009-Present): Regulation Meets Innovation

- **Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (2009)**: Signed by President Obama on June 22, 2009, this landmark law finally granted the FDA authority to regulate tobacco products. The act created the Center for Tobacco Products (CTP), banned characterizing flavors in cigarettes (except menthol and tobacco), required larger graphic health warnings, restricted marketing to youth, established the substantial equivalence and PMTA pathways for new products, and authorized product standards including nicotine reduction.

- **E-Cigarette Emergence (2007-2015)**: The first commercial e-cigarettes entered the U.S. market around 2007. Early "cig-a-like" devices gained modest market share. The vaping industry grew rapidly, with vape shops proliferating across the country. The FDA initially attempted to regulate e-cigarettes as drug delivery devices but was blocked by the D.C. Circuit in *Sottera, Inc. v. FDA* (2010), which held that e-cigarettes were tobacco products, not drugs.

- **Deeming Rule (2016)**: The FDA finalized the "Deeming Rule" extending its regulatory authority to all tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, cigars, hookah tobacco, and pipe tobacco. Products already on the market were required to submit PMTAs by August 2022 (after multiple deadline extensions).

- **JUUL and the Youth Vaping Epidemic (2015-2020)**: JUUL Labs launched in 2015 with a sleek, USB-shaped device using nicotine salt technology that delivered nicotine at levels comparable to combustible cigarettes (5% concentration by weight). Aggressive social media marketing and youth-oriented flavors (Mango, Mint, Fruit) drove explosive growth. JUUL captured approximately 75% of the U.S. e-cigarette market by late 2018. Altria (Philip Morris USA's parent) acquired a 35% stake in JUUL for $12.8 billion in December 2018.

- **Regulatory Response to Youth Vaping**: In September 2018, then-FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb issued enforcement actions against e-cigarette retailers and demanded JUUL and other manufacturers submit plans to address youth use. In 2020, the FDA issued guidance prioritizing enforcement against unauthorized flavored cartridge-based e-cigarettes (excluding tobacco and menthol flavors). JUUL voluntarily pulled flavored pods from retail in November 2018 and later discontinued mint flavor in November 2019.

- **EVALI Crisis (2019)**: In late 2019, a nationwide outbreak of e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) hospitalized 2,807 patients and killed 68 people. The outbreak was ultimately linked to vitamin E acetate, an additive in illicit THC vaping products, not commercial nicotine e-cigarettes. However, the crisis significantly increased public concern about all vaping products.

- **Tobacco 21 (2019)**: On December 20, 2019, President Trump signed legislation raising the federal minimum age for tobacco and nicotine product sales from 18 to 21, applicable to all products including e-cigarettes. The law, known as Tobacco 21 or T21, had bipartisan support and was supported by both public health groups and the tobacco industry (which viewed it as an alternative to flavor bans).

- **JUUL Accountability (2022-2024)**: In June 2022, the FDA issued a marketing denial order for all JUUL products, though this was immediately stayed pending judicial review. JUUL settled with 10,000 plaintiffs and multiple state attorneys general, paying over $2.4 billion in total settlements by 2024. The FTC sued JUUL in 2023 for marketing its products to youth.

- **Menthol Rule Stalled (2022-2025)**: The FDA published proposed rules banning menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars in April 2022. After the public comment period closed in July 2022, OMB delayed action on the final rule. As of early 2025, the rule has not been finalized.

## Lessons from History

### Pattern 1: Industry Deception and Regulatory Lag

The most consistent pattern in tobacco history is the enormous gap between scientific evidence and regulatory action. The causal link between smoking and lung cancer was established by 1950, but meaningful federal regulation did not arrive until 1965 (warning labels), with comprehensive FDA authority delayed until 2009 -- nearly six decades. At every stage, the tobacco industry used its political and economic power to delay, dilute, and defeat regulation. This pattern is now repeating with e-cigarettes and novel nicotine products, where regulatory frameworks lag years behind product innovation.

### Pattern 2: Litigation as a Regulatory Substitute

When legislative and regulatory pathways were blocked by industry lobbying, litigation served as an alternative mechanism for accountability and information disclosure. The state attorney general lawsuits of the 1990s, the DOJ RICO case, and the JUUL settlements all extracted financial penalties and, crucially, forced disclosure of internal industry documents that transformed public understanding. Litigation has been most effective when it combines financial penalties with mandatory behavioral changes (marketing restrictions, document disclosure).

### Pattern 3: The Youth Protection Frame as Political Driver

Historically, the most successful tobacco regulations have been framed around protecting children and adolescents. Warning labels, advertising bans, age restrictions, and flavor limitations all gained political traction by emphasizing youth vulnerability. The youth vaping epidemic accelerated FDA enforcement and produced Tobacco 21 within months. This framing is powerful but can obscure adult health needs and create a regulatory framework overly focused on youth access rather than product harm.

### Pattern 4: State Innovation Preceding Federal Action

States have consistently led federal action on tobacco control. State clean indoor air laws preceded federal standards. State lawsuits preceded federal litigation. State flavor bans preceded federal proposals. California's aggressive tobacco control program (funded by Proposition 99 in 1988) demonstrated the effectiveness of comprehensive approaches years before the federal government adopted them. This pattern suggests that state-level innovation will continue to drive the frontier of tobacco policy.
