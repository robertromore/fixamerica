# Tobacco and Nicotine Policy: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

The roadmap for comprehensive tobacco and nicotine reform follows a three-phase strategy designed to build political momentum, demonstrate results, and establish the institutional infrastructure necessary for long-term transformation. Phase 1 focuses on regulatory actions achievable under existing FDA authority and high-priority legislative wins. Phase 2 advances the transformative policies -- particularly the nicotine reduction standard -- that require sustained political commitment and expanded institutional capacity. Phase 3 completes the transition to a tobacco endgame framework, dramatically reducing combustible tobacco use and establishing the U.S. as a global leader in tobacco control.

Each phase builds on the preceding one: early enforcement and cessation actions reduce youth initiation and support current smokers, creating a more favorable political environment for the structural reforms that follow.

## Phase 1: Foundation and Enforcement (Years 1-2)

### Objectives

- Finalize and implement the menthol cigarette and flavored cigar ban
- Enforce existing marketing authorization requirements against unauthorized e-cigarettes
- Increase the federal cigarette excise tax and establish inflation indexing
- Expand cessation coverage and fund state quitline enhancement
- Strengthen Tobacco 21 enforcement nationwide

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Finalize menthol cigarette/flavored cigar rule | FDA/CTP | Months 1-12 | Existing FDA authority; legal defense resources | Rule published in Federal Register |
| Launch illicit market enforcement task force | FDA, ATF, CBP | Months 3-12 | $50M first-year allocation; interagency coordination | Task force operational; seizure data |
| Enforce PMTA requirements against top 20 unauthorized disposable e-cigarette brands | FDA/CTP | Months 1-18 | Enhanced CTP enforcement staff ($30M) | Warning letters, injunctions, import alerts issued |
| Enact federal tobacco tax increase ($1.01 to $3.00/pack) | Congress | Months 1-18 | Legislative action; CBO scoring | Legislation signed |
| Issue CMS guidance requiring comprehensive Medicaid cessation coverage | CMS | Months 3-12 | Existing regulatory authority | Guidance issued; state compliance monitoring |
| Fund quitline enhancement and digital cessation programs | SAMHSA/CDC | Months 6-18 | $200M supplemental appropriation | Quitline call volume; digital program enrollment |
| National Tobacco 21 compliance check program | FDA/CTP | Months 1-24 | $20M annual allocation | Retailer compliance rate >90% |

### Legislative Requirements

- Federal cigarette excise tax increase and inflation indexing (Congressional action)
- Supplemental appropriation for cessation infrastructure and enforcement ($300M)
- Codification of menthol ban enforcement provisions (individual possession exemption)

### Expected Outcomes

Phase 1 should achieve: finalization of the menthol rule (the most significant single tobacco regulatory action since the Tobacco Control Act); measurable reduction in unauthorized e-cigarette availability; increased quit attempts among menthol smokers; higher cessation treatment utilization; and >90% Tobacco 21 retailer compliance. Expected 500,000+ additional quit attempts in the first year of menthol ban implementation.

## Phase 2: Structural Reform (Years 3-5)

### Objectives

- Propose and advance the nicotine reduction standard for combustible cigarettes
- Establish a federal tobacco retail licensing system
- Create a streamlined FDA modified risk product pathway
- Implement graphic health warnings on cigarette packages
- Fund tobacco prevention and cessation at CDC-recommended levels

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Publish proposed nicotine reduction standard (NPRM) | FDA/CTP | Year 3 | Regulatory science data; legal resources | NPRM published; public comment period opened |
| Finalize nicotine reduction standard | FDA/CTP | Year 4-5 | Legal defense preparation ($50M reserve) | Final rule published |
| Enact federal tobacco retail licensing legislation | Congress | Year 3-4 | Legislative action; state implementation grants | Legislation signed |
| Implement retail licensing at state level | States (federal grants) | Years 3-5 | $150M in federal grants to states | Licensing systems operational in 40+ states |
| Finalize and implement graphic health warnings | FDA/CTP | Year 3-4 | Rule finalization (currently in litigation) | Warnings appearing on cigarette packs |
| Establish modified risk product review pathway with clear standards | FDA/CTP | Year 3 | Rulemaking; additional CTP staff ($100M) | Published standards; reduced review timelines |
| Increase annual tobacco prevention/cessation funding to $3.3B (CDC-recommended) | Congress/States | Years 3-5 | Annual appropriations | Funding reaches recommended level |

### Legislative Requirements

- Federal Tobacco Retail Licensing Act
- Appropriations to reach CDC-recommended cessation/prevention funding levels
- Possible legislation strengthening FDA authority against litigation challenges to PMTA process

### Expected Outcomes

Phase 2 should achieve: a proposed or finalized nicotine reduction standard (the most consequential tobacco regulatory action in history); establishment of a retail licensing infrastructure that provides enforcement mechanisms for all tobacco regulations; graphic health warnings on cigarette packages; and a doubling of cessation treatment utilization. Adult smoking prevalence projected to decline to 7-8% by end of Phase 2.

## Phase 3: Tobacco Endgame (Years 6-10)

### Objectives

- Implement the nicotine reduction standard for all combustible tobacco products
- Reduce adult smoking prevalence below 5%
- Achieve 50% reduction in tobacco retail density through licensing
- Evaluate and implement generational smoking age restrictions
- Establish the U.S. as a global leader in tobacco endgame policy

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Full implementation of nicotine reduction standard | FDA/CTP; manufacturers | Years 6-7 | Manufacturer compliance monitoring; enforcement | All combustible cigarettes meet VLNC standard |
| Reduce tobacco retail density by 50% | States/localities (federal support) | Years 6-10 | Continued grant funding; zoning authority | Retail outlet reduction measured by licensing data |
| Evaluate generational smoking ban (UK model) | Congress/FDA | Years 7-10 | Policy analysis; public consultation | Evaluation report; legislative proposal if warranted |
| Comprehensive post-market surveillance of novel nicotine products | FDA/CTP | Years 6-10 | $100M annual surveillance budget | Long-term health outcome data for authorized products |
| Establish permanent tobacco research and surveillance infrastructure | NIH/FDA/CDC | Years 6-10 | $500M annual research budget | Continuous evidence base for policy refinement |

### Expected Outcomes

Phase 3 should achieve: adult smoking prevalence below 5% (the widely used "tobacco endgame" threshold); dramatic reductions in smoking-attributable mortality beginning to manifest in cancer, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease statistics; a coherent nicotine product regulatory framework that permits less harmful alternatives under strict controls; and a tobacco retail environment that no longer normalizes combustible tobacco use. The U.S. would join New Zealand, the UK, and Scandinavia as a global leader in tobacco endgame policy.

## Governance and Oversight

**Federal oversight**: The HHS Secretary should designate a Tobacco Endgame Coordinator with authority to convene FDA, CDC, CMS, SAMHSA, NIH, ATF, and CBP in an interagency working group. This group would meet quarterly to assess progress, coordinate enforcement, and identify emerging challenges.

**Congressional oversight**: The House Energy and Commerce Committee and Senate HELP Committee should hold annual oversight hearings on tobacco regulatory progress, with FDA CTP providing formal progress reports against the roadmap milestones.

**Independent evaluation**: GAO should conduct biennial evaluations of the tobacco control program's effectiveness, cost-efficiency, and equity outcomes. An external scientific advisory committee (modeled on the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee, or TPSAC) should provide ongoing guidance on product standards and regulatory priorities.

**State coordination**: A federal-state tobacco control coordination body should be established to share best practices, harmonize enforcement, and monitor illicit market indicators.

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Industry Litigation Delays Nicotine Reduction Standard

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Build an extensive administrative record during rulemaking; engage with constitutional law scholars to develop robust legal defenses; conduct multiple rounds of public input to strengthen the rule's procedural foundation. Prepare for multi-circuit litigation and potential Supreme Court review.

**Contingency Plan**: If the nicotine reduction standard is enjoined, accelerate alternative strategies (menthol ban, tax increases, cessation expansion) that achieve incremental reductions while the legal process unfolds.

### Risk 2: Illicit Market Undermines Menthol Ban Effectiveness

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Pre-position the illicit market enforcement task force before the menthol ban takes effect. Implement robust monitoring systems (retail audits, border surveillance, online sales tracking). Coordinate with Canadian and Mexican authorities on cross-border enforcement.

**Contingency Plan**: Adjust enforcement resources based on real-time market monitoring data. If illicit market indicators exceed thresholds, increase enforcement intensity and evaluate additional supply chain interventions.

### Risk 3: Political Reversal Under New Administration

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Advance regulations to final rule stage as quickly as possible; Congressional codification of key policies (menthol ban, tax reform, Tobacco 21 enforcement) provides more durable protection than executive action alone. Build bipartisan support by emphasizing youth protection and fiscal responsibility.

**Contingency Plan**: State-level advocacy to maintain and advance tobacco control policies regardless of federal action. Support for states to adopt California/Massachusetts-style comprehensive programs.

### Risk 4: Novel Nicotine Products Create New Public Health Challenges

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Maintain robust post-market surveillance of all authorized nicotine products. Fund longitudinal research on health effects. Preserve FDA authority to modify or revoke marketing authorizations based on new evidence. Monitor youth use patterns continuously through annual NYTS data.

**Contingency Plan**: If new products show unexpected health risks or youth uptake, FDA can issue emergency enforcement actions and modify marketing authorizations under existing authority.
