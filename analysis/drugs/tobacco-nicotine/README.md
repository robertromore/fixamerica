# Tobacco and Nicotine Policy

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of U.S. tobacco and nicotine regulation, covering combustible cigarettes, e-cigarettes and vaping products, smokeless tobacco, nicotine pouches, heated tobacco products, and smoking cessation policy.

## Overview

Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, killing approximately 480,000 Americans annually and costing more than $300 billion per year in direct medical care and lost productivity. Despite decades of progress -- adult smoking rates declined from 42.4% in 1965 to 11.6% in 2023 -- the tobacco and nicotine landscape has been transformed by the rapid proliferation of e-cigarettes and novel nicotine products that present new regulatory challenges.

The regulatory framework is anchored in the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009, which granted the FDA authority over tobacco products for the first time. However, the FDA has struggled to keep pace with product innovation, particularly the explosion of disposable flavored vaping devices that fueled a youth nicotine epidemic beginning in 2017. The JUUL controversy, the proposed menthol cigarette ban, the rise of nicotine pouches like Zyn, and the emergence of heated tobacco products have created a complex regulatory environment where public health goals, industry innovation, individual liberty, and racial equity concerns all intersect.

This analysis examines the full scope of tobacco and nicotine policy, from the Master Settlement Agreement and tobacco taxation to FDA premarket review, youth access prevention, and the evolving science of tobacco harm reduction. It explores the tension between reducing combustible tobacco use -- which causes the vast majority of tobacco-related death -- and the uncertain long-term risks of newer nicotine delivery systems.
