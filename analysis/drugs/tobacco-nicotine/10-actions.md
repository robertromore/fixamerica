# Tobacco and Nicotine Policy: What You Can Do

Tobacco use kills 480,000 Americans every year -- more than any other preventable cause of death. While the regulatory framework has grown stronger over the past two decades, critical policy battles remain, from the stalled menthol ban to the nicotine reduction standard to cessation funding. Citizen engagement has been pivotal at every stage of tobacco control progress, from the campaign for smoke-free workplaces to the passage of Tobacco 21.

- Follow **Truth Initiative** research and prevention updates: <https://truthinitiative.org/>
- Read the **American Lung Association's "State of Tobacco Control"** annual report to understand how your state ranks on tobacco control policies: <https://www.lung.org/research/sotc>

### Make Personal Changes

- If you smoke, call **1-800-QUIT-NOW** (the national quitline) or visit **smokefree.gov** to access free cessation support, including text-based coaching and information about FDA-approved medications
- Talk to your healthcare provider about cessation options, including combination therapy (medication plus counseling), which triples quit rates compared to unaided attempts

- Make your home and car completely smoke-free to protect family members from secondhand smoke exposure
- If you are a parent or educator, have evidence-based conversations with young people about nicotine addiction -- avoid scare tactics and focus on the neuroscience of addiction and industry manipulation

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact Your Representatives**: Urge your U.S. Senators and Representative to support tobacco tax increases, cessation funding, and FDA enforcement authority
- **Submit Public Comments**: When FDA proposes tobacco regulations (menthol ban, nicotine standard, graphic warnings), submit comments during the public comment period via regulations.gov
- **Write Letters to the Editor**: Respond to local coverage of tobacco and vaping issues with evidence-based perspectives; emphasize the 480,000 annual deaths and the industry's history of targeting vulnerable populations
- **Share Information**: Use social media to amplify tobacco control research and advocacy, particularly around key dates like the Great American Smokeout (third Thursday of November) and World No Tobacco Day (May 31)

## Political Actions

- When the FDA proposes or finalizes tobacco regulations (menthol ban, nicotine reduction standard, graphic health warnings)

**What to Say - Template Email**:

```
Subject: Support FDA Tobacco Regulation to Save Lives

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

As your constituent in [City, State], I am writing to urge your support for strong tobacco and nicotine regulation. Tobacco use kills 480,000 Americans every year and costs our healthcare system $240 billion. In our state, [X]% of adults still smoke, and tobacco-related healthcare costs total $[X] billion annually.

I urge you to:
1. Support the FDA's authority to finalize the menthol cigarette ban, which would prevent an estimated 654,000 deaths
2. Increase the federal cigarette excise tax, which has not been raised since 2009 and has lost 30% of its real value to inflation
3. Fund tobacco prevention and cessation programs at CDC-recommended levels ($3.3 billion/year)

These are evidence-based policies that will save lives and reduce healthcare costs. I ask you to stand with public health and not with the tobacco industry.

Thank you for your service and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say - Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City]. I'm calling about tobacco regulation. I urge the [Representative/Senator] to support the FDA's menthol cigarette ban and to increase funding for tobacco cessation programs. Tobacco kills 480,000 Americans every year, and we need stronger action. Can you please note my position?"
```

### Support Legislation

Current or proposed legislation to support:

- **Menthol cigarette ban (FDA proposed rule)**: Contact the White House and your members of Congress to urge finalization -- the rule has been delayed since 2022
- **Federal tobacco tax increase**: Support legislation to increase the federal cigarette excise tax from $1.01 to $3.00+ per pack and index to inflation
- **Tobacco-Free Youth Act**: Support any legislation strengthening FDA enforcement against unauthorized e-cigarettes and enhancing Tobacco 21 compliance
- **QUIT Act** (or similar cessation coverage legislation): Support legislation requiring comprehensive cessation coverage under all federal health insurance programs without barriers
- **State-level flavor bans**: Support comprehensive flavored tobacco product bans in your state legislature

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "Do you support the FDA's authority to ban menthol cigarettes and flavored cigars? What is your plan to address tobacco companies' targeting of Black communities?"
2. "Will you support increasing the federal cigarette excise tax, which has not been raised since 2009?"
3. "Do you commit to funding tobacco cessation and prevention programs at CDC-recommended levels?"
4. "What will you do to enforce existing laws against unauthorized e-cigarettes being sold to youth?"

**Voting Considerations**:

- Check candidates' positions on tobacco industry campaign contributions -- candidates who accept tobacco money may be less likely to support strong regulation
- Look for endorsements from public health organizations (American Cancer Society CAN, American Lung Association)
- Pay attention to positions on the House Energy and Commerce Committee and Senate HELP Committee, which have primary jurisdiction over FDA tobacco regulation

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing tobacco policy with others, emphasize:

1. **The death toll**: Tobacco kills 480,000 Americans every year -- that is more than COVID-19 killed in its worst year, and it happens every single year. No other consumer product comes close.

2. **Industry deception**: The tobacco industry lied about the health effects of smoking for 50 years, engineered cigarettes to be more addictive, and deliberately targeted children, Black Americans, and other vulnerable populations. This history demands robust regulation.

3. **Solutions exist**: We know how to reduce tobacco use -- through price increases, flavor restrictions, cessation support, marketing limitations, and product standards. What has been lacking is political will, not scientific knowledge.

4. **The investment case**: Every $1 invested in tobacco cessation returns $2-3 in reduced healthcare costs. The 480,000 annual deaths and $300+ billion in annual costs are preventable with adequate investment.

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "Smoking is a free choice" | 95% of smokers started before age 21; 70% want to quit but cannot due to addiction designed by the industry | SAMHSA, 2024; CDC, 2024 |
| "E-cigarettes are just as dangerous as cigarettes" | While not risk-free, e-cigarettes expose users to significantly fewer toxicants than combustible cigarettes; the vast majority of tobacco-related death comes from smoking | National Academies, 2018 |
| "The menthol ban will lead to Prohibition-style enforcement" | The proposed rule targets manufacturers and retailers, not individual consumers; Canada banned menthol in 2017 with no significant enforcement issues | FDA, 2022; Health Canada, 2023 |
| "Tobacco taxes don't work because people are addicted" | A 10% price increase reduces adult smoking by 4% and youth smoking by 7%; low-income smokers are the most price-responsive | Chaloupka et al., 2012 |
| "The tobacco problem is solved -- smoking rates are low" | 28.8 million Americans still smoke, and 480,000 die every year; smoking remains the #1 preventable cause of death | CDC, 2024 |
