# Tobacco and Nicotine Policy: Stakeholders

The tobacco and nicotine policy landscape is shaped by the interactions of several key groups, each with distinct interests, resources, and levels of political power. The dynamics among tobacco companies, regulators, public health organizations, retailers, and affected populations determine the pace and direction of policy change.

## Who Is Affected

### Primary Stakeholders

| Group | Impact | Size | Key Interests |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|
| Current adult smokers | Health consequences, addiction, financial burden | ~28.8 million adults (11.6% of adult population) | Access to cessation support, affordable alternatives, freedom of choice |
| Youth and young adults (12-25) | Nicotine initiation risk, brain development impacts | ~74 million | Protection from addictive products, accurate health information |
| People with mental illness | Disproportionate smoking rates (~25% vs. 11.6% general) | ~13 million adults with serious mental illness | Integrated cessation services, accessible treatment |
| Black/African American smokers | Menthol targeting, higher lung cancer mortality | ~4.5 million Black adults who smoke | End of menthol cigarette marketing, equitable enforcement |
| Low-income smokers | Higher smoking rates, financial burden of addiction | ~8 million adults below poverty who smoke | Affordable cessation, reduced cost barriers |
| Families of smokers | Secondhand smoke exposure, caregiver loss | Tens of millions (including ~5 million children exposed to secondhand smoke) | Smoke-free environments, cessation support for family members |

### Secondary Stakeholders

- **Healthcare providers**: Physicians, nurses, dentists, and pharmacists who treat smoking-related disease and provide cessation counseling. The healthcare system spends $240 billion annually on smoking-attributable medical care (CDC, 2024).
- **Employers**: Bear productivity losses estimated at $185 billion annually from smoking-related absenteeism, presenteeism, and premature mortality (CDC, 2024).
- **Military and veteran populations**: Historically high smoking rates due to military culture, stress, and tobacco company targeting. The VA spends approximately $6.4 billion annually on smoking-related healthcare (VA, 2024).
- **LGBTQ+ communities**: Higher smoking rates (~20%) due to targeted marketing, minority stress, and social environments. Tobacco industry documents reveal deliberate marketing strategies targeting LGBTQ+ consumers through bar promotions and community event sponsorships.
- **Tobacco farmers**: Approximately 10,000 U.S. tobacco farms, primarily in Kentucky, North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee, and Georgia, employ workers and support rural economies.

## Who Has Power

### Decision Makers

| Actor | Role | Authority | Resources | Influence Level |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| FDA Center for Tobacco Products | Regulates manufacturing, marketing, sale of tobacco products | Tobacco Control Act authority; PMTA review; product standards | $712 million budget (FY2024); ~1,100 staff | High |
| U.S. Congress | Enacts tobacco legislation, sets tax rates, funds programs | Legislative authority; appropriations power | N/A | High |
| State legislatures | Set state tobacco taxes, clean air laws, age requirements | State regulatory authority | Varies by state | High (aggregate) |
| FTC | Monitors cigarette/smokeless advertising and marketing | FCLAA reporting requirements | Limited tobacco-specific resources | Medium |
| CDC Office on Smoking and Health | Funds surveillance, prevention campaigns, quitlines | Grant authority; BRFSS/NHIS data collection | ~$236 million budget (FY2024) | Medium |
| State Attorneys General | Enforce MSA, pursue litigation | MSA enforcement; consumer protection authority | State litigation resources | Medium-High |

### Key Organizations and Institutions

- **Altria Group (Philip Morris USA)**: The largest U.S. tobacco company, with approximately 44% of the domestic cigarette market (Marlboro). Altria also holds a 35% stake in JUUL Labs (written down to near-zero) and investments in cannabis company Cronos. Revenue: $20.5 billion (2023). Altria is the most politically active tobacco company in the U.S., with extensive lobbying operations in Washington and state capitals.

- **Reynolds American (British American Tobacco subsidiary)**: Second-largest U.S. cigarette company with approximately 25% market share (Camel, Newport, Natural American Spirit). Also markets Vuse e-cigarettes, which hold the largest share of the authorized e-cigarette market. Parent company BAT is headquartered in London.

- **Philip Morris International (PMI)**: The international tobacco company (separated from Altria in 2008) that markets IQOS heated tobacco globally. PMI acquired Swedish Match (maker of Zyn nicotine pouches) for $16 billion in 2022, making it a major player in the U.S. smokeless and pouch market. PMI has publicly committed to a "smoke-free future" but continues to sell combustible cigarettes in most markets.

- **JUUL Labs**: Once the dominant e-cigarette company (75% U.S. market share in 2018), JUUL has been reduced to a much smaller market presence after regulatory actions, litigation, and public backlash. The company has paid over $2.4 billion in settlements related to youth marketing claims.

- **Truth Initiative (formerly American Legacy Foundation)**: Created by the Master Settlement Agreement, Truth Initiative operates the truth anti-tobacco campaign, conducts research, and advocates for tobacco control policy. Funded by MSA proceeds and grants.

- **Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids**: The leading U.S. tobacco control advocacy organization, active in federal and state policy, international tobacco control, and FDA regulatory proceedings.

- **American Cancer Society / Cancer Action Network**: Major health advocacy organization that lobbies for tobacco control legislation, cessation funding, and cancer research.

- **American Lung Association**: Advocates for clean air laws, cessation coverage, and FDA regulatory action. Publishes the annual "State of Tobacco Control" report.

### Influencers

- **Tobacco harm reduction advocates**: Organizations like the Consumer Advocates for Smoke-free Alternatives Association (CASAA) and researchers at institutions like the New York University College of Global Public Health argue for policies that facilitate switching from combustible to less harmful nicotine products. They oppose blanket flavor bans and support risk-proportionate regulation.

- **African American Tobacco Control Leadership Council (AATCLC)**: Advocates specifically for the menthol cigarette ban, arguing that menthol has been used as a tool of racial exploitation. Led by Dr. Phillip Gardiner, AATCLC has been the most prominent voice connecting tobacco control to racial justice.

- **Convenience store and retail associations**: The National Association of Convenience Stores (NACS) and state retail associations lobby against flavor bans, tax increases, and regulations that affect tobacco retail. Tobacco products account for approximately 36% of in-store sales at convenience stores.

- **Tobacco-state Congressional delegations**: Members of Congress from Kentucky, Virginia, North Carolina, and other tobacco-growing states often oppose aggressive tobacco regulation, regardless of party affiliation.

## Stakeholder Interests and Alignment

### Aligned Interests (Potential Coalition Partners)

| Coalition | Shared Interest | Strength |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Public health organizations + AATCLC + FDA | Menthol cigarette ban to reduce deaths and address racial disparities | Strong |
| Pediatricians (AAP) + parents + schools + FDA | Youth nicotine prevention, e-cigarette restrictions | Strong |
| Cancer/lung/heart associations + cessation advocates + insurers | Expanded cessation coverage, reduced smoking rates | Strong |
| Harm reduction advocates + some public health researchers + nicotine product manufacturers | Risk-proportionate regulation that permits less harmful alternatives | Moderate |
| State AGs + public health groups + tax advocates | Higher tobacco taxes to fund prevention and reduce consumption | Moderate |

### Conflicting Interests

- **Menthol ban divide**: Public health organizations and AATCLC strongly support a menthol ban, but some civil liberties organizations (e.g., ACLU) and African American advocacy groups (e.g., National Association of Black Law Enforcement Officers, Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network) have expressed concern about enforcement creating new vectors for racially discriminatory policing of individual users.

- **Harm reduction vs. abstinence**: Public health organizations are deeply divided on whether to embrace nicotine harm reduction (permitting e-cigarettes and pouches as less harmful alternatives) or maintain a traditional abstinence-oriented framework. Groups like the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids oppose flavored e-cigarettes and most novel nicotine products, while others argue these products can save lives if properly regulated.

- **Industry "transformation" skepticism**: Tobacco companies claim to be transitioning toward "smoke-free" futures, but public health advocates are deeply skeptical given the industry's documented history of deception. Whether to engage with or resist the industry's harm reduction pivot divides the tobacco control community.

- **State revenue vs. public health**: State governments benefit financially from tobacco revenue ($27.3 billion/year) while also bearing the healthcare costs of tobacco use. This tension manifests in inadequate tobacco control funding -- states spend only 22.6% of CDC-recommended levels on prevention and cessation.

### The Tobacco Iron Triangle

The tobacco policy space features a classic "iron triangle" of mutually reinforcing relationships:

1. **Tobacco industry** provides campaign contributions and lobbying dollars to legislators while paying user fees that fund the FDA and excise taxes that fund state budgets
2. **Legislative allies** protect the industry from aggressive regulation, maintain favorable tax structures, and influence FDA oversight priorities
3. **Regulatory agencies** operate within the constraints set by Congress and are funded (in the case of the FDA CTP) by the industry they regulate, creating structural incentive for managed regulation rather than transformative action

## Influence Mechanisms

How stakeholders exert influence on tobacco and nicotine policy:

- **Lobbying**: The tobacco industry spent approximately $24.7 million on federal lobbying in 2023 across all companies and trade associations. Key lobbying firms include Covington & Burling (Altria), Squire Patton Boggs (RAI), and Arnold & Porter. State-level lobbying is extensive but less well tracked (OpenSecrets, 2024).

- **Campaign Contributions**: Tobacco industry political action committees and employees contributed approximately $5.2 million to federal candidates in the 2024 election cycle, with roughly 70% going to Republican candidates. State-level contributions are significant in tobacco-growing states (OpenSecrets, 2024).

- **Revolving Door**: Former government officials regularly transition to tobacco company or trade association positions. Former FDA officials have joined tobacco companies, and former state legislators have become industry lobbyists.

- **Litigation**: The tobacco and e-cigarette industries aggressively litigate against FDA regulatory actions. Multiple circuit courts have vacated or stayed FDA marketing denial orders, and the threat of litigation shapes FDA regulatory decisions. Industry-funded legal challenges have delayed the menthol ban, modified PMTA standards, and created regulatory uncertainty.

- **Public Advocacy and Astroturfing**: The tobacco industry funds organizations that present industry positions as grassroots advocacy. Examples include the National Smokers Alliance (defunct) and some harm reduction organizations that receive industry funding. The e-cigarette industry has cultivated online communities of adult vapers who advocate against flavor bans and strict regulation.

- **Expertise and Information Control**: Tobacco companies fund research, sponsor academic conferences, and provide data to regulators. While the Tobacco Control Act prohibited tobacco companies from making health claims without FDA authorization, the industry continues to shape the scientific discourse through funded research and expert witnesses.
