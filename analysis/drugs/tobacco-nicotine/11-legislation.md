# Tobacco and Nicotine Policy: Legislation

## Overview

The legislative approach to tobacco and nicotine reform builds on the existing framework established by the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009 while addressing critical gaps in FDA authority, taxation, cessation funding, and enforcement. The strategy is primarily federal, reflecting the interstate nature of tobacco commerce and the need for a uniform national floor, but includes state model legislation to address areas where state innovation leads federal action. No constitutional amendments are required; existing Commerce Clause and taxing authority provide adequate constitutional basis for all proposed legislation.

---

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments required for this reform.* The federal government's authority to regulate tobacco products rests on well-established Commerce Clause jurisprudence (tobacco is manufactured and sold in interstate commerce) and the taxing power. The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009 was enacted under these powers, and its constitutionality has not been challenged. First Amendment considerations apply to restrictions on commercial speech (marketing, labeling), but the Supreme Court has upheld content-neutral restrictions on tobacco advertising and warnings as consistent with the commercial speech doctrine.

119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To strengthen the regulation of tobacco and nicotine products, increase
the federal tobacco excise tax, expand smoking cessation coverage, and
establish a federal tobacco retail licensing system.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Comprehensive Tobacco Control and
Cessation Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
    (2024), tobacco use kills approximately 480,000 Americans annually
    and costs the nation more than $300 billion per year in direct
    medical care and lost productivity.

(2) According to the National Health Interview Survey (2024),
    approximately 28.8 million American adults currently smoke
    cigarettes, with smoking rates concentrated among low-income
    populations (21.6%), persons with serious mental illness
    (approximately 25%), and American Indian/Alaska Native
    populations (22.6%).

(3) Menthol cigarettes account for approximately 37 percent of the
    United States cigarette market and are used by approximately
    85 percent of Black smokers, a disparity rooted in decades of
    targeted industry marketing.

(4) The Food and Drug Administration has estimated that prohibiting
    menthol as a characterizing flavor in cigarettes would lead
    923,000 smokers to quit within the first year and prevent
    654,000 deaths over 40 years.

(5) The federal cigarette excise tax has not been increased since
    2009 and has lost approximately 30 percent of its real value to
    inflation, reducing its effectiveness as a public health tool.

(6) States collectively spend only $745 million annually on tobacco
    prevention and cessation -- just 22.6 percent of the
    $3,300,000,000 recommended by the Centers for Disease Control
    and Prevention.

(7) Approximately 70 percent of adult smokers wish to quit, but
    only 31 percent of quit attempts use evidence-based cessation
    treatments, and only 14 State Medicaid programs cover all 7
    FDA-approved cessation medications plus counseling without barriers.

TITLE I -- MENTHOL AND FLAVOR RESTRICTIONS

              section 1(f)(3) for the calendar year, determined
              by substituting 'calendar year 2026' for 'calendar
              year 2016' in subparagraph (A)(ii) thereof.
    "(2) ROUNDING.-- Any increase determined under paragraph (1)
         shall be rounded to the nearest cent."

(c) EQUALIZATION OF NICOTINE PRODUCT TAXES.-- The Secretary of the
    Treasury shall, not later than 1 year after the date of enactment
    of this Act, promulgate regulations establishing excise tax rates
    for electronic nicotine delivery systems, nicotine pouches, and

```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Title I (Menthol)**: Closes the menthol loophole in the 2009 Tobacco Control Act by striking the menthol exemption from Section 907. The 18-month rulemaking deadline forces FDA to finalize the long-delayed menthol rule. The enforcement limitation (Section 101(c)) directly addresses concerns about racially discriminatory enforcement by prohibiting any enforcement against individual consumers.

- **Title II (Tax Reform)**: Triples the federal cigarette excise tax and adds inflation indexing to prevent future erosion. The risk-proportionate tax structure (Section 201(c)) establishes the principle that less harmful products should bear lower tax burdens, incentivizing switching from combustible cigarettes to alternatives.

- **Title III (Cessation Coverage)**: Makes comprehensive cessation coverage a mandatory Medicaid benefit, closing the gap that leaves millions of low-income smokers without adequate cessation support. Strengthens private insurance and Medicare cessation coverage requirements.

- **Title IV (Retail Licensing)**: Creates the first federal tobacco retail licensing system, providing a foundational enforcement mechanism for all tobacco regulations -- including age verification, flavor restrictions, and product authorization requirements.

- **Title V (Funding)**: Authorizes a ramp-up to CDC-recommended cessation and prevention funding levels ($3.3 billion/year), with dedicated funding from tobacco tax revenue.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Act takes effect (general) | 180 days after enactment | All parties |
| New tax rates effective | 180 days after enactment | Treasury/IRS |
| Menthol rule finalized | 18 months after enactment | FDA |
| CMS issues Medicaid cessation guidance | 180 days after enactment | CMS |
| Private insurance cessation guidance | 180 days after enactment | HHS |
| Retail licensing system operational | 1 year after enactment | FDA |
| Nicotine product tax regulations | 1 year after enactment | Treasury |
| State cessation grants disbursed | FY2027 (first cycle) | CDC |

**Regulatory Authority**: The FDA Center for Tobacco Products administers tobacco product regulation, including the menthol rule and retail licensing. The Treasury Department/IRS administers excise tax collection. CMS administers Medicaid and Medicare cessation requirements.

**Challenges**:

- **Tobacco-state Congressional opposition**: Legislators from Kentucky, Virginia, and North Carolina may oppose tax increases and the menthol ban
- **Industry litigation**: Certain provisions may face First Amendment (commercial speech), Commerce Clause, or Administrative Procedure Act challenges
- **State implementation variability**: Medicaid cessation coverage and retail licensing implementation will vary by state

**Refinements**:

- **Phase-in option**: If political constraints require compromise, the tax increase could be phased in over 3 years ($1.01 to $1.67 to $2.33 to $3.00)
- **Small retailer exemption**: Retail licensing fees could be reduced or waived for small businesses in underserved areas to prevent disproportionate impact
- **Illicit market monitoring**: Add a statutory requirement for annual ATF/FDA reports on illicit tobacco market indicators

## State Model Legislation

### Model State Comprehensive Tobacco Control Act

**Purpose**: To establish a comprehensive state-level tobacco control framework including flavor restrictions, retail licensing, enhanced taxation, and cessation funding for states that wish to exceed federal minimums.

3. **Retail Licensing Regulations**: FDA rulemaking to establish application procedures, compliance standards, and enforcement protocols for the federal tobacco retail license. Deadline: 1 year after enactment.
4. **Medicaid Cessation Coverage**: CMS State Medicaid Director letter and regulatory guidance ensuring compliance with the mandatory cessation benefit. Deadline: 180 days after enactment.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Civil Penalties**: Ranging from $1,000 to $50,000 per violation for retailers; up to $10,000 per day for unlicensed retail sales
- **Administrative Actions**: License suspension (30+ days for 3 violations in 36 months); license revocation (5 violations in 60 months)
- **Private Right of Action**: No private right of action created under this legislation; enforcement is administrative
- **Criminal Penalties**: None for individual consumers. Criminal penalties (existing under 18 U.S.C. Section 2342 et seq.) continue to apply to tobacco trafficking and tax evasion

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Commerce Clause Authority**: The federal government's authority to regulate tobacco products under the Commerce Clause is well-established. Tobacco is manufactured and sold in interstate commerce, and Congress has regulated it through multiple statutes since 1965. The Tobacco Control Act of 2009 was enacted under Commerce Clause authority and has not been subject to constitutional challenge on this basis.

**First Amendment (Commercial Speech)**: Restrictions on tobacco marketing and labeling implicate the First Amendment's protection of commercial speech under *Central Hudson Gas & Electric Corp. v. Public Service Commission*, 447 U.S. 557 (1980). The government must demonstrate that restrictions directly advance a substantial government interest and are not more extensive than necessary. Courts have upheld many tobacco marketing restrictions but struck down some graphic warning requirements. The Comprehensive Tobacco Control and Cessation Act's provisions focus on product standards and sales restrictions rather than speech restrictions, reducing First Amendment vulnerability.

**Taxing Power**: Congress's authority to levy excise taxes on tobacco products is established and unchallenged. The proposed tax increase and inflation indexing are well within Congressional taxing authority.

### Preemption

The Tobacco Control Act includes a complex preemption framework. Section 916 preserves state and local authority to adopt additional or more stringent requirements in areas not specifically preempted, including taxation, clean indoor air laws, age restrictions, and retail licensing. However, states are preempted from establishing product standards that differ from FDA standards for the same product category. The Comprehensive Tobacco Control and Cessation Act would preserve existing state authority and explicitly authorize state flavor bans that exceed the federal standard.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Enforcement relies on a multi-agency framework: FDA CTP for product regulation and retail compliance, Treasury/IRS for tax collection, ATF for trafficking enforcement, and CBP for import controls on unauthorized products. The retail licensing system creates a new enforcement mechanism that enables license suspension and revocation -- a more powerful tool than civil money penalties alone.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| Flavor definition ambiguity | Manufacturers reformulate products with flavoring compounds that fall outside the "characterizing flavor" definition, using sub-threshold levels of multiple flavors | High | Define "characterizing flavor" to include any detectable flavor other than tobacco as determined by an expert panel; authorize FDA to designate specific compounds as prohibited flavoring agents |
| Online and cross-border sales | Consumers purchase menthol cigarettes or flavored products online from out-of-state or international sellers, bypassing retail restrictions | Medium | Strengthen PACT Act enforcement for online tobacco sales; increase CBP interdiction of unauthorized tobacco imports; coordinate with states on enforcement |
| Retail license transfer/evasion | Retailers evade license suspension by transferring the license to a family member or associate operating from the same location | Medium | Prohibit license transfer to any person with a familial or financial relationship to the suspended licensee; apply suspension to the physical location, not just the license holder |
| Tax rate arbitrage between product categories | Manufacturers reformulate products (e.g., creating pipe tobacco blends that function as cigarette tobacco) to qualify for lower tax rates | Medium | Grant Treasury authority to reclassify products based on actual use patterns; establish anti-avoidance provisions |
| "Dual use" undermining cessation | Smokers use the availability of harm reduction products as a reason to continue smoking rather than quit, claiming they are "cutting down" | Low | Fund public education campaigns clarifying that complete cessation is the health goal; require cessation counseling referral at point of sale for harm reduction products |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| Illicit market emergence | Some consumers will seek menthol and flavored products through illicit channels | Demand for prohibited products persists among addicted users | Pre-position enforcement task force; fund monitoring systems; direct enforcement at supply chain, not consumers |
| State implementation variability | Cessation coverage and retail licensing quality will vary across states | Federalism constraints; variable state capacity | Provide robust federal grants, technical assistance, and minimum standards |
| Transition hardship for convenience stores | Small retailers dependent on tobacco revenue may face economic hardship | Tobacco accounts for ~36% of convenience store sales | Phase in restrictions; provide small business transition grants; license fee waivers for small businesses |
| FDA capacity constraints | The FDA CTP may lack the capacity to administer the retail licensing system while also managing PMTA review and enforcement | CTP staffing has not kept pace with expanded responsibilities | Authorize and fund CTP expansion to 2,000+ FTEs |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Strengthen flavor definition**: Amend the Act within 2 years to define "characterizing flavor" using a sensory evaluation standard (as used by the EU) rather than relying solely on ingredient lists
2. **Enhance online enforcement**: Direct ATF and CBP to establish a joint task force for online and cross-border tobacco sales enforcement within 6 months of enactment
3. **Location-based license suspension**: Amend the retail licensing provisions to apply suspensions to the physical premises, not just the named licensee
4. **Anti-avoidance provision**: Grant Treasury Secretary explicit authority to reclassify tobacco products for tax purposes based on consumer use patterns and product characteristics, not just manufacturer labeling
5. **Annual loophole review**: Require FDA to submit an annual report to Congress identifying emerging loopholes and recommending legislative or regulatory fixes

### Sunset and Review Provisions

The Act should include a 10-year reauthorization requirement for the cessation funding provisions (Title V) to ensure Congressional review and adjustment. The tax rates and retail licensing provisions should not sunset, as stability is essential for enforcement and industry planning. However, a mandatory GAO evaluation at years 3, 5, and 10 should assess program effectiveness and recommend modifications.
