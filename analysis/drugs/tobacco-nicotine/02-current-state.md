# Tobacco and Nicotine Policy: Current State

## Smoking Prevalence and Trends

### Adult Cigarette Smoking

Adult cigarette smoking in the United States has declined substantially over the past six decades but remains a major public health challenge. The 2023 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) found that 11.6% of U.S. adults (approximately 28.8 million people) currently smoked cigarettes, down from 20.9% in 2005 and 42.4% in 1965 (CDC, 2024). However, the pace of decline has slowed in recent years, and significant disparities persist.

| Demographic Group | Smoking Rate (2023) | Trend (2018-2023) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| All adults (18+) | 11.6% | Declining | NHIS/CDC, 2024 |
| Men | 13.1% | Declining | NHIS/CDC, 2024 |
| Women | 10.1% | Declining | NHIS/CDC, 2024 |
| Adults below poverty level | 21.6% | Slowly declining | NHIS/CDC, 2024 |
| Adults with GED | 31.2% | Stable | NHIS/CDC, 2024 |
| Adults with graduate degree | 3.7% | Declining | NHIS/CDC, 2024 |
| American Indian/Alaska Native | 22.6% | Stable | NHIS/CDC, 2024 |
| Adults with mental illness | ~25% | Slowly declining | SAMHSA NSDUH, 2024 |
| LGBTQ+ adults | ~20% | Slowly declining | NHIS/CDC, 2024 |

### Disparities in Smoking

Smoking prevalence varies dramatically by socioeconomic status, education, geography, and mental health status. Adults living below the poverty line smoke at nearly six times the rate of those with graduate degrees (21.6% vs. 3.7%). Rural residents smoke at higher rates than urban residents (15.4% vs. 10.6%). Adults with serious mental illness consume approximately 30% of all cigarettes sold in the United States despite comprising roughly 5% of the adult population (SAMHSA, 2024).

Geographic variation is pronounced. States with the highest adult smoking rates include West Virginia (23.8%), Kentucky (22.6%), and Mississippi (20.1%), while the lowest rates are found in Utah (7.1%), California (8.1%), and Connecticut (8.6%) (CDC BRFSS, 2023).

### Cigarette Consumption

Total U.S. cigarette consumption has fallen from a peak of 640 billion cigarettes in 1981 to approximately 196 billion in 2023 (USDA ERS, 2024). Per-capita consumption among adults fell from approximately 4,300 cigarettes per year in 1965 to under 1,000 in 2023. The U.S. cigarette market generated approximately $95 billion in retail sales in 2023 (Euromonitor International, 2024).

## Youth Tobacco and Nicotine Use

### Current Youth Use Rates

The 2024 National Youth Tobacco Survey (NYTS), conducted by the FDA and CDC, found that 2.25 million U.S. middle and high school students currently used a tobacco product (FDA/CDC, 2024).

| Product | High School (2024) | Middle School (2024) | Trend (2020-2024) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Any tobacco product | 10.0% (~1.51M) | 4.7% (~740K) | Declining | NYTS/FDA, 2024 |
| E-cigarettes | 5.9% (~890K) | 3.2% (~500K) | Declining from 2020 peak | NYTS/FDA, 2024 |
| Cigarettes | 1.7% | 1.0% | Declining | NYTS/FDA, 2024 |
| Cigars | 1.5% | 0.6% | Stable | NYTS/FDA, 2024 |
| Smokeless tobacco | 1.3% | 0.8% | Stable | NYTS/FDA, 2024 |
| Nicotine pouches | 1.5% | 0.6% | Increasing | NYTS/FDA, 2024 |
| Hookah | 0.8% | 0.6% | Declining | NYTS/FDA, 2024 |

### The Youth Vaping Epidemic

Youth e-cigarette use surged from 1.5% of high school students in 2011 to a peak of 27.5% in 2019, driven by JUUL's nicotine salt technology and aggressive social media marketing (NYTS, 2019). Then-Surgeon General Jerome Adams declared youth vaping an "epidemic" in December 2018. Since the peak, youth vaping rates have declined significantly -- to 5.9% of high school students in 2024 -- driven by flavor enforcement actions, age verification improvements, COVID-19 disruptions, and JUUL's market decline.

However, the market has shifted from pod-based devices (JUUL) to disposable flavored e-cigarettes. Among current youth e-cigarette users in 2024, approximately 88% used flavored products, and disposable devices accounted for the majority of use (FDA/CDC, 2024). The leading brands among youth shifted from JUUL to Elf Bar, Lost Mary, and other disposable brands -- many manufactured in China and sold without FDA marketing authorization.

## E-Cigarette and Vaping Market

### Market Size and Structure

The U.S. e-cigarette market was valued at approximately $8.3 billion in 2023 (Euromonitor International, 2024). The market is divided among several product categories:

| Product Category | Market Share (2023) | Key Brands | FDA Authorization Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Disposable e-cigarettes | ~45% | Elf Bar, Lost Mary, Fume, Breeze | Mostly unauthorized |
| Pod/cartridge systems | ~35% | JUUL, Vuse, NJOY | Vuse Alto, NJOY Ace authorized (tobacco flavor) |
| Open/refillable systems | ~15% | SMOK, Vaporesso, GeekVape | Mostly unauthorized |
| Nicotine pouches | Growing rapidly | Zyn, On!, Rogue | Under FDA review |
| Heated tobacco | <1% U.S. | IQOS (Philip Morris) | Modified risk order granted 2020, then paused |

### FDA Marketing Authorization

As of late 2024, the FDA has authorized only a handful of e-cigarette products through the Premarket Tobacco Product Application (PMTA) pathway. The agency received applications covering more than 26 million products but has authorized marketing for only 34 e-cigarette products as of December 2024 -- all tobacco-flavored (FDA CTP, 2024). No flavored e-cigarette has received FDA marketing authorization.

The FDA issued marketing denial orders (MDOs) for approximately 1.4 million flavored e-cigarette products through 2024, though many of these decisions have been challenged in court. In several cases, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated FDA denial orders, finding that the agency had not provided fair notice of its scientific expectations regarding comparative population-level evidence. The Supreme Court declined to hear the FDA's appeal in *FDA v. Wages and White Lion Investments* (2024).

## Menthol and Flavored Products

### The Proposed Menthol Ban

In April 2022, the FDA published proposed rules to prohibit menthol as a characterizing flavor in cigarettes and to ban all characterizing flavors (other than tobacco) in cigars. The menthol cigarette rule would be one of the most consequential tobacco regulatory actions in U.S. history.

Key facts about the menthol proposal:

- Menthol cigarettes account for approximately 37% of the U.S. cigarette market (~73 billion cigarettes annually) (FTC Cigarette Report, 2023)
- Approximately 85% of Black smokers use menthol cigarettes, compared to ~30% of white smokers (SAMHSA/NSDUH, 2023)
- The FDA estimated a menthol ban would lead 923,000 smokers to quit within the first year and prevent 654,000 deaths over 40 years (FDA RIA, 2022)
- The proposed rule specifically states it would not apply to individual consumer possession or use -- enforcement would target manufacturers, distributors, and retailers

As of early 2025, the menthol cigarette rule has not been finalized. The White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) delayed action before the 2024 election, and the rule's future remains uncertain under the current administration.

### State Flavor Bans

Several states and localities have enacted their own flavor restrictions:

| Jurisdiction | Policy | Year Enacted | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| Massachusetts | All flavored tobacco ban | 2020 | Cigarettes, e-cigarettes, all tobacco products |
| California | Proposition 31 flavored tobacco ban | 2022 (effective 2023) | All flavored tobacco products including menthol |
| New Jersey | Flavored e-cigarette ban | 2020 | E-cigarettes only (menthol cigarettes exempt) |
| New York | Flavored e-cigarette ban | 2020 | E-cigarettes only |
| Rhode Island | Flavored e-cigarette ban | 2020 | E-cigarettes only |

## Regulatory Framework

### Key Laws and Regulations

| Law/Regulation | Year | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act** | 1965 | Required health warnings on cigarette packages |
| **Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act** | 1970 | Banned cigarette advertising on TV and radio |
| **Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act** | 1986 | Required warnings on smokeless tobacco products |
| **Synar Amendment** | 1992 | Required states to enforce minimum age for tobacco sales |
| **Master Settlement Agreement** | 1998 | Settled state lawsuits against tobacco companies; restricted marketing |
| **Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act** | 2009 | Granted FDA authority to regulate tobacco products |
| **Deeming Rule** | 2016 | Extended FDA authority to e-cigarettes, cigars, hookah, pipe tobacco |
| **Tobacco 21 (T21)** | 2019 | Raised federal minimum purchase age from 18 to 21 |
| **PACT Act Amendment** | 2020 | Banned U.S. Postal Service from mailing e-cigarettes |

### FDA Center for Tobacco Products

The FDA's Center for Tobacco Products (CTP) is responsible for implementing the Tobacco Control Act. Key functions include:

1. **Premarket Review**: Evaluating new tobacco product applications (PMTAs, substantial equivalence, modified risk applications)
2. **Compliance and Enforcement**: Inspecting retailers, issuing warning letters, pursuing civil money penalties
3. **Product Standards**: Setting manufacturing and ingredient standards
4. **Public Education**: Operating the "Real Cost" and "Fresh Empire" youth prevention campaigns
5. **Research**: Funding the Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) Study

CTP operates with a budget of approximately $712 million (FY2024), funded entirely by tobacco industry user fees, not taxpayer appropriations (FDA, 2024).

## Tobacco Taxation

### Federal Excise Tax

The federal cigarette excise tax is $1.01 per pack (20 cigarettes), set by the Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (CHIPRA) of 2009. This rate has not been adjusted since 2009 and has lost approximately 30% of its real value to inflation (Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, 2024).

| Product | Federal Tax Rate | Last Adjusted |
|---|---|---|
| Cigarettes | $1.01 per pack of 20 | 2009 |
| Small cigars | $1.01 per pack of 20 | 2009 |
| Large cigars | 52.75% of manufacturer's price (cap: $0.4026/cigar) | 2009 |
| Smokeless tobacco (snuff) | $1.51 per pound | 2009 |
| Pipe tobacco | $2.8311 per pound | 2009 |
| Roll-your-own tobacco | $24.78 per pound | 2009 |

### State Excise Taxes

State cigarette excise taxes range from $0.17 per pack (Missouri) to $5.35 per pack (Connecticut). The average state cigarette excise tax is $1.91 per pack (Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, 2024). Combined with the federal tax and local taxes, the total tax on a pack of cigarettes ranges from approximately $1.18 in Missouri to $6.86 in New York City.

| State/Jurisdiction | Tax Per Pack | Rank |
|---|---|---|
| Connecticut | $5.35 | Highest |
| New York | $5.35 | Highest (tied) |
| District of Columbia | $5.03 | 3rd |
| Massachusetts | $3.51 | 4th |
| Minnesota | $3.04 | 5th |
| ... | ... | ... |
| Virginia | $0.60 | 47th |
| Georgia | $0.37 | 48th |
| North Dakota | $0.44 | 49th |
| North Carolina | $0.45 | 50th |
| Missouri | $0.17 | Lowest |

### E-Cigarette and Vaping Taxes

As of 2024, 32 states and D.C. have enacted taxes on e-cigarettes or vaping products. Tax structures vary widely -- some states tax by volume of liquid (e.g., Minnesota at $0.285/mL), others as a percentage of wholesale price (e.g., California at 56.93%), and some use per-unit taxes (Public Health Law Center, 2024). There is no federal excise tax on e-cigarettes.

## Master Settlement Agreement

The 1998 Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) between 46 states, 5 U.S. territories, D.C., and the four largest tobacco companies (Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds, Brown & Williamson, Lorillard) remains the largest civil settlement in U.S. history.

### Payment History

| Period | Total Payments | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1998-2023 | >$200 billion | Total payments to settling states |
| Annual payment (2023) | ~$8.1 billion | Adjusted for inflation and consumption declines |
| Projected total (through 2025) | ~$225 billion | Declining as smoking decreases |

### Use of MSA Funds

Despite the MSA's origins in tobacco-related healthcare costs, states consistently spend only a fraction of MSA and tobacco tax revenue on tobacco prevention and cessation:

| Category | FY2024 Spending | CDC-Recommended Level | Gap |
|---|---|---|---|
| State tobacco prevention/cessation spending | $745 million | $3.3 billion | 22.6% of recommended |
| States funding at CDC-recommended level | 0 out of 50 | 50 out of 50 | No state meets recommendations |
| States spending >50% of recommended | 3 | 50 | 6% of states |
| States spending <10% of recommended | 8 | 0 | 16% of states |

## Smoking Cessation

### The Treatment Gap

Approximately 70% of adult smokers say they want to quit, and more than 55% make a quit attempt each year. However, only about 8% of smokers who try to quit succeed without assistance, and only a minority use evidence-based cessation treatments (CDC, 2024).

| Cessation Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Smokers who want to quit | ~70% | NHIS/CDC, 2024 |
| Smokers who made a quit attempt (past year) | ~55% | NHIS/CDC, 2024 |
| Successful quit rate (no assistance) | ~4-8% | Cochrane Review, 2023 |
| Successful quit rate (with NRT + counseling) | ~25-30% | Cochrane Review, 2023 |
| Smokers using evidence-based cessation aid | ~31% of quit attempts | NHIS/CDC, 2024 |

### FDA-Approved Cessation Medications

Seven FDA-approved cessation medications are available:

| Medication | Type | Efficacy (vs. placebo) | Access |
|---|---|---|---|
| Nicotine patch | NRT (OTC) | 1.5-2x quit rate | Over-the-counter |
| Nicotine gum | NRT (OTC) | 1.5-2x quit rate | Over-the-counter |
| Nicotine lozenge | NRT (OTC) | 1.5-2x quit rate | Over-the-counter |
| Nicotine nasal spray | NRT (Rx) | 2-2.5x quit rate | Prescription |
| Nicotine inhaler | NRT (Rx) | 1.5-2x quit rate | Prescription |
| Bupropion (Zyban) | Non-NRT (Rx) | 1.5-2x quit rate | Prescription |
| Varenicline (Chantix) | Non-NRT (Rx) | 2-3x quit rate | Prescription |

The ACA requires most private insurance plans to cover cessation treatments without cost-sharing. Medicaid coverage varies by state; all state Medicaid programs now cover some cessation treatments, but only 14 states cover all seven FDA-approved medications plus counseling (American Lung Association, 2024).

### Quitlines

All 50 states, D.C., and territories operate tobacco quitlines, accessible through 1-800-QUIT-NOW. In FY2023, state quitlines received approximately 416,000 calls, a decline from the peak of 800,000+ calls in 2012 (NAQC, 2024). Quitline budgets have declined as states reduced tobacco control funding.

## Emerging Products and Trends

### Nicotine Pouches

Nicotine pouches -- small, white pouches containing nicotine derived from tobacco leaf or synthesized, placed between the gum and lip -- have emerged as one of the fastest-growing nicotine product categories. The Swedish brand Zyn (Philip Morris International/Swedish Match) dominates the U.S. market, with sales growing from approximately $170 million in 2020 to over $3 billion in 2024 (Wells Fargo Securities, 2024).

The FDA has not yet completed review of any nicotine pouch PMTA. These products occupy a regulatory gray area -- the FDA classifies tobacco-derived nicotine pouches as tobacco products subject to regulation, but synthetic nicotine products were only brought under FDA jurisdiction by the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022.

### Heated Tobacco Products

Philip Morris International's IQOS, which heats rather than burns tobacco sticks, received FDA authorization as a modified risk tobacco product (MRTP) in July 2020 -- the first product to receive such an order. The FDA found that IQOS switching "significantly reduces your body's exposure to harmful or potentially harmful chemicals." However, IQOS sales in the U.S. were suspended in 2021 due to a patent dispute with British American Tobacco (BAT), and the product has not returned to the U.S. market as of early 2025.

### Illicit and Unauthorized Products

The unauthorized e-cigarette market has grown substantially. An estimated 9,000+ unique flavored e-cigarette products were available in the U.S. market in 2024, the vast majority without FDA marketing authorization (Truth Initiative, 2024). Chinese manufacturers dominate the disposable e-cigarette market, and enforcement against unauthorized products remains a major challenge. In 2024, the FDA and U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) increased seizures of unauthorized e-cigarettes at ports of entry, but supply continues to outpace enforcement capacity.

---

## Recent Trends

- **Declining youth vaping**: High school e-cigarette use fell from 27.5% (2019) to 5.9% (2024), though absolute numbers remain concerning
- **Nicotine pouch growth**: Zyn sales tripled between 2022 and 2024, raising questions about youth appeal and regulatory classification
- **Menthol ban stalled**: The FDA's proposed menthol cigarette rule, first announced in 2022, has faced repeated delays and political obstacles
- **Court challenges to FDA authority**: Multiple federal circuit court decisions have questioned the FDA's PMTA review process and standards of evidence
- **State-level action**: States continue to lead on flavor bans, tax increases, and Tobacco 21 enforcement
- **JUUL settlement**: JUUL agreed to pay $462 million to six states plus $1.7 billion in a multistate settlement (2023) to resolve youth marketing claims
- **Smoking rate plateau risk**: The pace of decline in adult smoking has slowed, raising concerns that the remaining smoker population is harder to reach

## Emerging Challenges

The tobacco and nicotine landscape faces several emerging challenges that will shape policy in the coming years. The proliferation of unauthorized disposable e-cigarettes, many manufactured overseas, has overwhelmed FDA enforcement capacity. The rapid growth of nicotine pouches has outpaced the regulatory framework designed for traditional tobacco products. Synthetic nicotine products, now under FDA jurisdiction since 2022, present novel regulatory questions about manufacturing standards and product characterization.

Additionally, the tobacco industry's ongoing transformation -- with companies like Philip Morris International declaring a "smoke-free future" -- raises fundamental questions about whether regulators can effectively partner with or rely on companies with a documented history of deception. The convergence of cannabis and nicotine vaping technology further complicates the regulatory environment, as many devices can be used interchangeably for both substances.
