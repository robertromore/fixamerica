# Drug Policy: Overview

## Executive Summary

The United States has spent over $1 trillion on drug enforcement since President Nixon declared the War on Drugs in 1971, yet drug use, addiction, and overdose deaths have all increased. In 2023, more than 107,000 Americans died from drug overdoses -- roughly one death every five minutes -- driven overwhelmingly by illicitly manufactured fentanyl and its analogs. An estimated 48.7 million Americans aged 12 or older had a substance use disorder (SUD) in 2023, yet only about 24% received any form of treatment. Meanwhile, the criminal justice system processes approximately 1.5 million drug arrests annually, with stark racial disparities: Black Americans are nearly four times more likely to be arrested for cannabis possession than white Americans despite comparable usage rates.

The core failure of U.S. drug policy is structural. The federal government treats drug use primarily as a criminal justice problem rather than a public health crisis, allocating roughly 57% of the federal drug control budget to supply reduction (law enforcement, interdiction, international operations) and only 43% to demand reduction (treatment, prevention, harm reduction). This approach has not meaningfully reduced the availability of drugs on American streets. The price of cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine has fallen in inflation-adjusted terms over the past four decades, while potency has increased. The emergence of synthetic opioids like fentanyl -- which can be manufactured cheaply without agricultural inputs -- has fundamentally undermined the supply-side enforcement model.

Reform is underway but fragmented. Twenty-four states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational cannabis. Oregon decriminalized personal possession of all drugs in 2020 (Measure 110), though the state partially reversed course in 2024. The FDA has approved buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone for opioid use disorder, and the 2023 removal of the X-waiver requirement expanded prescribing access. Cities and states have launched naloxone distribution programs, syringe service programs, and drug checking services. But federal law remains anchored in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, and comprehensive reform requires Congressional action.

## Scope

This analysis examines the primary components of U.S. drug policy:

- **Drug Classification and Scheduling**: The federal scheduling system under the Controlled Substances Act and its impact on research, treatment, and enforcement.
- **Criminal Enforcement**: Drug arrests, prosecution, sentencing, and incarceration at federal, state, and local levels.
- **Treatment and Recovery**: Access to evidence-based treatment including medication-assisted treatment (MAT), behavioral therapies, and recovery support services.
- **Harm Reduction**: Strategies to reduce the negative consequences of drug use, including naloxone distribution, syringe services, and overdose prevention centers.
- **Prevention**: Evidence-based approaches to reducing initiation of drug use, particularly among youth.
- **The Opioid and Fentanyl Crisis**: The origins, evolution, and current state of the deadliest drug epidemic in American history.
- **Cannabis Policy**: The growing gap between state legalization and federal prohibition.
- **Pharmaceutical Regulation**: The role of the pharmaceutical industry in creating and perpetuating addiction crises.
- **International Drug Policy**: U.S.-funded eradication, interdiction, and demand reduction programs abroad.
- **Racial Equity**: Disparate enforcement and its cumulative impact on communities of color.

This analysis does not cover alcohol and tobacco regulation in depth, though both are addressed as subtopics. It focuses on federal policy while acknowledging the critical role of state and local innovation.

## Why This Matters

**Public Health Crisis**: Drug overdose is now the leading cause of accidental death in the United States, surpassing car accidents, firearms, and falls. The fentanyl crisis has driven a decline in U.S. life expectancy that is unprecedented among wealthy nations.

**Racial Justice**: The War on Drugs has been enforced with profound racial disparities. Despite similar rates of drug use, Black Americans are incarcerated for drug offenses at nearly six times the rate of white Americans. These disparities compound across generations, disrupting families and communities.

**Economic Costs**: The total economic cost of substance misuse in the United States exceeds $600 billion annually, including healthcare ($120 billion), lost productivity ($400 billion), and criminal justice costs ($80 billion), according to NIDA estimates. Treatment investment yields returns of 4:1 to 7:1 in reduced drug-related costs.

**Criminal Justice Burden**: Drug offenses account for approximately 45% of the federal prison population and a significant share of state and local incarceration. Drug enforcement consumes enormous law enforcement resources that could be directed toward violent crime.

**International Consequences**: U.S. demand for illegal drugs fuels violence, corruption, and instability in producer and transit countries, particularly in Latin America. Mexico's drug war has killed over 350,000 people since 2006.

## Core Tensions

### 1. Criminal Justice vs. Public Health

The most fundamental tension in drug policy is whether drug use and addiction should be treated primarily as crimes or as health conditions. The current system nominally embraces both approaches but structurally favors enforcement. The criminal justice frame stigmatizes addiction, deters treatment-seeking, and generates collateral consequences (criminal records, housing barriers, employment discrimination) that make recovery harder.

### 2. Federal Prohibition vs. State Legalization

Twenty-four states have legalized recreational cannabis, creating a direct conflict with the Controlled Substances Act. Cannabis businesses in legal states cannot access federal banking services, cannot deduct ordinary business expenses on federal taxes (26 U.S.C. Section 280E), and operate under constant threat of federal enforcement. This federal-state conflict undermines the rule of law and distorts markets.

### 3. Supply Reduction vs. Demand Reduction

The federal drug budget has historically favored supply-side interventions (interdiction, eradication, enforcement) over demand-side investments (treatment, prevention, harm reduction). Decades of evidence suggest that demand reduction yields greater returns per dollar invested. RAND Corporation research estimates that treatment is seven times more cost-effective than domestic law enforcement and ten times more cost-effective than interdiction at reducing cocaine use.

### 4. Pharmaceutical Industry Profits vs. Public Safety

The opioid crisis was ignited by pharmaceutical companies -- particularly Purdue Pharma -- that aggressively marketed addictive painkillers while downplaying risks. Regulatory failures at the FDA and DEA enabled this behavior. The tension between pharmaceutical industry profits and public health safeguards remains unresolved, as demonstrated by ongoing concerns about gabapentinoid prescribing, benzodiazepine overprescription, and the delayed regulation of kratom.

### 5. Drug War as Racial Control vs. Public Safety Tool

A substantial body of historical evidence demonstrates that the War on Drugs was designed, at least in part, as a tool of racial and political control. Nixon aide John Ehrlichman acknowledged in a 1994 interview that the Nixon administration's drug policy deliberately targeted "the antiwar left and black people." This legacy continues to shape enforcement patterns and public trust.

## Key Questions This Analysis Addresses

1. Why has the War on Drugs failed to reduce drug use, addiction, or overdose deaths despite enormous investment?
2. What does the evidence say about the effectiveness of different drug policy approaches -- prohibition, decriminalization, legalization, harm reduction, treatment?
3. How can federal drug scheduling be reformed to reflect scientific evidence rather than political considerations?
4. What comprehensive policy framework could reduce overdose deaths, expand treatment access, address racial disparities, and end the federal-state cannabis conflict?
5. How have other countries -- particularly Portugal, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Canada -- addressed drug policy, and what lessons apply to the United States?
6. What role did the pharmaceutical industry play in creating the opioid crisis, and what accountability and regulatory reforms are needed?
7. How can the treatment system be expanded and improved to close the gap between the 48.7 million Americans with substance use disorders and the 24% who receive treatment?
8. What political coalitions can advance reform, and what are the most promising bipartisan entry points?

## Vision of Success

Successful drug policy reform would produce measurable outcomes within a decade:

- **Overdose deaths reduced by 50% or more** through expanded access to naloxone, medication-assisted treatment, fentanyl test strips, and overdose prevention centers.
- **Treatment gap closed to under 30%** by making evidence-based SUD treatment available, affordable, and destigmatized for all who need it.
- **Drug arrest racial disparities eliminated** by ending arrest-based enforcement for personal possession and reforming prosecutorial practices.
- **Federal cannabis legalization enacted** with a regulatory framework that prioritizes public health, expungement of prior convictions, and equity in the legal market.
- **Drug scheduling reformed** to reflect scientific evidence, with an independent scientific advisory process and removal of political interference.
- **Federal drug budget rebalanced** to allocate at least 60% to demand reduction (treatment, prevention, harm reduction) and no more than 40% to supply reduction.
- **Pharmaceutical industry accountability** established through strengthened FDA oversight, reformed marketing practices, and enforceable penalties for deceptive promotion.

## Political Context

Drug policy reform draws interest across the political spectrum, though motivations differ significantly:

- **Conservatives** have increasingly supported sentencing reform (as exemplified by the First Step Act of 2018) and faith-based recovery programs, while generally opposing decriminalization and harm reduction measures like supervised injection sites.
- **Liberals/Progressives** advocate for decriminalization, racial equity in enforcement, harm reduction expansion, and pharmaceutical industry accountability, while supporting cannabis legalization with social equity provisions.
- **Libertarians** support broad drug legalization on individual liberty grounds, opposing government regulation of personal consumption, while favoring free-market approaches to the pharmaceutical industry.
- **Populists** focus on cracking down on drug trafficking and cartels, holding pharmaceutical executives accountable, and protecting working-class communities devastated by the opioid crisis.

The opioid crisis has created unusual political dynamics, as it has disproportionately affected rural white communities that are core constituencies of the Republican Party. This has made some traditionally tough-on-crime politicians more receptive to treatment-based approaches.

## Reform Principles

Effective drug policy reform should:

1. **Follow the Evidence**: Base policy on scientific research and public health data, not moral panic, political calculation, or anecdote.
2. **Prioritize Saving Lives**: Make reducing overdose deaths and expanding treatment access the primary metrics of success.
3. **Address Racial Disparities**: Acknowledge and remedy the disproportionate impact of drug enforcement on communities of color.
4. **Rebalance Toward Health**: Shift federal spending from enforcement to treatment, prevention, and harm reduction.
5. **Respect State Innovation**: Accommodate state-level policy experiments while establishing federal minimum standards.
6. **Ensure Accountability**: Hold pharmaceutical companies, enforcement agencies, and treatment providers accountable for outcomes.
7. **Protect Individual Liberty**: Distinguish between personal use and trafficking, applying criminal penalties proportionally to actual harm.
8. **Invest in Prevention**: Fund evidence-based prevention programs that work, and defund those (like D.A.R.E.) that do not.
