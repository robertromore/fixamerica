# Prescription Drug Policy: Solutions

Prescription drug reform requires a multi-faceted approach that aims to modernize monitoring infrastructure, introduce transparency and competition into drug pricing, curb anti-competitive practices, and establish evidence-based prescribing standards -- all while preserving patient access and innovation incentives.

---

## Reform Framework

### Guiding Principles

- Evidence-based policy: Ground all reforms in peer-reviewed research, pilot program results, and international evidence
- Patient-centered design: Prioritize affordable access, safety, and clinical appropriateness over industry revenue or bureaucratic convenience
- Transparency by default: Replace opacity with mandated disclosure of pricing, rebate flows, and prescribing data
- Competition as cost control: Rely on genuine market competition (generic entry, biosimilar adoption, PBM competition) as the primary cost reduction mechanism, supplemented by government negotiation where competition fails
- Adaptive regulation: Build evaluation, sunset, and revision mechanisms into all reforms

### Theory of Change

Prescription drug dysfunction stems from concentrated market power (brand manufacturers, PBMs), fragmented oversight (state-level PDMPs, divided federal authority), and inadequate transparency (rebate flows, prescribing patterns). Reform must address all three simultaneously: introduce transparency to enable informed decision-making, strengthen competition to reduce prices, and modernize monitoring to prevent harm. Early wins on PBM transparency and PDMP interoperability build political momentum for harder structural reforms on drug pricing and patent policy.

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: National PDMP Interoperability and Modernization

**Description**: Establish a federally funded, nationally interoperable PDMP infrastructure that provides real-time prescribing data across all 50 states, territories, and the District of Columbia. The system would standardize data formats, mandate bidirectional interstate data sharing, integrate with electronic health records (EHRs), and incorporate automated clinical alerts for high-risk prescribing patterns. Federal standards would establish minimum mandate requirements (mandatory check before prescribing any Schedule II-IV substance) while allowing states to exceed federal minimums.

**Evidence Base**: States with mandatory-use PDMPs have experienced 8-12% reductions in opioid prescribing and 50-80% reductions in doctor shopping (Wen et al., *Health Affairs*, 2017; Buchmueller & Carey, *AEJ: Economic Policy*, 2018). Kentucky's KASPER system, one of the most mature PDMPs, demonstrated a 52% reduction in multiple-provider opioid episodes after implementing mandatory checking (Kentucky Cabinet for Health and Family Services, 2014).

**Implementation**: (1) Congress authorizes and funds a national PDMP interoperability standard through SAMHSA. (2) ONC Health IT establishes data format and EHR integration requirements. (3) States have 24 months to achieve compliance, with federal technical assistance and funding. (4) CMS conditions DEA registration renewal on active participation in the national system.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $500 million over 5 years for federal standards development, state implementation grants, and ongoing system maintenance. The Harold Rogers PDMP Grant Program and CDC cooperative agreements provide existing funding models.

**Timeline**: Standards development: 12 months. State implementation: 24 months. Full national interoperability: 36 months from authorization.

**Challenges**: State sovereignty concerns; data privacy governance; EHR vendor cooperation; ongoing funding for system maintenance.

**Impact Metrics**: Interstate query volume; time-to-query-response; doctor shopping episode rates; opioid prescribing rate trends.

### Solution 2: Comprehensive PBM Transparency and Reform

**Description**: Require full transparency of PBM business practices and establish fiduciary duty requirements. Key provisions: (1) Mandate pass-through of 100% of manufacturer rebates to health plans. (2) Prohibit spread pricing in all government programs and require disclosure in commercial markets. (3) Ban self-referral to PBM-owned specialty pharmacies unless the patient affirmatively opts in. (4) Require PBMs to act as fiduciaries to the health plans they serve. (5) Delink PBM compensation from drug list prices. (6) Require annual disclosure of aggregate rebate revenue, spread pricing margins, and specialty pharmacy referral volumes.

**Evidence Base**: The FTC's 2024 interim report documented that PBM practices inflate drug costs and harm independent pharmacies. States including Arkansas, Ohio, and Virginia have enacted PBM transparency laws; early evidence suggests that transparency mandates reduce spread pricing and increase plan savings. Ohio's 2019 audit of Medicaid managed care PBM contracts found that PBMs retained $224 million in spread pricing over one year -- savings that were redirected to the state after reform.

**Implementation**: (1) Federal legislation establishing minimum PBM transparency and fiduciary standards. (2) FTC rulemaking under existing authority to prohibit unfair practices. (3) State insurance department enforcement of transparency requirements. (4) CMS regulatory reform of Medicare Part D PBM requirements.

**Cost/Resources**: Minimal direct federal cost. CBO estimates that PBM reform provisions in recent bipartisan bills would save the federal government $4-8 billion over 10 years through reduced Medicare/Medicaid drug costs.

**Timeline**: Federal legislation: 12-18 months. FTC rulemaking: 12-24 months. Full compliance: 36 months.

**Challenges**: Intense PBM and insurer lobbying; vertical integration complicates disentangling PBM from insurer operations; definitions of "fiduciary duty" may be contested in court.

**Impact Metrics**: Rebate pass-through rates; independent pharmacy closure rates; patient out-of-pocket costs; plan sponsor reported savings.

---

### Solution 3: Expanded Medicare Drug Price Negotiation

**Description**: Build on the Inflation Reduction Act by expanding Medicare drug price negotiation to cover more drugs, more quickly, and extending negotiation authority to the commercial market. Specific proposals: (1) Increase the number of drugs subject to negotiation from 60 (by 2029 under current law) to at least 100 within 5 years. (2) Reduce the market exclusivity period before negotiation eligibility from 9 years (small-molecule) to 7 years. (3) Extend negotiation prices to the commercial market or establish a benchmark pegged to Medicare negotiated prices. (4) Strengthen the inflation penalty mechanism by lowering the threshold and increasing penalties.

**Evidence Base**: The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the IRA's existing negotiation provisions would save Medicare $98.5 billion over 10 years. International experience demonstrates that government negotiation reduces prices by 40-60% compared to U.S. list prices without measurably reducing pharmaceutical innovation. Germany's AMNOG reference pricing system, implemented in 2011, has saved over 20 billion euros while maintaining a robust pharmaceutical sector (GKV-Spitzenverband, 2023).

**Implementation**: Congressional legislation amending the IRA's negotiation provisions. CMS rulemaking to implement expanded negotiation procedures. Phased expansion of drug selection over 5 years.

**Cost/Resources**: Net savings to federal government. CBO estimates that broader negotiation could save an additional $50-100 billion over 10 years depending on scope.

**Timeline**: Legislation: 12-24 months (dependent on political environment). First expanded negotiations: 24-36 months after enactment.

**Challenges**: Pharmaceutical industry legal challenges (multiple lawsuits challenging the IRA's existing provisions are pending); political opposition from members who receive substantial industry contributions; potential supply concerns for negotiated drugs.

**Impact Metrics**: Per-drug negotiated price reduction; total Medicare savings; patient out-of-pocket cost changes; pharmaceutical R&D spending trends.

### Solution 4: Patent Reform to Accelerate Generic Competition

**Description**: Enact comprehensive patent reform targeting anti-competitive strategies that delay generic entry. Key provisions: (1) Limit the total number of patents that can be listed in the FDA Orange Book for any single drug product. (2) Create a presumption of invalidity for secondary patents filed more than 4 years after initial approval. (3) Strengthen FTC authority to challenge pay-for-delay settlements. (4) Prohibit the use of REMS as a mechanism to deny generic manufacturers access to drug samples. (5) Require the FDA to prioritize ANDA review for drugs with no generic competition despite expired patents.

**Evidence Base**: The FTC has documented that pay-for-delay settlements cost consumers $3.5 billion annually (FTC, 2023). I-MAK's analysis found that the 12 best-selling drugs are protected by an average of 131 patent filings each, far exceeding the protection intended by the Hatch-Waxman Act. The FDA's REMS with Elements to Assure Safe Use (ETASU) has been used to block generic development for over 100 drugs (FDA, 2024).

**Implementation**: (1) Congressional legislation amending the Hatch-Waxman Act and the FD&C Act. (2) FTC enforcement actions under strengthened authority. (3) FDA rulemaking to address REMS abuse and prioritize ANDA review.

**Cost/Resources**: Minimal direct federal cost. Significant savings to consumers, employers, and government programs through earlier generic entry.

**Timeline**: Legislation: 12-24 months. Regulatory implementation: 12-18 months after enactment. First impact on generic entry: 24-36 months.

**Challenges**: Strong pharmaceutical industry opposition; pharmaceutical patent attorneys are among the most sophisticated in American law; international trade agreement constraints (TRIPS minimum standards).

**Impact Metrics**: Time from patent expiration to first generic entry; number of drugs with generic competition; average brand-to-generic price reduction; total generic drug savings.

### Solution 5: Regulated Prescription Drug Importation

**Description**: Implement the drug importation authority already on the books (Section 804 of the FD&C Act, added in 2003 but never implemented) by establishing a federal certification program for importation from countries with comparable regulatory standards (Canada, EU, Japan, Australia). Key provisions: (1) Federal certification of approved exporting countries based on regulatory equivalence assessment. (2) Supply chain verification and tracking requirements. (3) Initial focus on high-cost, single-source brand-name drugs with no generic competition. (4) Allow both wholesale and personal importation through certified channels.

**Evidence Base**: A 2020 ASPE analysis found that prices for brand-name drugs in Canada are 32% lower than in the United States. FDA analyses have confirmed that Canadian drugs are manufactured to equivalent standards. Florida, Colorado, Vermont, and other states have enacted importation programs under Section 804(j), though federal certification has not yet been granted.

**Implementation**: (1) HHS Secretary certifies that importation from approved countries is safe and will generate significant cost savings (as required under existing law). (2) FDA establishes a regulatory framework for importation verification. (3) State-level programs begin operating under federal certification. (4) Expansion to additional countries as regulatory equivalence is demonstrated.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $50-100 million for federal certification infrastructure. Substantial savings: CBO estimated $6-10 billion over 10 years from importation provisions in various legislative proposals.

**Timeline**: Federal certification: 12-18 months. First state programs operational: 24 months. Expanded importation: 36-60 months.

**Challenges**: Pharmaceutical industry opposition (including potential supply restrictions to Canadian wholesalers); Canadian government concerns about drug supply for its own population; logistical complexity of supply chain verification.

**Impact Metrics**: Volume of drugs imported; average price savings vs. domestic prices; adverse event rates for imported vs. domestic drugs; patient access improvements.

### Solution 6: Evidence-Based Prescribing Standards and Clinical Decision Support

**Description**: Establish a national framework for evidence-based prescribing of controlled substances, integrating clinical decision support (CDS) tools into electronic health records. Key provisions: (1) Fund the development and deployment of CDS tools that alert prescribers to high-risk prescribing patterns (high doses, dangerous combinations, excessive duration). (2) Mandate continuing medical education (CME) in controlled substance prescribing for all DEA-registered prescribers (8 hours every 3 years, building on the SUPPORT Act's requirement). (3) Update CDC prescribing guidelines to incorporate flexible, patient-centered recommendations. (4) Fund research on non-opioid pain management alternatives, including physical therapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and non-opioid medications.

**Evidence Base**: Clinical decision support tools have been shown to reduce inappropriate prescribing by 15-30% when integrated into EHR workflows (Nuckols et al., *Annals of Internal Medicine*, 2014). The VA's implementation of opioid prescribing alerts reduced high-dose prescriptions by 22% over 3 years (Lin et al., *JAMA Internal Medicine*, 2017). The SUPPORT Act's CME requirements have been associated with improved prescriber knowledge of addiction risk (SAMHSA, 2023).

**Implementation**: (1) ONC Health IT mandates CDS modules in certified EHR systems. (2) CMS ties CDS implementation to Meaningful Use/Promoting Interoperability incentives. (3) SAMHSA funds CME program development and delivery. (4) NIH expands non-opioid pain research through HEAL Initiative.

**Cost/Resources**: Estimated $200 million over 5 years for CDS development, CME program funding, and pain research expansion.

**Timeline**: CDS standards: 18 months. CME mandate compliance: 36 months. Pain research funding impact: 5-10 years.

**Challenges**: Prescriber resistance to additional mandates; alert fatigue from excessive CDS notifications; ensuring guidelines maintain clinical flexibility.

**Impact Metrics**: High-dose controlled substance prescriptions; opioid prescriptions per capita; prescriber CME completion rates; non-opioid pain treatment utilization.

### Solution 7: Biosimilar Adoption Acceleration

**Description**: Accelerate the adoption of biosimilar drugs -- biologic equivalents that are currently priced 15-40% below reference products but far less than the 80-85% discount achieved by small-molecule generics. Key provisions: (1) Prohibit brand biologic manufacturers from offering rebate contracts that condition discounts on exclusion of biosimilar competitors (loyalty rebates). (2) Establish Medicare and Medicaid interchangeability designations that default to biosimilar substitution. (3) Fund physician and patient education campaigns about biosimilar safety and efficacy. (4) Reduce the 12-year biologic data exclusivity period to 7 years (the standard for small-molecule drugs).

**Evidence Base**: European countries have achieved biosimilar substitution rates of 60-90% for many reference products, compared to 20-50% in the United States (IQVIA, 2024). The European experience demonstrates that higher adoption rates drive further price reductions. The entry of multiple Humira biosimilars in 2023 was expected to save $10-15 billion over 5 years, but brand loyalty rebates and slow formulary switching have reduced realized savings.

**Implementation**: (1) FTC enforcement against anticompetitive loyalty rebates. (2) CMS regulation establishing biosimilar substitution defaults in Medicare/Medicaid. (3) FDA education initiative on biosimilar interchangeability. (4) Congressional legislation reducing biologic data exclusivity.

**Cost/Resources**: Minimal direct cost. CBO estimates that reducing biologic exclusivity from 12 to 7 years would save the federal government approximately $7 billion over 10 years.

**Timeline**: FTC enforcement: Immediate. CMS regulation: 12-18 months. Legislative reforms: 12-24 months. Significant market impact: 36-60 months.

**Challenges**: Biologic manufacturer opposition; physician unfamiliarity with biosimilars; payer switching costs; brand loyalty rebate structures.

**Impact Metrics**: Biosimilar market share by reference product; average biosimilar discount vs. reference product; total biologic spending trends; patient access metrics.

## International Models

### Germany: AMNOG Reference Pricing

**Description**: Since 2011, Germany's Pharmaceutical Market Restructuring Act (AMNOG) requires manufacturers of new drugs to demonstrate additional therapeutic benefit compared to existing treatments. If benefit is established, a negotiated price is set; if not, the drug is priced at reference levels. All new drugs are available to patients from day one -- unlike the U.S. system, which does not evaluate comparative effectiveness.

**Results**: AMNOG has saved Germany's statutory health insurance system more than 20 billion euros since implementation, while maintaining full patient access to new drugs. Average time from launch to pricing decision is 12 months.

**Applicability to U.S.**: AMNOG's comparative effectiveness model could inform expanded Medicare negotiation. The "available from day one" principle ensures that price negotiation does not delay patient access. The model requires robust HTA (health technology assessment) infrastructure that does not currently exist at scale in the U.S.

### Canada: PMPRB Price Review

**Description**: Canada's Patented Medicine Prices Review Board (PMPRB) is a quasi-judicial body that sets maximum prices for patented drugs based on international reference pricing (comparing prices to seven reference countries). The 2020 PMPRB reforms strengthened the framework by incorporating pharmacoeconomic factors.

**Results**: Canadian brand-name drug prices average 32% lower than U.S. prices (ASPE, 2020). The PMPRB system has operated since 1987 without measurable negative impact on drug availability in Canada.

**Applicability to U.S.**: The reference pricing model could be applied to expand Medicare negotiation or establish a price ceiling for the commercial market. The Canadian experience demonstrates that external reference pricing is administratively feasible and does not significantly restrict drug access.

### United Kingdom: NICE Health Technology Assessment

**Description**: The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) evaluates new drugs for clinical and cost-effectiveness, setting a threshold of approximately 20,000-30,000 pounds per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Drugs that do not meet the threshold are not recommended for NHS coverage unless the manufacturer reduces the price.

**Results**: NICE has been credited with constraining drug spending growth while maintaining access to clinically effective treatments. UK drug prices average 50-60% below U.S. levels for comparable products.

**Applicability to U.S.**: While the QALY-based approach faces political opposition in the U.S. (the ACA explicitly prohibited the use of QALYs in Medicare coverage decisions), the broader principle of systematic effectiveness evaluation could inform a reformed U.S. drug benefit design.

## Pilot Programs and Demonstrations

- **Ohio PBM Spread Pricing Audit (2018-2019)**: Ohio's audit of Medicaid managed care PBM contracts revealed $224 million in spread pricing overcharges, leading to legislative reform requiring pass-through pricing in Medicaid. The reform produced documented savings that exceeded projections.
- **Kentucky KASPER System**: Kentucky's nationally recognized PDMP demonstrated 52% reduction in multiple-provider episodes and has served as a model for PDMP best practices, including mandatory checking, delegate access, and real-time data availability.
- **Florida Drug Importation Program**: Florida's 2019 law authorizing Canadian drug importation (approved under Section 804(j)) is the most advanced state-level importation effort, though it awaits federal certification. A state analysis projected savings of $80-150 million annually.
- **VA Pharmacy System**: The Veterans Affairs pharmacy system, which negotiates directly with manufacturers under federal supply schedule pricing, achieves drug prices approximately 40% lower than Medicare Part D -- demonstrating the power of negotiation even within the U.S. system.

## Complementary Policies

- **Mental health parity enforcement**: Ensuring full compliance with the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act supports appropriate prescribing of psychiatric medications and reduces pressure to use controlled substances as inadequate substitutes for mental health treatment.
- **Workforce development**: Expanding addiction medicine, pain management, and pharmacology training in medical education supports evidence-based prescribing and reduces reliance on pharmaceutical industry-funded CME.
- **Broadband expansion**: Rural PDMP access and telehealth prescribing depend on reliable internet infrastructure -- linking prescription drug policy to federal broadband investment.
- **Opioid settlement fund oversight**: Ensuring that the >$50 billion in opioid litigation settlements is directed to evidence-based treatment, prevention, and monitoring -- not diverted to general state budgets -- is critical to prescription drug policy outcomes.
