# Prescription Drug Policy: Legislation

## Overview

Legislative reform of the prescription drug system requires a multi-pronged approach addressing three distinct but interconnected areas: (1) prescription drug monitoring and prescribing oversight, (2) pharmacy benefit manager transparency and accountability, and (3) drug pricing and generic access. The legislative strategy combines federal legislation establishing national standards with state model legislation allowing tailored implementation. Given the bipartisan interest in PBM reform and the existing IRA framework for drug pricing, the approach sequences achievable reforms first to build momentum for more structurally ambitious changes.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for prescription drug policy reform. All proposed reforms operate within existing Congressional authority under the Commerce Clause (regulation of interstate drug markets, PBM practices, and pharmaceutical distribution), the Spending Clause (Medicare and Medicaid program conditions), and established FDA and DEA regulatory frameworks.*

## Federal Legislation

### The Prescription Drug Monitoring Modernization Act

**Purpose**: Establish federal standards for a nationally interoperable PDMP system that ensures real-time interstate data sharing, mandatory prescriber use, and EHR integration for all controlled substance prescribing.

**Key Provisions**:

1. Mandate nationally standardized PDMP data formats and interstate sharing protocols
2. Require mandatory PDMP queries before prescribing any Schedule II-IV controlled substance
3. Fund EHR integration of PDMP data at the point of prescribing
4. Establish federal privacy and data governance standards for PDMP information

**Draft Text**:

```text
119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To establish national standards for prescription drug monitoring program
interoperability and to require mandatory prescriber use of such
programs for controlled substance prescribing.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Prescription Drug Monitoring
Modernization Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) According to the CDC (2023), 142 million opioid prescriptions
    were dispensed in the United States in 2022, and opioid overdoses
    have killed more than 700,000 Americans since 1999.
(2) All 50 States and the District of Columbia now operate
    prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs), but interstate
    data sharing remains inconsistent, with only 42 States achieving
    bidirectional data exchange as of 2024.
(3) Research published in Health Affairs (Wen et al., 2017) found
    that mandatory PDMP use reduces opioid prescribing rates by
    8 to 12 percent and doctor shopping episodes by 50 to
    80 percent.
(4) Fragmented State-level PDMP systems enable interstate doctor
    shopping and controlled substance diversion, undermining the
    effectiveness of monitoring efforts.
(5) Integration of PDMP data into electronic health records reduces
    prescriber burden and increases query compliance rates.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:

(1) PDMP.--The term "PDMP" means a prescription drug monitoring
    program operated by a State, territory, or the District of
    Columbia that collects, monitors, and analyzes electronically
    transmitted prescribing and dispensing data for controlled
    substances.
(2) CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE.--The term "controlled substance" has the
    meaning given such term in section 102 of the Controlled
    Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802).
(3) INTEROPERABILITY STANDARD.--The term "interoperability standard"
    means the data format, transmission protocol, and query
    response standard established by the Secretary under section 4.
(4) EHR.--The term "EHR" means a certified electronic health record
    technology as defined in section 3000(13) of the Public Health
    Service Act.

SEC. 4. NATIONAL PDMP INTEROPERABILITY STANDARDS.

(a) IN GENERAL.--Not later than 12 months after the date of enactment
    of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting
    through the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology
    and in consultation with the Administrator of the Substance Abuse
    and Mental Health Services Administration and the Administrator
    of the Drug Enforcement Administration, shall publish national
    interoperability standards for PDMPs that ensure--
    (1) uniform data formats for prescription and dispensing records;
    (2) real-time bidirectional interstate data sharing with query
        response times not exceeding 5 seconds;
    (3) integration capability with certified EHR systems; and
    (4) compliance with the privacy and security requirements
        established under section 6.

(b) CONSULTATION.--In developing the standards under subsection (a),
    the Secretary shall consult with State PDMP administrators, the
    National Association of Boards of Pharmacy, health information
    technology vendors, prescriber and pharmacist organizations, and
    patient privacy advocates.

SEC. 5. MANDATORY PDMP USE.

(a) IN GENERAL.--Not later than 24 months after the date on which
    the standards under section 4 are published, each State receiving
    Federal funds under this Act shall require that--
    (1) each prescriber query the PDMP before issuing a prescription
        for a Schedule II, III, or IV controlled substance; and
    (2) each dispenser report dispensing data to the PDMP within
        24 hours of dispensing a controlled substance.

(b) EXCEPTIONS.--The requirement under subsection (a)(1) shall not
    apply to--
    (1) prescriptions issued in an emergency department for a supply
        of not more than 3 days;
    (2) prescriptions issued in an inpatient hospital setting;
    (3) prescriptions issued to a patient in hospice care; or
    (4) prescriptions issued during a declared public health
        emergency affecting PDMP system availability.

SEC. 6. PRIVACY AND DATA GOVERNANCE.

(a) ACCESS RESTRICTIONS.--PDMP data shall be accessible only to--
    (1) prescribers for clinical decision-making at the point of care;
    (2) dispensers for verifying prescription legitimacy;
    (3) State PDMP administrators for program operation and analysis;
    (4) law enforcement, only upon presentation of a valid warrant
        issued by a court of competent jurisdiction; and
    (5) medical licensing boards and pharmacy boards for disciplinary
        investigations.

(b) PROHIBITION ON COMMERCIAL USE.--PDMP data shall not be sold,
    licensed, or otherwise made available for commercial purposes,
    including pharmaceutical marketing or insurance underwriting.

(c) AUDIT TRAIL.--Each PDMP shall maintain a complete audit trail
    of all data queries, accessible to patients upon request.

SEC. 7. GRANTS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.

(a) AUTHORIZATION.--The Secretary shall award grants to States to
    support PDMP upgrades, interoperability implementation, and
    EHR integration.

(b) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.--There are authorized to be
    appropriated to carry out this section--
    (1) $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) $100,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
    (3) $75,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
    (4) $50,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) $25,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.

SEC. 8. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.

(a) ANNUAL REPORTS.--Not later than 18 months after the date of
    enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the Secretary
    shall submit to Congress a report that includes--
    (1) the status of State PDMP interoperability compliance;
    (2) aggregate data on controlled substance prescribing trends;
    (3) measurements of doctor shopping episode reductions; and
    (4) recommendations for program improvements.

(b) PUBLIC AVAILABILITY.--The Secretary shall make each report under
    subsection (a) publicly available on the internet website of the
    Department of Health and Human Services.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date that is 90 days after the
date of enactment of this Act.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4 (Interoperability Standards)**: Establishes federally mandated data standards to replace the current patchwork of state formats. The 12-month timeline is aggressive but feasible given existing PMPInterConnect infrastructure.
- **Section 5 (Mandatory Use)**: Sets a national floor for PDMP use mandates while preserving clinical exceptions for emergency, inpatient, and hospice settings. States may exceed the federal minimum.
- **Section 6 (Privacy)**: Establishes the strongest PDMP privacy protections in federal law, including warrant requirements for law enforcement access and prohibition on commercial use. This addresses the privacy objections that delayed PDMP adoption for years.
- **Section 7 (Grants)**: The $350 million five-year authorization is based on historical PDMP grant program levels and estimated state implementation costs.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Interoperability standards published | 12 months after enactment | ONC/HHS |
| State grant applications open | 15 months after enactment | SAMHSA |
| State compliance deadline (mandatory use) | 24 months after standards | States |
| EHR integration certification requirement | 36 months after enactment | ONC |
| First annual report to Congress | 18 months after enactment | HHS |

**Regulatory Authority**: HHS (ONC, SAMHSA) for standards and grants; DEA for registration compliance; state PDMP administrators for operational implementation.

**Challenges**:

- **State sovereignty concerns**: Some states may resist federal mandates on state-operated programs. The grant-and-condition model mitigates this by offering funding contingent on compliance.
- **EHR vendor cooperation**: Integrating PDMP data into EHR systems requires cooperation from major EHR vendors (Epic, Cerner/Oracle, MEDITECH). ONC certification requirements provide leverage.

**Refinements**:

- **Add clinical decision support integration**: Require CDS alerts triggered by PDMP data (high MME prescriptions, concurrent opioid-benzodiazepine prescriptions, multiple prescribers).
- **Include veterinary prescriber coverage**: Address the documented diversion pathway through veterinary controlled substance prescriptions.

### The Pharmacy Benefit Manager Accountability Act

**Purpose**: Require PBM transparency, establish fiduciary duty to health plan sponsors, and prohibit anti-competitive practices including spread pricing, rebate retention, and self-referral.

**Key Provisions**:

1. Establish PBM fiduciary duty to health plans
2. Mandate 100% pass-through of manufacturer rebates to plan sponsors
3. Prohibit spread pricing in all federal programs; require disclosure in commercial markets
4. Ban self-referral to PBM-owned specialty pharmacies without patient opt-in
5. Require annual disclosure of aggregate PBM financial data

**Draft Text**:

```text
119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To establish transparency and fiduciary duty requirements for
pharmacy benefit managers and to prohibit certain anti-competitive
practices in the prescription drug supply chain.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Pharmacy Benefit Manager
Accountability Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) According to the Drug Channels Institute (2024), the 3 largest
    pharmacy benefit managers control approximately 80 percent of
    the prescription drug benefits market, covering approximately
    277,000,000 Americans.
(2) The Federal Trade Commission found in its 2024 interim report
    that PBM business practices, including spread pricing and rebate
    retention, may inflate prescription drug costs for health plans,
    employers, and patients.
(3) Independent pharmacies have closed at a rate exceeding 2,000
    per year, partially driven by below-cost PBM reimbursement
    rates and DIR fee clawbacks.
(4) Vertical integration of PBMs with health insurers and pharmacy
    chains creates conflicts of interest that may not serve the
    interests of health plan sponsors or patients.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:

(1) PBM.--The term "pharmacy benefit manager" means any entity that
    manages prescription drug benefits on behalf of a health
    insurer, group health plan, or other payer.
(2) REBATE.--The term "rebate" means any discount, concession,
    dispensing fee, or other consideration provided by a
    pharmaceutical manufacturer to a PBM in connection with the
    utilization of a drug product.
(3) SPREAD PRICING.--The term "spread pricing" means the practice
    of a PBM charging a health plan a higher amount for a drug
    than the amount the PBM reimburses the dispensing pharmacy.
(4) FIDUCIARY DUTY.--The term "fiduciary duty" means the duty to
    act solely in the interest of the health plan and its
    beneficiaries with respect to the management of prescription
    drug benefits.

SEC. 4. FIDUCIARY DUTY.

(a) IN GENERAL.--Each PBM shall owe a fiduciary duty to the health
    plan sponsor it serves with respect to all aspects of
    prescription drug benefit management, including formulary
    design, rebate negotiation, pharmacy network management, and
    claims adjudication.

(b) STANDARD OF CARE.--A PBM acting in its fiduciary capacity
    shall--
    (1) act solely in the interest of the health plan and its
        beneficiaries;
    (2) exercise prudence in managing prescription drug benefits;
    (3) avoid conflicts of interest and self-dealing; and
    (4) provide full disclosure of all compensation received in
        connection with the management of prescription drug benefits.

SEC. 5. REBATE PASS-THROUGH.

(a) FEDERAL PROGRAMS.--Effective January 1, 2028, each PBM
    administering prescription drug benefits for Medicare Part D,
    Medicaid managed care, FEHBP, TRICARE, or any other federally
    funded health program shall pass through 100 percent of
    manufacturer rebates to the health plan sponsor.

(b) COMMERCIAL PLANS.--Each PBM administering commercial health plan
    prescription drug benefits shall disclose to the plan sponsor--
    (1) the total amount of rebates received from manufacturers;
    (2) the percentage and dollar amount of rebates retained by the
        PBM; and
    (3) the percentage and dollar amount of rebates passed through
        to the plan sponsor.

SEC. 6. PROHIBITION ON SPREAD PRICING.

(a) FEDERAL PROGRAMS.--Effective January 1, 2028, spread pricing
    is prohibited in all federally funded health programs.

(b) COMMERCIAL PLANS.--Each PBM shall disclose to each commercial
    plan sponsor, on a quarterly basis, the aggregate spread between
    amounts charged to the plan and amounts reimbursed to pharmacies.

SEC. 7. SPECIALTY PHARMACY SELF-REFERRAL PROHIBITION.

(a) IN GENERAL.--A PBM may not require, through formulary design,
    network restrictions, or other means, that a beneficiary obtain
    specialty drugs from a pharmacy owned by or affiliated with the
    PBM or its parent company, unless the beneficiary provides
    affirmative written opt-in consent after being informed of
    alternative pharmacy options.

SEC. 8. ANNUAL REPORTING.

(a) Each PBM shall submit to the Secretary of Health and Human
    Services and make publicly available an annual report including--
    (1) total revenue by category (administrative fees, rebates
        retained, spread pricing, specialty pharmacy operations);
    (2) aggregate rebate amounts received and passed through;
    (3) pharmacy reimbursement rates by category (independent,
        chain, mail-order, specialty); and
    (4) formulary exclusion lists with clinical justification.

SEC. 9. ENFORCEMENT.

(a) CIVIL PENALTIES.--The Secretary may impose a civil penalty of
    not more than $100,000 per violation per day for noncompliance
    with sections 4 through 8.

(b) PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.--A health plan sponsor or pharmacy
    harmed by a PBM's violation of this Act may bring a civil
    action for damages and injunctive relief.

(c) STATE ENFORCEMENT.--Nothing in this Act preempts State laws
    providing greater protections than those established herein.

SEC. 10. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary such sums
as may be necessary to carry out this Act.

SEC. 11. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date that is 180 days after
the date of enactment of this Act, except as otherwise specified.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4 (Fiduciary Duty)**: Establishes the most transformative provision -- requiring PBMs to act as fiduciaries to health plans rather than profit-maximizing intermediaries. This shifts the legal standard governing all PBM business decisions.
- **Section 5 (Rebate Pass-Through)**: Eliminates the core profit mechanism of rebate retention in federal programs and requires transparency in commercial markets. The two-tier approach addresses feasibility concerns while moving toward full pass-through.
- **Section 7 (Self-Referral)**: Directly addresses the vertical integration conflict of interest documented by the FTC, while allowing patients who prefer PBM-affiliated pharmacies to choose them.

**Challenges**:

- **ERISA Preemption**: Federal ERISA law may preempt some state-level PBM regulations for employer-sponsored plans. This federal bill establishes a national floor that overcomes ERISA preemption issues.
- **PBM Restructuring**: PBMs may restructure their corporate entities to circumvent provisions. The broad definition of "PBM" and inclusion of affiliates addresses this risk.

**Refinements**:

- **Anti-retaliation protections**: Add provisions prohibiting PBMs from retaliating against pharmacies that report violations or participate in regulatory proceedings.
- **Transition period for specialty pharmacy provisions**: Allow 18-month implementation period for specialty pharmacy self-referral prohibition to allow patients to transition care.

## State Model Legislation

### Model State PDMP Enhancement Act

**Purpose**: Strengthen state PDMPs beyond federal minimums by including non-scheduled drugs of concern, requiring delegate access for clinical staff, and implementing automated clinical alerts.

**Adaptability Notes**: States should customize the list of non-scheduled drugs of concern based on local prescribing patterns and emerging drug trends. States with existing robust PDMPs may focus on the automated alert provisions.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "[State] Prescription
Drug Monitoring Enhancement Act of 2026".

SECTION 2. ENHANCED DRUG MONITORING.

(a) In addition to Schedule II through V controlled substances, the
    State PDMP shall track dispensing of the following drugs of
    concern:
    (1) Gabapentin, in all formulations;
    (2) Promethazine with codeine combination products;
    (3) Muscle relaxants, including carisoprodol and cyclobenzaprine;
    (4) Any additional drug designated by the State Board of Pharmacy
        based on documented abuse potential.

(b) The State PDMP shall generate automated alerts to prescribers
    and dispensers when a patient's prescription history indicates:
    (1) Concurrent prescriptions for opioids and benzodiazepines;
    (2) Total daily opioid dosage exceeding 90 morphine milligram
        equivalents;
    (3) Prescriptions from 3 or more prescribers within 90 days for
        Schedule II controlled substances; or
    (4) Other patterns designated by the State Board of Medicine as
        indicative of elevated risk.

SECTION 3. DELEGATE ACCESS.

Licensed clinical staff, including nurses, physician assistants, and
medical assistants, may query the PDMP on behalf of a licensed
prescriber, provided that the prescriber reviews the results before
issuing or modifying a controlled substance prescription.

SECTION 4. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on [date].
```

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: HHS (for PDMP and pricing provisions), FTC (for PBM and competition provisions)

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **PDMP Interoperability Standards**: ONC must publish final standards within 12 months of enactment, incorporating public comment and technical input from state PDMP administrators
2. **PBM Reporting Requirements**: HHS must establish standardized reporting formats for PBM financial disclosures within 18 months
3. **EHR CDS Certification**: ONC must update EHR certification criteria to include PDMP integration and controlled substance CDS modules within 24 months

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Civil Penalties**: Up to $100,000 per day per violation for PBM noncompliance with transparency and fiduciary requirements
- **Administrative Actions**: HHS may suspend or revoke PBM participation in federal health programs for material violations
- **Private Right of Action**: Health plan sponsors and pharmacies may sue PBMs for damages resulting from violations of the Accountability Act
- **State Attorney General Enforcement**: State AGs retain authority to enforce state PBM laws not preempted by the federal Act

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Commerce Clause Authority**: Congressional authority to regulate PBMs and prescription drug markets rests firmly on the Commerce Clause. The prescription drug market is inherently interstate: drugs are manufactured, distributed, and sold across state lines; PBMs operate nationally; and Medicare/Medicaid are federal programs. The Supreme Court has consistently upheld federal regulation of interstate healthcare markets (*Gonzales v. Raich*, 545 U.S. 1 (2005); *NFIB v. Sebelius*, 567 U.S. 519 (2012)).

**Takings Clause Concerns**: The pharmaceutical industry has challenged the IRA's drug negotiation provisions as unconstitutional takings. The PDMP and PBM legislation proposed here do not set drug prices or compel manufacturers to sell at specified prices, and therefore do not raise takings concerns. The PBM Accountability Act regulates business practices, not prices, and is well within Commerce Clause regulatory authority.

**First Amendment (Compelled Speech)**: Some pharmaceutical companies have argued that mandatory price disclosure constitutes compelled commercial speech. Courts have generally upheld disclosure requirements under the intermediate scrutiny standard applied to commercial speech (*Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel*, 471 U.S. 626 (1985)).

### Preemption

The PBM Accountability Act explicitly preserves state laws that provide greater protections than federal minimums (Section 9(c)). This anti-preemption clause is critical because many states have enacted PBM transparency laws that could be undermined by federal legislation setting only a floor. ERISA preemption of state PBM laws remains a significant concern; the federal bill addresses this by establishing federal standards that apply regardless of ERISA.

### Enforcement and Compliance

PBM compliance will be monitored through annual reporting (Section 8), FTC oversight, state insurance department examinations, and private litigation by harmed parties. PDMP compliance will be monitored through HHS annual reports and CMS conditions of participation.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| PBM corporate restructuring | PBMs could restructure into multiple entities to argue that individual entities do not meet the PBM definition | High | Broaden the definition to include any entity performing PBM functions, regardless of corporate form, and extend to all affiliates and subsidiaries |
| Rebate reclassification | PBMs and manufacturers could reclassify rebates as "administrative fees" or "service charges" to circumvent pass-through requirements | High | Define "rebate" broadly to include any consideration flowing from manufacturer to PBM in connection with drug utilization, regardless of label |
| PDMP exception exploitation | Prescribers could classify non-emergency prescriptions as "emergency" to avoid PDMP queries | Medium | Require documentation of emergency status in the medical record; audit emergency exception usage rates |
| Specialty pharmacy affiliate creation | PBMs could create nominally independent specialty pharmacies that are functionally controlled but technically not "owned" | Medium | Define "affiliated" to include any entity under common ownership, control, or economic interest, including contractual arrangements |
| Data delay tactics | States could technically comply with interoperability mandates while maintaining slow query times or incomplete data | Medium | Set maximum query response times (5 seconds) and minimum data completeness standards (99%) in federal standards |
| Formulary manipulation | PBMs could comply with rebate pass-through while shifting to performance-based contracts that achieve similar economic effects | Medium | Require disclosure of all forms of manufacturer-to-PBM compensation, including performance guarantees, volume commitments, and market share contracts |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| Federal legislation does not directly regulate drug prices beyond Medicare | Commercial market patients continue to pay high brand-name prices | Political opposition to commercial price regulation; existing IRA limited to Medicare | Phase 2-3 reforms extend price benchmarks to commercial market; importation provides interim competitive pressure |
| PBM fiduciary duty may be difficult to enforce in practice | Proving breach of fiduciary duty requires costly litigation | Fiduciary duty is a legal standard that depends on case-by-case judicial determination | Supplement fiduciary duty with specific prohibited practices (spread pricing, rebate retention) that are easier to prove |
| PDMP mandates do not address prescribing culture | Mandatory checks reduce doctor shopping but do not necessarily improve prescribing quality | PDMPs are monitoring tools, not clinical education instruments | Complement PDMP mandates with CME requirements and CDS integration |
| Veterinary controlled substance prescribing gap | Veterinary prescriptions are not consistently tracked in PDMPs, creating a diversion pathway | Veterinary prescribing was historically outside PDMP scope | Include veterinary prescribers in PDMP reporting requirements through subsequent amendment |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Broaden PBM definition through implementing regulations**: HHS should issue regulations defining "pharmacy benefit manager" to encompass all entities performing PBM functions, regardless of corporate structure, including group purchasing organizations and pharmacy services administrative organizations.
2. **Expand rebate definition**: Regulatory guidance should specify that all forms of manufacturer-to-PBM financial flows -- including administrative fees, data fees, service charges, and performance bonuses -- are subject to pass-through requirements.
3. **Audit PDMP exception usage**: Require state PDMP administrators to audit emergency exception rates quarterly and flag prescribers whose exception usage exceeds two standard deviations from the mean for review by medical licensing boards.
4. **Add veterinary prescriber coverage**: Introduce supplemental legislation requiring licensed veterinarians to report controlled substance prescriptions to the PDMP within 24 hours.
5. **Commercial price transparency**: As a stepping stone to Phase 2-3 commercial price benchmarks, require pharmaceutical manufacturers to publicly report and justify any price increase exceeding the CPI-U for the prior year.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

Both Acts should include a 10-year reauthorization requirement with a mandatory GAO evaluation at year 5, examining:

- PDMP interoperability achievement rates and remaining gaps
- PBM compliance rates and market structure changes
- Impact on prescription drug costs, access, and safety metrics
- Unintended consequences and recommended adjustments
