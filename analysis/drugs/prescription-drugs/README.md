# Prescription Drug Policy

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of prescription drug regulation, monitoring, and reform in the United States.

## Overview

Prescription drugs are a critical component of American healthcare, yet the systems governing their approval, distribution, prescribing, and pricing have produced a series of interconnected crises. The opioid epidemic was ignited by aggressive prescribing of Schedule II painkillers, enabled by inadequate monitoring and pharmaceutical industry influence. Today, Americans pay the highest prescription drug prices in the developed world, while pharmacy benefit managers operate with minimal transparency, generic drug competition faces systematic obstruction, and prescription drug monitoring programs remain fragmented across state lines.

This analysis examines the regulatory apparatus governing prescription drugs -- from FDA approval and DEA scheduling through prescribing practices, pharmacy benefit management, and patient access. It covers the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) infrastructure, the crisis of overprescribing and doctor shopping, the role of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) in pricing, drug importation policy, generic drug access barriers, and controlled substance oversight. The analysis proposes evidence-based reforms to strengthen monitoring, improve access, reduce costs, and prevent the next prescribing-driven addiction crisis.

The prescription drug policy landscape sits at the intersection of public health, market regulation, and criminal enforcement. Effective reform requires balancing legitimate patient access to necessary medications against the risks of diversion, abuse, and price exploitation -- all while navigating powerful industry opposition.
