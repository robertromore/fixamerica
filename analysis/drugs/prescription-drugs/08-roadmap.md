# Prescription Drug Policy: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

Reform of the prescription drug system requires a phased approach that sequences politically achievable reforms first -- building momentum and demonstrating results -- before tackling the more structurally difficult challenges of drug pricing, patent reform, and market restructuring. Phase 1 focuses on transparency, monitoring modernization, and implementation of existing authorities (IRA, FTC). Phase 2 expands pricing reform, enacts patent legislation, and launches importation programs. Phase 3 pursues long-term structural transformation including commercial market price benchmarks and public R&D capacity. Each phase builds on the institutional capacity, political capital, and evidence base generated by the previous phase.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation and Transparency (Years 1-2)

### Objectives

- Achieve full national PDMP interoperability
- Enact comprehensive PBM transparency legislation
- Implement IRA drug price negotiations on schedule
- Launch FTC enforcement actions against anti-competitive PBM and pharmaceutical practices
- Standardize controlled substance prescribing education requirements

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Enact PBM Transparency and Accountability Act | Congress | Months 1-12 | Bipartisan legislative coalition | Bill signed into law |
| Publish national PDMP interoperability standards | ONC/SAMHSA | Months 1-12 | $50 million for standards development | Standards published in Federal Register |
| Complete IRA first-round drug price negotiations | CMS | Months 1-12 (already underway) | Existing CMS authority and staff | Negotiated prices for 10 drugs effective January 2026 |
| Issue FTC final rule on PBM unfair practices | FTC | Months 6-18 | Existing FTC authority; potential congressional confirmation of commissioners | Rule published in Federal Register |
| Fund state PDMP upgrade grants | SAMHSA/CDC | Months 6-18 | $200 million in appropriations | Grants awarded to all 50 states |
| Finalize DEA telehealth prescribing permanent rule | DEA | Months 6-12 | Existing rulemaking authority | Final rule published |
| Mandate 8-hour controlled substance CME for DEA registrants | Congress/DEA | Months 6-18 | Minimal federal cost; prescriber time | Mandate effective within 24 months |

### Legislative Requirements

- PBM Transparency and Accountability Act (bipartisan bills already introduced in both chambers)
- PDMP Modernization Authorization (new appropriations or reauthorization of Harold Rogers grant program)
- Controlled Substance CME mandate (may be included in DEA reauthorization or standalone bill)

### Expected Outcomes

Phase 1 will establish the transparency and monitoring infrastructure necessary for deeper reforms. PBM transparency will reveal the magnitude of rebate retention and spread pricing, building public support for further reform. National PDMP interoperability will close remaining cross-state monitoring gaps. IRA implementation will demonstrate that Medicare negotiation can produce savings without harming drug access.

## Phase 2: Pricing Reform and Competition (Years 3-5)

### Objectives

- Expand Medicare drug price negotiation to 100+ drugs
- Enact patent reform legislation targeting anti-competitive practices
- Launch regulated drug importation from Canada and the EU
- Reduce biologic data exclusivity from 12 to 7 years
- Deploy clinical decision support tools in all certified EHR systems

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Enact Expanded Drug Negotiation Act | Congress | Months 24-36 | Political capital from Phase 1 results | Legislation signed; 100+ drugs eligible by Year 5 |
| Enact FAIR Generics Act (patent reform) | Congress | Months 24-36 | FTC/PTO support for reform framework | Legislation signed into law |
| Certify Canadian drug importation under Section 804 | HHS/FDA | Months 24-36 | $50 million for certification infrastructure | Certification issued; first state programs operational |
| Reduce biologic data exclusivity to 7 years | Congress | Months 30-42 | Legislative analysis showing savings | Legislation signed into law |
| Mandate CDS for controlled substance prescribing in EHRs | ONC/CMS | Months 24-36 | $150 million for development and deployment | CDS modules included in certified EHR standards |
| Expand drug importation to EU countries | HHS/FDA | Months 36-60 | Additional certification assessments | EU importation channels operational |
| Complete state PDMP-EHR integration | States/ONC | Months 36-60 | $300 million in implementation grants | 90%+ of prescribers using integrated systems |

### Legislative Requirements

- Expanded Drug Price Negotiation Act (amending IRA provisions to accelerate scope and reduce eligibility wait times)
- Fostering Access and Innovation in Rx (FAIR) Generics Act (patent reform targeting thickets, pay-for-delay, REMS abuse)
- Biologic Price Competition and Innovation Act Amendments (reducing data exclusivity)
- Drug Importation Acceleration Act (strengthening Section 804 implementation authority)

### Expected Outcomes

Phase 2 will produce measurable reductions in drug prices, accelerated generic competition, and improved prescribing practices. Medicare negotiation expansion will demonstrate scalability and generate tens of billions in savings. Patent reform will begin to dismantle the strategies that delay generic entry. Importation will create competitive price pressure on brand-name drugs. CDS integration will shift prescribing toward evidence-based practice at the point of care.

## Phase 3: Structural Transformation (Years 6-10)

### Objectives

- Extend negotiated pricing benchmarks to the commercial market
- Establish federal health technology assessment infrastructure
- Achieve full PDMP-EHR integration with automated clinical intelligence nationwide
- Build public pharmaceutical R&D capacity to reduce dependence on industry-funded innovation
- Evaluate and refine all Phase 1-2 reforms based on outcomes data

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Establish commercial market price benchmarks | Congress/CMS | Months 60-72 | Political support from demonstrated Medicare savings | Legislation establishing benchmark system |
| Create National HTA Institute | Congress/HHS | Months 60-84 | $200 million annual budget; 300+ FTE staff | Institute operational; first assessments published |
| Expand NIH translational research capacity | Congress/NIH | Months 60-120 | $1 billion annually in expanded appropriations | Public-funded drug development pipeline operational |
| Achieve universal PDMP-EHR integration | ONC/States | Months 60-84 | $200 million in final implementation grants | 99%+ prescriber integration rate |
| Comprehensive reform evaluation and adjustment | GAO/CMS/HHS | Months 72-120 | Evaluation studies funded in Phase 1-2 legislation | Published evaluation reports; legislative adjustments |

### Expected Outcomes

Phase 3 will complete the transformation of the prescription drug system from an industry-dominated market with minimal government oversight into a transparent, competitive market with evidence-based pricing, universal monitoring, and public investment in innovation. The commercial price benchmark will end the U.S.-only monopoly pricing model. The HTA Institute will enable systematic evaluation of drug value. Public R&D capacity will ensure that innovation is not held hostage to industry pricing demands.

## Governance and Oversight

### Implementation Oversight

- **Congressional oversight**: Senate HELP Committee and House Energy & Commerce Committee hold annual hearings on reform implementation progress
- **GAO audits**: Biennial GAO audits of PDMP interoperability, PBM compliance, drug negotiation implementation, and importation program safety
- **CMS reporting**: Quarterly public reports on Medicare negotiation savings, Part D out-of-pocket trends, and formulary changes
- **FTC enforcement**: Annual report on PBM compliance, enforcement actions, and market concentration trends
- **HHS Inspector General**: Regular audits of drug importation program safety and supply chain integrity

### Interagency Coordination

Prescription drug reform spans FDA, DEA, CMS, FTC, ONC, SAMHSA, NIH, and state agencies. An interagency prescription drug policy coordination body, chaired by HHS and reporting to the Domestic Policy Council, should be established to prevent siloed implementation and ensure reform coherence.

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Pharmaceutical Industry Legal Challenges

**Likelihood**: High (already occurring under the IRA)

**Impact**: High -- successful challenges could invalidate price negotiation, importation, or patent reform provisions

**Mitigation Strategy**: Design all legislation with strong constitutional foundations (Commerce Clause authority, spending power, public health justification). Include severability clauses so that individual provisions can be struck without invalidating entire reforms. Build a robust administrative record documenting the public health necessity of each reform.

**Contingency Plan**: If court challenges succeed, pursue reforms through regulatory authority (FTC rulemaking, CMS program requirements, DEA quota adjustments) that are less vulnerable to takings or compelled speech challenges.

---

### Risk 2: Drug Supply Disruption

**Likelihood**: Medium -- particularly for importation and aggressive price negotiation

**Impact**: High -- drug shortages harm patients and erode reform support

**Mitigation Strategy**: Phase importation gradually, starting with drugs that have multiple international manufacturers. Maintain emergency supply reserves for critical medications. Negotiate prices above manufacturers' marginal cost to avoid withdrawal incentives. Monitor supply chains through FDA drug shortage tracking.

**Contingency Plan**: Invoke emergency procurement authority through the Strategic National Stockpile. Use Defense Production Act authority as a backstop for critical drug production.

---

### Risk 3: Political Opposition and Lobby Pressure

**Likelihood**: High -- the pharmaceutical industry will deploy its $374 million annual lobbying budget against structural reforms

**Impact**: Medium -- may slow or weaken reforms but unlikely to prevent all action given bipartisan support for key measures

**Mitigation Strategy**: Sequence reforms to build momentum from bipartisan wins (PBM transparency, PDMP modernization) before pursuing partisan priorities (expanded negotiation, patent reform). Invest in public education campaigns documenting reform results. Build employer and patient advocacy coalitions as political counterweights.

**Contingency Plan**: If federal legislation stalls, accelerate state-level reforms and use executive authority to implement available administrative actions.

---

### Risk 4: Unintended Prescribing Consequences

**Likelihood**: Medium -- overly rigid prescribing reforms could harm chronic pain patients

**Impact**: Medium -- patient access problems and political backlash

**Mitigation Strategy**: Design prescribing reforms with clinical flexibility provisions (soft alerts, not hard stops in CDS systems). Engage pain medicine specialists in guideline development. Include patient feedback mechanisms in all monitoring systems. Fund non-opioid pain management research and access programs.

**Contingency Plan**: Establish rapid-response guideline revision processes to address documented access problems within 6 months of identification.
