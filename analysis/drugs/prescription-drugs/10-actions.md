# Prescription Drug Policy: What You Can Do

Prescription drug policy reform depends on sustained citizen engagement. The pharmaceutical and PBM industries spend over $400 million annually on lobbying to maintain the status quo. Counterbalancing that influence requires organized public pressure, informed advocacy, and strategic engagement at every level of government.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- Subscribe to *STAT News* (<https://www.statnews.com/>) for daily reporting on pharmaceutical industry, FDA decisions, and drug pricing developments
- Follow the Kaiser Family Foundation's health tracking polls (<https://www.kff.org/>) for the latest data on drug affordability and public opinion
- Track your own prescription drug costs and compare prices across pharmacies using GoodRx (<https://www.goodrx.com/>) or RxSaver (<https://www.rxsaver.com/>)
- Read the AARP Rx Price Watch reports to understand annual drug price trends
- Check the CMS Open Payments database (<https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/>) to see if your physicians receive pharmaceutical industry payments

### Make Personal Changes

- Ask your prescriber about generic alternatives for every prescription -- generic drugs save 80-85% on average
- Request biosimilar options for any biologic drug you are prescribed
- Use your state's PDMP patient portal (where available) to review your own prescription history
- Dispose of unused controlled substances at DEA-authorized collection sites or during National Prescription Drug Take Back Day events
- If you take multiple medications, request a comprehensive medication review from your pharmacist to identify potential interactions and unnecessary prescriptions

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact Your Representatives**: Demand action on PBM transparency, drug pricing reform, and PDMP modernization. Be specific about which bills you support.
- **Submit Public Comments**: Comment on FDA, DEA, and CMS proposed rules related to drug approval, prescribing, and pricing. Federal rulemaking public comment periods are listed at <https://www.regulations.gov/>.
- **Write Letters to the Editor**: Share your personal experience with drug costs, pharmacy closures, or prescribing issues in your local newspaper. Personal stories are among the most effective advocacy tools.
- **Share Information**: Post factual information about drug pricing, PBM practices, and reform proposals on social media, linking to credible sources.

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- Form a local prescription drug advocacy group through your community health center, church, or civic organization to share information and coordinate advocacy
- Host a community forum on prescription drug costs featuring your local pharmacist, a patient advocate, and an elected official
- Organize a "drug price town hall" inviting your congressional representative to discuss their position on drug pricing legislation and PBM reform
- Partner with your local independent pharmacy to document and publicize the impact of PBM practices on your community's pharmacy access

### Build Coalitions

- Connect with local AARP chapters, which have made drug pricing a top legislative priority and provide advocacy training and materials
- Engage local business groups and chambers of commerce on drug cost issues -- employers are powerful allies who bear rising drug costs through employee health plans
- Build relationships with state pharmacy boards and pharmacist associations to advocate for PDMP improvements and PBM reform at the state level
- Work with patient advocacy organizations for specific conditions (diabetes, cancer, rare diseases) to amplify drug access and pricing messages

## Political Actions

### Contact Elected Officials

**When to Contact**:

- When drug pricing legislation is pending in committee or on the floor (check Congress.gov for bill status)
- During FDA or DEA rulemaking comment periods on prescribing rules, drug approval standards, or controlled substance policies
- When your state legislature is considering PBM transparency, PDMP reform, or drug importation legislation
- When annual appropriations bills are being considered -- drug policy programs require sustained funding

**What to Say -- Template Email**:

```
Subject: Support Prescription Drug Reform - PBM Transparency and Fair Drug Pricing

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

I am a constituent from [City, State], and I am writing to urge you to support comprehensive prescription drug reform, including PBM transparency legislation, expanded Medicare drug price negotiation, and PDMP modernization.

[Optional: Share a brief personal experience with high drug costs, pharmacy closures in your community, or prescribing issues]

Specifically, I ask you to:
1. Co-sponsor and vote for PBM transparency legislation requiring fiduciary duty, pass-through pricing, and prohibition of specialty pharmacy self-referral
2. Support expanding Medicare drug price negotiation beyond the current IRA provisions
3. Fund national PDMP interoperability to prevent controlled substance diversion and protect patient safety

The pharmaceutical and PBM industries spend over $400 million annually lobbying to block reform. Your constituents need you to prioritize their health and financial wellbeing over industry lobbying.

Thank you for your service and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say -- Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City]. I'm calling to ask [Representative/Senator] [Name] to support prescription drug reform, specifically PBM transparency and expanded Medicare drug price negotiation. Americans pay two to three times more for the same drugs as citizens of other countries, and PBM practices are driving independent pharmacies out of business. Please note my strong support for drug pricing reform and PBM accountability. Thank you."
```

### Support Legislation

Current or proposed legislation to support:

- **PBM Transparency and Accountability Act**: Bipartisan bills in both chambers requiring PBM fiduciary duty, pass-through rebates, and transparency disclosures -- Contact members of the Senate HELP Committee and House Energy & Commerce Committee
- **Expanded Drug Price Negotiation**: Proposals to increase the number of drugs subject to Medicare negotiation and reduce the eligibility waiting period -- Contact your senators and representative
- **FAIR Generics Act (patent reform)**: Proposals to limit patent thickets, prohibit REMS abuse for generic blocking, and strengthen FTC antitrust authority -- Contact members of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees
- **Drug Importation proposals**: State and federal proposals to enable regulated importation from Canada and other countries with comparable safety standards -- Contact your state legislators as well as federal representatives

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "What specific actions will you take to lower prescription drug prices, and will you support expanding Medicare price negotiation?"
2. "Do you support requiring PBMs to act as fiduciaries to health plans and to pass through 100% of manufacturer rebates?"
3. "Will you support patent reform legislation to prevent pharmaceutical companies from using patent thickets to block generic competition?"
4. "Do you support federal funding for national PDMP interoperability and mandatory controlled substance monitoring?"

**Voting Considerations**:

- Check candidates' pharmaceutical industry campaign contribution records at OpenSecrets.org
- Review their voting history on drug pricing legislation (IRA, PBM reform bills, patent reform)
- Look for endorsements from patient advocacy organizations vs. pharmaceutical industry PACs
- Members of the Senate HELP Committee, Senate Finance Committee, House Energy & Commerce Committee, and House Ways & Means Committee have the most direct influence on prescription drug policy

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing prescription drug policy with others, emphasize:

1. **Americans pay 2-3x more for the same drugs**: U.S. brand-name drug prices are 2.78 times higher than the OECD average (RAND, 2024). The same pill, made in the same factory, costs dramatically less in Canada, Germany, and Japan.
2. **Three companies control 80% of your pharmacy benefits**: CVS Caremark, Express Scripts, and OptumRx process prescriptions for 277 million Americans with minimal transparency into their pricing practices. The FTC found their practices may inflate costs.
3. **91% of prescriptions are generic, but generics are only 18% of spending**: The remaining 82% of drug spending goes to brand-name drugs, many of which could face competition if patent gaming were curtailed. Over 100 drugs have no generic competitor despite expired patents.
4. **The opioid crisis was a prescribing crisis**: At its peak, 255 million opioid prescriptions were written in a single year. Better monitoring and prescribing standards can prevent the next drug class from becoming an epidemic.
5. **Reform saves money**: CBO estimates that expanded Medicare negotiation alone could save $100+ billion over a decade. PBM transparency reforms in Ohio recovered $224 million in a single year.

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "Drug price controls will kill innovation" | CBO estimates IRA negotiation reduces new drugs by ~1% over 30 years; countries with price controls (Germany, UK, Japan) maintain robust pharma sectors | CBO, 2024; OECD, 2024 |
| "PBMs save consumers money" | PBM profits depend on high list prices and opaque rebates; FTC found practices may inflate net costs | FTC Interim Report, 2024 |
| "Imported drugs are unsafe" | Drugs from Canada are made by the same manufacturers to the same standards; the safety objection is an industry talking point to protect pricing | FDA; ASPE, 2020 |
| "PDMPs violate patient privacy" | PDMPs with proper safeguards protect privacy while preventing diversion; the absence of monitoring contributed to 700,000+ opioid deaths | PDMP TTAC, 2024; CDC, 2024 |
| "High drug prices are necessary to fund R&D" | Only 10-25% of pharma revenue goes to R&D; NIH-funded research contributed to 100% of drugs approved 2010-2016 | Cleary et al., *PNAS*, 2018 |
