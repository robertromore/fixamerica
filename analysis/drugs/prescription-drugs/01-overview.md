# Prescription Drug Policy: Overview

## Executive Summary

The United States prescription drug system is a paradox of innovation and dysfunction. American pharmaceutical research produces approximately 65% of new molecular entities approved worldwide, yet Americans pay two to three times more for the same medications than citizens of other wealthy nations. In 2023, total U.S. prescription drug spending reached $405 billion at retail pharmacies alone, with specialty drugs accounting for over 50% of costs despite serving less than 2% of patients. The system that delivers these drugs -- from FDA approval through pharmacy benefit management to patient copay -- is riddled with misaligned incentives, opacity, and regulatory gaps that simultaneously inflate costs, enable abuse, and restrict legitimate access.

The prescription drug crisis extends far beyond pricing. The opioid epidemic was fundamentally a prescribing crisis: at its 2012 peak, U.S. clinicians wrote 255 million opioid prescriptions -- enough for every adult in the country. Although opioid prescribing has declined 44% since that peak to 142 million prescriptions in 2022, the damage cascaded into heroin and fentanyl markets, and overprescribing of other drug classes -- benzodiazepines, gabapentinoids, stimulants -- continues with insufficient oversight. Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs), the primary tool for tracking controlled substance prescribing, are operational in all 50 states and the District of Columbia but remain fragmented, with inconsistent interstate data sharing and variable mandate structures.

Pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) -- the middlemen who negotiate drug prices between manufacturers, insurers, and pharmacies -- have consolidated into three firms (CVS Caremark, Express Scripts, OptumRx) that control approximately 80% of the market. Their business practices, including opaque rebate structures, spread pricing, and restrictive formularies, have drawn bipartisan criticism for driving up costs while generating enormous profits. Meanwhile, generic drug competition, which should function as the primary market-based cost control mechanism, is systematically undermined through patent thickets, authorized generics, pay-for-delay settlements, and REMS abuse.

This analysis addresses the full lifecycle of prescription drug policy: how drugs are approved and scheduled, how they are prescribed and monitored, how they are priced and distributed, and how the system can be reformed to serve patients rather than industry shareholders.

## Scope

This analysis covers the key aspects of prescription drug policy:

- **FDA Approval and Drug Safety**: The drug approval process, post-market surveillance, accelerated approval pathways, and the balance between speed-to-market and safety
- **Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs)**: State-level electronic databases tracking controlled substance prescriptions, interstate interoperability, mandatory use requirements, and effectiveness
- **Prescribing Practices and Oversight**: Overprescribing patterns, controlled substance prescribing guidelines, continuing medical education, and clinical decision support tools
- **Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs)**: Market concentration, rebate structures, spread pricing, formulary design, and transparency reform
- **Drug Pricing and Access**: Manufacturer pricing practices, generic drug competition, drug importation, patient assistance programs, and the Inflation Reduction Act's Medicare negotiation provisions
- **Controlled Substance Diversion**: Doctor shopping, pill mills, drug diversion schemes, and enforcement mechanisms
- **Generic and Biosimilar Competition**: Patent system abuses, FDA generic approval backlogs, citizen petition gaming, and biosimilar adoption barriers

## Core Tensions and Tradeoffs

- **Innovation vs. Affordability**: The pharmaceutical industry argues that high drug prices fund research and development, yet only 10-25% of revenue is typically spent on R&D, while profit margins for major pharmaceutical companies average 15-20%. Aggressive price regulation risks reducing innovation incentives, but the current system prices many Americans out of essential medications.
- **Prescribing Freedom vs. Patient Safety**: Physicians resist restrictions on prescribing autonomy, arguing that clinical judgment should not be overridden by regulatory mandates. However, the opioid crisis demonstrated that unmonitored prescribing freedom can produce catastrophic public health consequences when combined with industry marketing pressure and inadequate training.
- **Speed of Approval vs. Safety Certainty**: The FDA faces constant pressure to approve drugs faster through accelerated pathways, breakthrough designations, and emergency authorizations. Faster approval benefits patients with unmet needs but increases the risk of approving drugs with incomplete safety profiles, as demonstrated by controversies over accelerated approvals like aducanumab (Aduhelm).
- **Market Competition vs. Patent Protection**: The patent system is designed to reward innovation with temporary market exclusivity, but pharmaceutical companies have developed sophisticated strategies (patent thickets, product hopping, pay-for-delay) to extend monopoly pricing well beyond the original patent term, costing consumers and taxpayers billions.
- **Federal Uniformity vs. State Flexibility**: Prescription drug monitoring is primarily a state function, creating 50+ separate databases with varying standards, mandates, and interoperability levels. Federal standardization could improve monitoring effectiveness but raises federalism concerns and requires overriding established state regulatory frameworks.
- **Enforcement vs. Access**: Tightening controlled substance regulations to prevent diversion and abuse can inadvertently restrict access for patients with legitimate pain or psychiatric conditions, creating a chilling effect on prescribers and forcing patients into undertreated or untreated conditions.

## Key Questions

1. How can the prescription drug monitoring system be modernized into a truly national, interoperable network that prevents doctor shopping and diversion without creating barriers to legitimate prescribing?
2. What regulatory framework can effectively control prescription drug prices while preserving incentives for pharmaceutical innovation?
3. How should PBM business practices be reformed to ensure transparency, competition, and alignment with patient interests rather than profit maximization?
4. What prescribing oversight mechanisms can prevent the next overprescribing crisis without reducing physician autonomy to the point of harming patient care?

## Vision of Success

A successful prescription drug policy system in the 21st century would feature:

- **Universal PDMP Interoperability**: A nationally integrated prescription drug monitoring network providing real-time, cross-state data to every prescriber and dispenser, reducing doctor shopping to near zero and enabling early identification of problematic prescribing patterns
- **Transparent Drug Pricing**: A prescription drug market in which manufacturers publicly justify price increases, PBMs pass through the full value of negotiated rebates, and patients pay predictable, affordable out-of-pocket costs -- with Medicare drug price negotiation expanded to cover at least 50 drugs within a decade
- **Evidence-Based Prescribing**: A clinical environment where prescribers have access to real-time clinical decision support, prescribing guidelines are regularly updated based on outcomes data, and continuing education requirements ensure competency in controlled substance management
- **Effective Generic Competition**: A pharmaceutical market in which generic drugs reach the market within one year of patent expiration, patent gaming strategies are effectively curtailed, and biosimilar adoption reaches levels comparable to European markets (80%+ substitution rates)
- **Accountable Oversight**: Robust FDA post-market surveillance, proactive DEA monitoring of distribution patterns, and coordinated federal-state enforcement against pill mills and diversion schemes -- with clear accountability when regulatory failures occur
