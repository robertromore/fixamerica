# Prescription Drug Policy: History

## Historical Development

The regulation of prescription drugs in the United States has evolved from virtually no oversight to a complex, multi-layered system spanning federal agencies, state programs, and industry self-regulation. This history is punctuated by crises -- thalidomide, Vioxx, OxyContin -- each of which exposed regulatory failures and prompted reform, often after significant harm had already occurred. Understanding this trajectory is essential for evaluating current policy and anticipating future challenges.

### The Foundations of Drug Regulation (1906-1950): From Patent Medicines to Federal Authority

- **Pre-Regulation Era**: In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the American pharmaceutical market was essentially unregulated. Patent medicines containing opium, cocaine, and alcohol were sold openly and marketed with extravagant health claims. The term "prescription drug" did not exist as a legal category.
- **Pure Food and Drug Act (1906)**: Following Upton Sinclair's *The Jungle* and muckraking journalism exposing adulterated products, Congress passed the first federal law requiring accurate labeling of food and drugs. The Act prohibited misbranded and adulterated products but did not require proof of safety or efficacy before sale.
- **Harrison Narcotics Tax Act (1914)**: This landmark law imposed a tax on the production and distribution of opiates and coca products and required registration of physicians and pharmacists who dispensed them. It was the first federal attempt to control prescription narcotics, though enforcement shifted to criminal prosecution of physicians who prescribed to addicts.
- **Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (1938)**: After the sulfanilamide disaster of 1937 -- in which an untested elixir killed 107 people, including many children -- Congress passed the FDC Act requiring manufacturers to prove drug safety before marketing. This established the pre-market approval paradigm that remains the foundation of FDA authority.
- **Durham-Humphrey Amendment (1951)**: This critical amendment to the FDC Act created the legal distinction between prescription and over-the-counter drugs, establishing the modern two-tier system. Drugs that were habit-forming, potentially toxic, or required medical supervision could only be dispensed with a prescription.

### The Modern Regulatory Era (1951-1980): Safety, Efficacy, and Controlled Substances

- **Thalidomide Crisis (1961-1962)**: The thalidomide tragedy -- in which a sedative caused severe birth defects in over 10,000 children worldwide -- catalyzed the most important pharmaceutical reform in American history. Although the drug was never approved in the U.S. (largely due to FDA reviewer Frances Oldham Kelsey's insistence on additional safety data), the near-miss galvanized Congressional action.
- **Kefauver-Harris Amendment (1962)**: Passed in direct response to thalidomide, this amendment required manufacturers to prove both safety *and* efficacy through "adequate and well-controlled" clinical trials before FDA approval. It also established requirements for informed consent in clinical trials, adverse event reporting, and good manufacturing practices. This law transformed the FDA from a reactive agency into a proactive gatekeeper.
- **Controlled Substances Act (1970)**: The CSA created the five-schedule classification system for drugs with abuse potential, established the Drug Enforcement Administration (later formalized in 1973), and imposed registration, recordkeeping, and quota requirements on manufacturers, distributors, prescribers, and dispensers of controlled substances. Schedule I drugs (including heroin, LSD, and cannabis) were deemed to have no accepted medical use and high abuse potential; Schedule II drugs (including opioids like morphine and oxycodone) required special prescribing procedures.
- **Drug Listing Act (1972)**: Required all commercial drug establishments to register with the FDA and list their products, creating the first comprehensive inventory of marketed drugs.
- **Early Prescription Monitoring**: New York became the first state to implement a prescription monitoring program in 1918, using triplicate prescription forms for controlled substances. This paper-based system -- which required prescribers to write controlled substance prescriptions in triplicate, with one copy sent to the state -- became a model for other states but was labor-intensive and generated data that was difficult to analyze.

### The Generic Drug Revolution and Market Dynamics (1980-1996): Access, Competition, and Industry Growth

- **Hatch-Waxman Act (1984)**: The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act fundamentally reshaped the pharmaceutical market. It created the Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) pathway, allowing generic manufacturers to gain FDA approval by demonstrating bioequivalence to the brand-name drug rather than repeating full clinical trials. It also granted brand-name manufacturers patent term extensions to compensate for time lost during FDA review. The Hatch-Waxman Act is directly responsible for the growth of the generic drug industry from less than 20% of prescriptions in 1984 to 91% in 2023.
- **180-Day Exclusivity and Its Consequences**: Hatch-Waxman's Paragraph IV provision granted the first generic applicant 180 days of market exclusivity, creating a powerful financial incentive for generic companies to challenge brand patents. However, this provision also created opportunities for pay-for-delay settlements, in which brand-name manufacturers paid generic challengers to delay market entry.
- **Prescription Drug Marketing Act (1987)**: In response to the diversion of prescription drug samples and concerns about counterfeit drugs entering the supply chain, Congress imposed requirements for the distribution of drug samples and prohibited the sale or trading of drug samples.
- **Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA, 1992)**: This law authorized the FDA to collect fees from pharmaceutical manufacturers to fund the drug review process, substantially reducing average review times from over 30 months to approximately 12 months. PDUFA fundamentally changed the FDA's relationship with the industry it regulates, creating a revenue dependency that critics argue compromises regulatory independence.
- **Beginning of Modern PBMs**: Pharmacy benefit managers emerged in the 1980s as third-party administrators processing prescription drug claims. Initially, PBMs served a straightforward administrative function, but by the 1990s they had expanded into formulary management, rebate negotiation, and mail-order pharmacy services, becoming powerful intermediaries in the drug supply chain.

### The Opioid Prescribing Crisis (1996-2016): Corporate Malfeasance and Regulatory Failure

- **OxyContin Launch (1996)**: Purdue Pharma's launch of extended-release oxycodone, marketed under the brand name OxyContin, marked the beginning of the prescription opioid epidemic. Purdue aggressively promoted OxyContin as having a low risk of addiction -- a claim that was demonstrably false and that the company later admitted was misleading. Purdue's marketing budget for OxyContin reached $200 million annually by 2001.
- **"Pain as the Fifth Vital Sign" Campaign (1990s-2000s)**: The American Pain Society's 1996 initiative to establish pain as a vital sign equal to temperature, blood pressure, pulse, and respiration -- later adopted by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) in 2001 -- created institutional pressure to treat pain more aggressively. While well-intentioned, this movement was amplified by pharmaceutical industry funding and contributed to a prescribing culture that normalized opioid use for chronic non-cancer pain.
- **Prescribing Peak (2010-2012)**: Opioid prescribing in the United States peaked at 255 million prescriptions in 2012, equaling approximately 81.3 prescriptions per 100 persons. This rate was more than double the prescribing rate of any other developed nation.
- **Purdue Pharma Guilty Plea (2007)**: Purdue Pharma and three executives pleaded guilty to federal charges of misbranding OxyContin, paying $634 million in fines. Despite this criminal conviction, Purdue continued to promote opioids aggressively, and no executive served prison time -- a failure of accountability that became a lasting symbol of corporate impunity.
- **First Electronic PDMPs**: Oklahoma launched the first electronic PDMP in 2004, beginning the transition from paper-based triplicate prescription systems to real-time electronic databases. By 2010, 35 states had operational electronic PDMPs, though most lacked mandatory-use requirements.
- **CDC Prescribing Guidelines (2016)**: The CDC issued its first comprehensive guidelines for prescribing opioids for chronic pain, recommending non-opioid therapies as the preferred first-line treatment and urging caution with dosages exceeding 90 morphine milligram equivalents (MME) per day. The guidelines were influential but also controversial, with some pain management specialists arguing they were overly restrictive and contributed to patient access problems.

### Reform and Reckoning (2016-Present): Litigation, Legislation, and Structural Change

- **SUPPORT Act (2018)**: The Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act was the most comprehensive federal opioid legislation in a generation. It expanded Medicaid coverage for substance use treatment, funded PDMP improvements, imposed electronic prescribing requirements for Medicare Part D controlled substances, and addressed workforce shortages. Authorized spending totaled approximately $8 billion over five years.
- **National Opioid Litigation**: Beginning in 2017, thousands of state, county, and city governments filed lawsuits against pharmaceutical manufacturers, distributors, and pharmacy chains for their roles in the opioid crisis. By 2024, total settlements exceeded $50 billion, with Purdue Pharma's bankruptcy alone yielding $6 billion (though the Sackler family immunity provisions were struck down and renegotiated by the Supreme Court).
- **Inflation Reduction Act (2022)**: The IRA authorized Medicare to negotiate prices on select high-cost drugs for the first time, imposed inflation penalties on manufacturers who raise prices faster than inflation, and capped Medicare Part D out-of-pocket costs at $2,000 annually. The first 10 drugs for negotiation were selected in 2023, with prices announced in August 2024.
- **FTC PBM Investigation (2022-2024)**: The Federal Trade Commission launched a comprehensive investigation into PBM business practices, issuing an interim report in July 2024 that documented spread pricing, rebate retention, specialty pharmacy steering, and anti-competitive consolidation.
- **X-Waiver Elimination (2023)**: The removal of the X-waiver requirement for buprenorphine prescribing -- a barrier that had limited the number of providers authorized to prescribe this critical opioid use disorder treatment -- expanded access to medication-assisted treatment significantly.
- **Missouri PDMP (2023)**: Missouri became the final state to establish a statewide PDMP, completing nationwide coverage. The long delay was primarily due to opposition from a single state senator who blocked legislation for nearly a decade on privacy grounds.

## Lessons from History

### Pattern 1: Crises Drive Reform, But Reform Lags Behind Harm

Every major advance in prescription drug regulation -- the 1938 FDC Act, the 1962 Kefauver-Harris Amendment, the CDC's 2016 opioid guidelines -- came only after a crisis had already caused significant harm. The sulfanilamide disaster killed 107 people before safety testing was required. Thalidomide harmed over 10,000 children before efficacy requirements were imposed. OxyContin contributed to hundreds of thousands of deaths before prescribing guidelines were issued. This pattern suggests that the United States lacks effective proactive surveillance mechanisms and that the political system responds to pharmaceutical industry harm only when public outrage reaches a critical threshold.

### Pattern 2: Industry Capture of Regulatory Processes

The pharmaceutical industry has repeatedly succeeded in shaping regulatory frameworks to serve its interests. PDUFA's user fee model created revenue dependency between the FDA and the industry it regulates. Hatch-Waxman's patent provisions were designed to facilitate generic competition but were systematically exploited through pay-for-delay and patent thicketing. The "pain as the fifth vital sign" campaign was amplified by industry funding. PBMs evolved from administrative processors into opaque profit centers. Each regulatory innovation created new mechanisms for industry capture, suggesting that structural safeguards -- not just new rules -- are needed to prevent regulatory capture.

### Pattern 3: Fragmented Federalism Delays National Solutions

The PDMP experience illustrates how American federalism can impede necessary national infrastructure. It took over two decades (2001-2023) to achieve universal electronic PDMP coverage, and full interoperability remains incomplete. Missouri's decade-long resistance to establishing a PDMP -- due to a single state senator's objections -- allowed doctor shopping to continue unchecked at a cost of lives. Similarly, state-by-state approaches to PBM regulation, prescribing mandates, and drug pricing have produced a patchwork of standards that sophisticated actors can exploit.

### Pattern 4: Unintended Consequences of Well-Intentioned Policies

Opioid prescribing restrictions successfully reduced prescription opioid use but contributed to transitions to heroin and fentanyl, which proved far more lethal. Hatch-Waxman successfully expanded generic access but also created the Paragraph IV litigation system that incentivized pay-for-delay. PDUFA accelerated drug approvals but may have compromised safety oversight. Effective prescription drug reform must anticipate and mitigate these downstream effects through adaptive policy design with built-in evaluation and correction mechanisms.
