# Prescription Drug Policy: Current State

## Prescribing Landscape

The United States remains one of the heaviest prescription drug consumers in the world. In 2023, approximately 6.7 billion prescriptions were dispensed at U.S. retail pharmacies, averaging roughly 20 prescriptions per capita. While this represents a mature market with relatively stable overall volume, the composition of prescribing has shifted significantly in recent years, driven by the opioid prescribing pullback, growth in specialty medications, and expanding use of GLP-1 receptor agonists for diabetes and obesity.

### Opioid Prescribing Trends

The decline in opioid prescribing from its 2012 peak of 255 million prescriptions to 142 million in 2022 represents one of the most dramatic prescribing shifts in modern medicine -- a 44% reduction over a decade. However, opioid prescribing rates remain elevated compared to other developed nations, and significant geographic variation persists.

| Metric | Value | Trend | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total opioid prescriptions (2022) | 142 million | Declining (-44% from 2012 peak) | CDC, 2023 |
| Opioid prescribing rate (2022) | 43.0 per 100 persons | Declining (from 81.3 in 2012) | CDC, 2023 |
| Highest state prescribing rate (2022) | Alabama: 74.5 per 100 | Declining but still elevated | CDC, 2023 |
| Lowest state prescribing rate (2022) | Hawaii: 27.8 per 100 | Stable | CDC, 2023 |
| High-dosage opioid prescriptions (>90 MME/day, 2022) | 5.1% of opioid prescriptions | Declining (from 11.5% in 2012) | CDC, 2023 |
| Average days' supply per opioid prescription (2022) | 17.8 days | Declining (from 18.4 in 2017) | IQVIA, 2023 |

### Non-Opioid Controlled Substance Trends

While opioid prescribing has declined, prescribing of other controlled substances has followed divergent paths. Benzodiazepine prescribing peaked later and has declined more slowly, while stimulant prescriptions have surged.

| Drug Class | Prescriptions (2023) | Trend | Concern Level | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Benzodiazepines | ~64 million | Declining slowly (-25% from 2013 peak) | High -- still overprescribed, dangerous with opioids | IQVIA, 2024 |
| Stimulants (ADHD medications) | ~63 million | Increasing (+35% since 2019) | Moderate -- shortages, diversion risk | IQVIA, 2024 |
| Gabapentinoids (gabapentin, pregabalin) | ~70 million | Stable/slight increase | Moderate -- increasing abuse reports | IQVIA, 2024 |
| Z-drugs (zolpidem, eszopiclone) | ~24 million | Declining | Low | IQVIA, 2024 |

## Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs (PDMPs)

### Coverage and Adoption

All 50 states and the District of Columbia now operate PDMPs, completing a nationwide rollout that took over two decades. Missouri was the last state to establish a statewide PDMP, doing so in 2023 after years of legislative resistance. However, the functionality, mandate structure, and interoperability of these programs vary enormously.

### Mandate Structures

| Mandate Type | States | Notes | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Mandatory check before prescribing controlled substances | 49 | Missouri's mandate effective 2024 | PDMP TTAC, 2024 |
| Mandatory check before every controlled substance prescription | 28 | Strongest mandate tier | PDMP TTAC, 2024 |
| Mandatory check for initial prescription only | 14 | Check not required for refills | PDMP TTAC, 2024 |
| Mandatory check based on clinical judgment | 7 | Weaker mandate, prescriber discretion | PDMP TTAC, 2024 |
| Voluntary use only | 1 (New Hampshire) | No mandate in statute | PDMP TTAC, 2024 |

### Interstate Data Sharing

Interstate PDMP interoperability remains a critical weakness. The Prescription Monitoring Program InterConnect (PMPInterConnect) system, operated by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP), enables interstate data sharing, but participation is uneven and data formats are not fully standardized.

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| States connected to PMPInterConnect | 49 + D.C. + Guam | NABP, 2024 |
| States with bidirectional data sharing | 42 | NABP, 2024 |
| Average query response time (intrastate) | <2 seconds | PDMP TTAC, 2024 |
| Average query response time (interstate) | 5-30 seconds | PDMP TTAC, 2024 |
| Scheduled substances tracked | II-V (varies by state) | PDMP TTAC, 2024 |
| States also tracking non-scheduled drugs of concern | 12 | PDMP TTAC, 2024 |

### PDMP Effectiveness Evidence

Research on PDMP effectiveness has produced mixed but generally positive results. Studies consistently find that mandatory-use PDMPs are associated with reductions in opioid prescribing, doctor shopping, and -- more recently -- some evidence of reduced overdose mortality, though the effect on overdoses is complicated by the transition to illicit fentanyl.

| Study Finding | Effect Size | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Reduction in opioid prescribing rate (mandatory PDMPs) | 8-12% reduction | Wen et al., *Health Affairs*, 2017 |
| Reduction in doctor shopping (multiple provider episodes) | 50-80% reduction | Buchmueller & Carey, *AEJ: Economic Policy*, 2018 |
| Reduction in opioid-related overdose deaths (mandatory PDMPs) | 5-10% reduction | Pardo, *Journal of Policy Analysis & Management*, 2017 |
| Increase in heroin overdose deaths (in some states post-PDMP) | Observed in early studies | Mallatt, *Journal of Health Economics*, 2020 |

## Drug Pricing and Costs

### Manufacturer Pricing

The United States has no comprehensive federal system for regulating or negotiating prescription drug prices outside of Medicare Part D (effective 2026 for the first 10 drugs). Brand-name drug prices in the U.S. are on average 2.78 times higher than in other OECD countries, and the gap has widened over the past two decades.

| Metric | Value | Trend | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Total retail prescription drug spending (2023) | $405 billion | Increasing (+8.4% from 2022) | CMS NHE Data, 2024 |
| Specialty drug share of total spending | 53% | Increasing (from 32% in 2014) | IQVIA, 2024 |
| Average annual cost of a brand-name drug (2023) | $7,481 | Increasing (+4.9% year-over-year) | AARP Rx Price Watch, 2024 |
| Average annual cost of a generic drug (2023) | $403 | Stable/declining | AARP Rx Price Watch, 2024 |
| U.S. brand-name prices vs. OECD average | 2.78x higher | Gap widening | RAND Corporation, 2024 |
| Patients reporting difficulty affording Rx drugs | 29% of adults | Stable | KFF Health Tracking Poll, 2024 |
| Adults who report not filling a prescription due to cost | 21% | Stable | KFF, 2024 |
| Medicare Part D spending (FY2023) | $145 billion | Increasing | CMS, 2024 |

### Inflation Reduction Act Impact

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) introduced the most significant federal prescription drug pricing reform in decades, though its scope remains limited.

| IRA Provision | Status (2024) | Impact | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Medicare Part D $2,000 annual out-of-pocket cap | Effective January 2025 | Estimated 18.7 million beneficiaries benefit | CMS, 2024 |
| Medicare drug price negotiation (first 10 drugs) | Prices announced August 2024, effective 2026 | Estimated $6 billion savings in first year | CBO, 2024 |
| Inflation penalty rebates (Part B and D) | Active since 2023 | 64 drugs triggered rebates in first year | CMS, 2024 |
| Free vaccines for Part D beneficiaries | Effective since 2023 | ~4 million beneficiaries saved on vaccines | CMS, 2024 |

## Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs)

### Market Concentration

The PBM industry has undergone dramatic consolidation. Three vertically integrated firms now dominate the market, each owned by a major health insurer or pharmacy chain.

| PBM | Parent Company | Market Share (est.) | Lives Covered | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CVS Caremark | CVS Health (also owns Aetna) | ~33% | ~110 million | Drug Channels Institute, 2024 |
| Express Scripts | Cigna Group | ~24% | ~85 million | Drug Channels Institute, 2024 |
| OptumRx | UnitedHealth Group | ~23% | ~82 million | Drug Channels Institute, 2024 |
| Combined top 3 | -- | ~80% | ~277 million | Drug Channels Institute, 2024 |

### PBM Business Practices Under Scrutiny

| Practice | Description | Impact | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Spread pricing | PBMs charge insurers more than they reimburse pharmacies, pocketing the difference | Increases costs for plans and patients; harms independent pharmacies | FTC Interim Report, 2024 |
| Rebate retention | PBMs negotiate manufacturer rebates but may retain a portion rather than passing full value to plans | Inflates list prices; distorts formulary decisions | FTC Interim Report, 2024 |
| Clawbacks | PBMs charge pharmacies post-transaction fees (DIR fees) that reduce effective reimbursement | Estimated $10.7 billion in DIR fees in 2022 (Medicare Part D) | MedPAC, 2024 |
| Specialty pharmacy steering | PBMs direct prescriptions to their own specialty pharmacies | Limits patient choice; potential conflict of interest | NCPA Survey, 2024 |
| Formulary exclusions | PBMs exclude drugs from coverage to extract larger rebates | May not reflect clinical value; limits physician choice | Managed Care Magazine, 2024 |

### FTC Investigation

In July 2024, the Federal Trade Commission issued an interim staff report concluding that the three largest PBMs engage in practices that may inflate drug costs and squeeze independent pharmacies. The FTC found that PBM revenue from vertically integrated pharmacy operations grew by 4.7x between 2014 and 2023, while independent pharmacy closures accelerated.

## Generic Drug Access

### Market Overview

Generic drugs account for 91% of all prescriptions filled in the United States but only approximately 18% of total drug spending -- demonstrating their critical role in cost containment and the outsized impact of brand-name pricing on overall expenditures.

| Metric | Value | Trend | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Generic drug dispensing rate (2023) | 91% | Stable (from 84% in 2014) | IQVIA, 2024 |
| Generic share of total drug spending | ~18% | Declining (as specialty grows) | IQVIA, 2024 |
| Average generic savings vs. brand | 80-85% price reduction | Stable | FDA, 2024 |
| FDA generic drug applications pending (FY2024) | ~2,600 ANDAs | Declining backlog (from ~4,000 in 2017) | FDA OGD, 2024 |
| Median ANDA approval time (FY2024) | ~28 months | Improving (from ~48 months in 2017) | FDA OGD, 2024 |
| Drugs with no generic competition despite expired patents | >100 | Persistent problem | FDA Orange Book, 2024 |

### Barriers to Generic Competition

| Barrier | Mechanism | Estimated Annual Cost | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pay-for-delay (reverse payment) settlements | Brand pays generic to delay market entry | $3.5 billion (declining since *Actavis*) | FTC, 2023 |
| Patent thickets | Multiple secondary patents extending exclusivity | Not quantified; affects major products | I-MAK, 2024 |
| Product hopping | Reformulating to new dosage form before patent expiration | Estimated billions across affected products | FTC, 2023 |
| Citizen petition abuse | Filing FDA petitions to delay generic approval | Average 150 days delay per petition | FDA, 2023 |
| REMS abuse | Using safety protocols to deny generic manufacturers access to samples | At least 100 drugs affected | FDA, 2024 |
| Authorized generics | Brand launches own generic to reduce competitor profitability | Reduces incentive for first generic filer | Berndt et al., 2007 |

## Controlled Substance Oversight

### DEA Registration and Quotas

The Drug Enforcement Administration maintains the registration system for prescribers and dispensers of controlled substances and sets aggregate production quotas.

| Metric | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Active DEA registrations (2024) | ~1.87 million | DEA ARCOS, 2024 |
| Opioid production quota reductions (2017-2024) | Reduced >65% from 2017 levels | DEA, 2024 |
| DEA quota for oxycodone (2024 vs. 2017) | 40.7 billion mg vs. 131.2 billion mg | DEA Final Quota, 2024 |
| Suspicious Order Monitoring System reports (2023) | >58,000 orders flagged | DEA, 2024 |
| DEA registrations revoked or surrendered (FY2023) | 268 | DEA, 2024 |

### Doctor Shopping and Diversion

Doctor shopping -- obtaining controlled substances from multiple prescribers without disclosure -- has declined substantially since the expansion of PDMPs but has not been eliminated. A 2023 analysis found that multiple-provider episodes for opioids declined by approximately 75% between 2012 and 2022 in states with mandatory PDMP checks, but patterns of diversion have shifted toward theft, forgery, and illicit online pharmacies.

## Emerging Challenges

### GLP-1 Receptor Agonist Pricing and Access

Semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro, Zepbound) have emerged as transformative medications for diabetes and obesity, but their pricing ($800-$1,500/month) and explosive demand growth raise fundamental questions about pharmaceutical access and sustainability. Total GLP-1 spending exceeded $40 billion in 2023, with projections reaching $100 billion annually by 2030.

### Compounding Pharmacy Concerns

The proliferation of compounding pharmacies producing custom formulations -- including compounded GLP-1 agonists -- has raised safety and regulatory oversight concerns. The FDA has increased enforcement actions against compounders producing copies of commercially available drugs.

### Artificial Intelligence in Prescribing

AI-driven clinical decision support tools are increasingly integrated into electronic health records, offering potential to reduce overprescribing but also raising concerns about algorithmic bias, liability, and the appropriate role of technology in clinical judgment.

### Cybersecurity Threats to Pharmacy Systems

The February 2024 ransomware attack on Change Healthcare disrupted pharmacy operations across the United States for weeks, highlighting the vulnerability of centralized digital infrastructure in the prescription drug supply chain.
