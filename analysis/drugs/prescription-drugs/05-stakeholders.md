# Prescription Drug Policy: Stakeholders

The prescription drug system is shaped by the interactions of several key groups, each with its own interests, resources, and influence over the regulatory and market structures that determine how drugs are approved, priced, prescribed, and monitored.

## Who Is Affected

### Primary Stakeholders

| Group | Impact | Size | Key Interests |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|
| Patients/Consumers | Bear the cost of high drug prices, face access barriers, risk of overprescribing or underprescribing | ~66% of U.S. adults take at least one prescription drug (~175 million) | Affordable access, safe prescribing, accurate information |
| Chronic pain patients | Subject to prescribing restrictions following opioid crisis; risk of undertreatment | ~50 million adults with chronic pain (CDC, 2023) | Adequate pain management, prescriber access, reduced stigma |
| People with substance use disorders | Affected by controlled substance monitoring, treatment access, criminal penalties | ~48.7 million with SUD (SAMHSA, 2024) | Treatment access, reduced stigma, rational monitoring that does not deter care |
| Uninsured/underinsured individuals | Pay highest out-of-pocket prices; limited access to manufacturer programs | ~27 million uninsured (Census, 2023); millions more underinsured | Affordable drug prices, generic availability, patient assistance |
| Medicare beneficiaries | Largest prescription drug consumer group; affected by Part D design, IRA reforms | ~67 million (CMS, 2024) | Lower out-of-pocket costs, expanded negotiation, formulary coverage |
| Prescribers (physicians, NPs, PAs) | Subject to monitoring, prescribing mandates, continuing education requirements | ~1.87 million DEA registrants | Clinical autonomy, adequate tools, reduced administrative burden |

### Secondary Stakeholders

- **Independent pharmacies**: Face below-cost PBM reimbursement, DIR fee clawbacks, and competition from PBM-owned mail-order and specialty pharmacies. Approximately 19,400 independent pharmacies operate in the U.S. (NCPA, 2024), down from 23,100 in 2016.
- **Employers purchasing health insurance**: Bear rising prescription drug costs as plan sponsors; limited transparency into PBM practices. Employer-sponsored insurance covers approximately 155 million Americans.
- **State Medicaid programs**: Cover prescription drugs for low-income populations; must manage formularies, rebate programs, and fraud prevention. Medicaid spent approximately $74 billion on prescription drugs in FY2023 (CMS, 2024).
- **Taxpayers**: Fund Medicare, Medicaid, VA, and other federal/state prescription drug spending. Federal prescription drug spending exceeded $200 billion in FY2023.

## Who Has Power

### Decision Makers

| Actor | Role | Authority | Resources | Influence Level |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| U.S. Congress | Sets drug regulation law, FDA/DEA authority, Medicare/Medicaid rules | Legislative authority over drug pricing, monitoring, scheduling | Appropriations, oversight hearings | High |
| FDA | Approves drugs, oversees safety, regulates marketing | Pre-market approval, post-market surveillance, labeling requirements | ~$6.9 billion budget (FY2024); ~18,000 FTEs | High |
| DEA | Controls scheduling, production quotas, prescriber registration | Registration authority, quota-setting, enforcement actions | ~$3.4 billion budget (FY2024); ~10,000 employees | High |
| CMS | Administers Medicare and Medicaid drug benefits | Part D oversight, IRA drug negotiation, Medicaid rebate program | Administers >$200 billion in annual drug spending | High |
| FTC | Investigates anti-competitive practices, PBM conduct | Antitrust enforcement, unfair practices authority | ~$450 million budget (FY2024) | Medium |
| State medical boards | License and discipline prescribers | Can revoke, suspend, or restrict medical licenses | 70 boards across 50 states + D.C. | Medium |
| State pharmacy boards | Regulate pharmacies and dispensing | Licensing, inspection, disciplinary authority | Varies widely by state | Medium |

### Key Organizations and Institutions

- **Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA)**: The principal lobbying organization for brand-name drug manufacturers. Spent $29.2 million on lobbying in 2023 (OpenSecrets) and coordinates industry-wide advocacy against price regulation, importation, and patent reform. Members include Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, AbbVie, and other major companies.
- **National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP)**: Operates the PMPInterConnect system for interstate PDMP data sharing and establishes standards for pharmacy practice. NABP accredits internet pharmacies through its VIPPS program.
- **Pharmacy Benefit Managers (CVS Caremark, Express Scripts, OptumRx)**: Control formulary design, rebate negotiation, and pharmacy reimbursement for approximately 80% of the insured population. Their combined revenue exceeds $400 billion annually, and their market leverage gives them extraordinary power over which drugs are covered, at what cost, and through which pharmacies.
- **American Medical Association (AMA)**: Represents approximately 271,000 physician members. The AMA has advocated for PDMP improvements, prescriber education, and reduced administrative burdens but has also defended physician prescribing autonomy against regulatory mandates.
- **National Community Pharmacists Association (NCPA)**: Represents approximately 19,400 independent pharmacies. NCPA has been the most vocal critic of PBM practices, advocating for transparency mandates, fair reimbursement, and prohibitions on specialty pharmacy steering.

### Influencers

- **Patient advocacy organizations**: Groups such as the National Pain Advocacy Center, Patients for Affordable Drugs, and the American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network influence public discourse and lobby for patient-centered reforms. Patients for Affordable Drugs has become particularly effective, raising more than $50 million since 2017 to campaign for drug pricing reform.
- **Academic medical institutions**: Research institutions shape prescribing guidelines and evidence-based practice through clinical research. The CDC, AHRQ, and NIH fund studies that inform prescribing standards and PDMP evaluation.
- **Insurance industry**: Health insurers (UnitedHealthcare, Anthem/Elevance, Cigna, Aetna/CVS) negotiate drug coverage through their PBM subsidiaries and lobby on payment and coverage rules. Many major insurers are vertically integrated with PBMs.
- **Generic and biosimilar manufacturers**: Companies such as Teva, Viatris, Sandoz, and Amneal advocate for policies that reduce barriers to generic entry and compete against brand-name patent extension strategies.
- **Investigative journalists and researchers**: Reporting by outlets including *STAT News*, *The Washington Post*, *ProPublica*, and academic researchers has driven public awareness of pharmaceutical industry practices, PBM opacity, and regulatory failures.

## Stakeholder Interests and Alignment

### Aligned Interests (Potential Coalition Partners)

| Coalition | Shared Interest | Strength |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| Independent pharmacies + patients + employers | PBM transparency and fair pricing | Strong -- clear economic alignment |
| Generic manufacturers + patients + payers | Faster generic entry, reduced patent gaming | Strong -- broad cost reduction benefit |
| Pain patients + physicians | Balanced prescribing guidelines that do not restrict legitimate treatment | Moderate -- complicated by SUD concerns |
| State regulators + DEA + public health advocates | Improved PDMP interoperability and monitoring | Strong -- shared public safety mission |
| Consumer groups + employers + state AGs | Pharmaceutical price transparency and accountability | Strong -- bipartisan support base |
| Addiction treatment providers + public health advocates + law enforcement (progressive) | Treatment access expansion, harm reduction | Moderate -- law enforcement alignment varies |

### Conflicting Interests

- **Patients needing affordable drugs** vs. **Brand-name manufacturers** seeking maximum revenue: This is the fundamental tension in drug pricing policy. Manufacturers argue that high prices fund innovation; patients argue that innovation is meaningless if they cannot afford the drugs.
- **Pain patients** vs. **Addiction prevention advocates**: Restrictions on opioid prescribing protect public health but can harm patients with legitimate pain needs. The two communities have sometimes been pitted against each other rather than working toward balanced solutions.
- **Independent pharmacies** vs. **PBMs/chain pharmacies**: PBM-owned pharmacies benefit from preferential reimbursement and patient steering that directly harm independent competitors. This conflict is intensifying as independent pharmacies close and pharmacy deserts expand in rural and underserved areas.
- **FDA** vs. **generic manufacturers**: The FDA's mission to ensure drug safety requires rigorous review processes that generic manufacturers argue create unnecessary delays. Industry critics argue that the FDA's brand-name user fee revenue creates a bias against generic prioritization.

### The Pharmaceutical-PBM Iron Triangle

The relationship among brand-name pharmaceutical manufacturers, PBMs, and insurers creates a self-reinforcing system that resists price reduction:

1. **Manufacturers** set high list prices to generate large rebates that PBMs demand
2. **PBMs** prefer high-list-price drugs with large rebates because their compensation is tied to rebate volumes
3. **Insurers** accept this structure because they receive a share of rebates, offsetting premium costs
4. **Patients** bear the cost through high copays and coinsurance calculated on list prices

This iron triangle means that all three parties benefit from the existing high-price, high-rebate system, even though patients and the healthcare system as a whole would benefit from lower list prices with smaller rebates.

## Influence Mechanisms

How stakeholders exert influence on prescription drug policy:

- **Lobbying**: The pharmaceutical and health products industry spent $374 million on federal lobbying in 2023 (OpenSecrets), more than any other industry. The top spenders include PhRMA ($29.2 million), Pfizer ($13.0 million), and the Biotechnology Innovation Organization ($9.8 million). PBMs and pharmacy chains also lobby extensively -- CVS Health spent $10.6 million in 2023.
- **Campaign Contributions**: Pharmaceutical/health products PACs and individuals contributed approximately $75 million to federal candidates and party committees in the 2023-2024 election cycle, with spending roughly evenly split between parties (OpenSecrets, 2024).
- **Revolving Door**: Former FDA and DEA officials frequently move to pharmaceutical industry positions, and industry executives move into regulatory roles. A 2019 *Science* analysis (Piller) found that 11 of the FDA's 16 most recent commissioners went on to work for pharmaceutical companies or serve on their boards after leaving the agency.
- **Public Advocacy**: Patient advocacy groups, many of which receive pharmaceutical industry funding, advocate for policies that may align with industry interests. A 2020 *JAMA Internal Medicine* study (McCoy et al.) found that 83% of large patient advocacy organizations received industry funding, and funded organizations were less likely to support drug pricing reform.
- **Expertise/Information**: The pharmaceutical industry funds the vast majority of clinical trials, controls access to proprietary data, and employs the largest concentration of pharmacology expertise outside of academia. This information asymmetry gives industry outsized influence over clinical guidelines, formulary decisions, and regulatory standards.
