# Drug Policy: Solutions

## Overview

Effective drug policy reform requires a comprehensive approach that addresses the failures identified in the preceding chapters: the criminalization framework, the treatment gap, the scheduling system's scientific deficits, racial disparities in enforcement, pharmaceutical industry accountability, and the inadequacy of supply-side approaches in the fentanyl era. This chapter presents eight specific, evidence-based solutions, each with supporting evidence, implementation approach, expected outcomes, and political feasibility.

---

## Solution 1: Comprehensive Drug Scheduling Reform

### The Problem

The Controlled Substances Act scheduling system is scientifically indefensible. Cannabis, psilocybin, and MDMA are classified in Schedule I ("no accepted medical use") despite substantial evidence of therapeutic benefit, while fentanyl (Schedule II) and cocaine (Schedule II) are classified as less dangerous. The DEA controls scheduling decisions, creating a conflict of interest where a law enforcement agency makes scientific determinations. Schedule I classification imposes severe research barriers that prevent the generation of evidence needed for reclassification.

### The Solution

- **Transfer scheduling authority** from the DEA to an independent scientific body (modeled on the National Academy of Sciences) with expertise in pharmacology, medicine, and public health.
- **Establish evidence-based scheduling criteria** that reflect actual harm (addiction potential, lethality, social harm) rather than political considerations. Use frameworks like the Nutt classification (developed by former UK drug adviser David Nutt) that rank substances by evidence-based harm metrics.
- **Reschedule cannabis** from Schedule I to Schedule III or remove it from the CSA entirely.
- **Create a Schedule I research exemption** that allows qualified researchers to study any controlled substance without the current multi-year DEA registration process.
- **Establish a regular review cycle** (every 5 years) for all scheduled substances, with mandatory consideration of new evidence.

### Evidence

- David Nutt's 2010 study in *The Lancet*, using a multicriteria analysis of drug harms, found that alcohol was the most harmful drug overall, followed by heroin and crack cocaine. Cannabis, LSD, and MDMA ranked among the least harmful. The current scheduling system does not reflect this evidence.
- The National Academy of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2017) concluded that there is substantial evidence for the therapeutic use of cannabis for chronic pain, chemotherapy-induced nausea, and spasticity from multiple sclerosis -- contradicting its Schedule I classification.
- FDA Breakthrough Therapy designation has been granted for psilocybin (depression) and MDMA (PTSD), indicating the FDA's own assessment of significant therapeutic potential.

### Expected Outcomes

- Removal of research barriers for Schedule I substances, accelerating scientific understanding of drug harms and benefits.
- Alignment of federal scheduling with scientific evidence, restoring credibility to the regulatory system.
- Resolution of the federal-state cannabis conflict.

### Political Feasibility

**Moderate**. Cannabis rescheduling has bipartisan support. Transferring scheduling authority from the DEA faces strong institutional resistance. Comprehensive scheduling reform is achievable but will require sustained political effort.

## Solution 2: Harm Reduction Expansion

### The Problem

Over 107,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2023, the majority from fentanyl. The U.S. has only two supervised consumption sites (both in New York City), compared to over 200 worldwide. Syringe service programs reach only 20-30% of people who inject drugs. Fentanyl test strips remain illegal drug paraphernalia in approximately 15 states. Naloxone costs $45 per kit retail despite over-the-counter approval.

### The Solution

- **Federal funding for overdose prevention centers (OPCs)**: Authorize and fund supervised consumption sites in jurisdictions that request them. OPCs in Canada, Australia, and Europe have operated for decades without a single overdose death on-site.
- **Universal naloxone access**: Provide naloxone free of charge through community distribution programs, pharmacies, and harm reduction organizations. The federal government should purchase naloxone at bulk prices and distribute through SAMHSA grants.
- **Legalize fentanyl test strips nationally**: Remove test strips from drug paraphernalia statutes in all states. Fund free distribution through harm reduction programs and pharmacies.
- **Expand syringe service programs (SSPs)**: Increase federal funding to achieve coverage of at least 60% of people who inject drugs. Remove the ban on using federal funds to purchase syringes (partially lifted in 2016 but still restrictive).
- **Implement drug checking services**: Fund laboratory-grade drug checking services that can identify fentanyl, xylazine, and other adulterants in the illicit drug supply.
- **Safe supply pilot programs**: Following Canadian models, pilot programs that provide pharmaceutical-grade alternatives to illicit drugs for people at high risk of overdose, reducing exposure to contaminated supply.

### Evidence

- A systematic review in *The Lancet* (2017) found that supervised consumption sites reduced overdose deaths by 26-89% in surrounding areas, reduced emergency department visits, and increased treatment uptake, with no increase in crime or drug use.
- CDC data show that syringe service programs reduce HIV and hepatitis C transmission by over 50% and serve as effective entry points to treatment. For every dollar invested in SSPs, an estimated $7.58 is saved in HIV treatment costs.
- Naloxone distribution programs have reversed an estimated 100,000+ overdoses annually.
- Fentanyl test strips, when available, reduce overdose risk. A Johns Hopkins study found that 70% of people who received a positive test result changed their drug use behavior (used less, used more slowly, or did not use at all).

### Expected Outcomes

- Reduction of overdose deaths by 30-50% in communities with comprehensive harm reduction services.
- Reduced transmission of HIV, hepatitis C, and other blood-borne infections.
- Increased engagement with treatment and social services through harm reduction entry points.

### Political Feasibility

**Mixed**. Naloxone expansion and fentanyl test strips have bipartisan support. Syringe services have growing support but face opposition in conservative states. Supervised consumption sites face majority public opposition (38% support) and strong law enforcement resistance. Federal authorization is politically challenging but achievable through executive action or appropriations riders.

## Solution 3: Treatment System Transformation

### The Problem

Only 24% of the 48.7 million Americans with substance use disorders receive any treatment. Only 42% of treatment facilities offer buprenorphine, and only 12% offer methadone. Wait times for publicly funded treatment average 25-30 days. The treatment workforce is severely understaffed. Many facilities use non-evidence-based approaches.

### The Solution

- **Treatment on demand**: Establish a federal standard that anyone seeking SUD treatment can access at least a clinical assessment and initial treatment within 24-48 hours. Fund emergency treatment capacity through SAMHSA grants.
- **Methadone modernization**: Reform the opioid treatment program (OTP) regulations to allow methadone dispensing through pharmacies and physician offices, as is standard in virtually every other developed country. Eliminate daily observed dosing requirements for stable patients. The Biden administration took initial steps in this direction; full regulatory reform is needed.
- **Mandatory MAT availability**: Require all treatment facilities receiving federal funding to offer or refer for medication-assisted treatment (buprenorphine, methadone, naltrexone). Facilities that refuse to offer MAT should not be eligible for federal dollars.
- **Treatment workforce investment**: Create a National Addiction Medicine Corps (modeled on the National Health Service Corps) that offers student loan forgiveness for clinicians who practice addiction medicine in underserved areas. Expand residency positions and training programs for addiction medicine.
- **Telehealth permanence**: Make permanent the COVID-era authorities allowing telehealth prescribing and management of buprenorphine and other addiction medications.
- **Insurance parity enforcement**: Strengthen enforcement of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act. Require annual compliance audits of all health plans. Establish private right of action for parity violations.

### Evidence

- Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) reduces opioid overdose deaths by 50-75%, according to multiple meta-analyses. MAT also reduces criminal behavior, HIV risk, and healthcare costs while improving employment and social functioning.
- A RAND Corporation study estimated that every additional dollar spent on SUD treatment saves $4-$7 in reduced drug-related costs (healthcare, criminal justice, lost productivity).
- International evidence: Australia and European countries that dispense methadone through pharmacies achieve higher treatment retention and lower overdose death rates than the U.S. clinic-based model.

### Expected Outcomes

- Increase treatment access from 24% to 50%+ within five years.
- Reduce overdose deaths by 30-50% through expanded MAT access.
- Reduce healthcare costs associated with untreated addiction by $50-100 billion annually.

### Political Feasibility

**High**. Treatment expansion has strong bipartisan support. Methadone reform faces regulatory resistance but not significant political opposition. Insurance parity enforcement is broadly supported. Workforce investment programs have bipartisan congressional champions.

## Solution 4: Sentencing Reform and Decriminalization

### The Problem

Approximately 1.5 million Americans are arrested for drug offenses annually, 80% for simple possession. Mandatory minimum sentences result in average federal drug sentences of 74 months. Racial disparities are stark: Black Americans are incarcerated for drugs at 5.9 times the rate of white Americans. Drug convictions create lasting collateral consequences that impede recovery and perpetuate poverty.

### The Solution

- **Federal decriminalization of personal possession**: Eliminate criminal penalties for possession of personal-use quantities of all drugs, replacing them with civil citations and mandatory referral to assessment and treatment services (following the Portuguese model, but with stronger treatment infrastructure).
- **Eliminate remaining mandatory minimum sentences** for drug offenses. Restore judicial discretion in sentencing. Apply reforms retroactively to allow resentencing of current prisoners.
- **Complete the Fair Sentencing Act**: Eliminate the remaining 18:1 crack/powder cocaine sentencing disparity, achieving 1:1 parity. Apply retroactively.
- **Automatic expungement**: Establish automatic federal expungement of cannabis possession convictions. Create a streamlined process for expungement of other drug possession convictions.
- **Remove collateral consequences**: Eliminate the TANF/SNAP drug felony ban. Prohibit employment and housing discrimination based on drug convictions. Restore voting rights for all people convicted of drug offenses.

### Evidence

- Portugal decriminalized personal possession of all drugs in 2001 and invested heavily in treatment. The results over two decades include: drug-related HIV infections dropped 95%, overdose deaths declined, and drug use rates remained stable or decreased -- all while prison populations fell. Portugal's drug-related death rate is 0.4 per 100,000, compared to 32.4 in the United States.
- The U.S. Sentencing Commission found that mandatory minimum sentences do not deter drug trafficking more effectively than sentences within guideline ranges. They lead to longer sentences for lower-level offenders while having minimal impact on high-level traffickers who cooperate for sentence reductions.
- The First Step Act (2018) demonstrated bipartisan willingness to reform federal drug sentencing, releasing approximately 4,000 people with broad public support.

### Expected Outcomes

- Elimination of hundreds of thousands of drug possession arrests annually.
- Reduction of the federal and state prison population by approximately 150,000-200,000 over five years.
- Elimination of racial disparities in drug arrest and incarceration rates.
- Reduction in recidivism through removal of collateral consequences.
- Savings of approximately $10-15 billion annually in incarceration costs.

### Political Feasibility

**Moderate to challenging**. Full decriminalization faces majority public opposition (43% support). Sentencing reform has stronger bipartisan support. Cannabis expungement is broadly popular. Eliminating mandatory minimums will face law enforcement and prosecutorial opposition. The Oregon experience has set back decriminalization momentum, though implementation failures rather than the concept itself are the primary lesson.

## Solution 5: Federal Cannabis Legalization Framework

### The Problem

Cannabis is legal for recreational use in 24 states and D.C. but remains a Schedule I controlled substance under federal law. This creates banking crises (no FDIC access), tax penalties (Section 280E), research barriers, interstate commerce prohibition, and constant legal uncertainty. The $33.6 billion legal industry operates in a legal gray zone.

### The Solution

- **Remove cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act** entirely (descheduling, not merely rescheduling to Schedule III).
- **Establish a federal regulatory framework** modeled on alcohol/tobacco regulation:
    - Federal agency oversight (FDA for safety standards, TTB-equivalent for market regulation)
    - Minimum age of 21 for purchase
    - DUI standards based on impairment testing (not THC blood levels, which do not reliably correlate with impairment)
    - Marketing restrictions (no advertising to minors, health warnings)
    - Product safety standards (testing for contaminants, potency labeling)
- **Resolve the banking crisis**: Allow cannabis businesses access to FDIC-insured banking, credit card processing, and standard financial services.
- **Tax reform**: Establish a federal excise tax comparable to alcohol taxation. Eliminate Section 280E tax penalties.
- **Social equity provisions**:
    - Automatic expungement of federal cannabis convictions
    - Equity licenses and funding for communities disproportionately harmed by cannabis prohibition
    - Community reinvestment fund (5% of federal cannabis tax revenue directed to communities with the highest rates of cannabis enforcement)
    - Small business support programs to prevent corporate consolidation

### Evidence

- Legal cannabis states have generated over $15 billion in cumulative tax revenue without increases in youth use, according to state data compiled by the Tax Foundation.
- Canada legalized cannabis federally in 2018. Youth use rates have not increased, impaired driving incidents have not significantly increased, and the illicit market has contracted (though not eliminated).
- Banking access for cannabis businesses would reduce the public safety risks associated with all-cash operations (armed robberies of dispensaries, which have increased in legal states).

### Expected Outcomes

- Resolution of the federal-state cannabis policy conflict.
- $5-10 billion in annual federal tax revenue at full implementation.
- Banking access for 20,000+ cannabis businesses, reducing crime associated with cash operations.
- Automatic expungement of tens of thousands of federal cannabis convictions.
- Social equity investment in communities harmed by cannabis prohibition.

### Political Feasibility

**High**. Cannabis legalization has 70% public support and growing bipartisan congressional support. The SAFE Banking Act has passed the House multiple times. Full legalization faces more resistance in the Senate but is increasingly likely within 5-10 years.

## Solution 6: Pharmaceutical Industry Accountability and Reform

### The Problem

The pharmaceutical industry created the opioid epidemic through aggressive marketing and regulatory capture. Settlements exceeding $50 billion are being disbursed, but governance of settlement funds is weak, corporate executives faced minimal criminal accountability, and the regulatory failures that enabled the crisis have not been fully addressed. The pharmaceutical industry remains the most powerful lobbying force in Washington.

### The Solution

- **Criminal accountability**: Establish a federal pharmaceutical fraud unit with authority to pursue criminal prosecution of corporate executives (not just corporate entities) who knowingly market dangerous drugs through deceptive practices. Apply RICO (Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act) provisions to pharmaceutical fraud.
- **Settlement fund governance**: Establish federal standards for opioid settlement fund allocation. Require that at least 80% of settlement funds be spent on addiction treatment, prevention, and harm reduction (following the tobacco settlement model's lessons about diversion to general budgets).
- **FDA reform**: Require post-market surveillance and real-world evidence review for all opioid and addiction-potential medications. Eliminate industry funding of FDA drug approval activities (currently, industry user fees fund a majority of FDA drug review costs, creating a structural conflict of interest). Establish a mandatory cooling-off period (5 years) before FDA officials can work for regulated industries.
- **Marketing reform**: Ban direct-to-consumer advertising of controlled substances. Require disclosure of all pharmaceutical company payments to physicians (strengthening the Sunshine Act). Prohibit the use of "key opinion leaders" who receive pharmaceutical industry payments as medical education faculty without disclosure.
- **Drug pricing for addiction medications**: Use the Medicare negotiation authority established by the Inflation Reduction Act to negotiate prices for addiction treatment medications. Ensure naloxone is available at no cost through federal programs.

### Evidence

- The opioid settlements demonstrate that the legal system considers pharmaceutical company conduct actionable. However, the absence of significant criminal penalties for executives suggests that existing accountability mechanisms are insufficient to deter future conduct.
- Post-tobacco-settlement analysis shows that states diverted the majority of tobacco settlement funds to non-health purposes. Establishing binding allocation requirements for opioid settlement funds is essential to avoiding the same outcome.

### Expected Outcomes

- Deterrence of future pharmaceutical industry misconduct.
- Effective allocation of $50+ billion in opioid settlement funds to addiction treatment and prevention.
- Reduced pharmaceutical industry influence over FDA decisions and medical education.
- Lower costs for addiction treatment medications.

### Political Feasibility

**High for accountability, moderate for structural reform**. Pharmaceutical accountability has near-universal public support (87%). FDA revolving door reform and marketing restrictions face strong industry lobbying opposition.

## Solution 7: Evidence-Based Prevention Investment

### The Problem

Prevention programs have historically been ineffective (D.A.R.E.) or underfunded. The federal prevention budget ($4.8 billion) is small relative to enforcement ($26.3 billion). Many communities lack access to evidence-based prevention programs, particularly in schools.

### The Solution

- **Triple the federal prevention budget** from $4.8 billion to $14.4 billion over five years.
- **Fund only evidence-based programs**: Require that all federally funded prevention programs be listed on SAMHSA's National Registry of Evidence-Based Programs and Practices (NREPP) or demonstrate comparable evidence of effectiveness.
- **Replace D.A.R.E.** with evidence-based curricula in all federally funded schools. Programs like Life Skills Training, Botvin's LifeSkills, and the Good Behavior Game have demonstrated 20-40% reductions in substance initiation.
- **Address social determinants**: Expand funding for programs that address the underlying risk factors for substance use -- poverty, adverse childhood experiences (ACEs), mental illness, lack of opportunity. These include home visiting programs, after-school programs, and community economic development.
- **Early intervention**: Fund screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) in all primary care and emergency department settings. SBIRT has been shown to reduce substance misuse by 20-30% when implemented consistently.

### Evidence

- The Washington State Institute for Public Policy found that evidence-based prevention programs return $18 in benefits for every dollar invested, primarily through reduced substance use, criminal justice costs, and healthcare costs.
- A meta-analysis of school-based prevention programs (Tobler et al., 2000) found that interactive, skills-based programs were significantly more effective than knowledge-only or affective-only approaches like D.A.R.E.

### Expected Outcomes

- 20-30% reduction in substance use initiation among youth within 10 years.
- Significant long-term reduction in SUD prevalence.
- Savings of $10+ in avoided costs for every prevention dollar invested.

### Political Feasibility

**High**. Prevention is the least controversial element of drug policy reform. Both parties support keeping children away from drugs; the debate is about which programs work, not whether prevention matters.

## Solution 8: International Drug Policy Reform

### The Problem

The United States spends approximately $6.7 billion annually on international drug control, primarily focused on supply-side interventions (crop eradication, interdiction, military/police assistance). These programs have not reduced drug availability in the U.S. and have contributed to violence and instability in producer and transit countries, particularly in Latin America.

### The Solution

- **Shift international drug budgets** from supply reduction to demand reduction and development assistance. Reduce crop eradication funding. Increase funding for alternative development, governance strengthening, and public health programs in drug-producing countries.
- **Reform U.S. positions in international drug policy bodies**: Support reform of the 1961 UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs and related treaties to accommodate decriminalization, harm reduction, and legalization. Stop using trade agreements to export punitive drug policies.
- **Target precursor chemicals**: The most effective supply-side intervention for fentanyl is controlling the precursor chemical supply. Negotiate binding agreements with China and India to regulate and monitor precursor chemical exports. Invest in chemical tracing technology.
- **Support harm reduction internationally**: Fund syringe services, naloxone distribution, and treatment programs in countries that receive U.S. drug control assistance. Stop conditioning foreign aid on drug enforcement metrics.

### Evidence

- The Brookings Institution and RAND Corporation have both concluded that supply-side international drug policy has failed to reduce drug availability in the United States. Cocaine and heroin prices have fallen in inflation-adjusted terms over four decades of crop eradication and interdiction.
- Alternative development programs (providing farmers with legal crop alternatives) have shown greater long-term success than forced eradication, which simply displaces production.

### Expected Outcomes

- More effective use of international drug policy resources.
- Reduced violence and instability in Latin America and other drug-producing regions.
- Potential reduction in fentanyl precursor supply through targeted chemical controls.
- Improved international relationships and credibility on drug policy.

### Political Feasibility

**Moderate**. International drug policy receives less public attention than domestic policy. Precursor chemical controls have bipartisan support. Reducing military/police assistance faces resistance from defense and intelligence communities.
