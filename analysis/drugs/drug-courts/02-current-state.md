# Drug Courts: Current State

## Drug Court Operations and Scale

The drug court system in the United States has grown from a single pilot program in 1989 to a nationwide network of specialized courts addressing substance use disorders within the criminal justice framework. Despite this growth, drug courts still serve only a fraction of the population that could benefit.

### Number and Types of Drug Courts

As of 2023, approximately 4,000 drug treatment courts operate in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and several tribal nations. These courts fall into several distinct categories:

| Court Type | Number Operating | Participants Served Annually | Key Features |
|---|---|---|---|
| Adult drug courts | ~1,900 | ~100,000 | Post-plea or deferred prosecution for nonviolent drug offenses |
| Juvenile drug courts | ~425 | ~12,000 | Youth-focused, family involvement, education integration |
| Family dependency treatment courts | ~350 | ~15,000 | Parents with SUD in child welfare proceedings |
| DWI/DUI courts | ~275 | ~10,000 | Repeat impaired driving offenders |
| Veterans treatment courts | ~600 | ~8,000 | Military veterans with SUD and/or co-occurring disorders |
| Tribal wellness courts | ~135 | ~3,000 | Tribal communities, culturally specific programming |
| Reentry drug courts | ~90 | ~2,000 | Individuals returning from prison with SUD |
| Co-occurring courts | ~80 | ~2,000 | SUD with serious mental illness |

### Geographic Distribution

Drug court coverage varies significantly by region and state:

| Region | Drug Courts per 100,000 Population | States with Highest Density | States with Lowest Density |
|---|---|---|---|
| South | 1.4 | Kentucky (2.3), Missouri (2.1) | Texas (0.7), Georgia (0.8) |
| Midwest | 1.6 | North Dakota (2.8), Nebraska (2.4) | Illinois (0.9), Michigan (1.0) |
| West | 1.1 | Montana (2.6), Wyoming (2.5) | California (0.5), Washington (0.8) |
| Northeast | 1.0 | Vermont (2.2), New Hampshire (2.0) | New Jersey (0.6), Massachusetts (0.7) |

*Source: National Drug Court Resource Center, 2023*

Rural areas face particular challenges. Approximately 40% of rural counties lack a drug court program, and those that exist often struggle with limited treatment provider availability, transportation barriers, and smaller participant pools that make per-capita costs higher (National Center for State Courts, 2022).

## Program Operations

### The Drug Court Process

The standard adult drug court follows a structured sequence:

1. **Screening and Referral** (1-2 weeks): Defendants are identified through prosecutor referral, defense attorney request, or judicial screening. Most courts use validated screening instruments such as the Texas Christian University Drug Screen (TCUDS) or the Simple Screening Instrument for Substance Abuse (SSI-SA).

2. **Assessment** (1-2 weeks): Accepted referrals undergo a comprehensive clinical assessment using instruments like the Addiction Severity Index (ASI) or the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) criteria to determine treatment needs and placement level.

3. **Program Entry** (plea or deferred adjudication): Participants typically enter a guilty plea that is held in abeyance or receive a deferred prosecution agreement. Charges are dismissed upon successful completion.

4. **Treatment Phases** (12-24 months, typically 3-5 phases):
    - **Phase 1 (Stabilization)**: Intensive outpatient treatment, 2-3 drug tests per week, weekly court appearances, 12-step or mutual aid participation
    - **Phase 2 (Intensive Treatment)**: Continued treatment, biweekly court appearances, community service, beginning employment or education
    - **Phase 3 (Transition)**: Step-down to less intensive treatment, monthly court appearances, stable employment or education, development of relapse prevention plan
    - **Phase 4 (Maintenance/Graduation Readiness)**: Aftercare planning, alumni mentoring, final drug testing, graduation ceremony

5. **Graduation**: Charges dismissed or reduced. Average time to graduation: 15-18 months (NADCP, 2023).

### Drug Testing Protocols

| Testing Element | Typical Standard | Best Practice Standard |
|---|---|---|
| Frequency (Phase 1) | 2x per week | 3x per week (random) |
| Frequency (later phases) | 1x per week | 2x per week, declining |
| Test type | Urine immunoassay | Urine immunoassay with confirmation (LC-MS/MS) |
| Substances tested | 5-panel minimum | 12+ panel including fentanyl, synthetic cannabinoids |
| Observed collection | Varies | Required per NADCP Best Practice Standards |
| Turnaround time | 24-72 hours | Same-day point-of-care with lab confirmation |

*Source: NADCP Best Practice Standards, Volume I, 2018*

### Graduated Sanctions and Incentives

Drug courts use a structured system of sanctions (for noncompliance) and incentives (for progress):

**Common Sanctions** (escalating):
- Verbal admonishment from judge
- Increased court appearances
- Increased drug testing
- Community service hours
- Brief jail sanctions (typically 1-5 days)
- Phase demotion
- Termination from program (return to traditional prosecution)

**Common Incentives**:
- Verbal praise from judge
- Reduced court appearances
- Phase advancement
- Gift cards or token rewards ($5-$25 value)
- Reduced community service requirements
- Certificates of achievement
- Charge dismissal at graduation

Research by the National Institute of Justice (2013) found that programs using a 4:1 ratio of incentives to sanctions had better retention and graduation rates than those relying predominantly on sanctions.

## Treatment Modalities

### Treatment Services Provided

| Treatment Type | % of Drug Courts Offering | Evidence Base |
|---|---|---|
| Individual counseling | 95% | Strong |
| Group counseling | 92% | Strong |
| Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) | 78% | Strong |
| 12-step facilitation | 85% | Moderate |
| Medication-assisted treatment (MAT) | 56% | Strong (gold standard for OUD) |
| Residential treatment | 62% (as step-up) | Strong for severe cases |
| Trauma-informed care | 48% | Growing |
| Mental health treatment (co-occurring) | 65% | Strong |
| Family therapy | 35% | Moderate |
| Employment/vocational services | 58% | Moderate |

*Source: NADCP National Survey, 2022; NPC Research, 2023*

### Medication-Assisted Treatment Access

The availability of MAT in drug courts remains a critical concern. Despite strong evidence that MAT (buprenorphine, methadone, naltrexone) is the most effective treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), many drug courts restrict or prohibit its use:

| MAT Policy | % of Drug Courts (2022) |
|---|---|
| MAT allowed without restriction | 32% |
| MAT allowed with restrictions (e.g., time limits, taper requirements) | 24% |
| MAT prohibited or strongly discouraged | 21% |
| MAT allowed for opioid use disorder only (not alcohol or other SUD) | 15% |
| No clear policy | 8% |

*Source: NADCP/NDCRC Survey, 2022*

The NADCP Best Practice Standards (updated 2018) explicitly state that drug courts "shall not prohibit or discourage" the use of FDA-approved medications for addiction treatment and that participants "shall not be required to taper or discontinue medications as a condition of graduation." However, compliance with this standard is uneven, and enforcement mechanisms are limited.

## Outcome Data

### Recidivism Reduction

The evidence for drug court effectiveness in reducing recidivism is robust:

| Study | Design | Sample Size | Recidivism Reduction | Follow-Up Period |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Multisite Adult Drug Court Evaluation (MADCE) | Quasi-experimental, 23 courts | 1,798 | 12 percentage points (40% vs. 52%) | 24 months |
| Campbell Collaboration Meta-Analysis (2012) | 92 studies | >20,000 | 8-14 percentage points | Varies (6-36 months) |
| GAO Review (2005) | 27 evaluations | >10,000 | Significant in 23 of 27 studies | 12-36 months |
| Gottfredson et al. (2007) | RCT, Baltimore | 235 | 15 percentage points (44% vs. 59%) | 36 months |
| WSIPP Meta-Analysis (2018) | 58 studies | >15,000 | 10.5 percentage points average | 24 months |

|---|---|---|---|
| Number of drug courts | ~4,000 | Stable (slight increase) | Growth has plateaued since ~2015 |
| Annual participants | ~150,000 | Stable | Limited by capacity and funding |
| Graduation rate | ~60% | Improving (+3 pts since 2018) | Best practice standards adoption helping |
| MAT availability | 56% of courts | Improving (+12 pts since 2018) | Still below NADCP standard |

| Black participant graduation gap | 8-12 pts lower than white | Stable (not improving) | Critical equity concern |

## Federal Funding Landscape

### Drug Court Discretionary Grant Program (DCDGP)

The primary federal funding mechanism for drug courts is the Drug Court Discretionary Grant Program, administered by the Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) within the Department of Justice:

| Fiscal Year | Appropriation | New Awards | Continuation Awards | Average Award |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FY2020 | $75 million | 84 | 187 | ~$275,000 |
| FY2021 | $80 million | 91 | 195 | ~$280,000 |
| FY2022 | $82 million | 88 | 192 | ~$283,000 |
| FY2023 | $83 million | 85 | 190 | ~$290,000 |
| FY2024 | $85 million | 90 (est.) | 188 (est.) | ~$300,000 |

*Source: BJA Drug Court Program, 2024; ONDCP National Drug Control Budget, FY2025*

### Other Federal Funding Sources

| Source | FY2024 Amount | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| SAMHSA Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant | $1.86 billion (total, drug courts can access) | Treatment services |
| State Opioid Response (SOR) grants | $1.5 billion (drug courts eligible) | Opioid-specific treatment, MAT |
| Veterans Treatment Court Grant Program | $28 million | Veterans treatment courts |
| Second Chance Act grants | $110 million (drug courts eligible) | Reentry programs |
| Byrne Justice Assistance Grants (JAG) | $515 million (states can direct to drug courts) | Flexible justice system funding |

## Racial and Ethnic Disparities

Drug courts exhibit persistent racial disparities across the participation pipeline:

| Stage | White Participants | Black Participants | Hispanic Participants | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Referral rate (of eligible) | 38% | 25% | 28% | Marlowe et al., 2018 |
| Acceptance rate (of referred) | 72% | 63% | 67% | Ho et al., 2018 |
| Graduation rate | 64% | 52% | 57% | NADCP National Survey, 2022 |
| Average days to graduation | 480 | 520 | 505 | NPC Research, 2021 |
| Jail sanctions received (average) | 2.1 | 3.4 | 2.8 | Marlowe & Carey, 2020 |

Research by the National Drug Court Institute (NDCI) identifies multiple contributing factors: prosecutorial screening bias, implicit bias in judicial decision-making, less access to private attorneys who can advocate for drug court placement, transportation and employment barriers that disproportionately affect minority participants, and program designs built around treatment modalities developed primarily for white populations.

## Legal Framework

### Key Laws and Regulations

| Law/Regulation | Year | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act** (42 U.S.C. 3796ii) | 1994 | First federal authorization for drug court grants |
| **21st Century Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act** | 2002 | Reauthorized and expanded drug court funding |
| **Second Chance Act** (Pub. L. 110-199) | 2008 | Authorized reentry drug courts and expanded grant eligibility |
| **Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA)** (Pub. L. 114-198) | 2016 | Expanded drug court scope to include MAT, veterans courts |
| **SUPPORT for Patients and Communities Act** (Pub. L. 115-271) | 2018 | Required drug courts to allow MAT for grant recipients |
| **NADCP Best Practice Standards** (Vols. I-II) | 2013, 2018 | National standards (voluntary but increasingly tied to funding) |

## Recent Trends

### Fentanyl's Impact on Drug Courts (2019-2024)

The fentanyl crisis has fundamentally altered drug court operations:

- **Higher-acuity participants**: Drug courts report increasing numbers of participants with opioid use disorders involving fentanyl, which has a higher relapse risk and overdose lethality than heroin or prescription opioids
- **MAT urgency**: Fentanyl's danger has accelerated the shift toward MAT acceptance, with courts that prohibit MAT facing criticism for endangering participants
- **Drug testing challenges**: Fentanyl analogs may not appear on standard immunoassay panels, requiring more expensive confirmatory testing
- **Overdose deaths during participation**: Some drug courts have reported participant overdose deaths, prompting adoption of naloxone distribution and overdose response training for staff
- **Increased demand**: The overdose crisis has generated greater referral volume, straining existing court capacity

### Technology and Innovation

- **Telehealth expansion**: COVID-19 accelerated telehealth adoption; 73% of drug courts now offer some telehealth treatment services (NADCP Survey, 2023)
- **Electronic monitoring**: GPS and smartphone-based monitoring apps supplement traditional drug testing in some jurisdictions
- **Risk-need-responsivity tools**: Increasing adoption of validated risk assessment instruments (e.g., RANT, COMPAS, LSI-R) for eligibility and treatment matching
- **Data systems**: BJA's Drug Court Management and Reporting System (DCMRS) improving outcome tracking across federally funded courts

## Emerging Challenges

- **Workforce shortages**: Substance abuse counselors, social workers, and clinical supervisors are in short supply nationally. SAMHSA reports a workforce gap of 250,000-300,000 behavioral health professionals (2023), directly limiting drug court treatment capacity.
- **Housing instability**: Approximately 20-30% of drug court participants experience housing instability during the program, a factor strongly associated with program failure (Urban Institute, 2022).
- **Sustainability after grant expiration**: Many drug courts depend on time-limited federal grants. When grants expire, courts face funding cliffs that can reduce capacity or force closure.
- **Decriminalization competition**: In jurisdictions that have decriminalized personal possession, drug courts may see reduced referral volumes, raising questions about the model's long-term relevance if drug policy moves away from criminal processing.
- **Participant complexity**: Drug court participants increasingly present with polysubstance use, co-occurring mental health disorders, trauma histories, and social determinant challenges (homelessness, unemployment) that exceed the capacity of traditional drug court programming.
