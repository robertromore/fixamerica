# Drug Courts: What You Can Do

Drug courts affect hundreds of thousands of Americans directly and millions more through their impact on public safety, treatment access, and the criminal justice system. Citizen engagement is essential for expanding access, improving quality, and ensuring equity in drug court programs.

## Individual Actions

### Learn and Stay Informed

- Subscribe to the NADCP newsletter (<https://www.nadcp.org/>) for updates on drug court policy, research, and legislative developments
- Follow the National Drug Court Resource Center (<https://ndcrc.org/>) for the latest data on drug court operations and outcomes
- Read the Campbell Collaboration meta-analysis (Mitchell et al., 2012) and the MADCE report (Rossman et al., 2011) to understand the evidence base
- Use the NDCRC Drug Court Locator to find your local drug court and learn about its eligibility criteria, treatment services, and outcomes

### Make Personal Changes

- Educate yourself about substance use disorders as a medical condition, not a moral failing. Understanding addiction science reduces stigma and supports recovery.
- If you know someone who is justice-involved and struggling with substance use, share information about drug court eligibility and local treatment resources
- Challenge misconceptions about drug courts when you encounter them -- whether the misconception is that drug courts are "soft on crime" or that they extend criminal justice control inappropriately
- Support recovery-friendly workplaces by advocating for hiring policies that do not automatically exclude individuals with drug court or treatment histories

### Use Your Voice

- **Contact Your Representatives**: Urge federal legislators to increase drug court funding, expand MAT mandates, and require racial equity reporting. State legislators control drug court authorizing statutes and state funding levels.
- **Submit Public Comments**: When the Bureau of Justice Assistance issues solicitations for drug court grants, public comments can influence funding priorities. When state legislatures consider drug court bills, written and oral testimony is influential.
- **Write Letters to the Editor**: When local media covers drug-related crime, write letters that highlight drug court effectiveness data (12 percentage point recidivism reduction, $2-$27 return on investment per $1) as an alternative to incarceration-focused responses.
- **Share Information**: Share drug court evidence and success stories on social media platforms, particularly during National Drug Court Month (May).

## Community Actions

### Organize Locally

- Attend your local drug court graduation ceremony. Most drug courts hold public graduation events that are open to community members. Showing community support matters to participants and judges.
- Form a community advocacy group to monitor your local drug court's performance. Request annual outcome data including graduation rates, recidivism rates, and demographic breakdowns.
- Partner with local treatment providers and recovery organizations to identify gaps in drug court treatment services, particularly MAT access.
- Organize a community forum on drug court policy, inviting the drug court judge, defense attorneys, treatment providers, and former participants to share perspectives.

### Build Coalitions

- Connect with local criminal justice reform organizations, treatment advocacy groups, and faith-based recovery communities to build a broad coalition supporting drug court improvement
- Engage local business communities by highlighting the economic benefits of drug courts: reduced incarceration costs, increased workforce participation, and lower crime rates
- Partner with veteran service organizations to advocate for veterans treatment court expansion in your community

## Political Actions

### Contact Elected Officials

**When to Contact**:
- During federal and state budget season (February-September), when drug court funding levels are set

**What to Say - Template Email**:

```
Subject: Support Drug Court Funding and Reform

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Last Name],

I am writing as a constituent from [City, State] to urge your support for increased funding and evidence-based reforms for drug courts.

Drug courts are among the most effective programs in the criminal justice system. The National Institute of Justice's Multisite Adult Drug Court Evaluation found that drug court participants have a 12 percentage point lower recidivism rate than defendants processed through traditional courts. Cost-benefit analyses consistently show returns of $2 to $27 for every $1 invested. Yet drug courts currently serve only about 10% of eligible defendants due to limited funding and capacity.

I urge you to:
1. Support increased federal funding for the Drug Court Discretionary Grant Program
2. Require all drug courts receiving federal funds to permit medication-assisted treatment (MAT)
3. Mandate racial equity data reporting to address documented disparities in drug court access and outcomes

Drug courts save lives, reduce crime, and save taxpayer money. They deserve your support.

Thank you for your service and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
[Your City, State]
```

**What to Say - Phone Call Script**:

```
"Hello, my name is [Name] and I'm a constituent from [City]. I'm calling about drug court funding and reform. Drug courts reduce recidivism by 12 percentage points and save $2 to $27 for every dollar invested, but they only serve about 10% of eligible defendants. I'd like the [Representative/Senator] to support increased drug court funding and require medication-assisted treatment access in all federally funded courts. Can you please note my position?"
```

### Support Legislation

Current or proposed legislation to support:

- **Drug Court Reauthorization and Improvement Act**: Reauthorizes the DCDGP with increased funding, expanded MAT requirements, and racial equity provisions -- Contact members of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees
- **Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA) reauthorization**: Continuation and expansion of federal drug court authority -- Support through congressional office contacts
- **State-level drug court expansion bills**: Many states consider drug court legislation annually -- Contact your state representative and senator during legislative sessions
- **Veterans Treatment Court Expansion Act**: Bipartisan legislation to expand veterans treatment courts to all VA-served regions -- Especially receptive to veteran and military family constituent contacts

### Electoral Engagement

**Questions to Ask Candidates**:

1. "Do you support increased federal and state funding for drug courts, which reduce recidivism by 12 percentage points and save $2-$27 per dollar invested?"
2. "Do you believe all drug courts should be required to allow medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder, which reduces overdose deaths by 50%?"
3. "What is your plan to address documented racial disparities in drug court access and outcomes?"
4. "Do you support pre-arrest diversion programs like LEAD as complements to drug courts?"

**Voting Considerations**:
- Look for candidates who support evidence-based criminal justice reform and treatment over incarceration
- Pay attention to candidates' positions on the broader opioid crisis response, as drug courts are one component of the solution
- Check whether candidates serve on the Judiciary, Appropriations, or Health committees, which have jurisdiction over drug court policy

## Professional Actions

- **For Attorneys**: If you practice criminal law, familiarize yourself with your local drug court's eligibility criteria and refer eligible clients. If your jurisdiction lacks a drug court, advocate for establishing one with the local bar association and judiciary.
- **For Healthcare Providers**: Partner with your local drug court to provide treatment services, particularly MAT. Offer to train drug court teams on addiction medicine and evidence-based treatment practices.
- **For Educators**: Include drug court policy in criminal justice, public health, and social work curricula. Encourage students to observe drug court proceedings and intern with drug court programs.
- **For Employers**: Adopt hiring policies that do not automatically exclude individuals with drug court histories. Participate in drug court job placement programs. Recovery-friendly workplaces contribute to long-term success.
- **For Researchers**: Conduct independent evaluations of local drug courts, particularly examining equity outcomes. Share results with drug court teams and policymakers. Contribute to the evidence base on what works and for whom.
- **For Social Workers and Counselors**: Seek specialized training in drug court practices through the National Drug Court Institute. Advocate for evidence-based treatment and MAT access in your practice setting.

## Advocacy Toolkit

### Key Talking Points

When discussing drug courts with others, emphasize:

1. **Drug courts reduce crime**: Participants have a 12 percentage point lower recidivism rate than defendants processed through traditional courts (MADCE, 2012). That means fewer victims and safer communities.
2. **Drug courts save money**: Every $1 invested in drug courts generates $2 to $27 in savings from reduced incarceration, healthcare, and criminal justice costs (WSIPP, 2018; NPC Research, 2019).
3. **Drug courts need reform**: Only ~10% of eligible defendants can access drug courts, 21% still prohibit life-saving medication-assisted treatment, and persistent racial disparities undermine the model's promise.
4. **Treatment works better than incarceration**: RAND Corporation research shows treatment is seven times more cost-effective than domestic law enforcement at reducing drug use.

### Common Misconceptions to Counter

| Misconception | Reality | Source |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| "Drug courts let criminals off easy" | Drug courts require 12-24 months of supervision, regular drug testing, mandatory treatment, and community service. Participants who fail are returned to traditional prosecution. | NADCP Best Practice Standards, 2018 |
| "Drug courts don't work" | The evidence base includes 150+ evaluations, a 1,798-participant multisite study, and a Campbell Collaboration meta-analysis -- all showing significant recidivism reduction | Mitchell et al., 2012; MADCE, 2012 |
| "Drug courts are just for minor offenders" | Research shows drug courts are *most effective* for high-risk/high-need participants; restricting to low-risk defendants reduces impact | Marlowe et al., 2016 |
| "Medication-assisted treatment is just trading one addiction for another" | MAT reduces overdose mortality by 50%+, is endorsed by every major medical organization, and is considered the standard of care for opioid use disorder | Larochelle et al., 2018; WHO, 2009 |
| "Drug courts serve everyone equally" | Documented disparities exist: Black defendants are referred at lower rates (25% vs. 38%), accepted at lower rates (63% vs. 72%), and graduate at lower rates (52% vs. 64%) | Marlowe et al., 2018; NADCP Survey, 2022 |
