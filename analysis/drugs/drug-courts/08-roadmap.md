# Drug Courts: Implementation Roadmap

## Strategic Approach

The implementation strategy follows a three-phase model that builds incrementally toward a transformed drug court system. Phase 1 focuses on quick wins that leverage existing infrastructure: expanding MAT access, requiring equity data reporting, and piloting pre-arrest diversion. Phase 2 builds institutional capacity through a national certification system, formula-based funding, and health system integration. Phase 3 achieves the long-term vision of universal access, eliminated racial disparities, and full integration with a broader treatment continuum. Each phase produces measurable outcomes that build political support for the next phase.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation and Quick Wins (Years 1-2)

### Objectives

- Expand MAT access mandate to all federal drug court funding streams
- Establish mandatory racial equity data reporting
- Launch pre-arrest diversion pilots in 50 additional jurisdictions
- Issue federal guidance on evidence-based eligibility expansion
- Train 2,000 drug court judges and team members on best practices

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Amend DCDGP, Byrne JAG, and SABG grant conditions to require MAT access | Congress / BJA | Months 1-6 | Legislative action; BJA rulemaking | 100% of federally funded courts permit MAT |
| Develop standardized racial equity reporting template | NDCRC / BJA | Months 1-9 | $2 million for template development, training | Template published and distributed |
| Issue DOJ guidance on expanded eligibility using risk-need-responsivity | DOJ / BJA | Months 3-6 | Internal policy development | Guidance issued to all funded courts |
| Award 50 pre-arrest diversion (LEAD-model) planning grants | BJA | Months 6-12 | $25 million in new grant funding | 50 jurisdictions funded |
| Launch national drug court training initiative (MAT, equity, RNR) | NADCP / NDCI | Months 1-24 | $10 million for training development and delivery | 2,000 professionals trained |
| Expand Drug Court Management and Reporting System (DCMRS) | BJA / NDCRC | Months 6-18 | $5 million for system upgrades | Disaggregated data collection live in 500+ courts |

### Legislative Requirements

- Amendment to BJA grant conditions (can be accomplished through appropriations rider or standalone legislation)
- Reauthorization of Drug Court Discretionary Grant Program with updated MAT and equity requirements
- New appropriations line item for pre-arrest diversion pilot grants ($25 million)

### Expected Outcomes

Phase 1 establishes the data infrastructure, MAT access baseline, and diversion alternatives that enable Phase 2 reforms. By the end of Year 2, all federally funded drug courts permit MAT, equity data is flowing from 500+ courts, and 50 jurisdictions are planning pre-arrest diversion programs. The national training initiative builds capacity for evidence-based practices.

---

## Phase 2: Institutional Capacity Building (Years 3-5)

### Objectives

- Establish national drug court certification system
- Transition from competitive to formula-based federal funding
- Require drug court-community health system integration
- Expand total drug court capacity by 25% (from ~150,000 to ~187,500 participants annually)
- Eliminate MAT restrictions in at least 90% of drug courts nationwide

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Design and pilot national certification system | NADCP / new certification body | Years 3-4 | $5 million development; $3 million annual operations | Pilot certification in 10 states (500+ courts) |
| Enact Drug Court Block Grant legislation | Congress | Year 3 | Congressional authorization; $500 million initial appropriation | Legislation enacted; formula allocations to all states |
| Require community health system integration partnerships | BJA / CMS | Years 3-5 | $50 million for partnership development grants | 75% of funded courts have formal health system partnerships |
| Expand pre-arrest diversion to 200+ jurisdictions | BJA | Years 3-5 | $100 million over 3 years | 200 jurisdictions operational; 50,000 diversions annually |
| Implement corrective action plans for courts with racial disparities | BJA / State coordinators | Years 3-5 | $15 million for technical assistance | 80% of courts with identified disparities have active corrective plans |
| Expand veterans treatment courts to all VA-served regions | VA / BJA | Years 3-5 | $50 million over 3 years | 900 veterans courts (up from ~600) |

### Legislative Requirements

- Drug Court Block Grant Act: Creates formula-based funding allocated to states based on eligible population and treatment costs
- Drug Court Quality Improvement Act: Authorizes national certification system and ties funding to certification within 5 years
- Reauthorization and expansion of the Veterans Treatment Court Improvement Act

### Expected Outcomes

By the end of Year 5, a national certification system is operational and piloted in at least 10 states. Formula-based funding provides stable resources to all states. Drug court capacity has increased by 25%, serving approximately 187,500 participants annually. Pre-arrest diversion programs operate in 200+ jurisdictions, providing a non-criminal-justice pathway to treatment. Veterans treatment courts are accessible in all VA-served regions.

## Phase 3: System Transformation (Years 6-10)

### Objectives

- Achieve drug court or equivalent diversion access for at least 50% of eligible defendants
- Tie all federal drug court funding to national certification
- Eliminate statistically significant racial disparities in drug court access and outcomes
- Fully integrate drug courts into a broader treatment continuum spanning pre-arrest diversion through community-based aftercare

### Key Actions

| Action | Lead Actor | Timeline | Resources Needed | Success Metric |
|--------|-----------|----------|------------------|----------------|
| Scale drug court capacity to serve 50% of eligible defendants (~750,000 annually) | States / BJA / SAMHSA | Years 6-10 | $2-3 billion annual federal investment | 750,000+ participants served annually |
| Mandate certification for all federally funded courts | Congress / BJA | Year 6 | Certification infrastructure at scale | 90%+ of drug courts certified |
| Implement universal pre-arrest diversion in jurisdictions with populations >100,000 | States / BJA | Years 6-10 | $250 million annually | All large jurisdictions have diversion programs |
| Integrate drug court data with state health information exchanges | CMS / ONC / State agencies | Years 6-10 | $100 million for infrastructure | Seamless data sharing between courts and health systems |
| Achieve equitable drug court outcomes across all racial/ethnic groups | Courts / BJA / State coordinators | Years 6-10 | Ongoing technical assistance and monitoring | No statistically significant disparities in graduation rates |

### Expected Outcomes

By Year 10, the drug court system has been transformed from a fragmented network of 4,000 independent courts serving 10% of the eligible population into an integrated, quality-assured system serving 50% of eligible defendants, with pre-arrest diversion providing an alternative pathway for many more. Racial disparities have been eliminated through systematic monitoring and corrective action. Drug courts function as bridges to the healthcare system rather than stand-alone programs.

## Governance and Oversight

**Federal Oversight**: The Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) serves as the primary federal coordinator, managing the DCDGP and the proposed Drug Court Block Grant. BJA works with SAMHSA on treatment quality standards and with the Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) on cross-agency coordination.

**National Certification Body**: A new or NADCP-administered body establishes and evaluates certification standards, conducting site visits, reviewing outcome data, and issuing certification decisions.

**State Drug Court Coordinators**: Each state maintains a drug court coordinating office responsible for state-level standard-setting, funding distribution, training, and quality monitoring.

**Congressional Oversight**: The Senate and House Judiciary Committees conduct biannual hearings on drug court performance, including equity outcomes, certification compliance, and cost-effectiveness data.

**Annual Public Reporting**: BJA publishes an annual "State of Drug Courts" report with national outcome data disaggregated by race, court type, geography, and certification status.

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Congressional Funding Shortfall

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Build bipartisan support through cost-savings messaging and veterans court advocacy. Develop contingency plans for phased implementation at lower funding levels. Pursue state-level dedicated revenue sources (cannabis taxes, forfeiture redirects) as supplements.

**Contingency Plan**: If federal funding remains near current levels, prioritize quality improvement (certification, MAT, equity) over scale expansion, focusing available resources on making existing courts more effective.

### Risk 2: Judicial and Prosecutorial Resistance to Expanded Eligibility

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Engage the Conference of Chief Justices and National District Attorneys Association early. Present evidence on high-need targeting effectiveness. Use pilot programs in willing jurisdictions to demonstrate safety.

**Contingency Plan**: If categorical eligibility restrictions persist, focus on expanding access within current eligibility frameworks while building the evidence base for future expansion through voluntary pilot programs.

### Risk 3: Treatment Capacity Cannot Scale with Court Expansion

**Likelihood**: High

**Impact**: High

**Mitigation Strategy**: Coordinate drug court expansion with behavioral health workforce development initiatives. Partner with FQHCs and telehealth providers to extend treatment reach. Use Medicaid reimbursement to sustain treatment capacity beyond grant funding.

**Contingency Plan**: Slow expansion timeline to match available treatment capacity. Prioritize telehealth and technology-enabled treatment delivery in underserved areas.

### Risk 4: Racial Equity Reforms Produce Backlash

**Likelihood**: Medium

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Frame equity reforms as quality improvement, not identity politics. Emphasize that equity monitoring benefits all participants by improving program design. Engage minority communities as partners in reform design.

**Contingency Plan**: If mandatory equity reporting faces political opposition, begin with voluntary reporting incentivized by bonus funding and shift to mandatory requirements as data demonstrates the need.

### Risk 5: Decriminalization Reduces Drug Court Referral Volume

**Likelihood**: Medium (depends on policy changes)

**Impact**: Medium

**Mitigation Strategy**: Position drug courts as one component within a broader treatment continuum that includes pre-arrest diversion. Adapt the drug court model for non-criminal referral pathways (e.g., civil commitment, family court, DUI court). Support the development of community-based treatment access that reduces reliance on criminal justice pathways.

**Contingency Plan**: If decriminalization significantly reduces criminal referrals, pivot drug court resources to family courts, DUI courts, veterans courts, and post-incarceration reentry courts where criminal justice processing remains active.
