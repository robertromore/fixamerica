# Drug Courts: Solutions

Drug court reform requires a multi-faceted approach that aims to expand access, improve quality, ensure equity, integrate evidence-based treatment practices, and position drug courts within a broader public health continuum that reduces reliance on criminal justice processing as the gateway to addiction treatment.

---

## Reform Framework

### Guiding Principles

- Evidence-based eligibility: Target drug court resources at the high-risk/high-need populations where research shows the greatest impact, rather than restricting to low-risk defendants for political safety
- Health-centered design: Treat drug courts as bridges to the healthcare system, not as alternatives to it, ensuring participants gain lasting connections to community treatment, primary care, and support services
- Racial equity by design: Build equity requirements into every aspect of drug court operations -- referral, screening, treatment, sanctions, and outcomes monitoring -- rather than treating disparities as an afterthought
- Medication access as a baseline: Ensure all drug courts permit and facilitate access to FDA-approved medications for addiction treatment as a minimum standard
- Graduated autonomy: Structure drug courts as a continuum from intensive supervision to community-based voluntary care, reducing the coercive footprint of the court over time

### Theory of Change

Expanding drug court access to more eligible defendants, improving treatment quality through evidence-based standards, and ensuring equitable operations will reduce recidivism, reduce incarceration costs, increase treatment engagement, and improve long-term recovery outcomes. Simultaneously, developing pre-arrest diversion alternatives will reduce reliance on criminal justice processing as the primary pathway to treatment, addressing the structural critique of the drug court model while preserving its supervisory benefits for those who need them.

## Proposed Solutions

### Solution 1: Expand Eligibility to High-Risk/High-Need Populations

**Description**: Reform drug court eligibility criteria to include individuals with moderate-to-high risk scores on validated assessment instruments, individuals with co-occurring mental health disorders, and individuals with prior violent offense histories (excluding current violent charges). This aligns drug court targeting with the evidence base showing that high-risk/high-need individuals benefit most from the model. Eligibility should be determined by clinical assessment using validated tools (e.g., RANT, LSI-R, ASAM criteria) rather than categorical offense-based exclusions.

**Evidence Base**: The MADCE (2012) found the strongest recidivism reduction effects among high-risk/high-need participants. Marlowe et al. (2016) demonstrated that restricting drug courts to low-risk defendants reduces cost-effectiveness by applying intensive intervention where it is least needed. Jurisdictions that have expanded eligibility -- including Tulsa County, OK and Hamilton County, OH -- report comparable or better outcomes without increased public safety incidents.

**Implementation**: Amend federal grant requirements (DCDGP) to incentivize high-need targeting. Develop standardized clinical screening protocols for use at booking rather than post-charge. Require drug courts receiving federal funds to use validated risk-need-responsivity instruments. Provide technical assistance for courts transitioning from offense-based to assessment-based eligibility.

**Cost/Resources**: Minimal incremental cost for eligibility expansion itself. Expanded participation will require additional treatment capacity ($3,000-$8,000 per additional participant annually, depending on acuity level). Estimated cost of expanding to serve 50% of eligible defendants: $1.5-$2.5 billion annually at full scale.

**Timeline**: 2-3 years for federal grant rule changes and court-level implementation.

**Challenges**: Prosecutor resistance to losing gatekeeping authority. Public safety concerns regarding expanded eligibility for violent-history defendants. Treatment capacity limitations in many jurisdictions.

**Impact Metrics**: Percentage of drug courts using validated risk assessment for eligibility; average risk level of accepted participants; recidivism outcomes by risk level; public safety incidents among expanded-eligibility participants.

### Solution 2: Mandate Universal Medication-Assisted Treatment Access

**Description**: Require all drug courts -- not just federally funded ones -- to permit participants to access FDA-approved medications for substance use disorders, including buprenorphine, methadone, and naltrexone. Prohibit drug courts from requiring medication taper as a condition of phase advancement or graduation. Provide funding for court-based MAT services including prescribing, dispensing, and monitoring.

**Evidence Base**: MAT reduces opioid overdose mortality by 50% or more (Larochelle et al., 2018, *Annals of Internal Medicine*). The SUPPORT Act (2018) already requires MAT access in federally funded courts, but compliance is uneven and the mandate does not cover state-funded courts. The NADCP Best Practice Standards (2018) explicitly require unrestricted MAT access. Studies show that drug court participants with access to MAT have higher retention rates and lower relapse rates than those in abstinence-only programs (Matusow et al., 2013).

**Implementation**: Federal legislation conditioning all drug court funding (including Byrne JAG, SABG, and SOR grants) on MAT access. State-level legislation or judicial rules requiring MAT access in all state-funded drug courts. Training programs for drug court judges and staff on addiction pharmacotherapy. Partnerships with federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) and opioid treatment programs (OTPs) to provide on-site or linked MAT services.

**Cost/Resources**: MAT medications cost $4,000-$6,000 per participant annually for buprenorphine, $3,000-$5,000 for methadone, and $1,000-$2,000 for naltrexone (SAMHSA, 2023). Federal and state grants can offset costs. Integration with Medicaid expansion in 40 states reduces direct court costs.

**Timeline**: 1-2 years for federal mandate expansion; 2-4 years for full compliance.

**Challenges**: Resistance from abstinence-oriented treatment providers and judges. Limited MAT prescriber availability in rural areas. Methadone dispensing restrictions (federal law limits methadone to licensed OTPs). Cultural resistance among 12-step-oriented drug court teams.

**Impact Metrics**: Percentage of drug courts offering unrestricted MAT; MAT utilization rate among drug court participants with OUD; overdose rates during and after program participation; graduation rates for MAT vs. non-MAT participants.

### Solution 3: Establish Pre-Arrest Diversion Pathways

**Description**: Create a complementary system of pre-arrest diversion programs that offer treatment access without requiring arrest, criminal charges, or court processing. Models include Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD), which allows police officers to divert individuals at the point of contact; civilian-led crisis response teams (e.g., CAHOOTS in Eugene, OR); and community-based deflection programs that connect individuals to treatment through emergency departments, homeless services, and other non-criminal justice entry points.

**Evidence Base**: The LEAD program in Seattle, WA (launched 2011) has been independently evaluated and found to reduce recidivism by 58% compared to traditional processing (Collins et al., 2017, *Journal of Substance Abuse Treatment*). LEAD participants were 60% more likely to have stable housing and 33% more likely to be employed. As of 2024, LEAD-model programs operate in over 80 jurisdictions across 30 states (LEAD National Support Bureau, 2024). The CAHOOTS program in Eugene, OR handles approximately 20% of police calls with civilian responders at a fraction of the cost of armed police response.

**Implementation**: Federal grants for LEAD-model program planning and implementation (new grant category under BJA). State legislation authorizing law enforcement diversion at the point of contact. Training programs for police officers on diversion referral. Partnerships between law enforcement, treatment providers, and community organizations.

**Cost/Resources**: LEAD programs cost approximately $800-$1,500 per participant annually for case management and service coordination (LEAD National Support Bureau, 2024). This is significantly less than drug court costs ($5,000-$11,000 per participant). Estimated federal investment for national rollout: $500 million over 5 years.

**Timeline**: 1-2 years for pilot expansion; 3-5 years for widespread adoption.

**Challenges**: Law enforcement resistance to diversion roles. Lack of treatment capacity in communities receiving diverted individuals. Sustainability after grant expiration.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of jurisdictions with pre-arrest diversion programs; individuals diverted annually; treatment engagement rates post-diversion; recidivism rates compared to arrest-based processing.

### Solution 4: Require Racial Equity Monitoring and Compliance

**Description**: Mandate that all drug courts receiving federal or state funding collect, report, and publish data on referral, acceptance, participation, sanctions, and graduation rates disaggregated by race, ethnicity, gender, and income. Courts showing statistically significant racial disparities that persist over two consecutive reporting periods must develop and implement corrective action plans subject to external review.

**Evidence Base**: Research consistently shows racial disparities at every stage of drug court participation: Black defendants are referred at lower rates (25% vs. 38% for white defendants), accepted at lower rates (63% vs. 72%), and graduate at lower rates (52% vs. 64%) (Marlowe et al., 2018; Ho et al., 2018; NADCP National Survey, 2022). Without mandatory monitoring, these disparities persist because courts lack the data or accountability mechanisms to identify and address them.

**Implementation**: Federal legislation requiring disaggregated data collection as a condition of DCDGP, Byrne JAG, and SABG funding. Development of a standardized reporting template by the NDCRC. Annual public reporting with technical assistance for courts showing disparities. State-level judicial rules requiring equity audits for all drug courts.

**Cost/Resources**: Data collection infrastructure costs approximately $15,000-$50,000 per court for system upgrades. Technical assistance and training: $10 million annually at the federal level. Corrective action plans may require additional investments in culturally responsive treatment, translation services, transportation assistance, and community outreach.

**Timeline**: 1 year for data collection mandate; 2-3 years for full implementation and first reporting cycle.

**Challenges**: Resistance from courts that view reporting as burdensome or threatening. Definitional challenges in measuring equity (controlling for legitimate clinical and legal factors). Limited research base on effective interventions for reducing drug court disparities.

**Impact Metrics**: Percentage of drug courts reporting disaggregated data; magnitude of racial/ethnic disparities in referral, acceptance, and graduation; number of courts implementing corrective action plans; trend in disparities over time.

### Solution 5: Create a National Drug Court Quality Certification System

**Description**: Establish a voluntary national certification system administered by NADCP (or a new independent body) that evaluates drug courts against the Best Practice Standards and publicly certifies those that meet evidence-based quality benchmarks. Tie federal funding to certification within 5 years. The certification system should assess: eligibility and screening practices, treatment quality, MAT access, judicial engagement, sanctions and incentives, equity monitoring, outcome tracking, and stakeholder collaboration.

**Evidence Base**: The Washington State Institute for Public Policy (WSIPP) has demonstrated that drug courts adhering to best practices produce significantly better outcomes than those that do not. States with drug court certification systems (e.g., Missouri, Kentucky) report higher graduation rates and lower recidivism than states without such systems. The medical profession uses board certification to ensure quality; a similar approach in drug courts would create accountability and transparency.

**Implementation**: Federal legislation authorizing NADCP or a new entity to develop and administer a certification system. Development of certification criteria aligned with Best Practice Standards. Pilot certification in 5-10 states. Phase-in of certification requirement for federal funding.

**Cost/Resources**: Certification system development: $5 million. Annual operating costs: $10-15 million for site visits, evaluations, and technical assistance. Per-court certification review: $10,000-$25,000 every 3 years.

**Timeline**: 2-3 years for system development; 5 years for full implementation with funding tie-in.

**Challenges**: Resistance from courts that fear failing certification. Cost and logistics of site visits for 4,000+ courts. Balancing standardization with local adaptation needs.

**Impact Metrics**: Number of certified courts; percentage of federal funding going to certified courts; outcome differences between certified and non-certified courts.

### Solution 6: Integrate Drug Courts with Community Health Systems

**Description**: Require drug courts to develop formal partnerships with community health providers -- including federally qualified health centers (FQHCs), community mental health centers, Medicaid managed care organizations, and peer recovery support services -- to ensure that participants transition to ongoing community-based care upon graduation. Drug courts should function as bridges to the healthcare system, not as the healthcare system itself.

**Evidence Base**: Research shows that drug court graduates who maintain treatment engagement after program completion have significantly better long-term outcomes (Hiller et al., 2010). However, many participants lose treatment access upon graduation because court-ordered treatment ends without a handoff to community providers. The Affordable Care Act's Medicaid expansion provides coverage for SUD treatment in 40 states, creating a reimbursement mechanism for post-graduation care that did not previously exist.

**Implementation**: Require drug courts receiving federal funds to develop written care transition protocols. Fund drug court-FQHC partnership development through HRSA grants. Integrate drug court data systems with state health information exchanges. Support peer recovery specialists as transition coordinators embedded in drug courts.

**Cost/Resources**: Care transition coordination: $1,500-$3,000 per participant. Peer recovery specialist salaries: $35,000-$45,000 annually. Infrastructure costs for data integration: $25,000-$100,000 per court.

**Timeline**: 1-2 years for partnership development; 3-5 years for system-wide integration.

**Challenges**: Fragmented healthcare and criminal justice data systems. Medicaid billing complexity. Treatment provider capacity limitations. Participant engagement after court supervision ends.

**Impact Metrics**: Percentage of graduates connected to community treatment at discharge; 12-month post-graduation treatment retention; 12-month post-graduation recidivism; emergency department utilization rates.

### Solution 7: Fund Drug Court Sustainability Through Dedicated Revenue

**Description**: Establish a dedicated federal funding stream for drug courts separate from the competitive DCDGP grants, providing formula-based funding to all jurisdictions based on eligible population size and local treatment costs. Supplement federal funding with state-level dedicated revenue sources such as drug-related fine and forfeiture revenue redirected to treatment, cannabis tax revenue in legal states, and Medicaid savings reinvestment.

**Evidence Base**: The current competitive grant model leaves 93% of drug courts without direct federal funding and creates funding cliffs when grants expire. Formula-based funding models (similar to Byrne JAG) provide predictable, sustainable resources. States that have dedicated funding sources for drug courts (e.g., Missouri's statewide drug court funding from general revenue) show more consistent quality and broader geographic coverage than states relying on competitive grants alone.

**Implementation**: Federal legislation creating a Drug Court Block Grant or adding a drug court formula allocation to existing block grants. State legislation redirecting a portion of cannabis tax revenue (in legal states) to treatment court operations. Advocacy for inclusion of drug court funding in annual appropriations at predictable, increasing levels.

**Cost/Resources**: Formula-based federal investment of $500 million-$1 billion annually would represent a 6-12x increase over current DCDGP levels and could support drug court access for 50% of eligible defendants. Revenue from cannabis taxes in legal states generated $3.7 billion in 2023 (Tax Foundation, 2024); redirecting 5% would yield $185 million.

**Timeline**: 2-3 years for legislative authorization; 5 years for full implementation.

**Challenges**: Congressional willingness to increase appropriations. Competition with other criminal justice and public health programs for limited funds. State-level political dynamics around cannabis tax allocation.

**Impact Metrics**: Total federal and state funding for drug courts; percentage of eligible defendants served; geographic coverage (percentage of counties with drug court access); sustainability metrics (percentage of courts with stable multi-year funding).

## International Models

### Australia: Drug Court of New South Wales

**Description**: Established in 1999, the Drug Court of New South Wales provides an intensive, three-phase program (typically 12 months) for defendants with drug dependency charged with offenses that would normally attract a prison sentence. The court uses a multidisciplinary team model similar to U.S. drug courts but with stronger integration with the public health system, including universal access to pharmacotherapy (opioid substitution therapy).

**Results**: A 2008 evaluation by the Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research (BOCSAR) found that drug court participants had a 17% lower reconviction rate than comparison defendants over a 4.5-year follow-up. The program produced net savings of AUD $7,111 (approximately USD $4,700) per participant.

**Applicability to U.S.**: The NSW model demonstrates that drug courts can function effectively within a universal healthcare system. Its integration with public health services and unrestricted pharmacotherapy access provides a model for U.S. courts seeking to improve MAT access and post-graduation care transitions.

### Canada: Drug Treatment Courts

**Description**: Canada operates drug treatment courts in six cities (Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary, Winnipeg, Ottawa, Toronto) under federal Department of Justice funding. Canadian drug treatment courts emphasize harm reduction alongside recovery, allow supervised consumption services as part of the treatment continuum, and integrate with Canada's universal healthcare system.

**Results**: A 2015 evaluation by the Department of Justice Canada found a 36% reduction in reconviction for drug treatment court participants, with a 55% graduation rate and significant reductions in drug use and criminal activity during participation.

**Applicability to U.S.**: Canada's integration of harm reduction principles into the drug court model -- including supervised consumption -- represents an approach that most U.S. drug courts have not adopted. The Canadian model suggests that harm reduction and court-supervised treatment are compatible, challenging the abstinence-only orientation of many American drug courts.

### United Kingdom: Drug Rehabilitation Requirements

**Description**: The UK uses Drug Rehabilitation Requirements (DRRs) as part of community sentences, requiring defendants to undergo treatment as a condition of a non-custodial sentence. Unlike U.S. drug courts, DRRs are integrated into the probation system rather than operating as separate courts. Treatment is provided through the National Health Service (NHS).

**Results**: Ministry of Justice evaluations show that DRRs reduce reoffending by approximately 20% compared to custodial sentences. However, completion rates are lower than U.S. drug courts (approximately 40% completion), suggesting that the intensive judicial monitoring component of the drug court model may contribute to better retention.

**Applicability to U.S.**: The UK experience suggests that judicial supervision (a distinguishing feature of drug courts) adds value beyond simply ordering treatment. This has implications for the debate about whether drug courts or probation-based treatment mandates are more effective.

## Pilot Programs and Demonstrations

- **LEAD (Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion), Seattle, WA**: Launched 2011, independently evaluated, now replicated in 80+ jurisdictions. Demonstrates pre-arrest diversion as a complement to drug courts.
- **Hawaii's Opportunity Probation with Enforcement (HOPE)**: Developed by Judge Steven Alm in Honolulu, HOPE uses swift, certain, and proportionate sanctions for probation violations. Evaluated by RAND (2016) with mixed but instructive results for graduated sanctions design in drug courts.
- **Tulsa County, OK -- Expanded Eligibility Pilot**: Expanded drug court eligibility to include individuals with violent offense histories (excluding current violent charges). Early results show comparable recidivism reduction without increased public safety incidents.
- **Hennepin County, MN -- Equity-Focused Drug Court**: Implemented culturally responsive treatment, removed prosecutor-controlled referral, and adopted equity-specific outcome monitoring. Has reduced Black-white graduation rate gap by 6 percentage points.

## Sequencing and Prioritization

### Quick Wins (0-2 years)

- Expand federal MAT mandate to all drug court funding sources (not just DCDGP)
- Require disaggregated racial equity data reporting as a condition of all federal drug court funding
- Issue federal guidance encouraging expanded eligibility criteria based on risk-need-responsivity assessment
- Fund LEAD-model pre-arrest diversion pilots in 50 additional jurisdictions

### Medium-term Reforms (2-5 years)

- Establish national drug court certification system
- Create formula-based federal drug court funding (Drug Court Block Grant)
- Require drug court-community health system integration partnerships
- Expand veterans treatment courts to all VA-served regions

### Long-term Transformation (5-10 years)

- Achieve universal drug court or equivalent diversion access for at least 50% of eligible defendants
- Eliminate statistically significant racial disparities in drug court access and outcomes
- Fully integrate drug courts into a broader treatment continuum that includes pre-arrest diversion, community-based voluntary treatment, and court-supervised treatment
- Establish sustainable, non-grant-dependent funding for all drug courts

## Complementary Policies

- **Decriminalization of personal possession**: Reducing criminal penalties for personal drug possession would reduce the volume of defendants entering the criminal justice system while preserving drug courts for those whose offenses or circumstances warrant court supervision.
- **Medicaid expansion**: In states that have not expanded Medicaid, many drug court participants lack health insurance for treatment. Full Medicaid expansion would provide a reimbursement mechanism for drug court treatment services.
- **Behavioral health workforce development**: Drug court treatment capacity is constrained by a shortage of 250,000-300,000 behavioral health professionals (SAMHSA, 2023). Federal and state investment in SUD counselor training, loan forgiveness, and licensure reform is essential.
- **Housing First programs**: Housing instability is a leading predictor of drug court failure. Investment in permanent supportive housing and Housing First programs would improve drug court outcomes.
- **Reentry services**: Drug courts that serve post-incarceration populations need robust reentry support, including employment services, housing assistance, and community supervision coordination.
