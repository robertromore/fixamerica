# Drug Courts

This subdirectory provides a detailed analysis of drug courts and therapeutic jurisprudence in the American criminal justice system, examining their role as alternatives to traditional prosecution and incarceration for substance-related offenses.

## Overview

Drug courts represent one of the most significant innovations in the American justice system over the past three decades. Established to address the revolving door of addiction and incarceration, these specialized courts combine judicial supervision with mandatory substance abuse treatment, regular drug testing, graduated sanctions and incentives, and community-based support services. Since the first drug court opened in Miami-Dade County, Florida in 1989, the model has expanded to over 4,000 drug treatment courts operating across all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories.

The evidence base for drug courts is substantial. Meta-analyses consistently show that drug court participants have lower recidivism rates than comparable defendants processed through traditional courts, with reductions averaging 8 to 14 percentage points. Drug courts also generate cost savings of $2 to $27 for every $1 invested, depending on the court model and local context. However, significant challenges remain: drug courts serve only a fraction of eligible defendants, eligibility criteria often exclude those with the most serious addictions or criminal histories, and racial disparities in access and outcomes persist. The model also raises fundamental questions about judicial power, coerced treatment, and whether the criminal justice system should serve as a gateway to healthcare.

This analysis examines the drug court model comprehensively, including its structure and operations, effectiveness evidence, eligibility and access barriers, equity concerns, and proposals for reform and expansion. It explores both the promise and the limitations of using courts as therapeutic intervention points, and proposes evidence-based improvements to maximize public health outcomes while protecting participants' rights.
