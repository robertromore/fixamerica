# Drug Courts: Stakeholders

The drug court system is shaped by the interactions of several key groups, each with its own interests, power, and resources. Unlike traditional criminal courts, drug courts require collaboration among actors who are typically adversaries, creating a unique stakeholder dynamic that is both a strength and a source of tension.

## Who Is Affected

### Primary Stakeholders

| Group | Impact | Size | Key Interests |
|-------|--------|------|---------------|
| Drug court participants | Direct recipients of court-supervised treatment; face sanctions for noncompliance and charge dismissal or reduction upon graduation | ~150,000 annually (NADCP, 2023) | Access to treatment, fair sanctions, charge dismissal, avoiding incarceration |
| Family members of participants | Indirectly affected by participant's recovery or failure; may bear financial and caregiving burdens | ~400,000-600,000 (estimated 3-4 family members per participant) | Participant recovery, family stability, reduced family disruption |
| Eligible defendants not served | Approximately 90% of those who could benefit lack access to drug courts | ~1.35 million annually (SAMHSA/NADCP estimates, 2023) | Access to treatment alternatives, avoiding incarceration for addiction |
| Communities affected by drug-related crime | Neighborhoods experiencing drug-related crime, disorder, and public health consequences | Tens of millions in high-impact communities | Reduced crime, public safety, community health |
| Victims of drug-related offenses | Individuals harmed by crimes committed by people with substance use disorders | Varies by jurisdiction | Restitution, safety, reduced recidivism |

### Secondary Stakeholders

- **Employers**: Drug court participants who achieve recovery return to the workforce. Conversely, employers may face challenges if employees enter drug court programs requiring time off for treatment and court appearances. Nationally, substance use disorders cost employers an estimated $81 billion annually in lost productivity (NIDA, 2023).
- **Taxpayers**: Drug courts cost $5,000-$11,000 per participant but generate $2.21-$27 in savings per dollar invested through reduced incarceration, healthcare, and criminal justice costs (WSIPP, 2018; NPC Research, 2019).
- **Children of participants**: Family treatment courts directly address child welfare, but children of adult drug court participants are also affected. An estimated 8.7 million children have a parent with a substance use disorder (SAMHSA, 2023).
- **Treatment workforce**: Substance abuse counselors, social workers, and clinical supervisors who provide treatment services in drug court settings. The behavioral health workforce faces severe shortages nationally.

## Who Has Power

### Decision Makers

| Actor | Role | Authority | Resources | Influence Level |
|-------|------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| Drug court judges | Preside over hearings, impose sanctions/incentives, make graduation/termination decisions | Broad judicial discretion within program parameters | Court staff, local government support | High |
| Prosecutors | Control referral and eligibility screening in most jurisdictions | Charging discretion, plea bargaining authority | Office staff, case files, law enforcement partnerships | High |
| State legislators | Set drug court authorizing statutes, appropriate state funding, establish standards | Legislative authority over criminal justice policy | Budget authority, committee oversight | High |
| Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) | Administers federal Drug Court Discretionary Grant Program ($85 million, FY2024) | Federal grant-making, technical assistance, data collection | $85 million annual grants, National Drug Court Resource Center | High |
| SAMHSA | Administers treatment block grants and State Opioid Response grants accessible to drug courts | Federal grant-making, treatment standards | $1.86 billion SABG (FY2024), $1.5 billion SOR | Medium |
| State drug court coordinators | Oversee state-level drug court systems, set standards, distribute state funding | Administrative authority, standard-setting | Varies by state; some have substantial budgets, others minimal | Medium |

### Key Organizations and Institutions

- **National Association of Drug Court Professionals (NADCP)**: The preeminent advocacy and standard-setting organization for drug courts. NADCP publishes the Best Practice Standards, hosts the annual training conference (attended by ~6,000 professionals), operates the National Drug Court Institute (NDCI), and lobbies Congress for drug court funding. NADCP's positions on eligibility, MAT, and equity have significant influence on court design nationwide.
- **National Drug Court Resource Center (NDCRC)**: Operated by the American University Justice Programs Office under a BJA contract, NDCRC provides data collection, technical assistance, and research dissemination. It maintains the most comprehensive database of drug court locations and characteristics.
- **National Center for State Courts (NCSC)**: Provides research, consulting, and technical assistance to state court systems, including drug courts. NCSC has produced significant research on drug court operations and outcomes.
- **Treatment Research Institute (TRI)**: Conducts research on substance abuse treatment within criminal justice settings, with particular expertise in drug court evaluation and evidence-based practice implementation.
- **American Bar Association (ABA)**: Published Standards on Treatment Courts (2019) addressing defense counsel ethics, due process protections, and participant rights in drug courts.

### Influencers

- **National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers (NACDL)**: Has expressed concerns about due process protections in drug courts and the waiver of rights required for participation. Advocates for defense counsel to play a more active advocacy role.
- **Drug Policy Alliance (DPA)**: Advocates for decriminalization and harm reduction rather than court-based treatment mandates. While not opposed to drug courts per se, DPA argues they should be replaced by voluntary, community-based treatment and pre-arrest diversion programs.
- **American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)**: Monitors drug court operations for civil liberties concerns, particularly regarding coerced treatment, religious programming (12-step requirements), and disparate impact on minority defendants.
- **Heritage Foundation / Manhattan Institute**: Conservative think tanks that support drug courts as a cost-effective, accountability-focused alternative to incarceration. Their endorsement has been critical for bipartisan political support.
- **Addiction medicine professional organizations**: American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) and the American Academy of Addiction Psychiatry (AAAP) advocate for MAT access and evidence-based treatment standards in drug courts.

## Stakeholder Interests and Alignment

### Aligned Interests (Potential Coalition Partners)

| Coalition | Shared Interest | Strength |
|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| NADCP + BJA + State Coordinators | Drug court expansion and quality improvement | Strong -- established working relationships and federal funding pipeline |
| Conservative fiscal hawks + Progressive reformers | Reducing incarceration costs through treatment alternatives | Moderate -- agreement on goals but different underlying values |
| Treatment providers + Participant advocates | Expanding treatment access and reducing barriers | Moderate -- aligned on access but potential conflicts on coercion |
| Veterans' organizations + Bipartisan congressional caucus | Veterans treatment court expansion and funding | Strong -- veterans courts have the broadest bipartisan support of any drug court type |
| NADCP + ASAM + AAAP | Universal MAT access in drug courts | Strong -- evidence base is clear, resistance is primarily cultural |

### Conflicting Interests

- **Prosecutors vs. Defense Attorneys**: Prosecutors want to control who enters drug court (gatekeeping authority), while defense attorneys want broader eligibility and stronger due process protections. This tension shapes the fundamental design of drug court programs.
- **Drug Court Advocates vs. Decriminalization Advocates**: NADCP and the drug court establishment view drug courts as a proven model that should be expanded. Organizations like the Drug Policy Alliance view drug courts as an inadequate intermediate step that should eventually be replaced by voluntary community-based treatment accessible without criminal justice involvement.
- **Abstinence-Based Treatment Providers vs. MAT Advocates**: Some treatment providers that contract with drug courts are philosophically committed to abstinence-only approaches and resist the shift toward medication-assisted treatment. Addiction medicine organizations view MAT restrictions as clinically negligent.
- **Judges vs. Standardization Advocates**: Drug court judges value their discretion to tailor programs to local conditions and individual participants. Researchers and standard-setting bodies push for greater standardization based on evidence, which some judges view as infringing on judicial independence.
- **Participants vs. Court Authority**: Participants want treatment and charge dismissal with minimal court intrusion. Courts impose extensive monitoring, testing, and compliance requirements. The balance between supervision and autonomy is a source of ongoing tension.

### The Drug Court Iron Triangle

Drug courts operate within a self-reinforcing power structure:

1. **NADCP** sets standards, provides training, and lobbies Congress for funding
2. **BJA** distributes federal grants based on NADCP-influenced criteria
3. **Local drug courts** apply for and receive grants, implement NADCP-endorsed practices, and generate outcome data that NADCP uses to justify continued funding

This triangle has been effective at sustaining and gradually improving drug courts but has also created resistance to structural reforms that would fundamentally alter the model -- such as replacing court-based treatment mandates with pre-arrest diversion or community-based voluntary treatment.

## Influence Mechanisms

How stakeholders exert influence on drug court policy:

- **Lobbying**: NADCP maintains a Washington, D.C. office and conducts annual legislative advocacy. The organization's "National Drug Court Month" campaign (May) generates constituent contacts to Congress. NADCP spent approximately $320,000 on lobbying in 2023 (OpenSecrets, 2024).
- **Campaign Contributions**: Drug court stakeholders do not make significant direct campaign contributions, but the broader criminal justice reform coalition -- including organizations like the Charles Koch Institute, ACLU, and Right on Crime -- has spent tens of millions supporting reform-minded candidates.
- **Revolving Door**: Former drug court judges, prosecutors, and coordinators frequently join NADCP, NDCI, or consulting firms that provide technical assistance to drug courts, creating a professional network that reinforces the current model.
- **Public Advocacy**: Drug court graduation ceremonies are effective public relations events, often attended by local media and elected officials. Participant testimonials are among the most powerful advocacy tools for drug court funding.
- **Expertise/Information**: NADCP and NDCRC control the primary data systems, training curricula, and research dissemination channels for the drug court field. This information monopoly gives them significant influence over how drug courts are understood by policymakers and the public.
