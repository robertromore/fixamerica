# Drug Courts: Legislation

## Overview

The legislative approach to drug court reform combines federal reauthorization and expansion with state model legislation and regulatory action. The federal strategy focuses on reauthorizing the Drug Court Discretionary Grant Program with increased appropriations, mandating medication-assisted treatment access, requiring racial equity data reporting, and creating pre-arrest diversion grant authority. State model legislation establishes drug court standards, creates dedicated funding mechanisms, and authorizes pre-arrest diversion programs. The goal is a comprehensive legislative framework that expands drug court access, improves quality, ensures equity, and integrates drug courts into a broader treatment continuum.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments required for this reform.* Drug court policy operates within established congressional authority under the Spending Clause (Art. I, Sec. 8, Cl. 1) and the Commerce Clause. Federal drug court grants condition funding on compliance with federal standards, a well-established mechanism upheld in *South Dakota v. Dole*, 483 U.S. 203 (1987).

119th CONGRESS, 1st Session

AN ACT

To reauthorize and improve the Drug Court Discretionary Grant Program,
to expand access to medication-assisted treatment in drug courts, to
require racial equity data reporting, to establish a Pre-Arrest
Diversion Grant Program, and for other purposes.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Drug Court Improvement and Expansion
Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) As of 2023, approximately 4,000 drug treatment courts operate
in the United States, serving an estimated 150,000 participants
annually (National Association of Drug Court Professionals, 2023).

(2) The Multisite Adult Drug Court Evaluation, funded by the
National Institute of Justice, found that drug court participants had
a 12 percentage point lower recidivism rate than comparison group
members (40 percent versus 52 percent) over a 24-month follow-up
period (Rossman et al., 2011).

(3) Cost-benefit analyses by the Washington State Institute for
Public Policy (2018) and NPC Research (2019) consistently find
positive returns on investment ranging from $2.21 to $27 per $1
invested in drug courts.

(4) Drug courts currently serve approximately 10 percent of the
estimated 1.5 million individuals arrested annually who have
substance use disorders that could benefit from court-supervised
treatment (NADCP and SAMHSA estimates, 2023).

(5) Medication-assisted treatment reduces opioid overdose mortality
by 50 percent or more (Larochelle et al., 2018), yet 21 percent of
drug courts prohibit or discourage its use (NADCP National Survey,
2022).

(6) Documented racial disparities persist in drug court operations:
Black defendants are referred at lower rates, accepted at lower rates,
and graduate at lower rates than white defendants (Marlowe et al.,
2018; NADCP National Survey, 2022).

(7) Pre-arrest diversion programs such as Law Enforcement Assisted
Diversion (LEAD) have demonstrated 58 percent reductions in
recidivism (Collins et al., 2017) and provide treatment access
without requiring criminal justice processing.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:

(1) DRUG COURT.—The term "drug court" means a court-supervised
treatment program that—
    (A) integrates substance abuse treatment with justice system
    case processing;
    (B) uses a nonadversarial approach involving prosecution,
    defense counsel, and treatment providers;
    (C) requires regular drug testing;
    (D) uses graduated sanctions and incentives; and
    (E) requires ongoing judicial interaction with participants.

(2) MEDICATION-ASSISTED TREATMENT.—The term "medication-assisted
treatment" means the use of medications approved by the Food and Drug
Administration for the treatment of substance use disorders, including
buprenorphine, methadone, naltrexone, and any other medication
subsequently approved for such purpose, in combination with counseling
and behavioral therapies.

(3) PRE-ARREST DIVERSION PROGRAM.—The term "pre-arrest diversion
program" means a program that diverts individuals with substance use
disorders away from arrest and criminal processing and into community-
based treatment services at the point of law enforcement contact,
without requiring formal arrest, booking, or criminal charges.

(4) RISK-NEED-RESPONSIVITY ASSESSMENT.—The term "risk-need-
responsivity assessment" means a validated assessment instrument that
evaluates an individual's risk of reoffending, clinical treatment
needs, and responsiveness to different treatment modalities.

(5) ELIGIBLE ENTITY.—The term "eligible entity" means a State,
State court, local court, unit of local government, or Indian tribal
government.

SEC. 4. REAUTHORIZATION OF DRUG COURT DISCRETIONARY GRANT PROGRAM.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 2901 of title I of the Omnibus Crime
Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3797u) is amended—
    (1) by striking "$85,000,000" and inserting "$250,000,000"; and
    (2) by adding at the end the following:

"(f) MEDICATION-ASSISTED TREATMENT REQUIREMENT.—
    (1) IN GENERAL.—No grant may be made under this part unless the
    applicant certifies that the drug court program—
        (A) does not prohibit, discourage, or impose conditions on
        the use of medication-assisted treatment by program
        participants;
        (B) does not require participants to taper or discontinue
        medication-assisted treatment as a condition of phase
        advancement, graduation, or continued participation; and
        (C) makes medication-assisted treatment available to all
        participants with opioid use disorder or alcohol use disorder
        for whom such treatment is clinically appropriate.
    (2) APPLICABILITY.—The requirement under paragraph (1) shall
    apply to grants made under this part and to any drug court program
    that receives Federal funding under any other provision of Federal
    law, including—
        (A) the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program;
        (B) the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant;
        (C) the State Opioid Response Grant Program; and
        (D) the Second Chance Act grant programs.

"(g) RACIAL EQUITY DATA REPORTING.—
    (1) IN GENERAL.—Each drug court program receiving a grant under
    this part shall collect and report to the Bureau of Justice
    Assistance, on an annual basis, data on—
        (A) the race, ethnicity, gender, and income level of all
        individuals—
            (i) screened for drug court eligibility;
            (ii) referred to the drug court;
            (iii) accepted into the drug court;
            (iv) receiving sanctions during participation;
            (v) graduating from the drug court; and
            (vi) terminated from the drug court;
        (B) recidivism outcomes disaggregated by the categories
        described in subparagraph (A); and
        (C) treatment services received disaggregated by the
        categories described in subparagraph (A).
    (2) PUBLIC AVAILABILITY.—The Bureau of Justice Assistance shall
    make the data collected under paragraph (1) publicly available in
    aggregate form on the internet, with appropriate protections for
    individual privacy.
    (3) CORRECTIVE ACTION.—If data collected under paragraph (1)
    reveals statistically significant racial or ethnic disparities in
    acceptance, graduation, or outcome rates for 2 consecutive
    reporting periods, the drug court program shall develop and
    implement a corrective action plan, subject to review by the
    Bureau of Justice Assistance.

"(h) ELIGIBILITY GUIDANCE.—The Attorney General shall issue
guidance encouraging drug court programs receiving grants under this
part to—
    (1) use validated risk-need-responsivity assessment instruments
    to determine eligibility, rather than categorical exclusions
    based solely on offense type;
    (2) target participants assessed as high-risk and high-need,
    consistent with research demonstrating that drug courts produce
    the greatest effects for such individuals; and
    (3) consider expanding eligibility to individuals with co-
    occurring mental health disorders and individuals with prior
    nonviolent offense histories.".

SEC. 5. PRE-ARREST DIVERSION GRANT PROGRAM.

```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 2 (Findings)**: Establishes the evidence base for drug court effectiveness, identifies the treatment gap, and documents the equity and MAT access problems that the legislation addresses.
- **Section 4 (Reauthorization)**: Triples DCDGP appropriations from $85 million to $250 million annually. Extends the MAT mandate to all federal funding sources (not just DCDGP). Creates mandatory racial equity data reporting with corrective action requirements. Issues eligibility guidance favoring high-risk/high-need targeting.
- **Section 5 (Pre-Arrest Diversion)**: Creates a new $100 million annual grant program for LEAD-model pre-arrest diversion programs, providing a non-criminal-justice pathway to treatment that complements drug courts.
- **Section 6 (Certification)**: Authorizes a national drug court certification system with a long-term tie to funding preference.

**Implementation Timeline**:

| Milestone | Deadline | Responsible Party |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|
| Act takes effect | 180 days after enactment | N/A |
| BJA publishes updated grant solicitation with MAT and equity requirements | 1 year after enactment | BJA |
| First pre-arrest diversion grants awarded | 1 year after enactment | BJA |
| Racial equity reporting template published | 9 months after enactment | BJA / NDCRC |
| First annual report to Congress | 1 year after enactment | Attorney General |
| National certification system design complete | 2 years after enactment | Attorney General / Contractor |
| Certification pilot begins | 3 years after enactment | Certification body |
| Certification preference in grant awards begins | FY2031 | BJA |

**Regulatory Authority**: The Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) within the Department of Justice administers the DCDGP and the new Pre-Arrest Diversion Grant Program. SAMHSA provides treatment quality guidance and coordination with the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant.

**Challenges**:

- **Appropriations uncertainty**: Authorizing $250 million does not guarantee that amount will be appropriated; actual funding depends on annual appropriations.
- **MAT mandate enforcement**: Conditioning all federal funding (not just DCDGP) on MAT access may face resistance from programs funded through other streams.
- **Data collection burden**: Mandating disaggregated data reporting imposes costs on drug courts, many of which have limited data infrastructure.

**Refinements**:

- **Phase-in data requirements**: Allow 2 years for courts to build data infrastructure before full compliance is required.
- **Technical assistance funding**: Dedicate a portion of appropriations (5-10%) to technical assistance for data collection, equity improvement, and MAT implementation.
- **Grandfathering**: Provide a 3-year transition period for courts currently restricting MAT to come into compliance.

## State Model Legislation

### Model Drug Court Standards and Expansion Act

**Purpose**: Establish minimum state-level standards for drug court operations, create a dedicated state funding mechanism, authorize pre-arrest diversion programs, and require racial equity monitoring.

**Adaptability Notes**: States should customize eligibility criteria, funding levels, and administrative structures based on population size, existing drug court infrastructure, treatment provider capacity, and fiscal capacity. States with existing drug court standards should align this model legislation with their current frameworks.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act shall be known and may be cited as the "[State] Drug Court
Standards and Expansion Act of 2026".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS.

The Legislature finds that:

(a) Drug courts have been shown to reduce recidivism by 8 to 14
percentage points compared to traditional criminal processing.

(b) Cost-benefit analyses show returns of $2 to $27 for every $1
invested in drug courts.

(c) Drug courts in this State currently serve approximately [X]%
of eligible defendants, leaving [X] individuals without access to
court-supervised treatment annually.

(d) Racial disparities in drug court access and outcomes require
systematic monitoring and corrective action.

SECTION 3. DEFINITIONS.

(a) "Drug court" means [same definition as federal legislation].

(b) "Medication-assisted treatment" means [same definition].

(c) "State Drug Court Coordinator" means the office or individual
designated by the [Chief Justice / Governor] to oversee drug court
operations statewide.

SECTION 4. DRUG COURT STANDARDS.

(a) All drug courts in this State shall—
    (1) use validated risk-need-responsivity assessment instruments
    for eligibility determination;
    (2) permit unrestricted access to medication-assisted treatment
    for all participants with clinically appropriate substance use
    disorders;
    (3) collect and report outcome data disaggregated by race,
    ethnicity, gender, and income level to the State Drug Court
    Coordinator on an annual basis;
    (4) implement graduated sanctions and incentives consistent
    with evidence-based practices; and
    (5) develop care transition protocols connecting participants
    to community-based treatment upon graduation.

(b) The State Drug Court Coordinator shall develop certification
criteria consistent with the standards in subsection (a) and national
best practice standards. Drug courts shall achieve certification
within 3 years of the effective date of this Act.

SECTION 5. FUNDING.

(a) There is hereby established the Drug Court Expansion Fund,
funded by—
    (1) an annual appropriation of $[X] from the State general fund;
    (2) [X]% of revenues collected from [cannabis taxes / drug-
    related fines and forfeiture proceeds / other dedicated revenue]; and
    (3) any federal funds received for drug court purposes.

(b) Funds shall be distributed to counties based on a formula
considering eligible defendant population, local treatment costs,
and existing drug court capacity.

SECTION 6. PRE-ARREST DIVERSION AUTHORIZATION.

(a) Law enforcement agencies in this State are authorized to divert
individuals with suspected substance use disorders to community-based
treatment services at the point of contact, without requiring arrest,
booking, or criminal charges.

(b) The [State agency] shall develop training curricula and program
standards for pre-arrest diversion programs.

SECTION 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on [date], except that the certification
requirement in Section 4(b) shall take effect 3 years after the

```

---

## Regulatory Framework

### Administrative Implementation

**Primary Agency**: Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), U.S. Department of Justice

**Rulemaking Required**:

1. **Updated DCDGP Grant Solicitation**: Incorporate MAT mandate, racial equity reporting requirements, and expanded eligibility guidance within 1 year of enactment.
2. **Pre-Arrest Diversion Grant Program Solicitation**: Develop new grant solicitation with eligibility criteria, priority areas, and reporting requirements within 9 months of enactment.
3. **Racial Equity Reporting Standard**: Develop standardized data collection templates and reporting formats in collaboration with NDCRC and NADCP within 9 months of enactment.
4. **Certification System Design**: Develop or contract for national certification criteria and evaluation protocols within 2 years of enactment.

**Enforcement Mechanisms**:

- **Funding Conditions**: Non-compliance with MAT or equity reporting requirements results in loss of eligibility for federal drug court funding.
- **Corrective Action Plans**: Courts showing persistent racial disparities must develop corrective action plans subject to BJA review; failure to develop or implement plans may result in funding reduction.
- **Annual Reporting**: Attorney General reports to Congress annually on compliance, outcomes, and disparities, creating public accountability.
- **Certification Incentive**: Beginning FY2031, certified courts receive preference in competitive grant awards.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Spending Clause Authority**: Federal drug court grants are a quintessential exercise of congressional spending power. Conditioning grants on MAT access and equity reporting falls well within the permissible scope established in *South Dakota v. Dole*, 483 U.S. 203 (1987), as the conditions are related to the purpose of the grant (improving drug court quality) and are not coercive (states and courts may decline funding).

**Due Process Concerns**: Drug courts require participants to waive certain procedural rights (e.g., the right to trial, privilege against self-incrimination in court hearings) as a condition of participation. Courts have generally upheld these waivers as voluntary, but the ABA Standards on Treatment Courts (2019) recommend enhanced due process protections, particularly regarding the right to counsel during sanction proceedings.

**Eighth Amendment and MAT Access**: The holding in *Pesce v. Coppinger*, 355 F. Supp. 3d 35 (D. Mass. 2018), which found that denying MAT to an incarcerated person violated the Eighth Amendment, could extend to drug court participants, particularly those serving jail sanctions.

### Preemption

The Drug Court Improvement and Expansion Act does not expressly preempt state drug court laws but conditions federal funding on compliance with minimum standards. States remain free to establish higher standards. The Pre-Arrest Diversion Grant Program does not preempt state criminal law; it funds programs that operate within existing state authority.

### Enforcement and Compliance

Compliance is primarily enforced through funding conditions. BJA may conduct audits, site visits, and data reviews to verify compliance. Courts found to be non-compliant may face grant suspension, termination, or disqualification from future awards.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | How It Could Be Exploited | Severity | Proposed Fix |
|----------|---------------------------|----------|--------------|
| MAT mandate applies only to federal funding recipients | Courts funded entirely by state or local sources could continue prohibiting MAT | High | State model legislation requires MAT access regardless of funding source; federal advocacy for MAT access as a condition of all public funding |
| Equity reporting limited to federally funded courts | Non-federally funded courts avoid transparency requirements | Medium | State-level legislation mandating equity reporting for all drug courts regardless of funding source |
| Risk-need-responsivity guidance is non-binding | Courts may continue using categorical offense-based exclusions despite guidance | Medium | Amend future legislation to make RNR assessment a condition of funding rather than guidance |
| Corrective action for disparities triggered only after 2 consecutive years | Courts can show improvement in Year 2, regress in Year 3, and avoid corrective action indefinitely | Medium | Require corrective action if disparities exist in any 2 of 3 consecutive years; reduce trigger period to 1 year |
| Certification system is voluntary until FY2031 | Courts may delay certification indefinitely while continuing to receive grants | Low | Accelerate the timeline; require certification as a condition of all new grants by Year 5 |
| Pre-arrest diversion grants do not mandate specific program models | Jurisdictions could label minimal-effort programs as "diversion" to access funding | Medium | Establish minimum program standards (case management, treatment linkage, data collection) in grant solicitation |

### Known Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause | Mitigation |
|-------|--------|------------|------------|
| Appropriation uncertainty | Authorized funding levels may not be appropriated, undermining expansion plans | Congressional appropriations process is annual and discretionary | Build bipartisan support; include drug court funding in larger criminal justice packages; develop state-level dedicated revenue as a supplement |
| Treatment workforce shortage | Even with expanded funding, treatment provider capacity may not scale fast enough | National shortage of 250,000-300,000 behavioral health professionals (SAMHSA, 2023) | Coordinate with workforce development legislation; expand telehealth for rural courts; fund loan forgiveness for SUD counselors |
| Data infrastructure gaps | Many drug courts lack the information systems needed for disaggregated data reporting | Historic underinvestment in drug court data systems | Dedicate 5-10% of grant funds to data infrastructure; provide technical assistance through NDCRC |
| Prosecutor resistance to eligibility expansion | Prosecutors control referral in most jurisdictions and may resist expanded eligibility | Prosecutorial independence and political incentives | Shift to clinical screening at booking; develop parallel pathways (defense attorney petition, self-referral) |
| Limited scope of pre-arrest diversion | $100 million annually is insufficient for nationwide implementation | Competing budget priorities | Scale diversion funding in subsequent reauthorizations; seek state and local matching funds |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Close the non-federal funding loophole**: Pursue state model legislation (Section 5 above) that applies MAT and equity requirements to all drug courts regardless of funding source. Encourage NADCP to tie its voluntary certification to MAT and equity compliance.
2. **Strengthen RNR assessment requirement**: In the first reauthorization cycle, convert non-binding eligibility guidance to a mandatory condition of funding. Require all funded courts to use a validated RNR instrument by Year 3.
3. **Accelerate certification timeline**: Amend the Act in the first reauthorization to require certification as a condition of all grants (not just preference) by FY2029, two years earlier than the current timeline.
4. **Address treatment workforce**: Introduce companion legislation (the Behavioral Health Workforce Expansion Act) authorizing loan forgiveness, training grants, and licensure reform for SUD counselors, social workers, and peer recovery specialists.
5. **Expand diversion funding**: In subsequent appropriations cycles, increase Pre-Arrest Diversion Grant Program funding to $250 million annually to support nationwide implementation.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

The Act authorizes appropriations for 5 fiscal years (FY2026-FY2030), requiring congressional reauthorization. The annual reporting requirement (Section 7) provides Congress with the data needed to evaluate effectiveness and make adjustments at reauthorization. The certification system includes built-in review: certification must be renewed every 3 years based on updated outcome data.
