# Drug Courts: Root Causes

## Systemic Analysis

The current challenges in drug court policy are not the result of a single failure but of several long-term, interlocking trends. These include the structural limitations of embedding healthcare delivery within the criminal justice system, misaligned incentive structures that reward punishment over treatment, chronic underfunding relative to need, the legacy of racially disparate drug enforcement, and institutional resistance to evidence-based practices. Understanding these root causes is essential for designing reforms that address the systemic barriers to effective, equitable drug court operations.

## Structural Limitations of the Criminal Justice Gateway

### Arrest as a Prerequisite for Treatment

The fundamental design of drug courts requires that an individual be arrested, charged, and processed through the criminal justice system before accessing court-supervised treatment. This creates several cascading problems:

- People must be harmed by the criminal justice system (arrest record, detention, employment disruption, stigma) before they can benefit from the treatment it offers
- Those who cannot afford bail or who face immigration consequences may be deterred from participating
- The criminal justice gateway is itself racially biased: Black Americans are nearly four times more likely to be arrested for drug possession than white Americans despite comparable usage rates (ACLU, 2020), meaning the system that feeds drug courts is inequitable at the point of entry

**Evidence**: Research by the Vera Institute of Justice (2019) found that in jurisdictions without pre-arrest diversion alternatives, the criminal justice system was the primary pathway to substance abuse treatment for 40-60% of participants, even though community-based treatment would have been more appropriate and less costly for many.

### The Adversarial System vs. Therapeutic Goals

Drug courts operate within a judicial system designed for adversarial proceedings, not therapeutic intervention. Despite the "nonadversarial" philosophy articulated in the Ten Key Components, tensions between justice and health goals are embedded in the model:

- Defense attorneys face ethical conflicts between their obligation to advocate for clients' legal interests and the drug court team's expectation of collaborative participation
- Prosecutors retain gatekeeping authority over who enters drug court, which allows eligibility decisions to be driven by charging discretion rather than clinical need
- Judges, trained in law rather than addiction medicine, make decisions about treatment that may conflict with clinical best practices

**Evidence**: The American Bar Association's Standards on Treatment Courts (2019) documented the ethical tensions defense attorneys face in drug court settings and recommended reforms to protect due process while maintaining therapeutic goals.

## Restrictive Eligibility Criteria

### Exclusion of High-Need Populations

Most drug courts restrict eligibility to nonviolent, first-time or low-level offenders. While this reduces political risk, it excludes the populations that research shows would benefit most:

- The MADCE (2012) found that drug courts had the **strongest effects for high-risk/high-need participants**, yet most courts screen out precisely this group
- Individuals with co-occurring mental health disorders -- estimated at 50-60% of those with SUD in the justice system (SAMHSA, 2023) -- are frequently excluded from drug courts or referred to separate mental health courts with limited treatment integration
- Individuals with violent offense histories are excluded in approximately 75% of drug courts (NADCP, 2022), despite evidence that the drug court model can be safely adapted for this population with appropriate modifications

**Evidence**: Marlowe et al. (2016) published research in *Drug Court Review* demonstrating that restricting drug courts to low-risk defendants reduces cost-effectiveness by applying intensive intervention to those who are least likely to reoffend regardless, while denying it to those who would benefit most.

### The "Creaming" Problem

Drug courts face an incentive to select participants most likely to succeed, rather than those most in need. This "creaming" -- selecting relatively low-risk participants to boost graduation and recidivism statistics -- undermines the model's potential impact:

- Courts that prioritize graduation rates may avoid accepting participants with severe polysubstance use, homelessness, or extensive criminal histories
- Federal grant metrics that emphasize graduation rates can inadvertently reward creaming by tying continued funding to outcome statistics

**Evidence**: Sevigny et al. (2013) documented creaming effects in federal drug court data, finding that jurisdictions with competitive grant structures were more likely to restrict eligibility criteria.

## Funding Inadequacy and Misalignment

### Chronic Underinvestment

Federal drug court funding has never been commensurate with the scale of the need:

- The $85 million DCDGP appropriation (FY2024) supports approximately 280 drug court programs -- less than 7% of the total
- State and local governments bear the majority of drug court costs but face competing demands from other criminal justice and social service programs
- The federal drug control budget (FY2025) allocates $46.1 billion total, of which drug courts represent less than 0.2%

**Evidence**: The NADCP estimates that universal access to drug courts for all eligible defendants would require approximately $3.8 billion annually (2023), roughly 45 times the current federal appropriation.

### Misaligned Fiscal Incentives

The costs and benefits of drug courts accrue to different levels of government and different budget categories, creating misaligned incentives:

- Counties and cities pay for drug court operations, but the savings from reduced incarceration accrue primarily to state prison budgets
- Treatment costs are borne by health budgets, while the benefits (reduced crime, increased employment, lower healthcare utilization) spread across multiple agencies
- Police and correctional officer unions may resist diversion programs that reduce caseloads and, by extension, personnel needs

**Evidence**: The Pew Charitable Trusts (2018) documented the "wrong pockets" problem in criminal justice reform, finding that local governments that invest in drug courts may not recoup the savings, which instead flow to state corrections budgets.

## Political Economy

### Who Benefits from the Status Quo

| Actor | Benefit | Economic Value | Incentive to Block Reform |
|-------|---------|----------------|---------------------------|
| For-profit treatment providers | Captive referral pipeline from courts | $4-8 billion annual revenue from court-ordered treatment | Oppose reforms that would shift treatment to voluntary, community-based models |
| Drug testing companies | Mandatory testing requirements | ~$2 billion annual market for court-mandated drug testing | Oppose reduced testing frequency or alternative compliance monitoring |
| Bail bond industry | Criminal charges generate bond revenue | ~$14 billion annual market (drug charges significant subset) | Oppose pre-arrest diversion that eliminates charges |
| Private probation companies | Drug court supervision extensions | ~$1.2 billion annual revenue | Oppose shortened program timelines |
| Law enforcement agencies | Drug arrests drive funding, staffing, and asset forfeiture revenue | Over $5 billion in annual asset forfeiture proceeds (all drugs, DOJ 2023) | Oppose diversion that reduces arrest volumes |
| Prosecutors | Charging discretion and plea bargaining leverage | Political capital from "tough on crime" posture | Oppose expanding drug court eligibility beyond prosecutor-controlled referral |

### Perverse Incentives

The current system creates several perverse incentives that undermine drug court effectiveness:

- **Prosecutors as gatekeepers**: Prosecutors control referral to drug court in most jurisdictions, which means clinical need is filtered through prosecutorial discretion, which is influenced by factors unrelated to treatment (case backlog, political considerations, office policy)
- **Graduation as the metric**: Emphasis on graduation rates rather than long-term outcomes encourages courts to select easy-to-graduate participants rather than high-need individuals
- **Sanctions as revenue**: In some jurisdictions, drug court fees and fines generate revenue that creates an incentive to maintain rather than reduce court involvement
- **Treatment provider dependence**: Treatment providers that depend on court referrals have little incentive to advocate for alternatives that would reduce their client base

## Institutional and Cultural Resistance

### Resistance to Medication-Assisted Treatment

Despite overwhelming evidence that MAT is the gold standard for opioid use disorder treatment, 21% of drug courts still prohibit or strongly discourage its use (NADCP/NDCRC Survey, 2022). This resistance is rooted in:

- **Abstinence-only ideology**: The drug court system grew out of a 12-step and abstinence-based treatment culture that views medication as "substituting one drug for another"
- **Judicial ignorance of addiction medicine**: Most drug court judges receive limited training in pharmacotherapy and may defer to treatment providers who share abstinence-only philosophies
- **Drug testing complications**: MAT medications (particularly buprenorphine) produce positive drug tests that complicate traditional testing protocols, creating administrative resistance
- **Cultural inertia**: Courts that have operated successfully for years using abstinence-only models resist changing practices that they perceive as working

**Evidence**: Matusow et al. (2013) surveyed drug courts nationwide and found that 50% of courts prohibited at least one FDA-approved MAT medication. While the figure has improved, SAMHSA (2022) reports that full, unrestricted MAT access remains the exception rather than the rule.

### Judicial Variability

Drug courts are uniquely dependent on individual judges. Research consistently shows that the judge is the single most important predictor of drug court quality, yet there are no enforceable standards for judicial behavior in drug courts:

- Judges set the tone, pace, and philosophy of the court
- Studies show that the amount of time a judge spends interacting with each participant directly correlates with program outcomes (Carey et al., 2012)
- When a drug court judge retires or rotates off the bench, program quality can change dramatically
- Some judges apply graduated sanctions with clinical precision; others are punitive, arbitrary, or disengaged

**Evidence**: The MADCE found that judicial behavior -- specifically the duration, quality, and fairness of bench interactions -- was the strongest predictor of participant outcomes, more important than treatment modality or program design.

## Why Reform Has Failed

Past reform efforts have been constrained by several factors:

1. **Fragmented authority**: Drug courts are primarily a local institution. There are approximately 4,000 independent courts, each governed by its own jurisdiction's rules, judicial preferences, and funding arrangements. There is no federal authority to mandate standards, only the ability to condition voluntary grant funding.

2. **Political crossfire**: Drug courts occupy an awkward position between law-and-order conservatives (who may view them as "soft on crime") and criminal justice reformers (who may view them as an insufficient alternative to decriminalization). This makes drug courts a political orphan without a strong advocacy base on either side.

3. **Evaluation challenges**: While the aggregate evidence base is strong, individual drug courts vary enormously in quality. Local evaluations are expensive, and many courts lack the data systems or research partnerships needed to evaluate their own performance. This makes it difficult to identify and address underperforming courts.

4. **Stakeholder resistance**: Reforms that would expand eligibility, require MAT access, or shift drug court funding toward pre-arrest diversion face resistance from prosecutors (who lose gatekeeping authority), abstinence-oriented treatment providers (who lose business), and tough-on-crime political actors.

5. **Structural limitation of the model**: Some reform goals -- such as eliminating the requirement for criminal justice contact as a prerequisite for treatment -- are fundamentally incompatible with the drug court model as currently designed. Achieving those goals requires not reforming drug courts but replacing them with alternative structures.
