# Drug Courts: Opposition to Reform

Proposals to reform drug courts face resistance from two distinct directions: those who believe drug courts are already too lenient and those who believe drug courts do not go far enough in removing substance use from the criminal justice framework. This creates an unusual political dynamic in which the drug court model must defend itself against critics on both flanks.

## Who Opposes Reform

### Organized Opposition

| Actor | Interest | Resources | Tactics |
|-------|----------|-----------|---------|
| Tough-on-crime prosecutors and district attorneys | Maintaining charging discretion and adversarial leverage; view expanded eligibility as reducing deterrence | Prosecutorial associations (e.g., National District Attorneys Association), elected office platforms | Blocking eligibility expansion legislation, restricting referrals at the local level, public safety rhetoric |
| Law enforcement unions (FOP, state associations) | Preserving arrest-based enforcement model and staffing levels; asset forfeiture revenue | Political influence, campaign contributions ($6.5 million from police unions in 2022 federal cycle, OpenSecrets) | Lobbying against diversion programs, opposing pre-arrest models, "soft on crime" messaging |
| For-profit drug testing companies | Maintaining mandatory, high-frequency testing requirements | Industry lobby, ~$2 billion annual market | Lobbying against reduced testing protocols, promoting expanded testing panels |
| Abstinence-only treatment providers | Opposing MAT mandates that conflict with their treatment philosophy and business model | Treatment provider associations, faith-based networks | Lobbying against MAT requirements, religious freedom arguments, challenging NADCP standards |
| Private probation and monitoring companies | Maintaining extended court supervision periods that generate fee revenue | Industry lobby, ~$1.2 billion annual revenue | Opposing shortened drug court timelines, promoting electronic monitoring add-ons |
| Criminal justice reform organizations (DPA, some ACLU chapters) | Moving beyond court-based mandated treatment to voluntary community models | Advocacy budgets, legal challenges, public opinion campaigns | Arguing drug courts perpetuate criminal justice control over healthcare, supporting decriminalization |

### Ideological Opposition

- **Law-and-Order Conservative**: Drug courts are "soft on crime." Diversion programs reduce the deterrent effect of criminal sanctions. Drug offenders need punishment, not coddling. Expanded eligibility would let dangerous offenders avoid accountability.
- **Libertarian**: The government should not compel treatment. Drug courts violate individual autonomy by conditioning freedom on compliance with state-mandated programs. The better approach is full decriminalization, not therapeutic state control.
- **Progressive/Abolitionist**: Drug courts extend criminal justice control over people who should never have been arrested in the first place. They medicalize a social problem while maintaining a punitive framework. The correct response is decriminalization, voluntary treatment, and investment in social determinants of health.
- **Religious Right (selective)**: Some faith-based organizations oppose MAT requirements as conflicting with abstinence-based spiritual recovery programs. Others support drug courts as redemptive but resist secularization of treatment components.

## Opposition Arguments and Rebuttals

### Argument 1: Drug Courts Are Soft on Crime

**Claim**: Drug courts let drug offenders avoid punishment. By diverting defendants into treatment instead of jail or prison, drug courts undermine deterrence and send the message that drug crimes have no consequences.

**Evidence Cited**: Individual anecdotes of drug court participants who reoffend; cases where drug court graduates commit subsequent crimes; comparisons of drug court sentences (treatment) to traditional sentences (incarceration).

**Reality**: Drug courts impose extensive requirements -- 12-24 months of supervision, regular drug testing, mandatory treatment attendance, community service, and the threat of incarceration for noncompliance. Participants who fail are returned to traditional prosecution and often receive longer sentences than they would have originally. The MADCE (2012) found that drug court participants spent an average of 11 more days in court-ordered activities than comparison defendants -- drug court is not an easy alternative.

**Rebuttal**: The question is not whether drug courts impose consequences -- they do -- but whether those consequences produce better outcomes. The evidence is clear: drug court participants have a 12 percentage point lower recidivism rate than traditionally processed defendants (40% vs. 52%, MADCE, 2012). Drug courts reduce future crime more effectively than incarceration, which means they make communities safer, not less safe.

### Argument 2: Expanding Eligibility Endangers Public Safety

**Claim**: Allowing individuals with violent offense histories, serious criminal records, or high-risk profiles into drug courts puts communities at risk. Drug courts were designed for low-level, nonviolent offenders and should stay that way.

**Evidence Cited**: Media coverage of crimes committed by defendants on diversion; general public concern about drug-related violence; prosecutor resistance to expanding eligibility.

**Reality**: The MADCE specifically found that drug courts were *most effective* for high-risk/high-need participants. Research published in *Drug Court Review* (Marlowe et al., 2016) demonstrated that restricting drug courts to low-risk defendants actually reduces their cost-effectiveness, because low-risk defendants are unlikely to reoffend regardless of intervention. Jurisdictions that have expanded eligibility to include moderate- and high-risk defendants (e.g., Tulsa County, OK; Hamilton County, OH) have achieved comparable or better outcomes without increased safety incidents.

**Rebuttal**: Evidence-based risk assessment, not categorical exclusion, should guide eligibility. The NADCP Best Practice Standards recommend that drug courts target high-risk/high-need individuals because that is where the model produces the greatest impact. Categorical exclusions based on offense type sacrifice effectiveness for political comfort.

### Argument 3: Drug Courts Extend Criminal Justice Control Over Healthcare

**Claim**: Drug courts perpetuate the criminalization of addiction by requiring arrest and prosecution as prerequisites for treatment. They expand the reach of the criminal justice system into healthcare, using coercion rather than clinical judgment to drive treatment decisions. The correct approach is decriminalization and voluntary, community-based treatment.

**Evidence Cited**: The requirement for criminal charges before drug court entry; coerced guilty pleas; the power imbalance between judges and participants; racial disparities in the criminal justice system that feed drug courts; Oregon Measure 110 as an alternative model.

**Reality**: This critique has substantial merit. Drug courts do require criminal justice contact as a prerequisite for treatment, and this requirement imposes collateral consequences (arrest records, stigma) that a pure public health model would avoid. However, the critique underestimates two practical realities: (1) in the current system, drug courts represent the best available option for defendants who are already in the criminal justice system, and (2) the supervised structure of drug courts produces better treatment retention and completion rates than purely voluntary programs. The average retention rate for voluntary outpatient treatment is approximately 40% at 90 days (SAMHSA TEDS, 2023), compared to 72% at 12 months for drug court participants (NPC Research, 2023).

**Rebuttal**: Drug courts and community-based voluntary treatment are not mutually exclusive. The optimal system includes robust voluntary treatment available before criminal justice contact AND high-quality drug courts for those already in the system. Eliminating drug courts without building adequate community-based alternatives would leave hundreds of thousands of defendants with no treatment pathway. Reform should expand voluntary treatment access while simultaneously improving drug courts for those who need them.

### Argument 4: Drug Courts Perpetuate Racial Disparities

**Claim**: Because drug courts depend on the criminal justice system for referrals, they inherit and reproduce the racial disparities embedded in arrest, prosecution, and plea bargaining. Black and Hispanic defendants are less likely to be referred, less likely to be accepted, and less likely to graduate. Expanding drug courts without addressing upstream racial bias amplifies these disparities.

**Evidence Cited**: Documented disparities in referral, acceptance, and graduation rates (e.g., 64% white graduation vs. 52% Black graduation, NADCP National Survey, 2022); four-to-one racial disparity in drug arrests (ACLU, 2020); prosecutor-controlled referral as a mechanism for racial filtering.

**Reality**: These disparities are real and well-documented. However, eliminating drug courts would not eliminate racial disparities in the criminal justice system -- it would simply return minority defendants to a traditional system that is equally or more biased and offers no treatment alternative. The solution is to reform drug courts to reduce disparities while simultaneously addressing upstream racial bias in arrest and prosecution.

**Rebuttal**: Racial equity should be a mandatory component of drug court design, not a reason to eliminate them. Specific reforms include: removing prosecutor-controlled referral in favor of clinical screening at booking, adopting culturally responsive treatment models, requiring courts to monitor and report outcomes by race, and implementing implicit bias training for all drug court team members. The NADCP Best Practice Standards address equity, but compliance is voluntary and uneven.

### Argument 5: Coerced Treatment Violates Individual Autonomy

**Claim**: People should not be forced to undergo medical treatment as a condition of avoiding incarceration. Coerced treatment undermines patient autonomy, violates the therapeutic relationship, and is ethically incompatible with informed consent. Treatment works best when it is voluntary.

**Evidence Cited**: Medical ethics principles of autonomy and informed consent; ABA Standards on Treatment Courts; studies showing equivalent outcomes for voluntary vs. coerced treatment in some settings.

**Reality**: The ethical concern is legitimate but must be balanced against practical realities. Research on coerced treatment shows mixed but generally positive results. A meta-analysis by Parhar et al. (2008) found that mandated treatment was associated with significant reductions in recidivism, though voluntary treatment may produce slightly larger effects per participant. The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) states that "treatment does not need to be voluntary to be effective" and notes that legal pressure can increase treatment retention.

**Rebuttal**: In the current system, the alternative to coerced treatment is not voluntary treatment -- it is no treatment at all, followed by incarceration. Until voluntary treatment is universally accessible and adequately funded, drug courts provide a pathway to treatment that would otherwise not exist for most participants. The ethical framework should focus on ensuring that coerced treatment is clinically appropriate, evidence-based, and delivered with maximum respect for participant dignity.

### Argument 6: MAT Mandates Violate Treatment Provider Autonomy

**Claim**: Requiring drug courts to allow medication-assisted treatment imposes a one-size-fits-all medical standard that overrides the clinical judgment of treatment providers and the philosophical preferences of faith-based programs. Not all participants need or benefit from MAT.

**Evidence Cited**: Treatment provider objections; 12-step tradition emphasizing abstinence from all substances; individual participant preferences for drug-free recovery.

**Reality**: While it is true that not all participants have opioid use disorder (for which MAT is most relevant), the claim that MAT mandates override clinical judgment inverts the actual problem. The evidence is overwhelming that MAT reduces overdose mortality by 50% or more (Larochelle et al., 2018, *Annals of Internal Medicine*), reduces opioid use, and improves treatment retention. Courts that prohibit MAT are overriding clinical evidence, not complying with it.

**Rebuttal**: MAT mandates do not require every participant to take medication -- they require that medication be *available* to those who need it. No participant should be denied access to the most effective treatment for their condition because a court or treatment provider has a philosophical objection to pharmacotherapy. This is a patient safety issue, not a matter of treatment philosophy.

## Historical Patterns of Opposition

Opposition to drug courts has evolved through distinct phases:

- **1989-2000 (Skepticism)**: Critics questioned whether courts should be involved in treatment at all. Prosecutors and judges initially resisted the nonadversarial model as incompatible with judicial function.
- **2000-2012 (Effectiveness Debate)**: As drug courts expanded, opposition focused on whether they actually worked. The accumulation of evidence -- particularly the MADCE and the Campbell meta-analysis -- largely resolved this debate.
- **2012-2020 (Quality and Equity)**: Opposition shifted to the quality and equity of drug courts. Critics on the left focused on racial disparities and coerced treatment. Critics on the right focused on eligibility expansion and MAT mandates.
- **2020-Present (Structural Critique)**: The decriminalization movement and the fentanyl crisis have intensified the debate about whether drug courts represent the right model or an outdated one. Opposition is now structural: should substance use be processed through courts at all?

## Counter-Strategies

### Political Strategies

- **Build bipartisan coalitions around cost savings**: Drug courts are one of the few criminal justice programs supported by both the Heritage Foundation and the Center for American Progress. Emphasizing the $2-$27 return on investment appeals across ideological lines.
- **Leverage the opioid crisis**: The fentanyl epidemic has created political urgency for treatment-based approaches. Drug court advocates can frame expansion as an emergency public health response, not a "soft on crime" policy.
- **Engage veterans**: Veterans treatment courts have the broadest bipartisan support. Positioning drug court expansion alongside veterans court funding increases political viability.

### Communication Strategies

- **Lead with public safety data**: Frame drug courts as a public safety tool that reduces crime more effectively than incarceration. The 12 percentage point recidivism reduction is a compelling safety argument.
- **Use participant stories responsibly**: Graduation ceremony testimonials are powerful but should be paired with systemic data to avoid reliance on anecdote.
- **Acknowledge limitations honestly**: Drug court advocates strengthen their credibility by acknowledging equity concerns, MAT gaps, and scalability challenges rather than presenting the model as perfect.

### Policy Design Strategies

- **Decouple eligibility from prosecutor discretion**: Shift to clinical screening at booking to reduce the influence of prosecutorial gatekeeping and reduce racial bias in referral.
- **Mandate equity reporting**: Require all drug courts receiving federal funds to report outcomes disaggregated by race, ethnicity, gender, and income.
- **Create a pre-arrest diversion track**: Offer drug courts as one option within a broader continuum that includes pre-arrest diversion, reducing the critique that courts require criminal processing.
- **Grandfather abstinence-only providers**: Allow existing providers a transition period to incorporate MAT, reducing the abruptness of mandate-driven change.
