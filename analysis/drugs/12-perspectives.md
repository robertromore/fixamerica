# Drug Policy: Political Perspectives Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes U.S. drug policy through nine distinct political perspectives, evaluating current state assessments, root cause analyses, proposed solutions, and legislation. Few policy domains generate as much cross-ideological tension as drug policy, which sits at the intersection of criminal justice, public health, individual liberty, morality, and racial justice. The fundamental question -- whether the government should treat drug use as a crime, a health condition, a personal choice, or a sin -- generates sharply different answers depending on one's political philosophy.

The analysis in the parent-level drug policy files concludes that the War on Drugs has failed by its own metrics, that the criminalization framework is the primary structural cause of policy failure, and that a public health approach -- anchored in treatment expansion, harm reduction, evidence-based prevention, scheduling reform, and pharmaceutical accountability -- would produce better outcomes. Each perspective is evaluated on the degree to which it agrees with these assessments and the proposed solutions, including the four major bills proposed in the legislation chapter: the Comprehensive Drug Policy Reform Act, the Drug Scheduling Modernization Act, the Harm Reduction Access Act, and the Sentencing Reform and Equity Act.

## Perspective Definitions

| Perspective | Core Values | Policy Orientation |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Tradition, limited government, individual responsibility | Incremental change, fiscal restraint, market solutions |
| Liberal | Progress, equality, social responsibility | Government as problem-solver, regulation, safety nets |
| Progressive | Systemic change, economic justice, structural reform | Transformative reform, wealth redistribution, worker power |
| Libertarian | Individual liberty, minimal state, free markets | Deregulation, privatization, voluntary association |
| Constitutionalist | Original intent, enumerated powers, federalism | Strict constitutional limits, states' rights |
| Populist | Anti-elite, pro-worker, economic nationalism | Trade protection, anti-monopoly, immigration restriction |
| Centrist | Pragmatism, compromise, incremental progress | Bipartisan solutions, evidence-based policy |
| Religious Right | Faith-based values, traditional morality | Social conservatism, religious liberty |
| Democratic Socialist | Worker ownership, public goods, democratic control | Public investment, labor rights, universal programs |

## Scoring Framework

### Position Scores (1-10)

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 10 | Full agreement with project analysis |
| 7-9 | Substantial to strong agreement |
| 5-6 | Mixed/moderate agreement |
| 3-4 | Substantial disagreement |
| 1-2 | Strong opposition |

### Engagement Consistency (1-5)

This metric assesses how reliably a perspective's stated positions align with its underlying principles, and how stable those positions are when concerns are addressed. Higher scores indicate more predictable negotiating partners.

| Level | Label | Indicators |
|-------|-------|------------|
| 5 | Highly Consistent | Stated positions reflect underlying principles; positions stable when concerns addressed |
| 4 | Mostly Consistent | Principles generally align with positions; minor strategic flexibility |
| 3 | Mixed Consistency | Some positions principled, others reflect coalition pressures or unstated concerns |
| 2 | Low Consistency | Positions shift frequently; stated concerns differ from underlying priorities |
| 1 | Unpredictable | Positions appear driven primarily by opposition dynamics rather than principles |

**Coalition-Building Considerations:**

- Alignment gap: When stated concerns differ from underlying priorities, addressing stated concerns may not secure support
- Position stability: Perspectives with shifting positions require ongoing negotiation
- Principle consistency: Perspectives that apply principles uniformly are more predictable partners
- Internal diversity: Some perspectives contain factions with different priorities

## Perspective Analyses

### Conservative Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | States opposition to drug use stems from public safety and moral concerns, but historically has prioritized punitive enforcement over evidence-based approaches that would better serve those goals |
| Principle consistency | Inconsistent application of limited government principles -- favors government restraint in economic regulation but expansive government power in drug enforcement |
| Goalpost stability | Has shifted significantly since the opioid crisis, becoming more open to treatment-based approaches when constituents are directly affected |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate -- willing to support treatment expansion (First Step Act) but often conditions support on maintaining enforcement apparatus |

**Justification:** The conservative position on drug policy has undergone meaningful evolution since the opioid crisis disproportionately affected rural, white, Republican-voting communities. The First Step Act (2018), signed by President Trump with Koch network support, demonstrated genuine willingness to reform sentencing. However, core inconsistency remains: conservatives apply limited-government principles selectively, opposing government regulation of markets while supporting aggressive government regulation of personal drug use. The shift toward treatment acceptance has been real but conditional -- more sympathetic to opioid addiction framed as a medical condition in rural communities than to crack or heroin addiction in urban communities.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- First Step Act of 2018 (Pub. L. 115-391): Bipartisan sentencing reform with strong conservative support, particularly from the Koch-funded Justice Action Network
- Heritage Foundation policy brief, "A Conservative Case for Criminal Justice Reform" (2015): Argued that mass incarceration for drug offenses is fiscally irresponsible and inconsistent with limited government
- Republican support for the SUPPORT Act (2018), which expanded MAT and naloxone access, driven by opioid crisis impact on Republican districts

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Agrees that overdose deaths are a crisis and that the opioid epidemic requires action, but disputes the framing that the War on Drugs has "failed" -- argues enforcement has prevented worse outcomes and that fentanyl trafficking from Mexico and China is the primary problem requiring stronger border and supply-side responses |
| Root Cause Agreement | 3/10 | Strongly disagrees with the analysis that criminalization itself is a root cause. Attributes drug problems primarily to moral and cultural decline, family breakdown, open borders, and insufficient enforcement. Agrees that pharmaceutical companies bear responsibility for the opioid crisis but frames this as corporate misconduct rather than structural regulatory failure |

**Source references:**

- American Enterprise Institute, "The Opioid Crisis: Federal Spending, State Responses" (2023): Favors treatment investment while maintaining enforcement
- National Review, editorial positions on drug policy (2020-2025): Supports sentencing reform and treatment but opposes decriminalization

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Drug Scheduling Reform | 4/10 | Opposes transferring authority from DEA to independent body; supports narrow cannabis rescheduling | Loss of law enforcement control; concern that science-based scheduling leads to broad legalization |
| Harm Reduction Expansion | 3/10 | Supports naloxone distribution; opposes supervised consumption sites and syringe services as "enabling drug use" | Moral objection to any approach perceived as facilitating drug use; concern about community impact of harm reduction facilities |
| Treatment System Transformation | 7/10 | Strongly supports expanding treatment, especially faith-based and abstinence-oriented programs; supports MAT reluctantly | Prefers treatment models emphasizing personal responsibility and recovery over chronic disease management; concerned about indefinite MAT as "substituting one drug for another" |
| Sentencing Reform / Decriminalization | 4/10 | Supports some sentencing reform (First Step Act model); strongly opposes decriminalization of all drugs | Views criminal penalties as necessary deterrent; concerns about public safety and social messaging |
| Federal Cannabis Legalization | 4/10 | Split -- younger conservatives increasingly supportive; older conservatives oppose. Favors states' rights approach | Gateway drug concerns; impact on youth; enforcement complications; moral opposition |
| Pharmaceutical Accountability | 7/10 | Strongly supports holding pharmaceutical companies accountable for opioid crisis | Populist anger at corporate malfeasance; desire to protect communities from predatory marketing |
| Prevention Investment | 7/10 | Supports prevention programs, especially faith-based and community-based models | Skeptical of government-run programs; prefers community and church-based alternatives |
| International Drug Policy Reform | 3/10 | Favors stronger border enforcement and supply interdiction; opposes reducing international supply-side spending | Views drug trafficking as national security threat; favors aggressive action against cartels and source countries |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Comprehensive Drug Policy Reform Act | 4/10 | Supports treatment expansion and settlement fund governance; opposes budget rebalancing mandates and OPC authorization | Concern about weakening enforcement; opposition to supervised consumption sites; resistance to federal spending mandates |
| Drug Scheduling Modernization Act | 3/10 | Opposes transfer of scheduling authority from DEA; may support streamlined research exemptions | Institutional loyalty to DEA; concern about "slippery slope" toward broad legalization |
| Harm Reduction Access Act | 3/10 | Supports naloxone provisions; opposes OPC authorization and syringe service expansion | Moral opposition to "enabling" drug use; concern about community impact |
| Sentencing Reform and Equity Act | 5/10 | Supports some mandatory minimum reform (First Step Act expansion); opposes full decriminalization and voting rights restoration | Concerns about public safety; opposition to "soft on crime" perception; resistance to automatic expungement |

#### Alternative Proposals

- **Strengthen border enforcement and interdiction** to disrupt fentanyl trafficking from Mexico and precursor chemicals from China, including military deployment if necessary
- **Expand drug courts** as the primary alternative to incarceration, requiring treatment participation under judicial supervision with sanctions for noncompliance
- **Invest in faith-based and abstinence-oriented recovery programs** through community and religious organizations rather than government-run treatment systems
- **Hold pharmaceutical executives personally criminally liable** for deceptive marketing of addictive drugs
- **Maintain but reform the scheduling system** within the DEA framework, allowing narrow research exemptions while preserving law enforcement authority
- **Support state-level cannabis decisions** without federal legalization -- let states experiment but do not endorse federal descheduling

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Religious Right (shared moral framework, support for faith-based recovery), Populist (shared anger at pharmaceutical companies and drug cartels)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (treatment expansion, sentencing reform, pharmaceutical accountability), Libertarian (limited government framing for some reforms, states' rights on cannabis)
- **Unlikely partners:** Progressive (fundamental disagreement on criminalization, racial equity framing), Democratic Socialist (disagreement on structural causes and scope of government role)

---

### Liberal Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine commitment to public health approach and racial equity, supported by consistent voting patterns and policy advocacy |
| Principle consistency | Generally consistent application of government-as-problem-solver framework; some tension between criminal justice reform rhetoric and support for pharmaceutical industry regulation |
| Goalpost stability | Positions have moved steadily toward reform over two decades, from supporting the 1994 crime bill to championing decriminalization |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low -- generally willing to incorporate enforcement elements (targeting traffickers) alongside public health approaches |

**Justification:** The liberal perspective on drug policy has demonstrated consistent evolution toward a public health model, driven by accumulating evidence and racial justice advocacy. Liberals have been relatively willing to update positions based on evidence (e.g., moving from crack sentencing support in the 1990s to championing the Fair Sentencing Act and First Step Act). The main inconsistency is the reluctance of some liberal politicians to fully embrace decriminalization or legalization due to electoral calculations, even as the policy positions of liberal think tanks and advocates have moved further.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Democratic Party platform (2024): Explicitly endorses treating addiction as a public health issue, expanding treatment, cannabis rescheduling, and addressing racial disparities in enforcement
- The Fair Sentencing Act (2010, Pub. L. 111-220): Reduced the crack/powder disparity from 100:1 to 18:1, championed by liberal legislators
- Obama administration's expansion of naloxone access, the 21st Century Cures Act, and the shift toward "drug policy reform" language at ONDCP

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Substantially agrees with the analysis that drug policy has failed, that overdose deaths represent a public health crisis, and that racial disparities in enforcement are unacceptable. May disagree on some details -- some liberals still support maintaining some criminal penalties for possession |
| Root Cause Agreement | 7/10 | Agrees that the criminalization framework is a core problem, that pharmaceutical industry misconduct caused the opioid crisis, and that racial animus has shaped drug policy. May place less emphasis on structural economic critique and more on specific policy failures and regulatory gaps |

**Source references:**

- Center for American Progress, "Ending the War on Drugs" (2023): Comprehensive policy framework closely aligned with the project analysis
- Brookings Institution, "A New Approach to Drug Policy" (2022): Evidence-based framework emphasizing treatment and harm reduction

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Drug Scheduling Reform | 7/10 | Supports rescheduling cannabis; cautiously supports independent scheduling body; wants to maintain FDA role | Concern about loss of regulatory oversight; preference for incremental rescheduling rather than wholesale reform |
| Harm Reduction Expansion | 8/10 | Strongly supports naloxone, syringe services, and fentanyl test strips; growing support for supervised consumption sites | Political risk of supervised consumption sites; concern about community opposition |
| Treatment System Transformation | 9/10 | Strongly supports treatment on demand, MAT expansion, insurance parity enforcement, and workforce investment | Concern about cost and implementation timeline; preference for government-administered programs |
| Sentencing Reform / Decriminalization | 7/10 | Supports ending mandatory minimums, cannabis expungement, and removing collateral consequences; cautious on full decriminalization | Electoral vulnerability on "soft on crime" framing; Oregon experience creates caution about full decriminalization |
| Federal Cannabis Legalization | 8/10 | Strongly supports with social equity provisions and expungement | Concerns about cannabis industry corporatization; desire for strong regulatory framework |
| Pharmaceutical Accountability | 9/10 | Strongly supports all accountability measures, including criminal prosecution, settlement fund governance, and FDA reform | Desire for comprehensive accountability may delay narrower achievable reforms |
| Prevention Investment | 8/10 | Strongly supports evidence-based prevention funding; opposes D.A.R.E. and ineffective abstinence-only programs | Concern about adequate implementation and equitable distribution of prevention resources |
| International Drug Policy Reform | 7/10 | Supports shifting from supply-side to demand reduction and development assistance; supports precursor chemical controls | Concern about abandoning international partners; desire to maintain some interdiction capacity |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Comprehensive Drug Policy Reform Act | 8/10 | Supports all major provisions; may seek stronger treatment quality standards and larger appropriations | Concern that authorized funding levels are insufficient; desire for stronger enforcement mechanisms for insurance parity |
| Drug Scheduling Modernization Act | 7/10 | Supports independent commission concept; wants strong conflict-of-interest provisions | Concern about political manipulation of appointments; desire for guaranteed cannabis reclassification |
| Harm Reduction Access Act | 8/10 | Strongly supports naloxone provisions, syringe service expansion, and fentanyl test strip legalization; supports OPC authorization | Political risk of OPC authorization; concern about community opposition processes |
| Sentencing Reform and Equity Act | 8/10 | Supports elimination of mandatory minimums, crack/powder parity, expungement, and collateral consequence removal | Constitutional concerns about voting rights provision; desire for compensation for unjust incarceration |

#### Alternative Proposals

- **Comprehensive criminal justice reform** that addresses drug enforcement within broader policing and sentencing reform
- **Universal addiction treatment coverage** through expansion of Medicaid and strengthened insurance parity, making SUD treatment available as a standard healthcare benefit
- **Community reinvestment** using cannabis tax revenue and opioid settlement funds to invest in communities most harmed by the War on Drugs
- **Restorative justice programs** for drug offenses that focus on community healing rather than punishment
- **International human rights approach** to drug policy that centers harm reduction and development assistance

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive (shared public health and racial equity framework), Centrist (treatment expansion, evidence-based approaches)
- **Potential bridges:** Conservative (treatment expansion, pharmaceutical accountability, settlement fund governance), Libertarian (cannabis legalization, decriminalization)
- **Unlikely partners:** Religious Right (fundamental disagreement on harm reduction, morality-based framing)

### Progressive Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine commitment to dismantling the War on Drugs and addressing racial injustice; positions consistently reflect stated principles |
| Principle consistency | Highly consistent application of structural critique across drug policy, criminal justice, and economic justice |
| Goalpost stability | Positions have been stable and have moved mainstream opinion over time -- decriminalization, harm reduction, and racial equity framing were progressive positions before becoming liberal ones |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate -- may resist incremental reforms as insufficient, potentially blocking achievable progress |

**Justification:** The progressive perspective on drug policy is among the most internally consistent of any political tradition on this issue. Progressives have consistently argued that the War on Drugs is a system of racial control, that addiction is a health condition requiring treatment not punishment, and that corporate accountability for the opioid crisis is essential. The main weakness is a tendency to reject incremental reforms as inadequate, which can paradoxically slow progress. Progressives may also understate the role of individual choice and cultural factors in drug use, focusing heavily on structural explanations.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Drug Policy Alliance and Human Rights Watch advocacy positions: Consistent advocacy for decriminalization, harm reduction, and racial equity since the early 2000s
- Congressional Progressive Caucus positions on the MORE Act and cannabis social equity legislation
- Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez policy platforms calling for end to the War on Drugs and full decriminalization

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strongly agrees with the analysis of drug policy failure, overdose crisis, treatment gap, and racial disparities. May argue the analysis understates the structural racism embedded in the system and the degree to which drug policy functions as social control |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | Strongly agrees with the structural analysis of criminalization, pharmaceutical industry culpability, and racial targeting. Adds emphasis on economic inequality, poverty, and lack of social safety nets as root causes of both drug use and policy failure |

**Source references:**

- Drug Policy Alliance, "Drug Decriminalization in Action" (2023): Comprehensive evidence for decriminalization
- Sentencing Project, "The Color of Justice: Racial and Ethnic Disparity in State Prisons" (2024): Documents racial disparities in drug enforcement

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Drug Scheduling Reform | 8/10 | Strongly supports independent scheduling body and evidence-based criteria; advocates for cannabis descheduling | Wants broader reform beyond scheduling -- restructuring the entire drug regulatory framework |
| Harm Reduction Expansion | 10/10 | Fully supports all harm reduction measures including supervised consumption sites, safe supply programs, and drug checking | Concerned that harm reduction alone does not address root causes of addiction (poverty, trauma, inequality) |
| Treatment System Transformation | 9/10 | Strongly supports treatment on demand, MAT expansion, and workforce investment; advocates for universal publicly funded treatment | Prefers public treatment system over private/market-based approaches; concerned about treatment industry profiteering |
| Sentencing Reform / Decriminalization | 10/10 | Supports full decriminalization of personal possession, elimination of all mandatory minimums, comprehensive expungement, and reparations for communities harmed by drug enforcement | Views anything less than full decriminalization as perpetuating racial injustice |
| Federal Cannabis Legalization | 9/10 | Strongly supports with robust social equity, small business protections, community reinvestment, and corporate consolidation prevention | Concerned about cannabis industry being captured by large corporations that exclude communities most harmed by prohibition |
| Pharmaceutical Accountability | 10/10 | Supports all accountability measures; advocates for public pharmaceutical manufacturing and price controls beyond what is proposed | Views pharmaceutical accountability as part of broader corporate accountability agenda |
| Prevention Investment | 8/10 | Supports evidence-based prevention; emphasizes addressing social determinants (poverty, housing, education) as the most effective prevention | Skeptical of prevention programs that focus on individual behavior change without addressing structural conditions |
| International Drug Policy Reform | 9/10 | Supports ending supply-side interventions, ending crop eradication, reforming UN drug treaties, and centering human rights and development | Views U.S. international drug policy as neo-colonial; advocates for reparative approach to countries harmed by the War on Drugs |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Comprehensive Drug Policy Reform Act | 7/10 | Supports as a foundation but argues it does not go far enough -- should include personal possession decriminalization and stronger budget rebalancing targets | Concern that 55/65% demand reduction allocation still devotes too much to enforcement |
| Drug Scheduling Modernization Act | 8/10 | Supports independent commission and evidence-based criteria; wants guaranteed cannabis descheduling | Concern that Commission could be captured by appointees; prefers statutory descheduling of cannabis |
| Harm Reduction Access Act | 9/10 | Strongly supports all provisions; advocates for adding safe supply pilot programs | Wants more aggressive funding levels and mandatory (not opt-in) harm reduction infrastructure |
| Sentencing Reform and Equity Act | 8/10 | Supports all provisions; advocates for adding compensation for unjust incarceration and broader expungement | Wants full decriminalization of personal possession, not just sentencing reform for those convicted |

#### Alternative Proposals

- **Full drug decriminalization** with mandatory investment in treatment, harm reduction, and social services -- the Portugal model with significantly greater social safety net investment
- **Public pharmaceutical manufacturing** of addiction treatment medications (buprenorphine, naloxone, methadone) to eliminate profit motive and reduce costs
- **Community reparations fund** dedicated to neighborhoods most devastated by War on Drugs enforcement, funded by cannabis tax revenue, opioid settlements, and redirected enforcement spending
- **Universal basic services** (housing, healthcare, income support) as the most effective drug prevention strategy
- **Abolition of the DEA** or fundamental restructuring as a public health agency rather than law enforcement body
- **International reparations** to countries harmed by U.S.-led drug war, including Colombia, Mexico, and Afghanistan

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Democratic Socialist (shared structural critique, public health framework, anti-corporate stance), Liberal (shared reform goals, though progressives push further)
- **Potential bridges:** Libertarian (decriminalization, anti-prohibitionist philosophy, DEA critique), Populist (anti-pharmaceutical-company sentiment)
- **Unlikely partners:** Religious Right (fundamental disagreement on morality framing, harm reduction), Conservative (disagreement on criminalization, structural racism analysis)

---

### Libertarian Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 5/5 - Highly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Principled and transparent opposition to drug prohibition based on individual liberty and limited government -- the same principles applied to all policy domains |
| Principle consistency | Highly consistent -- opposes government regulation of personal drug use just as it opposes government regulation of other personal choices. Does not carve out exceptions for politically convenient substances |
| Goalpost stability | Position has been stable for decades -- the Libertarian Party has supported drug legalization since its founding in 1971 |
| Zero-sum behavior | Very low -- willing to support any reform that moves toward less government intervention, regardless of source |

**Justification:** The libertarian perspective on drug policy is the most internally consistent of any political tradition. Libertarians apply the same principles -- individual sovereignty, government as the servant of the individual rather than the reverse, skepticism of enforcement -- to drug policy that they apply to economic regulation, gun rights, and civil liberties. Their position predates the current reform movement by decades. The Cato Institute published Glenn Greenwald's influential analysis of Portuguese decriminalization in 2009, and libertarian organizations have been consistent allies in drug policy reform. The main limitation is that pure libertarian anti-government principles may resist public health infrastructure (treatment systems, harm reduction programs) that require government funding and administration.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Libertarian Party platform (2024): "We favor the repeal of all laws creating 'crimes' without victims, such as the use of drugs for medicinal or recreational purposes"
- Cato Institute, "Drug Decriminalization in Portugal" (2009): Influential research supporting decriminalization
- Koch-funded Justice Action Network: Supported the First Step Act and continues to advocate for sentencing reform

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 7/10 | Agrees that the War on Drugs has failed, that prohibition creates black markets and violence, and that enforcement has been racially disparate. Disagrees with the implicit assumption that government-run treatment and harm reduction programs are the appropriate alternative -- prefers market and voluntary solutions |
| Root Cause Agreement | 6/10 | Strongly agrees that criminalization and prohibition are root causes. Agrees that pharmaceutical company misconduct is a problem but frames it as government regulatory failure (FDA approvals, DEA distribution quotas) rather than market failure. Disagrees with structural/systemic framing that implies more government intervention is needed |

**Source references:**

- Reason Foundation, drug policy coverage: Consistent reporting on drug enforcement failures and reform successes

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Drug Scheduling Reform | 6/10 | Supports reducing DEA authority but opposes creating a new government commission -- prefers eliminating scheduling entirely or allowing FDA-only oversight | Opposes any new government body; prefers removing government from drug classification |
| Harm Reduction Expansion | 5/10 | Supports legalizing harm reduction tools (test strips, syringes) but opposes federal funding of harm reduction programs -- should be privately funded | Opposes government spending on programs; supports removing legal barriers |
| Treatment System Transformation | 4/10 | Supports removing regulatory barriers to treatment (methadone pharmacy dispensing, telehealth) but opposes government-funded treatment expansion and insurance mandates | Opposes government spending and mandates; prefers market-driven treatment solutions |
| Sentencing Reform / Decriminalization | 9/10 | Strongly supports full decriminalization and legalization of all drugs; supports ending mandatory minimums and expungement | Would go further than the analysis -- supports full legalization, not just decriminalization |
| Federal Cannabis Legalization | 10/10 | Strongly supports descheduling; opposes heavy federal regulation (marketing restrictions, social equity mandates) as creating new government bureaucracy | Supports legalization but opposes the regulatory framework proposed -- wants minimal regulation |
| Pharmaceutical Accountability | 4/10 | Supports using existing fraud and tort law against pharmaceutical companies; opposes new regulatory bodies and FDA expansion | Views pharmaceutical misconduct as enabled by government (FDA approval process, patent system) rather than requiring more government |
| Prevention Investment | 3/10 | Opposes government-funded prevention programs; supports private and community-based prevention | Opposes all government spending on prevention; views it as government overreach into parenting and education |
| International Drug Policy Reform | 8/10 | Strongly supports ending international supply-side spending, crop eradication, and military/police assistance | Opposes foreign aid generally; supports non-interventionist foreign policy |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Comprehensive Drug Policy Reform Act | 3/10 | Opposes the massive federal spending ($19+ billion annually); supports specific provisions removing regulatory barriers (OPC authorization, syringe service legalization) | Fundamental opposition to large government programs; supports deregulatory elements only |
| Drug Scheduling Modernization Act | 5/10 | Supports reducing DEA scheduling authority; opposes creating new government commission | Prefers eliminating scheduling system entirely over reforming it |
| Harm Reduction Access Act | 6/10 | Supports all legal protections (OPC authorization, paraphernalia exemptions, test strip legalization); opposes grant programs and federal spending | Supports removing legal barriers; opposes funding programs |
| Sentencing Reform and Equity Act | 8/10 | Strongly supports mandatory minimum elimination, expungement, and removal of collateral consequences; supports crack/powder parity | Supports all provisions reducing government power over individuals; may oppose voting rights provision as federal overreach into state elections |

#### Alternative Proposals

- **Full drug legalization** -- not just decriminalization but removal of all criminal and civil penalties for drug production, sale, and use, with market regulation no more extensive than that applied to alcohol
- **Elimination of the DEA** and the scheduling system, returning drug regulation to the FDA for safety (not prohibition) purposes only
- **Tort liability reform** as the primary accountability mechanism for pharmaceutical misconduct, rather than new regulatory bodies
- **Tax-funded voucher system** for addiction treatment if any public funding is deemed necessary, allowing individuals to choose private treatment providers
- **End all foreign drug war spending** and redirect to deficit reduction or tax cuts
- **Eliminate FDA pre-market approval** for addiction treatment medications, relying on post-market liability and information disclosure

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive (shared anti-prohibitionist stance on decriminalization/legalization), Constitutionalist (shared federalism and limited government principles)
- **Potential bridges:** Conservative (limited government framing, states' rights on cannabis), Liberal (cannabis legalization, sentencing reform, civil liberties)
- **Unlikely partners:** Religious Right (fundamental disagreement on government's role in enforcing moral standards), Democratic Socialist (fundamental disagreement on role of government in healthcare and treatment)

---

### Constitutionalist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine focus on constitutional structure, enumerated powers, and federalism; positions flow logically from these principles |
| Principle consistency | Mostly consistent -- applies federalism principles to drug policy by favoring state authority, but sometimes inconsistent when federal enforcement aligns with conservative cultural preferences |
| Goalpost stability | Stable on structural questions (federalism, enumerated powers); more variable on specific drug policies |
| Zero-sum behavior | Low -- willing to support federalism-based solutions that allow different states to pursue different approaches |

**Justification:** The constitutionalist perspective offers a distinctive structural critique of federal drug policy. The constitutional case against broad federal drug prohibition is stronger than commonly recognized: the Commerce Clause has been stretched considerably to support federal drug enforcement, and the original War on Drugs (alcohol prohibition) required a constitutional amendment (the 18th Amendment) -- suggesting the framers would have expected the same for drug prohibition. Constitutionalists are mostly consistent in applying federalism principles, though some who identify as constitutionalists selectively invoke states' rights for drug enforcement while supporting federal power for border control and trafficking enforcement.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Justice Clarence Thomas, dissent in *Gonzales v. Raich* (2005): Argued that Congress's Commerce Clause power does not extend to regulating intrastate cultivation of cannabis for personal medical use
- Federalist Society drug policy scholarship: Emphasizes enumerated powers and federalism concerns with the Controlled Substances Act
- State sovereignty movement: Multiple states have asserted authority to legalize cannabis in defiance of federal law

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Agrees that the federal government has overreached in drug policy and that the federal-state cannabis conflict is constitutionally problematic. Less interested in public health metrics and more focused on structural and constitutional analysis. Views the CSA as a potentially unconstitutional exercise of Commerce Clause power |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | Agrees that federal overreach and the concentration of power in the DEA are structural problems, but frames root causes in terms of constitutional structure rather than public health, racial equity, or pharmaceutical industry conduct. The root cause is Congress exceeding its enumerated powers, not the specific policy outcomes |

- Tenth Amendment Center, "The Federal War on Drugs" (2023): Argues the Controlled Substances Act exceeds Congress's enumerated powers

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Drug Scheduling Reform | 5/10 | Supports reducing federal scheduling authority; prefers returning drug regulation to states rather than creating a new federal commission | Opposes creating new federal bodies; prefers eliminating or narrowing federal authority |
| Harm Reduction Expansion | 4/10 | Supports states' right to implement harm reduction programs; opposes federal funding mandates and nationwide standing orders | Views harm reduction as a state decision; opposes federal preemption of state paraphernalia laws |
| Treatment System Transformation | 4/10 | Supports removing federal barriers to treatment but opposes large federal treatment programs; prefers state-administered systems | Opposes expansion of federal healthcare role; views treatment as a state responsibility |
| Sentencing Reform / Decriminalization | 6/10 | Supports reforming federal drug sentencing; strongly supports returning drug possession policy to states | Prefers eliminating federal drug possession crimes entirely rather than decriminalizing them |
| Federal Cannabis Legalization | 7/10 | Supports descheduling cannabis from the CSA, returning regulation entirely to states; opposes new federal regulatory framework | Wants to reduce federal authority, not create new federal regulatory structure for cannabis |
| Pharmaceutical Accountability | 4/10 | Supports using existing legal frameworks (fraud, tort) but opposes creating new federal regulatory agencies or expanding FDA authority | Opposes expansion of federal regulatory power |
| Prevention Investment | 3/10 | Opposes large federal prevention programs; supports state-administered prevention | Tenth Amendment concerns about federal role in education and prevention |
| International Drug Policy Reform | 5/10 | Supports reducing foreign drug war spending; mixed on treaty reform (some constitutionalists view treaties as binding) | Treaty Clause questions about UN drug control conventions |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Comprehensive Drug Policy Reform Act | 3/10 | Opposes most provisions as expansion of federal authority; supports narrowing the CSA | Views the bill as creating large new federal programs without clear constitutional authorization |
| Drug Scheduling Modernization Act | 5/10 | Supports reducing DEA authority but opposes creating new independent federal commission | Prefers returning scheduling authority to states or eliminating the scheduling system |
| Harm Reduction Access Act | 4/10 | Supports OPC authorization (allowing states to act) but opposes federal spending programs and preemption of state paraphernalia laws | Federalism concerns about federal preemption; opposes unfunded federal mandates |
| Sentencing Reform and Equity Act | 6/10 | Supports federal sentencing reform and mandatory minimum elimination; opposes voting rights provision as exceeding federal authority | States should determine their own voting eligibility rules; 14th Amendment enforcement power is limited |

#### Alternative Proposals

- **Repeal or narrowly reinterpret the Controlled Substances Act** to apply only to interstate trafficking, returning drug possession and personal use regulation to the states under the Tenth Amendment
- **Constitutional amendment** explicitly defining the scope of federal drug authority (as the 18th and 21st Amendments did for alcohol)
- **State compact approach** allowing states to establish regional drug policy frameworks without federal interference
- **Sunset clause** for all existing federal drug laws, requiring Congress to re-authorize specific provisions rather than maintaining broad prohibitory authority by default
- **Reduce federal drug enforcement** to border interdiction and interstate trafficking only, leaving all intrastate drug policy to the states

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Libertarian (shared federalism and limited government principles), Conservative (some overlap on limited government)
- **Potential bridges:** Progressive (agreement on reducing federal enforcement power, though for different reasons), Populist (states' rights framing)
- **Unlikely partners:** Liberal (disagreement on role of federal government in expanding treatment and harm reduction), Democratic Socialist (fundamental disagreement on federal government's role)

### Populist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 2/5 - Low Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | States concern for working-class communities devastated by drugs, but policy positions oscillate between punitive enforcement and anti-corporate populism depending on political context |
| Principle consistency | Inconsistent -- simultaneously demands harsh punishment for drug traffickers and drug users while also demanding harsh punishment for pharmaceutical executives who created the opioid crisis |
| Goalpost stability | Positions shift significantly based on which communities are affected and which political leader is framing the issue |
| Zero-sum behavior | High -- tends to frame drug policy as "us vs. them" (hardworking Americans vs. cartels, or working class vs. pharmaceutical elites) rather than seeking systemic solutions |

**Justification:** The populist perspective on drug policy is internally contradictory and highly unstable. Populist leaders simultaneously demand severe punishment for drug dealers and traffickers (including the death penalty), advocate for protecting communities from pharmaceutical industry predators, and resist the public health framing of addiction as a disease. The populist approach is heavily influenced by which demographic group is perceived as the primary victim. When opioid addiction affected rural white communities, populists supported more compassionate approaches; when crack affected urban Black communities, populists supported harsh enforcement. This inconsistency makes populism an unreliable coalition partner, though populist energy against pharmaceutical companies is a genuine and powerful force.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- President Trump's proposal to execute drug dealers (2018, 2024): Extreme punitive approach to trafficking coexisting with support for treatment investment
- Bipartisan populist support for opioid settlement accountability: Both right-populist and left-populist figures demanded pharmaceutical industry accountability
- J.D. Vance (R-OH) advocacy for opioid-affected communities: Combined sympathy for addiction sufferers with support for tough border enforcement and fentanyl trafficking penalties

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 6/10 | Agrees that the opioid and fentanyl crises are devastating working-class communities and that pharmaceutical companies bear major responsibility. Disagrees with the framing that enforcement has failed -- argues enforcement has not been tough enough on traffickers and that open borders are the primary cause of the fentanyl crisis |
| Root Cause Agreement | 4/10 | Strongly agrees that pharmaceutical company misconduct is a root cause. Disagrees with structural/systemic analysis; attributes drug problems to border insecurity, foreign cartels, cultural decline, and weak leadership rather than to the criminalization framework itself |

**Source references:**

- J.D. Vance, "Hillbilly Elegy" (2016) and subsequent policy positions: Populist framing of opioid crisis as working-class devastation requiring both enforcement and compassion
- President Trump, Executive Orders on drug trafficking penalties (2024-2025): Combined harsh enforcement with treatment investment rhetoric

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Drug Scheduling Reform | 3/10 | Opposes weakening enforcement authority; may support narrow cannabis reform if framed as economic opportunity for working-class entrepreneurs | Concern about appearing "soft on drugs"; opposition to expert-led bodies perceived as elite institutions |
| Harm Reduction Expansion | 3/10 | Supports naloxone distribution; opposes supervised consumption sites and syringe services as "enabling" drug use in communities | Concern about harm reduction facilities in working-class neighborhoods; moral opposition to perceived permissiveness |
| Treatment System Transformation | 6/10 | Supports treatment expansion for "deserving" populations (opioid-affected workers, veterans); less supportive of universal treatment access | Supports treatment that emphasizes personal transformation and work; opposes treatment perceived as enabling dependency |
| Sentencing Reform / Decriminalization | 3/10 | Supports harsh penalties for traffickers and dealers; opposes decriminalization; may support limited sentencing reform for low-level offenders | Demands "tough on crime" stance; views decriminalization as elite policy disconnected from community reality |
| Federal Cannabis Legalization | 5/10 | Split -- some populists support as working-class economic opportunity; others oppose on cultural/moral grounds | Depends on framing: economic populism (jobs, revenue) vs. cultural conservatism (traditional values) |
| Pharmaceutical Accountability | 10/10 | Strongest possible support for holding pharmaceutical companies and executives criminally liable; supports maximum penalties and restitution | Anti-corporate populism is most authentic and consistent element of populist drug policy |
| Prevention Investment | 6/10 | Supports community-based prevention; skeptical of federal bureaucracy and expert-designed programs | Prefers local control; distrusts elite-designed prevention curricula |
| International Drug Policy Reform | 2/10 | Demands aggressive action against cartels, including potential military intervention; opposes reducing border enforcement or interdiction | Views drug trafficking as existential threat; favors maximum enforcement against foreign suppliers |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Comprehensive Drug Policy Reform Act | 4/10 | Supports settlement fund governance and treatment expansion; opposes OPC authorization and budget rebalancing away from enforcement | Perceives budget rebalancing as weakening enforcement against cartels and traffickers |
| Drug Scheduling Modernization Act | 2/10 | Opposes transferring authority to independent commission; views as elite technocratic capture of policy | Distrusts expert bodies; prefers democratic (legislative) control of drug scheduling |
| Harm Reduction Access Act | 3/10 | Supports naloxone provisions; opposes OPCs, syringe services, and drug checking as "enabling" | Community opposition to harm reduction infrastructure perceived as attracting drug use |
| Sentencing Reform and Equity Act | 3/10 | May support limited sentencing reform; strongly opposes full decriminalization, automatic expungement, and voting rights restoration | Views mandatory minimums as necessary deterrent; opposes what populists frame as "coddling criminals" |

#### Alternative Proposals

- **Death penalty for major drug traffickers** importing fentanyl into the United States
- **Military action against cartels** in Mexico, including designation of cartels as terrorist organizations
- **Seal the border** with comprehensive physical and technological barriers to prevent fentanyl smuggling
- **Criminal prosecution of pharmaceutical executives** -- individual criminal liability, not just corporate fines
- **Worker-centered treatment programs** emphasizing return to employment, with government-subsidized treatment for working families
- **Ban pharmaceutical direct-to-consumer advertising** entirely
- **Community-controlled settlement funds** with direct allocation to affected towns and counties rather than state-level administration

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (shared emphasis on enforcement, border security, cultural values), Religious Right (shared moral framework, community protection)
- **Potential bridges:** Progressive (shared anti-pharmaceutical-corporation anger), Democratic Socialist (shared anti-corporate sentiment, worker protection)
- **Unlikely partners:** Libertarian (fundamental disagreement on enforcement, government intervention), Constitutionalist (disagreement on scope of federal power)

### Centrist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine commitment to evidence-based, pragmatic reform; positions reflect stated preference for "what works" over ideology |
| Principle consistency | Consistent application of evidence-based, bipartisan approach; may sometimes sacrifice principle for political feasibility |
| Goalpost stability | Positions evolve as evidence accumulates, which is a strength for evidence-based policy but makes the centrist perspective a moving target |
| Zero-sum behavior | Very low -- explicitly seeks compromise and coalition-building; willing to accept partial reforms |

**Justification:** The centrist perspective is well-suited to drug policy reform because the evidence base is strong and increasingly bipartisan. Centrists played key roles in the First Step Act, the SUPPORT Act, and state-level cannabis legalization through ballot initiatives. Their strength is pragmatism: willingness to adopt whatever approach works, regardless of ideological origin. Their weakness is a tendency toward incrementalism that may be insufficient given the scale of the crisis (107,000+ overdose deaths annually). Centrists may also overestimate the feasibility of bipartisan compromise on issues like supervised consumption sites or full decriminalization, where ideological differences are genuinely irreconcilable.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Bipartisan Policy Center, drug policy recommendations (2023): Evidence-based framework emphasizing treatment expansion, harm reduction, and pharmaceutical accountability
- Third Way, "A New Approach to Drug Addiction" (2022): Centrist think tank advocating public health approach with maintained enforcement for trafficking
- Bipartisan congressional caucuses on drug policy: First Step Act coalition, bipartisan opioid task forces

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 8/10 | Substantially agrees with the data-driven assessment of the overdose crisis, treatment gap, and policy failures. May place more emphasis on the complexity of drug policy challenges and less on structural critique |
| Root Cause Agreement | 6/10 | Agrees that the current system is ineffective, that pharmaceutical companies bear responsibility for the opioid crisis, and that treatment should be expanded. Less likely to attribute drug policy failure to structural racism or the fundamental design of the criminalization framework -- prefers to describe the problem as "imbalance" rather than "design error" |

#### Solution Evaluations

| Solution | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|----------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Drug Scheduling Reform | 6/10 | Supports evidence-based review of scheduling; cautiously supports rescheduling cannabis to Schedule III; skeptical of full descheduling or eliminating DEA role | Prefers incremental rescheduling over wholesale reform; concern about moving too fast |
| Harm Reduction Expansion | 7/10 | Supports naloxone distribution, fentanyl test strips, and expanded syringe services; cautious on supervised consumption sites | Wants strong evidence base and community buy-in before expanding to controversial interventions |
| Treatment System Transformation | 9/10 | Strongly supports all treatment expansion measures, especially MAT access, workforce investment, and insurance parity | This is the centrist "sweet spot" -- treatment expansion has strong evidence and bipartisan support |
| Sentencing Reform / Decriminalization | 6/10 | Supports sentencing reform, cannabis expungement, and reducing collateral consequences; cautious on full decriminalization | Prefers diversion programs and drug courts over formal decriminalization; concern about Oregon-style implementation failures |
| Federal Cannabis Legalization | 7/10 | Supports banking reform (SAFE Banking Act) and rescheduling; cautiously supports eventual legalization with strong regulatory framework | Prefers incremental approach: banking first, rescheduling next, legalization last |
| Pharmaceutical Accountability | 8/10 | Supports settlement fund governance, FDA reform, and corporate accountability; may resist most aggressive proposals (RICO for pharma) | Supports strong accountability within established legal frameworks; cautious about novel legal theories |
| Prevention Investment | 8/10 | Strongly supports evidence-based prevention programs; opposes funding ineffective programs | Insists on rigorous program evaluation and evidence requirements |
| International Drug Policy Reform | 6/10 | Supports rebalancing international drug spending and precursor chemical controls; cautious about reducing interdiction | Pragmatic about maintaining some supply-side capacity while increasing demand-reduction investment |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Comprehensive Drug Policy Reform Act | 7/10 | Supports treatment expansion, settlement fund governance, and MAT expansion; cautious about OPC authorization and budget mandates | Prefers voluntary incentives over mandated budget rebalancing; wants opt-in approach for controversial measures |
| Drug Scheduling Modernization Act | 6/10 | Supports evidence-based review mechanism; cautious about transferring authority entirely from DEA | Prefers shared authority model (DEA + HHS + advisory commission) over full transfer |
| Harm Reduction Access Act | 7/10 | Supports naloxone, test strip legalization, and syringe service expansion; cautious on OPC authorization | Wants strong evaluation requirements and community engagement provisions |
| Sentencing Reform and Equity Act | 7/10 | Supports mandatory minimum reform, crack/powder parity, and cannabis expungement; cautious on voting rights provision | Prefers incremental sentencing reform building on First Step Act model |

#### Alternative Proposals

- **Build on the First Step Act** with a "Second Step Act" that further reforms sentencing, expands drug courts, and increases treatment funding
- **Federal cannabis rescheduling to Schedule III** as a first step, with eventual descheduling after evaluation period
- **Public-private treatment partnerships** that leverage both government funding and private sector innovation
- **Tiered harm reduction rollout** -- naloxone and test strips first, syringe services next, supervised consumption sites only after rigorous pilot evaluation
- **Bipartisan opioid commission** (modeled on the 9/11 Commission) to evaluate drug policy failures and recommend comprehensive reform
- **International coalition approach** to fentanyl precursor chemical controls through multilateral agreements

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Liberal (shared evidence-based approach, treatment expansion focus), Conservative (bipartisan reform history, First Step Act model)
- **Potential bridges:** Libertarian (shared pragmatism on cannabis, sentencing reform), Populist (pharmaceutical accountability, community treatment)
- **Unlikely partners:** None -- centrists explicitly seek to bridge all perspectives, though full agreement with Progressive or Democratic Socialist proposals is unlikely

---

### Religious Right Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 3/5 - Mixed Consistency**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine moral concern about drug use and addiction, but positions sometimes reflect cultural identity politics rather than consistent moral theology |
| Principle consistency | Inconsistent application of "compassion" principle -- more sympathetic to addiction as a disease when affecting evangelical communities (opioids) than when affecting other communities (crack, methamphetamine) |
| Goalpost stability | Has shifted meaningfully since the opioid crisis, with growing acceptance of treatment and recovery programs, but core opposition to harm reduction and decriminalization remains |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate -- willing to support treatment expansion but often conditions support on moral frameworks (abstinence, faith-based recovery) that conflict with evidence-based approaches |

**Justification:** The Religious Right perspective on drug policy is characterized by genuine moral concern that is inconsistently applied. The evangelical community has a strong tradition of ministry to people with addictions, and faith-based recovery programs (e.g., Celebrate Recovery, Teen Challenge) serve significant populations. The opioid crisis, which devastated many evangelical communities, prompted a meaningful shift toward viewing addiction as a disease requiring compassion and treatment. However, this shift has not been applied consistently: harm reduction measures like supervised consumption sites and syringe exchanges are rejected as "enabling sin," and cannabis legalization is opposed on moral grounds. The tension between compassion for the addicted and moral opposition to drug use creates an inconsistent and sometimes contradictory policy position.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- National Association of Evangelicals, "Compassion and Conviction: Drug Policy" (2019): Called for treating addiction as a health issue while maintaining opposition to legalization
- Celebrate Recovery program: 35,000+ church-based recovery groups demonstrating genuine commitment to helping people with addictions
- Family Research Council positions on drug policy: Opposes legalization and harm reduction while supporting increased treatment and faith-based recovery

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 5/10 | Agrees that addiction is a serious problem and that overdose deaths are a crisis. Disagrees with the framing that drug enforcement has "failed" -- argues that moral decline, family breakdown, and cultural permissiveness are the primary problems, not policy design. Views the opioid crisis through the lens of corporate sin (pharmaceutical greed) and cultural decline (loss of faith, community, and purpose) |
| Root Cause Agreement | 3/10 | Fundamentally disagrees with the structural/systemic framing. Identifies root causes as spiritual: loss of faith and meaning, breakdown of family and community, moral relativism, and cultural permissiveness. Agrees that pharmaceutical companies acted immorally. Disagrees with racial equity framing as the primary analytical lens |

- Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission (Southern Baptist Convention), drug policy positions: Opposes legalization, supports faith-based treatment

| Harm Reduction Expansion | 2/10 | Strongly opposes supervised consumption sites, syringe services, and safe supply programs as "enabling sin"; reluctantly supports naloxone as lifesaving | Moral framework that views harm reduction as facilitating immoral behavior; concern about community impact |
| Treatment System Transformation | 7/10 | Supports treatment expansion, especially faith-based programs; supports funding for Celebrate Recovery and similar programs; ambivalent about MAT (views as "replacing one drug with another") | Prefers abstinence-based and faith-based treatment models; concern about indefinite MAT undermining recovery |
| Sentencing Reform / Decriminalization | 3/10 | Supports limited compassionate sentencing reform; strongly opposes decriminalization | Views criminal penalties as serving deterrent and moral-signaling functions; concern about social messaging |
| Federal Cannabis Legalization | 2/10 | Strongly opposes cannabis legalization on moral and public health grounds | Views cannabis as gateway drug; moral opposition to intoxication; concern about youth access |
| Pharmaceutical Accountability | 8/10 | Strongly supports holding pharmaceutical companies accountable for immoral conduct that caused addiction and death | Frames pharmaceutical misconduct as sin (greed, deception) requiring punishment and restitution |
| Prevention Investment | 8/10 | Strongly supports prevention, especially family-based, church-based, and character education programs | Prefers prevention programs with moral/spiritual component over secular evidence-based-only approaches |
| International Drug Policy Reform | 4/10 | Supports strong enforcement against drug trafficking; supports missionary and development work in drug-affected countries | Supports faith-based development programs in source countries; opposes reducing enforcement |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Comprehensive Drug Policy Reform Act | 4/10 | Supports treatment expansion and settlement fund governance; strongly opposes OPC authorization and harm reduction provisions | Views OPCs and harm reduction as morally unacceptable; supports faith-based recovery funding |
| Drug Scheduling Modernization Act | 2/10 | Opposes transferring scheduling authority; views current system as appropriately restrictive | Concern about scientific body being more permissive than law enforcement body on scheduling |
| Harm Reduction Access Act | 2/10 | Supports naloxone provisions only; opposes all other harm reduction measures | Moral opposition to supervised consumption, syringe distribution, and drug checking |
| Sentencing Reform and Equity Act | 4/10 | Supports limited sentencing reform; opposes full decriminalization, automatic expungement, and voting rights restoration | Supports mercy within a moral framework that maintains consequences for drug offenses |

#### Alternative Proposals

- **Expand faith-based recovery programs** (Celebrate Recovery, Teen Challenge, Salvation Army) with federal funding and recognition as evidence-based alternatives
- **Family strengthening programs** as primary prevention strategy -- marriage counseling, parenting education, community support for at-risk families
- **Abstinence-based treatment** as the gold standard, with MAT as a temporary bridge to abstinence rather than long-term maintenance
- **Character education in schools** that addresses the moral and spiritual dimensions of drug resistance
- **Hold pharmaceutical executives morally and legally accountable** through criminal prosecution and restitution to affected communities
- **Oppose cannabis legalization** at all levels; support enforcement of existing prohibition laws
- **Support church-community partnerships** for prevention and recovery rather than government-run programs

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Conservative (shared moral framework, support for enforcement), Populist (shared anger at pharmaceutical companies, community protection)
- **Potential bridges:** Centrist (treatment expansion, pharmaceutical accountability), Liberal (limited common ground on treatment investment)
- **Unlikely partners:** Libertarian (fundamental disagreement on government's role in enforcing morality), Progressive (disagreement on decriminalization, harm reduction, secular vs. faith-based approaches), Democratic Socialist (disagreement on structural analysis and government role)

### Democratic Socialist Perspective

#### Engagement Consistency Assessment

**Score: 4/5 - Mostly Consistent**

| Indicator | Assessment |
|-----------|------------|
| Stated vs actual motivations | Genuine commitment to treating addiction as a social and economic justice issue; positions consistently reflect structural critique of capitalism's role in drug policy |
| Principle consistency | Highly consistent application of class analysis and public goods framework to drug policy -- pharmaceutical industry as capitalist exploitation, drug enforcement as class and race control |
| Goalpost stability | Positions have been stable and internally coherent; supports comprehensive public health approach with public ownership of treatment infrastructure |
| Zero-sum behavior | Moderate -- may resist market-based reforms or partnerships with pharmaceutical industry even when pragmatically beneficial |

**Justification:** The democratic socialist perspective provides the most comprehensive structural critique of U.S. drug policy, connecting it to broader patterns of economic inequality, corporate power, racial capitalism, and the failure of public institutions. Democratic socialists argue that addiction is a predictable outcome of a society that creates economic insecurity, social isolation, and despair while allowing pharmaceutical companies to profit from both creating and treating addiction. This perspective is internally consistent and principled, though it may overstate the degree to which drug policy problems can be solved through economic redistribution alone, and may underestimate the role of individual choice and cultural factors.

**Evidence for assessment:**

- Democratic Socialists of America, drug policy platform: Supports full decriminalization, public treatment system, and pharmaceutical industry nationalization
- Sen. Bernie Sanders, "Medicare for All" and drug policy positions: Supports universal treatment access, pharmaceutical price controls, and criminal justice reform
- Jacobin magazine analysis of the War on Drugs: Frames drug enforcement as a tool of class control and racial capitalism

#### Position Scores

| Dimension | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Current State Assessment | 9/10 | Strongly agrees with the analysis of drug policy failure, overdose crisis, treatment gap, and racial disparities. Adds emphasis on economic inequality and despair as drivers of the crisis. May argue the analysis understates the connection between capitalism, economic insecurity, and addiction |
| Root Cause Agreement | 9/10 | Strongly agrees with all root cause categories (criminalization, pharmaceutical industry, inadequate treatment, racial targeting). Adds economic inequality, alienation under capitalism, and the commodification of healthcare as additional root causes |

**Source references:**

| International Drug Policy Reform | 9/10 | Supports ending all supply-side interventions, reforming UN treaties, centering human rights, and providing development assistance and debt relief to affected countries | Frames U.S. international drug policy as imperialist; supports reparative approach |

#### Legislation Evaluations

| Bill | Score | Stated Position | Underlying Concerns |
|------|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Comprehensive Drug Policy Reform Act | 7/10 | Supports as a starting point but advocates for stronger provisions: personal possession decriminalization, higher spending targets, public treatment system | Concern that the bill does not go far enough on decriminalization or public health investment |
| Drug Scheduling Modernization Act | 8/10 | Supports independent commission; wants stronger conflict-of-interest provisions barring pharmaceutical industry influence | Supports evidence-based reform but wants to ensure commission is not captured by industry |

| Sentencing Reform and Equity Act | 8/10 | Supports all provisions; advocates for adding compensation/reparations for unjust incarceration and full decriminalization | Views the bill as good but insufficient without personal possession decriminalization |

#### Alternative Proposals

- **Universal public treatment system** funded through Medicare for All, eliminating private treatment industry and ensuring treatment is free, universal, and evidence-based
- **Public pharmaceutical manufacturing** of all addiction treatment medications (buprenorphine, naloxone, methadone) through a federal or state-owned entity
- **Comprehensive social investment** as the most effective prevention: guaranteed housing, universal basic income, universal childcare, and free public education through college
- **Full decriminalization** of personal possession with massive public health investment (the "Portugal Plus" model with much stronger social safety net)
- **Reparations** for communities devastated by the War on Drugs, funded by cannabis tax revenue, opioid settlements, and redirected enforcement spending
- **Worker-owned cannabis cooperatives** as the preferred model for the legal cannabis industry, preventing corporate consolidation
- **International solidarity** -- end all foreign drug enforcement programs, cancel debts of drug-affected nations, and support indigenous crop alternatives

#### Coalition Potential

- **Natural allies:** Progressive (shared structural critique, public health framework, anti-corporate stance), Liberal (shared reform goals on treatment, harm reduction, and racial equity)
- **Potential bridges:** Libertarian (shared anti-prohibitionist stance, decriminalization agreement despite different rationale), Populist (shared anti-pharmaceutical-corporation anger)

### Common Ground Synthesis

This matrix identifies which reforms have potential cross-ideological support and which face structural opposition.

| Reform Category | Broad Support (5+) | Narrow Support (3-4) | Structural Opposition |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Treatment Expansion | Liberal, Progressive, Conservative, Centrist, Religious Right, Democratic Socialist, Populist | Libertarian, Constitutionalist | None (though modalities differ) |
| Pharmaceutical Accountability | Liberal, Progressive, Conservative, Populist, Centrist, Religious Right, Democratic Socialist | -- | Libertarian, Constitutionalist (oppose new regulatory mechanisms) |
| Cannabis Legalization | Liberal, Progressive, Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Democratic Socialist, Centrist | Conservative, Populist | Religious Right |
| Harm Reduction (naloxone/test strips) | Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Democratic Socialist, Libertarian | Conservative, Populist, Religious Right | None for naloxone; mixed for broader measures |
| Full Decriminalization | Progressive, Libertarian, Democratic Socialist | Liberal, Constitutionalist | Conservative, Populist, Religious Right, Centrist |
| Sentencing Reform | Liberal, Progressive, Libertarian, Centrist, Democratic Socialist, Constitutionalist | Conservative | Populist, Religious Right |
| Supervised Consumption Sites | Progressive, Liberal, Democratic Socialist | Centrist | Conservative, Libertarian (funding), Populist, Religious Right, Constitutionalist |
| Prevention Investment | Liberal, Progressive, Conservative, Centrist, Religious Right, Democratic Socialist | Populist | Libertarian, Constitutionalist |

**Key insight:** Treatment expansion and pharmaceutical accountability have the broadest cross-ideological support (7-8 of 9 perspectives), making them the most viable starting points for reform. Cannabis legalization and sentencing reform have strong majority support (6-7 of 9). Harm reduction beyond naloxone and supervised consumption sites face the deepest ideological divisions. Full decriminalization, despite strong evidence, faces structural opposition from 4-5 of 9 perspectives.

## Compromise Proposals

### Compromise 1: Treatment and Accountability First Act

**Bridges:** Conservative + Liberal + Progressive + Centrist + Populist + Religious Right + Democratic Socialist

**Core Agreement:** Nearly all perspectives agree that addiction treatment should be expanded and that pharmaceutical companies that caused the opioid crisis should be held accountable. These are the two highest-support reforms across all perspectives.

**Policy Description:**

A focused bill combining treatment system transformation with pharmaceutical industry accountability. This proposal includes treatment on demand (48-hour access standard), MAT expansion (including methadone pharmacy dispensing), National Addiction Medicine Corps (workforce investment), insurance parity enforcement with private right of action, opioid settlement fund governance (80% allocation to treatment/prevention), and criminal prosecution framework for pharmaceutical executives who engaged in deceptive marketing. The bill explicitly includes faith-based recovery programs as eligible providers, addresses treatment quality standards, and funds both evidence-based and community-based prevention programs.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Conservative | Expands treatment including faith-based programs; holds pharmaceutical companies accountable; does not include harm reduction or decriminalization |
| Liberal | Expands treatment access, enforces insurance parity, funds workforce investment, and creates pharmaceutical accountability |
| Progressive | Advances treatment on demand, creates accountability mechanisms, and invests in underserved communities |
| Centrist | Evidence-based, bipartisan approach with strong accountability and measurable outcomes |
| Populist | Punishes pharmaceutical executives, protects working-class communities, and funds local treatment programs |
| Religious Right | Supports faith-based recovery programs; holds immoral pharmaceutical conduct accountable; excludes harm reduction measures |
| Democratic Socialist | Moves toward universal treatment access; creates corporate accountability; invests in public health infrastructure |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Conservative | Accepting government-funded treatment expansion and mandatory MAT availability |
| Liberal | Deferring harm reduction expansion and decriminalization to separate legislation |
| Progressive | Accepting incremental treatment expansion rather than universal public treatment system |
| Centrist | Accepting faith-based program inclusion without strict evidence-based requirements |
| Populist | Accepting treatment-oriented approach rather than purely punitive response to pharmaceutical companies |
| Religious Right | Accepting MAT availability requirements rather than abstinence-only approach |
| Democratic Socialist | Accepting private treatment system reform rather than public ownership model |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 7/9 perspectives (Libertarian and Constitutionalist excluded due to opposition to new federal spending programs)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 5/7 coalition members rated 4+ consistency (Liberal, Progressive, Centrist, Religious Right [3], Democratic Socialist)
- **Durability:** High -- treatment expansion and pharmaceutical accountability have stable, broad-based support that is unlikely to erode
- **Implementation Path:** Bipartisan bill modeled on the First Step Act and SUPPORT Act legislative pathways; introduced with both Republican and Democratic sponsors; funded through opioid settlement governance provisions and cannabis tax revenue (if legalized separately)

---

### Compromise 2: Cannabis Commerce and Equity Act

**Bridges:** Liberal + Progressive + Libertarian + Constitutionalist + Centrist + Democratic Socialist

**Core Agreement:** A solid majority of perspectives support resolving the federal-state cannabis policy conflict, though they prefer different regulatory approaches. The common ground is removing federal prohibition and allowing states to regulate cannabis.

**Policy Description:**

Federal descheduling of cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act, combined with a minimal federal framework that establishes a floor (minimum age 21, product safety testing, marketing restrictions) while explicitly deferring most regulation to the states. Includes the SAFE Banking Act provisions for banking access, elimination of Section 280E tax penalties, automatic expungement of federal cannabis possession convictions, a community reinvestment fund (allocated to states based on historical cannabis arrest rates), and small business and equity license programs. States retain full authority to prohibit, regulate, or legalize cannabis within their borders.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Liberal | Achieves legalization with social equity, expungement, and community reinvestment |
| Progressive | Includes equity provisions, community reinvestment, small business protections against corporate consolidation |
| Libertarian | Removes federal prohibition; minimal federal regulatory footprint; states' rights approach |
| Constitutionalist | Restores state authority over cannabis policy; reduces federal overreach; respects federalism |
| Centrist | Resolves the untenable federal-state conflict; evidence-based approach; incremental (states can still prohibit) |
| Democratic Socialist | Includes equity provisions and community reinvestment; small business protections; but would prefer cooperative model |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Liberal | Accepting less comprehensive federal regulatory framework than preferred |
| Progressive | Accepting descheduling without worker-owned cooperative mandate or public option |
| Libertarian | Accepting some federal regulatory framework (age limits, product safety, marketing restrictions) |
| Constitutionalist | Accepting any federal framework rather than pure state control |
| Centrist | Moving to full descheduling rather than preferred incremental rescheduling approach |
| Democratic Socialist | Accepting private market framework rather than public or cooperative model |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 6/9 perspectives (Conservative, Populist, and Religious Right excluded due to opposition to legalization)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 5/6 coalition members rated 4+ consistency (Liberal, Progressive, Libertarian, Constitutionalist, Democratic Socialist)
- **Durability:** High -- cannabis legalization has 70% public support (Gallup, 2024) and momentum is toward expansion, not reversal
- **Implementation Path:** Building on the MORE Act (passed House 2022) and SAFE Banking Act (passed Senate committee); introduced as bipartisan legislation; 24 states with legal cannabis provide proof of concept and political constituency

### Compromise 3: Evidence-Based Sentencing and Overdose Prevention Act

**Bridges:** Liberal + Progressive + Libertarian + Centrist + Conservative + Democratic Socialist

**Core Agreement:** Multiple perspectives agree that federal drug sentencing is excessively harsh and that overdose prevention tools (naloxone, fentanyl test strips) should be universally accessible, even if they disagree about broader decriminalization and harm reduction.

**Policy Description:**

A two-part bill combining: (1) Federal sentencing reform -- elimination of mandatory minimums for drug offenses, completion of crack/powder cocaine parity at 1:1, retroactive application with resentencing petition process, expansion of drug court alternatives, and streamlined federal cannabis expungement; and (2) Universal overdose prevention -- free naloxone distribution through federal bulk purchasing program, nationwide legalization of fentanyl test strips (with preemption of state paraphernalia laws), Good Samaritan law protections at the federal level, and naloxone distribution at all federal facilities including prisons and VA hospitals. Does not include supervised consumption site authorization, syringe service expansion, or personal possession decriminalization.

**Concern Mapping:**

| Perspective | How This Addresses Their Concerns |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|
| Liberal | Advances sentencing reform, achieves crack/powder parity, expands naloxone access, legalizes test strips |
| Progressive | Reduces incarceration, addresses racial sentencing disparities, saves lives through overdose prevention |
| Libertarian | Reduces government power to imprison people for drug offenses; removes penalties for possessing harm reduction tools |
| Centrist | Evidence-based reforms with strong bipartisan precedent (First Step Act model); naloxone saves lives without controversy |
| Conservative | Builds on First Step Act model; drug courts maintain accountability while providing treatment; naloxone saves lives |
| Democratic Socialist | Reduces mass incarceration, addresses racial disparities, makes lifesaving tools universally available |

**Concessions:**

| Perspective | What They Give Up |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Liberal | Deferring comprehensive harm reduction (syringe services, supervised consumption) to separate legislation |
| Progressive | Accepting sentencing reform rather than full decriminalization; deferring broader harm reduction |
| Libertarian | Accepting federal naloxone spending program rather than pure deregulatory approach |
| Centrist | Moving to mandatory minimum elimination rather than preferred incremental reduction |
| Conservative | Accepting elimination of all drug mandatory minimums and retroactive application |
| Democratic Socialist | Accepting incremental reform rather than comprehensive decriminalization package |

**Viability Assessment:**

- **Coalition Size:** 6/9 perspectives (Populist, Religious Right, and Constitutionalist excluded -- Populist and Religious Right oppose mandatory minimum elimination; Constitutionalist opposes federal preemption of state paraphernalia laws)
- **High Consistency Ratio:** 5/6 coalition members rated 4+ consistency (Liberal, Progressive, Libertarian, Centrist, Democratic Socialist)
- **Durability:** High -- sentencing reform and naloxone access have strong evidence base and growing bipartisan momentum; unlikely to face rollback
- **Implementation Path:** Introduced as a "First Step Act II" with bipartisan sponsorship; naloxone provisions could be implemented through executive action or appropriations riders if full legislation stalls; sentencing provisions build on established precedent

## Strategic Implications

### Most Viable Coalition

The most productive coalition for drug policy reform is the **Liberal-Centrist-Conservative alliance on treatment expansion**, supplemented by Progressive and Democratic Socialist support for stronger provisions. This coalition produced the First Step Act, the SUPPORT Act, and bipartisan opioid task forces. Treatment expansion (Compromise 1) should be the first legislative priority because it has the broadest support (7/9 perspectives), addresses the most urgent need (the treatment gap), and builds trust for more ambitious reforms.

Cannabis legalization (Compromise 2) should be the second priority, as it has strong majority support (6/9 perspectives), 70% public support, and growing state-level momentum. The third priority should be sentencing reform and overdose prevention (Compromise 3), building on the First Step Act model.

### Key Obstacles

1. **Harm reduction beyond naloxone** faces the deepest ideological divisions. Supervised consumption sites are supported by only 3-4 of 9 perspectives, and the moral objections from the Religious Right and cultural concerns from Populists and Conservatives are deeply held and resistant to evidence.

2. **Full decriminalization** faces structural opposition from 4-5 perspectives. The Oregon experience (Measure 110's partial rollback in 2024) has created additional political obstacles by allowing opponents to argue that decriminalization has been "tried and failed," despite implementation failures being the primary lesson.

3. **The DEA's institutional power** makes scheduling reform politically difficult regardless of evidence. The DEA has strong congressional allies, a large budget, and institutional incentives to resist any reform that reduces its authority.

4. **Pharmaceutical industry lobbying** ($374 million annually) can delay or water down accountability measures and FDA reform even when public support for accountability is near-universal.

### Low Consistency Partners

The **Populist perspective** (2/5 consistency) is the most challenging coalition partner. Populist positions on drug policy shift dramatically based on political leadership, media framing, and which communities are perceived as affected. Strategies for managing populist unpredictability include:

- Frame treatment expansion as protecting working-class communities
- Lead with pharmaceutical accountability, which is the populist position with highest consistency and intensity
- Avoid framing reforms in terms that trigger populist "soft on crime" reactions
- Use local voices (sheriffs, nurses, pastors) from affected communities rather than national policy experts to make the case for reform

The **Conservative and Religious Right perspectives** (both 3/5 consistency) have shifted significantly since the opioid crisis but remain inconsistent in applying compassion across different drugs and demographics. The most effective approach is to build on the First Step Act precedent and frame reforms in terms conservatives and religious voters embrace: personal responsibility (treatment over incarceration), fiscal conservatism (treatment is cheaper than prison), and moral accountability (pharmaceutical industry punishment).

### Recommended Approach

The recommended legislative strategy is a **sequenced, trust-building approach**:

1. **Year 1-2:** Treatment and Accountability First Act (Compromise 1) -- broadest coalition, highest urgency, builds trust
2. **Year 2-3:** Cannabis Commerce and Equity Act (Compromise 2) -- strong majority support, resolves untenable federal-state conflict
3. **Year 3-5:** Evidence-Based Sentencing and Overdose Prevention Act (Compromise 3) -- builds on First Step Act, addresses racial disparities
4. **Year 5+:** Comprehensive harm reduction expansion and scheduling reform as political conditions permit

This sequencing moves from highest-consensus to most-controversial reforms, building coalitions incrementally and demonstrating results at each stage. Early wins on treatment expansion and pharmaceutical accountability create political capital for more ambitious reforms.
