# Prison Labor Reform: Legislation

## Overview

Comprehensive prison labor reform requires legislative action at federal, state, and constitutional levels. This chapter provides draft legislative text for key reforms, including the fundamental step of amending the 13th Amendment to remove the punishment exception.

## Constitutional Amendments

### 13th Amendment Reform

The most fundamental reform is removing the exception clause from the 13th Amendment.

#### Proposed Amendment Text

**JOINT RESOLUTION**

Proposing an amendment to the Constitution of the United States to prohibit the use of slavery and involuntary servitude as punishment for crime.

*Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of each House concurring therein),* That the following article is proposed as an amendment to the Constitution of the United States, which shall be valid to all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States:

**ARTICLE —**

**Section 1.** Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction.

**Section 2.** Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation.

**Section 3.** This article shall take effect two years after the date of ratification.

#### Explanation

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Removal of "except" clause | Eliminates constitutional basis for forced prison labor |
| Two-year implementation | Allows time for systems to adjust |
| Congressional enforcement | Enables implementing legislation |
| No grandfathering | Applies to all incarcerated people |

#### Constitutional Considerations

| Issue | Analysis |

For states pursuing constitutional reform ahead of federal action.

**BALLOT MEASURE**

**[State] Constitutional Amendment**

**Section 1.** Article [X], Section [Y] of the [State] Constitution is hereby amended to read:

**Purpose**: Implement 13th Amendment reform and establish fair labor standards for incarcerated workers

```
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Abolition of Prison Slavery Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The 13th Amendment to the Constitution, while abolishing slavery,
    contains an exception permitting involuntary servitude "as a punishment

    persons at wages far below minimum wage or for no compensation at all.
(3) Approximately 800,000 incarcerated persons work in American prisons,
    with average wages ranging from $0.13 to $0.52 per hour.
(4) The historical development of prison labor from convict leasing systems
    perpetuates the legacy of slavery, disproportionately affecting Black
    and Brown communities.
(5) International human rights standards, including International Labour
    Organization conventions, prohibit forced labor regardless of criminal
    conviction.
(6) Fair wages for incarcerated workers support family stability, reduce
    recidivism, and prepare individuals for successful reentry.

(a) FINDINGS.—The Legislature finds that:
    (1) Forced labor, even as punishment for crime, conflicts with

| 8th Amendment | Extreme exploitation may constitute cruel punishment |

### Preemption Issues

| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| State minimum wage laws | Federal floor with state ability to exceed |
| OSHA | Express extension to correctional facilities |
| NLRA | May require separate legislation for organizing rights |

### Enforcement Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Administrative (DOL) | Expert agency, ongoing oversight | Resource constraints |
| Private right of action | Direct remedy, no agency bottleneck | Access to courts from prison |
| Grant conditions | Leverage over states | Political resistance |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| "Voluntary" reclassification | Work renamed "programming" or "therapy" to avoid wage requirements | High |
| Independent contractor classification | Incarcerated workers classified as contractors not employees | High |
| Good-time credit workarounds | Credits tied to "participation" rather than "work" but same effect | High |
| Deduction creep | New deduction categories created (administration fees, supplies) | Medium |
| Subminimum wage for "training" | Extended "training periods" at reduced wages | Medium |
| Small facility exemptions | Exemptions for facilities under certain population thresholds | Medium |
| Interstate work transfers | Prisoners transferred to non-compliant jurisdictions for work | Medium |
| Third-party contractor arrangements | Work contracted through intermediaries to avoid direct liability | High |
| Emergency/disaster exceptions | Broad interpretation of "emergencies" allowing forced labor | Medium |
| Religious/nonprofit exemptions | Work for religious or nonprofit organizations exempted | Low |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Amendment process difficulty | Fundamental reform delayed or blocked | Supermajority requirements |
| State implementation gaps | Uneven protection across jurisdictions | Federalism |
| Enforcement resource limits | Violations go undetected or unaddressed | Budget constraints |
| Access to courts | Incarcerated people cannot easily pursue remedies | Prison conditions |
| PLRA limitations | Prison Litigation Reform Act restricts prisoner lawsuits | Existing federal law |
| Information asymmetry | Incarcerated workers unaware of rights | Communication barriers |
| Retaliation risks | Fear prevents complaints and organizing | Power imbalance |
| Industry resistance | Powerful economic interests oppose reform | Lobbying and influence |
| Limited remedies | Back pay insufficient deterrent | Weak penalty structure |
| No union rights | Collective action difficult without organizing protections | NLRA exclusion |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Close reclassification loopholes**: Define "work" broadly to include any productive activity regardless of label, with explicit anti-avoidance language prohibiting evasion through renaming.

2. **Strengthen employment classification**: Establish clear presumption that all work performed by incarcerated persons is employment, with burden on facility to prove otherwise.

3. **Prohibit all coercive incentive structures**: Extend prohibition beyond explicit punishment to include any benefit conditioning that creates work pressure, including good-time credits.

4. **Create closed deduction list**: Establish exclusive list of permissible deductions with no regulatory authority to add categories; require legislative action for any additions.

5. **Eliminate training wage loopholes**: Cap "training" periods at 30 days maximum; require demonstration of actual training content.

6. **Apply to all facilities**: No population or size exemptions; apply to all places of incarceration without exception.

7. **Prohibit work transfers**: Bar transfers for purpose of work to jurisdictions with lesser protections.

8. **Establish joint liability**: Hold all parties in contracting chain jointly and severally liable for violations.

9. **Narrow emergency exceptions**: Define emergencies strictly (imminent threat to life); require written justification and time limits; compensate at premium rates.

10. **No exemptions by employer type**: Apply requirements regardless of whether employer is for-profit, nonprofit, or religious organization.

11. **PLRA reform**: Amend Prison Litigation Reform Act to exempt wage and workplace safety claims from exhaustion requirements and filing fee barriers.

12. **Robust whistleblower protections**: Create strong anti-retaliation provisions with automatic remedies and burden shifting.

13. **Mandatory attorney's fees**: Require fee-shifting in all successful claims to incentivize representation.

14. **Enhanced penalties**: Increase civil penalties substantially; add criminal liability for willful and repeated violations.

15. **Ombudsman program**: Create independent ombudsman offices to receive complaints and monitor compliance within facilities.

### General Implementation Concerns

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| Constitutional amendment timeline | Pursue state amendments and federal legislation simultaneously |
| State resistance | Use grant conditions and litigation to compel compliance |
| Budget impacts | Phase in requirements; demonstrate cost savings from reduced recidivism |
| Industry disruption | Transition periods; alternative vocational programming |
| Enforcement capacity | Dedicated funding; private attorney general provisions |
| Prison security claims | Distinguish security from labor; reject overbroad security justifications |
| Political opposition | Build broad coalitions; emphasize human rights and economic arguments |
| Implementation monitoring | Annual reporting requirements; independent oversight |
