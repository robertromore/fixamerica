# Prison Labor Reform: Overview

## Executive Summary

Prison labor in the United States operates under a constitutional exception that permits involuntary servitude as punishment for crime. The 13th Amendment, ratified in 1865 to abolish slavery, contains a clause that has enabled the development of a multi-billion dollar prison labor industry. Nearly 800,000 incarcerated individuals work in American prisons, many earning pennies per hour or nothing at all, producing goods and services for government agencies and private corporations. This system raises fundamental questions about exploitation, human rights, and the legacy of slavery in America.

## Scope of This Document Series

This series examines the full landscape of prison labor in America:

- Constitutional foundations and the 13th Amendment exception
- Federal and state prison labor programs
- Private sector involvement and profiteering
- Worker conditions, wages, and safety
- Reform proposals and abolition movements
- Legislative pathways to meaningful change

## Key Statistics

|--------|------|
| Incarcerated workers in U.S. prisons | ~800,000 |
| Annual value of prison labor | $2-11 billion (estimates vary) |
| Average hourly wage (state prisons) | $0.13 - $0.52 |
| Federal minimum wage for UNICOR | $0.23 - $1.15/hour |
| States with unpaid prison labor | 5 (Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, Texas) |
| Incarcerated people in work programs | 65%+ of eligible population |
| UNICOR (Federal Prison Industries) revenue | ~$500 million annually |
| Private prison industry revenue | ~$4 billion annually |
| States allowing unpaid mandatory labor | 16 |
| Incarcerated firefighters (California) | ~3,400 |

## Core Problems

### 1. Constitutional Exploitation
The 13th Amendment explicitly permits slavery and involuntary servitude "as punishment for crime." This exception has been weaponized to create a permanent underclass of workers with no labor protections.

### 2. Poverty Wages and No Wages
Incarcerated workers earn an average of 13-52 cents per hour for regular prison jobs. In five states, prisoners receive no compensation at all. Even in the best-paying positions, wages have actually declined since the 1980s when adjusted for inflation.

### 3. Coercive "Voluntary" Work
While often described as voluntary, refusal to work in many facilities results in:
- Loss of good-time credits
- Solitary confinement
- Loss of commissary privileges
- Denial of family visits
- Negative parole reviews

### 4. Private Sector Exploitation
Major corporations have used prison labor to manufacture products, staff call centers, and perform services—benefiting from wages far below minimum wage without providing benefits, union representation, or labor protections.

### 5. Unsafe Working Conditions
Incarcerated workers are excluded from OSHA protections and workers' compensation in most states. They face dangerous conditions in manufacturing, agriculture, and firefighting with limited recourse for injuries.

### 6. Skills Deficit vs. Exploitation
While proponents argue prison labor provides job training, most positions offer little transferable skills. When skills are developed (such as firefighting), occupational licensing restrictions often prevent employment after release.

### 7. Labor Market Distortion
Below-market prison labor competes unfairly with free-world workers and businesses, potentially depressing wages and eliminating jobs in affected industries.

### 8. Racial Disparities
The prison population is disproportionately Black and Brown. Prison labor thus extends racialized exploitation that echoes the convict leasing system that emerged immediately after slavery's formal abolition.

## The Path Forward

Meaningful reform requires:

1. **Constitutional Amendment**: Removing the punishment exception from the 13th Amendment
2. **Fair Wage Standards**: Applying minimum wage and labor laws to incarcerated workers
3. **Voluntary Work**: Ending mandatory work requirements and punitive consequences for refusal
4. **Safety Protections**: Extending OSHA and workers' compensation to prison workplaces
5. **Skills Investment**: Creating genuine vocational training aligned with post-release opportunities
6. **Corporate Accountability**: Transparency requirements and restrictions on prison labor contracting
7. **Reentry Support**: Removing occupational licensing barriers for formerly incarcerated workers

## Why This Matters

Prison labor reform is not merely a criminal justice issue—it is a labor rights issue, a civil rights issue, and a human rights issue. The constitutional permission of involuntary servitude creates a caste system that:

- Undermines the dignity of incarcerated people
- Perpetuates racial and economic inequality
- Distorts labor markets and harms free-world workers
- Generates perverse incentives for mass incarceration
- Conflicts with international human rights standards

The United States cannot claim to have abolished slavery while maintaining a constitutional exception that permits forced labor of 800,000 people.
