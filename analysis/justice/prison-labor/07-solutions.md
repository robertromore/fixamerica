# Prison Labor Reform: Solutions

## Overview

Meaningful prison labor reform requires addressing constitutional foundations, economic structures, and workplace conditions. This chapter presents a comprehensive menu of solutions ranging from incremental reforms to transformative change, allowing advocates to pursue multiple strategies simultaneously.

## Constitutional Reform

### 13th Amendment Reform

The most fundamental solution is removing the exception clause from the 13th Amendment.

**Current Text**:
> "Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, **except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted**, shall exist within the United States..."

**Proposed Amendment Text**:
> "Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction."

**Amendment Process**:

| Step | Requirement | Challenge Level |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| Congressional proposal | 2/3 of both House and Senate | Very High |
| State ratification | 3/4 of state legislatures (38 states) | Very High |
| Alternative: Constitutional Convention | 2/3 of state legislatures call | Unprecedented |

**Strategic Value**:

- Eliminates legal foundation for forced prison labor
- Symbolic repudiation of slavery's legacy
- Creates framework for implementing legislation
- Aligns with international human rights standards

### State Constitutional Amendments

Several states have already amended their constitutions:

| State | Year | Action | Result |
|-------|------|--------|--------|
| Colorado | 2018 | Removed slavery exception | Passed 65% |
| Nebraska | 2020 | Removed slavery exception | Passed 68% |
| Utah | 2020 | Removed slavery exception | Passed 80% |
| Alabama | 2022 | Removed slavery language | Passed 77% |
| Oregon | 2022 | Removed slavery exception | Passed 55% |
| Tennessee | 2022 | Removed slavery exception | Passed 79% |
| Vermont | 2022 | Prohibited slavery entirely | Passed 89% |

**Lessons Learned**:

| Lesson | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| Ballot language matters | Louisiana failed due to confusing wording |
| Broad coalitions help | Religious, labor, civil rights support |
| Implementation is key | Amendments alone don't change policy |
| Litigation follows | Courts interpret new provisions |

## Fair Wage Solutions

### Minimum Wage Application

**Proposal**: Apply federal or state minimum wage to all prison work

**Implementation Approaches**:
