slavery that must end.

[Your Address]
[Date]

The Honorable [Name]
[Address]

Dear [Representative/Senator] [Name]:

I am writing as your constituent to urge you to support prison
labor reform in our state/country.

[Personal connection or story if applicable]

The 13th Amendment to the Constitution permits slavery "as a
punishment for crime." This exception has created a system where
800,000 incarcerated Americans work for pennies per hour or
nothing at all.

I specifically ask that you:
1. [Specific request - support/introduce specific legislation]
2. [Second request if applicable]

This is not a partisan issue—it is a human rights issue. I look
forward to your response and to seeing your leadership on this
important matter.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
```
