# Prison Labor Reform: History

## Overview

The history of prison labor in the United States is inseparable from the history of slavery, racial oppression, and the ongoing struggle for labor rights. From the convict leasing system that emerged immediately after Emancipation to modern prison industries, the exploitation of incarcerated workers represents a continuous thread in American history.

## The 13th Amendment: Abolition with Exception

### The Text

> "Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, **except as a punishment for crime whereof the party shall have been duly convicted**, shall exist within the United States, or any place subject to their jurisdiction."
> — 13th Amendment, ratified December 6, 1865

### The Exception Clause

The "exception clause" was not accidental. Its inclusion:

- Drew from existing practices in Northern states where prison labor was common
- Reflected beliefs about the forfeiture of rights upon conviction
- Created a legal pathway for continued exploitation of Black labor in the South
- Was immediately weaponized through Black Codes and convict leasing

### Black Codes (1865-1866)

Southern states immediately passed Black Codes criminalizing:

| "Offense" | Typical Penalty |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Vagrancy (being unemployed) | Fine or hard labor |
| Loitering | Fine or imprisonment |
| Breaking labor contracts | Arrest and forced return |
| "Mischief" | Fine or imprisonment |
| Being outside after curfew | Fine or imprisonment |
| Assembling without permission | Fine or imprisonment |

These laws targeted newly freed Black people, funneling them into the criminal justice system and back into forced labor.

## Convict Leasing System (1865-1928)

### How It Worked

Under convict leasing, states leased incarcerated people—predominantly Black men—to private businesses:

1. State arrests individuals (often for minor or fabricated offenses)
2. State convicts and sentences to hard labor
3. State leases prisoner to private company
4. Company pays state, controls prisoner completely
5. Company works prisoner with no accountability

### Scale of Convict Leasing

| State | Peak Years | Industries |
|-------|------------|------------|
| Alabama | 1875-1928 | Coal mining, steel, railroads |
| Georgia | 1868-1908 | Railroads, turpentine, agriculture |
| Mississippi | 1865-1890s | Railroads, levee construction |
| Texas | 1866-1912 | Railroads, sugar plantations |
| Tennessee | 1866-1896 | Coal mining |
| Florida | 1877-1919 | Turpentine, phosphate mining |

### Death Rates

Convict leasing was often a death sentence:

| Location | Annual Death Rate |
|----------|------------------|
| Alabama coal mines | 25-45% |
| Mississippi levee camps | 10-25% |
| Florida turpentine camps | 15-25% |
| National prison average today | ~0.3% |

### Profitability

Convict leasing was enormously profitable for states and companies:

- Alabama's convict leasing provided 73% of state revenue in 1883
- Tennessee Coal and Iron Company built empire on leased convict labor
- U.S. Steel Corporation inherited TCI's convict labor system

### Resistance and Abolition

Convict leasing ended due to:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Worker resistance (strikes, sabotage) | Increased costs for lessees |
| Free labor union opposition | Political pressure |
| Progressive Era reforms | Moral arguments |
| Boll weevil (cotton collapse) | Economic shifts |
| World War I labor needs | Alternative employment |
| Public scandals (death exposés) | Political embarrassment |

Last states to abolish:

- Georgia: 1908
- Texas: 1912
- Alabama: 1928

## Chain Gangs (1900s-1950s)

### Transition from Leasing

As convict leasing ended, Southern states transitioned to chain gangs:

- State retained control of labor
- Prisoners worked on public projects
- Visible chains became iconic symbol of Southern punishment
- Continued racial targeting and brutality

### Chain Gang Labor

| Project Type | States |
|-------------|--------|
| Road construction | All Southern states |
| Bridge building | Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi |
| Quarry work | Georgia, Florida |
| Farm labor | Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi |

### Conditions

- 14-16 hour workdays
- Physical restraints (chains, shackles)
- Corporal punishment (whipping, "sweat boxes")
- Inadequate food and water
- No medical care
- High death rates from exhaustion and violence

### Decline of Chain Gangs

| Decade | Developments |
|--------|--------------|
| 1930s | New Deal road projects reduced need |
| 1940s | WWII labor needs shifted priorities |
| 1950s | Public relations concerns |
| 1960s | Civil rights movement pressure |
| 1970s | Formal abolition in most states |

*Brief revival in 1990s (Arizona, Alabama) as "tough on crime" theater*

## Rise of Prison Industries (1930s-1970s)

### Federal Prison Industries (UNICOR)

**Established**: 1934 under FDR's New Deal

**Original Purpose**:

- Reduce prison idleness
- Provide job training
- Self-fund prison operations
- Reduce reliance on convict leasing model

**Ashurst-Sumners Act (1935)**:

- Prohibited interstate transport of prison-made goods
- Protected private industry from prison labor competition
- Created exceptions for government sales

### State Prison Industries

States developed their own prison industries:

| Era | Focus |
|-----|-------|
| 1930s-1940s | License plates, road signs, office furniture |
| 1950s-1960s | Expansion into textiles, food processing |
| 1970s | Professionalization of prison industries |

### Labor Union Opposition

Organized labor historically opposed prison labor:

- Competed with free workers for jobs
- Depressed wages in affected industries
- Undermined organizing efforts
- Unions successfully lobbied for restrictions

## Mass Incarceration and Modern Prison Labor (1980s-Present)

### The War on Drugs and Prison Population Explosion

| Year | U.S. Prison Population | Rate per 100,000 |
|------|----------------------|------------------|
| 1980 | 329,000 | 139 |
| 1990 | 771,000 | 297 |
| 2000 | 1,394,000 | 478 |
| 2010 | 1,613,000 | 500 |
| 2020 | 1,430,000 | 358 |

### Prison Industry Enhancement Certification Program (PIECP)

**Established**: 1979

**Purpose**: Allow private companies to employ prisoners

**Provisions**:

- Prisoners must be paid "prevailing wages"
- Unions must be consulted
- Programs cannot displace free workers

**Reality**:

- Massive deductions reduce actual pay
- Little union oversight
- Displacement difficult to prove
- Became vehicle for corporate exploitation

### Private Prison Industry Emergence

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1983 | Corrections Corporation of America (CCA) founded |
| 1984 | First private prison contracts |
| 1990s | Rapid expansion of private prisons |
| 2000s | Private prisons become billion-dollar industry |
| 2010s | Peak at ~130,000 federal/state private prison beds |

### Corporate Exploitation Scandals

| Company | Issue | Time Period |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| Victoria's Secret | Prison workers sewing lingerie | 1990s |
| TWA | Prisoners handling reservations | 1990s |
| Chevron | Prison oil pipeline workers | 1990s-2000s |
| Whole Foods | Prisoners processing food | 2000s-2010s |
| McDonald's/Wendy's | Prison-made uniforms/products | Ongoing |

## The Firefighter Paradox

### California Conservation Camps

**Established**: 1946 (formalized 1963)

**Current scale**:

- 35+ fire camps
- ~3,400 incarcerated firefighters
- ~$100 million annual savings to California

### The Irony

Until 2020, formerly incarcerated firefighters could not obtain professional firefighting licenses due to their criminal records—despite being trusted to fight fires while incarcerated.

| Timeline | Development |
|----------|-------------|
| 1946 | Program begins |
| 1963 | Formal Conservation Camp program |
| 2018 | Massive fires highlight reliance on prison labor |
| 2020 | AB 2147 creates pathway to expungement for licensure |

## Prison Labor Strikes and Resistance

### Historical Resistance

| Year | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1971 | Attica uprising (NY) - included labor demands |
| 1972 | Work stoppages across multiple states |
| 2010 | Georgia prison work stoppage (10,000+ participants) |
| 2016 | National Prison Strike (24 states) |
| 2018 | National Prison Strike (17 states) |

### 2016 National Prison Strike

Coordinated by Incarcerated Workers Organizing Committee (IWOC):

**Demands included**:

1. End prison slavery
2. Apply minimum wage to prison work
3. End mandatory work requirements
4. Improve working conditions
5. Provide meaningful rehabilitation

**Participation**: Estimated 24,000-57,000 incarcerated people across 24 states

### 2018 National Prison Strike

Triggered by Lee Correctional Institution violence (South Carolina):

**Ten Demands**:

1. Improve conditions
2. End prison slavery
3. End racial discrimination
4. End gang enhancement laws
5. Reform sentencing
6. End death penalty
7. Access to rehabilitation
8. Restore voting rights
9. End immigration detention
10. Restore Pell Grant access

## Recent Constitutional Amendments

### State-Level Changes

| Year | State | Action | Result |
|------|-------|--------|--------|
| 2018 | Colorado | Remove slavery exception | Passed (65%) |
| 2020 | Nebraska | Remove slavery exception | Passed (68%) |
| 2020 | Utah | Remove slavery exception | Passed (80%) |
| 2022 | Alabama | Remove slavery language | Passed (77%) |
| 2022 | Oregon | Remove slavery exception | Passed (55%) |
| 2022 | Tennessee | Remove slavery exception | Passed (79%) |
| 2022 | Vermont | Prohibit slavery entirely | Passed (89%) |
| 2022 | Louisiana | Remove slavery exception | Failed (confusing ballot) |

### Impact of State Amendments

Most state amendments have been **symbolic rather than substantive**:

- Courts have generally not interpreted new language as requiring changes to prison labor
- Implementation legislation rarely follows
- Litigation ongoing in several states
- Some states explicitly exempted prison labor from new provisions

## Lessons from History

### Patterns That Persist

| Historical Pattern | Modern Manifestation |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| Racial targeting | Disparate arrest/conviction rates |
| Private profiteering | Private prisons, prison industries |
| Sub-poverty wages | Pennies per hour or nothing |
| Dangerous conditions | Agricultural, firefighting, manufacturing |
| Resistance and strikes | National Prison Strike movement |
| Inadequate reform | Symbolic amendments without implementation |

### What History Teaches

1. **The exception clause was designed to maintain forced labor** - It worked as intended
2. **Private profit incentivizes exploitation** - From convict leasing to PIECP
3. **Reform requires sustained pressure** - Convict leasing took decades to end
4. **Symbolic changes are insufficient** - Constitutional amendments require implementation
5. **Incarcerated people have always resisted** - Worker agency must be centered
