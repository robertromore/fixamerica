# Prison Labor Reform: Overview

Prison labor in the United States operates under a constitutional exception that permits involuntary servitude as punishment for crime. The 13th Amendment, ratified in 1865 to abolish slavery, contains a clause that has enabled the development of a multi-billion dollar prison labor industry. Nearly 800,000 incarcerated individuals work in American prisons, many earning pennies per hour or nothing at all, producing goods and services for government agencies and private corporations. This system raises fundamental questions about exploitation, human rights, and the legacy of slavery in America.
