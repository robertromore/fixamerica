## Trade-offs

### Reform Speed vs. Political Sustainability

**Risk**: Moving too fast creates backlash
**Balance**: Build evidence base, start with winnable reforms

### Individual Accountability vs. Systemic Focus

**Risk**: Losing focus on personal responsibility
**Balance**: Both matter; accountability without cruelty

### Victim Needs vs. Offender Needs

**Risk**: Zero-sum framing
**Balance**: Both served by prevention, accountability, healing

### Local Control vs. National Standards

**Risk**: Inconsistency, race to bottom
**Balance**: Federal floor with local innovation

### Immediate Release vs. Graduated Reentry

**Risk**: Inadequate support increases failure
**Balance**: Pre-release planning, robust reentry services

## Implementation Considerations

### Sequencing

1. End worst practices (solitary, cash bail)
2. Build alternatives (pretrial services, diversion)
3. Reduce sentences (mandatory minimums, parole)
4. Address root causes (poverty, education, health)
5. Transform culture (training, accountability)

### Reinvestment

- Savings from reduced incarceration
- Invest in affected communities
- Fund alternatives
- Prevention spending

### Measurement
