# Surveillance Technology in Criminal Justice: Overview

## Executive Summary

Surveillance technology has fundamentally transformed American policing over the past two decades, creating an unprecedented capacity for government monitoring of citizens. From facial recognition systems that can identify individuals in crowds to predictive policing algorithms that claim to forecast crime, these technologies raise profound questions about privacy, civil liberties, and the relationship between communities and law enforcement. Despite their widespread deployment, many of these systems operate with minimal oversight, questionable accuracy, and documented racial bias—disproportionately impacting communities of color while providing limited evidence of public safety benefits.

## Scope of This Document

This resource examines the major categories of surveillance technology currently deployed by law enforcement agencies across the United States, including:

- **Biometric identification**: Facial recognition, iris scanning, gait analysis
- **Location tracking**: License plate readers, cell site simulators, GPS monitoring
- **Predictive systems**: Algorithmic policing, risk assessment tools
- **Communication surveillance**: Social media monitoring, electronic interception
- **Audio/visual monitoring**: Body cameras, gunshot detection, drone surveillance
- **Private-public partnerships**: Ring/Neighbors, private camera networks

## Key Statistics

| Category | Statistic | Source |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Facial Recognition | 1 in 2 American adults are in a law enforcement face recognition database | Georgetown Law Center on Privacy & Technology |
| License Plate Readers | Over 2.5 billion license plate scans collected annually by law enforcement | ACLU |
| Predictive Policing | At least 60 major police departments have used predictive policing software | Brennan Center for Justice |
| Ring Partnerships | Over 2,000 police departments have Ring/Neighbors partnerships | Electronic Frontier Foundation |
| ShotSpotter | Deployed in 130+ cities covering 1,100+ square miles | SoundThinking (formerly ShotSpotter) |
| Cell Site Simulators | At least 75 federal, state, and local agencies use Stingray devices | ACLU |
| Body Cameras | 80% of large police departments have body camera programs | Bureau of Justice Statistics |
| Social Media Monitoring | At least 500+ law enforcement agencies monitor social media | Brennan Center |

## Core Problems

### 1. Accuracy and Reliability Concerns

Many surveillance technologies suffer from significant accuracy problems that have real-world consequences:

- **Facial recognition error rates**: Studies show error rates up to 35% for dark-skinned women compared to 0.8% for light-skinned men
- **ShotSpotter false positives**: Independent analyses suggest 80-90% of alerts do not result in evidence of gunfire
- **Predictive policing feedback loops**: Algorithms trained on biased historical data perpetuate and amplify existing disparities

### 2. Racial Disparities and Algorithmic Bias

Surveillance technologies consistently demonstrate patterns of racial bias:

- Facial recognition systems misidentify Black and brown individuals at significantly higher rates
- Predictive policing concentrates enforcement in communities of color based on historically biased policing data
- License plate reader deployments often focus on low-income and minority neighborhoods

### 3. Constitutional Concerns

Surveillance technology raises serious constitutional questions:

- **Fourth Amendment**: Traditional warrant requirements struggle to address digital-age surveillance
- **First Amendment**: Surveillance of protests, religious gatherings, and political organizing chills free expression
- **Due Process**: Proprietary algorithms prevent defendants from challenging evidence against them

### 4. Lack of Oversight and Transparency

The surveillance technology ecosystem operates with minimal accountability:

- Many technologies are acquired through federal grants or asset forfeiture without public debate
- Vendor non-disclosure agreements prevent public scrutiny of accuracy claims
- Few jurisdictions have comprehensive surveillance oversight ordinances

### 5. Mission Creep and Data Retention

Technologies deployed for specific purposes often expand far beyond their original scope:

- License plate data collected for parking enforcement becomes permanent surveillance databases
- Body cameras intended for accountability become tools for facial recognition
- COVID-19 contact tracing infrastructure repurposed for immigration enforcement

### 6. Democratic Deficit

Communities most impacted by surveillance often have the least say in its deployment:

- Technology acquisitions frequently bypass normal procurement processes
- Affected communities rarely consulted before deployment
- No meaningful mechanisms for public input on surveillance policy

## The Stakes

The unchecked expansion of surveillance technology threatens to create a society of permanent monitoring where:

- Every public movement is tracked and recorded
- Algorithms determine who receives police attention
- Constitutional protections become obsolete
- Community-police trust erodes further
- Vulnerable populations face heightened targeting
- Democratic participation is chilled by fear of surveillance

## Path Forward

Addressing surveillance technology requires a comprehensive approach:

1. **Community control**: Democratic processes for approving surveillance acquisitions
2. **Transparency**: Mandatory disclosure of capabilities, use policies, and outcomes
3. **Accountability**: Independent oversight with enforcement power
4. **Standards**: Evidence-based requirements before deployment
5. **Rights protection**: Strong legal frameworks protecting civil liberties
6. **Vendor responsibility**: Ending secrecy agreements that prevent public scrutiny
