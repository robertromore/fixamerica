## Core Opposition Arguments

### Public Safety Arguments

| Argument | Claim | Counter-Evidence |
|----------|-------|------------------|
| "Surveillance reduces crime" | Technology prevents and solves crimes | Limited evidence of crime reduction; displacement effects |
| "Facial recognition finds criminals" | Identifies suspects efficiently | High error rates, false arrests, minimal proven effectiveness |
| "Predictive policing prevents crime" | Algorithms forecast crime locations | Creates self-fulfilling prophecies, no proven reduction |
| "ShotSpotter saves lives" | Faster response to shootings | 80-90% false positive rates, no evidence of saved lives |
| "ALPRs solve crimes" | Track criminal vehicles | 99%+ of plates scanned are innocent; limited solve rates |
| "Body cameras improve accountability" | Provides objective record | Officers control activation; footage often unavailable |

### Operational Necessity Arguments

| Argument | Claim | Counter-Evidence |
|----------|-------|------------------|
| "Police need these tools" | Essential for modern policing | Policed effectively before these technologies |
| "Criminals have technology" | Need to keep pace | False equivalence; surveillance reaches all citizens |
| "Data helps investigations" | Solves more cases | Case clearance rates have not improved with surveillance |
| "Efficiency requires surveillance" | Force multiplier | Diverts resources from proven approaches |

### Slippery Slope Arguments

| Argument | Claim | Counter-Evidence |
|----------|-------|------------------|
| "If we ban facial recognition, what's next?" | Any limit leads to total bans | Targeted regulations are common and effective |
| "Criminals will exploit limits" | Restrictions help criminals | No evidence restrictions increase crime |
| "Other countries will out-compete us" | Technology race necessity | Democratic nations regulate surveillance |

### Constitutional Arguments

| Argument | Claim | Counter-Evidence |
|----------|-------|------------------|
| "No expectation of privacy in public" | Surveillance is legal | Aggregated surveillance is qualitatively different |
| "Third-party doctrine applies" | Data shared is not protected | Carpenter v. United States limited this |
| "Existing laws are sufficient" | No new regulations needed | Laws drafted before current technology |

## Specific Industry Defense Strategies

### Facial Recognition Industry

| Strategy | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| Accuracy improvement claims | Publicize improved benchmarks (on controlled tests) |
| "Responsible use" framing | Propose industry guidelines instead of laws |
| Differentiate from competitors | "We're not Clearview AI" |
| Emphasize positive uses | Missing children, trafficking (minimal actual use) |
| Delay through standards | Push for more studies, testing standards |

### Predictive Policing Industry

| Strategy | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| Rebrand as "analytics" | Avoid "predictive policing" term |
| Academic partnerships | Fund supportive research |
| Proprietary protection | Refuse algorithm disclosure |
| Blame users | "Tool is neutral, users responsible" |
| Shift to risk assessment | Move from place-based to person-based |

### ShotSpotter/SoundThinking

## Common Misinformation

### False Claims About Surveillance Effectiveness

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| "Facial recognition has 99% accuracy" | Error rates up to 35% for dark-skinned women |
| "ShotSpotter is 97% accurate" | Independent studies show 80-90% false positives |
| "Predictive policing reduces crime 20%" | No rigorous studies support this; often increases arrests |
| "ALPRs solve crimes daily" | Vast majority of hits are administrative, not criminal |
| "Body cameras reduce use of force" | Studies show mixed results, declining over time |

### False Claims About Regulation

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| "Bans would be unconstitutional" | Multiple bans upheld; no successful challenges |
| "Regulation would hamper innovation" | Regulated industries continue innovating |
| "Only criminals benefit from restrictions" | All citizens benefit from privacy protections |
| "Police would be handcuffed" | Policing continued in ban cities |
| "Vendors would leave the market" | Vendors adapt to regulation |
