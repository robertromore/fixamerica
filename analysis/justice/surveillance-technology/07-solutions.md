# Surveillance Technology in Criminal Justice: Solutions

## Introduction

Addressing the harms of surveillance technology in criminal justice requires a comprehensive approach combining outright bans on the most dangerous technologies, strong oversight mechanisms for those that remain, robust transparency requirements, and fundamental shifts in how communities govern police technology. This document outlines the full range of reform proposals and their relative strengths.
