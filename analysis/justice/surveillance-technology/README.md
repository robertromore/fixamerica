# Surveillance Technology in Criminal Justice: Overview

Surveillance technology has fundamentally transformed American policing over the past two decades, creating an unprecedented capacity for government monitoring of citizens. From facial recognition systems that can identify individuals in crowds to predictive policing algorithms that claim to forecast crime, these technologies raise profound questions about privacy, civil liberties, and the relationship between communities and law enforcement. Despite their widespread deployment, many of these systems operate with minimal oversight, questionable accuracy, and documented racial bias—disproportionately impacting communities of color while providing limited evidence of public safety benefits.
