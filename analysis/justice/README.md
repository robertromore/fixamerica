# Criminal Justice Reform: Overview

The American criminal justice system is in crisis. The United States incarcerates more people than any other nation—both in absolute numbers and per capita. Racial disparities permeate every stage of the system, from policing to prosecution to sentencing. Prisons fail to rehabilitate, and those released face barriers that virtually guarantee recidivism. Meanwhile, victims often find the system re-traumatizing rather than healing, and communities most affected by crime are also most harmed by aggressive enforcement.
