# Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform

## Executive Summary

Civil asset forfeiture allows law enforcement to seize property suspected of being connected to criminal activity—often without charging the owner with any crime. Originally designed to disrupt organized crime and drug trafficking, this practice has expanded dramatically, creating a system where innocent Americans can lose their cash, cars, and homes based on mere suspicion, with the burden falling on them to prove their innocence.

This represents one of the most significant due process failures in American law. Each year, federal and state agencies seize billions of dollars in assets from citizens, with law enforcement agencies directly benefiting from the proceeds. This creates perverse incentives that prioritize revenue generation over justice.

| Median cash seizure (DEA highways) | $1,976 | DOJ OIG 2017 |
| Seizures under $1,000 | 60%+ | Multiple state audits |
| Property returned to owners | ~1% | Various state data |
| Average time to contest forfeiture | 1-2 years | Legal aid organizations |
| Cost to contest $500 seizure | $2,000-10,000 | Attorney fee estimates |

## Core Problems

### 1. Inverted Due Process

Unlike criminal proceedings where the government must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, civil forfeiture requires property owners to prove their innocence. The standard of proof is often "preponderance of evidence" (more likely than not) or even lower.

### 2. Policing for Profit

Law enforcement agencies that seize property typically keep 80-100% of the proceeds. This creates direct financial incentives to seize property, corrupting the mission of law enforcement.

### 3. No Crime Required

Property can be seized based on suspicion alone. Owners need not be arrested, charged, or convicted of any crime to lose their property permanently.

### 4. Legal Representation Challenges

There is no right to appointed counsel in civil forfeiture cases. Challenging a seizure often costs more than the property is worth, leading most people to abandon their claims.

### 5. Structural Barriers

- Short deadlines to file claims (often 30-35 days)
- Complex procedural requirements
- Filing fees and bonds required in some jurisdictions
- Cases heard in civil court without jury rights in many states

### 6. Racial and Economic Disparities

Forfeiture disproportionately impacts Black and Latino communities, and primarily affects those with limited financial resources who cannot afford to fight seizures.

### 7. Equitable Sharing Loophole

The federal "equitable sharing" program allows state and local agencies to circumvent stronger state protections by partnering with federal agencies, receiving up to 80% of seized assets.

## The Human Cost

Civil forfeiture destroys lives:

- **Small business owners** lose operating capital with no recourse
- **Travelers** have life savings seized during traffic stops
- **Homeowners** lose properties due to relatives' alleged activities
- **Families** are torn apart fighting to recover essential assets
- **Communities** lose trust in law enforcement

## Reform Imperative

Meaningful reform requires:

1. **Conviction requirement** before forfeiture
2. **Burden shift** to government to prove property connection to crime
3. **Abolition of equitable sharing** for states with stronger protections
4. **Independent disposition** of forfeiture proceeds (general fund, not police budgets)
5. **Enhanced reporting** and transparency requirements
6. **Right to counsel** for contested forfeitures
7. **Innocent owner protections** codified and strengthened
