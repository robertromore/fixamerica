# History of Civil Asset Forfeiture

## Overview

Civil asset forfeiture has deep historical roots, but its modern incarnation as a tool of domestic law enforcement is relatively recent. Understanding this history reveals how a narrow legal doctrine expanded into a system that now seizes billions of dollars annually from American citizens.

## Ancient and Maritime Origins

### English Common Law

| Era | Development | Purpose |
|-----|-------------|---------|
| Medieval | Deodand doctrine | Property causing death forfeited to Crown |
| 13th Century | Admiralty law | Ships engaged in piracy seized |
| Colonial Era | Navigation Acts | Smuggling vessels forfeited |

The legal fiction of proceeding against property (in rem) rather than persons (in personam) developed because:

- Ships often operated in international waters beyond jurisdiction
- Owners might be foreign nationals or unknown
- Property itself was deemed "guilty" of wrongdoing

### American Founding Era

| Year | Development | Significance |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| 1789 | First Congress | Authorized seizure of ships violating customs laws |
| 1790s | Embargo enforcement | Forfeiture used against smugglers |
| 1861 | Civil War | Confederate property seized |
| 1862 | Confiscation Acts | Property of rebels forfeited |

The Founders accepted limited forfeiture for customs and admiralty purposes but would not have recognized modern domestic asset forfeiture.

## Prohibition Era Expansion

### 1920s-1930s

| Development | Impact |
|-------------|--------|
| Volstead Act (1919) | Allowed seizure of vehicles transporting alcohol |
| Rum-running enforcement | Boats, cars, and trucks routinely seized |
| Precedent established | Vehicles as "instrumentalities" of crime |

Key case: **J.W. Goldsmith Jr.-Grant Co. v. United States (1921)**

- Supreme Court upheld seizure of innocent owner's car
- Used to transport liquor without owner's knowledge
- Established harmful "innocent owner" doctrine

## Civil Rights Era

### 1960s Developments

The Supreme Court began questioning forfeiture practices:

| Case | Year | Holding |
|------|------|---------|
| *One 1958 Plymouth Sedan v. Pennsylvania* | 1965 | Fourth Amendment applies to forfeiture |
| *Boyd v. United States* | 1886 (cited) | Forfeiture has "quasi-criminal" nature |

## The Drug War Catalyst

### Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act (1970)

| Provision | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Forfeiture of drugs | Direct authority |
| Forfeiture of proceeds | Extended to profits |
| Forfeiture of instrumentalities | Vehicles, equipment |
| Federal enforcement | DEA creation (1973) |

### The Transformation: 1978-1984

| Year | Legislation | Key Changes |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| 1978 | Psychotropic Substances Act | Real property added |
| 1981 | DOJ policy change | Agencies keep seized funds |
| 1984 | Comprehensive Crime Control Act | Created modern forfeiture system |

## The 1984 Revolution

The **Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984** fundamentally transformed civil asset forfeiture:

### Key Provisions

| Change | Before 1984 | After 1984 |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Forfeiture proceeds | Treasury general fund | DOJ Assets Forfeiture Fund |
| Agency benefit | None direct | Direct budget supplement |
| Equitable sharing | Not established | State/local get up to 80% |
| Scope | Drugs only | Expanded offenses |

### The Equitable Sharing Program

Created to:

- Encourage federal-state cooperation
- Bypass state forfeiture restrictions
- Share proceeds with participating agencies

| Year | Equitable Sharing Total |
|------|------------------------|
| 1985 | $27 million |
| 1990 | $262 million |
| 1995 | $291 million |
| 2000 | $458 million |

## Expansion Through the 1990s

### Legislative Expansion

| Year | Law | Expansion |
|------|-----|-----------|
| 1986 | Money Laundering Control Act | Financial crimes |
| 1988 | Anti-Drug Abuse Act | Enhanced penalties |
| 1992 | Annunzio-Wylie Act | Bank fraud |
| 1994 | Violent Crime Control Act | Broader application |

### Forfeiture Growth

| Year | Federal Forfeitures | Primary Driver |
|------|--------------------|-----------------|
| 1985 | $27 million | Nascent program |
| 1990 | $460 million | Drug war expansion |
| 1995 | $675 million | Continued growth |
| 2000 | $975 million | Pre-reform peak |

## Supreme Court Intervention

### Key Cases Limiting Forfeiture

| Case | Year | Holding |
|------|------|---------|
| *Austin v. United States* | 1993 | Excessive Fines Clause applies |
| *United States v. James Daniel Good* | 1993 | Pre-seizure hearing required for real property |
| *Bennis v. Michigan* | 1996 | Innocent owner defense not constitutionally required |
| *United States v. Ursery* | 1996 | Forfeiture not double jeopardy |
| *Timbs v. Indiana* | 2019 | Excessive Fines Clause applies to states |

## The Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000

### First Major Federal Reform

| Reform | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Burden shift | Government must prove connection |
| Innocent owner | Defense codified (but limited) |
| Counsel provision | In some cases |
| Hardship provisions | Release of property pending trial |

### Limitations of CAFRA

| Issue | Problem |
|-------|---------|
| Equitable sharing | Untouched |
| Incentive structure | Agencies still keep funds |
| Standard of proof | Still preponderance |
| Administrative forfeiture | Remained for small seizures |
| Practical barriers | High costs still deterred challenges |

## Post-9/11 Era

### Expansion in Counter-Terrorism

| Year | Development | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 2001 | USA PATRIOT Act | Terrorism-related forfeiture expanded |
| 2002 | Homeland Security Act | New agencies with forfeiture authority |
| 2005 | Focus shift | Drug war funding maintained |

### Forfeiture Growth Continues

| Year | DOJ Fund | Treasury Fund |
|------|----------|---------------|
| 2005 | $1.1 billion | $490 million |
| 2008 | $1.3 billion | $630 million |
| 2012 | $4.2 billion | $1.8 billion |
| 2014 | $4.5 billion | $2.1 billion |

## Modern Reform Era (2014-Present)

### Public Awareness Catalyst

| Event | Year | Impact |
|-------|------|--------|
| Washington Post "Stop and Seize" series | 2014 | National attention |
| Last Week Tonight segment | 2014 | Viral awareness |
| Institute for Justice "Policing for Profit" | 2010, 2015, 2020 | Comprehensive documentation |

### State Reform Wave

| Period | States Reforming | Key Reforms |
|--------|-----------------|-------------|
| 2014-2016 | 18 | Conviction requirements, reporting |
| 2017-2019 | 12 | Burden shift, transparency |
| 2020-2024 | 8 | Additional protections |

### Federal Developments

| Year | Action | Effect |
|------|--------|--------|
| 2015 | Holder limits equitable sharing | Reduced adoptive forfeitures |
| 2017 | Sessions restores program | Rolled back Holder reforms |
| 2021 | DOJ review announced | Limited changes implemented |

## Key Historical Patterns

### The Ratchet Effect

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Financial incentive | Agencies become dependent on forfeiture revenue |
| Mission creep | Forfeiture applied to more offenses |
| Path dependency | Institutional resistance to reform |
| Federal override | Equitable sharing undermines state reforms |

### Cycles of Reform and Retrenchment

| Era | Reform Pressure | Law Enforcement Response |
|-----|-----------------|-------------------------|
| 1990s | Supreme Court limits | CAFRA compromise |
| 2000s | CAFRA reforms | Equitable sharing expansion |
| 2010s | State reforms | Increased federal adoption |
| 2020s | Continued reform | Institutional resistance |

## Lessons from History

1. **Financial incentives drive expansion** - When agencies keep proceeds, seizures increase
2. **Federal programs undermine state reforms** - Equitable sharing is the critical loophole
3. **Reform requires structural change** - Procedural tweaks are insufficient
4. **Public attention matters** - Major reforms follow media coverage
5. **Bipartisan coalition essential** - Reform unites civil liberties left and property rights right
