# Current State of Civil Asset Forfeiture

## Overview

Civil asset forfeiture in America operates through a patchwork of federal, state, and local laws with widely varying protections for property owners. Despite growing public awareness and reform efforts, billions of dollars in property continue to be seized annually, often from individuals never charged with crimes.
