# Model Legislation for Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform

## Overview

This document provides model legislation for reforming civil asset forfeiture at both federal and state levels. The legislation addresses the core problems identified in this document series: the lack of conviction requirement, inverted burden of proof, profit motive, equitable sharing loophole, and transparency deficits.

---

## FEDERAL LEGISLATION

### DUE PROCESS RESTORATION ACT

```
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Due Process Restoration Act."

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(a) Civil asset forfeiture allows the government to permanently 
deprive citizens of their property without requiring a criminal 
conviction.

(b) The current civil forfeiture system places the burden of proof 
on property owners to prove their innocence, inverting the 
fundamental presumption of innocence.

(c) Federal law allows law enforcement agencies to retain the 
proceeds of forfeiture, creating a profit motive that perverts 
the mission of law enforcement.

(d) The equitable sharing program enables state and local agencies 
to circumvent stronger state forfeiture laws by partnering with 
federal agencies.

(e) Forfeiture disproportionately impacts low-income individuals 
and communities of color.

(f) The lack of comprehensive reporting requirements prevents 
meaningful oversight and accountability.

(g) These practices violate the due process and property rights 
protected by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the 
Constitution.

SEC. 3. CRIMINAL CONVICTION REQUIRED.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 981 of title 18, United States Code, is 
amended by adding at the end the following:

"(l) CONVICTION REQUIRED.—No property may be forfeited under this 
section unless the owner of the property is convicted of a criminal 
offense to which the forfeiture relates. A criminal conviction may be 
obtained as part of the same proceeding in which forfeiture is sought 
or in a separate proceeding.

"(m) EXCEPTIONS.—Subsection (l) shall not apply where—
    "(1) the owner of the property cannot be identified after 
    reasonable effort;
    "(2) the owner of the property is deceased;
    "(3) the owner of the property has fled the jurisdiction 
    to avoid prosecution;
    "(4) the owner of the property is a fugitive from justice; or
    "(5) the property has been abandoned."

SEC. 4. BURDEN OF PROOF.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 983 of title 18, United States Code, is 
amended—
    (1) in striking "preponderance of the evidence" each place 
    it appears and inserting "clear and convincing evidence"; and
    (2) by adding at the end of subsection (c) the following:
    "(5) The burden of proof shall rest with the Government at 
    all stages of forfeiture proceedings."

SEC. 5. INNOCENT OWNER DEFENSE.

(a) Section 983(d) of title 18, United States Code, is amended—
    (1) by striking "the claimant" each place it appears and 
    inserting "the Government shall prove by clear and convincing 
    evidence that the claimant"; and
    (2) by adding at the end the following:
    "(7) In any case in which a claimant is the owner of a 
    primary residence, the Government must prove by clear and 
    convincing evidence that the claimant—
        "(A) had actual knowledge that the property was being 
        used for criminal activity; and
        "(B) actively participated in or consented to such 
        criminal activity."

SEC. 6. DISPOSITION OF FORFEITED PROPERTY.

(a) IN GENERAL.—All property forfeited under federal law shall be 
deposited in the General Fund of the Treasury.

(b) ELIMINATION OF DIRECT RECEIPT.—No federal, state, or local law 
enforcement agency may receive, directly or indirectly, any 
proceeds from the forfeiture of property seized by that agency.

(c) FUNDING.—Law enforcement operations shall be funded through 
regular appropriations processes.

SEC. 7. EQUITABLE SHARING REFORM.

(a) PROHIBITION.—The Attorney General and the Secretary of the 
Treasury shall not transfer any forfeited property, or proceeds 
from the sale of forfeited property, to any state or local law 
enforcement agency unless—
    (1) the property was seized pursuant to a joint investigation 
    initiated by a federal agency prior to the seizure;
    (2) the investigation is part of an organized federal task 
    force addressing multi-state criminal activity;
    (3) the value of the property exceeds $100,000; and
    (4) the property was seized in compliance with the forfeiture 
    laws of the state in which the seizure occurred.

(b) REIMBURSEMENT LIMITATION.—Any transfer under subsection (a) 
shall be limited to reimbursement for actual, documented expenses 
incurred by state or local agencies in direct furtherance of the 
federal investigation.

SEC. 8. RIGHT TO COUNSEL.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Any person whose property is subject to federal 
forfeiture proceedings shall have the right to representation by 
counsel.

(b) APPOINTMENT.—If a person is unable to afford counsel, the court 
shall appoint counsel at government expense, provided that—
    (1) the value of the property exceeds the person's income 
    for one month; or

engages in forfeiture activities shall submit quarterly reports 
to Congress containing—
    (1) the total number and value of seizures;
    (2) the type of property seized;

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

This section identifies potential weaknesses in forfeiture reform legislation and provides recommendations for strengthening reforms.

### Common Legislative Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Impact | Rectification |
|----------|-------------|--------|---------------|
| Structuring exception | Allows seizure for suspected structuring without conviction | Circumvents conviction requirement | Require conviction for all forfeiture types, including structuring |
| Drug residue exception | Permits seizure based on drug dog alerts or residue | Low-level seizures continue | Prohibit forfeiture based solely on residue or K-9 alerts |
| Expedited forfeiture | Fast-track procedures for small seizures bypass protections | Most seizures use expedited process | Apply all protections regardless of value |
| Equitable sharing workaround | Federal partnership circumvents state law | Nullifies state reform | Strict prohibition with penalties for agencies |
| Fugitive exception | Broad definition of "fugitive" allows seizure without trial | Abuse through delayed charges | Narrow definition; require active federal warrant |
| Abandoned property exception | Property declared "abandoned" if not claimed quickly | Short deadlines create forfeitures | 180-day minimum for abandonment determination |
| Third-party transfers | Property transferred before seizure not recoverable | Innocent transferees harmed | Good faith purchaser protections |
| Consent forfeitures | Waivers obtained without counsel | Uninformed consent | Require counsel for all waivers |
| Administrative forfeiture survival | Non-judicial process continues for small seizures | Bulk of seizures unaffected | Eliminate administrative forfeiture |
| Insufficient reporting | Weak penalties for non-compliance | Data gaps persist | Automatic property return for non-reporting |

### Shortcomings in Existing Reforms

| Shortcoming | States Affected | Impact | Rectification |
|-------------|-----------------|--------|---------------|
| Value thresholds | CA ($40k), others | Large seizures still civil forfeiture | No value threshold; conviction for all |
| Exception for certain offenses | Multiple | Drug offenses treated differently | Uniform standard for all offenses |
| Weak burden standard | Many | Preponderance still applies | Clear and convincing minimum |
| Limited to drug offenses | Some states | Other forfeitures unaffected | Comprehensive coverage |
| No right to counsel | Most states | Low-income owners cannot contest | Mandatory appointed counsel |
| Retained equitable sharing | Most states | Federal loophole remains | Complete prohibition with enforcement |
| Partial proceeds retention | Some reform states | Reduced but present incentive | Zero retention by law enforcement |
| Inadequate reporting penalties | Most states | Non-compliance common | Strong enforcement mechanisms |
| No private right of action | Most states | Victims cannot sue for violations | Allow civil suits, fee shifting |
| No retroactivity | All states | Pending cases unaffected | Apply to all pending cases |

### Enforcement Weaknesses

| Weakness | Problem | Impact | Rectification |
|----------|---------|--------|---------------|
| No oversight body | No entity monitors compliance | Violations undetected | Create Inspector General or ombudsman |
| No individual liability | Officers not personally accountable | No deterrent | Remove qualified immunity for forfeiture violations |
| Agency self-reporting | Fox guarding henhouse | Incomplete/inaccurate data | Independent auditing |
| No victim notification | Reforms don't help unaware victims | Low challenge rates | Mandatory notification with counsel referral |
| Weak remedies | Property returned without compensation | Victims still harmed | Damages, interest, attorneys' fees |
| No pattern analysis | Systemic abuse undetected | Problems continue | Required disparity analysis |

### Recommended Strengthening Provisions

| Provision | Purpose | Model Language |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| Anti-circumvention clause | Prevent creative workarounds | "No property shall be forfeited through any means that bypasses the requirements of this Act" |
| Fee-shifting | Deter frivolous seizures | "The state shall pay reasonable attorney's fees and costs to any owner who prevails in whole or in part" |
| Interest on returned property | Compensate for deprivation | "Property returned to an owner shall include interest at the legal rate from date of seizure" |
| Supervisory approval | Prevent individual officer abuse | "No seizure for forfeiture shall occur without written approval from a supervisor" |
| Training requirement | Ensure proper procedures | "Officers engaged in forfeiture activities shall complete annual training on constitutional requirements" |
| Pattern tracking | Identify problematic practices | "The agency shall track and report seizure patterns by officer, location, and demographic factors" |
| Sunset provision | Force regular review | "This Act shall be reviewed and reauthorized by the Legislature every five years" |

### Implementation Verification

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Conviction rate for forfeitures | 100% (with exceptions) | Annual audit |
| Return rate for challenges | >50% | Database tracking |
| Reporting compliance | 100% | Quarterly review |
| Equitable sharing participation | 0 (with exceptions) | Federal data |
| Demographic parity | No significant disparity | Annual analysis |
| Average time to resolution | <90 days | Case tracking |
| Counsel appointment rate | 100% of eligible | Court data |
| Agency revenue from forfeiture | $0 | Budget audit |
