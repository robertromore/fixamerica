## Common Opposition Arguments

### Public Safety Claims

| Argument | Claim | Reality |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Disrupts criminal enterprises | Forfeiture cripples drug operations | Most seizures are small, individual |
| Deters crime | Threat of forfeiture reduces crime | No empirical evidence |
| Removes tools of crime | Vehicles/property enable crime | Often seizes innocent owner property |
| Protects communities | Keeps dangerous property away | Property returned to community anyway |

### Operational Necessity Claims

| Argument | Claim | Reality |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Self-funding enforcement | No taxpayer burden | Creates perverse profit motive |
| Essential equipment | Provides critical resources | Agencies survived before forfeiture expansion |
| Task force funding | Enables collaboration | Creates dependency on seizures |
| Immediate disruption | Can act without conviction | Due process violation |

### Practical Concerns

| Argument | Claim | Reality |
|----------|-------|---------|
| Conviction requirement impractical | Criminals flee, die, are unknown | Criminal forfeiture already exists |
| Administrative burden | Reporting requirements costly | Transparency is fundamental to accountability |
| Court system overload | More contested cases | Most forfeitures go uncontested |
| Evidence problems | Hard to prove after acquittal | Standard shouldn't be lower than criminal |

### Slippery Slope Arguments

|----------|-------|---------|
| Will eliminate all forfeiture | Reform leads to abolition | Criminal forfeiture preserved |
| Criminals will win | Less seizure means more crime | No evidence from reform states |
| Officer safety threatened | Officers hesitate to seize | Standard enforcement continues |

## Opposition Arguments Analyzed

### "Forfeiture Is Essential for Fighting Drug Trafficking"

| Disrupts drug markets | No studies show market impact | Unproven |
| Seizes cartel assets | Most seizures under $1,000 | Misleading |

### "Reform States Have Seen Crime Increases"

| State | Reform Year | Crime Trend Post-Reform |
|-------|-------------|------------------------|
| New Mexico | 2015 | Continued decline |

### "Innocent Owners Are Protected"

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| Owners can contest | Must hire attorney, costs exceed value |
| Burden is reasonable | Owner must prove innocence |
| Courts are fair | Systemic bias toward government |
| Administrative process works | Designed to discourage challenges |

### "We Only Take Property from Criminals"

| Fact | Implication |
|------|-------------|

| Conviction rate for forfeiture subjects | Substantially lower than forfeiture rate |
| Property returned | Less than 1% of seized property |
