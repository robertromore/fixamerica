# Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform

Civil asset forfeiture allows law enforcement to seize property suspected of being connected to criminal activity—often without charging the owner with any crime. Originally designed to disrupt organized crime and drug trafficking, this practice has expanded dramatically, creating a system where innocent Americans can lose their cash, cars, and homes based on mere suspicion, with the burden falling on them to prove their innocence.
