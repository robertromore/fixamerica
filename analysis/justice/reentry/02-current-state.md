# Reentry Reform: Current State

## Recidivism Rates

### National Recidivism Data

Recidivism—measured variously as rearrest, reconviction, or reincarceration—remains stubbornly high in the United States, indicating systemic failures in reentry support and persistent barriers to successful reintegration.

| Timeframe | Rearrest Rate | Reconviction Rate | Reincarceration Rate |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| 1 year | 44% | 23% | 17% |
| 3 years | 68% | 47% | 39% |
| 5 years | 77% | 56% | 44% |
| 9 years | 83% | 64% | 49% |

### Variation by Offense Type

| Offense Category | 5-Year Rearrest Rate |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Property | 82% |
| Drug | 77% |
| Public order | 74% |
| Violent | 71% |

### Variation by Demographics

| Factor | Higher Recidivism | Lower Recidivism |
|--------|-------------------|------------------|
| Age at release | Under 24: 84% | Over 40: 69% |
| Prior arrests | 10+: 87% | First offense: 55% |
| Gender | Male: 78% | Female: 68% |
| Time served | Under 1 year: Higher | Longer sentences: Slightly lower |

## Employment Barriers

### The Employment Crisis

Post-incarceration unemployment is a primary driver of recidivism. A criminal record reduces callback rates for employment by approximately 50%, with even greater disparities for Black applicants.

| Metric | Data |
|--------|------|
| Unemployment rate (post-release) | 27% |
| Reduction in annual earnings | 40% |
| Callback rate reduction (white applicants) | 50% |
| Callback rate reduction (Black applicants) | 60-70% |
| Jobs requiring background checks | 92% |
| Employers willing to hire (survey) | 40% |

### Occupational Licensing Barriers

Over 30% of American workers require occupational licenses. Many licensing boards impose blanket bans or severely restrict access for people with criminal records.

| Occupation | Licensing Barrier Status |
|------------|-------------------------|
| Barber/Cosmetologist | Restricted in 44 states |
| Healthcare aide | Restricted in 50 states |
| Commercial driver | Restricted in all states |
| Teacher | Restricted in 50 states |
| Electrician/Plumber | Restricted in 40+ states |
| Real estate | Restricted in 48 states |
| Nursing | Restricted in 50 states |

### Ban the Box Adoption

"Ban the box" policies remove conviction history questions from initial job applications, delaying inquiry until later in the hiring process.

| Jurisdiction Type | Number | Coverage |
|-------------------|--------|----------|
| States (public employers) | 37 | Majority of states |
| States (private employers) | 15 | Limited coverage |
| Cities/Counties | 150+ | Major urban areas |
| Federal government | Yes | Since 2019 |

## Housing Discrimination

### Public Housing Barriers

Federal policy historically encouraged or required exclusion of people with criminal records from public housing. While reforms have occurred, significant barriers remain.

| Barrier Type | Current Status |
|--------------|----------------|
| Drug-related evictions | Discretionary (formerly mandatory) |
| "One-strike" policies | Still common |
| Registered sex offenders | Permanent ban (federal) |
| Methamphetamine production | Permanent ban (federal) |
| Household member restrictions | Still permitted |
| Criminal background screening | Standard practice |

### Private Housing Market

| Barrier | Prevalence |
|---------|------------|
| Background check requirement | 80%+ of landlords |
| Blanket exclusion policies | 40-60% of landlords |
| Higher deposits for people with records | Common |
| Fair housing protections | Limited |

### Homelessness Connection

| Metric | Data |
|--------|------|
| Released to homelessness | 10-15% |
| Homeless at some point post-release | 30%+ |
| Recidivism increase (homeless vs. housed) | 2-3x |
| Transitional housing availability | Meets <10% of need |

## Voting Rights

### Felony Disenfranchisement

An estimated 4.6 million Americans are disenfranchised due to felony convictions, with dramatic racial disparities.

| Disenfranchised Population | Number |
|---------------------------|--------|
| Total disenfranchised | 4.6 million |
| Currently incarcerated | 1.2 million |
| On parole/probation | 1.0 million |
| Post-sentence | 2.4 million |
| Black Americans (rate) | 5.3% of voting-age |
| White Americans (rate) | 1.3% of voting-age |

### State Approaches

| Category | States | Population Affected |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| No disenfranchisement | ME, VT, DC | Allow voting while incarcerated |
| Incarceration only | 22 states | Automatic restoration upon release |
| Includes parole/probation | 16 states | Restoration after supervision |
| Post-sentence waiting period | 9 states | Additional barriers |
| Permanent (some offenses) | 7 states | Lifetime disenfranchisement possible |

### Restoration Process Complexity

| State | Restoration Process |
|-------|-------------------|
| Florida | Complex, requires court petition or clemency |
| Iowa | Governor's executive order (subject to change) |
| Kentucky | Requires governor's pardon |
| Virginia | Individual restoration by governor |
| Mississippi | Requires legislative action for some offenses |

## Public Benefits Restrictions

### SNAP (Food Stamps) Restrictions

The 1996 welfare reform imposed a lifetime ban on SNAP for people with drug felony convictions. States have broad authority to modify or eliminate this ban.

|-----------------|------------------|
| Full ban retained | 3 |
| Modified ban (time limits, conditions) | 24 |
| Fully opted out | 23 + DC |

|-----------------|------------|------------|
| Probation | 3.7 million | 82% |
| Parole | 850,000 | 18% |
| Total | 4.5+ million | -- |

### Supervision Failures

Technical violations—not new crimes—drive a significant portion of prison admissions.

|--------|------|
| Prison admissions from supervision violations | 25% |
| Technical violations (not new crimes) | 45% of revocations |
| Common technical violations | Missed appointments, failed drug tests, curfew |
| Average conditions imposed | 18-20 conditions |

### Supervision Disparities
