# Reentry Reform: Legislation

## Overview

Reentry reform legislation operates across federal, state, and local levels. Federal legislation can establish minimum standards, provide funding, and address federal records. State legislation is crucial for employment barriers, occupational licensing, voting rights, record clearing, and supervision reform. Local ordinances can address housing, hiring, and community-level supports.

This document provides model legislation for the key reentry reform areas with analysis of potential loopholes and rectification procedures.

## Regulatory Framework

### EEOC Criminal Records Guidance

**Authority**: Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964

**Recommended Guidance Update**:

```text
EEOC ENFORCEMENT GUIDANCE ON THE USE OF CRIMINAL RECORDS
IN EMPLOYMENT DECISIONS (UPDATED)

I. BACKGROUND

Criminal record exclusions may constitute unlawful discrimination
under Title VII when they have a disparate impact on protected
groups and are not job-related and consistent with business
necessity.

II. DISPARATE IMPACT

Given persistent racial disparities in the criminal legal system,
criminal record exclusions disproportionately impact Black and
Latino applicants. Employers using criminal history screens bear
the burden of demonstrating job-relatedness and business necessity.

III. JOB-RELATED AND CONSISTENT WITH BUSINESS NECESSITY

To satisfy this standard, employers should:

A. Eliminate blanket exclusion policies;

B. Consider:
(1) The nature and gravity of the offense;
(2) Time elapsed since offense and completion of sentence;
(3) The nature of the job held or sought;

C. Provide individualized assessment before final decisions;

D. Limit consideration to convictions (not arrests);

E. Implement reasonable lookback limits.

IV. BEST PRACTICES

Employers should:
(1) Eliminate criminal history questions from applications;
(2) Delay background checks until conditional offer;
(3) Train HR on fair chance hiring;
(4) Provide notice and opportunity to respond;
(5) Maintain records of decisions for review.

V. ENFORCEMENT

The Commission will actively investigate charges alleging
disparate impact from criminal record policies and will
use enforcement authority to address systemic violations.
```

### HUD Fair Chance Housing Guidance

Act if they have an unjustified discriminatory effect.

III. BEST PRACTICES FOR PHAs

A. Eliminate blanket exclusions except where required by law;
B. Limit lookback periods to 3-5 years;
C. Conduct individualized assessments;
D. Consider only convictions (not arrests);
E. Consider mitigating factors;
F. Provide notice and opportunity to respond.

IV. PRIVATE HOUSING PROVIDERS

Private landlords using criminal record screens should:
A. Use individualized assessment;
B. Limit to recent, directly relevant convictions;
C. Provide opportunity to explain circumstances;
D. Consider evidence of rehabilitation.

V. ENFORCEMENT

HUD will investigate housing discrimination complaints based
on criminal record policies and pursue enforcement actions
where policies have unjustified disparate impact.
```

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Authority

**Federal Employment Legislation**:

- Commerce Clause: Employment practices affect interstate commerce
- Spending Clause: Conditions on federal contractors and grantees
- 14th Amendment Section 5: Enforce equal protection

**Federal Voting Rights Legislation**:

- 14th Amendment Section 2: Reduction of representation for disenfranchisement
- 15th Amendment: Racial discrimination in voting
- Article I, Section 4: Congressional authority over federal elections
- Spending Clause: Conditions on election administration funding

**Federal Clean Slate**:

- Federal records clearly within federal authority
- Data broker regulation under Commerce Clause

### Preemption

**State Laws More Protective**:

- Federal legislation should establish floor, not ceiling
- States may provide greater protections
- Savings clauses to preserve state authority

**Data Broker Regulation**:

- May need to address state vs. federal authority
- Federal records clearly regulable; state records more complex

### Enforcement Mechanisms

| Level | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| Federal | EEOC enforcement, private litigation, funding conditions |
| State | State AG enforcement, private litigation, administrative |
| Local | City enforcement, private litigation |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Fair Chance Employment Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Exception expansion | Broad interpretation of security/law enforcement exceptions | High |
| Pretext denials | Using other justifications to mask record-based discrimination | High |
| Third-party background check timing | Using preliminary screening services before formal check | Medium |
| Conditional offer manipulation | Making offers insincerely to access record information | Medium |
| Staffing agency workaround | Using temporary agencies not covered by employer definition | High |
| Retaliation | Retaliating against employees who assert rights | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| No address of statistical discrimination | May increase race-based screening when records hidden | Limited scope of antidiscrimination tools |
| EEOC resource constraints | Enforcement backlog | Chronic underfunding |
| Employer liability fears persist | Despite safe harbor | Cultural resistance |
| Small employer exemption | May exclude significant workforce | Political compromise |
| Limited reach to gig economy | Independent contractors not covered | Employment classification issues |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Exception Narrowing**: Require annual certification by agencies seeking exception; create interagency review of exception claims; sunset exceptions after 5 years requiring re-justification.

2. **Anti-Pretext Provisions**: Require employers to document legitimate non-discriminatory reasons contemporaneously; create rebuttable presumption of discrimination when qualified applicant with record rejected.

3. **Third-Party Screening Regulation**: Extend restrictions to consumer reporting agencies and preliminary screening services; prohibit sale of conviction-only products for use before conditional offer.

4. **Conditional Offer Integrity**: Define conditional offer to require genuine intent to hire; create penalty for pattern of withdrawing offers post-background check.

5. **Staffing Agency Coverage**: Expressly define joint employment to cover client companies; require staffing agencies to follow same procedures.

6. **Statistical Discrimination Mitigation**: Combine ban the box with robust anti-discrimination enforcement; require employers to demonstrate non-discriminatory selection procedures; fund research on combined interventions.

### Clean Slate Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Data broker persistence | Private databases retain sealed records | Critical |
| Slow implementation | Delays in automated system development | High |
| Interstate record sharing | Sealed records appear in other states | High |
| Broad exception categories | Exceptions swallow rule | Medium |
| Inaccurate data matching | Wrong person flagged due to name similarity | Medium |
| Fee barriers (petition track) | Indigent individuals cannot access petition relief | Medium |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Retroactive sealing complex | Legacy records in multiple systems | Fragmented databases |
| Private data broker compliance | Cannot effectively enforce | Interstate commerce, data proliferation |
| Offense categorization varies | Inconsistent eligibility | State law differences |
| No address of conviction itself | Only sealing, not actual expungement | Legal complexity |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Data Broker Enforcement**: Create private right of action against data brokers; establish civil penalties with statutory damages; require annual compliance certification; create "right to deletion" with enforcement mechanism.

2. **Interstate Coordination**: Establish interstate compact for record sealing recognition; create federal clearinghouse for sealed record notifications; condition federal funding on interstate compliance.

3. **Implementation Timeline Enforcement**: Tie agency funding to implementation milestones; create oversight body to monitor progress; establish penalties for delay.

4. **Exception Review**: Require biennial review of exception categories; create process for petitioning removal from exception list; sunset exceptions requiring re-authorization.

5. **Data Accuracy**: Require unique identifiers beyond name/DOB matching; create dispute resolution process; impose penalties for false positive reporting.

### Voting Rights Restoration

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| State non-compliance | States fail to implement notification | High |
| Registration barriers | Practical barriers to re-registration | Medium |
| Misinformation | Eligible voters believe they cannot vote | High |
| Prosecution threats | Prosecution of eligible voters for "illegal" voting | Critical |
| State election exclusion | Act covers only federal elections | High |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Does not address state elections | Voters still disenfranchised in state races | Federalism |
| Does not address current incarceration | Only restores post-release | Political compromise |
| Relies on state cooperation | Implementation varies | Federal structure |
| Does not address jail voting | Pre-trial detainees face barriers | Separate issue |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Compliance Enforcement**: Condition election administration funding on notification compliance; authorize DOJ to bring enforcement actions; create private right of action for failure to notify.

2. **Affirmative Registration**: Create federal automatic voter registration for federal elections; allow election-day registration for federal races; create streamlined registration process.

3. **Safe Harbor from Prosecution**: Provide absolute defense if person reasonably believed eligible; prohibit prosecution without proof of knowing ineligibility; require AG approval for any such prosecution.

4. **State Election Coordination**: Provide incentive grants for states extending rights to state elections; publish annual state comparison reports; support state-level advocacy.

### Model Supervision Reform Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Judge discretion to exceed limits | Courts impose longer terms despite caps | High |
| Condition creep | Supervision officers add informal requirements | Medium |
| Graduated response manipulation | Using upper-level responses immediately | Medium |
| Ability to pay manipulation | Determining ability without proper assessment | Medium |
| Caseload non-compliance | Funding not appropriated | High |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Does not address initial sentence length | Long supervision set at sentencing | Separate sentencing reform needed |
| Cultural resistance | Officers trained in surveillance model | Institutional inertia |
| Funding dependency | Success depends on appropriations | Budget politics |
| Limited reach | Does not cover federal supervision | State-level only |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Judicial Override Limits**: Require written justification for exceeding statutory limits; create appellate review of excessive terms; limit override to specific enumerated circumstances.

2. **Condition Enforcement**: Require all conditions in writing; prohibit enforcement of unwritten conditions; create complaint process for unauthorized conditions.

3. **Graduated Response Monitoring**: Require documentation of lower-level responses before escalation; create supervisory review of revocation recommendations; track graduated response use.

4. **Ability to Pay Standards**: Establish statewide standards for ability-to-pay determinations; require documentation; create appeal process for determinations.

5. **Appropriations Enforcement**: Create statutory entitlement to caseload standards; authorize court orders to hire additional officers; establish contingency procedures if caseloads exceed limits.

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| Patchwork of state laws | Federal minimum standards; interstate coordination |
| Data system fragmentation | Federal investment in record modernization |
| Enforcement resource gaps | Dedicated funding; private enforcement mechanisms |
| Political vulnerability | Constitutional amendments where possible; bipartisan framing |
| Regulatory capture | Diverse oversight bodies; sunset provisions |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

All legislation should include:

1. **5-Year Review**: Required legislative review of effectiveness
2. **Data Collection**: Mandated outcome reporting
3. **Adjustment Mechanism**: Regulatory authority to update standards
4. **Stakeholder Input**: Required input from affected communities
5. **Independent Evaluation**: Funded external assessment
