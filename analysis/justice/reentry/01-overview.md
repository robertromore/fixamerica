# Reentry Reform: Overview

## Executive Summary

Each year, over 600,000 people are released from federal and state prisons, and millions more cycle through local jails. Yet the systems designed to help them successfully reintegrate into society are woefully inadequate—when they exist at all. Instead, formerly incarcerated individuals face a web of legal barriers, social discrimination, and institutional obstacles that make recidivism not just likely, but almost inevitable for many.

Collateral consequences—the civil penalties that extend beyond criminal sentences—number over 44,000 across federal and state law. These barriers restrict access to employment, housing, education, voting, public benefits, and professional licenses. Combined with inadequate reentry support, underfunded probation and parole systems, and pervasive discrimination, the current system effectively sets up returning citizens for failure.

Reform requires a comprehensive approach: eliminating counterproductive barriers, expanding support services, reforming supervision systems, and changing cultural attitudes toward people with criminal records. The goal is not just reducing recidivism, but enabling full participation in society.

## Scope

### What This Subtopic Covers

- **Employment Barriers**: Ban the box, occupational licensing, employer liability
- **Housing Discrimination**: Public housing bans, private discrimination, homelessness
- **Voting Rights**: Felony disenfranchisement, restoration procedures
- **Public Benefits**: SNAP/TANF restrictions, education exclusions
- **Record Clearing**: Expungement, sealing, certificates of rehabilitation
- **Supervision Reform**: Probation and parole, technical violations
- **Support Services**: Reentry programs, transitional housing, healthcare

### What This Subtopic Does Not Cover

- Prison conditions (see future Prisons subtopic)
- Sentencing reform (see [Courts](../courts/01-overview.md))
- Policing practices (see [Policing](../policing/01-overview.md))
- Juvenile justice (see future Juvenile Justice subtopic)

## Key Questions

1. **Why is recidivism so high?** What structural factors drive the 44% rearrest rate within the first year of release?

2. **What barriers are counterproductive?** Which collateral consequences reduce public safety rather than enhance it?

3. **How do we balance accountability and reintegration?** What approaches serve both victims and returning citizens?

4. **What supervision models work?** How can probation and parole focus on success rather than failure?

5. **What do successful reentry programs share?** Which interventions have demonstrated effectiveness?

## Why This Matters

**Scale**: 600,000+ released from prison annually; 4.5 million on probation/parole

**Recidivism**: 44% rearrested within first year; 83% within 9 years

**Economic Cost**: $87 billion annually for incarceration; billions more in lost productivity

**Racial Disparities**: Black Americans 6x more likely to be incarcerated than whites

**Family Impact**: 2.7 million children have incarcerated parents

**Community Destabilization**: High-incarceration neighborhoods experience concentrated disadvantage

| Norway | ~20% | Rehabilitation focus |
| Germany | ~35% | Social reintegration |
| Japan | ~40% | Community integration |
| United Kingdom | ~48% | Mixed approach |
