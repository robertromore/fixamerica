# Reentry Reform: Root Causes

## Structural Framework

The high recidivism rate and poor outcomes for returning citizens result from interconnected systemic failures. These root causes operate at individual, institutional, and societal levels, creating a web of barriers that makes successful reintegration extraordinarily difficult.

## Collateral Consequences

### The Scale of Legal Barriers

Over 44,000 collateral consequences exist across federal and state law. These civil penalties extend punishment far beyond the criminal sentence.

| Category | Number of Consequences | Examples |
|----------|----------------------|----------|
| Employment | 15,000+ | Background checks, license bars |
| Licensing/Business | 11,000+ | Occupational license denial |
| Housing | 1,500+ | Public housing ban, private discrimination |
| Education | 1,000+ | Financial aid restrictions, school bans |
| Civic Participation | 3,500+ | Voting, jury service, office holding |
| Benefits | 500+ | SNAP, TANF, Medicaid restrictions |
| Family/Domestic | 1,200+ | Custody, adoption, visitation |
| Immigration | 800+ | Deportation, bar to citizenship |

### Why Collateral Consequences Exist

| Rationale (Stated) | Actual Effect |
|-------------------|---------------|
| Public safety | Often counterproductive |
| Punishment | Double punishment beyond sentence |
| Deterrence | Little evidence of deterrent effect |
| Risk management | Overbroad, not individualized |
| Political appeal | "Tough on crime" signaling |

### The Compounding Effect

Collateral consequences interact to create cascading barriers:

```text
Criminal Record
    ├── Employment Barrier → Poverty → Housing Instability
    ├── Housing Barrier → Homelessness → Employment Barrier
    ├── Education Barrier → Low Skills → Employment Barrier
    ├── Benefit Restrictions → Hunger, Poverty → Survival Crime
    └── Voting Bar → Political Powerlessness → No Reform
```

## Employment Discrimination

### Formal Barriers

| Barrier Type | Mechanism | Prevalence |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Background check requirements | Employer policy | 92% of employers |
| Blanket exclusion policies | Automatic disqualification | 40-60% |
| Occupational licensing bars | State law | 30%+ of jobs |
| Bonding requirements | Insurability | Common |
| Negligent hiring liability | Legal risk | All states |

### Informal Discrimination

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Employer bias | 50% callback reduction |
| Racial compounding | Black applicants: 60-70% reduction |
| Resume gaps | Unexplained gaps raise questions |
| Reference problems | Cannot use prison contacts |
| Interview disclosure | Criminal history questions |

### The Employment-Recidivism Link

Employment is one of the strongest predictors of successful reentry:

| Employment Status | Recidivism Impact |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Stable employment | 50% lower recidivism |
| Higher wages | Reduced property crime |
| Job training completion | 30% lower recidivism |
| First week employment | Critical window |

## Housing Discrimination

### Public Housing Barriers

| Barrier | Legal Basis | Impact |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Drug-related exclusion | Federal policy | Discretionary exclusion |
| "One-strike" eviction | Federal/local policy | Family destabilization |
| Sex offender ban | Federal mandate | Permanent exclusion |
| Meth production ban | Federal mandate | Permanent exclusion |
| Household screening | Local policy | Extended family affected |

### Private Market Discrimination

| Factor | Prevalence | Legal Status |
|--------|------------|--------------|
| Criminal background screening | 80%+ of landlords | Generally legal |
| Blanket exclusion policies | Common | Facially legal, disparate impact possible |
| Higher security deposits | Common | Generally legal |
| Lease denial for household members | Common | Generally legal |

### The Housing-Recidivism Link

| Housing Status | Recidivism Impact |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Stable housing | 50% lower recidivism |
| Homelessness | 2-3x higher recidivism |
| Transitional housing | Moderate reduction |
| Family reunification | Significant reduction |

## Voting Disenfranchisement

### Scope of the Problem

| Factor | Data |
|--------|------|
| Total disenfranchised | 4.6 million |
| Black Americans affected | 5.3% of voting-age |
| States with permanent bans | 7 |
| Restoration complexity | High in most states |

### Root Causes of Disenfranchisement

| Historical Cause | Modern Manifestation |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Jim Crow targeting | Racial disparity in affected population |
| Civil death doctrine | Complete civic exclusion |
| Punishment philosophy | View of felons as unworthy |
| Political calculation | Disenfranchised cannot vote for reform |

### Why Voting Matters for Reentry

| Connection | Mechanism |
|------------|-----------|
| Civic integration | Voting connects to community |
| Political voice | Can advocate for policy change |
| Identity transformation | From "convict" to "citizen" |
| Research evidence | Voters less likely to reoffend |

## Public Benefits Restrictions

### SNAP/TANF Drug Felony Bans

| Origin | 1996 Welfare Reform |
|--------|-------------------|
| Original scope | Lifetime ban |
| Current state adoption | 3 states (full), 24 (modified) |
| Rationale (stated) | "Responsibility" |
| Actual effect | Increased food insecurity, recidivism |

### The Benefits-Stability Link

| Benefit Access | Impact on Reentry |
|----------------|-------------------|
| SNAP access | Reduced food insecurity, lower recidivism |
| Medicaid | Healthcare continuity, mental health |
| Housing assistance | Stable living situation |
| SSI/SSDI | Disability accommodation |

### Perverse Incentives

Denying benefits increases the likelihood of recidivism:

| Denied Benefit | Consequence |
|----------------|-------------|
| Food assistance | Hunger, theft for survival |
| Healthcare | Untreated addiction, mental illness |
| Housing assistance | Homelessness |
| Cash assistance | Poverty, desperate choices |

## Inadequate Reentry Support

### Pre-Release Planning Failures

| Gap | Impact |
|-----|--------|
| Late or no planning | Release without plan |
| No documentation | No ID, birth certificate |
| No medication supply | Healthcare discontinuity |
| No housing arranged | Release to streets |
| No job lined up | Immediate unemployment |

### Program Underfunding

| Program Area | Funding Gap |
|--------------|-------------|
| Transitional housing | Meets <10% of need |
| Job training | Limited capacity |
| Mental health | Severely underfunded |
| Substance abuse | Waiting lists common |
| Case management | High caseloads |

### Healthcare Discontinuity

| Issue | Consequence |
|-------|-------------|
| Medicaid termination during incarceration | Gap at release |
| No medication on release | Mental health crisis |
| Opioid overdose risk | 40x higher in first 2 weeks |
| No insurance | Cannot access treatment |

## Probation and Parole Failures

### System Design Problems

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Surveillance focus | Catching violations vs. supporting success |
| High caseloads | 100-300 per officer common |
| Excessive conditions | 18-20 average conditions |
| Fee requirements | Criminalization of poverty |
| Technical violations | 45% of revocations |

### Counterproductive Practices

| Practice | How It Harms Reentry |
|----------|---------------------|
| Frequent reporting | Interferes with employment |
| Geographic restrictions | Limits job opportunities |
| Curfews | Incompatible with shift work |
| Drug testing for marijuana | False positives, arbitrary |
| Fee enforcement | Debt, incarceration for poverty |

### Lack of Graduated Responses

| Traditional Approach | Better Approach |
|---------------------|-----------------|
| Revocation for violations | Graduated sanctions |
| Return to prison | Community-based responses |
| Restart supervision clock | Earned discharge |
| No positive incentives | Incentives for compliance |

## Discrimination and Stigma

### Employer Attitudes

| Attitude | Prevalence |
|----------|------------|
| Unwilling to hire any record | 40% |
| Concerns about liability | 60% |
| Concerns about trustworthiness | 70% |
| Never considered hiring | 25% |

### Social Stigma

| Domain | Manifestation |
|--------|---------------|
| Personal relationships | Rejection by family, friends |
| Community | NIMBY for reentry housing |
| Political | "Tough on crime" rhetoric |
| Media | Criminal record = permanent identity |

### Internalized Stigma

| Effect | Impact on Reentry |
|--------|-------------------|
| Reduced self-efficacy | Don't believe success possible |
| Identity as "criminal" | Self-fulfilling prophecy |
| Shame and isolation | Mental health impact |
| Reluctance to seek help | Avoid programs |

## Systemic Racism

### Racial Disparities in the System

| Stage | Disparity |
|-------|-----------|
| Arrest rates | Black: 2.5x white |
| Incarceration rates | Black: 6x white |
| Sentence length | 10-20% longer for same crime |
| Parole denial | Black: higher rates |
| Employment discrimination | Black + record: compounded |

### How Racism Compounds Reentry Barriers

| Barrier | Racial Dimension |
|---------|------------------|
| Employment | Black applicants with records face greatest discrimination |
| Housing | Concentration in disinvested neighborhoods |
| Voting | Disenfranchisement disproportionately Black |
| Wealth | No family resources to fall back on |
| Networks | Segregated networks with fewer job leads |

## The Feedback Loop

These root causes create a self-reinforcing cycle:

```text
1. Criminal Record
        ↓
2. Employment Discrimination → Poverty
        ↓
3. Housing Barriers → Instability
        ↓
4. Supervision Violations → Reincarceration
        ↓
5. Longer Record → Worse Barriers
        ↓
   (Repeat)
```

Breaking this cycle requires addressing multiple barriers simultaneously.
