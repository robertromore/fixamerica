# Reentry Reform: Solutions

## Overview

Effective reentry reform requires a comprehensive approach addressing multiple barriers simultaneously. The following solutions are organized by category, with evidence of effectiveness where available.

## Employment Solutions

### Ban the Box

**Description**: Remove conviction history questions from initial job applications, delaying inquiry until later in the hiring process.

| Component | Best Practice |
|-----------|---------------|
| Timing | After conditional offer |
| Scope | All employers (public and private) |
| Individualized assessment | Required before adverse action |
| Consideration factors | Nature of offense, time elapsed, job relevance |

**Evidence**: Studies show mixed results; some evidence of increased callbacks for people with records, but potential for statistical discrimination against Black applicants when employers cannot see record.

**Best Practice Refinements**:

- Combine with anti-discrimination protections
- Include employer education
- Require consideration of rehabilitation evidence
- Provide safe harbor for good-faith hiring

### Fair Chance Hiring Requirements

| Provision | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Written notice before adverse action | Due process |
| Opportunity to respond | Correct errors, explain circumstances |
| Consideration of rehabilitation | Recognize change |
| Job-relatedness requirement | Limit blanket exclusions |
| Record age limitations | Old records less relevant |

### Occupational Licensing Reform

**Current Problem**: 30%+ of jobs require licenses; many have blanket or overbroad criminal record bars.

| Reform | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| Eliminate blanket bans | Replace with individualized review |
| Require nexus to occupation | Must relate to job duties |
| Time limitations | Old records excluded |
| Provisional/limited licenses | Pathway to full license |

| Federal Bonding Program | Free fidelity bonding |
| Liability protection | Safe harbor for good-faith hiring |
| Technical assistance | Help with fair chance hiring |
| Recognition programs | Publicize fair chance employers |

### Liability Protection

|----------|--------|

| Statutory limits on liability | Cap damages for good-faith hiring |
| Insurance solutions | Bonding for people with records |

| Automatic upon release | 22 states |
