# Reentry Reform: History

## Early American Period (1776-1865)

### Colonial and Post-Revolutionary Era

The concept of "civil death"—the complete forfeiture of civil rights upon conviction—was inherited from English common law. Felons lost the right to vote, hold office, serve on juries, and enter contracts.

| Period | Approach | Key Features |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| Colonial | Civil death doctrine | Complete forfeiture of rights |
| Post-Revolution | Modified civil death | Some state variations |
| Antebellum | Penitentiary movement | Focus on penitence, isolation |

### The Penitentiary Movement

Early American reformers believed in rehabilitation through isolation and reflection. The Pennsylvania and Auburn systems represented competing visions:

| System | Characteristics | Reentry Approach |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| Pennsylvania | Complete solitary confinement | Spiritual transformation |
| Auburn | Silent labor, group work | Work skills development |

## Reconstruction and Jim Crow (1865-1965)

### Post-Civil War Criminalization

The Thirteenth Amendment's exception for "punishment for crime" enabled the criminalization of newly freed Black Americans. Convict leasing and Black Codes created a system of re-enslavement through the criminal legal system.

| Development | Year | Impact on Reentry |
|-------------|------|-------------------|
| 13th Amendment exception | 1865 | Criminal punishment permitted |
| Black Codes | 1865-66 | Criminalization of Black behavior |
| Convict leasing | 1866-1920s | Exploitation of incarcerated labor |
| Vagrancy laws | 1860s-1960s | Criminalization of poverty |

### Felony Disenfranchisement Expansion

Southern states dramatically expanded felony disenfranchisement during this period, explicitly targeting offenses believed to be committed disproportionately by Black Americans.

| State | Year | Approach |
|-------|------|----------|
| Mississippi | 1890 | Targeted "Black crimes" (burglary, theft) |
| Alabama | 1901 | Crimes of "moral turpitude" |
| Virginia | 1902 | Expanded disqualifying offenses |
| Louisiana | 1898 | Permanent disenfranchisement |

## The Rehabilitative Era (1900-1970)

### Progressive Movement

The early 20th century saw the rise of indeterminate sentencing, parole, and rehabilitative programming, based on the belief that offenders could be reformed.

| Innovation | Period | Purpose |
|------------|--------|---------|
| Parole systems | 1900-1930 | Supervised release, reintegration |
| Indeterminate sentencing | 1900-1975 | Individualized rehabilitation |
| Social work in prisons | 1920s-1960s | Treatment focus |
| Vocational training | 1930s-1970s | Employment skills |
| Education programs | 1950s-1970s | Academic credentials |

### Federal Developments

| Year | Development | Significance |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| 1930 | Federal Bureau of Prisons created | Centralized federal system |
| 1944 | GI Bill | Initially excluded incarcerated |
| 1952 | Immigration restrictions | Criminal bars to entry |
| 1965 | Prisoner Rehabilitation Act | Work release programs |

## The Punitive Turn (1970-2000)

### Rise of Mass Incarceration

Beginning in the early 1970s, a dramatic shift toward punitive approaches rejected rehabilitation in favor of deterrence, incapacitation, and retribution. Collateral consequences expanded dramatically.

| Year | Development | Impact |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 1970 | RICO Act | Asset forfeiture, organized crime |
| 1971 | War on Drugs declared | Criminalization of addiction |
| 1973 | Rockefeller Drug Laws (NY) | Mandatory minimums |
| 1974 | Martinson Report | "Nothing works" conclusion |
| 1984 | Sentencing Reform Act | Federal guidelines, limited parole |
| 1986 | Anti-Drug Abuse Act | Crack/powder disparity, mandatory minimums |
| 1988 | Anti-Drug Abuse Act | Public housing drug eviction |
| 1994 | Violent Crime Control Act | Three strikes, prison expansion |
| 1996 | PWRORA (Welfare Reform) | SNAP/TANF drug felony bans |
| 1998 | Higher Education Act | Student aid drug conviction ban |

### Expansion of Collateral Consequences

The 1990s saw an explosion in civil penalties attached to criminal convictions:

| Category | 1980s | 2000s | Increase |
|----------|-------|-------|----------|
| Employment restrictions | ~6,000 | 12,000+ | 2x |
| Licensing restrictions | ~4,000 | 10,000+ | 2.5x |
| Housing restrictions | ~500 | 1,500+ | 3x |
| Benefit restrictions | ~200 | 800+ | 4x |
| Total collateral consequences | ~15,000 | 38,000+ | 2.5x |

### Supervision Expansion

| Metric | 1980 | 2000 | Change |
|--------|------|------|--------|
| Probation population | 1.1 million | 3.8 million | +245% |
| Parole population | 220,000 | 725,000 | +230% |
| Prison population | 320,000 | 1.4 million | +340% |

## The Reform Era (2000-Present)

### Second Chance Act and Federal Reform

| Year | Development | Significance |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| 2004 | Serious and Violent Offender Reentry Initiative | Federal pilot program |
| 2008 | Second Chance Act | First major reentry legislation |
| 2010 | Fair Sentencing Act | Reduced crack/powder disparity |
| 2015 | "Ban the Box" (federal contractors) | Obama executive action |
| 2018 | First Step Act | Federal sentencing reform, reentry |
| 2019 | Fair Chance Act | Federal agency hiring |
| 2020 | FIRST STEP implementation | Earned time credits |

## Key Turning Points

### 1. Martinson's "Nothing Works" (1974)

Robert Martinson's influential article claimed rehabilitation programs showed no consistent effect, providing intellectual justification for the punitive turn.

**Impact**: Undermined support for rehabilitation programming
**Later revision**: Martinson recanted; meta-analyses show programs do work

### 2. Welfare Reform (1996)

The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act imposed lifetime bans on SNAP and TANF for people with drug felony convictions.

**Impact**: Destabilized families, increased recidivism
**Reform**: Most states have opted out or modified

### 3. Second Chance Act (2008)

First comprehensive federal reentry legislation, providing grants for reentry programs and establishing reentry as a policy priority.

**Impact**: Legitimized reentry focus; funded programs
**Limitation**: Modest funding relative to need

### 4. First Step Act (2018)

Rare bipartisan criminal justice reform addressing federal sentencing and reentry.

**Impact**: Earned time credits, programming requirements
**Limitation**: Federal system only (10% of incarcerated population)

## Lessons from History

| Lesson | Historical Basis |
|--------|------------------|
| Collateral consequences often serve discrimination | Jim Crow origins of disenfranchisement |
| "Tough on crime" creates more crime | 1980s-90s policies increased recidivism |
| Rehabilitation works when implemented well | Pre-1974 programs, modern evidence |
| Barriers are additive, not substitutive | Each new restriction compounds harm |
| Reform is possible | State-level changes demonstrate feasibility |
