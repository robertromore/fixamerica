# Juvenile Justice Reform: Current State

## Youth Incarceration Today

### National Picture

| Category | Number | Trend |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Youth in residential placement | ~37,000 | Declining |
| Youth in adult prisons | ~3,000 | Declining |
| Youth in detention (pretrial) | ~15,000 | Declining |
| Youth committed post-adjudication | ~20,000 | Declining |
| States closing facilities | 25+ | Increasing |

### Types of Facilities

**Detention Centers**:

- Pretrial holding
- Average stay 2-4 weeks
- Overcrowded in many jurisdictions
- Limited programming

**Secure Commitment Facilities**:

- Post-adjudication placement
- Average stay 6-12 months
- Range from small therapeutic to large institutional
- Significant quality variation

**Group Homes and Residential Treatment**:

- Lower security
- More therapeutic focus
- Varying quality
- Often private, for-profit

### Facility Conditions

| Issue | Prevalence | Impact |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Physical abuse by staff | 10-20% of youth report | Trauma, mistrust |
| Sexual abuse | 7-12% report victimization | Lasting harm |
| Solitary confinement | Still used in most states | Psychological damage |
| Inadequate education | Majority of facilities | Lost learning |
| Lack of mental health services | 70%+ have mental health needs | Unmet needs |

## Racial and Ethnic Disparities

### Incarceration Rates (per 100,000)

| Race/Ethnicity | Rate | Compared to White |
|----------------|------|-------------------|
| White | 83 | 1.0x |
| Black | 414 | 5.0x |
| Hispanic | 141 | 1.7x |
| Native American | 240 | 2.9x |
| Asian/Pacific Islander | 17 | 0.2x |

### Disparities at Decision Points

| Stage | Black-White Disparity |
|-------|----------------------|
| Arrest | 2.4x |
| Referral to court | 1.5x after arrest |
| Detention | 1.4x after referral |
| Petition filed | 1.1x |
| Adjudicated delinquent | 1.0x |
| Placement | 1.3x after adjudication |
| Cumulative effect | 5.0x |

### Causes of Disparities

- Differential policing of Black communities
- Implicit bias in decision-making
- Wealth disparities (legal representation, alternatives)
- School discipline disparities
- Lack of community alternatives in some areas

## School-to-Prison Pipeline

### Police in Schools

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Schools with police officers | 58% |
| Students in schools with SROs | 29 million |
| School arrests annually | ~50,000 |
| School referrals to court | ~85,000 |

### Discipline Disparities

| Group | Suspension Rate | Compared to Average |
|-------|-----------------|---------------------|
| White students | 4% | Reference |
| Black students | 13% | 3.2x |
| Students with disabilities | 12% | 3.0x |
| Black students with disabilities | 25% | 6.2x |

### Impact of School Discipline

- Suspended students more likely to drop out
- Dropout associated with justice involvement
- Arrest at school predicts future arrests
- Students pushed out, not supported

## Transfer to Adult Court

### Methods of Transfer

| Type | Prevalence | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| Judicial waiver | Most common | Judge decides |
| Prosecutorial discretion | 15 states | Prosecutor chooses |
| Statutory exclusion | 29 states | Automatic for certain offenses |
| "Once an adult, always" | 34 states | After one transfer, always adult |

### Youth in Adult System

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Youth under 18 in adult prison | ~3,000 |
| Youth tried as adults annually | ~4,500 |
| States allowing adult prosecution of any age for some crimes | 13 |
| Minimum age for adult prosecution (where specified) | 10-14 |

### Outcomes for Youth in Adult System

- 34% higher recidivism than youth kept in juvenile system
- Higher rates of violence in adult facilities
- No rehabilitative programming
- Adult sentences, including life without parole

## Juvenile Records

### Record Accessibility

| State Approach | Number of States |
|----------------|------------------|
| Automatic sealing | 7 |
| Sealing by petition | 30+ |
| Limited or no sealing | ~10 |
| Records accessible to employers | Most states |

### Collateral Consequences

| Consequence | Prevalence |
|-------------|------------|
| Employment barriers | All states |
| Education barriers | Most states |
| Housing barriers | All states (public housing) |
| Immigration consequences | Federal law |
| Military service barriers | Federal policy |

## State Variations
