# Juvenile Justice Reform: History

## Origins of the Juvenile Court

### Pre-Juvenile Court Era (Before 1899)

**Children as Adults**:

- No separate system for youth
- Children tried in adult courts
- Children imprisoned with adults
- Same punishments as adults
- High death penalty for children

**Early Reform Efforts**:

- Houses of Refuge (1825+)
- Reform schools
- Child savers movement
- Progressive era concerns about youth
- Recognition of childhood as distinct

### First Juvenile Court (1899)

**Cook County, Illinois**:

- First juvenile court established
- Judge Julian Mack
- *Parens patriae* philosophy
- State as parent
- Rehabilitation, not punishment

**Core Principles**:

- Children different from adults
- Focus on child's best interests
- Informal proceedings
- Confidentiality
- Individualized treatment
- Indeterminate dispositions

### Spread of Juvenile Courts (1899-1960s)

| Decade | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| 1900s | 22 states create juvenile courts |
| 1910s | All but 2 states have juvenile courts |
| 1920s | Courts formalized |
| 1930s-40s | Training schools expand |
| 1950s | Probation emphasis |

## Due Process Revolution (1960s-1970s)

### Key Supreme Court Cases

***Kent v. United States* (1966)**:

- Transfer to adult court requires hearing
- Counsel at transfer hearing
- Statement of reasons required
- "Worst of both worlds" critique

***In re Gault* (1967)**:

- Right to notice
- Right to counsel
- Right against self-incrimination
- Right to confrontation
- Transformed juvenile justice

***In re Winship* (1970)**:

- Proof beyond reasonable doubt required
- Not just preponderance
- Constitutional protection applies

***Breed v. Jones* (1975)**:

- Double jeopardy applies
- Cannot try in both systems

### Impact of Due Process Cases

- More formal proceedings
- Defense attorneys in court
- Constitutional protections
- But still less than adult rights
- No jury trial right (*McKeiver*, 1971)

## Get Tough Era (1980s-1990s)

### Shift to Punishment

**Drivers of Change**:

- Rising crime rates (1970s-1990s)
- "Superpredator" myth
- Political competition to be "tough"
- Media coverage of youth crime
- Adult crime at young ages

**Policy Changes**:

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Easier transfer to adult court | More youth in adult system |
| Automatic transfer laws | Removed judicial discretion |
| Blended sentences | Juvenile with adult backup |
| Longer sentences | More time in facilities |
| "Adult time for adult crime" | Punitive philosophy |

### Expansion of Incarceration

| Year | Youth in Residential Placement |
|------|-------------------------------|
| 1975 | ~50,000 |
| 1985 | ~70,000 |
| 1995 | ~100,000+ |
| 1999 | 109,000 (peak) |

### School Policing Begins

- Police officers in schools expand
- Zero tolerance policies adopted
- Weapons, then drugs, then fighting
- Expanded to minor misbehavior
- Criminalization of school discipline

## Rethinking Juvenile Justice (2000s-Present)

### Brain Science Revolution

**Adolescent Development Research**:

- Prefrontal cortex not fully developed until mid-20s
- Risk-taking and impulsivity biologically driven
- Peer influence stronger in adolescence
- Capacity for change greater
- Culpability reduced

***Roper v. Simmons* (2005)**:

- Death penalty unconstitutional for juveniles
- Adolescent development recognized
- "Children are different"

***Graham v. Florida* (2010)**:

- Life without parole unconstitutional for non-homicide
- Meaningful opportunity for release required

***Miller v. Alabama* (2012)**:

- Mandatory life without parole unconstitutional
- Individualized sentencing required

***Montgomery v. Louisiana* (2016)**:

- *Miller* retroactive
- Opens resentencing

### Reform Movement Grows

**Evidence-Based Practices**:

- What works research
- Community-based alternatives
- Family-focused interventions
- Diversion programs
- Trauma-informed care

**Model Jurisdictions**:

- Missouri model gains attention
- Small, therapeutic facilities
- Close to home
- Family involvement
- Low recidivism

### Decline in Youth Incarceration

| Year | Youth in Placement | % Change from Peak |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 1999 | 109,000 | Peak |
| 2005 | 96,000 | -12% |
| 2010 | 71,000 | -35% |
| 2015 | 48,000 | -56% |
| 2019 | 37,000 | -66% |
| 2021 | 25,000 | -77% (COVID impact) |

### Raise the Age Movement

| Year | States Treating 17-Year-Olds as Juveniles |
|------|------------------------------------------|
| 2007 | 37 states |
| 2015 | 42 states |
| 2020 | 46 states |
| 2023 | 48 states |

## Lessons from History

### What We've Learned

1. **Rehabilitation Works Better**: Punitive approaches increase recidivism
2. **Community > Incarceration**: Close-to-home better than distant institutions
3. **Rights Matter**: Due process protections essential
4. **Children Are Different**: Brain science confirms original juvenile court insight
5. **Race Matters**: System perpetuates racial inequality

### Historical Patterns to Avoid

- Moral panics driving policy (superpredator myth)
- Adult responses to youth behavior
- Large institutions (they become abusive)
- Ignoring family and community
- Treating all youth the same
