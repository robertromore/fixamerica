# Juvenile Justice Reform: Solutions

## Reduce Youth Incarceration

### Close Large Facilities

**Strategy**:

- Close large, congregate care facilities
- Shift to small, therapeutic settings
- Community-based alternatives
- Regional model (Missouri)
- Keep youth close to home

**Evidence Base**:

| Model | Outcomes |
|-------|----------|
| Missouri model | 8% recidivism (vs. 50%+ national) |
| New York Close to Home | Reduced recidivism, lower cost |
| Community alternatives | 30-40% recidivism (vs. 70-80%) |

### Diversion

**Pre-Arrest Diversion**:

- Civil citations instead of arrest
- Warning and referral
- Community accountability boards
- Restorative justice conferences
- No formal processing

**Pre-Adjudication Diversion**:

- Deferred prosecution
- Completion leads to dismissal
- Services and support
- Accountability without conviction
- Record protection

### Detention Reform

**JDAI Model**:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Risk assessment | Identify who needs detention |
| Alternatives to detention | Supervision, programs |
| Case processing reform | Reduce length of stay |
| Conditions improvement | Safe, humane |
| Data-driven decisions | Track outcomes |

**Results**:

- Detention reduced 50%+ in JDAI sites
- No increase in failure to appear
- No increase in re-offense
- Cost savings reinvested

## End School-to-Prison Pipeline

The school-to-prison pipeline is a primary feeder of youth into the juvenile justice system. Ending it requires coordinated reforms in both education and justice systems, focusing on prevention, school-based supports, and limiting criminalization of adolescent behavior.

### School-Based Prevention Strategies

**Early Intervention Approaches**

| Strategy | Target | Evidence |
|----------|--------|----------|
| Universal social-emotional learning | All students | Strong evidence for behavior improvement |
| Trauma-informed schools | All staff/students | Growing evidence base |
| Early identification of at-risk youth | K-3 students | Can prevent escalation |
| Family engagement programs | All families | Moderate evidence |
| Mental health first aid training | All staff | Increases identification, referral |

**Targeted Prevention Programs**

| Program | Target Population | Outcomes |
|---------|-------------------|----------|
| Check & Connect | At-risk students | Reduces dropout, discipline |
| Functional Family Therapy | High-risk youth and families | Strong recidivism reduction |
| Multisystemic Therapy | Serious offenders | Strong evidence base |
| Mentoring programs | At-risk youth | Moderate positive effects |
| After-school programs | At-risk communities | Reduces delinquency |

### Remove Police from Schools

**Strategy**:

- Phase out SRO programs over 2-3 years
- Reinvest SRO funding in support staff
- Hire counselors, social workers, psychologists
- Employ restorative justice coordinators
- Train youth development staff

**Reallocation of Resources**

| Current Investment | Alternative Investment | Impact |
|--------------------|----------------------|--------|
| SRO salary (~$80,000/year) | 1-2 counselors | Direct student support |
| SRO training | Restorative justice training | All staff capacity |
| Police equipment | Mental health services | Therapeutic support |
| Arrest processing costs | Diversion programs | Prevention |

**Alternative Safety Approaches**:

| Traditional | Alternative |
|-------------|-------------|
| Police officer | Counselor, social worker |
| Arrest | Restorative conference |
| Suspension | In-school support, circles |
| Expulsion | Alternative program with path back |
| Zero tolerance | Graduated response system |

### End Zero Tolerance

**Policy Changes**:

- Eliminate mandatory exclusion policies
- Limit suspensions (maximum 3 days for most offenses)
- Ban out-of-school suspension in elementary schools
- Ban expulsion for non-violent offenses
- Require in-school alternatives before any removal
- Prohibit police involvement in discipline matters
- Require family notification before any discipline action

**Support-Based Discipline**:

| Approach | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| Trauma-informed practices | All staff trained, school-wide approach |
| Restorative justice | Circles, conferences, peer mediation |
| Positive Behavioral Interventions (PBIS) | Tiered support system |
| Mental health support | On-site clinicians, crisis response |
| Family engagement | Family liaisons, home visits |

### Invest in School Supports

**Current vs. Needed Staffing Ratios**

| Position | Current | Needed | Gap to Close |
|----------|---------|--------|--------------|
| School counselors | 1:500+ students | 1:250 | 2x increase |
| School psychologists | 1:1,000+ students | 1:500 | 2x increase |
| Mental health clinicians | Rarely available | On-site in every school | Major investment |
| Restorative staff | Limited | Trained staff in every school | Build capacity |
| Social workers | Rare | 1:250 students | New investment |

**School-Based Services That Prevent Justice Involvement**

| Service | How It Prevents Justice Contact |
|---------|--------------------------------|
| On-site mental health | Addresses underlying issues causing behavior |
| Restorative practices | Repairs harm without criminalization |
| Family support services | Addresses family stressors affecting youth |
| Academic support | Keeps students engaged, reduces dropout |
| Positive youth development | Builds protective factors |

### Coordination Between Schools and Juvenile Justice

**Joint Prevention Efforts**

| Strategy | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| Shared data systems | Identify youth at risk across systems |
| Cross-system training | School staff understand juvenile justice; probation understands schools |
| Joint case management | Coordinate services for system-involved youth |
| School-justice partnerships | Prevention-focused collaboration |
| Community-based alternatives | Diversion to services, not court |

**Limiting School Referrals to Justice System**

| Policy | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Prohibit referrals for minor offenses | Keeps normal adolescent behavior out of courts |
| Require administrative remedies first | Schools must try interventions before referral |
| Data tracking by demographics | Identify and address disparities in referrals |
| Community accountability | School boards review referral patterns |
| Clear MOU limits | Written agreements restricting police role |

## End Transfer to Adult Court

| Age | Younger = less likely transfer |

### Raise Age of Criminal Responsibility

**Proposals**:

- No criminal responsibility under 12
- Presumption of juvenile jurisdiction to 21
- Extended jurisdiction to 25 for some

## Reform Juvenile Records

### Automatic Expungement
