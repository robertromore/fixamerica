# Juvenile Justice Reform: Solutions

## Reduce Youth Incarceration

### Close Large Facilities

**Strategy**:

- Close large, congregate care facilities
- Shift to small, therapeutic settings
- Community-based alternatives
- Regional model (Missouri)
- Keep youth close to home

**Evidence Base**:

| Model | Outcomes |
|-------|----------|
| Missouri model | 8% recidivism (vs. 50%+ national) |
| New York Close to Home | Reduced recidivism, lower cost |
| Community alternatives | 30-40% recidivism (vs. 70-80%) |

### Diversion

**Pre-Arrest Diversion**:

- Civil citations instead of arrest
- Warning and referral
- Community accountability boards
- Restorative justice conferences
- No formal processing

**Pre-Adjudication Diversion**:

- Deferred prosecution
- Completion leads to dismissal
- Services and support
- Accountability without conviction
- Record protection

### Detention Reform

**JDAI Model**:

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| Risk assessment | Identify who needs detention |
| Alternatives to detention | Supervision, programs |
| Case processing reform | Reduce length of stay |
| Conditions improvement | Safe, humane |
| Data-driven decisions | Track outcomes |

**Results**:

- Detention reduced 50%+ in JDAI sites
- No increase in failure to appear
- No increase in re-offense
- Cost savings reinvested
