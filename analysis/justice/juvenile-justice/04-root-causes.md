# Juvenile Justice Reform: Root Causes

## Why Youth Become System-Involved

### Individual and Family Factors

**Trauma and Adversity**:

| Factor | Prevalence in System-Involved Youth |
|--------|-------------------------------------|
| Experienced trauma | 90%+ |
| ACEs (4+) | 50%+ |
| Mental health needs | 70%+ |
| Substance use | 40-60% |
| Learning disabilities | 30-40% |

**Family Circumstances**:

- Poverty and economic stress
- Family instability
- Parental incarceration (1 in 14 children)
- Abuse and neglect history
- Lack of supervision
- Intergenerational system involvement

### Community Factors

**Neighborhood Conditions**:

- Concentrated poverty
- Limited opportunities
- Violence exposure
- Inadequate schools
- Lack of youth services
- Disinvestment

**Resource Disparities**:

| Resource | Well-Resourced Areas | Under-Resourced Areas |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Mental health services | Available | Scarce |
| After-school programs | Abundant | Limited |
| Employment for youth | Accessible | Rare |
| Recreational facilities | Many | Few |
| Quality schools | Standard | Lacking |

## Why the System Responds Punitively

### Political Dynamics

**"Tough on Crime" Politics**:

- Political benefit from appearing tough
- Fear-based messaging effective
- Rare cases drive policy
- Youth can't vote
- Families marginalized
- Racial anxieties exploited

**Moral Panic Cycles**:

- Media covers sensational cases
- Public demands action
- Politicians respond punitively
- Evidence ignored
- Policy lags behind fear

### Institutional Interests

**System Actors**:

| Actor | Interest in Status Quo |
|-------|----------------------|
| Juvenile detention staff unions | Job preservation |
| Private facility operators | Revenue |
| Prosecutors | Conviction rates, control |
| Police unions | Maintain school presence |
| Probation departments | Caseloads, funding |

**Institutional Momentum**:

- Built infrastructure requires youth
- Jobs depend on incarceration
- Training oriented to custody
- Culture of control
- Change is threatening

### Funding Structures

**Perverse Incentives**:

- Facilities funded per bed
- Counties may pay more to divert
- Prevention funding insecure
- Alternatives require new investment
- Incarceration is default

**Budget Politics**:

- Juvenile justice competes with other priorities
- Prevention benefits not immediate
- Savings from closing facilities hard to capture
- Reinvestment not automatic

## Why Racial Disparities Persist

### Differential Policing

**Over-Policing of Black Communities**:

- More police in Black neighborhoods
- More surveillance and stops
- Lower tolerance for youth behavior
- Different response to same conduct
- School policing concentrated in Black schools

### Bias in Decision-Making

**Implicit and Explicit Bias**:

| Decision Point | How Bias Operates |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Arrest | Officer perception of threat |
| Referral | Assessment of family, risk |
| Detention | Assumptions about flight, danger |
| Disposition | Valuation of youth potential |
| Placement | Access to alternatives |

**Risk Assessment Bias**:

- Tools may encode historical disparities
- Prior system contact weighted
- Neighborhood factors included
- Family structure assumptions
- Validation on biased outcomes

### Structural Racism

**Historical Roots**:

- Slave codes and Black Codes
- Convict leasing included children
- Reform schools segregated
- Progressive era excluded Black youth
- Unequal investment persistent

**Contemporary Manifestations**:

- Wealth disparities (legal representation, alternatives)
- School discipline disparities
- Neighborhood disinvestment
- Employment discrimination
- Housing segregation

## Why School-to-Prison Pipeline Exists

The school-to-prison pipeline describes the policies and practices that push students, particularly students of color and students with disabilities, out of schools and into the juvenile and criminal justice systems. School discipline has become a primary entry point to justice system involvement.

**Cross-Domain Connection**: For comprehensive analysis of school discipline disparities and reform strategies from an education equity perspective, see [Education Equity: Solutions](../../education/education-equity/07-solutions.md).

### School Arrests as Entry Point

**Scale of School-Based Arrests**

| Statistic | Data |
|-----------|------|
| Annual school-based arrests | ~70,000 students |
| Schools with police | 58% of high schools, 42% of middle schools |
| Arrests for non-violent offenses | 60%+ of all school arrests |
| Students referred to law enforcement | ~230,000 annually |

**Common School-Based Offenses Leading to Arrest**

| Offense | Description | Percentage of Arrests |
|---------|-------------|----------------------|
| Disorderly conduct | Subjective, includes "disruption" | 20-25% |
| Simple assault | Often minor fights | 15-20% |
| Drug possession | Including minor amounts, paraphernalia | 15-20% |
| Vandalism/property | Including minor property damage | 10-15% |
| Trespassing | Often students on school property | 5-10% |

### Criminalization of Schools

**Police in Schools**:

- Began after Columbine (1999)
- Now in majority of high schools (58%)
- Handle discipline, not just safety
- Low threshold for arrest
- Trained for enforcement, not youth development
- Incentivized to make arrests (performance metrics)

**School Resource Officer Problems**

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Role confusion | SROs handle discipline matters that should be administrative |
| Training gaps | Most receive minimal youth development training |
| Racial disparities | Black students 2.3x more likely to be referred to police |
| Criminalizing childhood | Normal adolescent behavior becomes criminal record |
| Trauma re-activation | Police presence can trigger trauma for some students |

**Zero Tolerance Policies**:

| Original Target | Expansion | Result |
|-----------------|-----------|--------|
| Weapons | Anything resembling weapons | Students expelled for toy guns |
| Drugs | Any medication | Students arrested for Advil |
| Violence | Fighting, threats | Students arrested for playground fights |
| Further expansion | Disrespect, disruption | Subjective offenses drive disparities |

### Suspension-to-Dropout-to-Incarceration Connection

**The Research Evidence**

| Finding | Source/Data |
|---------|-------------|
| Suspension triples dropout risk | Controlling for other factors |
| Each suspension increases juvenile contact | 2x increase in likelihood |
| Dropouts 3x more likely to be incarcerated | Than high school graduates |
| Suspended students more likely to be suspended again | Cycle of exclusion |

**How the Pipeline Works**

```text
School Discipline Disparity → Out-of-School Suspension
            ↓
    Academic Disengagement → Falling Behind
            ↓
    Repeated Suspensions → Chronic Absenteeism
            ↓
    Dropout/Pushout → Disconnection from School
            ↓
    Street-Level Exposure → Increased Police Contact
            ↓
    Juvenile Justice Involvement → Criminal Record
            ↓
    Reduced Life Opportunities → Recidivism Risk
```

### Pushout of Challenging Students

**Who Gets Pushed Out**:

- Students with disabilities (2x suspension rate)
- Students with trauma histories
- Students of color (Black students 3.8x suspension rate)
- LGBTQ students
- Students experiencing poverty
- Students in foster care

**Why Schools Push Out**:

- Accountability pressure (test scores)
- Inadequate support resources
- Teacher overwhelm (large class sizes)
- Discipline as control mechanism
- Exclusion is easier than intervention
- Lack of training in trauma-informed practices

### Discipline Disparities

**Racial Disparities in School Discipline**

| Group | Suspension Rate | Compared to White Students |
|-------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| Black students | 15.5% | 3.8x more likely |
| Native American students | 7.1% | 1.7x more likely |
| Latino students | 6.1% | 1.5x more likely |
| White students | 4.1% | Baseline |

**When Disparities Begin**

| Grade Level | Disparity |
|-------------|-----------|
| Preschool | Black children 3.6x more likely to be suspended |
| Elementary | Disparities present from kindergarten |
| Middle school | Disparities widen significantly |
| High school | Cumulative impact most severe |

### Lack of Supports

**Missing Resources**:

| Resource | What's Needed | What's Available | Gap |
|----------|---------------|------------------|-----|
| School counselors | 1:250 | Often 1:500+ | 2x shortage |
| School psychologists | 1:500 | Often 1:1,000+ | 2x shortage |
| Mental health clinicians | On-site | Rarely available | Vast |
| Restorative practices staff | Trained staff | Limited | Emerging |
| Family liaisons | In every school | Rare | Vast |

**Consequence of Resource Gaps**

| Gap | Result |
|-----|--------|
| No counselors | Students in crisis unidentified |
| No mental health | Behavioral issues treated as discipline |
| No restorative options | Exclusion is only option |
| No family engagement | Families seen as problem, not partners |

## Why Transfer to Adult Court Continues

### Legal Framework

**Statutory Exclusion**:

- Legislatures removed discretion
- Certain offenses automatically adult
- Age thresholds lowered
- Presumption of adult for serious offenses
- Difficult to reverse

**Prosecutorial Discretion**:

- Prosecutors choose in some states
- No hearing required
- Hard to challenge
- Motivated by conviction rates
- Racial disparities in exercise

### Public Perception

**"Adult Crime, Adult Time"**:

- Belief that serious crime requires adult response
- Victims' families seek maximum punishment
- Media coverage of serious youth crime
- Misunderstanding of juvenile purpose
- Adolescent development not understood

## Why Records Continue to Harm

### Historical Treatment

**Not Really Confidential**:

- Confidentiality never complete
- Expanded access over time
- Technology makes information permanent
- Background check industry
- Exceptions swallowed the rule

### Policy Choices

**Collateral Consequences Intentional**:

- Seen as additional punishment
- Deterrence theory
- Employment restrictions passed
- Housing restrictions enacted
- Immigration consequences

### Implementation Failures

**Sealing Doesn't Work**:

- Petition process burdensome
- Many don't know it's possible
- Courts don't inform
- Employers find records anyway
- Background check industry evades sealing

## Interconnected System Failures

### Reinforcing Cycles

```text
Poverty → Inadequate Schools → Discipline Problems
   ↓              ↓                    ↓
Trauma ← Justice Involvement ← School Arrest
   ↓              ↓                    ↓
Further Poverty ← Record ← Limited Opportunity
```

### Systems Not Coordinated

**Siloed Responses**:

- Child welfare doesn't coordinate with juvenile justice
- Mental health separate from juvenile justice
- Education separate from juvenile justice
- No holistic approach
- Youth fall through cracks
