# Parole and Probation Reform: Evidence-Based Solutions

## Overview of Reform Approaches

Evidence from multiple jurisdictions demonstrates that shorter, less intensive supervision focused on incentives rather than punishment produces better outcomes for both public safety and individual success. This document presents comprehensive reform proposals organized by area of intervention.

## 1. Reducing Supervision Populations

### Front-End Diversion

| Strategy | Description | Evidence |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Deferred adjudication | Dismiss charges upon completion | Reduces supervision population 15-20% |
| Pre-trial diversion | No conviction, no supervision | Successful in drug courts |
| Citation release | Civil rather than criminal for low-level | Reduces felony supervision |
| Prosecutorial discretion | Decline to charge supervision-eligible | Emerging progressive DA practice |

### Reducing Supervision Sentences

| Strategy | Current Practice | Reform Approach |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Length limits | Often 3-5+ years | Cap at 1-2 years for most offenses |
| Presumptive terms | Judge discretion | Guidelines limiting length |
| No probation option | Jail/probation binary | Community service, fines, treatment only |
| Risk matching | Same supervision for all | Shorter terms for low-risk |

### Earned Compliance Credits

| Model | Description | Results |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Day-for-day | 1 day credit for each compliant day | 50% reduction in time |
| Monthly credits | 30 days off per compliant month | 25-30% early termination |
| Milestone credits | Credits for completing programs | Incentivizes treatment |
| Accelerated credits | More credits for sustained compliance | Rewards long-term success |

### Early Termination

| Approach | Criteria | Adoption |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Automatic review | Review at 50% of term | 15+ states |
| Presumptive termination | Terminate unless specific reason not to | Georgia, Louisiana |
| Petition-based | Supervised person requests | Most states |
| Officer-initiated | Officer can initiate termination | Growing practice |

## 2. Reducing and Rationalizing Conditions

### Condition Reduction Strategies

| Strategy | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| Offense-related only | Conditions must connect to offense |
| Individualized assessment | Conditions based on actual risk/need |
| Regular review | Conditions reduced as compliance demonstrated |
| Condition limits | Cap total number of conditions |
| Standard condition reduction | Reduce boilerplate conditions |

### Model Condition Framework

| Condition Type | When Appropriate |
|----------------|------------------|
| Report to officer | Universal, but frequency risk-based |
| No new offenses | Universal |
| Maintain contact information | Universal |
| Treatment participation | When assessed need exists |
| Employment/education | With flexibility for circumstances |
| Drug testing | When substance issue documented |
| Curfew | Rarely, time-limited, with exceptions |
| Travel restrictions | Rarely, with clear pathway to removal |
| Association limits | Only specific individuals, not categories |
| Residence approval | Only when documented housing issue |

### Eliminating Counterproductive Conditions

| Condition to Eliminate | Rationale |
|------------------------|-----------|
| No alcohol (non-alcohol offense) | Unrealistic, unrelated to offense |
| No association with felons | Often includes family, impossible to verify |
| Blanket travel restrictions | Limits employment, family connection |
| Curfews for employed adults | Conflicts with work schedules |
| Social media monitoring | Privacy invasion, not related to public safety |
| Blanket search conditions | Erodes rights without benefit |

## 3. Graduated Responses to Violations

### Swift, Certain, Fair Model

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Swift | Response within 24-72 hours of violation |
| Certain | Response occurs for every violation detected |
| Fair | Response proportionate to violation severity |
| Modest | Start with minimal interventions |
| Escalating | Increase only if needed |

### Graduated Sanctions Matrix

| Violation Level | Examples | Response Options |
|-----------------|----------|------------------|
| Minor (Level 1) | Missed appointment, late curfew | Verbal warning, reminder call, extended curfew |
| Moderate (Level 2) | Multiple minor violations, positive drug test | Written warning, increased reporting, treatment referral |
| Significant (Level 3) | Pattern of violations, absconding briefly | Short jail sanction (2-5 days), modified conditions |
| Serious (Level 4) | New arrest, extended absconding | Longer jail sanction, intensive supervision, possible revocation |

### Administrative Sanctions

| Sanction | Authority | Examples |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| Officer-level | Probation officer | Verbal warning, curfew modification |
| Supervisor-level | Unit supervisor | Written warning, community service |
| Hearing officer | Administrative hearing | Short jail sanctions (up to 10 days) |
| Court/board | Formal proceeding | Revocation (last resort) |

### Technical Violation Limits

| Approach | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Caps on incarceration | Limit jail time for technical violations |
| No revocation for first technical | Require intervention first |
| Declining time limits | Less time available for subsequent technicals |
| Elimination for certain violations | Some technicals never warrant incarceration |

## 4. Eliminating Financial Barriers

### Fee Elimination

| No extension for nonpayment | Can't extend supervision for fees |
| No incarceration for nonpayment | Constitutional protection |

### Separating Restitution from Supervision

| Current Problem | Reform Approach |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Restitution nonpayment = violation | Convert to civil debt |
| Extended supervision for restitution | Terminate supervision, maintain restitution obligation |
| Jail for nonpayment | Civil enforcement only |
