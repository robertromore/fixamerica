# Prison Reform: Legislation

## Overview

Prison reform legislation operates at multiple levels. Federal legislation can establish minimum standards, reform federal prisons, and incentivize state reform through funding conditions. State legislation controls the vast majority of prisons and must address sentencing, conditions, private prisons, and oversight. This document provides model legislation for the most critical reforms.

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Framework

**Eighth Amendment**:

- Prohibits cruel and unusual punishment
- Requires "deliberate indifference" standard for conditions claims (*Farmer v. Brennan*)
- Applies to healthcare, safety, and conditions
- Solitary confinement increasingly challenged

**Fourteenth Amendment**:

- Due process required for disciplinary decisions
- Equal protection applies to disparate treatment

### Preemption

**Federal-State**:

- Federal standards create floor, not ceiling
- States may exceed federal protections
- Funding conditions require clear statement

**State-Local**:

- Some states preempt local prison/jail reform
- Model legislation should address local application

### Enforcement Mechanisms

**Litigation**:

- 42 U.S.C. Section 1983 for constitutional claims
- PLRA limitations on prisoner suits
- Class actions for systemic reform
- DOJ pattern-or-practice authority

**Administrative**:

- Oversight bodies with enforcement authority
- Accreditation requirements
- Funding conditions

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Definition gaming | Redefine "solitary" to evade limits | High |
| Documentation failures | Incomplete records hide violations | High |
| Waiver provisions | Allow exceptions that swallow rule | Moderate |
| Funding condition escape | States forgo funds to avoid compliance | Moderate |
| Private contract circumvention | Contract for "services" not "facilities" | High |
| Co-pay for necessities | Force purchases despite low wages | Moderate |
| Voluntary work coercion | Pressure disguised as choice | High |
| Oversight capture | Oversight bodies lack independence | High |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Implementation gap | Policy on paper, not practice | Insufficient oversight, resources |
| PLRA barriers | Litigation difficult | Federal law limits prisoner suits |
| State variation | Uneven protection | Federalism limits federal action |
| Cultural resistance | Staff undermine reforms | Institutional inertia |
| Underfunding | Standards unmet | Budget constraints |
| Political reversal | Reforms rolled back | Electoral vulnerability |
| Contractor evasion | Private services avoid regulation | Narrow definitions |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Anti-circumvention provisions**: Include explicit language that prohibits renaming practices to evade restrictions. Define terms broadly to capture functional equivalents. Example: "Restrictive housing includes any housing arrangement that results in confinement for 20 or more hours per day, regardless of the label applied."

2. **Mandatory documentation with verification**: Require contemporaneous documentation of all restrictive housing placements, with independent verification. Create penalties for documentation failures. Mandate video recording of placement decisions.

3. **Narrow waiver provisions**: Any waiver provisions must be time-limited (no more than 72 hours), subject to independent review, and documented with specific justification. No categorical waivers for populations or facilities.

4. **Funding ratchet**: Make funding conditions substantial enough that forgoing funds is not viable. Tie multiple funding streams to compliance. Create matching requirements that increase federal leverage.

5. **Contract definitional clarity**: Define "correctional facility" and "correctional services" broadly to include all detention and all security functions. Prohibit contracts that divide functions to evade prohibition.

6. **Basic necessities guarantee**: Specify that basic necessities (food, hygiene, bedding, clothing, basic medical care) must be provided without charge regardless of work status or disciplinary status. Commissary may supplement but not replace.

7. **Voluntary work protections**: Require affirmative documentation of voluntary choice. Prohibit any adverse consequence for refusal. Conduct independent surveys of workers. Create confidential complaint mechanisms.

8. **Oversight independence**: Oversight bodies must be structurally independent with:
   - Separate appropriation
   - Fixed terms for leadership
   - Hiring authority independent of corrections
   - Subpoena power
   - Public reporting without pre-clearance

9. **PLRA reform**: At federal level, amend PLRA to reduce barriers to prisoner litigation. At state level, ensure state causes of action not subject to PLRA limitations.

10. **Sunset and review**: Build in mandatory legislative review at 5-year intervals. Require affirmative reauthorization to continue reforms. Create data collection requirements that inform review.

### General Implementation Concerns

- **Capacity building**: Training and resources for implementation
- **Stakeholder engagement**: Include directly impacted people in implementation design
- **Transition support**: Address staff and community concerns during changes
- **Monitoring infrastructure**: Invest in data systems and oversight capacity
- **Judicial education**: Train judges on new sentencing frameworks
- **Defense resources**: Fund public defenders to utilize resentencing provisions
- **Victim services**: Maintain victim notification and participation
