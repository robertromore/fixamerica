# Prison Reform: History

## The Penitentiary Era (1790-1860)

### Origins of the American Prison

**Before Prisons**:

| Punishment | Description |
|------------|-------------|

| Jails | Short-term holding only |

**The Penitentiary Concept**:

- Born from Enlightenment ideals and Quaker religious beliefs
- First penitentiary: Walnut Street Jail, Philadelphia (1790)
- Core idea: Isolation leads to penitence and reformation
- Replaced physical punishment with deprivation of liberty
- Revolutionary concept: punishment as opportunity for moral transformation

### Competing Models

**Pennsylvania System** (Eastern State Penitentiary, 1829):

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Approach | Complete isolation |
| Labor | Solitary cell work |
| Contact | No prisoner interaction |
| Philosophy | Solitary reflection leads to reform |
| Result | Mental breakdowns, abandonment of pure model |

**Auburn System** (Auburn Prison, New York, 1819):

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Approach | Congregate labor, solitary sleeping |
| Labor | Silent factory work together |
| Discipline | Lockstep, strict silence |
| Philosophy | Order and labor reform character |
| Result | Became dominant U.S. model |

### Early Concerns

**Alexis de Tocqueville** (1831):

- Initially impressed by order
- Noted psychological damage of isolation
- *Democracy in America* included prison observations

**Dorothea Dix** (1840s):

## The Reformatory Movement (1870-1920)

### Declaration of Principles (1870)

**National Congress on Penitentiary and Reformatory Discipline**:

- Convened in Cincinnati, 1870
- Adopted principles emphasizing reformation over punishment
- Called for indeterminate sentences
- Advocated for education and vocational training
- Established American Prison Association (now ACA)

### Key Innovations

| Innovation | Description |

### Elmira Reformatory (1876)

**Zebulon Brockway's Model**:

- Young first-time offenders only
- Indeterminate sentences
- Grades system for progress
- Trade training
- Military drill
- Parole upon reform

**Reality vs. Ideal**:

### Limitations

| Limitation | Impact |

| Gender | Women's facilities even more punitive |
| South | Convict leasing continued post-Reconstruction |
| Implementation | Ideal rarely matched practice |

## Convict Leasing and Chain Gangs (1865-1940)

## Historical Patterns

### Recurring Themes

| Theme | Manifestation |
|-------|---------------|
| Reform rhetoric vs. reality | Each era promises change, delivers less |
| Racial targeting | Every system disproportionately incarcerates Black people |
| Economic exploitation | Prison labor serves various interests |
| Political opportunism | Crime consistently used for political gain |
| Cycles of reform | Periods of reform followed by retrenchment |

### What History Teaches

1. **Reform is possible but fragile**: Every era has seen reforms, but also reversals.

2. **Racial injustice is constant**: From convict leasing to mass incarceration, racial disparities persist.

3. **Economics matter**: Financial interests (labor, private prisons, guard unions) shape policy.

4. **Politics drives policy**: Crime policy reflects political incentives more than evidence.

5. **Conditions tend to degrade**: Without oversight, prison conditions deteriorate.

6. **Rhetoric exceeds action**: Every generation claims to prioritize rehabilitation while funding punishment.
