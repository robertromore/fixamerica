| Backsliding | Medium | Medium | Institutionalization; ongoing monitoring |

## Critical Success Factors

1. **Sustained advocacy**: Continuous pressure from reform organizations
2. **Bipartisan support**: Framing that appeals across political spectrum
3. **Stakeholder buy-in**: Early wins that demonstrate benefits
4. **Adequate funding**: Resources for implementation
5. **Judicial engagement**: Courts as reform partners
6. **Federal leadership**: National standards and incentives
7. **Professional cooperation**: Practitioner engagement
