# Forensic Science Reform: Current State

## The State of Forensic Science in American Courts

Despite mounting scientific criticism and documented wrongful convictions, American courts continue to admit forensic evidence from disciplines that lack adequate scientific validation. The gap between scientific consensus and courtroom practice remains vast, with profound consequences for justice.

## Forensic Disciplines: Current Scientific Status

### Validated Disciplines

| Discipline | Scientific Status | Key Limitations |
|------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| DNA Analysis (Single Source) | Validated | Requires quality samples; mixture interpretation problematic |
| Toxicology | Generally validated | Interpretation of effects varies |
| Drug Identification | Validated | Confirmatory testing required |

### Disciplines with Significant Scientific Concerns

| Discipline | Status | Primary Concerns |
|------------|--------|------------------|
| DNA Mixture Analysis | Contested | Subjective interpretation; software varies widely |
| Fingerprint Analysis | Partially validated | No established error rates; examiner variability |
| Firearms/Toolmarks | Weakly supported | Foundational validity questioned; high subjectivity |
| Blood Pattern Analysis | Largely unsupported | Poor reproducibility; limited scientific basis |
| Footwear/Tire Impressions | Weakly supported | Class characteristics only; individualization unproven |

### Discredited or Highly Questionable Disciplines

| Discipline | Status | Evidence of Problems |
|------------|--------|---------------------|
| Bite Mark Analysis | Discredited | Multiple wrongful convictions; no scientific validity |
| Microscopic Hair Comparison | Discredited | FBI admitted 95% error rate in reviewed cases |
| Comparative Bullet Lead Analysis | Abandoned | FBI discontinued in 2005 |
| Arson Investigation (Old Methods) | Largely discredited | Based on disproven indicators |
| Handwriting Analysis | Contested | Limited validation; high examiner variability |

## Crime Laboratory Landscape

### Organizational Structure

| Structure Type | Percentage of Labs | Independence Concerns |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| Police Department | 35% | High - direct LE control |
| Sheriff's Office | 15% | High - direct LE control |
| State Police/DPS | 25% | Moderate - LE affiliation |
| Independent State Agency | 20% | Lower - some separation |
| Medical Examiner/Coroner | 3% | Varies by jurisdiction |
| Prosecutor's Office | 2% | Highest - direct party control |

### Accreditation Status

Approximately 90% of publicly funded crime laboratories hold some form of accreditation, but significant concerns remain:

- **Accreditation standards vary** between accrediting bodies
- **Accreditation is not legally required** in most jurisdictions
- **Audits may miss systemic problems** as demonstrated by scandals in accredited labs
- **Proficiency testing is often non-blind** reducing effectiveness
- **Corrective actions lack enforcement** mechanisms

### Known Quality Issues

Recent laboratory scandals and audits have revealed:

| Issue Type | Prevalence | Impact |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Evidence contamination | Documented in 12+ major labs | Thousands of cases potentially affected |
| Analyst misconduct/fraud | 20+ major scandals since 2000 | Tens of thousands of cases compromised |
| Dry-labbing (reporting without testing) | Multiple documented cases | Unknown scope |
| Backlogs affecting case processing | Nearly universal | Justice delayed |
| Inadequate documentation | Common finding | Results unreproducible |

## DNA Evidence: Current Realities

### Proper Applications

DNA evidence, when properly collected, preserved, analyzed, and interpreted, remains the most reliable forensic discipline. However, significant limitations exist:

### DNA Limitations and Concerns

| Issue | Description | Prevalence |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Transfer and Persistence | Secondary/tertiary transfer can place innocent person's DNA at scene | Not well quantified |
| Mixture Interpretation | Multiple contributors create interpretation challenges | ~15-20% of crime scene samples |
| Low Copy Number/Touch DNA | Minimal samples increase error potential | Increasingly common |
| Database Expansion | Familial searches and expanded databases raise accuracy concerns | Growing |
| Probabilistic Genotyping | Software "black boxes" with varying results | Becoming standard |
| Laboratory Contamination | Documented in numerous cases | Underreported |

### Current DNA Practices of Concern

1. **Overstatement of match statistics** in testimony
2. **Failure to consider alternative explanations** for DNA presence
3. **Inadequate disclosure** of limitations to juries
4. **Inconsistent interpretation** between laboratories
5. **Inadequate validation** of new technologies before deployment

## Expert Testimony: Current Practices

### Common Problems in Forensic Testimony

| Problem | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Overstatement of certainty | "100% match" claims without scientific basis | Fingerprint, firearms testimony |
| Failure to provide error rates | No acknowledgment of possibility of error | Most pattern evidence |
| Unfounded uniqueness claims | Asserting individualization without scientific basis | Fingerprints, tool marks |
| Misleading statistics | Incorrect or exaggerated probability statements | Hair, DNA mixture testimony |
| Unsupported conclusions | Opinions beyond what science supports | Bite marks, blood spatter |

### Judicial Gatekeeping Failures

Courts continue to admit forensic evidence despite scientific criticism:

| Jurisdiction Type | Daubert/Frye Application | Pattern Evidence Admission |
|------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Federal Courts | Daubert (variable application) | Generally admitted |
| State Courts (Daubert) | Inconsistent rigor | Generally admitted |
| State Courts (Frye) | Relies on "general acceptance" | Generally admitted |

## Death Investigation Systems

### Medical Examiner vs. Coroner Systems

| System Type | States Using | Qualifications Required |
|-------------|--------------|------------------------|
| State Medical Examiner | 22 | Physician (usually forensic pathology) |
| County Medical Examiner | Variable | Usually physician |
| Elected Coroner | 16 | Often none required |
| Mixed System | 12+ | Varies by jurisdiction |

### Current Quality Concerns

- **Shortage of forensic pathologists**: Only ~500 board-certified practitioners for ~400,000 annual deaths requiring investigation
- **Elected coroners**: May lack any medical training
- **Funding inadequacy**: Many offices understaffed and under-resourced
- **Independence concerns**: Pressure from law enforcement and families
- **Inconsistent standards**: No mandatory national certification

## Defense Access to Forensic Evidence

### Current Disparities

| Resource | Prosecution Access | Defense Access |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Crime laboratory | Direct access | Must request, may be denied |
| Forensic experts | Employed or contracted | Limited funding, must petition |
| Evidence for testing | Possesses evidence | Must petition for access |
| Advanced technology | Standard equipment | Often unavailable |
| Training resources | Regular, funded | Rare, self-funded |

### Funding Realities

| Defendant Type | Expert Access | Average Funding |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Privately retained | Full access | $10,000-50,000+ |
| Public defender | Limited | $500-2,500 typical cap |
| Pro se | Essentially none | None |

## Recent Developments

### Positive Trends

- Texas Forensic Science Commission providing model for oversight
- Some jurisdictions abandoning bite mark evidence
- Increased DNA exonerations raising awareness
- OSAC developing consensus standards
- Some labs achieving structural independence

### Continuing Concerns

- Pattern evidence still widely admitted
- Hair microscopy still used in some jurisdictions
- Cognitive bias measures rarely implemented
- Defense access remains inadequate
- Oversight mechanisms remain weak
