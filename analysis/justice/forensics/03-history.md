# Forensic Science Reform: History

## The Development of Forensic Science in America

The history of forensic science in the United States is marked by the adoption of techniques based on intuition, practitioner experience, and courtroom persuasiveness rather than rigorous scientific validation. This history explains why so many forensic disciplines lack the scientific foundation that courts and juries assume they possess.

## Timeline of Forensic Science Development

| Cases reviewed | 268 cases (of 2,500+) |
| Cases with errors | 257 (96%) |
| Cases with overstated testimony | 95%+ |
| Defendants subsequently executed | 14 |
| Defendants who died in prison | 9 |
| Defendants still incarcerated | Unknown |

## Key Reports and Their Findings

### NAS 2009 Report: "Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States"

The National Academy of Sciences report was the most comprehensive critique of forensic science to date:

**Key Findings:**

1. With the exception of nuclear DNA analysis, no forensic method has been rigorously shown to have the capacity to consistently, and with a high degree of certainty, demonstrate a connection between evidence and a specific individual or source

2. The forensic science system has serious problems that can only be addressed by a national commitment to overhaul the current structure

3. Forensic laboratories are underfunded, understaffed, and have no mechanism to ensure quality

4. There are no mandatory certification requirements for forensic practitioners

5. The interpretation of forensic evidence is not always based on scientific studies to determine validity

**Recommendations:**

- Create National Institute of Forensic Science
- Remove laboratories from law enforcement control
- Establish mandatory accreditation
- Develop rigorous research programs
- Improve education and training
- Standardize terminology

### PCAST 2016 Report: "Forensic Science in Criminal Courts"

The President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology evaluated the scientific validity of forensic methods:

| Method | PCAST Finding |
|--------|---------------|
| Single-source DNA | Foundationally valid |
| Complex DNA mixtures | Needs case-specific assessment |
| Bite marks | Not scientifically valid |
| Latent fingerprints | Foundationally valid; claims should be tempered |
| Firearms identification | Falls short of scientific criteria |
| Footwear analysis | Not valid for identification |
| Hair microscopy | Not valid without DNA confirmation |

### Impact of Reports

| Report | Implementation | Reason for Limited Impact |
|--------|----------------|--------------------------|
| NAS 2009 | Limited | No funding; no enforcement mechanism |
| PCAST 2016 | Minimal | DOJ rejected findings; administration change |
| NCFS recommendations | Partial | Commission disbanded 2017 |

## Landmark Legal Cases

### Admissibility Standards

| Case | Year | Holding | Impact |
|------|------|---------|--------|
| Frye v. United States | 1923 | "General acceptance" standard | Dominated for 70 years |
| Daubert v. Merrell Dow | 1993 | Scientific validity factors | New federal standard |
| General Electric v. Joiner | 1997 | Abuse of discretion review | Limited appeals |
| Kumho Tire v. Carmichael | 1999 | Daubert applies to all expert testimony | Extended Daubert |

### Cases Challenging Forensic Evidence

| Case | Year | Evidence Type | Outcome |
|------|------|---------------|---------|
| United States v. Llera Plaza | 2002 | Fingerprints | Initially limited, then allowed |
| United States v. Green | 2009 | Firearms | Challenged but admitted |
| Pettus v. State (Texas) | 2019 | Bite marks | Conviction overturned |

## Lessons from History

1. **Techniques were adopted without validation**: Most forensic methods entered courtrooms based on practitioner claims, not scientific research

2. **Courts failed as gatekeepers**: Judges consistently deferred to practitioners rather than demanding scientific proof

3. **Law enforcement development created bias**: Techniques developed by police for police created inherent conflicts

4. **Scandals reveal systemic problems**: Each scandal exposed failures that existed elsewhere undetected

5. **Reform is slow and resisted**: Despite overwhelming evidence, reform faces constant opposition

6. **Innocent people pay the price**: The human cost of forensic failures is measured in decades of wrongful imprisonment
