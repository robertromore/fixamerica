**Challenges:**
- Political resistance from law enforcement and prosecutorial organizations
- Cost of implementation
- Federalism concerns regarding state laboratories
- Transition period disruption to ongoing cases

**Refinements:**
- Consider phased implementation with longer timelines
- Include grandfather provisions for pending cases
- Add expedited review for methods currently in widespread use
- Include judicial training component

**Purpose:** Establish federal requirements for disclosure of forensic evidence limitations, create remedies for forensic errors, and fund retroactive case review when forensic methods are discredited.

**Draft Text:**

```
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Wrongful Conviction Prevention Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) DNA exonerations have demonstrated that forensic evidence contributed to
    wrongful convictions in more than half of documented cases.

(2) The FBI's 2015 review of microscopic hair comparison testimony revealed
    errors in more than 95 percent of reviewed cases.

(3) Multiple forensic methods have been scientifically discredited after
    being used in thousands of criminal cases.

(4) Defendants whose convictions relied on now-discredited forensic evidence
    deserve the opportunity for case review.

(5) Preventing future wrongful convictions requires improved forensic
    practices and adequate disclosure of limitations.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:

(1) DISCREDITED FORENSIC METHOD.—The term "discredited forensic method"
    means a forensic science method that has been determined by the National
    Institute of Forensic Science, the National Academy of Sciences, or
    other authoritative scientific body to lack foundational validity.

    (A) the use of a discredited forensic method;
    (B) material misstatement of forensic conclusions in testimony or reports;
    (C) failure to disclose known limitations of forensic evidence;
    (D) contamination or mishandling of evidence; or
    (E) other forensic practice that undermines the reliability of evidence.

SEC. 4. POST-CONVICTION REVIEW FOR FORENSIC ERRORS.

(a) RIGHT TO REVIEW.—Any person convicted of a Federal crime whose conviction
    relied in whole or in part on—
    (1) a discredited forensic method; or
    (2) forensic evidence that has been shown to be erroneous or unreliable;
    shall be entitled to petition for review of the conviction.

(b) STANDARD FOR RELIEF.—
    (1) The court shall vacate the conviction if the court finds that the
        forensic error more likely than not contributed to the conviction.
    (2) The court shall order a new trial if—
        (A) the forensic error likely contributed to the conviction; and
        (B) there is sufficient remaining evidence to warrant prosecution.

(c) DISCOVERY.—Upon filing of a petition, the petitioner shall be entitled
    to—
    (1) access to all forensic evidence in the case;
    (2) access to laboratory records and protocols;
    (3) appointment of a forensic expert if indigent; and
    (4) any evidence in the possession of the government that may be relevant
        to the claim.

(d) NOTIFICATION REQUIREMENT.—When a forensic method is discredited or
    systemic forensic errors are identified—
    (1) the Department of Justice shall identify all Federal cases in which
        the method or error was present;
    (2) notify all affected defendants or their counsel; and
    (3) provide information about the right to petition for review.

SEC. 5. COMPENSATION FOR WRONGFUL CONVICTION.

(a) FEDERAL COMPENSATION.—Any person whose Federal conviction is vacated or
    reversed based on forensic error shall be entitled to compensation of—
    (1) not less than $75,000 for each year of incarceration; plus
    (2) compensation for any additional documented harms.

(b) CONDITIONS.—
    (1) Compensation under this section shall not require proof that the
        petitioner is actually innocent.
    (2) Compensation shall be in addition to any other remedy available.
    (3) Acceptance of compensation shall not constitute a waiver of civil
        claims.

(c) REINTEGRATION SERVICES.—Persons whose convictions are vacated shall be
    entitled to—
    (1) immediate release;
    (2) expungement of the conviction;
    (3) transitional assistance including housing, employment, and healthcare;
    (4) mental health services; and
    (5) assistance with restoration of civil rights.

SEC. 6. GRANTS FOR STATE CASE REVIEW.

(a) AUTHORIZATION.—The Attorney General shall award grants to States to—
    (1) conduct systematic review of cases involving discredited forensic
        methods;
    (2) provide legal representation for defendants seeking review;
    (3) establish conviction integrity units; and
    (4) provide compensation and services for exonerees.

(b) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.—There are authorized to be appropriated
    $200,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2025 through 2035 to carry out this
    section.

SEC. 7. IMMUNITY LIMITATIONS.

(a) FORENSIC ANALYST LIABILITY.—A forensic analyst shall not be entitled to
    qualified immunity in a civil action arising from—
    (1) intentional falsification of evidence or testimony;
    (2) gross negligence in forensic analysis; or
    (3) failure to disclose known limitations after having been required to do
        so.

(b) PROSECUTOR LIABILITY.—A prosecutor shall not be entitled to absolute
    immunity in a civil action arising from the knowing use of forensic
    evidence that the prosecutor knew or should have known was unreliable.

SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on the date of enactment.
```

**Explanation:** This bill creates remedies for past forensic errors and establishes mechanisms for identifying and notifying affected defendants. It provides compensation for wrongful convictions and limits immunity for egregious forensic misconduct. The bill balances the need for finality in criminal cases against the imperative to correct injustice when forensic methods are discredited.

**Challenges:**
- Significant cost for compensation and case review
- Potential flood of petitions
- Resistance to immunity limitations
- Concerns about reopening settled cases

**Refinements:**
- Consider tiered review process with preliminary screening
- Add statute of limitations provisions
- Include safeguards against frivolous claims
- Phase compensation requirements

```
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "[State] Expert Testimony Standards Act".

SECTION 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

(a) FINDINGS.—The Legislature finds that:
    (1) Forensic experts have historically overstated the certainty and
        reliability of their conclusions.
    (2) Juries may give undue weight to forensic testimony that claims
        certainty not supported by science.
    (3) Standardized testimony language promotes accuracy and fairness.

(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to establish standards for forensic
    expert testimony in criminal proceedings.

SECTION 3. REQUIRED DISCLOSURES.

In any criminal proceeding, a forensic expert shall disclose in testimony:

(a) The scientific basis for the forensic method used;

(b) Whether the method has been validated through peer-reviewed research;

(f) The proficiency of the examiner in applying the method.

SECTION 4. PROHIBITED TESTIMONY.

(a) No forensic expert shall testify that:
    (1) A forensic method is infallible or has a zero error rate;
    (2) Evidence identifies a specific individual "to the exclusion of all
        others" unless supported by validated scientific research;
    (3) A match or identification is "certain," "absolute," or "100 percent"
        unless supported by validated scientific research;
    (4) Two items were made by the same source or came from the same person
        based on pattern evidence, unless the testimony includes appropriate
        qualification regarding uncertainty.

(b) No forensic expert shall use the phrase "reasonable scientific certainty"
    or "reasonable degree of scientific certainty" unless the expert can
    quantify the degree of certainty.

SECTION 5. APPROVED TESTIMONY LANGUAGE.

| Confrontation Clause | Expert testimony standards must preserve right to cross-examination |
| Separation of Powers | Congressional authority under Commerce Clause and Spending Clause; no interference with judicial function |
| Federalism | Federal standards may preempt inconsistent state practices; incentive approach respects state sovereignty |
| Ex Post Facto | Retroactive case review raises potential concerns; remedied by treating as procedural rather than substantive |

### Preemption Analysis

| Federal Provision | State Law Effect |
|-------------------|------------------|
| National Institute standards | States may exceed but not fall below |
| Expert testimony requirements | Applicable in federal courts; model for states |
| Laboratory independence | Required for federal cases; incentivized for states |
| Defense expert access | Required for federal cases; model for states |

### Enforcement Mechanisms

| Mechanism | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Evidence exclusion | Non-compliant evidence inadmissible |
| Grant conditions | State funding contingent on compliance |
| Civil liability | Immunity limitations for egregious conduct |
| Professional discipline | Certification and licensing consequences |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| "Grandfathering" of existing methods | Methods in widespread use may avoid rigorous validation | High |
| Definition of "validation" | Weak validation standards could approve questionable methods | High |
| Independence exceptions | Loopholes for "regional labs" or "specialized units" | Medium |
| Funding inadequacy | Insufficient appropriations undermine implementation | High |
| Timeline delays | Extended implementation periods allow continued harm | Medium |
| Voluntary compliance states | States not accepting federal grants may avoid standards | High |
| Expert qualification loopholes | Vague qualification requirements allow unqualified experts | Medium |
| Testimony language circumvention | Experts may find ways to imply certainty without prohibited words | Medium |
| Discovery limitations | Exceptions for "work product" or "ongoing investigation" | Medium |
| Commission capture | Industry influence on oversight commission membership | Medium |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| No private right of action | Individuals cannot sue for violations | Legislative omission |
| Limited retrospective relief | Does not address all past cases | Practical constraints |
| No mandatory state compliance | Federal system cannot mandate state reform | Constitutional limits |
| Insufficient compensation amounts | $75,000/year may be inadequate | Budget constraints |
| No international standards | Does not address cross-border cases | Jurisdictional limits |
| Digital forensics gaps | Rapidly evolving field not fully addressed | Technological change |
| Prosecution resource advantage | Does not fully equalize resources | Structural limits |
| No witness protection | Forensic analysts who report problems vulnerable | Scope limitation |
| No academic requirement | No requirement for scientific education | Political compromise |
| No automatic DNA testing | Does not require DNA testing when available | Cost concerns |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Address grandfathering loophole**: Add requirement that all methods undergo validation within 5 years regardless of current use; create expedited review process for widely-used methods.

2. **Strengthen validation standards**: Specify minimum requirements including:
   - Blind testing protocols
   - Independent replication
   - Published error rates
   - Peer-reviewed publication

3. **Close independence exceptions**: Define independence to explicitly include all units performing forensic analysis; prohibit "detail" arrangements that maintain de facto law enforcement control.

4. **Ensure adequate funding**: Include mandatory appropriations rather than authorizations; index to inflation; tie grant amounts to demonstrated need.

5. **Compress timelines**: Reduce implementation periods; create interim measures effective immediately; require compliance attestations.

6. **Expand coverage to non-grant states**: Condition other federal law enforcement grants on forensic science compliance; use federal court jurisdiction as leverage.

7. **Strengthen expert qualifications**: Require specific credentials and certification; prohibit testimony outside certification area; mandate continuing education.

8. **Prevent testimony circumvention**: Prohibit testimony that "implies" certainty; require pre-approval of testimony language; create enforcement mechanism for violations.

9. **Expand discovery rights**: Narrow exceptions; create presumption of disclosure; sanction discovery violations.

10. **Prevent commission capture**: Limit industry representation; require conflict-of-interest disclosures; mandate scientist majority.

### General Implementation Concerns

| Concern | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------|---------------------|
| Political opposition | Build bipartisan coalition; emphasize accuracy benefits |
| Cost concerns | Document cost of wrongful convictions; show ROI |
| Disruption to cases | Phase implementation; protect pending cases |
| Workforce concerns | Provide transition assistance; protect jobs |
| Technology changes | Include process for regular standard updates |
| Resistance from practitioners | Include practitioners in standard development |
| Judicial resistance | Provide judicial education; emphasize gatekeeping role |
| Law enforcement opposition | Frame as strengthening evidence; engage reform-minded chiefs |
| Federal-state tensions | Use incentives rather than mandates where possible |
| Implementation capacity | Provide technical assistance; allow extended timelines with benchmarks |
