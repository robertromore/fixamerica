# Forensic Science Reform: Overview

Forensic science plays a critical role in the American criminal justice system, yet many forensic disciplines lack the scientific foundation that courts and juries assume they possess. For decades, innocent people have been convicted based on forensic evidence that was later proven unreliable or outright fraudulent. The 2009 National Academy of Sciences report, "Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward," exposed fundamental weaknesses across multiple forensic disciplines, yet meaningful reform has been slow and inconsistent.
