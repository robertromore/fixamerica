## Lessons from History

### Patterns and Trends

1. **Crisis Response → Permanent Expansion**: Each "crisis" leads to detention expansion that becomes permanent
2. **Bipartisan Growth**: Both parties have expanded detention (Clinton 1996, Bush post-9/11, Obama bed mandate, Trump maximum enforcement)
3. **Privatization Accelerates Growth**: Private prison lobbying correlates with expansion
4. **Deterrence Doesn't Work**: Despite expansion, migration continues
5. **Rights Erode Incrementally**: Each era sees further due process restrictions

### Historical Injustices

- Japanese internment parallels noted by scholars
- Racial disparities in enforcement throughout history
- Asylum seekers treated as criminals
- Economic migrants criminalized
- Family separation as recurring practice
