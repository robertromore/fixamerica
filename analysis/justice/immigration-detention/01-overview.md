# Immigration Detention and Enforcement: Overview

## Executive Summary

The United States operates the largest immigration detention system in the world, holding an average of 30,000-50,000 people on any given day in a sprawling network of over 200 facilities. Unlike the criminal justice system, immigration detention is civil in nature, yet detainees often face prison-like conditions, limited legal protections, and indefinite confinement. The system has expanded dramatically since the 1990s, driven by mandatory detention laws, criminal-immigration intersection policies, and the privatization of detention. This expansion has occurred despite evidence that detention is costly, often unnecessary, and causes significant harm to individuals, families, and communities.

## Core Problems

### 1. Mass Incarceration of Civil Detainees

Immigration detention is civil, not criminal, yet individuals—including asylum seekers, long-term residents, and those with pending cases—are confined in jail-like conditions. Unlike criminal defendants, immigration detainees have no constitutional right to appointed counsel, no right to bail hearings in many circumstances, and can be detained indefinitely.

### 2. Privatization and Profit Motive

Over 80% of immigration detainees are held in facilities operated by private prison corporations, primarily GEO Group and CoreCivic. These companies have financial incentives to maintain high detention populations and have lobbied extensively for enforcement-heavy immigration policies. The profit motive conflicts with humane treatment and efficient case processing.

### 3. Dangerous and Degrading Conditions

Investigations by the DHS Office of Inspector General, advocacy organizations, and journalists have documented:

- Inadequate medical and mental health care
- Spoiled food and unsanitary conditions
- Prolonged solitary confinement
- Sexual abuse and harassment
- Use of force violations
- Lack of access to legal materials and counsel

### 4. Due Process Violations

The immigration detention system operates with minimal judicial oversight:

- No right to a bond hearing for many detainees
- No right to appointed counsel
- Immigration judges with massive case backlogs
- Limited ability to gather evidence or locate witnesses while detained
- "Rocket dockets" that prioritize speed over fairness

### 5. Family Separation and Community Destruction

Detention tears apart families, often for months or years:

- U.S. citizen children separated from parents
- Breadwinners removed from households
- Trauma inflicted on children and spouses
- Economic devastation for families
- Community-wide fear and distrust of authorities

### 6. Criminalization of Migration

The "crimmigration" phenomenon has blurred the line between immigration enforcement and criminal law:

- Minor offenses lead to detention and deportation
- Reentry after deportation criminalized
- Local police increasingly involved in enforcement
- Criminal charges used as leverage in immigration cases

### 7. Targeting of Asylum Seekers

Despite legal protections for asylum seekers:

- Many are detained upon arrival
- Credible fear interviews conducted while in detention
- Expedited removal limits due process
- Deterrence policies explicitly target protection seekers

## The Human Cost

Behind every statistic is a human being:

- **Asylum seekers** fleeing persecution, detained upon seeking protection
- **Long-term residents** with U.S. citizen spouses and children, detained for decades-old offenses
- **DACA recipients** and childhood arrivals, detained when status lapses
- **Trafficking survivors** detained before being identified as victims
- **Mentally ill individuals** detained without adequate treatment
- **Elderly and medically vulnerable** people held in facilities unequipped for their care

## Why This Matters

Immigration detention is a test of American values:

- **Constitutional principles**: Due process, equal protection, prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment
- **Human rights obligations**: International treaties and norms governing treatment of migrants
- **Economic rationality**: Detention costs far exceed community-based alternatives
- **Public safety**: Detention does not improve public safety outcomes
- **Democratic accountability**: A largely hidden system with minimal oversight

## Path Forward

Reform is both necessary and possible. This resource outlines:

- Evidence-based alternatives to detention
- Legislative reforms at federal and state levels
- Local policies to limit cooperation with ICE
- Advocacy strategies for systemic change
- Individual actions to support detained persons
