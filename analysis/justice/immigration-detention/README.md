# Immigration Detention and Enforcement: Overview

The United States operates the largest immigration detention system in the world, holding an average of 30,000-50,000 people on any given day in a sprawling network of over 200 facilities. Unlike the criminal justice system, immigration detention is civil in nature, yet detainees often face prison-like conditions, limited legal protections, and indefinite confinement. The system has expanded dramatically since the 1990s, driven by mandatory detention laws, criminal-immigration intersection policies, and the privatization of detention. This expansion has occurred despite evidence that detention is costly, often unnecessary, and causes significant harm to individuals, families, and communities.
