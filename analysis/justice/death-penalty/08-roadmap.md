# Death Penalty Reform: Implementation Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap provides a strategic plan for achieving death penalty abolition in the United States. It recognizes that abolition will primarily occur through state-by-state action, supported by federal policy changes and shifting public opinion. The roadmap is organized in phases with specific milestones, targets, and action items.

## Strategic Framework

### Guiding Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| State-by-state focus | Primary path to abolition |
| Big tent coalition | Include diverse allies |
| Multiple strategies | Legal, legislative, electoral, cultural |
| Harm reduction | Prevent executions while building momentum |
| Evidence-based messaging | Use data and stories effectively |
| Center those impacted | Exonerees, victim families, death row |

### Theory of Change

```
Build Coalitions → Elect Reform Prosecutors → Reduce Death Sentences
       ↓                     ↓                        ↓
Shift Public Opinion → Pass State Legislation → Federal Action
       ↓                     ↓                        ↓
Media/Culture Change → Constitutional Litigation → National Abolition
```
