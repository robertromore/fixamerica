# Death Penalty Reform: History of Capital Punishment in America

## Overview

The history of capital punishment in the United States reflects the nation's evolving understanding of justice, human rights, and state power. From colonial-era public hangings to modern lethal injection, the death penalty has been a persistent yet contested feature of American justice. Understanding this history is essential to comprehending current debates and charting a path forward.

## Colonial Era (1608-1776)

### Early Executions

The first recorded execution in the American colonies occurred in 1608 when Captain George Kendall was executed in Jamestown, Virginia, for spying for Spain.

### Colonial Capital Crimes

| Colony | Number of Capital Offenses | Examples |
|--------|---------------------------|----------|
| Virginia | 14+ | Murder, sodomy, witchcraft |
| Massachusetts | 12+ | Blasphemy, adultery, murder |
| New York | 20+ | Pickpocketing, robbery, murder |
| Pennsylvania | 2 (initially) | Treason, murder |
| Georgia | 10+ | Murder, rape, arson |

### Methods Used

| Method | Prevalence | Notes |
|--------|------------|-------|
| Hanging | Most common | Public spectacle |
| Burning | Occasionally | Especially for women, enslaved people |
| Pressing | Rare | Giles Corey, 1692 |
| Drowning | Rare | Some jurisdictions |
| Breaking on wheel | Rare | Borrowed from Europe |

### Slavery and Capital Punishment

The death penalty in colonial America was deeply intertwined with the institution of slavery:

- **Slave codes**: Enslaved people could be executed for offenses that would result in lesser punishments for white colonists
- **Crimes specific to enslaved people**: Rebellion, striking a white person, running away repeatedly
- **Differential treatment**: By 1860, Virginia had 73 capital crimes for enslaved people versus 1 for whites

## Post-Revolution to Civil War (1776-1865)

### Early Reform Movements

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1787 | Benjamin Rush argues for abolition |
| 1790 | Pennsylvania reduces capital crimes |
| 1794 | Pennsylvania creates "degrees of murder" |
| 1834 | Pennsylvania ends public executions |
| 1846 | Michigan becomes first state to abolish (except treason) |
| 1847 | Michigan fully abolishes death penalty |
| 1852 | Rhode Island abolishes (for most crimes) |
| 1853 | Wisconsin abolishes death penalty |

### Reform Arguments of the Era

Early abolitionists made arguments that remain relevant today:

1. **Religious**: Jesus's teachings on forgiveness and redemption
2. **Utilitarian**: Executions don't deter crime
3. **Humanitarian**: State killing brutalizes society
4. **Error**: Innocent people may be executed
5. **Class-based**: Only the poor are executed

### Methods Evolution

| Period | Primary Method | Notes |
|--------|---------------|-------|
| 1776-1850 | Hanging | Public, then private |
| 1850-1890 | Hanging | Moved inside prisons |
| 1890+ | Electric chair | "Humane" alternative |

## Reconstruction through Progressive Era (1865-1920)

### Post-Civil War Developments

The end of slavery transformed capital punishment:

- **Black codes**: Southern states enacted laws targeting Black citizens
- **Racial terrorism**: Lynching became a tool of racial terror alongside (and often replacing) legal execution
- **Centralization**: Executions moved from counties to state prisons

### Lynching Era

| Decade | Documented Lynchings |
|--------|---------------------|
| 1880s | 1,000+ |
| 1890s | 1,500+ |
| 1900s | 900+ |
| 1910s | 600+ |
| 1920s | 300+ |

### The Electric Chair (1890)

New York introduced the electric chair in 1890, marketed as a "humane" alternative to hanging:

| State | Year Adopted | Last Use |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| New York | 1890 | 1963 |
| Ohio | 1897 | 2002 |
| Texas | 1923 | 1964 |
| Florida | 1924 | 1999 |
| Georgia | 1924 | 1998 |
| Virginia | 1908 | 2013 |
| Tennessee | 1916 | 2007 |

### Capital Crimes Reduction

Progressive era reformers reduced capital offenses:

| State | Capital Crimes (1900) | Capital Crimes (1920) |
|-------|----------------------|----------------------|
| New York | 1 (murder) | 1 |
| Pennsylvania | 2 | 1 |
| Ohio | 2 | 1 |
| Most states | 2-5 | 1-3 |

| Mississippi | 1954 | 1989 |
| North Carolina | 1936 | 1961 |

### Civil Rights Era Impact

The civil rights movement drew attention to racial disparities:

- **Rape cases**: Studies showed Black men were disproportionately executed for rape, especially involving white victims
- **Southern concentration**: Most executions occurred in former Confederate states
- **NAACP Legal Defense Fund**: Began systematic challenges to death penalty

### Furman v. Georgia (1972)

The Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the death penalty as then applied was unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment:

**Key Points from Majority:**
- Justice Douglas: Applied discriminatorily

- Justice White: Too infrequent to serve purpose
- Justice Brennan: Violates human dignity
- Justice Marshall: Unacceptable punishment

**Immediate Impact:**

- 35 states began rewriting laws

## The Modern Era (1976-Present)

### Gregg v. Georgia (1976)

The Supreme Court upheld revised death penalty statutes with "guided discretion":

**Requirements:**
1. Bifurcated trial (guilt phase, penalty phase)

3. Consideration of mitigating factors
4. Automatic appellate review

**States Approved:**
- Georgia (guided discretion)
- Florida (judge override allowed)
- Texas (special questions)

**Mandatory Schemes Rejected:**
