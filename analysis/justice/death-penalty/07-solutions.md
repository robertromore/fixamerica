## Detailed Solution Strategies

### 1. Executive Action Moratoriums

**Description:**
Governors can halt executions through executive moratoriums while death penalty remains on books.

**Current Moratorium States:**

| State | Governor | Since | Scope |
|-------|----------|-------|-------|
| California | Newsom | 2019 | All executions |
| Oregon | Various | 2011 | All executions |
| Pennsylvania | Wolf/Shapiro | 2015 | All executions |
| Ohio | DeWine | 2020 | All executions |
| Arizona | Hobbs | 2023 | Under review |
| Tennessee | Lee | 2022 | Temporary |

**Implementation Steps:**
1. Governor issues executive order halting executions
2. Order cites specific concerns (lethal injection, review needs)
3. Establish commission to study death penalty
4. Use moratorium period to build legislative support
5. Seek permanent legislative abolition

**Advantages:**
- Immediate effect
- No legislative hurdle
- Reversible if needed for political cover
- Provides time for systemic review

**Limitations:**
- Can be reversed by next governor
- Doesn't address death sentences
- May face legal challenges
- Doesn't change underlying law

### 2. State Legislative Abolition

**Description:**
State legislatures pass bills abolishing the death penalty, often replacing it with life without parole.

**Successful Recent Examples:**

| State | Year | Vote | Key Factors |
|-------|------|------|-------------|
| Virginia | 2021 | 22-16 (Senate), 57-41 (House) | New majority, racial justice focus |
| Colorado | 2020 | 19-13 (Senate), 38-27 (House) | Democratic trifecta |
| New Hampshire | 2019 | Veto override | Bipartisan coalition |
| Delaware | 2016 | Court decision | State supreme court |
| Maryland | 2013 | 82-56 (House), 27-20 (Senate) | Governor leadership |

**Model Legislative Approach:**
1. Prospective abolition (future cases only) or retroactive
2. Mandatory life without parole for capital-eligible crimes
3. Victim family services provisions
4. Cost savings allocation (crime prevention, victim services)
5. Study of past cases for potential resentencing

**Coalition Building:**
- Conservative fiscal hawks (cost argument)
- Religious communities (redemption, life)
- Law enforcement voices (reform prosecutors)
- Victim families against death penalty
- Business community (state image)
- Bipartisan sponsors

**Legislative Strategy:**

| Phase | Actions |
|-------|---------|
| Pre-introduction | Count votes, identify sponsors, build coalition |
| Committee | Expert testimony, victim family voices, cost data |
| Floor debate | Prepared amendments, counter-arguments ready |
| Governor | Pre-negotiated signing or veto override strategy |
| Implementation | Monitor resentencing, victim services |

### 3. Prosecutorial Reform

**Description:**
Elect reform-minded prosecutors who decline to seek the death penalty, or establish guidelines limiting death penalty seeking.

**Reform Prosecutor Impact:**

| Los Angeles | Gascon | No death penalty seeking | Zero new death sentences |
| Orlando | Worrell | No death penalty seeking | Policy change |
| Dallas | Creuzot | Rarely seeks death | Dramatic reduction |

**Implementation Strategies:**

| Strategy | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Electoral campaigns | Support reform DA candidates |
| Policy advocacy | Push sitting DAs to change policy |
| Accountability measures | Track and publicize death-seeking rates |
| Professional standards | ABA guidelines on death penalty |
| Office policies | Written criteria for death penalty decisions |

**Electoral Strategy:**
- Identify winnable DA races
- Recruit qualified reform candidates
- Fund primary and general campaigns
- Mobilize voters around criminal justice reform
- Hold elected DAs accountable

### 4. Judicial Reform

|--------|-----------|
| End judicial elections | Remove political pressure |
