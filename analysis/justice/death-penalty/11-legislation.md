# Death Penalty Reform: Model Legislation

## Overview

This document provides model legislation for death penalty abolition at both the federal and state levels. It includes draft statutory language, constitutional considerations, and analysis of potential loopholes and shortcomings. The legislative approach prioritizes abolition while addressing practical implementation concerns including resentencing of current death row inmates, victim family rights, and cost reallocation.

## Federal Legislation

### Federal Death Penalty Abolition Act

**Purpose:** To abolish the federal death penalty, commute existing federal death sentences, and prohibit the use of federal resources to support state executions.

**Draft Text:**

```
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Federal Death Penalty Abolition Act of 2025".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) Since the reinstatement of the federal death penalty in 1988, 50 
    individuals have been sentenced to death by federal courts, and 16 
    have been executed.

(2) The federal death penalty has been applied in a racially disparate 
    manner, with Black defendants comprising approximately 45 percent 
    of federal death row despite constituting 13 percent of the 
    national population.

(3) The federal death penalty costs significantly more than alternative 
    sentences of life imprisonment without possibility of release.

(4) There is no credible evidence that the federal death penalty deters 
    crime more effectively than long-term imprisonment.

(5) The risk of executing innocent individuals is unacceptable in a 
    system of justice, and at least 195 individuals have been exonerated 
    from death rows nationwide since 1973.

(6) The United States stands virtually alone among developed democracies 
    in retaining the death penalty, undermining American moral leadership 
    on human rights.

(7) Life imprisonment without possibility of release provides effective 
    public safety while avoiding the moral hazard of state-administered 
    death.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

(a) DEATH PENALTY.—The term "death penalty" means a sentence of death 
    imposed as criminal punishment.

        the Senate shall prepare a revised edition of title 18, United 
        States Code, to reflect the amendments made by this subsection.

SEC. 5. COMMUTATION OF EXISTING SENTENCES.

(a) AUTOMATIC COMMUTATION.—On the date of enactment of this Act, the

SEC. 7. VICTIM SERVICES.

(a) AUTHORIZATION.—There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as 
    may be necessary to provide comprehensive services to victims of 
    violent crime and their family members, including:

```

**Explanation:**

This comprehensive federal abolition bill:
- Eliminates the death penalty for all federal crimes
- Automatically commutes existing death sentences to life without parole
- Allows individualized resentencing petitions
- Prohibits federal resources from supporting state executions
- Provides for victim services
- Requires a retrospective study of the federal death penalty system

**Constitutional Considerations:**

- Congress has clear authority to determine federal criminal penalties
- No constitutional bar to abolishing federal death penalty
- Commutation provision may face retroactivity challenges but is supported by clemency power analogy
- Prohibition on supporting state executions raises federalism questions but is within spending power

**Potential Challenges:**

| Challenge | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Congressional opposition | Build bipartisan coalition, emphasize costs |
| Victim family opposition | Include robust victim services, notification rights |
| Prosecutor opposition | Address through reporting requirements, alternatives |
| States' rights arguments | Limit to federal system, indirect state influence |

### Federal Racial Justice in Capital Punishment Act

**Purpose:** To allow defendants to use statistical evidence of racial bias in challenging death sentences, addressing the barrier created by *McCleskey v. Kemp*.

**Draft Text:**

```
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Racial Justice in Capital Punishment Act of 2025".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(1) The Supreme Court in McCleskey v. Kemp (1987) held that statistical 
    evidence of racial disparity in capital sentencing is insufficient 
    to establish an equal protection violation absent proof of intentional 
    discrimination in the individual case.

(2) Since McCleskey, multiple studies have confirmed persistent racial 
    disparities in capital charging and sentencing.

(3) The race of the victim remains the strongest predictor of capital 
    outcomes, with cases involving white victims far more likely to 
    result in death sentences.

(4) These disparities violate principles of equal justice and undermine 
    the legitimacy of the criminal justice system.

SEC. 3. USE OF STATISTICAL EVIDENCE.

(a) IN GENERAL.—In any proceeding in Federal court seeking to set aside 
    a sentence of death on grounds of racial discrimination, the defendant 
    may present statistical evidence demonstrating that:
    (1) Race was a statistically significant factor in decisions to seek 
        or impose the death penalty in the relevant jurisdiction; and
    (2) The pattern cannot be explained by legitimate, race-neutral 
        factors.

(b) BURDEN SHIFTING.—If the defendant establishes a prima facie case 
    under subsection (a), the burden shall shift to the prosecution to 
    prove by clear and convincing evidence that race was not a factor 
    in the decision to seek or impose the death penalty in the 
    defendant's case.

(c) RELIEF.—If the court finds that race was a significant factor in 
    the decision to seek or impose the death penalty in the defendant's 
    case, the court shall:
    (1) Vacate the death sentence; and
    (2) Resentence the defendant to a term of imprisonment.

SEC. 4. PROSPECTIVE APPLICATION.

(a) DATA COLLECTION.—The Attorney General shall collect and publish data 
    on capital charging decisions in Federal cases, including the race 
    of the defendant and victim in each case.

(b) PROSECUTORIAL GUIDELINES.—The Attorney General shall issue guidelines 
    to minimize the influence of race in capital charging decisions.

SEC. 5. APPLICABILITY.

This Act shall apply to any case in which a sentence of death was 
imposed and remains in effect as of the date of enactment.
```

### Federal Death Penalty Moratorium Act

**Purpose:** To impose an immediate moratorium on federal executions pending comprehensive review.

**Draft Text:**

```
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Federal Death Penalty Moratorium Act of 2025".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that a moratorium on Federal executions is necessary to 
permit comprehensive examination of the Federal death penalty system 
and to prevent irreversible harm while such review is conducted.

SEC. 3. MORATORIUM.

(a) IN GENERAL.—No person may be executed for a Federal offense until 
    the Commission established under section 4 has submitted its final 
    report and Congress has acted upon the Commission's recommendations.

(b) DURATION.—The moratorium shall remain in effect for a minimum of 
    5 years from the date of enactment.

SEC. 4. NATIONAL COMMISSION ON THE DEATH PENALTY.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—There is established the National Commission on the 
    Death Penalty.

(b) MEMBERSHIP.—The Commission shall consist of 13 members appointed as 
    follows:
    (1) Four members appointed by the President;
    (2) Two members appointed by the Speaker of the House;
    (3) Two members appointed by the Minority Leader of the House;
    (4) Two members appointed by the Majority Leader of the Senate;
    (5) Two members appointed by the Minority Leader of the Senate; and
    (6) One member who is a family member of a murder victim, appointed 
        by consensus of the other appointing authorities.

(c) QUALIFICATIONS.—Members shall include individuals with expertise in:
    (1) Criminal law and procedure;
    (2) Forensic science;
    (3) Psychology and mental health;
    (4) Victim advocacy;
    (5) Civil rights; and
    (6) Cost analysis.

(d) DUTIES.—The Commission shall:

    (2) Analyze racial, geographic, and socioeconomic disparities;
    (3) Review cases of alleged innocence;
    (4) Assess costs and resource allocation;
    (5) Evaluate the impact on victims and their families; and
    (6) Make recommendations regarding the future of the Federal death 
        penalty.

(e) REPORT.—Not later than 3 years after the date of enactment, the 
    Commission shall submit to Congress a comprehensive report including 
    its findings and recommendations.

### State Racial Justice Act (Capital Punishment)

**Purpose:** To address racial disparities in capital sentencing through statistical evidence.

**Draft Text:**

```
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "[State] Racial Justice Act".

of the death penalty undermines the integrity of the criminal justice 
system and violates fundamental principles of equal protection.

SECTION 3. CLAIMS BASED ON STATISTICAL EVIDENCE.

(a) A person may seek relief from a death sentence by filing a motion 
    alleging that race was a significant factor in the decision to seek 
    or impose the death penalty.

(b) A finding that race was a significant factor may be established 
    through:
    (1) Statistical evidence showing that death sentences were sought 
        or imposed significantly more frequently against persons of one 
        race than another, or as punishment for crimes involving victims 
        of one race more than another; and
    (2) Such disparity is not explained by case characteristics that are

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| Eighth Amendment | Current standards permit death penalty with proper procedures |
| Fourteenth Amendment | Equal protection requires addressing racial disparities |
| Federalism | States have broad authority over criminal punishment |
| Retroactivity | Commutation is generally permissible; new trials may not be required |
| Separation of powers | Legislative abolition is clearly within legislative authority |

### Preemption

| Scenario | Analysis |
|----------|----------|
| Federal abolition | Does not preempt state death penalty |
| State abolition | Binding only on state system |
| Federal fund restrictions | Spending power allows conditions on grants |
| Drug restrictions | FDA authority over pharmaceuticals |

### Enforcement

| Mechanism | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Private right of action | Allow defendants to enforce racial justice provisions |
| Attorney general enforcement | State AG oversight of local prosecutors |
| Judicial review | Courts can enforce statutory standards |
| Professional discipline | Bar discipline for violations |

---

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Federal-state divide | Federal abolition doesn't affect state death penalty | High |
| Prospective only | Prospective abolition leaves death row intact | Medium |
| Resentencing discretion | Courts may deny resentencing petitions | Medium |
| Statistical threshold | Racial justice acts require high statistical proof | High |
| Committee recommendations | Review committee opinions may be advisory only | Medium |
| Victim veto | Victim families could potentially block commutation | Medium |
| Drug source workarounds | States find new lethal injection drug sources | High |
| Method alternatives | States adopt new execution methods | High |
| Gubernatorial override | Future governors may reverse moratoriums | High |
| Sunset provisions | Moratoriums expire without legislative action | Medium |
| Resentencing delays | Courts may delay resentencing proceedings | Low |
| Data collection gaps | Incomplete data undermines racial justice claims | Medium |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| State-by-state approach | Uneven protection, long timeline | Federalism |
| Victim family division | Some families feel unheard | Diverse victim perspectives |
| Prosecutor resistance | Local DAs may resist state guidelines | Elected prosecutors |
| Resource allocation | Cost savings not always directed to intended purposes | Budget politics |
| Death row conditions | Conditions may not improve post-abolition | Corrections system inertia |
| Innocence backlog | Exoneration cases take years to resolve | Judicial capacity |
| Public defender capacity | Even with more funding, capacity is limited | Structural underfunding |
| Cultural change lag | Public opinion may lag behind legal change | Deeply held beliefs |
| Political vulnerability | Reforms can be reversed with political change | Electoral cycles |
| Interstate variation | Defendants face different rules by state | Constitutional structure |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Address federal-state divide**: Include federal incentives for state abolition in federal legislation; condition criminal justice grants on abolition or meaningful reform.

2. **Mandate retroactive application**: Draft abolition bills with automatic commutation provisions rather than prospective-only language.

3. **Strengthen resentencing rights**: Create presumption in favor of resentencing for defendants meeting basic criteria; limit judicial discretion to deny.

4. **Lower statistical thresholds**: Racial justice acts should require only preponderance of evidence, not clear and convincing proof.

5. **Make review binding**: Capital case review committees should have authority to prohibit death-seeking, not merely recommend.

6. **Balance victim input**: Ensure victim family voices are heard but not given veto power over public policy decisions.

7. **Federal drug controls**: Use FDA authority and pharmaceutical company agreements to restrict execution drug availability nationwide.

8. **Method challenges**: Pursue constitutional litigation against all execution methods, not just lethal injection.

9. **Codify moratoriums**: Convert executive moratoriums into statutory prohibitions requiring legislative action to reverse.

10. **Permanent legislation**: Avoid sunset provisions in abolition legislation; make changes permanent.

11. **Resentencing timelines**: Set mandatory timelines for courts to rule on resentencing petitions.

12. **Robust data requirements**: Mandate comprehensive data collection with enforcement mechanisms and public reporting.

### General Implementation Concerns

| Concern | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------|---------------------|
| Political reversal | Build broad coalitions; embed in state constitution |
| Prosecutor circumvention | Strong oversight mechanisms; electoral accountability |
| Victim family backlash | Robust victim services; diverse family voices |
| Public opinion shift | Ongoing public education; highlight exonerations |
| Resource capture | Dedicated funding streams; audit requirements |
| Transition chaos | Detailed implementation plans; transition funding |
| Death row population issues | Gradual integration; specialized housing |
| Legal challenges | Careful constitutional drafting; severability clauses |
| Enforcement gaps | Multiple enforcement mechanisms; private rights of action |
| Interstate coordination | National organization support; model legislation sharing |
