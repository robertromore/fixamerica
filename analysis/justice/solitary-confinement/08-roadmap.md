## Resource Requirements

### Coalition Operating Budget

| Category | Year 1 | Year 2 | Years 3-4 |
|----------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Staff (coordinator, organizers) | $150,000 | $200,000 | $175,000 |
| Communications | $50,000 | $75,000 | $40,000 |
| Lobby activities | $25,000 | $50,000 | $25,000 |
| Research and data | $30,000 | $20,000 | $30,000 |
| Survivor support | $25,000 | $35,000 | $25,000 |
| Events and mobilization | $20,000 | $40,000 | $20,000 |
| Litigation (if needed) | — | $100,000+ | $100,000+ |
| **Total** | **$300,000** | **$520,000** | **$415,000** |

### State Implementation Costs (Example Medium-Sized State)

| Category | One-Time | Annual Ongoing |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| Staff training | $500,000 | $100,000 |
| Alternative unit development | $2,000,000 | — |
| Mental health staffing | — | $1,500,000 |
| Programming | $200,000 | $500,000 |
| Oversight body | $100,000 | $300,000 |
| Data systems | $250,000 | $50,000 |
| **Total** | **$3,050,000** | **$2,450,000** |

**Offset**: Reducing solitary population reduces per-person costs ($75,000 → $35,000). A reduction of 500 people saves $20 million annually.

## Contingency Plans

### If Legislation Stalls

| Situation | Alternative Approach |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Committee blocks bill | Target committee members, build pressure |
| Majority not achievable | Pursue partial reforms (vulnerable populations first) |
| Governor hostile | Wait for election, build public support |
| Litigation success | Use court order as leverage |

### If Implementation Fails

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| DOC ignores requirements | Litigation for enforcement |
| Regulations undermine law | Challenge regulations, seek legislative fix |
| Numbers don't decrease | Document non-compliance, public pressure |
| Incident used to roll back | Rapid response messaging, data on overall safety |

## Long-Term Sustainability

|----------|---------|
| Ongoing monitoring | Ensure continued compliance |
| Data analysis | Track long-term outcomes |
| Legislative refinement | Address gaps, strengthen law |
