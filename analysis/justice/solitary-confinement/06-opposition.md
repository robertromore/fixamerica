# Solitary Confinement Reform: Opposition

## Understanding the Opposition

Effective reform requires understanding, anticipating, and countering opposition arguments. Corrections officials, officers' unions, and some politicians consistently deploy a set of arguments against reducing solitary confinement use. This document examines these arguments and provides evidence-based responses.

## Primary Opposition Groups

### 1. Correctional Officers' Unions

| Union | State/Jurisdiction | Political Influence |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|
| CCPOA | California | Very High (major political donor) |
| NYSCOPBA | New York | High |
| AFSCME (corrections locals) | Multiple states | High |
| FOP (corrections chapters) | Multiple states | Moderate-High |

**Core Claims**:
- Solitary is essential for officer safety
- Reform puts staff at risk
- Advocates don't understand prison realities
- "We're the experts"

### 2. Departments of Corrections

| Position Type | Common Arguments |
|---------------|------------------|
| Directors/Commissioners | Need "flexibility," alternatives are expensive |
| Wardens | Facility safety concerns, maintaining order |
| Security staff | Safety, control, "what we've always done" |

### 3. Political Opposition

| Group | Motivation |
|-------|------------|
| "Law and order" politicians | Electoral positioning |
| Rural legislators | Protecting prison jobs in districts |
| Victims' rights advocates (some) | Belief that harsh punishment helps victims |

### 4. Private Prison Industry

| Interest | Concern |
|----------|---------|
| Contract terms | May specify bed counts, housing types |
| Per diem rates | Higher rates for restrictive housing |
| Avoiding investment | Alternatives require programming |

## Common Arguments and Rebuttals

### Argument 1: "Solitary Is Necessary for Safety"

**Claim**: "We need solitary to protect staff and other prisoners from dangerous individuals."

| Point | Counter-Evidence |
|-------|-----------------|
| Protects staff | Colorado: 85% solitary reduction, no increase in staff assaults |
| Protects other prisoners | Many in solitary for minor, non-violent infractions |
| Controls dangerous people | Solitary creates more dangerous people upon return |
| Prevents violence | Violence often increases after solitary exposure |

**Data from Reform States**:

| State | Solitary Reduction | Staff Assault Change |
|-------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Colorado | 85% | No significant increase |
| North Dakota | 70%+ | Decreased |
| Washington | Significant | No increase |

**Response**: "The evidence shows that reducing solitary does NOT increase violence. In fact, isolation makes people more volatile. States like Colorado have dramatically reduced solitary use without any increase in staff or prisoner assaults. The 'safety' argument isn't supported by data."

### Argument 2: "Those in Solitary Are the Worst of the Worst"

**Claim**: "Solitary is reserved for the most dangerous, violent individuals who can't be managed any other way."

| Reality | Evidence |
|---------|----------|
| Many placed for minor infractions | Talking back, having extra food, minor rule violations |
| Mentally ill overrepresented | 25-50% have mental health conditions |
| Racial disparities | Black prisoners placed at higher rates |
| Arbitrary decisions | Same behavior leads to different outcomes |

**Examples of Infractions Leading to Solitary**:
- Possessing too many postage stamps
- Refusing to cut hair
- Having prohibited reading material
- Being in wrong location at wrong time
- "Disrespect" to officers

**Response**: "Actually, many people in solitary are there for minor rule violations, not dangerous violence. Studies consistently show that a quarter to half of those in solitary have mental illness—they're often punished for symptoms, not dangerousness. The 'worst of the worst' narrative doesn't match reality."

### Argument 3: "We Need It as a Deterrent"

**Claim**: "The threat of solitary deters misconduct and maintains order."

| Claim | Counter-Evidence |
|-------|-----------------|
| Deters rule-breaking | No evidence of deterrent effect |
| Maintains order | Facilities with less solitary often have better order |
| Necessary threat | Alternatives (positive incentives) more effective |

**Research**:
- No studies demonstrate deterrent effect of solitary threat
- Facilities with robust programming have fewer incidents
- Positive behavior incentives outperform punishment

**Response**: "There's no evidence that the threat of solitary actually deters misconduct. What does work is giving people reasons to behave well—access to programs, privileges, family contact. Punishment-based systems don't create the order they promise."

### Argument 4: "Reform Is Too Expensive"

**Claim**: "Alternatives to solitary require expensive programming and staffing we can't afford."

| Claim | Reality |
|-------|---------|
| Solitary is cheap | Costs 2-3x more than general population |
| Alternatives are expensive | Often cost-neutral or save money |
| Can't afford change | Can't afford NOT to change (litigation, healthcare costs) |

**Cost Comparison**:

| Housing Type | Annual Cost per Person |
|--------------|----------------------|
| General population | $25,000-35,000 |
| Solitary confinement | $75,000-100,000+ |
| Step-down programs | $40,000-50,000 |

**Response**: "Solitary confinement is actually MORE expensive than general population housing—often two to three times the cost. The lawsuits, the healthcare costs for damaged individuals, the higher recidivism—these are expensive. Alternatives often save money while improving outcomes."

### Argument 5: "Outsiders Don't Understand Prisons"

**Claim**: "Advocates, legislators, and courts don't understand the reality of running a prison. We're the experts."

| Claim | Counter |
|-------|---------|
| Advocates don't understand | Many advocates are survivors or family members |
| We're the experts | Expertise includes blind spots and conflicts of interest |
| Outsiders shouldn't interfere | Constitutional oversight is legitimate |

**Response**: "Many advocates ARE experts—they've lived through solitary themselves or have family members who have. And some corrections officials ARE leading reform—they understand that what we've been doing doesn't work. External oversight exists because the Constitution doesn't stop at prison gates."

### Argument 6: "We've Already Reformed"

**Claim**: "We've made changes. We don't call it 'solitary' anymore. Our 'restrictive housing' is different."

| Tactic | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| Name changes | "Restrictive housing" is still isolation |
| Cosmetic reforms | Extra hour out-of-cell doesn't fix 23-hour isolation |
| Policy vs. practice | Policies may change while practice continues |

**Common Euphemisms**:
- Restrictive Housing
- Intensive Management
- Administrative Segregation
- Close Management
- Secure Housing
- Special Management

**Response**: "Changing the name doesn't change the harm. If someone is still in a cell for 22+ hours a day with minimal human contact, it's still solitary—regardless of what it's called. We need substantive change, not relabeling."

### Argument 7: "Reforms Will Lead to Chaos"

**Claim**: "If we reduce solitary, prisons will become unmanageable. There will be violence."

| Prediction | What Actually Happened |
|------------|----------------------|
| Chaos in Colorado | 85% reduction, order maintained |
| Violence in New York | HALT Act implementation ongoing, no crisis |
| Unmanageable | Alternatives provide better management tools |

**Response**: "We've now seen multiple states dramatically reduce solitary without the predicted chaos. Colorado, North Dakota, Connecticut—they've proven it can be done safely. The chaos predictions were wrong."

### Argument 8: "Some People Must Never Get Out"

**Claim**: "There are individuals so dangerous they should never leave solitary."

| Claim | Counter |
|-------|---------|
| Forever dangerous | Decades of isolation created that danger |
| Can't be managed | Aren't given opportunity with alternatives |
| No possibility of change | Humans can change; isolation prevents it |

**Response**: "Indefinite isolation is torture under international law for good reason—it destroys people's minds. The 'forever dangerous' individuals often became that way BECAUSE of prolonged isolation. With proper support, even those with serious issues can be managed in less restrictive settings. We've seen it happen."

## Opposition Tactics

### Delay and Deflection

| Tactic | Example |
|--------|---------|
| "We're studying it" | Years of "study" with no action |
| "We need more data" | Ignoring existing evidence |
| "Pilot programs" | Small pilots that never scale |
| "It's complicated" | Avoiding simple first steps |

### Fear-Mongering

| Tactic | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Highlighting rare incidents | One violent incident used to oppose all reform |
| Parading victims | Using crime victims to oppose change |
| Worst-case scenarios | "What if a terrorist..." |
| Officer safety claims | Without evidence |

### Cooption

| Tactic | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Symbolic reforms | Name changes without substance |
| Hiring reform advocates | To control/silence them |
| Claiming credit | Taking credit for court-mandated changes |
| "We're already doing that" | Exaggerating existing efforts |

### Political Pressure

| Tactic | Example |
|--------|---------|
| Union campaign contributions | Pressuring legislators |
| Lobbying | DOC directors lobbying against reform bills |
| Electoral threats | "Soft on crime" attacks |
| Relationships | Corrections-friendly legislators |

## Countering Opposition

### Evidence-Based Responses

| Their Claim | Provide |
|-------------|---------|
| Safety concerns | Data from reform states |
| Cost concerns | Cost-benefit analyses |
| Expert claims | Survivor testimony, outside experts |
| Predictions of chaos | Track record of successful reforms |

### Coalition Building

| Strategy | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Find corrections allies | Reform-minded wardens, officers |

### Sustained Pressure

| Approach | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Multi-year campaigns | Opposition counts on attention fading |
| Multiple strategies | Litigation + legislation + advocacy |
| Regular accountability | Track implementation, call out failures |
