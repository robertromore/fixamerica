# Solitary Confinement Reform: Overview

## Executive Summary

Solitary confinement—the practice of isolating incarcerated individuals in cells for 22-24 hours per day with minimal human contact—represents one of the most severe and psychologically damaging practices in the American correctional system. Despite overwhelming evidence of its harm and limited effectiveness, the United States continues to hold an estimated 80,000-100,000 people in some form of restrictive housing on any given day, making it one of the most prolific users of isolation in the world.

This practice, recognized by the United Nations as torture when extended beyond 15 consecutive days, produces lasting psychological damage, increases recidivism, and disproportionately affects vulnerable populations including those with mental illness, youth, LGBTQ individuals, and Black and brown communities. Reform is not merely a matter of humane treatment—it is essential for public safety, fiscal responsibility, and constitutional compliance.

| Facilities using restrictive housing | 99% of state prisons | BJS 2021 |
| Average cost per solitary cell annually | $75,000-$100,000 | Vera Institute |
| Cost per general population cell annually | $25,000-$35,000 | Vera Institute |
| Suicide rate in solitary vs. general population | 6-12x higher | JAMA Psychiatry |
| People with mental illness in solitary | 25-50% | ACLU |
| States with no durational limits | 30+ | Solitary Watch |
| People held in solitary 3+ years | 6,000+ | ASCA-Liman |
| Recidivism rate for those released directly from solitary | 64% higher | Washington State DOC |

## Terminology Guide

The practice of isolation goes by many names, often used by corrections officials to obscure its nature:

| Term | Common Usage | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| **Solitary Confinement** | General public, advocates | Most accurate descriptor |
| **Restrictive Housing** | Federal Bureau of Prisons | Preferred bureaucratic term |
| **Administrative Segregation** | State DOCs | Implies non-punitive purpose |
| **Security Housing Unit (SHU)** | California, federal | Pronounced "shoe" |
| **Special Housing Unit** | New York, federal | Same acronym, different name |
| **Segregated Housing** | Various states | Euphemistic |
| **Close Management** | Florida | Obscures isolation nature |
| **Intensive Management Unit** | Washington | Implies treatment focus |
| **Supermax** | Public, media | High-security isolation facility |
| **The Hole** | Incarcerated people | Colloquial term |
| **The Box** | Northeast prisons | Colloquial term |

## Core Problems

### 1. Psychological Torture
The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture has determined that solitary confinement beyond 15 days constitutes torture or cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. Documented effects include:
- Anxiety and panic attacks
- Depression and hopelessness
- Hallucinations and psychosis
- Self-harm and suicidal ideation
- Hypersensitivity to stimuli
- Paranoia and hostility
- Cognitive impairment
- Post-traumatic stress disorder

### 2. Disproportionate Impact on Vulnerable Populations
- **People with mental illness**: 25-50% of those in solitary have diagnosed mental health conditions that isolation exacerbates
- **Youth**: Adolescent brains are particularly vulnerable to isolation damage
- **LGBTQ individuals**: Often placed in solitary "for their protection" against their will
- **Pregnant women**: Some states still isolate pregnant incarcerated women
- **Black and Hispanic individuals**: Overrepresented in solitary by 2-3x their prison population rates

### 3. Counterproductive to Safety
- Increases violence upon return to general population
- Higher recidivism rates upon release
- Staff injuries correlate with solitary use, not reduction
- Creates more dangerous individuals, not fewer

### 4. Fiscal Irresponsibility
- Costs 2-3x more than general population housing
- No evidence of improved outcomes justifying expense
- Liability exposure from lawsuits and settlements
- Long-term healthcare costs for trauma

### 5. Constitutional Concerns
- Eighth Amendment (cruel and unusual punishment)
- Fourteenth Amendment (due process, equal protection)
- First Amendment (religious practice, communication)
- Americans with Disabilities Act violations

## The Path Forward

Evidence from states that have significantly reduced solitary use demonstrates that reform is achievable without compromising safety:
- **Colorado**: Reduced solitary population by 85% with no increase in violence
- **North Dakota**: Partnered with Norway for humane alternatives
- **New York**: Ended solitary for youth and limited duration for all
- **California**: Settled Ashker v. Governor and reformed gang validation policies

Successful reform requires:
1. Durational limits (15 days maximum per UN standards)
2. Prohibition for vulnerable populations
3. Independent oversight and transparency
4. Step-down programs and alternatives
5. Due process protections
6. Mental health screening and treatment
7. Congressional and state legislative action
