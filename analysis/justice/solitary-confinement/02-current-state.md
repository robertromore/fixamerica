# Solitary Confinement Reform: Current State

## The Scale of Isolation in America

The United States holds more people in solitary confinement than any other democratic nation. On any given day, an estimated 80,000 to 100,000 incarcerated individuals are held in some form of restrictive housing across federal and state prisons, local jails, immigration detention facilities, and juvenile facilities.

### National Statistics

| Category | Estimate | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Total in restrictive housing (prisons) | 55,000-70,000 | State and federal combined |
| Total in jail isolation | 15,000-25,000 | Often undercounted |
| Immigration detention isolation | 2,000-5,000 | ICE facilities |
| Juvenile facilities | 1,000-2,000 | Despite prohibitions |
| **Total estimated** | **80,000-100,000** | Conservative estimate |

### Duration of Stays

| Length of Time | Percentage | Estimated Number |
|----------------|------------|------------------|
| Less than 15 days | 35% | 28,000 |
| 15-30 days | 15% | 12,000 |
| 1-3 months | 18% | 14,400 |
| 3-12 months | 15% | 12,000 |
| 1-3 years | 10% | 8,000 |
| 3-10 years | 5% | 4,000 |
| 10+ years | 2% | 1,600 |

*An estimated 6,000+ people have been held in solitary for 3 years or longer, with some individuals isolated for decades.*

## Conditions of Confinement

### Typical Solitary Cell
- **Size**: 6x9 feet to 8x10 feet (smaller than a parking space)
- **Furnishings**: Concrete bed, stainless steel toilet/sink, sometimes a desk
- **Window**: Often none; if present, may view interior corridor or small sky sliver
- **Lighting**: Fluorescent, often on 24 hours
- **Temperature**: Frequently extreme (too hot or too cold)

### Daily Routine

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 24 hours | In-cell (22-24 hours) |
| 1 hour or less | Out-of-cell recreation (alone, in cage) |
| 3x daily | Meals through slot in door |
| Limited | Shower (often 3x per week) |
| Restricted | Phone calls (if any) |
| Restricted | Visits (non-contact through glass) |
| None | Programming, education, work |

### Sensory Environment
- Constant noise from ventilation, doors, yelling
- No natural light in many facilities
- Limited or no access to reading material
- No television or radio in many units
- Minimal human interaction (brief exchanges with guards)
- Food passed through slot without seeing another person

## State-by-State Variations

### States with Reforms

| State | Key Reforms | Year | Impact |
|-------|-------------|------|--------|
| **Colorado** | 15-day limit, banned for mentally ill | 2017 | 85% reduction |
| **New York** | HALT Act - 15-day limit | 2021 | 90% reduction in long-term |
| **California** | Ashker settlement, gang validation reform | 2015 | 80% reduction in SHU |

| **Connecticut** | Comprehensive reform | 2021 | Significant reductions |
| **Virginia** | Step-down programming | 2012 | Red Onion reforms |
| **Maine** | Banned for youth, pregnant women | 2023 | Ongoing implementation |

### States with Minimal Regulation

| State | Notable Issues |
|-------|----------------|
| **Texas** | 4,000+ in solitary, minimal oversight |
| **Florida** | "Close management" obscures numbers |
| **Arizona** | Extensive use, harsh conditions |
| **Louisiana** | Angola's Camp J, long-term isolation |
| **Pennsylvania** | Ongoing litigation over conditions |
| **Georgia** | Limited transparency |

### State Comparison Matrix

| State | 15-Day Limit | Ban for Mental Illness | Ban for Youth | Independent Oversight | Transparency Reporting |
|-------|:------------:|:----------------------:|:-------------:|:---------------------:|:----------------------:|
| Colorado | Yes | Partial | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| New York | Yes | Yes | Yes | Partial | Yes |
| New Jersey | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| California | Partial | Partial | Yes | Partial | Yes |
| Connecticut | Yes | Partial | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Texas | No | No | Partial | No | Minimal |
| Florida | No | No | Partial | No | Minimal |
| Arizona | No | No | Partial | No | Minimal |

## Federal System

### Bureau of Prisons (BOP)

The federal prison system operates several high-security facilities with extensive solitary use:

| Facility | Location | Population in Restrictive Housing |
|----------|----------|----------------------------------|
| ADX Florence | Colorado | ~400 (entire facility is isolation) |
| USP Thomson | Illinois | 1,000+ capacity |
| Various USPs | Nationwide | Variable |

**Recent Developments**:
- 2023: DOJ Inspector General report on ADX conditions
- 2022: Federal legislation introduced (not passed)
- Ongoing: Litigation over conditions and due process

### Immigration Detention

ICE facilities regularly use solitary confinement:
- Often for "protective custody" of LGBTQ individuals
- Extended isolation during COVID-19
- Limited oversight and transparency
- No clear durational limits

## Reasons for Placement

| Category | Percentage | Common Justifications |
|----------|------------|----------------------|
| **Disciplinary** | 40% | Rule violations, fights, contraband |
| **Administrative** | 35% | Investigations, pending transfer, "management" |
| **Protective Custody** | 15% | At risk from other prisoners (or perceived to be) |
| **Gang Validation** | 10% | Alleged gang affiliation |

### Problematic Placement Practices

1. **Gang Validation**: Often based on:
   - Possession of certain books or artwork
   - Communication with validated individuals
   - Tattoos
   - Confidential informants (unreliable)
   - Racial profiling

2. **"Protective Custody" Against Will**:
   - LGBTQ individuals isolated for "protection"
   - Victims of assault isolated instead of perpetrators
   - Those who file grievances

3. **Minor Infractions**:
   - Possession of extra food
   - Talking back to officers
   - Having too many stamps
   - Refusing to cut hair

## Release Directly to Community

One of the most dangerous practices: releasing individuals directly from solitary confinement to the street.

| State | Practice | Reform Status |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| Many states | Direct release still occurs | No prohibition |
| Washington | Transition required | Data shows lower recidivism |
| Colorado | Step-down mandatory | Model policy |

**Impact of Direct Release**:
- No transition period to adjust to sensory input
- No reentry programming
- Higher rates of recidivism
- Higher rates of violent reoffending
- Mental health crises upon release
- Homelessness and unemployment

## Deaths and Suicides

### Suicide Rates

| Setting | Rate per 100,000 | Comparison |
|---------|------------------|------------|
| General U.S. population | 14 | Baseline |
| General prison population | 21 | 1.5x general |
| Solitary confinement | 124-200+ | 6-12x prison average |

### Notable Cases

- **Kalief Browder** (NY): Held at Rikers Island, significant time in solitary as a teenager for allegedly stealing a backpack. Charges dismissed. Died by suicide after release.
- **Albert Woodfox** (LA): Held in solitary for 43 years at Angola. Released 2016.
- **Thomas Silverstein** (Federal): Held in solitary for 36 years until death in 2019.
- **Herman Wallace** (LA): Released after 41 years in solitary, died 3 days later.

## Current Legal Landscape

### Active Litigation

| Case | Jurisdiction | Issue | Status |
|------|--------------|-------|--------|
| *Ashker v. Newsom* | California | SHU conditions, gang validation | Settlement implementation |
| *Peoples v. Annucci* | New York | SHU conditions | Ongoing |
| *Various* | Texas | TDCJ conditions | Multiple cases |
| *Immigration cases* | Federal | ICE solitary use | Ongoing |

### Key Legal Standards

- **Eighth Amendment**: Isolation can constitute cruel and unusual punishment
- **Due Process**: Placement requires meaningful review
- **ADA**: Isolation of mentally ill may violate disability rights
- **PREA**: Sexual assault survivors shouldn't be isolated
