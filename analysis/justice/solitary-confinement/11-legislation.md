## Part I: Federal Legislation

### The Solitary Confinement Reform Act

```
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Solitary Confinement Reform Act of [YEAR]."

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:

(a) An estimated 80,000 to 100,000 incarcerated individuals in the United States
are held in some form of solitary confinement on any given day.

(b) The United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners
(Nelson Mandela Rules) define solitary confinement as the confinement of
prisoners for 22 hours or more per day without meaningful human contact, and
prolonged solitary confinement as exceeding 15 consecutive days.

(c) The United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture has determined that
solitary confinement beyond 15 consecutive days constitutes torture or cruel,
inhuman, and degrading treatment or punishment.

(d) Extensive research demonstrates that solitary confinement causes severe and
lasting psychological harm, including anxiety, depression, hallucinations,
psychosis, and increased risk of suicide.

(e) Suicide rates in solitary confinement are 6 to 12 times higher than in the
general prison population.

(f) Individuals with mental illness are disproportionately placed in solitary
confinement, where their conditions deteriorate rather than improve.

(g) Solitary confinement is disproportionately used against Black, Hispanic,
and Indigenous incarcerated individuals.

(h) Solitary confinement costs two to three times more per incarcerated person
than housing in the general population.

(i) States that have reduced their use of solitary confinement have not
experienced increases in violence against staff or other incarcerated persons.

(j) Viable alternatives to solitary confinement exist and have been successfully
implemented in multiple jurisdictions.

```
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Humane Alternatives to Long-Term Solitary
Confinement Act" or the "HALT Solitary Act."

SECTION 2. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.

(a) FINDINGS.—The Legislature finds that:

    (1) Solitary confinement, defined as isolation in a cell for 22 hours or
        more per day without meaningful human contact, causes severe psychological
        harm including anxiety, depression, hallucinations, and increased risk
        of suicide.

    (2) The United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners
        (Nelson Mandela Rules) recognize that solitary confinement exceeding
        15 consecutive days constitutes torture or cruel, inhuman, and degrading
        treatment.

    (3) This state holds an estimated [NUMBER] individuals in some form of
        segregated housing on any given day, at a cost approximately [X] times
        that of general population housing.

    (4) Research demonstrates that reducing reliance on solitary confinement
        does not increase violence in correctional facilities.

    (5) Individuals released directly from solitary confinement to the community
        have significantly higher rates of recidivism.

    (6) Viable alternatives to solitary confinement exist and have been
        successfully implemented in other jurisdictions.

(b) PURPOSE.—The purpose of this Act is to:

    (1) Limit the use of solitary confinement to the minimum necessary;

    (2) Protect vulnerable populations from the harms of isolation;

    (3) Ensure due process protections for all placement decisions;

    (4) Require the development and use of alternatives;

    (5) Increase transparency and oversight; and

    (6) Ensure that individuals are not released directly from solitary
        confinement to the community.

## Part III: Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

Even well-intentioned legislation can be undermined through implementation, interpretation, or design flaws. This section identifies common loopholes in solitary confinement reform legislation and provides recommendations for closing them.

### Common Definitional Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | How It's Exploited | Rectification |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Narrow definition of solitary** | Defining solitary as only 24 hours/day in cell | Holding people for 22-23 hours escapes regulation | Define as 17+ or 20+ hours; use tiered definitions |
| **"Meaningful human contact" undefined** | Leaving term vague | Brief, perfunctory interactions counted | Define as 15+ minutes, face-to-face, barrier-free, unstructured |
| **Excluding certain facilities** | Limiting to state prisons only | Jails, private facilities, federal contracts excluded | Comprehensive facility coverage |
| **"Emergency" exceptions** | Broad emergency language | Routine situations labeled emergencies | Define emergencies narrowly with time limits |
| **Security level exemptions** | Exempting "high security" units | Designating all solitary as "high security" | No categorical exemptions |

### Duration and Timing Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | How It's Exploited | Rectification |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **"Consecutive days" only** | Limiting only consecutive days | Brief release resets clock; cycling in and out | Add cumulative limits (X days per 60/180 days) |
| **Clock reset manipulation** | Allowing any interruption to reset | 1-hour release, then return to isolation | Require 72+ hours to reset; specify true release |
| **No annual limits** | Limiting per-placement only | Multiple placements throughout year | Annual maximum (e.g., 60-90 days/year) |
| **Delayed hearing timeline** | "Within 72 hours" starts late | Clock starts after placement "processed" | Clock starts at moment of physical placement |
| **"Business days" language** | Hearings within X business days | Weekend placements drag on | Use calendar days, not business days |

### Vulnerable Population Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | How It's Exploited | Rectification |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Narrow mental illness definition** | Only "serious mental illness" | Many conditions excluded | Include all DSM diagnoses and indications |
| **Self-ID for LGBTQ excluded** | Requiring documentation | Those who don't disclose unprotected | Self-identification sufficient |
| **Age cutoffs** | Youth defined as under 18 only | 18-21 year olds fully exposed | Define youth as under 21 or 25 |
| **"For their protection" override** | Allowing isolation if "protective" | LGBTQ, victims isolated for "protection" | Prohibition regardless of justification |
| **Mental health "cleared" loophole** | Mental health can "clear" for placement | Pressure on mental health staff | Prohibition is absolute, not clearable |
| **Waiver provisions** | Individual can "waive" protection | Coerced or pressured waivers | No waiver allowed |

### Conditions Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | How It's Exploited | Rectification |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **"When possible" qualifiers** | Out-of-cell time "when possible" | Claimed staffing prevents compliance | Remove qualifiers; mandate conditions |
| **Indoor-only exercise** | "Exercise" in small indoor cage | Meets letter but not spirit | Require outdoor recreation, minimum space |
| **Phone calls "equivalent"** | Equivalent to restricted general population | General population restrictions justify limits | Specify minimum access regardless |
| **Programming "offered" not required** | Programs "available" but not required | Programming exists but inaccessible | Require actual participation/access |
| **Group confinement as alternative** | Two people in solitary cell | Doesn't address isolation harms | Require genuine congregation |

### Due Process Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | How It's Exploited | Rectification |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **"Impartial" hearing officer undefined** | Staff conducts hearings | Same staff involved in incident | Require external or truly independent officer |
| **Confidential informants allowed** | Evidence based on informants | Unable to challenge evidence | Require disclosure of evidence sources |
| **"Preponderance" standard too low** | Low evidentiary burden | Easy to justify continued placement | Require clear and convincing evidence |
| **Appeals to same authority** | Appeal to supervisor of hearing officer | Internal review unlikely to reverse | External independent review body |
| **Review hearings perfunctory** | 7-day reviews as rubber stamp | No genuine reconsideration | Require documented consideration of alternatives |

#### Model Language for Closing Loopholes

**For "meaningful human contact":**
> "Meaningful human contact" means an in-person interaction lasting at least 15 minutes, conducted face-to-face without physical barriers, enabling mutual and spontaneous verbal communication and physical contact, between the incarcerated individual and at least one other person who is not conducting a security or administrative function.

**For "consecutive days" protection:**
> Release from segregated confinement for fewer than 72 continuous hours shall not toll or reset the consecutive day count. No individual shall be placed in segregated confinement for more than 20 days in any 60-day period or more than 45 days in any 180-day period, regardless of whether such days are consecutive.

**For mental health protection:**
> No individual who has any current mental health diagnosis, any history of mental health treatment, any current prescription for psychotropic medication, any pending mental health referral, or any indication of mental health needs as determined by screening or staff observation shall be placed in segregated confinement. Mental health staff shall not have authority to "clear" any individual for placement in segregated confinement; the prohibition is absolute.

**For enforcement:**
> Any individual harmed by a violation of this Act may bring an action in [state] court or federal court for injunctive relief and damages, without regard to the exhaustion requirements of the Prison Litigation Reform Act or any state exhaustion requirement. The defense of qualified immunity shall not be available for claims arising under this Act. A prevailing plaintiff shall be entitled to reasonable attorney's fees and costs.
