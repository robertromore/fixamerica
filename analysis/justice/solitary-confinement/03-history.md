# Solitary Confinement Reform: History

## Origins: The Birth of the Penitentiary

The history of solitary confinement in America is inseparable from the history of the prison itself. What began as a Quaker reform effort to create humane alternatives to corporal punishment evolved into one of the most psychologically damaging practices in the criminal legal system.

## Timeline of Solitary Confinement in America

### Early Era (1790-1890)

| Year | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **1790** | Walnut Street Jail, Philadelphia | First use of solitary as reform tool |
| **1829** | Eastern State Penitentiary opens | Systematic solitary as primary model |
| **1831** | Tocqueville visits | Documents American prison experiment |
| **1842** | Dickens visits Eastern State | Writes scathing critique of isolation |
| **1890** | *In re Medley* Supreme Court | Court recognizes isolation's harms |
| **1890s** | Pennsylvania system abandoned | Solitary as primary model fails |

### The "Pennsylvania System" (1829-1890s)

Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia became the model for a radical experiment: complete isolation as the path to reform.

**Philosophy**:
- Quaker belief that isolation would lead to penitence (hence "penitentiary")
- Prisoners would reflect on their crimes
- No contact with corrupting influences
- Silent contemplation would reform the soul

**Conditions**:
- Individual cells with small exercise yards
- Hoods placed on prisoners when moved
- No communication with other prisoners
- Complete silence enforced
- Bible as only reading material
- Some handicraft work in cell

**Observers' Reactions**:

*Charles Dickens, 1842*:
> "I believe that very few men are capable of estimating the immense amount of torture and agony which this dreadful punishment, prolonged for years, inflicts upon the sufferers... I hold this slow and daily tampering with the mysteries of the brain, to be immeasurably worse than any torture of the body."

**Supreme Court Recognition (1890)**:

In *In re Medley*, the Court acknowledged:
> "A considerable number of the prisoners fell, after even a short confinement, into a semi-fatuous condition, from which it was next to impossible to arouse them, and others became violently insane; others still, committed suicide."

### Retreat and Return (1890-1970s)

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| 1890-1930 | Solitary largely abandoned as primary model |
| 1930-1960 | Limited use for discipline, short-term |
| 1960s-1970s | Prisoners' rights movement emerges |
| 1971 | Attica uprising brings conditions to light |

The mid-20th century saw prisons operating with limited solitary use, primarily as short-term disciplinary measure. Prisoners' rights litigation in the 1960s and 1970s began establishing constitutional limits on conditions.

### The Supermax Era (1983-Present)

| Year | Event | Significance |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **1983** | Marion "lockdown" | Birth of supermax concept |
| **1989** | Pelican Bay SHU opens | Purpose-built isolation facility |
| **1994** | ADX Florence opens | Federal supermax |
| **1990s** | Supermax construction boom | 40+ states build isolation units |
| **2000s** | Peak solitary populations | 80,000-100,000 in isolation |

### The Marion Lockdown (1983)

USP Marion in Illinois became the catalyst for the modern supermax after two correctional officers were killed on the same day in October 1983. The entire facility was placed on permanent lockdown—what had been a temporary emergency measure became the standard operating procedure.

**Key Features of Marion Model**:
- 23-hour cell confinement
- No congregate activities
- Recreation alone in cage
- Minimal human contact
- Control through isolation, not programming

### Pelican Bay: The Purpose-Built Supermax (1989)

California's Pelican Bay State Prison Security Housing Unit (SHU) was the first facility designed from the ground up for permanent isolation:

**Design Features**:
- Windowless cells (8x10 feet)
- No natural light
- Automated doors (no human contact for cell operations)
- Concrete exercise yards (no sky view in some)
- Built for 1,056 prisoners

**Population**:
- Primarily alleged gang members
- Indeterminate sentences in SHU
- Some held for decades
- Gang "debriefing" as only exit

### ADX Florence: The Federal Supermax (1994)

The "Alcatraz of the Rockies" became the most secure and isolated federal facility:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Location | Florence, Colorado |
| Capacity | 490 |
| Cell size | 7x12 feet |
| Out-of-cell time | 1 hour/day in concrete pit |
| Visits | Extremely limited, non-contact |
| Notable prisoners | Terrorists, spies, high-profile cases |

### The Supermax Building Boom (1990s)

| State | Facility | Year | Capacity |
|-------|----------|------|----------|
| California | Pelican Bay SHU | 1989 | 1,056 |
| Colorado | ADX Florence | 1994 | 490 |
| Virginia | Red Onion | 1998 | 498 |
| Virginia | Wallens Ridge | 1999 | 798 |
| Wisconsin | Supermax | 1999 | 500 |
| Ohio | OSP Youngstown | 1998 | 502 |
| Indiana | Westville | 1999 | 224 |
| Texas | Multiple units | 1990s | 8,000+ |

**Drivers of Expansion**:
- "Tough on crime" politics
- War on Drugs
- Three-strikes laws
- Overcrowding "solutions"
- Fear of prison gangs
- Corrections officer unions
- Private prison industry
- Rural economic development

## The Human Cost: Historical Harms

### Documented Abuses

| Era | Facility | Abuse |
|-----|----------|-------|
| 1990s | Pelican Bay | *Madrid v. Gomez* - conditions violate 8th Amendment |
| 2000s | California | Hunger strikes protesting indefinite isolation |
| Various | Multiple | Excessive force against restrained prisoners |
| Various | Multiple | Denial of mental health treatment |
| Various | Multiple | Deliberate sensory deprivation |

### The Angola Three

Louisiana State Penitentiary (Angola) held three Black Panther members in solitary for decades:

| Name | Years in Solitary | Status |
|------|-------------------|--------|
| Albert Woodfox | 43+ years | Released 2016, died 2022 |
| Herman Wallace | 41 years | Released 2013, died 3 days later |
| Robert King | 29 years | Released 2001 |

Their case became emblematic of the arbitrary, racialized, and indefinite nature of solitary confinement.

## Reform Movements

### Early Advocacy (2000s)

| Organization | Focus |
|--------------|-------|
| Solitary Watch | Public education, journalism |
| ACLU National Prison Project | Litigation |
| Human Rights Watch | Documentation |
| Vera Institute | Research and policy |

### Turning Points

| Year | Event | Impact |
|------|-------|--------|
| **2011** | UN Special Rapporteur report | International condemnation |
| **2012** | Center for Constitutional Rights lawsuit | Ashker v. Governor filed |
| **2013** | California hunger strikes | 30,000 prisoners participate |
| **2014** | Senate Judiciary hearing | First Congressional focus |
| **2015** | Obama Administration interest | DOJ review ordered |
| **2015** | Ashker settlement | California reforms begin |
| **2016** | DOJ report on solitary | Federal attention |
| **2016** | Ban on juvenile solitary in federal system | Obama executive action |
| **2019** | New Jersey ICRA | First comprehensive state law |
| **2021** | New York HALT Act | Major state reform |

### The Mandela Rules (2015)

The United Nations revised its Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, renaming them the "Nelson Mandela Rules" in honor of the leader who spent 18 years in prison:

**Key Provisions**:
- Solitary beyond 15 consecutive days is torture
- Prohibition for pregnant women, nursing mothers
- Prohibition for persons with mental or physical disabilities
- Prohibition for children (under 18)
- Requires mental health screening
- Requires meaningful human contact

## The Current Moment

The 2020s represent a critical juncture in solitary confinement reform:

**Progress**:
- Growing bipartisan recognition of harms
- Multiple state reforms enacted
- Federal attention increased
- Media coverage expanded
- Survivor advocacy strengthened

**Challenges**:
- COVID-19 led to expanded isolation
- "Law and order" backlash in some states
- Corrections industry resistance
- Incomplete implementation of reforms
- New facilities still being built

## Lessons from History

1. **Solitary was recognized as harmful from the beginning** - 19th century observers documented the damage
2. **Abandonment is possible** - The Pennsylvania system was discarded when evidence showed its failure
3. **Crisis drives expansion** - Violence incidents lead to reactionary lockdowns
4. **Economics fuel growth** - Supermax construction was driven by politics and profit, not evidence
5. **Litigation alone is insufficient** - Courts have limited ongoing isolation but not ended it
6. **Reform requires sustained advocacy** - Progress comes from multi-pronged efforts
