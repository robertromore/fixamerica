# Solitary Confinement Reform: Solutions

## Overview

Ending the overuse and abuse of solitary confinement requires a comprehensive approach that addresses immediate harms, creates viable alternatives, reforms institutional culture, and prevents future expansion. This document outlines evidence-based solutions at multiple levels.

## Core Reform Principles

### The Mandela Rules Standard

The United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners (Nelson Mandela Rules) provide the international framework:

| Rule | Standard |
|------|----------|
| Definition | 22+ hours/day isolation without meaningful human contact |
| Maximum duration | 15 consecutive days |
| Absolute prohibitions | Indefinite solitary, children, pregnant/nursing women, persons with disabilities |
| Review requirements | Independent and regular |
| Healthcare | Daily mental and physical health visits |

### Key Reform Elements

1. **Durational Limits**: Hard cap on consecutive days in isolation
2. **Population Exclusions**: Prohibition for vulnerable groups
3. **Due Process**: Fair hearings, appeal rights
4. **Transparency**: Public reporting and oversight
5. **Alternatives**: Robust programs for those who need separation
6. **Accountability**: Enforcement mechanisms

## Specific Reform Proposals

### 1. Durational Limits

| Level | Proposed Limit | Notes |
|-------|---------------|-------|
| Ideal (UN standard) | 15 days maximum | Consecutive days |
| Acceptable interim | 30 days maximum | With goal of 15 |
| Annual limits | 60-90 days/year | Prevents cycling |
| Emergency only | 72-hour initial max | Before hearing |

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Clock starts on placement, not hearing
- Consecutive day counting (no resets for brief interruptions)
- Annual cumulative tracking
- Automatic release at limit

### 2. Vulnerable Population Exclusions

| Population | Basis for Exclusion | Alternative Requirement |
|------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Youth (under 21) | Brain development, trauma | Age-appropriate programming |
| Pregnant women | Fetal health, medical risk | Pregnancy support units |
| Postpartum (first year) | Bonding, mental health | Parenting programs |
| Persons with mental illness | Exacerbation of symptoms | Mental health units |
| Persons with intellectual disabilities | Comprehension, vulnerability | Specialized care |
| LGBTQ individuals | Historical abuse via "protective" isolation | Affirming housing policies |
| Elderly (65+) | Health vulnerabilities | Appropriate medical care |
| Physical disabilities | Access issues, medical needs | ADA-compliant housing |

### 3. Due Process Protections

| Stage | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| **Initial Placement** | Within 24 hours of emergency placement |
| **Written Notice** | Clear statement of reasons, evidence |
| **Hearing** | Within 72 hours of placement |
| **Representation** | Right to assistance (legal if possible) |
| **Evidence Access** | Right to review evidence, call witnesses |
| **Decision Standard** | Preponderance of evidence minimum |
| **Written Decision** | Explaining reasons, evidence relied upon |
| **Appeal** | To independent reviewer |
| **Periodic Review** | Every 7 days for continued placement |

### 4. Transparency and Oversight

| Mechanism | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Public Reporting** | Quarterly data on placements, duration, demographics |
| **Independent Monitoring** | External access to facilities (ombudsman, inspectors) |
| **Incident Reporting** | Deaths, suicide attempts, self-harm, use of force |
| **Demographic Tracking** | Race, mental health status, age, gender, LGBTQ status |
| **Legislative Oversight** | Regular hearings, commissioner accountability |

### 5. Conditions Improvements

Even when short-term separation is necessary:

| Condition | Standard |
|-----------|----------|
| Cell size | Minimum 70 square feet |
| Natural light | Window to outdoors |
| Out-of-cell time | Minimum 4 hours daily |
| Human contact | Meaningful interaction, not just orders |
| Programming | Access to education, counseling, activities |
| Exercise | Outdoor recreation, not just concrete cage |
| Property | Books, writing materials, personal items |
| Communication | Regular phone calls, visits |
| Mental health | Daily check-ins, treatment access |

## Alternative Models

### 1. Step-Down Programs

Graduated transition from restrictive housing to general population:

| Phase | Duration | Conditions | Privileges |
|-------|----------|------------|------------|
| Phase 1 | 1-3 months | Limited movement, in-cell programs | Some recreation |
| Phase 2 | 2-4 months | Small group programming | More out-of-cell time |
| Phase 3 | 2-3 months | Increased group size | Work assignments |
| Phase 4 | 1-2 months | Near-general population | Full privileges pending |

**Key Elements**:
- Clear criteria for advancement
- Behavioral incentives (not just punishment avoidance)
- Programming throughout
- Mental health support
- Failure doesn't mean restart

**Example**: Virginia's Red Onion step-down program reduced its segregation population significantly while maintaining safety.

### 2. Secure Residential Treatment Units

For those with serious mental illness:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Staffing | Mental health professionals, not just security |
| Out-of-cell time | 10+ hours daily |
| Treatment focus | Therapy, medication management, skill-building |
| Environment | Less institutional, more therapeutic |
| Group programming | Structured activities with others |
| Individual treatment plans | Tailored to needs |

### 3. Behavior Intervention Units

For those with behavioral challenges (not mental illness):

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Time-limited | Maximum 30-day placements |
| Skill-focused | Anger management, conflict resolution |
| Incentive-based | Rewards for positive behavior |
| Out-of-cell time | Substantial daily |
| Transition planning | Begins on arrival |

### 4. Protective Custody Alternatives

For those who need separation from general population:

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Voluntary protective units | Separate housing with programming and privileges |
| Facility transfers | Move to safer environment |
| Population reclassification | General population at lower security facility |
| Special needs yards | California model for those with vulnerability |

**Key Principle**: Protection should not mean punishment. Those needing separation should have equal or better conditions than general population.

### 5. Conflict Resolution Approaches

| Approach | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Mediation | Third-party facilitated dispute resolution |
| Restorative justice | Victim-offender dialogue (where appropriate) |
| Unit-based management | Small, stable housing units with relationships |
| Officer training | De-escalation, crisis intervention |

## Systemic Changes

### 1. Classification Reform

| Change | Rationale |
|--------|-----------|
| Validated risk assessment | Replace subjective decisions |
| Regular reclassification | Respond to behavior change |
| Eliminate gang validation issues | Evidence-based, not guilt by association |
| Reduce overclassification | Many in high security could be lower |

### 2. Staff Training and Culture

| Training Area | Content |
|---------------|---------|
| De-escalation | Verbal crisis intervention |
| Trauma-informed care | Understanding behavior through trauma lens |
| Mental health awareness | Recognizing symptoms vs. defiance |
| Cultural competency | Reducing racial bias |
| Positive behavior supports | Incentives over punishment |

### 3. Facility Design

| Feature | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Smaller units | Relationship-based management |
| Natural light | Health and wellbeing |
| Outdoor spaces | Real recreation options |
| Program space | Education, counseling, activities |
| Reduced isolation potential | Harder to use solitary |

### 4. Reentry from Solitary

| Requirement | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| No direct release to community | Transition time required |
| Step-down in prison | Before any release |
| Community preparation | Housing, services arranged |
| Mental health transition | Continued care |
| Family reconnection | Supported contact |

## Evidence of Success

|--------|---------------|--------------|

| Violence | Baseline | No increase |
| Staff safety | Baseline | Maintained |
| Costs | Higher | Reduced |

**Key Actions**:
