# Solitary Confinement Reform: Overview

Solitary confinement—the practice of isolating incarcerated individuals in cells for 22-24 hours per day with minimal human contact—represents one of the most severe and psychologically damaging practices in the American correctional system. Despite overwhelming evidence of its harm and limited effectiveness, the United States continues to hold an estimated 80,000-100,000 people in some form of restrictive housing on any given day, making it one of the most prolific users of isolation in the world.
