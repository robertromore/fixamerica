# Criminal Justice Reform: Overview

## Executive Summary

The American criminal justice system is in crisis. The United States incarcerates more people than any other nation—both in absolute numbers and per capita. Racial disparities permeate every stage of the system, from policing to prosecution to sentencing. Prisons fail to rehabilitate, and those released face barriers that virtually guarantee recidivism. Meanwhile, victims often find the system re-traumatizing rather than healing, and communities most affected by crime are also most harmed by aggressive enforcement.

This is not simply a matter of individual bad actors or isolated problems. The system is working as designed—a design rooted in the politics of the 1970s-1990s that prioritized punishment over public safety, incapacitation over rehabilitation, and tough-on-crime rhetoric over evidence-based policy. Fixing it requires structural reform at every level: how we police, prosecute, sentence, incarcerate, and reintegrate.

## Scope

### What This Topic Covers

- **Policing**: Use of force, accountability, qualified immunity, surveillance technology
- **Courts**: Public defense, bail, plea bargaining, judicial selection, fines and fees
- **Prosecution**: Prosecutorial discretion, charging decisions, accountability
- **Sentencing**: Mandatory minimums, guidelines, disparities, alternatives
- **Incarceration**: Prison conditions, private prisons, solitary confinement, prison labor
- **Supervision**: Parole, probation, revocations, technical violations
- **Reentry**: Employment, housing, voting rights, collateral consequences
- **Juvenile Justice**: Youth incarceration, school-to-prison pipeline, transfer
- **Wrongful Convictions**: Innocence, exonerations, forensic reform, compensation
- **Victims**: Services, rights, compensation, restorative justice
- **Death Penalty**: Capital punishment reform and abolition
- **Civil Rights**: Section 1983, qualified immunity, consent decrees
- **Special Issues**: Asset forfeiture, mental health crisis response, immigration detention

### What This Topic Does Not Cover

- Immigration policy broadly (see [Immigration](../immigration/01-overview.md))—though immigration detention is covered here
- National security and terrorism (see [Defense](../defense/01-overview.md))
- Drug policy specifically (see [Drugs](../drugs/01-overview.md), though intersection addressed)
- Civil litigation system (separate from criminal justice)

## Key Questions

1. **Why does the U.S. incarcerate so many people?** What policies, incentives, and choices led to mass incarceration?

2. **Why do racial disparities persist?** What structural factors create and maintain disparities at every stage?

3. **Does incarceration make us safer?** What does evidence show about deterrence, incapacitation, and rehabilitation?

4. **What reforms actually work?** What interventions have proven effective at reducing crime and recidivism?

5. **How can reform overcome political obstacles?** What strategies can succeed against tough-on-crime politics?

## Why This Matters

**Human Cost**: 2 million people incarcerated; 5 million under supervision; tens of millions with criminal records.

**Racial Justice**: Black Americans incarcerated at 5x the rate of whites; Latinos at 1.3x.

**Economic Burden**: $80+ billion annual cost of incarceration; trillions in lifetime earnings lost.

**Family Destruction**: 2.7 million children have an incarcerated parent.

**Community Impact**: Concentrated incarceration destabilizes neighborhoods most in need of stability.

**Public Safety**: High recidivism (44% rearrested within first year) shows system fails its stated purpose.

**Democratic Legitimacy**: A system this unjust undermines faith in law and government.

## The Opportunity

Despite the challenges, momentum for reform is building:

- **Bipartisan Support**: First Step Act (2018) passed with rare bipartisan coalition
- **State Leadership**: States across political spectrum reducing incarceration
- **Prosecutor Movement**: Reform prosecutors winning elections in major cities
- **Public Opinion**: Majorities support rehabilitation over punishment
- **Cost Pressures**: Fiscal conservatives recognize incarceration costs
- **Evidence Base**: Growing research on what works
