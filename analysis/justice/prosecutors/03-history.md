# Prosecutorial Reform: History

## Origins of American Prosecution

### Colonial Period (1600s-1776)

**English Roots**:

| System | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Private prosecution | Victims hired attorneys to prosecute |
| Attorney General | Crown's lawyer, limited criminal role |
| Grand juries | Community screening of charges |
| No public prosecutors | Government rarely prosecuted |

**Colonial Adaptation**:

- Colonies adopted private prosecution initially
- Attorney General positions created but focused on civil matters
- Local officials began handling criminal matters
- Transition to public prosecution gradual

### Early Republic (1776-1850)

**Development of Public Prosecution**:

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| 1790s | First local prosecutors appointed |
| 1800-1820 | States create county prosecutor offices |
| 1820-1850 | Elected prosecutors become standard |

**Key Characteristics**:

- Local control emphasized
- Part-time positions common
- Private practice alongside public duties
- Limited resources and scope
- Grand jury remained important check

### Unique American Model

**Comparison to Other Countries**:

|--------|--------|
| Full-time prosecutors | Increased capacity |

## Key Historical Lessons

### Path Dependency

- Elected prosecutors are unique American feature
- Plea bargaining developed from necessity, not design
- Power accumulated through legal decisions, not statute
- Immunity created by courts, not legislature

### Reform Patterns

| Reform Type | Historical Success |
|-------------|-------------------|
| Electoral | Possible but vulnerable to backlash |
| Legislative | Possible but requires political will |
| Judicial | Limited; courts expand prosecutorial power |
| Administrative | Depends on leadership |

### Resistance to Accountability

- Every effort to create accountability resisted
- Absolute immunity remains unchallenged
- Bar discipline remains minimal
- Self-regulation preferred to external oversight
