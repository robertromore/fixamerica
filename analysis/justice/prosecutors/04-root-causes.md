# Prosecutorial Reform: Root Causes

## Structural Factors

### Unchecked Discretion

**The Discretion Problem**:

| Aspect | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| No charging standards | Each prosecutor decides independently |
| No review of decisions | Declinations invisible |
| No data requirements | Disparities hidden |
| No oversight body | Self-regulation only |

**Why Discretion Is Unchecked**:

- Separation of powers concerns limit judicial review
- Executive branch sees no benefit in limiting
- Legislative efforts rare and opposed
- No constitutional constraint on charging

### Absolute Immunity

**Origin**: *Imbler v. Pachtman* (1976) created absolute immunity for prosecutorial functions

**Scope**:

| Protected Activity | Reasoning |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Charging decisions | Core function |
| Evidence presentation | Trial advocacy |
| Brady decisions | Evidence handling |
| Plea negotiations | Case resolution |
| Sentencing advocacy | Judicial proceedings |

**Effects**:

| Effect | Consequence |
|--------|-------------|
| No civil liability | No deterrence |
| No compensation | Victims have no remedy |
| No discovery | Can't investigate misconduct |
| Self-perpetuating | Courts rarely reconsider |

### Institutional Design

**Local Election System**:

| Feature | Problem |
|---------|---------|
| County-based | No statewide standards |
| Partisan elections | Political incentives |
| Low-information races | Name recognition wins |
| No term limits (mostly) | Incumbency advantage |

**Office Structure**:

| Problem | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| DA sets all policy | Culture depends on one person |
| Line prosecutors follow culture | Misconduct normalized |
| No external oversight | Self-investigation |
| Budget pressure | Plea mills, not trials |

### Plea Bargaining Dominance

**Why Plea System Favors Prosecutors**:

| Factor | Prosecutor Advantage |
|--------|---------------------|
| Overcharging | Creates leverage |
| Trial penalty | Threat of long sentence |
| Pretrial detention | Defendant wants release |
| Limited discovery | Defense can't evaluate case |
| Resource disparity | Can't afford trial |
| Caseload pressure | Defense must move cases |

## Cultural Factors

### Conviction-Focused Culture

**Institutional Values**:

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Win at all costs | Truth becomes secondary |
| Conviction rates | Metric for success |
| Career advancement | Based on big convictions |
| Tough reputation | Political advantage |

**Problematic Incentives**:

| Incentive | Behavior Encouraged |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Media coverage | Pursue high-profile cases |
| Political ambition | Tough-on-crime record |
| Peer respect | Aggressive tactics |
| Defense attorney scorn | Adversarial excess |

### Adversarial Excess

**System Design Problems**:

| Feature | Distortion |
|---------|------------|
| Adversarial model | Win matters more than truth |
| Prosecutor as advocate | Not neutral minister of justice |
| Scoring convictions | Dehumanizes defendants |
| Distance from consequences | Don't see prison reality |

### Tunnel Vision

**Cognitive Biases**:

| Bias | Manifestation |
|------|---------------|
| Confirmation bias | See evidence supporting guilt |
| Belief perseverance | Ignore exculpatory evidence |
| Cognitive dissonance | Rationalize misconduct |
| Dehumanization | See defendants as "criminals" |

**Organizational Factors**:

- Police and prosecutors share assumptions
- Team mentality with law enforcement
- Defense attorneys as "the enemy"
- Victims reinforce conviction focus

### Resistance to Correction

**Why Prosecutors Fight Exonerations**:

| Reason | Manifestation |
|--------|---------------|
| Personal stake | Original prosecutors fight |
| Office reputation | Admission of error |
| Career implications | Blamed for misconduct |
| Cognitive dissonance | Can't believe they were wrong |
| Victim relationships | Maintain conviction for victim |

## Legal Factors

### Weak Brady Enforcement

**Problems with Brady Doctrine**:

| Issue | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Materiality requirement | Must show violation affected outcome |
| Retroactive assessment | Prosecutor decides at time |
| No prophylactic rules | Each case individual |
| Harmless error | Courts forgive violations |
| Discovery in hands of accused | Defense must prove non-disclosure |

**Why Violations Continue**:

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| No penalty | Violations cost nothing |
| Hard to detect | Defense doesn't know what's hidden |
| Judicial reluctance | Courts don't want to overturn |
| Collegial protection | Other prosecutors don't report |

### Inadequate Remedies

**Available Remedies**:

| Remedy | Availability | Effectiveness |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| New trial | Rare | Sometimes |
| Dismissal | Very rare | When granted |
| Bar discipline | Almost never | Minimal |
| Criminal prosecution | Never | Non-existent |
| Civil liability | Blocked by immunity | Zero |

### Appellate Deference

**Standard of Review**:

| Issue | Standard |
|-------|----------|
| Charging decisions | Unreviewable |
| Plea process | Highly deferential |
| Brady materiality | Reasonable doubt affected |
| Misconduct | Harmless error applied |
| Selective prosecution | Nearly impossible to prove |

## Political Factors

### Electoral Incentives

**Political Dynamics**:

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Low-turnout elections | Passionate minorities dominate |
| Tough-on-crime easy sell | "Soft on crime" attack effective |
| Victim groups vocal | Demand harsh prosecution |
| Defense has no constituency | No political counterweight |

**Career Paths**:

| Pattern | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| DA to higher office | Build tough reputation |
| DA to judge | Maintain relationships |
| DA as career | Please constituencies |

### Lack of Organized Opposition

**Interest Group Landscape**:

| Stakeholder | Political Power |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Police unions | Strong |
| Prosecutors' associations | Strong |
| Victim advocacy | Moderate |
| Defense bar | Weak |
| Civil liberties groups | Moderate |
| Affected communities | Weak |

### Partisan Polarization

**Political Framing**:

| Issue | Conservative Frame | Progressive Frame |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Mass incarceration | Necessary for safety | Unjust system |
| Reform prosecutors | Soft on crime | Justice reform |
| Misconduct | Rare bad apples | Systemic problem |
| Racial disparities | Reflects crime rates | Reflects bias |

## Resource Factors

### Prosecution-Defense Imbalance

**Resource Comparison**:

| Resource | Prosecution | Defense |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Staff per case | Multiple attorneys | One (overloaded) |
| Investigators | Police department | Often none |
| Expert witnesses | Budget available | Must beg for funds |
| Lab access | State labs | Pay privately |
| Time per case | Adequate | Minutes |

**Effects**:

- Defense cannot investigate
- Defense cannot challenge forensics
- Defense cannot find witnesses
- Plea becomes only option

### Information Asymmetry

**What Prosecutors Control**:

| Information | Prosecutor Access | Defense Access |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| Police reports | Full | Limited/late |
| Witness statements | Full | Partial |
| Evidence | Physical control | Must request |
| Criminal history | Database access | Limited |
| Informant deals | Controls | May never learn |

### Perverse Funding Incentives

**Funding Sources**:

| Source | Incentive Created |
|--------|------------------|
| Asset forfeiture | Pursue lucrative cases |
| Federal grants | Follow federal priorities |
| Local politics | Please constituencies |
| Conviction metrics | Prioritize easy wins |

## Feedback Loops

### Self-Reinforcing Dynamics

**Power Accumulation**:

```
More power → Less oversight → More impunity → More power
```

**Culture Perpetuation**:

```
Conviction culture → Hire like-minded → Socialize new prosecutors → Culture reinforced
```

### Resistance to Change

**Change Blocked By**:

| Actor | Mechanism |
|-------|-----------|
| Incumbent DAs | Oppose reforms limiting power |
| Prosecutors' associations | Lobby against accountability |
| Police unions | Support prosecutorial allies |
| Tough-on-crime politicians | Campaign on opposition |
| Judicial reluctance | Defer to prosecutorial discretion |

## Key Root Cause Summary

| Category | Primary Cause | Mechanism |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| Structural | Absolute immunity | No consequences for misconduct |
| Structural | Unchecked discretion | No oversight of decisions |
| Cultural | Conviction focus | Wrong metric of success |
| Legal | Weak Brady | Violations unpunished |
| Political | Electoral incentives | Tough on crime wins |
| Resource | Imbalance | Defense cannot compete |
