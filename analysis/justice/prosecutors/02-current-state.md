# Prosecutorial Reform: Current State

## Prosecutorial Discretion

### Scope of Discretion

Prosecutors exercise virtually unlimited discretion at every stage of a criminal case:

| Decision Point | Discretion Level | Oversight |
|----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Investigate or decline | Total | None |
| File charges or decline | Total | None |
| Select specific charges | Total | None |
| Dismiss charges | Total | None |
| Offer plea bargain | Total | Minimal judicial |
| Recommend sentence | High | Judge can deviate |
| Seek enhancements | Total | None |
| Disclose evidence | Required by law | Rarely enforced |
| Post-conviction review | Total | None |

### Standards for Charging

**Legal Standard**: Prosecutors should charge only when they believe there is sufficient evidence to support conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Reality**: Charging decisions are influenced by:

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Evidentiary strength | Should be primary; often isn't |
| Political considerations | Varies by case visibility |
| Resource constraints | Affects prioritization |
| Office policy | Varies dramatically |
| Personal discretion | Enormous latitude |
| Victim preferences | Sometimes considered |
| Defense counsel quality | Shouldn't matter; does |

### Charging Disparities

**Racial Disparities**:

| Metric | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| Federal firearms | Black defendants 65% more likely to face mandatory minimum |
| Drug offenses | Black defendants charged with higher quantities |
| Juvenile charging | Black youth more likely charged as adults |
| Charge severity | Black defendants face more serious charges for similar conduct |

**Economic Disparities**:

- Defendants with private counsel receive better plea offers
- Inability to make bail leads to worse outcomes
- Charges often based on ability to "fight" case

## Charging Practices

### Overcharging

**Types of Overcharging**:

| Type | Description | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| Vertical | Charging more serious offense than facts support | Pressure for plea |
| Horizontal | Charging multiple offenses for single act | Increase exposure |
| Charge stacking | Adding every possible charge | Maximize leverage |
| Enhancement loading | Adding sentencing enhancements | Increase penalty |

**Examples**:

- Single drug sale: Charged as distribution, conspiracy, money laundering
- Fight: Charged as assault, battery, disorderly conduct, resisting arrest
- Theft: Charged as burglary, larceny, criminal mischief

### Mandatory Minimum Triggers

Prosecutors control whether mandatory minimums apply:

| Trigger | Prosecutor Decision |
|---------|-------------------|
| Drug quantity charged | Determines minimum |
| "Serious drug felony" prior | Whether to file |
| Firearms enhancement | Whether to charge |
| Career criminal status | Whether to invoke |

**Data**: Federal prosecutors' charging decisions account for 73% of the variance in whether defendants receive mandatory minimums.

### Declining to Charge

**Declination Rates**:

| Jurisdiction | Declination Rate |
|--------------|------------------|
| Federal (overall) | ~20% |
| State (varies) | 10-40% |
| Reform prosecutors | Often higher for low-level offenses |

**Reasons for Declination**:

- Insufficient evidence (primary legitimate reason)
- Resource prioritization
- Diversion eligibility
- Interests of justice (rarely invoked)

## Plea Bargaining

### Prevalence

| Level | Plea Rate |
|-------|-----------|
| Federal | 97-98% |
| State felony | 94-97% |
| State misdemeanor | 95%+ |

### Prosecutorial Power in Pleas

**Leverage Points**:

| Leverage | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Charging decisions | Set maximum exposure |
| Pretrial detention | Detained defendants plead faster |
| Trial penalty | Threat of much longer sentence |
| Mandatory minimums | Remove judicial discretion |
| Discovery control | Defense doesn't know evidence |
| Time pressure | Speedy trial deadlines |

### Trial Penalty

**Average Penalty by Offense**:

| Offense Type | Plea Sentence | Post-Trial Sentence | Penalty |
|--------------|---------------|---------------------|---------|
| Federal drug | 5.4 years | 16 years | 3x |
| Federal fraud | 1.5 years | 5 years | 3.3x |
| State violent | 3-5 years | 10-15 years | 2-3x |
| State drug | 1-2 years | 4-6 years | 2-3x |

**NACDL Study Findings**:

- Trial penalty increased 5x since 1980
- Creates overwhelming pressure to plead
- Innocent defendants plead guilty to avoid risk

### Plea Bargaining Problems

**Due Process Concerns**:

| Issue | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Coercion | Pressure overwhelming rational choice |
| Ignorance | Limited discovery before plea |
| Waiver overload | Rights waived without understanding |
| Innocence | Innocent people plead guilty |
| Disparity | Similarly situated defendants get different deals |

**Innocence in Pleas**:

- Estimated 2-8% of guilty pleas involve innocent defendants
- National Registry of Exonerations: 18% of exonerees pleaded guilty
- Pressures: pretrial detention, trial penalty, weak defense

## Brady Violations

### The Brady Obligation

**Brady v. Maryland** (1963): Prosecutors must disclose evidence favorable to the accused that is material to guilt or punishment.

**What Must Be Disclosed**:

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| Exculpatory evidence | Evidence of innocence |
| Impeachment evidence | Witness credibility issues |
| Prior inconsistent statements | Witness changing story |
| Deals with witnesses | Incentives to testify |
| Police misconduct | Officer credibility |
| Lab errors | Forensic problems |

### Violations

**Prevalence**:

| Study | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| Innocence Project | Brady violations in 44% of DNA exonerations |
| National Registry | Misconduct in 54% of exonerations |
| Ninth Circuit review | Brady violations in 50%+ of capital reversals |

**Types of Brady Violations**:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Non-disclosure | Withholding favorable evidence |
| Late disclosure | Disclosing after plea/trial |
| Incomplete disclosure | Partial or misleading disclosure |
| Destruction | Destroying favorable evidence |

### Consequences for Violations

**For Defendants**:

| Outcome | Likelihood |
|---------|------------|
| Conviction reversed | Rare (materiality barrier) |
| New trial | Occasional |
| No remedy | Most common |

**For Prosecutors**:

| Consequence | Frequency |
|-------------|-----------|
| Criminal prosecution | Almost never |
| Bar discipline | Extremely rare |
| Civil liability | Absolute immunity |
| Employment consequences | Rare |
| Public naming | Inconsistent |

**Data**: Of 660 cases from 2004-2008 where courts found prosecutorial error, only one prosecutor was disciplined.

## Prosecutorial Misconduct

### Types of Misconduct

| Type | Description | Prevalence |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Brady violations | Withholding evidence | Very common |
| False evidence | Using perjured testimony | Significant |
| Improper argument | Inflammatory closing | Common |
| Witness tampering | Coaching, threats | Occurs |
| Fabricating evidence | Creating false evidence | Rare but devastating |
| Selective prosecution | Discriminatory enforcement | Difficult to prove |

### Prevalence

**Documented Cases**:

|--------|---------|
| Center for Prosecutor Integrity | 3,625 cases of misconduct 1963-2013 |
| California Innocence Project | 707 cases in California 1997-2009 |
| Innocence Project | 43% of exonerations involve misconduct |
| Northern California Innocence Project | 130+ cases in California alone |

### Impunity

**Why Misconduct Goes Unpunished**:

| Factor | Explanation |
|--------|-------------|
| Absolute immunity | Cannot sue prosecutors |
| Collegial protection | DAs don't discipline each other |
| Bar passivity | State bars rarely act |
| Judicial reluctance | Judges avoid naming prosecutors |
| Harmless error | Courts excuse "harmless" violations |
| Discovery barriers | Hard to prove what was hidden |

**Accountability Statistics**:

| Metric | Data |
|--------|------|
| Misconduct cases documented | Thousands |
| Prosecutors disbarred | <10 nationally (historical) |
| Prosecutors criminally charged | Handful ever |
| Prosecutors fired | Rare |
| Prosecutors publicly named | ~20% of cases |
