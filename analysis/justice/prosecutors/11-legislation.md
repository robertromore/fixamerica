# Prosecutorial Reform: Legislation and Legal Framework

## Overview

Prosecutorial reform legislation operates at federal, state, and local levels. Federal legislation can establish minimum standards through funding conditions, mandate data collection, and reform federal prosecution practices. State legislation is critical for discovery reform, Brady enforcement, conviction integrity requirements, and oversight mechanisms. Local policy can be transformed through elected reform prosecutors, though sustainability requires legislative codification.

## Federal Legislation

### Prosecutorial Accountability Act

**Purpose**: Mandate transparency, strengthen Brady enforcement, and create federal standards for prosecutorial conduct.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Prosecutorial Accountability Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that:
(1) Prosecutorial misconduct, including Brady violations,
contributes to approximately 30 percent of wrongful convictions.
(2) Prosecutors rarely face meaningful consequences for
misconduct, with fewer than 2 percent of documented cases
resulting in discipline.
(3) The lack of data on prosecutorial decisions prevents
identification of disparities and misconduct patterns.
(4) Absolute immunity prevents civil accountability for
even intentional misconduct.
(5) Reform is necessary to ensure justice and public
confidence in the criminal justice system.

SEC. 3. FEDERAL PROSECUTION DATA COLLECTION.

(a) REQUIREMENT.—The Attorney General shall collect and
publish annually data on federal prosecutions including:
(1) Cases received, charged, declined, and dismissed;
(2) Charges filed and final disposition by charge;
(3) Demographic data on defendants and victims;
(4) Plea offers made and accepted;
(5) Trial outcomes and sentences;
(6) Mandatory minimum applications; and
(7) Brady disclosures and violations found.

(b) DISAGGREGATION.—Data shall be disaggregated by district,
offense type, and defendant demographics.

(c) PUBLIC ACCESS.—Data shall be published in machine-readable
format within 180 days of each calendar year's end.

SEC. 4. FEDERAL OPEN-FILE DISCOVERY.

(a) DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT.—In any federal criminal case,
the prosecution shall disclose to the defendant:
(1) All evidence and information known to the prosecution,
whether or not intended for use at trial;
(2) All statements of any witness;
(3) All police reports and investigative materials;
(4) All forensic evidence and expert reports;
(5) All agreements or understandings with witnesses;
(6) All evidence favorable to the defendant; and
(7) All prior misconduct by witnesses.

(b) TIMING.—Initial disclosure shall occur within 14 days
of the defendant's initial appearance. Disclosure shall be
ongoing as additional evidence is obtained.

(c) CERTIFICATION.—Prosecutors shall certify compliance with
disclosure obligations before any guilty plea or trial.

(d) REMEDIES.—Failure to comply with disclosure requirements
shall result in:
(1) Exclusion of undisclosed evidence;
(2) Dismissal of charges if prejudice shown;
(3) New trial if violation discovered post-conviction; and
(4) Mandatory referral to Office of Professional
Responsibility for discipline.

SEC. 5. BRADY ENFORCEMENT.

(a) PRESUMPTION OF MATERIALITY.—Any evidence favorable to
the defendant shall be presumed material unless the court
finds beyond a reasonable doubt that non-disclosure did not
contribute to the outcome.

(b) MANDATORY SANCTIONS.—Upon finding a Brady violation:
(1) For first violation: Written reprimand entered in
personnel file, mandatory retraining;
(2) For second violation: Suspension from practice for
not less than 30 days;
(3) For third violation: Termination and bar referral;
(4) For intentional violations: Immediate termination
and criminal referral.

(c) SUPERVISORY LIABILITY.—Supervisors who fail to ensure
compliance shall be subject to sanctions.

SEC. 6. CONVICTION INTEGRITY UNITS.

(a) REQUIREMENT.—Each United States Attorney's Office shall
establish a Conviction Integrity Unit.

(b) FUNCTIONS.—Each Unit shall:
(1) Review credible claims of actual innocence;
(2) Review cases involving allegations of prosecutorial
misconduct;
(3) Preserve evidence for post-conviction review;
(4) Recommend vacatur of wrongful convictions;
(5) Report annually on cases reviewed and outcomes.

(c) INDEPENDENCE.—Units shall be separate from trial divisions
and report directly to the United States Attorney.

SEC. 7. FUNDING CONDITIONS FOR STATE COMPLIANCE.

(a) STATE DATA REQUIREMENTS.—Beginning 3 years after
enactment, no state shall receive funds under the Byrne
Justice Assistance Grant Program unless the state:
(1) Collects and publishes prosecution data comparable
to section 3;
(2) Has adopted open-file discovery requirements; and
(3) Has established conviction integrity processes.

(b) CERTIFICATION.—States shall certify compliance annually.

(c) WAIVER.—The Attorney General may waive requirements for
good cause, not to exceed 2 years.

SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect 180 days after enactment.
```

**Explanation**:

- Section 3 creates mandatory data collection for federal prosecutions
- Section 4 establishes true open-file discovery
- Section 5 strengthens Brady enforcement with automatic sanctions
- Section 6 requires federal CIUs
- Section 7 uses funding conditions to encourage state compliance

**Potential Challenges**:

- DOJ resistance to data transparency
- Prosecutor opposition to open-file discovery
- Enforcement of state conditions
- Constitutional limits on federal conditions

**Refinements**:

- Phase-in period for smaller offices
- Technical assistance funding for states
- Exemptions for genuine witness safety concerns (narrowly defined)

### Ending Prosecutorial Immunity Act

**Purpose**: Eliminate absolute immunity for prosecutors who violate constitutional rights.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Ending Prosecutorial
Immunity Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that:
(1) Absolute prosecutorial immunity is a judicially created
doctrine not required by the Constitution or any statute.
(2) Absolute immunity prevents victims of prosecutorial
misconduct from obtaining any remedy.
(3) Other actors in the criminal justice system, including
police, face potential civil liability for misconduct.
(4) The threat of personal liability creates appropriate
incentives for constitutional compliance.
(5) Insurance and indemnification can protect against
frivolous suits while preserving accountability.

SEC. 3. QUALIFIED IMMUNITY FOR PROSECUTORS.

Section 1979 of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. § 1983) is
amended by adding at the end the following:

"(c) PROSECUTORIAL IMMUNITY.—
(1) IN GENERAL.—A person acting as a prosecutor under
color of state law who deprives any person of rights
secured by the Constitution or laws shall be subject
to the same defenses as any other person acting under
color of law.
(2) NO ABSOLUTE IMMUNITY.—Absolute immunity shall not
be available as a defense to any action under this
section against a prosecutor.
(3) QUALIFIED IMMUNITY AVAILABLE.—A prosecutor may
assert qualified immunity, provided that qualified
immunity shall not apply to:
(A) intentional suppression of exculpatory evidence;
(B) knowing use of false evidence or testimony;
(C) intentional destruction of evidence; or
(D) conduct determined by a court to violate
clearly established rights.
(4) ENTITY LIABILITY.—A governmental entity employing
a prosecutor shall be liable for actions of that
prosecutor taken under color of law.
(5) INDIVIDUAL LIABILITY CAP.—Individual prosecutor
liability shall not exceed $50,000 per incident;
entity liability shall be unlimited.
(6) INSURANCE REQUIREMENT.—Entities may require
prosecutors to maintain professional liability
insurance."

SEC. 4. APPLICABILITY.

This Act shall apply to conduct occurring on or after the
date of enactment.
```

**Explanation**:

- Replaces absolute immunity with qualified immunity
- Removes qualified immunity for intentional misconduct
- Creates entity liability for prosecutorial misconduct
- Caps individual liability while permitting full entity liability

**Potential Challenges**:

- Strong opposition from prosecutors' associations
- Concerns about chilling legitimate prosecution
- Constitutional questions about retroactivity
- Political difficulty

**Refinements**:

- Insurance mandate to spread risk
- Good faith exception narrowly defined
- Training safe harbor for new attorneys
- Frivolous suit screening

```

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Authority

**Federal Authority**:

| Basis | Application |
|-------|-------------|
| Spending Clause | Funding conditions on state compliance |
| Commerce Clause | Limited application |
| Supremacy Clause | Federal discovery rules for federal cases |
| 14th Amendment | Due process enforcement |

**Immunity Reform**:

- Absolute immunity is judicially created, not constitutional
- Congress may define § 1983 immunity
- States may modify immunity for state law claims
- Careful drafting required for retroactivity

### Preemption Issues

**Federal-State**:

| Issue | Analysis |
|-------|----------|
| Discovery rules | States may exceed federal |
| Immunity | Federal § 1983; states control state claims |
| Data collection | Federal floor, states may exceed |
| CIUs | Federal can mandate for federal funding |

**State-Local**:

| Issue | Consideration |
|-------|---------------|
| Local DA policies | Some states preempt local discretion |
| Oversight boards | May need state enabling legislation |
| Discovery rules | State rules bind local prosecutors |

### Enforcement Mechanisms

**Federal**:

| Mechanism | Authority |
|-----------|-----------|
| Funding conditions | Spending Clause |
| DOJ guidance | Internal policy |
| Civil rights enforcement | 42 U.S.C. § 14141 |

**State**:

| Mechanism | Authority |
|-----------|-----------|
| Statutory mandates | Legislative |
| Commission oversight | Enabling legislation |
| Bar discipline | State bar authority |
| Judicial enforcement | Discovery, evidence rules |

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Prosecutorial Accountability Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Data gaming | Offices manipulate categories to hide patterns | High |
| Funding decline | States forgo federal funds to avoid requirements | Moderate |
| Delayed implementation | Extensions and waivers exploited | Moderate |
| CIU capture | Units staffed by allies of trial prosecutors | High |
| Weak enforcement | Bar fails to act on referrals | High |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Federal only | Doesn't directly bind state prosecutors | Constitutional federalism |
| Funding conditions delayed | 3-year delay allows resistance | Political compromise |
| No private enforcement | Depends on DOJ enforcement | Federalism concerns |
| Witness safety exception | Could be over-invoked | Legitimate concern exploited |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Independent data auditing**: Require third-party verification of prosecution data; create audit function in DOJ Inspector General.

2. **Alternative enforcement**: Create private right of action for defendants to enforce disclosure requirements; provide attorney's fees for successful claims.

3. **Accelerated state timeline**: Reduce 3-year window to 18 months; limit waiver authority.

4. **CIU independence standards**: Require CIU staff to have no prior service in trial division; create external advisory board.

5. **Bar discipline follow-through**: Require state bars to report action taken on DOJ referrals; create federal database of prosecutorial misconduct.

### Ending Prosecutorial Immunity Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| "Qualified" immunity expansion | Courts interpret qualified immunity broadly | High |
| "Clearly established" barrier | Courts require prior identical case | High |
| Entity judgment-proof | Small jurisdictions can't pay judgments | Moderate |
| Insurance limitations | Exclusions for intentional acts | Moderate |
| Individual cap too low | $50,000 insufficient deterrent | Moderate |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Prospective only | Past misconduct immune | Legal constraints |
| Qualified immunity remains | Some immunity continues | Political compromise |
| Proof burdens high | Plaintiffs still face hurdles | Litigation realities |
| Judicial interpretation | Courts may narrow scope | Judicial resistance |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Define "clearly established" broadly**: Statutory language specifying that general constitutional principles suffice; no requirement of factually identical prior case.

2. **Raise individual cap**: Increase to $250,000 or index to severity of misconduct and defendant's sentence.

3. **State insurance pools**: Create state-level insurance pools to ensure judgment satisfaction.

4. **Discovery rights**: Provide explicit discovery rights in prosecutorial misconduct cases.

5. **Attorney's fees**: Mandatory fee-shifting for successful claims.

### Model Open-File Discovery Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Protective order abuse | Witness safety invoked routinely | High |
| Incomplete disclosure | "All evidence" interpreted narrowly | High |
| Late disclosure | Disclosed on eve of trial | Moderate |
| Plea timing bypass | Quick pleas before disclosure | High |
| Certification without substance | Check-box compliance | Moderate |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Police cooperation | Police may not share with prosecutors | Separate institutions |
| Resource constraints | Small offices lack tracking systems | Capacity |
| Enforcement varies | Judges inconsistent | Judicial discretion |
| No private cause of action | Depends on judicial enforcement | Design choice |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Protective order standards**: Require specific threat documentation; automatic 30-day review; defense counsel access under all circumstances.

2. **Define "evidence" expansively**: Include all notes, communications, and work product with exceptions only for true attorney-client privilege.

3. **Police disclosure mandates**: Require police to certify complete file transfer to prosecutors; create independent verification.

4. **Automatic dismissal**: Provide for dismissal without prejudice for repeated disclosure failures.

5. **Post-conviction discovery**: Provide ongoing right to prosecution file after conviction for innocence claims.

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|------------------|
| Political vulnerability | Codify reforms in legislation, not just office policy |
| Judicial resistance | Legislative mandates with clear standards |
| Prosecutor culture | Mandatory training, reformed metrics, hiring changes |
| Resource limitations | Dedicated funding streams |
| Data infrastructure | State-provided systems for smaller offices |
| Inter-branch conflicts | Clear statutory authority, separation of powers analysis |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

All legislation should include:

1. **5-year review**: Mandatory legislative review of effectiveness after 5 years.

2. **Data-driven adjustment**: Annual reports informing potential amendments.

3. **Stakeholder input**: Required consultation with defense bar, affected communities, and innocence organizations.

4. **No premature termination**: Reforms should not sunset without affirmative legislative action; default to continuation.

5. **Metric evolution**: Periodic review and update of data collection requirements to address gaming.
