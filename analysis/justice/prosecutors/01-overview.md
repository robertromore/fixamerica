# Prosecutorial Reform: Overview

## Executive Summary

American prosecutors wield extraordinary power with minimal accountability. As the "most powerful officials in the criminal justice system," prosecutors decide who gets charged, what charges are filed, what plea deals are offered, and whether to seek harsh or lenient sentences. These decisions are made almost entirely behind closed doors, with no meaningful oversight or transparency. Prosecutorial discretion, while necessary, has become prosecutorial dominion.

The results are devastating: mass incarceration driven by overcharging and coercive plea bargaining, wrongful convictions enabled by Brady violations and misconduct, and profound racial disparities in charging and sentencing. While police misconduct draws public attention, prosecutorial misconduct that ruins innocent lives rarely results in any consequences for the prosecutor involved.

Reform requires a fundamental reimagining of prosecutorial culture and accountability: mandatory open-file discovery, data transparency, external oversight, meaningful consequences for misconduct, and conviction integrity units to correct past errors. The reform prosecutor movement shows that change is possible when voters elect district attorneys committed to justice over convictions.

## Scope

### What This Subtopic Covers

- **Charging Decisions**: Standards for charging, overcharging, charge stacking
- **Plea Bargaining**: Prosecutorial power in negotiations, trial penalty, coercion
- **Discovery Obligations**: Brady requirements, open-file discovery, violations
- **Prosecutorial Misconduct**: Types, prevalence, consequences (or lack thereof)
- **Conviction Integrity**: Reviewing past convictions, exonerations
- **Reform Prosecutors**: Progressive prosecution movement, policies, outcomes
- **Accountability**: Oversight mechanisms, discipline, civil liability

### What This Subtopic Does Not Cover

- Defense attorneys (see [Courts: Public Defense](../courts/02-current-state.md))
- Judicial role in criminal cases (see [Courts](../courts/01-overview.md))
- Federal prosecution specifically (covered generally here)
- Immigration enforcement (see [Immigration](../../immigration/01-overview.md))

## Key Questions

1. **Why do prosecutors have so much unchecked power?** What structural and legal factors have given prosecutors near-total control over case outcomes?

2. **How does prosecutorial discretion drive mass incarceration?** What role do charging decisions, plea bargaining, and sentencing recommendations play?

3. **Why is prosecutorial misconduct so rarely punished?** What explains the near-total impunity for prosecutors who violate defendants' rights?

4. **Can reform prosecutors change the system from within?** What have progressive prosecutors accomplished, and what limits do they face?

5. **What reforms would create meaningful accountability?** Which interventions have the best evidence for reducing misconduct and improving outcomes?

## Why This Matters

**Wrongful Convictions**: Prosecutorial misconduct contributes to ~30% of wrongful convictions; most prosecutors face no consequences

**Mass Incarceration**: Charging and plea decisions, not judges, drive incarceration rates

**Racial Disparities**: Black defendants face more charges, fewer plea offers, and harsher recommendations than white defendants for similar offenses

**Coerced Pleas**: 97%+ of convictions come from guilty pleas, many coerced through trial penalty and pretrial detention

**Innocence**: Estimated 2-8% of guilty pleas involve innocent people; prosecutors often resist post-conviction review

**Trust**: Public confidence in prosecutorial fairness is low, especially in communities of color

## Key Statistics

| Metric | Data |
|--------|------|
| Conviction rate (federal) | 99.6% |
| Cases resolved by plea | 94-98% |
| Exonerations involving misconduct | ~30% |
| Prosecutors disciplined for misconduct | <2% of documented cases |
| District attorneys nationally | ~2,400 |
| Reform prosecutors elected | 70+ (2016-2024) |
| Average trial penalty | 2-3x plea sentence |

## The Problem in Context

### Prosecutorial Power Compared

| Decision | Who Decides | Oversight |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Whether to charge | Prosecutor alone | None |
| What charges to file | Prosecutor alone | None |
| Plea offer terms | Prosecutor | Minimal judicial |
| Sentencing recommendation | Prosecutor | Judge can deviate |
| Brady disclosure | Prosecutor | Rare post-conviction review |
| Case dismissal | Prosecutor | None |

### Compared to Other Actors

| Actor | Accountability | Transparency | External Review |
|-------|---------------|--------------|-----------------|
| Police | Some oversight | Body cameras, data | Civilian review boards |
| Judges | Appellate review | Public proceedings | Judicial conduct commissions |
| Defense attorneys | Bar discipline | Client relations | Malpractice suits |
| Prosecutors | Almost none | No data required | Immunity from suit |
