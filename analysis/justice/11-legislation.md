# Criminal Justice Reform: Legislation

## Overview

Criminal justice reform requires action at federal, state, and local levels. This document provides draft legislation addressing the most critical reforms: policing accountability, sentencing reform, bail reform, reentry barriers, and prison conditions. Because criminal law is primarily state-controlled, model state legislation is particularly important.

## Constitutional Amendments

### Right to Vote Amendment

**Purpose**: Eliminate felony disenfranchisement and guarantee voting rights for all citizens.

**Draft Text**:

```text
Section 1. The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall
not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on
account of criminal conviction.

Section 2. Congress shall have the power to enforce this article
by appropriate legislation.

Section 3. This article shall take effect two years after the date
of ratification.
```

**Explanation**:

- Section 1 prohibits disenfranchisement for any criminal conviction
- Applies to all elections (federal, state, local)
- Does not address incarcerated voting (states could still restrict)
- Section 3 provides transition period

**Potential Challenges**:

- States' rights objections
- "Criminals shouldn't vote" rhetoric
- Difficult amendment process

**Refinements**:

- Narrower version: automatic restoration after sentence completion
- Include incarcerated voting for maximum impact
- Federal legislation as alternative (for federal elections)

### Right to Counsel Amendment

**Purpose**: Strengthen and enforce the right to adequate legal representation.

**Draft Text**:

```text
Section 1. In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall have
effective assistance of counsel. No person shall be deprived of
liberty without representation by counsel who has adequate time,
resources, and training to provide effective assistance.

Section 2. Congress and the States shall ensure adequate funding
for the defense of persons unable to afford counsel, at a level
sufficient to provide effective assistance.

Section 3. Congress shall have the power to enforce this article
by appropriate legislation.
```

**Explanation**:

- Strengthens Sixth Amendment with "effective" standard
- Creates affirmative funding obligation
- Enables federal enforcement of defense standards

**Potential Challenges**:

- Federalism concerns
- Funding implications
- Enforcement mechanisms unclear

```

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

**Qualified Immunity**:

- Can be addressed by statute (42 U.S.C. § 1983 amendment)
- No constitutional requirement for qualified immunity
- State legislatures can eliminate for state claims

**Federalism**:

- Criminal law primarily state responsibility
- Federal legislation through spending power, commerce clause
- Funding conditions must be clearly stated and not coercive

**Due Process**:

- Bail reform must include procedural protections
- Detention requires hearing and findings
- Record sealing must balance interests

### Preemption Questions

**Federal Floor**:

- States may exceed federal protections
- State qualified immunity elimination not preempted
- Local reforms may be preempted by state law

**State Preemption**:

- Some states preempt local police reforms
- May need state legislation to enable local action

### Enforcement Mechanisms

**Civil Rights Enforcement**:

- Section 1983 for individual claims
- Pattern-or-practice for systemic reform
- State attorneys general authority

**Administrative Enforcement**:

- Funding conditions
- Consent decrees
- Regulatory requirements

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Funding condition workaround | Agencies forgo federal funds to avoid requirements | Moderate |
| Qualified immunity judicial restoration | Courts narrow statutory immunity elimination | High |
| Risk assessment bias | Validated instruments still produce racial disparities | High |
| Sealing record access | Exceptions swallow the rule | Moderate |
| Decertification avoidance | Officers resign before investigation | Moderate |
| Consent decree termination | Premature release from oversight | High |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| State variability | Uneven reform across states | Federalism limits federal action |
| Implementation capacity | Reforms on paper not in practice | Insufficient funding/training |
| Political vulnerability | Reforms reversed after crime increases | Electoral pressures |
| Cultural resistance | Institutional resistance to change | Entrenched interests |
| Victim exclusion | Some reforms don't center victims | Advocate vs. survivor divide |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Strengthen funding conditions**: Make federal funding contingent on compliance with specific measurable standards, not just policy adoption.

2. **Explicit statutory language on immunity**: Include congressional findings that immunity elimination is constitutional and intentional.

3. **Bias testing requirements**: Require ongoing validation and bias testing of risk assessment instruments with mandatory correction if disparities found.

4. **Narrow exceptions**: Draft record sealing exceptions narrowly with sunset provisions.

5. **Automatic decertification trigger**: Require decertification investigation upon any resignation under investigation.

6. **Consent decree sustainability**: Require multi-year sustained compliance before termination; provide ongoing monitoring resources.

### General Implementation Concerns

- Technical assistance needed for agencies adopting new practices
- Funding for public defender improvements must accompany procedural reforms
- Community involvement in oversight essential for legitimacy
- Transition support for affected workers (guards, bail agents)
- Training must accompany policy changes
