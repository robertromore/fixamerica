# Wrongful Convictions: Root Causes

## Eyewitness Misidentification

### Why Eyewitnesses Are Unreliable

**Memory Science**:

- Memory is reconstructive, not recording
- Post-event information alters memory
- Stress impairs encoding
- Cross-race identification less accurate
- Confidence does not equal accuracy

**System Factors**:

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Suggestive procedures | Bias witness choice |
| Administrator knowledge | Unintentional cues |
| Simultaneous lineups | Relative judgment |
| No confidence statement | Later inflation |
| Repeated viewings | False familiarity |

### Cross-Racial Identification

**The Problem**:

- People less accurate identifying other races
- "Own-race bias" well-documented
- Black defendants more likely misidentified
- Contributes to racial disparity in wrongful convictions

## False Confessions

### Why Innocent People Confess

**Psychological Factors**:

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Interrogation pressure | Break down resistance |
| False evidence ploys | Create despair |
| Minimization | Make confession seem harmless |
| Exhaustion | Impair judgment |
| Youth | More susceptible |
| Mental disability | More vulnerable |

**Reid Technique Problems**:

- Confrontational approach
- Designed to extract confession
- Assumes guilt from beginning
- Vulnerable populations at risk
- Not designed to detect innocence

### Who Is Most Vulnerable

| Population | Risk Factors |
|------------|--------------|
| Juveniles | Developmental immaturity |
| Mentally ill | Impaired judgment |
| Intellectually disabled | Compliance, confusion |
| Intoxicated | Impaired judgment |
| Exhausted | Reduced capacity |

## Unreliable Forensic Science

### The Junk Science Problem

**Techniques Without Validation**:

| Technique | Problems |
|-----------|----------|
| Bite mark analysis | No scientific basis for individualization |
| Microscopic hair comparison | High error rate |
| Fire investigation (old methods) | "Indicators" not valid |
| Blood spatter (some claims) | Overinterpretation |
| Tool mark analysis | Subjective, unvalidated |

### Why Junk Science Persists

- Developed in law enforcement, not science
- Courts admitted without scrutiny
- No federal oversight
- Crime labs not independent
- Defense can't challenge effectively
- Judicial deference to "experts"

### Crime Lab Problems

**Systemic Issues**:

| Problem | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Lab under police/prosecution | Confirmation bias |
| No independence | Pressure for results |
| Inadequate training | Errors |
| No accreditation | No standards |
| Analyst testimony | Overstatement |

## Official Misconduct

### Prosecutorial Misconduct

**Types of Misconduct**:

| Type | Effect |
|------|--------|
| Brady violations | Defense doesn't get evidence |
| Knowingly using false testimony | Perjury enabled |
| Improper argument | Jury misled |
| Fabricating evidence | False proof |
| Coercing witnesses | False testimony |

**Why Misconduct Occurs**:

- Pressure to convict
- No accountability
- Absolute immunity
- Win-at-all-costs culture
- Tunnel vision

### Police Misconduct

**Contributing Behaviors**:

- Tunnel vision on suspect
- Suggestive identification procedures
- Coercive interrogation
- Fabricating evidence
- Coaching witnesses
- Hiding exculpatory evidence

### Lack of Accountability

| Level | Accountability Gap |
|-------|-------------------|
| Prosecutors | Absolute immunity from civil liability |
| Police | Qualified immunity limits liability |
| Forensic analysts | No licensing, rarely disciplined |
| System | No consequences for errors |

## Inadequate Defense

### Why Defense Fails

**Systemic Causes**:

| Cause | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Underfunding | No resources for investigation |
| Excessive caseloads | No time per case |
| No experts | Can't challenge forensics |
| No investigators | Can't find witnesses |
| Strickland standard | Hard to prove ineffective |

### Specific Failures

- Failing to investigate alibi
- Failing to challenge forensics
- Failing to interview witnesses
- Failing to file motions
- Failing to prepare for trial
- Encouraging innocent to plead guilty

## Informant Testimony

### The Incentive Problem

**Jailhouse Informants**:

| Issue | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| Benefit for testimony | Motivation to lie |
| Access to case information | Can fabricate details |
| No corroboration required | Word against defendant |
| Jury believes | False credibility |
| Repeat informants | Professional liars |

### Why Informants Lie

- Sentence reductions
- Charges dropped
- Money payments
- Better conditions
- Status among peers
- Pressure from authorities

## Systemic Factors

### Tunnel Vision

**Definition**: Focus on one suspect to exclusion of alternatives

**Manifestations**:

- Confirmation bias
- Ignoring contradictory evidence
- Interpreting ambiguous evidence against defendant
- Resistance to reconsidering
- Group reinforcement

### Plea Bargaining Pressure

**Innocent People Plead Guilty**:

| Factor | Pressure |
|--------|----------|
| Trial penalty | Much worse sentence if lose |
| Risk aversion | Avoid worst outcome |
| Pretrial detention | Already in jail |
| Overcharging | Frightening charges |
| Inadequate counsel | Poor advice |

### Finality Over Accuracy

**System Values**:

- Courts prioritize finality
- Procedural barriers to review
- Time limits on claims
- High standards for new evidence
- Resistance to reopening cases

## Intersection of Causes

### Multiple Causes in Cases

**Typical Pattern**:

```text
Police focus on suspect (tunnel vision)
        ↓
Suggestive identification (eyewitness error)
        ↓
Coercive interrogation (false confession or statements)
        ↓
Forensic "match" (junk science)
        ↓
Prosecutor hides problems (Brady violation)
        ↓
Defense doesn't investigate (inadequate defense)
        ↓
Conviction
```

### Compounding Effects

- Each error reinforces others
- Investigators seek confirmation
- Contrary evidence discounted
- Defense overwhelmed
- Jury sees seemingly strong case
