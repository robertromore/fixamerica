# Wrongful Convictions: Overview

Wrongful convictions represent the ultimate failure of the criminal justice system—innocent people punished for crimes they did not commit. Since 1989, over 3,400 people have been exonerated in the United States, collectively serving over 30,000 years for crimes they did not commit. The true number of wrongful convictions is certainly far higher. Reform requires addressing the systemic causes: eyewitness misidentification, false confessions, junk science, prosecutorial misconduct, and inadequate defense.
