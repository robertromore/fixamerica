# Wrongful Convictions: Overview

## Executive Summary

Wrongful convictions represent the ultimate failure of the criminal justice system—innocent people punished for crimes they did not commit. Since 1989, over 3,400 people have been exonerated in the United States, collectively serving over 30,000 years for crimes they did not commit. The true number of wrongful convictions is certainly far higher. Reform requires addressing the systemic causes: eyewitness misidentification, false confessions, junk science, prosecutorial misconduct, and inadequate defense.

## Scope

This section addresses:

- Causes of wrongful convictions
- Exoneration and innocence proceedings
- DNA and non-DNA exonerations
- Compensation for the wrongfully convicted
- Prevention reforms
- Prosecutorial accountability
- Defense quality
- Forensic science reform

## Key Statistics

| Metric | Value | Significance |
|--------|-------|--------------|
| Total exonerations (since 1989) | 3,400+ | Known wrongful convictions |
| Years served | 30,000+ | Collective lost years |
| False confessions in exonerations | 27% | Confessions aren't always true |
| Eyewitness misidentification | 69% of DNA exonerations | Leading cause |
| Official misconduct | 54% of exonerations | System failure |
| Black exonerees | 53% | Racial disparity |

## Core Problems

### Leading Causes of Wrongful Convictions

| Cause | Prevalence | Nature |
|-------|------------|--------|
| Eyewitness misidentification | 69% of DNA cases | Memory fallibility |
| False confessions | 27% | Psychological coercion |
| Junk science | 24% | Unreliable forensics |
| Prosecutorial misconduct | 54% | Brady violations, misconduct |
| Inadequate defense | 17% | Failure to investigate |
| Informant testimony | 18% | Incentivized lies |

### System Failures

**No Effective Remedy**:

- Courts hostile to innocence claims
- Procedural barriers block review
- Finality valued over accuracy
- Post-conviction resources scarce
- Even DNA cases face delays

**No Accountability**:

- Prosecutors rarely disciplined for misconduct
- Police face no consequences for false testimony
- Forensic analysts not held accountable
- System protects itself

**Racial Disparities**:

| Crime Type | Black Exonerees | Population Share |
|------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Murder | 50% | 13% |
| Sexual assault | 59% | 13% |
| Drug crimes | 68% | 13% |

### Inadequate Compensation

**State Compensation**:

| Approach | States |
|----------|--------|
| No compensation law | 13 states |
| Compensation law | 37 states + DC |
| Adequate compensation | Few |

**Average Compensation**: $50,000 per year of incarceration (where available)

## The Stakes

**For the Wrongfully Convicted**:

- Years lost to prison
- Separation from family
- Lost careers and education
- Psychological trauma
- Stigma even after exoneration
- Difficult reentry

**For Victims**:

- Wrong person punished
- Real perpetrator free
- False closure
- Additional trauma at exoneration
- No justice

**For Public Safety**:

- Actual perpetrators remain free
- Many commit additional crimes
- Resources wasted on innocent
- System credibility undermined

**For Justice System**:

- Legitimacy questioned
- Resources diverted
- True purpose subverted
- Public trust eroded

## Reform Vision

### Immediate Goals

- Fund innocence projects nationwide
- Preserve biological evidence
- Require recorded interrogations
- Reform eyewitness identification
- Ensure compensation for exonerees

### Medium-Term Goals

- Establish conviction integrity units
- Reform forensic science
- Prosecutorial accountability
- Post-conviction review access
- Jailhouse informant regulation

### Long-Term Vision

- Prevention-focused system
- Accuracy over finality
- Meaningful post-conviction review
- Zero tolerance for misconduct
- Compensation as right, not gift

## Why Reform Is Possible Now

1. **DNA Revolution**: DNA exonerations created undeniable evidence of innocence
2. **Innocence Movement**: Innocence projects in every state
3. **Conviction Integrity Units**: Growing adoption by prosecutors
4. **Forensic Science Reform**: NAS report and growing awareness
5. **Bipartisan Support**: Reform appeals across political spectrum
6. **Media Attention**: Documentaries, podcasts raise awareness
