# Wrongful Convictions: History

## Early Recognition

### Historical Awareness

**Pre-Modern Era**:

- Wrongful convictions always existed
- Limited ability to prove innocence
- Execution of innocent known but rare
- No systematic understanding
- Individual cases, not systemic analysis

**Early Cases**:

| Case | Year | Significance |
|------|------|--------------|
| Timothy Evans (UK) | 1950 | Led to abolition movement |
| James Hanratty (UK) | 1962 | DNA later confirmed guilt |
| George Whitmore Jr. | 1964 | False confession, Miranda |

## The DNA Revolution

### First DNA Exonerations

**Gary Dotson (1989)**:

- First DNA exoneration
- Convicted of rape in Illinois
- Victim recanted, then DNA proved innocence
- 10 years served
- Opened new era

**Early Exonerations**:

| Year | Exonerees | Significance |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| 1989 | 1 | First DNA exoneration |
| 1990-1992 | 5 | Pattern emerging |
| 1993-1995 | 20 | Growing awareness |
| 1996-2000 | 50+ | Movement building |

### Impact of DNA

**Undeniable Proof**:

- DNA couldn't be explained away
- Scientific certainty of innocence
- Forced acknowledgment of system failure
- Changed public understanding
- Created precedent for innocence claims

**Revealing Causes**:

- DNA cases exposed eyewitness failure
- False confessions documented
- Junk science exposed
- Prosecutorial misconduct revealed
- Inadequate defense documented

## The Innocence Movement

### Innocence Project Founded (1992)

**Barry Scheck and Peter Neufeld**:

- Founded at Cardozo Law School
- Pioneered DNA exoneration work
- Created model for innocence organizations
- Combined litigation and policy reform
- Trained generation of innocence lawyers

### Movement Growth

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| 1992-2000 | Innocence Project establishes model |
| 2000-2005 | Innocence network forms |
| 2005-2010 | Projects in most states |
| 2010-2015 | Non-DNA innocence work expands |
| 2015-present | Conviction integrity units grow |

### Key Milestones

**Kirk Bloodsworth (1993)**:

- First death row DNA exoneration
- Maryland case
- Became leading advocate
- Transformed debate on capital punishment

**Anthony Porter (1999)**:

- Illinois death row
- Journalism students proved innocence
- Led to moratorium, eventual abolition
- Showed near-execution of innocent

## Legislative Response

### Early Reform

**Post-Conviction DNA Access**:

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1994 | First state DNA access law (New York) |
| 2000-2005 | Wave of state legislation |
| 2004 | Justice for All Act (federal) |
| 2010 | Most states have access laws |

**Evidence Preservation**:

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1990s | Ad hoc, inconsistent |
| 2000s | State legislation begins |
| 2010s | Most states require preservation |
| Present | Still gaps and failures |

### Compensation Laws

| Period | Development |
|--------|-------------|
| Pre-2000 | 15 states with compensation |
| 2000-2010 | Wave of new laws |
| 2010-2020 | Improvement in amounts |
| Present | 37 states + DC have laws |

## Judicial Response

### Supreme Court Cases

***Herrera v. Collins* (1993)**:

- Claimed "actual innocence" not enough
- Required constitutional violation too
- Narrow path for innocence claims
- Finality emphasized over accuracy

***House v. Bell* (2006)**:

- DNA evidence can overcome procedural default
- Gateway for new trial
- But high bar to clear

***McQuiggin v. Perkins* (2013)**:

- "Actual innocence" exception to time limits
- Narrow but significant
- Required "more likely than not" standard

### Patterns in Court Response

- Courts slow to embrace innocence
- Procedural barriers maintained
- Finality prioritized
- DNA cases easier than non-DNA
- System reluctance to admit error

## Forensic Science Scandals

### Crime Lab Failures

| Lab | Year | Problem | Impact |
|-----|------|---------|--------|
| Houston Crime Lab | 2002 | Multiple failures | 180+ cases reviewed |
| Virginia | 2005 | Hair analysis errors | Dozens affected |
| North Carolina | 2010 | Blood evidence | Multiple convictions questioned |
| Massachusetts (Dookhan) | 2012 | Fabricated results | 24,000+ cases affected |
| Massachusetts (Farak) | 2014 | Drug tampering | 11,000+ cases affected |

### NAS Report (2009)

**Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States**:

- National Academy of Sciences
- Found forensic science lacking
- Many techniques not validated
- Need for standards, research
- Recommended reform
- Led to slow improvements

## High-Profile Cases

### Cases That Changed Understanding

**Central Park Five (1989, Exonerated 2002)**:

- Five teenagers falsely convicted
- Coerced confessions
- Actual perpetrator confessed, DNA confirmed
- Became symbol of system failure
- Netflix documentary raised awareness

**Cameron Todd Willingham (Executed 2004)**:

- Texas arson case
- Fire science discredited after execution
- Strong evidence of innocence
- State refused posthumous exoneration
- Showed execution of innocent possible

**Steven Avery (2003, *Making a Murderer*)**:

- Exonerated after 18 years
- Later convicted of another crime
- Raised questions about system
- Massive public attention

## Evolution of Understanding

### Shifting Recognition

| Era | Understanding |
|-----|---------------|
| 1980s | Wrongful convictions rare, individual failures |
| 1990s | DNA proves systemic problem |
| 2000s | Reform movement grows |
| 2010s | Broader causes recognized |
| 2020s | Official misconduct central |

### Current Understanding

- Wrongful convictions are systemic
- Multiple causes often combine
- Racial disparities significant
- Prevention possible with reform
- System resists accountability
