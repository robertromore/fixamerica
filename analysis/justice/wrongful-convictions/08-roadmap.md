## Phase 2: Systemic Reform (Years 2-3)

### Conviction Integrity Units

**Expansion**:

| Year | Target |
|------|--------|
| Year 2 | CIUs in 25 largest jurisdictions |
| Year 3 | CIUs in states with most exonerations |
| Year 4 | CIUs in every state |

**Quality Standards**:

- Independence from trial prosecutors
- Dedicated resources
- Partnership with innocence projects
- Transparent reporting

### Forensic Science Reform

**Legislative Package**:

- State forensic science commissions
- Crime lab independence
- Accreditation requirements
- Testimony standards
- Expert access for defense

### Post-Conviction Access

**Reform Legislation**:

- Expand DNA testing access
- Create freestanding innocence claims
- Eliminate time limits on new evidence
- Fund post-conviction representation

## Phase 3: Accountability (Years 4-5)

### Prosecutorial Accountability

**Implementation**:

| Reform | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Brady training mandatory | All prosecutors |
| Pattern tracking | Statewide systems |
| Bar discipline | Active enforcement |
| Named in opinions | Routine practice |

### Police Accountability

**Reforms**:

- Interrogation method training
- Recording compliance monitoring
- Identification procedure audits
- Accountability for misconduct

### Compensation Reform

**Universal Access**:

- Compensation laws in all states
- Adequate amounts ($100,000/year)
- Eliminate exclusions
- Immediate access upon exoneration
- Reentry services included

## Phase 4: Prevention Culture (Years 5+)

### System-Wide Training

**Comprehensive Training**:

| Audience | Topics |
|----------|--------|
| Police academies | Memory science, interrogation |
| Prosecutor training | Brady, tunnel vision |
| Judicial education | Forensics, eyewitness |
| Defense training | Innocence investigation |
| Forensic training | Cognitive bias |

### Continuous Improvement

**Learning Systems**:

- Analyze every exoneration for lessons
- Publish findings and recommendations
- Implement improvements
- Track reform effectiveness

### National Standards

**Federal Action**:

- National forensic science commission with enforcement
- Federal funding conditions
- Research and development
- Oversight and accountability

## Implementation Requirements

### Political Strategy

**Coalition Building**:

- Exonerees as advocates
- Conservative partners (limited government)
- Law enforcement reformers
- Victim allies
- Faith community

**Messaging**:

| Audience | Frame |
|----------|-------|
| Conservatives | Accuracy, limited government |
| Progressives | Racial justice, civil liberties |
| Law enforcement | Credibility, catching real perpetrators |
| General public | Justice, preventing tragedy |

### Resource Requirements

**Investment Needs**:

| Category | Investment |
|----------|------------|
| DNA testing | Moderate |
| Recording equipment | Moderate |
| CIUs | Moderate (within DA budgets) |
| Forensic reform | Significant |
| Compensation | Significant |
| Training | Moderate |

**Cost-Effectiveness**:

- Prevention cheaper than exoneration
- Exoneration cheaper than continued incarceration
- Real perpetrator caught prevents future crimes
- System credibility valuable

### Capacity Building

**Workforce Needs**:

- CIU staff training
- Forensic science expertise
- Post-conviction attorneys
- Investigator training
- Exoneree support services

- Contingency: Emphasize prevention, not just exoneration
- Contingency: Focus on accuracy benefits everyone

**Backlash from System**:

- Risk: Prosecutors resist accountability
- Contingency: Build law enforcement allies
- Contingency: Emphasize shared interest in accuracy

### Implementation Risks

**Resource Constraints**:

- Risk: Insufficient funding
- Contingency: Prioritize prevention reforms
- Contingency: Federal funding advocacy
- Contingency: Private foundation support

**Quality Variation**:

- Risk: Reforms implemented poorly
- Contingency: Model policies and training
- Contingency: Technical assistance
- Contingency: Monitoring and accountability

### Capacity Risks

**Innocence Project Overwhelm**:

- Risk: More claims than can be handled
- Contingency: CIU development
- Contingency: Triage improvements
- Contingency: Prevention focus
