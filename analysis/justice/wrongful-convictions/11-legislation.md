## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Guilty plea bar | Compensation denied for guilty pleas | High |
| "Contributed to conviction" | Broad exclusion | High |
| Testing standard | "Reasonable probability" too high | Moderate |
| Forensic standards voluntary | No enforcement | High |
| Recording exceptions | Too many exceptions | Moderate |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Underfunding | Limited capacity | Budget constraints |
| Training gaps | Poor implementation | Resource limits |
| Variation | Uneven application | Local discretion |
| Enforcement | Standards ignored | No consequences |
| Capacity | CIUs overwhelmed | Demand exceeds resources |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Eliminate guilty plea bar**: Compensation should be available unless plea was made with actual knowledge of guilt.

2. **Narrow contribution exclusion**: Only conduct that actually caused the wrongful conviction should bar compensation.

3. **Lower testing standard**: Testing should be ordered if it "may" produce relevant evidence.

4. **Mandatory forensic standards**: Tie federal funding to compliance; exclude non-compliant evidence.

5. **Narrow recording exceptions**: Only equipment failure and safety should excuse non-recording; presumption of inadmissibility.

### General Implementation Concerns

- Adequate funding for innocence investigation
- Training for all system actors
- Quality control for CIUs
- Independence of forensic labs
- Political will to sustain reform
- Capacity for exoneree services
