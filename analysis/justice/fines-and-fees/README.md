# Fines, Fees, and Monetary Sanctions in the Justice System

The American justice system has transformed monetary sanctions—fines, fees, surcharges, and costs—from incidental penalties into a primary mechanism for funding courts, law enforcement, and government operations. This shift has created a two-tiered system where those with resources pay their way out while those without become trapped in cycles of debt, incarceration, and poverty. What was once called "debtors' prison" has been reconstituted under different names, extracting billions from the poorest Americans while undermining public safety and democratic legitimacy.
