## Structural Reforms

### Ability-to-Pay Determinations

**Required Elements:**

### Day Fines System

Used successfully in Europe, day fines calibrate penalties to income.

| Component | Calculation |
|-----------|-------------|
| Offense units | Number based on offense severity (1-120) |
| Day fine amount | Defendant's daily disposable income |
| Total fine | Units x Day fine amount |

**Example:**

|-----------|---------------|--------------|------------|
| Low-income | 30 | $20 | $600 |
| Middle-income | 30 | $100 | $3,000 |
| High-income | 30 | $400 | $12,000 |
