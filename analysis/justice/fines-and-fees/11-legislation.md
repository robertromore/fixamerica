## Federal Legislation

### The Fair Justice Act

```
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Fair Justice Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
    (1) Fines, fees, and monetary sanctions in the criminal justice
        system disproportionately burden low-income individuals and
        communities of color.
    (2) The practice of incarcerating individuals for inability to
        pay court-imposed financial obligations constitutes a modern
        form of debtors' prison prohibited by the Constitution.
    (3) Driver's license suspensions for unpaid court debt unrelated
        to driving offenses trap individuals in cycles of poverty
        and unemployment.
    (4) Revenue-driven enforcement practices undermine public trust
        in the justice system and violate constitutional protections.
    (5) The federal government has a compelling interest in ensuring
        equal protection and due process throughout the nation's
        criminal justice system.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
    (1) ABILITY TO PAY.—The term "ability to pay" means a

        individual's income, assets, essential expenses, and
        dependents.
    (2) COURT DEBT.—The term "court debt" means any fine, fee,

        (2) found, on the record, that the individual has the present
            ability to pay and has willfully refused to do so;

            be heard, including the right to counsel if incarceration
            is a possible outcome.
    (b) PRESUMPTION OF INABILITY.—An individual shall be presumed

            guidelines;

    (c) NO LONGER SENTENCES.—No court in a covered jurisdiction may
        impose a longer period of incarceration, probation, or

        debt.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
    (1) On any given day, approximately 470,000 people are held in
        local jails awaiting trial because they cannot afford bail.
    (2) Wealth-based pretrial detention violates the presumption of
        innocence and equal protection principles.
    (3) Pretrial detention causes job loss, housing instability,
        family separation, and increased likelihood of conviction.
    (4) The commercial bail bond industry extracts billions of
        dollars from low-income communities while providing no
        public safety benefit.

        manage risk without wealth-based detention.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
    (1) COMMERCIAL BAIL.—The term "commercial bail" means any
        system in which a for-profit entity provides a bond or
        surety in exchange for a non-refundable fee.

        (2) RELEASE CONDITIONS.—If a judicial officer determines
            that release on personal recognizance is insufficient,
            the officer may impose the least restrictive non-
            financial conditions necessary to ensure appearance and
            public safety.
        (3) DETENTION HEARING.—Pretrial detention may only be
            ordered following a hearing at which the government
            proves by clear and convincing evidence that no
            conditions of release can reasonably assure appearance
            and public safety.
    (b) STATE INCENTIVES.—
        (1) GRANT PROGRAM.—The Attorney General shall establish a

(b) EXCEPTION.—This section does not apply to license suspensions

Legislature on:
    (a) the number of licenses reinstated under this Act;
    (b) the number of licenses currently suspended and the reasons
        for suspension; and
    (c) demographic information on individuals with suspended
        licenses.
