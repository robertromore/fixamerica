# History of Fines, Fees, and Monetary Sanctions

## Colonial Era to Founding (1600s-1789)

### English Common Law Traditions

The American system of monetary sanctions inherited from England a complex relationship with fines and debtors' imprisonment.

| Period | Practice | Legacy |
|--------|----------|--------|
| Medieval England | "Amercements" - discretionary fines | Arbitrary fine-setting |
| Magna Carta (1215) | Limited amercements to ability to pay | First ability-to-pay principle |
| Debtors' prisons | Widespread imprisonment for debt | Colonial adoption |
| Poor laws | Fines and forced labor for vagrancy | Criminalization of poverty |

### Colonial American Practices

| Colony | Notable Practices |
|--------|-------------------|
| Virginia | "Benefit of clergy" - pay to avoid punishment |
| Massachusetts | Fines as alternative to corporal punishment |
| Pennsylvania | Quaker preference for fines over physical penalty |
| Southern colonies | Fines for failure to work, vagrancy |

## Early Republic (1789-1860)

### Constitutional Framework

The Founders included several provisions relevant to fines:

| Constitutional Provision | Original Understanding |
|-------------------------|----------------------|
| 8th Amendment (1791) | "Excessive fines shall not be imposed" |
| Article I, Section 9 | No bills of attainder or ex post facto laws |
| 5th Amendment | Due process before deprivation of property |

### Debtors' Prisons

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1800 | 2,000+ imprisoned for debt in New York City alone |
| 1820s | Prison reform movement begins |
| 1831-1849 | Most states abolish imprisonment for debt |
| 1833 | Federal government abolishes debtors' prison |

### Timeline of Abolition

| State | Year Abolished | Notes |
|-------|----------------|-------|
| Kentucky | 1821 | First state |
| Ohio | 1828 | Constitutional provision |
| New York | 1831 | After major reform campaign |
| Pennsylvania | 1842 | Gradual phase-out |
| Massachusetts | 1857 | One of last northern states |

## Post-Civil War and Reconstruction (1860-1900)

### The Convict Lease System

The abolition of slavery created incentives for new forms of coerced labor through the criminal justice system.

| Practice | Description | States |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Convict leasing | State "leased" prisoners to private companies | All Southern states |
| Debt peonage | Criminal fines paid by "employers" for forced labor | Alabama, Georgia, Mississippi |
| Vagrancy laws | Fines for unemployment, leading to lease system | South-wide |
| Black Codes | Fines for "offensive gestures," "insulting language" | All former Confederate states |

### The Economics of Racial Control

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| High fines for minor offenses | Create unpayable debt |
| Inability to pay → jail | Provide labor force |
| Convict leasing fees | Revenue for counties |
| Employers pay fines | Create debt bondage |

## Progressive Era (1900-1929)

|-------------|---------------------|
| Medical model of crime | Fines seen as counterproductive |

## The Ferguson Moment (2014-2015)

### The Shooting of Michael Brown

On August 9, 2014, Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed Black teenager. The subsequent protests brought national attention to policing practices—including the role of fines and fees.

### The DOJ Ferguson Report (March 2015)

The Department of Justice investigation revealed a systematic revenue extraction operation.

| Finding | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Revenue priority | "City's focus on revenue rather than public safety" |
| Warrant rate | 16,000 residents with outstanding warrants (population 21,000) |
| Fine revenue | 23% of city budget from fines/fees |
| Racial targeting | 67% Black population received 93% of arrests |
| Fee layering | Minor violations could generate $1,000+ in fees |
| Debtors' prison | Routine jailing for inability to pay |

### Ferguson Fine Example

| Violation | Initial Fine | After Failure to Appear |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------------|
| Manner of walking | $302 | $1,103 |
| High grass | $531 | $2,412 |
| Missing trash can lid | $206 | $1,858 |

### Key DOJ Findings

> "Ferguson's law enforcement practices are shaped by the City's focus on revenue rather than by public safety needs. This emphasis on revenue has compromised the institutional character of Ferguson's police department, contributing to a pattern of unconstitutional policing."

## Post-Ferguson Reform Era (2015-Present)

| 2015 | DOJ Ferguson report galvanizes reform movement |
