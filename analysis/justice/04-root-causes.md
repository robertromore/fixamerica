# Criminal Justice Reform: Root Causes

## Political Factors

### Tough-on-Crime Politics

**Electoral Incentives**:

- Politicians fear being labeled "soft on crime"
- One-way ratchet: always safer to be tougher
- Willie Horton effect
- Victims' families as political symbols
- No electoral reward for reducing incarceration

**Policy Consequences**:

- Mandatory minimums passed with little debate
- Parole abolished or restricted
- Three strikes laws
- Sex offender registries expanded
- No sunset provisions

### Federalization of Crime

**Growth**:

- 1970: ~3,000 federal crimes
- Today: ~5,000+ federal crimes
- Overlap with state jurisdiction
- Federal mandatory minimums
- Anti-Drug Abuse Acts

**Effects**:

- Forum shopping by prosecutors
- Harsher federal sentences
- Removal from communities
- Limited supervision/reentry support

### Lack of Political Voice

**Disenfranchised Populations**:

- Prisoners cannot vote
- Formerly incarcerated face barriers
- Jail populations (pretrial) cannot vote
- Poor political organization
- Communities with high incarceration marginalized

## Structural Factors

### Decentralized System

**Fragmentation**:

- 18,000+ police departments
- 3,000+ county prosecutors
- 50 state systems + federal
- No national standards
- No central accountability

**Consequences**:

- Inconsistent policies
- Reform requires jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction change
- Bad practices persist
- Good practices don't spread

### Prosecutor Power

**Unchecked Discretion**:

- Charging decisions unreviewable
- Plea bargaining control
- Sentencing recommendations
- Parole recommendations
- Immunity from suit

**Accountability Gaps**:

- Elected but low visibility
- Win rates as success metric
- No penalty for misconduct
- No tracking of outcomes

### Perverse Incentives

| Actor | Incentive | Effect |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Prosecutors | Conviction rates | Overcharging, plea pressure |
| Police | Arrest statistics | Focus on easy arrests |
| Private prisons | Occupancy rates | Lobby for incarceration |
| Counties | Cost-shifting | State prison vs. local alternatives |
| States | Federal funding | Truth in sentencing incentives |

### Bail System

**Wealth-Based Detention**:

- Bail set regardless of ability to pay
- Poor detained; wealthy released
- Pretrial detention drives pleas
- Commercial bail industry lobbies

## Economic Factors

### Poverty and Crime

**Connection**:

- Poverty correlates with crime rates
- Limited legitimate opportunities
- Concentrated disadvantage
- Stress and survival needs
- Youth involvement

**Not Excuse, But Context**:

- Crime concentrates in poor areas
- Incarceration perpetuates poverty
- Removal of working-age adults
- Intergenerational effects

### Prison Industrial Complex

**Economic Interests**:

- Private prisons: CoreCivic, GEO Group
- Prison services: phone, commissary, healthcare
- Construction companies
- Prison guard unions
- Rural communities dependent on prisons

**Lobbying**:

- Against sentencing reform
- For more beds
- For mandatory minimums
- For deportation detention

### Public Defense Underfunding

**Chronic Shortages**:

- No constitutional right to adequate funding
- Local funding competition with other services
- Caseloads 4-8x recommendations
- Burnout and turnover

**Consequences**:

- Inadequate representation
- Pressure to plead guilty
- Wrongful convictions
- Ineffective assistance claims fail

## Racial Factors

### Historical Continuity

**From Slavery to Mass Incarceration**:

- 13th Amendment exception
- Convict leasing
- Black Codes
- Jim Crow enforcement
- War on drugs

**Not Accidental**: System designed to control Black population.

### Structural Racism

**At Each Stage**:

| Stage | Disparity |
|-------|-----------|
| Surveillance | Over-policing of Black neighborhoods |
| Stops | 2-3x rates of stops for Black drivers |
| Arrests | 2-3x arrest rates for equivalent conduct |
| Charging | More serious charges for Black defendants |
| Bail | Higher bail for Black defendants |
| Conviction | Higher conviction rates |
| Sentencing | 20% longer sentences |
| Parole | Lower grant rates |

**Compounding**: Each disparity multiplies through system.

### Implicit Bias

**Research Findings**:

- Judges, prosecutors, jurors all show bias
- Even when controlling for legal factors
- Speed and stress increase bias
- Training has limited effect

## Cultural Factors

### Punitiveness

**American Exceptionalism**:

- More punitive than peer nations
- Retribution valued over rehabilitation
- Belief in individual responsibility over social causes
- Distrust of government "coddling"

**Media Influence**:

- Crime coverage disproportionate to actual crime
- Focus on violent crime
- Perpetrator-focused narratives
- Racial disparities in coverage

### Dehumanization

**"Criminals" as Other**:

- Language of evil, predator, monster
- Stripped of context
- Families invisible
- Redemption denied
- Permanent stigma

### Fear Politics

**Exploitation**:

- Crime waves exaggerated
- Stranger danger emphasized
- Fear of Black men specifically
- Suburbs vs. cities narrative

## Interconnections

### Reinforcing Cycles

```text
Poverty → Crime → Incarceration → Poverty
     ↑                              ↓
     ←──────── Family disruption ←──┘
```

### Compound Effects

- Racial bias + poverty = concentrated impact
- Tough politics + dehumanization = harsh policies
- Prosecutor power + no accountability = injustice
- Private prisons + lobbying = resistance to reform
