# Sentencing Reform: Current State

## Mandatory Minimums

### Federal Mandatory Minimums

**Drug Offenses**: The Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 established mandatory minimums based on drug quantity:

| Powder cocaine | 500 grams | 5 years |
| Crack cocaine | 280 grams | 10 years |

| Heroin | 100 grams | 5 years |
| Heroin | 1 kilogram | 10 years |
| Methamphetamine | 5 grams (pure) | 5 years |
| Methamphetamine | 50 grams (pure) | 10 years |
| Fentanyl | 40 grams | 5 years |
| Fentanyl | 400 grams | 10 years |

**Prior Convictions**: Mandatory minimums double or triple with prior drug felonies

**Firearms Offenses**:

| Offense | Mandatory Minimum |
|---------|-------------------|
| 18 U.S.C. 924(c) - using firearm in drug/violent crime (1st) | 5 years consecutive |

| 18 U.S.C. 924(c) - second conviction | 25 years consecutive |
| Armed Career Criminal (3 prior violent/drug) | 15 years |

**Federal Mandatory Minimum Usage**:

| Fiscal Year | Total Convictions | Mandatory Minimum Applied | Percentage |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------------------|------------|
| 2010 | 83,946 | 20,295 | 24.2% |
| 2015 | 71,003 | 14,798 | 20.8% |
| 2019 | 76,538 | 11,692 | 15.3% |
| 2022 | 64,183 | 9,847 | 15.3% |

### State Mandatory Minimums

**Drug Mandatory Minimums**: 40+ states have some form of drug mandatory minimums

| State | Example Mandatory Minimum |
|-------|--------------------------|
| New York | 3-8 years (A-I felony drug) |
| Florida | 3 years (trafficking 4-14g heroin) |
| Texas | 5 years (delivery 1-4g controlled substance) |
| California | Largely eliminated (post-Prop 47/57) |
| Michigan | Reformed 2000s; most mandatories repealed |

**Firearms Mandatory Minimums**: Most states have some mandatory minimums for firearm offenses

**Sexual Offense Mandatory Minimums**: Common across states, often 10+ years

### "Safety Valve" Exceptions

**Federal Safety Valve (18 U.S.C. 3553(f))**:

To qualify, defendant must:

1. Have no more than 1 criminal history point
2. Not use violence or weapons
3. Not cause death or serious injury
4. Not be a leader/organizer
5. Provide all information to government

**Usage**:

- ~23% of drug offenders qualify for safety valve
- First Step Act (2018) expanded eligibility
- Still excludes most with prior records

## Federal Sentencing Guidelines

### Structure

**Development**: Created by Sentencing Reform Act of 1984; mandatory until *Booker* (2005)

**Current Status**: Advisory; judges must consider but may vary

**Calculation**:

1. Determine Base Offense Level (1-43)
2. Apply Specific Offense Characteristics (+/-)
3. Apply Adjustments (role, obstruction, acceptance)
4. Calculate Criminal History Category (I-VI)
5. Find guideline range on Sentencing Table
6. Apply departures/variances if warranted

**Guideline Table** (Imprisonment Range in Months):

| Offense Level | Criminal History I | Criminal History II | Criminal History III | Criminal History VI |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| 10 | 6-12 | 8-14 | 10-16 | 15-21 |
| 20 | 33-41 | 41-51 | 46-57 | 63-78 |
| 30 | 97-121 | 108-135 | 121-151 | 151-188 |
| 40 | 292-365 | 324-405 | 360-life | 360-life |

### Post-*Booker* Sentencing

| Sentencing Pattern | 2005 | 2010 | 2015 | 2022 |
|--------------------|------|------|------|------|
| Within range | 62% | 56% | 49% | 45% |
| Below range (government motion) | 26% | 25% | 25% | 28% |
| Below range (other) | 12% | 17% | 22% | 24% |
| Above range | 1.6% | 2.0% | 2.1% | 2.9% |

**Variance Reasons**:

- Substantial assistance to government (~19%)
- Criminal history overrepresents seriousness (~4%)
- Mental health/diminished capacity (~2%)
- Collateral consequences (~1%)

## Truth-in-Sentencing

### Federal Truth-in-Sentencing

**Elimination of Parole**: Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 abolished federal parole

**Good Time Credit**: Limited to 54 days per year (approximately 15% reduction)

**Time Served**: Federal prisoners serve approximately 85% of sentence

### State Truth-in-Sentencing

**1994 Crime Bill Incentives**: Violent Offender Incarceration grants required:

- Violent offenders serve 85% of sentence
- OR demonstrate increase in time served

**Current State Policies**:

| Category | States |
|----------|--------|
| 85% for violent offenses | 29 states |
| 100% (no good time for violent) | 4 states |
| 65-75% minimum | 5 states |
| Variable/discretionary | 12 states |

**Impact on Time Served**:

| Pre-TIS Average | Post-TIS Average | Increase |
|-----------------|------------------|----------|
| 48% of sentence | 85%+ of sentence | +77% |

## Three Strikes and Habitual Offender Laws

### State Three Strikes Laws

**California** (1994-2012):

- Third strike: 25 years to life
- Strikes: any serious or violent felony
- 2012 Reform: Third strike must be serious/violent

**Washington** (first state, 1993):

- Third strike: Life without parole
- Strikes: "most serious offenses" only

**Other State Approaches**:

| State | Enhancement |
|-------|-------------|
| Texas | 25 years to life (3rd degree felony+) |
| Florida | Life (any felony as 3rd strike) |
| Georgia | Life without parole (2nd violent felony) |
| New York | Persistent felony offender (court discretion) |

### Federal Armed Career Criminal Act

**18 U.S.C. 924(e)**:

- Trigger: 3 prior violent felonies or serious drug offenses
- Mandatory: 15 years minimum (was 15 years to life)
- Many prior convictions that seem minor qualify

**Johnson v. United States (2015)**:

- Struck residual clause as unconstitutionally vague
- Reduced eligible prior offenses
- Retroactive relief granted

## Racial Disparities in Sentencing

### Federal Sentencing

**U.S. Sentencing Commission Data (2022)**:

| Comparison | Disparity |
|------------|-----------|
| Black male vs. white male (similar offense/history) | +19.1% longer |
| Hispanic male vs. white male | +5.3% longer |
| Black female vs. white female | +12.9% longer |

**Disparity Sources**:

| Factor | Black | White |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Charged with mandatory minimum | 38% | 26% |
| Receive safety valve | 16% | 29% |
| Receive substantial assistance | 23% | 30% |
| Charged above guideline minimum | More often | Less often |

### State Sentencing

**New Jersey** (2020 study):

- Black defendants: 12% longer sentences
- Disparities persist after controls

**Pennsylvania** (2019 study):

- Black defendants: 6-9% longer sentences
- Guideline departures favor white defendants

**Nationwide Patterns**:

- Disparities found in every studied jurisdiction
- Magnitude varies by state and offense type
- Unexplained after controlling for legal factors

### Drug Sentencing Disparities

**Crack/Powder Disparity**:

| Year | Crack:Powder Ratio |
|------|-------------------|
| 1986-2010 | 100:1 |
| 2010-present | 18:1 |
| Proposed | 1:1 |

**Impact**:

- ~80% of crack defendants are Black
- ~70% of powder defendants are white/Hispanic
- Disparity drove massive racial gap in drug sentences

## Sentence Lengths

| Total life sentences (state + federal) | ~200,000 |
| Life with parole | ~145,000 |
| Life without parole (LWOP) | ~55,000 |
| De facto life (50+ years) | ~45,000 |
| Virtual life (sentences > life expectancy) | Thousands more |

**LWOP Growth**:

| Year | LWOP Population |
|------|-----------------|
| 1992 | 12,453 |
| 2003 | 33,633 |
| 2012 | 49,081 |
| 2020 | 55,945 |

## Parole and Early Release

### Federal System

**No Parole**: Abolished in 1987; only limited good time available

**Compassionate Release**:

- Authorized for extraordinary circumstances
- Historically granted ~30/year
- First Step Act expanded; COVID surge to thousands

### State Parole Systems

| Category | States |
|----------|--------|
| Discretionary parole | 35+ |
| Abolished discretionary parole | 15+ |
| Mandatory supervised release | Most |

**Parole Grant Rates** (selected states):

| State | Grant Rate |
|-------|------------|
| Texas | ~35% |
| California | ~20% |
| New York | ~45% |
| Pennsylvania | ~15% |
| Georgia | Variable |

### Good Time and Earned Time

**Federal Good Time**: 54 days/year (approximately 15% reduction)

## Second Look and Sentence Review

### Existing Mechanisms

**Executive Clemency**:

- Compassionate release
- Limited court authority

**Retroactive Guideline Amendments**:

- Sentencing Commission can make amendments retroactive
- Crack amendments: ~7,000 sentence reductions
- Drugs minus 2: ~30,000 reductions

### Emerging Second Look Laws

**District of Columbia** (2021):

- Petition after 15 years (youth offenders)
- Petition after 20 years (all offenders)
- Court considers rehabilitation, age, public safety

**Illinois** (2023):

- Youth offenders: petition after 10 years
- All offenders: petition after 20 years

**Maryland, Louisiana, California**: Similar provisions enacted
