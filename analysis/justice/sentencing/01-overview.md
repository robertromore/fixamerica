# Sentencing Reform: Overview

## Executive Summary

American sentencing practices are among the harshest in the developed world, driving mass incarceration while failing to improve public safety. The shift from judicial discretion to mandatory minimums, truth-in-sentencing laws, and three-strikes provisions has produced sentences dramatically longer than other democracies, with stark racial disparities at every stage. Over 1.2 million people are currently serving sentences in state and federal prisons, many for terms that exceed what any evidence suggests is necessary for rehabilitation or public safety.

Sentencing reform requires dismantling the mandatory minimum regime, restoring judicial discretion, implementing second-look provisions for lengthy sentences, expanding earned time credits, and eliminating the policies that have eliminated parole in many jurisdictions. Evidence-based sentencing that considers individual circumstances rather than politically-driven mandatory terms is essential for both justice and fiscal responsibility.

### What This Subtopic Does Not Cover

- Bail and pretrial detention (see [Courts](../courts/01-overview.md))
- Prison conditions (see [Prisons](../prisons/01-overview.md))
- Prosecutorial discretion (see [Prosecutors](../prosecutors/01-overview.md))
- Juvenile sentencing (see [Juvenile Justice](../juvenile-justice/01-overview.md))
- Death penalty (see [Capital Punishment](../capital-punishment/01-overview.md))

## Key Questions

1. **Why are American sentences so long?** What policy choices drove sentence lengths far beyond international norms and what evidence supports such lengthy terms?

2. **Do mandatory minimums deter crime?** What does evidence say about the deterrent effect of mandatory sentences versus the certainty of punishment?

3. **Why do racial disparities persist?** What explains the consistent finding that Black and Latino defendants receive longer sentences than white defendants for similar offenses?

4. **Should judges have discretion?** What is the appropriate balance between consistency and individualized justice?

5. **What happens to people serving decades?** How do aging prisoners, recidivism data, and rehabilitation programs inform decisions about sentence length?

6. **How can excessively long sentences be revisited?** What mechanisms exist or should exist for resentencing those serving terms now recognized as unjust?

## Why This Matters

**Human Cost**: Over 200,000 people are serving sentences of 20+ years; ~55,000 are serving life without parole

**Fiscal Impact**: Incarceration costs ~$35,000-$60,000 per person annually; elderly prisoners cost 2-3x more

**Diminishing Returns**: Most crime reduction occurs in first years of incarceration; additional years add cost without benefit

**Racial Justice**: Black men receive sentences 19.1% longer than white men for similar offenses

**Families**: 2.7 million children have an incarcerated parent; lengthy sentences compound family destruction

**Reentry**: Longer sentences make reintegration harder; aging prisoners face employment and housing barriers

**International Standing**: U.S. sentences are outliers that draw international criticism
