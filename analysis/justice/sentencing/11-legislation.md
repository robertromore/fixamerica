# Sentencing Reform: Legislation

## Overview

Sentencing reform legislation operates at federal and state levels. Federal legislation can eliminate mandatory minimums, reform the sentencing guidelines, create second look provisions, and expand earned time credits. State legislation is essential because most incarcerated people are in state prisons under state sentencing laws. This document provides model legislation for comprehensive sentencing reform at both levels.

## Federal Legislation

### Sentencing Reform and Mandatory Minimum Elimination Act

**Purpose**: Eliminate federal mandatory minimum sentences and restore judicial discretion.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

Minimum Elimination Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that:
(1) Mandatory minimum sentences have not achieved their
stated deterrence goals.
(2) Mandatory minimum sentences have shifted power from
judges to prosecutors.
(3) Mandatory minimum sentences have contributed to racial
disparities in the federal criminal justice system.
(4) The United States has the highest incarceration rate
in the world, driven in part by mandatory minimums.
(5) Evidence shows that certainty of punishment deters
crime more effectively than severity.
(6) Eliminating mandatory minimums will restore
appropriate judicial discretion.

SEC. 3. ELIMINATION OF DRUG MANDATORY MINIMUMS.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 401(b) of the Controlled Substances
Act (21 U.S.C. 841(b)) is amended by striking the mandatory
minimum terms of imprisonment and replacing them with
maximum penalties without required minimums.

(b) PRIOR FELONY ENHANCEMENTS.—Section 851 of the
Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 851) is repealed.

Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 960(b)) is
amended consistent with subsection (a).

SEC. 4. REFORM OF FIREARMS MANDATORY MINIMUMS.

States Code, is amended—
(1) by striking "shall" each place it appears and
inserting "may";

consecutively; and
(4) by providing that courts may impose concurrent
sentences where justice requires.

18, United States Code, is amended by striking the 15-year
mandatory minimum and providing a maximum sentence of
15 years without a required minimum.

SEC. 5. SAFETY VALVE EXPANSION.

Section 3553(f) of title 18, United States Code, is amended
by striking paragraphs (1) through (5) and inserting:
"In the case of an offense under section 401, 404, or 406
of the Controlled Substances Act or section 1010 of the
Controlled Substances Import and Export Act, the court
may impose a sentence below the otherwise applicable
guideline range if the court finds that such sentence is
sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply
with the purposes set forth in paragraph (2)."

SEC. 6. RETROACTIVE APPLICATION.

(a) IN GENERAL.—The amendments made by this Act shall
apply to any offense committed before, on, or after the
date of enactment.

(b) RESENTENCING.—A defendant sentenced to a term of
imprisonment for an offense that was subject to a
mandatory minimum sentence eliminated by this Act may
file a motion for resentencing. Upon motion by the
defendant, the court shall conduct a resentencing
hearing and may reduce the sentence as if the mandatory
minimum had never existed.

Office of the United States Courts shall establish
procedures for expedited resentencing within 18 months

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Authority

**Federal Authority to Reform Sentencing**:

- Plenary power over federal criminal law
- Can modify any statutory sentence
- Can direct agency (DOJ, BOP) policies
- Spending Clause conditions on states (limited)

**Congressional Power**:

| Action | Authority |
|--------|-----------|
| Eliminate mandatory minimums | Direct statutory power |
| Create second look | Modify 18 U.S.C. Chapter 227 |
| Expand good time | Modify 18 U.S.C. § 3624 |
| Direct Sentencing Commission | 28 U.S.C. § 994 |

**State Authority**:

- Plenary power over state criminal law
- Can modify all state sentences
- May require constitutional amendment for some changes
- Subject to state constitutional constraints

### Constitutional Constraints

**Separation of Powers**:

- *Mistretta v. United States* (1989): Guidelines constitutional
- *United States v. Booker* (2005): Mandatory guidelines violate Sixth Amendment
- Second look provisions: Court review, not executive release

**Ex Post Facto**:

- Retroactive reduction of sentences: Constitutional (benefits defendant)
- Retroactive increase: Unconstitutional
- All proposed reforms reduce sentences retroactively: No ex post facto concern

**Due Process**:

- Resentencing must provide adequate process
- Right to counsel in resentencing
- Right to hearing on second look

### Eighth Amendment Considerations

**Proportionality**:

- *Solem v. Helm* (1983): Life without parole for minor offenses may violate Eighth Amendment
- *Graham v. Florida* (2010): Juvenile LWOP for non-homicide unconstitutional
- *Miller v. Alabama* (2012): Mandatory juvenile LWOP unconstitutional
- Potential for future challenges to excessive adult sentences

**Evolving Standards**:

- International norms: LWOP rare globally
- Growing consensus: Excessive sentences disproportionate
- Potential for future Eighth Amendment challenges to lengthy sentences

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Sentencing Reform and Mandatory Minimum Elimination Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Prosecutorial charging to other statutes | Prosecutors may charge different statutes with high maximums | High |
| Guideline anchoring | Guidelines may still produce long sentences without mandatories | High |
| Cooperation-dependent relief | Substantial assistance may remain primary reduction mechanism | Medium |
| State prosecution shift | Federal declinations lead to state prosecution with mandatories | Medium |
| DOJ policy reversal | Future administrations may reverse charging policies | High |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Guideline sentences still high | Average sentences remain longer than necessary | Guidelines designed during tough-on-crime era |
| Resentencing backlogs | Courts may lack capacity for resentencing | Insufficient resources |
| Only addresses federal system | ~90% of prisoners in state facilities | Federal jurisdiction limits |
| Political vulnerability | Reforms can be reversed | Electoral politics |
| Prosecutorial culture | Policies may not change practice | Institutional resistance |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Companion guideline reform**: Require Sentencing Commission to reduce guidelines concurrent with mandatory minimum elimination.

2. **Statutory maximums reduction**: Lower statutory maximums to prevent circumvention through high-maximum charges.

3. **Resentencing funding**: Appropriate dedicated funding for federal defender resentencing units and court resources.

4. **Structural DOJ reform**: Codify charging policies in statute rather than relying on Attorney General memos.

5. **Monitoring and reporting**: Require annual reports on charging patterns to identify circumvention.

### Federal Second Look Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Prosecutor opposition | Government opposition may deter grants | High |
| Victim veto | Victim opposition may become de facto veto | Medium |
| Inadequate counsel | Poor representation undermines petitions | High |
| Risk assessment bias | Risk tools may perpetuate racial bias | Medium |
| Judicial resistance | Judges may rarely grant relief | High |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Only federal prisoners | State prisoners not covered | Federalism |
| 10-year minimum | Excludes those with shorter but excessive sentences | Political compromise |
| Resource constraints | Courts overwhelmed by petitions | Implementation capacity |
| No mandatory resentencing | Relies on judicial discretion | Separation of powers |
| Victim notification burden | May delay or complicate proceedings | Procedural requirements |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Prosecutorial standards**: Require government to articulate specific basis for opposition; prohibit blanket opposition policies.

2. **Victim input guidelines**: Clarify that victim input is one factor but cannot be sole basis for denial.

3. **Counsel funding**: Appropriate dedicated funding for second look representation.

4. **Risk tool limitations**: Prohibit reliance on risk assessments as primary factor; require individualized assessment.

5. **Judicial training**: Require training on second look criteria and evidence about aging and rehabilitation.

6. **Presumptive grant after 20 years**: Strengthen presumption language to ensure meaningful review.

### State Model Legislation

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Carve-outs for "violent" offenses | Broad definitions exclude most long-serving prisoners | High |
| Prosecutor veto on resentencing | Required agreement may rarely be given | High |
| Inadequate state defender funding | Cannot handle resentencing volume | High |
| Local variation | Implementation varies by county | Medium |
| Parole board discretion | Low grant rates despite eligibility | High |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| State-by-state adoption | Reform requires 50 campaigns | Federalism |
| Truth-in-sentencing federal incentives | May lose federal funds for reform | 1994 Crime Bill legacy |
| State constitutional constraints | Some reforms require amendments | State constitutions |
| Elected prosecutors and judges | Political pressure against reform | Electoral accountability |
| Rural incarceration economics | Prison-town opposition | Economic dependence |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. **Eliminate "violent offense" carve-outs**: Apply reforms universally or define "violent" narrowly.

2. **Independent resentencing**: Create resentencing courts or commissions not dependent on local prosecutors.

3. **State defender funding mandates**: Tie reform to adequate defender appropriations.

4. **Parole board reform**: Require professional, not political, appointees; establish grant rate minimums.

5. **Federal incentives**: Create federal grants for states that reform sentencing (replace 1994 incentives).

6. **Community investment**: Invest savings in prison-dependent communities to reduce opposition.

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Issue | Proposed Solution |
|-------|-------------------|
| Political backlash | Build bipartisan coalitions; emphasize fiscal responsibility |
| Crime rate fluctuations | Decouple reform from short-term crime trends; focus on evidence |
| Recidivism by released individuals | Invest in reentry; accept that some risk is inherent |
| Victim opposition | Partner with reform-minded victim groups; provide services |
| Racial disparity in implementation | Monitor implementation for disparate impact; require reporting |
| Capacity for programming | Expand prison programming as prerequisite to earned time |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

1. **Data collection requirement**: All legislation should require collection and publication of implementation data.

2. **Disparity monitoring**: Require annual reports on racial, geographic, and other disparities in implementation.

3. **5-year evaluation**: Mandate GAO or independent evaluation of reform effects.

4. **Continuous improvement**: Empower implementing agencies to refine procedures based on experience.

5. **Anti-backsliding provisions**: Require supermajority to reverse reforms; automatic restoration after any suspension.
