## Arguments Against Reform

### Public Safety Arguments

**Claims Made**:

| Claim | Counter-Evidence |
|-------|-----------------|
| "Crime will increase" | States with reform have not seen consistent increases |
| "Dangerous people released" | Most released are low-level offenders |
| "Deterrence requires harsh sentences" | Research shows certainty > severity |
| "Incapacitation works" | Diminishing returns after initial years |
| "Recidivism inevitable" | Recidivism decreases with age, programming |

**Evidence Gaps**:

- Little evidence mandatory minimums deter more than certain punishment
- No evidence U.S. sentences need to be longer than Europe
- Significant evidence of diminishing public safety returns

### Consistency and Fairness Arguments

**Claims Made**:

| Claim | Counter-Evidence |
|-------|-----------------|
| "Guidelines ensure consistency" | Racial disparities persist within guidelines |
| "Mandatories treat everyone equally" | Prosecutorial discretion creates disparity |
| "Discretion leads to bias" | Mandatory systems shift bias to charging |
| "Victims treated equally" | Depends on prosecutor's choices |

### Victim Justice Arguments

**Claims Made**:

| Claim | Counter-Evidence |
|-------|-----------------|
| "Victims need harsh sentences" | Many victims support alternatives |
| "Reducing sentences re-traumatizes" | Many victims support reform |
| "Justice = long incarceration" | Restorative justice serves many victims better |
| "Victims want maximum" | Depends on individual; often not true |

## Co-optation and Weakening

### Watering Down Reforms

**Common Patterns**:

| Reform Proposed | Weakened Version |
|-----------------|------------------|
| Eliminate mandatory minimums | Reduce but retain |
| Retroactive application | Prospective only |
| Universal earned time | Exclude "violent" offenses |
| Second look after 15 years | After 25 years |
| Judicial discretion | Safety valve with strict requirements |

### Carve-Outs

**Common Exclusions from Reform**:

| Exclusion | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| "Violent offenses" | Excludes majority of long sentences |
| "Sex offenses" | Excludes all sex offense convictions |
| "Prior violent history" | Excludes those with any prior |
| "Firearms involved" | Excludes broad category |
| "Gang-related" | Subjective, often racial |

**Result**: Reform applies to ever-smaller population

### Backlash Legislation

**Cycle**:

1. Reform passes
2. High-profile crime (often unrelated to reform)
3. Blame assigned to reform
4. New tough-on-crime legislation proposed
5. Reform reversed or weakened

**Examples**:

| Jurisdiction | Reform | Backlash |
|--------------|--------|----------|
| California (Prop 47) | Reduced theft penalties | Prop 20 attempt (failed) |
| New York (bail reform) | Reduced cash bail | Multiple rollbacks |
| Federal (First Step Act) | Modest reform | "STOP Act" proposals |
