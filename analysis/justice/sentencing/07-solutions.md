# Sentencing Reform: Solutions

## Eliminate Mandatory Minimums

### Federal Mandatory Minimum Reform

**Complete Elimination**:

| Current Mandatory | Proposed |
|-------------------|----------|
| Drug quantity-based minimums | Eliminate; advisory guidelines only |
| 924(c) stacking | Eliminate consecutive requirements |
| Prior felony enhancements | Eliminate mandatory doubling |
| Armed Career Criminal | Eliminate 15-year mandatory |

**Benefits**:

- Restores judicial discretion
- Reduces racial disparities in charging
- Allows consideration of individual circumstances
- Reduces prosecutorial leverage for unjust pleas
- Brings U.S. in line with international norms

**Implementation**:

1. Pass legislation repealing mandatory minimums
2. Make repeal retroactive to all current prisoners
3. Provide expedited resentencing process
4. Fund public defender capacity for resentencing

### State Mandatory Minimum Reform

**Model Approach**:

| Current | Reformed |
|---------|----------|
| Drug quantity mandatories | Eliminate |
| Firearms enhancement mandatories | Convert to presumptive |
| Sexual offense mandatories | Case-by-case judicial discretion |
| Three strikes mandatories | Eliminate automatic; judicial discretion |

**States Leading**:

| State | Reform |
|-------|--------|
| California | Prop 47, 57 reduced many mandatories |
| Michigan | Repealed 650-lifer and most drug mandatories |
| New York | Reformed Rockefeller laws |
| New Jersey | Eliminated many drug mandatories |

### Safety Valve Expansion (Interim)

**Current Federal Safety Valve Requirements**:

| Requirement | Reform |
|-------------|--------|
| 1 criminal history point | Expand to 4+ points |
| No violence | Remove |
| No weapons | Remove or narrow |
| Not leader/organizer | Remove or narrow |
| Provide information | Remove (cooperation not required) |

**Expanded Safety Valve Benefits**:

- More defendants escape mandatory minimum
- Reduces racial disparity (Black defendants less likely to qualify)
- Gives judges flexibility for deserving cases
- Interim step toward elimination

## Restore Judicial Discretion

### Advisory Guidelines with Meaningful Discretion

**Current System**:

- Guidelines advisory but still anchor sentences
- ~45% within range; ~25% below (government); ~24% below (judge)
- Judges must justify variances

**Proposed Reforms**:

| Current | Reformed |
|---------|----------|
| Presumptive guideline calculation | Starting point only |
| Variance requires justification | Encourage individualization |
| Government controls substantial assistance | Judge can reduce without motion |
| Criminal history heavily weighted | Reduce criminal history impact |

**Judicial Training**:

- Train judges on evidence about rehabilitation
- Educate on diminishing returns of long sentences
- Provide data on recidivism by age
- Encourage consideration of reentry challenges

### Limit Criminal History Impact

**Problem**: Criminal history category doubles or triples sentences

| Criminal History Category | Guideline Effect |
|---------------------------|------------------|
| I (0-1 points) | Baseline |
| II (2-3 points) | +20-30% |
| III (4-6 points) | +40-50% |
| IV (7-9 points) | +60-80% |
| V (10-12 points) | +80-100% |
| VI (13+ points) | +100-150% |

**Proposed Reform**:

- Cap criminal history impact at +50%
- Exclude old convictions (10+ years)
- Exclude non-violent priors
- Consider rehabilitation since prior offense

### Sentencing Alternatives

**Expanded Non-Incarceration Options**:

| Alternative | Appropriate For |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Probation | Most non-violent first offenses |
| Drug court | Drug-involved offenses |
| Mental health court | Mental health-related offenses |
| Veterans court | Veterans |
| Community service | Low-level offenses |
| Restorative justice | Victim-focused accountability |
| Home confinement | Low flight/safety risk |

**Presumption of Alternatives**:

- Non-violent first offenses: presumption against incarceration
- Drug possession: presumption of treatment
- Property offenses: presumption of restitution-focused alternatives

## Second Look Sentencing

### Concept

**Second Look**: Provide mechanism to review and potentially reduce sentences after a period of incarceration

**Rationale**:

- People change; 20-year-old offender is different at 40
- Evidence shows recidivism declines sharply with age
- Sentences imposed in different era may be unjust
- Allows for demonstrated rehabilitation
- Reduces cost of elderly incarceration

### Model Federal Second Look

**Eligibility**:

| Time Served | Eligibility |
|-------------|-------------|
| 10 years | All prisoners |
| 15 years | Presumptive review |
| 20 years | Presumptive release |

**Criteria for Review**:

| Factor | Consideration |
|--------|---------------|
| Age at offense | Youth as mitigating |
| Current age | Recidivism declines with age |
| Disciplinary record | Conduct in prison |
| Programming | Education, treatment, work |
| Release plan | Housing, employment, support |
| Risk assessment | Validated instruments |
| Victim input | Considered but not dispositive |

**Process**:

1. Prisoner files petition after eligibility date
2. Court reviews record and submissions
3. Hearing with representation
4. Court may reduce, maintain, or set later review
5. Appeal available

### State Second Look Examples

**District of Columbia**:

| Provision | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Youth eligibility | 15 years served (offense under 25) |
| Adult eligibility | 20 years served |
| Decision maker | Original sentencing court |
| Standard | Interest of justice |

**Illinois**:

| Provision | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Youth eligibility | 10 years |
| Other eligibility | 20 years |
| Standard | Rehabilitation and changed circumstances |

## Earned Time and Good Time Reform

### Expand Earned Time Credits

**Current Federal System**:

| Credit Type | Amount |
|-------------|--------|
| Good conduct time | 54 days/year (~15%) |
| First Step Act credits | Up to 365 days (limited eligibility) |

**Proposed Expansion**:

| Credit Type | Proposed Amount |
|-------------|-----------------|
| Good conduct | 1 day for 1 day served (50%) |
| Programming completion | Additional 30 days/program |
| Education (GED) | 90 days |
| Education (college degree) | 180 days |
| Vocational training | 60 days |
| Drug treatment completion | 90 days |
| Work assignment | 1 day per 30 days worked |

**Eliminate Exclusions**:

- Current law excludes many offenses from earning time
- Exclusions are arbitrary and reduce rehabilitation incentive
- All prisoners should be able to earn time

### State Earned Time Models

**Texas**:

| Category | Credit |
|----------|--------|
| Non-violent, no prior | Day for day |
| Violent, no prior | 1 day per 2 |
| Prior violent | 1 day per 3 |

**California**:

| Category | Credit |
|----------|--------|
| Non-violent | Up to 50% reduction |
| Violent | Limited (1 day per 3-4) |
| Post-Prop 57 | Enhanced earning possible |

**Connecticut**:

- Earned risk reduction credits
- Reduces sentence and parole supervision
- Based on programming and conduct

## Parole and Release Reform

### Restore Parole Eligibility

**Federal System**:

| Current | Proposed |
|---------|----------|
| No parole (post-1987 offenses) | Restore parole after 10 years |
| Supervised release after term | Parole as alternative |

**State Systems**:

| Current Pattern | Proposed |
|-----------------|----------|
| No parole (15 states) | Restore discretionary parole |
| Limited parole (many states) | Expand eligibility |
| Parole with TIS restrictions | Reduce 85% requirement |

### Evidence-Based Parole Decisions

**Current Problems**:

- Parole often denied for political/victim pressure
- Low grant rates even for rehabilitated prisoners
- Lack of clear standards
- Inadequate representation at hearings

**Proposed Reforms**:

| Current | Reformed |
|---------|----------|
| Political appointees | Professional board members |
| Victim veto | Victim input without veto |
| No representation | Right to counsel |
| Vague standards | Clear criteria |
| "Not enough time served" | Focus on rehabilitation and risk |

### Parole Grant Standards

**Presumptive Parole**:

- After minimum served, presumption of release
- Burden on government to show specific risk
- Denial must cite specific, articulable risk

**Risk Assessment**:

| Factor | Weight |
|--------|--------|
| Age | Strong (older = lower risk) |
| Time served | Diminishing returns on more time |
| Disciplinary record | Moderate |
| Release plan | Significant |
| Static risk scores | Limited (bias concerns) |
| Dynamic factors | Prioritize rehabilitation evidence |

## Eliminate Crack/Powder Disparity

### Current Disparity

| Substance | 5-Year Trigger | 10-Year Trigger |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|
| Crack cocaine | 28 grams | 280 grams |
| Powder cocaine | 500 grams | 5 kilograms |
| Ratio | 18:1 | 18:1 |

### EQUAL Act Proposal

**Key Provisions**:

- Eliminate disparity (1:1 ratio)
- Apply retroactively
- Expedited resentencing process

**Impact**:

| Population | Effect |
|------------|--------|
| Federal crack prisoners | ~2,500 eligible for reduction |
| Average reduction | 5+ years |
| Racial impact | Primarily benefits Black defendants |

## Reduce Sentence Lengths Generally

### Evidence-Based Sentencing

**Research Findings**:

| Finding | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Recidivism peaks at 1-2 years, declines after | Short sentences may suffice |
| Recidivism declines sharply with age | Long sentences for young unnecessary |
| Incapacitation has diminishing returns | Keeping aging prisoners costs > benefit |
| Certainty deters more than severity | Focus on apprehension, not length |

**Proposed Sentence Maxima**:

| Offense Category | Proposed Maximum |
|------------------|------------------|
| Non-violent first offense | 3 years |
| Non-violent property | 5 years |
| Drug trafficking (without violence) | 10 years |
| Serious violent offense | 20 years |
| Murder | 30 years (with parole after 15) |

### Abolish Life Without Parole

**Current LWOP Population**: ~55,000

**Proposed Alternative**:

| Current | Reformed |
|---------|----------|
| LWOP | Life with parole eligibility after 20-25 years |
| De facto life (50+ years) | Parole eligibility after 25 years |

**Rationale**:

- No one beyond redemption
- Age reduces risk dramatically
- Cost of elderly incarceration unsustainable
- International human rights concerns

## Implementation Support

**Federal**:

- Fund federal defender resentencing units
- Create expedited resentencing docket
- Train judges on resentencing standards

**State**:

- Fund state public defender resentencing capacity

|------------|---------|
| Housing assistance | Prevent homelessness |
| Employment programs | Reduce recidivism |
| Mental health treatment | Address underlying issues |
| Substance abuse treatment | Continue recovery |
| Family reunification | Rebuild support networks |
