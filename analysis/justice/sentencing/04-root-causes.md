# Sentencing Reform: Root Causes

## Political Incentives

### Electoral Politics

**Tough-on-Crime Electoral Dynamics**:

| Factor | Mechanism |
|--------|-----------|
| Asymmetric risk | Punished for crime on watch; rarely rewarded for reducing incarceration |
| Media coverage | Violent crimes receive disproportionate coverage |
| Victim visibility | Victims of crime visible; victims of over-incarceration invisible |
| Opponent attacks | "Soft on crime" effective attack |
| Public fear | Fear exploitable; facts about risk not salient |

**Campaign Examples**:

- 1988: Willie Horton ad devastates Dukakis
- 1992: Clinton leaves campaign to oversee execution
- 1994: Both parties compete on crime bill
- 2016-2020: Candidates avoid reform positions

### Legislatures and Mandatory Minimums

**Why Legislatures Pass Mandatory Minimums**:

1. **Visibility**: Show "doing something" about crime
2. **Simplicity**: Easy to explain (10 years for X)
3. **Durability**: Hard to repeal later
4. **No tradeoff**: Costs hidden in prison budgets
5. **Symbolic politics**: Express moral condemnation

**Ratchet Effect**:

| Pressure | Response |
|----------|----------|
| High-profile crime | Increase mandatory minimum |
| Prison overcrowding | Build more prisons |
| Crime drops | Credit tough laws |
| Crime rises | Need tougher laws |

**Never a Pressure For**:

- Reducing sentences
- Examining effectiveness
- Counting costs per conviction

### District Attorney Elections

**Prosecution Elections**:

- ~95% of prosecutors elected
- Campaigns emphasize conviction rates
- Long sentences prove "toughness"
- Plea deals still harsh to avoid "leniency"

**Win-Rate Culture**:

| Metric | Effect on Sentencing |
|--------|---------------------|
| Conviction rate | Overcharge to secure pleas |
| Trial win rate | Only try cases with harsh sentences |
| Sentence length | Advertise long sentences obtained |
| Victim satisfaction | Promise maximum penalties |

## Prosecutorial Power

### Charge Stacking

**Mechanism**: File multiple charges; use as plea leverage

**Example (Bank Robbery)**:

| Charge | Potential Sentence |
|--------|-------------------|
| Bank robbery (§2113) | 0-20 years |
| Armed bank robbery | 0-25 years |
| 924(c)(1) - firearm | 5-7 years consecutive |
| Second 924(c) | 25 years consecutive |
| Conspiracy | 0-20 years |
| **Total exposure** | **50-97 years** |
| **Plea offer** | **15-20 years** |

**Defendant Calculation**:

- Risk of trial: 50+ years
- Plea offer: 15-20 years
- Rational choice: Plead guilty

### Mandatory Minimum Leverage

**Prosecutors Control**:

- Whether to charge mandatory minimum offense
- What quantity to attribute (drugs)
- Whether to file prior felony information (doubles/triples minimum)
- Whether to offer safety valve eligibility

**Data on Charging Decisions**:

| Factor | Likelihood of Mandatory Minimum Charge |
|--------|---------------------------------------|
| Black defendant | Higher |
| Hispanic defendant | Higher |
| Non-citizen | Higher |
| Post-trial (vs. plea) | Higher |
| More serious role | Higher |
| Federal vs. state referral | Varies by district |

### Substantial Assistance

**The Only Escape**: Providing "substantial assistance" to government

**Requirements**:

- Information leading to other prosecutions
- Testimony against co-defendants
- Government motion required (5K1.1)

**Who Benefits**:

| Defendant Type | Substantial Assistance Rate |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| Kingpins (have information) | Higher |
| Street-level (no information) | Lower |
| First-time offenders | Lower |
| White defendants | Higher |
| Black defendants | Lower |

**Result**: Most culpable get biggest breaks; least culpable serve longest

## Judicial Constraints

### Loss of Discretion

**Pre-Guidelines Judicial Power**:

- Impose any sentence within statutory range
- Consider all circumstances
- Parole would adjust actual time
- Significant individualization

**Post-Mandatory Minimum Judicial Power**:

| Situation | Judicial Options |
|-----------|------------------|
| Mandatory minimum applies | Must impose minimum (absent safety valve/assistance) |
| Guidelines apply | Must calculate; may vary if justified |
| Stacking provisions | Must run consecutive |
| Prior felony filed | Must impose enhanced minimum |

**Judicial Frustration**: Many judges publicly criticize mandatory minimums

- Justice Kennedy testimony to Congress
- Judge Gleeson writings
- Judge Block opinions
- Resignations over sentencing

### Guidelines as Floor

**Original Intent**: Guidelines as ceiling and floor

**Actual Practice**: Guidelines became floor

| Pattern | Frequency |
|---------|-----------|
| Sentence within range | ~45% |
| Below range (government motion) | ~28% |
| Below range (judge variance) | ~24% |
| Above range | ~3% |

**Government Control**: ~72% of below-range sentences require government agreement

## Structural Racism

### Historical Legacy

**Racial Control as Sentencing Origin**:

| Era | Mechanism |
|-----|-----------|
| Slavery | Criminal punishment for slaves; none for owners |
| Black Codes | Criminalize Black behavior; convict leasing |
| Jim Crow | Racial terror through criminal law |
| War on Drugs | Targeting Black communities |
| Mass incarceration | Disproportionate impact |

**Michelle Alexander** - *The New Jim Crow*:

- Drug war deliberately targeted Black communities
- Sentencing disparities not accidental
- System functions to control Black population

### Crack/Powder Disparity

**Creation of Disparity**:

- 1986: No scientific basis for 100:1 ratio
- Crack associated with Black users
- Powder associated with white users
- Congress never studied effects

**Impact**:

| Measure | Crack | Powder |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Defendants Black | 80%+ | ~25% |
| Defendants White | ~5% | ~30% |
| Average sentence | Higher | Lower |
| Quantity for 5-year min (1986-2010) | 5 grams | 500 grams |

### Implicit Bias in Discretion

**Where Bias Enters**:

| Decision Point | Who Decides | Bias Research |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|
| Arrest | Police | Documented bias |
| Charging | Prosecutor | Less studied; bias likely |
| Bail | Judge/algorithm | Documented bias |
| Plea offer | Prosecutor | Documented bias |
| Guideline calculation | Probation/court | Some bias |
| Variance decision | Judge | Documented bias |
| Parole decision | Board | Documented bias |

**Cumulative Effect**: Small biases compound at each stage

## Media and Public Fear

### Crime Coverage

**Media Distortion**:

| Measure | Reality | Coverage |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Violent crime (% of crime) | ~10% | ~50% of coverage |
| Murder (% of crime) | 0.1% | ~25% of coverage |
| Crime trend (1990-2020) | -50%+ decline | Minimal coverage |
| Risk of victimization | Low | Portrayed as high |

**Local News Formula**: "If it bleeds, it leads"

### Public Perception vs. Reality

**Gap Between Perception and Reality**:

| Question | Public Belief | Reality |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| Is crime rising? | Usually "yes" | Usually no (until 2020s) |
| Are sentences too lenient? | Majority "yes" | U.S. sentences highest |
| Does incarceration prevent crime? | Majority "yes" | Diminishing returns |
| Should sentences be harsher? | Varies | Until given alternatives |

**When Given Options**:

- Public prefers rehabilitation to incarceration
- Supports alternatives for non-violent offenses
- Prefers treatment over prison for drugs
- Values redemption and second chances

### Victim Advocacy and Victim Politics

**Victim Rights Movement**:

- Legitimate grievances about being ignored
- Co-opted for punitive agenda
- "Victims" often means politically selected victims
- Survivors who favor mercy excluded

**Prosecutorial Framing**:

| Frame | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| "Speaking for victims" | Justifies harsh sentence |
| "Justice for victim" | Equates with long sentence |
| "Victim impact statements" | Emphasize harm; support punishment |
| "Victim's family" | Rarely includes those favoring mercy |

## Prison Industrial Complex

### Financial Interests

**Private Prisons**:

- ~8% of prisoners in private facilities
- Lobbying for tough sentencing
- Contracts require minimum occupancy
- GEO Group, CoreCivic political spending

**Prison-Town Economics**:

- Rural communities depend on prisons
- Oppose closure despite overcapacity
- Political representatives protect facilities
- Union interests (guards)

**Related Industries**:

| Industry | Interest in Incarceration |
|----------|--------------------------|
| Prison phone companies | Captive market |
| Prison commissary | Captive market |
| Prison construction | Building contracts |
| Prison healthcare | Contracts |
| Prison food service | Contracts |
| Bail industry | Pretrial incarceration |
| Electronic monitoring | Alternative but costly |

### Correctional Officer Unions

**Political Power**:

- California Correctional Peace Officers Association
- Major political spending
- Opposed sentencing reform
- Supported three strikes

**Organizational Interest**:

| Union Interest | Policy Implication |
|----------------|-------------------|
| More jobs | More incarceration |
| Higher pay | Larger prison budgets |
| Job security | Oppose alternatives |
| Political power | Support tough-on-crime candidates |

## Institutional Inertia

### Path Dependence

**Hard to Reverse**:

| Policy | Why Hard to Change |
|--------|-------------------|
| Mandatory minimums | Must actively vote to "reduce" sentences |
| Truth-in-sentencing | Seen as "releasing criminals early" |
| Three strikes | Politically radioactive |
| Guidelines | Institutional investment (Commission, training) |
| Parole abolition | Would require rebuilding parole systems |

### Bureaucratic Interests

**Institutional Stakeholders**:

| Institution | Interest in Status Quo |
|-------------|----------------------|
| U.S. Sentencing Commission | Guidelines system continuation |
| Bureau of Prisons | Budget tied to population |
| DOJ | Prosecution tools |
| State corrections | Existing infrastructure |
| Probation offices | Calculation system |

### Lack of Feedback Loops

**No Accountability for Bad Sentences**:

| Outcome | Feedback? |
|---------|-----------|
| Sentenced person reoffends | "Should have been longer" |
| Sentenced person rehabilitates | No one tracks |
| Sentence costs $1M+ | No one calculates |
| Family destroyed | Not measured |
| Community harm | Not considered |
| Excessive sentence recognized | No mechanism to fix |
