# Sentencing Reform: History

## The Era of Indeterminate Sentencing (Pre-1970s)

### Rehabilitation Model

**Philosophy**: Sentences should be individualized to rehabilitate offenders

**Key Features**:

- Broad statutory ranges (e.g., 1-20 years)
- Judges imposed sentences within ranges
- Parole boards determined actual release
- Focus on "treating" criminal behavior
- Prison programs designed for reform

**Example (Pre-1970s Robbery Sentence)**:

| Component | How It Worked |
|-----------|---------------|
| Statute | 1-25 years |
| Judge's sentence | 5-15 years |
| Minimum eligible for parole | 5 years |
| Actual release | When parole board decided |
| Typical time served | 3-7 years |

### Discretionary System

**Advantages Claimed**:

- Individualized justice
- Flexibility for circumstances
- Incentive for rehabilitation
- Parole supervision upon release

**Criticisms That Emerged**:

- Arbitrary: Similar cases, different outcomes
- Discriminatory: Racial and class bias in decisions
- Unpredictable: Defendants didn't know actual time
- Unreviewable: No standards for decisions

## Critique from Left and Right (1960s-1970s)

### Liberal Critique

**Judge Marvin Frankel** - *Criminal Sentences: Law Without Order* (1973):

- Documented wild disparities in sentences
- Called sentencing "lawless"
- Proposed sentencing commission and guidelines
- Aimed to reduce discretion and bias

**Civil Rights Concerns**:

- Black defendants received longer sentences
- Poor defendants treated more harshly
- Parole decisions arbitrary
- Prison rehabilitation programs ineffective

**American Friends Service Committee** (1971):

- Called for determinate sentencing
- Abolish parole (as deceptive)
- Make sentences transparent

### Conservative Critique

**James Q. Wilson** and others:

- Rehabilitation doesn't work ("nothing works")
- Criminals not being punished enough
- Parole releasing dangerous offenders
- Need certain, severe punishment

**Victims' Rights Movement**:

- Sentences too lenient
- Parole traumatizing for victims
- Need to "get tough" on crime

### Strange Bedfellows

**Convergence**:

| Liberal Goal | Conservative Goal | Shared Mechanism |
|--------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Reduce disparity | Increase punishment | Mandatory minimums |
| Eliminate parole discretion | Keep offenders locked up | Truth-in-sentencing |
| Limit judge discretion | Ensure harsh sentences | Sentencing guidelines |

## The Determinate Sentencing Revolution (1975-1990)

### Early State Reforms

**Maine (1976)**: First state to abolish parole

**California (1977)**: Determinate Sentencing Law

- Abolished parole release discretion
- Set fixed terms for offenses
- Good time credits predictable
- Dramatically increased sentences

**Other Early Adopters**:

| State | Year | Key Feature |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Indiana | 1977 | Fixed sentences, limited parole |
| Illinois | 1978 | Determinate sentences |
| Minnesota | 1980 | Sentencing guidelines |
| Washington | 1984 | Sentencing Reform Act |

### Federal Sentencing Reform Act of 1984

**Key Provisions**:

- Created U.S. Sentencing Commission
- Mandated sentencing guidelines
- Abolished federal parole
- Limited good time to 54 days/year
- Made guidelines mandatory

**Goals**:

1. Honesty in sentencing (serve what's imposed)
2. Uniformity (similar cases, similar sentences)
3. Proportionality (serious crimes, serious time)

**Unintended Consequences**:

- Massive increase in federal sentences
- Shift of power from judges to prosecutors
- Guidelines became floor, not ceiling

### Federal Sentencing Guidelines (1987)

**Implementation**:

- 43 offense levels
- 6 criminal history categories
- Complex calculation system
- Initially binding on judges

**Effect on Sentence Length**:

| Offense | Pre-Guidelines | Post-Guidelines |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| Drug trafficking | 24 months | 72 months |
| Fraud | 12 months | 18 months |
| Immigration | 6 months | 18 months |
| Robbery | 60 months | 90 months |

## The Mandatory Minimum Era (1984-2000)

### Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986

**Context**: Len Bias death (cocaine), crack panic

**Provisions**:

- 5-year minimum for 5g crack, 500g powder
- 10-year minimum for 50g crack, 5kg powder
- 100:1 crack/powder disparity

**Legislative Process**:

- Passed in election-year rush
- No hearings on quantity thresholds
- Quantities allegedly chosen arbitrarily
- Democrats and Republicans competing to be tougher

### Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988

**Additions**:

- Mandatory life for drug "kingpins"
- Death penalty for drug-related killings
- 5-year minimum for simple crack possession

### Firearms Mandatory Minimums

**18 U.S.C. 924(c)**:

| Year | Minimum |
|------|---------|
| 1968 | 1 year (additional) |
| 1984 | 5 years |
| 1986 | 5/7/10 years (possess/brandish/discharge) |
| 1998 | 25 years (second offense) |

**"Stacking"**: Multiple 924(c) counts run consecutively

- Example: 3 bank robberies with gun = 5 + 25 + 25 = 55 years mandatory

### State Mandatory Minimums

**New York Rockefeller Laws (1973)**:

- Life sentence for drug possession
- Partially reformed 2004-2009

**Michigan 650-Lifer Law (1978)**:

- Life without parole for 650g+ cocaine/heroin
- Repealed 1998

**State Proliferation**:

| Period | States with Drug Mandatories |
|--------|------------------------------|
| 1970 | ~5 |
| 1980 | ~15 |
| 1990 | ~40 |
| 2000 | ~45 |

## Three Strikes and Habitual Offender Laws (1990s)

### Washington State (1993)

**Initiative 593**: First three strikes law

- Life without parole for third "most serious offense"
- Passed by voter initiative
- Became model for other states

### California Proposition 184 (1994)

**"Three Strikes and You're Out"**:

- 25 years to life for any third felony
- Doubled sentence for second strike
- Any felony could be third strike

**Polly Klaas Case**: 12-year-old murdered by repeat offender

**Consequences**:

- Applied to non-violent offenses
- Cases like 25-life for pizza theft
- Largest prison population increase in history
- Reformed in 2012 (Prop 36)

### Federal Three Strikes (1994 Crime Bill)

**Provision**: Life without parole for third violent felony

**Usage**: Relatively rare; most cases state-level

## Truth-in-Sentencing Era (1990s)

### 1994 Crime Bill Incentives

**Violent Offender Incarceration and Truth-in-Sentencing Grants**:

- Federal funding for prison construction
- Required: 85% time served for violent offenders
- 42 states adopted TIS by 2000

**Impact on State Sentences**:

| Before TIS | After TIS |
|------------|-----------|
| Serve 40-50% of sentence | Serve 85%+ of sentence |
| Parole discretion | Minimal parole |
| Average 3 years violent | Average 5.5 years violent |

### Abolition of Parole

**States Abolishing Discretionary Parole**:

| State | Year Abolished |
|-------|---------------|
| Maine | 1976 |
| California | 1977 |
| Illinois | 1978 |
| Minnesota | 1980 |
| Washington | 1984 |
| Federal | 1987 |
| Arizona | 1994 |
| Virginia | 1995 |
| Wisconsin | 2000 |

## Mass Incarceration Peak (2000-2010)

### Prison Population Growth

| Year | State Prisoners | Federal Prisoners | Total |
|------|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| 1980 | 295,000 | 24,000 | 319,000 |
| 1990 | 684,000 | 58,000 | 742,000 |
| 2000 | 1,176,000 | 133,000 | 1,309,000 |
| 2009 | 1,407,000 | 208,000 | 1,615,000 |

### Drivers of Growth

**Sentencing Policy**: ~50% of growth

- Longer sentences
- Truth-in-sentencing
- Mandatory minimums
- Three strikes

**Enforcement Policy**: ~30% of growth

- War on Drugs
- More arrests
- More prosecutions

**Parole/Release Policy**: ~20% of growth

- Less parole
- More revocations
- Less good time

## Reform Era (2010-Present)

### *United States v. Booker* (2005)

**Holding**: Mandatory guidelines violate Sixth Amendment

**Effect**: Guidelines advisory; judges may vary

**Impact**: Sentences began declining; more below-range sentences

### Fair Sentencing Act (2010)

**Provisions**:

- Reduced crack/powder ratio from 100:1 to 18:1
- Eliminated 5-year mandatory for simple crack possession

### First Step Act (2018)

**Federal Provisions**:

- Expanded safety valve eligibility
- Reduced 924(c) stacking (prospective only)
- Retroactive crack reforms
- Expanded good time credits
- Compassionate release reform

**Results**:

- ~3,000+ reduced sentences
- Thousands more compassionate releases
- Modest but significant federal impact

### Current Debate

**Pending Reforms**:

- EQUAL Act (eliminate crack/powder disparity)
- Second Look provisions
- Mandatory minimum reforms
- Earned time expansion

**Ongoing Tensions**:

- Crime rate concerns (post-2020 increases)
- Political risk of appearing "soft"
- Prosecutor opposition to discretion reduction
- Victim advocacy for harsh sentences
