# Sentencing Reform: Overview

American sentencing practices are among the harshest in the developed world, driving mass incarceration while failing to improve public safety. The shift from judicial discretion to mandatory minimums, truth-in-sentencing laws, and three-strikes provisions has produced sentences dramatically longer than other democracies, with stark racial disparities at every stage. Over 1.2 million people are currently serving sentences in state and federal prisons, many for terms that exceed what any evidence suggests is necessary for rehabilitation or public safety.
