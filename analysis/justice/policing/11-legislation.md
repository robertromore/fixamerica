# Policing Reform: Legislation

## Overview

Policing reform legislation operates at federal, state, and local levels. Federal legislation can set minimum standards through funding conditions and address qualified immunity through statutory amendment. State legislation is crucial for decertification, use of force standards, and accountability mechanisms. Local ordinances and charter amendments can create civilian oversight and policy requirements.

## Federal Legislation

### Ending Qualified Immunity Act

**Purpose**: Eliminate qualified immunity defense for civil rights violations by law enforcement.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Ending Qualified Immunity Act".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds that:
(1) Qualified immunity, a judicially created doctrine, has
been interpreted to prevent accountability for civil rights
violations by law enforcement officers.
(2) The doctrine was not mandated by Congress and is not
required by the Constitution.
(3) The requirement that plaintiffs identify a prior case
with nearly identical facts has become an insurmountable
barrier to justice.
(4) Eliminating qualified immunity will restore accountability
and deter misconduct.

SEC. 3. ELIMINATION OF QUALIFIED IMMUNITY.

Section 1979 of the Revised Statutes (42 U.S.C. § 1983) is
amended by adding at the end the following:

"(c) QUALIFIED IMMUNITY NO DEFENSE.—It shall not be a defense
or immunity to any action brought under this section that—
(1) the defendant was acting in good faith, or
(2) the defendant believed, reasonably or otherwise, that
the defendant's conduct was lawful at the time when it
was committed.

(d) CONSTRUCTION.—Any court interpreting this section shall
not require that a plaintiff identify a prior case with
fundamentally or materially similar facts to establish that
a right was 'clearly established' at the time of the challenged
conduct.

(e) ENTITY LIABILITY.—A local government entity shall be
liable for violations of this section by its employees acting
under color of law, regardless of whether the entity had a
policy or custom of such violations.

(f) ATTORNEY'S FEES.—In any action under this section, the
court shall award reasonable attorney's fees to a prevailing
plaintiff."

SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect upon enactment and shall apply
to any claim arising before, on, or after such date.
```

**Explanation**:

- Section 3(c) directly eliminates qualified immunity defense
- Section 3(d) addresses the "clearly established" requirement
- Section 3(e) creates entity liability (overrules *Monell* limitations)
- Section 3(f) ensures attorney's fees for successful plaintiffs

**Potential Challenges**:

- Police union opposition
- Concerns about frivolous lawsuits
- Municipal liability concerns
- Political opposition

**Refinements**:

- Phase-in period for municipalities to adjust
- Federal assistance for liability insurance
- Training on constitutional requirements

### National Use of Force Standards Act

**Purpose**: Establish minimum national standards for use of force by law enforcement.

**Draft Text**:

```text
SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "National Use of Force
Standards Act".

SEC. 2. USE OF FORCE STANDARDS.

(a) DEADLY FORCE STANDARD.—A Federal, State, or local law
enforcement officer may use deadly force only when—
(1) such force is necessary as a last resort to prevent
imminent death or serious bodily injury to the officer
or another person;
(2) all reasonable alternatives to the use of deadly force
have been exhausted or are not feasible under the
circumstances; and
(3) the officer's actions that preceded the use of force
were consistent with the officer's training and did not
recklessly or intentionally create the circumstances
requiring deadly force.

(b) PROPORTIONALITY.—Any use of force by a law enforcement
officer shall be proportional to the threat posed and to the
seriousness of the offense, taking into account all
circumstances.

(c) DE-ESCALATION.—Law enforcement officers shall employ
de-escalation tactics whenever safe and feasible, including
verbal persuasion, creating distance, and requesting
additional resources, before resorting to force.

(d) DUTY TO INTERVENE.—Any law enforcement officer who
observes another officer using force that is excessive or
otherwise in violation of law shall intervene to stop such
force and report the incident.

(e) DUTY TO RENDER AID.—Following any use of force that
results in injury, officers shall immediately request
medical assistance and provide basic aid.

SEC. 3. PROHIBITED PRACTICES.

(a) CHOKEHOLDS.—The use of chokeholds, carotid restraints,
or any other technique that restricts blood or oxygen flow
to the brain is prohibited, except when deadly force is
authorized.

(b) NO-KNOCK WARRANTS.—No-knock warrants are prohibited
except in exigent circumstances involving imminent harm
to persons.

(c) SHOOTING AT VEHICLES.—Shooting at or from a moving
vehicle is prohibited unless the vehicle is being used as
a deadly weapon and no other option is available.

SEC. 4. FUNDING CONDITIONS.

(a) No funds appropriated by Congress for law enforcement
assistance shall be provided to any law enforcement agency
that does not adopt and implement policies consistent with
this Act.

(b) Agencies shall certify compliance annually.

(c) The Attorney General shall issue guidance on compliance.

SEC. 5. DATA COLLECTION.

(a) All law enforcement agencies receiving Federal funds
shall report all use of force incidents to the Attorney
General, including—
(1) circumstances of the incident;
(2) type of force used;
(3) injuries sustained by any person;
(4) demographic information about officers and subjects; and
(5) outcome of the incident.

(b) The Attorney General shall publish annual reports on
use of force data.

SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect 180 days after enactment.
```

**Explanation**:

- Section 2 establishes "necessary as last resort" standard
- Section 2(c) creates affirmative duty to de-escalate
- Section 3 prohibits particularly dangerous practices
- Section 4 uses funding conditions for enforcement
- Section 5 mandates comprehensive data collection

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Authority

**Federal Authority**:

- Spending Clause: Funding conditions on state/local agencies
- Commerce Clause: Regulation affecting interstate commerce
- 14th Amendment: Enforcement of equal protection
- 42 U.S.C. § 1983: Civil rights enforcement (amendable)

**Qualified Immunity Elimination**:

- Not constitutionally required (judicially created)
- Congress may alter statutory immunity
- Clear statutory language needed

### Preemption

**Federal Floor**:

- States may provide greater protections
- State elimination of qualified immunity for state claims not preempted

**State-Local**:

- Some states preempt local police reform
- May need state enabling legislation for local action

### Enforcement Mechanisms

**Federal**:

- Funding conditions (Section 4 of proposed bills)
- Pattern-or-practice investigations
- Consent decrees

**State**:

- POST commission enforcement
- AG authority
- Civil litigation

**Local**:

- Civilian oversight
- Discipline authority

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Funding workaround | Agencies decline federal funds | Moderate |
| Decertification escape | Officers resign before investigation | High |
| Arbitration override | Arbitrators overturn discipline | High |
| Data underreporting | Agencies don't report accurately | Moderate |
| Consent decree early termination | Premature release | High |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Decentralization | Reform requires 18,000 agencies | Constitutional structure |
| Union resistance | Contracts undermine reform | Collective bargaining |
| Political vulnerability | Reforms reversed | Electoral politics |
| Cultural resistance | Policy without culture change | Institutional inertia |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Mandatory reporting with penalties**: Make non-reporting a crime; create private right of action for victims when data not reported.

2. **Investigation completion requirement**: Require all investigations to continue regardless of resignation; decertification based on would-have-been findings.

3. **Arbitration reform**: Limit arbitration scope; require arbitrators with police accountability experience; make arbitration decisions public.

4. **Consent decree sustainability**: Require 3-year sustained compliance; ongoing monitoring after termination; automatic reinstatement triggers.

5. **Union contract standards**: Prohibit contract provisions that impede accountability; void conflicting provisions as against public policy.
