# Policing Reform: Overview

American policing faces a crisis of legitimacy. High-profile killings by police, persistent racial disparities in enforcement, and a culture of impunity have eroded public trust, particularly in communities of color. While police perform essential functions, the current model—characterized by warrior mentality, minimal accountability, broad immunity from civil liability, and inadequate training—fails both the public and officers themselves.
