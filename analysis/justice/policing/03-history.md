# Policing Reform: History

## Origins of American Policing

### Colonial Era

**Watch Systems**:

- Volunteer night watches
- Focused on order maintenance
- Limited professional policing
- Community-based, informal

**Slave Patrols (South)**:

- First organized police forces in South
- Purpose: Catch runaway slaves, prevent insurrection
- Created racial control model
- Violence as primary tool

### 19th Century

**Early Urban Police (1830s-1850s)**:

| City | Year | Model |
|------|------|-------|
| Boston | 1838 | First modern department |
| New York | 1845 | London Metropolitan model |
| Philadelphia | 1854 | Consolidated department |

**Characteristics**:

- Political patronage systems
- Corruption endemic
- Tied to ward politics
- Ethnic tensions (Irish officers)
- Strike-breaking role

### Reform Era (1900s-1960s)

**Professionalization Movement**:

- August Vollmer (Berkeley): Education, technology
- O.W. Wilson: Administrative reform
- J. Edgar Hoover: FBI modernization

**Changes**:

| Reform | Goal |
|--------|------|
| Civil service | End patronage |
| Training academies | Standardization |
| Technology | Cars, radios, forensics |
| Detachment | End "corrupt" community ties |

**Unintended Consequences**:

- Isolation from communities
- "Us vs. them" mentality
- Warrior culture development
- Loss of community knowledge

## Civil Rights Era

### Police as Enforcers of Segregation

**Role**:

- Enforced Jim Crow laws
- Attacked civil rights protesters
- Protected segregationists
- Resistance to desegregation

**Key Events**:

| Event | Year | Significance |
|-------|------|--------------|
| Birmingham | 1963 | Dogs, fire hoses on protesters |
| Selma | 1965 | Bloody Sunday |
| Detroit | 1967 | Uprising after police raid |
| Chicago | 1968 | Democratic Convention violence |

### Kerner Commission (1968)

**Findings**:

- "Our nation is moving toward two societies, one black, one white—separate and unequal"
- Police practices contributed to urban unrest
- Recommended major reforms

**Aftermath**:

- Largely ignored
- Backlash politics instead
- Law-and-order rhetoric

## Law-and-Order Era (1970s-1990s)

### Shift to Punitive Policing

**Political Context**:

- Nixon: "Law and order" campaign
- War on drugs
- Crime wave (1960s-1990s)
- "Tough on crime" politics

**Policing Changes**:

| Development | Era | Impact |
|-------------|-----|--------|
| SWAT teams | 1960s-70s | Militarization |
| Drug enforcement | 1970s-80s | Aggressive tactics |
| Broken windows | 1980s | Aggressive order maintenance |
| Zero tolerance | 1990s | Mass stops, arrests |

### Broken Windows Policing

**Theory**: Minor disorder leads to serious crime; aggressive enforcement of minor violations prevents major crime

**Practice**:

- Stop-and-frisk
- Arrests for minor offenses
- Quality of life enforcement
- Intense focus on high-crime areas

**Critique**:

- Limited evidence of effectiveness
- Severe racial disparities
- Community alienation
- Civil liberties concerns

### Militarization

**1033 Program (1990)**:

- Transfers military equipment to police
- MRAPs, weapons, gear
- Warrior mentality reinforced

**Growth of SWAT**:

| Metric | 1980 | 2015 |
|--------|------|------|
| SWAT deployments | ~3,000 | ~50,000+ |
| Departments with SWAT | Rare | Common |

## Recent Reform Waves

### Post-Rodney King (1991-1992)

**Trigger**: Video of officers beating Rodney King; acquittal sparked uprising

**Reforms**:

- Christopher Commission (LA)
- Consent decree authority (1994 Crime Bill)
- Community policing initiatives
- Pattern-or-practice investigations

**Limitations**:

- Reforms often superficial
- Community policing poorly implemented
- DOJ enforcement inconsistent

### Post-Ferguson (2014-2016)

**Trigger**: Michael Brown killing, Ferguson uprising

**Response**:

- DOJ Ferguson report (systemic problems)
- President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing
- Consent decrees expanded
- Body camera adoption

**Task Force Recommendations**:

| Pillar | Focus |
|--------|-------|
| Trust | Guardian mentality |
| Policy | Use of force revision |
| Technology | Body cameras, less-lethal |
| Community Policing | Authentic engagement |
| Training | De-escalation, bias |
| Officer Safety | Wellness, support |

### Post-George Floyd (2020-Present)

**Trigger**: Video of Derek Chauvin killing George Floyd

**Unprecedented Response**:

- Massive protests globally
- "Defund the police" debate
- Officer convicted of murder
- Legislative proposals

**Changes**:

| Level | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Local | Chokehold bans, policy changes |
| State | Certification reforms, immunity debates |
| Federal | George Floyd Act proposed (not passed) |

**Backlash**:

- Crime increases (2020-2022) blamed on reform
- "Defund" rhetoric attacked
- Some reforms rolled back
- Progressive prosecutor recalls

## Patterns Across Reform Eras

### Recurring Themes

**Trigger Events**:

- Video evidence of brutality
- High-profile killings
- Uprisings

**Reform Pattern**:

1. Outrage and demands for change
2. Commissions and reports
3. Policy changes announced
4. Incomplete implementation
5. Backlash and retrenchment
6. Return to previous practices

### Why Reforms Fail

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Police union resistance | Block implementation |
| Political backlash | "Soft on crime" attacks |
| Superficial changes | Policy without culture change |
| No sustained pressure | Attention moves on |
| Structural factors | Qualified immunity, decentralization |

### What's Different Now

**Potential for Lasting Change**:

- Video everywhere (phones, body cameras)
- Sustained organizing (Movement for Black Lives)
- Broader coalition support
- Some structural reforms (qualified immunity debate)
- Alternative models emerging

**Obstacles Remain**:

- Police unions powerful
- Qualified immunity intact federally
- Decentralized system
- Political backlash real
- Cultural change slow
