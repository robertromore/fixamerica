# Policing Reform: Current State

## Use of Force

### Fatal Force

**Annual Deaths**: Approximately 1,000 people killed by police each year

| Data Source | Count | Coverage |
|-------------|-------|----------|
| Washington Post database | ~1,000/year | Shootings only, since 2015 |
| Mapping Police Violence | ~1,100/year | All killings |
| Fatal Encounters | ~1,200/year | All killings, broader criteria |
| FBI NIBRS | Incomplete | Voluntary reporting |

**Circumstances**:

| Circumstance | Percentage |
|--------------|------------|
| Responding to violent crime | ~35% |
| Mental health crisis | ~25% |
| Traffic stop | ~15% |
| Welfare check | ~10% |
| Domestic disturbance | ~10% |
| Other | ~5% |

**Weapons**:

- 95%+ of police killings involve firearms
- Tasers, vehicles, physical restraint account for remainder

### Non-Fatal Force

**Limited Data**: No comprehensive national tracking

**Available Information**:

- DOJ surveys estimate 1+ million use of force incidents annually
- Injuries from police contact poorly tracked
- Racial disparities significant in all categories

### Racial Disparities

| Metric | Black Rate | White Rate | Disparity |
|--------|-----------|------------|-----------|
| Fatal shootings (per capita) | 7.3 per million | 2.9 per million | 2.5x |
| Traffic stops | Higher | Lower | 1.5-2x |
| Searches after stops | Higher | Lower | 2-3x |
| Arrests (drug offenses) | Higher | Lower | 3-4x |
| Use of force incidents | Higher | Lower | 2-3x |

## Accountability

### Criminal Prosecution

**Officers Charged**: Very rare

| Metric | Data |
|--------|------|
| Fatal shootings | ~1,000/year |
| Officers charged | ~15-20/year |
| Officers convicted | ~5-10/year |
| Rate of charges | ~1.5% |
| Rate of conviction | ~0.5% |

**Barriers to Prosecution**:

- Prosecutors depend on police cooperation
- Grand juries rarely indict
- "Reasonable fear" standard favors officers
- Jury sympathy for officers
- Police union pressure

### Civil Liability

**Qualified Immunity**:

- Officers liable only if "clearly established" law violated
- Courts interpret very narrowly
- Most cases dismissed on immunity grounds
- Victims rarely receive compensation from officers personally

**Settlements and Judgments**:

| City | Annual Payouts | Notes |
|------|----------------|-------|
| New York | $200+ million | Police misconduct settlements |
| Chicago | $100+ million | Torture, wrongful conviction |
| Los Angeles | $50+ million | Various misconduct |

- Taxpayers pay, not officers
- No individual accountability

### Administrative Discipline

**Discipline Rare**:

- Most complaints not sustained
- Discipline often overturned on appeal
- Arbitration favors officers
- Union contracts limit discipline

**Typical Outcome**:

| Complaint Stage | Result |
|-----------------|--------|
| Filed | 100% |
| Investigated | 60-80% |
| Sustained | 5-15% |
| Discipline imposed | 2-10% |
| Discipline survives appeal | 1-5% |

### Civilian Oversight

**Prevalence**:

- ~150 civilian oversight agencies nationwide
- Wide variation in authority
- Most lack binding discipline power

**Types**:

| Type | Authority | Effectiveness |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| Citizen review board | Advisory only | Limited |
| Civilian complaint board | Investigative | Moderate |
| Independent monitor | Investigative + recommendations | Moderate |
| Inspector general | Full authority | Higher |
| Civilian control | Binding discipline | Highest |

## Training

### Academy Training

**Duration**:

| Country | Average Training |
|---------|-----------------|
| United States | 21 weeks |
| Germany | 2.5 years |
| Finland | 3 years |
| Norway | 3 years |

**Content (U.S. average)**:

| Subject | Hours |
|---------|-------|
| Firearms | 71 |
| Self-defense | 60 |
| Legal | 53 |
| Patrol procedures | 40 |
| De-escalation | 8 |
| Mental health | 10 |
| Implicit bias | 6 |

### Field Training

- 12-16 weeks typical
- Highly variable quality
- Culture transmitted officer-to-officer
- Academy training often contradicted

### Ongoing Training

- 40 hours/year typical requirement
- Often firearms and defensive tactics
- Limited de-escalation training
- Implicit bias training inconsistent

## Department Structure

### Fragmentation

| Agency Type | Number | Officers |
|-------------|--------|----------|
| Local police | ~12,000 | ~470,000 |
| Sheriff's offices | ~3,000 | ~175,000 |
| State police | 50 | ~60,000 |
| Federal agencies | Various | ~130,000 |

**Implications**:

- No national standards
- Inconsistent policies
- Reform requires jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction change
- Limited information sharing on problem officers

### Police Unions

**Coverage**: ~80% of officers unionized

**Contract Provisions**:

| Provision | Prevalence |
|-----------|------------|
| Waiting period before investigation | 65%+ |
| Access to evidence before statement | 50%+ |
| Limit on anonymous complaints | 50%+ |
| Discipline appeal to arbitration | 70%+ |
| Expungement of disciplinary records | 50%+ |

### Staffing

**Officer Ratio**: ~2.4 officers per 1,000 residents (national average)

- Wide variation by city
- Higher in cities, lower in rural areas
- Debates over optimal levels

## Community Relations

### Trust Levels

**Confidence in Police** (Gallup):

| Group | Confidence |
|-------|------------|
| White Americans | ~60% |
| Black Americans | ~30% |
| Hispanic Americans | ~45% |
| Overall | ~50% |

### Community Policing

**Prevalence**: Most departments claim community policing

**Reality**:

- Often superficial implementation
- Community engagement events ≠ community policing
- Procedural justice principles rarely institutionalized
- Metrics still focus on arrests, stops

### Stop-and-Frisk and Pretextual Stops

**New York City**:

- Peak: 685,000 stops (2011)
- 88% resulted in no action
- Post-reform: ~12,000 stops (2020)
- Crime continued falling

**Racial Targeting**:

- Black and Latino individuals disproportionately stopped
- "Hit rates" (finding contraband) often lower for minorities
- Indicates over-policing, not rational targeting

## Recent Developments

### Post-2020 Changes

**Policy Changes**:

- Many cities banned chokeholds
- No-knock warrant restrictions
- Duty to intervene policies
- Body camera expansion

**Structural Changes**:

- Some cities exploring alternatives (mental health responders)
- Few major structural reforms sustained
- Funding debates ("defund") largely resolved toward maintenance

### Consent Decrees

**Active Consent Decrees**:

| City | Start | Focus |
|------|-------|-------|
| Baltimore | 2017 | Use of force, stops |
| Chicago | 2019 | Use of force, accountability |
| Newark | 2016 | Stops, force, complaints |
| Ferguson | 2016 | Full reform |
| New Orleans | 2012 | Comprehensive |

**Mixed Results**:

- Some improvements under monitoring
- Sustainability after decree ends unclear
- Dependent on DOJ administration priorities
