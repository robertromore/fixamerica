# Policing Reform: Solutions

## Use of Force Reform

### Standards

**From "Reasonable Officer" to "Necessary"**:

| Current Standard | Reformed Standard |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Reasonable officer would use force | Force necessary as last resort |
| Deference to officer perception | Objective necessity |
| Split-second justification | Consider actions leading to encounter |
| No duty to de-escalate | Affirmative duty to de-escalate |

**Key Elements**:

- Force only when necessary to prevent imminent harm
- Proportional to threat
- De-escalation required first
- Duty to intervene
- Comprehensive reporting

### Prohibited Techniques

| Technique | Reform |
|-----------|--------|
| Chokeholds | Ban completely |
| Neck restraints | Ban completely |
| No-knock warrants | Eliminate or strictly limit |
| Shooting at moving vehicles | Prohibit (unless vehicle is weapon) |
| Warning shots | Prohibit in most circumstances |

### De-Escalation

**Training Requirements**:

- Minimum hours in academy
- Annual refresher training
- Scenario-based practice
- Integration into all tactics training

**Policy Requirements**:

- De-escalation before force when feasible
- Time, distance, cover tactics
- Communication emphasis
- Slowing encounters down

### Force Continuum

**Graduated Response**:

1. Presence and communication
2. Verbal commands
3. Empty hand control
4. Intermediate weapons (OC spray, baton)
5. Less-lethal (TASER with restrictions)
6. Deadly force (only when necessary to prevent imminent death/serious injury)

### Reporting and Review

**Requirements**:

| Report Type | Trigger |
|-------------|---------|
| Force report | Any use of force |
| Supervisor review | All force incidents |
| Use of force review board | Serious force |
