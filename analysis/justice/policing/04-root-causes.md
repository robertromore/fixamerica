# Policing Reform: Root Causes

## Structural Factors

### Qualified Immunity

**Doctrine**:

- Officers liable only if they violate "clearly established" law
- Courts require nearly identical prior case
- Result: Most civil rights claims dismissed

**Effects**:

| Impact | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| No deterrence | Officers face no personal financial consequence |
| Victim compensation rare | Cases dismissed before trial |
| Bad precedent | Novel misconduct can't be "clearly established" |
| Message | Officers above civil law |

**Origins**:

- Judicial creation (not statutory)
- *Harlow v. Fitzgerald* (1982)
- Expanded far beyond original intent
- Not required by Constitution

### Decentralization

**Fragmentation**:

- 18,000+ law enforcement agencies
- No national standards
- No national licensing
- Information sharing limited

**Consequences**:

| Problem | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Wandering officers | Fired for misconduct, hired elsewhere |
| Inconsistent policies | Use of force varies by department |
| Reform requires | Jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction change |
| Best practices | Don't spread systematically |

### Police Union Power

**Contract Protections**:

| Provision | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| 48-72 hour delay before questioning | Time to coordinate stories |
| Access to evidence before statement | Tailor statements to evidence |
| Discipline appeal to arbitration | Arbitrators overturn discipline |
| Record expungement | Past misconduct hidden |
| Grievance procedures | Delay and discourage discipline |

**Political Power**:

- Endorsements valuable to politicians
- Oppose reform candidates
- Lobby against accountability legislation
- Frame reforms as anti-officer

### Prosecutorial Dependence

**Structural Conflict**:

- Prosecutors work daily with police
- Depend on police cooperation for cases
- Political relationship
- Reluctance to charge officers

**Results**:

- Grand juries rarely indict officers
- Charges often lesser than warranted
- Trials infrequent
- Convictions rare

## Cultural Factors

### Warrior Mentality

**Training Emphasis**:

| Focus | Message |
|-------|---------|
| Tactical | Every encounter is dangerous |
| Survival | Officer safety paramount |
| Combat | "Warrior" identity |
| Fear | Worst-case thinking |

**Contrast with "Guardian" Model**:

| Warrior | Guardian |
|---------|----------|
| Combat focus | Protection focus |
| Fear-based | Trust-based |
| Control | Communication |
| Force primary | Force last resort |

### Blue Wall of Silence

**Code of Silence**:

- Don't report fellow officers
- Don't testify against officers
- Retaliation for "snitching"
- Cover-up normalized

**Enforcement**:

- Social ostracism
- Career consequences
- Physical threats (rare but real)
- Union pressure

### Us vs. Them

**In-Group/Out-Group**:

- Officers vs. civilians
- Officers vs. "bad guys"
- Officers vs. administration
- Officers vs. reformers

**Effects**:

- Distrust of community
- Resistance to oversight
- Defensive solidarity
- Inability to acknowledge problems

### Implicit and Explicit Bias

**Research Findings**:

- Officers show same implicit biases as general population
- Training on bias has limited effect
- Stress and split-second decisions increase bias impact
- Explicit racism present in some officers

**Manifestations**:

| Behavior | Disparity |
|----------|-----------|
| Stop decisions | Black individuals more likely |
| Search decisions | Black individuals more likely |
| Use of force | More force against Black individuals |
| Deadly force | Black individuals at higher risk |

## Institutional Factors

### Inadequate Training

**Hours vs. Outcomes**:

| Country | Training | Outcomes |
|---------|----------|----------|
| U.S. | 21 weeks | High killings |
| Germany | 2.5 years | Low killings |
| Norway | 3 years | Very low killings |

**Content Problems**:

- Heavy on weapons, light on communication
- De-escalation underemphasized
- Scenarios don't match reality
- Field training contradicts academy

### Metrics and Incentives

**What Gets Measured**:

| Metric | Incentive |
|--------|-----------|
| Arrests | More arrests = good |
| Stops | Activity = productivity |
| Response time | Speed over quality |
| Clearance rates | Close cases, any method |

**What's Not Measured**:

- Community satisfaction
- Force incidents
- Complaints
- Long-term outcomes

### Scope Creep

**Police as Default Responders**:

| Issue | Should Police Handle? |
|-------|-----------------------|
| Mental health crisis | Often no |
| Homelessness | Generally no |
| School discipline | Generally no |
| Traffic enforcement | Debatable |
| Drug use | Debatable |

**Consequences**:

- Officers untrained for many calls
- Escalation when de-escalation needed
- Criminalization of social problems
- Resource misallocation

## Legal Factors

### Graham v. Connor Standard

**"Objective Reasonableness"**:

- Force judged by what "reasonable officer" would do
- Considers "split-second" decisions
- Deference to officer perception
- Hindsight not allowed

**Problems**:

- Standard too permissive
- Reasonable fear vs. actual threat
- No requirement to de-escalate first
- Officer actions creating danger not considered

### Tennessee v. Garner Limitations

**Deadly Force Standard**:

- Can't use deadly force solely to prevent escape
- Can use if suspect threatens officer or others
- In practice: Broad interpretation of "threat"

**Weaknesses**:

- "Threat" expansively defined
- Fear of future harm counts
- Objective basis often assumed
- No duty to warn if "infeasible"

### Police Bill of Rights

**State Laws (Many States)**:

| Provision | Effect |
|-----------|--------|
| Notification before investigation | Time to prepare |
| Time limits on investigations | Cases can expire |
| Access to complainant identity | Discourages complaints |
| Limited questioning conditions | Protective procedures |
| Appeal rights | Discipline overturned |

## Political Factors

### Electoral Politics

**Tough-on-Crime Pressure**:

- Politicians fear "soft on crime" label
- Police endorsements valuable
- Victim advocacy provides cover for punishment
- Reform = political risk

**Local Dynamics**:

- Sheriffs elected (rural areas)
- Prosecutors elected
- City councils face police union pressure
- Mayors dependent on police support

### Media Coverage

**Crime Reporting**:

- Crime overrepresented in news
- Focus on violent crime
- Perpetrator-focused narratives
- Fear drives viewership

**Police Coverage**:

- Often favorable to police perspective
- "Officer-involved shooting" passive framing
- Limited investigation of misconduct
- Sources: police spokespeople

### Fear and Race

**Racial Anxiety**:

- Fear of crime racially coded
- Black men stereotyped as threatening
- Implicit association crime-race
- Political exploitation of fear

**Policy Effects**:

- Aggressive policing in Black communities
- Tolerance for disparities
- Resistance to reform framed as soft on crime

## Reinforcing Dynamics

### Vicious Cycles

```text
Aggressive policing → Community distrust →
Less cooperation → Less effective policing →
More aggressive tactics → More distrust
```

```text
Lack of accountability → Misconduct continues →
Community harm → Demands for reform →
Union resistance → No accountability
```

### Compound Effects

- Warrior culture + qualified immunity = impunity
- Decentralization + union power = reform resistance
- Inadequate training + scope creep = poor outcomes
- Fear politics + racial bias = discriminatory enforcement
