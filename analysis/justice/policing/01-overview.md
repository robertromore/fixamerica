# Policing Reform: Overview

## Executive Summary

American policing faces a crisis of legitimacy. High-profile killings by police, persistent racial disparities in enforcement, and a culture of impunity have eroded public trust, particularly in communities of color. While police perform essential functions, the current model—characterized by warrior mentality, minimal accountability, broad immunity from civil liability, and inadequate training—fails both the public and officers themselves.

Reform requires fundamental changes: reimagining what police should do, how they should do it, and how they are held accountable when they fail. This means limiting police scope to truly police functions, establishing clear use of force standards, creating meaningful accountability mechanisms, and investing in training and community relationships.

## Scope

### What This Subtopic Covers

- **Use of Force**: Standards, policies, training, and outcomes
- **Accountability**: Qualified immunity, civilian oversight, discipline
- **Training**: Academy, ongoing, de-escalation, bias
- **Community Relations**: Community policing, procedural justice, trust
- **Structure**: Department organization, unions, civilian alternatives
- **Data**: Transparency, reporting, disparities

### What This Subtopic Does Not Cover

- Corrections and jails (see [Prisons](../prisons/01-overview.md))
- Prosecutors (see [Prosecutors](../prosecutors/01-overview.md))
- Courts (see [Courts](../courts/01-overview.md))
- Immigration enforcement specifically (see Immigration topic)

## Key Questions

1. **Why do police kill so many people?** What factors drive American police use of deadly force at rates far exceeding other democracies?

2. **Why do racial disparities persist?** What explains persistent disparities in stops, searches, arrests, and use of force?

3. **Why is accountability so rare?** What structural factors prevent officers from being held accountable for misconduct?

4. **What is the appropriate scope of policing?** Should police respond to mental health crises, homelessness, and other social issues?

5. **What reforms work?** Which interventions have proven effective at reducing violence and improving community relations?

## Why This Matters

**Lives Lost**: ~1,000 people killed by police annually; many more injured

**Racial Justice**: Black Americans 2.5-3x more likely to be killed by police

**Community Harm**: Over-policing damages the communities most in need of protection

**Officer Wellbeing**: Unrealistic expectations, inadequate training, and trauma harm officers

**Trust**: Low trust undermines cooperation needed for effective public safety

**Resources**: Billions spent on policing could be better allocated

## Key Statistics

| Metric | Data |
|--------|------|
| Fatal police shootings | ~1,000/year |
| Officers killed (felonious) | ~60/year |
| Police departments | ~18,000 |
| Sworn officers | ~700,000 |
| Average training (academy) | 21 weeks |
| Officers charged for on-duty killings | ~1-2%/year |
| Black/white disparity in fatal shootings | 2.5-3x |

## The Problem in Context

### Compared to Other Countries

| Country | Police Killings (per 10 million) |
|---------|--------------------------------|
| United States | ~34 |
| Canada | ~10 |
| Germany | ~1.3 |
| United Kingdom | ~0.5 |
| Japan | ~0.2 |

### Within the U.S.

- Massive variation by department and jurisdiction
- Some cities have reduced shootings significantly
- Reform is possible but unevenly implemented
