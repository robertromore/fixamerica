# Solutions for Civil Rights Enforcement Reform

## Overview

Meaningful civil rights enforcement reform requires action across multiple domains: legislative, executive, judicial, and local. This document presents comprehensive solutions organized by mechanism and level of government.

## Federal Legislative Solutions

### 1. Qualified Immunity Reform

**Option A: Complete Elimination**

Amend 42 U.S.C. § 1983 to add:
> "The defendant to an action under this section may not assert as a defense that the defendant was acting in good faith, or that the defendant believed that his or her conduct was lawful at the time it was committed. This section does not prevent the United States or a State from providing additional liability protection to any person."

**Option B: Meaningful Limitation**

Modify the "clearly established" standard:

- Violation must be "clearly established" only at level of general principle
- Eliminate requirement for case with same facts
- Allow analogous cases from any jurisdiction
- Shift burden to defendant to prove right was not established

**Option C: Procedural Reforms**

- Require courts to decide constitutional question before immunity question
- Create interlocutory appeal rights for plaintiffs when immunity granted
- Mandate that qualified immunity decisions be precedential

**Implementation Comparison:**

| Approach | Political Feasibility | Impact on Accountability | Officer Concern Level |
|----------|----------------------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| Full elimination | Low | Highest | Highest |
| Meaningful limitation | Medium | High | Medium |
| Procedural reforms | Higher | Moderate | Lower |

### 2. Strengthen Municipal Liability

| "Deliberate indifference" standard | Change to "knew or should have known" |
| Single incident insufficient | Pattern evidence not required if violation clear |

**Model Language:**
> "A local government entity shall be liable for damages caused by the actions of its employees or agents acting within the scope of their official duties or employment. A local government entity shall not be entitled to assert qualified immunity as a defense."
