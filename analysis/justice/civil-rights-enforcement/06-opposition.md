| "We're already reforming" | Voluntary reform often fails |
| "This is local business" | Constitutional violations are federal matter |
| "Will hurt recruitment" | No evidence supports this |

## Opposition Arguments and Rebuttals

### On Qualified Immunity

| Argument | Rebuttal |
|----------|----------|
| "Officers will be paralyzed without it" | Officers didn't have QI until 1982; policing functioned |
| "Opens door to frivolous suits" | Motions to dismiss still available; no flood of suits in states that eliminated |
| "Officers will leave profession" | No evidence from Colorado or New Mexico |
| "Will bankrupt officers" | Cities indemnify 99%+ of judgments |
| "Officers don't know constitutional law" | Then training should improve, not immunity expand |

### On DOJ Investigations

| Argument | Rebuttal |
|----------|----------|
| "Federal overreach" | Constitution and federal statutes authorize |
| "Demoralizes good officers" | Focus is on systemic reform, not individual blame |
| "One size doesn't fit all" | Consent decrees are tailored to specific department |
| "Costly to implement" | Cost of violations (settlements, distrust) is higher |
| "Takes years with no accountability" | Duration is due to resistance, not inherent to process |

### On Criminal Prosecution

| Argument | Rebuttal |
|----------|----------|
| "Officers face split-second decisions" | Standard accounts for reasonable mistakes |
| "Will deter policing" | No evidence; officers should be deterred from violations |
| "Already hard job, don't make harder" | Accountability improves profession |
| "Local prosecutors can handle" | Conflict of interest prevents effective local prosecution |
