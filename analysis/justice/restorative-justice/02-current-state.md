# Restorative Justice: Current State

## Overview of Current Implementation

Restorative justice in the United States exists as a patchwork of programs, practices, and policies that vary dramatically by jurisdiction, case type, and available resources. While significant growth has occurred over the past three decades, restorative approaches remain marginalized within a system still dominated by punitive paradigms. Understanding the current landscape requires examining both the promising developments and persistent limitations.

## National Landscape

## Funding and Resources

### Current Funding Sources

| Source | Annual Funding (Estimated) | Primary Use |
|--------|---------------------------|-------------|
| OJJDP Grants | $15-20 million | Juvenile programs |

| Fee-Based Services | $10-15 million | Private mediation |

### Funding Gaps

- Per capita spending on RJ: ~$0.50 vs. $280 on incarceration
- Most programs operate on unstable grant funding
- Training resources insufficient for scale
- Research funding inadequate for evidence base expansion

## Workforce and Training

### Practitioner Demographics

|------|-----------------|----------------|
| Professional Mediators (RJ-trained) | 5,000-7,000 | 40+ hours formal training |
| Volunteer Facilitators | 15,000-20,000 | 20-40 hours training |

## Research and Evidence Base

### Meta-Analyses Findings

| Study | Sample Size | Key Finding |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| Sherman & Strang (2007) | 36 studies | RJ reduces recidivism, increases satisfaction |
| Latimer, Dowden & Muise (2005) | 22 studies | Superior victim/offender satisfaction |
| Wong et al. (2016) | 60 studies | 14% reduction in recidivism |
| Umbreit et al. (2004) | Multiple programs | 85% satisfaction across programs |

### Research Limitations

- Most studies focus on juvenile and minor offenses
- Limited research on serious/violent crime applications
- Few randomized controlled trials
- Inconsistent outcome measures across studies
- Limited long-term follow-up studies

## Current Policy Framework

### Federal Policy

- No comprehensive federal restorative justice legislation
- JJDPA mentions restorative justice but no mandates
- VOCA funds can support RJ but rarely do
- DOJ has issued supportive guidance but no requirements

### State Legislation

| Legislative Approach | Number of States |
|---------------------|------------------|
| RJ mentioned in juvenile code | 35 |
| RJ authorized for adult cases | 22 |
| School RJ legislation | 18 |
| Funded RJ programs | 12 |
| RJ as right for victims | 8 |
| Comprehensive RJ legislation | 4 |

## Gaps and Challenges

### Systemic Barriers

1. **Lack of system integration**: RJ operates parallel to, not within, justice systems
2. **Inconsistent referral pathways**: No standard criteria for case selection
3. **Resistance from prosecutors**: Concerns about accountability and precedent
4. **Victim advocate ambivalence**: Some see RJ as minimizing offenses
5. **Defense attorney concerns**: Due process questions, pressure to participate

### Capacity Limitations

1. **Insufficient trained facilitators**: Cannot meet potential demand
2. **Geographic disparities**: Rural areas especially underserved
3. **Funding instability**: Grant-dependent programs lack sustainability
4. **Quality control**: No consistent standards or accreditation

### Equity Concerns

1. **Access disparities**: Middle-class offenders more likely to access RJ
2. **Selection bias**: "Good candidates" selected, others excluded
3. **Cultural competence**: Programs may not reflect community diversity
4. **Language barriers**: Services often available only in English
