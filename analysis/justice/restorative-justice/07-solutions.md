# Restorative Justice: Solutions

## Introduction

Implementing restorative justice requires more than simply adding programs to existing systems. Effective implementation involves systemic change, cultural transformation, and sustained commitment across multiple domains. This document outlines comprehensive strategies for expanding and improving restorative justice across criminal justice, schools, and communities.

## Systemic Implementation Strategies

### Integration vs. Parallel Systems

| Approach | Description | Advantages | Disadvantages |
|----------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| Parallel | RJ operates alongside traditional system | Easier to start, maintains separation | Limited impact, may remain marginal |
| Integrated | RJ embedded within justice system | Greater reach, normalized | May be co-opted, lose distinctiveness |
| Hybrid | Core RJ principles; flexible relationship to system | Balances benefits | Requires ongoing negotiation |
| Transformative | RJ as vehicle for system transformation | Greatest potential impact | Most difficult, longest timeline |

### Entry Points for RJ

| Entry Point | Stage | Decision-Maker | Best For |
|-------------|-------|----------------|----------|
| Pre-arrest | Before any formal involvement | Police | Minor offenses, youth |
| Pre-charge | After arrest, before prosecution | Police/Prosecutor | First-time offenses |
| Pre-adjudication | Before trial/plea | Prosecutor/Court | Various offenses |
| Post-adjudication | After conviction, pre-sentence | Court | Various offenses |
| Post-disposition | During probation/prison | Corrections | Serious offenses, healing |
| Post-release | After incarceration | Community | Reintegration |

### Case Selection Criteria

|--------|-------------|
| Offender accepts responsibility | Willing to acknowledge actions |
| Victim interest | Victim expresses willingness |
| Appropriate offense | Not precluded by policy |
