# Restorative Justice: Opposition

## Introduction

Despite growing evidence of effectiveness and increasing adoption, restorative justice faces significant opposition from various quarters. Understanding these objections—their sources, their validity, and how to address them—is essential for advocates seeking to expand restorative approaches. This document examines opposition arguments, their proponents, and strategies for response.

## Categories of Opposition

### Philosophical Opposition

#### Retributive Justice Advocates

Some genuinely believe punishment is the appropriate response to wrongdoing.

**Core Argument**: Crime deserves punishment. Justice means offenders get what they deserve. Restorative justice is fundamentally unjust because it doesn't ensure proportional punishment.

| Proponent | Position | Influence |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| Retributivist philosophers | Punishment is intrinsically just | Academic, some legal |
| "Tough on crime" advocates | Punishment deters and incapacitates | Political, public |
| Some victim advocates | Offenders must suffer | Advocacy, political |
| Law-and-order politicians | Soft approaches endanger public | Political, legislative |

**Response Points**
- Retribution doesn't repair harm
- Evidence shows punishment doesn't deter effectively
- Victims often prefer RJ outcomes
- RJ includes accountability, just defined differently

#### Concerns About Justice and Fairness

Critics argue RJ may undermine fundamental justice principles.

| Concern | Description | Response |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Consistency | Similar cases may get very different outcomes | Community-determined justice; current system also inconsistent |
| Proportionality | Serious crimes may get "light" responses | RJ outcomes often more demanding than probation |
| Desert | Some offenders don't deserve mercy | RJ isn't about mercy; it's about healing and accountability |
| Equality | RJ may favor articulate, sympathetic offenders | Valid concern requiring attention to equity |

### Victim-Centered Opposition

#### Traditional Victim Advocacy Groups

Some victim advocates oppose RJ based on victim protection concerns.

**National Organization for Victim Assistance (NOVA) Concerns**
- Risk of retraumatization
- Pressure on victims to participate
- Minimization of offense seriousness
- Offender benefit over victim healing

**Parents of Murdered Children (POMC) Concerns**
- RJ inappropriate for violent crime
- Survivors should focus on own healing
- Offenders don't deserve contact
- Forgiveness shouldn't be expected

**Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) Position**
- Victim Impact Panels (controlled encounter) acceptable
- Full victim-offender dialogue concerning
- System accountability must remain

**Response Strategies**

| Concern | Response |
|---------|----------|
| Retraumatization | Careful preparation, trained facilitators, voluntary participation |
| Pressure | Genuine voluntariness, multiple contacts to confirm, right to withdraw |
| Minimization | RJ can be more demanding than traditional outcomes |
| Offender-centered | Victim needs drive process; victim satisfaction higher |

#### Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Advocates

Opposition is strongest regarding intimate partner violence and sexual assault.

**Specific Concerns**

| Concern | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Power imbalance | Abuser may manipulate process |
| Coercion | Victim may be coerced to participate |
| Community bias | Community may side with abuser |
| Minimization | RJ may treat violence as "conflict" |
| Safety | Process may endanger victim |
| Pattern behavior | DV/SA aren't one-time incidents |

**Debate Within Field**

| Position | Advocates |
|----------|-----------|
| RJ never appropriate for DV/SA | Many DV advocates, some RJ practitioners |
| RJ can work with extensive safeguards | Restorative Response Baltimore, COSA programs |
| Victim should have option | Some survivor-advocates |
| Alternative accountability needed | Some survivors of DV who rejected criminal system |

### Law Enforcement Opposition

#### Police Concerns

| Concern | Description | Validity |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Authority | RJ undermines police role | Reflects role definition, not evidence |
| Deterrence | RJ won't deter crime | Evidence doesn't support punishment deterrence either |
| Public safety | RJ releases dangerous people | RJ is for appropriate cases; risk assessment matters |
| Accountability | RJ is "letting off" | RJ accountability can be more meaningful |
| Workload | RJ requires different effort | May actually reduce repeat calls |

**Police Union Positions**

Most police unions have not taken formal positions on RJ, but generally:
- Skeptical of alternatives to arrest
- Concerned about "handcuffing" officer discretion
- Worried about blame for crime increases
- Some openness to youth diversion

#### Prosecutor Opposition

District attorneys are often the most significant obstacles to RJ expansion.

**Prosecutor Concerns**

| Concern | Description | Analysis |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Accountability | RJ doesn't ensure consequences | RJ outcomes often more demanding |
| Victim wishes | Some victims want prosecution | Valid; but RJ should be option |
| Precedent | RJ creates expectation of leniency | Selective case referral addresses this |
| Public safety | Some offenders need incarceration | Appropriate case selection essential |
| Due process | RJ may bypass protections | RJ should supplement, not replace options |
| Metrics | Conviction rates affected | Need different success measures |

**Variation Among Prosecutors**

| Type | Stance on RJ |
|------|--------------|
| "Progressive" DAs | Often supportive, implementing programs |
| Traditional DAs | Generally skeptical |
| Career prosecutors | Varies by individual |
| Elected vs. appointed | Elected may be more responsive to public opinion |

| Concern | Description | Response |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Authority | Diminished judicial role | Judges can refer to RJ, retain oversight |
| Consistency | Unpredictable outcomes | Judges already exercise discretion |
