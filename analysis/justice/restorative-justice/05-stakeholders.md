# Restorative Justice: Stakeholders

## Introduction

Restorative justice fundamentally reimagines who matters in addressing harm. While the traditional system centers the state and legal professionals, restorative approaches recognize multiple stakeholders with legitimate interests in how harm is addressed. Understanding these stakeholders—their needs, concerns, and potential roles—is essential for effective implementation.

## Primary Stakeholders

### Victims/Survivors of Harm

Those who have experienced harm are the most essential stakeholders, yet are most often marginalized in traditional processes.

**Victim Needs**

| Need Category | Specific Needs | How RJ Addresses |
|---------------|----------------|------------------|
| Information | What happened? Why? Who is responsible? | Direct dialogue with offender |
| Voice | Opportunity to express impact, ask questions | Central role in process |
| Validation | Recognition that harm occurred, wasn't deserved | Community witnesses, offender acknowledgment |
| Restitution | Material repair of losses | Agreements include specific amends |
| Safety | Assurance harm won't recur | Safety planning, community monitoring |
| Support | Assistance through healing process | Community involvement, resources |
| Control | Choice about participation, outcomes | Voluntary process, victim-driven |

**Victim Diversity**

Victims are not monolithic; their needs and preferences vary:

| Factor | Impact on RJ Preferences |
|--------|-------------------------|
| Offense type | Property crime victims more likely to want restitution; violent crime victims may prioritize answers, apology |
| Relationship to offender | Known offenders may make dialogue more or less appealing |
| Cultural background | Different traditions shape expectations |
| Prior trauma | May affect ability to participate |
| Time since offense | Readiness changes over time |
| Support system | Affects capacity to engage |

**Victim Concerns About RJ**

- Fear of retraumatization
- Worry about pressure to forgive
- Skepticism about offender sincerity
- Concern that RJ is "soft" on offenders
- Uncertainty about their role

### People Who Have Caused Harm (Offenders)

Those responsible for harm have needs and potential contributions often ignored by punitive systems.
