# Restorative Justice: History

## Introduction

The history of restorative justice is both ancient and modern. While the contemporary restorative justice movement emerged in the 1970s, its core principles—repairing harm, restoring relationships, and involving communities in addressing wrongdoing—have roots stretching back millennia across virtually every human culture. Understanding this history illuminates both the revolutionary and the deeply traditional nature of restorative approaches.

## Indigenous Foundations

### North American Indigenous Traditions

Long before European colonization, Indigenous peoples across North America maintained sophisticated systems for addressing harm and maintaining social order:

**Navajo Peacemaking (Hózhǫ́ǫ́jí Naat'aanii)**
- Focus on restoring harmony (hózhó) rather than punishment
- Peacemakers guide discussions, do not impose decisions
- Extended family and clan involvement
- No concept of "guilty" or "innocent"—focus on what happened and what's needed
- Ceremony and prayer integral to process
- Ongoing tradition maintained for centuries

**Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) Condolence Ceremonies**
- Addressed harm through ritual mourning and gift-giving
- Wampum belts recorded agreements and maintained peace
- Great Law of Peace emphasized reconciliation
- Clan mothers held significant authority in justice matters

**Pacific Northwest Potlatch Systems**
- Redistribution of resources addressed imbalances
- Public witnessing of wrongdoing and repair
- Status restoration through gift-giving
- Community feasting sealed reconciliation

| Tribal Nation/Region | Key Practice | Central Principle |
|---------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Navajo | Peacemaking | Restore harmony (hózhó) |
| Haudenosaunee | Condolence/Requickening | Clear minds, restore peace |
| Lakota | Talking circles | All voices heard equally |
| Cherokee | Council process | Community consensus |
| Tlingit | Potlatch | Balance through giving |
| Ojibwe | Healing circles | Connection to spirit |

### Global Indigenous Traditions

Similar practices existed across cultures worldwide:

**Maori (New Zealand)**
- Hui: Community gatherings to address wrongdoing
- Whakapapa: Genealogical connections emphasize relationships
- Mana: Honor and respect guide responses
- Utu: Balance and reciprocity in addressing harm

**Aboriginal Australia**
- Payback: Structured processes for addressing wrongs
- Elders mediate disputes
- Dreamtime law guides appropriate responses
- Community involvement essential

**African Traditions**
- Ubuntu philosophy: "I am because we are"
- Gacaca courts (Rwanda): Community tribunals
- Palaver: West African community conflict resolution
- Truth-telling and reconciliation embedded in culture

## Pre-Modern Western Practices

### Ancient and Medieval Systems

Before the rise of the state-centered justice system, Western societies also employed more community-based approaches:

**Germanic/Anglo-Saxon Traditions**
- Wergild: Compensation payments for harm
- Moot courts: Community assemblies for disputes
- Emphasis on restitution rather than punishment
- Victim families central to process

**Roman and Canon Law**
- Composition: Negotiated settlement of claims
- Penance: Acknowledgment and repair of wrongdoing
- Church courts often focused on reconciliation

**Medieval Community Justice**
- Frankpledge system: Mutual responsibility groups
- Arbitration by respected community members
- Public apology and restitution common
- Execution and imprisonment relatively rare

### Transition to State-Centered Justice

The gradual shift from victim-centered to state-centered justice occurred over centuries:

| Period | Development | Impact |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| 11th-12th century | Norman conquest introduces royal courts | Crime becomes offense against king |
| 13th century | Expansion of royal jurisdiction | Victims lose control of cases |
| 14th-15th century | Rise of professional prosecutors | Community role diminishes |
| 16th-17th century | State punishment increases | Prisons, corporal punishment expand |
| 18th century | Enlightenment reform | Punishment rationalized but still state-centered |
| 19th century | Prison system institutionalized | Rehabilitation as state function |

## Lessons from History

### What History Teaches

1. **Restorative approaches are not new**: They represent the dominant mode of human conflict resolution throughout history
2. **State punishment is the innovation**: The punitive paradigm is historically recent
3. **Indigenous wisdom matters**: Traditional practices offer tested alternatives
4. **Context shapes practice**: Effective approaches adapt to cultural settings
5. **Change is possible**: Justice systems have transformed before and can again

### Historical Cautions

1. **Romanticizing the past**: Traditional systems had their own problems
2. **Colonial appropriation**: Risk of extracting Indigenous practices without attribution
3. **Power dynamics**: Historical systems often reinforced existing hierarchies
4. **Enforcement**: Community-based systems required community cohesion that may not exist today
