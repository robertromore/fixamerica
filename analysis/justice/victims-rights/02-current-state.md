# Victims' Rights and Services: Current State

## Current Victim Services Landscape

### Federal Framework

The federal government provides the backbone of victim services funding and policy through several key mechanisms:

#### Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) Fund

The Crime Victims Fund, established by VOCA in 1984, is the primary federal funding source for victim services. Unlike most federal programs, it is funded not by taxpayer dollars but by criminal fines, forfeitures, and special assessments.

| VOCA Fund Component | Annual Allocation (FY 2024) |
|---------------------|----------------------------|
| Victim Compensation Grants | $150 million |
| Victim Assistance Grants | $1.2 billion |
| Tribal Victim Assistance | $100 million |
| National Scope Programs | $50 million |
| FBI Victim Assistance | $32 million |
| **Total** | **~$1.5 billion** |

**Critical Trend**: The VOCA Fund balance has declined from $13 billion in 2018 to under $3 billion in 2024, primarily due to:
- Shift toward deferred prosecution agreements that bypass the fund
- Corporate penalties paid to other accounts
- Non-prosecution agreements with major financial institutions

#### Office for Victims of Crime (OVC)

OVC administers VOCA funds and provides:
- State formula grants for compensation and assistance
- Discretionary grants for innovation and training
- Technical assistance to victim service providers
- National resource development

#### Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) Programs

VAWA provides additional funding streams:

| VAWA Program | Annual Funding | Focus |
|--------------|----------------|-------|
| STOP Formula Grants | $215 million | State and local DV/SA programs |
| Transitional Housing | $43 million | Housing for DV survivors |
| Legal Assistance | $45 million | Civil legal services |
| Court Training | $5 million | Judicial education |
| Culturally Specific Services | $15 million | Underserved populations |

#### Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (FVPSA)

FVPSA provides approximately $230 million annually for:
- Domestic violence shelters
- National DV Hotline
- State domestic violence coalitions
- Community-based prevention

### State-Level Infrastructure

#### Victim Compensation Programs

All 50 states, DC, and US territories operate victim compensation programs:

| Component | Typical Structure |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Funding Sources | State funds, VOCA match, court fees, offender fines |
| Maximum Awards | $10,000 - $100,000 (median $25,000) |
| Covered Expenses | Medical, counseling, lost wages, funeral |
| Exclusions | Property crimes, victims with felony records (some states) |
| Application Deadline | 1-3 years from crime date |
| Processing Time | 30-180 days |

**Compensation Program Challenges**:
- Many states exhausted funds by mid-fiscal year in 2023-2024
- Average award covers only 30-40% of actual victim costs
- Application denial rates range from 20% to 60% by state
- Property crime victims almost universally excluded

#### State Constitutional Amendments

37 states have constitutional amendments guaranteeing victim rights:

| Right | States Guaranteeing |
|-------|---------------------|
| Notification of proceedings | 37 |
| Right to be present | 35 |
| Right to be heard | 36 |
| Protection from defendant | 30 |
| Speedy trial | 25 |
| Restitution | 28 |
| Standing to enforce | 12 |

**Marsy's Law States**: 12 states have adopted comprehensive Marsy's Law amendments providing expanded rights, though implementation and enforcement remain uneven.

### Service Provider Network

#### Types of Victim Service Organizations

| Organization Type | Number | Primary Services |
|-------------------|--------|------------------|
| Prosecutor-based | 2,500+ | Case notification, court accompaniment |
| Law enforcement-based | 1,500+ | Crisis response, immediate assistance |
| Community-based nonprofits | 4,000+ | Counseling, advocacy, shelter |
| Hospital-based | 800+ | SANE exams, medical advocacy |
| Campus-based | 2,000+ | Student victim services |
| Tribal programs | 200+ | Culturally-specific services |

Most victim service programs offer:
- Crisis intervention and 24-hour hotlines
- Safety planning
- Court accompaniment and case notification
- Assistance with compensation claims
- Emergency financial assistance
- Counseling referrals or direct services

| Domestic violence victims | 15-20% |
| Sexual assault victims | 10-15% |
| Homicide survivors | 30-40% |
| Child abuse victims | 25-35% |
| Assault victims | 5-10% |
| Property crime victims | 2-5% |

| Lack of awareness | 70% of victims don't know services exist |
| Geographic gaps | Rural areas have 1/10th urban service levels |
| Language barriers | 20% of potential clients need non-English services |

| Transportation | 30% cite as barrier to accessing services |
| Childcare | 25% cite as barrier |
| Work schedules | 35% cannot access during business hours |

### Funding Reality

#### The VOCA Crisis

The dramatic decline in VOCA funding represents an existential threat to victim services:

| Year | VOCA Fund Deposits | Authorized Release |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 2018 | $2.8 billion | $4.4 billion |
| 2019 | $2.0 billion | $3.3 billion |
| 2020 | $1.8 billion | $2.6 billion |
| 2021 | $1.6 billion | $2.3 billion |
| 2022 | $1.4 billion | $1.9 billion |
| 2023 | $1.3 billion | $1.6 billion |
| 2024 | $1.2 billion | $1.5 billion |

**VOCA Fix Act**: The 2021 VOCA Fix Act expanded deposits by including deferred and non-prosecution agreement penalties, but deposits remain below historical levels.

#### State Funding Variations

| State Funding Level | Example States | Per Capita Spending |
|--------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| High | California, New York, Texas | $8-12/resident |
| Medium | Florida, Ohio, Illinois | $4-7/resident |
| Low | Mississippi, Wyoming, Arkansas | $1-3/resident |

### Current Policy Debates

#### Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA) Enforcement

The federal CVRA provides eight enumerated rights but enforcement remains problematic:
- Victims cannot delay proceedings to seek mandamus relief
- Rights apply only in federal cases (small fraction of all crimes)
- No damages remedy for rights violations
- Courts inconsistently apply provisions

#### Victim Participation in Plea Negotiations

Growing movement to include victims earlier in the process:
- Some jurisdictions now require victim consultation before plea offers
- Victims cannot veto pleas but can express preferences
- Tension with prosecutorial discretion

#### Restorative Justice Integration

States increasingly incorporating restorative approaches:
- 45 states authorize victim-offender dialogue in some form
- 12 states allow restorative justice as sentencing alternative
- Victim participation remains voluntary
- Outcomes show high victim satisfaction (85%+)

#### Trauma-Informed Practices

Growing recognition that systems must adapt:
- Training programs expanding for prosecutors, law enforcement
- Courtroom accommodations increasing (support dogs, screens)
- Interview protocols reducing re-traumatization
- Universal screenings at service entry points

### Special Populations: Current Status

#### Immigrant Victims

| Challenge | Current Response |
|-----------|------------------|
| Fear of deportation | U-visa and T-visa protections |
| Language barriers | Limited interpretation services |
| Unfamiliarity with system | Community-based outreach |
| VAWA self-petition | Backlogs exceeding 5 years |
| Public charge concerns | Confusion limits service seeking |

#### LGBTQ+ Victims

| Challenge | Current Response |
|-----------|------------------|
| Provider competency gaps | Training initiatives expanding |
| Lack of LGBTQ+ specific services | 15 dedicated programs nationwide |
| Shelter access for trans individuals | Improving but inconsistent |
| IPV not recognized | Growing awareness |
| Hate crimes underreporting | Enhanced outreach efforts |

#### Homeless Victims

| Challenge | Current Response |
|-----------|------------------|
| Address requirements | Waivers available but not universal |
| Documentation difficulties | Alternative verification methods |
| Distrust of authorities | Street outreach programs |
| Competing survival needs | Comprehensive service models |
