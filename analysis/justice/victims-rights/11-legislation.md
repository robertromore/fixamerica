"(8) STAY PENDING REVIEW.—Upon motion by a victim seeking enforcement of rights under this section, the court may stay proceedings for a reasonable period not to exceed 72 hours to permit the victim to seek appellate review, where such stay would not substantially prejudice the defendant's right to a speedy trial."

SEC. 4. DAMAGES REMEDY.

(a) IN GENERAL.—Section 3771 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:

"(g) DAMAGES.—

"(1) CIVIL ACTION.—A victim whose rights under subsection (a) are violated by a government official or entity may bring a civil action in the appropriate district court for declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and damages.
