# Victims' Rights and Services: History

## The Victims' Rights Movement: 1970s to Present

### Pre-Movement Era (Before 1965)

Before the modern victims' rights movement, crime victims occupied a marginal position in the American justice system:

| Era | Victim's Role |
|-----|---------------|
| Colonial Period | Victims prosecuted their own cases; private prosecution model |
| 19th Century | Public prosecutors replaced victims; victims became witnesses only |
| Early 20th Century | Focus on offender rehabilitation; victims largely ignored |
| 1950s-1960s | Rising crime rates; no systematic victim services |

**Key Characteristics of Pre-Movement Era**:
- No formal notification of case status
- No right to be present at proceedings
- No input into sentencing
- No financial assistance programs
- Victims treated primarily as evidence sources

### Origins of the Movement (1965-1975)

The victims' rights movement emerged from multiple converging social forces:

#### 1965: First Victim Compensation Programs

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1963 | New Zealand creates world's first victim compensation program |
| 1965 | California becomes first US state with compensation program |
| 1966 | New York follows with compensation legislation |
| 1967 | President's Crime Commission acknowledges victim needs |
| 1968 | Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts add programs |

#### Feminist Movement Impact

The women's movement fundamentally shaped victim advocacy:

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1971 | First rape crisis center opens (San Francisco) |
| 1972 | First battered women's shelters established |
| 1973 | National Organization for Women creates rape task force |
| 1974 | LEAA funds first victim-witness programs |
| 1975 | Susan Brownmiller's "Against Our Will" published |

#### Law and Order Politics

Conservative politics contributed different emphases:

- Focus on "forgotten victim" rhetoric
- Emphasis on defendant's rights as excessive
- Support for harsher sentences
- Victim as symbol of public safety concerns

### Building the Foundation (1975-1984)

#### Key Legislative Developments

| Year | Legislation/Development |
|------|------------------------|
| 1975 | First victim impact statement used (Fresno, CA) |
| 1976 | National Organization for Victim Assistance (NOVA) founded |
| 1978 | National Coalition Against Domestic Violence formed |
| 1979 | Frank Carrington founds Crime Victims Legal Advocacy Institute |
| 1980 | Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) founded |
| 1980 | Wisconsin passes first "Victim Bill of Rights" |
| 1981 | President Reagan declares National Victims' Rights Week |
| 1982 | President's Task Force on Victims of Crime releases report |

#### The 1982 President's Task Force

The Reagan Administration's Task Force on Victims of Crime represented a watershed moment:

**Key Recommendations**:
1. Constitutional amendment for victims' rights
2. Victim impact statements at sentencing
3. Victim compensation in all states
4. Abolition of parole (controversial)
5. Victim notification requirements
6. Restitution as mandatory consideration
7. Federal funding for victim programs

**Task Force Legacy**:
- Elevated victims' rights to national agenda
- Provided framework for subsequent legislation
- Created momentum for state constitutional amendments
- Established victim participation as legitimate goal

#### Victims of Crime Act (1984)

VOCA represented the most significant federal victims' rights legislation:

| VOCA Component | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| Crime Victims Fund | Collect criminal fines for victim services |
| State Compensation Grants | Support state compensation programs |
| State Assistance Grants | Fund victim service organizations |
| Federal Victim-Witness Coordinators | Mandate services in federal courts |

**VOCA's Genius**: Funding from offenders, not taxpayers, provided political insulation and philosophical coherence.

### Era of State Constitutional Amendments (1985-2000)

#### Wave of State Amendments

| Period | States Adopting Amendments |
|--------|---------------------------|
| 1985-1990 | California, Florida, Michigan, Rhode Island, Washington, Texas, Arizona, Colorado |
| 1991-1995 | Illinois, Maryland, Missouri, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Utah, Wisconsin, Kansas, Indiana, Virginia |
| 1996-2000 | Connecticut, Idaho, Louisiana, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee |

#### Common Rights in State Amendments

| Right | Prevalence |
|-------|------------|
| Notice of proceedings | Universal |
| Right to be present | Near-universal |
| Right to be heard at sentencing | Near-universal |
| Right to restitution | Majority |
| Protection from intimidation | Majority |
| Speedy resolution | Minority |
| Standing to enforce | Minority |

### Federal Legislative Progress (1990-2004)

#### Key Federal Laws

| Year | Legislation | Key Provisions |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| 1990 | Victims' Rights and Restitution Act | Federal victim rights in federal cases |
| 1990 | Hate Crime Statistics Act | Required hate crime data collection |
| 1994 | Violence Against Women Act | Comprehensive DV/SA legislation |
| 1994 | Violent Crime Control Act | Enhanced penalties, victim provisions |
| 1996 | Mandatory Victims' Restitution Act | Required restitution for federal violent crimes |
| 1996 | Antiterrorism Act | Enhanced terrorism victim rights |
| 1997 | Victims' Rights Clarification Act | Timothy McVeigh case response |
| 2000 | VAWA Reauthorization | Enhanced protections, new programs |
| 2004 | Crime Victims' Rights Act | Comprehensive federal victim rights |

#### The Crime Victims' Rights Act of 2004

The CVRA established eight enumerated rights for victims in federal criminal cases:

1. **Right to be reasonably protected** from the accused
2. **Right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice** of proceedings
3. **Right to be present** at public proceedings
4. **Right to be reasonably heard** at proceedings involving release, plea, sentencing, parole
5. **Right to confer with the prosecutor**
6. **Right to full and timely restitution**
7. **Right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay**
8. **Right to be treated with fairness** and respect for dignity and privacy

**CVRA Enforcement Innovation**: Created mechanism for victims to seek mandamus relief when rights violated—first such remedy in federal law.

### The Failed Federal Amendment (1996-2004)

#### Constitutional Amendment Efforts

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 1996 | Clinton endorses victims' rights amendment concept |
| 1997 | SJR 6 introduced in Senate (Kyl-Feinstein) |
| 1998 | House Judiciary Committee hearings |
| 1999 | Senate Judiciary Committee approval |
| 2000 | Amendment fails to reach floor |
| 2002 | Renewed amendment effort (SJR 35) |
| 2003 | Bush Administration endorsement |
| 2004 | Amendment abandoned; CVRA passed as alternative |

#### Amendment Text (Final Version)

> "A victim of violent crime shall have the right to reasonable notice of, and shall not be excluded from, public proceedings relating to the crime; to be heard at release, plea, sentencing, and parole proceedings; to reasonable conditions of release that give consideration to the safety of the victim; to restitution; to reasonable promptness in facing the accused in the criminal justice system; and to reasonable notice of the release or escape of the accused."

#### Reasons for Failure

| Opposition Argument | Source |
|--------------------||--------|
| Threatens defendants' rights | ACLU, NACDL |
| Federal intrusion on state courts | Federalism concerns |
| Undefined terms ("reasonable") | Legal scholars |
| Could delay justice | Defense bar |
| Statutory solution sufficient | Pragmatists |
| Cost concerns | Budget hawks |

### Marsy's Law Era (2008-Present)

#### Origins

Marsy's Law is named for Marsalee "Marsy" Nicholas, murdered in 1983 in California. Her family encountered the killer at a grocery store before learning of his release.

#### Marsy's Law Provisions

The comprehensive amendment includes:
- All rights in previous amendments
- Right to refuse interviews or depositions by defense
- Right to standing to enforce rights
- Right to attorney fees if rights violated
- Expansive definition of "victim"

#### State Adoption

| Year | State |
|------|-------|
| 2008 | California |
| 2014 | Illinois (rejected by voters) |
| 2016 | South Dakota (later struck down) |
| 2017 | Georgia (rejected by voters) |
| 2018 | Florida, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma |
| 2019 | Kentucky |
| 2020 | Pennsylvania (partial) |
| 2022 | Hawaii (rejected by voters) |

#### Marsy's Law Controversies

| Issue | Concern |
|-------|---------|
| Broad victim definition | Includes accusers, potentially enabling witness intimidation claims |
| Police as "victims" | Used to shield officer disciplinary records |
| Overly complex | Some amendments run many pages |
| Funding unfunded | Mandates without appropriations |
| Constitutional interpretation | Courts struggling with application |

### Recent Developments (2015-Present)

#### VOCA Funding Crisis

| Year | Crisis Development |
|------|-------------------|
| 2015 | Peak VOCA fund balance ($13 billion) |
| 2016-2018 | Deferred prosecution agreements bypass fund |
| 2019 | First significant funding reductions |
| 2020 | COVID-19 increases service demand while funding drops |
| 2021 | VOCA Fix Act passes (deposit expansion) |
| 2022-2024 | Deposits remain below historical averages |

#### Trauma-Informed Movement

Growing recognition of trauma's centrality:
- Training programs expanded
- ACE (Adverse Childhood Experiences) framework adopted
- Courtroom accommodations increased
- Universal screening implemented

#### Restorative Justice Integration

| Development | Trend |
|-------------|-------|
| Victim-offender dialogue programs | Expansion in 45 states |
| RJ as sentencing alternative | Growing adoption |
| Victim satisfaction research | Consistently positive findings |
| RJ in serious crimes | Careful expansion |

#### Technology Impact

| Technology | Application |
|------------|-------------|
| Automated notification systems | VINE (Victim Information and Notification Everyday) |
| Online compensation applications | 40+ states offer |
| Virtual court participation | COVID-19 accelerated |
| Digital protection orders | Enhanced accessibility |

### Lessons from History

#### What Worked

| Strategy | Outcome |
|----------|---------|
| Bipartisan coalition | Sustained progress over decades |
| State-by-state approach | Built momentum for federal action |
| Survivor-led advocacy | Authenticity and moral authority |
| VOCA funding structure | Politically durable funding |
| Incremental rights expansion | Avoided constitutional challenges |

#### What Didn't Work

| Approach | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| Federal constitutional amendment | Overreach triggered opposition |
| Unfunded mandates | Rights on paper, not in practice |
| Ignoring defense concerns | Created unnecessary enemies |
| One-size-fits-all approaches | Failed diverse victim needs |

#### Unfinished Business

| Issue | Status |
|-------|--------|
| Enforcement mechanisms | Still inadequate |
| Sustainable funding | Perpetual crisis |
| Underserved populations | Persistent gaps |
| Restitution collection | Fundamental failure |
| Systemic trauma | Ongoing problem |
