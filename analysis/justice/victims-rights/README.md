# Victims' Rights and Services: Overview

Victims' rights represent a fundamental but often overlooked pillar of the American justice system. While the Constitution explicitly protects the rights of the accused, crime victims historically had no formal standing in criminal proceedings. The victims' rights movement, emerging in the 1970s, has made significant strides in establishing legal protections and services for those harmed by crime. However, implementation remains inconsistent, funding chronically inadequate, and millions of victims—particularly from marginalized communities—continue to fall through the cracks of a system that struggles to balance the needs of victims with the constitutional rights of defendants.
