# Courts Reform: Legislation

## Overview

Court reform legislation addresses three critical areas: public defense funding and structure, bail and pretrial detention, and court access. State legislation is particularly important given that most criminal cases are in state courts. Federal legislation can provide funding, standards, and a model for states.

## Constitutional Amendments

### Right to Effective Counsel Amendment

**Purpose**: Strengthen Sixth Amendment to ensure meaningful representation.

**Draft Text**:

```text
Section 1. In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall
have effective assistance of counsel. No person shall be
convicted of any offense without representation by counsel
who has adequate time, resources, and training to provide
effective representation.

Section 2. Congress and the States shall ensure adequate
funding for the defense of persons unable to afford counsel,
at levels sufficient to provide effective assistance equal
to the resources available to the prosecution.

Section 3. Counsel shall have reasonable caseloads allowing
thorough investigation, preparation, and advocacy for each
client.

Section 4. Congress shall have power to enforce this article
by appropriate legislation.

Section 5. This article shall take effect two years after
ratification.
```

**Explanation**:

- Section 1 strengthens Sixth Amendment with "effective" standard
- Section 2 creates funding obligation with parity requirement
- Section 3 addresses caseload crisis directly
- Section 5 provides transition time

### Bail Reform Amendment

**Purpose**: Ensure pretrial detention based on risk, not wealth.

**Draft Text**:

```text
Section 1. Excessive bail shall not be required. No person
shall be detained pending trial solely due to inability
to pay a monetary condition of release.

Section 2. Pretrial detention may be ordered only upon clear
and convincing evidence that no conditions of release will
reasonably ensure the appearance of the person and the
safety of any other person and the community.

Section 3. Any person detained pretrial shall have a speedy
trial, in no event more than ninety days from initial
detention.

Section 4. Congress shall have power to enforce this article
by appropriate legislation.
```

**Explanation**:

- Section 1 prohibits wealth-based detention
- Section 2 requires high standard for any detention
- Section 3 ensures speedy trial for detained

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Caseload counting games | Exclude certain cases from count | High |
| Independence undermined | Pressure from courts, executive | Moderate |
| Risk assessment bias | Validated tools still biased | High |
| Speedy trial extensions | Routine "consent" to delay | Moderate |
| Detention workarounds | Charge manipulation for eligibility | Moderate |

### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Funding sustainability | Appropriations fluctuate | Political process |
| Quality measurement | Hard to ensure quality | Strickland standard |
| Implementation variation | Uneven across jurisdiction | Local discretion |
| Cultural change | Policy without culture | Institutional inertia |

### Rectification Procedures

1. **Caseload verification**: Independent audits of caseload counting; sanctions for manipulation.

2. **Independence protection**: Clear statutory independence; appointment procedures insulated from politics.

3. **Risk assessment monitoring**: Ongoing bias testing; human override requirement; disparity correction.

4. **Speedy trial enforcement**: No routine waivers; consequences for prosecution delay; defendant consent only with counsel advice.

5. **Anti-manipulation provisions**: Prohibit charging changes to achieve detention; original charge governs eligibility.

### General Implementation Concerns

- Phased implementation needed to build capacity
- Training required for all system actors
- Technology systems need updating
- Political will must be sustained
- Opposition will exploit any problems
