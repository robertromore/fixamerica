# Courts Reform: Overview

The American court system fails to deliver on the promise of equal justice. Public defenders labor under crushing caseloads, representing indigent defendants with a fraction of the resources available to prosecutors. Cash bail detains hundreds of thousands of legally innocent people solely because they are poor. Judicial elections create perverse incentives. Discovery rules favor the prosecution. The result is a system that processes people rather than adjudicates their cases—where 94-97% of convictions come from guilty pleas, many coerced by pretrial detention and the threat of harsh sentences.
