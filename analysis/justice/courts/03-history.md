# Courts Reform: History

## Right to Counsel

### English Origins

**Common Law**:

- No right to counsel in England until 19th century
- Felony defendants could not have lawyers
- Presumption courts would protect the innocent
- Colonial America inherited this tradition

**Early American Practice**:

- Some colonies allowed counsel
- Constitutional provisions varied
- Sixth Amendment: "Assistance of Counsel"
- Initially meant right to hire, not right to have

### Early Supreme Court

**Powell v. Alabama (1932)** - "Scottsboro Boys":

- Nine Black teenagers falsely accused of rape
- No meaningful defense provided
- Court: Due process requires counsel in capital cases
- Limited to capital cases, special circumstances

**Johnson v. Zerbst (1938)**:

- Right to counsel in federal criminal cases
- Could be waived only knowingly and intelligently
- Federal courts only

### Gideon and Aftermath

**Gideon v. Wainwright (1963)**:

- Clarence Earl Gideon: Accused of burglary in Florida
- Denied counsel, represented himself, convicted
- Handwritten petition to Supreme Court
- Unanimous decision: Sixth Amendment requires counsel in state felony cases

**Quote**: "In our adversary system of criminal justice, any person haled into court, who is too poor to hire a lawyer, cannot be assured a fair trial unless counsel is provided for him."

**Extension**:

| Case | Year | Extension |
|------|------|-----------|
| *Douglas v. California* | 1963 | Appeals |
| *Argersinger v. Hamlin* | 1972 | Misdemeanors with imprisonment |
| *Scott v. Illinois* | 1979 | Only if actually imprisoned |

### Quality of Counsel

**Strickland v. Washington (1984)**:

- Two-part test for ineffective assistance
- Performance must be deficient AND prejudicial
- Extremely deferential to attorneys
- Result: Almost impossible to prove ineffective assistance

**Consequence**: Constitutional floor so low it's rarely violated

### Public Defense Development

**Post-Gideon Systems**:

| Era | Development |
|-----|-------------|
| 1960s-70s | Public defender offices created |
| 1980s | Growth, but underfunding begins |
| 1990s | Crime wave, caseloads explode |
| 2000s | Crisis recognized; little action |
| 2010s | Reform efforts, continued underfunding |

## Bail History

### English Origins

**Medieval England**:

- Bail as guarantee of appearance
- Sheriffs had discretion
- Abuses led to reforms

**Statute of Westminster (1275)**:

- Defined bailable and non-bailable offenses
- Limit on sheriff discretion
- Foundation for later law

### American Development

**Colonial and Early Republic**:

- Eighth Amendment: "Excessive bail shall not be required"
- Right to bail for non-capital offenses
- Cash bail system develops
- Commercial bail bonds emerge

**Stack v. Boyle (1951)**:

- Bail must be set to ensure appearance
- Cannot be used for preventive detention
- But: No right to affordable bail

### Pretrial Detention

**Bail Reform Act of 1966**:

- Presumption of release in federal cases
- Non-financial conditions preferred
- Focused on appearance, not dangerousness

**Bail Reform Act of 1984**:

- Allowed preventive detention for dangerousness
- Major shift in federal practice
- States followed with similar laws

**United States v. Salerno (1987)**:

- Preventive detention constitutional
- Government interest in preventing crime
- Due process satisfied by hearings

### Money Bail Evolution

**Commercial Bail Industry**:

| Era | Development |
|-----|-------------|
| Early 1900s | Commercial bail bonds begin |
| Mid-20th century | Industry grows |
| 1970s-80s | Most countries ban; U.S. keeps |
| 1990s-2000s | Industry consolidates, lobbies |
| 2010s-present | Reform movement; industry fights back |

**Unique to U.S.**: Only two countries (U.S. and Philippines) allow commercial bail bonds

### Modern Bail Reform

**Vera Institute Manhattan Bail Project (1961)**:

- Demonstrated release on recognizance worked
- Most defendants appeared without money bail
- Model for pretrial services
- Inspired Bail Reform Act of 1966

**Recent Reform Wave**:

| Year | Development |
|------|-------------|
| 2014-15 | Racial justice movement highlights bail |
| 2017 | New Jersey bail reform |
| 2018 | California SB 10 (later repealed) |
| 2019 | New York bail reform (partially rolled back) |
| 2021 | Illinois SAFE-T Act |

## Plea Bargaining

### Origins

**19th Century**:

- Plea bargaining emerges informally
- Initially condemned by courts
- Growing caseloads make it necessary
- By late 1800s, common in urban courts

**Early 20th Century**:

- Controversy over "bargain justice"
- Crime commissions criticize practice
- But caseloads continue to grow
- Plea bargaining becomes standard

### Supreme Court Recognition

**Brady v. United States (1970)**:

- Guilty pleas not inherently coerced
- Voluntary if defendant understands consequences
- Opened door to expanded plea bargaining

**Santobello v. New York (1971)**:

- Plea bargaining "essential component" of criminal justice
- Prosecutors must keep promises
- Legitimized the practice

### Expansion and Entrenchment

**Post-1970s**:

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Mandatory minimums | Increased leverage for prosecutors |
| Sentencing guidelines | Made outcomes more predictable |
| Growing caseloads | Made trials impractical |
| Underfunded defense | Made fighting cases difficult |

**Trial Penalty Growth**:

- Sentences after trial increasingly harsh
- Plea offers increasingly good compared to trial risk
- Trial becomes irrational for most defendants
- System depends on pleas
