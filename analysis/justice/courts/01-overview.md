# Courts Reform: Overview

## Executive Summary

The American court system fails to deliver on the promise of equal justice. Public defenders labor under crushing caseloads, representing indigent defendants with a fraction of the resources available to prosecutors. Cash bail detains hundreds of thousands of legally innocent people solely because they are poor. Judicial elections create perverse incentives. Discovery rules favor the prosecution. The result is a system that processes people rather than adjudicates their cases—where 94-97% of convictions come from guilty pleas, many coerced by pretrial detention and the threat of harsh sentences.

Reform requires adequately funding public defense, eliminating wealth-based pretrial detention, opening discovery, and ensuring courts serve justice rather than efficiency.

## Scope

### What This Subtopic Covers

- **Public Defense**: Funding, caseloads, quality, structure
- **Bail and Pretrial Detention**: Cash bail, risk assessment, pretrial services
- **Access to Justice**: Court fees, language access, disability access
- **Discovery**: Disclosure rules, Brady compliance
- **Plea Bargaining**: Coercion, judicial oversight, trial penalty
- **Judicial Selection**: Elections, appointments, accountability
- **Court Administration**: Technology, delays, backlogs

### What This Subtopic Does Not Cover

- Prosecutors (see [Prosecutors](../prosecutors/01-overview.md))
- Sentencing decisions (see [Sentencing](../sentencing/01-overview.md))
- Appellate courts and habeas corpus (see [Wrongful Convictions](../wrongful-convictions/01-overview.md))

## Key Questions

1. **Why is public defense so inadequate?** What causes chronic underfunding and how can it be fixed?

2. **Does cash bail serve any legitimate purpose?** What are the alternatives?

3. **Why do so few cases go to trial?** What pressures create the plea bargaining system?

4. **How should judges be selected?** What are the trade-offs between election and appointment?

5. **How can courts be made accessible?** What barriers prevent equal access to justice?

## Why This Matters

**Constitutional Right Denied**: Sixth Amendment right to counsel meaningless without adequate defense

**Innocent People Convicted**: Underfunding and plea pressure lead to wrongful convictions

**Wealth-Based Detention**: Poor people detained while wealthy go free regardless of risk

**System Legitimacy**: Courts that process rather than adjudicate undermine justice

**Racial Disparities**: All court dysfunctions fall disproportionately on people of color

## Key Statistics

| Metric | Data |
|--------|------|
| Conviction rate in federal courts | 99.8% |
| Guilty pleas (state) | 94-97% |
| Public defender average caseload | 500-1,000+ |
| Recommended maximum felony caseload | 150 |
| Pretrial detainees | ~470,000 |
| States with no state funding for public defense | 21 |
| Average public defense spending per case | $200-300 |

## The Problem in Context

### The Right to Counsel

**Gideon v. Wainwright (1963)**:

- Established right to counsel for felonies
- Extended to misdemeanors resulting in imprisonment
- Promise remains largely unfulfilled

**Reality**:

- Underfunded, overworked public defenders
- Caseloads 4-8x recommendations
- Minutes per case instead of hours
- Meet-and-plead instead of investigation

### Cash Bail

**Theory**: Ensure appearance at trial

**Reality**:

- Wealth determines freedom
- 470,000+ in pretrial detention
- Pressure to plead guilty to get out
- Job loss, family disruption, housing loss
- Worse case outcomes for detained defendants
