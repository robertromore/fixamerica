# Courts Reform: Root Causes

## Public Defense Underfunding

### Structural Factors

**Local Funding Model**:

| Problem | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| County-by-county funding | Massive variation in quality |
| Competes with other services | Loses to police, prosecution, roads |
| Property tax base | Poor counties = poor defense |
| No constitutional minimum | Strickland standard too low |

**Political Incentives**:

- No constituency for public defense
- Defendants can't vote (many incarcerated/disenfranchised)
- "Tough on crime" politics
- Prosecutors have political influence; defenders don't

### Demand Factors

**Caseload Drivers**:

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Mass incarceration | More cases requiring defense |
| Overcriminalization | More offenses = more cases |
| Poverty | More indigent defendants |
| Immigration | Added deportation consequences |

**Supply Constraints**:

- Low pay compared to prosecutors
- Burnout and turnover
- Limited recruitment
- No career path comparable to prosecution

### Legal Factors

**Strickland's Low Bar**:

- Courts rarely find deficiency
- Prejudice nearly impossible to prove
- No structural remedy
- Underfunding not unconstitutional per se

**No Enforcement Mechanism**:

- Individual defendant must prove harm
- Class actions difficult
- No private right of action
- Political branches won't act

## Cash Bail System

### Economic Interests

**Bail Bond Industry**:

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| $2+ billion industry | Lobbying power |
| 10% fee profit | Business depends on cash bail |
| ALEC membership | Model legislation |
| Campaign contributions | Political influence |

**Opposition to Reform**:

- California Prop 25 defeat (industry spent millions)
- State-level lobbying
- Fear-based messaging
- Alliance with prosecutors

### Institutional Inertia

**Judges' Perspective**:

| Concern | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| Risk of release | Risk assessment can address |
| Accountability if released person offends | No accountability for detention harms |
| Change from practice | Training and support needed |

**Court Administration**:

- Cash bail is simple to administer
- Pretrial services require investment
- Risk assessment requires validation
- Change requires effort

### Legal Framework

**No Constitutional Floor**:

- No right to affordable bail
- Preventive detention allowed (*Salerno*)
- Due process satisfied by hearing
- Wealth discrimination permitted

## Plea Bargaining Pressure

### Prosecutor Power

**Charging Discretion**:

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Unreviewable decisions | Can charge whatever |
| Charge stacking | Multiple charges = pressure |
| Mandatory minimums | Prosecutor controls sentence |
| Discovery timing | Defendant doesn't know evidence |

**Trial Penalty**:

- Sentences after trial 2-10x plea offers
- Rational defendant must plead
- Even innocent defendants plead
- System designed for pleas

### Defense Weakness

**Resource Disparity**:

| Resource | Prosecution | Defense |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| Investigators | Many | Few or none |
| Experts | Funded | Often unfunded |
| Time | Adequate | Never enough |
| Support staff | Yes | Minimal |

**Structural Disadvantage**:

- Prosecution has police cooperation
- Defense must investigate independently
- Brady violations common, rarely punished
- Closed discovery in many jurisdictions

### Pretrial Detention

**Pressure to Plead**:

| Detained Defendant | Effect |
|-------------------|--------|
| Loses job | Desperation |
| Loses housing | Urgency to get out |
| Separated from family | Will plead to go home |
| Can't assist defense | Can't help find witnesses |
| Exposed to violence | Will do anything to leave |

**Rational Choice**:

- Plead guilty and go home today
- Fight case from jail for months
- Even innocent defendants choose plea

## Judicial Selection

### Election Problems

**Campaign Finance**:

| Factor | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Money from lawyers | Appearance of bias |
| Money from business interests | Bias toward those interests |
| Special interest spending | Outcomes influenced |

**Electoral Pressure**:

- Judges harsher before elections
- "Tough on crime" campaigns
- One-sided accountability (soft on crime attacks)
- No reward for fairness

### Appointment Problems

**Politicization**:

- Partisan appointments
- Ideological litmus tests
- Lack of diversity
- Professional networks dominate

### Lack of Accountability

**Once in Office**:

- Tenure (federal) or easy retention (state)
- Limited discipline
- Complaint processes opaque
- Performance not measured

## Court Access

### Poverty and Justice

**Financial Barriers**:

| Barrier | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| Filing fees | Can't access courts |
| Transcript costs | Can't appeal |
| Lost wages for court | Can't afford to participate |
| Transportation | Can't get to court |
| Childcare | Can't attend hearings |

**Punishment for Poverty**:

- Fines and fees accumulate
- Failure to pay = warrants
- Drivers license suspension = can't work
- Debtors' prison by another name

### Structural Access Barriers

**Language**:

- Limited interpreter availability
- Poor quality interpretation
- Documents in English only
- Complicated legal language

**Geography**:

- Court consolidation
- Rural areas underserved
- Transportation barriers
- Limited hours

**Technology Divide**:

- Online systems assume access
- Digital literacy required
- Remote hearings exclude some
- Technology as barrier not access

## Systemic Dynamics

### Reinforcing Cycles

```text
Underfunded defense → Poor representation →
Guilty pleas → No trials → No accountability →
System legitimized → No reform pressure
```

```text
Cash bail → Pretrial detention →
Job/housing loss → Plea to get out →
Conviction → More barriers → Poverty →
Next arrest → Cash bail
```

### Compound Effects

- Underfunding + caseloads = no defense
- Cash bail + poverty = pretrial detention
- Detention + weak defense = plea pressure
- Plea + no trial = no check on system
