# Opposition: Resistance to Mental Health Crisis Response Reform

## Understanding the Opposition

Reform of mental health crisis response—particularly shifting from police-led to civilian-led response—faces significant opposition from multiple quarters. This opposition ranges from principled disagreement to institutional self-interest to genuine safety concerns. Understanding these objections is essential for designing reforms that can overcome resistance.

## Categories of Opposition

### 1. Safety and Security Concerns

The most common objection to non-police mental health response focuses on safety.

| Argument | Response |
|----------|----------|
| "Mental health calls are dangerous" | Data shows most are not; CAHOOTS has operated safely for 35 years |
| "You can't predict violence" | True, but risk can be assessed; trained responders can identify escalation |
| "Unarmed responders will be hurt" | CAHOOTS has minimal injuries; selection criteria for calls matter |
| "Police are needed for safety" | Police presence often escalates; weapons increase lethality |
| "What about the 1% that are dangerous?" | Those calls still go to police; alternative response is for the 80%+ that aren't |

**Data Point**: CAHOOTS responds to 24,000+ calls annually with unarmed teams and requests police backup in less than 1% of cases.

### 2. Police Union Opposition

Police unions have been among the most vocal opponents of non-police crisis response in many cities.

| Union Concern | Underlying Interest |
|---------------|---------------------|
| "Our members handle these calls safely" | Defending current practice; avoiding criticism |
| "Alternative responders won't be safe" | Genuine concern and/or protecting turf |
| "This is defunding police" | Concern about budget shifts |
| "We should be consulted on police alternatives" | Maintaining influence |
| "Add co-responders, don't replace police" | Prefer expansion over replacement |

**Strategies Unions Use:**
- Public safety messaging
- Political pressure on elected officials
- Contract negotiations to limit changes
- Media campaigns
- Endorsement leverage in elections

### 3. Political Opposition

Mental health crisis response reform has become politically contentious in some contexts.

| Political Argument | Proponents |
|--------------------|------------|
| "This is about defunding police" | Conservative officials; some moderates |
| "Soft on crime" | Law-and-order advocates |
| "Government overreach" | Libertarian-leaning opposition to new programs |
| "Unproven experiments" | Risk-averse officials |
| "Police can do this if trained" | Those preferring CIT approach |

### 4. Fiscal and Bureaucratic Opposition

| Concern | Source |
|---------|--------|
| "We can't afford new programs" | Budget officials; fiscal conservatives |
| "Who will run this?" | Turf concerns across departments |
| "It will take years to implement" | Risk-averse administrators |
| "We need to study this more" | Delay tactics |
| "The liability is unclear" | City attorneys; risk managers |

### 5. 911 and Dispatch Concerns

911 centers and dispatchers have raised practical objections.

| Dispatch Concern | Reality |
|------------------|---------|
| "We can't tell which calls are safe" | True to a point; screening protocols exist |
| "What if we get it wrong?" | Liability concerns are legitimate; protocols needed |
| "Our technology can't do this" | Real limitation; CAD upgrades needed |
| "We need more training" | Valid; training and protocols required |
| "This is too complicated" | Change is hard; other cities have done it |

### 6. Hospital and Health System Concerns

Healthcare systems have expressed concerns about alternative response models.

| Hospital Concern | Context |
|------------------|---------|
| "Who pays for this?" | Reimbursement unclear for crisis services |
| "We can't accept drop-offs without ER clearance" | Medical protocols; liability |
| "Our ERs are already overwhelmed" | Legitimate capacity concern |
| "We don't have beds" | Bed shortage is real |

### 7. Treatment Advocacy Opposition

Some mental health advocates oppose reforms they see as insufficient or misguided.

| Perspective | Argument |
|-------------|----------|
| Treatment Advocacy Center | Focus should be on easier commitment; more beds; medication |
| Some family groups | Need more intervention, not less police |
| "Fuller Torrey" perspective | Prioritize treatment over autonomy; more coercion needed |

This wing argues that the problem is too little intervention, not too much police involvement.

### 8. Disability Rights Concerns

Some disability rights advocates have concerns about how reforms are designed.

| Concern | Context |
|---------|---------|
| Coerced treatment | New systems may still force treatment |
| Medicalization | Mental health response may pathologize |
| Decision-making authority | Who decides when someone needs intervention? |
| Community consent | Are affected communities designing the systems? |

## Responding to Opposition Arguments

### Safety Arguments

| Claim | Evidence-Based Response |
|-------|------------------------|
| "These calls are too dangerous" | 80%+ of mental health calls involve no violence; screening works |
| "CAHOOTS is lucky" | 35+ years across multiple cities; statistically valid |
| "Mentally ill are dangerous" | Violence rates comparable to general population when treated |
| "Police need to be there" | Police presence often escalates; unarmed response de-escalates |

### Political Arguments

| Claim | Response |
|-------|----------|
| "This is defunding police" | This is appropriate response; most police support reducing mental health burden |
| "Soft on crime" | Mental health crises are not crimes; diversion reduces recidivism |
| "Liberal experiment" | Republican sheriffs support reducing jail mental health populations |

### Fiscal Arguments

| Claim | Response |
|-------|----------|
| "Too expensive" | Alternatives cost fraction of police response; jail/ER costs reduced |
| "Can't afford both" | Reallocate existing spending; long-term savings |
| "Unproven" | 35+ years of CAHOOTS data; mental health court evidence strong |

### Practical Arguments

| Claim | Response |
|-------|----------|
| "Can't screen calls" | Other cities do it; protocols exist; technology available |
| "No workforce" | Invest in training; peer specialists; career pathways |
| "No infrastructure" | Build it; phased implementation |
| "Takes too long" | Urgency of current deaths; start somewhere |

## Overcoming Opposition

### Political Strategies

| Strategy | Application |
|----------|-------------|
| Build unusual coalitions | Sheriffs + reform advocates; fiscal conservatives + progressives |
| Use data | Cost savings; outcome improvements; safety records |
| Start small | Pilot programs; prove concept before scaling |
| Engage affected communities | Center people with lived experience |
| Neutralize unions | Address legitimate concerns; find common ground |
| Frame appropriately | "Appropriate response" not "defund"; "safety" not "police alternatives" |

### Implementation Strategies

| Strategy | Application |
|----------|-------------|
| Involve police in design | Reduce opposition through participation |
| Address dispatcher concerns | Training; technology; protocols; gradual rollout |
| Create clear protocols | Who responds to what; when to escalate |
| Build infrastructure first | Crisis centers before alternative dispatch |
| Phase implementation | Geographic pilots; call type pilots |

### Messaging Strategies

| Audience | Message |
|----------|---------|
| General public | Safety; appropriate response; better outcomes |
| Police | Reduce burden; focus on crime; we'll take these calls |
| Fiscal conservatives | Cost savings; efficiency; reduced incarceration |
| Mental health advocates | Access to care; connection to services |
| Families | Safe response; help not handcuffs; treatment not jail |

## Case Study: Opposition in Practice

### Denver STAR Program

**Opposition Faced:**

- Dispatcher concerns about call screening
- General "defund" political environment

**How Opposition Was Addressed:**
- Started as small pilot in limited area
- Focused on calls police wanted off their plate
- Built data demonstrating safety and effectiveness
- Engaged dispatchers in protocol development
- Avoided "defund" framing

**Result:** Program expanded after successful pilot; union opposition diminished.

### Austin, Texas

**Opposition Faced:**
- Strong police union opposition
- Political polarization
- "Defund" controversy

**How Opposition Was Addressed:**
- Ballot measure for dedicated funding
- Community organizing and engagement
- Data on police mental health call burden

**Result:** Voters approved funding; implementation ongoing despite continued union opposition.
