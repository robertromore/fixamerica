# Mental Health Crisis Response and Justice System Diversion

## Executive Summary

The intersection of mental health crises and the criminal justice system represents one of America's most pressing social failures. When individuals experience psychiatric emergencies, the default response in most communities is armed police officers rather than mental health professionals. This systemic mismatch has transformed jails and prisons into the nation's largest mental health facilities and resulted in thousands of preventable deaths.

Approximately 2 million people with serious mental illness are booked into jails each year. Nearly 1 in 5 people in jails and 1 in 7 people in prisons have a serious mental illness. Meanwhile, an estimated 1,000 people experiencing mental health crises are killed by police annually, representing roughly 25% of all fatal police encounters.

This crisis stems from a half-century of failed policy: the deinstitutionalization of state psychiatric hospitals without adequate community-based alternatives, chronic underfunding of mental health services, and the default use of law enforcement to manage social problems beyond their training and mission.

Reform efforts offer proven alternatives. The CAHOOTS model in Eugene, Oregon demonstrates that unarmed crisis responders can safely handle the vast majority of mental health calls. Crisis Intervention Teams have improved police response. Mental health courts and diversion programs reduce recidivism and connect people to treatment. The launch of 988 as a national mental health crisis line provides infrastructure for transformation.

## Scope of This Analysis

This subtopic examines:

- Current crisis response systems and their failures
- The historical trajectory from deinstitutionalization to criminalization
- Alternative response models (non-police, co-responder, CIT)
- Diversion from the justice system at multiple intercept points
- Mental health treatment within jails and prisons
- Legal frameworks including competency and insanity
- Paths forward for systemic reform

## Core Problems

### 1. Armed Response to Health Emergencies

Police officers, trained primarily for law enforcement and public safety, are dispatched to respond to psychiatric emergencies. This creates inherent risk when symptoms of mental illness—agitation, paranoia, failure to comply with commands—conflict with police expectations for civilian behavior.

### 2. Deaths During Crisis Encounters

At least 1,000 people in mental health crisis are killed by police each year. Many more are injured, traumatized, or deterred from seeking help. High-profile deaths like those of Daniel Prude, Walter Wallace Jr., and countless others illustrate the lethal consequences of current systems.

### 3. Criminalization Instead of Treatment

Behaviors stemming from untreated mental illness—trespassing, disorderly conduct, minor theft—result in arrest and incarceration rather than treatment. This cycles people through jails repeatedly without addressing underlying conditions.

### 4. Jails as Default Mental Health Facilities

The Los Angeles County Jail, Cook County Jail, and Rikers Island are now the three largest mental health facilities in the United States. Jails are ill-equipped to provide psychiatric care and often exacerbate conditions through isolation, violence, and lack of treatment.

### 5. Inadequate Community Infrastructure

Decades of disinvestment have left communities without psychiatric beds, crisis stabilization centers, mobile crisis teams, and outpatient services. When crises occur, there is nowhere to take people except emergency rooms or jail.

### 6. Fragmented Systems

Mental health, law enforcement, emergency services, courts, corrections, and social services operate in silos without coordination. No single entity is responsible for ensuring people in crisis receive appropriate care.

### 7. Lack of Accountability

Deaths during mental health crisis encounters rarely result in consequences. Jails that fail to provide adequate mental health care face limited oversight. The system lacks mechanisms to track outcomes and drive improvement.

## The Case for Reform

Reforming mental health crisis response is not merely a matter of compassion—it is practical, cost-effective, and supported by evidence:

- **CAHOOTS** in Eugene, Oregon responds to 17% of 911 calls with unarmed teams at a fraction of police costs, calling for police backup in only 1% of calls
- **Mental health courts** reduce recidivism by 20-25% and produce net cost savings through reduced incarceration
- **Crisis stabilization centers** divert people from ERs and jails, providing appropriate care at lower cost
- **988** provides nationwide infrastructure for a transformed crisis response system

The solutions exist. What is required is political will, investment, and a fundamental rethinking of how society responds to mental health emergencies.
