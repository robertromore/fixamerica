# Root Causes: Why Police Respond to Mental Health Crises

## Understanding the Default

When someone calls 911 about a mental health emergency, armed police officers respond in nearly every American community. This is not the result of careful policy design. No legislative body ever determined that police should be psychiatric first responders. The current system exists because of multiple interacting failures that created a void which law enforcement filled by default.

## Primary Root Causes

### 1. Destruction of Psychiatric Infrastructure

| Era | Psychiatric Beds per 100,000 | Result |
|-----|------------------------------|--------|
| 1955 | 340 | Adequate capacity (though problematic conditions) |
| 1980 | 100 | Significant shortage emerging |
| 2000 | 30 | Severe shortage |
| 2016 | 11 | Critical shortage |
| Minimum needed | 40-60 | Gap of 30-50 beds per 100,000 |

The United States systematically eliminated psychiatric bed capacity without replacing it:

- **State hospital closures**: 95% of state hospital beds eliminated since 1955
- **Private hospital reductions**: Managed care incentivized shorter stays and fewer beds
- **General hospital psych units**: Many closed as unprofitable
- **Result**: No place to take people in crisis

### 2. Chronic Underfunding of Community Mental Health

Community mental health services were supposed to replace hospitals. They were never adequately funded.

| Funding Gap | Reality |
|-------------|---------|
| Community Mental Health Centers promised | 1,500+ |
| CMHCs fully built | ~700 |
| Federal funding for CMHCs | Cut 30% in 1981, never restored |
| State mental health budgets | Flat or declining in real terms |
| Medicaid mental health coverage | Limited, bureaucratic barriers |
| Insurance parity | Enacted 2008, still not fully implemented |

**What Doesn't Exist in Most Communities:**
- 24/7 mobile crisis teams
- Crisis stabilization centers (23-hour or short-term)
- Adequate outpatient capacity (months-long waits common)
- Assertive Community Treatment teams
- Peer support services
- Psychiatric urgent care
- Supportive housing with services

### 3. 911 as the Only Universal Emergency System

911 is the only emergency response system that exists universally, operates 24/7, and is legally obligated to respond.

| 911 System Reality | Implication |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Universal coverage | Available everywhere |
| 24/7/365 | Always staffed |
| Mandatory response | Cannot refuse a call |
| Training and dispatch | Not equipped for mental health triage |
| Default | If no one else exists, 911 responds |

**Why 911 Dispatches Police to Mental Health Calls:**
- No mental health responders available to dispatch
- Call-takers lack mental health training
- Liability concerns default to "officer safety"
- No screening tools to identify pure mental health calls
- "If in doubt, send police" culture

### 4. Police Scope Creep

Over decades, police have absorbed functions that other institutions abandoned.

| Function | Traditional Institution | Now Handled By |
|----------|------------------------|----------------|
| Psychiatric emergencies | Hospitals, clinics | Police |
| Homelessness | Social services | Police |
| School discipline | Schools | Police |
| Substance abuse | Treatment providers | Police |
| Domestic disputes | Social workers | Police |
| Neighborhood disputes | Community mediation | Police |

This expansion occurred without corresponding training, resources, or changes to police organizational culture.

### 5. Medicaid IMD Exclusion

A technical provision in federal law has had enormous consequences. Medicaid cannot pay for care in "Institutions for Mental Disease" (psychiatric facilities over 16 beds) for adults ages 21-64.

| IMD Exclusion Effects | Consequence |
|----------------------|-------------|
| State hospitals | Cannot receive Medicaid, so states closed them |
| Private psychiatric hospitals | Cannot build larger facilities |
| Crisis stabilization centers | Must stay under 16 beds |
| Result | No financial path to rebuild psychiatric capacity |

### 6. Housing Crisis Intersection

Mental illness and homelessness are deeply intertwined, and both end up in police encounters.

| Housing-Mental Health Connection | Data |
|---------------------------------|------|
| Seriously mentally ill who are homeless | 250,000+ |
| Homeless with any mental health condition | 30-40% |
| Severely mentally ill in jails who were homeless at arrest | 15-20% |
| Police contacts with homeless people | Millions annually |

Without housing, treatment is nearly impossible. Without treatment, housing is difficult to maintain. Police manage this intersection through arrest.

### 7. Substance Use and Co-Occurring Disorders

Mental illness and substance use disorders frequently co-occur, but systems treat them separately.

| Co-Occurring Disorders | Reality |
|------------------------|---------|
| Seriously mentally ill with substance use disorder | 50%+ |
| Substance users with mental health condition | 50%+ |
| Treatment systems | Separate, siloed |
| Insurance coverage | Different carve-outs |
| Police role | Primary responders to both |

When someone is in crisis involving both mental health and substance use, police are virtually certain to respond.

### 8. Legal and Liability Frameworks

Legal structures reinforce police as default responders.

| Legal Factor | Effect |
|--------------|--------|
| Civil commitment standards | Restrictive; hard to compel treatment |
| Duty to intervene | Police must respond; mental health providers may not |
| Malpractice liability | Providers avoid high-risk patients |
| Qualified immunity | Police protected from liability |
| Risk aversion | Systems default to "send police" |

### 9. Workforce Shortages

Even where services exist, there aren't enough providers.

| Mental Health Workforce | Reality |
|------------------------|---------|
| Psychiatrist shortage | 8,000+ deficit nationally |
| Psychiatry residency slots | Flat for decades |
| Counties with no psychiatrist | 60% |
| Mental health professional shortage areas | 6,000+ designated areas |
| Community mental health center turnover | 30-40% annually |
| Peer support specialists | Underpaid, underutilized |

### 10. Stigma and NIMBY

Community opposition blocks mental health infrastructure.

| Stigma Effects | Example |
|----------------|---------|
| Zoning restrictions | Block group homes, clinics |
| NIMBY opposition | Block crisis centers, housing |
| Political will | Elected officials avoid controversy |
| Self-stigma | Individuals avoid seeking help |
| Family denial | Delays intervention |

## Systemic Interactions

These root causes interact and reinforce each other:

```
Underfunding → No community services → Police respond by default
     ↓                    ↓                      ↓
No hospital beds → No place for drop-off → Arrest instead
     ↓                    ↓                      ↓
Jail as default → Release without treatment → Re-arrest
     ↓                    ↓                      ↓
Housing instability → Homelessness → More police contact
```

## Why Reform Is Difficult

| Barrier | Challenge |
|---------|-----------|
| Funding | Massive investment needed for alternative infrastructure |
| Workforce | Cannot quickly train thousands of crisis workers |
| Political will | Inertia favors status quo |
| Coordination | Multiple systems must change simultaneously |
| Local variation | 18,000 police departments, 3,000+ counties |
| Ideology | Some believe police should respond |
| Accountability | No entity responsible for system-wide change |

## The Path Forward Requires Addressing Root Causes

Surface-level reforms—training police better, adding co-responders—do not address root causes. Meaningful reform requires:

1. **Rebuilding mental health infrastructure**: Crisis centers, beds, mobile teams
2. **Changing 911 systems**: Alternative dispatch for mental health calls
3. **Creating new responder workforce**: Non-police crisis responders
4. **Fixing funding**: Medicaid reform, dedicated crisis funding
5. **Addressing housing**: Permanent supportive housing
6. **Integrating systems**: Mental health, substance use, housing, employment
7. **Reducing demand**: Prevention, early intervention, continuous care
