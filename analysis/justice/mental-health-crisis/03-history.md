# History: Deinstitutionalization to Criminalization

## Overview

The criminalization of mental illness in America is not an accident of history but the predictable result of deliberate policy choices. Over five decades, the nation systematically dismantled its psychiatric hospital system without building adequate community alternatives. The criminal justice system filled the void, transforming jails and prisons into the default mental health infrastructure.

## The Era of State Hospitals (1850-1955)

### Rise of the Asylum System

The 19th century saw construction of large state psychiatric hospitals based on the "moral treatment" philosophy—the belief that people with mental illness could recover in therapeutic environments.

| State Hospital Era | Key Features |
|--------------------|--------------|
| Philosophy | Moral treatment, recovery possible |
| Location | Rural, isolated campuses |
| Size | Eventually 1,000-10,000+ patients each |
| Funding | State governments |
| Conditions | Highly variable—some therapeutic, many custodial |

### Conditions Deteriorate

By the mid-20th century, state hospitals had become overcrowded warehouses. Investigative journalists and reformers documented abuses:

- Overcrowding (facilities at 200-300% capacity)
- Understaffing (1 doctor per hundreds of patients)
- Physical abuse and neglect
- Lack of treatment
- Unsanitary conditions
- Forced labor
- Use of restraints and seclusion

**Influential Exposés:**

- *The Shame of the States* (Albert Deutsch, 1948)
- *Christmas in Purgatory* (Burton Blatt, 1966)
- TV documentaries showing conditions

## Deinstitutionalization (1955-1980)

### The Perfect Storm

Multiple forces converged to empty state hospitals:

| Factor | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Thorazine (1954) | First antipsychotic medication; symptoms could be managed outside hospitals |
| Civil rights movement | Growing concern about civil liberties of confined persons |
| Fiscal pressure | States sought to reduce expensive hospital populations |
| Exposés | Public outrage at conditions |
| Legal decisions | Courts restricted involuntary commitment |
| Federal policy | Medicaid excluded state hospitals from funding |

### Community Mental Health Centers Act (1963)

President Kennedy signed legislation to fund community mental health centers as alternatives to state hospitals. The vision: a network of local facilities providing prevention, outpatient care, and crisis services.

| CMHC Act | Reality |
|----------|---------|
| Promised | 1,500+ community mental health centers |
| Delivered | ~700 partially funded centers |
| Promised | Comprehensive services |
| Delivered | Mostly outpatient only |
| Promised | Replace hospital functions |
| Delivered | Hospitals closed faster than centers opened |

### The Numbers

| Year | State Hospital Population | Community Infrastructure |
|------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| 1955 | 559,000 | Minimal |
| 1965 | 475,000 | CMHC program begins |
| 1975 | 193,000 | ~600 CMHCs |
| 1985 | 110,000 | Block grants cut funding |
| 1995 | 72,000 | Homelessness crisis visible |
| 2005 | 50,000 | Jails largest facilities |
| 2015 | 35,000 | 10x more in jails than hospitals |

### Legal Changes

Courts and legislatures dramatically restricted involuntary commitment:

| Case/Law | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (CA, 1967) | Model for restricting commitment to "danger to self/others" |
| O'Connor v. Donaldson (1975) | States cannot confine non-dangerous mentally ill persons |
| Addington v. Texas (1979) | Required "clear and convincing evidence" for commitment |
| State reforms | Most states adopted restrictive commitment standards |

**Before Reform:** Could commit for "need of treatment" or "unable to care for self"
**After Reform:** Must prove "imminent danger to self or others"

### The Medicaid Exclusion

A critical and often overlooked driver of deinstitutionalization: the 1965 Medicaid law excluded "Institutions for Mental Disease" (IMD) from federal funding.

| IMD Exclusion Effect | Result |
|----------------------|--------|
| State hospitals | No federal Medicaid dollars |
| Nursing homes | Could receive Medicaid |
| General hospitals | Could receive Medicaid |
| Jails | Not subject to exclusion |

States had financial incentive to discharge patients to nursing homes or streets—anywhere but state hospitals—to shift costs to federal government.

## The Reagan Era Cuts (1981)

### Dismantling the Community System

The 1980 Mental Health Systems Act, signed by President Carter, would have expanded community mental health infrastructure. President Reagan signed its repeal and replaced categorical mental health funding with block grants.

| Reagan Administration Impact | Effect |
|------------------------------|--------|
| Mental Health Systems Act | Repealed |
| Federal funding | Cut 30% |
| Block grants | States diverted funds elsewhere |
| Social Security disability | 500,000 mentally ill removed from rolls |
| Housing programs | Cut |

### Homelessness Emerges

The combination of hospital closures, funding cuts, and housing shortages produced visible homelessness among people with mental illness.

| Homelessness and Mental Illness | Estimates |
|---------------------------------|-----------|
| Homeless population 1980 | 200,000-300,000 |
| Homeless population 1990 | 600,000+ |
| Severely mentally ill among homeless | 20-30% |
| Substance use disorders among homeless | 30-40% |

## Transinstitutionalization: From Hospitals to Jails

### The Shift

As hospitals closed and community services failed to materialize, police became de facto psychiatric first responders, and jails became de facto psychiatric facilities.

| From | To |
|------|-----|
| State psychiatric hospital | County jail |
| Psychiatric emergency room | Police transport |
| Civil commitment | Criminal arrest |
| Patient | Inmate |
| Treatment | Incarceration |
| Discharge planning | Release to streets |

### The Numbers Tell the Story

| Year | In Psychiatric Hospitals | In Jails/Prisons | Ratio |
|------|--------------------------|------------------|-------|
| 1955 | 559,000 | Unknown | — |
| 1980 | 150,000 | ~100,000 | 1.5:1 |
| 2000 | 55,000 | ~300,000 | 1:5.5 |
| 2020 | 35,000 | ~400,000 | 1:11 |

### How Jails Became Mental Health Facilities

1. **Police encounter person in crisis** (disorderly conduct, trespassing, petty theft)
2. **No mental health facility available** for drop-off
3. **Emergency rooms refuse** or have long waits
4. **Arrest on minor charge** is easiest disposition
5. **Jail becomes holding facility** until court date
6. **Cycle repeats** with no treatment addressing underlying condition

## Police as Psychiatric Responders

### The Default Was Never Planned

No legislative body or policy institute ever designed or intended for police to become primary responders to mental health emergencies. It happened by default as other systems failed.

| Why Police Respond | Explanation |
|--------------------|-------------|
| 911 is universal | Only system available 24/7 everywhere |
| No alternative dispatched | Mental health responders don't exist most places |
| Broad authority | Police can take action in any situation |
| Legal liability | 911 centers defer to police for perceived safety |

### Fatal Consequences

From the beginning of deinstitutionalization, police encounters with mentally ill individuals have resulted in deaths. High-profile cases have periodically generated reform efforts:

| Decade | Notable Cases | Reform Response |
|--------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1980s | Joseph DeWayne Robinson (Memphis, 1987) | CIT program created |
| 1990s | Numerous cases | CIT expansion |
| 2000s | Numerous cases | Some co-responder programs |
| 2010s | Keith Vidal, Ethan Saylor, many others | Growing movement for alternatives |
| 2020s | Daniel Prude, Walter Wallace Jr., many others | CAHOOTS replication, 988, calls for police-free response |

## Attempts at Reform

### Crisis Intervention Teams (1988-Present)

After Memphis police shot a mentally ill man wielding a knife in 1987, the department partnered with NAMI to develop 40-hour training for officers.

| CIT Model | Elements |
|-----------|----------|
| Training | 40 hours on mental illness, de-escalation |
| Partnerships | Police-mental health collaboration |
| Drop-off | Agreements with receiving facilities |
| Specialty officers | Volunteers take mental health calls |

CIT spread widely but has not fundamentally changed the paradigm of armed response to health emergencies.

### CAHOOTS (1989-Present)

Eugene, Oregon's White Bird Clinic launched an alternative model: unarmed crisis workers responding to mental health calls.

| CAHOOTS Model | Elements |
|---------------|----------|
| Responders | EMT + crisis worker (unarmed) |
| Calls handled | Non-violent mental health, welfare checks |
| Police role | Back-up only when needed (<1% of calls) |
| Success | 35+ years, 24,000 calls/year, model for others |

CAHOOTS demonstrated that non-police response was possible but remained an isolated experiment for decades.

### Mental Health Courts (1997-Present)

Broward County, Florida created the first mental health court in 1997 as an alternative to standard prosecution for defendants with mental illness.

| Mental Health Courts | Growth |
|----------------------|--------|
| 1997 | 1 court |
| 2005 | 150 courts |
| 2015 | 350 courts |
| 2024 | 500+ courts |

Mental health courts represent progress but are post-arrest interventions that do not address crisis response.

### 988 Launch (2022)

The national three-digit mental health crisis number launched in July 2022, providing potential infrastructure for system transformation.

## Lessons from History

### What Went Wrong

| Failure | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Closed hospitals without building alternatives | Created void filled by jails |
| Federal policy excluded hospital funding | States incentivized to discharge |
| Cut community mental health funding | Community services never built |
| No system accountability | No entity responsible for people who fell through cracks |
| Default to police | Armed response to health emergencies |

### What History Teaches

1. **Deinstitutionalization was not the problem**—lack of community alternatives was
2. **Funding matters**—unfunded mandates and block grant cuts eviscerated services
3. **Default systems persist**—without intentional alternatives, police remain first responders
4. **Reform takes decades**—CIT took 35 years to spread; CAHOOTS replication only now happening
5. **Crises drive change**—high-profile deaths create windows for reform
