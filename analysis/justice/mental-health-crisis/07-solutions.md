# Solutions: Reform Proposals for Mental Health Crisis Response

## The Sequential Intercept Model

The Sequential Intercept Model, developed by Mark Munetz and Patricia Griffin and promoted by SAMHSA and the Council of State Governments, provides a framework for understanding intervention points in the criminal justice pathway.

| Intercept | Point | Intervention |
|-----------|-------|--------------|
| 0 | Community | Prevention; community services; before crisis |
| 1 | Crisis/911 | Crisis response; 911 diversion |
| 2 | Initial Detention | Police diversion; deflection |
| 3 | Jail/Court | Mental health courts; diversion programs |
| 4 | Reentry | Transition planning; community reentry |
| 5 | Community Supervision | Specialized probation; treatment courts |

Reform solutions operate across all intercepts, with earlier intercepts offering greater benefit.

1. 911 integration and call-screening protocols
2. Clear criteria for which calls go to civilian teams
3. Rapid police backup capability for escalation
