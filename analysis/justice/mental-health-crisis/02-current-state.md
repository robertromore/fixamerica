# Current State: Mental Health Crisis Response

## The Default System: Police as First Responders

In the vast majority of American communities, mental health emergencies are handled by law enforcement. When someone calls 911 about a person in psychiatric distress, armed police officers respond. This occurs regardless of whether there is any criminal activity, any weapon present, or any threat to public safety.

### How Calls Are Routed

| Call Type | Typical Response | Percentage of 911 Mental Health Calls |
|-----------|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Active threat/weapon | Police | 5-10% |
| Welfare check | Police | 25-30% |
| Person acting erratically | Police | 30-35% |
| Suicidal ideation | Police (often with EMS) | 20-25% |
| Family requesting help | Police | 10-15% |

Most 911 centers lack the capacity to dispatch mental health professionals. Call-takers receive minimal training in assessing mental health calls. The default is to send police for safety, even when the situation involves no crime.

### Police Training Deficits

| Training Topic | Average Police Academy Hours | Recommended Hours |
|----------------|------------------------------|-------------------|
| Firearms | 60-80 | — |
| Defensive tactics | 40-60 | — |
| Mental health | 8-16 | 40+ |
| De-escalation | 8 | 40+ |
| Crisis intervention | 0-8 | 40 |

Standard police academies dedicate less than 2% of training hours to mental health topics. Officers learn to control situations through commands and force, not to recognize and respond to psychiatric symptoms.

### What Happens During Police Response

Police encounters with people in mental health crisis frequently escalate. Symptoms of mental illness—failure to comply with commands, agitation, paranoia, unpredictable movement—trigger police training to use force.

**Common Escalation Patterns:**

- Person does not respond to verbal commands (due to psychosis, dissociation, or cognitive impairment)
- Multiple officers arrive, increasing stimulation and perceived threat
- Officers draw weapons as precaution, increasing fear response
- Physical contact triggers fight-or-flight response
- Restraint techniques cause positional asphyxia or excited delirium

**Outcomes of Police Mental Health Encounters:**

| Outcome | Estimated Frequency |
|---------|---------------------|
| Transport to emergency room | 40-50% |
| Arrest | 15-25% |
| Release at scene | 20-30% |
| Injury to individual | 5-10% |
| Fatal force | ~1,000/year nationally |

## Crisis Intervention Teams (CIT)

The Crisis Intervention Team model, developed in Memphis in 1988 after police shot a mentally ill man, provides specialized training for volunteer officers.

### CIT Program Elements

- 40 hours of specialized training
- Partnerships with mental health providers
- Designated CIT officers respond to mental health calls
- Drop-off agreements with mental health facilities
- Ongoing training and support

### CIT Coverage and Limitations

| CIT Metric | Current Status |
|------------|----------------|
| Departments with some CIT training | ~2,700 |
| Officers who have completed CIT | ~500,000 |
| Departments with fully implemented CIT | <500 |
| Availability of CIT officer on any given shift | Often <50% |

**Limitations of CIT:**

- Still sends armed officers to health emergencies
- Voluntary program—not all calls get CIT response
- Training alone cannot overcome systemic issues
- Does not address root cause of police as default responders
- Mixed evidence on reducing use of force

## Co-Responder Models

Co-responder programs pair police officers with mental health clinicians for crisis calls.

### Types of Co-Responder Programs

| Model | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Ride-along | Clinician rides in police car | Los Angeles, Houston |
| Parallel response | Clinician arrives separately | Denver, San Antonio |
| Phone consultation | Clinician advises by phone | Various |
| Follow-up only | Clinician contacts after police response | Various |

### Advantages and Limitations

**Advantages:**

- Clinician can de-escalate and assess
- Connection to services more likely
- Reduced transport to ER or jail

**Disadvantages:**

- Police still primary responders
- Limited availability (often only business hours)
- Expensive to staff both police and clinicians
- Armed presence may still escalate

## Non-Police Crisis Response

A small but growing number of communities have implemented civilian-led crisis response.

### CAHOOTS (Eugene, Oregon)

The Crisis Assistance Helping Out On The Streets (CAHOOTS) program, operated by the White Bird Clinic since 1989, dispatches two-person teams (EMT + crisis worker) to mental health and non-violent calls.

| CAHOOTS Metric | Data |
|----------------|------|
| Annual calls handled | 24,000+ |
| Percentage of total 911 calls | 17% |
| Calls requiring police backup | <1% |
| Annual budget | $2.1 million |
| Cost per call | ~$87 |
| Equivalent police cost per call | ~$500 |

### Other Non-Police Programs

| Program | Location | Model |
|---------|----------|-------|
| STAR | Denver | Civilian teams for non-violent calls |
| B-HEARD | New York City | EMS-led teams in select areas |
| Crisis Assistance Response and Engagement (CARE) | Los Angeles | Unarmed city teams |
| Community Responders | Oakland | Civilian crisis response |
| Rapid Integrated Group Healthcare Team (RIGHT) | Houston | Mobile crisis team |

## 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline

Launched in July 2022, 988 provides a nationwide three-digit number for mental health crises, similar to 911 for emergencies.

### 988 Infrastructure

| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Call centers nationwide | 200+ |
| Monthly calls/texts/chats | 500,000+ |
| Average answer rate | 85-90% |
| States with mobile crisis teams | 30+ |
| States with dedicated 988 funding | 12 |

### 988 Limitations

- Underfunded in most states
- Mobile crisis teams not yet available everywhere
- Still often routes to police if caller in danger
- No physical infrastructure (crisis centers) in many areas
- Workforce shortage limits expansion

## Emergency Departments

Emergency rooms have become default holding facilities for people in mental health crisis.

### ER Mental Health Data

| Metric | Figure |
|--------|--------|
| Annual ER visits for mental health | 12 million |
| Average ER wait for psychiatric bed | 8-24 hours |
| ER visits resulting in admission | 20-25% |
| Patients boarded in ER 24+ hours | Common |
| Cost per mental health ER visit | $2,000-5,000 |

Emergency departments are not designed for psychiatric care. Boarding—holding patients in ERs for days awaiting psychiatric beds—is standard practice in many hospitals.

## Jails as Mental Health Facilities

### The Numbers

| Jail Mental Health Metric | Figure |
|---------------------------|--------|
| People with serious mental illness in jails | 383,000 |
| Percentage of jail population with SMI | 15-20% |
| Largest mental health facility in U.S. | LA County Jail |
| Second largest | Cook County Jail |
| Third largest | Rikers Island |

### Conditions for Mentally Ill in Jail

**Common Deficiencies:**

- Inadequate screening at booking
- Long waits for psychiatric evaluation
- Insufficient psychiatrists and therapists
- Overuse of solitary confinement
- Medication disruption or discontinuation
- Lack of crisis intervention
- Suicide as leading cause of jail deaths

### Solitary Confinement and Mental Illness

Solitary confinement is used routinely for people with mental illness, despite evidence that it causes and exacerbates psychiatric symptoms.

| Solitary Confinement Data | Figure |
|---------------------------|--------|
| Jail inmates in solitary at any time | 20-25% |
| Mentally ill inmates in solitary | Higher rates |
| Average duration in jail solitary | Days to months |
| Psychiatric effects documented | Anxiety, depression, psychosis, suicide |

## Mental Health Courts

Mental health courts divert people with mental illness from standard criminal prosecution to supervised treatment.

### Mental Health Court Model

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Eligibility | Defendant with mental illness facing charges |
| Process | Charges held in abeyance during treatment |
| Requirements | Treatment compliance, court appearances |
| Duration | 12-24 months typically |
| Success outcome | Charges dismissed or reduced |
| Failure outcome | Return to regular prosecution |

### Mental Health Court Outcomes

| Outcome Metric | Mental Health Court vs. Standard |
|----------------|----------------------------------|
| Recidivism reduction | 20-25% |
| Jail days reduction | 50-75% |
| Treatment engagement | Significantly higher |
| Cost per participant | $4,000-8,000/year |
| Incarceration cost avoided | $15,000-35,000/year |

### Limitations of Mental Health Courts

- Limited capacity (cannot handle volume)
- Require guilty plea in some jurisdictions
- Coercive treatment model
- Net-widening concerns (charging cases that would have been dismissed)
- Not available in all jurisdictions
- Only address post-arrest diversion

## Gaps in the Current System

### What's Missing

| Gap | Impact |
|-----|--------|
| Crisis stabilization centers | People go to ERs or jail instead |
| Mobile crisis teams | Police respond by default |
| Peer support specialists | People don't connect with services |
| Intensive outpatient services | People cycle through crises |
| Supportive housing | Homelessness and mental illness overlap |
| Integrated care | Mental health and substance use treated separately |

### System Failures by Intercept Point

| Intercept | Current Gap |
|-----------|-------------|
| Before crisis | Insufficient prevention and early intervention |
| Crisis response | Police default; few alternatives |
| Post-crisis | No follow-up; return to conditions that caused crisis |
| Arrest | No diversion; booking into jail |
| Court | Limited mental health court capacity |
| Incarceration | Inadequate treatment; damaging conditions |
| Reentry | No transition planning; no housing; no services |
