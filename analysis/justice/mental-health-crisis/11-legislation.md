| Systemic Issue | Impact | Rectification |
|----------------|--------|---------------|
| Federal-state coordination gaps | Fragmented implementation | Establish interagency coordinating body; require state plans for federal funding |
| Lack of community voice in legislation | Programs designed without input of affected communities | Require community advisory boards with majority lived experience membership |
| No requirement for racial equity analysis | Reforms may perpetuate disparities | Mandate racial impact assessments; require disaggregated data; equity performance standards |
| Funding tied to grant cycles | Program instability; staff turnover | Transition to entitlement-based funding (Medicaid); permanent appropriations |
| No repeal of conflicting laws | Existing statutes may undermine reforms | Add explicit preemption language; require regulatory review of conflicting rules |
| Workforce development not addressed | Insufficient workers to implement | Add workforce development grants; loan forgiveness; training pipeline funding |
| Housing and social determinants not addressed | Crisis recurs without addressing root causes | Link crisis funding to housing programs; require supportive housing component |
| No sunset review | Ineffective provisions may persist | Add 5-year sunset with legislative review; require reauthorization |
| Administrative burden on small jurisdictions | Rural areas cannot comply | Create regional support structures; provide administrative capacity grants |
| No protection against net-widening | New systems may increase overall control | Add metrics to track diversion vs. true decarceration; require net reduction outcomes |
