# Special Operations: What You Can Do

Special operations policy is often shrouded in secrecy, but citizens have essential tools to push for democratic accountability over one of the most active and least scrutinized components of the U.S. military.

## 1. Demand Congressional Oversight

The most impactful action citizens can take is to insist that their elected representatives exercise their constitutional oversight responsibility over special operations.

- **Contact Your Representatives**: Write to your Representative and Senators urging them to support the establishment of dedicated Special Operations subcommittees within the Armed Services Committees. Explain that SOF operate in approximately 80 countries with minimal congressional scrutiny.
- **Ask Specific Questions at Town Halls**:
    - "Can you name the countries where U.S. Special Operations Forces are currently deployed? If not, how can you exercise meaningful oversight?"
    - "Do you support reforming Section 127e to require congressional approval, not just notification, for SOF partner force programs?"
    - "What is your position on establishing deployment-to-dwell requirements for Special Operations personnel to address their elevated suicide and TBI rates?"
- **Track Votes**: Follow how your representatives vote on SOF-related amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act. The NDAA is the primary legislative vehicle for SOF oversight reform.

## 2. Support Transparency on SOF Operations

- **Advocate for Public Reporting**: Urge your representatives to support legislation requiring annual public reports on SOF deployments, civilian casualties, and 127e partner force programs. Information that is classified by default will never be subject to public debate.
- **Support Investigative Journalism**: Subscribe to and share the work of journalists and organizations that investigate SOF operations, including *The Intercept*, the *New York Times* national security desk, and the Brown University Costs of War Project. Independent journalism has been the single most effective check on SOF accountability.
- **Engage with FOIA**: Support organizations that file Freedom of Information Act requests for SOF-related documents. Even when heavily redacted, FOIA responses can reveal the scope of operations and the existence of programs the government has not publicly acknowledged.

## 3. Advocate for SOF Personnel Welfare

- **Push for Sustainability Reforms**: Advocate for legislation establishing deployment-to-dwell ratios, mandatory TBI screening, and expanded mental health access for SOF personnel. Frame this as a pro-military position: the current operational tempo is destroying the force.
- **Support SOF Veterans**: Contribute to or volunteer with organizations that support SOF veterans and their families, particularly those focused on mental health, TBI treatment, and transition assistance.
- **Challenge the "Warrior Myth"**: Recognize that glorifying the "superhuman" image of special operators can be harmful. SOF personnel are human beings subject to the same physical and psychological limits as everyone else. Supporting them means acknowledging their vulnerability, not just celebrating their toughness.

## 4. Demand Civilian Casualty Accountability

- **Support Independent Monitoring**: Donate to and amplify the work of organizations like Airwars, the Center for Civilians in Conflict (CIVIC), and Amnesty International that independently investigate civilian harm from U.S. military operations.
- **Advocate for Compensation**: Urge your representatives to fund and expand civilian harm compensation mechanisms. When the U.S. military causes civilian casualties, the victims and their families deserve acknowledgment and redress.
- **Insist on Investigation**: When reports of civilian casualties from SOF operations emerge, demand that your representatives seek answers. Congressional inquiry is the most powerful tool for overcoming the classification barriers that shield SOF operations from scrutiny.

## 5. Get Educated and Educate Others

- **Read Beyond the Headlines**: SOF operations are often covered through a lens of heroism and tactical success. Seek out analysis that examines the strategic, legal, and ethical dimensions of special operations.
- **Engage in Informed Debate**: Discuss SOF oversight with friends, family, and community members. Many Americans are unaware of the scope of SOF operations or the oversight gaps that exist. Raising awareness is the first step toward political action.
