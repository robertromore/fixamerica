# Military Personnel: Legislation

## Overview

Military personnel policy is governed primarily by Title 10 and Title 37 of the United States Code, the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), and defense appropriations bills. The personnel system's statutory framework has not undergone comprehensive reform since the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act (DOPMA) of 1980 and the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986, despite radical changes in the labor market, technology landscape, and operational demands facing the force.

This legislative framework proposes two complementary federal bills. The first, the Military Recruiting and Talent Act, addresses the recruiting crisis by modernizing eligibility standards, establishing lateral entry pathways for critical skills, and reforming recruiter training and marketing. The second, the Military Families Quality of Life Act, addresses the retention crisis by enforcing housing standards, expanding childcare, enabling military spouse employment portability, reforming PCS costs, and expanding the Basic Needs Allowance. Together, these bills attack the personnel problem from both ends: making it easier to join the military and making it more sustainable to stay.

## Constitutional Amendments

*No constitutional amendments are required for military personnel reform.* Congress possesses comprehensive authority over military personnel matters under Article I, Section 8, which grants the power to "raise and support Armies," "provide and maintain a Navy," and "make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces." The Necessary and Proper Clause provides additional authority to structure compensation, benefits, recruiting, and talent management systems.

The professional license reciprocity provisions in the Military Families Quality of Life Act may raise Commerce Clause and federalism questions, as professional licensing is traditionally a state function. However, Congress has broad authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate interstate commerce, and the Supreme Court has upheld federal preemption of state licensing requirements in analogous contexts. The legislation is structured as a conditional requirement tied to military orders rather than a blanket federal licensing regime, minimizing federalism concerns.

AN ACT

To modernize military recruiting, expand the eligible population for military service,
establish lateral entry pathways for critical civilian skills, and improve recruiter
training and marketing effectiveness.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Military Recruiting and Talent Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) The Department of Defense has experienced its most severe recruiting shortfalls
since the establishment of the All-Volunteer Force in 1973, with the Army missing
its FY2023 recruiting target by approximately 10,000 soldiers.
(2) Only 23 percent of Americans aged 17 to 24 meet current military qualification
standards without a waiver, a proportion that has been declining for decades due to
obesity, prior drug use, mental health conditions, and other factors.
(3) Youth propensity to serve has fallen to approximately 9 percent, the lowest
level recorded by the Joint Advertising, Market Research, and Studies program.
(4) The Department of Defense faces critical shortages in cyber operations, software
engineering, artificial intelligence, space operations, and medical specialties that
cannot be filled through traditional accession pipelines alone.
(5) The waiver process for conditions such as prior marijuana use and treated mental
health conditions is inconsistent across services, excessively slow, and discourages
otherwise qualified applicants.

SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.

In this Act:
(1) CRITICAL SPECIALTY.—The term "critical specialty" means a military occupational
specialty, rating, or Air Force specialty code designated by the Secretary of the
applicable military department as experiencing a recruiting or retention shortfall of
10 percent or more relative to authorized strength.
(2) LATERAL ENTRANT.—The term "lateral entrant" means an individual who enters
military service at a grade above E-1 (for enlisted) or O-1 (for officers) based on
civilian professional qualifications, education, and experience.
(3) PREPARATORY PROGRAM.—The term "preparatory program" means a pre-accession training
program, such as the Army Future Soldier Preparatory Course, designed to help applicants
who narrowly fail to meet accession standards achieve qualification.

SEC. 4. ENLISTMENT AND RE-ENLISTMENT BONUS REFORM.

(a) MAXIMUM BONUS INCREASE.—Section 331 of title 37, United States Code, is amended
by striking "$50,000" and inserting "$75,000".
(b) CRITICAL SPECIALTY AUTHORITY.—The Secretary of Defense shall establish, not later
than 180 days after the date of enactment, a Critical Specialty Bonus Schedule that
provides enhanced enlistment bonuses for each critical specialty, updated annually based
on civilian salary benchmarking data.
(c) RECRUITER PERFORMANCE INCENTIVES.—Each service Secretary is authorized to provide
performance-based incentive payments of up to $10,000 per year to military recruiters
who meet or exceed quality-adjusted recruiting benchmarks, as defined by the service.

SEC. 5. ELIGIBILITY WAIVER STANDARDIZATION.

(a) MARIJUANA USE.—
    (1) No applicant shall be disqualified from military service solely on the
    basis of marijuana use that occurred more than 90 days prior to the date
    of application.
    (2) The Secretary of Defense shall establish a uniform waiver standard across
    all services for prior marijuana use occurring within 90 days of application,
    with a processing timeline not to exceed 14 calendar days.
(b) MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS.—
    (1) The Secretary of Defense shall publish, not later than 1 year after enactment,
    evidence-based accession standards for mental health conditions that distinguish
    between conditions that are incompatible with military service and conditions
    that, when treated and in remission, do not impair an individual's ability to
    serve.
    (2) Conditions in the latter category, including but not limited to managed
    attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, resolved mild depression, and resolved
    anxiety disorders, shall not require a waiver if the applicant has been stable
    and without medication for at least 12 months, as documented by a qualified
    health care provider.
(c) MINOR CRIMINAL OFFENSES.—The Secretary of Defense shall standardize waiver
criteria for minor criminal offenses across all services, ensuring that non-violent
misdemeanors that did not result in incarceration are processed within 14 days.
(d) TRANSPARENCY.—Each service shall publish on its recruiting website the current
waiver criteria and average processing time for each category of waiver.

SEC. 6. LATERAL ENTRY AUTHORITY.

(a) ESTABLISHMENT.—Chapter 31 of title 10, United States Code, is amended by adding
the following new section:

"Sec. 520d. Lateral entry of civilian professionals.

"(a) AUTHORITY.—The Secretary of each military department may enlist individuals at
grades E-5 through E-7, or appoint individuals at grades O-3 through O-4, who possess
civilian professional qualifications, certifications, and experience in a critical
specialty, subject to the requirements of this section.

"(b) QUALIFYING SPECIALTIES.—Lateral entry shall be limited to critical specialties
as defined in section 3 of the Military Recruiting and Talent Act of 2026, initially
including but not limited to: cyber operations, software engineering, data science,
artificial intelligence, space operations, medicine, nursing, and dentistry.

"(c) MILITARY TRAINING REQUIREMENT.—Each lateral entrant shall complete a condensed
military training program of not less than 8 weeks and not more than 16 weeks, focused
on military customs and courtesies, physical fitness, basic military skills, and
operational context for the entrant's specialty.

"(d) PROBATIONARY PERIOD.—Each lateral entrant shall serve a probationary period of
not less than 1 year, during which the entrant may be separated without the protections
normally afforded at the entrant's grade.

"(e) NUMERICAL LIMITATION.—The total number of lateral entrants across all services
shall not exceed 2,000 per fiscal year for the first 3 fiscal years following
enactment. The Secretary of Defense may increase this limit by up to 25 percent per
year thereafter based on program performance.

"(f) REPORT.—The Secretary of Defense shall report annually to the congressional
defense committees on the number, specialties, performance ratings, and retention
rates of lateral entrants."

SEC. 7. MARKETING AND ADVERTISING MODERNIZATION.

(a) BUDGET INCREASE.—There are authorized to be appropriated for military advertising
and marketing across all services, in addition to amounts otherwise authorized—
    (1) $300,000,000 for fiscal year 2027; and
    (2) $300,000,000 for fiscal year 2028.
(b) DIGITAL EMPHASIS.—Not less than 60 percent of the additional amounts authorized
under subsection (a) shall be allocated to digital and social media channels, including
influencer partnerships, interactive online platforms, and targeted digital advertising.
(c) COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT.—Not less than 15 percent of the additional amounts authorized
under subsection (a) shall be allocated to community engagement programs in underrepresented
recruiting markets, including urban and suburban areas with low military familiarity.

SEC. 8. RECRUITER TRAINING AND SUPPORT.

(a) SELECTION REFORM.—Each service shall revise its recruiter selection criteria to
prioritize communication skills, cultural fluency with the target demographic, and
aptitude for digital engagement, in addition to military performance.
(b) TRAINING MODERNIZATION.—Each service shall develop and implement updated recruiter
training programs that include instruction in digital marketing, social media
engagement, consultative communication, and data analytics.
(c) RECRUITER SUPPORT.—Each service shall ensure that the recruiter-to-population
ratio in its assigned areas of responsibility is sufficient to meet recruiting targets
without requiring individual recruiters to work more than 50 hours per week on a
sustained basis.

SEC. 9. PREPARATORY PROGRAM EXPANSION.

(a) AUTHORIZATION.—Each military department is authorized to operate preparatory
programs for applicants who narrowly fail to meet accession standards in academic
aptitude, physical fitness, or body composition.
(b) CAPACITY.—The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that preparatory program capacity
across all services is sufficient to accommodate not fewer than 15,000 participants
per fiscal year by fiscal year 2028.
(c) STANDARDS.—Completion of a preparatory program shall not exempt any individual
from meeting the full accession standard; the program is a pathway to qualification,
not a substitute for it.

SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on October 1, 2026.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 4 (Bonus Reform)**: Raises the statutory cap on enlistment bonuses from $50,000 to $75,000 and creates a mechanism for annual adjustment based on civilian labor market data, ensuring bonuses remain competitive. Recruiter incentive pay addresses the recruiting force's own morale and performance.
- **Section 5 (Waiver Standardization)**: The 90-day marijuana look-back and 12-month mental health stability standard are based on clinical evidence and current best practices. The 14-day processing requirement eliminates the bureaucratic delays that cause applicant attrition.
- **Section 6 (Lateral Entry)**: The 2,000-per-year cap and probationary period ensure that the program begins as a controlled experiment. The condensed military training requirement ensures lateral entrants develop basic military competence without requiring the full accession pipeline.
- **Section 7 (Marketing)**: The $600 million authorization over two years, with a 60 percent digital allocation, reflects the reality that the target demographic consumes media primarily through digital channels.
- **Section 9 (Preparatory Programs)**: Scaling to 15,000 participants addresses the largest eligibility gaps (fitness and academics) without lowering standards -- participants must still meet full standards to proceed to basic training.

**Potential Challenges**:

- Marijuana waiver reform will face opposition from those who view any drug use as disqualifying, regardless of timing or legality.
- Lateral entry will be resisted by military traditionalists who argue that it undermines the professional development model.
- Increased marketing spending will face scrutiny from fiscal hawks and those who question whether recruiting is a marketing problem.

**Refinements**:

- Include a 5-year sunset clause on lateral entry authority, requiring reauthorization based on program evaluation data.
- Phase waiver reforms through a 1-year pilot in a single service before full implementation.
- Require GAO evaluation of marketing effectiveness after 2 years.

### The Military Families Quality of Life Act

**Purpose**: To improve military family quality of life by enforcing housing standards, expanding childcare, enabling military spouse employment portability, reforming PCS cost reimbursement, and expanding the Basic Needs Allowance.

**Key Provisions**:

1. **Military Housing Standards Enforcement**: Establishes independent inspection, enforceable penalties, and resident withhold rights for privatized military housing.
2. **Universal Childcare on Installations**: Funds the elimination of childcare waitlists at all military installations within 5 years.
3. **Spouse Employment Portability**: Requires interstate recognition of professional licenses held by military spouses under PCS orders.
4. **PCS Cost Reform**: Increases reimbursement to cover actual documented costs and provides non-repayable travel advances.
5. **Basic Needs Allowance Expansion**: Raises the income threshold from 150 percent to 200 percent of the federal poverty level.

**Draft Text**:

[119th CONGRESS, 2nd Session]

AN ACT

To improve the quality of life for military families by enforcing housing standards,
expanding childcare availability, enabling military spouse employment portability,
reforming permanent change of station cost reimbursement, and expanding the Basic
Needs Allowance.

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of
America in Congress assembled,

SEC. 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "Military Families Quality of Life Act of 2026".

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

Congress finds the following:
(1) Approximately 52 percent of active-duty service members have dependents, and
the quality of life experienced by military families directly affects recruiting and
retention.
(2) The Government Accountability Office has identified approximately 28,000
privatized military housing units in need of major repair or renovation.
(3) Approximately 9,000 children of service members are on waitlists for on-
installation childcare.
(4) The unemployment rate for military spouses is approximately 21 percent, driven
primarily by frequent relocations and the inability to transfer professional licenses
across state lines.
(5) Military families report average out-of-pocket costs of $2,000 to $5,000 per
permanent change of station move beyond reimbursed amounts.
(6) Approximately 14 percent of military families report some level of food
insecurity.

SEC. 3. MILITARY HOUSING STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT.

(a) INDEPENDENT INSPECTION.—
    (1) The Secretary of Defense shall establish a Military Housing Inspection Program,
    independent of installation commands and housing management companies, to conduct
    annual inspections of all privatized military family housing and unaccompanied
    housing units.
    (2) Inspection standards shall include, at a minimum: structural integrity, HVAC
    functionality, mold and moisture levels, lead paint status, pest control, fire
    safety, and responsiveness of maintenance services.
    (3) Inspection results for each installation shall be published on a publicly
    accessible Department of Defense website within 30 days of completion.
(b) ENFORCEABLE PENALTIES.—
    (1) If a privatized housing company fails to remediate a condition identified as
    a health or safety hazard within 30 days of notice, the installation commander
    shall impose a financial penalty of not less than $500 per unit per day of non-
    compliance.
    (2) If a privatized housing company fails to achieve an overall satisfactory
    rating on its annual inspection for 2 consecutive years, the Secretary of the
    applicable military department shall initiate contract remediation procedures,
    which may include contract modification, appointment of a receiver, or contract
    termination for cause.
(c) RESIDENT WITHHOLD RIGHTS.—
    (1) A service member residing in privatized military housing may request that
    the installation place the member's Basic Allowance for Housing in escrow if a
    documented maintenance deficiency constituting a health or safety hazard is not
    remediated within 30 days of a formal work order.
    (2) Escrowed funds shall be released to the housing company only upon certified
    completion of the repair by the independent inspection program.
    (3) No adverse action may be taken against a service member for exercising
    rights under this subsection.

SEC. 4. UNIVERSAL CHILDCARE ON MILITARY INSTALLATIONS.

(a) CONSTRUCTION AUTHORIZATION.—The Secretary of Defense is authorized to construct,
expand, or renovate Child Development Centers on military installations as necessary to
eliminate waitlists for childcare for children of active-duty service members.
(b) TIMELINE.—Waitlists shall be eliminated at all military installations not later
than 5 years after the date of enactment.
(c) AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.—There are authorized to be appropriated for
military construction related to Child Development Centers—
    (1) $800,000,000 for fiscal year 2027;
    (2) $800,000,000 for fiscal year 2028;
    (3) $600,000,000 for fiscal year 2029;
    (4) $400,000,000 for fiscal year 2030; and
    (5) $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2031.
(d) EXTENDED HOURS.—Not later than 2 years after enactment, Child Development Centers
at installations with more than 5,000 active-duty personnel shall offer extended hours
of operation, including early morning, evening, and weekend care, to accommodate service
members working non-standard schedules.
(e) FEE STRUCTURE.—The income-based fee structure for military Child Development Centers
shall be maintained, and no military family shall pay more than 10 percent of household
income for on-installation childcare.

SEC. 5. MILITARY SPOUSE EMPLOYMENT PORTABILITY.

(a) INTERSTATE LICENSE RECOGNITION.—
    (1) Notwithstanding any provision of State law, a covered license issued to a
    military spouse by one State shall be recognized as valid in any other State to
    which the spouse relocates pursuant to a permanent change of station order
    issued to the member of the Armed Forces to whom the spouse is married.
    (2) A covered license recognized under this subsection shall remain valid for the
    duration of the service member's assignment to the receiving State, plus 1 year
    following the service member's departure from that State.
(b) COVERED LICENSE.—The term "covered license" means any professional or occupational
license, certification, or permit required by a State for the practice of a profession
or occupation, including but not limited to: nursing, teaching, law, counseling,
social work, real estate, cosmetology, pharmacy, physical therapy, and accounting.
(c) SCOPE LIMITATION.—This section does not require a State to issue a new license to
a military spouse; it requires recognition of the existing license for the duration
specified in subsection (a)(2).
(d) FEDERAL PREEMPTION.—This section preempts any State law to the extent that it
would prevent recognition of a covered license as described in this section.
(e) ENFORCEMENT.—A military spouse whose covered license is not recognized in
violation of this section may bring an action in Federal district court for injunctive
relief and reasonable attorney's fees.

SEC. 6. PERMANENT CHANGE OF STATION COST REFORM.

(a) ACTUAL COST REIMBURSEMENT.—The Secretary of Defense shall revise the Joint Travel
Regulations to reimburse service members for actual documented costs of permanent change
of station moves, including transportation, temporary lodging, and incidental expenses,
up to a maximum amount established annually by the Secretary based on the average total
cost of a military move as determined by the most recent DoD moving cost study.
(b) DISLOCATION ALLOWANCE INCREASE.—Section 452 of title 37, United States Code, is
amended to increase the Dislocation Allowance by not less than 25 percent, effective
for moves occurring after October 1, 2027.
(c) ADVANCE TRAVEL PAY.—Service members receiving PCS orders shall be entitled to a
non-repayable advance travel payment equal to 80 percent of the estimated total
reimbursable moving cost, disbursed not later than 30 days before the scheduled
report date. The advance shall be reconciled against actual costs upon completion of
the move.

SEC. 7. BASIC NEEDS ALLOWANCE EXPANSION.

(a) INCOME THRESHOLD.—Section 402b of title 37, United States Code, is amended by
striking "150 percent" and inserting "200 percent".
(b) SIMPLIFIED APPLICATION.—The Secretary of Defense shall implement a simplified
application process for the Basic Needs Allowance that requires the applicant to
provide only household income documentation and family size, with eligibility
determined automatically based on military pay records.
(c) OUTREACH.—Each service shall conduct annual outreach to all service members at
pay grades E-1 through E-6 to ensure awareness of the Basic Needs Allowance and
the application process.

SEC. 8. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

In addition to amounts otherwise authorized, there are authorized to be appropriated—
    (1) for the Military Housing Inspection Program, $50,000,000 per fiscal year for
    fiscal years 2027 through 2031;
    (2) for the Basic Needs Allowance expansion, such sums as may be necessary; and
    (3) for PCS cost reform implementation, $200,000,000 for fiscal year 2027.

SEC. 9. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on October 1, 2026, except that—
    (a) Section 5 (Spouse Employment Portability) shall take effect 180 days after
    the date of enactment; and
    (b) Section 6 (PCS Cost Reform) shall take effect for moves ordered on or after
    October 1, 2027.
```

**Explanation of Key Provisions**:

- **Section 3 (Housing Enforcement)**: The independent inspection program and financial penalties address the core problem: housing companies have little incentive to maintain quality because service members have limited alternatives. The escrow provision gives residents leverage without requiring them to leave base housing.
- **Section 4 (Childcare)**: The $2.8 billion authorization over 5 years is based on DoD estimates of the construction cost needed to eliminate waitlists. The 10 percent income cap ensures affordability.
- **Section 5 (Spouse License Reciprocity)**: The Commerce Clause-based federal preemption is structured narrowly -- it does not create a federal licensing regime but requires states to recognize existing licenses during PCS assignments. The private right of action provides enforcement without requiring federal agency involvement.
- **Section 6 (PCS Reform)**: Actual-cost reimbursement and non-repayable advances eliminate the financial penalty of PCS moves. The 80 percent advance prevents families from going into debt during moves.
- **Section 7 (Basic Needs Allowance)**: Raising the threshold from 150 percent to 200 percent of the federal poverty level ensures that no military family qualifies for civilian means-tested assistance programs.

**Potential Challenges**:

- Spouse license reciprocity will face opposition from state licensing boards and professional associations that view federal preemption as an intrusion on state authority.
- Housing enforcement provisions may face legal challenges from privatized housing companies with existing 50-year contracts.
- The total cost of the legislation ($3+ billion over 5 years for childcare alone) will face fiscal scrutiny.

**Refinements**:

- Include a safe harbor provision for states that adopt their own military spouse license reciprocity within 2 years of enactment, avoiding federal preemption.
- Phase housing enforcement provisions to give companies 1 year to come into compliance before penalties apply.
- Include a sunset clause on increased PCS reimbursement rates, requiring GAO evaluation and reauthorization after 5 years.

---

## State Model Legislation

### Military Spouse Professional License Reciprocity Act (Model State Bill)

**Purpose**: For states that wish to enact their own reciprocity framework rather than be subject to federal preemption.

```text
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

This Act may be cited as the "[State] Military Spouse Professional License
Reciprocity Act".

SECTION 2. DEFINITIONS.

(a) "Military spouse" means the spouse of an active-duty member of the United
States Armed Forces, including the Reserve and National Guard, who has relocated
to this State pursuant to military orders.
(b) "Covered license" means any professional or occupational license, certification,
or permit issued by another State.

SECTION 3. LICENSE RECOGNITION.

(a) A military spouse holding a covered license in good standing from another State
shall be authorized to practice the licensed profession in this State upon submission
of an application to the appropriate licensing board, together with proof of military
spouse status, proof of the out-of-state license, and payment of a fee not to
exceed $75.
(b) The licensing board shall process the application within 30 days of receipt.
(c) The license recognized under this section shall be valid for the duration of the
service member's assignment to this State, plus 1 year.

SECTION 4. EXPEDITED FULL LICENSURE.

A military spouse practicing under a recognized license may apply for full licensure
in this State under an expedited process that grants credit for education, training,
and experience completed in the issuing State.

SECTION 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.

This Act shall take effect on [date].
```

**Adaptations**: States may customize the fee amount, the scope of covered professions, and the process for expedited full licensure based on their existing licensing framework.

---

## Regulatory Framework

### DoD Directive: Military Accession Standards Review

**Existing Authority**: 10 U.S.C. Section 505 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to prescribe regulations for enlistment, including physical, mental, and moral standards.

**Draft Regulation**: The Secretary of Defense shall direct the Under Secretary for Personnel and Readiness to conduct a comprehensive review of all military accession medical and moral standards, to be completed within 18 months of the date of this directive, with recommendations for:

1. Standards that should be updated based on current clinical evidence.
2. Conditions that should be removed from the disqualification list when in stable remission.
3. Waiver processes that should be streamlined or eliminated.
4. Transparency requirements for publishing accession standards and waiver criteria.

**Explanation**: This administrative action can be taken by the Secretary of Defense without legislation and would complement the statutory waiver reforms in the Military Recruiting and Talent Act.

---

## Legal Considerations

### Constitutional Issues

- **Commerce Clause and Spouse Licensing**: The spouse license reciprocity provision relies on Congress's Commerce Clause power. Professional licensing affects interstate commerce, and the Supreme Court has recognized Congress's authority to preempt state regulations that burden interstate commerce. The provision is strengthened by the connection to military orders -- Congress's military powers under Article I, Section 8 provide additional constitutional grounding.
- **Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) Parallel**: USERRA already establishes federal requirements affecting state employment law for service members. The spouse license reciprocity provision extends similar protections to military spouses.

### Preemption Questions

- **Federal vs. State Licensing Authority**: The Military Families Quality of Life Act explicitly preempts state licensing laws that would prevent recognition of military spouse credentials. This preemption is narrow (limited to military spouses under PCS orders and time-limited) and leaves the broader state licensing framework intact.
- **Housing Contract Law**: Enforcement provisions affecting privatized housing companies operate within existing federal contracts. Contract modification authority is well-established under federal procurement law.

### Enforcement Mechanisms

- **Housing**: Independent inspection, financial penalties, contract remediation, and resident escrow rights. The Inspector General provides additional oversight.
- **Spouse Licensing**: Private right of action in federal court, with attorney's fees to incentivize enforcement.
- **Recruiting and Talent**: Service-level implementation monitored by USD(P&R), with annual reporting to Congress.

### Sunset and Review Provisions

- Lateral entry authority sunsets after 5 years unless reauthorized.
- Marketing budget increase applies to FY2027-2028 only, requiring further authorization.
- GAO is directed to evaluate housing enforcement, PCS cost reform, and lateral entry program effectiveness at the 3-year and 5-year marks.

## Loopholes, Shortcomings, and Rectification

### Military Recruiting and Talent Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Bonus inflation without retention | Higher enlistment bonuses may attract recruits who leave after their initial obligation, yielding high cost per retained service member | Medium |
| Lateral entry rank gaming | Civilian applicants may inflate credentials to qualify for higher entry grade | High |
| Waiver abuse | Standardized waivers could be exploited by applicants who conceal the severity of prior conditions | Medium |
| Marketing spend without accountability | Increased marketing budget could be absorbed by contractors without measurable recruiting improvement | Medium |
| Preparatory program as lowered standard | Critics may argue that preparatory programs effectively lower standards by giving marginal candidates multiple attempts | Low |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Does not address civilian public health | The shrinking eligible population is primarily a public health problem (obesity, mental health) beyond DoD's control | Military policy alone cannot fix population-level health trends |
| Lateral entry cap may be too low | 2,000 per year across all services may be insufficient for critical fields like cyber | Political caution in the initial authorization |
| No structural pay reform | Targeted bonuses do not address the fundamental rigidity of the military pay table | Comprehensive pay reform is politically difficult and was deferred |
| Recruiter burnout unaddressed structurally | Section 8(c) limits hours but does not fundamentally change the recruiter-to-mission ratio | Recruiter manning is determined by end-strength decisions made elsewhere |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Require that all enlistment bonuses exceeding $30,000 include a service obligation of at least 5 years, with pro-rated repayment for early separation, to link bonus spending to retention outcomes.
2. Establish a credential verification board for lateral entry applicants, including civilian subject-matter experts and military counterparts, to prevent rank gaming.
3. Implement post-accession monitoring for waiver recipients at 6-month and 12-month marks to detect conditions that were not fully disclosed during the application process.
4. Require annual ROI analysis of marketing spending, with digital attribution tracking to connect advertising exposure to application and enlistment outcomes.
5. Publish clear standards for preparatory program completion and track the subsequent performance and retention of preparatory program graduates versus direct accessions.

### Military Families Quality of Life Act

#### Potential Loopholes

| Loophole | Description | Severity |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Housing company litigation delays | Companies may use legal challenges to delay penalty enforcement for years | High |
| License reciprocity gaps | Self-employed and contract workers may not be covered by "license" as defined | Medium |
| PCS cost inflation | Actual-cost reimbursement may incentivize inflated moving expenses | Medium |
| BNA eligibility gaming | Some families may restructure finances to qualify for expanded BNA | Low |
| Childcare construction delays | MILCON timelines often exceed planned schedules, delaying waitlist elimination | High |

#### Shortcomings

| Issue | Impact | Root Cause |
|-------|--------|------------|
| Does not terminate bad housing contracts | Renegotiation is weaker than termination, and companies may resist meaningful changes | 50-year contract terms limit government leverage |
| Federal preemption may be challenged | States and licensing boards may litigate, delaying implementation | Constitutional federalism tensions |
| Childcare workforce not addressed | Building facilities without sufficient qualified childcare workers creates empty centers | Childcare worker wages are low and the labor market is tight |
| PCS reform does not reduce move frequency | Higher reimbursement does not address the root cause of excessive relocations | PCS frequency is driven by service assignment policies |

#### Rectification Procedures

1. Include expedited arbitration provisions for housing disputes, with binding arbitration timelines of 60 days maximum to prevent litigation delay.
2. Provide federal funding incentives to states that voluntarily adopt the model reciprocity legislation within 2 years, as an alternative to preemption litigation.
3. Include childcare worker recruitment and retention bonuses (up to $5,000 per year) as an authorized use of CDC construction funds to ensure that new facilities can be staffed.
4. Direct the Secretary of Defense to revise service assignment policies to achieve a minimum average tour length of 3 years at CONUS installations by FY2030, reducing PCS frequency by 25 percent.
5. Authorize DoD to withhold up to 5 percent of the housing allowance pool for an installation from the privatized housing company's revenue stream and place it in a maintenance escrow fund controlled by the installation commander.

### General Implementation Concerns

#### Systemic Issues

| Interservice inconsistency | Direct USD(P&R) to develop uniform implementation guidance within 180 days; mandate compliance reporting |
| Cost growth risk | Include annual cost caps with automatic program reviews triggered at 110% of authorized spending |
| Congressional oversight gaps | Require quarterly briefings to SASC and HASC personnel subcommittees during the first 3 years of implementation |
| Data infrastructure | Fund DoD data systems modernization to enable real-time tracking of recruiting, retention, housing, and childcare metrics |

#### Sunset and Review Provisions

All novel authorities created by these bills (lateral entry, expanded waivers, housing penalties, license preemption) should include 5-year sunset clauses with mandatory GAO evaluation at the 3-year mark. Reauthorization should be conditioned on demonstrated effectiveness against the metrics established in the legislation. The childcare construction authorization should be reviewed at the 3-year mark to assess whether construction timelines are on track and whether adjustments to the authorization are needed.
